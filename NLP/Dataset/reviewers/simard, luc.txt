0902.4080	frequency and properties of bars in cluster and field galaxies at  intermediate redshifts	we present a study of large-scale bars in field and cluster environments outto redshifts of ~0.8 using a final sample of 945 moderately inclined diskgalaxies drawn from the ediscs project. we characterize bars and their hostgalaxies and look for relations between the presence of a bar and theproperties of the underlying disk. we investigate whether the fraction andproperties of bars in clusters are different from their counterparts in thefield. the total optical bar fraction in the redshift range z=0.4-0.8 (medianz=0.60), averaged over the entire sample, is 25% (20% for strong bars). for thecluster and field subsamples, we measure bar fractions of 24% and 29%,respectively. we find that bars in clusters are on average longer than in thefield and preferentially found close to the cluster center, where the barfraction is somewhat higher (~31%) than at larger distances (~18%). thesefindings however rely on a relatively small subsample and might be affected bysmall number statistics. in agreement with local studies, we find thatdisk-dominated galaxies have a higher optical bar fraction (~45%) thanbulge-dominated galaxies (~15%). this result is based on hubble types andeffective radii and does not change with redshift. the latter finding impliesthat bar formation or dissolution is strongly connected to the emergence of themorphological structure of a disk and is typically accompanied by a transitionin the hubble type.

0903.4684	the mass-metallicity relation in galaxy clusters: the relative  importance of cluster membership versus local environment	using a large (14,857), homogenously selected sample of cluster galaxiesidentified in the sloan digital sky survey data release 4 (sdss dr4), weinvestigate the impact of cluster membership and local density on the stellarmass-gas phase metallicity relation (mzr). we show that stellar metallicitiesare not suitable for this work, being relatively insensitive to subtle changesin the mzr. accurate nebular abundances can be obtained for 1318 clustergalaxies in our sample and we show that these galaxies are drawn from clustersthat are fully repesentative of the parent sample in terms of mass, size,velocity dispersion and richness. by comparing the mzr of the cluster galaxieswith a sample control of galaxies matched in mass, redshift, fibre coveringfraction and rest-frame g-r colour cluster galaxies are found to have, onaverage, higher metallicities by up to 0.04 dex. the magnitude of this offsetdoes not depend strongly on galactic half-light radius or cluster propertiessuch as velocity dispersion or cluster mass. the effect of local density on themzr is investigated, using the presence of a near neighbour and both two- andthree-dimensional density estimators. for all three metrics, it is found thatthe cluster galaxies in locally rich environments have higher medianmetallicities by up to ~ 0.05 dex than those in locally poor environments (orwithout a near neighbour). control (non-cluster) galaxies at locally highdensities exhibit similar metal-enhancements. taken together, these resultsshow that galaxies in clusters are, on average, slightly more metal-rich thanthe field, but that this effect is driven by local overdensity and not simplycluster membership.

0905.4503	the rest-frame optical luminosity function of cluster galaxies at z&lt;0.8  and the assembly of the cluster red sequence	we present the rest-frame optical luminosity function (lf) of red sequencegalaxies in 16 clusters at 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.8 drawn from the eso distant cluster survey(ediscs). we compare our clusters to an analogous sample from the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) and match the ediscs clusters to their most likelydescendants. we measure all lfs down to m m* + (2.5 - 3.5). at z&lt;0.8, thebright end of the lf is consistent with passive evolution but there is asignificant build-up of the faint end of the red sequence towards lowerredshift. there is a weak dependence of the lf on cluster velocity dispersionfor ediscs but no such dependence for the sdss clusters. we find tentativeevidence that red sequence galaxies brighter than a threshold magnitude arealready in place, and that this threshold evolves to fainter magnitudes towardlower redshifts. we compare the ediscs lfs with the lf of co-eval red sequencegalaxies in the field and find that the bright end of the lfs agree. however,relative to the number of bright red galaxies, the field has more faint redgalaxies than clusters at 0.6&lt;z&lt;0.8 but fewer at 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.6, implyingdifferential evolution. we compare the total light in the ediscs cluster redsequences to the total red sequence light in our sdss cluster sample. clustersat 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.8 must increase their luminosity on the red sequence (and thereforestellar mass in red galaxies) by a factor of 1-3 by z=0. the necessaryprocesses that add mass to the red sequence in clusters predict local clustersthat are over-luminous as compared to those observed in the sdss. the predictedcluster luminosities can be reconciled with observed local cluster luminositiesby combining multiple previously known effects.

0907.4380	dynamics of lyman break galaxies and their host halos	we present deep two-dimensional spectra of 22 candidate and confirmed lymanbreak galaxies (lbgs) at redshifts 2&lt;z&lt;4 in the hubble deep field (hdf)obtained at the keck ii telescope. the targets were preferentially selectedwith spatial extent and/or multiple knot morphologies, and we used slitmasksand individual slits tilted to optimize measurement of any spatially resolvedkinematics. the median target magnitude was i_814=25.3, and total exposuretimes ranged from 10 to 50 ks. we measure redshifts, some new, ranging fromz=0.2072 to z=4.056, including two interlopers at z&lt;1, and resulting in asample of 14 lbgs with a median redshift z=2.424. the morphologies andkinematics of the close pairs and multiple knot sources in our sample aregenerally inconsistent with galaxy formation scenarios postulating that lbgsoccur only at the bottom of the potential wells of massive host halos; rather,they support ``collisional starburst'' models with significant major mergerrates and a broad halo occupation distribution. for 13 lbgs with possiblekinematic signatures, we estimate simple dynamical masses ranging from 4e9 h^-1m_sun to 1.1e11 h^-1 m_sun for individual galaxies and from &lt;10e10 h^-1 to~10^14 h^-1 m_sun with a median value 1e13 h^-1 m_sun for host dark matterhalos. comparison with a recent numerical galaxy formation model implies thatthe pairwise velocities might not reflect true dynamical masses. we compare ourdynamical mass estimates directly to stellar masses and find no evidence for astrong correlation. the diversity of morphologies and dynamics implies thatlbgs represent a broad range of galaxy or proto-galaxy types in a variety ofevolutionary or merger stages rather than a uniform class with a narrow rangeof mass.

0909.0269	a relationship between supermassive black hole mass and the total  gravitational mass of the host galaxy	we investigate the correlation between the mass of a central supermassiveblack hole and the total gravitational mass of the host galaxy (m_tot). theresults are based on 43 galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses from the sloanlens acs (slacs) survey whose black hole masses were estimated through twoscaling relations: the relation between black hole mass and sersic index (m_bh- n) and the relation between black hole mass and stellar velocity dispersion(m_bh - sigma). we use the enclosed mass within r_200, the radius within whichthe density profile of the early type galaxy exceeds the critical density ofthe universe by a factor of 200, determined by gravitational lens models fittedto hst imaging data, as a tracer of the total gravitational mass. the best fitcorrelation, where m_bh is determined from m_bh - sigma relation, is log(m_bh)= (8.18 +/- 0.11) + (1.55 +/- 0.31) (log(m_tot) - 13.0) over 2 orders ofmagnitude in m_bh. from a variety of tests, we find that we cannot reliablyinfer a connection between m_bh and m_tot from the m_bh - n relation. the m_bh- m_tot relation provides some of the first, direct observational evidence totest the prediction that supermassive black hole properties are determined bythe halo properties of the host galaxy.

0910.1612	evolution of the early-type galaxy fraction in clusters since z = 0.8	we study the morphological content of a large sample of high-redshiftclusters to determine its dependence on cluster mass and redshift. quantitativemorphologies are based on bulge+disk decompositions of cluster and fieldgalaxies on deep vlt/fors2 images of 18 optically-selected clusters at 0.45 &lt; z&lt; 0.80 from the eso distant cluster survey (ediscs). morphological content isgiven by the early-type galaxy fraction f_et, and early-type galaxies areselected based on their bulge fraction and image smoothness. a set of 158 sdssclusters is analyzed exactly as the ediscs sample to provide a robust localcomparison. our main results are: (1) f_et values for the sdss and ediscsclusters exhibit no clear trend as a function of sigma. (2) mid-z ediscsclusters around sigma = 500 km/s have f_et ~= 0.5 whereas high-z ediscsclusters have f_et ~= 0.4 (~25% increase over 2 gyrs). (3) there is a markeddifference in the morphological content of ediscs and sdss clusters. none ofthe ediscs clusters have f_et greater than 0.6 whereas half of the sdssclusters lie above this value. this difference is seen in clusters of allvelocity dispersions. (4) there is a strong correlation between morphology andstar formation in sdss and ediscs clusters. this correlation holds independentof sigma and z even though the fraction of [oii] emitters decreases from z~0.8to z~0.06 in all environments. our results pose an interesting challenge tostructural transformation and star formation quenching processes that stronglydepend on the global cluster environment and suggest that cluster membershipmay be of lesser importance than other variables in determining galaxyproperties.

1002.4418	galaxy pairs in the sloan digital sky survey - ii: the effect of  environment on interactions	we use a sample of close galaxy pairs selected from the sloan digital skysurvey data release 4 (sdss dr4) to investigate in what environments galaxymergers occur and how the results of these mergers depend on differences inlocal galaxy density. the galaxies are quantified morphologically usingtwo-dimensional bulge-plus-disk decompositions and compared to a control samplematched in stellar mass, redshift and local projected density. lower densityenvironments have fractionally more galaxy pairs with small projectedseparations (r_p) and relative velocities (delta v), but even high densityenvironments contain significant populations of pairs with parameters thatshould be conducive to interactions. metrics of asymmetry and colour are usedto identify merger activity and triggered star formation. the location of starformation is inferred by distinguishing bulge and disk colours and calculatingbulge fractions from the sdss images. galaxies in the lowest densityenvironments show the largest changes in star formation rate, asymmetry andbulge-total fractions at small separations, accompanied by bluer bulge colours.at the highest local densities, the only galaxy property to show an enhancementin the closest pairs is asymmetry. we interpret these results as evidence thatwhilst interactions (leading to tidal distortions) occur at all densities,triggered star formation is seen only in low-to-intermediate densityenvironments. we suggest that this is likely due to the typically higher gasfractions of galaxies in low density environments. finally, bycross-correlating our sample of galaxy pairs with a cluster catalogue, weinvestigate the dependence of interactions on clustercentric distance. it isfound that for close pairs the fraction of asymmetric galaxies is highest inthe cluster centres.

0708.0835	rest-frame ultraviolet to near infrared observations of an interacting  lyman break galaxy at z = 4.42	we present the rest-frame ultraviolet through near infrared spectral energydistribution for an interacting lyman break galaxy at a redshift z=4.42, thehighest redshift merging system known with clearly resolved tidal features. thetwo objects in this system - hdf-g4 and its previously unidentified companion -are both b_{435} band dropouts, have similar v_{606}-i_{775} andi_{775}-z_{850} colors, and are separated by 1", which at z=4.42 corresponds to7 kpc projected nuclear separation; all indicative of an interacting system.fits to stellar population models indicate a stellar mass of m_\star =2.6\times 10^{10} m_\odot, age of \tau_\star = 720 my, and exponential starformation history with an e-folding time \tau_0 = 440 my. using these derivedstellar populations as constraints, we model the hdf-g4 system usinghydrodynamical simulations, and find that it will likely evolve into a quasarby z\sim3.5, and a quiescent, compact spheroid by z\sim 2.5 similar to thoseobserved at z &gt; 2. and, the existence of such an object supports galaxyformation models in which major mergers drive the high redshift buildup ofspheroids and black holes.

1006.3558	on the evolution of the velocity-mass-size relations of disk-dominated  galaxies over the past 10 billion years	we study the evolution of the scaling relations between maximum circularvelocity, stellar mass and optical half-light radius of star-formingdisk-dominated galaxies in the context of lcdm-based galaxy formation models.using data from the literature combined with new data from the deep2 and aegissurveys we show that there is a consistent observational and theoreticalpicture for the evolution of these scaling relations from z\sim 2 to z=0. theevolution of the observed stellar scaling relations is weaker than that of thevirial scaling relations of dark matter haloes, which can be reproduced, bothqualitatively and quantitatively, with a simple, cosmologically-motivated modelfor disk evolution inside growing nfw dark matter haloes. in this model opticalhalf-light radii are smaller, both at fixed stellar mass and maximum circularvelocity, at higher redshifts. this model also predicts that the scalingrelations between baryonic quantities evolve even more weakly than thecorresponding stellar relations. we emphasize, though, that this weak evolutiondoes not imply that individual galaxies evolve weakly. on the contrary,individual galaxies grow strongly in mass, size and velocity, but in such a waythat they move largely along the scaling relations. finally, recentobservations have claimed surprisingly large sizes for a number of star-formingdisk galaxies at z \sim 2, which has caused some authors to suggest that highredshift disk galaxies have abnormally high spin parameters. however, we arguethat the disk scale lengths in question have been systematically overestimatedby a factor \sim 2, and that there is an offset of a factor \sim 1.4 betweenh\alpha sizes and optical sizes. taking these effects into account, there is noindication that star forming galaxies at high redshifts (z\sim 2) haveabnormally high spin parameters.

1007.1002	colours of bulges and discs within galaxy clusters and the signature of  disc fading on infall	the origins of the bulge and disc components of galaxies are of primaryimportance to understanding galaxy formation. here bulge-disc decomposition isperformed simultaneously in b- and r-bands for 922 bright galaxies in 8 nearby(z &lt; 0.06) clusters with deep redshift coverage using photometry from the noaofundamental plane survey. the total galaxy colours follow a universalcolour-magnitude relation (cmr). the discs of l_* galaxies are 0.24 magnitudesbluer in $b-r$ than bulges. bulges have a significant cmr slope while the cmrslope of discs is flat. thus the slope of the cmr of the total light is drivenprimarily (60%) by the bulge-cmr, and to a lesser extent (40%) by the change inthe bulge-to-total ratio as a function of magnitude. the colours of the bulgeand disc components do not depend on the bulge-to-total ratio, for galaxieswith bulge-to-total ratios greater than 0.2. while the colours of the bulgecomponents do not depend significantly on environment, the median colours ofdiscs vary significantly, with discs in the cluster centre redder by 0.10magnitudes than those at the virial radius. thus while star formation in bulgesappears to be regulated primarily by mass-dependent, and hence presumablyinternal, processes, that of discs is affected by the cluster environment.

1010.2495	automated morphological classification of sdss red sequence galaxies	(abridged) in the last decade, the advent of enormous galaxy surveys hasmotivated the development of automated morphological classification schemes todeal with large data volumes. existing automated schemes can successfullydistinguish between early and late type galaxies and identify mergercandidates, but are inadequate for studying detailed morphologies of redsequence galaxies. to fill this need, we present a new automated classificationscheme that focuses on making finer distinctions between early types roughlycorresponding to hubble types e, s0, and sa. we visually classify a sample of984 non-starforming sdss galaxies with apparent sizes &gt;14". we then develop anautomated method to closely reproduce the visual classifications, which bothprovides a check on the visual results and makes it possible to extendmorphological analysis to much larger samples. we visually classify thegalaxies into three bulge classes (bc) by the shape of the light profile in theouter regions: discs have sharp edges and bulges do not, while some galaxiesare intermediate. we separately identify galaxies with features: spiral arms,bars, clumps, rings, and dust. we find general agreement between bc and thebulge fraction b/t measured by the galaxy modeling package gim2d, but manyvisual discs have b/t&gt;0.5. three additional automated parameters -- smoothness,axis ratio, and concentration -- can identify many of these high-b/t discs toyield automated classifications that agree ~70% with the visual classifications(&gt;90% within one bc). both methods are used to study the bulge vs. discfrequency as a function of four measures of galaxy 'size': luminosity, stellarmass, velocity dispersion, and radius. all size indicators show a fall in discfraction and a rise in bulge fraction among larger galaxies.

1010.5778	galaxy pairs in the sloan digital sky survey - iii: evidence of induced  star formation from optical colours	we have assembled a large, high quality catalogue of galaxy colours from thesloan digital sky survey data release 7, and have identified 21,347 galaxies inpairs spanning a range of projected separations (r_p &lt; 80 h_{70}^{-1} kpc),relative velocities (\delta v &lt; 10,000 km/s, which includes projected pairsthat are essential for quality control), and stellar mass ratios (from 1:10 to10:1). we find that the red fraction of galaxies in pairs is higher than thatof a control sample matched in stellar mass and redshift, and demonstrate thatthis difference is likely due to the fact that galaxy pairs reside in higherdensity environments than non-paired galaxies. we detect clear signs ofinteraction-induced star formation within the blue galaxies in pairs, asevidenced by a higher fraction of extremely blue galaxies, along with bluewardoffsets between the colours of paired versus control galaxies. these signs arestrongest in close pairs (r_p &lt; 30 h_{70}^{-1} kpc and \delta v &lt; 200 km/s),diminish for more widely separated pairs (r_p &gt; 60 h_{70}^{-1} kpc and \delta v&lt; 200 km/s) and disappear for close projected pairs (r_p &lt; 30 h_{70}^{-1} kpcand \delta v &gt; 3000 km/s). these effects are also stronger in central (fibre)colours than in global colours, and are found primarily in low- tomedium-density environments. conversely, no such trends are seen in redgalaxies, apart from a small reddening at small separations which may resultfrom residual errors with photometry in crowded fields. when interpreted inconjunction with a simple model of induced starbursts, these results areconsistent with a scenario in which close peri-centre passages trigger inducedstar formation in the centres of galaxies which are sufficiently gas rich,after which time the galaxies gradually redden as they separate and theirstarbursts age.

1012.2235	the evolution of early-type galaxies in clusters from z~ 0.8 to z~ 0:  the ellipticity distribution and the morphological mix	we present the ellipticity distribution and its evolution for early-typegalaxies in clusters from z~0.8 to z~0, based on the wide-field nearbygalaxy-cluster survey (wings)(0.04&lt;z&lt;0.07), and the eso distant cluster survey(ediscs)(0.4&lt;z&lt;0.8). we first investigate a mass limited sample and we findthat, above a fixed mass limit, the ellipticity distribution of early-typesnoticeably evolves with redshift. in the local universe there areproportionally more galaxies with higher ellipticity, hence flatter, than indistant clusters. this evolution is due partly to the change of the massdistribution and mainly to the change of the morphological mix with z (amongthe early types, the fraction of ellipticals goes from ~70% at high to ~40% atlow-z). analyzing separately the ellipticity distribution of the differentmorphological types, we find no evolution both for ellipticals and s0s.however, for ellipticals a change with redshift in the median value of thedistributions is detected. this is due to a larger population of very round(e&lt;0.05) elliptical galaxies at low-z. to compare our finding to previousstudies, we also assemble a magnitude-"delimited" sample that consists ofearly-type galaxies on the red sequence with -19.3&gt;m_b+1.208z&gt;-21. analyzingthis sample, we do not recover exactly the same results of the mass-limitedsample. hence the selection criteria are crucial to characterize the galaxyproperties: the choice of the magnitude-delimited sample implies the loss ofmany less massive galaxies and so it biases the final results. moreover,although we are adopting the same selection criteria, our results in themagnitude-delimited sample are also not in agreement with those of holden etal.(2009). this is due to the fact that our and their low-z samples have adifferent magnitude distribution because the holden et al.(2009) sample suffersfrom incompleteness at faint magnitudes.

1012.5859	dark halo response and the stellar initial mass function in early-type  and late-type galaxies	we investigate the origin of the relations between stellar mass and opticalcircular velocity for early-type (etg) and late-type (ltg) galaxies --- thefaber-jackson (fj) and tully-fisher (tf) relations. we combine measurements ofdark halo masses (from satellite kinematics and weak lensing), and thedistribution of baryons in galaxies (from a new compilation of galaxy scalingrelations), with constraints on dark halo structure from cosmologicalsimulations. the principle unknowns are the halo response to galaxy formationand the stellar initial mass function (imf). the slopes of the tf and fjrelations are naturally reproduced for a wide range of halo response and imfs.however, models with a universal imf and universal halo response cannotsimultaneously reproduce the zero points of both the tf and fj relations. for amodel with a universal chabrier imf, ltgs require halo expansion, while etgsrequire halo contraction. a salpeter imf is permitted for high mass (sigma &gt;180 km/s) etgs, but is inconsistent for intermediate masses, unlessv_circ(r_e)/sigma_e &gt; 1.6. if the imf is universal and close to chabrier, wespeculate that the presence of a major merger may be responsible for thecontraction in etgs while clumpy accreting streams and/or feedback leads toexpansion in ltgs. alternatively, a recently proposed variation in the imfdisfavors halo contraction in both types of galaxies. finally we show that ourmodels naturally reproduce flat and featureless circular velocity profileswithin the optical regions of galaxies without fine-tuning.

1101.3566	gas flows in galaxies: the relative importance of mergers and bars	galaxy-galaxy interactions and large scale galaxy bars are usually consideredas the two main mechanisms for driving gas to the centres of galaxies. by usinglarge samples of galaxy pairs and visually classified bars from the sloandigital sky survey (sdss), we compare the relative efficiency of gas inflowsfrom these two processes. we use two indicators of gas inflow: star formationrate (sfr) and gas phase metallicity, which are both measured relative tocontrol samples. whereas the metallicity of galaxy pairs is suppressed relativeto its control sample of isolated galaxies, galaxies with bars are metal-richfor their stellar mass by 0.06 dex over all stellar masses. the sfrs of boththe close galaxy pairs and the barred galaxies are enhanced by ~60%, but in thebars the enhancement is only seen at stellar masses m* &gt;10^10 m_solar. takinginto account the relative frequency of bars and pairs, we estimate that atleast three times more central star formation is triggered by bars than byinteractions.

1105.3754	candels: the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacy  survey - the hubble space telescope observations, imaging data products and  mosaics	this paper describes the hubble space telescope imaging data products anddata reduction procedures for the cosmic assembly near-ir deep extragalacticlegacy survey (candels). this survey is designed to document the evolution ofgalaxies and black holes at $z\sim1.5-8$, and to study type ia sne beyond$z&gt;1.5$. five premier multi-wavelength sky regions are selected, each withextensive multiwavelength observations. the primary candels data consist ofimaging obtained in the wide field camera 3 / infrared channel (wfc3/ir) anduvis channel, along with the advanced camera for surveys (acs). thecandels/deep survey covers \sim125 square arcminutes within goods-n andgoods-s, while the remainder consists of the candels/wide survey, achieving atotal of \sim800 square arcminutes across goods and three additional fields(egs, cosmos, and uds). we summarize the observational aspects of the survey asmotivated by the scientific goals and present a detailed description of thedata reduction procedures and products from the survey. our data reductionmethods utilize the most up to date calibration files and image combinationprocedures. we have paid special attention to correcting a range ofinstrumental effects, including cte degradation for acs, removal of electronicbias-striping present in acs data after sm4, and persistence effects and otherartifacts in wfc3/ir. for each field, we release mosaics for individual epochsand eventual mosaics containing data from all epochs combined, to facilitatephotometric variability studies and the deepest possible photometry. a moredetailed overview of the science goals and observational design of the surveyare presented in a companion paper.

1106.1177	the impact of gas inflows on star formation rates and metallicities in  barred galaxies	the star formation rates (sfrs) and metallicities of a sample of 294 galaxieswith visually classified, strong, large-scale bars are compared to a controlsample of unbarred disk galaxies selected from the sloan digital sky surveydata release 4. the fibre (inner few kpc) metallicities of barred galaxies areuniformly higher (at a given mass) than the unbarred sample by ~0.06 dex.however, the fibre sfrs of the visually classified barred galaxies are higherby about 60% only in the galaxies with total stellar mass log m &gt; 10. the metalenhancement at log m&lt;10 without an accompanying increase in the sfr may be dueto a short-lived phase of early bar-triggered star formation in the past,compared to on-going star formation rate enhancements in higher mass barredgalaxies. there is no correlation between bar length or bar axial ratio withthe enhancement of the star formation rate. in order to assess the relativeimportance of star formation triggered by bars and galaxy-galaxy interactions,sfrs are also determined for a sample of close galaxy pairs. both mechanismsappear to be similarly effective at triggering central star formation forgalaxies with log m&gt;10. however, due to the much lower fraction of pairs thanbars, bars account for ~3.5 times more triggered central star formation thaninteractions.

1106.1184	compact groups in theory and practice -- iv. the connection to  large-scale structure	we investigate the properties of photometrically-selected compact groups(cgs) in the sloan digital sky survey. in this paper, the fourth in a series,we focus on understanding the characteristics of our observed cg sample withparticular attention paid to quantifying and removing contamination fromprojected foreground or background galaxies. based on a simple comparison ofpairwise redshift likelihoods, we find that approximately half of compactgroups in the parent sample contain one or more projected (interloping)members; our final clean sample contains 4566 galaxies in 1086 compact groups.we show that half of the remaining cgs are associated with rich groups (orclusters), i.e. they are embedded sub-structure. the other half have spatialdistributions and number-density profiles consistent with the interpretationthat they are either independently distributed structures within the field(i.e. they are isolated) or associated with relatively poor structures.comparisons of late-type and red-sequence fractions in radial annuli show thatgalaxies around apparently isolated compact groups resemble the fieldpopulation by 300 to 500 kpc from the group centre. in contrast, the galaxypopulation surrounding embedded compact groups appears to remain distinct fromthe field out beyond 1 to 2 mpc, consistent with results for rich groups. wetake this as additional evidence that the observed distinction between compactgroups, i.e. isolated vs. embedded, is a separation between different hostenvironments.

1111.2135	clustering properties of bzk-selected galaxies in goods-n: environmental  quenching and triggering of star formation at z ~ 2	using a sample of bzk-selected galaxies at z~2 identified from thecfht/wircam near-infrared survey of goods-north, we discuss the relationbetween star formation rate (sfr), specific star formation rate (ssfr), andstellar mass (m_{*}), and the clustering of galaxies as a function of theseparameters. for star-forming galaxies (sbzks), the uv-based sfr, corrected forextinction, scales with the stellar mass as sfr ~ m_{*}^{alpha} with alpha =0.74+/-0.20 down to m_{*} ~ 10^{9} m_{solar}, indicating a weak dependence onthe stellar mass of the ssfr. we also measure the angular correlation functionand hence infer the correlation length for sbzk galaxies as a function ofm_{*}, sfr, and ssfr, as well as k-band apparent magnitude. we show thatpassive galaxies (pbzks) are more strongly clustered than sbzk galaxies at agiven stellar mass, mirroring the color-density relation seen at lowerredshifts. we also find that the correlation length of sbzk galaxies rangesfrom 4 to 20 h^{-1}mpc, being a strong function of m_{k}, m_{*}, and sfr. onthe other hand, the clustering dependence on ssfr changes abruptly at 2x10^{-9}yr^{-1}, which is the typical value for "main sequence" star-forming galaxiesat z~2. we show that the correlation length reaches a minimum at thischaracteristic value, and is larger for galaxies with both smaller and largerssfrs; a dichotomy that is only marginally implied from the predictions of thesemi-analytical models. our results suggest that there are two types ofenvironmental effects at work at z~2. stronger clustering for relativelyquiescent galaxies implies that the environment has started to play a role inquenching star formation. at the same time, stronger clustering for galaxieswith elevated ssfrs ("starbursts") might be attributed to an increasedefficiency for galaxy interactions and mergers in dense environments.

1111.2905	evidence for a non-universal stellar initial mass function in  low-redshift high-density early-type galaxies	we determine an absolute calibration of stellar mass-to-light ratios for thedensest \simeq 3% of early-type galaxies in the local universe (redshiftz\simeq 0.08) from sdss dr7. this sample of \sim 4000 galaxies has, assuming achabrier imf, effective stellar surface densities, sigma_e &gt; 2500 m_sun/pc^2,stellar population synthesis (sps) stellar masses log_10(m_sps/m_sun)&lt;10.8, andaperture velocity dispersions of sigma_ap=168^{+37}_{-34} km/s (68% range). incontrast to typical early-type galaxies, we show that these dense early-typegalaxies follow the virial fundamental plane, which suggests thatmass-follows-light. with the additional assumption that any dark matter doesnot follow the light, the dynamical masses of dense galaxies provide a directmeasurement of stellar masses. our dynamical masses (m_dyn), obtained from thespherical jeans equations, are only weakly sensitive to the choice ofanisotropy (\beta) due to the relatively large aperture of the sdss fiber forthese galaxies: r_ap \simeq 1.5 r_e. assuming isotropic orbits (\beta=0) wefind a median log_{10} (m_dyn/m_sps) = 0.233 \pm 0.003, consistent with asalpeter imf, while more bottom heavy imfs and standard milky-way imfs arestrongly disfavored. our results are consistent with, but do not require, adependence of the imf on dynamical mass or velocity dispersion. we findevidence for a color dependence to the imf such that redder galaxies haveheavier imfs with m_dyn/m_sps \propto (g-r)^{1.13\pm0.09}. this may reflect amore fundamental dependence of the imf on the age or metallicity of a stellarpopulation, or the density at which the stars formed.

1204.2825	universal imf vs dark halo response in early-type galaxies: breaking the  degeneracy with the fundamental plane	we use the relations between aperture stellar velocity dispersion(\sigma_ap), stellar mass (m_sps), and galaxy size (r_e) for a sample of \sim150,000 early-type galaxies from sdss/dr7 to place constraints on the stellarinitial mass function (imf) and dark halo response to galaxy formation. webuild lcdm based mass models that reproduce, by construction, the relationsbetween galaxy size, light concentration and stellar mass, and use thespherical jeans equations to predict \sigma_ap. given our model assumptions(including those in the stellar population synthesis models), we find thatreproducing the median \sigma_ap vs m_sps relation is not possible with {\itboth} a universal imf and a universal dark halo response. significantdepartures from a universal imf and/or dark halo response are required, butthere is a degeneracy between these two solutions. we show that this degeneracycan be broken using the strength of the correlation between residuals of thevelocity-mass (\delta log \sigma_ap) and size-mass (\delta log r_e) relations.the slope of this correlation, d_vr \equiv \delta log \sigma_ap/\delta log r_e,varies systematically with galaxy mass from d_vr \simeq -0.45 at m_sps \sim10^{10}m_sun, to d_vr \simeq -0.15 at m_sps \sim 10^{11.6} m_sun. the virialfundamental plane (fp) has d_vr=-1/2, and thus we find the tilt of the observedfp is mass dependent. reproducing this tilt requires {\it both} a non-universalimf and a non-universal halo response. our best model has mass-follows-light atlow masses (msps &lt; 10^{11.2}m_sun) and unmodified nfw haloes at m_sps \sim10^{11.5} m_sun. the stellar masses imply a mass dependent imf which is"lighter" than salpeter at low masses and "heavier" than salpeter at highmasses.

1210.4173	the dependence of quenching upon the inner structure of galaxies at  0.5&lt;z&lt; 0.8 in the deep2/aegis survey	the shutdown of star formation in galaxies is generally termed `quenching'.although quenching may occur through a variety of processes, the exactmechanism(s) that is in fact responsible for quenching is still in question.this paper addresses quenching by searching for traces of possible quenchingprocesses through their effects on galaxy structural parameters such as surfacestellar mass density and sersic index (n). we analyze the rest-frame u-b colorcorrelations versus these structural parameters using a sample of galaxies inthe redshift range 0.5&lt; z&lt;0.8 from the deep2/aegis survey. we find that sersicindex (n) has the smallest overlap region among all tested parameters andresembles a step-function with a threshold value of n=2.3. there exists,however, a significant population of outliers with blue colors yet high nvalues that seem to contradict this behavior. we hypothesize that their sersicvalues may be distorted by bursts of star formation, agns, and/or poor fits,leading us to consider central surface stellar mass density as an alternativeto sersic index. not only does it correct the outliers, it also forms a tightrelationship with color, suggesting that the innermost structure of galaxies ismost physically linked with quenching. furthermore, at z~0.65, the majority ofthe blue cloud galaxies cannot simply fade onto the red sequence since theirgim2d bulge masses are only half as large on average as the bulge masses ofsimilar red sequence galaxies, thus demonstrating that stellar mass mustabsolutely increase at the centers of galaxies as they quench. we discuss atwo-stage model for quenching in which galaxy star formation rates arecontrolled by their dark halos while they are still in the blue cloud and asecond quenching process sets in later, associated with the central stellarmass build-up.

1211.6115	towards a physical picture of star-formation quenching: the photometric  properties of recently-quenched galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey	we select a sample of young passive galaxies from the sloan digital skysurvey data release 7 in order to study the processes that quench starformation in the local universe. quenched galaxies are identified based on thecontribution of a-type stars to their observed (central) spectra and relativelack of ongoing star formation; we find that such systems account for roughly2.5 per cent of all galaxies with log m_sun &gt;= 9.5, and have a space density of~2.2x10^-4 mpc^-3. we show that quenched galaxies span a range of morphologies,but that visual classifications suggest they are predominantly early-typesystems. their visual early-type classification is supported by quantitativestructural measurements sersic indices that show a notable lack ofdisk-dominated galaxies, suggesting that any morphological transformationassociated with galaxies' transition from star-forming to passive--e.g. theformation of a stellar bulge--occurs contemporaneously with the decline oftheir star-formation activity. we show that there is no clear excess of opticalagn in quenched galaxies, suggesting that: i) agn feedback is not associatedwith the majority of quenched systems or ii) that the observability of quenchedgalaxies is such that the quenching phase in general outlives any associatednuclear activity. comparison with classical post-starburst galaxies shows thatboth populations show similar signatures of bulge growth, and we suggest thatthe defining characteristic of post-starburst galaxies is the efficiency oftheir bulge growth rather than a particular formation mechanism.

1310.8304	a catalog of bulge, disk, and total stellar mass estimates for the sloan  digital sky survey	we present a catalog of bulge, disk, and total stellar mass estimates for~660,000 galaxies in the legacy area of the sloan digital sky survey datarelease 7. these masses are based on a homogeneous catalog of g- and r-bandphotometry described by simard et al. (2011), which we extend here withbulge+disk and sersic profile photometric decompositions in the sdss u, i, andz bands. we discuss the methodology used to derive stellar masses from thesedata via fitting to broadband spectral energy distributions (seds), and showthat the typical statistical uncertainty on total, bulge, and disk stellar massis ~0.15 dex. despite relatively small formal uncertainties, we argue that sedmodeling assumptions, including the choice of synthesis model, extinction law,initial mass function, and details of stellar evolution likely contribute anadditional 60% systematic uncertainty in any mass estimate based on broadbandsed fitting. we discuss several approaches for identifying genuine bulge+disksystems based on both their statistical likelihood and an analysis of theirone-dimensional surface-brightness profiles, and include these metrics in thecatalogs. estimates of the total, bulge and disk stellar masses for both normaland dust-free models and their uncertainties are made publicly available here.

1401.7988	prospects for measuring supermassive black hole masses with future  extremely large telescopes	the next generation of giant-segmented mirror telescopes ($&gt;$ 20 m) willenable us to observe galactic nuclei at much higher angular resolution andsensitivity than ever before. these capabilities will introduce a revolutionaryshift in our understanding of the origin and evolution of supermassive blackholes by enabling more precise black hole mass measurements in a mass rangethat is unreachable today. we present simulations and predictions of theobservations of nuclei that will be made with the thirty meter telescope (tmt)and the adaptive optics assisted integral-field spectrograph iris, which iscapable of diffraction-limited spectroscopy from $z$ band (0.9 $\mu$m) to $k$band (2.2 $\mu$m). these simulations, for the first time, use realistic valuesfor the sky, telescope, adaptive optics system, and instrument, to determinethe expected signal-to-noise ratio of a range of possible targets spanningintermediate mass black holes of $\sim10^4$ \msun to the most massive blackholes known today of $&gt;10^{10}$ $m_\odot$. we find that iris will be able toobserve milky way-mass black holes out the distance of the virgo cluster, andwill allow us to observe many more brightest cluster galaxies where the mostmassive black holes are thought to reside. we also evaluate how well thekinematic moments of the velocity distributions can be constrained at thedifferent spectral resolutions and plate scales designed for iris. we find thata spectral resolution of $\sim8000$ will be necessary to measure the masses ofintermediate mass black holes. by simulating the observations of galaxies foundin sdss dr7, we find that over $10^5$ massive black holes will be observable atdistances between $0.005 &lt; z &lt; 0.18$ with the estimated sensitivity and angularresolution provided by access to $z$-band (0.9 $\mu$m) spectroscopy from irisand the tmt adaptive optics system.

1402.5082	the signature of dissipation in the mass-size relation: are bulges  simply spheroids wrapped in a disc?	the relation between the stellar mass and size of a galaxy's structuralsubcomponents, such as discs and spheroids, is a powerful way to understand theprocesses involved in their formation. using very large catalogues ofphotometric bulge+disc structural decompositions and stellar masses from thesloan digital sky survey data release seven, we carefully define two largesubsamples of spheroids in a quantitative manner such that both samples sharesimilar characteristics with one important exception: the 'bulges' are embeddedin a disc and the 'pure spheroids' are galaxies with a single structuralcomponent. our bulge and pure spheroid subsample sizes are 76,012 and 171,243respectively. above a stellar mass of ~$10^{10}$ m$_{\odot}$, the mass-sizerelations of both subsamples are parallel to one another and are close to linesof constant surface mass density. however, the relations are offset by a factorof 1.4, which may be explained by the dominance of dissipation in theirformation processes. whereas the size-mass relation of bulges in discs isconsistent with gas-rich mergers, pure spheroids appear to have been formed viaa combination of 'dry' and 'wet' mergers.

1403.5269	bulge mass is king: the dominant role of the bulge in determining the  fraction of passive galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey	we investigate the origin of galaxy bimodality by quantifying the relativerole of intrinsic and environmental drivers to the cessation (or `quenching')of star formation in over half a million local sloan digital sky survey (sdss)galaxies. our sample contains a wide variety of galaxies at z=0.02-0.2, withstellar masses of 8 &lt; log(m*/m_sun) &lt; 12, spanning the entire morphologicalrange from pure disks to spheroids, and over four orders of magnitude in localgalaxy density and halo mass. we utilise published star formation rates and addto this recent gim2d photometric and stellar mass bulge + disk decompositionsfrom our group. we find that the passive fraction of galaxies increases steeplywith stellar mass, halo mass, and bulge mass, with a less steep dependence onlocal galaxy density and bulge-to-total stellar mass ratio (b/t). at fixedinternal properties, we find that central and satellite galaxies have differentpassive fraction relationships. for centrals, we conclude that there is lessvariation in the passive fraction at a fixed bulge mass, than for any othervariable, including total stellar mass, halo mass, and b/t. this implies thatthe quenching mechanism must be most tightly coupled to the bulge. we arguethat radio-mode agn feedback offers the most plausible explanation of theobserved trends.

0803.0161	galaxy pairs in the sloan digital sky survey i: star formation, agn  fraction, and the luminosity/mass-metallicity relation	(abridged). we present a sample of 1716 galaxies with companions within deltav &lt; 500 km/s, r_p &lt; 80 kpc and stellar mass ratio 0.1 &lt; m_1/m_2 &lt; 10 from thesloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release 4 (dr4). in agreement withprevious studies, we find an enhancement in the star formation rate (sfr) ofgalaxy pairs at projected separations &lt; 30--40 kpc. in addition, we find thatthis enhancement is highest (and extends to the greatest separations) forgalaxies of approximately equal mass, the so-called `major' pairs. however, sfrenhancement can still be detected for a sample of galaxy pairs whose masses arewithin a factor of 10 of each other. in agreement with the one previous studyof the luminosity-metallicity (lz) relation in paired galaxies, we find anoffset to lower metallicities (by ~ 0.1 dex) for a given luminosity forgalaxies in pairs compared to the control sample. we also present the firstmass-metallicity (mz) relation comparison between paired galaxies and thefield, and again find an offset to lower metallicities (by ~ 0.05 dex) for agiven mass. the smaller offset in the mz relation indicates that both higherluminosities and lower metallicities may contribute to the shift of pairsrelative to the control in the lz relation. we show that the offset in the lzrelation depends on galaxy half light radius, r_h. galaxies with r_h &lt; 3 kpcand with a close companion show a 0.05-0.1 dex downwards offset in metallicitycompared to control galaxies of the same size. finally, we study the agnfraction in both the pair and control sample and find that whilst selectinggalaxies in different cuts of color and asymmetry yields different agnfractions, the fraction for pairs and the control sample are consistent for agiven set of selection criteria.

1407.2997	the infrared imaging spectrograph (iris) for tmt: volume phase  holographic grating performance testing and discussion	maximizing the grating efficiency is a key goal for the first lightinstrument iris (infrared imaging spectrograph) currently being designed tosample the diffraction limit of the tmt (thirty meter telescope). volume phaseholographic (vph) gratings have been shown to offer extremely high efficienciesthat approach 100% for high line frequencies (i.e., 600 to 6000l/mm), which hasbeen applicable for astronomical optical spectrographs. however, vph gratingshave been less exploited in the near-infrared, particularly for gratings thathave lower line frequencies. given their potential to offer high throughputsand low scattered light, vph gratings are being explored for iris as apotential dispersing element in the spectrograph. our team has procurednear-infrared gratings from two separate vendors. we have two gratings with thespecifications needed for iris current design: 1.51-1.82{\mu}m (h-band) toproduce a spectral resolution of 4000 and 1.19- 1.37 {\mu}m (j-band) to producea spectral resolution of 8000. the center wavelengths for each grating are1.629{\mu}m and 1.27{\mu}m, and the groove densities are 177l/mm and 440l/mmfor h-band r=4000 and j-band r=8000, respectively. we directly measure theefficiencies in the lab and find that the peak efficiencies of these two typesof gratings are quite good with a peak efficiency of ~88% at the bragg angle inboth tm and te modes at h-band, and 90.23% in tm mode, 79.91% in te mode atj-band for the best vendor. we determine the drop in efficiency off the braggangle, with a 20-23% decrease in efficiency at h-band when 2.5 degree deviationfrom the bragg angle, and 25%-28% decrease at j-band when 5{\deg} deviationfrom the bragg angle.

1411.6736	evidence for (and against) progenitor bias in the size growth of compact  red galaxies	most massive passive galaxies are compact at high redshifts, but similarlycompact massive galaxies are rare in the local universe. the most commoninterpretation of this phenomenon is that massive galaxies have grown in sizeby a factor of about five since redshift z=2. an alternative explanation isthat recently quenched massive galaxies are larger (a "progenitor bias"). inthis paper we explore the importance of progenitor bias by looking forsystematic differences in the stellar populations of compact early-typegalaxies in the deep2 survey as a function of size. our analysis is based onapplying the statistical technique of bootstrap resampling to constraindifferences in the median ages of our samples and to begin to characterize thedistribution of stellar populations in our co-added spectra. the light-weightedages of compact early-type galaxies at redshifts 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.4 are compared tothose of a control sample of larger galaxies at similar redshifts. we find thatmassive compact early-type galaxies selected on the basis of red color and highbulge-to-total ratio are younger than similarly selected larger galaxies,suggesting that size growth in these objects is not driven mainly by progenitorbias, and that individual galaxies grow as their stellar populations age.however, compact early-type galaxies selected on the basis of image smoothnessand high bulge-to-total ratio are older than a control sample of largergalaxies. progenitor bias will play a significant role in defining the apparentsize changes of early-type galaxies if they are selected on the basis of thesmoothness of their light distributions.

1412.3862	why do galaxies stop forming stars? i. the passive fraction - black hole  mass relation for central galaxies	we derive the dependence of the fraction of passive central galaxies on themass of their supermassive black holes for a sample of over 400,000 sdssgalaxies at z &lt; 0.2. our large sample contains galaxies in a wide range ofenvironments, with stellar masses 8 &lt; log(m*/msun) &lt; 12, spanning the entiremorphological spectrum from pure disks to spheroids. we derive estimates forthe black hole masses from measured central velocity dispersions and bulgemasses, using a variety of published empirical relationships. we find a verystrong dependence of the passive fraction on black hole mass, which is largelyunaffected by the details of the black hole mass estimate. moreover, thepassive fraction relationship with black hole mass remains strong and tighteven at fixed values of galaxy stellar mass (m*), dark matter halo mass(mhalo), and bulge-to-total stellar mass ratio (b/t). whereas, the passivefraction dependence on m*, mhalo and b/t is weak at fixed mbh. theseobservations show that, for central galaxies, mbh is the strongest correlatorwith the passive fraction, consistent with quenching from agn feedback.

1501.03114	the neutral gas content of post-merger galaxies	measurements of the neutral hydrogen gas content of a sample of 93post-merger galaxies are presented, from a combination of matches to thealfalfa.40 data release and new arecibo observations. by imposing completenessthresholds identical to that of the alfalfa survey, and by compiling a mass-,redshift- and environment-matched control sample from the public alfalfa.40data release, we calculate gas fraction offsets (delta f_gas) for thepost-mergers, relative to the control sample. we find that the post-mergershave hi gas fractions that are consistent with undisturbed galaxies. however,due to the relative gas richness of the alfalfa.40 sample, from which we drawour control sample, our measurements of gas fraction enhancements are likely tobe conservative lower limits. combined with comparable gas fractionmeasurements by fertig et al. in a sample of galaxy pairs, who also determinegas fraction offsets consistent with zero, we conclude that there is noevidence for significant neutral gas consumption throughout the mergersequence. from a suite of 75 binary merger simulations we confirm that starformation is expected to decrease the post-merger gas fraction by only 0.06dex, even several gyr after the merger. moreover, in addition to the lack ofevidence for gas consumption from gas fraction offsets, the observed hidetection fraction in the complete sample of post-mergers is twice as high asthe controls, which suggests that the post-merger gas fractions may actually beenhanced. we demonstrate that a gas fraction enhancement in post-mergers,relative to a stellar mass-matched control sample, would indeed be the naturalresult of merging randomly drawn pairs from a parent population which exhibitsa declining gas fraction with increasing stellar mass.

0805.0001	the size function of galaxy disks out to z ~ 1 from the  canada-france-hawaii-telescope legacy survey	the formation and growth of galaxy disks over cosmic time is crucial to ourunderstanding of galaxy formation. despite steady improvements in the size andquality of disk samples over the last decade, many aspects of galaxy diskevolution remain unclear. using two square degrees of deep, wide-field i'-bandimaging from the canada-france-hawaii telescope legacy survey, we compute sizefunctions for 6000 disks from z=0.2 to z=1 and explore luminosity and numberdensity evolution scenarios with an emphasis on the importance of selectioneffects on the interpretation of the data. we also compute the size function ofa very large sample of disks from the sloan digital sky survey to use as alocal (z ~ 0.1) comparison. cfhtls size functions computed with the same fixedluminosity-size selection window at all redshifts exhibit evolution thatappears to be best modelled by a pure number density evolution. the z = 0.3size function is an excellent match to the z = 0.9 one if disks at the highestredshift are a factor of 2.5 more abundant than in the local universe. the sdsssize function would also match the z = 0.9 cfhtls size function very well witha similar change in number density. on the other hand, the cfhtls sizefunctions computed with a varying luminosity-size selection window withredshift remain constant if the selection window is shifted by 1.0$-$1.5 magtowards fainter magnitudes with decreasing redshift. there is a weak dependenceon disk scale length with smaller ($h \lesssim $ 4 kpc) disks requiring moreluminosity evolution than larger ones. given that changes in number density areprimarily due to mergers and that current estimates of merger rates below z = 1are low, luminosity evolution appears to be a more plausible scenario toexplain the observations.

0805.1145	the relation between star formation, morphology and local density in  high redshift clusters and groups	we investigate how the [oii] properties and the morphologies of galaxies inclusters and groups at z=0.4-0.8 depend on projected local galaxy density, andcompare with the field at similar redshifts and clusters at low-z. in bothnearby and distant clusters, higher-density regions contain proportionallyfewer star-forming galaxies, and the average [oii] equivalent width ofstar-forming galaxies is independent of local density. however, in distantclusters the average current star formation rate (sfr) in star-forming galaxiesseems to peak at densities ~15-40 galaxies mpc^{-2}. at odds with low-zresults, at high-z the relation between star-forming fraction and local densityvaries from high- to low-mass clusters. overall, our results suggest that athigh-z the current star formation (sf) activity in star-forming galaxies doesnot depend strongly on global or local environment, though the possible sfrpeak seems at odds with this conclusion. we find that the cluster sfrnormalized by cluster mass anticorrelates with mass and correlates with thestar-forming fraction. these trends can be understood given a) that the averagestar-forming galaxy forms about 1 msun/yr in all clusters; b) that the totalnumber of galaxies scales with cluster mass and c) the dependence ofstar-forming fraction on cluster mass. we present the morphology-density (md)relation for our z=0.4-0.8 clusters, and uncover that the decline of the spiralfraction with density is entirely driven by galaxies of types sc or later. forgalaxies of a given hubble type, we see no evidence that sf properties dependon local environment. in contrast with recent findings at low-z, in our distantclusters the sf-density relation and the md-relation are equivalent, suggestingthat neither of the two is more fundamental than the other.(abr.)

astro-ph;0010278	the galaxy populations of x-ray detected, poor groups	(abridged) we determine the quantitative morphology and star formationproperties of galaxies in six nearby x-ray detected, poor groups usingmulti-object spectroscopy and wide-field r imaging. we measure structuralparameters for each galaxy by fitting a psf-convolved, two component model totheir surface brightness profiles. to compare directly the samples, we fade,smooth, and rebin each galaxy image so that we effectively observe each galaxyat the same redshift (9000 km/s) and physical resolution (0.87h^(-1) kpc). wecompare results for the groups to a sample of field galaxies. we find that: 1)galaxies spanning a wide range in morphological type and luminosity arewell-fit by a de vaucouleurs bulge with exponential disk profile. 2)morphologically classifying these nearby group galaxies by their bulge fraction(b/t) is fairly robust on average, even when their redshift has increased by upto a factor of four and the effective resolution of the images is degraded byup to a factor of five. 3) the fraction of bulge-dominated systems in thesegroups is higher than in the field (~50% vs. ~20%). 4) the fraction ofbulge-dominated systems in groups decreases with increasing radius, similar tothe morphology-radius (~density) relation observed in galaxy clusters. 5)current star formation in group galaxies is correlated with significantmorphological asymmetry for disk-dominated systems (b/t&lt;0.4). 6) the groupgalaxies that are most disk-dominated (b/t&lt;0.2) are less star forming andasymmetric on average than their counterparts in the field.

astro-ph;0105389	are there blue, massive e/s0s at z &lt; 1 ?: kinematics of blue spheroidal  galaxy candidates	several recent studies find that 10 - 50% of morphologically selected fieldearly-type galaxies at redshifts z &lt;= 1 have blue colors indicative of recentstar formation. such ``blue spheroids''might be massive early-type galaxieswith active star formation, perhaps induced by recent merger events.  alternatively, they could be starbursting, low-mass spheroids. to distinguishbetween these two choices, we have selected 10 ``blue spheroid candidates''  (hereafter, bscs) from a quantitatively selected e/s0 sample and studiedtheir properties, including kinematics from keck spectra obtained as part ofthe deep groth strip survey (gss). most bscs (70%) turn out to belong to twobroad categories, while the remaining objects are likely to be misclassifiedobjects. type-1 bscs have underlying red stellar components with bluer innercomponents. type-2 bscs do not show an obvious sign of the underlying redstellar component, and their overall colors are quite blue ((u-b)_rest &lt; 0).  both type-1 and type-2 bscs have internal velocity dispersions measured fromemission lines sigma &lt; 80$ km/sec and estimated dynamical masses of only a fewtimes 10^10 m_sun or less. for type-1 bscs, we estimate sigma of the redcomponent using the fundamental plane relation of distant field absorption-linegalaxies and find that these sigma estimates are similar to the sigma measuredfrom emission lines. overall, we conclude that our type-1 and type-2 bscs aremore likely to be star-forming low mass spheroids than star-forming, massive,early-type galaxies.

astro-ph;0108152	brightest cluster galaxies and the las campanas distant cluster survey	we present our study of the evolution of brightest cluster galaxies based ondata from the las campanas distant cluster survey (gonzalez et al. 2001) andhst optical and ir imaging. we briefly discuss the technique that enabled us touse short (~ 3 min) exposures and a small (1m) telescope to efficiently surveyabout 130 sq. deg. of sky for high-z galaxy clusters. follow-up imaging is usedto construct a sample of several tens of bcgs at 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 0.9 with which toexplore their evolution. in particular, we examine the luminosity and colorevolution of these galaxies. we confirm the previous results that 1) bcgs indifferent environments evolve differently (eg. burke et al 2000), 2) bcgs,particularly those in low-mass clusters, must be accreting significantly sincez ~ 1 (aragon-salamanca et al. 1998). from measurments of the colors vs.redshift, we conclude that this accretion must consist of old stellarpopulations. using hst nicmos and wfpc2 images, we find preliminary evidencefor evolution in the sizes of bcgs that is consistent with the accretion modelpresented in standard hierarchical models (aragon-salamanca et al. 1998), butpuzzling differences between nicmos and wfpc2 scale lengths precludes adefinitive conclusion.

astro-ph;0110582	constraints on the size evolution of brightest cluster galaxies	we measure the luminosity profiles of 16 brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) at$0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.8$ using high resolution f160w nicmos and f814w wfpc2 hst imaging.the heterogeneous sample is drawn from a variety of surveys: seven fromclusters in the einstein medium sensitivity survey, five from the las campanasdistant cluster survey and its northern hemisphere precursor, and the remainingfour from traditional optical surveys. we find that the surface brightnessprofiles of all but three of these bcgs are well described by a standard devaucouleurs ($r^{1/4}$) profile out to at least $\sim2r_{e}$ and that thebiweight-estimated nicmos effective radius of our high redshift bcgs ($r_{e} =8.3\pm 1.4$ kpc for $h_{0} = 80$ km s$^{-1}$ mpc$^{-1}$, $\omega_{m} = 0.2,\omega_\lambda = 0.0$) is $\sim 2$ times smaller than that measured for a localbcg sample. if high redshift bcgs are in dynamical equilibrium and satisfy thesame scaling relations as low redshift ones, this change in size wouldcorrespond to a mass growth of a factor of 2 since $z \sim 0.5$. however, thebiweight-estimated wfpc2 effective radius of our sample is 18 $\pm $ 5.1 kpc,which is fully consistent with the local sample. while we can rule out massaccretion rates higher than a factor of 2 in our sample, the discrepancybetween our nicmos and wfpc2 results, which after various tests we describeappears to be physical, does not yet allow us to place strong constraints onaccretion rates below that level.

astro-ph;0504578	halpha-derived star-formation rates for three z ~ 0.75 ediscs galaxy  clusters	we present halpha-derived star-formation rates (sfrs) for three z ~ 0.75galaxy clusters. our 1 sigma flux limit corresponds to a star-formation rate of0.10-0.24 solar mass per year, and our minimum reliable halpha + [n ii]rest-frame equivalent width is 10\aa. we show that halpha narrowband imaging isan efficient method for measuring star formation in distant clusters. in twoout of three clusters, we find that the fraction of star-forming galaxiesincreases with projected distance from the cluster center. we also find thatthe fraction of star-forming galaxies decreases with increasing local galaxysurface density in the same two clusters. we compare the median rate of starformation among star-forming cluster galaxies to a small sample of star-formingfield galaxies from the literature and find that the median cluster sfrs are\~50% less than the median field sfr. we characterize cluster evolution interms of the mass-normalized integrated cluster sfr and find that the z ~ 0.75clusters have more sfr per cluster mass on average than the z &lt;= 0.4 clustersfrom the literature. the interpretation of this result is complicated by thedependence of the mass-normalized sfr on cluster mass and the lack ofsufficient overlap in the mass ranges covered by the low and high redshiftsamples. we find that the fraction and luminosities of the brightest starburstgalaxies at z ~ 0.75 are consistent with their being progenitors of thepost-starburst galaxies at z ~ 0.45 if the post-starburst phase lasts several(~5) times longer than the starburst phase.

astro-ph;0505123	the cfht legacy survey: the morphology-density relation of galaxies out  to z~1	we study the relationships between galaxy total luminosity (m_g), morphology,color and environment as a function of redshift. we use a magnitude-limitedsample of 65,624 galaxies in the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;1.3 taken from one of thecanada-france-hawaii telescope legacy survey deep fields. we parametrize galaxymorphology according to the sersic index n. our n&gt;2 number fractions at z=0.1agree well with those based on sdss galaxies. we find that the n&gt;2 galaxynumber fraction is constant with redshift in the field. however, for overdenseenvironments this fraction is larger and increases towards lower redshifts,higher densities and higher luminosities. rest-frame color-magnitude diagramsshow that the color distribution is bimodal out to our redshift limit of z~1with a prominent red-sequence of galaxies at 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.4 and a large blue-peakdominance at 0.8&lt;z&lt;1. we use this bimodality to define a red galaxy fraction(rest-frame u-g&gt;1). for all environments, this fraction increases towards lowerredshifts and higher luminosities. the red fraction within cluster-like regionschanges 60% faster with redshift as compared to the field for m_g&lt;-19.5. using,for the first time, observations across many cluster-field interfacesdistributed over a single, large volume, we trace the large-scalemorphology-density relation and the butcher-oemler effect over a period ofalmost 8 gyr.

astro-ph;0601671	the tully-fisher relation in cluster cl0024+1654 at z=0.4	using moderate-resolution keck spectra, we have examined the velocityprofiles of 15 members of cluster cl0024+1654 at z=0.4. wfpc2 images of thecluster members have been used to determine structural parameters, includingdisk sizes, orientations, and inclinations. we compare two methods of opticalrotation curve analysis for kinematic measurements. both methods take seeing,slit size and orientation, and instrumental effects into account and yieldsimilar rotation velocity measurements. four of the galaxies in our sampleexhibit unusual kinematic signatures, such as non-circular motions. our keyresult is that the cl0024 galaxies are marginally underluminous (0.50 +/- 0.23mag), given their rotation velocities, as compared to the local tully-fisherrelation. in this analysis, we assume no slope evolution, and take into accountsystematic differences between local and distant velocity and luminositymeasurements. our result is particularly striking considering the cl0024members have very strong emission lines, and local galaxies with similar halphaequivalent widths tend to be overluminous on the tully-fisher relation. cl0024tully-fisher residuals appear to be correlated most strongly with galaxyrotation velocities, indicating a possible change in the slope of thetully-fisher relation. however, we caution that this result may be stronglyaffected by magnitude selection and by the original slope assumed for theanalysis. cl0024 residuals also depend weakly on color, emission line strengthand extent, and photometric asymmetry. in a comparison of stellar and gasmotions in two cl0024 members, we find no evidence for counter-rotating starsand gas, an expected signature of mergers.

astro-ph;0610373	the build-up of the colour-magnitude relation in galaxy clusters since  z~0.8	using galaxy clusters from the eso distant cluster survey, we study how thedistribution of galaxies along the colour-magnitude relation has evolved sincez~0.8. while red-sequence galaxies in all these clusters are well described byan old, passively evolving population, we confirm our previous finding of asignificant evolution in their luminosity distribution as a function ofredshift. when compared to galaxy clusters in the local universe, the highredshift ediscs clusters exhibit a significant "deficit" of faint red galaxies.combining clusters in three different redshift bins, and defining as `faint'all galaxies in the range 0.4 &gt; l/l* &gt; 0.1, we find a clear decrease in theluminous-to-faint ratio of red galaxies from z~0.8 to z~0.4. the amount of sucha decrease appears to be in qualitative agreement with predictions of a modelwhere the blue bright galaxies that populate the colour-magnitude diagram ofhigh redshift clusters, have their star formation suppressed by the hostilecluster environment. although model results need to be interpreted withcaution, our findings clearly indicate that the red-sequence population ofhigh-redshift clusters does not contain all progenitors of nearby red-sequencecluster galaxies. a significant fraction of these must have moved onto thered-sequence below z~0.8.

astro-ph;9606006	internal kinematics of galaxies at z=0.25-0.45	low-mass starbursting galaxies have been proposed as the explanation of theexcess of faint galaxies observed at intermediate redshifts. if this hypothesisis correct, then intermediate redshift galaxies should rotate more slowly thannearby galaxies with the same rest-frame luminosity. we present the results ofa survey of the internal kinematics of intermediate redshift (z = 0.25-0.45)field galaxies to search for this effect. using the canada-france-hawaiitelescope, spatially-resolved spectra of the [o ii] $\lambda\lambda$ 3726- 3729\aa doublet emission line have been obtained for 22 galaxies. v$_{\rm rot} $sin i and [o ii] disk scale lengths have been extracted from each galaxyspectrum using a bayesian fitting technique.  galaxies in the sample are found to be $\sim$1.5-2.0 mag brighter thanexpected from their rotation velocity and the local tully-fisher (tf) relation.low-mass galaxies exhibit a wider range of evolution relative to the tfrelation than high-mass galaxies. the main source of uncertainty in this resultis the large scatter in the local tf relation for late-type galaxies.luminosity-dependent luminosity evolution neatly reconciles the lack ofevolution seen in other works with the results of our survey. it is also foundthat the overall properties of [oii] kinematics at intermediate redshifts arevaried. for example, 25% of the field galaxies in the sample have [oii]kinematics unrelated to rotation; [oii] emission is confined to the nucleus inmost of these galaxies. anomalous kinematics is found to be related to thepresence of companions -- i.e. minor merger events. a doppler ellipse similarto those found in local dwarf galaxies has been observed in a z = 0.35 galaxy,and may be interpreted as a supernova-driven supershell.

astro-ph;9807223	quantitative morphology of galaxies in the hubble deep field	we measure quantitative structural parameters of galaxies in the hubble deepfield (hdf) on the drizzled f814w images. our structural parameters are basedon a two-component surface brightness made up of a s\'ersic profile and anexponential profile. we compare our results to the visual classification of vanden bergh et al. (1996) and the $c-a$ classification of abraham et al. (1996a).our morphological analysis of the galaxies in the hdf indicates that thespheroidal galaxies, defined here as galaxies with a dominant bulge profile,make up for only a small fraction, namely 8% of the galaxy population down tom$_{f814w}(ab)$ = 26.0. we show that the larger fraction of early-type systemsin the van den bergh sample is primarily due to the difference inclassification of 40% of small round galaxies with half-light radii &lt;0\arcsecpoint 31. although these objects are visually classified as ellipticalgalaxies, we find that they are disk-dominated with bulge fractions &lt; 0.5.given the existing large dataset of hdf galaxies with measured spectroscopicredshifts, we are able to determine that the majority of distant galaxies($z&gt;2$) from this sample are disk-dominated. our analysis reveals a subset ofhdf galaxies which have profiles flatter than a pure exponential profile.

0811.0252	the environments of starburst and post-starburst galaxies at z=0.4-0.8	post-starburst (e+a or k+a) spectra, characterized by their exceptionallystrong balmer lines in absorption and the lack of emission lines, belong togalaxies in which the star formation activity ended abruptly sometime duringthe past gyr. we perform a spectral analysis of galaxies in clusters, groups,poor groups and the field at z=0.4-0.8 based on the eso distant cluster survey.the incidence of k+a's at these redshifts depends strongly on environment.k+a's reside preferentially in clusters and, unexpectedly, in a subset of thesigma = 200-400 km/s groups, those that have a low fraction of [oii] emitters.in these environments, 20-30% of the recently star-forming galaxies have hadtheir star formation activity recently truncated. in contrast, there areproportionally fewer k+a's in the field, the poor groups and groups with a high[oii] fraction. the incidence of k+a galaxies correlates with the clustervelocity dispersion: more massive clusters have higher proportions of k+a's.spectra of dusty starburst candidates, with strong balmer absorption andemission lines, present a very different environmental dependence from k+a's.they are numerous in all environments at z=0.4-0.8, but they are especiallynumerous in all types of groups, favoring the hypothesis of triggering by amerger. our observations are consistent with previous suggestions that clusterk+a galaxies are observed in a transition phase as massive s0 and sa galaxies,evolving from star-forming later types to passively evolving early-typegalaxies. the correlation between k+a fraction and cluster sigma supports thehypothesis that k+a galaxies in clusters originate from processes related tothe intracluster medium, while several possibilities are discussed for theorigin of the k+a frequency in low-[oii] groups.(abr.)

0706.0914	four quasars above redshift 6 discovered by the canada-france high-z  quasar survey	the canada-france high-z quasar survey (cfhqs) is an optical survey designedto locate quasars during the epoch of reionization. in this paper we presentthe discovery of the first four cfhqs quasars at redshift greater than 6,including the most distant known quasar, cfhqs j2329-0301 at z=6.43. wedescribe the observational method used to identify the quasars and presentoptical, infrared, and millimeter photometry and optical and near-infraredspectroscopy. we investigate the dust properties of these quasars finding anunusual dust extinction curve for one quasar and a high far-infrared luminositydue to dust emission for another. the mean millimeter continuum flux for cfhqsquasars is substantially lower than that for sdss quasars at the same redshift,likely due to a correlation with quasar uv luminosity. for two quasars withsufficiently high signal-to-noise optical spectra, we use the spectra toinvestigate the ionization state of hydrogen at z&gt;5. for cfhqs j1509-1749 atz=6.12, we find significant evolution (beyond a simple extrapolation of lowerredshift data) in the gunn-peterson optical depth at z&gt;5.4. the line-of-sightto this quasar has one of the highest known optical depths at z~5.8. ananalysis of the sizes of the highly-ionized near-zones in the spectra of twoquasars at z=6.12 and z=6.43 suggest the igm surrounding these quasars wassubstantially ionized before these quasars turned on. together, theseobservations point towards an extended reionization process, but we cautionthat cosmic variance is still a major limitation in z&gt;6 quasar observations.

0812.1580	compact groups in theory and practice - iii. compact groups of galaxies  in the sixth data release of the sloan digital sky survey	we present the largest publicly available catalogue of compact groups ofgalaxies identified using the original selection criteria of hickson, selectedfrom the sixth data release (dr6) of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). weidentify 2297 compact groups down to a limiting magnitude of r = 18(~0.24groups degree^{-2}), and 74791 compact groups down to a limitingmagnitude of r = 21 (~6.7groups degree^{-2}). this represents 0.9% of allgalaxies in the sdss dr6 at these magnitude levels. contamination due to grossphotometric errors has been removed from the bright sample of groups, and weestimate it is present in the large sample at the 14% level. spectroscopicinformation is available for 4131 galaxies in the bright catalogue (43%completeness), and we find that the median redshift of these groups is z_{med}= 0.09. the median line-of-sight velocity dispersion within the compact groupsfrom the bright catalogue is sigma_{los} ~ 230km/s and their typicalinter-galactic separations are of order 50 - 100kpc. we show that the fractionof groups with interloping galaxies identified as members is in good agreementwith the predictions from our previous study of a mock galaxy catalogue, and wedemonstrate how to select compact groups such that the interloper fraction iswell defined and minimized. this observational dataset is ideal for largestatistical studies of compact groups, the role of environment on galaxyevolution, and the effect of galaxy interactions in determining galaxymorphology.
