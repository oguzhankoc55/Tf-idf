0902.2310	mass outflow in the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 5548	we present a study of the intrinsic uv absorption and emission lines in anhistorically low-state spectrum of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 5548, which weobtained in 2004 february at high spatial and spectral resolution with thespace telescope imaging spectrograph (stis) on the hubble space telescope. weisolate a component of emission with a width of 680 km/s (fwhm) that arisesfrom an "intermediate line region" (ilr), similar to the one we discovered inngc 4151, at a distance of ~1 pc from the central continuum source. from adetailed analysis of the five intrinsic absorption components in ngc 5548 andtheir behavior over a span of 8 years, we present evidence that most of the uvabsorbers only partially cover the ilr and do not cover an extended region ofuv continuum emission, most likely from hot stars in the circumnuclear region.we also find that four of the uv absorbers are at much greater distances (&gt;70pc) than the ilr, and none have sufficient n v or c iv column densities to bethe ilr in absorption. at least a portion of the uv absorption component 3, ata radial velocity of -530 km/s, is likely responsible for most of the x-rayabsorption, at a distance &lt; 7 pc from the central source. the fact that we seethe ilr in absorption in ngc 4151 and not in ngc 5548 suggests that the ilr islocated at a relatively large polar angle (~45 degrees) with respect to thenarrow-line region outflow axis.

0903.4411	physical conditions in the inner narrow line region of the seyfert 2  galaxy markarian 573	we have examined the physical conditions within a bright emission-line knotin the inner narrow-line region (nlr) of the seyfert 2 galaxy mrk 573 usingoptical spectra and photoionization models. the spectra were obtained with thehubble space telescope/space telescope imaging spectrograph with the g430l andg750m gratings. comparing the spatial emission-line profiles, we found [fe x]6734 barely resolved, [o iii] 5007 centrally peaked, but broader than [fe x],and [o ii] 3727 the most extended. the spectra reveal that [fe x] is broader invelocity width and blue-shifted compared with lines from less ionized species.our estimate of the bolometric luminosity indicates that the active galacticnucleus (agn) is radiating at or above its eddington luminosity, which isconsistent with its identification as a hidden narrow-line seyfert 1. we wereable to successfully match the observed emission line ratios with athree-component photoionization model. two components, one to account for the[o iii] emission and another in which the [fe x] arises, are directly ionizedby the agn, while [o ii] forms in a third component, which is ionized by aheavily absorbed continuum. based on our assumed ionizing continuum and themodel parameters, we determined that the two directly-ionized components are ~55 pc from the agn. we have found similar radial distances for the centralknots in the seyfert 2 galaxies mrk 3 and ngc 1068, but much smaller radialdistances for the inner nlr in the seyfert 1 galaxies ngc 4151 and ngc 5548.although in general agreement with the unified model, these results suggestthat the obscuring material in seyfert galaxies extends out to at least tens ofparsecs from the agn.

0706.3053	a survey of intrinsic absorption in active galaxies using the far  ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer	we present a survey of 72 seyfert galaxies and quasars observed by the it farultraviolet spectroscopic explorer (fuse). we have determined that 72 of 253available active galactic nuclei (agn) targets are viable targets for detectionof intrinsic absorption lines. we examined these spectra for signs of intrinsicabsorption in the o vi doublet (lambda 1031.9, 1037.6) and lyman beta (lambda1025.7). the fraction of seyfert 1 galaxies and low-redshift quasars at z &lt;0.15 that show evidence of intrinsic uv absorption is ~50%, which is slightlylower than crenshaw et al. (1999) found (60%) based on a smaller sample ofseyfert 1 galaxies observed with the hubble space telescope (hst). with thisnew fraction we find a global covering factor of the absorbing gas with respectto the central nucleus of ~0.4. our survey is to date the largest searching forintrinsic uv absorption with high spectral resolution, and is the first steptoward a more comprehensive study of intrinsic absorption in low-redshift agn.

0706.4317	on the effects of dissipative turbulence on the narrow emission-line  ratios in seyfert galaxies	we present a photoionization model study of the effects of micro-turbulenceand dissipative heating on emission lines for number and column densities,elemental abundances, and ionizations typical for the narrow emission lineregions (nlrs) of seyfert galaxies. earlier studies of nlr spectra generallyfound good agreement between the observations and the model predictions formost strong emission lines, such as [o iii] $\lambda$5007, [o ii]$\lambda$3727, [n ii] $\lambda$6583, [ne iii] $\lambda$3869, and the h and herecombination lines. nevertheless, the strengths of lines from species withionization potentials greater than that of he$^{+}$(54.4 ev), e.g. n$^{+4}$ andne$^{+4}$, were often under-predicted. among the explanations suggested forthese discrepancies were (selectively) enhanced elemental abundances andcontributions from shock heated gas. interestingly, the nlr lines have widthsof several 100 km s$^{-1}$, well in excess of the thermal broadening. if thisis due to micro-turbulence, and the turbulence dissipates within theemission-line gas, the gas can be heated in excess of that due tophotoionization. we show that the combined effects of turbulence anddissipative heating can strongly enhance n v $\lambda$1240 (relative to he ii$\lambda$1640), while the heating alone can boost the strength of [ne v]$\lambda$3426. we suggest that this effect is present in the nlr, particularlywithin $\sim$ 100 pc of the central engine. finally, since micro-turbulencewould make clouds robust against instabilities generated during acceleration,it is not likely to be a coincidence that the radially outflowing emission-linegas is turbulent.

0910.1614	the mid-infrared continua of seyfert galaxies	an analysis of archival mid-infrared (mid-ir) spectra of seyfert galaxiesfrom the spitzer space telescope observations is presented. we characterize thenature of the mid-ir active nuclear continuum by subtracting a templatestarburst spectrum from the seyfert spectra. the long wavelength part of thespectrum contains a strong contribution from the starburst-heated cool dust;this is used to effectively separate starburst-dominated seyferts from thosedominated by the active nuclear continuum. within the latter category, thestrength of the active nuclear continuum drops rapidly beyond ~ 20 micron. onaverage, type 2 seyferts have weaker short-wavelength active nuclear continuaas compared to type 1 seyferts. type 2 seyferts can be divided into two types,those with strong poly-cyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) bands and thosewithout. the latter type show polarized broad emission lines in their opticalspectra. the pah-dominated type 2 seyferts and seyfert 1.8/1.9s show verysimilar mid-ir spectra. however, after the subtraction of the starburstcomponent, there is a striking similarity in the active nuclear continuum ofall seyfert optical types. pah-dominated seyfert 2s and seyfert 1.8/1.9s tendto show weak active nuclear continua in general. a few type 2 seyferts withweak/absent pah bands show a bump in the spectrum between 15 and 20 micron. wesuggest that this bump is the peak of a warm (~200 k) blackbody dust emission,which becomes clearly visible when the short-wavelength continuum is weaker.this warm blackbody emission is also observed in other seyfert opticalsubtypes, suggesting a common origin in these active galactic nuclei.

0911.0675	radial velocity offsets due to mass outflows and extinction in active  galactic nuclei	we present a study of the radial velocity offsets between narrow emissionlines and host galaxy lines (stellar absorption and h i 21-cm emission) inseyfert galaxies with observed redshifts less than 0.043. we find that 35% ofthe seyferts in the sample show [o iii] emission lines with blueshifts withrespect to their host galaxies exceeding 50 km/s, whereas only 6% showredshifts this large, in qualitative agreement with most previous studies. wealso find that a greater percentage of seyfert 1 galaxies show blueshifts thanseyfert 2 galaxies. using hst/stis spatially-resolved spectra of the seyfert 2galaxy ngc 1068 and the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4151, we generate geometric modelsof their narrow-line regions (nlrs) and inner galactic disks, and show howthese models can explain the blueshifted [o iii] emission lines in collapsedstis spectra of these two seyferts. we conclude that the combination of massoutflow of ionized gas in the nlr and extinction by dust in the inner disk(primarily in the form of dust spirals) is primarily responsible for thevelocity offsets in seyfert galaxies. more exotic explanations are not needed.we discuss the implications of this result for the velocity offsets found inhigher redshift agn.

0912.0456	spectral variability and reverberation time delays in the suzaku x-ray  spectrum of ngc 4051	long-exposure suzaku x-ray observations of the active galaxy ngc 4051 from2005 and 2008 are analysed, in an attempt to reach a self-consistentunderstanding of the spectral variability on long timescales and at high timeresolution. principal components analysis and a maximum likelihood method ofpower spectrum analysis are used. in common with other type i agn, the spectralvariability is dominated by a varying-normalisation power-law componenttogether with a quasi-steady, hard-spectrum offset component that contains fe katomic features. ngc 4051 displays a strong excess over a power-law at energiesabove 20 kev, some fraction of which also appears to vary with the power-lawcontinuum. the fast-timescale power spectrum has a shape consistent withprevious determinations, but significant differences are found between the lowand high flux states of the source, demonstrating that the power spectrum isnon-stationary. frequency-dependent time lags between the hard and soft bandsof up to 970+/-225s are measured. the existence of the observed lags excludesthe possibility that the hard spectral component originates as reflection fromthe inner accretion disk. we instead show that the frequency- andenergy-dependent time lags may be explained as reverberation, caused byreflection from a thick shell of material with maximum lags of about 10,000s.if the reflecting material surrounds the agn, it extends to a distance about1.5x10^14 cm, 600 gravitational radii, from the illuminating source and theglobal covering factor is c(g) &gt;~ 0.4, confirming suggestions that type i agnhave high covering factors of absorbing and reflecting material. given thespectral and timing similarities with other type i agn, we infer that thisstructure is common in the type i population.

1002.0082	significant x-ray line emission in the 5-6 kev band of ngc 4051	a suzaku x-ray observation of ngc 4051 taken during 2005 nov reveals lineemission at 5.44 kev in the rest-frame of the galaxy which does not have anobvious origin in known rest-frame atomic transitions. the improvement to thefit statistic when this line is accounted for establishes its reality at &gt;99.9%confidence: we have also verified that the line is detected in the three xisunits independently. comparison between the data and monte carlo simulationsshows that the probability of the line being a statistical fluctuation is p &lt;3.3 x 10^-4. consideration of three independent line detections in suzaku datataken at different epochs yields a probability p&lt; 3 x 10^-11 and thusconclusively demonstrates that it cannot be a statistical fluctuation in thedata. the new line and a strong component of fe ka emission from neutralmaterial are prominent when the source flux is low, during 2005. spectra from2008 show evidence for a line consistent with having the same flux and energyas that observed during 2005, but inconsistent with having a constantequivalent width against the observed continuum. the stability of the line fluxand energy suggests that it may not arise in transient hotspots, as has beensuggested for similar lines in other sources, but could arise from a speciallocation in the reprocessor, such as the inner edge of the accretion disk.alternatively, the line energy may be explained by spallation of fe into cr, asdiscussed in a companion paper.

1003.2984	a new radio loudness diagnostic for active galaxies: a  radio-to-mid-infrared parameter	we have studied the relationship between the nuclear (high-resolution) radioemission, at 8.4 ghz (3.6 cm) and 1.4 ghz (20 cm), the [o iv] 25.89um, [ne iii]15.56um and [ne ii] 12.81um emission lines and the black hole mass accretionrate for a sample of seyfert galaxies. in order to characterize the radiocontribution for the seyfert nuclei we used the 8.4ghz/[o iv] ratio, assumingthat [o iv] scales with the luminosity of the agn. from this we find thatseyfert 1's (i.e., seyfert 1.0's, 1.2's, and 1.5's) and seyfert 2's (i.e.,seyfert 1.8's, 1.9's, and 2.0's) have similar radio contributions, relative tothe agn. on the other hand, sources in which the [ne ii] emission is dominatedeither by the agn or star formation have statistically different radiocontributions, with star formation dominated sources more "radio loud", by afactor of ~2.8 on average, than agn dominated sources. we show that starformation dominated sources with relatively larger radio contribution havesmaller mass accretion rates. overall, we suggest that 8.4ghz/[o iv], oralternatively, 1.4ghz/[o iv] ratios, can be used to characterize the radiocontribution, relative to the agn, without the limitation of previous methodsthat rely on optical observables.

0708.1338	the variable x-ray spectrum of markarian 766 - ii. time-resolved  spectroscopy	context: the variable x-ray spectra of agn systematically show steeppower-law high states and hard-spectrum low states. the hard low state haspreviously been found to be a component with only weak variability. the originof this component and the relative importance of effects such as absorption andrelativistic blurring are currently not clear. aims: in a follow-up of previousprincipal components analysis, we aim to determine the relative importance ofscattering and absorption effects on the time-varying x-ray spectrum of thenarrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy mrk~766. methods: time-resolved spectroscopy,slicing xmm and suzaku data down to 25 ks elements, is used to investigatewhether absorption or scattering components dominate the spectral variations inmrk 766.time-resolved spectroscopy confirms that spectral variability in mrk766 can be explained by either of two interpretations of principal componentsanalysis. detailed investigation confirm rapid changes in the relativestrengths of scattered and direct emission or rapid changes in absorbercovering fraction provide good explanations of most of the spectralvariability. however, a strong correlation between the 6.97 kev absorption lineand the primary continuum together with rapid opacity changes show thatvariations in a complex and multi-layered absorber, most likely a disk wind,are the dominant source of spectral variability in mrk 766

1006.1875	modeling the outflow in the narrow-line region of markarian  573:biconical illumination of a gaseous disk	we present a study of the outflowing ionized gas in the resolved narrow-lineregion (nlr) of the seyfert 2 galaxy mrk 573, and its interaction with an in-ner dust/gas disk, based on hubble space telescope (hst) wfpc2 and stisobservations. from the spectroscopic and imaging information, we determined thefundamental geometry of the outflow and inner disk, via two modeling pro- gramsused to recreate the morphology of these regions imaged with hst. we alsodetermined that the bicone of ionizing radiation from the active galacticnucleus (agn) intersects with the inner disk, illuminating a section of thedisk including inner segments of spiral arms, fully seen through structuremapping, which appear to be outflowing and expanding. in addition, we see highvelocities at projected distances of \geq 2'' (- 700 pc) from the nucleus,which could be due to rotation or to in situ acceleration of gas off the spiralarms. we find that the true half opening angle of the ionizing bicone (53degrees) is much larger than the apparent half-opening angle (34 degrees) dueto the above geometry, which may apply to a number of other seyferts as well.

1010.2750	a multi-wavelength study of the nature of type 1.8/1.9 seyfert galaxies	we focus on determining the underlying physical cause of a seyfert galaxy'sappearance as type a 1.8 or 1.9. are these "intermediate" seyfert types typicalseyfert 1 nuclei with reddened broad-line regions? or are they objects withintrinsically weak continua and broad emission lines? we compare measurementsof the optical reddening of the narrow and broad-line regions with each otherand with the x-ray column derived from xmm-newton 0.5-10 kev spectra todetermine the presence and location of dust in the line of sight. we alsosearched the literature to see if the objects showed evidence for broad-linevariability, and determined if the changes were consistent with a change inreddening or a change in the intrinsic ionizing continuum flux. we find that 10of 19 objects previously classified as seyfert 1.8/1.9s received thisdesignation due to their low continuum flux. in four objects the classificationwas due to blr reddening, either by the torus or dust structures in thevicinity of the nlr; in the remaining five objects there is not sufficientevidence to favor one scenario over the other. these findings imply that, ingeneral, samples of 1.8/1.9s are not suitable for use in studies of the gas anddust in the central torus.

1011.5993	multi-wavelength probes of obscuration towards the narrow line region in  seyfert galaxies	we present a study of reddening and absorption towards the narrow lineregions (nlr) in active galactic nuclei (agn) selected from the revisedshapley-ames, 12mu, and swift/burst alert telescope samples. for the sources inhost galaxies with inclinations of b/a &gt; 0.5, we find that mean ratio of [oiii] 5007a, from ground-based observations, and [o iv] 28.59mu, fromspitzer/infrared spectrograph observations, is a factor of 2 lower in seyfert2s than seyfert 1s. the combination of low [o iii]/[o iv] and [o iii] 4363/5007ratios in seyfert 2s suggests more extinction of emission from the nlr than inseyfert 1s. similar column densities of dusty gas, nh ~ several x 10^21 cm^-2,can account for the suppression of both [o iii] 5007a and [o iii] 4363a, ascompared to those observed in seyfert 1s. also, we find that the x-ray lineovii 22.1a is weaker in seyfert 2s, consistent with absorption by the same gasthat reddens the optical emission. using a hubble space telescope/spacetelescope imaging spectrograph slitless spectrum of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc4151, we estimate that only ~ 30% of the [o iii] 5007a comes from within 30 pcof the central source, which is insufficient to account for the low [oiii]/[oiv] ratios in seyfert 2s. if seyfert 2 galaxies have similar intrinsic[oiii] spatial profiles, the external dusty gas must extend further out alongthe nlr, perhaps in the form of nuclear dust spirals that have been associatedwith fueling flows towards the agn.

1102.1894	contemporaneous chandra hetg and suzaku x-ray observations of ngc 4051	we present the results of a deep 300 ks chandra hetg observation of thehighly variable narrow-line seyfert type 1 galaxy ngc 4051. the hetg spectrumreveals 28 significant soft x-ray ionised lines in either emission orabsorption; primarily originating from h-like and he-like k-shell transitionsof o, ne, mg and si (including higher order lines and strong forbidden emissionlines from o vii and ne ix) plus high ionisation l-shell transitions from fexvii to fe xxii and lower ionisation inner-shell lines (e.g. o vi). modellingthe data with xstar requires four distinct ionisation zones for the gas, alloutflowing with velocities &lt; 1000 km/s. a selection of the strongestemission/absorption lines appear to be resolved with fwhm of ~600 km/s. we alsopresent the results from a quasi-simultaneous 350 ks suzaku observation of ngc4051 where the xis spectrum reveals strong evidence for blueshifted absorptionlines at ~6.8 and ~7.1 kev, consistent with previous findings. modelling withxstar suggests that this is the signature of a highly ionised, high velocityoutflow (log \xi ~ 4.1; v ~ -0.02c) which potentially may have a significanteffect on the host galaxy environment via feedback. finally, we alsosimultaneously model the broad-band 2008 xis+hxd suzaku data with archivalsuzaku data from 2005 when the source was observed to have entered an extendedperiod of low flux in an attempt to analyse the cause of the long-term spectralvariability. we find that we can account for this by allowing for largevariations in the normalisation of the intrinsic power-law component which maybe interpreted as being due to significant changes in the covering fraction ofa compton-thick partial-coverer obscuring the central continuum emission.

1103.0661	a broad-band x-ray view of the warm absorber in radio-quiet quasar  mr2251-178	we present the analysis of a new broad-band x-ray spectrum (0.6-180.0 kev) ofthe radio-quiet quasar mr 2251-178 which uses data obtained with both suzakuand the swift/bat. in accordance with previous observations, we find that thegeneral continuum can be well described by a power-law with {\gamma}=1.6 and anapparent soft-excess below 1 kev. warm absorption is clearly present andabsorption lines due to the fe uta, fe l (fe xxiii-xxiv), s xv and s xvi aredetected below 3 kev. at higher energies, fe k absorption from fe xxv-xxvi isdetected and a relatively weak (ew=25[+12,-8] ev) narrow fe k{\alpha} emissionline is observed at e=6.44\pm0.04 kev. the fe k{\alpha} emission is wellmodelled by the presence of a mildly ionised ({\xi}\leq30) reflection componentwith a low reflection fraction (r&lt;0.2). at least 5 ionised absorptioncomponents with 10^{20} \leq n_h \leq 10^{23} cm^{-2} and 0 \leq log({\xi})/ergcm s^{-1} \leq 4 are required to achieve an adequate spectral fit.alternatively, we show that the continuum can also be fit if a {\gamma}~2.0power-law is absorbed by a column of n_h~10^{23} cm^{-2} which covers ~30% ofthe source flux. independent of which continuum model is adopted, the fe l andfe xxv he{\alpha} lines are described by a single absorber outflowing withv_out~0.14 c. such an outflow/disk wind is likely to be substantially clumped(b~10^{-3}) in order to not vastly exceed the likely accretion rate of thesource.

0709.3076	spitzer/irs observations of seyfert 1.8s and 1.9s: a comparison with  seyfert 1s and seyfert 2s	we present spitzer space telescope mid-infrared spectra of 12 seyfert 1.8 and1.9 galaxies over the 5-38 um region. we compare the spectral characteristicsof this sample to those of 58 seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 galaxies from the spitzerarchives. an analysis of the spectral shapes, the silicate 10 um feature andthe emission line fluxes have enabled us to characterize the mid-ir propertiesof seyfert 1.8/1.9s. we find that the equivalent widths of the 10 um silicatefeature are generally weak in all seyfert galaxies, as previously reported byseveral studies. the few seyfert galaxies in this sample that show deep 10 umsilicate absorption features are highly inclined and/or merging galaxies. it islikely that these absorption features originate primarily in the dustyinterstellar medium of the host galaxy rather than in a dusty torus on parsecscales close to the central engine. we find that the equivalent width of thepolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) band at 6.2 um correlates strongly withthe 20-30 um spectral index. either of these quantities are good indicators ofthe amount of starburst contribution to the mid-ir spectra. the spectra ofseyfert 1.8 and 1.9s are dominated by these starburst features, similar to mostseyfert 2s. they show strong pah bands and a strong red continuum toward 30 um.the strengths of the high-ionization forbidden narrow emission lines [o iv]25.89 um, [ne iii] 15.56 um and [ne v] 14.32 um relative to [ne ii] 12.81 umare weaker in seyfert 1.8/1.9s and seyfert 2s as compared to seyfert 1s. theweakness of high-ionization lines in seyfert 1.8-1.9s is suggestive ofintrinsically weak active galactic nuclei (agn) continua, and/or stronger starformation activity leading to enhanced [ne ii]. we discuss the implications ofthese observational results in the context of the unified model of agn.

1106.0310	uncovering the spectral energy distribution in active galaxies using  high ionization mid-infrared emission lines	the shape of the spectral energy distribution of active galaxies in theeuv--soft x-ray band (13.6 ev to 1 kev) is uncertain because obscuration bydust and gas can hamper our view of the continuum. to investigate the shape ofthe spectral energy distribution in this energy band, we have generated a setof photoionization models which reproduce the small dispersion found incorrelations between high-ionization mid-infrared emission lines in a sample ofhard x-ray selected agn. our calculations show that a broken power-lawcontinuum model is sufficient to reproduce the [ne v]14.32 mm/[neiii], [nev]24.32mm/[o iv]25.89mm and [o iv] 25.89mm/[ne iii] ratios, and does notrequire the addition of a "big bump" euv model component. we constrain theeuv--soft x-ray slope, alpha_i, to be between 1.5 -- 2.0 and derive a best fitof alpha_i ~ 1.9 for seyfert 1 galaxies, consistent with previous studies ofintermediate redshift quasars. if we assume a blue bump model, most sources inour sample have derived temperatures between t_{bb}=10^{5.18} k to 10^{5.7} k,suggesting that the peak of this component spans a large range of energiesextending from ~ lambda 600a to lambda 1900a. in this case, the best fittingpeak energy that matches the mid-infrared line ratios of seyfert 1 galaxiesoccurs between ~ lambda 700--1000a. despite the fact that our results do notrule out the presence of an euv bump, we conclude that our power-law modelproduces enough photons with energies &gt; 4 ry to generate the observed amount ofmid-infrared emission in our sample of bat agn.

1204.6694	feedback from mass outflows in nearby active galactic nuclei i. uv and  x-ray absorbers	we present an investigation into the impact of feedback from outflowing uvand x-ray absorbers in nearby z &lt; 0.04 agn. from studies of the kinematics,physical conditions, and variability of the absorbers in the literature, wecalculate the possible ranges in total mass outflow rate and kinetic luminosityfor each agn, summed over all of its absorbers. these calculations make use ofvalues (or limits) for the radial locations of the absorbers determined fromvariability, excited-state absorption, and other considerations. from a sampleof 10 seyfert 1 galaxies with detailed photoionization models for theirabsorbers, we find that 7 have sufficient constraints on the absorber locationsto determine feedback parameters. for the low-luminosity agn ngc 4395, thesevalues are low, although we do not have sufficient constraints on the x-rayabsorbers to make definitive conclusions. at least 5 of the 6 seyfert 1s withmoderate bolometric luminosities have mass outflow rates that are 10 - 1000times the mass accretion rates needed to generate their observed luminosities,indicating that most of the mass outflow originates from outside the inneraccretion disk. three of these (ngc 4051, ngc 3516, and ngc 3783) have kineticluminosities in the range 0.5 to 5% bolometric, which is the range typicallyrequired by feedback models for efficient self-regulation of black-hole andgalactic bulge growth. at least 2 of the other 3 (ngc 5548, ngc 4151, and ngc7469) have kinetic luminosities &gt; 0.1% bolometric, although these values mayincrease if radial locations can be determined for more of the absorbers. weconclude that the outflowing uv and x-ray absorbers in moderate-luminosity agnhave the potential to deliver significant feedback to their environments.

1210.0469	direct measurement of the x-ray time-delay transfer function in active  galactic nuclei	the origin of the observed time lags, in nearby active galactic nuclei (agn),between hard and soft x-ray photons is investigated using new xmm-newton datafor the narrow-line seyfert i galaxy ark 564 and existing data for 1h0707-495and ngc 4051. these agn have highly variable x-ray light curves that containfrequent, high peaks of emission. the averaged light curve of the peaks isdirectly measured from the time series, and it is shown that (i) peaks occur atthe same time, within the measurement uncertainties, at all x-ray energies, and(ii) there exists a substantial tail of excess emission at hard x-ray energies,which is delayed with respect to the time of the main peak, and is particularlyprominent in ark 564. observation (i) rules out that the observed lags arecaused by comptonization time delays and disfavors a simple model ofpropagating fluctuations on the accretion disk. observation (ii) is consistentwith time lags caused by compton-scattering reverberation from material a fewthousand light-seconds from the primary x-ray source. the power spectraldensity and the frequency-dependent phase lags of the peak light curves areconsistent with those of the full time series. there is evidence fornon-stationarity in the ark 564 time series in both the fourier and peaksanalyses. a sharp `negative' lag (variations at hard photon energies lead softphoton energies) observed in ark 564 appears to be generated by the shape ofthe hard-band transfer function and does not arise from soft-band reflection ofx-rays. these results reinforce the evidence for the existence of x-rayreverberation in type i agn, which requires that these agn are significantlyaffected by scattering from circumnuclear material a few tens or hundreds ofgravitational radii in extent.

1308.4129	determining inclinations of active galactic nuclei via their narrow-line  region kinematics - i. observational results	active galactic nuclei (agn) are axisymmetric systems to first order; theirobserved properties are likely strong functions of inclination with respect toour line of sight. however, except for a few special cases, the specificinclinations of individual agn are unknown. we have developed a promisingtechnique for determining the inclinations of nearby agn by mapping thekinematics of their narrow-line regions (nlrs), which are often easily resolvedwith hubble space telescope (hst) [o iii] imaging and long-slit spectra fromthe space telescope imaging spectrograph (stis). our studies indicate that nlrkinematics dominated by radial outflow can be fit with simple biconical outflowmodels that can be used to determine the inclination of the bicone axis, andhence the obscuring torus, with respect to our line of sight. we present nlranalysis of 53 seyfert galaxies and resultant inclinations from models of 17individual agn with clear signatures of biconical outflow. our model resultsagree with the unified model in that seyfert 1 agn have nlrs inclined furthertoward our line of sight (los) than seyfert 2 agn. knowing the inclinations ofthese agn nlrs, and thus their accretion disk and/or torus axes, will allow usto determine how their observed properties vary as a function of polar angle.we find no correlation between the inclinations of the agn nlrs and the disksof their host galaxies, indicating that the orientation of the gas in the torusis independent from that of the host disk.

0705.0628	a photoionization model for the soft x-ray spectrum of ngc 4151	we present analysis of archival data from multiple xmm-newton observations ofthe seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4151. spectral data from the rgs instruments revealseveral strong soft x-ray emission lines, chiefly from hydrogen-like andhelium-like oxygen, nitrogen, neon and carbon. radiative recombination continua(rrc) from oxygen and carbon are also detected. our analysis suggests that theemission data are consistent with photoionization. using the cloudyphotoionization code, we found that, while a two-component, high column densitymodel (10e23 cm-2) with low covering factor proved adequate in reproducing alldetected lyman series lines, it proved insufficient in modeling he-liketriplets observed (neon, oxygen, and nitrogen). if resonance line data wereignored, the two-component model was sufficient to match flux fromintercombination and forbidden lines. however, with the inclusion of resonanceline data, he-like triplets could no longer be modeled with only twocomponents. we found that observed oxygen g and r ratios especially wereanomalous in parameter space investigated. we investigated, and were forced todismiss, the possibility that a third purely collisional component could beresponsible for enhanced resonance line contributions. we succeeded in modelingthe observed spectrum with the addition of a third, lower column density(10e20.5 cm-2) component with non-zero microturbulence and high coveringfactor. while sufficient to reproduce observed soft x-ray flux, our model facescertain shortcomings, particularly in a less-than-ideal visual fit to the lineprofile. two of the three emission model components bear similarities tocomponents determined by kraemer et al. (2005) in their study of ngc 4151absorption spectra.

1402.3509	determining inclinations of active galactic nuclei via their narrow-line  region kinematics - ii. correlation with observed properties	active galactic nuclei (agn) are axisymmetric systems to first order; theirobserved properties are likely strong functions of inclination with respect toour line of sight, yet the specific inclinations of all but a few agn aregenerally unknown. by determining the inclinations and geometries of nearbyseyfert galaxies using the kinematics of their narrow-line regions (nlrs), andcomparing them with observed properties, we find strong correlations betweeninclination and total hydrogen column density, infrared color, and h-betafull-width at half maximum (fwhm). these correlations provide evidence that theorientation of agn with respect to our line of sight affects how we perceivethem, beyond the seyfert type dichotomy. they can also be used to constrain 3dmodels of agn components such as the broad-line region and torus. additionally,we find weak correlations between agn luminosity and several modeled nlrparameters, which suggests that the nlr geometry and kinematics are dependentto some degree on the agn's radiation field.

0803.0080	tracing a disk wind in ngc 3516	x-ray spectra of agn often contain signatures indicative of absorption inmultiple layers of gas whose ionization-state and covering fraction may varywith time. it has been unclear to date how much of the observed x-ray spectraland timing behavior in agn can be attributed to variations in absorption,versus variations in the strengths of emission or reflection components.diagnostics of the inner regions of agn cannot be reliably performed until theorigin of observed effects is understood. we investigate the role of the x-rayabsorbers in the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 3516. time-averaged and flux-selectedspectroscopy is used to examine the behavior of ngc 3516 observed in chandrahetg and xmm data from oct 2006. new h-like and he-like emission and absorptionfeatures discovered in the fe k regime reveal a previously unknown zone ofcircumnuclear gas in ngc 3516 with log xi ~ 4.3 and column density 1e23 cm^-2.a lower-ionization layer with log xi ~2 and of similar column density isconfirmed from previous observations, this layer has a covering fraction around50%, and changes in covering provide a simple explanation of a deep dip in thelight curve that we interpret as an eclipse of the continuum due to passage ofa cloud across the sight line within half a day. these inner zones of absorbinggas are detected to have outflow velocities in the range 1000-2000 km/s, this,and constraints on radial location are consistent with an origin as part of adisk wind in ngc 3516.

1406.5563	theoretical modeling of emission-line galaxies: new classification  parameters for mid-infrared and optical spectroscopy	we have carried out extensive and detailed photoionization modeling tosuccessfully constrain the locations of different emission-line galaxies inoptical and mid-infrared diagnostic diagrams. our model grids cover a widerange in parameter space for the active galaxy continuum and starburst galaxieswith different stellar population laws and metallicities. we compare thepredicted agn and star-formation mid-infrared line ratios [ne iii]15.56mm/[neii]12.81mm and [o iv]25.89mm/[ne iii]15.56mm to the observed values, and findthat the best fit for the agn is via a two-zone approximation. this two-zoneapproximation is a combination of a matter-bounded component, where [ne iii]and [o iv] are emitted efficiently, and a radiation-bounded component thatmaximizes [ne ii] emission. we overlay the predictions from this two-zoneapproximation onto the optical [o iii]l5007/hbeta and [n ii]l6583/halphadiagnostic diagram derived from the sloan digital sky survey, to find that thehigh-density and low-ionization radiation-bounded component in our two-zone agnapproximation model provides a good lower limit for [n ii] emission. thisestablishes a new theoretical demarcation line for the minimum agn contributionin this diagram. this new classification results by a factor of ~1.4 in ahigher agn population than predictions derived from previous divisions ofstar-forming galaxies. similarly, we define a maximum agn contribution in the[o iii]/hbeta and [n ii]/halpha diagram by using a two-zone approximationwithin a parameter range typical of the narrow-line region.

1410.6799	physical conditions in the x-ray emission-line gas in ngc 1068	we present a detailed, photoionization modeling analysis ofxmm-newton/reflection grating spectrometer observations of the seyfert 2 galaxyngc 1068. the spectrum, previously analyzed by kinkhabwala et al. (2002),reveals a myriad of soft-xray emission lines, including those from h- andhe-like carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and neon, and m- and l-shell iron. as notedin the earlier analysis, based on the narrowness of the radiative recombinationcontinua, the electron temperatures in the emission-line gas are consistentwith photoionization, rather than collisional ionization. the strengths of thecarbon and nitrogen emission lines, relative to those of oxygen, suggestunusual elemental abundances, which we attribute to star-formation history ofthe host galaxy. overall, the emission-lines are blue-shifted with respect tosystemic, with radial velocities ~ 160 km/s, similar to that of [o iii] 5007,and thus consistent with the kinematics and orientation of the opticalemission-line gas and, hence, likely part of an agn-driven outflow. we wereable to achieve an acceptable fit to most of the strong emission-lines with atwo-component photoionization model, generated with cloudy. the two componentshave ionization parameters and column densities of logu = -0.05 and 1.22, andlogn(h) = 20.85 and 21.2, and covering factors of 0.35 and 0.84, respectively.the total mass of the x-ray gas is roughly of an order of magnitude greaterthan the mass of ionized gas determined from optical and near-ir spectroscopy,which indicates that it may be the dominant component of the narrow lineregion. furthermore, we suggest that the medium which produces thescattered/polarized optical emission in ngc~1068 possesses similar physicalcharacteristics to those of the more highly-ionized of the x-ray modelcomponents.

0804.1147	new indicators for agn power: the correlation between [o iv] lambda  25.89 micron and hard x-ray luminosity for nearby seyfert galaxies	we have studied the relationship between the [o iv] lambda 25.89 micronemission line luminosities, obtained from spitzer spectra, the x-ray continuain the 2-10 kev band, primarily from asca, and the 14-195 kev band obtainedwith the swift/burst alert telescope (bat), for a sample of nearby (z &lt; 0.08)seyfert galaxies. for comparison, we have examined the relationship between the[o iii] 5007, the 2-10 kev and the 14-195 kev luminosities for the same set ofobjects. we find that both the [o iv] and [o iii] luminosities arewell-correlated with the bat luminosities. on the other hand, the [o iii]luminosities are better-correlated with 2-10 kev luminosities than are those of[o iv]. when comparing [o iv] and [o iii] luminosities for the different typesof galaxies, we find that the seyfert 2's have significantly lower [o iii] to[o iv] ratios than the seyfert 1's. we suggest that this is due to morereddening of the narrow line region (nlr) of the seyfert 2's. assuming galacticdust to gas ratios, the average amount of extra reddening corresponds to ahydrogen column density of ~ few times 10^21 cm^-2, which is a small fractionof the x-ray absorbing columns in the seyfert 2's. the combined effects ofreddening and the x-ray absorption are the probable reason why the [o iii]versus 2-10 kev correlation is better than the [o iv] versus 2-10 kev, sincethe [o iv] emission line is much less affected by extinction. overall, we findthe [o iv] to be an accurate and truly isotropic indicator of the power of theagn. this suggests that it can be useful in deconvolving the contribution ofthe agn and starburst to the spectrum of compton-thick and/or x-ray weaksources.

astro-ph;0009356	stis echelle observations of ngc 4151: variable ionization of the  intrinsic uv absorbers	we present echelle observations of the intrinsic uv absorption lines in theseyfert galaxy ngc 4151, which were obtained with the space telescope imagingspectrograph (stis) on the hubble space telescope on 1999 july 19. the uvcontinuum flux at 1450 angstroms decreased by factor of about four over theprevious two years and there was a corresponding dramatic increase in thecolumn densities of the low-ionization absorption lines (e.g., si ii, fe ii,and al ii), presumably as a result of a decrease in the ionizing continuum. inaddition to the absorption lines seen in previous low states, we identify alarge number of fe ii absorption lines that arise from metastable levels ashigh as 4.1 ev above the ground state, indicating high densities (&gt; 10^6cm^-3). we find that the transient absorption feature in the blue wing of thebroad c iv emission, seen in a goddard high resolution spectrograph spectrumand thought to be a high-velocity c~iv component, is actually a si iifine-structure absorption line at a radial velocity of -560 km/s (relative tosystemic). we also demonstrate that the ``satellite'' emission lines of c~ivfound in international ultraviolet explorer spectra are actually regions ofunabsorbed continuum plus broad emission that become prominent when the uvcontinuum of ngc 4151 is in a low state.

astro-ph;0101037	stis echelle observations of the seyfert galaxy ngc 4151: physical  conditions in the ultraviolet absorbers	we have examined the physical conditions in intrinsic uv-absorbing gas in theseyfert galaxy ngc 4151, using echelle spectra obtained with the spacetelescope imaging spectrograph (stis). we confirm the presence of the kinematiccomponents detected in earlier ghrs observations as well as a new broadabsorption feature at a radial velocity of -1680 km/s. the uv continuum of ngc4151 decreased by a factor of 4 over the previous two years, and we argue thechanges in the column density of the low ionization absorption lines associatedwith the broad component at -490 km/s reflect the decrease in the ionizingflux. most of the strong absorption lines (e.g., n v, c iv, si iv) from thiscomponent are saturated, but show substantial residual flux in their cores,indicating that the absorber does not fully cover the source of emission. ourinterpretation is that the unocculted light is due to scattering by freeelectrons from an extended region, which reflects continuum, emission lines,and absorption lines. we have been able to constrain the densities for thekinematic components based on absorption lines from metastable states of c iiiand fe ii, and/or the ratios of ground and fine structure lines of o i,c ii,and si ii. we have generated a set of photoionization models which match theionic column densities for each component during the present low flux state andthose seen in previous high flux states with the ghrs and stis, confirming thatthe absorbers are photoionized and respond to the changes in the continuumflux. we have been able to map the relative radial positions of the absorbers,and find that the gas decreases in density with distance. none of the uvabsorbers is of sufficiently large column density or high enough ionizationstate to account for the x-ray absorption.

astro-ph;0102404	absorption and reddening in the seyfert galaxy ngc 3227	we have obtained low-dispersion spectra of ngc 3227 with the space telescopeimaging spectrograph (stis) to study the intrinsic uv absorption and thereddening of the nucleus in this seyfert 1 galaxy. the uv spectra show a wealthof absorption lines at the systemic redshift that span a wide range inionization state (mg i to n v). the equivalent widths of the lines areconsistent with our earlier prediction that a ``lukewarm absorber'' (t= 18,000k at the ionized face) with a substantial column of gas [n(h) = 2 x 10^21cm^-2] is present and likely responsible for the reddening of the nucleus. thelukewarm absorber is also responsible for most of the absorption in the x-raysat energies less than 1 kev, although a more highly ionized ``warm absorber''is needed to account for the o vii and o viii ionization edges. in addition, werequire a small column [n(h) = 5 x 10^19 cm^-2] of cold gas to match thestrengths of the neutral and singly-ionized lines in the uv spectra. ngc 3227is the first seyfert galaxy in which a strong link between the reddening andintrinsic uv absorption has been found. by comparing our stis uv and opticalspectra with those of the unreddened seyfert ngc 4151, we have determined areddening curve for the nuclear continuum source in ngc 3227 over the 1150 -10,200 a range. the reddening curve does not show a 2200 aa bump, and issteeper in the uv than reddening curves derived for the galaxy, lmc, and smc,suggesting a preponderence of small dust grains near the nucleus.

astro-ph;0104303	stis echelle observations of the intrinsic uv absorption in the seyfert  1 galaxy ngc 3783	we present observations of the uv absorption lines in the seyfert 1 galaxyngc 3783, obtained with the medium resolution echelle gratings of the spacetelescope imaging spectrograph(stis) on the hubble space telescope (hst). thespectra reveal the presence of three kinematic components of absorption inly-alpha, c iv, and n v, at radial velocities of -1365, -548, and -724 km/swith respect to the systemic velocity of the host galaxy (components 1, 2 and3, respectively); component 1 also shows absorption by si iv. component 3 wasnot detected in any of the earlier goddard high resolution spectrograph (ghrs)spectra, and the c iv absorption in the other components has changed since themost recent ghrs observation obtained 5 yr earlier. somewhat unexpectedly, eachcomponent has a covering factor (of the continuum source + broad emission lineregion) of about 0.6. we have calculated photoionization models to match the uvcolumn densities in each of the three components. based on the model results,there should be strong absorption in the bandpass of the far ultravioletspectroscopic explorer (fuse), 912 - 1200 a, including saturated o vi lines ateach component velocity. the models also predict large o vii and o viii columndensities but suggest that the uv absorbers cannot account for all of the x-rayabsorption detected in recent chandra spectra. finally, there is no evidencefor a correlation between the characteristics of the uv absorbers and the uvcontinuum flux, which suggests that the variations observed in the ghrs andstis spectra are due in large part to changes in the column densities of theabsorbers as the result of transverse motion.

astro-ph;0108521	kinematics of the narrow-line region in the seyfert 2 galaxy mrk 3	we present measurements of radial velocities for the narrow-line region gas(nlr) in the seyfert 2 galaxy mrk 3 out to ~1 kpc from the nucleus. theobservations consist of two datasets, both using the space telescope imagingspectrograph on board the hubble space telescope: 1) an [o iii] slitlessspectrum with the g430m grating of the inner 3" around the nucleus, and 2) along-slit observation centered on the nucleus (pa = 71 deg) using the g430lgrating and the 52" x 0".1 aperture. our results produce radial velocity mapsof the emission-line gas. these maps indicate general trends in the gas motion,which include: blueshifts and redshifts on either side of the nucleus, steepvelocity rises from systemic up to ~ +/-700 km/s taking place in the inner 0".3(0.8 kpc) both east and west of the nucleus, gradual velocity descents back tonear-systemic values from 0".3-1".0, slightly uneven velocity amplitudes oneach side of the nucleus, and narrow velocity ranges over the entire observedregion. when fitted to kinematic modeling programs for the nlr gas, the dataclearly favor a model where the gas exists in a partially filled bicone, isaccelerated radially away from the nucleus, and is followed by a constantdeceleration. this geometry and general kinematic model is in agreement withprevious work done on the nlr gas of ngc 1068 and ngc 4151. on scales ofhundreds of parsecs, we conclude that radial outflow may be a common feature ofseyfert galaxies.

astro-ph;0110303	reddening, emission-line, and intrinsic absorption properties in the  narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy akn 564	we use hubble space telescope uv and optical spectra of the narrow-lineseyfert 1 (nls1) galaxy akn 564 to investigate its internal reddening andproperties of its emission-line and intrinsic uv absorption gas. we find thatthe extinction curve of akn 564, derived from a comparison of its uv/opticalcontinuum to that of an unreddened nls1, lacks a 2200 a bump and turns uptowards the uv at a longer wavelength (4000 a) than the standard galactic, lmc,and smc curves. however, it does not show the extremely steep rise to 1200 athat characterizes the extinction curve of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 3227. theemission-lines and continuum experience the same amount of reddening,indicating the presence of a dust screen that is external to the narrow-lineregion (nlr). echelle spectra from the space telescope imaging spectrographshow intrinsic uv absorption lines due to ly-alpha, n v, c iv, si iv, and siiii, centered at a radial velocity of -190 km/s (relative to the host galaxy).photoionization models of the uv absorber indicate that it has a sufficientcolumnand is at a sufficient distance from the nucleus (d &gt; 95 pc) to be thesource of the dust screen. thus, akn 564 contains a dusty ``lukewarm absorber''similar to that seen in ngc 3227.

astro-ph;0111514	the spectral energy distribution of the seyfert galaxy ton s180	we present spectral results from a multi-satellite, broad-band campaign onthe narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy ton s180 performed at the end of 1999. wediscuss the spectral-energy distribution of the source, combining simultaneouschandra, asca and euve data with contemporaneous fuse, hst, and ground-basedoptical and infra-red data. the resulting sed shows that most of the energy isemitted in the 10 -- 100 ev regime, which must be dominated by the primaryenergy source. no spectral turnover is evident in the uv regime. this, thestrong soft x-ray emission, and the overall shape of the sed indicate thatemission from the accretion disk peaks between 15 and 100 ev. high resolutionfuse spectra showing uv absorption due to o vi and the lack of detectable x-rayabsorption in the chandra spectrum demonstrate the presence of a low columndensity of highly ionized gas along our line-of-sight. the highly-ionized stateof the circumnuclear gas is most likely linked to the high luminosity and steepspectrum of the active nucleus. given the strong ionizing flux in ton s180, itis possible that the clouds within a few tens of light days of the centralsource are too highly ionized to produce much line emission. thus the narrowwidth of the emission lines in ton s180 is due to the emission arising fromlarge radii.

astro-ph;0111523	the detection of circumnuclear x-ray emission from the seyfert galaxy  ngc 3516	we present the first high-resolution, x-ray image of the circumnuclearregions of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 3516, using the chandra x-ray observatory(cxo). all three of the cxo observations reported were performed with one ofthe two grating assemblies in place, and here we restrict our analysis toundispersed photons (i.e. those detected in the zeroth-order). apreviously-unknown x-ray source is detected approx 6 arcsec (1.1 h_{75}^{-1}kpc) nne of the nucleus (position angle approx 29 degrees) which we designatecxou 110648.1+723412. its spectrum can be characterized as a power law with aphoton index gamma ~ 1.8--2.6, or as thermal emission with a temperaturekt~0.7--3 kev. assuming a location within ngc 3516, isotropic emission impliesa luminosity l ~ 2--8e39 h_{75}^{-2} erg s^{-1} in the 0.4--2 kev band. if dueto a single point source, the object is super-eddington for a 1.4 m_sun neutronstar. however, multiple sources or a small, extended source cannot be excludedusing the current data. large-scale extended x-ray emission is also detectedout to ~10 arcsec (~1.7 h_{75}^{-1} kpc) from the nucleus to the ne and sw, andis approximately aligned with the morphologies of the radio emission andextended narrow emission line region (enlr). the mean luminosity of thisemission is 1--5e37 h_{75}^{-2} erg s^{-1} arcsec^{-2}, in the 0.4--2 kev band.unfortunately the current data cannot usefully constrain its spectrum. theseresults are consistent with earlier suggestions of circumnuclear x-ray emissionin ngc 3516. if the extended emission is due to scattering of the nuclear x-raycontinuum, then the pressure in the x-ray emitting gas is at least two ordersof magnitude too small to provide the confining medium for the enlr clouds.

astro-ph;0112027	the density and location of the x-ray absorbing gas in ngc 3516	a new chandra observation and archival observations by asca are used toinvestigate spectral variations in the sy1 galaxy ngc 3516 over a period of 7years. a large change in flux (factor ~50 at 1kev) is observed between an ascaobservation in '94 and the chandra observation in 2000, with the source closeto the all-time maximum and minimum x-ray flux states, respectively. we findthe variations in the observed flux and spectra at these epochs to beconsistent with a constant column density of line-of-sight material reacting tochanges in the ionizing continuum. the data from the two epochs are consistentwith a simple decrease (by a factor 8-10) in the luminosity of a constant0.5-50 kev slope source and a line-of-sight absorber with an equivalenthydrogen column density of 10^21.9 cm^-2. intermediate luminosities, sampledduring other asca observations, are all fitted by the same model with a verysmall change in spectral index (well below \delta\gamma=0.2). in addition,analysis of the long (360 ks) asca observation in 1998 shows clear "color"variations that are entirely consistent with this model and are interpreted asdue to changes in the opacity of the absorbing gas. the data allow us to put aconservative upper limit of 60 ks on the recombination time which translates toa lower limit of about 2.4 times 10^6 cm^-3 on the density of the recombininggas and an upper limit of about 6 times 10^17 h_{75}^-2 cm on its distance fromthe central source. these are the best limits obtained so far on the densityand location of the x-ray absorbing gas in a type-1 agn. they indicate that theabsorbing gas is different, in terms of its density and location, from theionized gas commonly observed in type-ii agn.

astro-ph;0404461	simultaneous x-ray and ultraviolet spectroscopy of the seyfert galaxy  ngc 5548. iii. x-ray time variability	the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 5548 was observed for a week by chandra using boththe hetgs and letgs spectrometers. in this paper we study the time variabilityof the continuum radiation. during our observation, the source showed a gradualincrease in flux over four days, followed by a rapid decrease and flattening ofthe light curve afterwards. superimposed upon these relatively slow variationsseveral short duration bursts or quasi-periodic oscillations occured with atypical duration of several hours and separation between 0.6-0.9 days. thebursts show a delay of the hard x-rays with respect to the soft x-rays of a fewhours. we interprete these bursts as due to a rotating, fluctuating hot spot atapproximately 10 gravitational radii; the time delay of the hard x-rays fromthe bursts agree with the canonical picture of inverse compton scattering ofthe soft accretion disk photons on a hot medium that is relatively close to thecentral black hole.

astro-ph;0405354	high-resolution ultraviolet spectra of the dwarf seyfert 1 galaxy ngc  4395: evidence for intrinsic absorption	we present ultraviolet spectra of the dwarf seyfert 1 nucleus of ngc 4395,obtained with the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer (fuse) and the hubblespace telescope's space telescope imaging spectrograph at velocity resolutionsof 7 to 15 km/sec. we confirm our earlier claim of c iv absorption inlow-resolution uv spectra and detect a number of other absorption lines withlower ionization potentials. in addition to the galactic lines, we identify twokinematic components of absorption that are likely to be intrinsic to ngc 4395.we consider possible origins of the absorption, including the interstellarmedium (ism) of ngc 4395, the narrow-line region (nlr), outflowing uvabsorbers, and x-ray ``warm absorbers.'' component 1, at a radial velocity of-770 km/sec with respect to the nucleus, is only identified in the c iv 1548.2line. it most likely represents an outflowing uv absorber, similar to thoseseen in a majority of seyfert 1 galaxies, although additional observations areneeded to confirm the reality of this feature. component 2, at -114 km/sec,most likely arises in the ism of ngc 4395; its ionic column densities cannot bematched by photoionization models with a power-law continuum. our models of thehighly ionized x-ray absorbers claimed for this active galactic nucleusindicate that they would have undetectable c iv absorption, but large o vi andh i columns should be present. we attribute our lack of detection of the o viand ly-beta absorption from the x-ray absorbers to a combination of noise anddilution of the nuclear spectrum by hot stars in the large fuse aperture.

0808.4154	constraining the agn contribution in a multiwavelength study of seyfert  galaxies	we have studied the relationship between the high- and low-ionization [o iv]lambda 25.89 micron, [ne iii] lambda 15.56 micron and [ne ii] lambda 12.81micron emission lines with the aim of constraining the active galactic nuclei(agn) and star formation contributions for a sample of 103 seyfert galaxies. weused the [o iv] and [ne ii] emission as tracers for the agn power and starformation to investigate the ionization state of the emission-line gas. we findthat seyfert 2 galaxies have, on average, lower [o iv]/[ne ii] ratios thanthose of seyfert 1 galaxies. this result suggests two possible scenarios: 1)seyfert 2 galaxies have intrinsically weaker agn, or 2) seyfert 2 galaxies haverelatively higher star formation rates than seyfert 1 galaxies. we estimate thefraction of [ne ii] directly associated with the agn and find that seyfert 2galaxies have a larger contribution from star formation, by a factor of ~1.5 onaverage, than what is found in seyfert 1 galaxies. using the stellar componentof [ne ii] as a tracer of the current star formation we found similar starformation rates in seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 galaxies. we examined the mid- andfar-infrared continua and find that [ne ii] is well correlated with thecontinuum luminosity at 60 micron and that both [ne iii] and [o iv] are bettercorrelated with the 25 micron luminosities than with the continuum at longerwavelengths, suggesting that the mid-infrared continuum luminosity is dominatedby the agn, while the far-infrared luminosity is dominated by star formation.overall, these results test the unified model of agn, and suggest that thedifferences between seyfert galaxies cannot be solely due to viewing angledependence.

astro-ph;0501122	simultaneous x-ray and uv spectroscopy of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc  5548.ii. physical conditions in the x-ray absorber	we present the results from a 500 ks chandra observation of the seyfert 1galaxy ngc 5548. we detect broadened emission lines of o vii and c vi in thespectra, similar to those observed in the optical and uv bands. the source wascontinuously variable, with a 30 % increase in luminosity in the second half ofthe observation. no variability in the warm absorber was detected between thespectra from the first 170 ks and the second part of the observation. thevelocity structure of the x-ray absorber is consistent with the velocitystructure measured simultaneously in the ultraviolet spectra. we find that thehighest velocity outflow component, at -1040 km/s, becomes increasinglyimportant for higher ionization parameters. this velocity component spans atleast three orders of magnitude in ionization parameter, producing both highlyionized x-ray absorption lines (mg xii, si xiv) as well as uv absorption lines.a similar conclusion is very probable for the other four velocity components.based upon our observations, we argue that the warm absorber probably does notmanifest itself in the form of photoionized clumps in pressure equilibrium witha surrounding wind. instead, a model with a continuous distribution of columndensity versus ionization parameter gives an excellent fit to our data. fromthe shape of this distribution and the assumption that the mass loss throughthe wind should be smaller than the accretion rate onto the black hole, wederive upper limits to the solid angle as small as 10^{-4} sr. from this weargue that the outflow occurs in density-stratified streamers. the densitystratification across the stream then produces the wide range of ionizationparameter observed in this source. abridged.

astro-ph;0501257	the connection between the narrow-line region and the uv absorbers in  seyfert galaxies	we present evidence that the outflowing uv absorbers in seyfert 1 galaxiesarise primarily in their inner narrow (emission) line regions (nlrs), based onsimilarities in their locations, kinematics, and physical conditions. 1) hubblespace telescope observations show that nearly all seyfert galaxies have bright,central knots of [o iii] emission in their nlrs with radii of tens of parsecs.these sizes are consistent with most previous estimates of the distances of uv(and x-ray) absorbers from their central continuum sources, and a recentlyobtained reliable distance of ~25 pc for a uv absorber in the seyfert 1 galaxyngc 3783. 2) the nuclear emission-line knots in a sample of 10 seyfert galaxieshave velocity widths of 300 - 1100 km/s (half-width at zero intensity), similarto the radial velocities of most uv absorbers. the highest radial velocity fora seyfert uv absorber to date is only -2100 km/s, which is much lower thantypical broad-line region (blr) velocities. there is also mounting evidencethat the nlr clouds are outflowing from the nucleus, like the uv absorbers. 3)if our hypothesis is correct, then the nlr must have a component with a highglobal covering factor (cg) of the continuum source and blr, to match thatfound from previous surveys of uv absorbers (cg = 0.5 - 1.0). using stisspectra of ngc 4151, obtained when the continuum and blr fluxes were low, wefind evidence for optically thin gas in its nuclear emission-line knot. we areable to match the line ratios from this gas with photoionization models thatinclude a component with cg ~ 1 and an ionization parameter and hydrogen columndensity that are typical of uv absorbers.

astro-ph;9910019	stis longslit spectroscopy of the narrow line region of ngc 4151. i.  kinematics and emission line ratios	longslit spectra of the seyfert galaxy ngc 4151 from the uv to near infraredhave been obtained with stis to study the kinematics and physical conditions inthe nlr. the kinematics show evidence for three components, a low velocitysystem in normal disk rotation, a high velocity system in radial outflow at afew hundred km/s relative to the systemic velocity and an additional highvelocity system also in outflow with velocities up to 1400 km/s, in agreementwith results from stis slitless spectroscopy (hutchings et al., 1998, kaiser etal., 1999, hutchings et al., 1999) we have explored two simple kinematic modelsand suggest that radial outflow in the form of a wind is the most likelyexplanation. we also present evidence indicating that the wind may bedecelerating with distance from the nucleus.  we find that the emission line ratios along our slits are all entirelyconsistent with photoionization from the nuclear continuum source. a decreasein the [oiii]5007/h-beta and [oiii]5007/[oii]3727 ratios suggests that thedensity decreases with distance from the nucleus. this trend is borne out bythe [sii] ratios as well. we find no strong evidence for interaction betweenthe radio jet and the nlr gas in either the kinematics or the emission lineratios in agreement with the results of kaiser et al. (1999) who find nospatial coincidence of nlr clouds and knots in the radio jet. these results arein contrast to other recent studies of nearby agn which find evidence forsignificant interaction between the radio source and the nlr gas.

astro-ph;9910121	stis longslit spectroscopy of the narrow-line region of ngc 4151. ii.  physical conditions along position angle 221 degress	we have examined the physical conditions in the narrow-line region of thewell-studied seyfert galaxy ngc 4151, using long-slit spectra obtained with thehubble space telescope/space telescope imaging spectrograph (hst/stis). thedata were taken along a position angle of 221 degrees, centered on the opticalnucleus. we have generated photoionization models for a contiguous set ofradial zones, out to 2.3 arcsec in projected position to the southwest of thenucleus, and 2.7 arcsec to the northeast. given the uncertainties in thereddening correction, the calculated line ratios successfully matched nearlyall the dereddened ratios. we find that the narrow-line region consists ofdusty atomic gas photoionized by a power-law continuum that has been modifiedby transmission through a mix of low and high ionization gas, specifically uvand x-ray absorbing components. the physical characteristics of the absorbersresemble those observed along our line of sight to the nucleus, although thecolumn density of the x-ray absorber is a factor of ten less than observed. thelarge inferred covering factor of the absorbing gas is in agreement with theresults of our previous study of uv absorption in seyfert 1 galaxies. we findevidence, specifically the suppression of l-alpha, that we are observing theback-end of dusty ionized clouds in the region southwest of the nucleus. sincethese clouds are blueshifted, this supports the interpretation of the cloudkinematics as being due to radial outflow from the nucleus. we find that thenarrow-line gas at each radial position is inhomogeneous, and can be modeled asconsisting of a radiation-bounded component and a more tenuous, matter-boundedcomponent. the density of the narrow-line gas dropswith increasing radialdistance, which confirms our earlier results.

astro-ph;9910547	resolved spectroscopy of the narrow-line region in ngc 1068. i. the  nature of the continuum emission	we present the first long-slit spectra of the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 1068obtained by the space telescope imaging spectrograph (stis); the spectra coverthe wavelength range 1150 - 10,270 angstroms at a spatial resolution of 0.05 -0.1 arcsec and a spectral resolving power of 1000. in this first paper, weconcentrate on the far-uv to near-ir continuum emission from the continuum``hot spot'' and surrounding regions extending out to +/- 6 arcsec (+/-432 pc)at a position angle of 202 degrees in addition to the broad emission linesdetected by spectropolarimetry, the hot spot shows the ``little blue bump'' inthe 2000 - 4000 ang. range, which is due to fe ii and balmer continuumemission. the continuum shape of the hot spot is indistinguishable from that ofngc 4151 and other seyfert 1 galaxies. thus, the hot spot is reflected emissionfrom the hidden nucleus, due to electron scattering (as opposed towavelength-dependent dust scattering). the hot spot is ~0.3 arcsec in extentand accounts for 20% of the scattered light in the inner 500 pc. we are able todeconvolve the extended continuum emission in this region into two components:electron-scattered light from the hidden nucleus (which dominates in the uv)and stellar light (which dominates in the optical and near-ir). the scatteredlight is heavily concentrated towards the hot spot, is stronger in thenortheast, and is enhanced in regions of strong narrow-line emission. thestellar component is more extended, concentrated southwest of the hot spot,dominated by an old (&gt; 2 x 10 gyr) stellar population, and includes a nuclearstellar cluster which is ~200 pc in extent.

astro-ph;9910548	resolved spectroscopy of the narrow-line region in ngc 1068. ii.  physical conditions near the ngc 1068 ``hot-spot''	the physical conditions near the optical continuum peak (``hot spot'') in theinner narrow line region (nlr) of the seyfert 2 galaxy, ngc 1068. spectra weretaken with hst/stis through the 0.1x52 arcsec slit, covering the full stis 1200to 10000 angstrom waveband, and are from a region that includes the hot spot,extending 0.2, or ~ 14 pc (for h= 75 km/sec/mpc). perhaps the most strikingfeature of these spectra is the presence of strong coronal emission lines,including [s xii] 7611 which has hitherto only been identified in spectra ofthe solar corona. there is an apparent correlation between ionization energyand velocity of the emission lines with respect to the systemic velocity of thehost galaxy, with the coronal lines blueshifted, most other high excitationlines near systemic, and some of the low ionization lines redshifted. from theresults of our modeling, we find that the emission-line gas consists of threeprincipal components: 1) one in which most of the strong emission-lines, suchas [o iii] 5007, [ne v] 3426, c iv 1550, arise, 2) a more tenuous, highlyionized component, which is the source of the coronal-line emission, and 3) acomponent, which is not co-planar with the other two, in which the lowionization and neutral lines, such as [n ii] 6548 and [o i] 6300, are formed.the first two components are directly ionized by the euv-xray continuum emittedby the central source, while the low ionization gas is ionized by a combinationof highly absorbed continuum radiation and a small fraction of unabsorbedcontinuum scattered by free electrons associated with the hot spot. thecombination of covering factor and thomson optical depth of the high ionizationcomponents is insufficient to scatter the observed fraction of continuumradiation into our line-of-sight.
