0901.0551	the newfirm medium-band survey: filter definitions and first results	deep near-infrared imaging surveys allow us to select and study distantgalaxies in the rest-frame optical, and have transformed our understanding ofthe early universe. as the vast majority of k- or irac-selected galaxies is toofaint for spectroscopy, the interpretation of these surveys relies almostexclusively on photometric redshifts determined from fitting templates to thebroad-band photometry. the best-achieved accuracy of these redshiftsdelta(z)/(1+z) ~ 0.06 at z&gt;1.5, which is sufficient for determining the broadcharacteristics of the galaxy population but not for measuring accuraterest-frame colors, stellar population parameters, or the local galaxy density.we have started a near-infrared imaging survey with the newfirm camera on thekitt peak 4m telescope to greatly improve the accuracy of photometric redshiftsin the range 1.5&lt;z&lt;3.5. the survey uses five medium-bandwidth filters, whichprovide crude "spectra" over the wavelength range 1-1.8 micron for all objectsin the 27.6 x 27.6 arcmin newfirm field. in this first paper, we illustrate thetechnique by showing medium band newfirm photometry of several galaxies at1.7&lt;z&lt;2.7 from the near-infrared spectroscopic sample of kriek et al. (2008).the filters unambiguously pinpoint the location of the redshifted balmer breakin these galaxies, enabling very accurate redshift measurements. the fullsurvey will provide similar data for ~8000 faint k-selected galaxies at z&gt;1.5in the cosmos and aegis fields. the filter set also enables efficient selectionof exotic objects such as high redshift quasars, galaxies dominated by emissionlines, and very cool brown dwarfs; we show that late t and candidate "y" dwarfscould be identified using only two of the filters.

0905.1692	an ultra-deep near-infrared spectrum of a compact quiescent galaxy at  z=2.2	several recent studies have shown that about half of the massive galaxies atz~2 are in a quiescent phase. moreover, these galaxies are commonly found to beultra-compact with half-light radii of ~1 kpc. we have obtained a ~29 hrspectrum of a typical quiescent, ultra-dense galaxy at z=2.1865 with the gemininear-infrared spectrograph. the spectrum exhibits a strong optical break andseveral absorption features, which have not previously been detected in z&gt;2quiescent galaxies. comparison of the spectral energy distribution with stellarpopulation synthesis models implies a low star formation rate (sfr) of 1-3msol/yr, an age of 1.3-2.2 gyr, and a stellar mass of ~2x10^11 msol. we detectseveral faint emission lines, with emission-line ratios of [nii]/halpha,[sii]/halpha and [oii]/[oiii] typical of low-ionization nuclear emission-lineregions. thus, neither the stellar continuum nor the nebular emission impliesactive star formation. the current sfr is &lt;1% of the past average sfr. if thisgalaxy is representative of compact quiescent galaxies beyond z=2, it impliesthat quenching of star formation is extremely efficient and also indicates thatlow luminosity active galactic nuclei (agns) could be common in these objects.nuclear emission is a potential concern for the size measurement. however, weshow that the agn contributes &lt;8% to the rest-frame optical emission. apossible post-starburst population may affect size measurements more strongly;although a 0.5 gyr old stellar population can make up &lt;10% of the total stellarmass, it could account for up to ~40% of the optical light. nevertheless, thisspectrum shows that this compact galaxy is dominated by an evolved stellarpopulation.

0905.2411	color distributions, number and mass densities of massive galaxies at  1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3: comparing observations with merger simulations	we present a comparison between the observed color distribution, number andmass density of massive galaxies at 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3 and a model by hopkins et al.that relates the quasar and galaxy population on the basis of gas-rich mergers.in order to test the hypothesis that quiescent red galaxies are formed after agas-rich merger involving quasar activity, we confront photometry of massive (m&gt; 4x10^10 msun) galaxies extracted from the fires, goods-south, and musycsurveys, together spanning an area of 496 arcmin^2, with synthetic photometryfrom hydrodynamical merger simulations. as in the hopkins et al. (2006b) model,we use the observed quasar luminosity function to estimate the merger rate. wefind that the synthetic u-v and v-j colors of galaxies that had a quasar phasein their past match the colors of observed galaxies that are best characterizedby a quiescent stellar population. at z ~ 2.6, the observed number and massdensity of quiescent red galaxies with m &gt; 4x10^10 msun is consistent with themodel in which every quiescent massive galaxy underwent a quasar phase in thepast. at z ~ 1.9, 2.8 times less quiescent galaxies are observed than predictedby the model as descendants of higher redshift quasars. the merger model alsopredicts a large number of galaxies undergoing merger-driven star formation. wefind that the predicted number and mass density accounts for 30-50% of theobserved massive star-forming galaxies. however, their colors do not matchthose of observed star-forming galaxies. in particular, the colors of dusty redgalaxies are not reproduced by the simulations. several possible origins ofthis discrepancy are discussed. the observational constraints on the validityof the model are currently limited by cosmic variance and uncertainties instellar population synthesis and radiative transfer.

0906.4786	the evolving relations between size, mass, surface density, and star  formation in 3x10^4 galaxies since z=2	the presence of massive, compact, quiescent galaxies at z&gt;2 presents a majorchallenge for theoretical models of galaxy formation and evolution. using oneof the deepest large public near-ir surveys to date, we investigate in detailthe correlations between star formation and galaxy structural parameters (size,stellar mass, and surface density) from z=2 to the present. at all redshifts,massive quiescent galaxies (i.e. those with little or no star formation) occupythe extreme high end of the surface density distribution and follow a tightmass-size correlation, while star-forming galaxies show a broad range of bothdensities and sizes. conversely, galaxies with the highest surface densitiescomprise a nearly-homogeneous population with little or no ongoing starformation, while less dense galaxies exhibit high star-formation rates andvarying levels of dust obscuration. both the sizes and surface densities ofquiescent galaxies evolve strongly from z=2-0; we parameterize this evolutionfor both populations with simple power law functions and present best-fitparameters for comparison to future theoretical models. higher-mass quiescentgalaxies undergo faster structural evolution, consistent with previous results.interestingly, star-forming galaxies' sizes and densities evolve at ratessimilar to those of quiescent galaxies. it is therefore possible that the samephysical processes drive the structural evolution of both populations,suggesting that "dry mergers" may not be the sole culprit in this sizeevolution.

0909.3517	the stellar mass density and specific star formation rate of the  universe at z~7	we use a robust sample of 11 z~7 galaxies (z-dropouts) to estimate thestellar mass density of the universe when it was only ~750 myr old. we combinethe very deep optical to near-infrared photometry from the hst acs and nicmoscameras with mid-infrared spitzer irac imaging available through the goodsprogram. after carefully removing the flux from contaminating foregroundsources we have obtained reliable photometry in the 3.6 and 4.5 micron iracchannels. the spectral shapes of these sources, including their rest frameoptical colors, strongly support their being at z~7 with a mean photometricredshift of &lt;z&gt;=7.2+/-0.5. we use bruzual &amp; charlot (2003) synthetic stellarpopulation models to constrain their stellar masses and star formationhistories. we find stellar masses that range over 0.1 -12x10^9 m_sol andaverage ages from 20 myr to up to 425 myr with a mean of ~300 myr, suggestingthat in some of these galaxies most of the stars were formed at z&gt;8 (andprobably at z&gt;~10). the best fits to the observed seds are consistent withlittle or no dust extinction, in agreement with recent results at z~4-8. thestar formation rates (sfr) are in the range from 5-20 m_sol/yr. from thissample we measure a stellar mass density of 6.6_{-3.3}^{+5.4}x10^5 m_sol/mpc^3to a limit of m_{uv,ab}&lt;-20 (or 0.4 l*(z=3)). combined with a fiducial lowerlimit for their ages (80 myr) this implies a maximum sfr density of 0.008m_sol/yr/mpc^3. this is well below the critical level needed to reionize theuniverse at z~8 using standard assumptions. however, this result is based onluminous sources (&gt;l*) and does not include the dominant contribution of thefainter galaxies. strikingly, we find that the specific sfr is constant fromz~7 to z~2 but drops substantially at more recent times.

0910.1836	optical spectroscopy of distant red galaxies	we present optical spectroscopic follow-up of a sample of distant redgalaxies (drgs) with k &lt; 22.5 (vega), selected by j-k &gt; 2.3, in the hubble deepfield south, the ms 1054-03 field, and the chandra deep field south.spectroscopic redshifts were obtained for 15 drgs. only 2 out of 15 drgs arelocated at z &lt; 2, suggesting a high efficiency to select high-redshift sources.  from other spectroscopic surveys in the cdfs targeting intermediate to highredshift populations selected with different criteria, we find spectroscopicredshifts for a further 30 drgs. we use the sample of spectroscopicallyconfirmed drgs to establish the high quality (scatter in \delta z/(1+z) of ~0.05) of their photometric redshifts in the considered deep fields, as derivedwith eazy (brammer et al. 2008). combining the spectroscopic and photometricredshifts, we find that 74% of drgs with k &lt; 22.5 lie at z &gt; 2. the combinedspectroscopic and photometric sample is used to analyze the distinct intrinsicand observed properties of drgs at z &lt; 2 and z &gt; 2. in our photometric sampleto k &lt; 22.5, low-redshift drgs are brighter in k than high-redshift drgs by 0.7mag, and more extincted by 1.2 mag in av. our analysis shows that the drgcriterion selects galaxies with different properties at different redshifts.such biases can be largely avoided by selecting galaxies based on theirrest-frame properties, which requires very good multi-band photometry and highquality photometric redshifts.

0912.0514	the growth of massive galaxies since z=2	we study the growth of massive galaxies from z=2 to the present using datafrom the newfirm medium band survey. the sample is selected at a constantnumber density of n=2x10^-4 mpc^-3, so that galaxies at different epochs can becompared in a meaningful way. we show that the stellar mass of galaxies at thisnumber density has increased by a factor of ~2 since z=2, following therelation log(m)=11.45-0.15z. in order to determine at what physical radii thismass growth occurred we construct very deep stacked rest-frame r-band images atredshifts z=0.6, 1.1, 1.6, and 2.0. these image stacks of typically 70-80galaxies enable us to characterize the stellar distribution to surfacebrightness limits of ~28.5 mag/arcsec^2. we find that massive galaxiesgradually built up their outer regions over the past 10 gyr. the mass within aradius of r=5 kpc is nearly constant with redshift whereas the mass at 5-75 kpchas increased by a factor of ~4 since z=2. parameterizing the surfacebrightness profiles we find that the effective radius and sersic n parameterevolve as r_e~(1+z)^-1.3 and n~(1+z)^-1.0 respectively. the data demonstratethat massive galaxies have grown mostly inside-out, assembling their extendedstellar halos around compact, dense cores with possibly exponential radialdensity distributions. comparing the observed mass evolution to the averagestar formation rates of the galaxies we find that the growth is likelydominated by mergers, as in-situ star formation can only account for ~20% ofthe mass build-up from z=2 to z=0. the main uncertainties in this study arepossible redshift-dependent systematic errors in the total stellar masses andthe conversion from light-weighted to mass-weighted radial profiles.

1003.1706	z~7 galaxy candidates from nicmos observations over the hdf south and  the cdf-s and hdf-n goods fields	we use ~88 arcmin**2 of deep (&gt;~26.5 mag at 5 sigma) nicmos data over the twogoods fields and the hdf south to conduct a search for bright z&gt;~7 galaxycandidates. this search takes advantage of an efficient preselection over 58arcmin**2 of nicmos h-band data where only plausible z&gt;~7 candidates arefollowed up with nicmos j-band observations. ~248 arcmin**2 of deepground-based near-infrared data (&gt;~25.5 mag, 5 sigma) is also considered in thesearch. in total, we report 15 z-dropout candidates over this area -- 7 ofwhich are new to these search fields. two possible z~9 j-dropout candidates arealso found, but seem unlikely to correspond to z~9 galaxies. the present z~9search is used to set upper limits on the prevalence of such sources. rigoroustesting is undertaken to establish the level of contamination of our selectionsby photometric scatter, low mass stars, supernovae (sne), and spurious sources.the estimated contamination rate of our z~7 selection is ~24%. through carefulsimulations, the effective volume available to our z&gt;~7 selections is estimatedand used to establish constraints on the volume density of luminous (l*(z=3),or -21 mag) galaxies from these searches. we find that the volume density ofluminous star-forming galaxies at z~7 is 13_{-5}^{+8}x lower than at z~4 and&gt;25x lower (1 sigma) at z~9 than at z~4. this is the most stringent constraintyet available on the volume density of &gt;~l* galaxies at z~9. the presentwide-area, multi-field search limits cosmic variance to &lt;20%. the evolution wefind at the bright end of the uv lf is similar to that found from recent subarusuprime-cam, hawk-i or ers wfc3/ir searches. the present paper also includes acomplete summary of our final z~7 z-dropout sample (18 candidates) identifiedfrom all nicmos observations to date (over the two goods fields, the hudf,galaxy clusters).

1003.3479	well-sampled far-infrared spectral energy distributions of z ~ 2  galaxies: evidence for scaled up cool galaxies	we present an analysis of the far-infrared (fir) spectral energydistributions (seds) of two massive k-selected galaxies at z = 2.122 and z =2.024 detected at 24um, 70um, 160um by spitzer, 250um, 350um, 500um by blast,and 870um by apex. the large wavelength range of these observations and theavailability of spectroscopic redshifts allow us to unambiguously identify thepeak of the redshifted thermal emission from dust at ~ 300um. the seds of bothgalaxies are reasonably well fit by synthetic templates of local galaxies withl_ir ~ 10^{11} l_{sun} -- 10^{12} l_{sun} yet both galaxies have l_{ir} ~10^{13} l_{sun}. this suggests that these galaxies are not high redshiftanalogues of the hyper-lirgs/ulirgs used in local templates, but are instead"scaled up" versions of local ulirgs/lirgs. for both galaxies the starformation rate determined from the best-fit fir seds (sfr(l_{ir})) agrees withthe sfr determined from the dust corrected h-alpha luminosity (sfr(h-alpha)) towithin a factor of ~ 2; however, when the sfr of these galaxies is estimatedusing only the observed 24um flux and the standard luminosity-dependenttemplate method (sfr(24um)), it systematically overestimates the sfr by as muchas a factor of 6. a larger sample of 24 k-selected galaxies at z ~ 2.3 drawnfrom the kriek et al. (2008) gnirs sample shows the same trend betweensfr(24um) and sfr(h-alpha). using that sample we show that sfr(24um) andsfr(h-alpha) are in better agreement when sfr(24um) is estimated using the logaverage of local templates rather than selecting a single luminosity-dependenttemplate, because this incorporates lower luminosity templates. the betteragreement between sfrs from lower luminosity templates suggests that the firseds of the blast-detected galaxies may be typical for massive galaxies at z ~2, and that the majority are scaled up versions of lower luminosity localgalaxies.

1004.1411	confirmation of the compactness of a z=1.91 quiescent galaxy with hubble  space telescope's wide field camera 3	we present very deep wide field camera 3 (wfc3) photometry of a massive,compact galaxy located in the hubble ultra deep field. this quiescent galaxyhas a spectroscopic redshift z=1.91 and has been identified as an extremelycompact galaxy by daddi et al. 2005. we use new h-f160w imaging data obtainedwith hubble space telescope/wfc3 to measure the deconvolved surface brightnessprofile to h = 28 mag arcsec**-2. we find that the surface brightness profileis well approximated by an n=3.7 sersic profile. our deconvolved profile isconstructed by a new technique which corrects the best-fit sersic profile withthe residual of the fit to the observed image. this allows for galaxy profileswhich deviate from a sersic profile. we determine the effective radius of thisgalaxy: r_e=0.42 +- 0.14 kpc in the observed h-f160w-band. we show that thisresult is robust to deviations from the sersic model used in the fit. we testthe sensitivity of our analysis to faint "wings" in the profile using simulatedgalaxy images consisting of a bright compact component and a faint extendedcomponent. we find that due to the combination of the wfc3 imaging depth andour method's sensitivity to extended faint emission we can accurately trace theintrinsic surface brightness profile, and that we can therefore confidentlyrule out the existence of a faint extended envelope around the observed galaxydown to our surface brightness limit. these results confirm that the galaxylies a factor of 10 off from the local mass-size relation.

1008.3901	evolution of galaxy stellar mass functions, mass densities, and mass to  light ratios from z 7 to z 4	we derive stellar masses from sed fitting to rest-frame optical and uv fluxesfor 401 star-forming galaxies at z 4, 5, and 6 from hubble-wfc3/ir observationsof the ers combined with the deep goods-s spitzer/irac data (and include apreviously-published z 7 sample). a mass-luminosity relation with stronglyluminosity-dependent m/luv ratios is found for the largest sample (299galaxies) at z 4. the relation m \propto l_{uv,1500}^(1.7+/-0.2) has awell-determined intrinsic sample variance of 0.5 dex. this relation is alsoconsistent with the more limited samples at z 5-7. this z 4 mass-luminosityrelation, and the well-established faint uv luminosity functions at z 4-7, areused to derive galaxy mass functions (mf) to masses m~10^8 at z 4-7. a bootstapapproach is used to derive the mfs to account for the large scatter in them--luv relation and the luminosity function uncertainties, along with ananalytical crosscheck. the mfs are also corrected for the effects ofincompleteness. the incompleteness-corrected mfs are steeper than previouslyfound, with slopes \alpha_m-1.4 to -1.6 at low masses. these slopes are,however, still substantially flatter than the mfs obtained from recenthydrodynamical simulations. we use these mfs to estimate the stellar massdensity (smd) of the universe to a fixed m_{uv,ab}&lt;-18 as a function ofredshift and find a smd growth \propto(1+z)^{-3.4 +/-0.8} from z 7 to z 4. wealso derive the smd from the completeness-corrected mfs to a mass limitm~10^{8} msun. such completeness-corrected mfs and the derived smds will beparticularly important for model comparisons as future mfs reach to lowermasses.

1008.4357	the spectral energy distribution of post-starburst galaxies in the  newfirm medium-band survey: a low contribution from tp-agb stars	stellar population synthesis (sps) models are a key ingredient of many galaxyevolution studies. unfortunately, the models are still poorly calibrated forcertain stellar evolution stages. of particular concern is the treatment of thethermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (tp-agb) phase, as differentimplementations lead to systematic differences in derived galaxy properties.post-starburst galaxies are a promising calibration sample, as tp-agb stars arethought to be most prominently visible during this phase. here, we usepost-starburst galaxies in the newfirm medium-band survey to assess differentsps models. the available photometry allows the selection of a homogeneous andwell-defined sample of 62 post-starburst galaxies at 0.7&lt;z&lt;2.0, from which weconstruct a well-sampled composite spectral energy distribution (sed) over therange 1200-40 000 angstrom. the sed is well-fit by the bruzual &amp; charlot spsmodels, while the maraston models do not reproduce the rest-frame optical andnear-infrared parts of the sed simultaneously. when the fitting is restrictedto lambda &lt; 6000 angstrom, the maraston models overpredict the near-infraredluminosity, implying that these models give too much weight to tp-agb stars.using the flexible sps models by conroy et al, and assuming solar metallicity,we find that the contribution of tp-agb stars to the integrated sed is a factorof ~3 lower than predicted by the latest padova tp-agb models. whether this isdue to lower bolometric luminosities, shorter lifetimes, and/or heavy dustobscuration of tp-agb stars remains to be addressed. altogether, our datademand a low contribution from tp-agb stars to the sed of post-starburstgalaxies.

1009.0269	the most massive galaxies at 3.0&lt;z&lt;4.0 in the newfirm medium-band  survey: properties and improved constraints on the stellar mass function	[abridged] we use the newfirm medium-band survey (nmbs) to characterize theproperties of a mass-complete sample of 14 galaxies at 3.0&lt;z&lt;4.0 withm_star&gt;2.5x10^11 msun, and to derive more accurate measurements of thehigh-mass end of the stellar mass function (smf) of galaxies at z=3.5, withsignificantly reduced contributions from photometric redshift errors and cosmicvariance to the total error budget of the smf. the typical very massive galaxyat z=3.5 is red and faint in the observer's optical, with median r=26.1, andrest-frame u-v=1.6. about 60% of the sample have optical colors satisfyingeither the u- or the b-dropout color criteria, although ~50% of these galaxieshave r&gt;25.5. about 30% of the sample has sfrs from sed modeling consistent withzero. however, &gt;80% of the sample is detected at 24 micron, with total infraredluminosities in the range (0.5-4.0)x10^13 lsun. this implies the presence ofeither dust-enshrouded starburst activity (with sfrs of 600-4300 msun/yr)and/or highly-obscured active galactic nuclei (agn). the contribution ofgalaxies with m_star&gt;2.5x10^11 msun to the total stellar mass budget at z=3.5is ~8%. we find an evolution by a factor of 2-7 and 3-22 from z~5 and z~6,respectively, to z=3.5. the previously found disagreement at the high-mass endbetween observed and model-predicted smfs is now significant at the 3sigmalevel. however, systematic uncertainties dominate the total error budget, witherrors up to a factor of ~8 in the densities, bringing the observed smf inmarginal agreement with the predicted smf. additional systematic uncertaintieson the high-mass end could be introduced by either 1) the intensestar-formation and/or the very common agn activities as inferred from the mips24 micron detections, and/or 2) contamination by a significant population ofmassive, old, and dusty galaxies at z~2.6.

0709.0946	the warm spitzer mission: prospects for studies of the distant universe	irac excels at detecting distant objects. due to a combination of the shapesof the spectral energy distributions of galaxies and the low backgroundachieved from space, irac reaches greater depth in comparable exposure time at3.6 and 4.5 micron than any ground- or space-based facility currently can at2.2 micron. furthermore, the longer wavelengths probed by irac enable studiesof the rest-frame optical and near-infrared light of galaxies and agn to muchhigher redshift than is possible from the ground. this white paper explores themerits of different survey strategies for studying the distant universe duringthe warm mission. a three-tiered approach serves a wide range of science goalsand uses the spacecraft effectively: 1) an ultra-deep survey of ~0.04 squaredegrees to a depth of ~250 hrs (in conjunction with an hst/wfc3 program), tostudy the universe at 7&lt;z&lt;14; 2) a survey of ~2 square degrees to the goodsdepth of 20 hrs, to identify luminous galaxies at z&gt;6 and characterize therelation between the build-up of dark matter halos and their constituentgalaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;6, and 3) a 500 square degree survey to the swire depth of 120s, to systematically study large scale structure at 1&lt;z&lt;2 and characterize highredshift agn. one or more of these programs could conceivably be implemented bythe ssc, following the example of the hubble deep field campaigns. aspriorities in this field continuously shift it is also crucial that a fractionof the exposure time remains unassigned, thus enabling science that willreflect the frontiers of 2010 and beyond rather than those of 2007.

1103.0279	halpha and 4000 angstrom break measurements for ~3500 k-selected  galaxies at 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.0	we measure spectral features of ~3500 k-selected galaxies at 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.0 fromhigh quality medium-band photometry using a new technique. first, we divide thegalaxy sample in 32 subsamples based on the similarities between the fullspectral energy distributions (seds) of the galaxies. for each of these 32galaxy types we construct a composite sed by de-redshifting and scaling theobserved photometry. this approach increases the signal-to-noise ratio andsampling of galaxy seds and allows for model-independent stellar populationstudies. the composite seds are of spectroscopic quality, and facilitate -- forthe first time -- halpha measurement for a large magnitude-limited sample ofdistant galaxies. the linewidths indicate a photometric redshift uncertainty ofdz&lt;0.02x(1+z). the composite seds also show the balmer and 4000 angstrombreaks, mgii absorption at ~2800 angstrom, the dust absorption feature at 2175angstrom, and blended [oiii]+hbeta emission. we compare the total equivalentwidth of halpha, [nii], and [sii] (w_halpha+) with the strength of the 4000angstrom break (d(4000)) and the best-fit specific star formation rate, andfind that all these properties are strongly correlated. this is a reassuringresult, as currently most distant stellar population studies are based on justcontinuum emission. furthermore, the relation between w_halpha+ and dn(4000)provides interesting clues to the sfhs of galaxies, as these features aresensitive to different stellar ages. we find that the correlation betweenw_halpha+ and d(4000) at 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.0 is similar to z~0, and that the suppressionof star formation in galaxies at z&lt;2 is generally not abrupt, but a gradualprocess.

1106.1641	morphological evolution of galaxies from ultradeep hst wfc3 imaging: the  hubble sequence at z~2	we use ultradeep hst wfc3/ir imaging of the hudf to investigate therest-frame optical morphologies of a mass-selected sample of galaxies at z~2.we find a large variety of galaxy morphologies, ranging from large, blue,disk-like galaxies to compact, red, early-type galaxies. we derive rest-frameu-g color profiles for these galaxies and show that most z~2 galaxies in oursample have negative color gradients such that their cores are red. althoughthese color gradients may partly be caused by radial variations in dustcontent, they point to the existence of older stellar populations in thecenters of z~2 galaxies. this result is consistent with an "inside-out"scenario of galaxy growth. we find that the median color gradient is fairlyconstant with redshift: [delta(u-g_{rest})/delta(log r)]_{median} = -0.46,-0.44 and -0.49 for z~2, z~1 and z=0, respectively. using structural parametersderived from surface brightness profiles we confirm that at z~2 galaxymorphology correlates well with specific star formation rate. at the same mass,star forming galaxies have larger effective radii, bluer rest-frame u-g colorsand lower sersic indices than quiescent galaxies. these correlations are verysimilar to those at lower redshift, suggesting that the relations that giverise to the hubble sequence at z=0 are already in place for massive galaxies atthis early epoch.

1108.6060	first results from the 3d-hst survey: the striking diversity of massive  galaxies at z&gt;1	we present first results from the 3d-hst program, a near-ir spectroscopicsurvey performed with the wide field camera 3 on the hubble space telescope. wehave used 3d-hst spectra to measure redshifts and halpha equivalent widths fora stellar mass-limited sample of 34 galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;1.5 with m(stellar)&gt;10^11m(sun) in the cosmos, goods, and aegis fields. we find that a substantialfraction of massive galaxies at this epoch are forming stars at a high rate:the fraction of galaxies with halpha equivalent widths &gt;10 a is 59%, comparedto 10% among sdss galaxies of similar masses at z=0.1. galaxies with weakhalpha emission show absorption lines typical of 2-4 gyr old stellarpopulations. the structural parameters of the galaxies, derived from theassociated wfc3 f140w imaging data, correlate with the presence of halpha:quiescent galaxies are compact with high sersic index and high inferredvelocity dispersion, whereas star-forming galaxies are typically largetwo-armed spiral galaxies, with low sersic index. some of these star forminggalaxies might be progenitors of the most massive s0 and sa galaxies. ourresults challenge the idea that galaxies at fixed mass form a homogeneouspopulation with small scatter in their properties. instead we find that massivegalaxies form a highly diverse population at z&gt;1, in marked contrast to thelocal universe.

1110.6441	the rest frame uv to optical colors and seds of z~4-7 galaxies	we use the ultra-deep hudf09 and the deep ers data from the hst wfc3/ircamera, along with the wide area spitzer/irac data from goods-s to derive sedsof star-forming galaxies from the rest-frame uv to the optical over a wideluminosity range (m_1500 ~ -21 to m_1500 ~ -18) from z ~ 7 to z ~ 4. the samplecontains ~ 400 z ~ 4, ~ 120 z ~ 5, ~ 60 z ~ 6, and 36 prior z ~ 7 galaxies.median stacking enables the first comprehensive study of very faint high-zgalaxies at multiple redshifts (e.g., [3.6] = 27.4 +/- 0.1 ab mag for them_1500 ~ -18 sources at z ~ 4). at z ~ 4 our faint median-stacked seds reach to~ 0.06 l*(z=4) and are combined with recently published results at highluminosity l &gt; l* that extend to m_1500 ~ -23. we use the observed seds andtemplate fits to derive rest frame uv-to-optical colors (u - v) at allredshifts and luminosities. we find that this color does not vary significantlywith redshift at a fixed luminosity. the uv-to-optical color does show a weaktrend with luminosity, becoming redder at higher luminosities. this is mostlikely due to dust. at z &gt;~ 5 we find blue colors [3.6]-[4.5] ~ -0.3 mag thatare most likely due to rest-frame optical emission lines contributing to theflux in the irac filter bandpasses. the scatter across our derived seds remainssubstantial, but the results are most consistent with a lack of any evolutionin the seds with redshift at a given luminosity. the similarity of the sedssuggests a self-similar mode of evolution over a timespan from 0.7 gyr to 1.5gyr that encompasses very substantial growth in the stellar mass density in theuniverse (from ~ 4x10^6 to ~ 2x10^7 msun mpc^-3).

0710.3384	spitzer constraints on the stellar populations of lyman-alpha emitting  galaxies at z = 3.1	we investigate the stellar populations of a sample of 162 lyman-alphaemitting galaxies (laes) at z = 3.1 in the extended chandra deep field south,using deep spitzer irac data available from the goods and simple surveys toderive reliable stellar population estimates. we divide the laes according totheir rest-frame near-ir luminosities into irac-detected and irac-undetectedsamples. about 70% of the laes are undetected in 3.6 micron down to [3.6] =25.2 ab. stacking analysis reveals that the average stellar population of theirac-undetected sample has an age of ~ 200 myr and a mass of ~ 3x10^8 solarmasses, consistent with the expectation that laes are mostly young and low-massgalaxies. on the other hand, the irac-detected laes are on averagesignificantly older and more massive, with an average age &gt; 1 gyr and mass ~10^10 solar masses. comparing the irac colors and magnitudes of the laes to z ~3 lyman break galaxies (lbgs) shows that the irac-detected laes lie at thefaint blue end of the lbg color-magnitude distribution, suggesting thatirac-detected laes may be the low mass extension of the lbg population. we alsopresent tentative evidence for a small fraction (~ 5%) of obscured agn withinthe lae sample. our results suggest that laes posses a wide range of ages andmasses. additionally, the presence of evolved stellar populations inside laessuggests that the lyman-alpha luminous phase of galaxies may either be along-lasting or recurring phenomenon.

1112.0313	a large population of massive compact post-starburst galaxies at z&gt;1:  implications for the size evolution and quenching mechanism of quiescent  galaxies	we study the growth of the red sequence through the number density andstructural evolution of a sample of young and old quiescent galaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;2.the galaxies are selected from the newfirm medium-band survey (nmbs) in thecosmic evolution survey (cosmos) field. we find a large population of massiveyoung recently quenched ("post-starburst") galaxies at z&gt;1 that are almostnon-existent at z&lt;1; their number density is 5 x 10^{-5} mpc^{-3} at z=2,whereas it is a factor of 10 less at z=0.5. the observed number densities ofyoung and old quiescent galaxies at z&gt;1 are consistent with a simple model inwhich all old quiescent galaxies were once identified as post-starburstgalaxies. we find that the overall population of quiescent galaxies havesmaller sizes and slightly more elongated shapes at higher redshift, inagreement with other recent studies. interestingly, the most recently quenchedgalaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;2 are not larger, and possibly even smaller, than oldergalaxies at those redshifts. this result is inconsistent with the idea that theevolution of the average size of quiescent galaxies is largely driven bycontinuous transformations of larger, star-forming galaxies: in that case, theyoungest quiescent galaxies would also be the largest. instead, mergers orother mechanisms appear to be required to explain the size growth of quiescentgalaxies from z=2 to the present.

1202.1822	spatially resolved halpha maps and sizes of 57 strongly star-forming  galaxies at z~1 from 3d-hst: evidence for rapid inside-out assembly of disk  galaxies	we investigate the build-up of galaxies at z~1 using maps of halpha andstellar continuum emission for a sample of 57 galaxies with rest-frame halphaequivalent widths &gt;100 angstroms in the 3d-hst grism survey. we find that thehalpha emission broadly follows the rest-frame r-band light but that it istypically somewhat more extended and clumpy. we quantify the spatialdistribution with the half-light radius. the median halpha effective radiusr_e(halpha) is 4.2+-0.1 kpc but the sizes span a large range, from compactobjects with r_e(halpha) ~ 1.0 kpc to extended disks with r_e(halpha) ~ 15 kpc.comparing halpha sizes to continuum sizes, we find&lt;r_e(halpha)/r_e(r)&gt;=1.3+-0.1 for the full sample. that is, star formation, astraced by halpha, typically occurs out to larger radii than the rest-framer-band stellar continuum; galaxies are growing their radii and building up fromthe inside out. this effect appears to be somewhat more pronounced for thelargest galaxies. using the measured halpha sizes, we derive star formationrate surface densities. we find that they range from ~0.05 msun yr^{-1}kpc^{-2} for the largest galaxies to ~5 msun yr^{-1} kpc^{-2} for the smallestgalaxies, implying a large range in physical conditions in rapidly star-formingz~1 galaxies. finally, we infer that all galaxies in the sample have very highgas mass fractions and stellar mass doubling times &lt; 500 myr. although otherexplanations are also possible, a straightforward interpretation is that we aresimultaneously witnessing the rapid formation of compact bulges and large disksat z~1.

1206.2645	halpha equivalent widths from the 3d-hst survey: evolution with redshift  and dependence on stellar mass	we investigate the evolution of the halpha equivalent width, ew(halpha), withredshift and its dependence on stellar mass, taking advantage of the first datafrom the 3d-hst survey, a large spectroscopic treasury program with the hubblespace telescope wfc3. combining our halpha measurements of 854 galaxies at0.8&lt;z&lt;1.5 with those of ground based surveys at lower and higher redshift, wecan consistently determine the evolution of the ew(halpha) distribution fromz=0 to z=2.2. we find that at all masses the characteristic ew(halpha) isdecreasing towards the present epoch, and that at each redshift the ew(halpha)is lower for high-mass galaxies. we measure a slope of ew(halpha) ~ (1+z)^(1.8)with little mass dependence. qualitatively, this measurement is amodel-independent confirmation of the evolution of star forming galaxies withredshift. a quantitative conversion of ew(halpha) to ssfr is very modeldependent, because of differential reddening corrections between the continuumsed and the balmer lines. the observed ew(halpha) can be reproduced with asimple model in which the sfr for galaxies rises to the epoch of z~2.5 and thendecreases with time to z = 0. the model implies that the ew(halpha) rises to400 a at z=8. the ssfr evolves faster than ew(halpha), as the mass-to-lightratio also evolves with redshift. in this context, we find that the ssfrevolves as (1+z)^(3.2), nearly independent of mass, consistent with previousreddening insensitive estimates. we confirm previous results that the observedslope of the ssfr-z relation is steeper than the one predicted by models, butmodels and observations agree in finding little mass dependence.

1207.3795	3d-hst grism spectroscopy of a gravitationally lensed, low-metallicity  starburst galaxy at z=1.847	we present hubble space telescope (hst) imaging and spectroscopy of thegravitational lens sl2sj02176-0513, a cusp arc at z=1.847. the uv continuum ofthe lensed galaxy is very blue, which is seemingly at odds with its redderoptical colors. the 3d-hst wfc3/g141 near-infrared spectrum of the lens revealsthe source of this discrepancy to be extremely strong [oiii]5007 and h-betaemission lines with rest-frame equivalent widths of 2000 +/- 100 and 520 +/- 40angstroms, respectively. the source has a stellar mass ~10^8 msun, ssfr \sim100/gyr, and detection of [oiii]4363 yields a metallicity of 12 + log(o/h) =7.5 +/- 0.2. we identify local blue compact dwarf analogs to sl2sj02176-0513,which are among the most metal-poor galaxies in the sdss. the local analogsresemble the lensed galaxy in many ways, including uv/optical sed, spatialmorphology and emission line equivalent widths and ratios. common tosl2sj02176-0513 and its local counterparts is an upturn at mid-ir wavelengthslikely arising from hot dust heated by starbursts. the emission lines ofsl2sj02176-0513 are spatially resolved owing to the combination of the lens andthe high spatial resolution of hst. the lensed galaxy is composed of two clumpswith combined size r_e \sim 300 pc, and we resolve significant differences inuv color and emission line equivalent width between them. though it hascharacteristics occasionally attributed to active galactic nuclei, we concludethat sl2sj02176-0513 is a low-metallicity star-bursting dwarf galaxy. suchgalaxies will be found in significant numbers in the full 3d-hst grism survey.

1207.6634	the evolution of mass-size relation for lyman break galaxies from z=1 to  z=7	for the first time, we study the evolution of the stellar mass-size relationfor star-forming galaxies from z ~ 4 to z ~ 7 from hubble-wfc3/ir cameraobservations of the hudf and early release science (ers) field. the sizes aremeasured by determining the best fit model to galaxy images in the rest-frame2100 \aa \ with the stellar masses estimated from sed fitting to rest-frameoptical (from spitzer/irac) and uv fluxes. we show that the stellar mass-sizerelation of lyman-break galaxies (lbgs) persists, at least to z ~ 5, and themedian size of lbgs at a given stellar mass increases towards lower redshifts.for galaxies with stellar masses of 9.5&lt;log(m*/msun)&lt;10.4 sizes evolve as$(1+z)^{-1.20\pm0.11}$. this evolution is very similar for galaxies with lowerstellar masses of 8.6&lt;log(m*/msun)&lt;9.5 which is $r_{e} \propto(1+z)^{-1.18\pm0.10}$, in agreement with simple theoretical galaxy formationmodels at high z. our results are consistent with previous measurements of thelbgs mass-size relation at lower redshifts (z ~ 1-3).

1208.4362	slow evolution of the specific star formation rate at z&gt;2: the impact of  dust, emission lines, and a rising star formation history	we measure the evolution of the specific star formation rate (ssfr = sfr /mstellar) between redshift 4 and 6 to investigate the previous reports of"constant" ssfr at z&gt;2. we obtain photometry on a large sample of galaxies atz~4-6 located in the goods-s field that have high quality imaging from hst andspitzer. we have derived stellar masses and star formation rates (sfrs) throughstellar population modeling of their spectral energy distributions (seds). weestimate the dust extinction from the observed uv colors. in the sed fittingprocess we have studied the effects of assuming a star formation history (sfh)both with constant sfr and one where the sfr rises exponentially with time. thelatter sfh is chosen to match the observed evolution of the uv luminosityfunction. we find that neither the mean sfrs nor the mean stellar masses changesignificantly when the rising sfr (rsf) model is assumed instead of theconstant sfr model. when focusing on galaxies with mstar ~ 5x10^9 msun, we findthat the ssfr evolves weakly with redshift (ssfr(z) \propto (1+z)^(0.6+/-0.1)gyr^-1), consistent with previous results and with recent estimates of the ssfrat z~2-3 using similar assumptions. we have also investigated the impact ofoptical emission lines on our results. we estimate that the contribution ofemission lines to the rest-frame optical fluxes is only modest at z~4 and 5 butit could reach ~50% at z~6. when emission lines of this strength are taken intoaccount, the ssfr shows somewhat higher values at high redshifts, according tothe relation ssfr(z) \propto (1+z)^(1.0+/-0.1) gyr^-1, i.e., ~2.3x higher atz~6 than at z~2. however, the observed evolution is substantially weaker thanthat found at z&lt;2 or that expected from current models (which corresponds tossfr(z) \propto (1+z)^(2.5) gyr^-1). -abridged-

1208.4363	the stellar mass structure of massive galaxies from z=0 to z=2.5;  surface density profiles and half-mass radii	we present stellar mass surface density profiles of a mass-selected sample of177 galaxies at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5, obtained using very deep hst optical andnear-infrared data over the goods-south field, including recent candels data.accurate stellar mass surface density profiles have been measured for the firsttime for a complete sample of high-redshift galaxies more massive than 10^10.7m_sun. the key advantage of this study compared to previous work is that thesurface brightness profiles are deconvolved for psf smoothing, allowingaccurate measurements of the structure of the galaxies. the surface brightnessprofiles account for contributions from complex galaxy structures such as ringsand faint outer disks. mass profiles are derived using radial rest-frame u-gcolor profiles and a well-established empirical relation between these colorsand the stellar mass-to-light ratio. we derive stellar half-mass radii from themass profiles, and find that these are on average ~25% smaller than rest-frameg band half-light radii. this average size difference of 25% is the same at allredshifts, and does not correlate with stellar mass, specific star formationrate, effective surface density, sersic index, or galaxy size. although onaverage the difference between half-mass size and half-light size is modest,for approximately 10% of massive galaxies this difference is more than a factortwo. these extreme galaxies are mostly extended, disk-like systems with largecentral bulges. these results are robust, but could be impacted if the centraldust extinction becomes high. alma observations can be used to explore thispossibility. these results provide added support for galaxy growth scenarioswherein massive galaxies at these epochs grow by accretion onto their outerregions.

1211.0280	a strongly-lensed massive ultra-compact quiescent galaxy at z ~ 2.4 in  the cosmos/ultravista field	we report the discovery of a massive ultra-compact quiescent galaxy that hasbeen strongly-lensed into multiple images by a foreground galaxy at z = 0.960.this system was serendipitously discovered as a set of extremely ks-brighthigh-redshift galaxies with red j - ks colors using new data from theultravista yjhks near-infrared survey. the system was also previouslyidentified as an optically-faint lens/source system using the cosmos acsimaging by faure et al. (2008, 2011). photometric redshifts for the threebrightest images of the source galaxy determined from twenty-seven bandphotometry place the source at z = 2.4 +/- 0.1. we provide an updated lensmodel for the system which is a good fit to the positions and morphologies ofthe galaxies in the acs image. the lens model implies that the magnification ofthe three brightest images is a factor of 4 - 5. we use the lens model,combined with the ks-band image to constrain the size and sersic profile of thegalaxy. the best-fit model is an ultra-compact galaxy (re =0.64^{+0.08}_{-0.18} kpc, lensing-corrected), with a sersic profile that isintermediate between a disk and bulge profile (n = 2.2^{+2.3}_{-0.9}). wepresent aperture photometry for the source galaxy images which have beencorrected for flux contamination from the central lens. the best-fit stellarpopulation model is a massive galaxy (log(m_{star}/m_{sol}) =10.8^{+0.1}_{-0.1}, lensing-corrected) with an age of 1.0^{+1.0}_{-0.4} gyr,moderate dust extinction (av = 0.8^{+0.5}_{-0.6}), and a low specific starformation rate (log(ssfr) &lt; -11.0 yr^{-1}). this is typical of massive"red-and-dead" galaxies at this redshift and confirms that this source is thefirst bona fide strongly-lensed massive ultra-compact quiescent galaxy to bediscovered. we conclude with a discussion of the prospects of finding a largersample of these galaxies.

1301.0320	the radial distribution of star formation in galaxies at z~1 from the  3d-hst survey	the assembly of galaxies can be described by the distribution of their starformation as a function of cosmic time. thanks to the wfc3 grism on hst it isnow possible to measure this beyond the local universe. here we present thespatial distribution of halpha emission for a sample of 54 stronglystar-forming galaxies at z~1 in the 3d-hst treasury survey. by stacking thehalpha emission we find that star formation occurred in approximatelyexponential distributions at z~1, with median sersic index of n=1.0+-0.2. thestacks are elongated with median axis ratios of b/a=0.58+-0.09 in halpha,consistent with (possibly thick) disks at random orientation angles. keckspectra obtained for a subset of eight of the galaxies show clear evidence forrotation, with inclination-corrected velocities of 90 to 330 km/s. the moststraightforward interpretation of our results is that star formation instrongly star-forming galaxies at z~1 generally occurred in disks. the disksappear to be "scaled-up" versions of nearby spiral galaxies: they haveew(halpha)~100 angstroms out to the solar orbit and they have star formationsurface densities above the threshold for driving galactic scale winds.

1304.2391	the assembly of milky way-like galaxies since z~2.5	galaxies with the mass of the milky way dominate the stellar mass density ofthe universe but it is uncertain how and when they were assembled. here westudy progenitors of these galaxies out to z=2.5, using data from the 3d-hstand candels treasury surveys. we find that galaxies with present-day stellarmasses of log(m)~10.7 built ~90% of their stellar mass since z=2.5, with mostof the star formation occurring before z=1. in marked contrast to the assemblyhistory of massive elliptical galaxies, mass growth is not limited to largeradii: the mass in the central 2 kpc of the galaxies increased by a factor of3.2+-0.8 between z=2.5 and z=1. we therefore rule out simple models in whichbulges were fully assembled at high redshift and disks gradually formed aroundthem. instead, bulges (and black holes) likely formed in lockstep with disks,through bar instabilities, migration, or other processes. we find that afterz=1 the growth in the central regions gradually stopped and the disk continuedto build, consistent with recent studies of the gas distributions in z~1galaxies and the properties of many spiral galaxies today.

1305.1943	quiescent galaxies in the 3d-hst survey: spectroscopic confirmation of a  large number of galaxies with relatively old stellar populations at z~2	quiescent galaxies at z~2 have been identified in large numbers based onrest-frame colors, but only a small number of these galaxies have beenspectroscopically confirmed to show that their rest-frame optical spectra showeither strong balmer or metal absorption lines. here, we median stack therest-frame optical spectra for 171 photometrically-quiescent galaxies at 1.4 &lt;z &lt; 2.2 from the 3d-hst grism survey. in addition to hbeta (4861a), weunambiguously identify metal absorption lines in the stacked spectrum,including the g-band (4304a), mg i (5175a), and na i (5894a). this findingdemonstrates that galaxies with relatively old stellar populations alreadyexisted when the universe was ~3 gyr old, and that rest-frame color selectiontechniques can efficiently select them. we find an average age of 1.3^0.1_0.3gyr when fitting a simple stellar population to the entire stack. we confirmour previous result from medium-band photometry that the stellar age varieswith the colors of quiescent galaxies: the reddest 80% of galaxies aredominated by metal lines and have a relatively old mean age of 1.6^0.5_0.4 gyr,whereas the bluest (and brightest) galaxies have strong balmer lines and aspectroscopic age of 0.9^0.2_0.1 gyr. although the spectrum is dominated by anevolved stellar population, we also find [oiii] and hbeta emission.interestingly, this emission is more centrally concentrated than the continuumwith l_[oiii] = 1.7 +/- 0.3 x 10^40 erg s^-1, indicating residual central starformation or nuclear activity.

0801.1110	a near-infrared spectroscopic survey of k-selected galaxies at z~2.3:  redshifts and implications for broadband photometric studies	using the gemini near-infrared spectrograph (gnirs), we have completed anear-infrared spectroscopic survey for k-bright galaxies at z~2.3, selectedfrom the musyc survey. we derived spectroscopic redshifts from emission linesor from continuum features and shapes for all 36 observed galaxies. thecontinuum redshifts are driven by the balmer/4000 angstrom break, and have anuncertainty in dz/(1+z) of &lt;0.019. we use this unique sample to determine, forthe first time, how accurately redshifts and other properties of massivehigh-redshift galaxies can be determined from broadband photometric data alone.we find that the photometric redshifts of the galaxies in our sample have asystematic error of 0.08 and a random error of 0.13 in dz/(1+z). the systematicerror can be reduced by using optimal templates and deep photometry; the randomerror, however, will be hard to reduce below 5%. the spectra lead tosignificantly improved constraints for stellar population parameters. for mostquantities this improvement is about equally driven by the higher spectralresolution and by the much reduced redshift uncertainty. properties such as theage, a_v, current star formation rate, and the star formation history aregenerally very poorly constrained with broadband data alone. interestinglystellar masses and mass-to-light ratios are among the most stable parametersfrom broadband data. nevertheless, photometric studies may overestimate thenumber of massive galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;3, and thus underestimate the evolution ofthe stellar mass density. finally,the spectroscopy supports our previousfinding that red galaxies dominate the high-mass end of the galaxy populationat z=2-3.

1308.4132	how dead are dead galaxies? mid-infrared fluxes of quiescent galaxies at  redshift 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 2.5: implications for star formation rates and dust  heating	we investigate the star formation rates of quiescent galaxies at highredshift (0.3 &lt; z &lt; 2.5) using 3d-hst wfc3 grism spectroscopy and spitzermid-infrared data. we select quiescent galaxies on the basis of the widely useduvj color-color criteria. spectral energy distribution fitting (rest frameoptical and near-ir) indicates very low star formation rates for quiescentgalaxies (ssfr ~ 10^-12 yr^-1). however, sed fitting can miss star formation ifit is hidden behind high dust obscuration and ionizing radiation is re-emittedin the mid-infrared. it is therefore fundamental to measure the dust-obscuredsfrs with a mid-ir indicator. we stack the mips-24um images of quiescentobjects in five redshift bins centered on z = 0.5, 0.9, 1.2, 1.7, 2.2 andperform aperture photometry. including direct 24um detections, we find ssfr ~10^-11.9 * (1+z)^4 yr^-1. these values are higher than those indicated by sedfitting, but at each redshift they are 20-40 times lower than those of typicalstar forming galaxies. the true sfrs of quiescent galaxies might be even lower,as we show that the mid-ir fluxes can be due to processes unrelated to ongoingstar formation, such as cirrus dust heated by old stellar populations andcircumstellar dust. our measurements show that star formation quenching is veryefficient at every redshift. the measured sfr values are at z &gt; 1.5 marginallyconsistent with the ones expected from gas recycling (assuming that mass lossfrom evolved stars refuels star formation) and well above that at lowerredshifts.

1309.5972	galaxy stellar mass functions from zfourge/candels: an excess of  low-mass galaxies since z=2 and the rapid buildup of quiescent galaxies	using observations from the fourstar galaxy evolution survey (zfourge), weobtain the deepest measurements to date of the galaxy stellar mass function at0.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5. zfourge provides well-constrained photometric redshifts madepossible through deep medium-bandwidth imaging at 1-2um . we combine this withhst imaging from the cosmic assembly near-ir deep extragalactic legacy survey(candels), allowing for the efficient selection of both blue and red galaxiesdown to stellar masses ~10^9.5 msol at z ~ 2.5. the total surveyed area is 316arcmin^2 distributed over three independent fields. we supplement these datawith the wider and shallower newfirm medium-band survey (nmbs) to providestronger constraints at high masses. several studies at z&lt;=1 have revealed asteepening of the slope at the low-mass end of the stellar mass function (smf),leading to an upturn at masses &lt;10^10 msol that is not well-described by astandard single-schechter function. we find evidence that this feature extendsto at least z ~ 2, and that it can be found in both the star-forming andquiescent populations individually. the characteristic mass (m*) and slope atthe lowest masses (alpha) of a double-schechter function fit to the smf stayroughly constant at log(m/msol) ~ 10.65 and ~-1.5 respectively. the smf ofstar-forming galaxies has evolved primarily in normalization, while the changein shape is relatively minor. this is not the case for quiescent galaxies: thedepth of our imaging allows us to show for the first time significantly moreevolution at log(m/msol) &lt; 10.5 than at higher masses. we find that the totalmass density (down to 10^9 msol) in star-forming galaxies has increased by afactor of ~2.2 since z ~ 2.5, whereas in quiescent galaxies it has increased bya factor of ~12 .

1310.7582	tracing the mass growth and star formation rate evolution of massive  galaxies from z~6 to z~1 in the hubble ultra-deep field	we present an analysis of $\sim$1500 h160-selected photometric galaxiesdetected to a limiting magnitude of 27.8 in the hudf, using imaging from thehst wfc3/ir camera in combination with archival uv, optical, and nir imaging.we fit photometric redshifts and stellar population estimates for all galaxieswith well-determined spitzer irac fluxes, allowing for the determination of thecumulative mass function within the range $1&lt;z&lt;6$. by selecting samples ofgalaxies at a constant cumulative number density, we explore the co-evolutionof stellar masses and star formation rates from z$\sim$6. we find a steadyincrease in the sfrs of galaxies at constant number density from z$\sim$6 toz$\sim$3. the peak epoch of star formation is found to shift to later times forgalaxies with increasing number densities, in agreement with the expectationsfrom cosmic downsizing. the observed sfrs can fully account for the mass growthto z$\sim$2 amongst galaxies with cumulative number densities greater than10$^{-3.5}$ mpc$^{-3}$. for galaxies with a lower constant number density wefind the observed stellar masses are $\sim$3 times greater than that which maybe accounted for by the observed star formation alone at late times, implyingthat growth from mergers plays an important role at $z&lt;2$. we additionallyobserve a decreasing ssfr, equivalent to approximately one order of magnitude,from z$\sim$6 to z$\sim$2 amongst galaxies with number densities less than10$^{-3.5}$ mpc$^{-3}$ along with significant evidence that at any redshift thessfr is higher for galaxies at higher number density. the combination of thesefindings can qualitatively explain the previous findings of a ssfr plateau athigh redshift. tracing the evolution of the fraction of quiescent galaxies forsamples matched in cumulative number density over this redshift range, we findno unambiguous examples of quiescent galaxies at $z&gt;4$.

1401.5472	simultaneous modeling of the stellar and dust emission in distant  galaxies: implications for star formation rate measurements	we have used near-ultraviolet (nuv) to mid-infrared (mir) composite spectralenergy distributions (seds) to simultaneously model the attenuated stellar anddust emission of 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.0 galaxies. these composite seds were previouslyconstructed from the photometric catalogs of the newfirm medium-band survey, bystacking the observed photometry of galaxies that have similar rest-framenuv-to-nir seds. in this work, we include a stacked mips 24 micron measurementfor each sed type to extend the seds to rest-frame mir wavelengths. consistentwith previous studies, the observed mir emission for most sed types is higherthan expected from only the attenuated stellar emission. we fit the nuv-to-mircomposite seds by the flexible stellar population synthesis (sps) models, whichinclude both stellar and dust emission. we compare the best-fit star formationrates (sfrs) to the sfrs based on simple uv+ir estimators. interestingly, theuv and ir luminosities overestimate sfrs - compared to the model sfrs - by morethan ~ 1 dex for quiescent galaxies, while for the highest star-forminggalaxies in our sample the two sfrs are broadly consistent. the difference inspecific sfrs also shows a gradually increasing trend with declining specificsfr, implying that quiescent galaxies have even lower specific sfrs thanpreviously found. contributions from evolved stellar populations to both the uvand the mir seds most likely explain the discrepancy. based on this work, weconclude that sfrs should be determined from modeling the attenuated stellarand dust emission simultaneously, instead of employing simple uv+ir-based sfrestimators.

1403.3689	3d-hst wfc3-selected photometric catalogs in the five candels/3d-hst  fields: photometry, photometric redshifts and stellar masses	the 3d-hst and candels programs have provided wfc3 and acs spectroscopy andphotometry over ~900 square arcminutes in five fields: aegis, cosmos,goods-north, goods-south, and the ukidss uds field. all these fields have awealth of publicly available imaging datasets in addition to the hst data,which makes it possible to construct the spectral energy distributions (seds)of objects over a wide wavelength range. in this paper we describe aphotometric analysis of the candels and 3d-hst hst imaging and the ancillaryimaging data at wavelengths 0.3um to 8um. objects were selected in the wfc3near-ir bands, and their seds were determined by carefully taking the effectsof the point spread function in each observation into account. a total of 147distinct imaging datasets were used in the analysis. the photometry is madeavailable in the form of six catalogs: one for each field, as well as a mastercatalog containing all objects in the entire survey. we also provide deriveddata products: photometric redshifts, determined with the eazy code, andstellar population parameters determined with the fast code. we make all theimaging data that were used in the analysis available, including our reductionsof the wfc3 imaging in all five fields. 3d-hst is a spectroscopic survey withthe wfc3 and acs grisms, and the photometric catalogs presented here constitutea necessary first step in the analysis of these grism data. all the datapresented in this paper are available through the 3d-hst website.

1404.4874	dense cores in galaxies out to z=2.5 in sdss, ultravista, and the five  3d-hst/candels fields	the dense interiors of massive galaxies are among the most intriguingenvironments in the universe. in this paper we ask when these dense cores wereformed and determine how galaxies gradually assembled around them. we selectgalaxies that have a stellar mass &gt;3x10^10 msun inside r=1 kpc out to z=2.5,using the 3d-hst survey and data at low redshift. remarkably, the numberdensity of galaxies with dense cores appears to have decreased from z=2.5 tothe present. this decrease is probably mostly due to stellar mass loss and theresulting adiabatic expansion, with some contribution from merging. we inferthat dense cores were mostly formed at z&gt;2.5, consistent with their largelyquiescent stellar populations. while the cores appear to form early, thegalaxies in which they reside show strong evolution: their total massesincrease by a factor of 2-3 from z=2.5 to z=0 and their effective radiiincrease by a factor of 5-6. as a result, the contribution of dense cores tothe total mass of the galaxies in which they reside decreases from ~50% atz=2.5 to ~15% at z=0. because of their early formation, the contribution ofdense cores to the total stellar mass budget of the universe is a strongfunction of redshift. the stars in cores with m_1kpc&gt;3x10^10 msun make up ~0.1%of the stellar mass density of the universe today but 10%-20% at z~2, dependingon their imf. the formation of these cores required the conversion of ~10^11msun of gas into stars within ~1 kpc, while preventing significant starformation at larger radii.

1405.1048	exploring the z=3-4 massive galaxy population with zfourge: the  prevalence of dusty and quiescent galaxies	our understanding of the redshift $z&gt;3$ galaxy population relies largely onsamples selected using the popular "dropout" technique, typically consisting ofuv-bright galaxies with blue colors and prominent lyman breaks. as it iscurrently unknown if these galaxies are representative of the massive galaxypopulation, we here use the fourstar galaxy evolution (zfourge) survey tocreate a stellar mass-limited sample at $z=3-4$. uniquely, zfourge uses deepnear-infrared medium-bandwidth filters to derive accurate photometric redshiftsand stellar population properties. the mass-complete sample consists of 57galaxies with log m $&gt;10.6$, reaching below $m^{\star}$ at $z=3-4$.  on average, the massive $z=3-4$ galaxies are extremely faint in the observedoptical with median $r_{tot}^{ab}=27.48\pm0.41$ (restframe$m_{1700}=-18.05\pm0.37$). they lie far below the uv luminosity-stellar massrelation for lyman break galaxies and are about $\sim100\times$ fainter at thesame mass. the massive galaxies are red ($r-ks_{ab}=3.9\pm0.2$; restframeuv-slope $\beta=-0.2\pm0.3$) likely from dust or old stellar ages. we classifythe galaxy seds by their restframe $u-v$ and $v-j$ colors and find a diversepopulation: $46^{+6+10}_{-6-17}$% of the massive galaxies are quiescent,$54^{+8+17}_{-8-10}$% are dusty star-forming galaxies, and only$14^{+3+10}_{-3-4}$% resemble luminous blue star forming lyman break galaxies.this study clearly demonstrates an inherent diversity among massive galaxies athigher redshift than previously known. furthermore,we uncover a reservoir ofdusty star-forming galaxies with $4\times$ lower specific star-formation ratescompared to submillimeter-selected starbursts at $z&gt;3$. with $5\times$ highernumbers, the dusty galaxies may represent a more typical mode of star formationcompared to submillimeter-bright starbursts.

1406.1180	the sizes of candidate $z\sim9-10$ galaxies: confirmation of the bright  candels sample and relation with luminosity and mass	recently, a small sample of six $z\sim9-10$ candidates was discovered incandels that are $\sim10-20\times$ more luminous than any of the previous$z\sim9-10$ galaxies identified over the hudf/xdf and clash fields. we measurethe sizes of these candidates to map out the size evolution of galaxies fromthe earliest observable times. their sizes are also used to provide a valuableconstraint on whether these unusual galaxy candidates are at high redshift.using galfit to derive sizes from the candels f160w images of these candidates,we find a mean size of 0.13$\pm$0.02" (or 0.5$\pm$0.1 kpc at $z\sim9-10$). thishandsomely matches the 0.6 kpc size expected extrapolating lower redshiftmeasurements to $z\sim9-10$, while being much smaller than the 0.59" mean sizefor lower-redshift interlopers to $z\sim9-10$ photometric selections lackingthe blue irac color criterion. this suggests that source size may be aneffective constraint on contaminants from $z\sim9-10$ selections lacking iracdata. assuming on the basis of the strong photometric evidence that the oeschet al. 2014 sample is entirely at $z\sim9-10$, we can use this sample to extendcurrent constraints on the size-luminosity, size-mass relation, and sizeevolution of galaxies to $z\sim10$. we find that the $z\sim9-10$ candidategalaxies have broadly similar sizes and luminosities as $z\sim6$-8 counterpartswith star-formation-rate surface densities in the range of $\rm\sigma_{sfr}=1-20\, m_\odot~ yr^{-1}\, kpc^{-2}$. the stellar mass-sizerelation is uncertain, but shallower than those inferred for lower-redshiftgalaxies. in combination with previous size measurements at z=4-7, we find asize evolution of $(1+z)^{-m}$ with $m=1.0\pm0.1$ for $&gt;0.3l^*_{z=3}$ galaxies,consistent with the evolution previously derived from $2 &lt; z &lt; 8$ galaxies.

1406.6056	the distribution of satellites around massive galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;3 in  zfourge/candels: dependence on star formation activity	we study the statistical distribution of satellites around star-forming andquiescent central galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;3 using imaging from the fourstar galaxyevolution survey (zfourge) and the cosmic assembly near-ir deep extragalacticlegacy survey (candels). the deep near-ir data select satellites down to$\log(m/m_\odot)&gt;9$ at z&lt;3. the radial satellite distribution around centralsis consistent with a projected nfw profile. massive quiescent centrals,$\log(m/m_\odot)&gt;10.78$, have $\sim$2 times the number of satellites comparedto star-forming centrals with a significance of 2.7$\sigma$ even afteraccounting for differences in the centrals' stellar-mass distributions. we findno statistical difference in the satellite distributions of intermediate-massquiescent and star-forming centrals, $10.48&lt;\log(m/m_\odot)&lt;10.78$. comparingto the guo2011 semi-analytic model, the excess number of satellites indicatesthat quiescent centrals have halo masses 0.3 dex larger than star-formingcentrals, even when the stellar-mass distributions are fixed. we use a simpletoy model that relates halo mass and quenching, which roughly reproduces theobserved quenched fractions and the differences in halo mass betweenstar-forming and quenched galaxies only if galaxies have a quenchingprobability that increases with halo mass from $\sim$0 for$\log(m_h/m_\odot)\sim$11 to $\sim$1 for $\log(m_h/m_\odot)\sim$13.5. a singlehalo-mass quenching threshold is unable to reproduce the quiescent fraction andsatellite distribution of centrals. therefore, while halo quenching may be animportant mechanism, it is unlikely to be the only factor driving quenching. itremains unclear why a high fraction of centrals remain star-forming even inrelatively massive halos.

1407.1843	constraining the low-mass slope of the star formation sequence at  0.5&lt;z&lt;2.5	we constrain the slope of the star formation rate ($\log\psi$) to stellarmass ($\log\mathrm{m_{\star}}$) relation down to$\log(\mathrm{m_{\star}/m_{\odot}})=8.4$($\log(\mathrm{m_{\star}/m_{\odot}})=9.2$) at $z=0.5$ ($z=2.5$) with amass-complete sample of 39,106 star-forming galaxies selected from the 3d-hstphotometric catalogs, using deep photometry in the candels fields. for thefirst time, we find that the slope is dependent on stellar mass, such that itis steeper at low masses ($\log\mathrm{\psi}\propto\log\mathrm{m_{\star}}$)than at high masses($\log\mathrm{\psi}\propto(0.3-0.6)\log\mathrm{m_{\star}}$). these steeper lowmass slopes are found for three different star formation indicators: thecombination of the ultraviolet (uv) and infrared (ir), calibrated from astacking analysis of spitzer/mips 24$\mu$m imaging; $\beta$-corrected uv sfrs;and h$\alpha$ sfrs. the normalization of the sequence evolves differently indistinct mass regimes as well: for galaxies less massive than$\log(\mathrm{m_{\star}/m_{\odot}})&lt;10$ the specific sfr($\psi/\mathrm{m_{\star}}$) is observed to be roughly self-similar with$\psi/\mathrm{m_{\star}}\propto(1+z)^{1.9}$, whereas more massive galaxies showa stronger evolution with $\psi/\mathrm{m_{\star}}\propto(1+z)^{2.2-3.5}$ for$\log(\mathrm{m_{\star}/m_{\odot}})=10.2-11.2$. the fact that we find a steepslope of the star formation sequence for the lower mass galaxies will helpreconcile theoretical galaxy formation models with the observations. theresults of this study support the analytical conclusions of leja et al.

1408.3416	stellar mass functions of galaxies at 4&lt;z&lt;7 from an irac-selected sample  in cosmos/ultravista: limits on the abundance of very massive galaxies	we build a spitzer irac complete catalog of objects, obtained bycomplementing the $k_\mathrm{s}$-band selected ultravista catalog with objectsdetected in irac only. with the aim of identifying massive (i.e.,$\log(m_*/m_\odot)&gt;11$) galaxies at $4&lt;z&lt;7$, we consider the systematic effectson the measured photometric redshifts from the introduction of an old and dustysed template and from the introduction of a bayesian prior taking into accountthe brightness of the objects, as well as the systematic effects from differentstar formation histories (sfhs) and from nebular emission lines in the recoveryof stellar population parameters. we show that our results are most affected bythe bayesian luminosity prior, while nebular emission lines and sfhs onlyintroduce a small dispersion in the measurements. specifically, the number of$4&lt;z&lt;7$ galaxies ranges from 52 to 382 depending on the adopted configuration.using these results we investigate, for the first time, the evolution of themassive end of the stellar mass functions (smfs) at $4&lt;z&lt;7$. given the rarityof very massive galaxies in the early universe, major contributions to thetotal error budget come from cosmic variance and poisson noise. the smfobtained without the introduction of the bayesian luminosity prior does notshow any evolution from $z\sim6.5$ to $z\sim 3.5$, implying that massivegalaxies could already be present when the universe was $\sim0.9$~gyr old.however, the introduction of the bayesian luminosity prior reduces the numberof $z&gt;4$ galaxies with best fit masses $\log(m_*/m_\odot)&gt;11$ by 83%, implyinga rapid growth of very massive galaxies in the first 1.5 gyr of cosmic history.from the stellar-mass complete sample, we identify one candidate of a verymassive ($\log(m_*/m_\odot)\sim11.5$), quiescent galaxy at $z\sim5.4$, withmips $24\mu$m detection suggesting the presence of a powerful obscured agn.

1412.0663	high-precision photometric redshifts from spitzer/irac: extreme  [3.6]-[4.5] colors identify galaxies in the redshift range z~6.6-6.9	one of the most challenging aspects of studying galaxies in the z&gt;~7 universeis the infrequent confirmation of their redshifts through spectroscopy, aphenomenon thought to occur from the increasing opacity of the intergalacticmedium to lya photons at z&gt;6.5. the resulting redshift uncertainties inhibitthe efficient search for [c ii] in z~7 galaxies with sub-mm instruments such asalma, given their limited scan speed for faint lines. one means by which toimprove the precision of the inferred redshifts is to exploit the potentialimpact of strong nebular emission lines on the colors of z~4-8 galaxies asobserved by spitzer/irac. at z~6.8, galaxies exhibit irac colors as blue as[3.6]-[4.5] ~-1, likely due to the contribution of [o iii]+hb to the 3.6 mumflux combined with the absence of line contamination in the 4.5 mum band. inthis paper we explore the use of extremely blue [3.6]-[4.5] colors to identifygalaxies in the narrow redshift window z~6.6-6.9. when combined with ani-dropout criterion, we demonstrate that we can plausibly select a relativelyclean sample of z~6.8 galaxies. through a systematic application of thisselection technique to our catalogs from all five candels fields, we identify20 probable z~6.6-6.9 galaxies. we estimate that our criteria select the ~50%strongest line emitters at z~6.8 and from the irac colors we estimate a typical[o iii]+hb rest-frame equivalent width of 1085a for this sample. the smallredshift uncertainties on our sample make it particularly well suited forfollow-up studies with facilities such as alma.

1506.01380	the sizes of massive quiescent and star forming galaxies at z~4 with  zfourge and candels	we study the rest-frame ultra-violet sizes of massive (~0.8 x 10^11 m_sun)galaxies at 3.4&lt;z&lt;4.2, selected from the fourstar galaxy evolution survey(zfourge), by fitting single sersic profiles to hst/wfc3/f160w images from thecosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey (candels).massive quiescent galaxies are very compact, with a median circularizedhalf-light radius r_e = 0.63 +/- 0.18 kpc. removing 5/16 (31%) sources withsigns of agn activity does not change the result. star-forming galaxies haver_e = 2.0 +/- 0.60 kpc, 3.2 +/- 1.3 x larger than quiescent galaxies. quiescentgalaxies at z~4 are on average 6.0 +\- 0.17 x smaller than at z~0 and 1.9 +/-0.7 x smaller than at z~2. star-forming galaxies of the same stellar mass are2.4 +/- 0.7 x smaller than at z~0. overall, the size evolution at 0&lt;z&lt;4 is welldescribed by a powerlaw, with r_e = 5.08 +/- 0.28 (1+z)^(-1.44+/-0.08) kpc forquiescent and r_e = 6.02 +/- 0.28 (1+z)^(-0.72+/-0.05) kpc for star-forminggalaxies. compact star-forming galaxies are rare in our sample: we find only1/14 (7%) with r_e / (m / 10^11 m_sun)^0.75 &lt; 1.5, whereas 13/16 (81%) of thequiescent galaxies is compact. the number density of compact quiescent galaxiesat z~4 is 1.8 +/- 0.8 x 10^-5 mpc^-3 and increases rapidly, by &gt;5 x, between2&lt;z&lt;4. the paucity of compact star-forming galaxies at z~4 and their largerest-frame ultra-violet median sizes suggest that the formation phase ofcompact cores is very short and/or highly dust obscured.

1507.02679	lyman-alpha emission from a luminous z=8.68 galaxy: implications for  galaxies as tracers of cosmic reionization	we report the discovery of lyman-alpha emission (ly$\alpha$) in the brightgalaxy egsy-2008532660 (hereafter egsy8p7) using the mosfire spectrograph atthe keck observatory. first reported by roberts-borsani et al. (2015), it wasselected for spectroscopic observations because of its photometric redshift($z_{phot}=8.57^{+0.22}_{-0.43}$), apparent brightness (h$_{160}=25.26\pm0.09$)and red spitzer/irac [3.6]-[4.5] color indicative of contamination by strongoxygen emission in the [4.5] band. with a total integration of $\sim$4.3 hours,our data reveal an emission line at $\simeq$11776 {\aa} which we argue islikely ly$\alpha$ at a redshift $z_{spec}=8.683^{+0.001}_{-0.004}$, in goodagreement with the photometric estimate. the line was detected independently ontwo nights using different slit orientations and its detection significance is$\sim7.5\sigma$. an overlapping skyline contributes significantly to theuncertainty on the total line flux although the significance of the detectedline is robust to a variety of skyline-masking procedures. by direct additionand a gaussian fit, we estimate a 95\% confidence range of1.0--2.5$\times10^{-17}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, corresponding to a rest-frameequivalent width of 17--42 {\aa}. egsy8p7 is the most distant galaxy confirmedspectroscopically to date, and the third luminous source in the egs fieldbeyond $z_{phot}\gtrsim7.5$ with detectable ly$\alpha$ emission viewed at atime when the intergalactic medium is believed to be fairly neutral. althoughthe reionization process was probably patchy, we discuss whether luminoussources with prominent irac color excesses may harbor harder ionizing spectrathan the dominant fainter population thereby creating earlier ionized bubbles.further spectroscopic follow-up of such bright sources promises importantinsight into the early formation of galaxies.

1508.04771	galaxy structure as a driver of the star formation sequence slope and  scatter	it is well established that (1) star-forming galaxies follow a relationbetween their star formation rate (sfr) and stellar mass (m$_{\star}$), the"star-formation sequence", and (2) the sfrs of galaxies correlate with theirstructure, where star-forming galaxies are less concentrated than quiescentgalaxies at fixed mass. here, we consider whether the scatter and slope of thestar-formation sequence is correlated with systematic variations in the sersicindices, $n$, of galaxies across the sfr-m$_{\star}$ plane. we use amass-complete sample of 23,848 galaxies at $0.5&lt;z&lt;2.5$ selected from the 3d-hstphotometric catalogs. galaxy light profiles parameterized by $n$ are based onhubble space telescope candels near-infrared imaging. we use a single sfrindicator empirically-calibrated from stacks of spitzer/mips 24$\mu$m imaging,adding the unobscured and obscured star formation. we find that the scatter ofthe star-formation sequence is related in part to galaxy structure; the scatterdue to variations in $n$ at fixed mass for star-forming galaxies ranges from0.14$\pm$0.02 dex at $z\sim2$ to 0.30$\pm$0.04 dex at $z&lt;1$. while the slope ofthe log(sfr)-log(m$_{\star}$) relation is of order unity for disk-likegalaxies, galaxies with $n&gt;2$ (implying more dominant bulges) havesignificantly lower sfr/m$_{\star}$ than the main ridgeline of thestar-formation sequence. these results suggest that bulges in massive $z\sim2$galaxies are actively building up, where the stars in the central concentrationare relatively young. at $z&lt;1$, the presence of older bulges withinstar-forming galaxies lowers global sfr/m$_{\star}$, decreasing the slope andcontributing significantly to the scatter of the star-formation sequence.

1510.01514	quantifying the uv continuum slopes of galaxies to z~10 using deep  hubble and spitzer/irac observations	measurements of the uv-continuum slopes provide valuable information on thephysical properties of galaxies forming in the early universe, probing the dustreddening, age, metal content, and even the escape fraction. while constraintson these slopes generally become more challenging at higher redshifts as the uvcontinuum shifts out of the hubble space telescope bands (particularly at z&gt;7),such a characterisation actually becomes abruptly easier for galaxies in theredshift window z=9.5-10.5 due to the spitzer/irac 3.6um-band probing therest-uv continuum and the long wavelength baseline between this spitzer bandand the hubble h-band. higher s/n constraints on the uv slope are possible atz~10 than at z=8. here we take advantage of this opportunity and five recentlydiscovered bright z=9.5-10.5 galaxies to present the first measurements of themean slope for a multi-object sample of galaxy candidates at z~10. we find themeasured observed slopes of these candidates are $-2.1\pm0.3\pm0.2$ (random andsystematic), only slightly bluer than the measured slopes at 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5 forgalaxies of similar luminosities. small increases in the stellar ages,metallicities, and dust content of the galaxy population from z~10 to z~7 couldeasily explain the apparent evolution in slopes.

0806.0625	detection of quiescent galaxies in a bicolor sequence from z=0-2	we investigate the properties of quiescent and star-forming galaxypopulations to z~2 with purely photometric data, employing a novel rest-framecolor selection technique. from the ukidss ultra-deep survey data release 1,with matched optical and mid-ir photometry taken from the subaru xmm deepsurvey and spitzer wide-area infrared extragalactic survey respectively, weconstruct a k-selected galaxy catalog and calculate photometric redshifts.excluding stars, objects with uncertain z_phot solutions, those that fall inbad or incomplete survey regions, and those for which reliable rest-framecolors could not be derived, 30108 galaxies with k&lt;22.4 (ab) and z&lt;2.5 remain.the galaxies in this sample are found to occupy two distinct populations in therest-frame u-v vs. v-j color space: a clump of red, quiescent galaxies(analogous to the red sequence) and a track of star-forming galaxies extendingfrom blue to red u-v colors. this bimodal behavior is seen up to z~2. due to acombination of measurement errors and passive evolution, the color-colordiagram is not suitable to distinguish the galaxy bimodality at z&gt;2 for thissample, but we show that mips 24um data suggest that a significant populationof quiescent galaxies exists even at these higher redshifts. at z=1-2, the mostluminous objects in the sample are divided roughly equally between star-formingand quiescent galaxies, while at lower redshifts most of the brightest galaxiesare quiescent. moreover, quiescent galaxies at these redshifts are clusteredmore strongly than those actively forming stars, indicating that galaxies withearly-quenched star formation may occupy more massive host dark matter halos.this suggests that the end of star formation is associated with, and perhapsbrought about by, a mechanism related to halo mass.

1510.06072	the sfr-m* relation and empirical star-formation histories from zfourge  at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 4	we explore star-formation histories (sfhs) of galaxies based on the evolutionof the star-formation rate stellar mass relation (sfr-m*). using data from thefourstar galaxy evolution survey (zfourge) in combination with far-ir imagingfrom the spitzer and herschel observatories we measure the sfr-m* relation at0.5 &lt; z &lt; 4. similar to recent works we find that the average infrared seds ofgalaxies are roughly consistent with a single infrared template across a broadrange of redshifts and stellar masses, with evidence for only weak deviations.we find that the sfr-m* relation is not consistent with a single power-law ofthe form sfr ~ m*^a at any redshift; it has a power-law slope of a~1 at lowmasses, and becomes shallower above a turnover mass (m_0) that ranges from10^9.5 - 10^10.8 msol, with evidence that m_0 increases with redshift. wecompare our measurements to results from state-of-the-art cosmologicalsimulations, and find general agreement in the slope of the sfr-m* relationalbeit with systematic offsets. we use the evolving sfr-m* sequence to generatesfhs, finding that typical sfrs of individual galaxies rise at early times anddecline after reaching a peak. this peak occurs earlier for more massivegalaxies. we integrate these sfhs to generate mass-growth histories and compareto the implied mass-growth from the evolution of the stellar mass function. wefind that these two estimates are in broad qualitative agreement, but thatthere is room for improvement at a more detailed level. at early times the sfhssuggest mass-growth rates that are as much as 10x higher than inferred from thestellar mass function. however, at later times the sfhs under-predict theinferred evolution, as is expected in the case of additional growth due tomergers.

astro-ph;0106074	a k-band selected photometric redshift catalog in the hdf-s: sampling  the rest-frame v-band to z=3	we present the first results from the faint infra-red extragalactic survey(fires) of the hubble deep field south. using a combination of deep nearinfrared data obtained with isaac at the vlt with the wfpc2 hst data, weconstruct a k-band selected sample of 136 galaxies with k(ab)&lt;=23.5. we derivezphot's using a newly developed technique which models the observed spectralenergy distribution with a linear combination of empirical galaxy templates.testing our zphot technique against spectroscopic redshifts in the hdf-n yieldsdz/(1+z)~0.07 for z&lt;6. we show that we can derive realistic error estimates inzphot by combining the systematic uncertainties derived from the hdf-n witherrors in zphot which depend on the observed flux errors. the redshifthistogram of galaxies in the hdf-s shows distinct structure with a sharp peakat z~0.5 and a broad enhancement at z~1-1.4. we find that 12% of our galaxieswith k(vega)&lt;21 lie at z&gt;=2. while this is higher than the fraction predictedin omega_m=1 hierarchical models of galaxy formation we find that publishedpredictions using pure luminosity evolution models produce too many brightgalaxies at redshifts greater than unity. finally, we use our broad wavelengthcoverage to measure the rest-frame ubv luminosities lrest for z&lt;=3. there is apaucity of galaxies brighter than lrest_v&gt;=1.4e10 h^{-2}lsun at z~1.5-2,however, at z&gt;2 we find very luminous galaxies with lrest_v&gt;=5e10 h^{-2}lsun(for omega_m=0.3,lambda=0.7, h_o=100 h km s^{-1}mpc^{-1}). local b-bandluminosity functions predict 0.1 galaxies in the redshift range 2&lt;=z&lt;=3.5 andwith lrest_b&gt;= 5e10 h^{-2}lsun,b but we find 9. the discrepancy can beexplained if l*_b increases by a factor of 2.4-3.2 with respect to locallydetermined values (abridged).

0808.2642	structure and star formation in galaxies out to z=3: evidence for  surface density dependent evolution and upsizing	we present an analysis of galaxies in the cdf-south. we find a tight relationto z=3 between color and size at a given mass, with red galaxies being small,and blue galaxies being large. we show that the relation is driven by stellarsurface density or inferred velocity dispersion: galaxies with high surfacedensity are red and have low specific star formation rates, and galaxies withlow surface density are blue and have high specific star formation rates.surface density and inferred velocity dispersion are better correlated withspecific star formation rate and color than stellar mass. hence stellar mass byitself is not a good predictor of the star formation history of galaxies. ingeneral, galaxies at a given surface density have higher specific starformation rates at higher redshift. specifically, galaxies with a surfacedensity of 1-3 10^9 msun/kpc^2 are "red and dead" at low redshift,approximately 50% are forming stars at z=1, and almost all are forming stars byz=2. this provides direct additional evidence for the late evolution ofgalaxies onto the red sequence. the sizes of galaxies at a given mass evolvelike 1/(1+z)^(0.59 +- 0.10). hence galaxies undergo significant upsizing intheir history. the size evolution is fastest for the highest mass galaxies, andquiescent galaxies. the persistence of the structural relations from z=0 toz=2.5, and the upsizing of galaxies imply that a relation analogous to thehubble sequence exists out to z=2.5, and possibly beyond. the star forminggalaxies at z &gt;= 1.5 are quite different from star forming galaxies at z=0, asthey have likely very high gas fractions, and star formation time scalescomparable to the orbital time.

astro-ph;0303163	a significant population of red, near-ir selected high redshift galaxies	we use very deep near-infrared photometry of the hubble deep field southtaken with isaac/vlt to identify a population of high redshift galaxies withrest- frame optical colors similar to those of nearby galaxies. the galaxiesare chosen by their infrared colors js-ks &gt; 2.3, aimed at selecting galaxieswith redshifts above 2. when applied to our dataset, we find 14 galaxies withks &lt; 22.5, corresponding to a surface density of 3+-0.8 /arcmin**2. thephotometric redshifts all lie above 1.9, with a median of 2.6 and a rms of 0.7.the spectral energy distributions of these galaxies show a wide range: one isvery blue in the rest-frame uv, and satisfies the normal lyman-break criteriafor high redshift, star-forming galaxies. others are quite red throughout theobserved spectral range, and are extremely faint in the optical, with a medianv = 26.6. hence these galaxies would not be included in photometric samplesbased on optical ground-based data, and spectroscopic follow-up is difficult.the spectral energy distributions often show a prominent break, identified asthe balmer break or 4000 ang. break. the median age is 1 gyr when fit with aconstant star formation model with dust, or 0.7 gyr when fit with a singleburst model. although significantly younger ages cannot be excluded when alarger range of models is allowed, the results indicate that these galaxies areamong the oldest at these redshifts. the volume density to ks=22.5 is half thatof lyman-break galaxies at z = 3. since the mass-to-light ratios of the redgalaxies are likely to be higher, the stellar mass density is inferred to becomparable to that of lyman-break galaxies. these red galaxies may be thedescendants of galaxies which started to form stars at very high redshifts, andthey may evolve into the most massive galaxies at low redshift.

astro-ph;0303166	spectroscopic confirmation of a substantial population of luminous red  galaxies at redshifts z&gt;2	we confirm spectroscopically the existence of a population of galaxies atz&gt;~2 with rest-frame optical colors similar to normal nearby galaxies. thegalaxies were identified by their red near-infrared colors in deep imagesobtained with isaac on the very large telescope. redshifts of six galaxies withjs-ks&gt;2.3 were measured from optical spectra obtained with the keck telescope.five out of six are in the range 2.43&lt;=z&lt;=3.52, demonstrating that the js-kscolor selection is quite efficient. the rest-frame ultraviolet spectra ofconfirmed z&gt;2 galaxies display a range of properties, with two galaxies showingemission lines characteristic of agn, two having ly-alpha in emission, and oneshowing interstellar absorption lines only. their full spectral energydistributions are well described by constant star formation models with ages1.4-2.6 gyr, except for one galaxy whose colors indicate a dusty starburst. theconfirmed z&gt;2 galaxies are very luminous, with ks=19.2-19.9. assuming that ourbright spectroscopic sample is representative for the general population ofjs-ks selected objects, we find that the surface density of red z&gt;~2 galaxiesis ~0.9/arcmin^2 to ks=21. the surface density is comparable to that oflyman-break selected galaxies with ks&lt;21, when corrections are made for thedifferent redshift distributions of the two samples. although there will besome overlap between the two populations, most 'optical-break' galaxies are toofaint in the rest-frame ultraviolet to be selected as lyman-break galaxies. themost straightforward interpretation is that star formation in typicaloptical-break galaxies started earlier than in typical lyman-break galaxies.optical-break galaxies may be the oldest and most massive galaxies yetidentified at z&gt;2, and could evolve into early-type galaxies and bulges.

astro-ph;0404471	stellar populations and kinematics of red galaxies at z&gt;2: implications  for the formation of massive galaxies	we recently identified a substantial population of galaxies at z&gt;2 with redrest-frame optical colors. these distant red galaxies (drgs) are efficientlyselected by the simple observed color criterion j-k&gt;2.3. in this paper wepresent nir spectroscopy with keck/nirspec of six drgs at 2.4&lt;z&lt;3.2. we detectcontinuum emission and emission lines of all observed galaxies. equivalentwidths of h alpha are 20-30 ang, smaller than measured for lbgs and nearbylirgs, and comparable to normal nearby galaxies. the modest equivalent widthsimply that the galaxies either have a decreasing star formation rate, or thatthey are very dusty. fitting both the photometry and the h alpha lines, we findcontinuum extinction a_v=1-2 mag, ages 1-2.5 gyr, star formation rates 200-400solar masses/yr, and stellar masses 1-5x10^11 solar masses for models withconstant star formation rates. from [nii]/h alpha ratios we infer that themetallicities are high, 1-1.5 x solar. for four galaxies we can determine linewidths from the optical emission lines. the widths are high, ranging from130-240 km/s, and by combining data for lbgs and drgs we find significantcorrelations between linewidth and restframe u-v color, and between linewidthand stellar mass. the latter correlation has a similar slope and offset as the``baryonic tully-fisher relation'' for nearby galaxies. the median dynamicalmass is ~2x10^11 solar masses, supporting the high stellar masses inferred fromthe photometry. we find that the median m/l_v ~ 0.8, a factor of ~5 higher thanmeasured for lbgs. we infer from our small sample that drgs are dustier, moremetal rich, more massive, and have higher ages than z=3 lbgs of the samerest-frame v-band luminosity. their high m/l ratios imply that they contributesignificantly to the stellar mass density at z~2.5.

0809.1426	the evolution of the specific star formation rate of massive galaxies to  z ~ 1.8 in the e-cdfs	we study the evolution of the star formation rate (sfr) of mid-infrared (ir)selected galaxies in the extended chandra deep field south (e-cdfs). we use acombination of u-k gabods and musyc data, deep irac observations from simple,and deep mips data from fidel. this unique multi-wavelength data set allows usto investigate the sfr history of massive galaxies out to redshift z ~ 1.8. wedetermine star formation rates using both the rest-frame ultraviolet luminosityfrom young, hot stars and the total ir luminosity of obscured star formationobtained from the mips 24 um flux. we find that at all redshifts the galaxieswith higher masses have substantially lower specific star formation rates thanlower mass galaxies. the average specific star formation rates increase withredshift, and the rate of incline is similar for all galaxies (roughly(1+z)^{n}, n = 5.0 +/- 0.4). it does not seem to be a strong function of galaxymass. using a subsample of galaxies with masses m_*&gt; 10^11 m_sun, we measuredthe fraction of galaxies whose star formation is quenched. we consider a galaxyto be in quiescent mode when its specific star formation rate does not exceed1/(3 x t_h), where t_h is the hubble time. the fraction of quiescent galaxiesdefined as such decreases with redshift out to z ~ 1.8. we find that, at thatredshift, 19 +/-9 % of the m_* &gt; 10^11 m_sun sources would be consideredquiescent according to our criterion.

astro-ph;0608444	spitzer irac confirmation of z_850-dropout galaxies in the hubble ultra  deep field: stellar masses and ages at z~7	using spitzer irac mid-infrared imaging from the great observatories originsdeep survey, we study z_850-dropout sources in the hubble ultra deep field.after carefully removing contaminating flux from foreground sources, we clearlydetect two z_850-dropouts at 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron, while two others aremarginally detected. the mid-infrared fluxes strongly support theirinterpretation as galaxies at z~7, seen when the universe was only 750 myr old.the irac observations allow us for the first time to constrain the rest-frameoptical colors, stellar masses, and ages of the highest redshift galaxies.fitting stellar population models to the spectral energy distributions, we findphotometric redshifts in the range 6.7-7.4, rest-frame colors u-v=0.2-0.4,v-band luminosities l_v=0.6-3 x 10^10 l_sun, stellar masses 1-10 x 10^9 m_sun,stellar ages 50-200 myr, star formation rates up to ~25 m_sun/yr, and lowreddening a_v&lt;0.4. overall, the z=7 galaxies appear substantially less massiveand evolved than lyman break galaxies or distant red galaxies at z=2-3, butfairly similar to recently identified systems at z=5-6. the stellar massdensity inferred from our z=7 sample is rho* = 1.6^{+1.6}_{-0.8} x 10^6 m_sunmpc^-3 (to 0.3 l*(z=3)), in apparent agreement with recent cosmologicalhydrodynamic simulations, but we note that incompleteness and sample variancemay introduce larger uncertainties. the ages of the two most massive galaxiessuggest they formed at z&gt;8, during the era of cosmic reionization, but the starformation rate density derived from their stellar masses and ages is not nearlysufficient to reionize the universe. the simplest explanation for thisdeficiency is that lower-mass galaxies beyond our detection limit reionized theuniverse.

astro-ph;0608446	spectroscopic identification of massive galaxies at z~2.3 with strongly  suppressed star formation	we present first results of a spectroscopic survey targeting k-selectedgalaxies at z=2.0-2.7 using the gnirs instrument on gemini-south. we obtainednear-infrared spectra with a wavelength coverage of 1.0-2.5 micron for 26k-bright galaxies (k&lt;19.7) selected from the musyc survey using photometricredshifts. we successfully derived spectroscopic redshifts for all 26 galaxiesusing rest-frame optical emission lines or the redshifted balmer/4000 angstrombreak. twenty galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts in the range 2.0&lt;z&lt;2.7, forwhich bright emission lines like halpha and [oiii] fall in atmospheric windows.surprisingly, we detected no emission lines for nine of these 20 galaxies. themedian 2 sigma upper limit on the rest-frame equivalent width of halpha forthese nine galaxies is ~10 angstrom. the stellar continuum emission of thesesame nine galaxies is best fitted by evolved stellar population models. thebest-fit star formation rate (sfr) is zero for five out of nine galaxies, andconsistent with zero within 1 sigma for the remaining four. thus, both thehalpha measurements and the independent stellar continuum modeling imply that45% of our k-selected galaxies are not forming stars intensely. this highfraction of galaxies without detected line emission and low sfrs may imply thatthe suppression of star formation in massive galaxies occurs at higher redshiftthan is predicted by current cdm galaxy formation models. however, obscuredstar formation may have been missed, and deep mid-infrared imaging is needed toclarify this situation.

astro-ph;0609548	what do we learn from irac observations of galaxies at 2 &lt; z &lt; 3.5?	we analyze very deep hst, vlt and spitzer photometry of galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;3.5in the hubble deep field south. the sample is selected from the deepest publick-band imaging currently available. we show that the rest-frame u-v vs v-jcolor-color diagram is a powerful diagnostic of the stellar populations ofdistant galaxies. galaxies with red rest-frame u-v colors are generally red inrest-frame v-j as well. however, at a given u-v color a range in v-j colorsexists, and we show that this allows us to distinguish young, dusty galaxiesfrom old, passively evolving galaxies. we quantify the effects of iracphotometry on estimates of masses, ages, and the dust content of z&gt;2 galaxies.the estimated distributions of these properties do not change significantlywhen adding irac data to the ubvijhk photometry. however, for individualgalaxies the addition of irac can improve the constraints on the stellarpopulations, especially for red galaxies: uncertainties in stellar massdecrease by a factor of 2.7 for red (u-v &gt; 1) galaxies, but only by a factor of1.3 for blue (u-v &lt; 1) galaxies. we find a similar color-dependence of theimprovement for estimates of age and dust extinction. in addition, theimprovement from adding irac depends on the availability of full near-infraredjhk coverage; if only k-band were available, the mass uncertainties of bluegalaxies would decrease by a more substantial factor 1.9. finally, we find thata trend of galaxy color with stellar mass is already present at z&gt;2. the mostmassive galaxies at high redshift have red rest-frame u-v colors compared tolower mass galaxies even when allowing for complex star formation histories.

astro-ph;0611724	the origin of line emission in massive z~2.3 galaxies: evidence for  cosmic downsizing of agn host galaxies	using the gemini near-infrared spectrograph (gnirs), we have assembled acomplete sample of 20 k-selected galaxies at 2.0&lt;z&lt;2.7 with high qualitynear-infrared spectra. as described in a previous paper, 9 of these 20 galaxieshave strongly suppressed star formation and no detected emission lines. thepresent paper concerns the 11 galaxies with detected halpha emission, andstudies the origin of the line emission using the gnirs spectra and follow-upobservations with sinfoni on the vlt. based on their [nii]/halpha ratios, thespatial extent of the line emission and several other diagnostics, we inferthat four of the eleven emission-line galaxies host narrow line active galacticnuclei (agns). the agn host galaxies have stellar populations ranging fromevolved to star-forming. combining our sample with a uv-selected galaxy sampleat the same redshift that spans a broader range in stellar mass, we find thatblack-hole accretion is more effective at the high-mass end of the galaxydistribution (~2.9x10^11 msun) at z~2.3. furthermore, by comparing our resultswith sdss data, we show that the agn activity in massive galaxies has decreasedsignificantly between z~2.3 and z~0. agns with similar normalized accretionrates as those detected in our k-selected galaxies reside in less massivegalaxies (~4.0x10^10 msun) at low redshift. this is direct evidence fordownsizing of agn host galaxies. finally, we speculate that the typical stellarmass-scale of the actively accreting agn host galaxies, both at low and at highredshift, might be similar to the mass-scale at which star-forming galaxiesseem to transform into red, passive systems.
