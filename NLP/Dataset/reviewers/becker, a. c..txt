0902.2213	the macho project hst follow-up: the large magellanic cloud microlensing  source stars	we present hubble space telescope (hst) wfpc2 photometry of 13 microlensedsource stars from the 5.7 year large magellanic cloud (lmc) survey conducted bythe macho project. the microlensing source stars are identified by derivingaccurate centroids in the ground-based macho images using difference imageanalysis (dia) and then transforming the dia coordinates to the hst frame. noneof these sources is coincident with a background galaxy, which rules out thepossibility that the macho lmc microlensing sample is contaminated withmisidentified supernovae or agn in galaxies behind the lmc. this supports theconclusion that the macho lmc microlensing sample has only a small amount ofcontamination due to non-microlensing forms of variability. we compare thewfpc2 source star magnitudes with the lensed flux predictions derived frommicrolensing fits to the light curve data. in most cases the source starbrightness is accurately predicted. finally, we develop a statistic whichconstrains the location of the large magellanic cloud (lmc) microlensing sourcestars with respect to the distributions of stars and dust in the lmc andcompare this to the predictions of various models of lmc microlensing. thistest excludes at &gt; 90% confidence level models where more than 80% of thesource stars lie behind the lmc. exotic models that attempt to explain theexcess lmc microlensing optical depth seen by macho with a population ofbackground sources are disfavored or excluded by this test. models in whichmost of the lenses reside in a halo or spheroid distribution associated witheither the milky way or the lmc are consistent which these data, but lmc haloor spheroid models are favored by the combined macho and eros microlensingresults.

0906.2030	m dwarfs in sdss stripe 82: photometric light curves and flare rate  analysis	we present a flare rate analysis of 50,130 m dwarf light curves in sdssstripe 82. we identified 271 flares using a customized variability index tosearch ~2.5 million photometric observations for flux increases in the u- andg-bands. every image of a flaring observation was examined by eye and with apsf-matching and image subtraction tool to guard against false positives.flaring is found to be strongly correlated with the appearance of h-alpha inemission in the quiet spectrum. of the 99 flare stars that have spectra, weclassify 8 as relatively inactive. the flaring fraction is found to increasestrongly in stars with redder colors during quiescence, which can be attributedto the increasing flare visibility and increasing active fraction for redderstars. the flaring fraction is strongly correlated with |z| distance such thatmost stars that flare are within 300 pc of the galactic plane. we derive flareu-band luminosities and find that the most luminous flares occur on theearlier-type m dwarfs. our best estimate of the lower limit on the flaring rate(averaged over stripe 82) for flares with \delta u \ge 0.7 magnitudes on starswith u &lt; 22 is 1.3 flares hour^-1 square degree^-1 but can vary significantlywith the line-of-sight.

0910.2193	first-year sloan digital sky survey-ii (sdss-ii) supernova results:  consistency and constraints with other intermediate-redshift datasets	we present an analysis of the luminosity distances of type ia supernovae fromthe sloan digital sky survey-ii (sdss-ii) supernova survey in conjunction withother intermediate redshift (z&lt;0.4) cosmological measurements includingredshift-space distortions from the two-degree field galaxy redshift survey(2dfgrs), the integrated sachs-wolfe (isw) effect seen by the sdss, and thelatest baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) distance scale from both the sdss and2dfgrs. we have analysed the sdss-ii sn data alone using a variety of"model-independent" methods and find evidence for an accelerating universe at&gt;97% level from this single dataset. we find good agreement between thesupernova and bao distance measurements, both consistent with alambda-dominated cdm cosmology, as demonstrated through an analysis of thedistance duality relationship between the luminosity (d_l) and angular diameter(d_a) distance measures. we then use these data to estimate w within thisrestricted redshift range (z&lt;0.4). our most stringent result comes from thecombination of all our intermediate-redshift data (sdss-ii sne, bao, isw andredshift-space distortions), giving w = -0.81 +0.16 -0.18(stat) +/- 0.15(sys)and omega_m=0.22 +0.09 -0.08 assuming a flat universe. this value of w, andassociated errors, only change slightly if curvature is allowed to vary,consistent with constraints from the cosmic microwave background. we alsoconsider more limited combinations of the geometrical (sn, bao) and dynamical(isw, redshift-space distortions) probes.

0911.2002	pushing the boundaries of conventional core-collapse supernovae: the  extremely energetic supernova sn 2003ma	we report the discovery of a supernova (sn) with the highest apparent energyoutput to date and conclude that it represents an extreme example of the typeiin subclass. the sn, which was discovered behind the large magellanic cloud atz = 0.289 by the supermacho microlensing survey, peaked at m_r = -21.5 mag andonly declined by 2.9 mag over 4.7 years after the peak. over this period, sn2003ma had an integrated bolometric luminosity of 4 x 10^51 ergs, more than anyother sn to date. the radiated energy is close to the limit allowed byconventional core-collapse explosions. optical spectra reveal that sn 2003mahas persistent single-peaked intermediate-width hydrogen lines, a signature ofinteraction between the sn and a dense circumstellar medium. the light curvesshow further evidence for circumstellar interaction, including a long plateauwith a shape very similar to the classic sn iin 1988z -- however, sn 2003ma isten times more luminous at all epochs. the fast velocity measured for theintermediate-width h_alpha component (~6000 km/s) points towards an extremelyenergetic explosion (&gt; 10^52 ergs), which imparts a faster blast-wave speed tothe post-shock material and a higher luminosity from the interaction than isobserved in typical sne iin. mid-infrared observations of sn 2003ma suggest aninfrared light echo is produced by normal interstellar dust at a distance ~0.5pc from the sn.

1004.0276	modeling the time variability of sdss stripe 82 quasars as a damped  random walk	we model the time variability of ~9,000 spectroscopically confirmed quasarsin sdss stripe 82 as a damped random walk. using 2.7 million photometricmeasurements collected over 10 years, we confirm the results of kelly et al.(2009) and koz{\l}owski et al. (2010) that this model can explain quasar lightcurves at an impressive fidelity level (0.01-0.02 mag). the damped random walkmodel provides a simple, fast [o(n) for n data points], and powerfulstatistical description of quasar light curves by a characteristic time scale(tau) and an asymptotic rms variability on long time scales (sf_inf). wesearched for correlations between these two variability parameters and physicalparameters such as luminosity and black hole mass, and rest-frame wavelength.we find that tau increases with increasing wavelength with a power law index of0.17, remains nearly constant with redshift and luminosity, and increases withincreasing black hole mass with power law index of 0.21+/-0.07. the amplitudeof variability is anti-correlated with the eddington ratio, which suggests ascenario where optical fluctuations are tied to variations in the accretionrate. the radio-loudest quasars have systematically larger variabilityamplitudes by about 30%, when corrected for the other observed trends, whilethe distribution of their characteristic time scale is indistinguishable fromthat of the full sample. we do not detect any statistically robust differencesin the characteristic time scale and variability amplitude between the fullsample and the small subsample of quasars detected by rosat. our resultsprovide a simple quantitative framework for generating mock quasar lightcurves, such as currently used in lsst image simulations.

1009.2081	quasar selection based on photometric variability	we develop a method for separating quasars from other variable point sourcesusing sdss stripe 82 light curve data for ~10,000 variable objects. tostatistically describe quasar variability, we use a damped random walk modelparametrized by a damping time scale, tau, and an asymptotic amplitude(structure function), sf_inf. with the aid of an sdss spectroscopicallyconfirmed quasar sample, we demonstrate that variability selection in typicalextragalactic fields with low stellar density can deliver complete samples withreasonable purity (or efficiency, e). compared to a selection method basedsolely on the slope of the structure function, the inclusion of the tauinformation boosts e from 60% to 75% while maintaining a highly complete sample(98%) even in the absence of color information. for a completeness of c=90%, eis boosted from 80% to 85%. conversely, c improves from 90% to 97% whilemaintaining e=80% when imposing a lower limit on tau. with the aid of colorselection, the purity can be further boosted to 96%, with c= 93%. hence,selection methods based on variability will play an important role in theselection of quasars with data provided by upcoming large sky surveys, such aspan-starrs and the large synoptic survey telescope (lsst). for a typical(simulated) lsst cadence over 10 years and a photometric accuracy of 0.03 mag(achieved at i~22), c is expected to be 88% for a simple sample selectioncriterion of tau&gt;100 days. in summary, given an adequate survey cadence,photometric variability provides an even better method than color selection forseparating quasars from stars.

1102.1387	periodic variability of low-mass stars in sdss stripe 82	we present a catalog of periodic stellar variability in the "stripe 82"region of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). after aggregating andrecalibrating catalog-level data from the survey, we ran a period-findingalgorithm (supersmoother) on all point-source lightcurves. we used colorselection to identify systems that are likely to contain low-mass stars, inparticular m dwarfs and white dwarfs. in total, we found 207 candidates, thevast majority of which appear to be in eclipsing binary systems. the catalogdescribed in this paper includes 42 candidate m dwarf / white dwarf pairs, 4white-dwarf pairs, 59 systems whose colors indicate they are composed of 2 mdwarfs and whose lightcurve shapes suggest they are in detached eclipsingbinaries, and 28 m dwarf systems whose lightcurve shapes suggest they are incontact binaries. we find no detached systems with periods longer than 3 days,thus the majority of our sources are likely to have experienced orbital spin-upand enhanced magnetic activity. indeed, twenty-six of twenty-seven m dwarfsystems that we have spectra for show signs of chromospheric magnetic activity,far higher than the 24% seen in field stars of the same spectral type. we alsofind binaries composed of stars that bracket the expected boundary betweenpartially and fully convective interiors, which will allow the measurement ofthe stellar mass-radius relationship across this transition. the majority ofour contact systems have short orbital periods, with small variance (0.02 days)in the sample near the observed cutoff of 0.22 days. the accumulation of thesestars at short orbital period suggests that the process of angular momentumloss, leading to period evolution, becomes less efficient at short periods.(abridged)

0710.2338	constraining cosmic evolution of type ia supernovae	we present the first large-scale effort of creating composite spectra ofhigh-redshift type ia supernovae (sne ia) and comparing them to low-redshiftcounterparts. through the essence project, we have obtained 107 spectra of 88high-redshift sne ia with excellent light-curve information. in addition, wehave obtained 397 spectra of low-redshift sne through a multiple-decade effortat lick and keck observatories, and we have used 45 uv spectra obtained byhst/iue. the low-redshift spectra act as a control sample when comparing to theessence spectra. in all instances, the essence and lick composite spectraappear very similar. the addition of galaxy light to the lick composite spectraallows a nearly perfect match of the overall spectral-energy distribution withthe essence composite spectra, indicating that the high-redshift sne are morecontaminated with host-galaxy light than their low-redshift counterparts. thisis caused by observing objects at all redshifts with the same slit width, whichcorresponds to different projected distances. after correcting for thegalaxy-light contamination, subtle differences in the spectra remain. we haveestimated the systematic errors when using current spectral templates fork-corrections to be ~0.02 mag. the variance in the composite spectra give anestimate of the intrinsic variance in low-redshift maximum-light sn spectra of~3% in the optical and growing toward the uv. the difference between themaximum light low and high-redshift spectra constrain sn evolution between oursamples to be &lt; 10% in the rest-frame optical.

1202.2902	regularization techniques for psf-matching kernels. i. choice of kernel  basis	we review current methods for building psf-matching kernels for the purposesof image subtraction or coaddition. such methods use a linear decomposition ofthe kernel on a series of basis functions. the correct choice of these basisfunctions is fundamental to the efficiency and effectiveness of the matching -the chosen bases should represent the underlying signal using a reasonablysmall number of shapes, and/or have a minimum number of user-adjustable tuningparameters. we examine methods whose bases comprise multiple gauss-hermitepolynomials, as well as a form free basis composed of delta-functions. kernelsderived from delta-functions are unsurprisingly shown to be more expressive;they are able to take more general shapes and perform better in situationswhere sum-of-gaussian methods are known to fail. however, due to its manydegrees of freedom (the maximum number allowed by the kernel size) this basistends to overfit the problem, and yields noisy kernels having large variance.we introduce a new technique to regularize these delta-function kernelsolutions, which bridges the gap between the generality of delta-functionkernels, and the compactness of sum-of-gaussian kernels. through thisregularization we are able to create general kernel solutions that representthe intrinsic shape of the psf-matching kernel with only one degree of freedom,the strength of the regularization lambda. the role of lambda is effectively toexchange variance in the resulting difference image with variance in the kernelitself. we examine considerations in choosing the value of lambda, includingstatistical risk estimators and the ability of the solution to predictsolutions for adjacent areas. both of these suggest moderate strengths oflambda between 0.1 and 1.0, although this optimization is likely datasetdependent.

astro-ph;0001272	the macho project: microlensing results from 5.7 years of lmc  observations	we report on our search for microlensing towards the large magellanic cloud(lmc). analysis of 5.7 years of photometry on 11.9 million stars in the lmcreveals 13 - 17 microlensing events. this is significantly more than the $\sim$2 to 4 events expected from lensing by known stellar populations. thetimescales ($\that$) of the events range from 34 to 230 days. we estimate themicrolensing optical depth towards the lmc from events with $2 &lt; \that &lt; 400$days to be 1.2 ^{+0.4}_ {-0.3} \ten{-7}$, with an additional 20% to 30% ofsystematic error. the spatial distribution of events is mildly inconsistentwith lmc/lmc disk self-lensing, but is consistent with an extended lensdistribution such as a milky way or lmc halo. interpreted in the context of agalactic dark matter halo, consisting partially of compact objects, a maximumlikelihood analysis gives a macho halo fraction of 20% for a typical halo modelwith a 95% confidence interval of 8% to 50%. a 100% macho halo is ruled out atthe 95% c.l. for all except our most extreme halo model. interpreted as agalactic halo population, the most likely macho mass is between $ 0.15 \msun$and $ 0.9 \msun$, depending on the halo model, and the total mass in machos outto 50 kpc is found to be 9+4-3 10^{10} msun, independent of the halo model.these results are marginally consistent with our previous results, but arelower by about a factor of two. besides a larger data set, this work alsoincludes an improved efficiency determination, improved likelihood analysis,and more thorough testing of systematic errors, especially with respect to thetreatment of potential backgrounds to microlensing, such as supernovae ingalaxies behind the lmc.

astro-ph;0001435	the macho project 9 million star color-magnitude diagram of the large  magellanic cloud	we present a 9 million star color-magnitude diagram (9m cmd) of the lmc bar.the 9m cmd reveals a complex superposition of different age and metallicitystellar populations, with important stellar evolutionary phases occurring over3 orders of magnitude in number density. first, we count the non-variablesupergiants, the associated cepheids, and measure the effective temperaturesdefining the instability strip. lifetime predictions of stellar evolutiontheory are tested, with implications for the origin of low-luminosity cepheids.the highly-evolved agb stars have a bimodal distribution in brightness, whichwe interpret as discrete old populations (&gt;1 gyr). the faint agb may bemetal-poor and very old. we identify the clusters ngc 411 and m3 as templatesfor the admixture of old stellar populations. however, there are indicationsthat the old and metal-poor field population has a red hb morphology: the rrlyraes lie on the red edge of the instability strip, the agb-bump is very red,and the ratio of agb-bump stars to rr lyraes is quite large. if the hb secondparameter is age, the old and metal-poor field population likely formed afterthe oldest clusters. lifetime predictions of stellar evolution theory lead usto associate a significant fraction of the red hb clump giants with the sameold and metal-poor population producing the rr lyraes and the agb-bump. in thiscase, compared to the age-dependent luminosity predictions of stellar evolutiontheory, the red hb clump is too bright relative to the rr lyraes and agb-bump.last, the surface density profile of rr lyraes is fit by an exponential,favoring a disk-like rather than spheroidal distribution. we conclude that theage of the lmc disk is probably similar to the age of the galactic disk.(abridged)

astro-ph;0002510	the macho project: microlensing optical depth towards the galactic bulge  from difference image analysis	we present the microlensing optical depth towards the galactic bulge based onthe detection of 99 events found in our difference image analysis (dia) survey.this analysis encompasses three years of data, covering ~ 17 million stars in ~4 deg^2, to a source star baseline magnitude limit of v = 23. the dia techniqueimproves the quality of photometry in crowded fields, and allows us to detectmore microlensing events with faint source stars. we find this method increasesthe number of detection events by 85% compared with the standard analysistechnique. dia light curves of the events are presented and the microlensingfit parameters are given. the total microlensing optical depth is estimated tobe tau_(total)= 2.43^(+0.39/-0.38) x 10^(-6) averaged over 8 fields centered atl=2.68 and b=-3.35. for the bulge component we findtau_(bulge)=3.23^(+0.52/-0.50) x 10^(-6) assuming a 25% stellar contributionfrom disk sources. these optical depths are in good agreement with the pastdeterminations of the macho alcock et al. (1997) and ogle udalski et al. (1994)groups, and are higher than predicted by contemporary galactic models. we showthat our observed event timescale distribution is consistent with thedistribution expected from normal mass stars, if we adopt the stellar massfunction of scalo (1986) as our lens mass function. however, we note that asthere is still disagreement about the exact form of the stellar mass function,there is uncertainty in this conclusion. based on our event timescaledistribution we find no evidence for the existence of a large population ofbrown dwarfs in the direction of the galactic bulge.

astro-ph;0008282	the macho project hubble space telescope follow-up: preliminary results  on the location of the large magellanic cloud microlensing source stars	we attempt to determine whether the macho microlensing source stars are drawnfrom the average population of the lmc or from a population behind the lmc byexamining the hst color-magnitude diagram (cmd) of microlensing source stars.we present wfpc2 hst photometry of eight macho microlensing source stars andthe surrounding fields in the lmc. the microlensing source stars are identifiedby deriving accurate centroids in the ground-based macho images usingdifference image analysis (dia) and then transforming the dia coordinates tothe hst frame. we consider in detail a model for the background population ofsource stars based on that presented by zhao, graff &amp; guhathakurta. in thismodel, the source stars have an additional reddening &lt;e(b-v)&gt; = 0.13 mag and aslightly larger distance modulus &lt;delta mu&gt; ~ 0.3 mag than the average lmcpopulation. we also investigate a series of source star models, varying therelative fraction of source stars drawn from the average and backgroundpopulations and the displacement of the background population from the lmc. dueto the small number of analyzed events the distribution of probabilities ofdifferent models is rather flat. a shallow maximum occurs at a fraction s_lmc ~0.8 of the source stars in the lmc. this is consistent with the interpretationthat a significant fraction of observed microlensing events are due to lensesin the milky way halo, but does not definitively exclude other models.

astro-ph;0012163	macho 96-lmc-2: lensing of a binary source in the lmc and constraints on  the lensing object	we present photometry and analysis of the microlensing alert macho 96-lmc-2.the ~3% photometry provided by the global microlensing alert network follow--upeffort reveals a periodic modulation in the lightcurve. we attribute this tobinarity of the lensed source. microlensing fits to a rotating binary sourcemagnified by a single lens converge on two minima, separated by delta chi^2 ~1. the most significant fit x1 predicts a primary which contributes ~100% ofthe light, a dark secondary, and an orbital period (t) of 9.2 days. the secondfit x2 yields a binary source with two stars of roughly equal mass andluminosity, and t = 21.2 days.  the lensed object appears to lie on the upper lmc main sequence. we estimatethe mass of the primary component of the binary system, m ~2 m_sun. for thepreferred model x1, we explore the range of dark companions by assuming 0.1m_sun and 1.4 m_sun objects in models x1a and x1b, respectively. we find lensvelocities projected to the lmc in these models of v^hat_x1a = 18.3 +/- 3.1km/s and v^hat_x1b = 188 +/- 32 k/ms. in both these cases, a likelihoodanalysis suggests an lmc lens is preferred over a galactic halo lens, althoughonly marginally so in model x1b. we also find v^hat_x2 = 39.6 +/- 6.1 k/ms,where the likelihood for the lens location is strongly dominated by the lmcdisk. in all cases, the lens mass is consistent with that of an m-dwarf. thelmc self-lensing rate contributed by 96-lmc-2 is consistent with modelself-lensing rates.

astro-ph;0109467	gravitational microlensing events due to stellar mass black holes	we present an analysis of the longest timescale microlensing eventsdiscovered by the macho collaboration during a 7 year survey of the galacticbulge. we find 6 events that exhibit very strong microlensing parallax signalsdue, in part, to accurate photometric data from the gman and mpscollaborations. the microlensing parallax fit parameters are used in alikelihood analysis, which is able to estimate the distance and masses of thelens objects based upon a standard model of the galactic velocity distribution.this analysis indicates that the most likely masses of 5 of the 6 lenses are &gt;1 msun, which suggests that a substantial fraction of the galactic lenses maybe massive stellar remnants. this could explain the observed excess of longtimescale microlensing events. the lenses for events macho-96-blg-5 andmacho-98-blg-6 are the most massive, with mass estimates of m/msun = 6 +10/-3and m/msun = 6 +7/-3, respectively. the observed upper limits on the absolutebrightness of main sequence stars for these lenses are &lt; 1 lsun, so both lensesare black hole candidates. the black hole interpretation is also favored by alikelihood analysis with a bayesian prior using a conventional model for thelens mass function. we consider the possibility that the source stars for someof these 6 events may lie in the foreground or background of the galacticbulge, but we find that this is unlikely. future hst observations of theseevents can either confirm the black hole lens hypothesis or detect the lensstars and provide a direct measurement of their masses. future observations ofsimilar events by sim or the keck or vlti interferometers will allow directmeasurements of the lens masses for stellar remnant lenses as well.

astro-ph;0201481	the macho project lmc variable star inventory: xii. three cepheid  variables in eclipsing binaries	we present a method for solving the lightcurve of an eclipsing binary systemwhich contains a cepheid variable as one of its components as well as thesolutions for three eclipsing cepheids in the large magellanic cloud (lmc). ageometric model is constructed in which the component stars are assumed to bespherical and on circular orbits. the emergent system flux is computed as afunction of time, with the intrinsic variations in temperature and radius ofthe cepheid treated self-consistently. fitting the adopted model to photometricobservations, incorporating data from multiple bandpasses, yields a singleparameter set best describing the system. this method is applied to threeeclipsing cepheid systems from the macho project lmc database: macho id's6.6454.5, 78.6338.24 and 81.8997.87. a best-fit value is obtained for eachsystem's orbital period and inclination and for the relative radius, color andlimb-darkening coefficients of each star. pulsation periods andparameterizations of the intrinsic color variations of the cepheids are alsoobtained and the amplitude of the radial pulsation of each cepheid is measureddirectly. the system 6.6454.5 is found to contain a 4.97-day cepheid, whichcannot be definitely classified as type i or type ii, with an unexpectedlybrighter companion. the system 78.6338.24 consists of a 17.7-day, w vir classtype ii cepheid with a smaller, dimmer companion. the system 81.8997.87contains an intermediate-mass, 2.03-day overtone cepheid with a dimmer, redgiant secondary.

astro-ph;0304464	recent microlensing results from the macho project	we describe a few recent microlensing results from the macho collaboration.the aim of the macho project was the identification and quantitativedescription of dark and luminous matter in the milky way using microlensingtoward the magellanic clouds and galactic bulge. we start with a discussion ofthe hst follow-up observations of the microlensing events toward the lmcdetected in the first 5 years of the experiment. using color-magnitude diagramswe attempt to distinguish between two possible locations of the microlensingsources: 1) in the lmc or 2) behind the lmc. we conclude that unless theextinction is extremely patchy, it is very unlikely that most of the lmc eventshave sources behind the lmc. during an examination of the hst images of the 13lmc events we found a very red object next to the source star of event lmc-5.astrometry, microlensing parallax fit, and a spectrum suggest that in this casewe directly image the lens - a low-mass disk star.  then we focus on the majority of events observed by the macho project, whichare detected toward the galactic bulge. we argue that the microlensing opticaldepth toward the bulge is best measured using events that have clump giantsources, which are almost unaffected by blending. from this sample we derive alow optical depth toward the galactic bulge of (1.4 +/- 0.3) x 10^{-6}, in goodagreement with other observational constraints and with theoretical models. thepresence of many long-duration events among the bulge candidates allows us toinvestigate the microlensing parallax effect. events with the strongestparallax signal are probably due to massive remnants. events macho-96-blg-5 andmacho-98-blg-6 might have been caused by the 6-solar-mass black holes.

astro-ph;0310281	the macho project large magellanic cloud variable star inventory. xiii.  fourier parameters for the first overtone rr lyrae variables and the lmc  distance	fourier coefficents have been derived for the $v$ and $r$ light curves of 785overtone rr lyrae variables in 16 macho fields near the bar of the lmc. the$\phi_{31}$ and $r_{21}$ coefficients have been compared with those of thefirst overtone rr lyrae variables in the galactic globular clusters ngc 6441,m107, m5, m3, m2, $\omega$ centauri and m68. the results indicate that many ofthe lmc variables have properties similar to the ones in m2, m3, m5 and theoosterhoff type i variables in $\omega$ cen, but they are different from theoosterhoff type ii variables in $\omega$ cen. equations derived fromhydrodynamic pulsation models have been used to calculate the luminosity andtemperature for the 330 bona fide first-overtone variables. the resultsindicate that they have $\log l$ in the range 1.6 to $1.8\lsun$ and $\logt_{eff}$ between 3.85 and 3.87. based on these temperatures, a mean colorexcess $e(v-r) =0.08$ mag, equivalent to $e(b-v)=0.14$ mag, has been estimatedfor these 330 stars. the 80 m5-like variables (selected according to theirlocation in the $\phi_{31}-\log p$ plot) are used to determine a lmc distance.after correcting for the effects of extinction and crowding, a mean apparentmagnitude $&lt;v_0&gt;=18.99 \pm 0.02$ (statistical) $\pm 0.16$ (systematic) has beenestimated for these 80 stars. combining this with a mean absolute magnitude$m_v=0.56\pm 0.06$ for m5-like stars derived from baade-wesselink analyses,main sequence fitting, fourier parameters and the trigonometric parallax of rrlyrae, we derive an lmc distance modulus $\mu=18.43\pm 0.06$ (statistical) $\pm0.16$ (systematic) mag. the large systematic error arises from the difficultiesof correcting for interstellar extinction and for crowding.

astro-ph;0404416	the deep lens survey transient search i : short timescale and  astrometric variability	we report on the methodology and first results from the deep lens surveytransient search. we utilize image subtraction on survey data to yield allsources of optical variability down to 24th magnitude. images are analyzedimmediately after acquisition, at the telescope and in near-real time, to allowfor followup in the case of time-critical events. all classes of transients areposted to the web upon detection. our observing strategy allows sensitivity tovariability over several decades in timescale. the dls is the first survey toclassify and report all types of photometric and astrometric variabilitydetected, including solar system objects, variable stars, supernovae, and shorttimescale phenomena. three unusual optical transient events were detected,flaring on thousand-second timescales. all three events were seen in the bpassband, suggesting blue color indices for the phenomena. one event (ot20020115) is determined to be from a flaring galactic dwarf star of spectraltype dm4. from the remaining two events, we find an overall rate of \eta = 1.4events deg-2 day-1 on thousand-second timescales, with a 95% confidence limitof \eta &lt; 4.3. one of these events (ot 20010326) originated from a compactprecursor in the field of galaxy cluster abell 1836, and its nature isuncertain. for the second (ot 20030305) we find strong evidence for an extendedextragalactic host. a dearth of such events in the r passband yields an upper95% confidence limit on short timescale astronomical variability between 19.5 &lt;r &lt; 23.4 of \eta_r &lt; 5.2. we report also on our ensemble of astrometricallyvariable objects, as well as an example of photometric variability with anundetected precursor.

astro-ph;0410319	microlensing optical depth towards the galactic bulge using clump giants  from the macho survey	using 7 years of macho survey data, we present a new determination of theoptical depth to microlensing towards the galactic bulge. we select the sampleof 62 microlensing events (60 unique) on clump giant sources and perform adetailed efficiency analysis. we use only the clump giant sources because theseare bright bulge stars and are not as strongly affected by blending as otherevents. using a subsample of 42 clump events concentrated in just 4.5 squaredegrees, we find tau = 2.17^{+0.47}_{-0.38} x 10^{-6} at (l,b) = (1.50, -2.68),somewhat smaller than found in most previous macho studies, but in excellentagreement with recent theoretical predictions. we also present the opticaldepth in each of the 19 fields in which we detected events, and find limits onoptical depth for fields with no events. the errors in optical depth inindividual fields are dominated by poisson noise. we measure optical depthgradients (1.06 +/- 0.71) x 10^{-6} deg^{-1} and (0.29 +/- 0.43) x 10^{-6}deg^{-1} in the galactic latitude b and longitude l directions, respectively.finally, we discuss the possibility of anomalous duration distribution ofevents in the field 104 centered on (l,b) = (3.11, -3.01) as well asinvestigate spatial clustering of events in all fields.

astro-ph;9702199	macho alert 95-30 : first real-time observation of extended source  effects in gravitational microlensing	we present analysis of macho alert 95-30, a dramatic gravitationalmicrolensing event towards the galactic bulge whose peak magnification departssignificantly from the standard point-source microlensing model. alert 95-30was observed in real-time by the global microlensing alert network (gman),which obtained densely sampled photometric and spectroscopic data throughoutthe event. we interpret the light-curve ``fine structure'' as indicatingtransit of the lens across the extended face of the source star. this signifiesresolution of a star several kpc distant. we find a lens angular impactparameter theta_{min}/theta_{source} = 0.715 +/- 0.003. this information, alongwith the radius and distance of the source, provides an additional constrainton the lensing system. spectroscopic and photometric data indicate the sourceis an m4 iii star of radius 61 +/- 12 rsun, located on the far side of thebulge at 9 kpc. we derive a lens angular velocity, relative to the source, of21.5 +/- 4.9 km/s/kpc, where the error is dominated by uncertainty in thesource radius. likelihood analysis yields a median lens mass of0.67{+2.53}{-0.46} msun, located with 80% probability in the galactic bulge ata distance of 6.93{+1.56}{-2.25} kpc. if the lens is a main-sequence star, wecan include constraints on the lens luminosity. this modifies our estimates tom_lens = 0.53{+0.52}{-0.35} msun and d_lens = 6.57{+0.99}{-2.25} kpc. spectrataken during the event show that the absorption line equivalent widths of halpha and the tio bands near 6700 a vary, as predicted for microlensing of anextended source. this is most likely due to center-to-limb variation in thestellar spectral lines. these data demonstrate the feasibility of usingmicrolensing limb crossings as a tool to probe stellar atmospheres directly.

astro-ph;9807163	discovery and characterization of a caustic crossing microlensing event  in the smc	we present photometric observations and analysis of the second microlensingevent detected towards the small magellanic cloud (smc), macho alert 98-smc-1.this event was detected early enough to allow intensive observation of thelightcurve. these observations revealed 98-smc-1 to be the first causticcrossing, binary microlensing event towards the magellanic clouds to bediscovered in progress.  frequent coverage of the evolving lightcurve allowed an accurate predictionfor the date of the source crossing out of the lens caustic structure. thecaustic crossing temporal width, along with the angular size of the sourcestar, measures the proper motion of the lens with respect to the source, andthus allows an estimate of the location of the lens. lenses located in thegalactic halo would have a velocity projected to the smc of v^hat ~1500 km/s,while an smc lens would typically have v^hat ~60 km/s.  we have performed a joint fit to the macho/gman data presented here,including recent eros data of this event. these joint data are sufficient toconstrain the time for the lens to move an angle equal to the source angularradius; 0.116 +/- 0.010 days. we estimate a radius for the lensed source of 1.4+/- 0.1 r_sun. this yields a projected velocity of v^hat = 84 +/- 9 km/s. only0.15% of halo lenses would be expected to have a v^hat value at least as smallas this, while 31% of smc lenses would be expected to have v^hat as large asthis. this implies that the lensing system is more likely to reside in the smcthan in the galactic halo.

astro-ph;9811240	the macho project large magellanic cloud variable star inventory. viii.  the recent star formation history of the lmc from the cepheid period  distribution	we present an analysis of the period distribution of $\sim 1800$ cepheids inthe large magellanic cloud, based on data obtained by the macho microlensingexperiment and on a previous catalogue by payne-gaposchkin. using stellarevolution and pulsation models, we construct theoretical period-frequencydistributions that are compared to the observations. these models reveal that asignificant burst of star formation has occurred recently in the lmc ($\sim1.15\times 10^8$ years). we also show that during the last $\sim 10^8$ years,the main center of star formation has been propagating from se to nw along thebar. we find that the evolutionary masses of cepheids are still smaller thanpulsation masses by $\sim 7$ % and that the red edge of the cepheid instabilitystrip could be slightly bluer than indicated by theory. there are $\sim 600$cepheids with periods below $\sim 2.5$ days cannot be explained by evolutiontheory. we suggest that they are anomalous cepheids; a number of these starsare double-mode cepheids.

astro-ph;9812252	observations of the binary microlens event macho-98-smc-1 by the  microlensing planet search collaboration	we present the observations of the binary lensing event macho-98-smc-1conducted at the mt.~stromlo 74" telescope by the microlensing planet search(mps) collaboration. the mps data constrain the first caustic crossing to haveoccurred after 1998 june 5.55 ut and thus directly rule out one of the two fitspresented by the planet collaboration (model ii). this substantially reducesthe uncertainty in the the relative proper motion estimations of the lensobject.  we perform joint binary microlensing fits of the mps data together with thepublicly available data from the eros, macho/gman and ogle collaborations. wealso study the binary lens fit parameters previously published by the planetand macho/gman collaborations by using them as initial values for $\chi^2$minimization. fits based on the planet model i appear to be in conflict withthe gman-ctio data. from our best fit, we find that the lens system has aproper motion of $\mu = 1.3\pm 0.2 \kmsk$ with respect to the source, whichimplies that the lens system is most likely to be located in the smallmagellanic cloud strengthening the conclusion of previous reports.

astro-ph;9903215	difference image analysis of galactic microlensing i. data analysis	this is a preliminary report on the application of difference image analysis(dia) to galactic bulge images. the aim of this analysis is to increase thesensitivity to the detection of gravitational microlensing. we discuss how thedia technique simplifies the process of discovering microlensing events bydetecting only objects which have variable flux. we illustrate how the diatechnique is not limited to detection of so called ``pixel lensing'' events,but can also be used to improve photometry for classical microlensing events byremoving the effects of blending. we will present a method whereby dia can beused to reveal the true unblended colours, positions and light curves ofmicrolensing events. we discuss the need for a technique to obtain the accuratemicrolensing time scales from blended sources, and present a possible solutionto this problem using the existing hst colour magnitude diagrams of thegalactic bulge and lmc. the use of such a solution with both classical andpixel microlensing searches is discussed. we show that one of the major causesof systematic noise in dia is differential refraction. a technique for removingthis systematic by effectively registering images to a common airmass ispresented. improvements to commonly used image differencing techniques arediscussed.

astro-ph;9905151	on planetary companions to the macho-98-blg-35 microlens star	we present observations of microlensing event macho-98-blg-35 which reached apeak magnification factor of almost 80. these observations by the microlensingplanet search (mps) and the moa collaborations place strong constraints on thepossible planetary system of the lens star and show intriguing evidence for alow mass planet with a mass fraction $4\times 10^{-5} \leq \epsilon \leq2\times 10^{-4}$. a giant planet with $\epsilon = 10^{-3}$ is excluded from 95%of the region between 0.4 and 2.5 $r_e$ from the lens star, where $r_e$ is theeinstein ring radius of the lens. this exclusion region is more extensive thanthe generic "lensing zone" which is $0.6 - 1.6 r_e$. for smaller mass planets,we can exclude 57% of the "lensing zone" for $\epsilon = 10^{-4}$ and 14% ofthe lensing zone for $\epsilon = 10^{-5}$. the mass fraction $\epsilon =10^{-5}$ corresponds to an earth mass planet for a lensing star of mass $\sim0.3 \msun$. a number of similar events will provide statistically significantconstraints on the prevalence of earth mass planets. in order to put our limitsin more familiar terms, we have compared our results to those expected for asolar system clone averaging over possible lens system distances andorientations. we find that such a system is ruled out at the 90% confidencelevel. a copy of the solar system with jupiter replaced by a second saturn massplanet can be ruled out at 70% confidence. our low mass planetary signal (fewearth masses to neptune mass) is significant at the $4.5\sigma$ confidencelevel. if this planetary interpretation is correct, the macho-98-blg-35 lenssystem constitutes the first detection of a low mass planet orbiting anordinary star without gas giant planets.

astro-ph;9908038	gravitational microlensing evidence for a planet orbiting a binary star  system	the study of extra-solar planetary systems has emerged as a new discipline ofobservational astronomy in the past few years with the discovery of a number ofextra-solar planets. the properties of most of these extra-solar planets werenot anticipated by theoretical work on the formation of planetary systems. herewe report observations and light curve modeling of gravitational microlensingevent macho-97-blg-41, which indicates that the lens system consists of aplanet orbiting a binary star system. according to this model, the mass ratioof the binary star system is 3.8:1 and the stars are most likely to be a late kdwarf and an m dwarf with a separation of about 1.8 au. a planet of about 3jupiter masses orbits this system at a distance of about 7 au. if ourinterpretation of this light curve is correct, it represents the firstdiscovery of a planet orbiting a binary star system and the first detection ofa jovian planet via the gravitational microlensing technique. it suggests thatgiant planets may be common in short period binary star systems.

astro-ph;9909227	calibration of the macho photometry database	the macho project is a microlensing survey that monitors the brightnesses of60 million stars in the large magellanic cloud (lmc), small magellanic cloud,and galactic bulge. our database presently contains about 80 billionphotometric measurements, a significant fraction of all astronomicalphotometry. we describe the calibration of macho two-color photometry andtransformation to the standard kron-cousins v and r system. calibrated machophotometry may be properly compared with all other observations on thekron-cousins standard system, enhancing the astrophysical value of these data.for 9 million stars in the lmc bar, independent photometric measurements of20,000 stars with v &lt; 18 mag in field-overlap regions demonstrate an internalprecision sigv = 0.021, sigr = 0.019, and sig(v-r) = 0.028 mag. the accuracy ofthe zero-point in this calibration is estimated to be +-0.035 mag for starswith colors in the range -0.1 &lt; (v-r) &lt; 1.2 mag. a comparison of calibratedmacho photometry with published photometric sequences and new hubble spacetelescope observations shows agreement. the current calibration zero-pointuncertainty for the remainder of the macho photometry database is estimated tobe +- 0.10 mag in v or r and +-0.04 mag in (v-r). we describe the firstapplication of calibrated macho photometry data: the construction of acolor-magnitude diagram used to calculate our experimental sensitivity todetect microlensing in the lmc.

0810.5155	parametrization and classification of 20 billion lsst objects: lessons  from sdss	the large synoptic survey telescope (lsst) will be a large, wide-fieldground-based system designed to obtain, starting in 2015, multiple images ofthe sky that is visible from cerro pachon in northern chile. about 90% of theobserving time will be devoted to a deep-wide-fast survey mode which willobserve a 20,000 deg$^2$ region about 1000 times during the anticipated 10years of operations (distributed over six bands, $ugrizy$). each 30-second longvisit will deliver 5$\sigma$ depth for point sources of $r\sim24.5$ on average.the co-added map will be about 3 magnitudes deeper, and will include 10 billiongalaxies and a similar number of stars. we discuss various measurements thatwill be automatically performed for these 20 billion sources, and how they canbe used for classification and determination of source physical and otherproperties. we provide a few classification examples based on sdss data, suchas color classification of stars, color-spatial proximity search for wide-anglebinary stars, orbital-color classification of asteroid families, and therecognition of main galaxy components based on the distribution of stars in theposition-metallicity-kinematics space. guided by these examples, we anticipatethat two grand classification challenges for lsst will be 1) rapid and robustclassification of sources detected in difference images, and 2) {\itsimultaneous} treatment of diverse astrometric and photometric time seriesmeasurements for an unprecedentedly large number of objects.
