1302.7002	a rapidly spinning supermassive black hole at the centre of ngc 1365	broad x-ray emission lines from neutral and partially ionized iron observedin active galaxies have been interpreted as fluorescence produced by thereflection of hard x-rays off the inner edge of an accretion disk. in thismodel, line broadening and distortion result from rapid rotation andrelativistic effects near the black hole, the line shape being sensitive to itsspin. alternative models in which the distortions result from absorption byintervening structures provide an equally good description of the data, andthere has been no general agreement on which is correct. recent claims that theblack hole (2e6 solar masses) at the centre of the galaxy ngc 1365 is rotatingat close to its maximum possible speed rest on the assumption of relativisticreflection. here we report x-ray observations of ngc 1365 that reveal therelativistic disk features through broadened fe line emission and an associatedcompton scattering excess of 10-30 kev. using temporal and spectral analyses,we disentangle continuum changes due to time-variable absorption fromreflection, which we find arises from a region within 2.5 gravitational radiiof the rapidly spinning black hole. absorption-dominated models that do notinclude relativistic disk reflection can be ruled out both statistically and onphysical grounds.

1306.3500	weak hard x-ray emission from two broad absorption line quasars observed  with nustar: compton-thick absorption or intrinsic x-ray weakness?	we present nustar hard x-ray observations of two x-ray weak broad absorptionline (bal) quasars, pg 1004+130 (radio loud) and pg 1700+518 (radio quiet).many bal quasars appear x-ray weak, probably due to absorption by the shieldinggas between the nucleus and the accretion-disk wind. the two targets are amongthe optically brightest bal quasars, yet they are known to be significantlyx-ray weak at rest-frame 2-10 kev (16-120 times fainter than typical quasars).we would expect to obtain ~400-600 hard x-ray (&gt;10 kev) photons with nustar,provided that these photons are not significantly absorbed (nh&lt;1e24 cm^{-2}).however, both bal quasars are only detected in the softer nustar bands (e.g.,4-20 kev) but not in its harder bands (e.g., 20-30 kev), suggesting that eitherthe shielding gas is highly compton-thick or the two targets are intrinsicallyx-ray weak. we constrain the column densities for both to be nh~7e24 cm^{-2} ifthe weak hard x-ray emission is caused by obscuration from the shielding gas.we discuss a few possibilities for how pg 1004+130 could have compton-thickshielding gas without strong fe k? line emission; dilution from jet-linkedx-ray emission is one likely explanation. we also discuss the intrinsic x-rayweakness scenario based on a coronal-quenching model relevant to the shieldinggas and disk wind of bal quasars. motivated by our nustar results, we perform achandra stacking analysis with the large bright quasar survey bal quasar sampleand place statistical constraints upon the fraction of intrinsically x-ray weakbal quasars; this fraction is likely 17-40%.

1307.1733	the nustar extragalactic survey: a first sensitive look at the  high-energy cosmic x-ray background population	we report on the first ten identifications of sources serendipitouslydetected by the nustar to provide the first sensitive census of the cosmicx-ray background (cxb) source population at &gt;10 kev. we find that thesenustar-detected sources are ~100x fainter than those previously detected at &gt;10kev and have a broad range in redshift and luminosity (z=0.020-2.923 andl_10-40 kev~4x10^{41}-5x10^{45} erg/s); the median redshift and luminosity arez~0.7 and l_10-40 kev~3x10^{44} erg/s, respectively. we characterize thesesources on the basis of broad-band ~0.5-32 kev spectroscopy, opticalspectroscopy, and broad-band ultraviolet-to-mid-infrared sed analyzes. we findthat the dominant source population is quasars with l_10-40 kev&gt;10^{44} erg/s,of which ~50% are obscured with n_h&gt;10^{22} cm^{-2}. however, none of the tennustar sources are compton thick (n_h&gt;10^{24} cm^{-2}) and we place a 90%confidence upper limit on the fraction of compton-thick quasars (l_10-40kev&gt;10^{44} erg/s) selected at &gt;10 kev of ~33% over the redshift rangez=0.5-1.1. we jointly fitted the rest-frame ~10-40 kev data for all of thenon-beamed sources with l_10-40 kev&gt;10^{43} erg/s to constrain the averagestrength of reflection; we find r&lt;1.4 for \gamma=1.8, broadly consistent withthat found for local agns observed at &gt;10 kev. we also constrain the hostgalaxy masses and find a median stellar mass of ~10^{11} m_sun, a factor ~5times higher than the median stellar mass of nearby high-energy selected agns,which may be at least partially driven by the order of magnitude higher x-rayluminosities of the nustar sources. within the low source-statistic limitationsof our study, our results suggest that the overall properties of the nustarsources are broadly similar to those of nearby high-energy selected agns butscaled up in luminosity and mass.

1308.4669	nustar spectroscopy of grs 1915+105: disk reflection, spin, and  connections to jets	we report on the results of spectral fits made to a nustar observation of theblack hole grs 1915+105 in a "plateau" state. this state is of special interestbecause it is similar to the "low/hard" state seen in other black holes,especially in that compact, steady jets are launched in this phase. the 3-79kev bandpass of nustar, and its ability to obtain moderate-resolution spectrafree from distortions such as photon pile-up, are extremely well suited tostudies of disk reflection in x-ray binaries. in only 15 ks of net exposure, anextraordinarily sensitive spectrum of grs 1915+105 was measured across the fullbandpass. ionized reflection from a disk around a rapidly-spinning black holeis clearly required to fit the spectra; even hybrid comptonization modelsincluding ionized reflection from a disk around a schwarzschild black holeproved inadequate. a spin parameter of a = 0.98 +/- 0.01 (1-sigma statisticalerror) is measured via the best-fit model; low spins are ruled out at a highlevel of confidence. this result suggests that jets can be launched from a diskextending to the innermost stable circular orbit. a very steep inner diskemissivity profile is also measured, consistent with models of compact coronaeabove kerr black holes. these results support an emerging association betweenthe hard x-ray corona and the base of the relativistic jet.

1309.4494	first results from nustar observations of mkn 421	mkn 421 is a nearby active galactic nucleus dominated at all wavelengths by avery broad non-thermal continuum thought to arise from a relativistic jet seenat a small angle to the line of sight. its spectral energy distribution peaksin the x-ray and tev gamma-ray bands, where the energy output is dominated bycooling of high-energy electrons in the jet. in order to study the electrondistribution and its evolution, we carried out a dedicated multi-wavelengthcampaign, including extensive observations by the recently launched highlysensitive hard x-ray telescope nustar, between december 2012 and may 2013. herewe present some initial results based on nustar data from january through march2013, as well as calibration observations conducted in 2012. although theobservations cover some of the faintest hard x-ray flux states ever observedfor mkn 421, the sensitivity is high enough to resolve intra-day spectralvariability. we find that in this low state the dominant flux variations aresmooth on timescales of hours, with typical intra-hour variations of less than5%. we do not find evidence for either a cutoff in the hard x-ray spectrum, ora rise towards a high-energy component, but rather that at low flux thespectrum assumes a power law shape with a photon index of approximately 3. thespectrum is found to harden with increasing brightness.

1310.2633	an extremely luminous and variable ultraluminous x-ray source in the  outskirts of circinus observed with nustar	following a serendipitous detection with the nustar observatory, we present amulti-epoch spectral and temporal analysis of an extreme ultraluminous x-raysource (ulx) located in the outskirts of the circinus galaxy, hereaftercircinus ulx5, including coordinated follow-up observations with xmm-newton andnustar. the nustar data presented here represent one of the first instances ofa ulx reliably detected at hard (e&gt;10 kev) x-rays. circinus ulx5 is variable onlong timescales by at least a factor of ~5 in flux, and was caught in ahistorically bright state during our 2013 observations (0.3-30.0 kev luminosityof 1.6e40 erg/s). during this epoch, the source displayed a curved 3-10 kevspectrum, broadly similar to other bright ulxs. while in many cases theinterpretation of spectral components in ulxs is uncertain, the spectral andtemporal properties of the all the high quality datasets currently availablestrongly support a simple disk-corona model reminiscent of that invoked forgalactic binaries, with the accretion disk becoming more prominent as theluminosity increases. however, although the disk temperature and luminosity areremarkably well correlated across all timescales currently probed, the observedluminosity follows t^(1.70+/-0.17), flatter than that expected for simpleblackbody radiation. the spectral variability displayed by circinus ulx5 ishighly reminiscent of that observed from some known galactic black holebinaries (bhbs) at high luminosities. this comparison would imply a black holemass of ~90 msun for circinus ulx5. however, given the diverse behaviorobserved from galactic bhb accretion disks, this mass estimate is stilluncertain. finally, the limits placed on any undetected iron absorptionfeatures with the 2013 dataset imply that we are not viewing the centralregions of circinus ulx5 through any extreme super-eddington outflow.[abridged]

1310.5776	constraints on the neutron star and inner accretion flow in serpens x-1  using nustar	we report on an observation of the neutron star low-mass x-ray binary serpensx-1, made with nustar. the extraordinary sensitivity afforded by nustarfacilitated the detection of a clear, robust, relativistic fe k emission linefrom the inner disk. a relativistic profile is required over a single gaussianline from any charge state of fe at the 5-sigma level of confidence, and anytwo gaussians of equal width at the same confidence. the comptonback-scattering "hump" peaking in the 10-20 kev band is detected for the firsttime in a neutron star x-ray binary. fits with relativistically-blurred diskreflection models suggest that the disk likely extends close to the innermoststable circular orbit (isco) or stellar surface. the best-fit blurredreflection models constrain the gravitational redshift from the stellar surfaceto be z &gt; 0.16. the data are broadly compatible with the disk extending to theisco; in that case, z &gt; 0.22 and r &lt; 12.6 km (assuming m = 1.4 msun and a=0,where a = cj/gm^2). if the star is as large or larger than its isco, or if theeffective reflecting disk leaks across the isco to the surface, the redshiftconstraints become measurements. we discuss our results in the context ofefforts to measure fundamental properties of neutron stars, and models foraccretion onto compact objects.

1402.4811	{\it nustar} reveals an intrinsically x-ray weak broad absorption line  quasar in the ultraluminous infrared galaxy markarian 231	we present high-energy (3--30 kev) {\it nustar} observations of the nearestquasar, the ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ulirg) markarian 231 (mrk 231),supplemented with new and simultaneous low-energy (0.5--8 kev) data from {\itchandra}. the source was detected, though at much fainter levels thanpreviously reported, likely due to contamination in the large apertures ofprevious non-focusing hard x-ray telescopes. the full band (0.5--30 kev) x-rayspectrum suggests the active galactic nucleus (agn) in mrk 231 is absorbed by apatchy and compton-thin (n$_{\rm h} \sim1.2^{+0.3}_{-0.3}\times10^{23}$cm$^{-2}$) column. the intrinsic x-ray luminosity (l$_{\rm 0.5-30kev}\sim1.0\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{1}$) is extremely weak relative to thebolometric luminosity where the 2--10 kev to bolometric luminosity ratio is$\sim$0.03% compared to the typical values of 2--15%. additionally, mrk 231 hasa low x-ray-to-optical power law slope ($\alpha_{\rm ox}\sim-1.7$). it is alocal example of a low-ionization broad absorption line (lobal) quasar that isintrinsically x-ray weak. the weak ionizing continuum may explain the lack ofmid-infrared [o iv], [ne v], and [ne vi] fine-structure emission lines whichare present in sources with otherwise similar agn properties. we argue that theintrinsic x-ray weakness may be a result of the super-eddington accretionoccurring in the nucleus of this ulirg, and may also be naturally related tothe powerful wind event seen in mrk 231, a merger remnant escaping from itsdusty cocoon.

1403.3078	nustar and xmm-newton observations of luminous, heavily obscured,  wise-selected quasars at z ~ 2	we report on a nustar and xmm-newton program that has observed a sample ofthree extremely luminous, heavily obscured wise-selected agn at z~2 in a broadx-ray band (0.1 - 79 kev). the parent sample, selected to be faint orundetected in the wise 3.4um (w1) and 4.6um (w2) bands but bright at 12um (w3)and 22um (w4), are extremely rare, with only ~1000 so-called w1w2-dropoutsacross the extragalactic sky. optical spectroscopy reveals typical redshifts ofz~2 for this population, implying rest-frame mid-ir luminosities of l(6um)~6e46erg/s and bolometric luminosities that can exceed l(bol)~1e14 l(sun). thecorresponding intrinsic, unobscured hard x-ray luminosities are l(2-10)~4e45erg/s for typical quasar templates. these are amongst the most luminous agnknown, though the optical spectra rarely show evidence of a broad-line regionand the selection criteria imply heavy obscuration even at rest-frame 1.5um. wedesigned our x-ray observations to obtain robust detections for gas columndensities n(h)&lt;1e24 /cm2. in fact, the sources prove to be fainter than thesepredictions. two of the sources were observed by both nustar and xmm-newton,with neither being detected by nustar and one being faintly detected byxmm-newton. a third source was observed only with xmm-newton, yielding a faintdetection. the x-ray data require gas column densities n(h)&gt;1e24 /cm2, implyingthe sources are extremely obscured, consistent with compton-thick, luminousquasars. the discovery of a significant population of heavily obscured,extremely luminous agn does not conform to the standard paradigm of a recedingtorus, in which more luminous quasars are less likely to be obscured. if alarger sample conforms with this finding, then this suggests an additionalsource of obscuration for these extreme sources.

1403.4978	asymmetries in core-collapse supernovae from maps of radioactive  $^{44}$ti in cassiopeiaa	asymmetry is required by most numerical simulations of stellar core-collapseexplosions, but the form it takes differs significantly among models. thespatial distribution of radioactive 44ti, synthesized in an exploding star nearthe boundary between material falling back onto the collapsing core and thatejected into the surrounding medium, directly probes the explosion asymmetries.cassiopeiaa is a young, nearby, core-collapse remnant from which 44ti emissionhas previously been detected but not imaged. asymmetries in the explosion havebeen indirectly inferred from a high ratio of observed 44ti emission toestimated 56ni emission, from optical light echoes, and from jet-like featuresseen in the x-ray and optical ejecta. here we report spatial maps and spectralproperties of the 44ti in cassiopeia a. this may explain the unexpected lack ofcorrelation between the 44ti and iron x-ray emission, the latter being visibleonly in shock-heated material. the observed spatial distribution rules outsymmetric explosions even with a high level of convective mixing, as well ashighly asymmetric bipolar explosions resulting from a fast-rotating progenitor.instead, these observations provide strong evidence for the development oflow-mode convective instabilities in core-collapse supernovae.

1407.1844	nustar unveils a compton-thick type 2 quasar in mrk 34	we present nustar 3-40 kev observations of the optically selected type 2quasar (qso2) sdss j1034+6001 or mrk 34. the high-quality hard x-ray spectrumand archival xmm-newton data can be fitted self-consistently with areflection-dominated continuum and strong fe kalpha fluorescence line withequivalent-width &gt;1 kev. prior x-ray spectral fitting below 10 kev showed thesource to be consistent with being obscured by compton-thin column densities ofgas along the line-of-sight, despite evidence for much higher columns frommultiwavelength data. nustar now enables a direct measurement of this column,and shows that nh lies in the compton-thick (ct) regime. the new data also showa high intrinsic 2-10 kev luminosity of l_{2-10}~10^{44} erg/s, in contrast toprevious low-energy x-ray measurements for which l_{2-10}&lt;~10^{43} erg/s (i.e.x-ray selection below 10 kev does not pick up this source as an intrinsicallyluminous obscured quasar). both the obscuring column and the intrinsic powerare about an order of magnitude (or more) larger than inferred from pre-nustarx-ray spectral fitting. mrk34 is thus a 'gold standard' ct qso2 and is thenearest non-merging system in this class, in contrast to the other local ctquasar ngc6240 which is currently undergoing a major merger coupled with strongstar-formation. for typical x-ray bolometric correction factors, the accretionluminosity of mrk34 is high enough to potentially power the total infraredluminosity. x-ray spectral fitting also shows that thermal emission related tostar-formation is unlikely to drive the observed bright soft component below ~3kev, favoring photionization instead.

1407.8223	the nustar spectrum of mrk 335: extreme relativistic effects within 2  gravitational radii of the event horizon?	we present 3-50 kev nustar observations of the agn mrk 335 in a very low fluxstate. the spectrum is dominated by very strong features at the energies of theiron line at 5-7 kev and compton hump from 10-30 kev. the source is variableduring the observation, with the variability concentrated at low energies,which suggesting either a relativistic reflection or a variable absorptionscenario. in this work we focus on the reflection interpretation, making use ofnew relativistic reflection models that self consistently calculate thereflection fraction, relativistic blurring and angle-dependent reflectionspectrum for different coronal heights to model the spectra. we find that thespectra can be well fit with relativistic reflection, and that the lowest fluxstate spectrum is described by reflection alone, suggesting the effects ofextreme light-bending occurring within ~2 gravitational radii of the eventhorizon. the reflection fraction decreases sharply with increasing flux,consistent with a point source moving up to above 10 rg as the sourcebrightens. we constrain the spin parameter to greater than 0.9 at the 3 sigmaconfidence level. by adding a spin-dependent upper limit on the reflectionfraction to our models, we demonstrate that this can be a powerful way ofconstraining the spin parameter, particularly in reflection dominated states.we also calculate a detailed emissivity profile for the iron line, and findthat it closely matches theoretical predictions for a compact source within afew rg of the black hole.

1408.3633	weak hard x-ray emission from broad absorption line quasars: evidence  for intrinsic x-ray weakness	we report nustar observations of a sample of six x-ray weak broad absorptionline (bal) quasars. these targets, at z=0.148-1.223, are among the opticallybrightest and most luminous bal quasars known at z&lt;1.3. however, theirrest-frame 2 kev luminosities are 14 to &gt;330 times weaker than expected fortypical quasars. our results from a pilot nustar study of two low-redshift balquasars, a chandra stacking analysis of a sample of high-redshift bal quasars,and a nustar spectral analysis of the local bal quasar mrk 231 have alreadysuggested the existence of intrinsically x-ray weak bal quasars, i.e., quasarsnot emitting x-rays at the level expected from their optical/uv emission. theaim of the current program is to extend the search for such extraordinaryobjects. three of the six new targets are weakly detected by nustar with &lt;45counts in the 3-24 kev band, and the other three are not detected. the hardx-ray (8-24 kev) weakness observed by nustar requires compton-thick absorptionif these objects have nominal underlying x-ray emission. however, a softstacked effective photon index ({\gamma}~1.8) for this sample disfavorscompton-thick absorption in general. the uniform hard x-ray weakness observedby nustar for this and the pilot samples selected with &lt;10 kev weakness alsosuggests that the x-ray weakness is intrinsic in at least some of the targets.we conclude that the nustar observations have likely discovered a significantpopulation (&gt;33%) of intrinsically x-ray weak objects among the bal quasarswith significantly weak &lt;10 kev emission. we suggest that intrinsically x-rayweak quasars might be preferentially observed as bal quasars.

1408.5281	nustar reveals the comptonizing corona of the broad-line radio galaxy 3c  382	broad-line radio galaxies (blrgs) are active galactic nuclei that producepowerful, large-scale radio jets, but appear as seyfert 1 galaxies in theiroptical spectra. in the x-ray band, blrgs also appear like seyfert galaxies,but with flatter spectra and weaker reflection features. one explanation forthese properties is that the x-ray continuum is diluted by emission from thejet. here, we present two nustar observations of the blrg 3c 382 that showclear evidence that the continuum of this source is dominated by thermalcomptonization, as in seyfert 1 galaxies. the two observations were separatedby over a year and found 3c 382 in different states separated by a factor of1.7 in flux. the lower flux spectrum has a photon-index of$\gamma=1.68^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$, while the photon-index of the higher fluxspectrum is $\gamma=1.78^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$. thermal and anisotropiccomptonization models provide an excellent fit to both spectra and show thatthe coronal plasma cooled from $kt_e=330\pm 30$ kev in the low flux data to$231^{+50}_{-88}$ kev in the high flux observation. this cooling behavior istypical of comptonizing corona in seyfert galaxies and is distinct from thevariations observed in jet-dominated sources. in the high flux observation,simultaneous swift data are leveraged to obtain a broadband spectral energydistribution and indicates that the corona intercepts $\sim 10$% of the opticaland ultraviolet emitting accretion disk. 3c 382 exhibits very weak reflectionfeatures, with no detectable relativistic fe k$\alpha$ line, that may be bestexplained by an outflowing corona combined with an ionized inner accretiondisk.

1408.5414	the nustar view of nearby compton-thick agn: the cases of ngc 424, ngc  1320 and ic 2560	we present x-ray spectral analyses for three seyfert 2 active galacticnuclei, ngc 424, ngc 1320, and ic 2560, observed by nustar in the 3-79 kevband. the high quality hard x-ray spectra allow detailed modeling of thecompton reflection component for the first time in these sources. usingquasi-simultaneous nustar and swift/xrt data, as well as archival xmm-newtondata, we find that all three nuclei are obscured by compton-thick material withcolumn densities in excess of ~5 x $10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, and that their x-rayspectra above 3 kev are dominated by reflection of the intrinsic continuum oncompton-thick material. due to the very high obscuration, absorbed intrinsiccontinuum components are not formally required by the data in any of thesources. we constrain the intrinsic photon indices and the column density ofthe reflecting medium through the shape of the reflection spectra. usingarchival multi-wavelength data we recover the intrinsic x-ray luminositiesconsistent with the broadband spectral energy distributions. our results areconsistent with the reflecting medium being an edge-on clumpy torus with arelatively large global covering factor and overall reflection efficiency ofthe order of 1%. given the unambiguous confirmation of the compton-thick natureof the sources, we investigate whether similar sources are likely to be missedby commonly used selection criteria for compton-thick agn, and explore thepossibility of finding their high-redshift counterparts.

1410.3357	iron k and compton hump reverberation in swift j2127.4+5654 and ngc 1365  revealed by nustar and xmm-newton	in the past five years, a flurry of x-ray reverberation lag measurements ofaccreting supermassive black holes have been made using the xmm-newtontelescope in the 0.3-10 kev energy range. in this work, we use the nustartelescope to extend the lag analysis up to higher energies for two seyfertgalaxies, swift j2127.4+5654 and ngc 1365. x-ray reverberation lags are due tothe light travel time delays between the direct continuum emission and thereprocessed emission from the inner radii of an ionised accretion disc.xmm-newton has been particularly adept at measuring the lag associated with thebroad fe k emission line, where the gravitationally redshifted wing of the lineis observed to respond before the line centroid at 6.4 kev, produced at largerradii. now we use nustar to probe the lag at higher energies, where thespectrum shows clear evidence for compton reflection, known as the compton'hump'. the xmm-newton data show fe k lags in both swift j2127.4+5654 and ngc1365. the nustar data provide independent confirmation of these fe k lags, andalso show evidence for the corresponding compton hump lags, especially in swiftj2127.4+5654. these broadband lag measurements confirm that the compton humpand fe k lag are produced at small radii. at low-frequencies in ngc 1365, wherethe spectrum shows evidence for eclipsing clouds in the line of sight, we finda clear negative (not positive) lag from 2--10 kev, which can be understood asthe decrease in column density from a neutral eclipsing cloud moving out of ourline of sight during the observation.

1410.3590	an ultraluminous x-ray source powered by an accreting neutron star	ultraluminous x-ray sources (ulx) are off-nuclear point sources in nearbygalaxies whose x-ray luminosity exceeds the theoretical maximum for sphericalinfall (the eddington limit) onto stellar-mass black holes. their luminosityranges from $10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1} &lt; l_x$(0.5 - 10 kev) $&lt;10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$.since higher masses imply less extreme ratios of the luminosity to theisotropic eddington limit theoretical models have focused on black hole ratherthan neutron star systems. the most challenging sources to explain are those atthe luminous end ($l_x$ &gt; $10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$), which require black holemasses mbh &gt;50 solar masses and/or significant departures from the standardthin disk accretion that powers bright galactic x-ray binaries. here we reportbroadband x-ray observations of the nuclear region of the galaxy m82, whichcontains two bright ulxs. the observations reveal pulsations of average period1.37 s with a 2.5-day sinusoidal modulation. the pulsations result from therotation of a magnetized neutron star, and the modulation arises from itsbinary orbit. the pulsed flux alone corresponds to $l_x$(3 - 30 kev) = $4.9\times 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$. the pulsating source is spatially coincident witha variable ulx which can reach $l_x$ (0.3 - 10 kev) = $1.8 \times 10^{40}$ ergs$^{-1}$. this association implies a luminosity ~100 times the eddington limitfor a 1.4 solar mass object, or more than ten times brighter than any knownaccreting pulsar. this finding implies that neutron stars may not be rare inthe ulx population, and it challenges physical models for the accretion ofmatter onto magnetized compact objects.

1411.1573	a nustar observation of the center of the coma cluster	we present the results of a 55ks nustar observation of the core of the comacluster. the global spectrum can be explained by thermal gas emission, with aconservative 90% upper limit to non-thermal inverse compton (ic) emission of$5.1 \times 10^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in a 12 arcmin $\times$ 12 arcminfield of view . the brightness of the thermal component in this central regiondoes not allow more stringent upper limits on the ic component when comparedwith non-imaging instruments with much larger fields of view where claims ofdetections have been made. future mosaic nustar observations of coma willfurther address this issue. the temperature map shows a relatively uniformtemperature distribution with a gradient from the hot northwest side to thecooler southeast, in agreement with previous measurements. the temperaturedetermination is robust given the flat effective area and low background in the3-20 kev band, making nustar an ideal instrument to measure high temperaturesin the intracluster medium.

1411.5974	nustar and xmm-newton observations of the extreme ultraluminous x-ray  source ngc 5907 ulx1: a vanishing act	we present results obtained from two broadband x-ray observations of theextreme ultraluminous x-ray source (ulx) ngc5907 ulx1, known to have a peakx-ray luminosity of ~5e40 erg/s. these xmm-newton and nustar observations,separated by only ~4 days, revealed an extreme level of short-term fluxvariability. in the first epoch, ngc5907 ulx1 was undetected by nustar, andonly weakly detected (if at all) with xmm-newton, while in the second ngc5907ulx1 was clearly detected at high luminosity by both missions. this implies anincrease in flux of ~2 orders of magnitude or more during this ~4 day window.we argue that this is likely due to a rapid rise in the mass accretion rate,rather than to a transition from an extremely obscured to an unobscured state.during the second epoch we observed the broadband 0.3-20.0 kev x-ray luminosityto be (1.55+/-0.06)e40 erg/s, similar to the majority of the archival x-rayobservations. the broadband x-ray spectrum obtained from the second epoch isinconsistent with the low/hard accretion state observed in galactic black holebinaries, but is well modeled with a simple accretion disk model incorporatingthe effects of photon advection. this strongly suggests that, when bright,ngc5907 ulx1 is a high-eddington accretor.

1412.5978	coronal properties of the seyfert 1.9 galaxy mcg -05-23-016 determined  from hard x-ray spectroscopy with nustar	measurements of the high-energy cut-off in the coronal continuum of activegalactic nuclei have long been elusive for all but a small number of thebrightest examples. we present a direct measurement of the cut-off energy inthe nuclear continuum of the nearby seyfert 1.9 galaxy mcg -05-23-016 withunprecedented precision. the high sensitivity of nustar up to 79 kev allows usto clearly disentangle the spectral curvature of the primary continuum fromthat of its reflection component. using a simple phenomenological model for thehard x-ray spectrum, we constrain the cut-off energy to $116_{-5}^{+6}$ kevwith 90% confidence. testing for more complex models and nuisance parametersthat could potentially influence the measurement, we find that the cut-off isdetected robustly. we further use simple comptonized plasma models to provideindependent constraints for both the kinetic temperature of the electrons inthe corona and its optical depth. at the 90% confidence level, we find$kt_e=29\pm2$ kev and $\tau_e=1.23\pm0.08$ assuming a slab (disk-like)geometry, and $kt_e=25\pm2$ kev and $\tau_e=3.5\pm0.2$ assuming a sphericalgeometry. both geometries are found to fit the data equally well and their twoprincipal physical parameters are correlated in both cases. with the opticaldepth in the optically thick regime, the data are pushing the currentlyavailable theoretical models of the comptonized plasma to the limits of theirvalidity. since the spectral features and variability arising from the inneraccretion disk have been observed previously in mcg -05-23-016, the inferredhigh optical depth implies that a spherical or disk-like corona cannot behomogeneous.

1503.04848	nustar and multifrequency study of the two high-redshift blazars s5  0836+710 and pks 2149-306	the most powerful blazars are the flat spectrum radio quasars whose emissionis dominated by a compton component peaking between a few hundred kev and a fewhundred mev. we selected two bright blazars, pks 2149-306 at redshift z=2.345and s5 0836+710 at z=2.172, in order to observe them in the hard x-ray bandwith the nustar satellite. in this band the compton component is rapidly risingalmost up to the peak of the emission. simultaneous soft-x-rays and uv-opticalobservations were performed with the swift satellite, while near-infrared (nir)data were obtained with the rem telescope. to study their variability, werepeated these observations for both sources on a timescale of a few months.while no fast variability was detected during a single observation, bothsources were found to be variable in the x-ray band, up to 50%, between the twoobservations, with larger variability at higher energies. no variability wasdetected in the optical/nir band. these data together with fermi-lat, wise andother literature data are then used to study the overall spectral energydistributions (seds) of these blazars. although the jet non-thermal emissiondominates the sed, it leaves the uv band unhidden, allowing us to detect thethermal emission of the disc and to estimate the mass of the black hole. thenon-thermal emission is well reproduced by a one-zone leptonic model. thenon-thermal radiative processes are synchrotron, self-compton and externalcompton using seed photons from both the broad-line region (blr) and the torus.we find that our data are better reproduced if we assume that the location ofthe dissipation region of the jet, r_diss, is in-between the torus, (atr_torus), and the blr (r_torus&gt;r_diss&gt;r_blr). the observed variability isexplained by changing a minimum number of model parameters by a very smallamount.

1504.00023	nustar, xmm-newton and suzaku observations of the ultraluminous x-ray  source holmberg ii x-1	we present the first broadband 0.3-25.0 kev x-ray observations of the brightultraluminous x-ray source (ulx) holmberg ii x-1, performed by nustar,xmm-newton and suzaku in september 2013. the nustar data provide the firstobservations of holmberg ii x-1 above 10 kev, and reveal a very steephigh-energy spectrum, similar to other ulxs observed by nustar to date. theseobservations further demonstrate that ulxs exhibit spectral states that are nottypically seen in galactic black hole binaries. comparison with other sourcesimplies that holmberg ii x-1 accretes at a high fraction of its eddingtonaccretion rate, and possibly exceeds it. the soft x-ray spectrum (e&lt;10 kev)appears to be dominated by two blackbody-like emission components, the hotterof which may be associated with an accretion disk. however, all simple diskmodels under-predict the nustar data above ~10 kev and require an additionalemission component at the highest energies probed, implying the nustar datadoes not fall away with a wien spectrum. we investigate physical origins forsuch an additional high-energy emission component, and favor a scenario inwhich the excess arises from compton scattering in a hot corona of electronswith some properties similar to the very-high state seen in galactic binaries.the observed broadband 0.3-25.0 kev luminosity inferred from these epochs is lx= (8.1+/-0.1)e39 erg/s, typical for holmberg ii x-1, with the majority of theflux (~90%) emitted below 10 kev.

1505.00789	the 0.3-30 kev spectra of powerful starburst galaxies: nustar and  chandra observations of ngc 3256 and ngc 3310	we present nearly simultaneous chandra and nustar observations of twoactively star-forming galaxies within 50 mpc: ngc 3256 and ngc 3310. bothgalaxies are detected by both chandra and nustar, which together provide thefirst-ever spectra of these two galaxies spanning 0.3-30 kev. the x-rayemission from both galaxies is spatially resolved by chandra; we find that hotgas dominates the e &lt; 1-3 kev emission while ultraluminous x-ray sources (ulxs)dominate at e &gt; 1-3 kev. the nustar galaxy-wide spectra of both galaxies followsteep power-law distributions with gamma ~ 2.6 at e &gt; 5-7 kev, similar to thespectra of bright individual ulxs and other galaxies that have been studied bynustar. we find that both ngc 3256 and ngc 3310 have x-ray detected sourcescoincident with nuclear regions; however, the steep nustar spectra of bothgalaxies restricts these sources to be either low luminosity agn or non-agn innature (e.g., ulxs or crowded x-ray sources that reach l2-10 kev ~ 10^40 erg/scannot be ruled out). combining our constraints on the 0.3-30 kev spectra ofngc 3256 and ngc 3310 with equivalent measurements for nearby star-forminggalaxies m83 and ngc 253, we analyze the sfr-normalized spectra of thesestarburst galaxies. the spectra of all four galaxies show sharply decliningpower-law slopes above 3-6 kev due to ulx populations. our observationstherefore constrain the average spectra of luminous accreting binaries (i.e.,ulxs). this result is similar to the super-eddington accreting ulxs that havebeen studied individually in a targeted nustar ulx program. we also find thatngc 3310 exhibits a factor of ~3-10 elevation of x-ray emission over the otherstar-forming galaxies. we argue that the excess is most likely explained by therelatively low metallicity of the young stellar population in ngc 3310.

1505.02788	distorted cyclotron line profile in cep x-4 as observed by nustar	we present spectral analysis of nustar and swift observations of cep x-4during its outburst in 2014. we observed the source once during the peak of theoutburst and once during the decay, finding good agreement in the spectralshape between the observations. we describe the continuum using a powerlaw witha fermi-dirac cutoff at high energies. cep x-4 has a very strong cyclotronresonant scattering feature (crsf) around 30 kev. a simple absorption-like linewith a gaussian optical depth or a pseudo-lorentzian profile both fail todescribe the shape of the crsf accurately, leaving significant deviations atthe red side of the line. we characterize this asymmetry with a secondabsorption feature around 19 kev. the line energy of the crsf, which is notinfluenced by the addition of this feature, shows a small but significantpositive luminosity dependence. with luminosities between (1-6)e36 erg/s, cepx-4 is below the theoretical limit where such a correlation is expected. thisbehavior is similar to vela x-1 and we discuss parallels between the twosystems.

1506.00007	nustar and suzaku observations of the hard state in cygnus x-1: locating  the inner accretion disk	we present simultaneous nuclear spectroscopic telescope array (nustar ) andsuzaku observations of the x-ray binary cygnus x-1 in the hard state. this isthe first time this state has been observed in cyg x-1 with nustar, whichenables us to study the reflection and broad-band spectra in unprecedenteddetail. we confirm that the iron line cannot be fit with a combination ofnarrow lines and absorption features, and instead requires a relativisticallyblurred profile in combination with a narrow line and absorption from thecompanion wind. we use the reflection models of garcia et al. (2014) tosimultaneously measure the black hole spin, disk inner radius, and coronalheight in a self-consistent manner. detailed fits to the iron line profileindicate a high level of relativistic blurring, indicative of reflection fromthe inner accretion disk. we find a high spin, a small inner disk radius, and alow source height, and rule out truncation to greater than three gravitationalradii at the 3{\sigma} confidence level. in addition, we find that the lineprofile has not changed greatly in the switch from soft to hard states, andthat the differences are consistent with changes in the underlying reflectionspectrum rather than the relativistic blurring. we find that the blurringparameters are consistent when fitting either just the iron line or the entirebroad-band spectrum, which is well modelled with a comptonized continuum plusreflection model.

1506.01381	the complex accretion geometry of gx 339-4 as seen by nustar and swift	we present spectral analysis of five nustar and swift observations of gx339-4 taken during a failed outburst in summer 2013. these observations covereddington luminosity fractions in the range ~0.9-6%. throughout this outburst,gx 339-4 stayed in the hard state, and all five observations show similar x-rayspectra with a hard power-law with a photon index near 1.6 and significantcontribution from reflection. using simple reflection models we findunrealistically high iron abundances. allowing for different photon indices forthe continuum incident on the reflector relative to the underlying observedcontinuum results in a statistically better fit and reduced iron abundances.with a photon index around 1.3, the input power-law on the reflector issignificantly harder than that which is directly observed. we study theinfluence of different emissivity profiles and geometries and consistently findan improvement when using separate photon indices. the inferred inner accretiondisk radius is strongly model dependent, but we do not find evidence for atruncation radius larger than 100 r_g in any model. the data do not allowindependent spin constraints but the results are consistent with the literature(i.e., a&gt;0). our best-fit models indicate an inclination angle in the range40-60 degrees, consistent with limits on the orbital inclination but higherthan reported in the literature using standard reflection models. the iron linearound 6.4 kev is clearly broadened, and we detect a superimposed narrow coreas well. this core originates from a fluorescence region outside the influenceof the strong gravity of the black hole and we discuss possible geometries.

1506.05120	nustar reveals extreme absorption in z &lt; 0.5 type 2 quasars	the intrinsic column density (nh) distribution of quasars is poorly known. atthe high obscuration end of the quasar population and for redshifts z&lt;1, thex-ray spectra can only be reliably characterized using broad-band measurementswhich extend to energies above 10 kev. using the hard x-ray observatory nustar,along with archival chandra and xmm-newton data, we study the broad-band x-rayspectra of nine optically selected (from the sdss), candidate compton-thick (nh&gt; 1.5e24 cm^-2) type 2 quasars (ctqso2s); five new nustar observations arereported herein, and four have been previously published. the candidate ctqso2slie at z&lt;0.5, have observed [oiii] luminosities in the range 8.4 &lt; log(l_[oiii]/l_solar) &lt; 9.6, and show evidence for extreme, compton-thickabsorption when indirect absorption diagnostics are considered. amongst thenine candidate ctqso2s, five are detected by nustar in the high energy (8-24kev) band: two are weakly detected at the ~ 3 sigma confidence level and threeare strongly detected with sufficient counts for spectral modeling (&gt;~ 90 netsource counts at 8-24 kev). for these nustar-detected sources direct (i.e.,x-ray spectral) constraints on the intrinsic agn properties are feasible, andwe measure column densities ~2.5-1600 times higher and intrinsic (unabsorbed)x-ray luminosities ~10-70 times higher than pre-nustar constraints from chandraand xmm-newton. assuming the nustar-detected type 2 quasars are representativeof other compton-thick candidates, we make a correction to the nh distributionfor optically selected type 2 quasars as measured by chandra and xmm-newton for39 objects. with this approach, we predict a compton-thick fraction of f_ct =36^{+14}_{-12} %, although higher fractions (up to 76%) are possible ifindirect absorption diagnostics are assumed to be reliable.

1509.01248	a soft x-ray spectral episode for the clocked burster, gs 1826-24 as  measured by swift and nustar	we report on nustar and swift observations of a soft state of the neutronstar low-mass x-ray binary gs 1826-24, commonly known as the "clocked" burster.the transition to the soft state was recorded in 2014 june through an increaseof the 2-20 kev source intensity measured by maxi, simultaneous with a decreaseof the 15-50 kev intensity measured by swift/bat. the episode lastedapproximately two months, after which the source returned to its usual hardstate. we analyze the broad-band spectrum measured by swift/xrt and nustar, andestimate the accretion rate during the soft episode to be about 13% ofeddington, within the range of previous observations. however, the best fitspectral model, adopting the double comptonization used previously, exhibitssignificantly softer components. we detect seven type-i x-ray bursts, allsignificantly weaker (and with shorter rise and decay times) than observedpreviously. the burst profiles and recurrence times vary significantly, rulingout the regular bursts that are typical for this source. one burst exhibitedphotospheric radius expansion, and we estimate the source distance at about(5.7 / xi_b^1/2) kpc, where xi_b parameterizes the possible anisotropy of theburst emission. interpreting the soft state as a transition from an opticallythin inner flow to an optically thick flow passing through a boundary layer, asis commonly observed in similar systems, is contradicted by the lower opticaldepth measured for the double comptonization model we find for this soft state.the effect of a change in disk geometry on the burst behavior remains unclear.

1509.03322	nustar observations of the compton-thick active galactic nucleus and  ultraluminous x-ray source candidate in ngc 5643	we present two nustar observations of the local seyfert 2 active galacticnucleus (agn) and an ultraluminous x-ray source (ulx) candidate in ngc 5643.together with archival data from chandra, xmm-newton and swift-bat, we performa high-quality broadband spectral analysis of the agn over two decades inenergy ($\sim$0.5-100 kev). previous x-ray observations suggested that the agnis obscured by a compton-thick (ct) column of obscuring gas along ourline-of-sight. however, the lack of high-quality $\gtrsim$ 10 kev observations,together with the presence of a nearby x-ray luminous source, ngc 5643 x-1, hadleft significant uncertainties in the characterization of the nuclear spectrum.nustar now enables the agn and ngc 5643 x-1 to be separately resolved above 10kev for the first time and allows a direct measurement of the absorbing columndensity toward the nucleus. the new data show that the nucleus is indeedobscured by a ct column of $n_{\rm{h}}$ $\gtrsim$ 5 $\times$ 10$^{24}$cm$^{-2}$. the range of 2-10 kev absorption-corrected luminosity inferred fromthe best fitting models is $l_{2-10,\rm{int}} =$ (0.8-1.7) $\times$ 10$^{42}$erg s$^{-1}$, consistent with that predicted from multiwavelength intrinsicluminosity indicators. we also study the nustar data for ngc 5643 x-1, and showthat it exhibits evidence for a spectral cut-off at energy, $e$ $\sim$ 10 kev,similar to that seen in other ulxs observed by nustar. along with the evidencefor significant x-ray luminosity variations in the 3-8 kev band from 2003-2014,our results further strengthen the ulx classification of ngc 5643 x-1.

1512.02235	multiwavelength study of quiescent states of mrk 421 with unprecedented  hard x-ray coverage provided by nustar in 2013	we present coordinated multiwavelength observations of the bright, nearby bllac object mrk 421 taken in 2013 january-march, involving gasp-webt, swift,nustar, fermi-lat, magic, veritas, and other collaborations and instruments,providing data from radio to very-high-energy (vhe) gamma-ray bands. nustaryielded previously unattainable sensitivity in the 3-79 kev range, revealingthat the spectrum softens when the source is dimmer until the x-ray spectralshape saturates into a steep power law with a photon index of approximately 3,with no evidence for an exponential cutoff or additional hard components up toabout 80 kev. for the first time, we observed both the synchrotron and theinverse-compton peaks of the spectral energy distribution (sed) simultaneouslyshifted to frequencies below the typical quiescent state by an order ofmagnitude. the fractional variability as a function of photon energy shows adouble-bump structure which relates to the two bumps of the broadband sed. ineach bump, the variability increases with energy which, in the framework of thesynchrotron self-compton model, implies that the electrons with higher energiesare more variable. the measured multi-band variability, the significantx-ray-to-vhe correlation down to some of the lowest fluxes ever observed inboth bands, the lack of correlation between optical/uv and x-ray flux, the lowdegree of polarization and its significant (random) variations, the shortestimated electron cooling time, and the significantly longer variabilitytimescale observed in the nustar light curves point toward in-situ electronacceleration, and suggest that there are multiple compact regions contributingto the broadband emission of mrk 421 during low-activity states.
