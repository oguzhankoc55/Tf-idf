0901.3240	exoplanet research with safari: a far-ir imaging spectrometer for spica	the far-ir spectral window plays host to a wide range of both spectroscopicand photometric diagnostics with which to open the protoplanetary disks andexoplanet research to wavelengths completely blocked by the earth's atmosphere.these include some of the key atomic (e.g., oxygen) and molecular (e.g., water)cooling lines, the dust thermal emission, the water ice features as well asmany other key chemical tracers. most of these features can not be observedfrom ground-based telescopes but play a critical diagnostic in a number of keyareas including the early stages of planet formation and potentiallyexoplanets. the proposed japanese-led ir space telescope spica, with its 3.5mcooled mirror will be the next step in sensitivity after herschel. spica hasbeen recently selected to go to the next stage of the esa's cosmic vision2015-2025 process. this contribution summarizes the design concept behindsafari: an imaging far-ir spectrometer covering the ~30-210um waveband that isone of a suite of instruments for spica; it also highlights some of the sciencequestions that it will be possible to address in the field of exoplanets andplanet formation.

0902.2748	the ionization fraction gradient across the horsehead edge: an archetype  for molecular clouds	the ionization fraction plays a key role in the chemistry and dynamics ofmolecular clouds. we study the h13co+, dco+ and hoc+ line emission towards thehorsehead, from the shielded core to the uv irradiated cloud edge, i.e., thephotodissociation region (pdr), as a template to investigate the ionizationfraction gradient in molecular clouds. we analyze a pdbi map of the h13co+j=1-0 line, complemented with iram-30m h13co+ and dco+ higher-j line maps andnew hoc+ and co+ observations. we compare self-consistently the observedspatial distribution and line intensities with detailed depth-dependentpredictions of a pdr model coupled with a nonlocal radiative transfercalculation. the chemical network includes deuterated species, 13cfractionation reactions and hco+/hoc+ isomerization reactions. the role ofneutral and charged pahs in the cloud chemistry and ionization balance isinvestigated. the detection of hoc+ reactive ion towards the horsehead pdrproves the high ionization fraction of the outer uv irradiated regions, wherewe derive a low [hco+]/[hoc+]~75-200 abundance ratio. in the absence of pahs,we reproduce the observations with gas-phase metal abundances, [fe+mg+...],lower than 4x10(-9) (with respect to h) and a cosmic-rays ionization rate ofzeta=(5+/-3)x10(-17) s(-1). the inclusion of pahs modifies the ionizationfraction gradient and increases the required metal abundance. the ionizationfraction in the horsehead edge follows a steep gradient, with a scale length of~0.05 pc (or ~25''), from [e-]~10(-4) (or n_e ~ 1-5 cm(-3)) in the pdr to a fewtimes ~10(-9) in the core. pah^- anions play a role in the charge balance ofthe cold and neutral gas if substantial amounts of free pahs are present ([pah]&gt;10(-8)).

0910.3935	mid-infrared pah and h2 emission as a probe of physical conditions in  extreme pdrs	mid-infrared (ir) observations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) andmolecular hydrogen emission are a potentially powerful tool to derive physicalproperties of dense environments irradiated by intense uv fields. we presentnew, spatially resolved, \emph{spitzer} mid-ir spectroscopy of the highuv-field and dense photodissocation region (pdr) around monoceros r2, theclosest ultracompact \hii region, revealing the spatial structure of ionizedgas, pahs and h$_2$ emissions. using a pdr model and pah emission featurefitting algorithm, we build a comprehensive picture of the physical conditionsprevailing in the region. we show that the combination of the measurement ofpah ionization fraction and of the ratio between the h$_2$ 0-0 s(3) and s(2)line intensities, respectively at 9.7 and 12.3 $\mu$m, allows to derive thefundamental parameters driving the pdr: temperature, density and uv radiationfield when they fall in the ranges $t = 250-1500 $k, $n_h=10^4-10^6$cm$^{-3}$,$g_0=10^3-10^5$ respectively. these mid-ir spectral tracers thus provide a toolto probe the similar but unresolved uv-illuminated surface of protoplanetarydisks or the nuclei of starburst galaxies.

0910.4069	polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with spica	thanks to high sensitivity and angular resolution and broad spectralcoverage, spica will offer a unique opportunity to better characterize thenature of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) and very small grains (vsgs),to better use them as probes of astrophysical environments. the angularresolution will enable to probe the chemical frontiers in the evolution processfrom vsgs to neutral pahs, to ionized pahs and to "grand-pahs" inphotodissotiation regions and hii regions, as a function of g$_0$/n (uvradiation field / density). high sensitivity will favor the detection of thefar-ir skeletal emission bands of pahs, which provide specific fingerprints andcould lead to the identification of individual pahs. this overallcharacterization will allow to use pah and vsg populations as tracers ofphysical conditions in spatially resolved protoplanetary disks and nearbygalaxies (using mid-ir instruments), and in high redshift galaxies (using thefar-ir instrument), thanks to the broad spectral coverage spica provides. basedon our previous experience with iso and spitzer we discuss how these goals canbe reached.

1003.1375	the chemistry of vibrationally excited h2 in the interstellar medium	the internal energy available in vibrationally excited h2 molecules can beused to overcome or diminish the activation barrier of various chemicalreactions of interest for molecular astrophysics. in this article weinvestigate in detail the impact on the chemical composition of interstellarclouds of the reactions of vibrationally excited h2 with c+, he+, o, oh, andcn, based on the available chemical kinetics data. it is found that thereaction of h2 (v&gt;0) and c+ has a profound impact on the abundances of somemolecules, especially ch+, which is a direct product and is readily formed inastronomical regions with fractional abundances of vibrationally excited h2,relative to ground state h2, in excess of 10^(-6), independently of whether thegas is hot or not. the effects of these reactions on the chemical compositionof the diffuse clouds zeta oph and hd 34078, the dense pdr orion bar, theplanetary nebula ngc 7027, and the circumstellar disk around the b9 star hd176386 are investigated through pdr models. we find that formation of ch+ isespecially favored in dense and highly fuv illuminated regions such as theorion bar and the planetary nebula ngc 7027, where column densities in excessof 10^(13) cm^(-2) are predicted. in diffuse clouds, however, this mechanism isfound to be not efficient enough to form ch+ with a column density close to thevalues derived from astronomical observations.

1005.2031	origin of the hot gas in low-mass protostars: herschel-pacs spectroscopy  of hh 46	'water in star-forming regions with herschel' (wish) is a herschel keyprogramme aimed at understanding the physical and chemical structure of youngstellar objects (ysos) with a focus on water and related species. the low-massprotostar hh 46 was observed with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs) on the herschel space observatory to measure emission inh2o, co, oh, [oi], and [cii] lines located between 63 and 186 um. theexcitation and spatial distribution of emission can disentangle the differentheating mechanisms of ysos, with better spatial resolution and sensitivity thanpreviously possible. far-ir line emission is detected at the position of theprotostar and along the outflow axis. the oh emission is concentrated at thecentral position, co emission is bright at the central position and along theoutflow, and h2o emission is concentrated in the outflow. in addition, [oi]emission is seen in low-velocity gas, assumed to be related to the envelope,and is also seen shifted up to 170 km/s in both the red- and blue-shifted jets.envelope models are constructed based on previous observational constraints.they indicate that passive heating of a spherical envelope by the protostellarluminosity cannot explain the high-excitation molecular gas detected with pacs,including co lines with upper levels at &gt;2500 k above the ground state.instead, warm co and h2o emission is probably produced in the walls of anoutflow-carved cavity in the envelope, which are heated by uv photons andnon-dissociative c-type shocks. the bright oh and [oi] emission is attributedto j-type shocks in dense gas close to the protostar. in the scenario describedhere, the combined cooling by far-ir lines within the central spatial pixel isestimated to be 2 \times 10-2 l_sun, with 60-80% attributed to j- and c-typeshocks produced by interactions between the jet and the envelope.

1005.2517	hifi observations of warm gas in dr21: shock versus radiative heating	the molecular gas in the dr21 massive star formation region is known to beaffected by the strong uv field from the central star cluster and by a fastoutflow creating a bright shock. the relative contribution of both heatingmechanisms is the matter of a long debate. by better sampling the excitationladder of various tracers we provide a quantitative distinction between thedifferent heating mechanisms. hifi observations of mid-j transitions of co andhco+ isotopes allow us to bridge the gap in excitation energies betweenobservations from the ground, characterizing the cooler gas, and existing isolws spectra, constraining the properties of the hot gas. comparing the detailedline profiles allows to identify the physical structure of the differentcomponents. in spite of the known shock-excitation of h2 and the clearlyvisible strong outflow, we find that the emission of all lines up to &gt; 2 thzcan be explained by purely radiative heating of the material. however, the newherschel/hifi observations reveal two types of excitation conditions. we findhot and dense clumps close to the central cluster, probably dynamicallyaffected by the outflow, and a more widespread distribution of cooler, butnevertheless dense, molecular clumps.

1005.2521	detection of interstellar oxidaniumyl: abundant h2o+ towards the  star-forming regions dr21, sgr b2, and ngc6334	we identify a prominent absorption feature at 1115 ghz, detected in firsthifi spectra towards high-mass star-forming regions, and interpret itsastrophysical origin. the characteristic hyperfine pattern of the h2o+ground-state rotational transition, and the lack of other known low-energytransitions in this frequency range, identifies the feature as h2o+ absorptionagainst the dust continuum background and allows us to derive the velocityprofile of the absorbing gas. by comparing this velocity profile with velocityprofiles of other tracers in the dr21 star-forming region, we constrain thefrequency of the transition and the conditions for its formation. in dr21, thevelocity distribution of h2o+ matches that of the [cii] line at 158\mu\m and ofoh cm-wave absorption, both stemming from the hot and dense clump surfacesfacing the hii-region and dynamically affected by the blister outflow. diffuseforeground gas dominates the absorption towards sgr b2. the integratedintensity of the absorption line allows us to derive lower limits to the h2o+column density of 7.2e12 cm^-2 in ngc 6334, 2.3e13 cm^-2 in dr21, and 1.1e15cm^-2 in sgr b2.

1005.4517	water cooling of shocks in protostellar outflows: herschel-pacs map of  l1157	in the framework of the water in star-forming regions with herschel (wish)key program, maps in water lines of several outflows from young stars are beingobtained, to study the water production in shocks and its role in the outflowcooling. this paper reports the first results of this program, presenting apacs map of the o-h2o 179 um transition obtained toward the young outflowl1157. the 179 um map is compared with those of other important shock tracers,and with previous single-pointing iso, swas, and odin water observations of thesame source that allow us to constrain the water abundance and total cooling.strong h2o peaks are localized on both shocked emission knots and the centralsource position. the h2o 179 um emission is spatially correlated with emissionfrom h2 rotational lines, excited in shocks leading to a significantenhancement of the water abundance. water emission peaks along the outflow alsocorrelate with peaks of other shock-produced molecular species, such as sio andnh3. a strong h2o peak is also observed at the location of the proto-star,where none of the other molecules have significant emission. the absolute 179um intensity and its intensity ratio to the h2o 557 ghz line previouslyobserved with odin/swas indicate that the water emission originates in warmcompact clumps, spatially unresolved by pacs, having a h2o abundance of theorder of 10^-4. this testifies that the clumps have been heated for a time longenough to allow the conversion of almost all the available gas-phase oxygeninto water. the total water cooling is ~10^-1 lo, about 40% of the cooling dueto h2 and 23% of the total energy released in shocks along the l1157 outflow.

1007.2172	herschel observations of extra-ordinary sources: the present and future  of spectral surveys with herschel/hifi	we present initial results from the herschel gt key program: herschelobservations of extra-ordinary sources (hexos) and outline the promise andpotential of spectral surveys with herschel/hifi. the hifi instrument offersunprecedented sensitivity, as well as continuous spectral coverage across thegaps imposed by the atmosphere, opening up a largely unexplored wavelengthregime to high-resolution spectroscopy. we show the spectrum of orion klbetween 480 and 560 ghz and from 1.06 to 1.115 thz. from these data, we confirmthat hifi separately measures the dust continuum and spectrally resolvesemission lines in orion kl. based on this capability we demonstrate that theline contribution to the broad-band continuum in this molecule-rich source is~20-40% below 1 thz and declines to a few percent at higher frequencies. wealso tentatively identify multiple transitions of hd18o in the spectra. thefirst detection of this rare isotopologue in the interstellar medium suggeststhat hdo emission is optically thick in the orion hot core with hdo/h2o ~ 0.02.we discuss the implications of this detection for the water d/h ratio in hotcores.

1007.3031	water in low-mass star-forming regions with herschel: hifi spectroscopy  of ngc1333	'water in star-forming regions with herschel' (wish) is a key programmededicated to studying the role of water and related species during thestar-formation process and constraining the physical and chemical properties ofyoung stellar objects. the heterodyne instrument for the far-infrared (hifi) onthe herschel space observatory observed three deeply embedded protostars in thelow-mass star-forming region ngc1333 in several h2-16o, h2-18o, and cotransitions. line profiles are resolved for five h16o transitions in eachsource, revealing them to be surprisingly complex. the line profiles aredecomposed into broad (&gt;20 km/s), medium-broad (~5-10 km/s), and narrow (&lt;5km/s) components. the h2-18o emission is only detected in broad 1_10-1_01 lines(&gt;20 km/s), indicating that its physical origin is the same as for the broadh2-16o component. in one of the sources, iras4a, an inverse p cygni profile isobserved, a clear sign of infall in the envelope. from the line profiles alone,it is clear that the bulk of emission arises from shocks, both on small (&lt;1000au) and large scales along the outflow cavity walls (~10 000 au). the h2o lineprofiles are compared to co line profiles to constrain the h2o abundance as afunction of velocity within these shocked regions. the h2o/co abundance ratiosare measured to be in the range of ~0.1-1, corresponding to h2o abundances of~10-5-10-4 with respect to h2. approximately 5-10% of the gas is hot enough forall oxygen to be driven into water in warm post-shock gas, mostly at highvelocities.

1007.3408	herschel-hifi detections of hydrides towards afgl 2591 (envelope  emission versus tenuous cloud absorption)	the heterodyne instrument for the far infrared (hifi) onboard the herschelspace observatory allows the first observations of light diatomic molecules athigh spectral resolution and in multiple transitions. here, we report deepintegrations using hifi in different lines of hydrides towards the high-massstar forming region afgl 2591. detected are ch, ch+, nh, oh+, h2o+, while nh+and sh+ have not been detected. all molecules except for ch and ch+ are seen inabsorption with low excitation temperatures and at velocities different fromthe systemic velocity of the protostellar envelope. surprisingly, the ch(jf,p =3/2_2,- - 1/2_1,+) and ch+(j = 1 - 0, j = 2 - 1) lines are detected in emissionat the systemic velocity. we can assign the absorption features to a foregroundcloud and an outflow lobe, while the ch and ch+ emission stems from theenvelope. the observed abundance and excitation of ch and ch+ can be explainedin the scenario of fuv irradiated outflow walls, where a cavity etched out bythe outflow allows protostellar fuv photons to irradiate and heat the envelopeat larger distances driving the chemical reactions that produce thesemolecules.

1007.3986	water in massive star-forming regions: hifi observations of w3 irs5	we present herschel observations of the water molecule in the massivestar-forming region w3 irs5. the o-h17o 110-101, p-h18o 111-000, p-h2o 22202-111, p-h2o 111-000, o-h2o 221-212, and o-h2o 212-101 lines, covering afrequency range from 552 up to 1669 ghz, have been detected at high spectralresolution with hifi. the water lines in w3 irs5 show well-definedhigh-velocity wings that indicate a clear contribution by outflows. moreover,the systematically blue-shifted absorption in the h2o lines suggests expansion,presumably driven by the outflow. no infall signatures are detected. the p-h2o111-000 and o-h2o 212-101 lines show absorption from the cold material (t ~ 10k) in which the high-mass protostellar envelope is embedded. one-dimensionalradiative transfer models are used to estimate water abundances and to furtherstudy the kinematics of the region. we show that the emission in the rareisotopologues comes directly from the inner parts of the envelope (t &gt; 100 k)where water ices in the dust mantles evaporate and the gas-phase abundanceincreases. the resulting jump in the water abundance (with a constant innerabundance of 10^{-4}) is needed to reproduce the o-h17o 110-101 and p-h18o111-000 spectra in our models. we estimate water abundances of 10^{-8} to10^{-9} in the outer parts of the envelope (t &lt; 100 k). the possibility of twoprotostellar objects contributing to the emission is discussed.

1007.4957	the origin of the [c ii] emission in the s140 pdrs - new insights from  hifi	using herschel's hifi instrument we have observed [c ii] along a cut throughs140 and high-j transitions of co and hco+ at two positions on the cut,corresponding to the externally irradiated ionization front and the embeddedmassive star forming core irs1. the hifi data were combined with availableground-based observations and modeled using the kosma-tau model for photondominated regions. here we derive the physical conditions in s140 and inparticular the origin of [c ii] emission around irs1. we identify threedistinct regions of [c ii] emission from the cut, one close to the embeddedsource irs1, one associated with the ionization front and one further into thecloud. the line emission can be understood in terms of a clumpy model ofphoton-dominated regions. at the position of irs1, we identify at least twodistinct components contributing to the [c ii] emission, one of them a small,hot component, which can possibly be identified with the irradiated outflowwalls. this is consistent with the fact that the [c ii] peak at irs1 coincideswith shocked h2 emission at the edges of the outflow cavity. we note thatpreviously available observations of irs1 can be well reproduced by asingle-component kosma-tau model. thus it is hifi's unprecedented spatial andspectral resolution, as well as its sensitivity which has allowed us to uncoveran additional hot gas component in the s140 region.

1007.5131	reversal of infall in sgrb2(m) revealed by herschel/hifi observations of  hcn lines at thz frequencies	to investigate the accretion and feedback processes in massive starformation, we analyze the shapes of emission lines from hot molecular cores,whose asymmetries trace infall and expansion motions. the high-mass starforming region sgrb2(m) was observed with herschel/hifi (hexos key project) invarious lines of hcn and its isotopologues, complemented by apex data. theobservations are compared to spherically symmetric, centrally heated modelswith density power-law gradient and different velocity fields (infall orinfall+expansion), using the radiative transfer code ratran. the hcn lineprofiles are asymmetric, with the emission peak shifting from blue to red withincreasing j and decreasing line opacity (hcn to h$^{13}$cn). this is mostevident in the hcn 12--11 line at 1062 ghz. these line shapes are reproduced bya model whose velocity field changes from infall in the outer part to expansionin the inner part. the qualitative reproduction of the hcn lines suggests thatinfall dominates in the colder, outer regions, but expansion dominates in thewarmer, inner regions. we are thus witnessing the onset of feedback in massivestar formation, starting to reverse the infall and finally disrupting the wholemolecular cloud. to obtain our result, the thz lines uniquely covered by hifiwere critically important.

1007.5470	herschel observations of extra-ordinary sources (hexos): observations of  h2o and its isotopologues towards orion kl	we report the detection of more than 48 velocity-resolved ground rotationalstate transitions of h2(16)o, h2(18)o, and h2(17)o - most for the first time -in both emission and absorption toward orion kl using herschel/hifi. we showthat a simple fit, constrained to match the known emission and absorptioncomponents along the line of sight, is in excellent agreement with the spectralprofiles of all the water lines. using the measured h2(18)o line fluxes, whichare less affected by line opacity than their h2(16)o counterparts, and anescape probability method, the column densities of h2(18)o associated with eachemission component are derived. we infer total water abundances of 7.4e-5,1.0e-5, and 1.6e-5 for the plateau, hot core, and extended warm gas,respectively. in the case of the plateau, this value is consistent withprevious measures of the orion-kl water abundance as well as those of othermolecular outflows. in the case of the hot core and extended warm gas, thesevalues are somewhat higher than water abundances derived for other quiescentclouds, suggesting that these regions are likely experiencing enhancedwater-ice sublimation from (and reduced freeze-out onto) grain surfaces due tothe warmer dust in these sources.

1008.1199	a high resolution line survey of irc+10216 with herschel. first results:  detection of warm silicon dicarbide sic2	we present the first results of a high-spectral-resolution survey of thecarbon-rich evolved star irc+10216 that was carried out with the hifispectrometer onboard herschel. this survey covers all hifi bands, with aspectral range from 488 to 1901ghz. in this letter we focus on the band-1bspectrum, in a spectral range 554.5-636.5ghz, where we identified 130 spectralfeatures with intensities above 0.03 k and a signal-to-noise ratio &gt;5. detectedlines arise from hcn, sio, sis, cs, co, metal-bearing species and,surprisingly, silicon dicarbide (sic2). we identified 55 sic2 transitionsinvolving energy levels between 300 and 900 k. by analysing these rotationallines, we conclude that sic2 is produced in the inner dust formation zone, withan abundance of ~2x10^-7 relative to molecular hydrogen. these sic2 lines havebeen observed for the first time in space and have been used to derive an sic2rotational temperature of ~204 k and a source-averaged column density of~6.4x10^15 cm^-2. furthermore, the high quality of the hifi data set was usedto improve the spectroscopic rotational constants of sic2.

1105.5026	first hyperfine resolved far-infrared oh spectrum from a star-forming  region	oh is an important molecule in the h2o chemistry and the cooling budget ofstar-forming regions. the goal of the herschel key program `water instar-forming regions with herschel' (wish) is to study h2o and related speciesduring protostellar evolution. our aim in this letter is to assess the originof the oh emission from star-forming regions and constrain the properties ofthe emitting gas. high-resolution observations of the oh 2pi1/2 j = 3/2-1/2triplet at 1837.8 ghz (163.1 micron) towards the high-mass star-forming regionw3 irs 5 with the heterodyne instrument for the far-infrared (hifi) on herschelreveal the first hyperfine velocity-resolved oh far-infrared spectrum of astar-forming region. the line profile of the oh emission shows two components:a narrow component (fwhm approx. 4-5 km/s) with partially resolved hyperfinestructure resides on top of a broad (fwhm approx. 30 km/s) component. thenarrow emission agrees well with results from radiative transfer calculationsof a spherical envelope model for w3 irs 5 with a constant oh abundance ofapprox. 8e-9. comparison with h2o yields oh/h2o abundance ratios of around 1e-3for t &gt; 100 k and around unity for t &lt; 100k, consistent with the currentpicture of the dense cloud chemistry with freeze-out and photodesorption. thebroad component is attributed to outflow emission. an abundance ratio of oh/h2o&gt; 0.028 in the outflow is derived from comparison with results of water linemodeling. this ratio can be explained by a fast j-type shock or a sloweruv-irradiated c-type shock.

1206.1249	herschel / hifi observations of co, h2o and nh3 in mon r2	context. mon r2 is the only ultracompact hii region (uchii) where theassociated photon-dominated region (pdr) can be resolved with herschel. due toits brightness and proximity, it is the best source to investigate thechemistry and physics of highly uv-irradiated pdrs. aims. our goal is toestimate the abundance of h2o and nh3 in this region and investigate theirorigin. methods. we present new observations obtained with hifi and theiram-30m telescope. using a large velocity gradient approach, we model the lineintensities and derive an average abundance of h2o and nh3 across the region.finally, we model the line profiles with a non-local radiative transfer modeland compare these results with the abundance predicted by the meudon pdr code.results. the variations of the line profiles and intensities indicate complexgeometrical and kinematical patterns. the h2o lines present a strong absorptionat the ambient velocity and emission in high velocity wings towards the hiiregion. the spatial distribution of the o-h2^18o line shows that the itsemission arises in the pdr surrounding the hii region. by modeling the o-h2^18oemission we derive a mean abundance of o-h2o of ~10^-8 relative to h2. theortho-h2o abundance is however larger, ~1x10^-7, in the high velocity wings.possible explanations for this larger abundance include an expanding hot pdrand/or an outflow. ammonia seems to be present only in the envelope with anaverage abundance of ~2x10^-9 relative to h2. conclusions. the meudon pdr codecan account for the measured water abundance in the high velocity gas as longas we assume that it originates from a &lt;1 mag hot expanding layer of the pdr,i.e. that the outflow has only a minor contribution to this emission. toexplain the abundances in the rest of the cloud the molecular freeze out andgrain surface chemistry would need to be included.

1208.1816	the chemistry of c3 &amp; carbon chain molecules in dr21(oh)	(abridged) we have observed velocity resolved spectra of four ro-vibrationalfar-infrared transitions of c3 between the vibrational ground state and thelow-energy nu2 bending mode at frequencies between 1654--1897 ghz using hifi onboard herschel, in dr21(oh), a high mass star forming region. severaltransitions of cch and c-c3h2 have also been observed with hifi and the iram30m telescope. a gas and grain warm-up model was used to identify the primaryc3 forming reactions in dr21(oh). we have detected c3 in absorption in fourfar-infrared transitions, p(4), p(10), q(2) and q(4). the continuum sources mm1and mm2 in dr21(oh) though spatially unresolved, are sufficiently separated invelocity to be identified in the c3 spectra. all c3 transitions are detectedfrom the embedded source mm2 and the surrounding envelope, whereas only q(4) &amp;p(4) are detected toward the hot core mm1. the abundance of c3 in the envelopeand mm2 is \sim6x10^{-10} and \sim3x10^{-9} respectively. for cch and c-c3h2 weonly detect emission from the envelope and mm1. the observed cch, c3, andc-c3h2 abundances are most consistent with a chemical model withn(h2)\sim5x10^{6} cm^-3 post-warm-up dust temperature, t_max =30 k and a timeof \sim0.7-3 myr. post warm-up gas phase chemistry of ch4 released from thegrain at t\sim 0.2 myr and lasting for 1 myr can explain the observed c3abundance in the envelope of dr21(oh) and no mechanism involvingphotodestruction of pah molecules is required. the chemistry in the envelope issimilar to the warm carbon chain chemistry (wccc) found in lukewarm corinos.the observed lower c3 abundance in mm1 as compared to mm2 and the envelopecould be indicative of destruction of c3 in the more evolved mm1. the timescalefor the chemistry derived for the envelope is consistent with the dynamicaltimescale of 2 myr derived for dr21(oh) in other studies.

1209.1552	on the influence of collisional rate coefficients on the water vapour  excitation	water is a key molecule in many astrophysical studies. its high dipole momentmakes this molecule to be subthermally populated under the typical conditionsof most astrophysical objects. this motivated the calculation of various setsof collisional rate coefficients (crc) for h$_2$o (with he or h$_2$) which arenecessary to model its rotational excitation and line emission. we performedaccurate non--local non--lte radiative transfer calculations using differentsets of crc in order to predict the line intensities from transitions thatinvolve the lowest energy levels of h$_2$o (e $&lt;$ 900 k). the results obtainedfrom the different crc sets are then compared using line intensity ratiostatistics. for the whole range of physical conditions considered in this work,we obtain that the intensities based on the quantum and qct crc are in goodagreement. however, at relatively low h$_2$ volume density ($n$(h$_2$) $&lt;$10$^7$ cm$^{-3}$) and low water abundance ($\chi$(h$_2$o) $&lt;$ 10$^{-6}$), thesephysical conditions being relevant to describe most molecular clouds, we finddifferences in the predicted line intensities of up to a factor of $\sim$ 3 forthe bulk of the lines. most of the recent studies interpreting early herschelspace observatory spectra used the qct crc. our results show that although theglobal conclusions from those studies will not be drastically changed, eachcase has to be considered individually, since depending on the physicalconditions, the use of the qct crc may lead to a mis--estimate of the watervapour abundance of up to a factor of $\sim$ 3.

1212.5033	oh far-infrared emission from low- and intermediate-mass protostars  surveyed with herschel-pacs	oh is a key species in the water chemistry of star-forming regions, becauseits presence is tightly related to the formation and destruction of water. thispaper presents oh observations from 23 low- and intermediate-mass young stellarobjects obtained with the pacs integral field spectrometer on-board herschel inthe context of the water in star-forming regions with herschel (wish) keyprogram. most low-mass sources have compact oh emission (&lt; 5000 au scale),whereas the oh lines in most intermediate-mass sources are extended over thewhole pacs detector field-of-view (&gt; 20000 au). the strength of the oh emissionis correlated with various source properties such as the bolometric luminosityand the envelope mass, but also with the oi and h2o emission. rotationaldiagrams for sources with many oh lines show that the level populations of ohcan be approximated by a boltzmann distribution with an excitation temperatureat around 70 k. radiative transfer models of spherically symmetric envelopescannot reproduce the oh emission fluxes nor their broad line widths, stronglysuggesting an outflow origin. slab excitation models indicate that the observedexcitation temperature can either be reached if the oh molecules are exposed toa strong far-infrared continuum radiation field or if the gas temperature anddensity are sufficiently high. using realistic source parameters and radiationfields, it is shown for the case of ser smm1 that radiative pumping plays animportant role in transitions arising from upper level energies higher than 300k. the compact emission in the low-mass sources and the required presence of astrong radiation field and/or a high density to excite the oh molecules pointstowards an origin in shocks in the inner envelope close to the protostar.

1406.1373	deuteration around the ultracompact hii region mon r2	the massive star-forming region mon r2 hosts the closest ultra-compact hiiregion that can be spatially resolved with current single-dish telescopes. weused the iram-30m telescope to carry out an unbiased spectral survey toward twoimportant positions (namely if and mp2), in order to studying the chemistry ofdeuterated molecules toward mon r2. we found a rich chemistry of deuteratedspecies at both positions, with detections of c2d, dcn, dnc, dco+, d2co, hdco,nh2d, and n2d+ and their corresponding hydrogenated species and isotopologs.our high spectral resolution observations allowed us to resolve three velocitycomponents: the component at 10 km/s is detected at both positions and seemsassociated with the layer most exposed to the uv radiation from irs 1; thecomponent at 12 km/s is found toward the if position and seems related to themolecular gas; finally, a component at 8.5 km/s is only detected toward the mp2position, most likely related to a low-uv irradiated pdr. we derived the columndensity of all the species, and determined the deuterium fractions (dfrac). thevalues of dfrac are around 0.01 for all the observed species, except for hco+and n2h+ which have values 10 times lower. the values found in mon r2 are wellexplained with pseudo-time-dependent gas-phase model in which deuterationoccurs mainly via ion-molecule reactions with h2d+, ch2d+ and c2hd+. finally,the [h13cn]/[hn13c] ratio is very high (~11) for the 10 km/s component, whichalso agree with our model predictions for an age of ~0.01-0.1 myr. thedeuterium chemistry is a good tool for studying star-forming regions. thelow-mass star-forming regions seem well characterized with dfrac(n2h+) ordfrac(hco+), but it is required a complete chemical modeling to date massivestar-forming regions, because the higher gas temperature together with therapid evolution of massive protostars.

1406.2278	modelling the sulphur chemistry evolution in orion kl	we study the sulphur chemistry evolution in the orion kl along the gas andgrain phases of the cloud. we investigate the processes that dominate thesulphur chemistry and to determine how physical and chemical parameters, suchas the final star mass and the initial elemental abundances, influence theevolution of the hot core and of the surrounding outflows and shocked gas (theplateau). we independently modelled the chemistry evolution of both componentsusing the time-dependent gas-grain model ucl_chem and considering two differentphase calculations. phase i starts with the collapsing cloud and the depletionof atoms and molecules onto grain surfaces. phase ii starts when a centralprotostar is formed and the evaporation from grains takes place. we show howthe gas density, the gas depletion efficiency, the initial sulphur abundance,the shocked gas temperature and the different chemical paths on the grainsleading to different reservoirs of sulphur on the mantles affectsulphur-bearing molecules at different evolutionary stages. we also compare thepredicted column densities with those inferred from observations of the speciesso, so2, cs, ocs, h2s and h2cs. the models that reproduce the observations ofthe largest number of sulphur-bearing species are those with an initial sulphurabundance of 0.1 times the sulphur solar abundance and a density of at leastn_h=5x10^6 cm^-3 in the shocked gas region. we conclude that most of thesulphur atoms were ionised during phase i, consistent with an inhomogeneous andclumpy region where the uv interstellar radiation penetrates leading to sulphurionisation. we also conclude that the main sulphur reservoir on the ice mantleswas h2s. in addition, we deduce that a chemical transition currently takesplace in the shocked gas, where so and so2 gas-phase formation reactions changefrom being dominated by o2 to being dominated by oh.

1412.0417	the chemistry and spatial distribution of small hydrocarbons in  uv-irradiated molecular clouds: the orion bar pdr	we study the spatial distribution and chemistry of small hydrocarbons in theorion bar pdr. we used the iram-30m telescope to carry out a millimetre linesurvey towards the orion bar edge, complemented with ~2'x2' maps of the c2h andc-c3h2 emission. we analyse the excitation of the detected hydrocarbons andconstrain the physical conditions of the emitting regions with non-lteradiative transfer models. we compare the inferred column densities withupdated gas-phase photochemical models including 13cch and c13ch isotopomerfractionation. ~40% of the lines in the survey arise from hydrocarbons (c2h,c4h, c-c3h2, c-c3h, c13ch, 13cch, l-c3h and l-h2c3). we detect new lines froml-c3h+ and improve its rotational spectroscopic constants. anions or deuteratedhydrocarbons are not detected: [c2d]/[c2h]&lt;0.2%, [c2h-]/[c2h]&lt;0.007% and[c4h-]/[c4h]&lt;0.05%. our gas-phase models can reasonably match the observedcolumn densities of most hydrocarbons (within factors &lt;3). since the observedspatial distribution of the c2h and c-c3h2 emission is similar but does notfollow the pah emission, we conclude that, in high uv-flux pdrs,photodestruction of pahs is not a necessary requirement to explain the observedabundances of the smallest hydrocarbons. instead, gas-phase endothermicreactions (or with barriers) between c+, radicals and h2 enhance the formationof simple hydrocarbons. observations and models suggest that the [c2h]/[c-c3h2]ratio (~32 at the pdr edge) decreases with the uv field attenuation. theobserved low cyclic-to-linear c3h column density ratio (&lt;3) is consistent witha high electron abundance (xe) pdr environment. in fact, the poorly constrainedxe gradient influences much of the hydrocarbon chemistry in the moreuv-shielded gas. we propose that reactions of c2h isotopologues with 13c+ and hatoms can explain the observed [c13ch]/[13cch]=1.4(0.1) fractionation level.

1502.02325	spatially resolved l-c3h+ emission in the horsehead photodissociation  region: further evidence for a top-down hydrocarbon chemistry	small hydrocarbons, such as c2h, c3h and c3h2 are more abundant inphoto-dissociation regions (pdrs) than expected based on gas-phase chemicalmodels. to explore the hydrocarbon chemistry further, we observed a keyintermediate species, the hydrocarbon ion l-c3h+, in the horsehead pdr with theplateau de bure interferometer at high-angular resolution (6''). we comparewith previous observations of c2h and c-c3h2 at similar angular resolution andnew gas-phase chemical model predictions to constrain the dominant formationmechanisms of small hydrocarbons in low-uv flux pdrs. we find that, at the peakof the hco emission (pdr position), the measured l-c3h+, c2h and c-c3h2abundances are consistent with current gas-phase model predictions. however, inthe first pdr layers, at the 7.7 mum pah band emission peak, which are moreexposed to the radiation field and where the density is lower, the c2h andc-c3h2 abundances are underestimated by an order of magnitude. at thisposition, the l-c3h+ abundance is also underpredicted by the model but only bya factor of a few. in addition, contrary to the model predictions, l-c3h+ peaksfurther out in the pdr than the other hydrocarbons, c2h and c-c3h2. this cannotbe explained by an excitation effect. current gas-phase photochemical modelsthus cannot explain the observed abundances of hydrocarbons, in particular inthe first pdr layers. our observations are consistent with a top-downhydrocarbon chemistry, in which large polyatomic molecules or smallcarbonaceous grains are photo-destroyed into smaller hydrocarbonmolecules/precursors.

0809.0242	using spica space telescope to characterize exoplanets	we present the 3.5m spica space telescope, a proposed japanese-led jaxa-esamission scheduled for launch around 2017. the actively cooled (&lt;5 k), singleaperture telescope and monolithic mirror will operate from ~3.5 to ~210 um andwill provide superb sensitivity in the mid- and far-ir spectral domain (betterthan jwst at lambda &gt; 18 um). spica is one of the few space missions selectedto go to the next stage of esa's cosmic vision 2015-2025 selection process. inthis white paper we present the main specifications of the three instrumentscurrently baselined for spica: a mid-infrared (mir) coronagraph (~3.5 to ~27um) with photometric and spectral capabilities (r~200), a mir wide-field cameraand high resolution spectrometer (r~30,000), and a far-infrared (fir ~30 to~210 um) imaging spectrometer - safari - led by a european consortium. wediscuss their capabilities in the context of mir direct observations ofexo-planets (eps) and multiband photometry/high resolution spectroscopyobservations of transiting exo-planets. we conclude that spica will be able tocharacterize the atmospheres of transiting exo-planets down to the super-earthsize previously detected by ground- or space-based observatories. it will alsodirectly detect and characterize jupiter/neptune-size planets orbiting atlarger separation from their parent star (&gt;5-10 au), by performing quantitativeatmospheric spectroscopy and studying proto-planetary and debris disks. inaddition, spica will be a scientific and technological precursor for future,more ambitious, ir space missions for exo-planet direct detection as it will,for example, quantify the prevalence exo-zodiacal clouds in planetary systemsand test coronographic techniques, cryogenic systems and lightweight, highquality telescopes.

astro-ph;0504235	observational evidence of the formation of cyanopolyynes in crl618  through the polimerization of hcn	the abundance ratio of consecutive members of the cyanopolyynes family hasbeen explored in crl618 using data acquired in a complete line survey coveringthe frequency range 81-356 ghz. the jup range explored for the differentmolecules is the following: 1 to 4 for hcn and hnc, 9 to 39 for hc3n, 31 to 133for hc5n, and 72 to 85 for hc7n (not detected beyond jup=85). the lowestvibrationally excited state of hc7n (nu_15 at 62 cm^-1) has been tentativelydetected. data analysis has been performed by extending our previousgeometrical and radiative transfer model of the slowly expanding envelope (see)surrounding the compact central continuum source of crl 618, that wasestablished from the study of rotational lines in several vibrationally excitedstates of hc_3n. the new lines analyzed here require to model the high velocitywind (hvw) component and the colder circumstellar gas, remnant of the agb phaseof crl618. the derived hc3n/hc5n and hc5n/hc7n abundance ratios from this setof uniformly calibrated lines are between 3 and 6 in the different regions,similar to standard values in the csm and ism, and consistent with previousestimates obtained from iso observations and chemical models. however, theabundance ratios of hc3n, hc5n and hc7n with respect to hcn are at least twoorders of magnitude larger than those typical for agb c-rich stars, such asirc+10216. this fact indicates that, in the short transition toward theplanetary nebula phase, hcn is quickly reprocessed into longer cyanopolyynechains. a similar behavior was previously found in this object for thepolyacetylenic chains (c(2n)h2).

astro-ph;0605410	a far-infrared molecular and atomic line survey of the orion kl region	we have carried out a high spectral resolution line survey towards the orionkleinmann-low (kl) cluster from 44-188 um. the observations were taken with thelong wavelength spectrometer (lws) in fabry-perot mode, on board the infraredspace observatory (iso). a total of 152 lines are clearly detected and afurther 34 features are present as possible detections. the spectrum isdominated by the molecular species h2o, oh and co, along with [oi] and [cii]lines from pdr or shocked gas and [oiii], [niii] lines from the foreground m42hii region. several isotopic species, as well as nh3, are also detected. hdoand h3o+ are tentatively detected for the first time in the far-infrared rangetowards orion-kl. a basic analysis of the line observations is carried out, bycomparing with previous measurements and published models and derivingrotational temperatures and column densities in the case of the molecularspecies. the complexity of the region requires more sophisticated models forthe interpretation of all the line observations.

astro-ph;0605716	low sulfur depletion in the horsehead pdr	we present 3.65''x3.34'' angular-resolution iram pdbi observations of the csj=2-1 line toward the horsehead photodissociation region (pdr), complementedwith iram-30m single-dish observations of several rotational lines of cs, c34sand hcs+. we analyse the cs and hcs+ photochemistry, excitation and radiativetransfer to obtain their abundances and the physical conditions prevailing inthe cloud edge. since the cs abundance scales to that of sulfur, we determinethe gas phase sulfur abundance in the pdr, an interesting intermediate mediumbetween translucent clouds (where sulfur remains in the gas phase) and darkclouds (where large depletions have been invoked). a nonlocal non-lte radiativetransfer code including dust and cosmic background illumination adapted to thehorsehead geometry has been developed to carefuly analyse the cs, c34s, hcs+and c18o rotational line emission. we use this model to consistently link theline observations with photochemical models to determine the cs/hcs+/s/s+structure of the pdr. the combination of cs, c34s and hcs+ observationstogether with the inclusion of the most recent cs collisional and chemicalrates in our models implies that sulfur depletion invoked to account for cs andhcs+ abundances is much smaller than in previous studies.

astro-ph;0608336	the water vapor abundance in orion kl outflows	we present the detection and modeling of more than 70 far-ir pure rotationallines of water vapor, including the 18o and 17o isotopologues, towards orionkl. observations were performed with the long wavelength spectrometerfabry-perot (lws/fp; r~6800-9700) on board the infrared space observatory (iso)between ~43 and ~197 um. the water line profiles evolve from p-cygni typeprofiles (even for the h2o18 lines) to pure emission at wavelengths above ~100um. we find that most of the water emission/absorption arises from an extendedflow of gas expanding at 25+-5 kms^-1. non-local radiative transfer models showthat much of the water excitation and line profile formation is driven by thedust continuum emission. the derived beam averaged water abundance is2-3x10^-5. the inferred gas temperature tk=80-100 k suggests that: (i) watercould have been formed in the "plateau" by gas phase neutral-neutral reactionswith activation barriers if the gas was previously heated (e.g. by shocks) to&gt;500 k and/or (ii) h2o formation in the outflow is dominated by in-situevaporation of grain water-ice mantles and/or (iii) h2o was formed in theinnermost and warmer regions (e.g. the hot core) and was swept up in ~1000 yr,the dynamical timescale of the outflow.

astro-ph;0702725	the iso lws high resolution spectral survey towards sagittarius b2	a full spectral survey was carried out towards the giant molecular cloudcomplex, sagittarius b2 (sgr b2), using the iso long wavelength spectrometerfabry-perot mode. this provided complete wavelength coverage in the range47-196 um (6.38-1.53 thz) with a spectral resolution of 30-40 km/s. this is anunique dataset covering wavelengths inaccessible from the ground. it is anextremely important region of the spectrum as it contains both the peak of thethermal emission from dust, and crucial spectral lines of key atomic (oi, cii,oiii, nii and niii) and molecular species (nh3, nh2, nh, h2o, oh, h3o+, ch,ch2, c3, hf and h2d+). in total, 95 spectral lines have been identified and 11features with absorption depth greater than 3 sigma remain unassigned. most ofthe molecular lines are seen in absorption against the strong continuum,whereas the atomic and ionic lines appear in emission (except for absorption inthe oi 63 um and cii 158 um lines). sgr b2 is located close to the galacticcentre and so many of the features also show a broad absorption profile due tomaterial located along the line of sight. a full description of the surveydataset is given with an overview of each detected species and final line listsfor both assigned and unassigned features.

astro-ph;0703022	molecular survey of crl618	we present the complete data set, model and line identification of a surveyof the emission from the c-rich protoplanetary nebula crl 618 performed withthe iram-30m telescope in the following frequency ranges: 80.25-115.75 ghz,131.25-179.25 ghz, and 204.25-275.250 ghz. a selection of lines from differentspecies has been used in previous works to derive the structure of the source,its physical conditions and the chemical abundances in the different gasregions. in this work, we have used this information to run a global simulationof the spectrum in order to check the consistency of the model and to ease thetask of line identification. the total number of lines that have acorrespondence in both data and model is ~3100, although quite often in thisobject many lines blend into complex features so that the model, that takesinto account line blending, is a key tool at this stage of the analysis. of allthe lines that we have been able to label, ~55% of them belong to the differentforms of hc3n, and ~18% to those of hc5n. the density of remaining unidentifiedfeatures above the 3sigma limit is only one per ~2.1 ghz (74 features), whichis unprecedented in the analysis of this type of large millimeter-wave linesurveys.

astro-ph;0703393	sulfur chemistry in the horsehead. an interferometric view of the  horsehead pdr	sulfur is an abundant element which remains undepleted in diffuseinterstellar gas (av&lt;1) but it is traditionally assumed to deplete on dustgrains at higher densities and larger av. photodissociation regions (pdrs) arean interesting intermediate medium between translucent and dark clouds wherethe chemistry and energetics are dominated by the illuminating fuv radiationfield. thus they can provide new insights about the sulfur depletion problem.however, physical and chemical gradients in pdrs take place at small angularscales (~1 to 10''). aperture synthesis observations are therefore required toresolve such gradients. besides, a complete understanding of molecularexcitation is needed to correctly determine molecular abundances but also thepreavailing physical conditions. hence, multi-j observations at increasingfrequencies are also required. such high angular resolution and broad frequencycoverage observations will be provided by alma in the near future. in this workwe present iram-pdbi observations of the cs j=2-1 line toward the horsehead pdrcomplemented with iram-30m observations of several rotational lines ofdifferent sulfur bearing molecules (cs, hcs+, so, h2s, etc.). photochemical andnonlocal, non-lte radiative transfer models adapted to the horsehead geometryhave been developed. the gas phase sulfur abundance has been inferred in thepdr.
