0901.2672	confronting substellar theoretical models with stellar ages	by definition, brown dwarfs never reach the main-sequence, cooling anddimming over their entire lifetime, thus making substellar models challengingto test because of the strong dependence on age. currently, most brown dwarfswith independently determined ages are companions to nearby stars, so stellarages are at the heart of the effort to test substellar models. however, thesemodels are only fully constrained if both the mass and age are known. we haveused the keck adaptive optics system to monitor the orbit of hd 130948bc, abrown dwarf binary that is a companion to the young solar analog hd 130948a.the total dynamical mass of 0.109+/-0.003 msun shows that both components aresubstellar, and the ensemble of available age indicators from the primary starsuggests an age comparable to the hyades, with the most precise age being 0.79gyr based on gyrochronology. therefore, hd 130948bc is unique among field l andt dwarfs as it possesses a well-determined mass, luminosity, and age. ourresults indicate that substellar evolutionary models may underpredict theluminosity of brown dwarfs by as much as a factor of ~2-3x. the implications ofsuch a systematic error in evolutionary models would be far-reaching, forexample, affecting determinations of the initial mass function and predictionsof the radii of extrasolar gas-giant planets. this result is largely based onthe reliability of stellar age estimates, and the case study of hd 130948ahighlights the difficulties in determining the age of an arbitrary field star,even with the most up-to-date chromospheric activity and gyrochronologyrelations. in order to better assess the potential systematic errors present insubstellar models, more refined age estimates for hd 130948a and other starswith binary brown dwarf companions (e.g., eps ind bab) are critically needed.

0902.4742	2mass 22344161+4041387ab: a wide, young, accreting, low-mass binary in  the lkha233 group	we report the discovery of a young, 0.16" binary, 2m2234+4041ab, found as theresult of a keck laser guide star adaptive optics imaging survey of young fieldultracool dwarfs. spatially resolved near-infrared photometry and spectroscopyindicate that the luminosity and temperature ratios of the system are nearunity. from optical and near-infrared spectroscopy, we determine a compositespectral type of m6 for the system. gravity-sensitive spectral features in thespectra of 2m2234+4041ab are best matched to those of young objects (~1 myrold). a comparison of the teff and age of 2m2234+4041ab to evolutionary modelsindicates the mass of each component is 0.10 (+0.075-0.04) msun. emission linesof h alpha in the composite optical spectrum of the system and br gamma inspatially resolved near-ir spectra of the two components indicate that thesystem is actively accreting. both components of the system have ir excesses,indicating that they both harbor circumstellar disks. though 2m2234+4041ab wasoriginally identified as a young field dwarf, it lies 1.5' from thewell-studied herbig ae/be star, lkha 233. the distance to lkha 233 is typicallyassumed to be 880 pc. it is unlikely 2m2234+4041ab could be this distant, as itwould then be more luminous than any known taurus objects of similar spectraltype. we re-evaluate the distance to the lkha 233 group and find a value of 325(+72-50) pc, based on the hipparcos distance to a nearby b3-type group member(hd 213976). 2m2234+4041ab is the first low-mass star to be potentiallyassociated with the lkha 233 group. at a distance of 325 pc, its projectedphysical separation is 51 au, making it one of a growing number of wide,low-mass binaries found in young star-forming regions.

0904.2573	keck laser guide star adaptive optics monitoring of the m8+l7 binary lhs  2397aab: first dynamical mass benchmark at the l/t transition	we present keck lgs ao imaging and aperture masking observations of the m8+l7binary lhs 2397aab. together with archival hst, gemini-north, and vlt data, ourobservations span 11.8 years of the binary's 14.2-year orbital period. wedetermine a total dynamical mass of 0.146+/-0.014 msun (153+/-15 mjup). usingthe combined observational constraints of the total mass and individualluminosities, the tucson (lyon) evolutionary models give an age for the systemof 1.6 gyr (1.8 gyr), consistent with its space motion. we also use thesemodels to determine the mass ratio, giving individual masses of 0.0839+/-0.0011msun (0.0848+/-0.0011 msun) for lhs 2397aa and 0.061+/-0.013 msun(0.060+/-0.010 msun) for lhs 2397ab. because lhs 2397ab is very close to thetheoretical mass-limit of lithium burning, measuring its lithium depletionwould uniquely test substellar models. we estimate a spectral type of l7+/-1for lhs 2397ab, making it the first l/t transition object with a dynamical massdetermination. this enables a precise estimate of its effective temperaturefrom tucson (lyon) models of 1460+/-40 k (1440+/-40 k), which is 200 k higherthan estimates for young late-l companions but consistent with older late-lfield dwarfs, supporting the idea that the temperature of the l/t transition issurface gravity dependent. comparing our temperature estimate for lhs 2397ab tothose derived from spectral synthesis modeling for similar objects revealsconsistency between evolutionary and atmospheric models at the l/t transition,despite the currently limited understanding of this phase of substellarevolution. future dynamical masses for l/t binaries spanning a range of surfacegravity and age will provide the next critical tests of substellar models atthe l/t transition.

0910.1604	the benchmark ultracool subdwarf hd 114762b: a test of low-metallicity  atmospheric and evolutionary models	we present a near-infrared spectroscopic study of hd 114762b, the latest-typemetal-poor companion discovered to date and the only ultracool subdwarf with aknown metallicity, inferred from the primary star to be [fe/h] = -0.7. weobtained a medium-resolution keck/osiris j-band spectrum and a low-resolutionirtf/spex 0.8-2.4 um spectrum of hd 114762b. hd 114762b exhibits spectralfeatures common to both late-type dwarfs and subdwarfs, and we assign it aspectral type of d/sdm9 +/- 1. we use a monte carlo technique to fitphoenix/gaia synthetic spectra to the observations, accounting for thecoarsely-gridded nature of the models. fits to the entire osiris j-band and tothe metal-sensitive j-band atomic absorption features (fe i, k i, and al ilines) yield model parameters that are most consistent with the metallicity ofthe primary star and the high surface gravity expected of old late-typeobjects. the effective temperatures and radii inferred from the modelatmosphere fitting broadly agree with those predicted by the evolutionarymodels of chabrier &amp; baraffe, and the model color-absolute magnitude relationsaccurately predict the metallicity of hd 114762b. we conclude that currentlow-mass, mildly metal-poor atmospheric and evolutionary models are mutuallyconsistent for spectral fits to medium-resolution j-band spectra of hd 114762b,but are inconsistent for fits to low-resolution near-infrared spectra of mildsubdwarfs. finally, we develop a technique for estimating distances toultracool subdwarfs based on a single near-infrared spectrum. we show that this"spectroscopic parallax" method enables distance estimates accurate to &lt; 10% ofparallactic distances for ultracool subdwarfs near the hydrogen burning minimummass.

0912.0738	testing substellar models with dynamical mass measurements	we have been using keck laser guide star adaptive optics to monitor theorbits of ultracool binaries, providing dynamical masses at lower luminositiesand temperatures than previously available and enabling strong tests oftheoretical models. we have identified three specific problems with theory: (1)we find that model color-magnitude diagrams cannot be reliably used to infermasses as they do not accurately reproduce the colors of ultracool dwarfs ofknown mass. (2) effective temperatures inferred from evolutionary model radiiare typically inconsistent with temperatures derived from fitting atmosphericmodels to observed spectra by 100-300 k. (3) for the only known pair of fieldbrown dwarfs with a precise mass (3%) and age determination (~25%), themeasured luminosities are ~2-3x higher than predicted by model cooling rates(i.e., masses inferred from lbol and age are 20-30% larger than measured). tomake progress in understanding the observed discrepancies, more massmeasurements spanning a wide range of luminosity, temperature, and age areneeded, along with more accurate age determinations (e.g., viaasteroseismology) for primary stars with brown dwarf binary companions. also,resolved optical and infrared spectroscopy are needed to measure lithiumdepletion and to characterize the atmospheres of binary components in order tobetter assess model deficiencies.

1103.5747	testing theory with dynamical masses and orbits of ultracool binaries	mass is the fundamental parameter that governs the evolution of stars, browndwarfs, and gas-giant planets. thus, direct mass measurements are essential totest the evolutionary and atmospheric models that underpin studies of theseobjects. we present results from our program to test models using precisedynamical masses for visual binaries based on keck laser guide star adaptiveoptics astrometric monitoring of a sample of over 30 ultracool (&gt; m6) objectssince 2005. in just the last 2 years, we have more than tripled the number oflate-m, l, and t dwarf binaries with precise dynamical masses. for most fieldbinaries, based on direct measurements of their luminosities and total masses,we find a "temperature problem" in that evolutionary model radii give effectivetemperatures that are inconsistent with those from model atmosphere fitting ofobserved spectra by 100-300 k. we also find a "luminosity problem" for the onlybinary with an independent age determination (from its solar-type primary viaage-activity-rotation relations). evolutionary models underpredict theluminosities of hd130948bc by a factor of ~2, implying that model-basedsubstellar mass determinations (e.g., for directly imaged planets and clusterimfs) may be systematically overestimating masses. finally, we have employedthe current sample of binary orbits to carry out a novel test of the earliestevolutionary stages, by using the distribution of orbital eccentricities todistinguish between competing models of brown dwarf formation.

1106.3105	four new t dwarfs identified in panstarrs 1 commissioning data	a complete well-defined sample of ultracool dwarfs is one of the key scienceprograms of the pan-starrs 1 optical survey telescope (ps1). here we combineps1 commissioning data with 2mass to conduct a proper motion search(0.1--2.0\arcsec/yr) for nearby t dwarfs, using optical+near-ir colors toselect objects for spectroscopic followup. the addition of sensitive far-redoptical imaging from ps1 enables discovery of nearby ultracool dwarfs thatcannot be identified from 2mass data alone. we have searched 3700 sq. deg. ofps1 y-band (0.95--1.03 um) data to y$\approx$19.5 mag (ab) and j$\approx$16.5mag (vega) and discovered four previously unknown bright t dwarfs. three of theobjects (with spectral types t1.5, t2 and t3.5) have photometric distanceswithin 25 pc and were missed by previous 2mass searches due to more restrictivecolor selection criteria. the fourth object (spectral type t4.5) is moredistant than 25 pc and is only a single-band detection in 2mass. we alsoexamine the potential for completing the census of nearby ultracool objectswith the ps1 3$\pi$ survey.

1109.5693	a disk around the planetary-mass companion gsc 06214-00210 b: clues  about the formation of gas giants on wide orbits	we present keck/osiris 1.1-1.8 um adaptive optics integral field spectroscopyof the planetary-mass companion to gsc 06214-00210, a member of the ~5 myrupper scorpius ob association. we infer a spectral type of l0+/-1, and ourspectrum exhibits multiple signs of youth. the most notable feature isexceptionally strong pabeta emission (ew=-11.4 +/- 0.3 a) which signals thepresence of a circumplanetary accretion disk. the luminosity of gsc 06214-00210b combined with its age yields a model-dependent mass of 14 +/- 2 mjup, makingit the lowest-mass companion to show evidence of a disk. with a projectedseparation of 320 au, the formation of gsc 06214-00210 b and other verylow-mass companions on similarly wide orbits is unclear. one proposed mechanismis formation at close separations followed by planet-planet scattering to muchlarger orbits. since that scenario involves a close encounter with anothermassive body, which is probably destructive to circumplanetary disks, it isunlikely that gsc 06214-00210 b underwent a scattering event in the past. thisimplies that planet-planet scattering is not solely responsible for thepopulation of gas giants on wide orbits. more generally, the identification ofdisks around young planetary companions on wide orbits offers a novel method toconstrain the formation pathway of these objects, which is otherwisenotoriously difficult to do for individual systems. we also refine the spectraltype of the primary from m1 to k7 and detect a mild (2-sigma) excess at 22 umusing wise photometry.

1201.2465	the hawaii infrared parallax program. i. ultracool binaries and the l/t  transition	we present the first results from our high-precision infrared (ir) astrometryprogram at the canada-france-hawaii telescope. we measure parallaxes for 83ultracool dwarfs (spectral types m6--t9) in 49 systems, with a medianuncertainty of 1.1 mas (2.3%) and as good as 0.7 mas (0.8%). we provide thefirst parallaxes for 48 objects in 29 systems, and for another 27 objects in 17systems, we significantly improve upon published results, with a median (best)improvement of 1.7x (5x). three systems show astrometric perturbationsindicative of orbital motion; two are known binaries (2massj0518-2828ab and2massj1404-3159ab) and one is spectrally peculiar (sdssj0805+4812). inaddition, we present here a large set of keck adaptive optics imaging that morethan triples the number of binaries with l6--t5 components that have bothmulti-band photometry and distances. our data enable an unprecedented look atthe photometric properties of brown dwarfs as they cool through the l/ttransition. going from \approxl8 to \approxt4.5, flux in the y and j bandsincreases by \approx0.7 mag and \approx0.5 mag, respectively (the y- and j-band"bumps"), while flux in the h, k, and l' bands declines monotonically. thiswavelength dependence is consistent with cloud clearing over a narrow range oftemperature, since condensate opacity is expected to dominate at 1.0--1.3micron. interestingly, despite more than doubling the near-ir census of l/ttransition objects, we find a conspicuous paucity of objects on thecolor--magnitude diagram just blueward of the late-l/early-t sequence. this"l/t gap" occurs at mko(j-h) = 0.1--0.3 mag, mko(j-k) = 0.0--0.4 mag, andimplies that the last phases of cloud evolution occur rapidly. finally, weprovide a comprehensive update to the absolute magnitudes of ultracool dwarfsas a function of spectral type using a combined sample of 314 objects.

1206.4044	two extraordinary substellar binaries at the t/y transition and the  y-band fluxes of the coolest brown dwarfs	using keck laser guide star adaptive optics imaging, we have found that thet9 dwarf wise j1217+1626 and t8 dwarf wise j1711+3500 are exceptional binaries,with unusually wide separations (~0.8 arcsec, 8-15 au), large near-ir fluxratios (~2-3 mags), and small mass ratios (~0.5) compared to previously knownfield ultracool binaries. keck/nirspec h-band spectra give a spectral type ofy0 for wise j1217+1626b, and photometric estimates suggest t9.5 for wisej1711+3500b. the wise j1217+1626ab system is very similar to the t9+y0 binarycfbdsir j1458+1013ab; these two systems are the coldest known substellarmultiples, having secondary components of ~400 k and being planetary-massbinaries if their ages are &lt;~1 gyr. both wise j1217+1626b and cfbdsirj1458+1013b have strikingly blue y-j colors compared to previously known tdwarfs, including their t9 primaries. combining all available data, we findthat y-j color drops precipitously between the very latest t dwarfs and the ydwarfs. the fact that this is seen in (coeval, mono-metallicity) binariesdemonstrates that the color drop arises from a change in temperature, notsurface gravity or metallicity variations among the field population. thus, thet/y transition established by near-ir spectra coincides with a significantchange in the ~1 micron fluxes of ultracool photospheres. one explanation isthe depletion of potassium, whose broad absorption wings dominate the far-redoptical spectra of t dwarfs. this large color change suggests that far-red datamay be valuable for classifying objects of &lt;~500 k.

1308.5702	discovery of a visual t-dwarf triple system and binarity at the l/t  transition	we present new high contrast imaging of 8 l/t transition brown dwarfs usingthe nirc2 camera on the keck ii telescope. one of our targets, the t3.5 dwarf2mass j08381155 + 1511155, was resolved into a hierarchal triple with projectedseparations of 2.5+/-0.5 au and 27+/-5 au for the bc and a(bc) componentsrespectively. resolved osiris spectroscopy of the a(bc) components confirm thatall system members are t dwarfs. the system therefore constitutes the firsttriple t-dwarf system ever reported. using resolved photometry to model theintegrated-light spectrum, we infer spectral types of t3, t3, and t4.5 for thea, b, and c components respectively. the uniformly brighter primary has a bluerj-ks color than the next faintest component, which may reflect a sensitivedependence of the l/t transition temperature on gravity, or alternativelydivergent cloud properties amongst components. relying on empirical trends andevolutionary models we infer a total system mass of 0.034-0.104 msun for the bccomponents at ages of 0.3-3 gyr, which would imply a period of 12-21 yrassuming the system semi-major axis to be similar to its projection. we alsoinfer differences in effective temperatures and surface gravities betweencomponents of no more than ~150 k and ~0.1 dex. given the similar physicalproperties of the components, the 2m0838+15 system provides a controlled samplefor constraining the relative roles of effective temperature, surface gravity,and dust clouds in the poorly understood l/t transition regime. combining ourimaging survey results with previous work we find an observed binary fractionof 4/18 or 22_{-8}^{+10}% for unresolved spectral types of l9-t4 at separations&gt;~0.1 arcsec. this translates into a volume-corrected frequency of13^{-6}_{+7}%, which is similar to values of ~9-12% reported outside thetransition.

1309.0503	a search for l/t transition dwarfs with pan-starrs1 and wise: discovery  of seven nearby objects including two candidate spectroscopic variables	we present initial results from a wide-field (30,000 deg^2) search for l/ttransition brown dwarfs within 25 pc using the pan-starrs1 and wise surveys.previous large-area searches have been incomplete for l/t transition dwarfs,because these objects are faint in optical bands and have near-infrared colorsthat are difficult to distinguish from background stars. to overcome theseobstacles, we have cross-matched the pan-starrs1 (optical) and wise (mid-ir)catalogs to produce a unique multi-wavelength database for finding ultracooldwarfs. as part of our initial discoveries, we have identified seven browndwarfs in the l/t transition within 9-15 pc of the sun. the l9.5 dwarf psoj140.2308+45.6487 and the t1.5 dwarf pso j307.6784+07.8263 (both independentlydiscovered by mace et al. 2013) show possible spectroscopic variability at they- and j-bands. two more objects in our sample show evidence of photometricj-band variability, and two others are candidate unresolved binaries based ontheir spectra. we expect our full search to yield a well-defined,volume-limited sample of l/t transition dwarfs that will include many newtargets for study of this complex regime. pso j307.6784+07.8263 in particularmay be an excellent candidate for in-depth study of variability, given itsbrightness (j = 14.2 mag) and proximity (11 pc).

1309.1462	the gemini nici planet-finding campaign: the frequency of planets around  young moving group stars	we report results of a direct imaging survey for giant planets around 80members of the beta pic, tw hya, tucana-horologium, ab dor, and hercules-lyramoving groups, observed as part of the gemini nici planet-finding campaign. forthis sample, we obtained median contrasts of \delta h=13.9 mag at 1" incombined ch4 narrowband adi+sdi mode and median contrasts of \delta h=15.1 magat 2" in h-band adi mode. we found numerous (&gt;70) candidate companions in oursurvey images. some of these candidates were rejected as common-proper motioncompanions using archival data; we reobserved with nici all other candidatesthat lay within 400 au of the star and were not in dense stellar fields. thevast majority of candidate companions were confirmed as background objects fromarchival observations and/or dedicated nici campaign followup. four co-movingcompanions of brown dwarf or stellar mass were discovered in this moving groupsample: pz tel b (36+-6 mjup, 16.4+-1.0 au, biller et al. 2010), cd -35 2722b(31+-8 mjup, 67+-4 au, wahhaj et al. 2011), hd 12894b (0.46+-0.08 msun,15.7+-1.0 au), and bd+07 1919c (0.20+-0.03 msun, 12.5+-1.4 au). from a bayesiananalysis of the achieved h band adi and asdi contrasts, using power-law modelsof planet distributions and hot-start evolutionary models, we restrict thefrequency of 1--20 mjup companions at semi-major axes from 10--150 au to &lt;18%at a 95.4% confidence level using dusty models and to &lt;6% at a 95.4% using condmodels.

1310.0457	the extremely red, young l dwarf pso j318-22: a free-floating  planetary-mass analog to directly imaged young gas-giant planets	we have used pan-starrs1 to discover an extremely red late-l dwarf, which has(j-k)_mko = 2.84 and (j-k)_2mass = 2.78, making it the reddest known fielddwarf and second only to 2mass j1207-39b among substellar companions. near-irspectroscopy shows a spectral type of l7 and reveals a triangular h-bandcontinuum and weak alkali (k i and na i) lines, hallmarks of low surfacegravity. near-ir astrometry from the hawaii infrared parallax program gives adistance of 24.6+/-1.4 pc and indicates a much fainter j-band absolutemagnitude than field l dwarfs. the position and kinematics of pso j318-22 pointto membership in the beta pictoris moving group. evolutionary models give atemperature of 1160 (-40,+30) k and a mass of 6.5 (-1.0, +1.3) mjup, making psoj318-22 one of the lowest mass free-floating objects in the solar neighborhood.this object adds to the growing list of low-gravity field l dwarfs and is thefirst to be strongly deficient in methane relative to its estimatedtemperature. comparing their spectra suggests that young l dwarfs with similarages and temperatures can have different spectral signatures of youth. for thetwo objects with well constrained ages (pso j318-22 and 2mass j0355+11), wefind their temperatures are ~400 k cooler than field objects of similarspectral type but their luminosities are comparable, i.e., these young l dwarfsare very red and unusually cool but not "underluminous." altogether, psoj318-22 is the first free-floating object with the colors, magnitudes,spectrum, luminosity, and mass that overlap the young dusty planets around hr8799 and 2mass j1207-39.

1311.2108	resolved spectroscopy of the t8.5 and y0-0.5 binary wisepc  j121756.91+162640.2ab	we present 0.9 - 2.5 um resolved spectra for the ultracool binary wisepcj121756.91+162640.2ab. the system consists of a pair of brown dwarfs thatstraddles the currently defined t/y spectral type boundary. we use syntheticspectra generated by model atmospheres that include chloride and sulfide clouds(morley et al.), the distance to the system (dupuy &amp; kraus), and the radius ofeach component based on evolutionary models (saumon &amp; marley) to determine aprobable range of physical properties for the binary. the effective temperatureof the t8.5 primary is 550 - 600 k, and that of the y0 - y0.5 secondary is 450k. the atmospheres of both components are either free of clouds or haveextremely thin cloud layers. we find that the masses of the primary andsecondary are 30 and 22 m_jup, respectively, and that the age of the system is4 - 8 gyr. this age is consistent with astrometric measurements (dupuy &amp; kraus)that show that the system has kinematics intermediate between those of the thinand thick disks of the galaxy. an older age is also consistent with anindication by the h - k colors that the system is slightly metal-poor.

1311.7664	three wide planetary-mass companions to fw tau, roxs 12, and roxs 42b	we report the discovery of three planetary-mass companions (m = 6--20$m_{jup}$) in wide orbits ($\rho \sim$ 150--300 au) around the young stars fwtau (taurus-auriga), roxs 12 (ophiuchus), and roxs 42b (ophiuchus). all threewide planetary-mass companions ("pmcs") were reported as candidate companionsin previous binary survey programs, but then were neglected for $&gt;$10 years. wetherefore obtained followup observations which demonstrate that each candidateis comoving with its host star. based on the absolute $m_{k'}$ magnitudes, weinfer masses (from hot-start evolutionary models) and projected separations of10 $\pm$ 4 $m_{jup}$ and 330 $\pm$ 30 au for fw tau b, 16 $\pm$ 4 $m_{jup}$ and210 $\pm$ 20 au for roxs 12 b, and 10 $\pm$ 4 $m_{jup}$ and 140 $\pm$ 10 au forroxs 42b b. we also present similar observations for ten other candidates whichshow that they are unassociated field stars, as well as multicolor jhk'l'near-infrared photometry for our new pmcs and for five previously-identifiedsubstellar or planetary-mass companions. the nir photometry for our sample ofeight known and new companions generally parallels the properties offree-floating low-mass brown dwarfs in these star-forming regions. however, 5of the 7 objects with m $&lt;$ 30 $m_{jup}$ are redder in k'-l' than thedistribution of young free-floating counterparts of similar j-k'. we speculatethat this distinction could indicate a structural difference incircum-planetary disks, perhaps tied to higher disk mass since at least two ofthe objects in our sample are known to be accreting more vigorously thantypical free-floating counterparts.

1401.7668	spectroscopic confirmation of young planetary-mass companions on wide  orbits	we present moderate-resolution ($r$$\sim$4000-5000) near-infrared integralfield spectroscopy of the young (1-5 myr) 6-14 $m_\mathrm{jup}$ companions roxs42b b and fw tau b obtained with keck/osiris and gemini-north/nifs. thespectrum of roxs 42b b exhibits clear signs of low surface gravity common toyoung l dwarfs, confirming its extreme youth, cool temperature, and low mass.overall, it closely resembles the free-floating 4-7 $m_\mathrm{jup}$ l-typetaurus member 2mass j04373705+2331080. the companion to fw tau ab is moreenigmatic. our optical and near-infrared spectra show strong evidence ofoutflow activity and disk accretion in the form of line emission from [s ii],[o i], h$\alpha$, ca ii, [fe ii], pa$\beta$, and h$_2$. the molecular hydrogenemission is spatially resolved as a single lobe that stretches $\approx$0.1"(15 au). although the extended emission is not kinematically resolved in ourdata, its morphology resembles shock-excited h$_2$ jets primarily seen in youngclass 0 and class i sources. the near-infrared continuum of fw tau b is mostlyflat and lacks the deep absorption features expected for a cool, late-typeobject. this may be a result of accretion-induced veiling, especially in lightof its strong and sustained h$\alpha$ emission ($ew$(h$\alpha$)$\gtrsim$290\aa). alternatively, fw tau b may be a slightly warmer (m5-m8) accretinglow-mass star or brown dwarf (0.03-0.15 $m_{\odot}$) with an edge-on disk.regardless, its young evolutionary stage is in stark contrast to its class iiihost fw tau ab, indicating a more rapid disk clearing timescale for the hostbinary system than for its wide companion. finally, we present near-infraredspectra of the young ($\sim$2-10 myr) low-mass (12-15 $m_\mathrm{jup}$)companions gsc 6214-210 b and sr 12 c and find they best resemble low gravitym9.5 and m9 substellar templates.

1403.0050	a stellar census of the tucana-horologium moving group	we report the selection and spectroscopic confirmation of 129 new late-type(k3-m6) members of the tuc-hor moving group, a nearby (~40 pc), young (~40 myr)population of comoving stars. we also report observations for 13/17 knowntuc-hor members in this spectral type range, and that 62 additional candidatesare likely to be unassociated field stars; the confirmation frequency for newcandidates is therefore 129/191 = 67%. we have used rvs, halpha emission, andli6708 absorption to distinguish contaminants and bona fide members. ourexpanded census of tuc-hor increases the known population by a factor of ~3 intotal and by a factor of ~8 for members with spt&gt;k3, but even so, the k-m dwarfpopulation of tuc-hor is still markedly incomplete. the spatial distribution ofmembers appears to trace a 2d sheet, with a broad distribution in x and y, buta very narrow distribution (+/-5 pc) in z. the corresponding velocitydistribution is very small, with a scatter of +/-1.1 km/s about the mean uvwvelocity. we also show that the isochronal age (20--30 myr) and the lithiumdepletion age (40 myr) disagree, following a trend seen in other pmspopulations. the halpha emission follows a trend of increasing ew with laterspt, as seen for young clusters. we find that members have been depleted oflithium for spectral types of k7.0-m4.5. finally, our purely kinematic andcolor-magnitude selection procedure allows us to test the efficiency andcompleteness for activity-based selection of young stars. we find that 60% ofk-m dwarfs in tuc-hor do not have rosat counterparts and would be omitted inxray selected samples. galex uv-selected samples using a previously suggestedcriterion for youth achieve completeness of 77% and purity of 78%. we suggestnew selection criteria that yield &gt;95% completeness for ~40 myrpopulations.(abridged)

1403.0560	magellan adaptive optics first-light observations of the exoplanet  $\beta$ pic b. i. direct imaging in the far-red optical with magao+visao and  in the near-ir with nici	we present the first ground-based ccd ($\lambda &lt; 1\mu$m) image of anextrasolar planet. using magao's visao camera we detected the extrasolar giantplanet (egp) $\beta$ pictoris b in $y$-short ($y_s$, 0.985 $\mu$m), at aseparation of $0.470 \pm 0.010''$ and a contrast of $(1.63 \pm 0.49) \times10^{-5}$. this detection has a signal-to-noise ratio of 4.1, with anempirically estimated upper-limit on false alarm probability of 1.0%. we alsopresent new photometry from the nici instrument on the gemini-south telescope,in $ch_{4s,1\%}$ ($1.58$ $\mu m$), $k_s$ ($2.18\mu m$), and $k_{cont}$ (2.27$\mu m$). a thorough analysis of our photometry combined with previousmeasurements yields an estimated near-ir spectral type of l$2.5\pm1.5$,consistent with previous estimates. we estimate log$(l_{bol}/l_{sun})$ = $-3.86\pm 0.04$, which is consistent with prior estimates for $\beta$ pic b and withfield early-l brown dwarfs. this yields a hot-start mass estimate of $11.9 \pm0.7$ $m_{jup}$ for an age of $21\pm4$ myr, with an upper limit below thedeuterium burning mass. our $l_{bol}$ based hot-start estimate for temperatureis $t_{eff}=1643\pm32$ k (not including model dependent uncertainty). due tothe large corresponding model-derived radius of $r=1.43\pm0.02$ $r_{jup}$, this$t_{eff}$ is $\sim$$250$ k cooler than would be expected for a field l2.5 browndwarf. other young, low-gravity (large radius), ultracool dwarfs anddirectly-imaged egps also have lower effective temperatures than are implied bytheir spectral types. however, such objects tend to be anomalously red in thenear-ir compared to field brown dwarfs. in contrast, $\beta$ pic b has near-ircolors more typical of an early-l dwarf despite its lower inferred temperature.

1403.5560	prospecting in ultracool dwarfs: measuring the metallicities of mid- and  late-m dwarfs	metallicity is a fundamental parameter that contributes to the physicalcharacteristics of a star. however, the low temperatures and complex moleculespresent in m dwarf atmospheres make it difficult to measure their metallicitiesusing techniques that have been commonly used for sun-like stars. althoughthere has been significant progress in developing empirical methods to measurem dwarf metallicities over the last few years, these techniques have beendeveloped primarily for early- to mid-m dwarfs. we present a method to measurethe metallicity of mid- to late-m dwarfs from moderate resolution (r~2000)k-band (2.2 microns) spectra. we calibrate our formula using 44 wide binariescontaining an f, g, k, or early m primary of known metallicity and a mid- tolate-m dwarf companion. we show that similar features and techniques used forearly m dwarfs are still effective for late-m dwarfs. our revised calibrationis accurate to 0.07 dex for m4.5-m9.5 dwarfs with -0.58&lt;[fe/h]&lt;+0.56 and showsno systematic trends with spectral type, metallicity, or the method used todetermine the primary star metallicity. we show that our method givesconsistent metallicities for the components of m+m wide binaries. we verifythat our new formula works for unresolved binaries by combining spectra ofsingle stars. lastly, we show that our calibration gives consistentmetallicities with the mann et al. (2013a) study for overlapping (m4-m5) stars,establishing that the two calibrations can be used in combination to determinemetallicities across the entire m dwarf sequence.

1403.7195	the gemini nici planet-finding campaign: the orbit of the young  exoplanet beta pictoris b	we present new astrometry for the young (12--21 myr) exoplanet beta pictorisb taken with the gemini/nici and magellan/magao instruments between 2009 and2012. the high dynamic range of our observations allows us to measure therelative position of beta pic b with respect to its primary star with greateraccuracy than previous observations. based on a markov chain monte carloanalysis, we find the planet has an orbital semi-major axis of 9.1 (+5.3, -0.5)au and orbital eccentricity &lt;0.15 at 68% confidence (with 95% confidenceintervals of 8.2--48 au and 0.00--0.82 for semi-major axis and eccentricity,respectively, due to a long narrow degenerate tail between the two). we findthat the planet has reached its maximum projected elongation, enabling higherprecision determination of the orbital parameters than previously possible, andthat the planet's projected separation is currently decreasing. withunsaturated data of the entire beta pic system (primary star, planet, and disk)obtained thanks to nici's semi-transparent focal plane mask, we are able totightly constrain the relative orientation of the circumstellar components. wefind the orbital plane of the planet lies between the inner and outer disks:the position angle (pa) of nodes for the planet's orbit (211.8 +/- 0.3 degrees)is 7.4 sigma greater than the pa of the spine of the outer disk and 3.2 sigmaless than the warped inner disk pa, indicating the disk is not collisionallyrelaxed. finally, for the first time we are able to dynamically constrain themass of the primary star beta pic to 1.76 (+0.18, -0.17) solar masses.

1404.6525	the gemini nici planet-finding campaign: the offset ring of hr 4796 a	we present j, h, ch_4 short (1.578 micron), ch_4 long (1.652 micron) andk_s-band images of the dust ring around the 10 myr old star hr 4796 a obtainedusing the near infrared coronagraphic imager (nici) on the gemini-south 8.1meter telescope. our images clearly show for the first time the position of thestar relative to its circumstellar ring thanks to nici's translucent focalplane occulting mask. we employ a bayesian markov chain monte carlo method toconstrain the offset vector between the two. the resulting probabilitydistribution shows that the ring center is offset from the star by 16.7+/-1.3milliarcseconds along a position angle of 26+/-3 degrees, along the pa of thering, 26.47+/-0.04 degrees. we find that the size of this offset is not largeenough to explain the brightness asymmetry of the ring. the ring is measured tohave mostly red reflectivity across the jhk_s filters, which seems to indicatemicron-sized grains. just like neptune's 3:2 and 2:1 mean-motion resonancesdelineate the inner and outer edges of the classical kuiper belt, we find thatthe radial extent of the hr 4796 a and fomalhaut rings could correspond to the3:2 and 2:1 mean-motion resonances of hypothetical planets at 54.7 au and 97.7au in the two systems, respectively. a planet orbiting hr 4796 a at 54.7 auwould have to be less massive than 1.6 mjup so as not to widen the ring toomuch by stirring.

0803.0295	subtle signatures of multiplicity in late-type dwarf spectra: the  unresolved m8.5 + t5 binary 2mass j03202839-0446358	evidence is presented that 2mass j03202839-0446358, a late-type dwarf withdiscrepant optical (m8:) and near-infrared (l1) spectral types, is an as-yetunresolved stellar/brown dwarf binary with late-type m dwarf and t dwarfcomponents. this conclusion is based on low-resolution, near-infraredspectroscopy that reveals a subtle but distinctive absorption feature at 1.6micron. the feature, which is also present in the combined light spectrum ofthe m8.5 + t6 binary scr 1845-6357, arises from the combination of fehabsorption from an m8.5 primary and pseudo-continuum flux from a t5+/-1secondary, as ascertained from binary spectral templates constructed fromempirical data. the binary templates provide a far superior match to theoverall near-infrared spectral energy distribution of 2mass j0320-0446 than anysingle comparison spectra. laser guide star adaptive optics (lgs ao) imagingobservations, including the first application of lgs ao aperture maskinterferometry, fail to resolve a faint companion, restricting the projectedseparation of the system to less than 8.3 au at the time of observation. 2massj0320-0446 is the second very low mass binary to be identified from unresolved,low-resolution, near-infrared spectroscopy, a technique that complementstraditional high resolution imaging and spectroscopic methods.

1406.1184	new evidence for a substellar luminosity problem: dynamical mass for the  brown dwarf binary gl 417bc	we present new evidence for a problem with cooling rates predicted bysubstellar evolutionary models that implies model-derived masses in theliterature for brown dwarfs and directly imaged planets may be too high. basedon our dynamical mass for gl 417bc (l4.5+l6) and a gyrochronology system agefrom its young, solar-type host star, commonly used models predict luminosities0.2$-$0.4 dex lower than we observe. this corroborates a similarluminosity$-$age discrepancy identified in our previous work on the l4+l4binary hd 130948bc, which coincidentally has nearly identical component masses($\approx$50$-$55 $m_{\rm jup}$) and age ($\approx$800 myr) as gl 417bc. such aluminosity offset would cause systematic errors of 15%$-$25% in model-derivedmasses at this age. after comparing different models, including cloudlessmodels that should not be appropriate for mid-l dwarfs like gl 417bc and hd130948bc but actually match their luminosities better, we speculate theobserved over-luminosity could be caused by opacity holes (i.e., patchy clouds)in these objects. moreover, from hybrid substellar evolutionary models thataccount for cloud disappearance we infer the corresponding phase ofover-luminosity may extend from a few hundred myr up to a few gyr and causemasses to to be over-estimated by up to 25%, even well after clouds disappearfrom view entirely. thus, the range of of ages and spectral types affected bythis potential systematic shift in luminosity evolution would encompass mostknown directly imaged gas-giants and field brown dwarfs.

1411.1858	herschel/pacs view of disks around low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in  the tw hya association	we conducted herschel/pacs observations of five very low-mass stars or browndwarfs located in the tw hya association with the goal of characterizing theproperties of disks in the low stellar mass regime. we detected all fivetargets at $70\,\mu{\rm{m}}$ and $100\,\mu{\rm{m}}$ and three targets at$160\,\mu{\rm{m}}$. our observations, combined with previous photometry from2mass, wise, and scuba-2, enabled us to construct seds with extended wavelengthcoverage. using sophisticated radiative transfer models, we analyzed theobserved seds of the five detected objects with a hybrid fitting strategy thatcombines the model grids and the simulated annealing algorithm and evaluatedthe constraints on the disk properties via the bayesian inference method. themodelling suggests that disks around low-mass stars and brown dwarfs aregenerally flatter than their higher mass counterparts, but the range of diskmass extends to well below the value found in t tauri stars, and the disk scaleheights are comparable in both groups. the inferred disk properties (i.e., diskmass, flaring, and scale height) in the low stellar mass regime are consistentwith previous findings from large samples of brown dwarfs and very low-massstars. we discuss the dependence of disk properties on their host stellarparameters and find a significant correlation between the herschel far-irfluxes and the stellar effective temperatures, probably indicating that thescaling between the stellar and disk masses (i.e., $m_{\rm{disk}} \proptom_{\star}$) observed mainly in low-mass stars may extend down to the browndwarf regime.

1412.2175	an alma disk mass for the candidate protoplanetary companion to fw tau	we present alma observations of the fw tau system, a close binary pair of m5stars with a wide-orbit (300 au projected separation) substellar companion. thecompanion is extremely faint and red in the optical and near-infrared, butboasts a weak far-infrared excess and optical/near-infrared emission linesindicative of a primordial accretion disk of gas and dust. thecomponent-resolved 1.3 mm continuum emission is found to be associated onlywith the companion, with a flux (1.78 +/- 0.03 mjy) that indicates a dust massof 1-2 m_earth. while this mass reservoir is insufficient to form a giantplanet, it is more than sufficient to produce an analog of the kepler-42exoplanetary system or the galilean satellites. the mass and geometry of thedisk-bearing fw tau companion remains unclear. near-infrared spectroscopy showsdeep water bands that indicate a spectral type later than m5, but substantialveiling prevents a more accurate determination of the effective temperature(and hence mass). both a disk-bearing "planetary-mass" companion seen in directlight or a brown dwarf tertiary viewed in light scattered by an edge-on disk orenvelope remain possibilities.

1502.03092	improving signal to noise in the direct imaging of exoplanets and  circumstellar disks	we present a new algorithm designed to improve the signal to noise ratio(snr) of point and extended source detections in direct imaging data. the novelpart of our method is that it finds the linear combination of the scienceimages that best match counterpart images with signal removed from suspectedsource regions. the algorithm, based on the locally optimized combination ofimages (loci) method, is called matched loci or mloci. we show using dataobtained with the gemini planet imager (gpi) and near-infrared coronagraphicimager (nici) that the new algorithm can improve the snr of point sourcedetections by 30-400% over past methods. we also find no increase in falsedetections rates. no prior knowledge of candidate companion locations isrequired to use mloci. while non-blind applications may yield linearcombinations of science images which seem to increase the snr of true sourcesby a factor &gt; 2, they can also yield false detections at high rates. this is apotential pitfall when trying to confirm marginal detections or to re-detectpoint sources found in previous epochs. our findings are relevant to any methodwhere the coefficients of the linear combination are considered tunable, e.g.loci and principal component analysis (pca). thus we recommend that falsedetection rates be analyzed when using these techniques.

1502.04707	discovery of a low-luminosity, tight substellar binary at the t/y  transition	we have discovered that the brown dwarf wisej014656.66+423410.0 is a closebinary (0.0875$\pm$0.0021 arcsec, 0.93$^{+0.12}_{-0.16}$ au) from keck laserguide star adaptive optics imaging. our photometry for this system reveals thatboth components are less luminous than those in any known substellar binary.combining a new integrated-light spectrum (t9p) and resolved yjh-bandphotometry from keck allows us to perform spectral decomposition and assigncomponent types of t9 and y0. many of the unusual features in the spectrummight be explained by high surface gravity: y-band peak broadened to the blue;j-band peak broadened to the red; h-band peak shifted slightly to the red; andred y-j colors. interestingly, the very low component luminosities imply thatthe t9 primary is unexpectedly cold ($t_{\rm eff}$ = 345$\pm$45 k assuming anage of 10 gyr), making it $\approx$100 k cooler than any other late-t dwarf andcomparable to y dwarfs. one intriguing explanation for this apparentdiscrepancy is that the j- and h-band spectral features that trigger thetransition from t to y spectral types are highly gravity-dependent. this can betested directly in the very near future by orbit monitoring. we constrain theorbital period to be $\lesssim$10 yr by combining evolutionary model-based massestimates for the components ($\approx$12$-$21 $m_{\rm jup}$, 1$\sigma$ at 10gyr) with a statistical constraint on the semimajor axis ($\lesssim$1.3 au).such a period is shorter than any other known t/y transition binary, meaningthat wisej0146+4234ab will likely yield a dynamical mass within the next fewyears.

1503.06212	the mass-luminosity relation in the l/t transition: individual dynamical  masses for the new j-band flux reversal binary sdssj105213.51+442255.7ab	we have discovered that sdssj105213.51+442255.7 (t0.5$\pm$1.0) is a binary inkeck laser guide star adaptive optics imaging, displaying a large j-to-k-bandflux reversal ($\delta$j = -0.45$\pm$0.09 mag, $\delta$k = 0.52$\pm$0.05 mag).we determine a total dynamical mass from keck orbital monitoring (88$\pm$5$m_{\rm jup}$) and a mass ratio by measuring the photocenter orbit fromcfht/wircam absolute astrometry ($m_b/m_a$ = 0.78$\pm$0.07). combining theseprovides the first individual dynamical masses for any field l or t dwarfs,49$\pm$3 $m_{\rm jup}$ for the l6.5$\pm$1.5 primary and 39$\pm$3 $m_{\rm jup}$for the t1.5$\pm$1.0 secondary. such a low mass ratio for a nearly equalluminosity binary implies a shallow mass$-$luminosity relation over the l/ttransition ($\delta$log$l_{\rm bol}$/$\delta$log$m = 0.6^{+0.6}_{-0.8}$). thisprovides the first observational support that cloud dispersal plays asignificant role in the luminosity evolution of substellar objects. fullycloudy models fail our coevality test for this binary, giving ages for the twocomponents that disagree by 0.2 dex (2.0$\sigma$). in contrast, our observedmasses and luminosities can be reproduced at a single age by "hybrid"evolutionary tracks where a smooth change from a cloudy to cloudlessphotosphere around 1300 k causes slowing of luminosity evolution. remarkably,such models also match our observed jhk flux ratios and colors well. overall,it seems that the distinguishing features sdssj1052+4422ab, like a j-band fluxreversal and high-amplitude variability, are normal for a field l/t binarycaught during the process of cloud dispersal, given that the age(1.11$^{+0.17}_{-0.20}$ gyr) and surface gravity (log$g$ = 5.0$-$5.2) ofsdssj1052+4422ab are typical for field ultracool dwarfs.

0806.4163	submillimeter observations of the young low-mass object iras 04158+2805	we present high spatial resolution submillimeter array observations andsupplementary single-dish photometry of the molecular gas and dust around iras04158+2805, a young source with spectral type m5-m6 in the taurus star-formingregion. a bright, highly elongated dust structure that extends 8" (~1120 au) indiameter is revealed in a 883 micron thermal continuum image. this emissiongeometry is in good agreement with optical observations that show a similarstructure in absorption, aligned perpendicular to bipolar scattered lightnebulae. however, the interferometric data also clearly demonstrate that thesubmillimeter continuum emission is not centrally concentrated, but ratherappears to have a toroidal geometry with substantially lower intensities insidea radius of ~250-300 au. spatially resolved emission from the co j=3-2transition exhibits a velocity gradient along the major axis of the duststructure. if this kinematic pattern is interpreted as the signature ofrotation around a central object, a relatively low mass is inferred (m_star =0.3 m_sun, with a ~50% uncertainty). we discuss several possible explanationsfor the observed gas and dust environment around iras 04158+2805, including aflattened envelope with an outflow cavity and a large circumbinary ring. thissource offers unique views of the gas and dust environment surrounding a younglow-mass stellar system. its properties are generally not commensurate withformation scenarios for such low-mass objects that rely on dynamical ejection,but rather confirms that a single mechanism - molecular cloud core collapse andfragmentation - can produce stars over a wide range of stellar masses (at leastan order of magnitude).

astro-ph;0004367	theoretical predictions for surface brightness fluctuations and  implications for stellar populations of elliptical galaxies	(abridged) we present new theoretical predictions for surface brightnessfluctuations (sbfs) using models optimized for this purpose. our predictionsagree well with sbf data for globular clusters and elliptical galaxies. weprovide refined theoretical calibrations and k-corrections needed to use sbfsas standard candles. we suggest that sbf distance measurements can be improvedby using a filter around 1 micron and calibrating i-band sbfs with theintegrated v-k galaxy color. we also show that current sbf data provide usefulconstraints on population synthesis models, and we suggest sbf-based tests forfuture models. the data favor specific choices of evolutionary tracks andspectra in the models among the several choices allowed by comparisons based ononly integrated light. in addition, the tightness of the empirical i-band sbfcalibration suggests that model uncertainties in post-main sequence lifetimesare less than +/-50% and that the imf in ellipticals is not much steeper thanthat in the solar neighborhood. finally, we analyze the potential of sbfs forprobing unresolved stellar populations. we find that optical/near-ir sbfs aremuch more sensitive to metallicity than to age. therefore, sbf magnitudes andcolors are a valuable tool to break the age/metallicity degeneracy. our initialresults suggest that the most luminous stellar populations of bright clustergalaxies have roughly solar metallicities and about a factor of three spread inage.

astro-ph;0005234	an excess of submm sources near 4c41.17: a candidate proto-cluster at  z=3.8?	biased galaxy-formation theories predict that massive galaxies at highredshifts should act as signposts to high-density environments in the earlyuniverse, which subsequently evolve into the cores of the richest clusters seenat the present day. these regions are characterised by over-densities of younggalaxies, perhaps including a population of dusty, interaction-drivenstarbursts - the progenitors of massive cluster ellipticals. by searching forthis population at submm wavelengths we can therefore test both galaxy- andstructure-formation models. we have undertaken such a search in the field of az=3.8 radio galaxy, 4c41.17, with the scuba submm camera. our extremely deep450- and 850-micron maps reveal an order-of-magnitude over-density of luminoussubmm galaxies compared to typical fields (the likelihood of finding such anover-density in a random field is &lt;2e-3). the scuba galaxies have bolometricluminosities, &gt;10^13 l(solar), which imply star-formation rates consistent withthose required to form a massive galaxy in only a few 10^8 years. we also notethat this field exhibits an over-density of extremely red objects (eros), someof which may be associated with the submm sources, and lyman-break galaxies. wepropose that the over-densities of both submm and ero sources in this fieldrepresent young dusty, starburst galaxies forming within a proto-clustercentered on the radio galaxy at z=3.8, which is also traced by a less-obscuredpopulation of lyman-break galaxies.

astro-ph;0005305	the nature of the halo population of ngc 5128 resolved with nicmos on  the hubble space telescope	we present the first infrared color-magnitude diagram (cmd) for the halo of agiant elliptical galaxy. the cmd for the stars in the halo of ngc 5128(centaurus a) was constructed from hst nicmos observations of the wfpc2 chip-3field of soria et al. (1996) to a 50% completeness magnitude limit of[f160w]=23.8. this field is located at a distance of 08'50" (~9 kpc) south ofthe center of the galaxy. the luminosity function (lf) shows a markeddiscontinuity at [f160w]=20.0. this is 1-2 mag above the tip of the red giantbranch (trgb) expected for an old population (~12 gyr) at the distance modulusof ngc 5128. we propose that the majority of stars above the trgb haveintermediate ages (~2 gyr), in agreement with the wfpc2 observations of soriaet al. (1996). five stars with magnitudes brighter than the lf discontinuityare most probably due to galactic contamination. the weighted average of themean giant branch color above our 50% completeness limit is[f110w]-[f160w]=1.22+-0.08 with a dispersion of 0.19 mag. from ourartificial-star experiments we determine that the observed spread in color isreal, suggesting a real spread in metallicity. we estimate the lower and upperbounds of the stellar metallicity range by comparisons with observations ofgalactic star clusters and theoretical isochrones. assuming an old population,we find that, in the halo field of ngc 5128 we surveyed, stars havemetallicities ranging from roughly 1% of solar at the blue end of the colorspread to roughly solar at the red end, with a mean of [fe/h]=-0.76 and adispersion of 0.44 dex.

astro-ph;0107357	surface brightness fluctuations of fornax cluster galaxies: calibration  of infrared sbfs and evidence for recent star formation	we have measured k-band surface brightness fluctuations (sbfs) of 19early-type galaxies in the fornax cluster. combining our results with publisheddata, we find the absolute sbf magnitude mbar_k = (-5.84)+(3.6)*[(v-i)-1.15].the intrinsic cosmic scatter of mbar_k appears to be larger than that of i-bandsbfs. the discovery of a correlation between k-band sbfs and v-i color is a newclue into the star formation histories of early-type galaxies. this relationnaturally accounts for galaxies previously claimed to have anomalously brightk-band sbfs, namely m32 and ngc 4489. models indicate that the stellarpopulations dominating the sbf signal have a significant range in age; somescatter in metallicity may also be present. the youngest ages imply somegalaxies have very luminous giant branches, akin to those in intermediate-age(few gyr) magellanic cloud clusters. a few fornax galaxies have unusuallybright k-band sbfs, perhaps originating from a high metallicity burst of starformation in the last few gyr. the increased spread and brightening of thek-band sbfs with bluer (v-i) colors suggest that the lower mass clustergalaxies may have had more extended and more heterogeneous star formationhistories than those of the more massive galaxies.

astro-ph;0210523	a survey for circumstellar disks around young substellar objects	(abridged) we have completed the first systematic survey for disks aroundspectroscopically identified young brown dwarfs and very low mass stars. wehave obtained l'-band (3.8 um) imaging for 38 very cool objects in ic 348 andtaurus. our targets span spectral types from m6 to m9.5 (~100 to ~15 mjup).using the objects' measured spectral types and extinctions, we find that mostof our sample (77%+/-15%) possess intrinsic ir excesses, indicative of disks.because the excesses are modest, conventional analyses using only ir colorswould have missed most of the sources with excesses. the observed ir excessesare correlated with halpha emission, consistent with a common accretion diskorigin. the excesses can be explained by disk reprocessing of starlight alone;the implied accretion rates are at least an order of magnitude below typicalvalues for classical t tauri stars. the observed distribution of ir excessessuggests the presence of inner disk holes. the disk frequency appears to beindependent of the mass and age. in the same star-forming regions, disks aroundbrown dwarfs are at least as long-lived (~3 myr) as disks around the t tauristars. altogether, the frequency and properties of young circumstellar disksappear to be similar from the stellar regime down to the substellar andplanetary-mass regime. this provides prima facie evidence of a common originfor most stars and brown dwarfs.

astro-ph;0508082	kelu-1 is a binary l dwarf: first brown dwarf science from laser guide  star adaptive optics	(abridged) we present near-ir imaging of the nearby l dwarf kelu-1 obtainedwith the keck sodium laser guide star adaptive optics (lgs ao) system as partof a high angular resolution survey for substellar binaries. kelu-1 was one ofthe first free-floating l dwarfs identified, and the origin of itsoverluminosity compared to other similar objects has been a long-standingquestion. our images clearly resolve kelu-1 into a 0.29'' (5.4 au) binary, anda previous non-detection by hst demonstrates that the system is a true physicalpair. binarity explains the properties of kelu-1 that were previously noted tobe anomalous compared to other early-l dwarfs. we estimate spectral types ofl1.5-l3 and l3-l4.5 for the two components, giving model-derived masses of0.05-0.07 msun and 0.045-0.065 msun for an estimated age of 0.3-0.8 gyr. moredistant companions are not detected to a limit of 5-9 mjup. the presence oflithium absorption indicates that both components are substellar, but theweakness of this feature relative to other l dwarfs can be explained if onlykelu-1b is li-bearing. determining whether both or only one of the componentspossesses lithium could constrain the age of kelu-1 (and other li-bearing lbinaries) with higher precision than is possible for most ultracool fieldobjects. these results are the first lgs ao observations of brown dwarfs anddemonstrate the potential of this new instrumental capability for substellarastronomy.

astro-ph;0509004	near-ir surface brightness fluctuations and optical colours of  magellanic star clusters	this work continues our efforts to calibrate model surface brightnessluminosities for the study of unresolved stellar populations, through thecomparison with data of magellanic cloud star clusters. we present here therelation between absolute k_s-band fluctuation magnitude and (v - i) integratedcolour, using data from the 2mass and denis surveys, and from the literature.we compare the star cluster sample with the sample of early-type galaxies andspiral bulges studied by liu et al. (2002). we find that intermediate-age toold clusters lie along a linear correlation with the same slope, within theerrors, of that defined by the galaxies in the barm_{k_s} vs. (v - i) diagram.while the calibration by liu et al. was determined in the colour range 1.05 &lt;(v - i_c)_0 &lt; 1.25, ours holds in the interval -5 &gt;= barm_{k_s} &gt;= -9, 0.3 &lt;=(v - i) &lt;= 1.25. this implies, according to bruzual &amp; charlot (2003) andmouhcine &amp; lancon (2003) models, that the star clusters and the latest starformation bursts in the galaxies and bulges constitute an age sequence. at thesame time, there is a slight offset between the galaxies and the star clusters[the latter are ~ 0.7 mag fainter than the former at a given value of (v - i)],caused by the difference in metallicity of roughly a factor of two. theconfrontation between models and galaxy data also suggests that galaxies withk_s fluctuation magnitudes that are brighter than predicted, given their (v -i) colour, might be explained in part by longer lifetimes of tp-agb stars.(abridged version.)

astro-ph;0605037	sdss j1534+1615ab: a novel t dwarf binary found with keck laser guide  star adaptive optics and the potential role of binarity in the l/t transition	we have resolved the newly discovered t dwarf sdss j1534+1615 into a 0.11''binary using the keck sodium laser guide star adaptive optics system. with anintegrated-light spectral type of t3.5, this binary provides a new benchmarkfor studying the distinctive j-band brightening previously noted among earlyand mid-t dwarfs, using two brown dwarfs with different spectral types buthaving a common metallicity and age and very similar surface gravities. weestimate spectral types of t1.5+/-0.5 and t5.5+/-0.5 for the two componentsbased on their near-ir colors, consistent with modeling the integrated-lightspectrum as the blend of two components. the observed near-ir flux ratios areunique compared to all previously known substellar binaries: the component thatis fainter at h and k' is brighter at j. this inversion of the near-ir fluxesis a manifestation of the j-band brightening within this individual binarysystem. therefore, sdss 1534+1615 demonstrates that the brightening can beintrinsic to ultracool photospheres (e.g., arising from cloud disruption and/orrapid increase in cloud sedimentation) and does not necessarily result fromphysical variations among the observed ensemble of t dwarfs (e.g., a range inmasses, ages and/or metallicities). we suggest that the apparently largeamplitude of the j-band brightening may be due to a high incidence ofunresolved binaries and that the true amplitude of the phenomenon could be moremodest. this scenario would imply that truly single objects in these spectralsubclasses are relatively rare, in agreement with the small effectivetemperature range inferred for the l/t transition.

astro-ph;0609799	a re-appraisal of the habitability of planets around m dwarf stars	stable, hydrogen-burning, m dwarf stars comprise about 75% of all stars inthe galaxy. they are extremely long-lived and because they are much smaller inmass than the sun (between 0.5 and 0.08 msun), their temperature and stellarluminosity are low and peaked in the red. we have re-examined what is known atpresent about the potential for a terrestrial planet forming within, ormigrating into, the classic liquid-surface-water habitable zone close to an mdwarf star. observations of protoplanetary disks suggest that planet-buildingmaterials are common around m dwarfs, but n-body simulations differ in theirestimations of the likelihood of potentially-habitable, wet planets residingwithin their habitable zones, which are only ~ 1/5 to 1/50 of the width of thatfor a g star. particularly in light of the claimed detection of the planetswith masses as small as 5.5 and 7.5 mearth orbiting m stars, there seems noreason to exclude the possibility of terrestrial planets. tidally lockedsynchronous rotation within the narrow habitable zone doesn't necessarily leadto atmospheric collapse, and active stellar flaring may not be as much of anevolutionarily disadvantageous factor as has previously been supposed. weconclude that m dwarf stars may indeed be viable hosts for planets on which theorigin and evolution of life can occur. a number of planetary processes such ascessation of geothermal activity, or thermal and non-thermal atmospheric lossprocesses may limit the duration of planetary habitability to periods farshorter than the extreme lifetime of the m dwarf star. nevertheless, it makessense to include m dwarf stars in programs that seek to find habitable worldsand evidence of life.

astro-ph;0611408	characterizing young brown dwarfs using low resolution near-ir spectra	we present near-infrared (1.0-2.4 micron) spectra confirming the youth andcool effective temperatures of 6 brown dwarfs and low mass stars withcircumstellar disks toward the chamaeleon ii and ophiuchus star formingregions. the spectrum of one of our objects indicates that it has a spectraltype of ~l1, making it one of the latest spectral type young brown dwarfsidentified to date. comparing spectra of young brown dwarfs, field dwarfs, andgiant stars, we define a 1.49-1.56 micron h2o index capable of determiningspectral type to within 1 sub-type, independent of gravity. we have alsodefined an index based on the 1.14 micron sodium feature that is sensitive togravity, but only weakly dependent on spectral type for field dwarfs. our 1.14micron na index can be used to distinguish young cluster members (t &lt;~ 5 myr)from young field dwarfs, both of which may have the triangular h-band continuumshape which persists for at least tens of myr. using effective temperaturesdetermined from the spectral types of our objects along with luminositiesderived from near and mid-infrared photometry, we place our objects on the h-rdiagram and overlay evolutionary models to estimate the masses and ages of ouryoung sources. three of our sources have inferred ages (t ~= 10-30 myr)significantly older than the median stellar age of their parent clouds (1-3myr). for these three objects, we derive masses ~3 times greater than expectedfor 1-3 myr old brown dwarfs with the bolometric luminosities of our sources.the large discrepancies in the inferred masses and ages determined using twoseparate, yet reasonable methods, emphasize the need for caution when derivingor exploiting brown dwarf mass and age estimates.

astro-ph;0611697	discovery of a high proper motion l dwarf binary: 2mass  j15200224-4422419ab	we report the discovery of the wide l1.5+l4.5 binary 2massj15200224-4422419ab, identified during spectroscopic followup of high propermotion sources selected from the two micron all sky survey. this source wasindependently identified by kendall et al. in the supercosmos sky survey.resolved jhk photometry and low resolution near-infrared spectroscopydemonstrate that this system is composed of two well-separated (1"174+/-0"016)l dwarfs. component classifications are derived using both spectral ratios andcomparison to near-infrared spectra of previously classified field l dwarfs.physical association for the pair is deduced from the large (mu = 0"73+/-0"03/yr) common proper motion of the components and their similarspectrophotometric distances (19+/-2 pc). the projected separation of thebinary, 22+/-2 au, is consistent with maximum separation/total system masstrends for very low mass binaries. the 2mass j1520-4422 system exhibits bothlarge tangential (66+/-7 km/s) and radial velocities (-70+/-18 km/s), and itsmotion in the local standard of rest suggests that it is an old member of thegalactic disk population. this system joins a growing list of well-separated(&gt;0"5), very low mass binaries, and is an excellent target for resolved opticalspectroscopy to constrain its age as well as trace activity/rotation trendsnear the hydrogen-burning limit.

astro-ph;0701111	the late-t dwarf companion to the exoplanet host star hd 3651: a new  benchmark for gravity and metallicity effects in ultracool spectra	(abridged) we present near-ir photometry and spectroscopy of hd 3651b, thelow-luminosity, wide-separation (480 au) companion to the k0v exoplanet hoststar hd 3651a. we find a spectral type of t7.5+/-0.5, a temperature of 780-840k, and a mass of 40-72 mjup; its bolometric luminosity and effectivetemperature are among the lowest measured for any brown dwarf. we estimate anage of 3-12 gyr for the primary star hd 3651a and find that it is ~3x olderthan the k4v star gl 570a (1-5 gyr), the host star of the t7.5 dwarf gl 570d.hd 3651b belongs to the rare class of substellar objects that are companions tomain-sequence stars and thus provides a new benchmark for studying verylow-temperature objects. given their similar temperatures (within ~30 k) andmetallicities (within ~0.1 dex) but different ages, a comparison of hd 3651band gl 570d allows us to examine gravity-sensitive diagnostics in ultracoolspectra. we find that the expected signature of hd 3651b's higher surfacegravity due to its older age, namely a suppressed k-band flux relative to gl570d, is not seen. instead, the k-band flux of hd 3651b is enhanced compared togl 570d, indicative of a younger age. thus, the relative ages derived frominterpretation of t dwarf spectra and from stellar activity indicators appearto be in discord. one likely explanation is that the k-band fluxes are alsovery sensitive to metallicity differences. metallicity variations may be asimportant as surface gravity variations in causing spectral differences amongfield late-t dwarfs.

astro-ph;9506030	high resolution infrared imaging of fsc10214+4724: evidence for  gravitational lensing	we present near--infrared observations of the ultraluminous high-redshift(z=2.286) iras source fsc 10214+4724 obtained in 0.''4 seeing at the w. m. kecktelescope. these observations show that fsc 10214+4724 consists of a highlysymmetric circular arc centered on a second weaker source. the arc has anangular extent of about 140 degrees and is probably unresolved in thetransverse direction. this morphology constitutes compelling prima facieevidence for a gravitationally lensed system. our images also contain evidencefor the faint counter image predicted by the lens hypothesis. the morphology offsc 10214+4724 can be explained in terms of a gravitationally lensed backgroundsource if the object at the center of curvature of the arc is an l* galaxy at z~ 0.4. if fsc 10214+4724 is lensed then there is significant magnification andits luminosity has been overestimated by a large factor. our results suggestfsc~10214+4724 is not a uniquely luminous object but ranks amo ng the mostpowerful quasars and ultraluminous iras galaxies.

0810.1054	fundamental properties of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs	precise measurements of the fundamental properties of low-mass stars andbrown dwarfs are key to understanding the physics underlying their formationand evolution. while there has been great progress over the last decade instudying the bulk spectrophotometric properties of low-mass objects, directdetermination of their masses, radii, and temperatures have been very sparse.thus, theoretical predictions of low-mass evolution and ultracool atmospheresremain to be rigorously tested. the situation is alarming given that suchmodels are widely used, from the determination of the low-mass end of theinitial mass function to the characterization of exoplanets. an increasingnumber of mass, radius, and age determinations are placing critical constraintson the physics of low-mass objects. a wide variety of approaches are beingpursued, including eclipsing binary studies, astrometric-spectroscopic orbitalsolutions, interferometry, and characterization of benchmark systems. inparallel, many more systems suitable for concerted study are now being found,thanks to new capabilities spanning both the very widest (all-sky surveys) andvery narrowest (diffraction-limited adaptive optics) areas of the sky. thiscool stars 15 splinter session highlighted the current successes andlimitations of this rapidly growing area of precision astrophysics.
