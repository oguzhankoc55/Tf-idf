0907.2116	sbs 0335-052e+w: deep vlt/fors+uves spectroscopy of the pair of the  lowest-metallicity blue compact dwarf galaxies	(abridged) we present deep archival vlt/fors1+uves spectroscopic observationsof the system of two blue compact dwarf (bcd) galaxies sbs 0335-052e and sbs0335-052w. our aim is to derive element abundances in different hii regions ofthis unique system of galaxies and to study spatial abundance variations. wedetermine abundances of helium, nitrogen, oxygen, neon, sulfur, chlorine, argonand iron. the oxygen abundance in the brighter eastern galaxy varies in therange 7.11 to 7.32 in different hii regions supporting previous findings andsuggesting the presence of oxygen abundance variations on spatial scales of~1-2 kpc. the oxygen abundance in the brightest region no.1 of sbs 0335-052w is7.22+/-0.07, consistent with previous determinations.three other hii regionsare much more metal-poor with an unprecedently low oxygen abundance of12+logo/h=7.01+/-0.07 (region no.2), 6.98+/-0.06 (region no.3), and 6.86+/-0.14(region no.4). these are the lowest oxygen abundances ever derived inemission-line galaxies. helium abundances derived for the brightest hii regionsof both galaxies are mutually consistent. we derive weighted mean he massfractions of 0.2485+/-0.0012 and 0.2514+/-0.0012 for two different sets of heiemissivities. the n/o abundance ratio in both galaxies is slightly higher thanthat derived for other bcds with 12+logo/h&lt;7.6. this implies that the n/o inextremely metal-deficient galaxies could increase with decreasing metallicity.

0908.2535	near-infrared spectroscopy of the blue compact dwarf galaxy markarian 59	we present near-infrared (nir) spectroscopic observations of the blue compactdwarf (bcd) galaxy mrk 59, obtained with the triplespec spectrograph mounted onthe 3.5m apo telescope. the nir spectrum of mrk 59, which covers the 0.90 -2.40 micron wavelength range, shows atomic hydrogen, molecular hydrogen,helium, sulfur and iron emission lines. the nir data have been supplemented bya sdss optical spectrum. we found extinction in the bcd to be low [a(v)=0.24mag] and to be the same in both the optical and nir ranges. the nir light doesnot reveal hidden star formation. the h2 emission comes from dense clumps andthe h2 vibrational emission line intensities can be accounted for by photonexcitation. no shock excitation is needed. a cloudy photoinization model of mrk59 reproduces well the observed optical and nir emission line fluxes. there isno need to invoke sources of ionization other than stellar radiation.the [feii]1.257 and 1.643 micron emission lines, often used as supernova shock indicatorsin low-excitation high-metallicity starburst galaxies, cannot play such a rolein high-excitation low-metallicity hii regions such as mrk 59.

1005.1844	tol 2240-384 - a new low-metallicity agn candidate	active galactic nuclei (agns) have typically been discovered in massivegalaxies of high metallicity. we attempt to increase the number of agncandidates in low metallicity galaxies. we present vlt/uves and archivalvlt/fors1 spectroscopic and ntt/susi2 photometric observations of thelow-metallicity emission-line galaxy tol 2240-384 and perform a detailed studyof its morphology, chemical composition, and emission-line profiles. wedetermine abundances of nitrogen, o, ne, s, cl, ar, and fe by analyzing thefluxes of narrow components of the emission lines using empirical methods. weverify with a photoionisation model that the physics of the narrow-linecomponent gas is similar to that in common metal-poor galaxies. imagedeconvolution reveals two high-surface brightness regions in tol 2240-384separated by 2.4 kpc.the brightest southwestern region is surrounded by intenseionised gas emission on a spatial scale of ~5 kpc. the profiles of the strongemission lines in the uves spectrum are asymmetric and all these lines apartfrom halpha and hbeta can be fitted by two gaussians of fwhm ~75-92 km/sseparated by ~80 km/s implying that there are two regions of ionised gasemitting narrow lines. the shapes of the halpha and hbeta lines are morecomplex. in particular, the halpha emission line consists of two broadcomponents of fwhm ~700 km/s and 2300 km/s, in addition to narrow components oftwo regions revealed from profiles of other lines. the extraordinarily highluminosity of the broad halpha line of 3x10e41 erg/s cannot be accounted for bymassive stars at different stages of their evolution. the broad halpha emissionpersists over a period of 7 years, which excludes supernovae as a poweringmechanism of this emission. this emission most likely arises from an accretiondisc around a black hole of mass ~10e7 msun.

1104.0817	near-infrared spectroscopy of five blue compact dwarf galaxies: ii zw  40, mrk 71, mrk 930, mrk 996 and sbs 0335-052e	we present near-infrared (nir) spectroscopic observations of five bluecompact dwarf (bcd) galaxies, ii zw 40, mrk 71, mrk 930, mrk 996 and sbs0335-052e. the nir spectra which cover the 0.90 micron - 2.40 micron wavelengthrange, show hydrogen, molecular hydrogen, helium, sulfur and iron emissionlines. the nir data for all bcds have been supplemented by optical spectra. wefound the extinction coefficient in all bcds to be very similar in both theoptical and nir ranges. the nir hydrogen emission lines do not reveal more starformation than seen in the optical. the same conclusion is reached from spitzerdata concerning the mir emission lines. this implies that emission-line spectraof low-metallicity bcds in the ~ 0.36 - 25 micron wavelength range are emittedby relatively transparent ionized gas. the large extinction derived from themir continuum emission in some bcds implies that the latter arises not from thevisible h ii regions themselves, but from locations outside these h ii regions.the h2 emission line fluxes can be accounted for by fluorescence. cloudystellar photoinization models of all bcds reproduce well the fluxes of most ofthe observed optical and nir emission lines, except in mrk 930 where shockionization is needed to account for the [fe ii] emission lines. however, somecontribution of shock ionization at the level of &lt; 10% that of stellarionization is required to reproduce the observed fluxes of high ionizationspecies, such as he ii 0.469 micron in the optical range and [o iv] 25.89micron in the mir range.

0709.3643	broad line emission in low-metallicity blue compact dwarf galaxies:  evidence for stellar wind, supernova and possible agn activity	we present spectra of a large sample of low-metallicity blue compact dwarfgalaxies which exhibit broad components in their strong emission lines, mainlyin hbeta, [o iii]4959, 5007 and halpha. twenty-three spectra have been obtainedwith the mmt, 14 of which show broad emission. the remaining 21 spectra withbroad emission have been selected from the data release 5 of the sloan digitalsky survey. the most plausible origin of broad line emission is the evolutionof massive stars and their interaction with the circumstellar and interstellarmedium. the broad emission with the lowest h$\alpha$ luminosities (10^36 -10^39 erg/s) is likely produced in circumstellar envelopes around hot ofp/wn9and/or lbv stars. the broad emission with the highest halpha luminosities(10^40 - 10^42 erg/s) probably arises from type iip or type iin supernovae(sne). it can also come from active galactic nuclei (agn) containingintermediate-mass black holes, although we find no strong evidence for hardnon-thermal radiation in our sample galaxies. the oxygen abundance in the hostgalaxies with sn candidates is low and varies in the range 12 + log o/h = 7.36- 8.31. however, type iin sn / agn candidates are found only in galaxies with12 + log o/h &lt; 7.99. spectroscopic monitoring of these type iin sn / agncandidates over a time scale of several years is necessary to distinguishbetween the two possibilities.

1108.4309	vlt/x-shooter observations of the low-metallicity blue compact dwarf  galaxy phl 293b including a luminous blue variable star	(abridged) we present vlt/x-shooter spectroscopic observations in thewavelength range 3000-23000a of the extremely metal-deficient blue compactdwarf (bcd) galaxy phl 293b containing a luminous blue variable (lbv) star. wedetermine abundances of n, o, ne, s, ar, and fe and study the properties of thelbv from the fluxes and widths of broad emission lines. we derive aninterstellar oxygen abundance of 12+log o/h = 7.71+/-0.02, which is inagreement with previous determinations. the observed fluxes of narrow balmer,paschen and brackett hydrogen lines correspond to the theoretical recombinationvalues after correction for extinction with a single value c(hbeta) = 0.225.this implies that the star-forming region observed in the optical range is theonly source of ionisation and there is no additional source of ionisation thatis seen in the nir range but is hidden in the optical range. for the lbv starin phl 293b we find broad emission with p cygni profiles in several balmerhydrogen emission lines and for the first time in several paschen hydrogenlines and in several hei emission lines, implying temporal evolution of the lbvon a time scale of 8 years. the halpha luminosity of the lbv star is by oneorder of magnitude higher than the one obtained for the lbv star in ngc2363=mrk 71 which has a slightly higher metallicity 12+logo/h = 7.87. theterminal velocity of the stellar wind in the low-metallicity lbv of phl293b ishigh, ~800 km/s, and is comparable to that seen in spectra of someextragalactic lbvs during outbursts. we find that the averaged terminalvelocities derived from the paschen and hei emission lines are by some ~40-60km/s lower than those derived from the balmer emission lines. this probablyindicates the presence of the wind accelerating outward.

1111.1392	vlt spectroscopy of low-metallicity emission-line galaxies: abundance  patterns and abundance discrepancies	(abridged) we present deep spectroscopy of a large sample of low-metallicityemission-line galaxies. the main goal of this study is to derive elementabundances in these low-metallicity galaxies. we analyze 121 vlt spectra of hiiregions in 46 low-metallicity emission-line galaxies. 83 of these spectra arearchival vlt/fors1+uves spectra of hii regions in 31 low-metallicityemission-line galaxies that are studied for the first time with standard directmethods to determine the electron temperatures, the electron number densities,and the chemical abundances. the oxygen abundance of the sample lies in therange 12 + log o/h = 7.2-8.4. the ne/o ratio increases with increasing oxygenabundance. the fe/o ratio decreases from roughly solar at the lowestmetallicities to about one tenth of solar, indicating that the degree ofdepletion of iron into dust grains depends on metallicity. the n/o ratio inextremely low-metallicity galaxies with 12+logo/h&lt;7.5 shows a slight increasewith decreasing oxygen abundance. we present the first empirical relationbetween the electron temperature derived from [siii]6312/9069 or [nii]5755/6583and the one derived from [oiii]4363/(4959+5007) in low-metallicity galaxies. ina number of objects, the abundances of c^++ and o^++ could be derived fromrecombination lines. our study confirms the discrepancy between abundancesfound from recombination lines (rls) and collisionally excited lines (cels) andthat c/o increases with o/h.

1408.4623	dust emission in star-forming dwarf galaxies: general properties and the  nature of the sub-mm excess	we studied the global characteristics of dust emission in a large sample ofemission-line star-forming galaxies. the sample consists of two subsamples. onesubsample (sdss sample) includes ~4000 compact star-forming galaxies from thesdss, which were also detected in all four bands at 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 mum ofthe wise all-sky survey. the second subsample (herschel sample) is a sample of28 compact star-forming galaxies observed with herschel in the fir range. dataof the herschel sample were supplemented by the photometric data from thespitzer observations, galex, sdss, wise, 2mass, nvss, and first surveys, aswell as optical and spitzer spectra and data in sub-mm and radio ranges. it isfound that warm dust luminosities of galaxies from the sdss sample and cold andwarm dust luminosities of galaxies from the herschel sample are stronglycorrelated with hbeta luminosities, which implies that one of the main sourcesof dust heating in star-forming galaxies is ionising uv radiation of youngstars. using the relation between warm and cold dust masses for estimating thetotal dust mass in star-forming galaxies with an accuracy better than ~0.5 dexis proposed. on the other hand, it is shown for both samples that dusttemperatures do not depend on the metallicities. the dust-to-neutral gas massratio strongly declines with decreasing metallicity, similar to that found inother studies of local emission-line galaxies, high-redshift grb hosts, anddlas. on the other hand, the dust-to-ionised gas mass ratio is about onehundred times as high implying that most of dust is located in the neutral gas.it is found that thermal free-free emission of ionised gas in compactstar-forming galaxies might be responsible for the sub-mm emission excess. thiseffect is stronger in galaxies with lower metallicities and is also positivelyaffected by an increased star-formation rate.

1408.6953	a new determination of the primordial he abundance using the hei 10830a  emission line: cosmological implications	we present near-infrared spectroscopic observations of the high-intensity hei10830 emission line in 45 low-metallicity hii regions. we combined these nirdata with spectroscopic data in the optical range to derive the primordial heabundance. the use of the hei 10830a line, the intensity of which is verysensitive to the density of the hii region, greatly improves the determinationof the physical conditions in the he^+ zone. this results in a considerablytighter y - o/h linear regression compared to all previous studies. weextracted a final sample of 28 hii regions with hbeta equivalent widthew(hbeta)&gt;150a, excitation parameter o^2+/o&gt;0.8, and with helium mass fractiony derived with an accuracy better than 3%. with this final sample we derived aprimordial he mass fraction yp = 0.2551+/-0.0022. the derived value of yp ishigher than the one predicted by the standard big bang nucleosynthesis (sbbn)model. using our derived yp together with d/h = (2.53+/-0.04)x10^-5, and thechi^2 technique, we found that the best agreement between these light elementabundances is achieved in a cosmological model with a baryon mass densityomega_b h^2 = 0.0240+/-0.0017 (68% cl), +/-0.0028 (95.4% cl), +/-0.0034 (99%cl) and an effective number of neutrino species neff = 3.58+/-0.25 (68% cl),+/-0.40 (95.4% cl), +/-0.50 (99% cl). a non-standard value of neff is preferredat the 99% cl, implying the possible existence of additional types of neutrinospecies.

1505.03701	new candidates for extremely metal-poor emission-line galaxies in the  sdss/boss dr10	we present a spectroscopic study of eight extremely low-metallicity candidateemission-line galaxies with oxygen abundances possibly below 12 +log o/h =7.35. these galaxies were selected from data release 10 of the sloan digitalsky survey/baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (sdss/boss dr10). we willcall these extremely metal-deficient galaxies xmd galaxies. the electrontemperature-sensitive emission line [o~{\sc iii}] $\lambda$4363 is detected inthree galaxies and marginally detected in two galaxies, allowing for abundancedetermination by a "direct" method. because of large uncertainties in the [o{\sc iii}]$\lambda$4363\aa\ line fluxes, we also calculated oxygen abundance inthese galaxies together with the remaining three galaxies using a strong-linesemi-empirical method. this method gives oxygen abundances higher than 7.35 forthree galaxies with detected [o {\sc iii}]$\lambda$4363\aa\ line and lower than7.35 for the remaining five objects of the sample. the newly-discoveredgalaxies represent excellent targets for follow-up spectroscopic observationswith the largest telescopes to improve the oxygen abundance determination andto increase the number of these very rare low-metallicity objects. the extremelocation of the most massive and luminous xmd galaxies and xmd candidates inthe stellar mass-metallicity diagram implies that these galaxies may be genuineyoung objects.  with stellar masses of up to $\sim$ 10$^7$ - 10$^8$$m_{\odot}$, the galaxiesare not chemically enriched and strongly deviate to lower metallicity ascompared to the relation obtained for a large sample of low-redshift,star-forming galaxies.

1512.06191	near-infrared spectroscopy of a large sample of low-metallicity blue  compact dwarf galaxies	we present near-infrared (nir) spectroscopic observations in the wavelengthrange 0.90-2.40mum of eighteen low-metallicity blue compact dwarf (bcd)galaxies and six hii regions in spiral and interacting galaxies. hydrogen andhelium emission lines are detected in all spectra, while h2 and iron emissionlines are detected in most spectra. the nir data for all objects have beensupplemented by optical spectra. in all objects, except perhaps for the highestmetallicity ones, we find that the extinctions a(v) in the optical and nirranges are similar, implying that the nir hydrogen emission lines inlow-metallicity bcds do not reveal more star formation than seen in theoptical. we conclude that emission-line spectra of low-metallicity bcds in the0.36-2.40mum wavelength range are emitted by a relatively transparent ionizedgas. the h2 emission line fluxes can be accounted for by fluorescence in mostof the observed galaxies. we find a decrease of the h2 2.122mum emission linerelative to the brgamma line with increasing ionization parameter. thisindicates an efficient destruction of h2 by the stellar uv radiation. theintensities of the [feii] 1.257mum and 1.644mum emission lines in the spectraof all galaxies, but one, are consistent with the predictions of cloudy stellarphotoinization models. there is thus no need to invoke shock excitation forthese lines, and they are not necessarily shock indicators in low-metallicityhigh-excitation bcds. the intensity of the hei 2.058mum emission line is lowerin high-excitation bcds with lower neutral gas column densities and higherturbulent motions.

astro-ph;0007130	the cometary blue compact dwarf galaxies mkn 59 and mkn 71: clues to  dwarf galaxy evolution?	"cometary" blue compact dwarf galaxies (ii,c bcds) are characterized byoff-center starbursts close to the end of an elongated dwarf irregular(di)-like host galaxy. this may either represent randomly enhanced star-formingactivity of a di, or may be caused by a set of special properties of suchsystems or their environment. for a first investigation of this issue, weanalyse the nearby ii,c bcds markarian 59 and markarian 71. using deepground-based spectrophotometric data and hst images, we derive physicalproperties, structure and ages of the starburst regions and the underlyingstellar host galaxies. the metallicities show small scatter in the vicinity ofthe star-forming regions and along the major axis of mrk 59 which suggestseffective mixing of heavy elements on kpc scales. the surface brightnessprofiles of the underlying host galaxies in either ii,c bcd show an exponentialdecay with a central surface brightness and scale length that are intermediatebetween typical ie/ne bcds and dis. spectral population synthesis models incombination with colour magnitude diagrams and colour profiles yield mostlikely formation ages of ~2 gyr for the host galaxies in both ii,c bcds, withupper limits of ~4 gyr for mrk 59 and ~3 gyr for mrk 71, i.e. significantlylower than the typical age of several gyr derived for the host galaxies ofie/ne bcds. these findings raise the question whether ii,c systems form adistinct class within bcds with respect to the age and structure of theirhosts, or whether they represent an evolutionary stage connecting young i0 bcdsand "classical" ie/ne bcds. properties of analogous objects studied in thelocal universe and at medium redshifts provide some support for thisevolutionary hypothesis.

astro-ph;0011227	an imaging and spectroscopic study of the very metal-deficient blue  compact dwarf galaxy tol 1214--277	we present a spectrophotometric study based on vlt/fors i observations of oneof the most metal-deficient blue compact dwarf (bcd) galaxies known, tol1214-277 (z ~ zsun/25). the data show that roughly half of the total luminosityof the bcd originates from a bright and compact starburst region located at thenortheastern tip of a faint dwarf galaxy with cometary appearance. thestarburst has ignited less than 4 myr ago and its emission is powered byseveral thousands o7v stars and ~ 170 late-type nitrogen wolf-rayet starslocated within a compact region with &lt; 500 pc in diameter. for the first timein a bcd, a relatively strong [fe v] 4227 emission line is seen which togetherwith intense he ii 4686 emission indicates the presence of a very hardradiation field in tol 1214-277. we argue that this extraordinarily hardradiation originates from both wolf--rayet stars and radiative shocks in thestarburst region. the structural properties of the low-surface-brightness (lsb)component underlying the starburst have been investigated by means of surfacephotometry down to 28 b mag/sq.arcsec. we find that, for a surface brightnesslevel fainter than ~ 24.5 b mag/sq.arcsec, an exponential fitting law providesan adequate approximation to its radial intensity distribution. the broad-bandcolors in the outskirts of the lsb component of tol 1214-277 are nearlyconstant and are consistent with an age below one gyr. this conclusion issupported by the comparison of the observed spectral energy distribution (sed)of the lsb host with theoretical seds.

astro-ph;0112348	the primordial helium-4 abundance determination: systematic effects	by extrapolating to o/h = n/h = 0 the empirical correlations y-o/h and y-n/hdefined by a relatively large sample of ~ 45 blue compact dwarfs (bcds), wehave obtained a primordial 4helium mass fraction yp= 0.2443+/-0.0015 with dy/dz= 2.4+/-1.0. this result is in excellent agreement with the average yp=0.2452+/-0.0015 determined in the two most metal-deficient bcds known, i zw 18(zsun/50) and sbs 0335-052 (zsun/41), where the correction for he production issmallest. the quoted error (1sigma) of &lt; 1% is statistical and does not includesystematic effects. we examine various systematic effects including collisionalexcitation of hydrogen lines, ionization structure and temperature fluctuationeffects, and underlying stellar hei absorption, and conclude that combining allsystematic effects, our yp may be underestimated by ~ 2-4%. taken at facevalue, our yp implies a baryon-to-photon number ratio eta = 4.7x10^-10 and abaryon mass fraction omega_b h^2_{100} = 0.017+/-0.005 (2sigma), consistentwith the values obtained from deuterium and cosmic microwave backgroundmeasurements. correcting yp upward by 2-4% would make the agreement evenbetter.

astro-ph;0207314	the blue compact dwarf galaxy i zw 18: a comparative study of its  low-surface-brightness component	(abridged): using hst and ground-based optical and nir imaging data, weinvestigate whether the blue compact dwarf (bcd) galaxy i zw 18 possesses anextended low-surface-brightness (lsb) old stellar population underlying itsstar-forming (sf) regions. we show that the exponential intensity decreaseobserved in the filamentary lsb envelope of the bcd out to 18 arcsec (1.3 kpcat a distance of 15 mpc) is not due to an evolved stellar disc, but rather dueto extended ionized gas emission. broad-band images reveal, after subtractionof nebular line emission, a compact stellar lsb component extending slightlybeyond the sf regions. this stellar host, being blue over a radius range of 5exponential scale lengths and showing little colour contrast to the sfcomponent, differs strikingly from the red lsb host of standard bcds. thisfact, in connection with the blue colors of component i zw 18 c, suggests thatmost of the stellar mass in i zw 18 has formed within the last 0.5 gyr.furthermore, we show that the exponential intensity fall-off in the filamentaryionized envelope of i zw 18 is not particular to this system but a commonproperty of the ionized halo of many sf dwarf galaxies on galactocentricdistances of several kpc. in the absence of an appreciable underlying stellarbackground, extended ionized gas emission dominates in the periphery of i zw18, mimicking an exponential stellar disc on optical surface brightnessprofiles.

astro-ph;0209050	modeling the emission line sequence of h ii galaxies	using a sample of unprecedented size (about 400 objects) of h ii galaxies inwhich the oxygen abundances have been obtained using the temperature derivedfrom the [oiii] 4363/5007 line ratio, we confirm that the h ii galaxies form avery narrow sequence in many diagrams relating line ratios and hbeta equivalentwidth. we divide our sample in three metallicity bins, each of which iscompared with sequences of photoionization models for evolving starbursts withcorresponding metallicity. our aim is to find under what conditions atheoretical sequence can reproduce all the observed trends. taking into accountthe presence of an older, non-ionizing stellar population, for whichindependent indications exist, we find that the simple model of an adiabaticexpanding bubble reproduces the observational diagrams very well if account istaken of an aperture correction and the covering factor is assumed to decreasewith time exponentially with an e-folding time of 3 myr. we find that the he ii4686 nebular line emission occurs too frequently and in too wide a range ofew(hbeta) to be attributable to either the hard radiation field from wolf-rayetstars or the x-rays produced by the latest stellar generation. assuming thatthe he ii 4686 line is due to photoionization by a hot plasma at a temperatureof 10^6 k, a total x-ray luminosity of 10^40 - 4x10^40 erg/s is required for atleast half of the sources. we find evidence for self-enrichment in nitrogen ona time scale of several myr, and argue for a possible self-enrichment in oxygenas well.

astro-ph;0310421	systematic effects and a new determination of the primordial abundance  of 4he and dy/dz from observations of blue compact galaxies	we use spectroscopic observations of a sample of 82 hii regions in 76 bluecompact galaxies to determine the primordial helium abundance yp and the slopedy/dz from the y-o/h linear regression. to improve the accuracy of the dy/dzmeasurement, we have included new spectrophotometric observations of 33 hiiregions which span a large metallicity range, with oxygen abundance 12+log(o/h)varying between 7.43 and 8.30 (zsun/30&lt;z&lt;zsun/4). for a subsample of 7 hiiregions, we derive the he mass fraction taking into account known systematiceffects, including collisional and fluorescent enhancements of hei emissionlines, collisional excitation of hydrogen emission, underlying stellar heiabsorption and the difference between the temperatures te(heii) in the he^+zone and te(oiii) derived from the collisionally excited [oiii] lines. we findthat the net result of all the systematic effects combined is small, changingthe he mass fraction by less than 0.6%. by extrapolating the y vs. o/h linearregression to o/h=0 for 7 hii regions of this subsample, we obtainyp=0.2421+/-0.0021 and dy/do=5.7+/-1.8, which corresponds to dy/dz=3.7+/-1.2,assuming the oxygen mass fraction to be o=0.66z. in the framework of thestandard big bang nucleosynthesis theory, this yp corresponds to omega_b h^2 =0.012^+0.003_-0.002, where h is the hubble constant in units of 100 km/s/mpc.this is smaller at the 2sigma level than the value obtained from recentdeuterium abundance and microwave background radiation measurements. the linearregression slope dy/do=4.3+/-0.7 (corresponding to dy/dz=2.8+/-0.5) for thewhole sample of 82 hii regions is similar to that derived for the subsample of7 hii regions, although it has a considerably smaller uncertainty.

0809.1217	extremely metal-poor star-forming galaxies. new detections and general  morphological and photometric properties	(abridged) we present long-slit spectroscopy with the 3.6m eso telescope ofeight hii regions in seven star-forming (sf) dwarf galaxies, discovered in sdssdr4 and 6dfgrs. in addition, we use sdss imaging data to study the photometricstructure of the sample galaxies. from the 3.6m telescope spectra, we determinethe oxygen abundance of these systems to be 7.3&lt;12+log(o/h)&lt;7.6, placing themamong the most metal-poor sf galaxies ever discovered. our photometric analysisreveals a moderately blue, stellar host galaxy in all sample galaxies. thedetection of a stellar host in all galaxies studied here and all previouslystudied extremely metal-deficient sf galaxies implies that they are unlikely tobe forming their first generation of stars. with regard to the structuralproperties of their host galaxy, we demonstrate that these systems areindistinguishable from blue compact dwarf (bcd) galaxies. however, in contrastto the majority (&gt;90%) of bcds that are characterised by red elliptical hostgalaxies, extremely metal-poor sf dwarfs (hereafter xbcds) reveal moderatelyblue and irregular hosts. this is consistent with a young evolutionary statusand in the framework of standard star formation histories implies that severalxbcds formed most of their stellar mass in the past 2 gyr. a large fraction ofxbcds reveal a cometary morphology due to the presence of intense sf activityat one edge of an elongated host galaxy with a gradually decreasing surfacebrightness towards its antipodal end.

astro-ph;0610405	the spitzer view of low-metallicity star formation: i. haro 3	we present spitzer observations of the blue compact dwarf galaxy (bcd) haro3, with an oxygen abundance of 12+log(o/h)=8.32. these data are part of alarger study of star formation and dust in low-metallicity environments.the irsspectrum of haro 3 shows strong narrow polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah)emission, with high equivalent widths. gaseous nebular fine-structure lines arealso seen. despite the absence of optical high-excitation lines, a fainthigh-ionization [o iv] line at 25.89 micron indicates the presence of radiationas hard as 54.9 ev. a cloudy model suggests that the mir lines originate in tworegions: a low-extinction optically-emitting region, and an optically invisibleone with much higher extinction. the morphology of haro 3 changes withwavelength. irac 4.5 micron traces extended stellar photospheric emission fromthe body of the galaxy and hot dust continuum coming mainly from star-formingregions; 8 micron probes extended pah emission coming mainly from the generalism; mips 24 and 70 micron images map compact small-grain warm dust emissionassociated with active star formation, and 160 micron reflects cooler extendeddust associated with older stellar populations. we have derived theoptical-to-radio spectral energy distribution (sed) of the brighteststar-forming region a in haro 3. the best-fit dusty model of the sed gives atotal luminosity of 2.8e9 lsun and a mass of 2.8e6 msun for the ionizingclusters. we infer an extinction a(v)&lt;3, intermediate between the opticala(v)~0.5 and the radio a(v)~8, consistent with the picture that longerwavelength observations probe more deeply into star-forming regions.

astro-ph;0701032	balmer jump temperature determination in a large sample of  low-metallicity h ii regions	aims. continuing the systematic determination of the electron temperature ofh ii regions using the balmer and/or paschen discontinuities by guseva et al.(2006) we focus here on 3.6m eso telescope observations of a large new sampleof 69 h ii regions in 45 blue compact dwarf (bcd) galaxies. this data set spansa wide range in metallicity (zsun/60&lt;z&lt;zsun/3) and, combined with the sample of47 h ii regions from guseva et al.

astro-ph;0702072	the primordial abundance of 4he: a self-consistent empirical analysis of  systematic effects in a large sample of low-metallicity hii regions	we determine the primordial helium mass fraction yp using 93 spectra of 86low-metallicity extragalactic hii regions. this sample constitutes the largestand most homogeneous high-quality data sets in existence for the determinationof yp. for comparison and to improve the statistics in our investigation ofsystematic effects affecting the yp determination, we have also considered asample of 271 low-metallicity hii regions selected from the dr5 of the sdss.although this larger sample shows more scatter, it gives results that areconsistent at the 2sigma level with our original sample. we have consideredknown systematic effects which may affect the 4he abundance determination. theyinclude different sets of hei line emissivities and reddening laws, collisionaland fluorescent enhancements of hei recombination lines, underlying hei stellarabsorption lines, collisional excitation of hydrogen lines, temperature andionization structure of the hii region, and deviation of hei and h emissionline intensities from case b. however, the most likely value of yp depends onthe adopted set of hei line emissivities. using monte carlo methods to solvesimultaneously the above systematic effects we find a primordial helium massfraction yp = 0.2472+/-0.0012 when using the hei emissivities from benjamin etal. (1999, 2002) and 0.2516+/-0.0011 when using those from porter et al.(2005). the first value agrees well with the value given by sbbn theory, whilethe value obtained with likely more accurate emissivities of porter et al.(2005) is higher at the 2sigma level. this latter value, if confirmed, wouldimply slight deviations from sbbn.

0809.3077	luminous blue variable stars in the two extremely metal-deficient blue  compact dwarf galaxies ddo 68 and phl 293b	we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of two luminous bluevariable (lbv) stars in two extremely metal-deficient blue compact dwarf (bcd)galaxies, ddo 68 with 12+logo/h = 7.15 and phl 293b with 12+logo/h = 7.72.these two bcds are the lowest-metallicity galaxies where lbv stars have beendetected, allowing to study the lbv phenomenon in the extremely low metallicityregime, and shedding light of the evolution of the first generation of massivestars born from primordial gas. we find that the strong outburst of the lbvstar in ddo 68 occurred sometime between february 2007 and january 2008. wehave compared the properties of the broad line emission in low-metallicity lbvswith those in higher metallicity lbvs. we find that, for the lbv star in ddo68, broad emission with a p cygni profile is seen in both h and he i emissionlines. on the other hand, for the lbv star in phl 293b, p cygni profiles aredetected only in h lines. for both lbvs, no heavy element emission line such asfe ii was detected. the halpha luminosities of lbv stars in both galaxies arecomparable to the one obtained for the lbv star in ngc 2363 (mrk 71) which hasa higher metallicity 12+logo/h = 7.89. on the other hand, the terminalvelocities of the stellar winds in both low-metallicity lbvs are high, ~800km/s, a factor of ~4 higher than the terminal velocities of the winds inhigh-metallicity lbvs. this suggests that stellar winds at low metallicity aredriven by a different mechanism than the one operating in high-metallicitywinds.

0809.3082	the spitzer view of low-metallicity star formation: ii. mrk 996, a blue  compact dwarf galaxy with an extremely dense nucleus	(abridged) we present new spitzer, ukirt and mmt observations of the bluecompact dwarf galaxy (bcd) mrk 996, with an oxygen abundance of12+log(o/h)=8.0. this galaxy has the peculiarity of possessing anextraordinarily dense nuclear star-forming region, with a central density of~10^6 cm^{-3}. the nuclear region of mrk 996 is characterized by severalunusual properties: a very red color j-k = 1.8, broad and narrow emission-linecomponents, and ionizing radiation as hard as 54.9 ev, as implied by thepresence of the oiv 25.89 micron line. the nucleus is located within anexponential disk with colors consistent with a single stellar population of age&gt;1 gyr. the infrared morphology of mrk 996 changes with wavelength. the irsspectrum shows strong narrow polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) emission,with narrow line widths and equivalent widths that are high for the metallicityof mrk 996. gaseous nebular fine-structure lines are also seen. a cloudy modelrequires that they originate in two distinct hii regions: a very dense hiiregion of radius ~580 pc with densities declining from ~10^6 at the center to afew hundreds cm^{-3} at the outer radius, where most of the optical linesarise; and a hii region with a density of ~300 cm^{-3} that is hidden in theoptical but seen in the mir. we suggest that the infrared lines arise mainly inthe optically obscured hii region while they are strongly suppressed bycollisional deexcitation in the optically visible one. the hard ionizingradiation needed to account for the oiv 25.89 micron line is most likely due tofast radiative shocks propagating in an interstellar medium. a hiddenpopulation of wolf-rayet stars of type wne-w or a hidden agn as sources of hardionizing radiation are less likely possibilities.

astro-ph;9811387	heavy element abundances in blue compact galaxies	we present high-quality ground-based spectroscopic observations of 54supergiant h ii regions in 50 low-metallicity blue compact galaxies with oxygenabundances 12 + log o/h between 7.1 and 8.3. we use the data to determineabundances for the elements n, o, ne, s, ar and fe. we also analyze hubblespace telescope (hst) faint object spectrograph archival spectra of 10supergiant h ii regions to derive c and si abundances in a subsample of 7 bcgs.the main result of the present study is that none of the heavyelement-to-oxygen abundance ratios studied here (c/o, n/o, ne/o, si/o, s/o,ar/o, fe/o) depend on oxygen abundance for bcgs with 12 + log o/h &lt; 7.6 (z &lt;zsun/20). this constancy implies that all these heavy elements have a primaryorigin and are produced by the same massive (m &gt; 10msun) stars responsible foro production. the dispersion of the c/o and n/o ratios in these galaxies isfound to be remarkably small, being only +/-0.03 dex and +/-0.02 dexrespectively. this very small dispersion is strong evidence against anytime-delayed production of c and primary n in the lowest-metallicity bcgs(secondary n production is negligible at these low metallicities). the absenceof a time-delayed production of c and n is consistent with the scenario thatgalaxies with 12 + log o/h &lt; 7.6 are undergoing now their first burst of starformation, and that they are therefore young, with ages not exceeding 40 myr.if very low metallicities bcgs are indeed young, this would argue against thecommonly held belief that c and n are produced by intermediate-mass (3msun &lt; m&lt; 9msun) stars at very low metallicities, as these stars would not have yetcompleted their evolution in these lowest metallicity galaxies.

astro-ph;9910432	a spectroscopic study of a large sample of wolf-rayet galaxies	we analyze long-slit spectral observations of 39 wolf-rayet (wr) galaxieswith heavy element mass fraction ranging over 2 orders of magnitude, fromzsun/50 to 2zsun. nearly all galaxies in our sample show broad wr emission inthe blue region of the spectrum (the blue bump) consisting of an unresolvedblend of n iii 4640, c iii 4650, c iv 4658 and he ii 4686 emission lines. broadc iv 5808 emission (the red bump) is detected in 30 galaxies. additionally,weaker wr emission lines are identified, most often the n iii 4512 and si iii4565 lines, which have very rarely or never been seen and discussed before inwr galaxies. these emission features are characteristic of wn7-wn8 and wn9-wn11stars respectively.  we derive the numbers of early wc (wce) and late wn (wnl) stars from theluminosities of the red and blue bumps, and the number of o stars from theluminosity of the hbeta emission line. additionally, we propose a new techniquefor deriving the numbers of wnl stars from the n iii 4512 and si iii 4565emission lines. this technique is potentially more precise than the blue bumpmethod because it does not suffer from contamination of wce and early wn (wne)stars and nebular gaseous emission.  the n(wr)/n(o+wr) ratio decreases with decreasing metallicity, in agreementwith predictions of evolutionary synthesis models. the n(wc)/n(wn) ratios andthe equivalent widths of the blue bump ew(4650) and of the red bump ew(5808)derived from observations are also in satisfactory agreement with theoreticalpredictions.
