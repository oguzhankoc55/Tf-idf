0905.1973	galaxy clusters in the irac dark field ii: mid-ir sources	we present infrared luminosities, star formation rates, colors, morphologies,locations, and agn properties of 24 micron-detected sources in photometricallydetected high-redshift clusters in order to understand the impact ofenvironment on star formation and agn evolution in cluster galaxies. we usethree newly-identified z=1 clusters selected from the irac dark field; thedeepest ever mid-ir survey with accompanying, 14 band multiwavelength dataincluding deep hst imaging and deep wide-area spitzer mips 24 micron imaging.we find 90 cluster members with mips detections within two virial radii of thecluster centers, of which 17 appear to have spectral energy distributionsdominated by agn and the rest dominated by star formation. we find that 43 ofthe star forming are luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs). the majority ofsources (81%) are spirals or irregulars. a large fraction (at least 25%) showobvious signs of interactions. the mips -detected member galaxies have variedspatial distributions as compared to the mips-undetected members with one ofthe three clusters showing sf galaxies being preferentially located on thecluster outskirts, while the other 2 clusters show no such trend. both the agnfraction and the summed sfr of cluster galaxies increases from z=0 to 1, at arate that is a few times faster in clusters than over the same redshift rangein the field. cluster environment does have an effect on the evolution of bothagn fraction and sfr from redshift one to the present, but does not effect theinfrared luminosities or morphologies of the mips sample. star formationhappens in the same way regardless of environment making mips sources look thesame in the cluster and field, however the cluster environment does encourage amore rapid evolution with time as compared to the field.

0905.3825	nearby galaxies in the 2micron all sky survey i. k-band luminosity  functions	differential k-band luminosity functions (lfs) are presented for a completesample of 1613 nearby bright galaxies segregated by visible morphology. the lffor late-type spirals follows a power law that rises towards low luminositieswhereas the lfs for ellipticals, lenticulars and bulge-dominated spirals arepeaked and decline toward both higher and lower luminosities. eachmorphological type (e, s0, s0/a-sab, sb-sbc, sc-scd) contributes approximatelyequally to the overall k-band luminosity density of galaxies in the localuniverse. type averaged bulge/disk ratios are used to subtract the diskcomponent leading to the prediction that the k-band lf for bulges is bimodalwith ellipticals dominating the high luminosity peak, comprising 60% of thebulge luminosity density in the local universe with the remaining 40%contributed by lenticulars and the bulges of spirals. overall, bulgescontribute 30% of the galaxy luminosity density at k in the local universe withspiral disks making up the remainder. if bulge luminosities indicate centralblack hole masses, then our results predict that the black hole mass functionis also bimodal.

0906.0024	the spitzer deep, wide-field survey	the spitzer deep, wide-field survey (sdwfs) is a four-epoch infrared surveyof ten square degrees in the bootes field of the noao deep wide-field surveyusing the irac instrument on the spitzer space telescope. sdwfs, a cycle fourspitzer legacy project, occupies a unique position in the area-depth surveyspace defined by other spitzer surveys. the four epochs that make up sdwfspermit -- for the first time -- the selection of infrared-variable and highproper motion objects over a wide field on timescales of years. because of itslarge survey volume, sdwfs is sensitive to galaxies out to z~3 with relativelylittle impact from cosmic variance for all but the richest systems. the sdwfsdatasets will thus be especially useful for characterizing galaxy evolutionbeyond z~1.5. this paper explains the sdwfs observing strategy and dataprocessing, presents the sdwfs mosaics and source catalogs, and discusses someearly scientific findings. the publicly-released, full-depth catalogs contain6.78, 5.23, 1.20, and 0.96 x 10e5 distinct sources detected to the average5-sigma, 4" diameter, aperture-corrected limits of 19.77, 18.83, 16.50, and15.82 vega mag at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 micron, respectively. the sdwfs numbercounts and color-color distribution are consistent with other, earlier spitzersurveys. at the 6 min integration time of the sdwfs irac imaging, more than 50%of isolated first radio sources and more than 80% of on-axis xbootes sourcesare detected out to 8.0 micron. finally, we present the four highest propermotion irac-selected sources identified from the multi-epoch imaging, two ofwhich are likely field brown dwarfs of mid-t spectral class.

0909.3299	the aztec/sma interferometric imaging survey of submillimeter-selected  high-redshift galaxies	we present results from a continuing interferometric survey of high-redshiftsubmillimeter galaxies with the submillimeter array, including high-resolution(beam size ~2 arcsec) imaging of eight additional aztec 1.1mm selected sourcesin the cosmos field, for which we obtain six reliable (peak s/n&gt;5 or peak s/n&gt;4with multiwavelength counterparts within the beam) and two moderatesignificance (peak s/n&gt;4) detections. when combined with previous detections,this yields an unbiased sample of millimeter-selected smgs with completeinterferometric followup. with this sample in hand, we (1) empirically confirmthe radio-submillimeter association, (2) examine the submillimeter morphology -including the nature of submillimeter galaxies with multiple radio counterpartsand constraints on the physical scale of the far infrared - of the sample, and(3) find additional evidence for a population of extremely luminous, radio-dimsubmillimeter galaxies that peaks at higher redshift than previous,radio-selected samples. in particular, the presence of such a population ofhigh-redshift sources has important consequences for models of galaxy formation- which struggle to account for such objects even under liberal assumptions -and dust production models given the limited time since the big bang.

0909.5367	on the nature of the first galaxies selected at 350 microns	[abridged] we present constraints on the nature of the first galaxiesselected at 350 microns. the sample includes galaxies discovered in the deepestblank-field survey at 350 microns (in the bootes deep field) and also laterserendipitous detections in the lockman hole. spectral energy distributiontemplates are fit to identified counterparts, and the sample is found tocomprise ir-luminous galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;3 predominantly powered by star formation.the first spectrum of a 350-micron-selected galaxy provides an additionalconfirmation, showing prominent dust grain features typically associated withstar-forming galaxies.  compared to submillimeter galaxies selected at 850 and 1100 microns, galaxiesselected at 350 microns have a similar range of far-infrared colortemperatures. however, no 350-micron-selected sources are reliably detected at850 or 1100 microns. galaxies in our sample with redshifts 1&lt;z&lt;2 show a tightcorrelation between the far- and mid-infrared flux densities, but galaxies athigher redshifts show a large dispersion in their mid- to far-infrared colors.  the 350-micron flux densities (15&lt;s(350)&lt;40 mjy) place these objects near theherschel/spire 350-micron confusion threshold, with the lower limit on the starformation rate density suggesting the bulk of the 350-micron contribution willcome from less luminous infrared sources and normal galaxies.

0910.1141	the evolution of the hard x-ray luminosity function of agn	we present new observational determinations of the evolution of the 2-10kevx-ray luminosity function (xlf) of agn. we utilise data from a number ofsurveys including both the 2ms chandra deep fields and the aegis-x 200kssurvey, enabling accurate measurements of the evolution of the faint end of thexlf. we combine direct, hard x-ray selection and spectroscopic follow-up orphotometric redshift estimates at z&lt;1.2 with a rest-frame uv colourpre-selection approach at higher redshifts to avoid biases associated withcatastrophic failure of the photometric redshifts. only robust opticalcounterparts to x-ray sources are considered using a likelihood ratio matchingtechnique. a bayesian methodology is developed that considers redshiftprobability distributions, incorporates selection functions for our highredshift samples, and allows robust comparison of different evolutionarymodels. we find that the xlf retains the same shape at all redshifts, butundergoes strong luminosity evolution out to z~1, and an overall negativedensity evolution with increasing redshift, which thus dominates the evolutionat earlier times. we do not find evidence that a luminosity-dependent densityevolution, and the associated flattening of the faint-end slope, is required todescribe the evolution of the xlf. we find significantly higher space densitiesof low-luminosity, high-redshift agn than in prior studies, and a smaller shiftin the peak of the number density to lower redshifts with decreasingluminosity. the total luminosity density of agn peaks at z=1.2+/-0.1, but thereis a mild decline to higher redshifts. we find &gt;50% of black hole growth takesplace at z&gt;1, with around half in lx&lt;10^44 erg/s agn.

0912.2338	extragalactic millimeter-wave sources in south pole telescope survey  data: source counts, catalog, and statistics for an 87 square-degree field	we report the results of an 87 square-degree point-source survey centered atr.a. 5h30m, decl. -55 deg. taken with the south pole telescope (spt) at 1.4 and2.0 mm wavelengths with arc-minute resolution and milli-jansky depth. based onthe ratio of flux in the two bands, we separate the detected sources into twopopulations, one consistent with synchrotron emission from active galacticnuclei (agn) and one consistent with thermal emission from dust. we presentsource counts for each population from 11 to 640 mjy at 1.4 mm and from 4.4 to800 mjy at 2.0 mm. the 2.0 mm counts are dominated by synchrotron-dominatedsources across our reported flux range; the 1.4 mm counts are dominated bysynchroton-dominated sources above ~15 mjy and by dust-dominated sources belowthat flux level. we detect 141 synchrotron-dominated sources and 47dust-dominated sources at s/n &gt; 4.5 in at least one band. all of the mostsignificantly detected members of the synchrotron-dominated population areassociated with sources in previously published radio catalogs. some of thedust-dominated sources are associated with nearby (z &lt;&lt; 1) galaxies whose dustemission is also detected by the infrared astronomy satellite (iras). however,most of the bright, dust-dominated sources have no counterparts in any existingcatalogs. we argue that these sources represent the rarest and brightestmembers of the population commonly referred to as sub-millimeter galaxies(smgs). because these sources are selected at longer wavelengths than intypical smg surveys, they are expected to have a higher mean redshiftdistribution and may provide a new window on galaxy formation in the earlyuniverse.

1001.4529	the mid-ir and x-ray selected qso luminosity function	we present the j-band luminosity function of 1838 mid-infrared and x-rayselected agns in the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;5.85. these luminosity functions areconstructed by combining the deep multi-wavelength broad-band observations fromthe uv to the mid-ir of the ndwfs bootes field with the x-ray observations ofthe xbootes survey and the spectroscopic observations of the same field byages. our sample is primarily composed of irac-selected agns, targeted usingmodifications of the stern et al.(2005) criteria, complemented by mips 24microns and x-ray selected agns to alleviate the biases of irac mid-irselection against z~4.5 quasars and agns faint with respect to their hosts.this sample provides an accurate link between low and high redshift agnluminosity functions and does not suffer from the usual incompleteness ofoptical samples at z~3. we find that the space density of the brightest quasarsstrongly decreases from z=3 to z=0, while the space density of faint quasars isat least flat, and possibly increasing, over the same redshift range. at z&gt;3 weobserve a decrease in the space density of quasars of all brightnesses. wemodel the luminosity function by a double power-law and find that its evolutioncannot be described by either pure luminosity or pure density evolution, butmust be a combination of both. our best-fit model has bright and faintpower-law indices consistent with the low redshift measurements based on the2qz and 2slaq surveys and it generally agrees with the number of bright quasarspredicted by other lfs at all redshifts. if we construct the qso luminosityfunction using only the irac-selected agns, we find that the biases inherent tothis selection method significantly modify the behavior of phi*(z) only for z&lt;1and have no significant impact upon the characteristic magnitude m*_j(z).

1003.4264	the physical scale of the far-infrared emission in the most luminous  submillimetre galaxies ii: evidence for merger-driven star formation	we present high-resolution 345 ghz interferometric observations of twoextreme luminous (l_{ir}&gt;10^{13} l_sun), submillimetre-selected galaxies (smgs)in the cosmos field with the submillimeter array (sma). both targets werepreviously detected as unresolved point-sources by the sma in its compactconfiguration, also at 345 ghz. these new data, which provide a factor of ~3improvement in resolution, allow us to measure the physical scale of thefar-infrared in the submillimetre directly. the visibility functions of bothtargets show significant evidence for structure on 0.5-1 arcsec scales, whichat z=1.5 translates into a physical scale of 5-8 kpc. our results areconsistent with the angular and physical scales of two comparably luminousobjects with high-resolution sma followup, as well as radio continuum and cosizes. these relatively compact sizes (&lt;5-10 kpc) argue strongly formerger-driven starbursts, rather than extended gas-rich disks, as the preferredchannel for forming smgs. for the most luminous objects, the derived sizes mayalso have important physical consequences; under a series of simplifyingassumptions, we find that these two objects in particular are forming starsclose to or at the eddington limit for a starburst.

1005.3331	aegis: a multi-wavelength study of spitzer power-law galaxies	this paper analyzes a sample of 489 spitzer/irac sources in the extendedgroth strip whose spectral energy distributions fit a red power law from 3.6 to8.0 \micron. the median for sources with known redshift is &lt;z&gt;=1.6. though allor nearly all of the sample are likely to be active galactic nuclei, only 33%were detected in the egs x-ray survey (aegis-x) using 200 ks chandraobservations. the detected sources are x-ray luminous with l_x &gt; 10^43 erg/sand moderately to heavily obscured with n_h &gt; 10^22 cm^-2. stacking thex-ray-undetected sample members yields a statistically significant x-raysignal, suggesting that they are on average more distant or more obscured thansources with x-ray detections. the ratio of x-ray to mid-infrared fluxessuggests that a substantial fraction of the sources undetected in x-rays areobscured at the compton-thick level, in contrast to the x-ray-detected sources,all of which appear to be compton-thin. for the x-ray-detected power-lawsources with redshifts, an x-ray luminosity l_x ~ 10^44 erg/s marks atransition between low-luminosity, blue sources dominated by the host galaxy tohigh-luminosity, red power-law sources dominated by nuclear activity.x-ray-to-optical ratios, infrared variability, and 24 micron properties of thesample are consistent with the identification of infrared power-law sources asactive nuclei, but a rough estimate is that only 22% of agns are selected bythe power law criteria. comparison of the power-law selection technique andvarious irac color criteria for identifying agns confirms that high-redshiftsamples selected via simple irac colors may be heavily contaminated bystarlight-dominated objects.

1006.4162	sdwfs-mt-1: a self-obscured luminous supernova at z~0.2	we report the discovery of a six-month-long mid-infrared transient,sdwfs-mt-1 (aka sn 2007va), in the spitzer deep, wide-field survey of the noaodeep wide-field survey bootes field. the transient, located in a z=0.19 lowluminosity (m_[4.5]~-18.6 mag, l/l_milkyway~0.01) metal-poor (12+log(o/h)~7.8)irregular galaxy, peaked at a mid-infrared absolute magnitude of m_[4.5]~-24.2in the 4.5 micron spitzer/irac band and emitted a total energy of at least10^51 ergs. the optical emission was likely fainter than the mid-infrared,although our constraints on the optical emission are poor because the transientpeaked when the source was "behind" the sun. the spitzer data are consistentwith emission by a modified black body with a temperature of ~1350 k. we ruleout a number of scenarios for the origin of the transient such as a galacticstar, agn activity, grb, tidal disruption of a star by a black hole andgravitational lensing. the most plausible scenario is a supernova explodinginside a massive, optically thick circumstellar medium, composed of multipleshells of previously ejected material. if the proposed scenario is correct,then a significant fraction (~10%) of the most luminous supernova may beself-enshrouded by dust not only before but also after the supernova occurs.the spectral energy distribution of the progenitor of such a supernova would bea slightly cooler version of eta carina, peaking at 20-30 microns.

1107.2570	the star formation reference survey. i. survey description and basic  data	star formation is arguably the most important physical process in the cosmos.it is a fundamental driver of galaxy evolution and the ultimate source of mostof the energy emitted by galaxies. a correct interpretation of star formationrate (sfr) measures is therefore essential to our understanding of galaxyformation and evolution. unfortunately, however, no single sfr estimator isuniversally available or even applicable in all circumstances: the numerousgalaxies found in deep surveys are often too faint (or too distant) to yieldsignificant detections with most standard sfr measures, and until now therehave been no global, multi-band observations of nearby galaxies that span allthe conditions under which star-formation is taking place. to address this needin a systematic way, we have undertaken a multi-band survey of all types ofstar-forming galaxies in the local universe. this project, the star formationreference survey (sfrs), is based on a statistically valid sample of 369 nearbygalaxies that span all existing combinations of dust temperature, sfr, andspecific sfr. furthermore, because the sfrs is blind with respect to agnfraction and environment it serves as a means to assess the influence of thesefactors on sfr. our panchromatic global flux measurements (including galexfuv+nuv, sdss ugriz, 2mass jhks, spitzer 3-8{\mu}m, and others) furnish uniformsfr measures and the context in which their reliability can be assessed. thispaper describes the sfrs survey strategy, defines the sample, and presents themulti-band photometry collected to date.

1201.5617	new measurements of the cosmic infrared background fluctuations in deep  spitzer/irac survey data and their cosmological implications	we extend previous measurements of cosmic infrared background (cib)fluctuations to ~ 1 deg using new data from the spitzer extended deep survey.two fields, with depths of ~12 hr/pixel over 3 epochs, are analyzed at 3.6 and4.5 mic. maps of the fields were assembled using a self-calibration methoduniquely suitable for probing faint diffuse backgrounds. resolved sources wereremoved from the maps to a magnitude limit of ab mag ~ 25, as indicated by thelevel of the remaining shot noise. the maps were then fourier-transformed andtheir power spectra were evaluated. instrumental noise was estimated from thetime-differenced data, and subtracting this isolates the spatial fluctuationsof the actual sky. the power spectra of the source-subtracted fields remainidentical (within the observational uncertainties) for the three epochsindicating that zodiacal light contributes negligibly to the fluctuations.comparing to 8 mic power spectra shows that galactic cirrus cannot account forthe fluctuations. the signal appears isotropically distributed on the sky asrequired for an extragalactic origin. the cib fluctuations continue to divergeto &gt; 10 times those of known galaxy populations on angular scales out to &lt; 1deg. the low shot noise levels remaining in the diffuse maps indicate that thelarge scale fluctuations arise from the spatial clustering of faint sourceswell below the confusion noise. the spatial spectrum of these fluctuations isin reasonable agreement with an origin in populations clustered according tothe standard cosmological model (lcdm) at epochs coinciding with the firststars era.

1205.7065	the resonant transneptunian populations	the transneptunian objects (tnos) trapped in mean-motion resonances withneptune were likely emplaced there during planet migration late in thegiant-planet formation process. we perform detailed modelling of the resonantobjects detected in the canada-france ecliptic plane survey (cfeps) in order toprovide population estimates and, for some resonances, constrain the complexinternal orbital element distribution. detection biases play a critical rolebecause phase relationships with neptune make object discovery more likely atcertain longitudes. this paper discusses the 3:2, 5:2, 2:1, 3:1, 5:1, 4:3, 5:3,7:3, 5:4, and 7:4 mean-motion resonances, all of which had cfeps detections,along with our upper limit on 1:1 neptune trojans (which is consistent withtheir small population estimated elsewhere). for the plutinos (tnos in the 3:2resonance) we refine the orbital element distribution given in kavelaars et al.(2009) and show that steep h-magnitude distributions (n(h) proportional to10ah, with a=0.8-0.9) are favoured in the range hg=8-9, and confirm that thisresonance does not share the inclination distribution of the classical kuiperbelt. we give the first population estimate for the 5:2 resonance and findthat, to within the uncertainties, the population is equal to that of the 3:2(13,000 tnos with hg &lt; 9.16), whereas the 2:1 population is smaller by a factorof 3-4 compared to the other two resonances. we also measure significantpopulations inhabiting the 4:3, 5:3, 7:3, 5:4, 7:4, 3:1, and 5:1 resonances,with hg &lt; 9.16 (d &gt;100 km) populations in the thousands. we compare ourintrinsic population and orbital-element distributions with several publishedmodels of resonant-tno production; the most striking discrepancy is thatresonances beyond the 2:1 are in reality more heavily populated than inpublished models.

1206.5000	candels: the progenitors of compact quiescent galaxies at z~2	we combine high-resolution hst/wfc3 images with multi-wavelength photometryto track the evolution of structure and activity of massive (log(m*) &gt; 10)galaxies at redshifts z = 1.4 - 3 in two fields of the cosmic assemblynear-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey (candels). we detect compact,star-forming galaxies (csfgs) whose number densities, masses, sizes, and starformation rates qualify them as likely progenitors of compact, quiescent,massive galaxies (cqgs) at z = 1.5 - 3. at z &gt; 2 most csfgs have specificstar-formation rates (ssfr = 10^-9 yr^-1) half that of typical, massive sfgs atthe same epoch, and host x-ray luminous agn 30 times (~30%) more frequently.these properties suggest that csfgs are formed by gas-rich processes (mergersor disk-instabilities) that induce a compact starburst and feed an agn, which,in turn, quench the star formation on dynamical timescales (few 10^8 yr). thecsfgs are continuously being formed at z = 2 - 3 and fade to cqgs by z = 1.5.after this epoch, csfgs are rare, thereby truncating the formation of new cqgs.meanwhile, down to z = 1, existing cqgs continue to enlarge to match local qgsin size, while less-gas-rich mergers and other secular mechanisms shepherd(larger) sfgs as later arrivals to the red sequence. in summary, we propose twoevolutionary scenarios of qg formation: an early (z &gt; 2), fast-formation pathof rapidly-quenched csfgs that evolve into cqgs that later enlarge within thequiescent phase, and a slow, late-arrival (z &lt; 2) path for sfgs to form qgswithout passing through a compact state.

1207.2727	the ages, masses and star-formation rates of spectroscopically confirmed  z~6 galaxies in candels	we report the results of a study exploring the stellar populations of 13luminous (l&gt;l*), spectroscopically confirmed, galaxies in the redshift interval5.5&lt;z&lt;6.5, all with wfc3/ir and irac imaging from the hst/candels andspitzer/seds surveys. based on fitting the observed photometry with sedtemplates covering a wide range of different star-formation histories, and aself consistent treatment of lyman-alpha emission, we find that the derivedstellar masses lie within the range 10^9 msun &lt; m*&lt; 10^10 msun and are robustto within a factor of two. in contrast, we confirm previous reports that theages of the stellar populations are poorly constrained. although thebest-fitting models for three objects have ages &gt;= 300 myr, the degeneraciesintroduced by dust extinction mean that only two of these objects actuallyrequire a &gt;300 myr old stellar population to reproduce the observed photometry.moreover, when considering only smoothly-varying star-formation histories, weobserve a clear tension between the data and models such that a galaxy sedtemplate with an old age is often chosen in order to try and fit objects withblue uv-slopes but red uv-to-optical colours. to break this tension we exploresed fitting with two-component models (burst plus on-going star-formation) andallow for nebular emission. on average, the inclusion of nebular emission leadsto lower stellar-mass estimates (median offset 0.18 dex), moderately higherspecific star-formation rates, and allows for a wider range of plausiblestellar ages. however, based on our sed modelling, we find no strong evidencefor extremely young ages in our sample (&lt;50 myr). finally, considering all ofthe different star-formation histories explored, we find that the medianbest-fitting ages are of the order 200-300 myr and that the objects with thetightest constraints indicate ages in the range 50-200 myr (abridged).

1306.0850	revealing the heavily obscured agn population of high redshift 3crr  sources with chandra x-ray observations	chandra observations of a complete, flux-limited sample of 38 high-redshift(1&lt;z&lt;2), low-frequency selected (and so unbiased in orientation) 3crr radiosources are reported. the sample includes 21 quasars (= broad line radiogalaxies) and 17 narrow line radio galaxies (nlrgs) with matched 178 mhz radioluminosity (log l_r ~ 44-45). the quasars have high radio core-fraction, highx-ray luminosities (log l_x ~ 45-46) and soft x-ray hardness ratios (hr ~ -0.5)indicating low obscuration. the nlrgs have lower core-fraction, lower apparentx-ray luminosities (log l_x ~ 43-45) and mostly hard x-ray hardness ratios(hr&gt;0) indicating obscuration (log n_h ~ 22-24 cm^-2). these properties and thecorrelation between obscuration and radio core-fraction are consistent withorientation-dependent obscuration as in unification models. about half thenlrgs have soft x-ray hardness ratios and/or high [oiii] emission line to x-rayluminosity ratio suggesting obscuration by compton thick (ct) material so thatscattered nuclear or extended x-ray emission dominates (as in ngc1068). theratios of unobscured to compton-thin (10^{22}&lt; n_h(int) &lt; 1.5 x 10^{24} cm^-2)to ct (n_h(int) &gt; 1.5 x 10^{24} cm^-2) is 2.5:1.4:1 in this high luminosity,radio-selected sample. the obscured fraction is 0.5, higher than is typicallyreported for agn at comparable luminosities from multi-wavelength surveys(0.1-0.3). assuming random nuclear orientation, the unobscured half-openingangle of the disk/wind/torus structure is ~ 60deg and the obscuring materialcovers 30deg of which ~ 12deg is compton thick. the multi-wavelength propertiesreveal that many nlrgs have intrinsic absorption 10-1000x higher than indicatedby their x-ray hardness ratios, and their true l_x values are ~10--100x largerthan the hardness-ratio absorption corrections would indicate.

1309.2280	the most luminous z~9-10 galaxy candidates yet found: the luminosity  function, cosmic star-formation rate, and the first mass density estimate at  500 myr	[abridged] we present the discovery of four surprisingly bright (h_160 ~ 26 -27 mag ab) galaxy candidates at z~9-10 in the complete hst candels wfc3/irgoods-n imaging data, doubling the number of z~10 galaxy candidates that areknown, just ~500 myr after the big bang. two similarly bright sources are alsodetected in a systematic re-analysis of the goods-s data set. three of the fourgalaxies in goods-n are significantly detected at 4.5-6.2sigma in the very deepspitzer/irac 4.5 micron data, as is one of the goods-s candidates. furthermore,the brightest of our candidates (at z=10.2+-0.4) is robustly detected also at3.6 micron (6.9sigma), revealing a flat uv spectral energy distribution with aslope beta=-2.0+-0.2, consistent with demonstrated trends with luminosity athigh redshift. the abundance of such luminous candidates suggests that theluminosity function evolves more significantly in phi_* than in l_* at z&gt;~8with a higher number density of bright sources than previously expected.despite the discovery of these luminous candidates, the cosmic star formationrate density for galaxies with sfr &gt;0.7 m_sun/yr shows an order-of-magnitudeincrease in only 170 myr from z ~ 10 to z ~ 8, consistent with previousresults. based on the irac detections, we derive galaxy stellar masses at z~10,finding that these luminous objects are typically 10^9 m_sun. the cosmicstellar mass density at z~10 is log10 rho_* = 4.7^+0.5_-0.8 m_sun mpc^-3 forgalaxies brighter than m_uv~-18. the remarkable brightness, and henceluminosity, of these z~9-10 candidates highlights the opportunity for deepspectroscopy to determine their redshift and nature, demonstrates the value ofadditional search fields covering a wider area to understand star-formation inthe very early universe, and highlights the opportunities for jwst to map thebuildup of galaxies at redshifts much earlier than z~10.

1310.6039	the era of star formation in galaxy clusters	we analyze the star formation properties of 16 infrared-selected,spectroscopically confirmed galaxy clusters at $1 &lt; z &lt; 1.5$ from thespitzer/irac shallow cluster survey (iscs). we present new spectroscopicconfirmation for six of these high-redshift clusters, five of which are at$z&gt;1.35$. using infrared luminosities measured with deep spitzer/mipsobservations at 24 $\mu$m, along with robust optical+irac photometric redshiftsand sed-fitted stellar masses, we present the dust-obscured star-formingfractions, star formation rates and specific star formation rates in theseclusters as functions of redshift and projected clustercentric radius. we findthat $z\sim 1.4$ represents a transition redshift for the iscs sample, withclear evidence of an unquenched era of cluster star formation at earlier times.beyond this redshift the fraction of star-forming cluster members increasesmonotonically toward the cluster centers. indeed, the specific star formationrate in the cores of these distant clusters is consistent with field values atsimilar redshifts, indicating that at $z&gt;1.4$ environment-dependent quenchinghad not yet been established in iscs clusters. combining these observationswith complementary studies showing a rapid increase in the agn fraction, astochastic star formation history, and a major merging episode at the sameepoch in this cluster sample, we suggest that the starburst activity is likelymerger-driven and that the subsequent quenching is due to feedback frommerger-fueled agn. the totality of the evidence suggests we are witnessing thefinal quenching period that brings an end to the era of star formation ingalaxy clusters and initiates the era of passive evolution.

1311.4953	optical spectroscopy and velocity dispersions of galaxy clusters from  the spt-sz survey	we present optical spectroscopy of galaxies in clusters detected through thesunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect with the south pole telescope (spt). we reportour own measurements of $61$ spectroscopic cluster redshifts, and $48$ velocitydispersions each calculated with more than $15$ member galaxies. this catalogalso includes $19$ dispersions of spt-observed clusters previously reported inthe literature. the majority of the clusters in this paper are spt-discovered;of these, most have been previously reported in other spt cluster catalogs, andfive are reported here as spt discoveries for the first time. by performing aresampling analysis of galaxy velocities, we find that unbiased velocitydispersions can be obtained from a relatively small number of member galaxies($\lesssim 30$), but with increased systematic scatter. we use this analysis todetermine statistical confidence intervals that include the effect ofmembership selection. we fit scaling relations between the observed clustervelocity dispersions and mass estimates from sz and x-ray observables. in bothcases, the results are consistent with the scaling relation between velocitydispersion and mass expected from dark-matter simulations. we measure a$\sim$30% log-normal scatter in dispersion at fixed mass, and a $\sim$10%offset in the normalization of the dispersion-mass relation when compared tothe expectation from simulations, which is within the expected level ofsystematic uncertainty.

1312.2462	constraints on the cmb temperature evolution using multi-band  measurements of the sunyaev zel'dovich effect with the south pole telescope	the adiabatic evolution of the temperature of the cosmic microwave background(cmb) is a key prediction of standard cosmology. we study deviations from theexpected adiabatic evolution of the cmb temperature of the form $t(z)=t_0(1+z)^{1-\alpha}$ using measurements of the spectrum of the sunyaevzel'dovich effect with the south pole telescope (spt). we present a method forusing the ratio of the sunyaev zel'dovich signal measured at 95 and 150 ghz inthe spt data to constrain the temperature of the cmb. we demonstrate that thisapproach provides unbiased results using mock observations of clusters from anew set of hydrodynamical simulations. we apply this method to a sample of 158spt-selected clusters, spanning the redshift range $0.05 &lt; z &lt; 1.35$, andmeasure $\alpha = 0.017^{+0.030}_{-0.028}$, consistent with the standard modelprediction of $\alpha=0$. in combination with other published results, weconstrain $\alpha = 0.011 \pm 0.016$, an improvement of $\sim 20\%$ overpublished constraints. this measurement also provides a strong constraint onthe effective equation of state in models of decaying dark energy$w_\mathrm{eff} = -0.987^{+0.016}_{-0.017}$.

1410.0025	x-ray cavities in a sample of 83 spt-selected clusters of galaxies:  tracing the evolution of agn feedback in clusters of galaxies out to z=1.2	x-ray cavities are key tracers of mechanical (or radio mode) heating arisingfrom the active galactic nuclei (agn) in brightest cluster galaxies. we reporton a survey for x-ray cavities in 83 massive, high-redshift (0.4&lt;z&lt;1.2)clusters of galaxies selected by their sunyaev-zel'dovich signature in thesouth pole telescope data. based on chandra x-ray images, we find a total of 6clusters having symmetric pairs of surface brightness depressions consistentwith the picture of radio jets inflating x-ray cavities in the intraclustermedium. the majority of these detections are of relatively low significance andrequire deeper follow-up data in order to be confirmed. further, due to thelimitations of chandra at high redshift, this search misses small (&lt;10 kpc),unresolved x-ray cavities at high (z&gt;0.5) redshift. despite these limitations,our results suggest that the power generated by agn feedback in brightestcluster galaxies has remained unchanged for over half of the age of theuniverse (&gt;7 gyrs at z=0.8). on average, the detected x-ray cavities havepowers of 0.8-5*10^45 erg/s, enthalpies of 3-6*10^59 erg, and radii of 17 kpc.integrating over 7 gyrs, we find that the supermassive black holes in thebrightest cluster galaxies may have accreted 10^8 to several 10^9m_sun ofmaterial to power these outflows. this level of accretion indicates thatsignificant supermassive black hole growth may occur not only at early times,in the quasar era, but at late times as well. we also find that x-ray cavitiesat high-redshift may inject an excess heat of 0.1-1.0 kev per particle into thehot intracluster medium above and beyond the energy needed to offset cooling.this value is similar to the energy needed to preheat clusters, breakself-similarity, and explain the excess entropy in hot atmospheres.

1412.0532	the galaxy stellar mass function at 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5 in the candels/uds,  goods-south, and hudf fields	the galaxy stellar mass function (gsmf) at high-z provides key information onstar-formation history and mass assembly in the young universe. we aimed to usethe unique combination of deep optical/nir/mir imaging provided by hst, spitzerand the vlt in the candels-uds, goods-south, and hudf fields to determine thegsmf over the redshift range 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5. we utilised the hst wfc3/ir nir imagingfrom candels and hudf09, reaching h~27-28.5 over a total area of 369 arcmin2,in combination with associated deep hst acs optical data, deep spitzer iracimaging from the seds programme, and deep y and k-band vlt hawk-i images fromthe hugs programme, to select a galaxy sample with high-quality photometricredshifts. these have been calibrated with more than 150 spectroscopicredshifts in the range 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5, resulting in an overall precision ofsigma_z/(1+z)~0.037. we have determined the low-mass end of the high-z gsmfwith unprecedented precision, reaching down to masses as low as m*~10^9 msun atz=4 and ~6x10^9 msun at z=7. we find that the gsmf at 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5 depends onlyslightly on the recipes adopted to measure the stellar masses, namely thephoto-z, the sfhs, the nebular contribution or the presence of agn on theparent sample. the low-mass end of the gsmf is steeper than has been found atlower redshifts, but appears to be unchanged over the redshift range probedhere. our results are very different from previous gsmf estimates based onconverting uv galaxy luminosity functions into mass functions via tight m/lrelations. integrating our evolving gsmf over mass, we find that the growth ofstellar mass density is barely consistent with the time-integral of the sfrdensity over cosmic time at z&gt;4. these results confirm the unique synergy ofthe candels+hudf, hugs, and seds surveys for the discovery and study ofmoderate/low-mass galaxies at high redshifts.

1412.7521	a measurement of gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave  background by galaxy clusters using data from the south pole telescope	clusters of galaxies are expected to gravitationally lens the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) and thereby generate a distinct signal in the cmb onarcminute scales. measurements of this effect can be used to constrain themasses of galaxy clusters with cmb data alone. here we present a measurement oflensing of the cmb by galaxy clusters using data from the south pole telescope(spt). we develop a maximum likelihood approach to extract the cmb clusterlensing signal and validate the method on mock data. we quantify the effects onour analysis of several potential sources of systematic error and find thatthey generally act to reduce the best-fit cluster mass. it is estimated thatthis bias to lower cluster mass is roughly $0.85\sigma$ in units of thestatistical error bar, although this estimate should be viewed as an upperlimit. we apply our maximum likelihood technique to 513 clusters selected viatheir sz signatures in spt data, and rule out the null hypothesis of no lensingat $3.1\sigma$. the lensing-derived mass estimate for the full cluster sampleis consistent with that inferred from the sz flux: $m_{200,\mathrm{lens}} =0.83_{-0.37}^{+0.38}\, m_{200,\mathrm{sz}}$ (68% c.l., statistical error only).

1506.01323	s-candels: the spitzer-cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic  survey. survey design, photometry, and deep irac source counts	the spitzer-cosmic assembly deep near-infrared extragalactic legacy survey(s-candels; pi g. fazio) is a cycle 8 exploration program designed to detectgalaxies at very high redshifts (z &gt; 5). to mitigate the effects of cosmicvariance and also to take advantage of deep coextensive coverage in multiplebands by the hubble space telescope multi-cycle treasury program candels,s-candels was carried out within five widely separated extragalactic fields:the ukidss ultra-deep survey, the extended chandra deep field south, cosmos,the hst deep field north, and the extended groth strip. s-candels builds uponthe existing coverage of these fields from the spitzer extended deep survey(seds) by increasing the integration time from 12 hours to a total of 50 hoursbut within a smaller area, 0.16 square degrees. the additional depthsignificantly increases the survey completeness at faint magnitudes. this paperdescribes the s-candels survey design, processing, and publicly-available dataproducts. we present irac dual-band 3.6+4.5 micron catalogs reaching to a depthof 26.5 ab mag. deep irac counts for the roughly 135,000 galaxies detected bys-candels are consistent with models based on known galaxy populations. theincrease in depth beyond earlier spitzer/irac surveys does not reveal asignificant additional contribution from discrete sources to the diffuse cosmicinfrared background (cib). thus it remains true that only roughly half of theestimated cib flux from cobe/dirbe is resolved.

1508.06283	star-forming brightest cluster galaxies at 0.25 &lt; z &lt; 1.25: a  transitioning fuel supply	we present a multi-wavelength study of 90 brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs)in a sample of galaxy clusters selected via the sunyaev zel'dovich effect bythe south pole telescope, utilizing data from various ground- and space-basedfacilities. we infer the star formation rate (sfr) for the bcg in each cluster,based on the uv and ir continuum luminosity, as well as the [o ii] emissionline luminosity in cases where spectroscopy is available, finding 7 systemswith sfr &gt; 100 msun/yr. we find that the bcg sfr exceeds 10 msun/yr in 31 of 90(34%) cases at 0.25 &lt; z &lt; 1.25, compared to ~1-5% at z ~ 0 from the literature.at z &gt; 1, this fraction increases to 92(+6)(-31)%, implying a steady decreasein the bcg sfr over the past ~9 gyr. at low-z, we find that the specific starformation rate in bcgs is declining more slowly with time than for field orcluster galaxies, most likely due to the replenishing fuel from the cooling icmin relaxed, cool core clusters. at z &gt; 0.6, the correlation between clustercentral entropy and bcg star formation - which is well established at z ~ 0 -is not present. instead, we find that the most star-forming bcgs at high-z arefound in the cores of dynamically unrelaxed clusters. we investigate therest-frame near-uv morphology of a subsample of the most star-forming bcgsusing data from the hubble space telescope, finding complex, highly asymmetricuv morphologies on scales as large as ~50-60 kpc. the high fraction ofstar-forming bcgs hosted in unrelaxed, non-cool core clusters at early timessuggests that the dominant mode of fueling star formation in bcgs may haverecently transitioned from galaxy-galaxy interactions to icm cooling.

1509.02835	stellar masses and star formation rates of lensed dusty star-forming  galaxies from the spt survey	to understand cosmic mass assembly in the universe at early epochs, weprimarily rely on measurements of stellar mass and star formation rate ofdistant galaxies. in this paper, we present stellar masses and star formationrates of six high-redshift ($2.8\leq z \leq 5.7$) dusty, star-forming galaxies(dsfgs) that are strongly gravitationally lensed by foreground galaxies. thesesources were first discovered by the south pole telescope (spt) at millimeterwavelengths and all have spectroscopic redshifts and robust lens models derivedfrom alma observations. we have conducted follow-up observations, obtainingmulti-wavelength imaging data, using {\it hst}, {\it spitzer}, {\it herschel}and the atacama pathfinder experiment (apex). we use the high-resolution {\ithst}/wfc3 images to disentangle the background source from the foreground lensin {\it spitzer}/irac data. the detections and upper limits provide importantconstraints on the spectral energy distributions (seds) for these dsfgs,yielding stellar masses, ir luminosities, and star formation rates (sfrs). thesed fits of six spt sources show that the intrinsic stellar masses span a rangemore than one order of magnitude with a median value $\sim$ 5 $\times10^{10}m_{\sun}$. the intrinsic ir luminosities range from 4$\times10^{12}l_{\sun}$ to 4$\times 10^{13}l_{\sun}$. they all have prodigiousintrinsic star formation rates of 510 to 4800 $m_{\sun} {\rm yr}^{-1}$.compared to the star-forming main sequence (ms), these six dsfgs have specificsfrs that all lie above the ms, including two galaxies that are a factor of 10higher than the ms. our results suggest that we are witnessing the ongoingstrong starburst events which may be driven by major mergers.

1512.02656	infrared color selection of massive galaxies at z &gt; 3	we introduce a new color-selection technique to identify high-redshift,massive galaxies that are systematically missed by lyman-break selection. thenew selection is based on the h_{160} and irac 4.5um bands, specifically h -[4.5] &gt; 2.25 mag. these galaxies, dubbed "hieros", include two majorpopulations that can be separated with an additional j - h color. thepopulations are massive and dusty star-forming galaxies at z &gt; 3 (jh-blue) andextremely dusty galaxies at z &lt; 3 (jh-red). the 350 arcmin^2 of the goods-n andgoods-s fields with the deepest hst/wfc3 and irac data contain 285 hieros downto [4.5] &lt; 24 mag. we focus here primarily on jh-blue (z &gt; 3) hieros, whichhave a median photometric redshift z ~4.4 and stellar massm_{*}~10^{10.6} msun,and are much fainter in the rest-frame uv than similarly massive lyman-breakgalaxies (lbgs). their star formation rates (sfrs) reaches ~240 msun yr^{-1}leading to a specific sfr, ssfr ~4.2 gyr^{-1}, suggesting that the ssfrs formassive galaxies continue to grow at z &gt; 2 but at a lower growth rate than fromz=0 to z=2. with a median half-light radius of 2 kpc, including ~20% as compactas quiescent galaxies at similar redshifts, jh-blue hieros represent perfectstar-forming progenitors of the most massive (m_{*} &gt; 10^{11.2} msun) compactquiescent galaxies at z ~ 3 and have the right number density. hieros make up~60% of all galaxies with m_{*} &gt; 10^{10.5} msun identified at z &gt; 3 from theirphotometric redshifts. this is five times more than lbgs with nearly no overlapbetween the two populations. while hieros make up 15-25% of the total sfrdensity at z ~ 4-5, they completely dominate the sfr density taking place inm_{*} &gt;10^{10.5} msun galaxies, and are therefore crucial to understanding thevery early phase of massive galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0406276	the off-nuclear starbursts in ngc 4038/4039 (the antennae galaxies)	imaging of the antennae galaxies (ngc 4038/4039) with the infrared arraycamera (irac) aboard the spitzer space telescope reveals large concentrationsof star forming activity away from both nuclei of the two merging galaxies.these images confirm earlier findings based on iso data with lower angularresolution. the short wavelength emission shows numerous compact sourcesidentified as stellar clusters. at the longer wavelengths, bright, moreamorphous and filamentary features correlate well with the known distributionsof denser gas, warm dust, and hii regions. there are also fainter, more diffusecomponents at all wavelengths that permeate the entire region and extend intothe two tidal tails. non-stellar dust emission dominates the 5.8 and 8.0 micronimages, accounting for as much as 79% of the light at 5.8 micron and 95% at 8micron, averaged over the entire galaxy. assuming that the non-stellar emissiontraces star formation, the irac data provide a view into the total underlyingstar forming activities unaffected by obscuration. using the flux ratio ofnon-stellar to stellar emission as a guide, we map the local star formationrate in the antennae and compare that to similar measurements in both normaland infrared-luminous galaxies. this rate in the active regions is found to beas high as those seen in starburst and some ultra-luminous infrared galaxies on``per unit mass'' basis. the two galactic centers actually have lower starforming rates than the off-nuclear regions despite the presence of abundantdense gas and dust, suggesting that the latter is a necessary but notsufficient condition for on-going star formation.

astro-ph;0408248	the anatomy of star formation in ngc 300	the spitzer space telescope was used to study the mid-infrared tofar-infrared properties of ngc 300, and to compare dust emission to halpha toelucidate the heating of the ism and the star formation cycle at scales &lt; 100pc. the new data allow us to discern clear differences in the spatialdistribution of 8 micron dust emission with respect to 24 micron dust and tohii regions traced by the halpha light. the 8 micron emission highlights therims of hii regions, and the 24 micron emission is more strongly peaked in starforming regions than at 8 microns. we confirm the existence and approximateamplitude of interstellar dust emission at 4.5 microns, detected statisticallyin infrared space observatory (iso) data, and conclude it arises in starforming regions. when averaging over regions larger than ~ 1 kpc, the ratio ofhalpha to aromatic feature emission in ngc 300 is consistent with the valuesobserved in disks of spiral galaxies. the mid-to-far-infrared spectral energydistribution of dust emission is generally consistent with pre-spitzer models.

astro-ph;0509566	the diverse infrared properties of a complete sample of star-forming  dwarf galaxies	we present mid-infrared spitzer space telescope observations of a completesample of star-forming dwarf galaxies selected from the kpno internationalspectroscopic survey. the galaxies span a wide range in mid-infraredproperties. contrary to expectations, some of the galaxies emit strongly at 8micron indicating the presence of hot dust and/or pahs. the ratio of thismid-infrared dust emission to the stellar emission is compared with thegalaxies' luminosity, star-formation rate, metallicity, and optical reddening.we find that the strength of the 8.0 micron dust emission to the stellaremission ratio is more strongly correlated with the star-formation rate than itis with the metallicity or the optical reddening in these systems. nonetheless,there is a correlation between the 8.0 micron luminosity and metallicity. theslope of this luminosity-metallicity correlation is shallower thancorresponding ones in the b-band and 3.6 micron. the precise nature of the 8.0micron emission seen in these galaxies (i.e., pah versus hot dust or somecombination of the two) will require future study, including deep mid-irspectroscopy.

astro-ph;0512357	an investigation of the submillimeter background radiation using scuba  and spitzer	we investigate the redshift dependence of the contribution to theextragalactic far-infrared/sub-millimeter background from galaxies detected bythe spitzer space telescope at 8um and 24um. using seven-band optical tomid-infrared photometry, we estimate photometric redshifts for the spitzersources which appear to be mostly l* galaxies at a median redshift of z=1.0.these sources, extracted from deep 8um and 24um mosaics of the cudss 14-hourfield with 5sigma limits of 5.8ujy and 70ujy respectively, exhibit significant850um and 450um emission as observed by scuba. at 850um, after removing&gt;=4sigma sources and those securely identified in our previous cross-matchingpaper, we measure stacked flux at the significance level of 4.4sigma and2.9sigma from the full 8um and 24um galaxy catalogue respectively. at 450um,flux is detected from all 8um galaxies at the level of 3.5sigma, while there isno significant emission from the 24um galaxies. we find that the 850um flux isemitted almost exclusively at z&gt;~1.3 from the spitzer sources with 0.44mjy(4.7sigma) per 8um source and 0.51mjy (2.8sigma) per 24um source. thiscorresponds to a contribution of (16+/-3)% toward the 850um extra-galacticbackground from the 8um sources and (5.0+/-1.8)% from the 24um sources. at450um, only the 8um sources within the redshift interval 1&lt;z&lt;2 exhibitsignificant emission with an average flux per source of 3.35mjy (3.0sigma).this is a contribution of (37+/-12)% to the 450um background.

astro-ph;0601314	spitzer/mips infrared imaging of m31: further evidence for a spiral/ring  composite structure	new images of m31 at 24, 70, and 160 micron taken with the multiband imagingphotometer for spitzer (mips) reveal the morphology of the dust in this galaxy.this morphology is well represented by a composite of two logarithmic spiralarms and a circular ring (radius ~10 kpc) of star formation offset from thenucleus. the two spiral arms appear to start at the ends of a bar in thenuclear region and extend beyond the star forming ring. as has been found inprevious work, the spiral arms are not continuous but composed of spiralsegments. the star forming ring is very circular except for a region near m32where it splits. the lack of well defined spiral arms and the prominence of thenearly circular ring suggests that m31 has been distorted by interactions withits satellite galaxies. using new dynamical simulations of m31 interacting withm32 and ngc 205 we find that, qualitatively, such interactions can produce anoffset, split ring like that seen in the mips images.

astro-ph;0609466	far-infrared characterization of an ultra-luminous starburst associated  with a massively-accreting black hole at z=1.15	as part of the "all wavelength extended groth strip international survey"(aegis), we describe the panchromatic characterization of an x-ray luminousactive galactic nucleus (agn) in a merging galaxy at z=1.15. this object isdetected at infrared (8mic, 24mic, 70mic, 160mic), submillimeter (850mic) andradio wavelengths, from which we derive a bolometric luminosity l_bol ~ 9x10^12lsol. we find that the agn clearly dominates the hot dust emission below 40micbut its total energetic power inferred from the hard x-rays is substantiallyless than the bolometric output of the system. about 50% of the infraredluminosity is indeed produced by a cold dust component that probably originatesfrom enshrouded star formation in the host galaxy. in the context of a coevalgrowth of stellar bulges and massive black holes, this source might represent a``transition'' object sharing properties with both quasars and luminousstarbursts. study of such composite galaxies will help address how the starformation and disk-accretion phenomena may have regulated each other at highredshift and how this coordination may have participated to the build-up of therelationship observed locally between the masses of black holes and stellarspheroids.

astro-ph;0609579	a scuba/spitzer investigation of the far infra-red extragalactic  background	we have measured the contribution of submillimeter and mid-infrared sourcesto the extragalactic background radiation at 70 and 160um. specifically, wehave stacked flux in 70 and 160um spitzer space telescope (spitzer)observations of the canada-uk deep sub-millimeter survey 14h field at thepositions of 850um sources detected by scuba and also 8 and 24um sourcesdetected by spitzer. we find that per source, the scuba galaxies are thestrongest and the 8um sources the weakest contributors to the background fluxat both 70 and 160um. our estimate of the contribution of the scuba sources ishigher than previous estimates. however, expressed as a total contribution, thefull 8um source catalogue accounts for twice the total 24um source contributionand ~10 times the total scuba source contribution. the 8um sources account forthe majority of the background radiation at 160um with a flux of 0.87+/-0.16mjy/sr and at least a third at 70um with a flux of 0.103+/-0.019 mjy/sr. thesemeasurements are consistent with current lower limits on the background at 70and 160um. finally, we have investigated the 70 and 160um emission from the 8and 24um sources as a function of redshift. we find that the average 70um fluxper 24um source and the average 160um flux per 8 and 24um source is constantover all redshifts, up to z~4. in contrast, the low-redshift half (z&lt;1) of theof 8um sample contributes approximately four times the total 70um flux of thehigh-redshift half. these trends can be explained by a single non-evolving sed.

astro-ph;0610543	an almost head-on collision as the origin of two off-centre rings in the  andromeda galaxy	the unusual morphology of the andromeda spiral (messier 31, the closestspiral galaxy to the milky way) has long been an enigma. although regarded fordecades as showing little evidence of a violent history, m~31 has a well-knownouter ring of star formation at a radius of 10 kpc whose center is offset fromthe galaxy nucleus. in addition, the outer galaxy disk is warped as seen atboth optical and radio wavelengths. the halo contains numerous loops andripples. here we report the discovery, based on analysis of previously-obtaineddata, of a second, inner dust ring with projected dimensions 1.5 by 1 kpc andoffset by ~0.5kpc from the center of the galaxy. the two rings appear to bedensity waves propagating in the disk. numerical simulations offer a completelynew interpretation for the morphology of m31: both rings result from acompanion galaxy plunging head-on through the center of the disk of m31. themost likely interloper is m32. head-on collisions between galaxies are rare,but it appears nonetheless that one took place 210 million years ago in ourlocal group of galaxies.
