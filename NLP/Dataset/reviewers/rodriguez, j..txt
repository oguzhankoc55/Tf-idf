0901.0731	the early phase of a h1743-322 outburst observed by integral, rxte,  swift, and xmm/newton	we investigate the early phase of the first state change during the 2008september-november outburst of h1743-322, first detected by the integralsatellite. we analyse integral, rxte, swift, and xmm/newton observations, whichprovide coverage of the quiescence to outburst evolution in the 3-200 kev rangeevery few days. the energy spectra are well fitted by a phenomenological modelconsisting of an exponentially cut-off power law plus a disc component. a morephysical model of thermal comptonisation (and a disc) represents the spectraequally well. in a first phase (up to mjd 54760), the photon index andtemperature of the disc do not vary significantly, and have values reminiscentof the hard state (hs). the timing analysis is also consistent with that of ahs, and shows in particular a rather high degree of variability (~30%), and astrong ~0.5-1 hz qpo with its first harmonic. the timing and spectralcharacteristics of h1743-322 are similar to those of the first hs during its2003 outburst. after mjd 54760, a change to softer spectra and a ~5-6 hz qpoindicate that the source underwent a state transition into a hard-intermediatestate (hims). we observe in both states a correlation between the qpo frequencyand the photon index, which indicates a strong link between the accretion disc,generally understood to determine the qpo frequency, and the corona, whichdetermines the qpo power. the gradual disappearance of the qpo harmonic, andthe slowly decreasing hard x-ray flux, imply that the accretion disc graduallymoved inwards during the hs.

physics;0306008	virtual data in cms analysis	the use of virtual data for enhancing the collaboration between large groupsof scientists is explored in several ways:  - by defining ``virtual'' parameter spaces which can be searched and sharedin an organized way by a collaboration of scientists in the course of theiranalysis; - by providing a mechanism to log the provenance of results and the ability totrace them back to the various stages in the analysis of real or simulateddata; - by creating ``check points'' in the course of an analysis to permitcollaborators to explore their own analysis branches by refining selections,improving the signal to background ratio, varying the estimation of parameters,etc.; - by facilitating the audit of an analysis and the reproduction of its resultsby a different group, or in a peer review context.  we describe a prototype for the analysis of data from the cms experimentbased on the virtual data system chimera and the object-oriented data analysisframework root. the chimera system is used to chain together several steps inthe analysis process including the monte carlo generation of data, thesimulation of detector response, the reconstruction of physics objects andtheir subsequent analysis, histogramming and visualization using the rootframework.

0903.4714	detailed radio to soft gamma-ray studies of the 2005 outburst of the new  x-ray transient xte j1818-245	xte j1818-245 is an x-ray nova that experienced an outburst in 2005, firstseen by the rxte satellite. the source was observed simultaneously at variouswavelengths up to soft gamma-rays with the integral satellite, from 2005february to september. x-ray novae are extreme systems that often harbor ablack hole, and are known to emit throughout the electromagnetic spectrum whenin outburst. we analyzed radio, (n)ir, optical, x-ray and soft gamma-rayobservations and constructed simultaneous broad-band x-ray spectra. analyzingboth the light curves in various energy ranges and the hardness-intensitydiagram enabled us to study the long-term behavior of the source. spectralparameters were typical of the soft intermediate states and the high softstates of a black hole candidate. the source showed relatively small spectralvariations in x-rays with considerable flux variation in radio. spectralstudies showed that the accretion disc cooled down from 0.64 to 0.27 kev in 100days and that the total flux decreased while the relative flux of the hotmedium increased. radio emission was detected several times, and,interestingly, five days after entering the hss. modeling the spectral energydistribution from the radio to the soft gamma-rays reveals that the radioflares arise from several ejection events. xte j1818-245 is likely a black holecandidate transient source that might be closer than the galactic bulge. theresults from the data analysis trace the physical changes that took place inthe system at a maximum bolometric luminosity of (0.4-0.9)e38 erg/s (assuming adistance between 2.8-4.3 kpc) and they are discussed within the context of discand jet models.

0910.3074	discovery of a highly energetic pulsar associated with igr j14003-6326  in a young uncataloged galactic supernova remnant g310.6-1.6	we report the discovery of 31.18 ms pulsations from the integral source igrj14003-6326 using the rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte). this pulsar is mostlikely associated with the bright chandra x-ray point source lying at thecenter of g310.6-1.6, a previously unrecognised galactic composite supernovaremnant with a bright central non-thermal radio and x-ray nebula, taken to bethe pulsar wind nebula (pwn). psr j1400-6325 is amongst the most energeticrotation-powered pulsars in the galaxy, with a spin-down luminosity of edot =5.1e+37 erg.s-1. in the rotating dipole model, the surface dipole magneticfield strength is b_s = 1.1e+12 g and the characteristic age tau_c = p/2pdot =12.7 kyr. the high spin-down power is consistent with the hard spectral indicesof the pulsar and the nebula of 1.22 +/- 0.15 and 1.83 +/- 0.08, respectively,and a 2-10 kev flux ratio f_pwn/f_psr ~ 8. follow-up parkes observationsresulted in the detection of radio emission at 10 and 20 cm from psr j1400-6325at a dispersion measure of ~ 560 cm-3 pc, which implies a relatively largedistance of 10 +/- 3 kpc. however, the resulting location off the galacticplane of ~ 280 pc would be much larger than the typical thickness of themolecular disk, and we argue that g310.6-1.6 lies at a distance of ~ 7 kpc.there is no gamma-ray counterpart to the nebula or pulsar in the fermi datapublished so far. a multi-wavelength study of this new composite supernovaremnant, from radio to very-high energy gamma-rays, suggests a young (&lt; 1000yr) system, formed by a sub-energetic (~ 1e+50 ergs), low ejecta mass (m_ej ~ 3msun) sn explosion that occurred in a low-density environment (n_0 ~ 0.01cm-3).

0912.2707	spectral evolution of bright ns lmxbs with integral: an application of  the thermal plus bulk comptonization model	the aim of this work is to investigate in a physical and quantitative way thespectral evolution of bright neutron star low-mass x-ray binaries (ns lmxbs),with special regard to the transient hard x-ray tails. we analyzed integraldata for five sources (gx 5-1, gx 349+2, gx 13+1, gx 3+1, gx 9+1) and builtbroad-band x-ray spectra from jem-x1 and ibis/isgri data. for each source,x-ray spectra from different states were fitted with the recently proposedmodel comptb. the spectra have been fit with a two-comptb model. in all casesthe first comptb describes the dominant part of the spectrum that we interpretas thermal comptonization of soft seed photons (&lt; 1 kev), likely from theaccretion disk, by a 3-5 kev corona. in all cases, this component does notevolve much in terms of comptonization efficiency, with the system convergingto thermal equilibrium for increasing accretion rate. the second comptb variesmore dramatically spanning from bulk plus thermal comptonization of blackbodyseed photons to the blackbody emission alone. these seed photons (r &lt; 12 km,kt_s &gt; 1 kev), likely from the neutron star and the innermost part of thesystem, the transition layer, are comptonized by matter in a converging flow.the presence and nature of this second comptb component (be it a pure blackbodyor comptonized) are related to the inner local accretion rate which caninfluence the transient behaviour of the hard tail: high values of accretionrates correspond to an efficient bulk comptonization process (bulk parameterdelta &gt; 0) while even higher values of accretion rates suppress thecomptonization, resulting in simple blackbody emission (delta=0).

1003.0317	suzaku observation of grs 1915+105: evolution of accretion disc  structure during limit-cycle oscillation	we present results from the suzaku observation of the microquasar grs1915+105 performed during the 2005 october multiwavelength campaign. the datainclude both stable state (class \chi) and limit-cycle oscillation (class\theta). correct interstellar absorption as well as effects of dust scatteringare fully taken into account in the spectral analysis. the energy spectra inthe 2-120 kev band in both states are all dominated by strong comptonization ofdisk photons by an optically thick (\tau ~7-10) and low temperature (t_e ~2-3kev) hybrid plasmas containing non-thermal electrons produced with 10-60% ofthe total power input. absorption lines of highly ionized fe ions detectedduring the oscillation indicate that a strong disk wind is developed. theionization stage of the wind correlates with the x-ray flux, supporting thephotoionization origin. the iron-k emission line shows a strong variabilityduring the oscillation; the reflection is strongest during the dip butdisappears during the flare. we interpret this as evidence for "self-shielding"that the comptonizing corona becomes geometrically thick in the flare phase,preventing photons from irradiating the outer disk. the low-temperature andhigh luminosity disk emission suggests that the disk structure is similar tothat in the very high state of canonical black hole binaries. the spectralvariability during the oscillation is explained by the change of the diskgeometry and of the physical parameters of comptonizing corona, particularlythe fractional power supplied to the acceleration of non-thermal particles.

1004.3032	long-term multi-wavelength studies of grs 1915+105 i. a high-energy and  mid-infrared focus with rxte, integral, and spitzer	to date, mid-infrared properties of galactic black hole binaries have barelybeen investigated in the framework of multi-wavelength campaigns. yet, studiesin this spectral domain are crucial to get complementary information on thepresence of dust and/or on the physical processes such as dust heating andthermal bremsstrahlung. here, we report a long-term multi-wavelength study ofthe microquasar grs 1915+105. on the one hand, we aimed at understanding theorigins of the mid-infrared emission, and on the other hand, at searching forcorrelation with the high-energy and/or radio activities. we observed thesource at several epochs between 2004 and 2006 with the photometer irac andspectrometer irs, both mounted on the spitzer space telescope. when available,we completed our set of data with quasi-simultaneous rxte and integralhigh-energy and/or ryle radio observations from public archives. we thenstudied the mid-infrared environment and activities of grs 1915+105 throughspectral analysis and broad band fitting of its radio to x-ray spectral energydistributions. we detected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules in all butone irs spectra of grs 1915+105 which unambiguously proves the presence of adust component, likely photoionised by the high-energy emission. we also arguethat this dust is distributed in a disc-like structure heated by the companionstar, as observed in some herbig ae/be and isolated cool giant stars. moreover,we show that some of the soft x-ray emission emanating from the inner regionsof the accretion disc is reprocessed and thermalised in the outer part. thisleads to a mid-infrared excess that is very likely correlated to the soft x-rayemission. we exclude thermal bremsstrahlung as contributing significantly inthis spectral domain.

0708.2605	the properties of the young stellar populations in powerful radio  galaxies at low and intermediate redshifts	abridged. we present high-quality optical spectra for 12 powerful radiosources at low and intermediate redshifts (z &lt; 0.7) that show evidence for asubstantial uv excess. these data were taken using the wht and vlt to determinethe detailed properties of the young stellar populations (ysps) in the hostgalaxies as part of a larger project to investigate evolutionary scenarios forthe agn host galaxies. the results of our spectral synthesis model fits to thespectra highlight the importance of taking into account agn-related components(emission lines, nebular continuum, scattered light) and reddening of thestellar populations in studies of this type. it is also clear that carefulexamination of the fits to the spectra, as well consideration of auxilarypolarimetric and imaging data, are required to avoid degeneracies in the modelsolutions. in 3/12 sources in our sample we find broad permitted linecomponents, and a combination of agn-related continuum components and an old(12.5 gyr) stellar population provides an adequate fit to the data. in theremaining 9 sources we find strong evidence for ysps. in contrast to somerecent studies that suggest relatively old post-starburst ages for the ysps inradio galaxies (0.3-2.5 gyr), we deduce a wide range of ages for the ysps inour sample objects (0.02-1.5 gyr), with ~50% of the sample showing evidence foryoung ysp ages (&lt;~0.1 gyr) in their nuclear regions. the nuclear ysps are oftensignificantly reddened (0.2 &lt; e(b-v) &lt; 1.4) and make up a substantial fraction(~1-35%) of the total stellar mass in the regions sampled by the spectroscopicslits. moreover, in all the cases in which we have sufficient spatialresolution we find that the uv excess is extended across the full measureableextent of the galaxy (typically 5-30 kpc), suggesting galaxy-wide starbursts.

1009.5330	a microquasar classification from a disk instability perspective	the spectacular variability of microquasars has led to a long string ofefforts in order to classify their observed behaviors in a few states. theprogress made in the understanding of the quasi-periodic oscillations observedin these objects now makes it possible to develop a new way to find order intheir behavior, based on the theorized physical processes associated with theseoscillations. this will also have the interest of reuniting microquasars in asingle classification based on the physical processes at work and thereforeindependent of their specificities (mass, variation timescale, outbursthistory, etc.). this classification is aimed to be a tool to further ourunderstanding of microquasars behavior and not to replace phenomenologicalstates. we start by considering three instabilities that can cause accretion inthe disk. we compare the conditions for their development, and thequasi-periodic oscillations they can be expected to produce, with the spectralstates in which these quasi-periodic oscillations are observed and sometimescoexist. from the three instabilities that we proposed to explain the threestates of grs 1915+105 we actually found the theoretical existence of fourstates. we compared those four states with observations and also how those fourstates can be seen in a model-independent fashion. those four state can be usedto find an order in microquasar observations, based on the properties of thequasi-periodic oscillations and the physics of the associated instabilities.

1101.5159	radiatively efficient accreting black holes in the hard state: the case  study of h1743-322	in recent years, much effort has been devoted to unraveling the connectionbetween the accretion flow and the jets in accreting compact objects. in thepresent work, we report new constraints on these issues, through the long termstudy of the radio and x-ray behaviour of the black hole candidate h1743-322.this source is known to be one of the `outliers' of the universal radio/x-raycorrelation, i.e. a group of accreting stellar-mass black holes displayingfainter radio emission for a given x-ray luminosity than expected from thecorrelation. our study shows that the radio and x-ray emission of h1743-322 arestrongly correlated at high luminosity in the hard spectral state. however,this correlation is unusually steep for a black hole x-ray binary: b ~ 1.4(with l_{radio} \propto l_{x}^{b}). below a critical luminosity, thecorrelation becomes shallower until it rejoins the standard correlation with b~ 0.6. based on these results, we first show that the steep correlation can beexplained if the inner accretion flow is radiatively efficient during the hardstate, in contrast to what is usually assumed for black hole x-ray binaries inthis spectral state. the transition between the steep and the standardcorrelation would therefore reflect a change from a radiatively efficient to aradiatively inefficient accretion flow. finally, we investigate the possibilitythat the discrepancy between `outliers' and `standard' black holes arises fromthe outflow properties rather than from the accretion flow.

1109.5719	igrj17361-4441: a possible new accreting x-ray binary in ngc6388	igrj17361-4441 is a newly discovered integral hard x-ray transient, locatedin the globular cluster ngc6388. we report here the results of the x-ray andradio observations performed with swift, integral, rxte, and the australiatelescope compact array (atca) after the discovery of the source on 2011 august11. in the x-ray domain, igrj17361-4441 showed virtually constant flux andspectral parameters up to 18 days from the onset of the outburst. thebroad-band (0.5-100 kev) spectrum of the source could be reasonably welldescribed by using an absorbed power-law component with a high energy cut-off(n_h\simeq0.8x10^(22) cm^(-2), {\gamma}\simeq0.7-1.0, and e_cut\simeq25 kev)and displayed some evidence of a soft component below \sim2 kev. no coherenttiming features were found in the rxte data. the atca observation did notdetect significant radio emission from igrj17361-4441, and provided the moststringent upper limit (rms 14.1 {\mu}jy at 5.5 ghz) to date on the presence ofany radio source close to the ngc6388 center of gravity. the improved positionof igrj17361-4441 in outburst determined from a recent target of opportunityobservation with chandra, together with the x-ray flux and radio upper limitsmeasured in the direction of the source, argue against its association with theputative intermediate-mass black hole residing in the globular cluster and withthe general hypothesis that the integral source is a black hole candidate.igrj17361-4441 might be more likely a new x-ray binary hosting an accretingneutron star. the atca radio non-detection also permits us to derive an upperlimit to the mass of the suspected intermediate massive black hole in ngc6388of &lt;600 m\odot. this is a factor of 2.5 lower than the limit reportedpreviously.

1111.5310	supergiant x-ray binaries observed by suzaku	suzaku observations are presented for the high-mass x-ray binaries igrj16207-5129 and igr j17391-3021 (=xte j1739-302). for igr j16207-5129, weprovide the first x-ray broadband (0.5--60 kev) spectrum from which we confirma large intrinsic column density (nh = 1.6e23 /cm2), and we constrain thecutoff energy for the first time (ec = 19 kev). a prolonged (&gt; 30 ks)attenuation of the x-ray flux was observed which we tentatively attribute to aneclipse of the probable neutron star by its massive companion, in a binarysystem with an orbital period between 4 and 9 days, and inclination angles &gt; 50degrees. for igr j17391-3021, we witnessed a transition from quiescence to alow-activity phase punctuated by weak flares whose peak luminosities in the0.5--10 kev band are only a factor of 5 times that of the pre-flare emission.these micro flares are accompanied by an increase in nh which suggests theaccretion of obscuring clumps of wind. we now recognize that these low-activityepochs constitute the most common emission phase for this system, and perhapsin other supergiant fast x-ray transients (sfxts) as well. we close with anoverview of our upcoming program in which suzaku will provide the first everobservation of an sfxt (igr j16479-4514) during a binary orbit enabling us toprobe the accretion wind at every phase.

1202.3984	optical and near-infrared spectroscopy of the black hole gx 339-4: i. a  focus on the continuum in the low/hard and high/soft states	the microquasar gx 339-4, known to exhibit powerful compact jets thatdominate its radio to near-infrared emission, entered an outburst in 2010 forthe fifth time in about fifteen years. an extensive radio to x-raymulti-wavelength campaign was immediately triggered, and we report here oneso/fors2+isaac optical and near-infrared spectroscopic observations, supportedby atca radio and rxte/swift x-ray quasi-simultaneous data. gx 339-4 wasobserved at three different epochs, once in the soft state and twice in thehard state. in the soft state, the optical and near-infrared continuum islargely consistent with the raleigh-jeans tail of a thermal process. as anexplanation, we favour irradiation of the outer accretion disc by its innerregions, enhanced by disc warping. an excess is also present at lowfrequencies, likely due to a m subgiant companion star. during the first hardstate, the optical/near-infrared continuum is well-described by the opticallythin synchrotron emission of the compact jet combined with disc irradiation andperhaps another component peaking in the ultraviolet. the spectral break wherethe jet transits from the optically thick to thin regimes, located below1.20e14 hz, is not detected and the extension of the optically thin synchrotronis consistent with the 3-50 kev spectrum. in contrast, the emission during thesecond hard state is more difficult to understand and points toward a morecomplex jet continuum. in both cases, the near-infrared continuum is found tobe variable at timescales at least as short as 20 s, although thesevariabilities are smoothed out beyond a few hundred seconds. this implies rapidvariations - in flux and frequency - of the location of the spectral break,i.e. dramatic short timescale changes of the physical conditions at the base ofthe jet, such as the magnetic field and/or the base radius.

1209.1497	loft: the large observatory for x-ray timing	the loft mission concept is one of four candidates selected by esa for the m3launch opportunity as medium size missions of the cosmic vision programme. thelaunch window is currently planned for between 2022 and 2024. loft is designedto exploit the diagnostics of rapid x-ray flux and spectral variability thatdirectly probe the motion of matter down to distances very close to black holesand neutron stars, as well as the physical state of ultra-dense matter. theseprimary science goals will be addressed by a payload composed of a large areadetector (lad) and a wide field monitor (wfm). the lad is a collimated (&lt;1degree field of view) experiment operating in the energy range 2-50 kev, with a10 m^2 peak effective area and an energy resolution of 260 ev at 6 kev. the wfmwill operate in the same energy range as the lad, enabling simultaneousmonitoring of a few-steradian wide field of view, with an angular resolution of&lt;5 arcmin. the lad and wfm experiments will allow us to investigate variabilityfrom submillisecond qpo's to year-long transient outbursts. in this paper wereport the current status of the project.

1209.1502	the silicon micro-strip detector plane for the loft/wide field monitor	the main objective of the wide field monitor (wfm) on the loft mission is toprovide unambiguous detection of the high-energy sources in a large field ofview, in order to support science operations of the loft primary instrument,the lad. the monitor will also provide by itself a large number of results onthe timing and spectral behaviour of hundreds of galactic compact objects,active galactic nuclei and gamma-ray bursts. the wfm is based on the codedaperture concept where a position sensitive detector records the shadow of amask projected by the celestial sources. the proposed wfm detector plane, basedon double sided micro-strip silicon detectors (dssd), will allow proper2-dimensional recording of the projected shadows. indeed the positioning of thephoton interaction in the detector with equivalent fine resolution in bothdirections insures the best imaging capability compatible with the allocatedbudgets for this telescope on loft. we will describe here the overallconfiguration of this 2d-wfm and the design and characteristics of the dssddetector plane including its imaging and spectral performances. we will alsopresent a number of simulated results discussing the advantages that thisconfiguration offers to loft. a dssd-based wfm will in particular reducesignificantly the source confusion experienced by the wfm in crowded regions ofthe sky like the galactic center and will in general increase the observatoryscience capability of the mission.

0712.0455	two years of integral monitoring of grs 1915+105 part 2: x-ray  spectro-temporal analysis	(abridged) this is the second paper presenting the results of two years ofmonitoring of grs 1915+105 with \integral and \rxte and the ryle telescope. wepresent the x-ray spectral and temporal analysis of four observations whichshowed strong radio to x-ray correlations. during one observation grs 1915+105was in a steady state, while during the three others it showed cycles of x-raydips and spikes (followed by radio flares). we present the time-resolvedspectroscopy of these cyclesand show that in all cases the hard x-ray component(the comptonized emission from a coronal medium) is suppressed in coincidencewith a soft x-ray spike that ends the cycle. we interpret these results asevidence that the soft x-ray spike is the trigger of the ejection, and that theejected medium is the coronal material. in the steady state observation, thex-ray spectrum is indicative of the hard-intermediate state, with the presenceof a relatively strong emission at 15 ghz. the x-ray spectra are the sum of acomptonized component and an extra power law extending to energies &gt;200 kevwithout any evidence for a cut-off. we observe a possible correlation of theradio flux with that of the power law component, which may indicate that we seedirect emission from the jet at hard x-ray energies. we study the energydependence of a ~4 hz qpo during the hard-intermediate state observation. theqpo-``spectrum'' is well modeled by a power law with a cut-off at an energyabout 11 kev that clearly differs from the relative contribution of thecomptonized component to the overall flux. this may rule out models of globaloscillations of the compton corona.

(b) theshape of power spectra in hard and intermediate states and the normalization inthe soft state are strongly energy dependent in the 2.1-15 kev range. thisemphasizes the need for an energy-dependent treatment of power spectra and acareful consideration of energy- and mass-scaling when comparing thevariability of different source types, e.g., black hole binaries and agn. psdsduring extremely hard and extremely soft states can be easily confused forenergies above ~5 kev in the 0.125-256 hz range. (c) the coherence betweenenergy bands drops during transitions from the intermediate into the soft statebut recovers in the soft state.

1408.6526	the large observatory for x-ray timing	the large observatory for x-ray timing (loft) was studied within esa m3cosmic vision framework and participated in the final down-selection for alaunch slot in 2022-2024. thanks to the unprecedented combination of effectivearea and spectral resolution of its main instrument, loft will study thebehaviour of matter under extreme conditions, such as the strong gravitationalfield in the innermost regions of accretion flows close to black holes andneutron stars, and the supra-nuclear densities in the interior of neutronstars. the science payload is based on a large area detector (lad, 10 m 2effective area, 2-30 kev, 240 ev spectral resolution, 1 deg collimated field ofview) and a widefield monitor (wfm, 2-50 kev, 4 steradian field of view, 1arcmin source location accuracy, 300 ev spectral resolution). the wfm isequipped with an on-board system for bright events (e.g. grb) localization. thetrigger time and position of these events are broadcast to the ground within 30s from discovery. in this paper we present the status of the mission at the endof its phase a study.

1410.2332	discovery of x-ray pulsations from the integral source igr j11014-6103	we report the discovery of psr j1101-6101, a 62.8 ms pulsar in igrj11014-6103, a hard x-ray source with a jet and a cometary tail that stronglysuggests it is moving away from the center of the supernova remnant (snr) msh11-61a at v&gt;1000 km/s. two xmm-newton observations were obtained with the epicpn in small window mode, resulting in the measurement of its spin-downluminosity e_dot = 1.36e36 erg/s, characteristic age tau_c = 116 kyr, andsurface magnetic field strength b_s = 7.4e11 g. in comparison to tau_c, the10-30 kyr age estimated for msh 11-61a suggests that the pulsar was born in thesnr with initial period in the range 54 &lt; p_0 &lt; 60 ms. psr j1101-6101 is theleast energetic of the 15 rotation-powered pulsars detected by integral, andhas a high efficiency of hard x-ray radiation and jet power. we examine theshape of the cometary nebula in a chandra image, which is roughly consistentwith a bow shock at the velocity inferred from the snr age and the pulsar'se-dot. however, its structure differs in detail from the classic bow shock, andwe explore possible reasons for this.

0806.1973	peering through the stellar wind of igr j19140+0951 with simultaneous  integral/rxte observations	we have used the rxte and integral satellites simultaneously to observe thehigh mass x-ray binary igr j19140+0951. the spectra obtained in the 3--80 kevrange have allowed us to perform a precise spectral analysis of the systemalong its binary orbit. the spectral evolution confirms the supergiant natureof the companion star and the neutron star nature of the compact object. usinga simple stellar wind model to describe the evolution of the photoelectricabsorption, we were able to restrict the orbital inclination angle in the range38--75 degrees. this analysis leads to a wind mass-loss rate from the companionstar of ~5x 10e-8 msun/year, consistent with an ob i spectral type. we havedetected a soft excess in at least four observations, for the first time forthis source. such soft excesses have been reported in several hmxbs in thepast. we discuss the possible origin of this excess, and suggest, based on itsspectral properties and occurrences around the superior conjunction, that itmay be explained as the reprocessing of the x-ray emission originating from theneutron star by the surrounding ionised gas.

1512.02805	spectral and timing evolution of the bright failed outburst of the  transient black hole swift j174510.8-262411	we studied time variability and spectral evolution of the galactic black holetransient swift j174510.8-262411 during the first phase of its outburst.integral and swift observations collected from 2012 september 16 until october30 have been used. the total squared fractional rms values did not drop below5% and qpos, when present, were type-c, indicating that the source never madethe transition to the soft-intermediate state. even though the source was verybright (up to 1 crab in hard x-rays), it showed a so called failed outburst asit never reached the soft state. xrt and ibis broad band spectra, wellrepresented by a hybrid thermal/non-thermalcomptonisationmodel, showed physicalparameters characteristic of the hard and intermediate states. in particular,the derived temperature of the geometrically thin disc black body was about 0.6kev at maximum.we found a clear decline of the optical depth of the coronaelectrons (close to values of 0.1), as well as of the total compactness ratiolh/ls. the hard-to-hard/intermediate state spectral transition is mainly drivenby the increase in the soft photon flux in the corona, rather than smallvariations of the electron heating. this, associated with the increasing of thedisc temperature, is consistent with a disc moving towards the compact objectscenario, i.e. the truncated-disc model. moreover, this scenario is consistentwith the decreasing fractional squared rms and increasing of the noise and qpofrequency. in our final group of observations, we found that the contributionfrom the non-thermal comptonisation to the total power supplied to the plasmais 0.59+0.02/-0.05 and that the thermal electrons cool to kte&lt;26 kev.

1512.09149	absorption lines from magnetically-driven winds in x-ray binaries	high resolution x-ray spectra of black hole x-ray binaries (bhbs) showblueshifted absorption lines from disk winds which seem to be equatorial. windsoccur in the softer (disk-dominated) states of the outburst and are lessprominent or absent in the harder (power-law dominated) states. we useself-similar magneto-hydrodynamic (mhd) accretion-ejection models to explainthe disk winds in bhbs. in our models, the density at the base of the outflowfrom the accretion disk is not a free parameter, but is determined by solvingthe full set of dynamical mhd equations. thus the physical properties of theoutflow are controlled by the global structure of the disk. we studieddifferent mhd solutions characterized by different values of (a) the diskaspect ratio ($\varepsilon$) and (b) the ejection efficiency ($p$). we use twokinds of mhd solutions depending on the absence (cold solution) or presence(warm solution) of heating at the disk surface. such heating could be from e.g.dissipation of energy due to mhd turbulence in the disk or from illumination.we use each of these mhd solutions to predict the physical parameters of anoutflow; put limits on the ionization parameter ($\xi$), column density andtimescales, motivated by observational results; and thus select regions withinthe outflow which are consistent with the observed winds. the cold mhdsolutions cannot account for winds due to their low ejection efficiency. butwarm solutions can explain the observed physical quantities in the wind becausethey can have sufficiently high values of $p$ ($\gtrsim 0.1$, implying largermass loading at the base of the outflow). further from our thermodynamicequilibrium curve analysis for the outflowing gas, we found that in the hardstate a range of $\xi$ is thermodynamically unstable, and had to be excluded.this constrain made it impossible to have any wind at all, in the hard state.

astro-ph;0202154	study of the largest multiwavelength campaign of the microquasar grs  1915+105	we present the results from a multiwavelength campaign of grs 1915+105performed from 2000 april 16 to 25. this is one of the largest coordinated setof observations ever performed for this source, covering the wide energy bandin radio (13.3-0.3 cm), near-infrared (j-h-k), x-rays and gamma-rays (from 1kev to 10 mev). during the campaign grs 1915+105 was predominantly in the"plateau" (or low/hard) state but sometimes showed soft x-ray oscillations:before april 20.3, rapid, quasi-periodic (~= 45 min) flare-dip cycles wereobserved. the radio flares observed on april 17 shows frequency- dependent peakdelay, consistent with an expansion of synchrotron-emitting region starting atthe transition from the hard-dip to the soft-flare states in x-rays. on theother hand, infrared flares on april 20 appear to follow (or precede) thebeginning of x-ray oscillations with an inconstant time delay of ~= 5-30 min.this implies that the infrared emitting region is located far from the blackhole by &gt;~ 10e13 cm, while its size is &lt;~ 10e12 cm constrained from the timevariability. we find a good correlation between the quasi-steady flux level inthe near-infrared band and in the x-ray band. from this we estimate that thereprocessing of x-rays, probably occurring in the outer parts of the accretiondisk, accounts for about 20-30% of the observed k magnitude in the plateaustate. the osse spectrum in the 0.05-10 mev band is represented by a singlepower law with a photon index of 3.1 extending to ~1 mev with no cutoff. thepower-law slope above ~30 kev is found to be very similar between differentstates in spite of large flux variations in soft x-rays, implying that theelectron energy distribution is not affected by the change of the state in theaccretion disk.

astro-ph;0202205	energy dependence of a low frequency qpo in grs 1915+105	we analyze a set of three rxte target of opportunity observations of thegalactic microquasar grs 1915+105, observed on april 2000, during amulti-wavelength campaign.  during the three observations, a strong, variable low frequency (2-9 hz)quasi periodic oscillation (hereafter qpo), often referred to as the ubiquitousqpo, is detected together with its first harmonic. we study the spectralproperties of both features, and show that : 1) their frequency variations arebetter correlated with the soft x-ray flux (2-5 kev), favoring thus thelocation of the qpo in the accretion disk; 2) the qpo affects more the hardx-rays, usually taken as the signature of an inverse compton scattering of thesoft photons in a corona; 3) the fundamental and its harmonic do not behave inthe same manner: the fundamental sees its power increase with the energy up to40 kev, whereas the harmonic increases up to $\sim 10$ kev. the resultspresented here could find an explanation in the context of theaccretion-ejection instability, which could appear as a rotating spiral or hotpoint located in the disk, between its innermost edge and the corotationradius. the presence of the harmonic could then be a signature of thenon-linear behavior of the instability. the high-energy (&gt;40 kev) decrease ofthe fundamental would favor an interpretation where most or all of thequasi-periodic modulation at high energies comes, not from the comptonizedcorona as usually assumed, but from a hot point in the optically thick disk

astro-ph;0203324	accretion-ejection instability and qpo in black hole binaries. i.  observations	this is the first of two papers in which we address the physics of thelow-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation (qpo) of x-ray binaries, in particularthose hosting a black hole. we discuss and repeat the recent analysis andspectral modelling of the micro-quasar gro j1655 by sobczak et al (2000,hereafter smr), and compare it with grs 1915; this leads us to confirm andanalyze in more detail the different behavior noted by smr, between gro j1655and other sources, when comparing the correlation between the qpo frequency andthe disk inner radius. in a companion paper (varniere et al., 2002, hereafterpaper ii) we will show that these opposite behaviors can be explained in thecontext of the accretion-ejection instability recently presented by tagger andpellat (1999).  we thus propose that the difference between gro j1655 and other sources comesfrom the fact that in the former, observed in a very high state, the disk innerradius always stays close to the last stable orbit.  in the course of this analysis, we also indicate interesting differencesbetween the source properties, when the spectral fits give an anomalously lowinner disk radius. this might indicate the presence of a spiral shock or a hotpoint in the disk.

astro-ph;0203325	accretion-ejection instability and qpo in black-hole binaries.ii.  relativistic effects	the accretion-ejection instability has been proposed to explain the lowfrequency quasi-periodic oscillation (qpo) observed in low-mass x-ray binaries,in particular black-hole candidates. its frequency, typically a fraction of thekeplerian frequency at the disk inner radius, is exactly in the range indicatedby observations. the variations of the frequency with the disk inner radius(extracted from spectral fits of the x-ray emission) might thus be a usefultest. in this paper we discuss how changes in the rotation curve, due torelativistic effects when the disk approaches the central object, affect thephysics of the instability, and thus this frequency-inner radius relation. wefind that the relationship between the frequency of the mode and the keplerianfrequency at the inner disk radius ($r_{int}$) departs from the one obtained ina keplerian disk, when $r_{int}$ approaches the last stable orbit. this mightagree with the recently published results, showing a discrepancy between thebehavior of the qpo in the micro quasar gro j1655, compared to other sourcessuch as xte j1550 and grs 1915.  in a companion paper (rodriguez et al., 2002, hereafter paper i) we havepresented detailed observational results for gro j1655 and grs 1915. we showhow the opposite correlations found in these sources between the disk colorradius (assumed to be close to its inner radius) and the qpo frequency couldindeed be explained by our theoretical result.

astro-ph;0405398	an x-ray timing study of xte j1550--564: evolution of the low frequency  qpo for the complete 2000 outburst	we report on rxte observations of the microquasar xte j1550 during a ~70 dayoutburst in april-june 2000. we focus here on the temporal properties of thesource and study the behavior of low frequency (0.1-10 hz) quasi periodicoscillations (lfqpo), which seem to be of different types. we focus on theso-called type c (according to the classification of remillard andcollaborators), which corresponds to a strong 0.1-6 hz lfqpo, found to bepresent during at least 17 observations. we find that the frequency of the qpois better correlated with the soft x-ray (&lt; 7 kev) flux than with the hard flux(&gt; 7 kev). if soft x-rays represent the behavior of an accretion disk, therelation shows that the disk may set the lfqpo frequency. in two cases, theidentification of the type of qpo is not straightforward. if the qpos in thosetwo cases are type a (or b), then we may be seeing the qpo type alternatebetween type c and type a (or b), and this may represent some rapid changes inthe physical properties of the accretion flow, before the system stabilizes andslowly decays toward the end of the outburst. on the other hand, if all theqpos are of type c, we may be observing an inversion in the frequency vs. fluxrelation, similar to that seen in gro j1655-40. we discuss the qpo behavior inthe framework of theoretical models.

(2003). the variability pattern, which we name $\xi$, ischaracterized by a pulsing behaviour, consisting of a main pulse and a shorter,softer, and smaller amplitude precursor pulse, on a timescale of 5 minutes inthe jem-x 3-35 kev lightcurve. we also present simultaneous rxte data. from astudy of the individual rxte/pca pulse profiles we find that the rising phaseis shorter and harder than the declining phase, which is opposite to what hasbeen observed in other otherwise similar variability classes in this source.the position in the colour-colour diagram throughout the revolution correspondsto state a (belloni et al. 2000) but not to any previously known variabilityclass. we separated the integral data into two subsets covering the maxima andminima of the pulses and fitted the resulting two broadband spectra with ahybrid thermal--non-thermal comptonization model. the fits show the source tobe in a soft state characterized by a strong disc component below ~6 kev andcomptonization by both thermal and non-thermal electrons at higher energies.

astro-ph;0507378	resolving the hard x-ray emission of gx 5-1 with integral	we present the study of one year of integral data on the neutron star lowmass x-ray binary gx 5-1. thanks to the excellent angular resolution andsensitivity of integral, we are able to obtain a high quality spectrum of gx5-1 from ~5 kev to ~100 kev, for the first time without contamination from thenearby black hole candidate grs 1758-258 above 20 kev. during our observations,gx 5-1 is mostly found in the horizontal and normal branch of its hardnessintensity diagram. a clear hard x-ray emission is observed above ~30 kev whichexceeds the exponential cut-off spectrum expected from lower energies. thisspectral flattening may have the same origin of the hard components observed inother z sources as it shares the property of being characteristic to thehorizontal branch. the hard excess is explained by introducing comptonup-scattering of soft photons from the neutron star surface due to a thin hotplasma expected in the boundary layer. the spectral changes of gx 5-1 downwardalong the "z" pattern in the hardness intensity diagram can be well describedin terms of monotonical decrease of the neutron star surface temperature. thismay be a consequence of the gradual expansion of the boundary layer as the massaccretion rate increases.

astro-ph;0508258	chandra and rxte spectroscopy of the accreting msec pulsar igr  j00291+5934	we report on an observation of the recently discovered accreting millisecondx-ray pulsar igr j00291+5934 performed with the rxte-proportional counter array(pca) and chandra-high energy transmission grating spectrometer (hetgs). therxte data are from a two week follow-up of the source while the chandraobservation took place around the end of the follow-up, about 12 days after thediscovery of the source, when the source flux had decreased already by a factorof ten. the analysis of the chandra data allowed us to extract the most precisex-ray position of igr j00291+5934, ra=00 29 03.08 and dec=+59 34 19.2 (0.6secerror), compatible with the optical and radio ones. we find that the spectra ofigr j00291+5934 can be described by a combination of a thermal component and apower-law. along the outburst detected by pca, the power-law photon index showsno particular trend while the thermal component (~1 kev, interpreted as a hotspot on the neutron star surface) becomes weaker until non-detection. in thesimultaneous observation of the weak chandra/rxte spectrum, there is no moreindication for the ~1 kev thermal component while we detect a colder thermalcomponent (~0.4 kev) that we interpret as the emission from the cold disc. ahint for a 6.4 kev iron line is detected, together with an excess around 6.8kev and absorption feature around 7.1 kev. the latter two features have neverbeen detected in the spectra of accretion-driven millisecond pulsars beforeand, if confirmed, would suggest the presence of an expanding hot corona withhigh outflow velocities.

astro-ph;0508515	discovery and study of the accreting pulsar 2rxp j130159.6-635806	we report on analysis of the poorly studied source 2rxp j130159.6-635806 atdifferent epochs with asca, beppo-sax, xmm-newton, and integral. the sourceshows coherent x-ray pulsations at a period ~700s with an average spin up rateof about dnu/dt ~ 2x10^{-13} hz/s. a broad band (1-60 kev) spectral analysis of2rxp j130159.6-635806 based on almost simultaneous xmm-newton and integral datademonstrates that the source has a spectrum typical of an accretion poweredx-ray pulsar, i.e. an absorbed power law with a high energy cut-off with aphoton index gamma ~ 0.5-1.0 and a cut-off energy of ~25 kev. the long termbehaviour of the source, its spectral and timing properties, tend to indicate ahigh mass x-ray binary with be companion. we also report on the identificationof the likely infrared counterpart to 2rxp j130159.6-635806. the interstellarreddening does not allow us to strongly constrain the spectral type of thecounterpart. the latter is, however, consistent with a be star, the kind ofwhich is often observed in accretion powered x-ray pulsars.

astro-ph;0509851	the broad-band spectrum of cygnus x-1 measured by integral	the integral satellite extensively observed the black hole binary cygnus x-1from 2002 november to 2004 november during calibration, open time and coreprogram (galactic plane scan) observations. these data provide evidence forsignificant spectral variations over the period. in the framework of theaccreting black hole phenomenology, the source was most of the time in the hardstate and occasionally switched to the so-called "intermediate state". usingthe results of the analysis performed on these data, we present and compare thespectral properties of the source over the whole energy range (5 kev - 1 mev)covered by the high-energy instruments on board integral, in both observedspectral states. fe line and reflection component evolution occurs withspectral changes in the hard and soft components. the observed behaviour ofcygnus x-1 is consistent with the general picture of galactic black holes. ourresults give clues to the physical changes that took place in the system (discand corona) at almost constant luminosity during the spectral transitions andprovide new measures of the spectral model parameters. in particular, duringthe intermediate state of 2003 june, we observe in the cygnus x-1 data ahigh-energy tail at several hundred kev in excess of the thermal comptonizationmodel which suggests the presence of an additional non-thermal component.

astro-ph;0511429	integral and xmm-newton observations of the x-ray pulsar igr  j16320-4751/ax j1631.9-4752	we report on observations of the x-ray pulsar igr j16320-4751 (a.k.a. axj1631.9-4752) performed simultaneously with integral and xmm-newton. we refinethe source position and identify the most likely infrared counterpart. oursimultaneous coverage allows us to confirm the presence of x-ray pulsations at~1300 s, that we detect above 20 kev with integral for the first time. thepulse fraction is consistent with being constant with energy, which iscompatible with a model of polar accretion by a pulsar. we study the spectralproperties of igr j16320-4751 during two major periods occurring during thesimultaneous coverage with both satellites, namely a flare and a non-flareperiod. we detect the presence of a narrow 6.4 kev iron line in both periods.the presence of such a feature is typical of supergiant wind accretors such asvela x-1 or gx 301-2. we inspect the spectral variations with respect to thepulse phase during the non-flare period, and show that the pulse is solely dueto variations of the x-ray flux emitted by the source and not to variations ofthe spectral parameters.  our results are therefore compatible with the source being a pulsar in a highmass x-ray binary. we detect a soft excess appearing in the spectra as ablackbody with a temperature of ~0.07 kev. we discuss the origin of the x-rayemission in igr j16320-4751: while the hard x-rays are likely the result ofcompton emission produced in the close vicinity of the pulsar, based on energyargument we suggest that the soft excess is likely the emission by acollisionally energised cloud in which the compact object is embedded.

astro-ph;0511725	bimodal spectral variability of cygnus x-1 in an intermediate state	we report the results of an observation of cygnus x-1 with integral, that wecombine with simultaneous radio observations with the ryle telescope. bothspectral and variability properties of the source indicate that cygnus x-1 wasin an intermediate state. the integral spectrum shows a high-energy cut-off orbreak around 100 kev. the shape of this cut-off differs from pure thermalcomptonisation, suggesting the presence of a non-thermal component at higherenergies.the average broad band spectrum is well represented by hybridthermal/non-thermal comptonisation models. during the 4 day long observationthe source showed an important spectral and flux variability. a principalcomponent analysis demonstrates that most of this variability occurs through 2independent modes. the first mode consists in changes in the overall luminosityon time scale of hours with almost constant spectra that are strikinglyuncorrelated with the variable radio flux. we interpret this variability modeas variations of the dissipation rate in the corona. the second variabilitymode consists in a pivoting of the spectrum around 10 kev. it acts on a longertime-scale: initially soft, the spectrum hardens in the first part of theobservation and then softens again. this pivoting pattern is stronglycorrelated with the radio (15 ghz) emission: radio fluxes are stronger when theintegral spectrum is harder. we propose that the pivoting mode represents a'mini' state transition from a nearly high soft state to a nearly low hardstate, and back. this mini-transition would be caused by changes in the softcooling photons flux in the hot comptonising plasma associated with an increaseof the temperature of the accretion disc. the jet power then appears to beanti-correlated with the disc luminosity and unrelated to the coronal power.

astro-ph;0601241	xmm-newton observations of psr b1259-63 near the 2004 periastron passage	psr b1259-63 is in a highly eccentric 3.4 year orbit with a be star andcrosses the be star disc twice per orbit, just prior to and just afterperiastron. unpulsed radio, x-ray and gamma-ray emission observed from thebinary system is thought to be due to the collision of pulsar wind with thewind of be star. we present here the results of new xmm-newton observations ofthe psr b1259-63 system during the beginning of 2004 as the pulsar approachedthe disc of be star.we combine these results with earlier unpublished x-raydata from bepposax and xmm-newton as well as with asca data. the detailed x-raylightcurve of the system shows that the pulsar passes (twice per orbit) througha well-defined gaussian-profile disk with the half-opening angle (projected onthe pulsar orbit plane) ~18.5 deg. the intersection of the disk middle planewith the pulsar orbital plane is inclined at ~70 deg to the major axis of thepulsar orbit. comparing the x-ray lightcurve to the tev lightcurve of thesystem we find that the increase of the tev flux some 10--100 days after theperiastron passage is unambiguously related to the disk passage. at the momentof entrance to the disk the x-ray photon index hardens from 1.8 up to 1.2before returning to the steeper value 1.5. such behaviour is not easilyaccounted for by the model in which the x-ray emission is synchrotron emissionfrom the shocked pulsar wind. we argue that the observed hardening of the x-rayspectrum is due to the inverse compton or bremsstrahlung emission from 10-100mev electrons responsible for the radio synchrotron emission.

astro-ph;0607592	average hard x-ray emission from ns lmxbs: observational evidence of  different spectral states in ns lmxbs	we studied and compared the long-term average hard x-ray (&gt;20kev) spectra ofa sample of twelve bright low-mass x-ray binaries hosting a neutron star (ns).our sample comprises the six well studied galactic z sources and six atollsources, four of which are bright ("gx") bulge sources while two are weakerones in the 2-10kev range (h1750-440 and h1608-55). for all the sources of oursample, we analysed available public data and extracted average spectra fromthe ibis/isgri detector on board integral. we can describe all the spectralstates in terms of the bulk motion comptonisation scenario. we find evidencethat bulk motion is always present, its strength is related to the accretionrate and it is suppressed only in the presence of high local luminosity. thetwo low-dim atoll source spectra are dominated by photons up-scatteredpresumably due to dynamical and thermal comptonisation in an optically thin,hot plasma. for the first time, we extend the detection of h1750-440 up to150kev. the z and bright "gx" atoll source spectra are very similar and aredominated by comptonised blackbody radiation of seed photons, presumably comingfrom the accretion disc and ns surface, in an optically thick cloud with plasmatemperature in the range of 2.5-3kev. six sources show a hard tail in theiraverage spectrum: cygx-2 (z), gx340+0 (z), gx17+2 (z), gx5-1 (z), scox-1 (z)and gx13+1 (atoll). this is the first detection of a hard tail in the x-rayspectrum of the peculiar gx13+1. using radio data from the literature we find,in all z sources and bright "gx" atolls, a systematic positive correlationbetween the x-ray hard tail (40-100kev) and the radio luminosity. this suggeststhat hard tails and energetic electrons causing the radio emission may have thesame origin, most likely the compton cloud located inside the ns magnetosphere.

astro-ph;0611064	hard x-ray emission of the microquasar gx 339-4 in the low/hard state	we present the analysis of the high energy emission of the galactic blackhole binary gx 339-4 in a low/hard state at the beginning of its 2004 outburst.the data from 273 ks of integral observations, spread over 4 weeks, areanalyzed, along with the existing simultaneous rxte hexte and pca data. duringthis period, the flux increases by a factor of about 3, while the spectralshape is quite unchanged, at least up to 150 kev. the high energy data allowsus to detect the presence of a high energy cut-off, generally related tothermal mechanisms, and to estimate the plasma parameters in the framework ofthe comptonization models. we found an electron temperature of 60-70 kev, anoptical depth around 2.5, with a rather low reflection factor (0.2-0.4). in thelast observation, we detected a high energy excess above 200 kev with respectto thermal comptonization while at lower energy, the spectrum is practicallyidentical to the previous one, taken just 2 days before. this suggests that thelow and high energy components have a different origin.

astro-ph;0611343	the xmm-newton/integral monitoring campaign of igr j16318-4848	igr j16318-4848 is the prototype and one of the more extreme examples of thenew class of highly obscured galactic x-ray sources discovered by integral. amonitoring campaign on this source has been carried out by xmm-newton andintegral, consisting in three simultaneous observations performed in february,march and august 2004. the long-term variability of the compton-thickabsorption and emission line complexes will be used to probe the properties ofthe circumstellar matter. a detailed timing and spectral analysis of the threeobservations is performed, along with the reanalysis of the xmm-newtonobservation performed in february 2003. the results are compared withpredictions from numerical radiative transfer simulations to derive theparameters of the circumstellar matter. despite the large flux dynamic rangeobserved (almost a factor 3 between observations performed a few months apart),the source remained bright (suggesting it is a persistent source) andcompton-thick (nh &gt;1.2x10^24 cm-2). large equivalent width (ew) emission linesfrom fe kalpha, fe kbeta and ni kalpha were present in all spectra. theaddition of a fe kalpha compton shoulder improves the fits, especially in the2004 observations. sporadic occurrences of rapid x-ray flux risings wereobserved in three of the four observations. the fe kalpha light curve followedthe continuum almost instantaneously, suggesting that the emission lines areproduced by illumination of small-scale optically-thick matter around thehigh-energy continuum source. using the iron line ew and compton shoulder asdiagnostic of the geometry of the matter, we suggest that the obscuring matteris in a flattened configuration seen almost edge-on.

astro-ph;0703043	a description of sources detected by integral during the first 4 years  of observations	parameters from the literature, such as positions, photoelectric absorption(nh), spin and orbital periods, and distances or redshifts, were collected forall ~500 sources detected by integral-isgri so far. we investigate where newand previously-known sources detected by isgri fit in the parameter space ofhigh-energy objects, and we use the parameters to test correlations expectedfrom theoretical predictions. for example, the influence of the local absorbingmatter on periodic modulations is studied for galactic high-mass x-ray binaries(hmxbs) with ob supergiant and be companions. we examine the spatialdistribution of different types of sources in the milky way using variousprojections of the galactic plane, in order to highlight signatures of stellarevolution and to speculate on the origin of the group of sources whoseclassifications are still uncertain. isgri has detected similar numbers ofx-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei (agn). the former group contains newmembers of the class of hmxbs with supergiant stellar companions. thanks tothese additional systems, we are able to show that hmxbs are generallysegregated in plots of intrinsic nh versus the orbital period of the system andversus the spin period of the pulsar, based on whether the companion is a be oran ob supergiant star. we also find a tentative but expected anti-correlationbetween nh and the orbital period, and a possible and unexpected correlationbetween the nh and the spin period. while only a handful of new low-mass x-raybinaries (lmxbs) have been discovered, there are many sources that remainunclassified and they appear to follow a spatial distribution typical ofgalactic sources (especially lmxbs) rather than extragalactic sources.
