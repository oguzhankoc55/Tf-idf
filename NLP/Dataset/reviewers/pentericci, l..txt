0901.2210	the physical properties and evolution of lyalpha emitting galaxies	a significant fraction of high redshift starburst galaxies presents strong lyalpha emission. understanding the nature of these galaxies is important toassess the role they played in the early universe and to shed light on therelation between the narrow band selected lyalpha emitters and the lyman breakgalaxies: are the lyalpha emitters a subset of the general lbg population? ordo they represent the youngest galaxies in their early phases of formation? westudied a sample of uv continuum selected galaxies from z~2.5 to z~6 (u, b, vand i-dropouts) from the goods-south survey, that have been observedspectroscopically. using the goods-music catalog we investigated their physicalproperties, such as total masses, ages, sfrs, extinction etc as determined froma spectrophotometric fit to the multi-wavelength (u band to mid-ir) seds, andtheir dependence on the emission line characteristics. in particular wedetermined the nature of the lbgs with lyalpha in emission and compared them tothe properties of narrow band selected lyalpha emitters. for u and b-dropoutswe also compared the properties of lbgs with and without the lyalpha emissionline.

0901.2898	the fraction of quiescent massive galaxies in the early universe	aims: the aim of this work is to collect a complete, mass--selected sample ofgalaxies with very low specific star formation rate, for a comparison with theprediction of recent theoretical models. method: we use the 24/k flux ratio,complemented by the sed fitting to the full 0.35-8.0 mum spectral distribution,to select quiescent galaxies from z~0.4 to z~4 in the goods--music sample. ourobservational selection can be translated into thresholds on the specific starformation rate sfr/m_*, that can be used to compare with the theoreticalpredictions. results: we find that, in the framework of the well known globaldecline of the quiescent fraction with redshift, a non-negligible fraction~15-20% of massive galaxies with very low specific star formation rate existsup to z~4, including a tail of "red&amp;dead" galaxies with sfr/m_*&lt;10^{-11}/yr.recent theoretical models vary to a large extent in the prediction of thefraction of galaxies with very low specific star formation rates, and areunable to provide a global match to our data.

0901.3540	uncertainties and systematic effects on the estimate of stellar masses  in high z galaxies	we discuss the uncertainties and the systematic effects that exist in theestimates of the stellar masses of high redshift galaxies, using broad bandphotometry, and how they affect the deduced galaxy stellar mass function. weuse at this purpose the latest version of the goods-music catalog. inparticular, we discuss the impact of different synthetic models, of the assumedinitial mass function and of the selection band. using charlot &amp; bruzual 2007and maraston 2005 models we find masses lower than those obtained from bruzual&amp; charlot 2003 models. in addition, we find a slight trend as a function of themass itself comparing these two mass determinations with that from bruzual &amp;charlot 2003 models. as consequence, the derived galaxy stellar mass functionsshow diverse shapes, and their slope depends on the assumed models. despitethese differences, the overall results and scenario remains unchanged. themasses obtained with the assumption of the chabrier initial mass function arein average 0.24 dex lower than those from the salpeter assumption, at allredshifts, causing a shift of galaxy stellar mass function of the same amount.finally, using a 4.5 um-selected sample instead of a ks-selected one, we add anew population of highly absorbed, dusty galaxies at z\simeq 2-3 of relativelylow masses, yielding stronger constraints on the slope of the galaxy stellarmass function at lower masses.

0903.3952	a comprehensive study of large scale structures in the goods-south field  up to z \sim 2.5	the aim of this paper is to identify and study the properties and galacticcontent of groups and clusters in the goods-south field up to z\sim2.5, and toanalyse the physical properties of galaxies as a continuous function ofenvironmental density up to high redshift. we use the deep (z850\sim26),multi-wavelength goods-music catalogue, which has a 15% of spectroscopicredshifts and accurate photometric redshifts for the remaining fraction. onthese data, we apply a (2+1)d algorithm, previously developed by our group,that provides an adaptive estimate of the 3d density field. we support ouranalysis with simulations to evaluate the purity and the completeness of thecluster catalogue produced by our algorithm. we find several high density peaksembedded in larger structures in the redshift range 0.4-2.5. from the analysisof their physical properties (mass profile, m200, \sigmav, lx, u-b vs. bdiagram), we derive that most of them are groups of galaxies, while two arepoor clusters with masses of few times 10^14 mo. for these two clusters wefind, from the chandra 2ms data, an x-ray emission significantly lower thanexpected from their optical properties, suggesting that the two clusters areeither not virialised or gas poor. we also analyse the dependance onenvironment of galaxy colours, luminosities, stellar masses, ages and starformations. we find that galaxies in high density regions are, on average, moreluminous and massive than field galaxies up to z\sim 2. the fraction of redgalaxies increases with luminosity and with density up to z\sim 1.2. at higherz this dependance on density disappears. the variation of galaxy properties asa function of redshift and density suggests that a significant change occurs atz\sim 1.5-2.

0905.0683	star formation and mass assembly in high redshift galaxies	we study the star formation and the mass assembly process of 0.3&lt;=z&lt;2.5galaxies using their ir emission from mips 24um band. we used an updatedversion of the goods-music catalog, extended by the addition of mid-ir fluxes.we compared two different estimators of the star formation rate: the totalinfrared emission derived from 24um, estimated using both synthetic andempirical ir templates, and the multiwavelength fit to the full galaxy sed. forboth estimates, we computed the sfr density and the specific sfr. the two sfrtracers are roughly consistent, given the uncertainties involved. however, theyshow a systematic trend, ir-based estimates exceeding the fit-based ones as thesfr increases. we show that: a) at z&gt;0.3, the sfr is well correlated withstellar mass, and this relationship seems to steepen with redshift (usingir-based sfrs); b) the contribution to the global sfrd by massive galaxiesincreases with redshift up to ~2.5, more rapidly than for galaxies of lowermass, but appears to flatten at higher z; c) despite this increase, the mostimportant contributors to the sfrd at any z are galaxies of about, orimmediately lower than, the characteristic stellar mass; d) at z~2, massivegalaxies are actively star-forming, with a median sfr 300 msun/yr. during thisepoch, they assemble a substantial part of their final stellar mass; e) thessfr shows a clear bimodal distribution. the analysis of the sfrd and the ssfrseems to support the downsizing scenario, according to which high mass galaxieshave formed their stars earlier and faster than their low mass counterparts. acomparison with theoretical models indicates that they follow the globalincrease in the ssfr with redshift and predict the existence of quiescentgalaxies even at z&gt;1.5, but they systematically underpredict the average ssfr.

0909.2853	evidence for a fast evolution of the uv luminosity function beyond  redshift 6 from a deep hawk-i survey of the goods-s field	we perform a deep search for galaxies in the redshift range 6.5&lt;z&lt;7.5, tomeasure the evolution of the number density of luminous galaxies in thisredshift range and derive useful constraints on the evolution of theirluminosity function. we present here the first results of an eso large program,that exploits the unique combination of area and sensitivity provided in thenear-ir by the camera hawk-i at the vlt. we have obtained two hawk-i pointingson the goods south field for a total of 32 observing hours, covering ~90arcmin2. the images reach y=26.7 mags for the two fields. we have used publicacs images in the z band to select z-dropout galaxies with the colour criteriaz-y&gt;1, y-j&lt;1.5 and y-k&lt;2. the other public data in the ubvrijhk bands are usedto reject possible low redshift interlopers. the output has been compared withextensive monte carlo simulations to quantify the observational effects of ourselection criteria as well as the effects of photometric errors. we detect 7high quality candidates in the magnitude range y=25.5-26.7. this intervalsamples the critical range for m* at z&gt;6 (m_1500 ~- 19.5 to -21.5). afteraccounting for the expected incompleteness, we rule out at a 99% confidencelevel a luminosity function constant from z=6 to z=7, even including theeffects of cosmic variance. for galaxies brighter than m_1500=-19.0 we derive aluminosity density rho_uv=1.5^{+2.0}_{-0.9} 10^25 erg/s/hz/mpc3, implying adecrease by a factor 3.5 from z=6 to z~6.8. on the basis of our findings, wemake predictions for the surface densities expected in future surveys surveys,based on ultra-vista, hst-wfc3 or jwst-nircam, evaluating the bestobservational strategy to maximise their impact.

0707.1783	a photometrically detected forming cluster of galaxies at redshift 1.6  in the goods field	we report the discovery of a localized overdensity at z~1.6 in thegoods-south field, presumably a poor cluster in the process of formation. thethree-dimensional galaxy density has been estimated on the basis of wellcalibrated photometric redshifts from the multiband photometric goods-musiccatalog using the (2+1)d technique. the density peak is embedded in the largerscale overdensity of galaxies known to exist at z=1.61 in the area. theproperties of the member galaxies are compared to those of the surroundingfield and we found that the two populations are significantly differentsupporting the reality of the structure. the reddest galaxies, once evolvedaccording to their best fit models, have colors consistent with the redsequence of lower redshift clusters. the estimated m_200 total mass of thecluster is in the range 1.3 x 10^14 - 5.7x 10^14 msun, depending on the assumedbias factor b. an upper limit for the 2-10 kev x-ray luminosity, based on the1ms chandra observations, is l_x=0.5 x 10^43 erg s^-1, suggesting that thecluster has not yet reached the virial equilibrium.

0912.3007	the unusual niv]-emitter galaxy gds j033218.92-275302.7: star formation  or agn-driven winds from a massive galaxy at z=5.56	aims: we investigate the nature of the source gds j033218.92-275302.7atredshift ~ 5.56. methods: the sed of the source is well sampled by 16 bandsphotometry, from uv-optical, near infrared and mid-infrared (mid-ir).thedetection of signal in the mid-ir spitzer/irac bands 5.8, 8.0 um -- where thenebular emission contribution is less effective -- suggests the presence of abalmer break, signature of an underlying stellar population formed at earlierepochs. the optical spectrum shows a clear lya emission line together withsemi-forbidden niv] 1483.3-1486.5 also in emission. results: from the sedfitting and the lya modelling it turns out that the source seems to have anevolved component with stellar mass of ~5 x10^(10) msolar and age ~ 0.4 gyrs,and a young component with an age of ~ 0.01 gyrs and sfr in the range of 30-200msolar yr^(-1). the limits on the effective radius derived from the acs/z850and vlt/ks bands indicate that this galaxy is denser than the local ones withsimilar mass. a relatively high nebular gas column density is favored from thelya line modelling (nhi&gt;=10^(21) cm^(-2)). a vigorous outflow (~ 450 km/s) hasbeen measured from the optical spectrum,consistent with the lya modelling. fromacs observations it turns out that the region emitting lya photons is spatiallycompact and of the same order of the effective radius estimated at the ~1400arest-frame wavelength, whose emission is dominated by the stellar continuumand/or agn. the gas is blown out from the central region,but given the mass ofthe galaxy it is uncertain whether it will pollute the igm to large distances.we argue that a burst of star formation in a dense gas environment is active(possibly containing hot and massive stars and/or a low luminosity agn),superimposed to an already formed fraction of stellar mass (abridged).

1002.2068	physical and morphological properties of z~3 lbgs: dependence on lyalpha  line emission	we investigate the physical and morphological properties of lbgs at z ~2.5 to~3.5, to determine if and how they depend on the nature and strength of thelyalpha emission. we selected u-dropout galaxies from the z-detected goodsmusic catalog, by adapting the classical lyman break criteria on the goodsfilter set. we kept only those galaxies with spectroscopic confirmation, mainlyfrom vimos and fors public observations. using the full multi-wavelength14-bands photometry, we determined the physical properties of the galaxies,through a standard spectral energy distribution fitting with the updatedcharlot &amp; bruzual (2009) templates. we also added other relevant observations,i.e. the 24mu m observations from spitzer/mips and the 2 msec chandra x-rayobservations. finally, using non parametric diagnostics (gini, concentration,asymmetry, m_20 and ellipticity), we characterized the rest-frame uv morphologyof the galaxies. we then analyzed how these physical and morphologicalproperties correlate with the presence of the lyalpha line in the opticalspectra. we find that, unlike at higher redshift, the dependence of physicalproperties on the lyalpha line is milder: galaxies without lyalpha in emissiontend to be more massive and dustier than the rest of the sample, but all otherparameters, ages, sfrs, x-ray emission as well as uv morphology do not dependstrongly on the presence of the line emission. a simple scenario where all lbgshave intrinsically high lyalpha emission, but where dust and neutral hydrogencontent (which shape the final appearance of the lyalpha) depend on the mass ofthe galaxies, is able to reproduce the majority of the observed properties atz~3. some modification might be needed to account for the observed evolution ofthese properties with cosmic epoch, which is also discussed.

1002.4198	a galaxy populations study of a radio-selected protocluster at z~3.1	we present a population study of several types of galaxies within theprotocluster surrounding the radio galaxy mrc0316-257 at z~3.1. in addition tothe known population of ly_alpha emitters (laes) and [oiii] emitters, we usecolour selection techniques to identify protocluster candidates that are lymanbreak galaxies (lbg) and balmer break galaxies (bbgs). the radio galaxy fieldcontains an excess of lbg candidates, with a surface density 1.6\pm0.3 timeslarger than found for comparable blank fields. this surface overdensitycorresponds to an lbg volume overdensity of ~8\pm4. the bbg photometricredshift distribution peaks at the protocluster's redshift, but we detect nosignificant surface overdensity of bbg. this is not surprising because a volumeoverdensity similar to the lbgs would have resulted in a surface density of~1.2 that found in the blank field. this could not have been detected in oursample. masses and star formation rates of the candidate protocluster galaxiesare determined using sed fitting. these properties are not significantlydifferent from those of field galaxies. the galaxies with the highest massesand star formation rates are located near the radio galaxy, indicating that theprotocluster environment influences galaxy evolution at z~3. we conclude thatthe protocluster around mrc0316-257 is still in the early stages of formation.

1011.5500	spectroscopic confirmation of two lyman break galaxies at redshift  beyond 7	we report the spectroscopic confirmation of two lyman break galaxies atredshift &gt; 7. the galaxies were observed as part of an ultra-deep spectroscopiccampaign with fors2 at the eso/vlt for the confirmation of z~7 ``z--banddropout'' candidates selected from our vlt/hawk-i imaging survey. both galaxiesshow a prominent emission line at 9735a and 9858a respectively: the lines havefluxes of ~ 1.6-1.2 x 10^(-17) erg/s/cm2 and exhibit a sharp decline on theblue side and a tail on the red side. the asymmetry is quantitativelycomparable to the observed asymmetry in z ~ 6 ly-alpha lines, where absorptionby neutral hydrogen in the igm truncates the blue side of the emission lineprofile. we carefully evaluate the possibility that the galaxies are instead atlower redshift and we are observing either [oii], [oiii] or h-alpha emission:however from the spectroscopic and the photometric data we conclude that thereare no other plausible identifications, except for ly-alpha at redshift &gt;7,implying that these are two of the most robust redshift determination forgalaxies in the reionization epoch. based on their redshifts and broad--bandphotometry, we derive limits on the star formation rate and on the ultravioletspectral slopes of the two galaxies. we argue that these two galaxies alone areunlikely to have ionized the igm in their surroundings.

1011.6569	a critical analysis of the uv luminosity function at redshift~7 from  deep wfc3 data	the study of the luminosity function (lf) of lyman break galaxies (lbgs) atz=7 is important for ascertaining their role in the reionization of theuniverse. we perform a detailed and critical analysis of the statistical andsystematic errors in the z~7 lf determination: we have assembled a large sampleof candidate lbgs at z~7 from different surveys, spanning a large variety ofareas and depths. in particular, we have combined data from the deep (j&lt;27.4)and ultradeep (j&lt;29.2) surveys recently acquired with the new wfc3 nir cameraon hst, over the goods-ers and the hudf fields, with ground based surveys inwide and shallow areas from vlt and subaru. we have used public acs images inthe z-band to select z-dropout galaxies, and other public data both in the blue(bvi) and in the red bands to reject possible low-redshift interlopers. we havecompared our results with extensive simulations to quantify the observationaleffects of our selection criteria as well as the effects of photometricscatter, color selections or the morphology of the candidates. we have foundthat the number density of faint lbgs at z~7 is only marginally sensitive tothe color selection adopted, but it is strongly dependent from the assumptionmade on the half light distributions of the simulated galaxies, used to correctthe observed sample for incompleteness. the slope of the faint end of the lbgslf has thus a rather large uncertainty, due to the unknown distribution ofphysical sizes of the z~7 lbgs. we conclude that galaxies at z~7 are unable toreionize the universe unless there is a significant evolution in the clumpinessof the igm or in the escape fraction of ionising photons or, alternatively,there is a large population of z~7 lbgs with large physical dimensions butstill not detected by the present observations.

1103.4364	h-alpha emitters in z~2 proto-clusters: evidence for faster evolution in  dense environments	this is a study of h-alpha emitters in two dense galaxy proto-clusterssurrounding radio galaxies at z~2. we show that the proto-cluster surroundingmrc 1138-262 contains 14+/-2 times more h-alpha candidates than the averagefield (9 sigma significance), and the z=2.35 radio galaxy 4c+10.48 issurrounded by 12+/-2 times more emitters than the field (5 sigma), so it isalso likely to reside in a dense proto-cluster environment. we compared theseh-alpha emitters, situated in dense environments, to a control field sampleselected from 3 separate fields forming a total area of 172 arcmin^2. weconstructed and compared h-alpha and rest-frame r continuum luminosityfunctions of the emitters in both environments. the star formation density ison average 13 times greater in the proto-clusters than the field at z~2, so thetotal star formation rate within the central 1.5mpc of the proto-clustersexceeds 3000msun/yr. however, we found no significant difference in the shapeof the h-alpha luminosity functions, implying that environment does notsubstantially affect the strength of the h-alpha line from strongly starforming galaxies. the proto-cluster emitters are typically 0.8mag brighter inrest-frame r continuum than field emitters, implying they are twice as massiveas their field counterparts at the same redshift. we also show theproto-cluster galaxies have lower specific star formation rates than fieldgalaxies, meaning the emitters in the dense environments formed more of theirstars earlier than the field galaxies. we conclude that galaxy growth in theearly universe was accelerated in dense environments, and that cluster galaxiesdiffered from field galaxies even before the cluster had fully formed.

1103.4478	an x-ray underluminous cluster of galaxies in the 4ms cdfs observations	[abridged] we use the large public spectroscopic database available in thegoods-south field to estimate the dynamical mass and the virialization statusof cluster clg 0332-2747 at z=0.734. cluster members selected from theirphotometric redshift are used with spectroscopic ones to analyse the galaxypopulation of the cluster. in the newly released chandra 4ms observations wedetect a faint extended x-ray emission associated to the cluster. finally, wecompare the optical and x-ray properties of clg 0332-2747 with the predictionsof a well tested semianalytic model. we estimate the velocity dispersion andthe virial mass considering all 44 spectroscopic members, or 20 red-sequencemembers only. we obtain sigma_v=634 +/- 105 km/s, m_200=3.07^{+1.57}_{-1.16}~10^{14} m_sun in the former case, and slightly lower values inthe latter case. the cluster appears to have reached the virial equilibrium: itshows a perfectly gaussian velocity distribution and no evidence forsubstructures. clg 0332-2747 contains a high fraction of bright red galaxies,and is dominated by a very massive (1.1 x 10^{12} m_sun) old brightest clustergalaxy (bcg), suggesting that it formed at an early epoch. we detect a faintextended x-ray source centered on the bcg, with a total x-ray luminosity of l_x~ 2 x 10^{42} erg s^-1 (0.1-2.4 kev). this l_x is lower by a factor of ~10-20than expected according to the m-l_x relation. we provide a possibleexplanation of this discrepancy as due to the effects of agn feedback on theicm: the semianalytic model reproduces the m-l_x relation measured from "x-raybright" clusters, and it predicts a high scatter at low masses due to heatingand expulsion of the cluster gas. interestingly, in the model clusters with anevolved galaxy population like clg 0332-2747 present the largest scatter inx-ray luminosity.

1104.1176	a sinfoni view of flies in the spiderweb: a galaxy cluster in the making	the environment of the high-z radio galaxy pks 1138-262 at z~2.2 is a primeexample of a forming galaxy cluster. we use deep sinfoni data to perform adetailed study of the kinematics of the galaxies within 60 kpc of the radiocore and we link this to the kinematics of the protocluster on the megaparsecscale. identification of optical emission lines shows that 11 galaxies are atthe redshift of the protocluster. the density of line emitters is more than anorder of magnitude higher in the core of the protocluster than the larger scaleenvironment. this implies a matter overdensity in the core of delta_m~70 whichis similar to the outskirts of local galaxy clusters. the velocity distributionof the confirmed satellite galaxies shows a broad, double-peaked velocitystructure with sigma=1360+/-206 km/s. a similar broad, double-peakeddistribution was found in a previous study targeting the large scaleprotocluster structure, indicating that a common process is acting on bothsmall and large scales. including all spectroscopically confirmed protoclustergalaxies, a velocity dispersion of 1013+/-87 km/s is found. we show that theprotocluster has likely decoupled from the hubble flow and is a dynamicallyevolved structure. comparison to the millenium simulation indicates that theprotocluster velocity distribution is consistent with that of the most massivehaloes at z~2, but we rule out that the protocluster is a fully virializedstructure based on dynamical arguments and its x-ray luminosity. comparison tomerging haloes in the millennium simulation shows that the structure asobserved in and around the spiderweb galaxy is best interpreted as being theresult of a merger between two massive haloes. we propose that this merger canresult in an increase in star formation and agn activity in the protoclustercore and is possibly an important stage in the evolution of massive cdgalaxies.

1104.5237	a low escape fraction of ionizing photons of l&gt;l* lyman break galaxies  at z=3.3	we present an upper limit for the relative escape fraction (f_{esc}^{rel}) ofionizing radiation at z~3.3 using a sample of 11 lyman break galaxies (lbgs)with deep imaging in the u band obtained with the large binocular camera,mounted on the prime focus of the large binocular telescope. we selected 11lbgs with secure redshift in the range 3.27&lt;z&lt;3.35, from 3 independent fields.we stacked the images of our sources in the r and u band, which correspond toan effective rest-frame wavelength of 1500\aa and 900\aa respectively,obtaining a limit in the u band image of &gt;=30.7(ab)mag at 1 sigma. we derive a1 sigma upper limit of f_{esc}^{rel}~5%, which is one of the lowest valuesfound in the literature so far at z~3.3. assuming that the upper limit for theescape fraction that we derived from our sample holds for all galaxies at thisredshift, the hydrogen ionization rate that we obtain (gamma_{-12}&lt;0.3 s^{-1})is not enough to keep the igm ionized and a substantial contribution to the uvbackground by faint agns is required. since our sample is clearly still limitedin size, larger z~3 lbg samples, at similar or even greater depths arenecessary to confirm these results on a more firm statistical basis.

1106.5495	discovery of a high-z protocluster with tunable filters: the case of  6c0140+326 at z=4.4	we present the first results obtained using a tunable narrowband filter inthe search for high-z protoclusters. using the recently commissioned redtunable filter on the gran telescopio canarias we have searched for lyaemitters in a 75 arcmin^2 field centered on the z=4.413 radio galaxy6c0140+326. with three different wavelength tunings we find a total of 27unique candidate lya emitters. the availability of three different wavelengthtunings allows us to make estimates of the redshifts for each of the objects.it also allows us to separate a possible protocluster from structure in theimmediate foreground. this division shows that the foreground region containssignificantly fewer lya emitters. also, the spatial distribution of the objectsin the protocluster field deviates from a random distribution at the 2.5 sigmalevel. the observed redshift distribution of the emitters is different from theexpected distribution of a blank field at the ~3 sigma level, with the lyaemitters concentrated near the radio galaxy at z&gt;4.38. the 6c0140+326 field isdenser by a factor of 9+/-5 than a blank field, and the number density of lyaemitters close to the radio galaxy is similar to that of the z~4.1 protoclusteraround tnj1338-1942. we thus conclude that there is an overdensity of lyaemitters around the radio galaxy 6c0140+326. this is one of few knownoverdensities at such a high redshift.

(2011), wefind that our data require a change of the neutral hydrogen fraction of theorder delta chi_{hi} ~ 0.6 in a time delta z ~ 1, provided that the escapefraction does not increase dramatically over the same redshift interval.

1109.1757	the blue uv slopes of z~4 lyman break galaxies: implications for the  corrected star formation rate density	we plan to analyse dust extinction in lyman break galaxies (lbgs) byintroducing a new and more reliable approach to their selection and to thecharacterization of their distribution of uv slopes beta, using deep ir imagesfrom hst. we exploit deep wfc3 ir observations of the ers and hudf fields overgoods-south, combined with hst-acs optical data, to select z~4 lbgs through anew (b-v) vs. (v-h) colour diagram. the uv slope of the selected galaxies isrobustly determined by a linear fit over their observed i, z, y, j magnitudes,coherently with the original definition of beta. the same fit is used todetermine their rest-frame uv magnitudes m1600 through a simple interpolation.we estimate the effect of observational uncertainties with detailed simulationsthat we also exploit, under a parametric maximum-likelihood approach, toconstrain the probability density function of uv slopes pdf(beta) as a functionof rest-frame magnitude. we find 142 and 25 robust lbgs in the ers and hudffields respectively, limiting our sample to s/n(h)&gt;10 objects. our newlydefined criteria improve the selection of z~4 lbgs and allow us to exclude redinterlopers at lower redshift, especially z~3-3.5 objects. we find that z~4lbgs are characterized by blue uv slopes, suggesting a low dust extinction: alll&lt;l* galaxies have an average uv slope &lt;beta&gt;\simeq-2.1, while brighter objectsonly are slightly redder (&lt;beta&gt; -1.9). we find an intrinsic dispersion ~ 0.3for pdf(beta) at all magnitudes. the sfrd at z~4 corrected according to theseestimates turns out to be lower than previously found: log(sfrd)\simeq-1.09m_sun/yr/mpc^3. finally, we discuss how the uv slope of z~4 galaxies changes asa function of the dust-corrected uv magnitude (i.e. sfr) showing that mostgalaxies with a high sfr (&gt; 80 m_sun/yr) are highly extincted objects.[abridged]

1111.5728	the evolving slope of the stellar mass function at 0.6 &lt;= z &lt; 4.5 from  deep wfc3 data	we used early release science (ers) observations taken with the wide fieldcamera 3 (wfc3) in the goods-s field to study the galaxy stellar mass function(gsmf) at 0.6&lt;=z&lt;4.5. deep wfc3 near-ir data (for y as faint as 27.3, j and has faint as 27.4 ab mag at 5 sigma), as well as deep ks (as faint as 25.5 at 5sigma) hawk-i band data, provide an exquisite data set with which determine inan unprecedented way the low-mass end of the gsmf, allowing an accurate probeof masses as low as m~7.6 10^9 msun at z~3. although the area used isrelatively small (~33 arcmin^2), we found generally good agreement withprevious studies on the entire mass range. our results show that the slope ofthe faint-end increases with redshift, from alpha=-1.44+/-0.03 at z~0.8 toalpha=-1.86+/-0.16 at z~3, although indications exist that it does not steepenfurther between z~3 and z~4. this result is insensitive to any uncertainty inthe m* parameter. the steepness of the gsmf faint-end solves the well-knowndisagreement between the stellar mass density (smd) and the integrated starformation history at z&gt;2. however, we confirm the that there appears to be anexcess of integrated star formation with respect to the smd at z&lt;2, by a factorof ~2-3. our comparison of the observations with theoretical predictions showsthat the models forecast a greater abundance of low mass galaxies, at least upto z~3, as well as a dearth of massive galaxies at z~4 with respect to thedata, and that the predicted smd is generally overestimated at z&lt;~2.

0710.3704	the red and blue galaxy populations in the goods field: evidence for an  excess of red dwarfs	we study the evolution of the galaxy population up to z\sim3 as a function ofits colour properties. in particular, luminosity functions and luminositydensities have been derived as a function of redshift for the blue/late andred/early populations. we use data from the goods-music catalogue which havetypical magnitude limits z&lt;26 and ks&lt;23.5 for most of the sample. about 8% ofthe galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts; the remaining have well calibratedphotometric redshifts derived from the extremely wide multi-wavelength coveragein 14 bands (from the u band to the spitzer 8 \mu m band). we have derived acatalogue of galaxies complete in rest-frame b-band, which has been divided intwo subsamples according to their rest-frame u-v colour (or derived specificstar formation rate, ssfr) properties. we confirm a bimodality in the u-vcolour and ssfr of the galaxy sample up to z\sim 3. this bimodality is used tocompute the lfs of the blue/late and red/early subsamples. the lfs of theblue/late and total samples are well represented by steep schechter functionsevolving in luminosity with increasing redshifts. the volume density of the lfsof the red/early populations decreases with increasing redshift. the shape ofthe red/early lfs shows an excess of faint red dwarfs with respect to theextrapolation of a flat schechter function and can be represented by the sum oftwo schechter functions. our model for galaxy formation in the hierarchicalclustering scenario, which also includes external feedback due to a diffuse uvbackground, shows a general broad agreement with the lfs of both populations,the larger discrepancies being present at the faint end for the red population.hints on the nature of the red dwarf population are given on the basis of theirstellar mass and spatial distributions.

1206.2950	agns as main contributors to the uv ionizing emissivity at high  redshifts: predictions from a lambda-cdm model with linked agn/galaxy  evolution	we have evaluated the contribution of the agn population to the ionizationhistory of the universe based on a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation andevolution in the cdm cosmological scenario. the model connects the growth ofblack holes and of the ensuing agn activity to galaxy interactions. in themodel we have included a self consistent physical description of the escape ofionizing uv photons; this is based on the blast-wave model for the agn feedbackwe developed in a previous paper to explain the distribution of hydrogen columndensities in agns of various redshifts and luminosities, due to absorption bythe host galaxy gas. the model predicts uv luminosity functions for agns whichare in good agreement with those derived from the observations especially atlow and intermediate redshifts (z=3). at higher redshifts (z&gt;5) the model tendsto overestimate the data at faint luminosities. critical biases both in thedata and in the model are discussed to explain such apparent discrepancies. thepredicted hydrogen photoionization rate as a function of redshift is found tobe consistent with that derived from the observations. all that suggests toreconsider the role of the agns as the main driver of the ionization history ofthe universe.

1208.0506	the size-luminosity relation at z=7 in candels and its implication on  reionization	the exploration of the relation between galaxy sizes and other physicalparameters has provided important clues for understanding galaxy formation. weuse the candels deep+wide surveys in the goods-south, uds and egs fields,complemented by data from the hudf09 program, to address the relation betweensize and luminosity at z\sim7. we select 153 z-band drop-out galaxies in sixdifferent fields characterized by a wide combination of depth and arealcoverage, ideally suited to sample without biases the observed size-magnitudeplane. detailed simulations allow us to derive the completeness as a functionof size and magnitude and to quantify measurements errors/biases. we find thatthe half light radius distribution function of z\sim7 galaxies fainter thanj=26.6 is peaked at &lt;0.1 arcsec (or equivalently 0.5 kpc proper), while atbrighter magnitudes high-z galaxies are typically larger than ~0.15 arcsec. wealso find a well defined size-luminosity relation, rh\siml^1/2. we compute theluminosity function in the hudf and p12hudf fields, finding large spatialvariation on the number density of faint galaxies. adopting the sizedistribution and the size-luminosity relation found for faint galaxies at z=7,we derive a mean slope of -1.7\pm0.1 for the luminosity function of lbgs atthis redshift. using this lf, we find that the amount of ionizing photonscannot keep the universe re-ionized if the igm is clumpy (c_hii&gt;3) and thelyman continuum escape fraction of high-z lbgs is relatively low (f_esc&lt;0.3).with future candels data, we can put severe limits to the role of galaxies inthe reionization of the universe.

1208.5780	moons: a multi-object optical and near-infrared spectrograph for the vlt	moons is a new conceptual design for a multi-object optical and near-infraredspectrograph for the very large telescope (vlt), selected by eso for a phase astudy. the baseline design consists of 1000 fibers deployable over a field ofview of 500 square arcmin, the largest patrol field offered by the nasmythfocus at the vlt. the total wavelength coverage is 0.8um-1.8um and tworesolution modes: medium resolution and high resolution. in the mediumresolution mode (r=4,000-6,000) the entire wavelength range 0.8um-1.8um isobserved simultaneously, while the high resolution mode covers simultaneouslythree selected spectral regions: one around the caii triplet (at r=8,000) tomeasure radial velocities, and two regions at r=20,000 one in the j-band andone in the h-band, for detailed measurements of chemical abundances. the graspof the 8.2m very large telescope (vlt) combined with the large multiplex andwavelength coverage of moons - extending into the near-ir - will provide theobservational power necessary to study galaxy formation and evolution over theentire history of the universe, from our milky way, through the redshift desertand up to the epoch of re-ionization at z&gt;8-9. at the same time, the highspectral resolution mode will allow astronomers to study chemical abundances ofstars in our galaxy, in particular in the highly obscured regions of the bulge,and provide the necessary follow-up of the gaia mission. such characteristicsand versatility make moons the long-awaited workhorse near-ir mos for the vlt,which will perfectly complement optical spectroscopy performed by flames andvimos.

1301.6012	co(1-0) detection of molecular gas in the massive spiderweb galaxy (z=2)	the high-redshift radio galaxy mrc 1138-262 (`spiderweb galaxy'; z = 2.16),is one of the most massive systems in the early universe and surrounded by adense `web' of proto-cluster galaxies. using the australia telescope compactarray, we detected co(1-0) emission from cold molecular gas -- the rawingredient for star formation -- across the spiderweb galaxy. we infer amolecular gas mass of m(h2) = 6x10^10 m(sun) (for m(h2)/l'(co)=0.8). while thebulk of the molecular gas coincides with the central radio galaxy, there areindications that a substantial fraction of this gas is associated withsatellite galaxies or spread across the inter-galactic medium on scales of tensof kpc. in addition, we tentatively detect co(1-0) in the star-formingproto-cluster galaxy hae 229, 250 kpc to the west. our observations areconsistent with the fact that the spiderweb galaxy is building up its stellarmass through a massive burst of widespread star formation. at maximum starformation efficiency, the molecular gas will be able to sustain the currentstar formation rate (sfr ~ 1400 m(sun)/yr, as traced by seymour et al.) forabout 40 myr. this is similar to the estimated typical lifetime of a majorstarburst event in infra-red luminous merger systems.

1302.2861	the evolution of the agn content in groups up to z~1	determining the agn content in structures of different mass/velocitydispersion and comparing them to higher mass/lower redshift analogs isimportant to understand how the agn formation process is related toenvironmental properties. we use our well-tested cluster finding algorithm toidentify structures in the goods north and south fields, exploiting theavailable spectroscopic redshifts and accurate photometric redshifts. weidentify 9 structures in goods-south (presented in a previous paper) and 8 newstructures in goods-north. we only consider structures where at least 2/3 ofthe members brighter than m_r=-20 have a spectroscopic redshift. for thosegroup members that coincide with x-ray sources in the 4 and 2 msec chandrasource catalogs respectively, we determine if the x-ray emission originatesfrom agn activity or it is related to the galaxies' star-formation activity. wefind that the fraction of agn with log l_h &gt; 42 erg/s in galaxies with m_r &lt;-20 is on average 6.3+-1.3%, much higher than in lower redshift groups ofsimilar mass and more than double the fraction found in massive clusters at asimilarly high redshift. we then explore the spatial distribution of agn in thestructures and find that they preferentially populate the outer regions. thecolors of agn host galaxies in structures tend to be confined to the greenvalley, thus avoiding the blue cloud and, partially, also the red-sequence,contrary to what happens in the field. we finally compare our results to thepredictions of two sets of semi analytic models to investigate the evolution ofagn and evaluate potential triggering and fueling mechanisms. the outcome ofthis comparison attests the importance of galaxy encounters, not necessarilyleading to mergers, as an efficient agn triggering mechanism.

1304.4622	serendipitous discovery of a massive cd galaxy at z=1.096: implications  for the early formation and late evolution of cd galaxies	we have made a serendipitous discovery of a massive cd galaxy at z=1.096 in acandidate rich cluster in the hudf area of goods-south. this brightest clustergalaxy is the most distant cd galaxy confirmed to date. ultra-deep hst/wfc3images reveal an extended envelope starting from ~10 kpc and reaching ~70 kpcin radius along the semi-major axis. the spectral energy distributions indicatethat both its inner component and outer envelope are composed of an old,passively-evolving stellar population. the cd galaxy lies on the same mass-sizerelation as the bulk of quiescent galaxies at similar redshifts. the cd galaxyhas a higher stellar mass surface density but a similar velocity dispersion tothose of more-massive, nearby cds. if the cd galaxy is one of the progenitorsof today's more massive cds, its size and stellar mass have had to increase onaverage by factors of $3.4\pm1.1$ and $3.3\pm1.3$ over the past ~8 gyrs,respectively. such increases in size and stellar mass without being accompaniedby significant increases in velocity dispersion are consistent withevolutionary scenarios driven by both major and minor dry mergers. if such cdenvelopes originate from dry mergers, our discovery of even one example provesthat some bcgs entered the dry merger phase at epochs earlier than z=1. ourdata match theoretical models which predict that the continuance of dry mergersat z&lt;1 can result in structures similar to those of massive cd galaxies seentoday. moreover, our discovery is a surprise given that the extreme depth ofthe hudf is essential to reveal such an extended cd envelope at z&gt;1 and, yet,the hudf covers only a minuscule region of sky. adding that cds are rare, ourserendipitous discovery hints that such cds may be more common than expected.[abridged]

1309.5954	the host galaxy of the z=2.4 radio-loud agn mrc 0406-244 as seen by hst	we present multicolour hubble space telescope images of the powerful z=2.4radio galaxy mrc 0406-244 and model its complex morphology with severalcomponents including a host galaxy, a point source, and extended nebular andcontinuum emission. we suggest that the main progenitor of this radio galaxywas a normal, albeit massive (m ~10^{11} solar masses), star-forming galaxy.the optical stellar disc of the host galaxy is smooth and well described by as\'ersic profile, which argues against a recent major merger, however there isalso a point-source component which may be the remnant of a minor merger. thehalf-light radius of the optical disc is constrained to lie in the range 3.5 to8.2kpc, which is of similar size to coeval star forming galaxies.  biconical shells of nebular emission and uv-bright continuum extend out fromthe host galaxy along the radio jet axis, which is also the minor axis of thehost galaxy. the origin of the continuum emission is uncertain, but it is mostlikely to be young stars or dust-scattered light from the agn, and it ispossible that stars are forming from this material at a rate of200^{+1420}_{-110} solar masses per year.

1311.1921	diffuse optical intracluster light as a measure of stellar tidal  stripping: the cluster cl0024+17 at $z\sim $0.4 observed at lbt	we have evaluated the diffuse intracluster light (icl) in the central core ofthe galaxy cluster cl0024+17 at $z\sim 0.4$ observed with the prime focuscamera (lbc) at lbt. the measure required an accurate removal of the galaxieslight within $\sim 200$ kpc from the center. the residual background intensityhas then been integrated in circular apertures to derive the average iclintensity profile. the latter shows an approximate exponential decline asexpected from theoretical cold dark matter models. the radial profile of theicl over the galaxies intensity ratio (icl fraction) is increasing withdecreasing radius but near the cluster center it starts to bend and thendecreases where the overlap of the halos of the brightest cluster galaxiesbecomes dominant. theoretical expectations in a simplified cdm scenario showthat the icl fraction profile can be estimated from the stripped over galaxystellar mass ratio in the cluster. it is possible to show that the latterquantity is almost independent of the properties of the individual hostgalaxies but mainly depends on the average cluster properties. the predictedicl fraction profile is thus very sensitive to the assumed cdm profile, totalmass and concentration parameter of the cluster. adopting values very similarto those derived from the most recent lensing analysis in cl0024+17 we find agood agreement with the observed icl fraction profile. the galaxy counts in thecluster core have then been compared with that derived from composite clustersamples in larger volumes, up to the clusters virial radius. the galaxy countsin the cl0024+17 core appear flatter and the amount of bending respect to theaverage cluster galaxy counts imply a loss of total emissivity in broadagreement with the measured icl fraction.

1311.4576	metallicity evolution, metallicity gradients and gas fractions at z~3.4	we used near-infrared integral field spectroscopic observations from theamaze and lsd programs to constrain the metallicity in a sample of 40 starforming galaxies at 3&lt;z&lt;5 (most of which at z~3.4). we measure metallicities byexploiting strong emission line diagnostics. we found that a significantfraction of star-forming galaxies at z~3.4 deviate from the fundamentalmetallicity relation (fmr), with a metallicity up to a factor of ten lower thanexpected according to the fmr. this deviation does not correlate with thedynamical properties of the galaxy or with the presence of interactions. toinvestigate the origin of the metallicity deviations in more detail, we alsoinfer information on the gas content, by inverting the schmidt-kennicuttrelation. in agreement with recent co observational data, we found that, incontrast with the steeply rising trend at 0&lt;z&lt;2, the gas fraction in massivegalaxies remains constant, with indication of a marginal decline, at 2&lt;z&lt;3.5.when combined with the metallicity information, we infer that to explain boththe low metallicity and gas content in z~3.4 galaxies, both prominent outflowsand massive pristine gas inflows are needed. in ten galaxies we can alsospatially resolve the metallicity distribution. we found that the metallicitygenerally anticorrelates with the distribution of star formation and with thegas surface density. we discuss these findings in terms of pristine gas inflowstowards the center, and outflows of metal rich gas from the center toward theexternal regions.

1312.6299	characterizing faint galaxies in the reionization epoch: lbt confirms  two l&lt;0.2l* sources at z=6.4 behind the clash/frontier fields cluster  macs0717.5+3745	we report the lbt/mods1 spectroscopic confirmation of two images of faintlyman alpha emitters at $z=6.4$ behind the frontier fields galaxy clustermacsj0717.5+3745. a wide range of lens models suggests that the two images arehighly magnified, with a strong lower limit of mu&gt;5. these are the faintest z&gt;6candidates spectroscopically confirmed to date. these may be also multipleimages of the same z=6.4 source as supported by their similar intrinsicproperties, but the lens models are inconclusive regarding this interpretation.to be cautious, we derive the physical properties of each image individually.thanks to the high magnification, the observed near-infrared (restframeultraviolet) part of the spectral energy distributions and ly-alpha lines arewell detected with s/n(m_1500)&gt;~10 and s/n(ly-alpha)~10-15. adopting mu&gt;5, theabsolute magnitudes, m_1500, and ly-alpha fluxes, are fainter than -18.7 and2.8x10^(-18)erg/s/cm2, respectively. we find a very steep ultraviolet spectralslope beta=-3.0+/-0.5 (f_lambda=lambda^(beta)), implying that these are veryyoung, dust-free and low metallicity objects, made of standard stellarpopulations or even extremely metal poor stars (age&lt;~30myr, e(b-v)=0 andmetallicity 0.0-0.2 z/zsolar). the objects are compact (&lt; 1 kpc^(2)), and witha stellar mass m* &lt; 10^(8) m_solar. the very steep beta, the presence of thely-alpha line and the intrinsic fwhm (&lt;300 km/s) of these newborn objects donot exclude a possible leakage of ionizing radiation. we discuss thepossibility that such faint galaxies may resemble those responsible for cosmicreionization.

1403.0743	constraints on the star-formation rate of z~3 lbgs with measured  metallicity in the candels goods-south field	we analyse 14 lbgs at z~2.8-3.8 constituting the only sample where both aspectroscopic measurement of their metallicity and deep ir observations(candels+hugs survey) are available. fixing the metallicity of populationsynthesis models to the observed values, we determine best-fit physicalparameters under different assumptions about the star-formation history andalso consider the effect of nebular emission. for comparison we determine theuv slope of the objects, and use it to estimate their sfr_uv99 by correctingthe uv luminosity following meurer et al. (1999). a comparison between sfrobtained through sed-fitting (sfr_fit) and the sfr_uv99 shows that the latterare underestimated by a factor 2-10, regardless of the assumed sfh. other sfrindicators (radio, far-ir, x-ray, recombination lines) coherently indicate sfrsa factor of 2-4 larger than sfr_uv99 and in closer agreement with sfr_fit. thisdiscrepancy is due to the solar metallicity implied by the usual beta-a1600conversion factor. we propose a refined relation, appropriate for sub-solarmetallicity lbgs: a1600 = 5.32+1.99beta. this relation reconciles thedust-corrected uv with the sed-fitting and the other sfr indicators. we showthat the fact that z~3 galaxies have sub-solar metallicity implies an upwardrevision by a factor of ~1.5-2 of the global sfrd, depending on the assumptionsabout the age of the stellar populations. we find very young best-fit ages(10-500 myrs) for all our objects. from a careful examination of theuncertainties in the fit and the amplitude of the balmer break we conclude thatthere is little evidence of the presence of old stellar population in at leasthalf of the lbgs in our sample, suggesting that these objects are probablycaught during a huge star-formation burst, rather than being the result of asmooth evolution.

1403.3691	discovery of a rich proto-cluster at z=2.9 and associated diffuse cold  gas in the vimos ultra-deep survey (vuds)	[abridged] we characterise a massive proto-cluster at z=2.895 that we foundin the cosmos field using the spectroscopic sample of the vimos ultra-deepsurvey (vuds). this is one of the rare structures at z~3 not identified aroundagns or radio galaxies, so it is an ideal laboratory to study galaxy formationin dense environments. the structure comprises 12 galaxies with securespectroscopic redshift in an area of 7'x8', in a z bin of dz=0.016. themeasured galaxy number overdensity is delta_g=12+/-2. this overdensity hastotal mass of m~8.1x10^(14)m_sun in a volume of 13x15x17 mpc^3. simulationsindicate that such an overdensity at z~2.9 is a proto-cluster that willcollapse in a cluster of total mass m~2.5x10^(15)m_sun at z=0. we compare theproperties of the galaxies within the overdensity with a control sample at thesame z but outside the overdensity. we did not find any statisticallysignificant difference between the properties (stellar mass, sfr, ssfr, nuv-r,r-k) of the galaxies inside and outside the overdensity. the stacked spectrumof galaxies in the overdensity background shows a significant absorptionfeature at the wavelength of lya redshifted at z=2.895 (lambda=4736 a), with arest frame ew = 4+/- 1.4 a. stacking only background galaxies withoutintervening sources at z~2.9 along their line of sight, we find that thisabsorption feature has a rest frame ew of 10.8+/-3.7 a, with a detection s/n of~4. these ew values imply a high column density (n(hi)~3-20x10^(19)cm^(-2)),consistent with a scenario where such absorption is due to intervening cold gasstreams, falling into the halo potential wells of the proto-cluster galaxies.however, we cannot exclude the hypothesis that this absorption is due to thediffuse gas within the overdensity.

1403.4230	vimos ultra-deep survey (vuds): witnessing the assembly of a massive  cluster at z~3.3	using new spectroscopic observations obtained as part of the vimos ultra-deepsurvey (vuds), we perform a systematic search for overdense environments in theearly universe ($z&gt;2$) and report here on the discovery of cl j0227-0421, amassive protocluster at $z=3.29$. this protocluster is characterized by boththe large overdensity of spectroscopically confirmed members,$\delta_{gal}=10.5\pm2.8$, and a significant overdensity in photometricredshift members. the halo mass of this protocluster is estimated, by a varietyof methods, to be roughly $3\times10^{14}$ $\mathcal{m}_{\odot}$ at $z\sim3.3$,which, evolved to $z=0$ results in a halo mass rivaling or exceeding that ofthe coma cluster. the properties of 19 spectroscopically confirmed membergalaxies are compared with a large sample of vuds/vvds galaxies in lowerdensity field environments at similar redshifts. we find tentative evidence foran excess of redder, brighter, and more massive galaxies within the confines ofthe protocluster relative to the field population, which suggests that we maybe observing the beginning of environmentally-induced quenching. the propertiesof these galaxies are investigated, including a discussion of the brightestprotocluster galaxy which appears to be undergoing vigorous coeval nuclear andstarburst activity. the remaining member galaxies appear to havecharacteristics which are largely similar to the field population. though wefind weaker evidence of the suppression of the median star formation ratesamongst and differences in stacked spectra of member galaxies with respect tothe field, we defer any conclusions of these trends to future work with theensemble of protostructures that are found in the full vuds sample.

1403.5466	new observations of z~7 galaxies: evidence for a patchy reionization	we present new results from our search for z~7 galaxies from deepspectroscopic observations of candidate z-dropouts in the candels fields.despite the extremely low flux limits achieved by our sensitive observations,only 2 galaxies have robust redshift identifications, one from its lyalphaemission line at z=6.65, the other from its lyman-break, i.e. the continuumdiscontinuity at the lyalpha wavelength consistent with a redshift 6.42, butwith no emission line. in addition, for 23 galaxies we present deep limits inthe lyalpha ew derived from the non detections in ultra-deep observations.using this new data as well as previous samples, we assemble a total of 68candidate z~7 galaxies with deep spectroscopic observations, of which 12 have aline detection. with this much enlarged sample we can place solid constraintson the declining fraction of ly$\alpha$ emission in z~7 lyman break galaxiescompared to z~6, both for bright and faint galaxies. applying a simpleanalytical model, we show that the present data favor a patchy reionizationprocess rather than a smooth one.

1403.6470	evidence of very low metallicity and high ionization state in a strongly  lensed, star-forming dwarf galaxy at z=3.417	we investigate the gas-phase metallicity and lyman continuum (lyc) escapefraction of a strongly gravitationally lensed, extreme emission-line galaxy atz=3.417, j1000+0221s, recently discovered by the candels team. we deriveionization and metallicity sensitive emission-line ratios from h+k bandlbt/luci medium resolution spectroscopy. j1000+0221s shows high ionizationconditions, as evidenced by its enhanced [oiii]/[oii] and [oiii]/hbeta ratios.consistently, strong-line methods based on the available line ratios suggestthat j1000+0221s is an extremely metal-poor galaxy, with a metallicity of12+log(o/h) &lt; 7.44 (&lt; 5% solar), placing it among the most metal-poorstar-forming galaxies at z &gt; 3 discovered so far. in combination with its lowstellar mass (2x10^8 msun) and high star formation rate (5 msun/yr), themetallicity of j1000+0221s is consistent with the extrapolation to low massesof the mass-metallicity relation traced by lyman-break galaxies at z &gt; 3, butit is 0.55 dex lower than predicted by the fundamental metallicity relation atz &lt; 2.5. these observations suggest the picture of a rapidly growing galaxy,possibly fed by the massive accretion of pristine gas. additionally, deeplbt/lbc in the ugr bands are used to derive a limit to the lyc escape fraction,thus allowing us to explore for the first time the regime of sub-l* galaxies atz &gt; 3. we find a 1sigma upper limit to the escape fraction of 23%, which adds anew observational constraint to recent theoretical models predicting thatsub-l* galaxies at high-z have high escape fractions and thus are theresponsible for the reioization of the universe.

1406.3037	galaxy population properties of the massive x-ray luminous galaxy  cluster xdcp j0044.0-2033 at z=1.58: red-sequence formation, massive galaxy  assembly, and central star formation activity	we investigate various galaxy population properties of the massive x-rayluminous galaxy cluster xdcp j0044.0-2033 at z=1.58, which constitutes the mostextreme matter density peak at this redshift currently known. we analyze deepvlt/hawk-i nir data in the j- and ks-bands, complemented by subaru imaging in iand v, spitzer observations at 4.5 micron, and new spectroscopic observationswith vlt/fors2. we detect a cluster-associated excess population of about 90galaxies, which follows a centrally peaked, compact nfw galaxy surface densityprofile with a concentration of c200~10. based on the spitzer 4.5 micronimaging data, we measure a stellar mass fraction of fstar,500=(3.3+-1.4)%consistent with local values. the total j- and ks-band galaxy luminosityfunctions of the core region yield characteristic magnitudes j* and ks*consistent with expectations from simple z_f=3 burst models. however, adetailed look at the morphologies and color distributions of thespectroscopically confirmed members reveals that the most massive galaxies areundergoing a very active mass assembly epoch through merging processes.consequently, the bright end of the cluster red-sequence is not in place, whileat intermediate magnitudes [ks*,ks*+1.6] a red-locus population is present,which is then sharply truncated at magnitudes fainter than ks*+1.6. thedominant cluster core population comprises post-quenched galaxies transitioningtowards the red-sequence at intermediate magnitudes, while additionally asignificant blue cloud population of faint star-forming galaxies is presenteven in the densest central regions. our observations lend support to thescenario in which the dominant effect of the dense z~1.6 cluster environment isan accelerated mass assembly timescale through merging activity that isresponsible for driving core galaxies across the mass quenching threshold oflog(mstar/msun)~10.4.

1406.6369	science case and requirements for the mosaic concept for a multi-object  spectrograph for the european extremely large telescope	over the past 18 months we have revisited the science requirements for amulti-object spectrograph (mos) for the european extremely large telescope(e-elt). these efforts span the full range of e-elt science and include inputfrom a broad cross-section of astronomers across the eso partner countries. inthis contribution we summarise the key cases relating to studies ofhigh-redshift galaxies, galaxy evolution, and stellar populations, with a moreexpansive presentation of a new case relating to detection of exoplanets instellar clusters. a general requirement is the need for two observational modesto best exploit the large (&gt;40 sq. arcmin) patrol field of the e-elt. the firstmode ('high multiplex') requires integrated-light (or coarsely resolved)optical/near-ir spectroscopy of &gt;100 objects simultaneously. the second ('highdefinition'), enabled by wide-field adaptive optics, requiresspatially-resolved, near-ir of &gt;10 objects/sub-fields. within the context ofthe conceptual study for an elt-mos called mosaic, we summarise the top-levelrequirements from each case and introduce the next steps in the design process.

1407.3787	a 52 hours vlt/fors2 spectrum of a bright z~7 hudf galaxy: no ly-alpha  emission	we aim to determine the redshift of gds-1408, the most solid z~7 galaxycandidate lying in the hubble ultra deep field. we have used all the vltspectra of gds-1408 collected by us and two other groups with fors2 at vlt inthe last five years, for a total integration time of 52hr. the combinedspectrum is the deepest ever obtained of a galaxy in the reionization epoch. wedo not detect any emission line or continuum over the whole wavelength range,up to 10100a. based on an accurate set of simulations, we are able to put astringent upper limit of f(lya)&lt;3x10^(-18) erg/s/cm2 at 3-9 sigma in theexplored wavelength range, corresponding to a rest-frame equivalent widthew&lt;9a. combining this limit with the sed modelling we refine the redshift to bez=6.82+/- 0.1 (1-sigma). the same sed fitting indicates that gds-1408 isrelatively extinct (a1600~1) with a dust corrected star formation rate of ~ 20msol/yr. the comparison between the un-attenuated equivalent width predicted bythe case-b recombination theory and the observed upper limit, provides a limiton the effective lya escape fraction of f_(esc)^(eff)(lya)&lt;8%. even though wecannot rule out a major contribution of the inter/circum galactic medium indamping the line, a plausible interpretation is that gds-1408 is moderatelyevolved and contains sufficient gas and dust to attenuate the lya emission,before it reaches the intergalactic medium. the redshift confirmation of eventhe best z~7 candidates is very hard to achieve (unless the lya or unusuallystrong rest-uv nebular emission lines are present) with the current generationof 8-10m class telescopes. we show that both jwst and e-elt will be necessaryto make decisive progresses. currently, the increased redshift accuracyobtained with this kind of analysis makes alma an interesting option for theredshift confirmation.

1409.7083	a mass threshold in the number density of passive galaxies at z$\sim$2	the process that quenched star formation in galaxies at intermediate and highredshift is still the subject of considerable debate. one way to investigatethis puzzling issue is to study the number density of quiescent galaxies atz~2, and its dependence on mass. here we present the results of a new studybased on very deep ks-band imaging (with the hawk-i instrument on the vlt) oftwo hst candels fields (the ukidss ultra-deep survey (uds) field andgoods-south). the new hawk-i data (taken as part of the hugs vlt large program)reach detection limits of ks&gt;26 (ab mag). we select a sample ofpassively-evolving galaxies in the redshift range 1.4&lt;z&lt;2.5. thanks to thedepth and large area coverage of our imaging, we have been able to extend theselection of quiescent galaxies a magnitude fainter than previous analyses.through extensive simulations we demonstrate, for the first time, that theobserved turn-over in the number of quiescent galaxies at k&gt;22 is real. thishas enabled us to establish unambiguously that the number counts of quiescentgalaxies at z~2 flatten and slightly decline at magnitudes fainter thanks~22(ab mag.). we show that this trend corresponds to a stellar mass threshold$m_*10^{10.8}\,{\rm m_{\odot}}$ below which the mechanism that halts the starformation in high-redshift galaxies seems to be inefficient. finally we comparethe observed pbzk number counts with those of quiescent galaxies extracted fromfour different semi-analytic models. we find that none of the models provides astatistically acceptable description of the number density of quiescentgalaxies at these redshifts. we conclude that the mass function of quiescentgalaxies as a function of redshift continues to present a key and demandingchallenge for proposed models of galaxy formation and evolution.

1411.5688	the evolution of clustering length, large-scale bias and host halo mass  at 2&lt;z&lt;5 in the vimos ultra deep survey (vuds)	we investigate the evolution of galaxy clustering for galaxies in theredshift range 2.0&lt;$z$&lt;5.0 using the vimos ultra deep survey (vuds). we presentthe projected (real-space) two-point correlation function $w_p(r_p)$ measuredby using 3022 galaxies with robust spectroscopic redshifts in two independentfields (cosmos and vvds-02h) covering in total 0.8 deg$^2$. we quantify how thescale dependent clustering amplitude $r_0$ changes with redshift making use ofmock samples to evaluate and correct the survey selection function. using apower-law model $\xi(r) = (r/r_0)^{-\gamma}$ we find that the correlationfunction for the general population is best fit by a model with a clusteringlength $r_0$=3.95$^{+0.48}_{-0.54}$ h$^{-1}$mpc and slope$\gamma$=1.8$^{+0.02}_{-0.06}$ at $z$~2.5, $r_0$=4.35$\pm$0.60 h$^{-1}$mpc and$\gamma$=1.6$^{+0.12}_{-0.13}$ at $z$~3.5. we use these clustering parametersto derive the large-scale linear galaxy bias $b_l^{pl}$, between galaxies anddark matter. we find $b_l^{pl}$ = 2.68$\pm$0.22 at redshift $z$~3 (assuming$\sigma_8$ = 0.8), significantly higher than found at intermediate and lowredshifts. we fit an hod model to the data and we obtain that the average halomass at redshift $z$~3 is $m_h$=10$^{11.75\pm0.23}$ h$^{-1}$m$_{\odot}$. fromthis fit we confirm that the large-scale linear galaxy bias is relatively highat $b_l^{hod}$ = 2.82$\pm$0.27. comparing these measurements with similarmeasurements at lower redshifts we infer that the star-forming population ofgalaxies at $z$~3 should evolve into the massive and bright ($m_r$&lt;-21.5)galaxy population which typically occupy haloes of mass $\langle m_h\rangle$ =10$^{13.9}$ h$^{-1}$ $m_{\odot}$ at redshift $z$=0.

1412.0532	the galaxy stellar mass function at 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5 in the candels/uds,  goods-south, and hudf fields	the galaxy stellar mass function (gsmf) at high-z provides key information onstar-formation history and mass assembly in the young universe. we aimed to usethe unique combination of deep optical/nir/mir imaging provided by hst, spitzerand the vlt in the candels-uds, goods-south, and hudf fields to determine thegsmf over the redshift range 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5. we utilised the hst wfc3/ir nir imagingfrom candels and hudf09, reaching h~27-28.5 over a total area of 369 arcmin2,in combination with associated deep hst acs optical data, deep spitzer iracimaging from the seds programme, and deep y and k-band vlt hawk-i images fromthe hugs programme, to select a galaxy sample with high-quality photometricredshifts. these have been calibrated with more than 150 spectroscopicredshifts in the range 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5, resulting in an overall precision ofsigma_z/(1+z)~0.037. we have determined the low-mass end of the high-z gsmfwith unprecedented precision, reaching down to masses as low as m*~10^9 msun atz=4 and ~6x10^9 msun at z=7. we find that the gsmf at 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5 depends onlyslightly on the recipes adopted to measure the stellar masses, namely thephoto-z, the sfhs, the nebular contribution or the presence of agn on theparent sample. the low-mass end of the gsmf is steeper than has been found atlower redshifts, but appears to be unchanged over the redshift range probedhere. our results are very different from previous gsmf estimates based onconverting uv galaxy luminosity functions into mass functions via tight m/lrelations. integrating our evolving gsmf over mass, we find that the growth ofstellar mass density is barely consistent with the time-integral of the sfrdensity over cosmic time at z&gt;4. these results confirm the unique synergy ofthe candels+hudf, hugs, and seds surveys for the discovery and study ofmoderate/low-mass galaxies at high redshifts.

1412.5180	stellar masses from the candels survey: the goods-south and uds fields	we present the public release of the stellar mass catalogs for the goods-sand uds fields obtained using some of the deepest near-ir images available,achieved as part of the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacysurvey (candels) project. we combine the effort from ten different teams, whocomputed the stellar masses using the same photometry and the same redshifts.each team adopted their preferred fitting code, assumptions, priors, andparameter grid. the combination of results using the same underlying stellarisochrones reduces the systematics associated with the fitting code and otherchoices. thanks to the availability of different estimates, we can test theeffect of some specific parameters and assumptions on the stellar massestimate. the choice of the stellar isochrone library turns out to have thelargest effect on the galaxy stellar mass estimates, resulting in the largestdistributions around the median value (with a semi interquartile range largerthan 0.1 dex). on the other hand, for most galaxies, the stellar mass estimatesare relatively insensitive to the different parameterizations of the starformation history. the inclusion of nebular emission in the model spectra doesnot have a significant impact for the majority of galaxies (less than a factorof 2 for ~80% of the sample). nevertheless, the stellar mass for the subsampleof young galaxies (age &lt; 100 myr), especially in particular redshift ranges(e.g., 2.2 &lt; z &lt; 2.4, 3.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.6, and 5.5 &lt; z &lt; 6.5), can be seriouslyoverestimated (by up to a factor of 10 for &lt; 20 myr sources) if nebularcontribution is ignored.

1502.00640	alma constraints on the faint millimetre source number counts and their  contribution to the cosmic infrared background	we have analysed 18 alma continuum maps in bands 6 and 7, with rms down to7.8$\mu$jy, to derive differential number counts down to 60$\mu$jy and100$\mu$jy at $\lambda=$1.3 mm and $\lambda=$1.1 mm, respectively. the areacovered by the combined fields is $\rm 9.5\times10^{-4}deg^2$ at 1.1mm and $\rm6.6\times10^{-4}deg^{2}$ at 1.3mm. we improved the source extraction method byrequiring that the dimension of the detected sources be consistent with thebeam size. this method enabled us to remove spurious detections that haveplagued the purity of the catalogues in previous studies. we detected 50 faintsources with s/n$&gt;$3.5 down to 60$\mu$jy, hence improving the statistics by afactor of four relative to previous studies. the inferred differential numbercounts are $\rm dn/d(log_{10}s)=1\times10^5~deg^2$ at a 1.1 mm flux $s_{\lambda= 1.1~mm} = 130~\mu$jy, and $\rm dn/d(log_{10}s)=1.1\times10^5~deg^2$ at a 1.3mm flux $\rm s_{\lambda = 1.3~mm} = 60~\mu$jy. at the faintest flux limits,i.e. 30$\mu$jy and 40$\mu$jy, we obtain upper limits on the differential numbercounts of $\rm dn/d(log_{10}s) &lt; 7\times10^5~deg^2$ and $\rmdn/d(log_{10}s)&lt;3\times10^5~deg^2$, respectively. our results provide a newlower limit to cib intensity of 17.2${\rm jy\ deg^{-2}}$ at 1.1mm and of12.9${\rm jy\ deg^{-2}}$ at 1.3mm. moreover, the flattening of the integratednumber counts at faint fluxes strongly suggests that we are probably close tothe cib intensity. our data imply that galaxies with sfr$&lt;40~m_{\odot}/yr$certainly contribute less than 50% to the cib while more than 50% of the cibmust be produced by galaxies with $\rm sfr&gt;40~m_{\odot}/yr$. the differentialnumber counts are in nice agreement with recent semi-analytical models ofgalaxy formation even as low as our faint fluxes. consequently, this supportsthe galaxy evolutionary scenarios and assumptions made in these models.

1502.04708	peering through the holes: the far uv color of star-forming galaxies at  z~3-4 and the escaping fraction of ionizing radiation	we aim to investigate the effect of the escaping ionizing radiation on thecolor selection of high redshift galaxies and identify candidate lymancontinuum (lyc) emitters. the intergalactic medium prescription of inoue etal.(2014) and galaxy synthesis models of bruzual&amp;charlot (2003) have been usedto properly treat the ultraviolet stellar emission, the stochasticity of theintergalactic transmission and mean free path in the ionizing regime. colortracks are computed by turning on/off the escape fraction of ionizingradiation. at variance with recent studies, a careful treatment of igmtransmission leads to no significant effects on the high-redshift broad-bandcolor selection. the decreasing mean free path of ionizing photons withincreasing redshift further diminishes the contribution of the lyc tobroad-band colors. we also demonstrate that prominent lyc sources can beselected under suitable conditions by calculating the probability of a nullescaping ionizing radiation. the method is applied to a sample of galaxiesextracted from the goods-s field. a known lyc source at z=3.795 is successfullyrecovered as a lyc emitter candidate and another convincing candidate atz=3.212 is reported. a detailed analysis of the two sources (including theirvariability and morphology) suggests a possible mixture of stellar andnon-stellar (agn) contribution in the ultraviolet. conclusions: classicalbroad-band color selection of 2.5&lt;z&lt;4.5 galaxies does not prevent the inclusionof lyc emitters in the selected samples. large fesc in relatively brightgalaxies (l&gt;0.1l*) could be favored by the presence of a faint agn not easilydetected at any wavelength. a hybrid stellar and non-stellar (agn) ionizingemission could coexist in these systems and explain the tensions found amongthe uv excess and the stellar population synthesis models reported inliterature.

1502.06634	the assembly of "normal" galaxies at z=7 probed by alma	we report new deep alma observations aimed at investigating the [cii]158umline and continuum emission in three spectroscopically confirmed lyman breakgalaxies at 6.8&lt;z&lt;7.1, i.e. well within the re-ionization epoch. with starformation rates of sfr ~ 5-15 msun/yr these systems are much morerepresentative of the high-z galaxy population than other systems targeted inthe past by millimeter observations. for the galaxy with the deepestobservation we detect [cii] emission at redshift z=7.107, fully consistent withthe lyalpha redshift, but spatially offset by 0.7" (4 kpc) from the opticalemission. at the location of the optical emission, tracing both the lyalphaline and the far-uv continuum, no [cii] emission is detected in any of thethree galaxies, with 3sigma upper limits significantly lower than the [cii]emission observed in lower reshift galaxies. these results suggest thatmolecular clouds in the central parts of primordial galaxies are rapidlydisrupted by stellar feedback. as a result, [cii] emission mostly arises frommore external accreting/satellite clumps of neutral gas. these findings are inagreement with recent models of galaxy formation. thermal far-infraredcontinuum is not detected in any of the three galaxies. however, the upperlimits on the infrared-to-uv emission ratio do not exceed those derived inmetal- and dust-poor galaxies.

1505.00949	a co-rich merger shaping a powerful and hyper-luminous infrared radio  galaxy at z=2: the dragonfly galaxy	in the low-redshift universe, the most powerful radio sources are oftenassociated with gas-rich galaxy mergers or interactions. we here presentevidence for an advanced, gas-rich (`wet') merger associated with a powerfulradio galaxy at a redshift of z~2. this radio galaxy, mrc 0152-209, is the mostinfrared-luminous high-redshift radio galaxy known in the southern hemisphere.using the australia telescope compact array, we obtained high-resolutionco(1-0) data of cold molecular gas, which we complement with hst/wfpc2 imagingand wht long-slit spectroscopy. we find that, while roughly m(h2) ~ 2 x10$^{10}$ m$_{\odot}$ of molecular gas coincides with the central host galaxy,another m(h2) ~ 3 x 10$^{10}$ m$_{\odot}$ is spread across a total extent of~60 kpc. most of this widespread co(1-0) appears to follow prominent tidalfeatures visible in the rest-frame near-uv hst/wfpc2 imaging. ly$\alpha$emission shows an excess over heii, but a deficiency over l(ir), which islikely the result of photo-ionisation by enhanced but very obscured starformation that was triggered by the merger. in terms of feedback, the radiosource is aligned with widespread co(1-0) emission, which suggests that thereis a physical link between the propagating radio jets and the presence of coldmolecular gas on scales of the galaxy's halo. its optical appearance, combinedwith the transformational stage at which we witness the evolution of mrc0152-209, leads us to adopt the name `dragonfly galaxy'.

1509.01101	the lyman continuum escape fraction of galaxies at z=3.3 in the  vuds-lbc/cosmos field	the lyman continuum (lyc) flux escaping from high-z galaxies into the igm isa fundamental quantity to understand the physical processes involved in thereionization epoch. we have investigated a sample of star-forming galaxies atz~3.3 in order to search for possible detections of lyc photons escaping fromgalaxy halos. uv deep imaging in the cosmos field obtained with the prime focuscamera lbc at the lbt telescope was used together with a catalog ofspectroscopic redshifts obtained by the vimos ultra deep survey (vuds) to builda sample of 45 galaxies at z~3.3 with l&gt;0.5l*. we obtained deep lbc images ofgalaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the interval 3.27&lt;z&lt;3.40 both in the rand deep u bands. a sub-sample of 10 galaxies apparently shows escapefractions&gt;28% but a detailed analysis of their properties reveals that, withthe exception of two marginal detections (s/n~2) in the u band, all the other 8galaxies are most likely contaminated by the uv flux of low-z interloperslocated close to the high-z targets. the average escape fraction derived fromthe stacking of the cleaned sample was constrained to fesc_rel&lt;2%. the impliedhi photo-ionization rate is a factor two lower than that needed to keep the igmionized at z~3, as observed in the lyman forest of high-z qso spectra or by theproximity effect. these results support a scenario where high redshift,relatively bright (l&gt;0.5l*) star-forming galaxies alone are unable to sustainthe level of ionization observed in the cosmic igm at z~3. star-forminggalaxies at higher redshift and at fainter luminosities (l&lt;&lt;l*) can be themajor contributors to the reionization of the universe only if their physicalproperties are subject to rapid changes from z~3 to z~6-10. alternatively,ionizing sources could be discovered looking for fainter sources among the agnpopulation at high-z.

1509.07402	the detection of ultra-faint low surface brightness dwarf galaxies in  the virgo cluster: a probe of dark matter and baryonic physics	we have discovered 11 ultra-faint ($r\lesssim 22.1$) low surface brightness(lsb, central surface brightness $23\lesssim \mu_r\lesssim 26$) dwarf galaxycandidates in one deep virgo field of just $576$ arcmin$^2$ obtained by thelarge binocular camera (lbc) at the large binocular telescope (lbt). theirassociation with the virgo cluster is supported by their distinct position inthe central surface brightness - total magnitude plane with respect to thebackground galaxies of similar total magnitude. they have typical absolutemagnitudes and scale sizes, if at the distance of virgo, in the range$-13\lesssim m_r\lesssim -9$ and $250\lesssim r_s\lesssim 850$ pc,respectively. their colors are consistent with a gradually declining starformation history with a specific star formation rate of the order of$10^{-11}$ yr$^{-1}$, i.e. 10 times lower than that of main sequence starforming galaxies. they are older than the cluster formation age and appearregular in morphology. they represent the faintest extremes of the populationof low luminosity lsb dwarfs that has been recently detected in wider surveysof the virgo cluster. thanks to the depth of our observations we are able toextend the virgo luminosity function down to $m_r\sim -9.3$ (corresponding tototal masses $m\sim 10^7$ m$_{\odot}$), finding an average faint-end slope$\alpha\simeq -1.4$. this relatively steep slope puts interesting constraintson the nature of the dark matter and in particular on warm dark matter (wdm)often invoked to solve the overprediction of the dwarf number density by thestandard cdm scenario. we derive a lower limit on the wdm particle mass $&gt;1.5$kev.

astro-ph;0410202	a search for clusters at high redshift - iii. candidate h-alpha emitters  and eros in the pks 1138-262 proto-cluster at z=2.16	in this paper we present deep vlt multi wavelength imaging observations ofthe field around the radio galaxy pks 1138-262 aimed at detecting and studyinga (potential) proto-cluster centered at this radio source. pks 1138-262 is amassive galaxy at z=2.16, located in a dense environment as indicated byoptical, x-ray and radio observations. we had already found an over-density ofly-alpha emitting galaxies in this field, consistent with a proto-clusterstructure associated with the radio galaxy. in addition, we find 40 candidateh-alpha emitters that have nominal rest frame equivalent width &gt; 25 angstromwithin 1.8 mpc and 2000 km/s of the radio galaxy. furthermore, we find 44objects with i - k &gt; 4.3. this number of extremely red objects (eros) is abouttwice the number found in blank field ero surveys, suggesting that some eros inthis field are part of the proto-cluster. the density of h-alpha emitters andextremely red objects increases towards the radio galaxy, indicating a physicalassociation. from comparisons with other k band, ero, h-alpha and ly-alphasurveys, we conclude that pks 1138-262 is located in a density peak which willevolve into a cluster of galaxies.

astro-ph;0410203	a search for clusters at high redshift - iv. spectroscopy of h-alpha  emitters in a proto-cluster at z=2.16	radio galaxy pks 1138-262 is a massive galaxy at z=2.16, located in a denseenvironment. we have found an overdensity of ly-alpha emitting galaxies in thisfield, consistent with a proto-cluster structure associated with the radiogalaxy. recently, we have discovered forty candidate h-alpha emitters by theirexcess near infrared narrow band flux. here, we present infrared spectroscopyof nine of the brightest candidate h-alpha emitters. all these candidates showan emission line at the expected wavelength. the identification of three ofthese lines with h-alpha is confirmed by accompanying [nii] emission. thespectra of the other candidates are consistent with h-alpha emission at z~2.15,one being a qso as indicated by the broadness of its emission line. thevelocity dispersion of the emitters (360 km/s) is significantly smaller thanthat of the narrow band filter used for their selection (1600 km/s). wetherefore conclude that the emitters are associated with the radio galaxy. thestar formation rates (sfrs) deduced from the h-alpha flux are in the range 6-44m_solar/yr and the sfr density observed is 5-10 times higher than in the hdf-nat z=2.23. the properties of the narrow emission lines indicate that theemitters are powered by star formation and contain very young (&lt; 100 myr)stellar populations with moderately high metallicities.

astro-ph;0412026	on the x-ray emission of z~2 radio galaxies: ic scattering of the cmb &amp;  no evidence for fully-formed potential wells	we present the results of 20 ksec chandra observations for each of 5 radiogalaxies in the redshift range 2.0 &lt; z &lt; 2.6. for 4 of the 5 targets we detectunresolved x-ray components coincident with the radio nuclei. from spectralanalysis of one of the cores and comparison to the empirical radio to x-rayluminosity ratio correlation, we find that obscuring material (n(hi)~10^22cm^-2) may be surrounding the nuclei.  we detect x-ray emission coincident with the radio hotspots or lobes in 4 ofthe 5 targets, which can be explained by inverse-compton (ic) scattering of cmbphotons. the magnetic field strengths of ~100-200 mug that we derive agree withthe equipartition magnetic field strengths. the relative ease with which thelobe x-ray emission is detected is a consequence of the (1+z)^4 increase in theenergy density of the cmb. an hst image of one of the sources shows that thex-ray emission could also be produced by a reservoir of hot, shocked gas, asevidenced by a bright, optical bow-shock.  by stacking our data we created a deep, 100 ksec exposure to search fordiffuse x-ray emission from intra-cluster gas. we detect no diffuse emissionand derive upper limits of ~1e+44 erg/s, thereby ruling out a virializedstructure of cluster-size scale at z~2.  the average number of soft x-ray sources in our fields is consistent with thenumber density of agn in the chandra deep fields. their angular distributionshows no evidence for large-scale structure associated with the radio galaxies.

astro-ph;0501259	properties of ly-alpha emitters around the radio galaxy mrc 0316-257	observations of the radio galaxy mrc 0316-257 at z=3.13 and the surroundingfield are presented. using narrow- and broad-band imaging obtained with thevlt, 77 candidate ly-alpha emitters with a rest-frame equivalent width of &gt; 15a were selected in a ~7'x7' field around the radio galaxy. spectroscopy of 40candidate emitters resulted in the discovery of 33 emission line galaxies ofwhich 31 are ly-alpha emitters with redshifts similar to that of the radiogalaxy, while the remaining two galaxies turned out to be [oii] emitters. thely-alpha profiles have widths (fwhm) in the range of 120-800 km/s, with amedian of 260 km/s. where the signal-to-noise was large enough, the ly-alphaprofiles were found to be asymmetric, with apparent absorption troughs bluewardof the profile peaks, indicative of absorption along the line of sight of an himass of at least 2x10^2 - 5x10^4 m_sun. the properties of the ly-alpha galaxies(faint, blue and small) are consistent with young star forming galaxies whichare still nearly dust free. the volume density of ly-alpha emitting galaxies inthe field around mrc 0316-257 is a factor of 3.3+0.5-0.4 larger compared withthe density of field ly-alpha emitters at that redshift. the velocitydistribution of the spectroscopically confirmed emitters has a fwhm of 1510km/s, which is substantially smaller than the width of the narrow-band filter(fwhm ~ 3500 km/s). the peak of the velocity distribution is located within 200km/s of the redshift of the radio galaxy. we conclude that the confirmedly-alpha emitters are members of a protocluster of galaxies at z~3.13. the sizeof the protocluster is larger than 3.3x3.3 mpc^2. the mass of this structure isestimated to be &gt; 3-6x10^14 m_sun and could be the progenitor of a cluster ofgalaxies similar to e.g. the virgo cluster.

astro-ph;0609068	the galaxy mass function up to z=4 in the goods-music sample: into the  epoch of formation of massive galaxies	the goal of this work is to measure the evolution of the galaxy stellar massfunction and of the resulting stellar mass density up to redshift ~4, in orderto study the assembly of massive galaxies in the high redshift universe. wehave used the goods-music catalog, containing ~3000 ks-selected galaxies withmulti-wavelength coverage extending from the u band to the spitzer 8 micronband, of which 27% have spectroscopic redshifts and the remaining fraction haveaccurate photometric redshifts. on this sample we have applied a standardfitting procedure to measure stellar masses. we compute the galaxy stellar massfunction and the resulting stellar mass density up to redshift ~4, taking intoproper account the biases and incompleteness effects. within the well knowntrend of global decline of the stellar mass density with redshift, we show thatthe decline of the more massive galaxies may be described by an exponentialtimescale of ~6 gyrs up to z~1.5, and proceeds much faster thereafter, with anexponential timescale of ~0.6 gyrs. we also show that there is some evidencefor a differential evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function, with low massgalaxies evolving faster than more massive ones up to z~1-1.5 and that thegalaxy stellar mass function remains remarkably flat (i.e. with a slope closeto the local one) up to z~1-1.3. the observed behaviour of the galaxy stellarmass function is consistent with a scenario where about 50% of present-daymassive galaxies formed at a vigorous rate in the epoch between redshift 4 and1.5, followed by a milder evolution until the present-day epoch.

astro-ph;0610567	protoclusters associated with z &gt; 2 radio galaxies. i. characteristics  of high redshift protoclusters	[abridged] we present the results of a large program conducted with the verylarge telescope and keck telescope to search for forming clusters of galaxiesnear powerful radio galaxies at 2.0 &lt; z &lt; 5.2. we obtained narrow- andbroad-band images of nine radio galaxies and their surroundings. the imagingwas used to select candidate lyman alpha emitting galaxies in ~3x3 mpc^2 areasnear the radio galaxies. a total of 337 candidate emitters were found with arest-frame lyman alpha equivalent width of ew_0 &gt; 15 a and sigma = ew_0/deltaew_0 &gt; 3. follow-up spectroscopy confirmed 168 lyman alpha emitters near eightradio galaxies. the success rate of our selection procedure is 91%. at leastsix of our eight fields are overdense in lyman alpha emitters by a factor 3-5.also, the emitters show significant clustering in velocity space. in theoverdense fields, the width of the velocity distributions of the emitters is afactor 2-5 smaller than the width of the narrow-band filters. taken together,we conclude that we have discovered six forming clusters of galaxies(protoclusters). we estimate that roughly 75% of powerful (l_2.7ghz &gt; 10^33erg/s/hz/sr) high redshift radio galaxies reside in a protocluster, with asizes of at least 1.75 mpc. we estimate that the protoclusters have masses inthe range 2-9 x 10^14 msun and they are likely to be progenitors of present-day(massive) clusters of galaxies. for the first time, we have been able toestimate the velocity dispersion of cluster progenitors from z~5 to ~2. thevelocity dispersion of the emitters increases with cosmic time, in agreementwith the dark matter velocity dispersion in numerical simulations of formingmassive clusters.

astro-ph;0610909	the spiderweb galaxy: a forming massive cluster galaxy at z~2	we present a deep image of the radio galaxy mrc 1138-262 taken with thehubble space telescope (hst) at a redshift of z = 2.2. the galaxy is known tohave properties of a cd galaxy progenitor and be surrounded by a 3 mpc-sizedstructure, identified with a protocluster. the morphology shown on the new deephst/acs image is reminiscent of a spider's web. more than 10 individual clumpyfeatures are observed, apparently star-forming satellite galaxies in theprocess of merging with the progenitor of a dominant cluster galaxy 11 gyr ago.there is an extended emission component, implying that star formation wasoccurring over a 50 times 40 kpc region at a rate of more than 100 m_sun/yr. astriking feature of the newly named ``spiderweb galaxy'' is the presence ofseveral faint linear galaxies within the merging structure. the denseenvironments and fast galaxy motions at the centres of protoclusters maystimulate the formation of these structures, which dominate the faint resolvedgalaxy populations in the hubble ultra deep field. the new image provides aunique testbed for simulations of forming dominant cluster galaxies.

astro-ph;0703013	physical properties of z~4 lbgs: differences between galaxies with and  without ly-alpha emission	we have analysed the physical properties of z~4 lyman break galaxies observedin the goods-s survey, in order to investigate the possible differences betweengalaxies where the ly-alpha is present in emission, and those where the line isabsent or in absorption. the objects have been selected from their opticalcolor and then spectroscopically confirmed by vanzella et al. (2005). from thepublic spectra we assessed the nature of the ly-alpha emission and divided thesample into galaxies with ly-alpha in emission and objects without ly-alphaline (i.e. either absent or in absorption). we have then used the completephotometry, from u band to mid infrared from the goods-music database, to studythe observational properties of the galaxies, such as uv spectral slopes andoptical to mid-infrared colors, and the possible differences between the twosamples. finally through standard spectral fitting tecniques we have determinedthe physical properties of the galaxies, such as total stellar mass, stellarages and so on, and again we have studied the possible differences between thetwo samples. our results indicate that lbg with ly-alpha in emission are onaverage a much younger and less massive population than the lbgs withoutly-alpha emission. both populations are forming stars very actively and arerelatively dust free, although those with line emission seem to be even lessdusty on average. we briefly discuss these results in the context of recentmodels for the evolution of lyman break galaxies and ly-alpha emitters.

astro-ph;9802066	erratum for: an x-ray cluster at redshift 2.156?	a third possible explanation for the x-ray emission from the z=2.156 radiogalaxy 1138-262 is thermal emission from a very dense, sub-cluster `halo',perhaps associated with the (forming) cd galaxy on a scale &lt; 100 kpc. forinstance, increasing the gas density from 0.01 cm^{-3} to 0.1 cm^{-3} woulddecrease the required hot gas mass by the same factor, and could possiblyalleviate constraints on cosmological structure formation models. the pressurein this gas would be very high (10^{-9} dynes cm^{-2}), comparable to thepressure in the optical line emitting nebulosity and to the minimum pressure inthe radio source, and the cooling time would be short (&lt; fewx10^{8} years).circumstantial evidence for such very dense, hot gas enveloping some high zradio sources has been reviewed by fabian et al. (1986). fabian (1991) suggeststhat in some cases the `inferred pressures are close to the maximum that can beobtained by gas cooling in a potential well of a galaxy' (ie. the cooling time= gravitational free-fall time), and he designates such systems as `maximalcooling flows', with implied cooling flow rates up to 2000 m_solar year^{-1}.high resolution x-ray imaging with axaf should be able to test whether 1138-262has a normal cluster atmosphere, a `maximal cooling flow', or an unusuallyx-ray loud agn.

astro-ph;9809056	hst images and properties of the most distant radio galaxies	we present hubble space telescope images of 11 high redshift radio galaxies(between $z=2.3$ and $z=3.6$). the galaxies were observed with the wfpc2 camerain a broad band filter (f606w or f707w, roughly equivalent to v or r-band), for2 orbits each. we find that on the scale of the hst observations there is awide variety of morphological structures of the hosting galaxies: most objectshave a clumpy, irregular appearance, consisting of a bright nucleus and anumber of smaller components, suggestive of merging systems. some observedstructures could be due (at least partly) to the presence of dust distributedthrough the galaxies. the uv continuum emission is generally elongated andaligned with the axis of the radio sources, however the characteristics of the``alignment effect'' differ from case to case, suggesting that the phenomenoncannot be explained by a single physical mechanism. we compare the propertiesof our radio galaxies with those of the  uv dropout galaxies and conclude that (i) the most massive radio galaxies maywell evolve from an aggregate of uv dropout galaxies and (ii) high redshiftradio galaxies probably evolve into present day brightest cluster galaxies.

0811.1861	the physical properties of lyalpha emitting galaxies: not just primeval  galaxies?	we have analyzed a sample of lbgs from z =3.5 to z=6 selected from thegoods-s field as b,v and i-dropouts, and with spectroscopic observationsshowing that they have the lyalpha line in emission. our main aim is toinvestigate their physical properties and their dependence on the emission linecharacteristics, to shed light on the relation between galaxies with lyalphaemission and the general lbg population.the objects were selected from theircontinuum colors and then spectroscopically confirmed by the goodscollaboration and other campaigns. from the spectra we derived the line fluxand ew. we then used u-band to mid-ir photometry from goods-music to derive thephysical properties of the galaxies, such as total stellar mass, age and so on,through standard sed fitting techniques.although most galaxies are fit by youngstellar populations, a small but non negligible fraction has seds that requireconsiderably older stellar component, up to 1 gyr. there is no apparentrelation between age and ew: some of the oldest galaxies have large ew, andshould be also selected in narrow band surveys. therefore not all lyalphaemitters are primeval galaxies in the very early stages of formation,as iscommonly assumed. we also find a large range of stellar populations, withmasses from 5x10^8 msol to 5x10^10 msol and sfr from few to 60 msol/yr.although there is no correlation between mass and ew, we find a significantlack of massive galaxies with high ew, which could be explained if the mostmassive galaxies were more dusty and/or contained more neutral gas than lessmassive objects. finally we find that more than half of the galaxies containsmall but non negligible amounts of dust: the mean e(b-v) and the ew are wellcorrelated, although with a large scatter, as already found at lower redshift
