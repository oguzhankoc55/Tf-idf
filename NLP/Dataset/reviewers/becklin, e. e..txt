0706.1782	a constant spectral index for sagittarius a* during infrared/x-ray  intensity variations	we report the first time-series of broadband infrared (ir) color measurementsof sgr a*, the variable emission source associated with the supermassive blackhole at the galactic center. using the laser and natural guide star ao systemson the keck ii telescope, we imaged sgr a* in multiple near-infrared broadbandfilters with a typical cycle time of ~3 min during 4 observing runs(2005-2006), two of which were simultaneous with chandra x-ray measurements. inspite of the large range of dereddened flux densities for sgr a* (2-30 mjy),all of our near-ir measurements are consistent with a constant spectral indexof alpha = -0.6+-0.2. furthermore, this value is consistent with the spectralindices observed at x-ray wavelengths during nearly all outbursts; which isconsistent with the synchrotron self-compton model for the production of thex-ray emission. during the coordinated observations, one ir outburst occurs &lt;36min after a possibly associated x-ray outburst, while several similar iroutbursts show no elevated x-ray emission. a variable x-ray to ir ratio andconstant infrared spectral index challenge the notion that the ir and x-rayemission are connected to the same electrons. we, therefore, posit that thepopulation of electrons responsible for both the ir and x-ray emission aregenerated by an acceleration mechanism that leaves the bulk of the electronenergy distribution responsible for the ir emission unchanged, but has avariable high-energy cutoff. occasionally a tail of electrons &gt;1 gev isgenerated, and it is this high-energy tail that gives rise to the x-rayoutbursts. one possible explanation for this type of variation is from theturbulence induced by a magnetorotational instability, in which the outer scalelength of the turbulence varies and changes the high-energy cutoff.

1202.3582	first science results from sofia/forcast: the mid-infrared view of the  compact hii region w3a	the massive star forming region w3 was observed with the faint objectinfrared camera for the sofia telescope (forcast) as part of the short scienceprogram. the 6.4, 6.6, 7.7, 19.7, 24.2, 31.5 and 37.1 \um bandpasses were usedto observe the emission of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) molecules,very small grains and big grains. optical depth and color temperature maps ofw3a show that irs2 has blown a bubble devoid of gas and dust of $\sim$0.05 pcradius. it is embedded in a dusty shell of ionized gas that contributes 40% ofthe total 24 \um emission of w3a. this dust component is mostly heated by farultraviolet, rather than trapped ly$\alpha$ photons. this shell is itselfsurrounded by a thin ($\sim$0.01 pc) photodissociation region where pahs showintense emission. the infrared spectral energy distribution (sed) of threedifferent zones located at 8, 20 and 25\arcsec from irs2, show that the peak ofthe sed shifts towards longer wavelengths, when moving away from the star.adopting the stellar radiation field for these three positions, dustem modelfits to these seds yield a dust-to-gas mass ratio in the ionized gas similar tothat in the diffuse ism. however, the ratio of the ir-to-uv opacity of the dustin the ionized shell is increased by a factor $\simeq$3 compared to the diffuseism.

1202.4479	first science observations with sofia/forcast: 6 to 37 micron imaging of  the central orion nebula	we present new mid-infrared images of the central region of the orion nebulausing the newly commissioned sofia airborne telescope and its 5 -- 40 microncamera forcast. the 37.1 micron images represent the highest resolutionobservations (&lt;4") ever obtained of this region at these wavelengths. afterbn/kl (which is described in a separate letter in this issue), the dominantsource at all wavelengths except 37.1 micron is the ney-allen nebula, acrescent-shaped extended source associated with theta 1d. the morphology of theney-allen nebula in our images is consistent with the interpretation that it isambient dust swept up by the stellar wind from theta 1d, as suggested by smithet al. (2005). our observations also reveal emission from two "proplyds"(proto-planetary disks), and a few embedded young stellar objects (ysos; irc9,and omc1s irs1, 2, and 10). the spectral energy distribution for irc9 ispresented and fitted with standard yso models from robitaille et al. (2007) toconstrain the total luminosity, disk size, and envelope size. the diffuse,nebular emission we observe at all forcast wavelengths is most likely from thebackground photodissociation region (pdr) and shows structure that coincidesroughly with h_alpha and [n ii] emission. we conclude that the spatialvariations in the diffuse emission are likely due to undulations in the surfaceof the background pdr.

1202.4802	first science observations with sofia/forcast: 6 to 37 micron imaging of  orion bn/kl	the bn/kl region of the orion nebula is the nearest region of high mass starformation in our galaxy. as such, it has been the subject of intenseinvestigation at a variety of wavelengths, which have revealed it to bebrightest in the infrared to sub-mm wavelength regime. using the newlycommissioned sofia airborne telescope and its 5-40 micron camera forcast,images of the entire bn/kl complex have been acquired. the 31.5 and 37.1 micronimages represent the highest resolution observations (&lt;=4") ever obtained ofthis region at these wavelengths. these observations reveal that the bn objectis not the dominant brightness source in the complex at wavelengths &gt;31.5microns, and that this distinction goes instead to the source irc4. it wasdetermined from these images and derived dust color temperature maps that irc4is also likely to be self-luminous. a new source of emission has also beenidentified at wavelengths &gt;31.5 microns that coincides with the northeasternoutflow lobe from the protostellar disk associated with radio source i.

1304.1581	keck adaptive optics observations of the protostellar disk around radio  source i in the orion kleinmann-low nebula	we have made the first detection of a near-infrared counterpart associatedwith the disk around radio source "i," a massive protostar in the kleinmann-lownebula in orion using imaging with laser guide star adaptive optics on the keckii telescope. the infrared emission is evident in images acquired using l' (3.8microns) and ms (4.7 microns) filters and is not detectable at k' (2.1microns). the observed morphology strongly suggests that we are seeing somecombination of scattered and thermal light emanating from the disk. the disk isalso manifest in the l'/ms flux ratio image. we interpret the near-infraredemission as the illuminated surface of a nearly edge-on disk, oriented so thatonly the northern face is visible; the opposite surface remains hidden by thedisk. we do not see infrared radiation associated directly with the starproposed to be associated with source "i." the data also suggest that there isa cavity above and below the disk that is oriented perpendicular to the disk,and is sculpted by the known, strong outflow from the inner disk of source i.we compare our data to models of a protostar with a surrounding disk, envelope,and wind-blown cavity in order to elucidate the nature of the disk around radiosource i.

1304.5280	keck observations of the galactic center source g2: gas cloud or star?	we present new observations and analysis of g2 - the intriguing redemission-line object which is quickly approaching the galaxy's central blackhole. the observations were obtained with the laser guide star adaptive opticssystems on the w. m. keck i and ii telescopes and include spectroscopy (r ~3600) centered on the hydrogen br-gamma line as well as k' (2.1 micrometer) andl' (3.8 micrometer) imaging. analysis of these observations shows the br-gammaline emission has a positional offset from the l' continuum. this offset islikely due to background source confusion at l'. we therefore present the firstorbital solution derived from br-gamma line astrometry, which when coupled withradial velocity measurements, results in a later time of closest approach(2014.21 +/- 0.14), closer periastron (130 au, 1900rs), and higher eccentricity(0.9814 +/- 0.0060) compared to a solution using l' astrometry. the new orbitcasts doubt on previous associations of g2 and a low surface brightness "tail".it is shown that g2 has no k' counterpart down to k' ~ 20 mag. g2's l'continuum and the br-gamma line-emission is unresolved in almost all epochs;however it is marginally extended in our highest quality br-gamma data set from2006 and exhibits a clear velocity gradient at that time. while theobservations altogether suggest that g2 has a gaseous component which istidally interacting with the central black hole, there is likely a central starproviding the self-gravity necessary to sustain the compact nature of thisobject.

0802.0226	gas and dust associated with the strange, isolated, star bp piscium	we have carried out a multiwavelength observational campaign demonstratingsome of the remarkable properties of the infrared-bright variable star bp psc.surrounded by a compact dusty, gaseous disk, this little-studied late-g (orearly-k) type star emits about 75% of its detected energy flux at infraredwavelengths. evidence for accretion of gas in conjunction with narrow bi-polarjets and herbig-haro objects is apparently consistent with classification of bppsc as a pre-main sequence star, as postulated in most previous studies. ifyoung, then bp psc would be one of the nearest and oldest known classical ttauri stars. however, such an evolutionary classification encounters variousproblems that are absent or much less severe if bp psc is instead a luminosityclass iii post-main sequence star. in this case, it would be the first knownexample of a first ascent giant surrounded by a massive molecular disk withaccompanying rapid gas accretion and prominent jets and hh objects. in thismodel, the genesis of the massive dusty gaseous disk could be a consequence ofthe envelopment of a low mass companion star. properties in the disk may beconducive to the current formation of planets, a gigayear or more after theformation of bp psc itself.

astro-ph;0009339	the accelerations of stars orbiting the milky way's central black hole	recent measurements, of the velocities of stars near the center of the milkyway have provided the strongest evidence for the presence of a supermassiveblack hole in a galaxy, but the observational uncertainties poorly constrainmany of the properties of the black hole. determining the accelerations ofstars in their orbits around the center provides much more precise informationabout the position and mass of the black hole. here we report measurements ofthe accelerations for three stars located ~0.005 pc from the central radiosource sgr a*; these accelerations are comparable to those experienced by theearth as it orbits the sun. these data increase the inferred minimum massdensity in the central region of the galaxy by an order of magnitude relativeto previous results and localized the dark mass to within 0.05 +- 0.04 arcsecof the nominal position of sgr a*. in addition, the orbital period of one ofthe observed stars could be as short as 15 years, allowing us the opportunityin the near future to observe an entire period.

astro-ph;0107006	h2 and co emission from disks around ttauri and herbigae  pre-main-sequence stars and from debris disks around young stars: warm and  cold circumstellar gas	we present iso-sws observations of h2 pure-rotational line emission from thedisks around low and intermediate mass pre-main-sequence stars as well as fromyoung stars thought to be surrounded by debris disks. we detect `warm' (t ~100-200 k) h2 gas around many sources, including tentatively the debris-diskobjects. the mass of this warm gas ranges from ~1e-4 solar mass up to 8e-3solar mass, and can constitute a non-negligible fraction of the total diskmass. complementary single-dish 12co 3-2, 13co 3-2 and 12co 6-5 observationshave been obtained as well. these transitions probe cooler gas at t ~ 20-80 k.most objects show a double-peaked co emission profile characteristic of a diskin keplerian rotation, consistent with interferometer data on the lower-jlines. the ratios of the 12co 3-2/ 13co 3-2 integrated fluxes indicate that12co 3-2 is optically thick but that 13co 3-2 is optically thin or at mostmoderately thick. the 13co 3-2 lines have been used to estimate the cold gasmass. if a h2/co conversion factor of 1e4 is adopted, the derived cold gasmasses are factors of 10-200 lower than those deduced from 1.3 millimeter dustemission assuming a gas/dust ratio of 100,in accordance with previous studies.the warm gas is typically 1-10 % of the total mass deduced from millimetercontinuum emission, but can increase up to 100% or more for the debris-diskobjects. thus, residual molecular gas may persist into the debris-disk phase.no significant evolution in the h2, co or dust masses is found for stars withages in the range of 1e6-1e7 years, although a decrease is found for the olderdebris-disk star beta pictoris. existing models fail to explain the amount ofwarm gas quantitatively.

astro-ph;0110010	are starburst galaxies the hosts of gamma-ray bursts ?	we present deep 2.2 micron imaging of twelve gamma-ray burst host galaxies.template spectral energy distributions are fit to the multiband photometrybetween visible and near-infrared wavelengths to derive a better constraint onthe stellar mass of these galaxies. the internal extinction in the hostgalaxies is estimated using the rest-frame ultraviolet (uv) slope. we find thatthe extinction corrected star-formation rates (sfrs) of the galaxies aresignificantly larger than rates derived from emission lines in the visible orthe uv continuum. the ratio between the extinction corrected sfrs and stellarmass for 7 of the host galaxies is high compared to local starbursts and 3 ofthe hosts have derived far-infrared luminosities comparable to infraredluminous galaxies. in addition, existing observational data reveal that atleast 6 of the 11 putative hosts seem to be disturbed or have companiongalaxies within a projected angular separation of about 2.5 arcsec. if weassume that the host and the companion are at similar redshifts, thiscorresponds to a physical separation of less than 20 kpc, providing someevidence for an ongoing/recent tidal encounter. we conclude thattidally-induced starbursts such as those found in infrared luminous galaxiesmight be popular birthplaces for gamma-ray bursts. the age of the stellarpopulation in 4 out of 6 galaxies is rather young, of order 10 myr. this favorsmodels where gamma-ray bursts are due to the core-collapse of isolated, massivestars and explosion of the resultant black hole-accretion disk system.

astro-ph;0208239	limits on the short term variability of sagittarius a* in the  near-infrared	the recent detection of a 3-hr x-ray flare by the chandra observatory hasraised the possibility of enhanced emission over a broad range of wavelengthsfrom sgr a*, the suspected 2.6 x 10^6 solar mass black hole at the galacticcenter, during a flaring event. we have, therefore, reconstructed 3-hr datasets from 2 micron speckle and adaptive optics images (theta_core = 50 - 100mas) obtained with the w. m. keck 10-m telescopes between 1995 and 2001. in 25separate observations, no evidence of any significant excess emissionassociated with sgr a* was detected. the lowest of our detection limits givesan observed limit for the quiescent state of sgr a* of 0.09+/-0.005 mjy, or,equivalently, a dereddened value of 2.0+/-0.1 mjy, which is a factor of 2 lowerthan the best previously published quiescent value. under the assumption thatthere are random 3-hr flares producing both enhanced x-ray and near-infraredemission, our highest limit constrains the variable state of sgr a* to &lt;0.8 mjy(observed) or 19 mjy (dereddened). these results suggest that the model favoredby markoff et al. (2001), in which the flare is produced through local heatingof relativistic particles surrounding sgr a* (e.g., a sudden magneticreconnection event), is unlikely, because it predicts peak 2 micron emission of300 mjy, well above our detection limit.

astro-ph;0302299	the first measurement of spectral lines in a short-period star bound to  the galaxy's central black hole: a paradox of youth	we have obtained the first detection of spectral absorption lines in one ofthe high-velocity stars in the vicinity of the galaxy's central supermassiveblack hole. both brgamma (2.1661 micron) and he i (2.1126 micron) are seen inabsorption in s0-2 with equivalent widths (2.8+-0.3 ang &amp; 1.7+-0.4 ang) and aninferred stellar rotational velocity (220+-40 km/s) that are consistent withthat of an o8-b0 dwarf, which suggests that it is a massive (~15 msun), young(&lt;10 myr) main sequence star. this presents a major challenge to star formationtheories, given the strong tidal forces that prevail over all distances reachedby s0-2 in its current orbit (130 - 1900 au) and the difficulty in migratingthis star inward during its lifetime from further out where tidal forces shouldno longer preclude star formation. the radial velocity measurements (-510+-40km/s) and our reported proper motions for s0-2 strongly constrain its orbit,providing a direct measure of the black hole mass of 4.1(+-0.6)x10^6(ro/8kpc)^3msun. the keplerian orbit parameters have uncertainities that are reduced by afactor of 2-3 compared to previously reported values and include, for the firsttime, an independent solution for the dynamical center; this location, whileconsistent with the nominal infrared position of sgr a*, is localized to afactor of 5 more precisely (+-2 milli-arcsec). furthermore, the ambiguity inthe inclination of the orbit is resolved with the addition of the radialvelocity measurement, indicating that the star is behind the black hole at thetime of closest approach and counter-revolving against the galaxy. with furtherradial velocity measurements in the next few years, the orbit of s0-2 willprovide the most robust estimate of the distance to the galactic center.

0808.2870	measuring distance and properties of the milky way's central  supermassive black hole with stellar orbits	we report new precision measurements of the properties of our galaxy'ssupermassive black hole. based on astrometric (1995-2007) and radial velocity(2000-2007) measurements from the w. m. keck 10-meter telescopes, a fullyunconstrained keplerian orbit for the short period star s0-2 provides valuesfor ro of 8.0+-0.6 kpc, m_bh of 4.1+-0.6x10^6 mo, and the black hole's radialvelocity, which is consistent with zero with 30 km/s uncertainty. if the blackhole is assumed to be at rest with respect to the galaxy, we can furtherconstrain the fit and obtain ro = 8.4+-0.4 kpc and m_bh = 4.5+-0.4x10^6 mo.more complex models constrain the extended dark mass distribution to be lessthan 3-4x10^5 mo within 0.01 pc, ~100x higher than predictions from stellar andstellar remnant models. for all models, we identify transient astrometricshifts from source confusion and the assumptions regarding the black hole'sradial motion as previously unrecognized limitations on orbital accuracy andthe usefulness of fainter stars. future astrometric and rv observations willremedy these effects. our estimates of ro and the galaxy's local rotationspeed, which it is derived from combining ro with the apparent proper motion ofsgr a*, (theta0 = 229+-18 km/s), are compatible with measurements made usingother methods. the increased black hole mass found in this study, compared tothat determined using projected mass estimators, implies a longer period forthe innermost stable orbit, longer resonant relaxation timescales for stars inthe vicinity of the black hole and a better agreement with the m_bh-sigmarelation.

astro-ph;0607490	hst nicmos imaging of the planetary-mass companion to the young brown  dwarf 2mass j1207334-393254	multi-band (0.9 to 1.6 um) images of the tw hydrae association (twa) browndwarf, 2mass j1207334-393254 (also known as 2m1207), and its candidateplanetary mass companion (2m1207b) were obtained on 2004 aug 28 and 2005 apr 26with hst/nicmos. the images from these two epochs unequivocally confirm the twoobjects as a common proper motion pair (16.0 sigma confidence). a newmeasurement of the proper motion of 2m1207 implies a distance to the system of59+-7 pc and a projected separation of 46+-5 au. the nicmos and previouslypublished vlt photometry of 2m1207b, extending overall from 0.9 to 3.8 um, arefully consistent with an object of a few jupiter masses at the canonical age ofa twa member (~8 myr) based on evolutionary models of young giant planets.these observations provide information on the physical nature of 2m1207b andunambiguously establish that the first direct image of a planetary masscompanion in orbit around a self-luminous body, other than our sun, has beensecured.

astro-ph;9807210	high proper motion stars in the vicinity of sgr a*: evidence for a  supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy	over a two year period (1995-1997), we have conducted a diffraction-limitedimaging study at 2.2 microns of the inner 6"x6" of the galaxy's central stellarcluster using the keck 10-m telescope. the k band images obtained reveal alarge population of faint stars. we use an unbiased approach for identifyingand selecting stars to be included in this proper motion study, which resultsin a sample of 90 stars with brightness ranging from k=9-17 and velocities aslarge as 1,400+-100 km/sec. compared to earlier work (eckart et al. 1997;genzel et al. 1997), the source confusion is reduced by a factor of 9, thenumber of stars with proper motion measurement in the central 25 arcsec^2 ofour galaxy is doubled, and the accuracy of the velocity measurements in thecentral 1 arcsec^2 is improved by a factor of 4. the peaks of both the stellarsurface density and the velocity dispersion are consistent with the position ofthe unusual radio source and blackhole candidate, sgr a*, suggesting that sgra* is coincident (+-0."1) with the dynamical center of the galaxy. as afunction of distance from sgr a*, the velocity dispersion displays a falloffwell fit by keplerian motion about a central dark mass of 2.6(+-0.2)x10^6 moconfined to a volume of at most 10^-6 pc^3, consistent with earlier results.although uncertainties in the measurements mathematically allow for the matterto be distributed over this volume as a cluster, no realistic cluster isphysically tenable. thus, independent of the presence of sgr a*, the largeinferred central density of at least 10^12 mo/pc^3, which exceeds thevolume-averaged mass densities found at the center of any other galaxy, leadsus to the conclusion that our galaxy harbors a massive central black hole.

astro-ph;9810120	high spatial resolution imaging of arp 220 from 3 - 25 microns	images of arp 220 from 3.45 to 24.5 $\mu$m with 0.5'' resolution arepresented which clearly separate the nucleus into at least two components. thewestern component is about three times more luminous than the easterncomponent, but the silicate absorption in the fainter, eastern component isroughly 50% greater than the absorption in the western component. eachcomponent is marginally resolved. the two components seen at 24.5 $\mu$m areidentified with the two radio components. the western source most likelycoincides with the high extinction disk previously suggested to exist in arp220, while the eastern nucleus is identified with a faint highly reddenedsource seen in hst 2.2 $\mu$m nicmos images. the two nuclei together accountfor essentially all of the measured 24.5 $\mu$m flux density. two models arepresented, both of which fit the observations. in one, the majority of thetotal luminosity is produced in an extended star formation region and in theother most of the luminosity is produced in the compact but extincted regionsassociated with the two nuclei seen at 24.5 $\mu$m. in both pictures,substantial luminosity at 100 $\mu$m emerges from a component having a diameterof 2--3'' ($\sim$1kpc).

astro-ph;9901218	nicmos imaging of the hr 4796a circumstellar disk	we report the first near infrared (nir) imaging of a circumstellar annulardisk around the young (~8 myr), vega-like star, hr 4796a. nicmos coronagraphobservations at 1.1 and 1.6 microns reveal a ring-like symmetrical structurepeaking in reflected intensity 1.05 arcsec +/- 0.02 arcsec (~ 70 au) from thecentral a0v star. the ring geometry, with an inclination of 73.1 deg +/- 1.2deg and a major axis pa of 26.8 deg +/- 0.6 deg, is in good agreement withrecent 12.5 and 20.8 micron observations of a truncated disk (koerner, et al.1998). the ring is resolved with a characteristic width of less than 0.26arcsec (17 au) and appears abruptly truncated at both the inner and outeredges. the region of the disk-plane inward of ~60 au appears to be relativelyfree of scattering material. the integrated flux density of the part of thedisk that is visible (greater than 0.65 arcsec from the star) is found to be7.5 +/- 0.5 mjy and 7.4 +/- 1.2 mjy at 1.1 and 1.6 microns, respectively.correcting for the unseen area of the ring yields total flux densities of 12.8+/- 1.0 mjy and 12.5 +/- 2.0 mjy, respectively (vega magnitudes = 12.92 /+-0.08 and 12.35 +/-0.18). the nir luminosity ratio is evaluated from theseresults and ground-based photometry of the star. at these wavelengthsldisk(lambda)/l*(lambda) = 1.4 +/- 0.2e-3 and 2.4 +/- 0.5e-3, giving reasonableagreement between the stellar flux scattered in the nir and that which isabsorbed in the visible and re-radiated in the thermal infrared. the somewhatred reflectance of the disk at these wavelengths implies mean particle sizes inexcess of several microns, larger than typical interstellar grains. theconfinement of material to a relatively narrow annular zone implies dynamicalconstraints on the disk particles by one or more as yet unseen bodies.

astro-ph;9908153	infrared spectroscopy of the high redshift radio galaxy mrc~2025-218 and  a neighboring extremely red galaxy	this paper presents infrared spectra taken with the newly commissionednirspec spectrograph on the keck telescope of the high redshift radio galaxymrc 2025-218 (z=2.630) and an extremely red galaxy (r-k &gt; 6 mag) 9'' away.these observations represent the deepest infrared spectra of a radio galaxy todate and have allowed for the detection of hbeta, oiii (4959/5007), oi (6300),halpha, nii (6548/6583) and sii (6716/6713). the halpha emission is very broad(fwhm~6000 km/s) and strongly supports agn unification models linking radiogalaxies and quasars. the line ratios are most consistent with a partiallyobscured nuclear region and very high excitation. the oiii (5007) line isextended several arcseconds and shows high velocity clouds in the extendedemission. the nucleus also appears spectrally double and we argue that theradio galaxy is undergoing a violent merger process. the red galaxy, bycomparison, is very featureless even though we have a good continuum detectionin the h and k bands. we suggest that this object is a foreground galaxy,probably at a redshift less than 1.5.

astro-ph;9910557	high resolution infrared imaging of the compact nuclear source in  ngc4258	we present high resolution imaging of the nucleus of ngc4258 from 1 micron to18 microns. our observations reveal that the previously discovered compactsource of emission is unresolved even at the near-infrared resolution of about0.2 arcsec fwhm which corresponds to about 7 pc at the distance of the galaxy.this is consistent with the source of emission being the region in theneighborhood of the purported 3.5*10^7 m_sun black hole. after correcting forabout 18 mags of visual extinction, the infrared data are consistent with af_nu \propto nu^(-1.4+/-0.1) spectrum from 1.1 micron to 18 micron, implying anon-thermal origin. based on this spectrum, the total extinction correctedinfrared luminosity (1-20 micron) of the central source is 2*10^8 l_sun. weargue that the infrared spectrum and luminosity of the central source obviatesthe need for a substantial contribution from a standard, thin accretion disk atthese wavelengths and calculate the accretion rate through an advectiondominated accretion flow to be mdot \sim 10^(-3) m_sun/yr. the agreementbetween these observations and the theoretical spectral energy distribution foradvection dominated flows provides evidence for the existence of an advectiondominated flow in this low luminosity agn.

astro-ph;9911045	high resolution mid-infrared imaging of ultraluminous infrared galaxies	observations of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) with an achievedresolution approaching the diffraction limit in the mid-infrared from 8 - 25$\mu$m using the keck telescopes are reported. we find extremely compactstructures, with spatial scales of $&lt; 0.3''$ (diameter) in six of the sevenulirgs observed. these compact sources emit between 30% and 100% of themid-infrared energy from these galaxies. we have utilized the compactmid-infrared structures as a diagnostic of whether an agn or a compact (100 --300 pc) starburst is the primary power source in these ulirgs. in markarian231, the upper limit on the diameter of the 12.5 $\mu$m source, 0.13$''$, showsthat the size of the infrared source must increase with increasing wavelength,consistent with agn models. in iras 05189-2524 and iras 08572+3915 there isstrong evidence that the source size increases with increasing wavelength. thissuggests heating by a central source rather than an extended luminosity source,consistent with the optical classification as an agn. the compact mid-infraredsources seen in the other galaxies cannot be used to distinguish the ultimateluminosity source. if these ulirgs are powered by compact starbursts, the starformation rates seen in the central few hundred parsecs far exceed the globalrates seen in nearby starburst galaxies, and approach the surface brightness ofindividual clusters in nearby starburst galaxies.

astro-ph;9912369	infrared spectroscopy of a massive obscured star cluster in the antennae  galaxies (ngc 4038/4039) with nirspec	we present infrared spectroscopy of the antennae galaxies (ngc 4038/4039)with nirspec at the w. m. keck observatory. we imaged the star clusters in thevicinity of the southern nucleus (ngc 4039) in 0.39" seeing in k-band usingnirspec's slit-viewing camera. the brightest star cluster revealed in thenear-ir (m_k(0) = -17.9) is insignificant optically, but coincident with thehighest surface brightness peak in the mid-ir (12-18 micron) iso imagepresented by mirabel et al. (1998). we obtained high signal-to-noise 2.03 -2.45 micron spectra of the nucleus and the obscured star cluster at r ~ 1900.  the cluster is very young (4 myr old), massive (16e6 m_sun), and compact(density ~ 115 m_sun pc^(-3) within a 32 pc half-light radius), assuming asalpeter imf (0.1 - 100 m_sun). its hot stars have a radiation fieldcharacterized by t_eff ~ 39,000 k, and they ionize a compact h ii region withn_e ~ 1e4 cm^(-3). the stars are deeply embedded in gas and dust (a_v ~ 9-10mag), and their strong fuv field powers a clumpy photodissociation region withdensities n_h &gt;= 1e5 cm^(-3) on scales of up to 200 pc, radiating l[h_2 1-0s(1)] = 9600 l_sun.

0810.0286	stis imaging of the hr 4796a circumstellar debris ring	we have obtained high spatial resolution imaging observations of the hr 4796acircumstellar debris dust ring using the broad optical response of the hubblespace telescope imaging spectrograph in coronagraphic mode. we use our visualwavelength observations to improve upon the earlier measured geometricalparameters of the ring-like disk. two significant flux density asymmetries arenoted: (1) preferential forward scattering by the disk grains and (2) anazimuthal surface brightness anisotropy about the morphological minor axis ofthe disk with corresponding differential ansal brightness. we find the debrisring offset from the location of the star by ~1.4 au, a shift insufficient toexplain the differing brightnesses of the ne and sw ansae simply by the 1/$r^2$dimmunition of starlight. the stis data also better quantify the radialconfinement of the starlight-scattering circumstellar debris, to acharacteristic region &lt;14 au in photometric half-width, with a significantlysteeper inner truncation than outward falloff in radial surface brightness. theinferred spatial distribution of the disk grains is consistent with thepossibility of one or more unseen co-orbital planetary-mass perturbers, and thecolors of the disk grains are consistent with a collisionally evolvedpopulation of debris, possibly including ices reddened by radiation exposure tothe central star.
