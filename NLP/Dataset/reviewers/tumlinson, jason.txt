0904.1992	the star formation camera	the star formation camera (sfc) is a wide-field (~15'x19, &gt;280 arcmin^2),high-resolution (18x18 mas pixels) uv/optical dichroic camera designed for thetheia 4-m space-borne space telescope concept. sfc will deliverdiffraction-limited images at lambda &gt; 300 nm in both a blue (190-517nm) and ared (517-1075nm) channel simultaneously. our aim is to conduct a comprehensiveand systematic study of the astrophysical processes and environments relevantfor the births and life cycles of stars and their planetary systems, and toinvestigate and understand the range of environments, feedback mechanisms, andother factors that most affect the outcome of the star and planet formationprocess. this program addresses the origins and evolution of stars, galaxies,and cosmic structure and has direct relevance for the formation and survival ofplanetary systems like our solar system and planets like earth. we present thedesign and performance specifications resulting from the implementation studyof the camera, conducted under nasa's astrophysics strategic mission conceptstudies program, which is intended to assemble realistic options for missiondevelopment over the next decade. the result is an extraordinarily capableinstrument that will provide deep, high-resolution imaging across a very widefield enabling a great variety of community science as well as completing thecore survey science that drives the design of the camera. the technologyassociated with the camera is next generation but still relatively high trl,allowing a low-risk solution with moderate technology development investmentover the next 10 years. we estimate the cost of the instrument to be $390mfy08.

0906.0983	on the absence of high metallicity-high column density damped lyman  alpha systems: molecule formation in a two-phase interstellar medium	we argue that the lack of observed damped lyman alpha (dla) systems thatsimultaneously have high hi columns densities and high metallicities resultsnaturally from the formation of molecules in the cold phase of a two-phaseatomic medium in pressure balance. our result applies equally well in diffusesystems where the ultraviolet radiation field is dominated by the extragalacticbackground and in dense star-forming ones, where the local radiation field islikely to be orders of magnitude higher. we point out that such aradiation-insensitive model is required to explain the absence of high column -high metallicity systems among dlas observed using gamma-ray burst afterglows,since these are likely subjected to strong radiation fields created by activestar formation in the grb host galaxy. moreover, we show that the observedrelationship between the maximum atomic gas column in dlas sets a firm upperlimit on the fraction of the mass in these systems that can be in the warm,diffuse phase. finally, we argue that our result explains the observed lack ofin situ star formation in dla systems.

0707.0816	carbon-enhanced hyper-metal-poor stars and the stellar imf at low  metallicity	the two known ``hyper-metal-poor'' (hmp) stars, he0107-5240 and he1327-2326,have extremely high enhancements of the light elements c, n, and o relative tofe and appear to represent a statistically significant excess populationrelative to the halo metallicity distribution extrapolated from [fe/h] &gt; -3.this study weighs the available evidence for and against three hypotheticalorigins for these stars: (1) that they formed from gas enriched by a primordial``faint supernova'', (2) that they formed from gas enriched by core-collapsesupernovae and c-rich gas ejected in rotation-driven winds from massive stars,and (3) that they formed as the low-mass secondaries in binary systems at z ~10^{-5.5} zsun and acquired their light-element enhancements from anintermediate-mass companion as it passed through an agb phase. the observationsinterpreted here, especially the depletion of lithium seen in he1327-2326,favor the binary mass-transfer hypothesis. if he0107-5240 and he1327-2326formed in binary systems, the statistically significant absence of isolatedand/or c-normal stars at similar [fe/h] implies that low-mass stars could format that metallicity, but that masses m ~&lt; 1.4 msun were disfavored in the imf.this result is also explained if the abundance-derived top-heavy imf forprimordial stars persists to [fe/h] ~ -5.5. this finding indicates thatlow-mass star formation was possible at extremely low metallicity, and that thetypical stellar mass may have had a complex dependence on metallicity ratherthan a sharp transition driven solely by gas cooling.

0911.1786	chemical evolution in hierarchical models of cosmic structure ii: the  formation of the milky way stellar halo and the distribution of the oldest  stars	this paper presents theoretical star formation and chemical enrichmenthistories for the stellar halo of the milky way based on new chemodynamicalmodeling. the goal of this study is to assess the extent to which metal-poorstars in the halo reflect the star formation conditions that occurred in haloprogenitor galaxies at high redshift, before and during the epoch ofreionization. simple prescriptions that translate dark-matter halo mass intobaryonic gas budgets and star formation histories yield models that resemblethe observed milky way halo in its total stellar mass, metallicitydistribution, and the luminosity function and chemical enrichment of dwarfsatellite galaxies. these model halos in turn allow an exploration of how thepopulations of interest for probing the epoch of reionization are distributedin physical and phase space, and of how they are related to lower-redshiftpopulations of the same metallicity. the fraction of stars dating from before aparticular time or redshift depends strongly on radius within the galaxy,reflecting the "inside-out" growth of cold-dark-matter halos, and onmetallicity, reflecting the general trend toward higher metallicity at latertimes. these results suggest that efforts to discover stars from z &gt; 6 - 10should select for stars with [fe/h] &lt;~ -3 and favor stars on more tightly boundorbits in the stellar halo, where the majority are from z &gt; 10 and 15 - 40% arefrom z &gt; 15. the oldest, most metal-poor stars - those most likely to revealthe chemical abundances of the first stars - are most common in the very centerof the galaxy's halo: they are in the bulge, but not of the bulge. these modelshave several implications for the larger project of constraining the propertiesof the first stars and galaxies using data from the local universe.

1001.4078	keck telescope constraint on cosmological variation of the  proton-to-electron mass ratio	molecular transitions recently discovered at redshift z_abs=2.059 toward thebright background quasar j2123-0050 are analysed to limit cosmologicalvariation in the proton-to-electron mass ratio, mu=m_p/m_e. observed with thekeck telescope, the optical echelle spectrum has the highest resolving powerand largest number (86) of h_2 transitions in such analyses so far. also,(seven) hd transitions are used for the first time to constrain mu-variation.these factors, and an analysis employing the fewest possible free parameters,strongly constrain mu's relative deviation from the current laboratory value:dmu/mu =(+5.6+/-5.5_stat+/-2.9_sys)x10^{-6}, indicating an insignificantlylarger mu in the absorber. this is the first keck result to complement recentnull constraints from three systems at z_abs&gt;2.5 observed with the very largetelescope. the main possible systematic errors stem from wavelength calibrationuncertainties. in particular, distortions in the wavelength solution on echelleorder scales are estimated to contribute approximately half the totalsystematic error component, but our estimate is model dependent and maytherefore under or overestimate the real effect, if present.  to assist future mu-variation analyses of this kind, and other astrophysicalstudies of h_2 in general, we provide a compilation of the most preciselaboratory wavelengths and calculated parameters important for absorption-linework with h_2 transitions redwards of the hydrogen lyman limit.

1007.0014	ionization corrections in a multi-phase interstellar medium: lessons  from a z~2 sub-dla	we present a high resolution (fwhm=2.7 km/s), high s/n echelle spectrum forthe z = 2.26 qso j2123-0050 and determine elemental abundances for the z = 2.06sub-dla in its line of sight. this high redshift sub-dla has a complexkinematic structure and harbours detections of neutral (si, ci), singly (e.g.cii, sii) and multiply ionized (e.g. civ, siiv) species as well as molecular hand hd. the plethora of detected transitions in various ionization stages isindicative of a complex multi-phase structure present in this high redshiftgalaxy. we demonstrate that the ionization corrections in this sub-dla aresignificant (up to ~0.7 dex). for example, if no ionization correction isapplied, a super-solar metallicity is derived ([s/h] = +0.36), whereas a singlephase ionization correction reduces this to [s/h] = -0.19. the theoreticalimpact of a multi-phase medium is investigated through cloudy modelling and itis found that the abundances of si, s and fe are always over-estimated (by upto 0.15 dex in our experiments) if a single-phase is assumed. therefore,although cloudy models improve estimates of metal column densities, thesimplification of a single phase medium leaves a systematic error in theresult, so that even ionization-corrected abundances may still be too high.without ionization corrections the properties of this sub-dla appear to requireextreme scenarios of nucleosynthetic origins. after ionization corrections areapplied the ism of this galaxy appears to be similar to some of the sightlinesthrough the milky way.

0709.2076	the stellar content of galaxy halos: a comparison between lambdacdm  models and observations of m31	recent observations have revealed that high surface-brightness, metal-richdebris is present over large regions of the andromeda (m31) stellar halo. weuse a set of numerical models to determine whether extended metal-rich debrisis expected to exist in galaxy halos formed in a hierarchical lambdacdmuniverse. we identify tidal debris in the simulations according to the currentbest surface brightness detection limits in m31 and demonstrate that brightfeatures in the outer halo regions usually originate from single satellites,with very little contamination from other sources due to the low probability oftidal streams from two overlapping accretion events. in contrast, high-surfacebrightness features in the inner halo often originate from multipleprogenitors. we also compare the age and metallicity distribution of the debriswith the well-mixed stellar halos in which they reside. we find thathigh-surface brightness tidal debris is produced almost exclusively byrelatively high mass progenitors (mstar ~ 10^7- 10^9 msun) and thus is expectedto be of moderate- to high-metallicity. similarly, in our models the smoothinner halo is expected to be metal-rich as this region has been built up mainlyfrom massive satellites. our results imply that the stellar populations ofsubstructure observed around external galaxies with current techniques shouldnot resemble old and metal-poor dwarf spheroidal satellites, nor the underlyingcomponent of the stellar halo.

1102.3927	the first observations of low redshift damped lyman-alpha systems with  the cosmic origins spectrograph	we report on the first cosmic origins spectrograph (cos) observations ofdamped and sub-damped lyman-alpha (dla) systems discovered in a new survey ofthe gaseous halos of low-redshift galaxies. from observations of 37 sightlines,we have discovered three dlas and four sub-dlas. we measure the neutral gasdensity omega(hi), and redshift density dn/dz, of dla and sub-dla systems atz&lt;0.35. we find dn/dz=0.25 and omega(hi)=1.4x10^-3 for dlas, and dn/dz=0.08with omega(hi)=4.2x10^-5 for sub-dlas over a redshift path delta z=11.9. todemonstrate the scientific potential of such systems, we present a detailedanalysis of the dla at z=0.1140 in the spectrum of sdss j1009+0713. profilefits to the absorption lines determine log n(h i)=20.68pm0.10 with ametallicity determined from the undepleted element sulfur of [s/h]=-0.62pm0.18.the abundance pattern of this dla is similar to that of higher z dlas, showingmild depletion of the refractory elements fe and ti with [s/fe]=+0.24pm0.22 and[s/ti]=+0.28pm0.15. nitrogen is underabundant in this system with[n/h]=-1.40pm0.14, placing this dla below the plateau of the [n/alpha]measurements in the local universe at similar metallicities. this dla has asimple kinematic structure with only two components required to fit theprofiles and a kinematic width of 52 km/s. imaging of the qso field with wfc3reveals a spiral galaxy at very small impact parameter to the qso and severalgalaxies within 10". followup spectra with lris reveal that none of the nearbygalaxies are at the redshift of the dla. the spiral galaxy is identified as thehost galaxy of the qso based on the near perfect alignment of the nucleus anddisk of the galaxy as well as spectra of an h ii region showing emission linesat the qso redshift. a small feature appears 0.70" from the nucleus of the qsoafter psf subtraction, providing another candidate for the host galaxy of thedla.

1211.1071	the effect of feedback and reionization on star formation in low-mass  dwarf galaxy haloes	we simulate the evolution of a 10^9 msun dark matter halo in a cosmologicalsetting with an adaptive-mesh refinement code as an analogue to local lowluminosity dwarf irregular and dwarf spheroidal galaxies. the primary goal ofour study is to investigate the roles of reionization and supernova feedback indetermining the star formation histories of low mass dwarf galaxies. we includea wide range of physical effects, including metal cooling, molecular hydrogenformation and cooling, photoionization and photodissociation from ametagalactic background, a simple prescription for self-shielding, starformation, and a simple model for supernova driven energetic feedback. we carryout simulations excluding each major effect in turn. we find that reionizationis primarily responsible for expelling most of the gas in our simulations, butthat supernova feedback is required to disperse the dense, cold gas in the coreof the halo. moreover, we show that the timing of reionization can produce anorder of magnitude difference in the final stellar mass of the system. for ourfull physics run with reionization at z=9, we find a stellar mass of about 10^5msun at z=0, and a mass-to-light ratio within the half-light radius ofapproximately 130 msun/lsun, consistent with observed low-luminosity dwarfs.however, the resulting median stellar metallicity is 0.06 zsun, considerablylarger than observed systems. in addition, we find star formation is truncatedbetween redshifts 4 and 7, at odds with the observed late time star formationin isolated dwarf systems but in agreement with milky way ultrafaint dwarfspheroidals. we investigate the efficacy of energetic feedback in our simplethermal-energy driven feedback scheme, and suggest that it may still sufferfrom excessive radiative losses, despite reaching stellar particle masses ofabout 100 msun, and a comoving spatial resolution of 11 pc.

1212.0558	the cos-halos survey: an empirical description of the metal-line  absorption in the low-redshift circumgalactic medium	we present the equivalent width and column density measurements for low andintermediate ionization states of the circumgalactic medium (cgm) surrounding44 low-z, l ~ l* galaxies drawn from the cos-halos survey. these measurementsare derived from far-uv transitions observed in hst/cos and keck/hires spectraof background quasars within an impact parameter r &lt; 160 kpc to the targetedgalaxies. the data show significant metal-line absorption for 33 of the 44galaxies, including quiescent systems, revealing the common occurance of a cool(t ~ 10^{4 - 5} k), metal-enriched cgm. the detection rates and columndensities derived for these metal lines decrease with increasing impactparameter, a trend we interpret as a declining metal surface density profilefor the cgm. a comparison of the relative column densities of adjacentionization states indicates the gas is predominantly ionized. the large surfacedensity in metals demands a large reservoir of metals and gas in the cool cgm(very conservatively, m_ cgmcool &gt; 10^9 msun), which likely traces a distinctdensity and/or temperature regime from the highly-ionized cgm traced by oviabsorption. the large dispersion in absorption strengths (includingnon-detections) suggests the cool cgm traces a wide range of densities or a mixof local ionizing conditions. lastly, the kinematics inferred from themetal-line profiles are consistent with the cool cgm being bound to the darkmatters halos hosting the galaxies; this gas may serve as fuel for futurestar-formation. future work will leverage this dataset to provide estimates onthe mass, metallicity, dynamics, and origin of the cool cgm in low-z, l*galaxies.

1306.5239	chemical abundance patterns and the early environment of dwarf galaxies	recent observations suggest that abundance pattern differences exist betweenlow metallicity stars in the milky way stellar halo and those in the dwarfsatellite galaxies. this paper takes a first look at what role the earlyenvironment for pre-galactic star formation might have played in shaping thesestellar populations. in particular, we consider whether differences incross-pollution between the progenitors of the stellar halo and the satellitescould help to explain the differences in abundance patterns. using an n-bodysimulation, we find that the progenitor halos of the main halo are primarilyclustered together at z=10 while the progenitors of the satellite galaxiesremain on the outskirts of this cluster. next, analytically modeledsupernova-driven winds show that main halo progenitors cross-pollute each othermore effectively while satellite galaxy progenitors remain more isolated. thus,inhomogeneous cross-pollution as a result of different high-z spatial locationsof each system's progenitors can help to explain observed differences inabundance patterns today. conversely, these differences are a signature of theinhomogeneity of metal enrichment at early times.

1307.2894	a mass-dependent yield origin of neutron-capture element abundance  distributions in ultra-faint dwarfs	one way to constrain the nature of the high-redshift progenitors of the milkyway is to look at the low-metallicity stellar populations of the differentgalactic components today. for example, high-resolution spectroscopy of verymetal poor (vmp) stars demonstrates remarkable agreement between thedistribution of [ti/fe] in the stellar populations of the milky way halo (mw)and ultra-faint dwarf (ufd) galaxies. in contrast, for the neutron capture (nc)abundance ratio distributions [(sr,ba)/fe], the peak of the small ufd sample (6stars) exhibits a signicant under-abundance relative to the vmp stars in thelarger mw halo sample (~ 300 stars). we present a simple scenario that cansimultaneously explain these similarities and differences by assuming: (i) thatthe mw vmp stars were predominately enriched by a prior generation of starswhich possessed a higher total mass than the prior generation of stars thatenriched the ufd vmp stars; and (ii) a much stronger mass-dependent yield (mdy)for nc-elements than for the (known) mdy for ti. simple statistical testsdemonstrate that conditions (i) and (ii) are consistent with the observedabundance distributions, albeit without strong constraints on model parameters.a comparison of the broad constraints for these nc-mdy with those derived inthe literature seems to rule out ba production from low-mass sns and affirmsmodels that primarily generate yields from high-mass sn. our scenario can beconfirmed by a relatively modest (factor of ~ 3-4) increase in the number ofhigh-resolution spectra of vmp stars in ufds.

1309.6317	the cos-halos survey: rationale, design, and a census of circumgalactic  neutral hydrogen	we present the design and methods of the cos-halos survey, a systematicinvestigation of the gaseous halos of 44 z = 0.15-0.35 galaxies usingbackground qsos observed with the cosmic origins spectrograph aboard the hubblespace telescope. this survey has yielded 39 spectra of z_em ~ 0.5 qsos with s/n~ 10-15 per resolution element. the qso sightlines pass within 150 physical kpcof the galaxies, which span early and late types over stellar mass log m* /msun= 9.5 - 11.5. we find that the cgm exhibits strong hi, averaging 1 ang inlya equivalent width out to 150 kpc, with 100% covering fraction forstar-forming galaxies and 75% covering for passive galaxies. we find goodagreement in column densities between this survey and previous studies oversimilar range of impact parameter. there is weak evidence for a differencebetween early- and late-type galaxies in the strength and distribution of hi.kinematics indicate that the detected material is bound to the host galaxy,such that &gt;~90% of the detected column density is confined within +/-200 kms^-1 of the galaxies. this material generally exists well below the halo virialtemperatures at t&lt;~ 10^5 k. we evaluate a number of possible origin scenariosfor the detected material, and in the end favor a simple model in which thebulk of the detected hi arises in a bound, cool, low-density photoionizeddiffuse medium that is generic to all l* galaxies and may harbor a totalgaseous mass comparable to galactic stellar masses.

1310.2253	a budget and accounting of metals at z~0: results from the cos-halos  survey	we present a budget and accounting of metals in and around star-forminggalaxies at $z\sim 0$. we combine empirically derived star formation historieswith updated supernova and agb yields and rates to estimate the total mass ofmetals produced by galaxies with present-day stellar mass of$10^{9.3}$--$10^{11.6} m_{\odot}$. on the accounting side of the ledger, weshow that a surprisingly constant 20--25% mass fraction of produced metalsremain in galaxies' stars, interstellar gas and interstellar dust, with littledependence of this fraction on the galaxy stellar mass (omitting those metalsimmediately locked up in remnants). thus, the bulk of metals are outside ofgalaxies, produced in the progenitors of today's $l^*$ galaxies. the cos-halossurvey is uniquely able to measure the mass of metals in the circumgalacticmedium (to impact parameters of $&lt; 150$ kpc) of low-redshift $\sim l^*$galaxies. using these data, we map the distribution of cgm metals as traced byboth the highly ionized ovi ion and a suite of low-ionization species; combinedwith constraints on circumgalactic dust and hotter x-ray emitting gas out tosimilar impact parameters, we show that $\sim 40$% of metals produced by$m_{\star}\sim 10^{10}m_{\odot}$ galaxies can be easily accounted for out to150 kpc. with the current data, we cannot rule out a constant mass of metalswithin this fixed physical radius. this census provides a crucial boundarycondition for the eventual fate of metals in galaxy evolution models.

1310.6267	the high-ion content and kinematics of low-redshift lyman limit systems	we study the high-ionization phase and kinematics of the circumgalacticmedium around low-redshift galaxies using a sample of 23 lyman limit systems(llss) at 0.08&lt;z&lt;0.93 observed with the cosmic origins spectrograph onboard thehubble space telescope. in lehner et al. (2013), we recently showed that low-zllss have a bimodal metallicity distribution. here we extend that analysis tosearch for differences between the high-ion and kinematic properties of themetal-poor and metal-rich branches. we find that metal-rich llss tend to showhigher o vi columns and broader o vi profiles than metal-poor llss. the total hi line width (dv90 statistic) in llss is not correlated with metallicity,indicating that the h i kinematics alone cannot be used to distinguish inflowfrom outflow and gas recycling. among the 17 llss with o vi detections, all buttwo show evidence of kinematic sub-structure, in the form of o vi-h i centroidoffsets, multiple components, or both. using various scenarios for how themetallicity in the high-ion and low-ion phases of each lls compare, weconstrain the ionized hydrogen column in the o vi phase to lie in the range logn(h ii)~17.6-20. the o vi phase of llss is a substantial baryon reservoir, withm(high-ion)~10^{8.5-10.9}(r/150 kpc)^2 solar masses, similar to the mass in thelow-ion phase. accounting for the o vi phase approximately doubles thecontribution of low-z llss to the cosmic baryon budget.

1311.2587	dissecting galaxy formation models with sensitivity analysis -- a new  approach to constrain the milky way formation history	[abridged] we present an application of a statistical tool known assensitivity analysis to characterize the relationship between input parametersand observational predictions of semi-analytic models of galaxy formationcoupled to cosmological $n$-body simulations. we show how a sensitivityanalysis can be performed on our chemo-dynamical model, chemtreen, tocharacterize and quantify its relationship between model input parameters andpredicted observable properties. the result of this analysis provides the userwith information about which parameters are most important and most likely toaffect the prediction of a given observable. it can also be used to simplifymodels by identifying input parameters that have no effect on the outputs ofinterest. conversely, it allows us to identify what model parameters can bemost efficiently constrained by the given observational data set. we haveapplied this technique to real observational data sets associated with themilky way, such as the luminosity function of satellite galaxies. a statisticalcomparison of model outputs and real observables is used to obtain a"best-fitting" parameter set. we consider different milky way-like dark matterhalos to account for the dependence of the best-fitting parameters selectionprocess on the underlying merger history of the models. for all formationhistories considered, running chemtreen with best-fitting parameters producedluminosity functions that tightly fit their observed counterpart. however, onlyone of the resulting stellar halo models was able to reproduce the observedstellar halo mass within 40 kpc of the galactic center. on the basis of thisanalysis it is possible to disregard certain models, and their correspondingmerger histories, as good representations of the underlying merger history ofthe milky way.

0802.0737	the molecular hydrogen deficit in gamma-ray burst afterglows	recent analysis of five gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglow spectra reveal theabsence of molecular hydrogen absorption lines, a surprising result in light oftheir large neutral hydrogen column densities and the detection of h$_2$ insimilar, more local star-forming regions like 30 doradus in the largemagellanic cloud (lmc). observational evidence further indicates that the bulkof the neutral hydrogen column in these sight lines lies 100 pc beyond theprogenitor and that h$_2$ was absent prior to the burst, suggesting that directflux from the star, fuv background fields, or both suppressed its formation. wepresent one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamical models of grb host galaxyenvironments, including self-consistent radiative transfer of both ionizing andlyman-werner photons, nine-species primordial chemistry with dust formation ofh$_2$, and dust extinction of uv photons. we find that a single grb progenitoris sufficient to ionize neutral hydrogen to distances of 50 - 100 pc but that agalactic lyman-werner background is required to dissociate the molecularhydrogen in the ambient ism. intensities of 0.1 - 100 times the galactic meanare necessary to destroy h$_2$ in the cloud, depending on its density andmetallicity. the minimum radii at which neutral hydrogen will be found inafterglow spectra is insensitive to the mass of the progenitor or the initialmass function (imf) of its cluster, if present.

1312.0606	tracing the evolution of high redshift galaxies using stellar abundances	this paper presents the first results from a model for chemical evolutionthat can be applied to n-body cosmological simulations and quantitativelycompared to measured stellar abundances from large astronomical surveys. thismodel convolves the chemical yield sets from a range of stellar nucleosynthesiscalculations (including agb stars, type ia and ii supernovae, and stellar windmodels) with a user-specified stellar initial mass function (imf) andmetallicity to calculate the time-dependent chemical evolution model for a"simple stellar population" of uniform metallicity and formation time. thesesimple stellar population models are combined with a semi-analytic model forgalaxy formation and evolution that uses merger trees from n-body cosmologicalsimulations to track several $\alpha$- and iron-peak elements for the stellarand multiphase interstellar medium components of several thousand galaxies inthe early ($z \geq 6$) universe. the simulated galaxy population is thenquantitatively compared to two complementary datasets of abundances in themilky way stellar halo, and is capable of reproducing many of the observedabundance trends. the observed abundance ratio distributions are qualitativelywell matched by our model, and the observational data is best reproduced with achabrier imf, a chemically-enriched star formation efficiency of $0.2$, and aredshift of reionization of $7$.

1401.0574	carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars: cemp-s and cemp-no sub-classes in the  halo system of the milky way	we explore the kinematics and orbital properties of a sample of 323 verymetal-poor stars in the halo system of the milky way, selected from thehigh-resolution spectroscopic follow-up studies of aoki et al. and yong et al.the combined sample contains a significant fraction of carbon-enhancedmetal-poor (cemp) stars (22% or 29%, depending on whether a strict or relaxedcriterion is applied for this definition). barium abundances (or upper limits)are available for the great majority of the cemp stars, allowing for theirseparation into the cemp-$s$ and cemp-no sub-classes. a new method to assignmembership to the inner- and outer-halo populations of the milky way isdeveloped, making use of the integrals of motion, and applied to determine therelative fractions of cemp stars in these two sub-classes for each halocomponent. although limited by small-number statistics, the data suggest thatthe inner halo of the milky way exhibits a somewhat higher relative number ofcemp-$s$ stars than cemp-no stars (57% vs. 43%), while the outer halo possessesa clearly higher fraction of cemp-no stars than cemp-$s$ stars (70% vs. 30%).although larger samples of cemp stars with known ba abundances are required,this result suggests that the dominant progenitors of cemp stars in the twohalo components were different; massive stars for the outer halo, andintermediate-mass stars in the case of the inner halo.

1403.0947	the cos-halos survey: physical conditions and baryonic mass in the  low-redshift circumgalactic medium	we analyze the physical conditions of the cool, photoionized (t $\sim 10^4$k) circumgalactic medium (cgm) using the cos-halos suite of gas column densitymeasurements for 44 gaseous halos within 160 kpc of $l \sim l^*$ galaxies at $z\sim 0.2$. these data are well described by simple photoionization models, withthe gas highly ionized (n$_{\rm hii}$/n$_{\rm h} \gtrsim 99\%$) by theextragalactic ultraviolet background (euvb). scaling by estimates for thevirial radius, r$_{\rm vir}$, we show that the ionization state (tracked by thedimensionless ionization parameter, u) increases with distance from the hostgalaxy. the ionization parameters imply a decreasing volume density profilen$_{\rm h}$ = (10$^{-4.2 \pm 0.25}$)(r/r$_{\rm vir})^{-0.8\pm0.3}$. our derivedgas volume densities are several orders of magnitude lower than predictionsfrom standard two-phase models with a cool medium in pressure equilibrium witha hot, coronal medium expected in virialized halos at this mass scale. applyingthe ionization corrections to the hi column densities, we estimate a lowerlimit to the cool gas mass m$_{\rm cgm}^{\rm cool} &gt; 6.5 \times 10^{10}$m$_{\odot}$ for the volume within r $&lt;$ r$_{\rm vir}$. allowing for anadditional warm-hot, ovi-traced phase, the cgm accounts for at least half ofthe baryons purported to be missing from dark matter halos at the 10$^{12}$m$_{\odot}$ scale.

1404.5514	the cos/uves absorption survey of the magellanic stream. iii:  ionization, total mass, and inflow rate onto the milky way	dynamic interactions between the two magellanic clouds have flung largequantities of gas into the halo of the milky way, creating the magellanicstream, the magellanic bridge, and the leading arm (collectively referred to asthe magellanic system). in this third paper of a series studying the magellanicgas in absorption, we analyze the gas ionization level using a sample of 69hubble space telescope/cosmic origins spectrograph sightlines that pass throughor within 30 degrees of the 21 cm-emitting regions. we find that 81% (56/69) ofthe sightlines show uv absorption at magellanic velocities, indicating that thetotal cross section of the magellanic system is ~11 000 square degrees, oraround a quarter of the entire sky. using observations of the si iii/si iiratio together with cloudy photoionization modeling, we calculate that thetotal mass (atomic plus ionized) of the magellanic system is ~2.0 billion solarmasses, with the ionized gas contributing over twice as much mass as the atomicgas. this is larger than the current-day interstellar h i mass of bothmagellanic clouds combined, indicating that they have lost most of theirinitial gas mass. if the gas in the magellanic system survives to reach thegalactic disk over its inflow time of ~0.5-1.5 gyr, it will represent anaverage inflow rate of ~3.7-6.7 solar masses per year, potentially raising thegalactic star formation rate. however, multiple signs of an evaporativeinteraction with the hot galactic corona indicate that the stream may notsurvive its journey to the disk fully intact, and will instead add material to(and cool) the corona.

1412.1480	probing the fermi bubbles in ultraviolet absorption: a spectroscopic  signature of the milky way's biconical nuclear outflow	giant lobes of plasma extend 55 degrees above and below the galactic center,glowing in emission from gamma rays (the fermi bubbles) to microwaves (the wmaphaze) and polarized radio waves. we use ultraviolet absorption-line spectrafrom the hubble space telescope to constrain the velocity of the outflowing gaswithin these regions, targeting the quasar pds 456 (galactic coordinatesl,b=10.4, +11.2 degrees). this sightline passes through a clear biconicalstructure seen in hard x-ray and gamma-ray emission near the base of thenorthern fermi bubble. we report two high-velocity metal absorption components,at v_lsr=-235 and +250 km/s, which cannot be explained by co-rotating gas inthe galactic disk or halo. their velocities are suggestive of an origin on thefront and back side of an expanding biconical outflow emanating from thegalactic center. we develop simple kinematic biconical outflow models that canexplain these observed profiles with an outflow velocity of ~900 km/s and afull opening angle of ~110 degrees (matching the x-ray bicone). this indicatesgalactic center activity over the last ~2.5-4.0 myr, in line with age estimatesof the fermi bubbles. the observations illustrate the use of uv absorption-linespectroscopy to probe the properties of swept-up gas venting into the fermibubbles.

1503.02084	baryon cycling in the low-redshift circumgalactic medium: a comparison  of simulations to the cos-halos survey	we analyze the low-redshift (z~0.2) circumgalactic medium by comparingabsorption-line data from the cos-halos survey to absorption around a matchedgalaxy sample from two cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. the modelsinclude different prescriptions for galactic outflows, namely hybridenergy/momentum driven wind (ezw), and constant winds (cw). we extract forcomparison direct observables including equivalent widths, covering factors,ion ratios, and kinematics. both wind models are generally in good agreementwith these observations for hi and certain low ionization metal lines, but showpoorer agreement with higher ionization metal lines including siiii and ovithat are well-observed by cos-halos. these discrepancies suggest that both windmodels predict too much cool, metal-enriched gas and not enough hot gas, and/orthat the metals are not sufficiently well-mixed. this may reflect our modelassumption of ejecting outflows as cool and unmixing gas. our ezw simulationincludes a heuristic prescription to quench massive galaxies by super-heatingits ism gas, which we show yields sufficient low ionisation absorption to bebroadly consistent with observations, but also substantial ovi absorption thatis inconsistent with data, suggesting that gas around quenched galaxies in thereal universe does not cool. at impact parameters of &lt;50 kpc, recycling windsdominate the absorption of low ions and even hi, while ovi almost always arisesfrom metals ejected longer than 1 gyr ago. the similarity between the windmodels is surprising, since we show that they differ substantially in theirpredicted amount and phase distribution of halo gas. we show that thissimilarity owes mainly to our comparison here at fixed stellar mass rather thanat fixed halo mass in our previous works, which suggests that cgm propertiesare more closely tied to the stellar mass of galaxies rather than halo mass.

1512.00853	a deep search for faint galaxies associated with very low-redshift c iv  absorbers: iii. a galaxy sample complete to 0.01 l* and evidence for  environmental effects	we employ a blindly selected sample of low-redshift c iv absorption systemsidentified in spectra from the hubble space telescope (hst) cosmic originsspectrograph (cos), combined with galaxy data from the sloan digital sky survey(sdss), to study the metal-enriched circumgalactic medium (cgm) with ~100%completeness for galaxy luminosities l &gt; 0.01 l* at z &lt; 0.015. we find thatgalaxies are typically found at the c iv absorber redshifts within impactparameters rho &lt; 200 kpc, with the nearest galaxy having l &lt; 0.1 l* for 78% ofthe absorbers. the ubiquity of faint dwarfs in close proximity to the absorberssuggests that these galaxies affect the enrichment and physical conditions ofmassive-galaxy halos. however, a fraction of our sample (33%) arise welloutside the virial radius of any nearby galaxy brighter than 0.01 l*. thedetection rate for c iv absorption within the virial radius is mass dependentand is considerably higher for l &gt;~0.1 l* galaxies (7/8) than for less luminousgalaxies (1/10). we also find that the occurrence of c iv absorbers dependsstrongly on the broader environment: 67% (8/12) of galaxies with rho &lt; 150 kpcin regions of low galaxy density (regions with fewer than ten 0.1 l* galaxieswithin 1 mpc) have affiliated c iv absorption while none (0/9) of the galaxiesin denser regions show c iv within rho &lt; 150 kpc. the reduced detection rate ofc iv in denser environments persists for massive group dark matter halos. incontrast, h i is pervasive in the cgm without regard to mass or environment,although some of these ly-alpha absorbers could arise in unrelatedintergalactic gas.

astro-ph;0011303	probing the first stars with hydrogen and helium recombination emission	unusual patterns of recombination emission from gas ionized by metal-freestars may distinguish early star-forming galaxies from their present-daycounterparts. this pattern arises from the harder ionizing spectrum expectedfrom metal-free stars, which strongly enhances the strength of he iirecombination lines. our calculations indicate that line fluxes of he ii 1640and 4686 are sufficiently large to be detected by narrowband and spectroscopicsearches for high-redshift emission-line sources at redshift z ~ 5 usingcurrent instruments. an unknown fraction of lya emitters may harborlow-metallicity or metal-free stars. as the predicted he ii 1640 flux iscomparable to and may exceed hydrogen lya, searches for high-redshift galaxiesshould consider he ii recombination lines as possible identifications forsingle emission lines in observed spectra. spectra of metal-free stars may showboth h i and he ii emission lines, improving the constraints on their redshiftand identification. we assess the considerable uncertainties that affect ourexpectations for the detection and identification of true first-generationstars with present search techniques, including the role of stellar mass lossin spectral evolution and the confusion of ionization by primordial stellarsources and agn in the early universe.

astro-ph;0108371	the ionization and metallicity of the intervening o vi absorber at z =  0.1212 in the spectrum of h1821+643	we use high-resolution uv spectra of the radio-quiet qso h1821+643 (z_em =0.297), obtained with stis and fuse, to study the ionization and metallicity ofan intervening o vi absorption line system at z(abs) = 0.1212. this absorberhas the following notable properties: (1) several galaxies are close to thesight line at the absorber redshift, including an actively star-forming galaxyat a projected distance of 144 kpc. (2) there is a complex cluster of h i lyaabsorption lines near the o vi redshift, including at least five componentsspread over a velocity range of ~700 km/s . (3) the strongest lya line in thecluster appears to be composed of a mildly saturated component with a typicalb-value blended with a broad component with b = 85 km/s . (4) the o viabsorption is not aligned with the strongest h i absorption, but instead iswell-aligned with the broad component. (5) the only detected species (&gt;4sigma)are o vi and h i despite coverage of strong transitions of other abundantelements. based on these constraints, we find that the absorption lineproperties can be produced in collisionally ionized gas with roughly 5.3 &lt; logt &lt; 5.6 and -1.8 &lt; [o/h] &lt; -0.6. however, we find that photoionization is alsoviable if the pathlength l through the absorbing gas is long enough; simplephotoionization models require 85 &lt; l &lt; 1900 kpc and -1.1 &lt; [o/h] &lt; -0.3. webriefly discuss how observations of x-ray absorption lines due to o vii and oviii could be used, in principle, to break the ionization mechanism degeneracy.

astro-ph;0206389	cosmological effects of the first stars: evolving spectra of population  iii	the first stars hold intrinsic interest for their uniqueness and for theirpotential importance to galaxy formation, chemical enrichment, and feedback onthe intergalactic medium (igm). the metal-free composition of the first starsrestricts the stellar energy source to proton-proton burning rather than themore efficient cno cycle. consequently they are hotter, smaller, and haveharder spectra than their present-day counterparts of finite metallicity. wepresent new results from a continuing study of metal-free stars from acosmological point of view. we have calculated evolving spectra of pop iiiclusters, derived from a grid of zero-metallicity stellar evolutionary tracks.we find that h-ionizing photon production from metal-free stellar clusterstakes twice as long as that of pop ii to decline to 1/10 its peak value. inaddition, metal-free stars produce substantially more photons than pop ii inthe heii ($e &gt; 4$ ryd) continuum. we suggest that large ly$\alpha$ equivalentwidths ($w_{\rm ly\alpha} &gt; 400$ angstroms) may provide a means of detectingmetal-free stellar populations at high redshift, and that heii recombinationlines ($\lambda$1640, $\lambda$4686) may confirm identifications of populationiii. while pop iii clusters are intrinsically bluer than their pop iicounterparts, nebular continuum emission makes up this difference and mayconfuse attempts to discern pop iii stars with broadband colors. in a companionpaper, we explore the consequences of evolving spectra of pop iii for thereionization of the igm in both h and he.

astro-ph;0206390	evolving spectra of pop iii stars: consequences for cosmological  reionization	we examine the significance of the first metal-free stars (pop iii) for thecosmological reionization of hi and heii. these stars have unusually hardspectra, with the integrated ionizing photon rates from a pop iii stellarcluster for hi and heii being 1.6 and $10^5$ times stronger respectively thanthose from a pop ii cluster. for the currently favored cosmology, we find thatpop iii stars alone can reionize hi and heii at redshifts, $z$ of about 9 (4.7)and 5.1 (0.7) for continuous (instantaneous) modes of star formation. morerealistic scenarios involving combinations of pop iii and pop ii stellarspectra yield similar results for hydrogen. helium never reionizes completelyin these cases; the ionization fraction of heiii reaches a maximum of about 60percent at $z$ of about 5.6 if pop iii star formation lasts for $10^9$ yr.future data on hi reionization can test the amount of small-scale poweravailable to the formation of the first objects, and provide a constraint onvalues of $\sigma_8$ less than or about 0.7. since current uv observationsindicate an epoch of reionization for heii at $z$ of about 3, heii may reionizemore than once. measurements of the heii gunn-peterson effect in theintergalactic medium at redshifts exceeding about 3 may reveal the significanceof pop iii stars for heii reionization, particularly in void regions that maycontain relic ionization from early pop iii stellar activity.

astro-ph;0209405	inferring physical conditions in interstellar clouds of h_2	we have developed a code that models the formation, destruction, radiativetransfer, and vibrational/rotational excitation of h_2 in a detailed fashion.we discuss how such codes, together with fuse observations of h_2 in diffuseand translucent lines of sight, may be used to infer various physicalparameters. we illustrate the effects of changes in the major physicalparameters (uv radiation field, gas density, metallicity), and we point out theextent to which changes in one parameter may be mirrored by changes in another.we provide an analytic formula for the molecular fraction, f_h2, as a functionof cloud column density, radiation field, and grain formation rate of h_2. somediffuse and translucent lines of sight may be concatenations of multipledistinct clouds viewed together. such situations can give rise to observablesthat agree with the data, complicating the problem of uniquely identifying oneset of physical parameters with a line of sight. finally, we illustrate theapplication of our code to an ensemble of data, such as the fuse survey of h_2in the large and small magellanic clouds (lmc/smc), in order to constrain theelevated uv radiation field intensity and reduced grain formation rate of h_2in those low- metallicity environments.

astro-ph;0401376	nucleosynthesis, reionization, and the mass function of the first stars	we critique the hypothesis that the first stars were very massive stars (vms;m &gt; 140 msun). we review the two major lines of evidence for the existence ofvms: (1) that the relative metal abundances of extremely metal-poor galactichalo stars show evidence of vms enrichment, and (2) that the highelectron-scattering optical depth (tau_e) to the cmb found by wmap requires vmsfor reionization in a concordance lambdacdm cosmology. the supernova yieldpatterns of vms are incompatible with the fe-peak and r-process abundances inhalo stars. models including type ii supernovae and/or ``hypernovae'' frommetal-free progenitors with 8 - 40 msun can better explain the observed trends.with a simple metal-transport model, we estimate that halo enrichment curtailsmetal-free star formation after ~10^8 yr at z ~ 20. because the ionizing photonefficiency of metal-free stars peaks at ~120 msun and declines at higher mass,an imf with a lower bound at m ~ 10 - 20 msun and no vms can maximize theionizing photon budget and still be consistent with the nucleosyntheticevidence. an imf devoid of low-mass stars is justified independently by modelsof the formation of primordial stars. using a semi-analytic model for h i andhe ii reionization, we find that such an imf can reproduce tau_e = 0.10 - 0.14,consistent with the range from wmap. we conclude, on the basis of theseresults, that vms are not necessary to meet the existing constraints commonlytaken to motivate them.

astro-ph;0501543	hot baryons and the distribution of metals in the intergalactic medium	we use the observed number and column-density distributions of intergalactico vi absorbers to constrain the distribution of metals in the low-redshiftintergalactic medium (igm). in this simple model the metals in the o viabsorbers are assumed to be produced in and propagated from low-redshiftgalaxies drawn from a real sample, in this case the sloan digital sky survey(sdss). this model can explain the observed dn/dz of metals seen in o viabsorbers if these metals are dispersed out to ~ 200 kpc by galaxies down to l\~ 0.01 - 0.1 l_r^*. massive galaxies (l ~ l_r^*) by themselves cannot providethe necessary enrichment unless they can enrich volumes out to $\gtrsim 0.5 - 1mpc. alternatively, our model allows an estimate of the fraction of o viabsorbers directly caused by galaxies rather than hot igm. with this assumptionwe explore the possible connections between the intergalactic o vi absorbersand the known populations of highly-ionized high-velocity clouds (hvcs)surrounding the milky way. our model predicts that more sensitive, completesurveys optimized to uncover weaker o vi absorbers will find the tentativeturnover below log n(o vi) ~ 13.5 to be a real effect resulting from theapparently limited volumes over which galaxies can enrich the igm. if so, itwould indicate that metals are not as widespread throughout the low-density igmas they are assumed to be in cosmological simulations of the whim.

astro-ph;0602179	local group dwarf galaxies and the contribution of the first stars to  reionization	the local group contains some dwarf galaxies that apparently formed all theirstars early, lost their gas to winds or ionization, and survive today as``fossils'' from the epoch of reionization. this study presents new models ofthese objects based on the hierarchical chemical evolution framework oftumlinson (2006). the model accurately reproduces the observedluminosity-metallicity relation of fossil dwarf galaxies with minimal freeparameters. when calibrated to this relation, the models show that small darkmatter ``minihalos'' formed 2 - 8% of their baryonic mass into stars priorduring reionization. by tracking the chemical enrichment of these early halosthe models specify that metal-free first stars contributed approximately 5 - 10% of the ionizing photons generated by these small halos and so did notdominate reionization. models that allow for larger relative contributions frommetal-free stars may not generate enough total ionizing photons for earlyreionization. as significant star formation in early minihalos is a requirementof many successful models for the igm reionization, these models can beconsidered to pass a key test of their validity. it appears we have as much tolearn about reionization from the universe at z = 0 as at z = 6.

astro-ph;0608301	discovery of a metal-line absorber associated with a local dwarf  starburst galaxy	we present optical and near-infrared images, h i 21 cm emission maps, opticalspectroscopy, and hubble space telescope/space telescope imaging spectrographultraviolet spectroscopy of the qso/galaxy pair sbs 1122+594/ic 691. the qsosight line lies at a position angle of 27 degrees from the minor axis of thenearby dwarf starburst galaxy ic 691 (cz_gal = 1204+-3 km/s, l_b ~ 0.09 l*,current star formation rate = 0.08-0.24 solar masses per year) and 33 kpc (6.6arcmin) from its nucleus. we find that ic 691 has an h i mass of m_hi =(3.6+-0.1) x 10^8 solar masses and a dynamical mass of m_dyn = (3.1+-0.5) x10^10 solar masses. the uv spectrum of sbs 1122+594 shows a metal-line(ly-alpha + c iv) absorber near the redshift of ic 691 at cz_abs = 1110+-30km/s. since ic 691 is a dwarf starburst and the sbs 1122+594 sight line lies inthe expected location for an outflowing wind, we propose that the best modelfor producing this metal-line absorber is a starburst wind from ic 691. weplace consistent metallicity limits on ic 691 ([z/zsun] ~ -0.7) and themetal-line absorber ([z/zsun] &lt; -0.3). we also find that the galaxy's escapevelocity at the absorber location is v_esc = 80+-10 km/s and derive a windvelocity of v_w = 160+-50 km/s. thus, the evidence suggests that ic 691produces an unbound starburst wind that escapes from its gravitationalpotential to transport metals and energy to the surrounding intergalacticmedium.

astro-ph;0703666	missing molecular hydrogen and the physical conditions of grb host  galaxies	we examine the abundance of molecular hydrogen (h2) in the spectra of gammaray burst afterglows (grbs). in nearby galaxies h2 traces the cold neutralmedium (cnm) and dense molecular star-forming interstellar gas. though h2 isdetected in at least half of all sightlines towards hot stars in the magellanicclouds and in ~25% of damped lya systems toward quasars, it is not detected inany of the five grb environments with a similar range of neutral hydrogencolumn and metallicity. we detect no vibrationally-excited h2 that would implythe grb itself has photodissociated its parent molecular cloud, so such modelsare ruled out unless the parent cloud was &lt;~4 pc in radius and was fullydissociated prior to the spectroscopic observations, or the star escaped itsparent cloud during its main-sequence lifetime. the low molecular fractions forthe grbs are mysterious in light their large column densities of neutral h andexpectations based on local analogs, i.e. 30 doradus in the lmc. thissurprising lack of h2 in grb-dlas indicates that the destruction processes thatsuppress molecule formation in the lmc and smc are more effective in the grbhosts, most probably a combination of low metallicity and an fuv radiationfield 10--100 times the galactic mean field. these inferred conditions placestrong constraints on the star forming regions in these early galaxies.

0809.3831	molecular hydrogen in the fuse translucent lines of sight: the full  sample	we report total abundances and related parameters for the full sample of thefuse survey of molecular hydrogen in 38 translucent lines of sight. new resultsare presented for the "second half" of the survey involving 15 lines of sightto supplement data for the first 23 lines of sight already published. we assessthe correlations between molecular hydrogen and various extinction parametersin the full sample, which covers a broader range of conditions than the initialsample. in particular, we are now able to confirm that many, but not all, linesof sight with shallow far-uv extinction curves and large values of thetotal-to-selective extinction ratio, $r_v$ = $a_v$ / $e(b-v)$ -- characteristicof larger than average dust grains -- are associated with particularly lowhydrogen molecular fractions ($f_{\rm h2}$). in the lines of sight with large$r_v$, there is in fact a wide range in molecular fractions, despite theexpectation that the larger grains should lead to less h$_2$ formation.however, we see specific evidence that the molecular fractions in thissub-sample are inversely related to the estimated strength of the uv radiationfield and thus the latter factor is more important in this regime. we haveprovided an update to previous values of the gas-to-dust ratio, $n$(h$_{\rmtot}$)/$e(b-v)$, based on direct measurements of $n$(h$_2$) and $n$(h i).although our value is nearly identical to that found with copernicus data, itextends the relationship by a factor of 2 in reddening. finally, as the newlines of sight generally show low to moderate molecular fractions, we stillfind little evidence for single monolithic "translucent clouds" with $f_{\rmh2}$ $\sim$ 1.

astro-ph;9907174	new hst observations of the halo gas of ngc 3067: limits on the  extragalactic ionizing background at low redshift and the lyman continuum  escape fraction	we present uv spectroscopy from hst/ghrs and reanalyze existing h_alphaimages of the quasar/galaxy pair 3c 232/ngc 3067 and of the halo gas associatedwith ngc 3067. the spectra permit measurement of, or limits on, the columndensities of fe i, fe ii, mg i, and mg ii in the absorbing cloud. two distinctmodels of the extragalactic radiation field are considered: (1) the ionizingspectrum is dominated by a power-law extragalactic continuum, and (2) thepower-law spectrum contains a lyman break, implying enhanced flux longward of912 a relative to the hydrogen-ionizing flux. the h_alpha images constrain theescape fraction of lyman continuum photons from the galaxy to f_esc &lt;= 0.02.with the assumption that the cloud is shielded from all galactic contributions,we can constrain the intensity and shape of the extragalactic continuum. for anagn-dominated power-law extragalactic spectrum, we derive a limit on theextragalactic ionizing flux phi_ion &gt;= 2600 photons cm^-2 s^-1, or i_0 &gt;=10^-23 erg cm^-2 s^-1 hz^-1 sr^-1 for an ionizing spectrum with power-law indexof 1.8 and a cloud of constant density. when combined with previous upperlimits from the absence of h_alpha recombination emission from intergalacticclouds, our observations require 2600 &lt;= phi_ion &lt;= 10000 photons cm^-2 s^-1.we show that if galactic contributions to the incident radiation are important,it is difficult to constrain phi_ion. these results demonstrate that galactichalo opacities and their wavelength dependence are crucial to understanding theabundance of low-ionization metals in the igm.

astro-ph;9911339	zero-metallicity stars and the effects of the first stars on  reionization	we present stellar structure and atmosphere models of metal-free stars andexamine them from a cosmological point of view. metal-free stars exhibit higheffective temperatures and small sizes relative to metal-enriched stars ofequal mass. these unique physical characteristics enhance the ionizing photonproduction by metal-free stars, particularly in the he ii (e &gt; = 4 ryd)continuum. the star formation rate of metal-free stars necessary to reionizethe hydrogen in the universe by z = 5 is consistent with the inferred starformation rate at that epoch. however, the hard stellar spectra areinconsistent with the observations of he ii opacity in the igm at z ~ 3,indicating that the period of metal-free star formation ended before thatepoch. we examine the effects of these stars on the ionization balance of theigm, the radiative feedback of the first luminous objects, and theextragalactic radiation field. we comment on the prospects for detectingmetal-free stellar populations with the 1640 a and 4686 a recombination linesof he ii.

0811.0004	the atomic to molecular transition in galaxies. ii: hi and h_2 column  densities	gas in galactic disks is collected by gravitational instabilities into giantatomic-molecular complexes, but only the inner, molecular parts of thesestructures are able to collapse to form stars. determining what controls theratio of atomic to molecular hydrogen in complexes is therefore a significantproblem in star formation and galactic evolution. in this paper we use themodel of h_2 formation, dissociation, and shielding developed in the previouspaper in this series to make theoretical predictions for atomic to molecularratios as a function of galactic properties. we find that the molecularfraction in a galaxy is determined primarily by its column density andsecondarily by its metallicity, and is to good approximation independent of thestrength of the interstellar radiation field. we show that the column of atomichydrogen required to shield a molecular region against dissociation is ~10 msunpc^-2 at solar metallicity. we compare our model to data from recent surveys ofthe milky way and of nearby galaxies, and show that the both the primarydependence of molecular fraction on column density and the secondary dependenceon metallicity that we predict are in good agreement with observed galaxyproperties.
