0902.0263	the correlation of spectral lag evolution with prompt optical emission  in grb 080319b	we report on observations of correlated behavior between the prompt gamma-rayand optical emission from grb 080319b, which confirm that (i) they occurredwithin the same astrophysical source region and (ii) their respective radiationmechanisms were dynamically coupled. our results, based upon a new ccfmethodology for determining the time-resolved spectral lag, are summarized asfollows. first, the evolution in the arrival offset of prompt gamma-ray photoncounts between swift-bat 15-25 kev and 50-100 kev energy bands (intrinsicgamma-ray spectral lag) appears to be anti-correlated with the arrival offsetbetween prompt 15-350 kev gamma-rays and the optical emission observed bytortora (extrinsic optical/gamma-ray spectral lag), thus effectivelypartitioning the burst into two main episodes at ~t+28+/-2 sec. second, therise and decline of prompt optical emission at ~t+10+/-1 sec and ~t+50+/-1 sec,respectively, both coincide with discontinuities in the hard to soft evolutionof the photon index for a power law fit to 15-150 kev swift-bat data at~t+8+/-2 sec and ~t+48+/-1 sec. these spectral energy changes also coincidewith intervals whose time-resolved spectral lag values are consistent withzero, at ~t+12+/-2 sec and ~t+50+/-2 sec. these results, which are robustacross heuristic permutations of swift-bat energy channels and varying temporalbin resolution, have also been corroborated via independent analysis ofkonus-wind data. this potential discovery may provide the first observationalevidence for an implicit connection between spectral lags and grb emissionmechanisms in the context of canonical fireball phenomenology. future workincludes exploring a subset of bursts with prompt optical emission to probe theunique or ubiquitous nature of this result.

0902.2419	discerning the physical origins of cosmological gamma-ray bursts based  on multiple observational criteria: the cases of z=6.7 grb 080913, z=8.3 grb  090423, and some short/hard grbs	(abridged) the two high-redshift gamma-ray bursts, grb 080913 at z=6.7 andgrb 090423 at z=8.3, recently detected by swift appear as intrinsically short,hard grbs. they could have been recognized by batse as short/hard grbs shouldthey have occurred at z &lt;= 1. we perform a more thorough investigation on twophysically distinct types (type i/ii) of cosmological grbs and theirobservational characteristics. we reiterate the definitions of type i/ii grbsand review the observational criteria and their physical motivations. contraryto the traditional approach of assigning the physical category based on thegamma-ray properties (duration, hardness, and spectral lag), we take analternative approach to define the type i and type ii gold samples usingseveral criteria that are more directly related to the grb progenitors, andstudy the properties of the two gold samples and compare them with thetraditional long/soft and short/hard samples. we find that the type ii goldsample reasonably tracks the long/soft population, although it includes severalintrinsically short (shorter than 1s in the rest frame) grbs. the type i goldsample only has 5 grbs, 4 of which are not strictly short but have extendedemission. other short/hard grbs detected in the swift era represent the batseshort/hard sample well, but it is unclear whether all of them belong to type i.we suggest that some (probably even most) high-luminosity short/hard grbsinstead belong to type ii. we suggest that grb 080913 and grb 090423 are morelikely type ii events. we re-emphasize the importance of invoking multipleobservational criteria, and cautiously propose an operational procedure toinfer the physical origin of a given grb with available multiple observationalcriteria, with various caveats laid out.

0902.3022	multi-messenger astronomy with grbs: a white paper for the astro2010  decadal survey	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are relativistic cosmological beacons of transienthigh energy radiation whose afterglows span the electromagnetic spectrum.theoretical expectations of correlated neutrino and/or gravitational wave (gw)emission position grbs at an astrophysical nexus for a metamorphosis in ourunderstanding of the cosmos. this new dawn in the era of experimental(particle) astrophysics and cosmology is afforded by current and plannedfacilities enabling the novel astronomies of high energy neutrinos andgravitational waves, in concert with unprecedented electromagnetic coverage. inthis white paper, we motivate grbs as a compelling scientific theme andhighlight key technical advances that may facilitate fundamental breakthroughsin the context of swift, fermi, icecube and ligo (laser interferometergravitational wave observatory), whose capabilities would be augmented withjanus (joint astrophysics nascent universe satellite), exist (energetic x-rayimaging survey telescope) and lisa (laser interferometer space antenna).scientific synergy will be achieved by leveraging the combined sensitivity ofcontemporaneous ground-based and satellite observatories, thus optimizing theircollective discovery potential for: (i) revealing the origin(s) andacceleration mechanism(s) of cosmic rays, (ii) exposing grb progenitor(s) and(iii) exploring the high-z cosmos. hence, the advent of grb multi-messengerastronomy may cement an explicit connection to fundamental physics, via nascentcosmic windows, throughout the next decade and beyond.

0903.1258	late-time detections of the x-ray afterglow of grb 060729 with chandra -  the latest detections ever of an x-ray afterglow	we report on 5 chandra observations of the x-ray afterglow of the gamma-rayburst grb 060729 performed between 2007 march and 2008 may. in all fiveobservations the afterglow is clearly detected. the last chandra pointing wasperformed on 2008-may-04, 642 days after the burst - the latest detection of agrb x-ray afterglow ever. a reanalysis of the swift xrt light curve togetherwith the three detections by chandra in 2007 reveals a break at about 1.0 msafter the burst with a slight steepening of the decay slope from alpha = 1.32to 1.61. this break coincides with a significant hardening of the x-rayspectrum, consistent with a cooling break in the wind medium scenario, in whichthe cooling frequency of the afterglow crosses the x-ray band. the last twochandra observations in 2007 december and 2008 may provide evidence for anotherbreak at about one year after the burst. if interpreted as a jet break, thislate-time break implies a jet half opening angle of about 14 degrees for a windmedium. alternatively, this final break may have a spectral origin, in whichcase no jet break has been observed and the half-opening angle of the jet ofgrb 060729 must be larger than about 15 degrees for a wind medium. we comparethe x-ray afterglow of grb 060729 in a wind environment with other bright x-rayafterglows, in particular grbs 061121 and 080319b, and discuss why the x-rayafterglow of grb 060729 is such an exceptionally long-lasting event.

0908.2819	high energy emission from massive stars: the precocious x-ray recovery  of eta carinae after january 2009 minimum	we observed the massive binary stellar system of eta carinae in the 0.3-10kev energy range with the x-ray telescope onboard the swift satellite duringthe period 15 december 2008 - 11 march 2009, i.e. 1 month before to 2 monthsafter the x-ray drop from maximum to minimum, thought to be associated with theperiastron encounter of the primary star by the hot companion. beginning a fewmonths before eclipse, the interaction between the winds of the two starsintensifies and the x-ray flux reaches maximum. the flux drops dramaticallythereafter, subsiding in about 20 days to a level that is at least a factor 10lower than the 'high state', i.e. the x-ray emission state of the system duringthe largest fraction of its 5.52 yr orbit (~e-11 erg/s/cm2). unlike in previouscycles, when the low state lasted about 2.5 months, observations with rxteshowed that the x-ray flux started its recovery to normal level about 1.5months after the minimum. we suggest that this early recovery may be due to thefact that the companion wind reaches terminal velocity before encountering theshock.

0910.2456	threshold for extended emission in short gamma-ray bursts	the initial pulse complex (ipc) in short gamma-ray bursts is sometimesaccompanied by a softer, low-intensity extended emission (ee) component. incases where such a component is not observed, it is not clear if it is presentbut below the detection threshold. using bayesian block (bb) methods, wemeasure the ee component and show that it is present in one quarter of aswift/bat sample of 51 short bursts, as was found for the compton/batse sample.we simulate bursts with ee to calibrate the bat threshold for ee detection andshow that this component would have been detected in nearly half of bat shortbursts if it were present, to intensities ~ 10^-2 counts cm^-2 s^-1, a factorof five lower than actually observed in short bursts. in the bat sample theratio of average ee intensity to ipc peak intensity, rint, ranges over a factorof 25, rint ~ 3 x 10^-3 to 8 x 10^-2. in comparison, for the average of the 39bursts without an ee component, the 2-sigma upper limit is rint &lt; 8 x 10^-4.these results suggest that a physical threshold effect operates near rint ~ fewx 10^-3, below which the ee component is not manifest.

1007.4842	the absolute magnitudes of type ia supernovae in the ultraviolet	we examine the absolute magnitudes and light-curve shapes of 14nearby(redshift z = 0.004--0.027) type ia supernovae (sne~ia) observed in theultraviolet (uv) with the swift ultraviolet/optical telescope. colors andabsolute magnitudes are calculated using both a standard milky way (mw)extinction law and one for the large magellanic cloud that has been modified bycircumstellar scattering. we find very different behavior in the near-uvfilters (uvw1_rc covering ~2600-3300 a after removing optical light, and u~3000--4000 a) compared to a mid-uv filter (uvm2 ~2000-2400 a). the uvw1_rc-bcolors show a scatter of ~0.3 mag while uvm2-b scatters by nearly 0.9 mag.similarly, while the scatter in colors between neighboring filters is small inthe optical and somewhat larger in the near-uv, the large scatter in theuvm2-uvw1 colors implies significantly larger spectral variability below 2600a. we find that in the near-uv the absolute magnitudes at peak brightness ofnormal sne ia in our sample are correlated with the optical decay rate with ascatter of 0.4 mag, comparable to that found for the optical in our sample.however, in the mid-uv the scatter is larger, ~1 mag, possibly indicatingdifferences in metallicity. we find no strong correlation between either the uvlight-curve shapes or the uv colors and the uv absolute magnitudes. with largersamples, the uv luminosity might be useful as an additional constraint to helpdetermine distance, extinction, and metallicity in order to improve the utilityof sne ia as standardized candles.

0708.3968	spectral evolution of grb 060904a observed with swift and suzaku --  possibility of inefficient electron acceleration	we observed an x-ray afterglow of grb 060904a with the swift and suzakusatellites. we found rapid spectral softening during both the prompt tail phaseand the decline phase of an x-ray flare in the bat and xrt data. the observedspectra were fit by power-law photon indices which rapidly changed from $\gamma= 1.51^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ to $\gamma = 5.30^{+0.69}_{-0.59}$ within a few hundredseconds in the prompt tail. this is one of the steepest x-ray spectra everobserved, making it quite difficult to explain by simple electron accelerationand synchrotron radiation. then, we applied an alternative spectral fittingusing a broken power-law with exponential cutoff (bpec) model. it is valid toconsider the situation that the cutoff energy is equivalent to the synchrotronfrequency of the maximum energy electrons in their energy distribution. sincethe spectral cutoff appears in the soft x-ray band, we conclude the electronacceleration has been inefficient in the internal shocks of grb 060904a. thesecutoff spectra suddenly disappeared at the transition time from the prompt tailphase to the shallow decay one. after that, typical afterglow spectra with thephoton indices of 2.0 are continuously and preciously monitored by both xrt andsuzaku/xis up to 1 day since the burst trigger time. we could successfullytrace the temporal history of two characteristic break energies (peak energyand cutoff energy) and they show the time dependence of $\propto t^{-3} \simt^{-4}$ while the following afterglow spectra are quite stable. this factindicates that the emitting material of prompt tail is due to completelydifferent dynamics from the shallow decay component. therefore we conclude theemission sites of two distinct phenomena obviously differ from each other.

1010.2679	when a standard candle flickers	the crab nebula is the only hard x-ray source in the sky that is both brightenough and steady enough to be easily used as a standard candle. as a result,it has been used as a normalization standard by most x-ray/gamma raytelescopes. although small-scale variations in the nebula are well-known, sincethe start of science operations of the fermi gamma-ray burst monitor (gbm) inaugust 2008, a ~ 7% (70 mcrab) decline has been observed in the overall crabnebula flux in the 15 - 50 kev band, measured with the earth occultationtechnique. this decline is independently confirmed with three otherinstruments: the swift burst alert telescope (swift/bat), the rossi x-raytiming explorer proportional counter array (rxte/pca), and the internationalgamma-ray astrophysics laboratory imager on board integral (ibis). a similardecline is also observed in the ~3 - 15 kev data from the rxte/pca and integraljoint european monitor (jem-x) and in the 50 - 100 kev band with gbm andintegral/ibis. observations from 100 to 500 kev with gbm suggest that thedecline may be larger at higher energies. the pulsed flux measured withrxte/pca since 1999 is consistent with the pulsar spin-down, indicating thatthe observed changes are nebular. correlated variations in the crab nebula fluxon a ~3 year timescale are also seen independently with the pca, bat, and ibisfrom 2005 to 2008, with a flux minimum in april 2007. as of august 2010, thecurrent flux has declined below the 2007 minimum.

1101.1648	heterogeneity in short gamma-ray bursts	we analyze the swift/bat sample of short gamma-ray bursts, using an objectivebayesian block procedure to extract temporal descriptors of the bursts' initialpulse complexes (ipcs). the sample comprises 12 and 41 bursts with and withoutextended emission (ee) components, respectively. ipcs of non-ee bursts aredominated by single pulse structures, while ee bursts tend to have two or morepulse structures. the medians of characteristic timescales - durations, pulsestructure widths, and peak intervals - for ee bursts are factors of ~ 2-3longer than for non-ee bursts. a trend previously reported by hakkila andcolleagues unifying long and short bursts - the anti-correlation of pulseintensity and width - continues in the two short burst groups, with non-eebursts extending to more intense, narrower pulses. in addition we find thatpreceding and succeeding pulse intensities are anti-correlated with pulseinterval. we also examine the short burst x-ray afterglows as observed by theswift/xrt. the median flux of the initial xrt detections for ee bursts (~ 6 x10^-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1) is ~&gt; 20 x brighter than for non-ee bursts, and themedian x-ray afterglow duration for ee bursts (~ 60,000 s) is ~ 30 x longerthan for non-ee bursts.  the tendency for ee bursts toward longer prompt-emission timescales andhigher initial x-ray afterglow fluxes implies larger energy injections poweringthe afterglows. the longer-lasting x-ray afterglows of ee bursts may suggestthat a significant fraction explode into more dense environments than non-eebursts, or that the sometimes-dominant ee component efficiently powers theafterglow. combined, these results favor different progenitors for ee andnon-ee short bursts.

1206.0298	grb 120422a: a low-luminosity gamma-ray burst driven by central engine	grb 120422a is a low-luminosity gamma-ray burst (grb) associated with abright supernova, which distinguishes itself by its relatively short t90 ~ 5 sand an energetic x-ray tail. we analyze the swift bat and xrt data and discussthe physical implications. we show that the early steep decline in the x-raylight curve can be interpreted as the curvature tail of a late emission episodearound 58-86 s, with a curved instantaneous spectrum at the end of the emissionepisode. together with the main activity in the first ~ 20 s and the weakemission from 40 s to 60 s, the prompt emission is variable, which pointstowards a central engine origin, in contrast to the shock breakout origin asinvoked to interpret some other nearby low-luminosity supernova grbs. thecurvature effect interpretation and interpreting the early shallow decay as thecoasting external forward shock emission in a wind medium both give aconstraint on the bulk lorentz factor \gamma to be around several. comparingthe properties of grb 120422a and other supernova grbs, we found that the maincriterion to distinguish engine-driven grbs from the shock breakout grbs is thetime-averaged luminosity, with a separation line of about ~ 10^48 erg s^-1.

1207.1434	broadband spectral investigations of sgr j1550-5418 bursts	we present the results of our broadband spectral analysis of 42 sgrj1550-5418 bursts simultaneously detected with the swift/x-ray telescope (xrt)and the fermi/gamma-ray burst monitor (gbm), during the 2009 january activeepisode of the source. the unique spectral and temporal capabilities of the xrtwindowed timing mode have allowed us to extend the gbm spectral coverage forthese events down to the x-ray domain (0.5-10 kev). our earlier analysis of thegbm data found that the sgr j1550-5418 burst spectra were described equallywell with a comptonized model or with two blackbody functions; the two modelswere statistically indistinguishable. our new broadband (0.5 - 200 kev)spectral fits show that, on average, the burst spectra are better describedwith two blackbody functions than with the comptonized model. thus, our jointxrt/gbm analysis clearly shows for the first time that the sgr j1550-5418 burstspectra might naturally be expected to exhibit a more truly thermalizedcharacter, such as a two-blackbody or even a multi-blackbody signal. using theswift and rxte timing ephemeris for sgr j1550-5418 we construct thedistribution of the xrt burst counts with spin phase and find that it is notcorrelated with the persistent x-ray emission pulse phase from sgr j1550-5418.these results indicate that the burst emitting sites on the neutron star neednot be co-located with hot spots emitting the bulk of the persistent x-rayemission. finally, we show that there is a significant pulse phase dependenceof the xrt burst counts, likely demonstrating that the surface magnetic fieldof sgr j1550-5418 is not uniform over the emission zone, since it isanticipated that regions with stronger surface magnetic field could triggerbursts more efficiently.

1209.2342	seeking counterparts to advanced ligo/virgo transients with swift	binary neutron star (ns) mergers are among the most promising astrophysicalsources of gravitational wave emission for advanced ligo and advanced virgo,expected to be operational in 2015. finding electromagnetic counterparts tothese signals will be essential to placing them in an astronomical context. theswift satellite carries a sensitive x-ray telescope (xrt), and can respond totarget-of-opportunity requests within 1-2 hours, and so is uniquely poised tofind the x-ray counterparts to ligo/virgo triggers. assuming ns mergers are theprogenitors of short gamma-ray bursts (grbs), some percentage of ligo/virgotriggers will be accompanied by x-ray band afterglows that are brighter than10^-12 erg/s/cm^2 in the xrt band one day after the trigger time. we find thata soft x-ray transient of this flux is bright enough to be extremely rare, andso could be confidently associated with even a moderately localized gw signal.we examine two possible search strategies with the swift xrt to find brighttransients in ligo/virgo error boxes. in the first strategy, xrt could search avolume of space with a ~100 mpc radius by observing ~30 galaxies over thecourse of a day, with sufficient depth to observe the expected x-ray afterglow.for an extended ligo/virgo horizon distance, the xrt could employ 100 sexposures to cover an area of ~ 35 square degrees in about a day, remainsensitive enough to image gw discovered grb afterglows. these strategiesdemonstrate that discovery of x-ray band counterparts to gw triggers will bepossible.

1210.6221	flat-spectrum radio sources as likely counterparts of unidentified  integral sources (research note)	many sources in the fourth integral/ibis catalogue are still unidentified,since they lack an optical counterpart. an important tool that can help inidentifying/classifying these sources is the cross-correlation with radiocatalogues, which are very sensitive and positionally accurate. moreover, theradio properties of a source, such as the spectrum or morphology, could providefurther insight into its nature. flat-spectrum radio sources at high galacticlatitudes are likely to be agn, possibly associated to a blazar or to thecompact core of a radio galaxy. here we present a small sample of 6 sourcesextracted from the fourth integral/ibis catalogue that are stillunidentified/unclassified, but which are very likely associated with a bright,flat-spectrum radio object. to confirm the association and to study the sourcex-ray spectral parameters, we performed x-ray follow-up observations withswift/xrt. we report the results obtained from this search and discuss thenature of each source. 5 of the 6 radio associations are also detected inx-rays; in 3 cases they are the only counterpart found. igr j06073--0024 is aflat-spectrum radio quasar at z=1.08, igr j14488--4008 is a newly discoveredradio galaxy, while igr j18129--0649 is an agn of a still unknown type. thenature of igr j07225--3810 and igr j19386--4653 is less well defined, since inboth cases we find another x-ray source in the integral error circle;nevertheless, the flat-spectrum radio source, likely to be a radio loud agn,remains a viable and more convincing association in both cases. only for igrj11544--7618 could we not find any convincing counterpart since the radioassociation is not an x-ray emitter.

0712.3269	grb 060607a: a grb with bright asynchronous early $x$-ray and optical  emissions	the early optical emission of the moderately high redshift ($z=3.08$) grb060607a shows a remarkable broad and strong peak with a rapid rise and arelatively slow power-law decay. it is not coincident with the strongearly-time flares seen in the x-ray and gamma-ray energy bands. there is weakevidence for variability superposed on this dominant component in severaloptical bands that can be related to flares in high energy bands. while for asmall number of grbs, well-sampled optical flares have been observedsimultaneously with x-ray and gamma ray pulses, grb 060607a is one of the fewcases where the early optical emission shows no significant evidence forcorrelation with the prompt emission. in this work we first report in detailthe broad band observations of this burst by swift. then by applying a simplemodel for the dynamics and the synchrotron radiation of a relativistic shock,we show that the dominant component of the early emissions in opticalwavelengths has the same origin as the tail emission produced after the maingamma ray activity. the most plausible explanation for the peak in the opticallight curve seems to be the cooling of the prompt after the main collisions,shifting the characteristic synchrotron frequency to the optical bands. itseems that the cooling process requires a steepening of the electron energydistribution and/or a break in this distribution at high energies. the sharpbreak in the x-ray light curve at few thousands of seconds after the trigger,is not observed in the ir/optical/uv bands, and therefore can not be a jetbreak. either the x-ray break is due to a change in the spectrum of theaccelerated electrons or the lack of an optical break is due to the presence ofa related delayed response component (abbreviated).

1305.3236	evidence for new relations between gamma ray burst prompt and x-ray  afterglow emission from 9 years of swift	when a massive star explodes as a gamma ray burst information about thisexplosion is retained in the properties of the prompt and afterglow emission.we report on new relationships between the prompt and x-ray afterglow emissionof swift-detected gamma ray bursts found from bat and xrt data between 2004december and 2013 august (754 grbs). these relations suggest that the promptand afterglow emission are closely linked. in particular,we find very strongcorrelations between the bat 15-150kev $t_{90}$ and the break times before andafter the plateau phase in the x-ray 0.3-10kev afterglow light curves. we alsofind a strong anti-correlation between the photon index of the grb promptemission and the x-ray spectral slope of the afterglow. further,anti-correlations exist between the rest frame peak energy in the promptemission, e-peak,z, and the x-ray afterglow decay slope during the plateauphase and the break times after the plateau phase. the rest-frame break timesbefore and after the plateau phase are also anti-correlated with the rest-frame15-150kev luminosity and isotropic energy during the prompt emission. aprincipal component analysis suggests that grb properties are primarily drivenby the luminosity/energy release in the 15-150 kev band. luminosity functionsderived at various redshifts from logn-logs analysis, indicate that the densityof bright bursts is significantly lower in the local universe compared with theuniverseat z$\approx$3, where the density of bright grbs peaks. using clusteranalysis, we find that the duration of swift bat-detected short-duration grbsis less than 1s. we also present the catalogue of all \swift-onboard detectedbursts.

1308.3720	probing the gamma-ray burst rate with trigger simulations of the swift  burst alert telescope	the long gamma-ray burst (grb) rate is essential for revealing the connectionbetween grbs, supernovae and stellar evolution. additionally, the grb rate athigh redshift provides a strong probe of star formation history in the earlyuniverse. while hundreds of grbs are observed by swift, it remains difficult todetermine the intrinsic grb rate due to the complex trigger algorithm of swift.current studies usually approximate the swift trigger algorithm by a singledetection threshold. however, unlike the previously flown grb instruments,swift has over 500 trigger criteria based on photon count rate and additionalimage threshold for localization. to investigate possible systematic biases andexplore the intrinsic grb properties, we developed a program that is capable ofsimulating all the rate trigger criteria and mimicking the image triggerthreshold. we use this program to search for the intrinsic grb rate. oursimulations show that adopting the complex trigger algorithm of swift increasesthe detection rate of dim bursts. as a result, we find that either the grb rateis much higher than previously expected at large redshift, or the luminosityevolution is non-negligible. we will discuss the best results of the grb ratein our search, and their impact on the star-formation history.

1508.03608	galaxy strategy for ligo-virgo gravitational wave counterpart searches	in this work we continue a line of inquiry begun in kanner et al. whichdetailed a strategy for utilizing telescopes with narrow fields of view, suchas the swift x-ray telescope (xrt), to localize gravity wave (gw) triggers fromligo/virgo. if one considers the brightest galaxies that produce ~50% of thelight, then the number of galaxies inside typical gw error boxes will beseveral tens. we have found that this result applies both in the early years ofadvanced ligo when the range is small and the error boxes large, and in thelater years when the error boxes will be small and the range large. thisstrategy has the beneficial property of reducing the number of telescopepointings by a factor 10 to 100 compared with tiling the entire error box.additional galaxy count reduction will come from a gw rapid distance estimatewhich will restrict the radial slice in search volume. combining the brightgalaxy strategy with a convolution based on anticipated gw localizations, wefind that the searches can be restricted to about 18+/-5 galaxies for 2015,about 23+/-4 for 2017, and about 11+/-2 for 2020. this assumes a distancelocalization at or near the putative ns-ns merger range for each target year,and these totals are integrated out to the range. integrating out to thehorizon would roughly double the totals. for nearer localizations the totalswould decrease. the galaxy strategy we present in this work will enablenumerous sensitive optical and x-ray telescopes with small fields of view toparticipate meaningfully in searches wherein the prospects for rapidly fadingafterglow place a premium on a fast response time.

astro-ph;0207257	the october 1985 long outburst of u geminorum: revealing the viscous  time scale in long orbital period dwarf novae	we examine the aavso light curve of u geminorum from 1908 to 2002, withparticular focus on the october 1985 outburst. this outburst was longer thanany other seen in u gem by about a factor of 2, and appears to be unique amongall dwarf nova outbursts seen in systems with orbital periods longer than 3 hrin that one can measure the decay time scale during the initial slow decay.this rate is ~26+-6 d/mag. using estimates of the rate of accretion duringoutburst taken from froning et al., one can show that ~1e24 g of gas wasaccreted onto the white dwarf during the outburst. when coupled with theviscous time inferred from the (short orbital period) su uma stars, the u gemviscous time scale lends support to the standard model in which the decays indwarf novae can either be viscous or thermal, with the ratio between them beingroughly h/r where h is the vertical pressure scale height in the disk.

astro-ph;0211361	ozone depletion from nearby supernovae	estimates made in the 1970's indicated that a supernova occurring within tensof parsecs of earth could have significant effects on the ozone layer. sincethat time, improved tools for detailed modeling of atmospheric chemistry havebeen developed to calculate ozone depletion, and advances have been made intheoretical modeling of supernovae and of the resultant gamma-ray spectra. inaddition, one now has better knowledge of the occurrence rate of supernovae inthe galaxy, and of the spatial distribution of progenitors to core-collapsesupernovae. we report here the results of two-dimensional atmospheric modelcalculations that take as input the spectral energy distribution of asupernova, adopting various distances from earth and various latitude impactangles. in separate simulations we calculate the ozone depletion due to bothgamma-rays and cosmic rays. we find that for the combined ozone depletionroughly to double the ``biologically active'' uv flux received at the surfaceof the earth, the supernova must occur at &lt;8 pc. based on the latest data, thetime-averaged galactic rate of core-collapse supernovae occurring within 8 pcis ~1.5/gyr. in comparing our calculated ozone depletions with those ofprevious studies, we find them to be significantly less severe than found byruderman (1974), and consistent with whitten et al. (1976). in summary, giventhe amplitude of the effect, the rate of nearby supernovae, and the ~gyr timescale for multicellular organisms on earth, this particular pathway for massextinctions may be less important than previously thought.

astro-ph;0411284	terrestrial ozone depletion due to a milky way gamma-ray burst	based on cosmological rates, it is probable that at least once in the last gythe earth has been irradiated by a gamma-ray burst in our galaxy from within 2kpc. using a two-dimensional atmospheric model we have performed the firstcomputation of the effects upon the earth's atmosphere of one such impulsiveevent. a ten second burst delivering 100 kj/m^2 to the earth penetrates to thestratosphere and results in globally averaged ozone depletion of 35%, withdepletion reaching 55% at some latitudes. significant global depletion persistsfor over 5 years after the burst. this depletion would have dramaticimplications for life since a 50% decrease in ozone column density results inapproximately three times the normal uvb flux. widespread extinctions arelikely, based on extrapolation from uvb sensitivity of modern organisms.additional effects include a shot of nitrate fertilizer and no2 opacity in thevisible providing a cooling perturbation to the climate over a similartimescale. these results lend support to the hypothesis that a grb may haveinitiated the late ordovician mass extinction (melott et al. 2004).

astro-ph;0505472	gamma-ray bursts and the earth: exploration of atmospheric, biological,  climatic and biogeochemical effects	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are likely to have made a number of significantimpacts on the earth during the last billion years. we have used atwo-dimensional atmospheric model to investigate the effects on the earth'satmosphere of grbs delivering a range of fluences, at various latitudes, at theequinoxes and solstices, and at different times of day. we have estimated dnadamage levels caused by increased solar uvb radiation, reduction in solarvisible light due to $\mathrm{no_2}$ opacity, and deposition of nitratesthrough rainout of $\mathrm{hno_3}$. for the ``typical'' nearest burst in thelast billion years, we find globally averaged ozone depletion up to 38%.localized depletion reaches as much as 74%. significant global depletion (atleast 10%) persists up to about 7 years after the burst. our results dependstrongly on time of year and latitude over which the burst occurs. we find dnadamage of up to 16 times the normal annual global average, well above lethallevels for simple life forms such as phytoplankton. the greatest damage occursat low to mid latitudes. we find reductions in visible sunlight of a fewpercent, primarily in the polar regions. nitrate deposition similar to orslightly greater than that currently caused by lightning is also observed,lasting several years. we discuss how these results support the hypothesis thatthe late ordovician mass extinction may have been initiated by a grb.

astro-ph;0508321	physical processes shaping grb x-ray afterglow lightcurves: theoretical  implications from the swift xrt observations	(abridged) the swift x-ray telescope (xrt) reveals some interesting featuresof early x-ray afterglows, including a distinct rapidly decaying componentpreceding the conventional afterglow component in many sources, a shallow decaycomponent before the more ``normal'' decay component observed in a goodfraction of grbs (e.g. grb 050128, grb 050315, grb 050319, and grb 050401), andx-ray flares in nearly half of the afterglows (e.g. grb 050406, grb 050502b,grb 050607, and grb 050724). in this paper, we systematically analyze thepossible physical processes that shape the properties of the early x-rayafterglow lightcurves, and use the data to constrain various models. we suggestthat the steep decay component is consistent with the tail emission of theprompt gamma-ray bursts and/or of the x-ray flares. this provides clearevidence that the prompt emission and afterglow emission are two distinctcomponents, supporting the internal origin of the grb prompt emission. theshallow decay segment observed in a group of grbs suggests that the forwardshock keeps being refreshed for some time. this might be caused either by along-lived central engine, or by a power law distribution of the shell lorentzfactors, or else by the deceleration of a poynting flux dominated flow. x-rayflares suggest that the grb central engine is still active after the promptgamma-ray emission is over, but with a reduced activity at later times. in somecases, the central engine activity even extends days after the burst trigger.analyses of early x-ray afterglow data reveal that grbs are indeed highlyrelativistic events. early afterglow data of many bursts, starting from thebeginning of the xrt observations, are consistent with the afterglow emissionfrom an interstellar medium (ism) environment.

astro-ph;0603658	the swift x-ray flaring afterglow of grb 050607	the unique capability of the swift satellite to perform a prompt andautonomous slew to a newly detected gamma-ray burst (grb) has yielded thediscovery of interesting new properties of grb x-ray afterglows, such as thesteep early lightcurve decay and the frequent presence of flares detected up toa few hours after the grb trigger. we present observations of grb 050607, thefourth case of a grb discovered by swift with flares superimposed on theoverall fading x-ray afterglow. the flares of grb 050607 were not symmetric asin previously reported cases, showing a very steep rise and a shallower decay,similar to the fast rise, exponential decay that are frequently observed in thegamma-ray prompt emission. the brighter flare had a flux increase by a factorof approximately 25,peaking for 30 seconds at a count rate of approximately 30counts s-1, and it presented hints of addition short time scale activity duringthe decay phase. there is evidence of spectral evolution during the flares. inparticular, at the onset of the flares the observed emission was harder, with agradual softening as each flare decayed. the very short time scale and thespectral variability during the flaring activity are indicators of possibleextended periods of energy emission by the grb central engine. the flares werefollowed by a phase of shallow decay, during which the forward shock was beingrefreshed by a long-lived central engine or by shells of lower lorentz factors,and by a steepening after approximately 12 ks to a decay slope consideredtypical of x-ray afterglows.

astro-ph;0610177	grb radiative efficiencies derived from the swift data: grbs vs. xrfs,  long vs. short	we systematically analyze the prompt emission and the early afterglow data ofa sample of 31 grbs detected by {\em swift} before september 2005, and estimatethe grb radiative efficiency. bat's narrow band inhibits a precisedetermination of the grb spectral parameters, and we have developed a method toestimate these parameters with the hardness ratio information. the shallowdecay component commonly existing in early x-ray afterglows, if interpreted ascontinuous energy injection in the external shock, suggests that the grbefficiency previously derived from the late-time x-ray data were not reliable.we calculate two radiative efficiencies using the afterglow kinetic energy e_kderived at the putative deceleration time t_{dec}) and at the break time (t_b)when the energy injection phase ends, respectively. at t_b xrfs appear to beless efficient than normal grbs. however, when we analyze the data at t_{dec}xrfs are found to be as efficient as grbs. short grbs have similar radiativeefficiencies to long grbs despite of their different progenitors. twenty-twobursts in the sample are identified to have the afterglow cooling frequencybelow the x-ray band. assuming \epsilon_e = 0.1, we find \eta_\gamma(t_b)usually &lt;10% and \eta_\gamma (t_{dec}) varying from a few percents to &gt; 90%.nine grbs in the sample have the afterglow cooling frequency above the x-rayband for a very long time. this suggests a very small \epsilon_b and/or a verylow ambient density n.

astro-ph;9812154	the progenitor of the new comptel/rosat supernova remnant in vela	we show that (1) the newly discovered supernova remnant (snr), groj0852--4642/rx j0852.0--4622, was created by a core-collapse supernova of amassive star, and (2) the same supernova event which produced the $^{44}$tidetected by comptel from this source is probably also responsible for a largefraction of the observed $^{26}$al emission in the vela region detected by thesame instrument. the first conclusion is based on the fact that the remnant iscurrently expanding too slowly given its young age for it to be caused by atype ia supernova. if the current snr shell expansion speed is greater than3000 km/s, a $15 m_\odot$ type ii supernova with a moderate kinetic energyexploding at about 150 pc away is favored. if the snr expansion speed is lowerthan 2000 km s$^{-1}$, as derived naively from the x-ray data, a much moreenergetic supernova is required to have occurred at $\sim250$ pc away in adense environment at the edge of the gum nebula. this progenitor has apreferred ejecta mass of $\le10 m_\odot$ and therefore, it is probably a typeib or type ic supernova. however, the required high ambient density of $n_h \ge100 cm^{-3}$ in this scenario is difficult to reconcile with the regional codata. a combination of our estimates of the age/energetics of the new snr andthe almost perfect positional coincidence of the new snr with the centroid ofthe comptel $ ^{26}$al emission feature of the vela region strongly favors acausal connection. if confirmed, this will be the first case where both$^{44}$ti and $^{26}$al are detected from the same young snr and together theycan be used to select preferred theoretical core-collapse supernova models.
