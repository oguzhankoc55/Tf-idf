0707.0393	supernovae in the subaru deep field: an initial sample, and type ia  rate, out to redshift 1.6	large samples of high-redshift supernovae (sne) are potentially powerfulprobes of cosmic star formation, metal enrichment, and sn physics. we presentinitial results from a new deep sn survey, based on re-imaging in the r, i', z'bands, of the 0.25 deg2 subaru deep field (sdf), with the 8.2-m subarutelescope and suprime-cam. in a single new epoch consisting of two nights ofobservations, we have discovered 33 candidate sne, down to a z'-band magnitudeof 26.3 (ab). we have measured the photometric redshifts of the sn hostgalaxies, obtained keck spectroscopic redshifts for 17 of the host galaxies,and classified the sne using the bayesian photometric algorithm of poznanski etal. (2007) that relies on template matching. after correcting for biases in theclassification, 55% of our sample consists of type ia supernovae and 45% ofcore-collapse sne. the redshift distribution of the sne ia reaches z ~ 1.6,with a median of z ~ 1.2. the core-collapse sne reach z ~ 1.0, with a median ofz ~ 0.5. our sn sample is comparable to the hubble space telescope/goods sampleboth in size and redshift range. the redshift distributions of the sne in thesdf and in goods are consistent, but there is a trend (which requiresconfirmation using a larger sample) for more high-z sne ia in the sdf. thistrend is also apparent when comparing the sn ia rates we derive to those basedon goods data. our results suggest a fairly constant rate at high redshift thatcould be tracking the star-formation rate. additional epochs on this field,already being obtained, will enlarge our sn sample to the hundreds, anddetermine whether or not there is a decline in the sn ia rate at z &gt;~ 1.

0909.1906	variability and spectral energy distributions of low-luminosity active  galactic nuclei: a simultaneous x-ray/uv look with swift	we have observed four low-luminosity active galactic nuclei classified astype 1 liners with the x-ray telescope (xrt) and the ultraviolet-opticaltelescope (uvot) onboard swift, in an attempt to clarify the main poweringmechanism of this class of nearby sources. among our targets, we detect x-rayvariability in ngc 3998 for the first time. the light curves of this objectreveal variations of up to 30% amplitude in half a day, with no significantspectral variability on this time scale. we also observe a decrease of ~30%over 9 days, with significant spectral softening. moreover, the x-ray flux is~40% lower than observed in previous years. variability is detected in m 81 aswell, at levels comparable to those reported previously: a flux increase in thehard x-rays (1-10 kev) of 30% in ~3 hours and variations by up to a factor of 2within a few years. this x-ray behaviour is similar to that ofhigher-luminosity, seyfert-type, objects. using previoushigh-angular-resolution imaging data from the hubble space telescope (hst), weevaluate the diffuse uv emission due to the host galaxy and isolate the nuclearflux in our uvot observations. all sources are detected in the uv band, atlevels similar to those of the previous observations with hst. the xrt (0.2-10kev) spectra are well described by single power-laws and the uv-to-x-ray fluxratios are again consistent with those of seyferts and radio-loud agns ofhigher luminosity. the similarity in x-ray variability and broad-band energydistributions suggests the presence of similar accretion and radiationprocesses in low- and high-luminosity agns.

0707.4598	on the fraction of intermediate-mass close binaries that explode as  type-ia supernovae	type-ia supernovae (sne-ia) are thought to result from a thermonuclearrunaway in white dwarfs (wds) that approach the chandrasekhar limit, eitherthrough accretion from a companion or a merger with another wd. i compileobservational estimates of the fraction eta of intermediate-mass stars thateventually explode as sne-ia, supplement them with several new estimates, andcompare them self-consistently. the estimates are based on five differentmethods, each utilising some observable related to the sn-ia rate, combinedwith assumptions regarding the imf: the ratio of sn-ia to core-collapse ratesin star-forming galaxies; the sn-ia rate per unit star-formation rate; thesn-ia rate per unit stellar mass; the iron to stellar mass ratio in galaxyclusters; and the abundance ratios in galaxy clusters. the five methodsindicate that a fraction in the range eta~2-40% of all stars with initialmasses of 3-8 m_sun (the generally assumed sn-ia progenitors) explode assne-ia. a fraction of eta~15% is consistent with all five methods for a rangeof plausible imfs. considering also the binarity fraction among such stars, themass ratio distribution, the separation distribution, and duplicity (everybinary can produce only one sn-ia explosion), this implies that nearly everyintermediate mass close binary ends up as a sn-ia, or possibly more sne-ia thanprogenitor systems. theoretically expected fractions are generally one to twoorders of magnitude lower. the problem could be solved: if all theobservational estimates are in error; or with a ``middle-heavy'' imf; or bysome mechanism that strongly enhances the efficiency of binary evolution towardsn-ia explosion; or by a non-binary origin for sne-ia.

1003.3030	on the size distribution of supernova remnants in the magellanic clouds	the physical sizes of supernova remnants (snrs) in a number of nearbygalaxies follow an approximately linear cumulative distribution, contrary towhat is expected for decelerating shock fronts. this has been attributed toselection effects, or to a majority of snrs propagating in "free expansion", atconstant velocity, into a tenuous ambient medium. we compile a list of 77 knownsnrs in the magellanic clouds (mcs), and argue that they are a fairly completerecord of the sne that have exploded over the last ~20kyr, with most now in theadiabatic, sedov phase of their expansions. the roughly linear cumulative sizedistribution (uniform in a differential distribution) can result from thecombination of a deceleration during this phase, a transition to aradiation-loss-dominated phase at a radius that depends on the local gasdensity, and a distribution of ambient densities varying roughly as rho^{-1}.this explanation is supported by the observed -1 power-law distributions ofthree independent tracers of density: hi column density, halpha surfacebrightness, and star formation rate from resolved stellar populations. in thispicture, the observed cutoff at r~30 pc in the snr size distribution is due toa minimum in the mean ambient gas density in the regions where supernovae (sne)explode. we show that m33 has a snr size distribution similar to that of themcs, suggesting these features, and their explanation, may be universal. in acompanion paper (maoz &amp; badenes 2010), we use our sample of snrs as aneffective "sn survey" to calculate the sn rate and delay time distribution inthe mcs. the hypothesis that most snrs are in free expansion, rather than inthe sedov phase of their evolution, would result in sn rates that are in strongconflict with independent measurements, and with basic stellar evolutiontheory.

1004.2048	the lensing efficiencies of macs x-ray selected versus rcs optically  selected galaxy clusters	the statistics of strongly lensed arcs in samples of galaxy clusters provideinformation on cluster structure that is complementary to that from individualclusters. however, samples of clusters that have been analyzed to date havebeen either small, heterogeneous, or observed with limited angular resolution.we measure the lensed-arc statistics of 97 clusters imaged at high angularresolution with the hubble space telescope, identifying lensed arcs using twoautomated arc detection algorithms. the sample includes similar numbers ofx-ray selected (macs) and optically selected (rcs) clusters, and spans clusterredshifts in the range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1. we compile a catalogue of 42 arcs in thex-ray selected subsample and 7 arcs in the optical subsample. all but five ofthese arcs are reported here for the first time. at 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 0.7, the x-rayselected clusters have a significantly higher mean frequency of arcs, 1.2+/-0.2per cluster, versus 0.2+/-0.1 in the optical sample. the strikingly differentlensing efficiencies indicate that x-ray clusters trace much larger massconcentrations, despite the similar optical luminosities of the x-ray andoptical clusters. the mass difference is supported also by the lower spacedensity of the x-ray clusters, and by the small einstein radii of the few arcsin the optical sample. higher-order effects, such as differences inconcentration or substructure, may also contribute.

1006.3757	the type ia supernova rate in redshift 0.5--0.9 galaxy clusters	supernova (sn) rates are potentially powerful diagnostics of metal enrichmentand sn physics, particularly in galaxy clusters with their deep,metal-retaining potentials and relatively simple star-formation histories. wehave carried out a survey for supernovae (sne) in galaxy clusters, at aredshift range 0.5&lt;z&lt;0.9, using the advanced camera for surveys (acs) on thehubble space telescope. we reimaged a sample of 15 clusters that werepreviously imaged by acs, thus obtaining two to three epochs per cluster, inwhich we discovered five likely cluster sne, six possible cluster sne ia, twohostless sn candidates, and several background and foreground events. keckspectra of the host galaxies were obtained to establish cluster membership. weconducted detailed efficiency simulations, and measured the stellarluminosities of the clusters using subaru images. we derive a cluster sn rateof 0.35 snub +0.17/-0.12 (statistical) \pm0.13 (classification) \pm0.01(systematic) [where snub = sne (100 yr 10^10 l_b_sun)^-1] and 0.112 snum+0.055/-0.039 (statistical) \pm0.042 (classification) \pm0.005 (systematic)[where snum = sne (100 yr 10^10 m_sun)^-1]. as in previous measurements ofcluster sn rates, the uncertainties are dominated by small-number statistics.the sn rate in this redshift bin is consistent with the sn rate in clusters atlower redshifts (to within the uncertainties), and shows that there is, atmost, only a slight increase of cluster sn rate with increasing redshift. thelow and fairly constant sn ia rate out to z~1 implies that the bulk of the ironmass in clusters was already in place by z~1. the recently observed doubling ofiron abundances in the intracluster medium between z=1 and 0, if real, islikely the result of redistribution of existing iron, rather than newproduction of iron.

1011.1014	type-ia supernovae: new clues to their progenitors from the delay-time  distribution	despite their prominent role in cosmography, little is yet known about thenature of type-ia supernovae (sne ia), from the identity of their progenitorsystems, through the evolution of those systems up to ignition and explosion,and to the causes of the environmental dependences of their observedproperties. i briefly review some of those puzzles. i then focus on recentprogress in reconstructing the sn ia delay time distribution (dtd) -- the snrate versus time that would follow a hypothetical brief burst of starformation. a number of measurements of the dtd over the past two years, usingdifferent methods and based on sne ia in different environments and redshiftranges, are converging. at delays 1&lt;t&lt;10 gyr, these measurements show a similar1/t power-law shape, with similar normalizations. the dtd peaks at the shortestdelays probed, but there is still some uncertainty regarding its precise shapein the range 0.1&lt;t&lt;1 gyr. at face value, this result supports ron webbink's(1984) idea of a double-degenerate progenitor origin for sne ia, but thenumbers currently predicted by binary population synthesis models must beincreased by factors of 3-10, at least. single-degenerate progenitors may stillplay a role in producing short-delay sne ia, or perhaps all sne ia, if there issomething important missing in the current modeling efforts.

1101.4653	lensed arc statistics: comparison of millennium-simulation galaxy  clusters to hubble space telescope observations of an x-ray selected sample	it has been debated for a decade whether there is a large overabundance ofstrongly lensed arcs in galaxy clusters, compared to expectations fromlambdacdm cosmology. we perform ray tracing through the most massive halos ofthe millennium simulation at several redshifts in their evolution, using thehubble ultra deep field as a source image, to produce realistic simulatedlensed images. we compare the lensed arc statistics measured from thesimulations to those of a sample of 45 x-ray selected clusters, observed withthe hubble space telescope, that we have analysed in horesh et al. (2010). theobservations and the simulations are matched in cluster masses, redshifts,observational effects, and the algorithmic arc detection and selection. atz=0.6 there are too few massive-enough clusters in the millennium volume for aproper statistical comparison with the observations. at redshifts 0.3&lt;z&lt;0.5,however, we have large numbers of simulated and observed clusters, and thelatter are an unbiased selection from a complete sample. for these redshifts,we find excellent agreement between the observed and simulated arc statistics,in terms of the mean number of arcs per cluster, the distribution of number ofarcs per cluster, and the angular separation distribution. at z ~ 0.2 someconflict remains, with real clusters being ~3 times more efficient arcproducers than their simulated counterparts. this may arise due to selectionbiases in the observed subsample at this redshift, to some mismatch in massesbetween the observed and simulated clusters, or to physical effects that ariseat low redshift and enhance the lensing efficiency, but which are notrepresented by the simulations.

1107.5809	second-generation microlensing planet surveys: a realistic simulation	microlensing surveys, which have discovered about a dozen extrasolar planetsto date, have focused on the small minority of high-magnification lensingevents, which have a high sensitivity to planet detection. in contrast,second-generation experiments, of the type that has recently begun, monitorcontinuously also the majority of low-magnification events. we carry out arealistic numerical simulation of such experiments. we simulate scaled,solar-like, eight-planet systems, studying a variety of physical parameters(planet frequency, scaling of the snowline with stellar mass r_snow ~ m^s), andfolding in the various observational parameters (cadence, experiment duration),with sampling sequences and photometric error distributions taken from the realongoing experiment. we quantify the dependence of detected planet yield oncadence and experiment duration, e.g., the yield is doubled when going from3-hour to 15-minute baseline cadences, or from an 80-day-long to a 150-day-longexperiment. there is a degeneracy between the snowline scaling index s and theabundance of planetary systems that can be inferred from the experiment, in thecontext of our scaled solar-analog model. after 4 years, the ongoingsecond-generation experiment will discover of the order of 50 planets, and thuswill be able to determine the frequency of snowline planet occurrence to aprecision of 10-30%, assuming the fraction of stars hosting such planets isbetween 1/3 and 1/10, and a snowline index in the range s=0.5 to 2. if mostplanetary systems are solar analogs, over 65% of the detected planets will be"jupiters", five in six of the detected anomalies will be due to a singleplanet, and one in six will reveal two planets in a single lensing event.

1109.6653	the color variability of quasars	we quantify quasar color-variability using an unprecedented variabilitydatabase - ugriz photometry of 9093 quasars from sdss stripe 82, observed over8 years at ~60 epochs each. we confirm previous reports that quasars becomebluer when brightening. we find a redshift dependence of this blueing in agiven set of bands (e.g. g and r), but show that it is the result of the fluxcontribution from less-variable or delayed emission lines in the different sdssbands at different redshifts. after correcting for this effect, quasarcolor-variability is remarkably uniform, and independent not only of redshift,but also of quasar luminosity and black hole mass. the color variations ofindividual quasars, as they vary in brightness on year timescales, are muchmore pronounced than the ranges in color seen in samples of quasars across manyorders of magnitude in luminosity. this indicates distinct physical mechanismsbehind quasar variability and the observed range of quasar luminosities at agiven black hole mass - quasar variations cannot be explained by changes in themean accretion rate. we do find some dependence of the color variability on thecharacteristics of the flux variations themselves, with fast, low-amplitude,brightness variations producing more color variability. the observed behaviorcould arise if quasar variability results from flares or ephemeral hot spots inan accretion disc.

1110.5809	evidence for type ia supernova diversity from ultraviolet observations  with the hubble space telescope	we present ultraviolet (uv) spectroscopy and photometry of four type iasupernovae (sne 2004dt, 2004ef, 2005m, and 2005cf) obtained with the uv prismof the advanced camera for surveys on the hubble space telescope. this datasetprovides unique spectral time series down to 2000 angstrom. significantdiversity is seen in the near maximum-light spectra (~ 2000--3500 angstrom) forthis small sample. the corresponding photometric data, together with archivaldata from swift ultraviolet/optical telescope observations, provide furtherevidence of increased dispersion in the uv emission with respect to theoptical. the peak luminosities measured in uvw1/f250w are found to correlatewith the b-band light-curve shape parameter dm15(b), but with much largerscatter relative to the correlation in the broad-band b band (e.g., ~0.4 magversus ~0.2 mag for those with 0.8 &lt; dm15 &lt; 1.7 mag). sn 2004dt is found as anoutlier of this correlation (at &gt; 3 sigma), being brighter than normal sne iasuch as sn 2005cf by ~0.9 mag and ~2.0 mag in the uvw1/f250w and uvm2/f220wfilters, respectively. we show that different progenitor metallicity orline-expansion velocities alone cannot explain such a large discrepancy.viewing-angle effects, such as due to an asymmetric explosion, may have asignificant influence on the flux emitted in the uv region. detailed modelingis needed to disentangle and quantify the above effects.

1111.4492	type-ia supernova rates and the progenitor problem, a review	the identity of the progenitor systems of type-ia supernovae (sne ia) is amajor unsolved problem in astrophysics. sn ia rates are providing some strikingclues. we review the basics of sn rate measurement, preach about some sins ofsn rate measurement and analysis, and illustrate one of these sins with ananalogy about martian scientists. we review the recent progress in measuring snia rates in various environments and redshifts, and their use to reconstructthe sn ia delay time distribution (dtd) -- the sn rate versus time that wouldfollow a hypothetical brief burst of star formation. a good number of dtdmeasurements, using a variety of methods, appear to be converging. at delays1&lt;t&lt;10 gyr, these measurements show a similar, ~t^-1, power-law shape. the dtdpeaks at the shortest delays probed, although there is still some uncertaintyregarding its precise shape at t&lt;1 gyr. at face value, this result supports theidea of a double-degenerate progenitor origin for sne ia. single-degenerateprogenitors may still play a role in producing short-delay sne ia, or perhapsall sne ia, if the red-giant donor channel is more efficient than found by mosttheoretical models. apart from the dtd shape, the dtd normalization enjoysfairly good agreement (though perhaps some tension), among the variousmeasurements, with a hubble-time-integrated dtd value of about 2+/- 1 sne iaper 1000 msun (stellar mass formed with a low-mass-turnover imf). a recentattempt to characterize the local white dwarf binary population suggests thatthe white dwarf merger rate can explain the galactic sn ia rate, if sub-chandramergers lead to sn ia events. we conclude by pointing to some future directionsthat should lead to progress in the field, including measurement of thebivariate (delay and stretch) sn ia response function .

1201.1616	clash: precise new constraints on the mass profile of abell 2261	we precisely constrain the inner mass profile of abell 2261 (z=0.225) for thefirst time and determine this cluster is not "over-concentrated" as foundpreviously, implying a formation time in agreement with {\lambda}cdmexpectations. these results are based on strong lensing analyses of new 16-bandhst imaging obtained as part of the cluster lensing and supernova survey withhubble (clash). combining this with revised weak lensing analyses of subaruwide field imaging with 5-band subaru + kpno photometry, we place tight newconstraints on the halo virial mass m_vir = 2.2\pm0.2\times10^15 m\odot/h70(within r \approx 3 mpc/h70) and concentration c = 6.2 \pm 0.3 when assuming aspherical halo. this agrees broadly with average c(m,z) predictions from recent{\lambda}cdm simulations which span 5 &lt;~ &lt;c&gt; &lt;~ 8. our most significantsystematic uncertainty is halo elongation along the line of sight. to estimatethis, we also derive a mass profile based on archival chandra x-rayobservations and find it to be ~35% lower than our lensing-derived profile atr2500 ~ 600 kpc. agreement can be achieved by a halo elongated with a ~2:1 axisratio along our line of sight. for this elongated halo model, we find m_vir =1.7\pm0.2\times10^15 m\odot/h70 and c_vir = 4.6\pm0.2, placing rough lowerlimits on these values. the need for halo elongation can be partially obviatedby non-thermal pressure support and, perhaps entirely, by systematic errors inthe x-ray mass measurements. we estimate the effect of background structuresbased on mmt/hectospec spectroscopic redshifts and find these tend to lowermvir further by ~7% and increase cvir by ~5%.

1202.5467	characterizing the galactic white dwarf binary population with sparsely  sampled radial velocity data	we present a method to characterize statistically the parameters of adetached binary sample - binary fraction, separation distribution, and massratio distribution - using noisy radial-velocity data with as few as two,randomly spaced, epochs per object. to do this, we analyze the distribution ofdrvmax, the maximum radial-velocity difference between any two epochs for thesame object. at low values, the core of this distribution is dominated bymeasurement errors, but for large enough samples there is a high-velocity tailthat can effectively constrain the parameters of the binary population. wediscuss our approach for the case of a population of detached white-dwarf (wd)binaries with separations that are decaying via gravitational wave emission. wederive analytic expressions for the present-day distribution of separations,integrated over the star-formation history of the galaxy, for parametrizedinitial wd separation distributions at the end of the common-envelope phase. weuse monte carlo techniques to produce grids of simulated drvmax distributionswith specific binary population parameters, and the same sampling cadences andradial velocity errors as the observations, and we compare them to the realdrvmax distribution to constrain the properties of the binary population. weillustrate the sensitivity of the method to both the model and theobservational parameters. in the particular case of binary white dwarfs, everymodel population predicts a merger rate per star which can easily be comparedto type-ia supernova rates. in a companion paper, we apply the method to asample of about 4000 wds from the sloan digital sky survey, and we find amerger rate remarkably similar to the rate of type-ia supernovae inmilky-way-like galaxies.

1202.5472	the merger rate of binary white dwarfs in the galactic disk	we use multi-epoch spectroscopy of about 4000 white dwarfs in the sloandigital sky survey to constrain the properties of the galactic population ofbinary white dwarf systems and calculate their merger rate. with a monte carlocode, we model the distribution of drvmax, the maximum radial velocity shiftbetween exposures of the same star, as a function of the binary fraction within0.05 au, fbin, and the power-law index in the separation distribution at theend of the common envelope phase, alpha. although there is some degeneracybetween fbin and alpha, the the fifteen high drvmax systems that we findconstrain the combination of these parameters, which determines a white dwarfmerger rate per unit stellar mass of 1.4(+3.4,-1.0)e-13 /yr/msun (1-sigmalimits). this is remarkably similar to the measured rate of type ia supernovaeper unit stellar mass in milky-way-like sbc galaxies. the rate ofsuper-chandrasekhar mergers is only 1.0(+1.6,-0.6)e-14 /yr/msun. we concludethat there are not enough close binary white dwarf systems to reproduce theobserved type ia sn rate in the 'classic' double degenerate super-chandrasekharscenario. on the other hand, if sub-chandrasekhar mergers can lead to type iasne, as recently suggested by some studies, they could make a majorcontribution to the overall type ia sn rate. although unlikely, we cannot ruleout contamination of our sample by m-dwarf binaries or non-gaussian errors.these issues will be clarified in the near future by completing the follow-upof all 15 high drvmax systems.

1206.0465	the delay-time distribution of type-ia supernovae from sloan ii	we derive the delay-time distribution (dtd) of type-ia supernovae (sne ia)using a sample of 132 sne ia, discovered by the sloan digital sky survey ii(sdss2) among 66,000 galaxies with spectral-based star-formation histories(sfhs). to recover the best-fit dtd, the sfh of every individual galaxy iscompared, using poisson statistics, to the number of sne that it hosted (zeroor one), based on the method introduced in maoz et al. (2011). this sn samplediffers from the sdss2 sn ia sample analyzed by brandt et al. (2010), using arelated, but different, dtd recovery method. furthermore, we use asimulation-based sn detection-efficiency function, and we apply a number ofimportant corrections to the galaxy sfhs and sn ia visibility times. the dtdthat we find has 4-sigma detections in all three of its time bins: prompt (t &lt;420 myr), intermediate (0.4 &lt; t &lt; 2.4 gyr), and delayed (t &gt; 2.4 gyr),indicating a continuous dtd, and it is among the most accurate and preciseamong recent dtd reconstructions. the best-fit power-law form to the recovereddtd is t^(-1.12+/-0.08), consistent with generic ~t^-1 predictions of sn iaprogenitor models based on the gravitational-wave induced mergers of binarywhite dwarfs. the time integrated number of sne ia per formed stellar mass isn_sn/m = 0.00130 +/- 0.00015 msun^-1, or about 4% of the stars formed withinitial masses in the 3-8 msun range. this is lower than, but largelyconsistent with, several recent dtd estimates based on sn rates in galaxyclusters and in local-volume galaxies, and is higher than, but consistent withn_sn/m estimated by comparing volumetric sn ia rates to cosmic sfh.

(2010, 2011) showing that theproperties of this high-redshift sn ia host galaxy is similar to other fieldgalaxies.  conclusions: spectroscopic confirmation of additional sdf sn hosts would berequired to confirm the cosmic sn rate evolution measured in the sdf.

1301.4994	detecting bio-markers in habitable-zone earths transiting white dwarfs	the characterization of the atmospheres of habitable-zone earth-massexoplanets that transit across main-sequence stars, let alone the detection ofbio-markers in their atmospheres, will be challenging even with futurefacilities. it has been noted that white dwarfs (wds) have long-lived habitablezones and that a large fraction of wds may host planets. we point out thatduring a transit of an earth-mass planet across a wd, the planet's atmospherictransmission spectrum obtains a much higher contrast over the stellarbackground compared to a main-sequence host, because of the small surface areaof the wd. the most prominent bio-marker in the present-day terrestrialatmosphere, molecular oxygen, is readily detectable in a wd transit via itsa-band absorption at ~0.76 micron. a potentially life-sustaining earth-likeplanet transiting a wd can be found by assembling a suitable sample of ~500 wdsand then surveying them for transits using small telescopes. if and when such atransiting case is found, the o_2 absorption in the planetary atmospherictransmission spectrum would be detectable with the james webb space telescope(jwst) in about 5 hours of total exposure time, integrated over 160 2-minutetransits. characterization of the planet atmosphere using other tracers such aswater vapour and co_2 will be considerably easier. we demonstrate this futurediscovery space by simulating a possible transmission spectrum that would beobtained with jwst.

1308.1675	the contribution of halos with different mass ratios to the overall  growth of cluster-sized halos	we provide a new observational test for a key prediction of the \lambda cdmcosmological model: the contributions of mergers with differenthalo-to-main-cluster mass ratios to cluster-sized halo growth. we perform thistest by dynamically analyzing seven galaxy clusters, spanning the redshiftrange $0.13 &lt; z_c &lt; 0.45$ and caustic mass range $0.4-1.5$ $10^{15}h_{0.73}^{-1}$ m$_{\odot}$, with an average of 293 spectroscopically-confirmedbound galaxies to each cluster. the large radial coverage (a few virial radii),which covers the whole infall region, with a high number of spectroscopicallyidentified galaxies enables this new study. for each cluster, we identify boundgalaxies. out of these galaxies, we identify infalling and accreted halos andestimate their masses and their dynamical states. using the estimated masses,we derive the contribution of different mass ratios to cluster-sized halogrowth. for mass ratios between ~0.2 and ~0.7, we find a ~1 $\sigma$ agreementwith \lambda cdm expectations based on the millennium simulations i and ii. atlow mass ratios, $\lesssim 0.2$, our derived contribution is underestimatedsince the detection efficiency decreases at low masses, $\sim 2 \times 10^{14}$$h_{0.73}^{-1}$ m$_{\odot}$. at large mass ratios, $\gtrsim 0.7$, we do notdetect halos probably because our sample, which was chosen to be quite x-rayrelaxed, is biased against large mass ratios. therefore, at large mass ratios,the derived contribution is also underestimated.

0801.2898	a search for the progenitors of two type-ia supernovae in ngc 1316	recent evidence of a young progenitor population for many type-ia sne(sne-ia) raises the possibility that evolved intermediate-mass progenitor starsmay be detected in pre-explosion images. ngc 1316, a radio galaxy in the fornaxcluster, is a prolific producer of sne-ia, with four detected since 1980. weanalyze hubble space telescope (hst) pre-explosion images of the sites of twoof the sne-ia that exploded in this galaxy, sn2006dd (a normal type-ia) andsn2006mr (likely a subluminous, 1991bg-like, sn-ia). astrometric positions areobtained from optical and near-ir ground-based images of the events. we find nocandidate point sources at either location, and set upper limits on the flux inb, v, and i from any such progenitors. we also estimate the amount ofextinction that could be present, based on analysis of the surface-brightnessinhomogeneities in the hst images themselves. at the distance of ngc 1316, thelimits correspond to absolute magnitudes of about -5.5, -5.4, and -6.0 mag inm_b, m_v, and m_i, respectively. comparison to stellar evolution models arguesagainst the presence at the sn sites, 3 years prior to the explosion, of normalstars with initial masses &gt; 6 m_sun at the tip of their asymptotic-giant branch(agb) evolution, young post-agb stars that had initial masses &gt; 4 m_sun, andpost-red-giant stars of initial masses &gt; 9 m_sun.

1309.0009	habitable planets around white dwarfs: an alternate mission for the  kepler spacecraft	a large fraction of white dwarfs (wds) may host planets in their habitablezones. these planets may provide our best chance to detect bio-markers on atransiting exoplanet, thanks to the diminished contrast ratio between theearth-sized wd and its earth-sized planets. the jwst is capable of obtainingthe first spectroscopic measurements of such planets, yet there are no knownplanets around wds. here we propose to take advantage of the unique capabilityof the kepler spacecraft in the 2-wheels mode to perform a transit survey thatis capable of identifying the first planets in the habitable zone of a wd. wepropose to obtain kepler time-series photometry of 10,000 wds in the sdssimaging area to search for planets in the habitable zone. thanks to the largefield of view of kepler, for the first time in history, a large number of wdscan be observed at the same time, which is essential for discovering transits.our proposed survey requires a total of 200 days of observing time, and willfind up to 100 planets in the wd habitable zone. this survey will maintainkepler's spirit of searching for habitable earths, but near new hosts. withfew-day observations and minute-cadences per field, it will also open up acompletely unexplored discovery space. in addition to planets, this survey issensitive to pulsating wds, as well as eclipsing short period stellar andsubstellar companions. these have important implications for constraining thedouble wd merger rate and their contribution to type ia supernovae and thegravitational wave foreground. given the relatively low number density of ourtargets, this program can be combined with other projects that would benefitfrom high cadence and many-fields observations with kepler, e.g. a transitsurvey of a magnitude-limited, complete sample of nearby m dwarfs orasteroseismology of variable stars (e.g. rr lyrae) in the same fields.

1310.2419	fast radio bursts may originate from nearby flaring stars	six cases of fast radio bursts (frbs) have recently been discovered. the frbsare bright (~0.1 - 1 jy) and brief (~ 1 ms) pulses of radio emission withdispersion measures (dms) that exceed galactic values, and hence frbs have beeninterpreted to be at cosmological distances. we propose, instead, that frbs arerare eruptions of flaring main-sequence stars within ~1 kpc. rather thanassociating their excess dm with the intergalactic medium, we relate it to ablanket of coronal plasma around their host stars. we have monitored at opticalbands the stars within the radio beams of three of the known frbs. in onefield, we find a bright (v=13.6 mag) variable star (0.2 mag peak-to-trough)with a main-sequence g-type spectrum and a period p = 7.8 hr, likely aw-uma-type contact binary. analysis of our data outside of the frb beamsindicates a 5% chance probability of finding a variable star of this brightnessand amplitude within the frb beams. we find no unusual variable stars in theother two frb fields. further observations are needed to investigate if similarnearby (&lt;~ 800 pc) stars are the sources of frbs.

1312.0628	observational clues to the progenitors of type-ia supernovae	type-ia supernovae (sne ia) are important distance indicators, elementfactories, cosmic-ray accelerators, kinetic-energy sources in galaxy evolution,and endpoints of stellar binary evolution. it has long been clear that a sn iamust be the runaway thermonuclear explosion of a degenerate carbon-oxygenstellar core, most likely a white dwarf (wd). however, the specific progenitorsystems of sne ia, and the processes that lead to their ignition, have not beenidentified. two broad classes of progenitor binary systems have long beenconsidered: single-degenerate (sd), in which a wd gains mass from anon-degenerate star; and double-degenerate (dd), involving the merger of twowds. new theoretical work has enriched these possibilities with someinteresting updates and variants. we review the significant recentobservational progress in addressing the progenitor problem. we consider cluesthat have emerged from the observed properties of the various proposedprogenitor populations, from studies of their sites, pre- and post-explosion,from analysis of the explosions themselves, and from the measurement of eventrates. the recent nearby and well-studied event, sn 2011fe, has beenparticularly revealing. the observational results are not yet conclusive, andsometimes prone to competing theoretical interpretations. nevertheless, itappears that dd progenitors, long considered the underdog option, could bebehind some, if not all, sne ia. we point to some directions that may lead tofuture progress.

1403.1878	progenitor constraints on the type-ia supernova sn2011fe from  pre-explosion hubble space telescope heii narrow-band observations	we present hubble space telescope (hst) imaging observations of the site ofthe type-ia supernova sn2011fe in the nearby galaxy m101, obtained about oneyear prior to the event, in a narrow band centred on the heii 4686 \aa{}emission line. in a "single-degenerate" progenitor scenario, the hard photonflux from an accreting white dwarf (wd), burning hydrogen on its surface over$\sim1$ myr should, in principle, create a heiii str\"{o}mgren sphere or shellsurrounding the wd. depending on the wd luminosity, the interstellar density,and the velocity of an outflow from the wd, the heiii region could appearunresolved, extended, or as a ring, with a range of possible surfacebrightnesses. we find no trace of heii 4686 \aa{} line emission in the hstdata. using simulations, we set $2\sigma$ upper limits on the heii 4686 \aa{}luminosity of $l_{\rm heii} &lt; 3.4 \times 10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$ for a pointsource, corresponding to an emission region of radius $r &lt; 1.8$ pc. the upperlimit for an extended source is $l_{\rm heii} &lt; 1.7 \times 10^{35}$ ergs$^{-1}$, corresponding to an extended region with $r\sim11$ pc. the largestdetectable shell, given an interstellar-medium density of 1 cm$^{-3}$, has aradius of $\sim6$ pc. our results argue against the presence, within the$\sim10^5$ yr prior to the explosion, of a supersoft x-ray source of luminosity$l_{\rm bol} \ge 3 \times 10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$, or of a super-eddingtonaccreting wd that produces an outflowing wind capable of producing cavitieswith radii of 2-6 pc.

1409.5129	kepler and the seven dwarfs: detection of low-level day-timescale  periodic photometric variations in white dwarfs	we make use of the high photometric precision of kepler to search forperiodic modulations among 14 normal (da- and db-type, likely non-magnetic) hotwhite dwarfs (wds). in five, and possibly up to seven of the wds, we detectperiodic, ~2 hr to 10 d, variations, with semi-amplitudes of 60 - 2000 ppm,lower than ever seen in wds. we consider various explanations: wd rotationcombined with magnetic cool spots; rotation combined with magnetic dichroism;rotation combined with hot spots from an interstellar-medium accretion flow;transits by size ~50 - 200 km objects; relativistic beaming due to reflexmotion caused by a cool companion wd; or reflection/re-radiation of the primarywd light by a brown-dwarf or giant-planet companion, undergoing illuminationphases as it orbits the wd. each mechanism could be behind some of the variablewds, but could not be responsible for all five to seven variable cases.alternatively, the periodicity may arise from uv metal-line opacity, associatedwith accretion of rocky material, a phenomenon seen in ~50% of hot wds.non-uniform uv opacity, combined with wd rotation and fluorescent opticalre-emission of the absorbed uv energy, could perhaps explain our findings. evenif reflection by a planet is the cause in only a few of the seven cases, itwould imply that hot jupiters are very common around wds. if some of therotation-related mechanisms are at work, then normal wds rotate as slowly as dopeculiar wds, the only kind for which precise rotation measurements have beenpossible to date. followup observations for this sample, and the larger numbersof additional wds now being monitored as part of the k2 kepler missionextension, will soon discriminate among these possibilities.

1502.01015	the progenitors and lifetimes of planetary nebula	planetary nebulae (pne) are amongst the most spectacular objects produced bystellar evolution, but the exact identity of their progenitors has never beenestablished for a large and homogeneous observational sample. we investigatethe relationship between pne and their stellar progenitors in the largemagellanic cloud (lmc) through the statistical comparison between a highlycomplete spectroscopic catalog of pne and the spatially resolved agedistribution of the underlying stellar populations. we find that most pnprogenitors in the lmc have main-sequence lifetimes in a narrow range between 5and 8 gyr, which corresponds to masses between 1.2 and 1.0 m$_{\odot}$, andproduce pne that last $26^{+6}_{-7}$~kyr on average. we tentatively detect asecond population of pn progenitors, with main-sequence lifetimes between 35and 800~myr, i.e., masses between 8.2 and 2.1 m$_{\odot}$, and average pnlifetimes of $11^{+6}_{-7}$ kyr. these two distinct and disjoint populations ofprogenitors strongly suggest the existence of at least two physically distinctformation channels for pne. our determination of pn lifetimes and progenitormasses has implications for the understanding of pne in the context of stellarevolution models, and for the role that rotation, magnetic fields, and binaritycan play in the shaping of pn morphologies.

1507.01002	fast radio bursts: the observational case for a galactic origin	there are by now ten published detections of fast radio bursts (frbs), singlebright ghz-band millisecond pulses of unknown origin. proposed explanationscover a broad range from exotic processes at cosmological distances toatmospheric and terrestrial sources. loeb et al. have previously suggested thatfrb sources could be nearby flare stars, and pointed out the presence of aw-uma-type contact binary within the beam of one out of three frb fields thatthey examined. using time-domain optical photometry and spectroscopy, we nowfind possible flare stars in additional frb fields, with one to three suchcases among eight frb fields studied. we evaluate the chance probabilities ofthese possible associations to be in the range 0.1% to 9%, depending on theinput assumptions. further, we re-analyze the probability that two frbsrecently discovered 3 years apart within the same radio beam are unrelated.contrary to other claims, we conclude with 99% confidence that the two eventsare from the same repeating source. the different dispersion measures betweenthe two bursts then rule out a cosmological origin for the dispersion measure,but are consistent with the flare-star scenario with a varying plasma blanketbetween bursts. finally, we review some theoretical objections that have beenraised against a local flare-star frb origin, and show that they are incorrect.

astro-ph;0202198	not color blind: using multiband photometry to classify supernovae	large numbers of supernovae (sne) have been discovered in recent years, andmany more will be found in the near future. once discovered, further study of asn and its possible use as an astronomical tool (e.g., as a distance estimator)require knowledge of the sn type. current classification methods rely almostsolely on the analysis of sn spectra to determine their type. however,spectroscopy may not be possible or practical when sne are faint, numerous, ordiscovered in archival studies. we present a classification method for snebased on the comparison of their observed colors with synthetic ones,calculated from a large database of multi-epoch optical spectra of nearbyevents. we discuss the capabilities and limitations of this method. forexample, type ia sne at redshifts z &lt; 0.1 can be distinguished from most othersn types during the first few weeks of their evolution, based on v-r vs. r-icolors. type ii-p sne have distinct (very red) colors at late (t &gt; 100 days)stages. broadband photometry through standard johnson-cousins $ubvri$ filterscan be useful to classify sne out to z ~ 0.6. the use of sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) ugriz filters allows the extension of our classification methodto even higher redshifts (z = 0.75), and the use of infrared bands, to z = 2.5.we demonstrate the application of this method to a recently discovered sn fromthe sdss. finally, we outline the observational data required to furtherimprove the sensitivity of the method, and discuss prospects for its use onfuture sn samples. community access to the tools developed is provided by adedicated website (http://wise-obs.tau.ac.il/~dovip/typing) .

astro-ph;0211334	a population of intergalactic supernovae in galaxy clusters	we have discovered seven type ia cluster supernovae (sne) in the course ofthe wise observatory optical transients search in the fields of galaxy clusterswith redshifts between z=0.06 and z=0.2. two of these events, sn 1998fc inabell 403 (z=0.10) and sn 2001al in abell 2122/4 (z = 0.066), have no obvioushosts. both events appear projected on the halos of the central cd galaxies,but have velocity offsets of 750-2000 km/s relative to those galaxies,suggesting they are not bound to them. we use deep keck imaging of thelocations of the two sne to put upper limits on the luminosities of possibledwarf hosts, m_r &gt; -14 mag for sn 1998fc and m_r &gt; -11.8 mag for sn 2001al. thefractions of the cluster luminosities in dwarf galaxies fainter than our limitsare less than 3 x 10^-3 and 3 x 10^-4, respectively. thus, 2/7 of the sne wouldbe associated with less than 3 x 10^-3 of the luminosity attributed togalaxies. we argue, instead, that the progenitors of both events were probablymembers of a diffuse population of intergalactic stars, recently detected inlocal clusters via planetary nebulae and red giants. considering the higherdetectability of hostless sne compared to normal sne, we estimate that20^{+12}_{-15} percent of the sn ia parent stellar population in clusters isintergalactic. this fraction is consistent with other measurements of theintergalactic stellar population, and implies that the process that producesintergalactic stars (e.g., tidal disruption of cluster dwarfs) does not disruptor enhance significantly the sn ia formation mechanism. hostless sne arepotentially powerful tracers of the formation of the intergalactic stellarpopulation out to high redshift.

astro-ph;0305201	the redshift distribution of gravitational lenses revisited: constraints  on galaxy mass evolution	the redshifts of lens galaxies in known gravitational lens systems probe thevolume distribution of lensing mass. following earlier work by kochanek, were-derive the lens redshift probability distribution, allowing for mass andnumber density evolution of the lensing galaxies, and apply this test to a muchenlarged sample of lens systems. from a literature survey of all known lenses,we have selected an unbiased sample of 15 lenses with complete redshiftinformation. for a flat universe and no lens evolution, we can only put anupper limit on the cosmological constant of omega_lambda&lt;0.89 at the 95% cl.omega_lambda~0.7 and no evolution is consistent with the data. allowing forevolution in an omega_m=0.3, omega_lambda=0.7 cosmology, we find that thebest-fit evolution in sigma* (i.e., the characteristic velocity dispersion in aschechter-like function) of early-type galaxies, in the redshift range z~0 to1, is d[log sigma*(z)]/dz=-0.10+/-0.06. this is consistent with no evolutionand implies that, at 95% cl, sigma* of early-type galaxies at z~1 was at least63% of its current value. alternatively, if there is no mass evolution, apresent-day value of sigma*&gt;175 km/s for elliptical galaxies is required (95%cl).

astro-ph;0308530	using multi-band photometry to classify supernovae	large numbers of supernovae (sne) have been discovered in recent years, andmany more will be found in the near future. once discovered, further study of asn and its possible use as an astronomical tool (e.g., as a distance estimator)require knowledge of the sn type. current classification methods rely almostsolely on the analysis of sn spectra to determine their type. however,spectroscopy may not be possible or practical. we present a classificationmethod for sne based on the comparison of their observed colors with syntheticones, calculated from a large database of multi-epoch optical spectra of nearbyevents. broadband photometry at optical wavelengths allows classification ofsne up to z = 0.75, and the use of infrared bands extends it further to z =2.5. we demonstrate the applicability of this method, outline the observationaldata required to further improve the usefulness of the method, and discussprospects for its use on future sn samples. community access to the toolsdeveloped is provided by a dedicated website(http://wise-obs.tau.ac.il/~dovip/typing).

astro-ph;0309796	the redshift distribution of type-ia supernovae: constraints on  progenitors and cosmic star formation history	we use the redshift distribution of type-ia supernovae (sne) discovered bythe supernova cosmology project to constrain the star formation history (sfh)of the universe and sn ia progenitor models. given some of the recentdeterminations of the sfh, the observed sn ia redshift distribution indicates along (&gt;~1 h^-1 gyr) mean delay time between the formation of a stellarpopulation and the explosion of some of its members as sne ia. for example, ifthe madau et al. (1998) sfh is assumed, the delay time tau is constrained to betau &gt; 1.7 (tau &gt; 0.7) h^-1 gyr at the 95%(99%) confidence level (cl). sfhs thatrise at high redshift, similar to those advocated by lanzetta et al. (2002),are inconsistent with the data at the 95% cl unless tau &gt; 2.5 h^-1 gyr. longtime delays disfavor progenitor models such as edge-lit detonation of a whitedwarf accreting from a giant donor, and the carbon core ignition of a whitedwarf passing the chandrasekhar mass due to accretion from a subgiant. the snia delay may be shorter, thereby relaxing some of these constraints, if thefield star formation rate falls, between z=1 and the present, less sharply thanimplied, e.g., by the original madau plot. we show that the discovery of largersamples of high-z sne ia by forthcoming observational projects should yieldstrong constraints on the progenitor models and the sfh. in a companion paper(astro-ph/0309797), we demonstrate that if sne ia produce most of the iron ingalaxy clusters, and the stars in clusters formed at z~2, the sn ia delay timemust be lower than 2 gyr. if so, then the lanzetta et al. (2002) sfh will beruled out by the data presented here.

astro-ph;0309797	the type-ia supernova rate in z &lt; 1 galaxy clusters: implications for  progenitors and the source of cluster iron	the iron mass in galaxy clusters is about 6 times larger than could have beenproduced by core-collapse supernovae (sne), assuming the stars in the clusterformed with a standard initial mass function (imf). sne ia have been proposedas the alternative dominant iron source. different sn ia progenitor modelspredict different ``delay functions'' between the formation of a stellarpopulation and the explosion of some of its members as sne ia. we use ourprevious measurements of the cluster sn ia rate at high redshift to constrainsn ia progenitor models and the star-formation epoch in clusters. the lowobserved rate of cluster sne ia at z ~ 0 - 1 means that, if sne ia produced theobserved amount of iron, they must have exploded at even higher z. this puts a&gt;95% upper limit on the mean sn ia delay time of tau &lt;2 gyr (&lt;5 gyr) if thestars in clusters formed at redshift z&lt;2 (z&lt;3), assuming ho=70 km/s/mpc. in acompanion paper (astro-ph/0309796), we show that, for some current versions ofcosmic (field) star formation history (sfh), observations of field sne ia placea lower bound on the delay time, tau&gt;3 gyr. if these sfhs are confirmed, theentire range of tau will be ruled out. cluster enrichment by core-collapse snefrom a top-heavy imf will then remain the only viable option.

astro-ph;0501491	quasar lensing statistics and omega_lambda: what went wrong?	in the pre-wmap, pre-supernova-ia-hubble-diagram era, quasar lensingstatistics stubbornly indicated low values of omega_lambda. in contrast, anumber of recent lensing statistics studies either find the data support thestandard lambda-cdm picture, or simply take the standard cosmologicalparameters as a given. have the data or the analyses changed or improved, andhow? i review several of the ``historical'' and the more recent studies, andshow that there is no particular measurement, assumption, or model parameter inthe old studies that was grossly wrong. instead, at least several effects,operating together, are likely required in order to achieve agreement betweenthe observations and the currently standard cosmology. most likely among theseeffects are: a somewhat lower lensing cross section for elliptical galaxiesthan assumed in the past; some loss of lensed quasars in optical samples due toextinction by the lenses; and a somewhat lower-than-standard value ofomega_lambda ~ 0.6. the agreement between recent model calculations and theresults of radio lens surveys may be fortuitous, and due to a cancellationbetween the errors in the input parameters for the lens population and thecosmology, on the one hand, and for the source population, on the other hand.

astro-ph;0502347	the murmur of the sleeping black hole: detection of nuclear ultraviolet  variability in liner galaxies	liner nuclei, which are present in many nearby galactic bulges, may be themanifestation of low-rate or low-radiative-efficiency accretion ontosupermassive central black holes. however, it has been unclear whether thecompact uv nuclear sources present in many liners are clusters of massivestars, rather than being directly related to the accretion process. we haveused hst to monitor the uv variability of a sample of 17 galaxies with linernuclei and compact nuclear uv sources. fifteen of the 17 galaxies were observedmore than once, with two to five epochs per galaxy, spanning up to a year. wedetect significant variability in most of the sample, with peak-to-peakamplitudes from a few percent to 50%. in most cases, correlated variations areseen in two independent bands (f250w and f330w). comparison to previous uvmeasurements indicates, for many objects, long-term variations by factors of afew over decade timescales. variability is detected in liners with and withoutdetected compact radio cores, in liners that have broad h-alpha wings detectedin their optical spectra (``liner 1's''), and in those that do not (``liner2s''). this variability demonstrates the existence of a non-stellar componentin the uv continuum of all types, and sets a lower limit to the luminosity ofthis component. we note a trend in the uv color (f250w/f330w) with spectraltype - liner 1s tend to be bluer than liner 2s. this trend may indicate a linkbetween the shape of the nonstellar continuum and the presence or thevisibility of a broad-line region. in one target, the post-starburst galaxy ngc4736, we detect variability in a previously noted uv source that is offset by2.5" (60 pc in projection) from the nucleus. this may be the nearest example ofa binary active nucleus, and of the process leading to black hole merging.

astro-ph;0504484	the relationship between luminosity and broad-line region size in active  galactic nuclei	we reinvestigate the relationship between the characteristic broad-lineregion size (r_blr) and the balmer emission-line, x-ray, uv, and opticalcontinuum luminosities. our study makes use of the best availabledeterminations of r_blr for a large number of active galactic nuclei (agns)from peterson et al. using their determinations of r_blr for a large sample ofagns and two different regression methods, we investigate the robustness of ourcorrelation results as a function of data sub-sample and regression technique.though small systematic differences were found depending on the method ofanalysis, our results are generally consistent. assuming a power-law relationr_blr \propto l^\alpha, we find the mean best-fitting \alpha is about0.67+/-0.05 for the optical continuum and the broad h\beta luminosity, about0.56+/-0.05 for the uv continuum luminosity, and about 0.70+/-0.14 for thex-ray luminosity. we also find an intrinsic scatter of about 40% in theserelations. the disagreement of our results with the theoretical expected slopeof 0.5 indicates that the simple assumption of all agns having on average sameionization parameter, blr density, column density, and ionizing spectral energydistribution, is not valid and there is likely some evolution of a few of thesecharacteristics along the luminosity scale.

astro-ph;0506376	the remnants of intergalactic supernovae	intergalactic type-ia supernovae (sne-ia) have been discovered recently inrich galaxy clusters, likely the descendants of an intergalactic stellarpopulation found in recent years through a variety of tracers. we estimate theobservational signatures of the associated sn remnants (snrs) in the unusualintracluster medium (icm) environment. if sne-ia still have a circumstellarmedium (csm) at the time of explosion, then their remnants are visible in theoptical for ~100-1000 years, with properties similar to young galactic snrs. incontrast with galactic snrs, in which the ejecta from the explosion interactswith the ism, intracluster snrs become undetectable in the optical once theirejecta passes beyond the csm and enters the hot and tenuous icm. if sne-ia havea csm, there should be ~150 young snrs in the virgo cluster, withl(h-alpha)~10^{35} erg/s and angular size ~0.1''. we investigate thepossibility that members of this snr population may have recently beendetected, but incorrectly identified as intergalactic hii regions.alternatively, if optical intergalactic snrs do not exist in virgo, this willbe evidence that sne-ia are devoid of a csm, with implications for progenitorscenarios. regardless of the presence of a csm, about 10 older radio snrs persquare degree should be detectable in virgo, with fluxes of ~0.1 mjy at 1 ghz.their angular sizes, morphologies, and lack of optical association with distantgalaxies can distinguish them from the much more numerous backgroundpopulation. their detection would provide a measurement of the intracluster snrate. observations toward the site of sn1980i, a possibly intergalactic virgosn-ia, can test the existence of a csm by comparison to our early-timepredictions for intergalactic snr development.

astro-ph;0507360	discovery of multiply imaged galaxies behind the cluster and lensed  quasar sdss j1004+4112	we have identified three multiply imaged galaxies in hubble space telescopeimages of the redshift z=0.68 cluster responsible for the large-separationquadruply lensed quasar, sdss j1004+4112. spectroscopic redshifts have beensecured for two of these systems using the keck i 10m telescope. the mostdistant lensed galaxy, at z=3.332, forms at least four images, and an einsteinring encompassing 3.1 times more area than the einstein ring of the lensed qsoimages at z=1.74, due to the greater source distance. for a second multiplyimaged galaxy, we identify ly_alpha emission at a redshift of z=2.74. thecluster mass profile can be constrained from near the center of the brightestcluster galaxy, where we observe both a radial arc and the fifth image of thelensed quasar, to the einstein radius of the highest redshift galaxy, ~110 kpc.our preliminary modeling indicates that the mass approximates an ellipticalbody, with an average projected logarithmic gradient of ~-0.5. the system ispotentially useful for a direct measurement of world models in a previouslyuntested redshift range.

astro-ph;0610129	bayesian single-epoch photometric classification of supernovae	(abridged) ongoing supernova (sn) surveys find hundreds of candidates, thatrequire confirmation for their use. traditional classification based onfollowup spectroscopy of all candidates is virtually impossible for these largesamples. we present an automatic bayesian classifying algorithm for supernovae,the sn-abc. we rely solely on single-epoch multiband photometry and host-galaxy(photometric) redshift information to sort sn candidates into the two majortypes, ia and core-collapse supernovae. we test the sn-abc performance onpublished samples of sne from the snls and goods projects that have bothbroad-band photometry and spectroscopic classification (so the true type isknown). the sn-abc correctly classifies up to 97% (85%) of the type ia (ii-p)sne in snls, and similar fractions of the goods sne, depending on photometricredshift quality. using simulations with large artificial samples, we findsimilarly high success fractions for type ia and ii-p, and reasonable (~75%)success rates in classifying type ibc sne as core-collapse. type iin sne,however, are often misclassified as ia's. in deep surveys, sne ia are bestclassified at redshifts z &gt;~ 0.6, or when near maximum, with success rates ofthe order of 95%. core-collapse sne are best recognized several weeks aftermaximum, or at z &lt;~ 0.6, and reach success rates near 80%. assuming the sne areyoung, as would be the case for rolling surveys, the success fractions improve,by a degree dependent on the type and redshift. the sn-abc also allows therejection of sn "impostors" such as active galactic nuclei (agns), with half ofof the agns we simulate rejected by the algorithm. our algorithm also suppliesa good measure of the quality of the classification, which is valuable forerror estimation.

astro-ph;0610228	supernovae in low-redshift galaxy clusters: the type-ia supernova rate	supernova (sn) rates are a potentially powerful diagnostic of star formationhistory (sfh), metal enrichment, and sn physics, particularly in galaxyclusters with their deep, metal-retaining potentials, and simple sfh. however,a low-redshift cluster sn rate has never been published. we derive the sn ratein galaxy clusters at 0.06&lt;z&lt;0.19, based on type ia supernovae (sne ia) thatwere discovered by the wise observatory optical transient survey. as describedin a separate paper, a sample of 140 rich abell clusters was monitored, inwhich six cluster sne ia were found and confirmed spectroscopically. here, wedetermine the sn detection efficiencies of the individual survey images, andcombine the efficiencies with the known spectral properties of sne ia tocalculate the effective visibility time of the survey. the cluster stellarluminosities are measured from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) database inthe griz sdss bands. uncertainties are estimated using monte-carlo simulationsin which all input parameters are allowed to vary over their knowndistributions. we derive sn rates normalized by stellar luminosity, in snuunits (sne per century per 10^10 l_sun) in five photometric bandpasses, of0.36+/-(0.22,0.14)+/-0.02 (b), 0.351+/-(0.210,0.139)+/-0.020 (g),0.288+/-(0.172,0.114)+/-0.018 (r), 0.229+/-(0.137,0.091)+/-0.014 (i),0.186+/-(0.111,0.074)+/-0.010 (z), where the quoted errors are statistical andsystematic, respectively. the sn rate per stellar mass unit, derived using acolor-luminosity-mass relation, is 0.098+/-(0.059,0.039)+/-0.009 sne (century10^10 m_sun)^-1. the low cluster sn rates we find are similar to, andconsistent with, the sn ia rate in local elliptical galaxies.

astro-ph;0702292	low-luminosity active galactic nuclei: are they uv-faint and radio loud?	low-luminosity agns are perceived to be radio loud and devoid of a ``big bluebump'', indicating a transition from a radiatively efficient, geometricallythin, accretion disc in high-luminosity agns, to a geometrically thick,radiatively inefficient accretion flow at low luminosities and accretion rates.i revisit the issue of the spectral energy distributions (seds) oflow-luminosity agns using recently published, high-angular-resolution data atradio, uv, and x-ray wavelengths, for a sample of 13 nearby galaxies with linernuclei. i show that, contrary to common wisdom, low-luminosity agns havesignificant nonstellar uv flux, and uv/x-ray luminosity ratios similar, onaverage, to those of seyfert 1 nuclei ~10^4 times more luminous. the alpha_oxindex that quantifies this ratio is in the range between -0.8 to -1.4, and isbelow the extrapolation to low luminosities of the relation between alpha_ oxand uv luminosity observed at higher luminosities. in terms of radio loudness,most of the liners are indeed radio loud (or sometimes even ``super radioloud'') based on their radio/uv luminosity ratios, when compared to the mostluminous quasars. however, the entire distribution of radio loudness has beenshown to shift to higher radio/uv ratios at low agn luminosities. in thecontext of this global shift, some liners (the majority) can be consideredradio quiet, and some (from among those with black hole masses &gt;~10^8.5 m_sun)are radio loud. the seds of low-luminosity (~10^40 erg/s) agns are thus quitesimilar to those of seyferts up to luminosities of ~10^44erg/s, and there is noevidence for a sharp change in the seds at the lowest luminosities. thin agnaccretion discs may therefore persist at low accretion rates, in analogy tosome recent findings for galactic stellar-mass accreting black holes.

astro-ph;9401020	a spectroscopic method to measure macho proper motions	a massive compact halo object (macho) that lenses a background star willmagnify different parts of the rotating stellar disk by varying amounts. thedifferential magnification will cause a shift in the centroid of the star'sspectral lines during the lensing event. the shift is proportional to the ratioof the stellar radius to the projected separation of the macho from the star.it therefore provides a direct measure of the einstein ring radius, and so alsoa measure of the macho's proper motion (angular speed). this measurement canremove some of the degeneracy between mass, distance to the lens, andtransverse velocity that exists in the interpretation of results from ongoingmicrolensing experiments, and is an independent test of the lensing nature ofthe event. we show that using the high precision attainable by stellar radialvelocity measurements, it is possible to measure proper motions for $\sim 10\%$of machos that lens a-stars in the large magellanic cloud (lmc), i.e.\ $\sim7\%$ of the type of relatively high-magnification events that have beenreported to date. if this proper-motion measurement were combined with aparallax measurement of the ``reduced velocity'', then the macho mass,distance, speed, and direction could each be separately determined. the shiftcan be measured for $\sim 20\%$ of the a-star events generated by machos in thedark halo of the lmc. this in turn would provide a measurement of the fractionof lmc vs. galactic macho events.

astro-ph;9405014	galaxy mergers and gravitational lens statistics	we investigate the impact of hierarchical galaxy merging on the statistics ofgravitational lensing of distant sources. since no definite theoreticalpredictions for the merging history of luminous galaxies exist, we adopt aparametrized prescription, which allows us to adjust the expected number ofpieces comprising a typical present galaxy at z=0.65. the existence of globalparameter relations for elliptical galaxies and constraints on the evolution ofthe phase space density in dissipationless mergers, allow us to limit thepossible evolution of galaxy lens properties under merging.  we draw two lessons from implementing this lens evolution into statisticallens calculations: (1) the total optical depth to multiple imaging (e.g. ofquasars) is quite insensitive to merging. (2) merging leads to a smaller meanseparation of observed multiple images. because merging does not reducedrastically the expected lensing frequency it cannot make $\lambda$-dominatedcosmologies compatible with the existing lensing observations. a comparisonwith the data from the hst snapshot survey shows that models with little or noevolution of the lens population are statistically favored over strong mergingscenarios. the specific merging scenario proposed by toomre (1977) can berejected (95\% level) by such a comparison. some versions of the scenarioproposed by broadhurst, ellis \&amp; glazebrook (1992), are statisticallyacceptable.

astro-ph;9408042	detection of compact ultraviolet nuclear emission in liner galaxies	low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (liners), which exist in a largefraction of galaxies, may be the least luminous manifestation of quasaractivity. the nature of liners has, however, remained controversial because anagn-like nonstellar continuum source has not been directly observed in them. wereport the detection of bright, unresolved (fwhm $\ltorder 0.1''$) pointsources of uv ($\sim 2300$ \aa) emission in the nuclei of nine nearby galaxiesfrom a complete sample of 110 nearby galaxies imaged with {\it hst}.ground-based optical spectroscopy reveals that five of the nuclei are liners,three are starburst nuclei, and one is a seyfert nucleus. the observed uv fluxin each of the five liners implies an ionizing flux that is sufficient toaccount for the observed emission lines through photoionization. the detectionof a strong uv continuum in the liners argues against shock excitation as thesource of the observed emission lines, and supports the idea thatphotoionization excites the lines in at least some objects of this class. amongthe northern-hemisphere galaxies in the sample, 26 are liners, of which onlythe above five liners have a detected nuclear uv source. there are no obviousdifferences in the optical line intensity ratios between the uv-bright anduv-dark liners. if all liners are photoionized, then the continuum source isunobscured along our line of sight in $5/26\approx 20\%$ of liners.alternatively, spectrally-similar liners may be produced by various excitationmechanisms, with photoionization responsible in only about 20\% of the cases.the high angular resolution allows us to set upper limits, typically severalparsecs, on the physical size of the compact star-cluster or agn-type continuumsource that is emitting the uv light in these objects.

astro-ph;9512072	ultraviolet imaging and spectroscopy of liners	i review the uv properties of liners (low-ionization nuclear emission-lineregions), based mostly on the recent {\it hst} uv imaging survey of nearbygalaxies by maoz et al. (1995). 25 of the galaxies in the northern subsamplehost a liner nucleus. six of these display a prominent compact ($&lt;$ few pc)nuclear uv ($\sim 2300$\aa) source in the {\it hst} images. the remaining 19liners are ``uv-dark'', with no detectable compact nuclear source. in the sixuv-bright objects, the uv flux is correlated with h$\alpha$ flux. whenextrapolated beyond the lyman limit, the uv luminosity is sufficient to producethe observed h$\alpha$ luminosity through photoionization. some linerstherefore have a uv continuum source consistent with the expectations from themicro-quasar hypothesis. the 19 uv-dark objects are comparable in h$\alpha$flux and luminosity to the uv-bright objects, and their darkness is not adetection-limit problem. extinction by the host galaxy disk or other foregrounddust cannot explain the entire effect. i consider several hypotheses explainingwhy only $\sim 25\%$ of liners display a central uv source: obscuration of theuv source by nlr dust or a molecular torus; the uv source is ``turned-off''most of the time; photoionization by an extended population of old stars; or,most liners are not photoionized objects. i discuss observational tests thatwill soon discriminate between these possibilities.

astro-ph;9604012	hubble space telescope ultraviolet images of five circumnuclear  star-forming rings	we present uv (2300 ang) images, obtained with the hst faint object camera,of the central 20'' of five galaxies containing circumnuclear star-formingrings. the five galaxies are from a well-defined sample of 103 normal, nearbygalaxies we have observed with hst. at the hst resolution (0.05''), the ringsbreak up into discrete star-forming clumps, each composed of many luminous andcompact ($r \ltorder 5$ pc) star clusters. these objects are similar to thosethat have been recently reported in colliding and starburst galaxies, and inseveral other circumnuclear rings. a large fraction, 15%--50%, of the uvemission originates in these compact clusters. compact clusters therefore maybe the preferred mode of star formation in starburst environments. for onegalaxy, ngc 2997, we measure the uv-optical colors of the individual clustersusing an archival hst wfpc2 image at 6000 ang . comparing the colors andluminosities to starburst population synthesis models, we show that theclusters are less than 100 myr old and have masses of at least a few $10^3m_{\odot}$, with some as high as $10^5 m_{\odot}$. the uv extinction to thoseclusters that are detected in the uv is at most a factor of 10. in ngc 2997,the limits on the masses and the ages of the young clusters indicate that theseobjects will remain bound and evolve into globular clusters. the luminosityfunction of the clusters in the rings is similar in shape to those measured forsuper star clusters in other star-forming galaxies, and extends to luminositieslower by several orders of magnitude. all five of the uv-detected circumnuclearrings occur in barred or weakly barred spiral galaxies of type sc or earlier.none of the five rings has an active nucleus at its center, arguing against adirect correspondence between circumnuclear star formation and nuclear

astro-ph;9612149	evidence for a new class of extreme uv sources	most of the sources detected in the extreme ultraviolet (euv; 100 ang to 600ang) by the rosat wfc and euve all-sky surveys have been identified with activelate-type stars and hot white dwarfs that are near enough to escape absorptionby interstellar gas. however, about 15% of euv sources are as of yetunidentified with any optical counterparts. we examine whether the unidentifiedeuv sources may consist of the same population of late-type stars and whitedwarfs. we present b and r photometry of stars in the fields of seven of theunidentified euv sources. we detect in the optical the entire main-sequence andwhite-dwarf population out to the greatest distances where they could stillavoid absorption. we use colour-magnitude diagrams to demonstrate that, in mostof the fields, none of the observed stars have the colours and magnitudes oflate-type dwarfs at distances less than 100 pc. similarly, none are whitedwarfs within 500 pc that are hot enough to be euv-emitters. the unidentifiedeuv sources we study are not detected in x-rays, while cataclysmic variables,x-ray binaries, and active galactic nuclei generally are. we conclude that someof the euv sources may be a new class of nearby objects, that are either veryfaint at optical bands or which mimic the colours and magnitudes of distantlate-type stars or cool white dwarfs. one candidate for optically faint objectsis isolated old neutron stars, slowly accreting interstellar matter. suchneutron stars are expected to be abundant in the galaxy, and have not beenunambiguously detected.

astro-ph;9612159	a survey for large image-separation lensed quasars	the statistics of gravitationally lensed quasars with multiple images in the0.1''-7'' range have been measured in various surveys. little is known,however, about lensed-quasar statistics at larger image separations, whichprobe masses on the scale of galaxy clusters. we extend the results of the hstsnapshot survey for lensed quasars to the 7''-50'' range for a sub-sample of 76quasars that is free of known selection effects. using a combination ofmulticolor photometry and spectroscopy, we show that none of the point sourcesin the entire field of view of the hst observations of these quasars are lensedimages. large-separation quasar lensing is therefore not common. we carry out adetailed calculation of the expected statistics of large-separation lensing forthis quasar sample, incorporating realistic input for the mass profiles andmass function of galaxy clusters. we find that the observational null resultsare consistent with the expected effect of galaxy clusters, even if these haveexisted in their present form and number since z of about 2. the rarity oflarge-separation lensed quasars can rule out some extreme scenarios, e.g. thatthe mass-function of clusters has been severely underestimated, or that largemass concentrations that are not associated with galaxies (i.e. ``failed''clusters) are common. the rareness of wide lensing also sets limits on thecosmological constant that are independent of limits derived from galaxylensing. the lensing statistics of larger quasar samples can probe thestructure, number, and evolution of clusters, as well as the geometry of space.

astro-ph;9710323	the ultraviolet spectra of liners: a comparative study	imaging studies have shown that about 25% of liner galaxies display a compactnuclear uv source. as part of a program to study the nature of liners and theirconnection to the active galaxy phenomenon, we compare the hst ultraviolet(1150-3200 ang) spectra of seven such uv-bright liners. data for three of thegalaxies (ngc 404, ngc 4569, and ngc 5055) are presented for the first time,while data for four others (m81, ngc 4594, ngc 4579, and ngc 6500) have beenrecently published. the spectra of ngc 404, ngc 4569, and ngc 5055 show clearabsorption-line signatures of massive stars, indicating a stellar origin forthe uv continuum. similar features are probably present in ngc 6500. the samestellar signatures may be present but undetectable in ngc 4594, due to the lowsignal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum, and in m81 and ngc 4579, due tosuperposed strong, broad emission lines. the compact central uv continuumsource that is observed in these galaxies is a nuclear star cluster rather thana low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (agn), at least in some cases. exceptfor the two liners with broad emission lines (m81 and ngc 4579), the linershave weak or no detectable uv emission lines. at least four of the linerssuffer from an ionizing photon deficit, in the sense that the ionizing photonflux inferred from the observed far-uv continuum is insufficient to drive theoptical h i recombination lines. examination of the nuclear x-ray flux of eachgalaxy shows a high x-ray/uv ratio in the four ``uv-photon starved'' liners.future observations can determine whether the uv continuum in liners is alwaysdominated by a starburst or, alternatively, that there are two types ofuv-bright liners: starburst-dominated and agn-dominated.

astro-ph;9802103	on uncertainties in cross-correlation lags and the reality of  wavelength-dependent continuum lags in active galactic nuclei	we describe a model-independent method of assessing the uncertainties incross-correlation lags determined from agn light curves, and use this method toinvestigate the reality of lags between uv and optical continuum variations inwell-studied agns. our results confirm the existence of such lags in ngc 7469.we find that the continuum variations at 1825 a, 4845 a, and 6962 a followthose at 1315a by 0.22^{+0.12}_{-0.13} days, 1.25^{+0.48}_{-0.35} days, and1.84^{+0.93}_{-0.94} days, respectively, based on the centroids of thecross-correlation functions; the error intervals quoted correspond to 68%confidence levels, and each of these lags is greater than zero at no less than97% confidence. we do not find statistically significant interband continuumlags in ngc 5548, ngc 3783, or fairall 9. wavelength-dependent continuum lagsmay be marginally detected in the case of ngc 4151. however, on the basis oftheoretical considerations, wavelength-dependent continuum lags in sourcesother than ngc 7469 are not expected to have been detectable in previousexperiments. we also confirm the existence of a statistically significant lagbetween x-ray and uv continuum variations in the blazar pks 2155-304.

astro-ph;9809290	the role of stars in the energetics of liners	imaging studies have shown that about 25% of liner galaxies display a compactnuclear uv source. i compare the hst ultraviolet spectra now available forseven such ``uv-bright'' liners. the spectra of ngc 404, ngc 4569, and ngc 5055show clear absorption-line signatures of massive stars, indicating a stellarorigin for the uv continuum. similar features are probably present in ngc 6500.the same stellar signatures may be present but undetectable in ngc 4594, due tothe low signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum, and in m81 and ngc 4579, due tosuperposed strong, broad emission lines. the compact central uv continuumsource that is observed in these galaxies is a nuclear star cluster rather thana low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (agn), at least in some cases. atleast four of the liners suffer from an ionizing photon deficit, in the sensethat the ionizing photon flux inferred from the observed far-uv continuum isinsufficient to drive the optical h i recombination lines. examination of thenuclear x-ray flux of each galaxy shows a high x-ray/uv ratio in the four``uv-photon starved'' liners. in these four objects, a separate component,emitting predominantly in the extreme-uv, is the likely ionizing agent, and isperhaps unrelated to the observed nuclear uv emission. future observations candetermine whether the uv continuum in liners is always dominated by a starburstor, alternatively, that there are two types of uv-bright liners:starburst-dominated and agn-dominated. interestingly, recent results show thatstarbursts dominate the nuclear energetics in many seyfert 2s as well.

astro-ph;9902254	long-term optical variability properties of the palomar-green quasars	we present results from a monitoring program of 42 quasars from the palomargreen sample. the objects were observed for 7 years at the wise observatory, aspart of a long term effort to monitor agn of various types. this is the mostextensive program of its kind carried out to date on a well-defined opticallyselected quasar sample. the typical sampling interval is ~40 days. one third ofthe quasars were observed at ~60 epochs and the rest at ~30 epochs in two bands(b&amp;r) with photometric accuracy of ~0.01 mag. we present lightcurves for all ofthe sources and discuss the sample variability properties. all of the quasarsin the sample varied during the campaign with intrinsic rms amplitudes of5%&lt;sigma_b&lt;34% and 4%&lt;sigma_r&lt;26%. the rms amplitude and colour for the entiresample are sigma_b=14%, sigma_r=12%, and sigma_{b-r}=5%. on time scales of 100-1000 days the power spectra of the sources have a power-law shape with indexapproximately 2.0 and a spread &lt;0.6. at least half of the quasars, particularlythose that are most variable, become bluer when they brighten, and the rest donot show this behaviour. we quantify this phenomenon, which has been observedpreviously mainly in seyfert galaxies. the quasars which are most variable tendalso to exhibit asymmetry in their variations, in the sense that thebrightening phases last longer than the fading phases. we have searched forcorrelations between the measured variability properties and other parametersof the quasars, such as luminosity, redshift, radio loudness, and x-ray slope.we find several new correlations, and reproduce some of the correlationsreported by previous studies.

astro-ph;9903007	a tully fisher relation for s0 galaxies	we present an i-band tully-fisher relation (tfr) for 18 nearby s0 galaxiesusing kinematics derived from long slit spectroscopy of stellar absorptionlines. our estimates of the circular velocity, v_c, at 2-3 exponential diskscale lengths account for line-of-sight projection and for the stellar randommotions through an asymmetric drift correction. uniform and accurate distancecalibration for all objects is available from surface brightness fluctuationmeasurements of tonry et al. (1998). despite the care taken in estimating bothv_c and m_i, the tfr shows an intrinsic scatter, $\sim 0.7$ mag in m_i, or 0.15in log_10(v_c). this result is surprising, as s0 galaxies appear to have boththe simple kinematics of disk galaxies, and the simple stellar populations ofearly-type galaxies. remarkably, in this sample of overall rotation-dominatedgalaxies, the central stellar velocity dispersion is a better predictor of thetotal i-band luminosity (through the fundamental plane relations) than thecircular speed at several exponential scale lengths. furthermore, the tfrzeropoint, or the mean stellar i-band luminosity at a given v_c, differs byonly $\sim 0.5$ mag between our sample of s0s and mathewson et al.'s (1992)sample of late-type spirals, once both data sets are brought onto a consistentdistance scale. this offset is less than expected if s0s are former spiralgalaxies with prematurely truncated star-formation ($\gtorder 4$ gyrs ago).

astro-ph;9910023	a possible 100-day x-ray-to-optical lag in the variations of the seyfert  1 nucleus ngc 3516	we present optical broadband (b and r) observations of the seyfert 1 nucleusngc 3516, obtained at wise observatory from 1997 march to 1998 september,contemporaneously with the x-ray 2-10 kev measurements of rxte. the crosscorrelation function shows a positive peak when the optical variations lead thex-rays by about 100 days. we show that the putative correlation signal at 100days is entirely due to the slow ($\gtorder 30$ days) components of the lightcurves. during the first year or this monitoring, smoothed versions of thelight curves are nearly identical copies of each other, but scaled in amplitudeand shifted in time. however, for the next 200 days, the x-ray and opticalvariations are clearly different. during the whole period, the faster-changingcomponents of the light curves are uncorrelated at any lag. the detection ofthis lag is tentative and the significance of the correlation uncertain. if the100-day delay is real, however, one interpretation is that that theslowly-varying part of the x-ray emission is an echo of the optical emission,compton scattered from a medium located about 50-100 lt days from the opticalsource. we point out that a possibly analogous phenomenon, of a lag betweenhard and soft x-rays for a given variability timescale, exists in galacticstellar-mass accretors. remarkably, in both cases the lag corresponds to alight travel distance of order $10^4$ gravitational radii. alternatively, thelag may not represent a physical size, but for example, the timescale of aninstability propagating inward in an accretion flow, appearing first in theoptical and then in the x-rays. in any event, there is no strong correlation atzero, or small positive, lag, ruling out an energetically-significant x-rayreprocessed component in the optical emission.

astro-ph;9911476	reverberation measurements for 17 quasars and the size-mass-luminosity  relations in active galactic nuclei	(abridged) we have spectrophotometrically monitored a well-defined sample of28 palomar-green quasars in order to obtain measurements of their blrs and toinvestigate the relationships between quasar luminosity, central black holemass, and broad emission line region (blr) size in active galactic nuclei(agn). spectrophotometry was obtained every 1-4 months for 7.5 years, yielding20-70 observing epochs per object. both the continuum and emission line fluxesof all of the quasars were observed to change during the duration of theobserving program. seventeen of the 28 objects were observed with adequatesampling to search for correlated variations between the balmer emission linesand the continuum flux. for each of these 17 objects, a significant correlationwas observed, with the balmer line variations lagging those of the continuum by\~100 days (rest frame). our work increases the available luminosity range forstudying the size-mass-luminosity relations in agn by two orders of magnitudeand doubles the number of objects suitable for such studies. combining ourresults with comparable published data available for seyfert 1 galaxies, wefind the blr size scales with the rest-frame 5100 a luminosity asl^{0.70+-0.03}. this determination of the scaling of the size of the blr as afunction of luminosity is significantly different from those previouslypublished, and suggests that the effective ionization parameter in agn may be adecreasing function of luminosity. we are also able to constrain, subject toour assumption that gravity dominates the motions of the blr gas, the scalingrelationship between the mass of the central black holes and the luminosity inagn: m \propto l^{0.5+-0.1}. this is inconsistent with all agn having opticalluminosity that is a constant fraction of the eddington luminosity.

astro-ph;9912266	intensive hst, rxte and asca monitoring of ngc 3516: evidence against  thermal reprocessing	during 1998 april 13-16, ngc 3516 was monitored almost continuously with hstfor 10.3 hr in the uv and 2.8 d in the optical, and simultaneous rxte and ascamonitoring covered the same period. the x-rays were strongly variable with thesoft (0.5-2 kev) showing stronger variations (~65% peak-to-peak) than the hard(2-10 kev; ~50% peak-to-peak). the optical continuum showed much smaller buthighly significant variations: a slow ~2.5% rise followed by a faster ~3.5%decline. the short uv observation did not show significant variability.  the soft and hard x-ray light curves were strongly correlated with nosignificant lag. likewise, the optical continuum bands (3590 and 5510 a) werealso strongly correlated with no measurable lag above limits of &lt;0.15 d.however no significant correlation or simple relationship could be found forthe optical and x-ray light curves. these results appear difficult to reconcilewith previous reports of correlations between x-ray and optical variations andof measurable lags within the optical band for some other seyfert 1s.  these results also present serious problems for "reprocessing" models inwhich the x-ray source heats a stratified accretion disk which then reemits inthe optical/ultraviolet: the synchronous variations within the optical wouldsuggest that the emitting region is &lt;0.3 lt-d across, while the lack ofcorrelation between x-ray and optical variations would indicate, in the contextof this model, that any reprocessing region must be &gt;1 lt-d in size. it may bepossible to resolve this conflict by invoking anisotropic emission or specialgeometry, but the most natural explanation appears to be that the bulk of theoptical luminosity is generated by some other mechanism than reprocessing.
