0901.4114	hizels: a high redshift survey of h-alpha emitters. ii: the nature of  star-forming galaxies at z=0.84	new results from a large survey of h-alpha emission-line galaxies at z=0.84using wfcam/ukirt and a custom narrow-band filter in the j band are presentedas part of the hizels survey. reaching an effective flux limit of 1e-16erg/s/cm^2 in a comoving volume of 1.8e5 mpc^3, this represents the largest anddeepest survey of its kind ever done at z~1. there are 1517 potential lineemitters detected across 1.4 sq.deg of the cosmos and ukidss uds fields, ofwhich 743 are selected as h-alpha emitters. these are used to calculate theh-alpha luminosity function, which is well-fitted by a schechter function withphi*=10^(-1.92+-0.10) mpc^-3, l*=10^(42.26+-0.05)erg/s, and alpha=-1.65+-0.15.the integrated star formation rate density (sfrd) at z=0.845 is 0.15+-0.01m_sun/yr/mpc^3. the results robustly confirm a strong evolution of sfrd fromthe present day out to z~1 and then flattening to z~2, using a singlestar-formation indicator. out to z~1, both the characteristic luminosity andspace density of the h-alpha emitters increase significantly; at higherredshifts, l* continues to increase, but phi* decreases. the z=0.84 h-alphaemitters are mostly disk galaxies (82+-3%), while 28+-4% of the sample showsigns of merger activity and contribute ~20% to the total sfrd. irregulars andmergers dominate the h-alpha luminosity function above l*, while disks aredominant at fainter luminosities. these results demonstrate that it is theevolution of 'normal' disk galaxies that drives the strong increase in the sfrdfrom the current epoch to z~1, although the continued strong evolution of l*beyond z=1 suggests an increasing importance of merger activity at higherredshifts.

0706.2323	a sample of mjy radio sources at 1.4 ghz in the lynx and hercules fields  - i. radio imaging, multicolour photometry and spectroscopy	with the goal of identifying high redshift radio galaxies with friclassification, here are presented high resolution, wide-field radioobservations, near infra-red and optical imaging and multi-object spectroscopyof two fields of the leiden-berkeley deep survey. these fields, hercules.1 andlynx.2, contain a complete sample of 81 radio sources with s(1.4 ghz) &gt; 0.5 mjywithin 0.6 square degrees. this sample will form the basis for a study of thepopulation and cosmic evolution of high redshift, low power, fri radio sourceswhich will be presented in paper ii. currently, the host galaxy identificationfraction is 86% with 11 sources remaining unidentified at a level of r &gt; 25.2mag (hercules; 4 sources) or r &gt; 24.4 mag (lynx; 7 sources) or k &gt; 20 mag.spectroscopic redshifts have been determined for 49% of the sample andphotometric redshift estimates are presented for the remainder of the sample.

0903.3600	deep multi-frequency radio imaging in the lockman hole using the gmrt  and vla: i. the nature of the sub-mjy radio population	we describe multi-frequency data designed to probe the emission mechanismthat dominates in faint radio sources. our analysis is based on observations ofthe lockman hole using the gmrt - the deepest 610-mhz imaging yet reported -together with 1.4-ghz imaging from the vla, well matched in resolution andsensitivity to the gmrt data. the gmrt and vla data are cross-matched to obtainthe radio spectral indices for the faint radio emitters. statistical analysesshow no clear evolution for the median spectral index, alpha, as a function offlux density. alpha is found to be -0.6 to -0.7, based on an almost unbiased10-sigma criterion, down to a flux level of s(1.4ghz) &gt;~ 100ujy. the fractionof inverted spectrum sources (alpha &gt; 0) is less than 10%. the results suggestthat the most prevalent emission mechanism in the sub-mjy regime isoptically-thin synchrotron, ruling out a dominant flat spectrum or ultra-steepspectrum radio population. the spectral index distribution has a significantscatter, 0.4-0.5, which suggests a mixture of different populations at all fluxlevels. spectroscopic classification of radio sources with x-ray emission hasallowed us to estimate that the fraction of radio-quiet agn at 30 &lt;~ s(1.4ghz)&lt; 300ujy is roughly 25 +/- 10%, suggesting that star-forming galaxies dominatethe sub-mjy regime.

0907.0003	bright lyman-alpha emitters at z~9: constraints on the luminosity  function from hizels	new results are presented, as part of the hi-z emission line survey (hizels),from the largest area survey to date (1.4 sq.deg) for lyman-alpha emitters(laes) at z~9. the survey, which is primarily targeting h-alpha emitters atz&lt;3, uses the wide field camera on the united kingdom infrared telescope and acustom narrow-band filter in the j band and reaches a lyman-alpha luminositylimit of ~10^43.8 erg/s over a co-moving volume of 1.12x10^6 mpc^3 atz=8.96+-0.06. only 2 candidates were found out of 1517 line emitters and thosewere rejected as laes after follow-up observations. the limit on the spacedensity of bright laes is improved by 3 orders of magnitude, consistent withsuppression of the bright end of the lyman-alpha luminosity function beyondz~6. combined with upper limits from smaller but deeper surveys, this rules outsome of the most extreme models for high-redshift laes. the potentialcontamination of future narrow-band lyman-alpha surveys at z&gt;7 by galacticbrown dwarf stars is also examined, leading to the conclusion that suchcontamination may well be significant for searches at 7.7&lt;z&lt;8.0, 9.1&lt;z&lt;9.5 and11.7 &lt; z &lt; 12.2.

0911.1954	deep multi-frequency radio imaging in the lockman hole using the gmrt  and vla: ii. the spectral index of submillimetre galaxies	we have employed the gmrt and the vla to map the lockman hole. at 610 and1,400 mhz, we reach noise levels of 15 and 6 ujy/beam, respectively, withwell-matched resolutions (~5"). at this depth we obtained reliable detectionsfor about half of the known submm galaxies (smgs) in the field. forradio-identified smgs, which are typically at z ~ 2, we measure a mean radiospectral index of alpha = -0.75 +/- 0.06 and standard deviation of 0.29,between rest-frame ~1.8 and ~4.2 ghz. the slope of their continuum emission isindistinguishable from that of local star-forming galaxies and suggests thatextended optically-thin synchrotron emission dominates the radio output ofsmgs. cooling effects by synchrotron emission and inverse compton scatteringoff the cmb do not seem to affect their radio seds. for those smgs judged byspitzer mid-ir colours and spectroscopy to host obscured agn, we find a cleardeviation from the rest of the sample - they typically have steeper radiospectral indices, alpha ~&lt; -1.0. these findings suggest thesemid-ir-/agn-selected smgs may have an intrinsically different injectionmechanism for relativistic particles, or they might reside in denserenvironments. this work provides a reliable spectral template for theestimation of far-ir/radio photometric redshifts, and will enable accuratestatistical k-corrections for the large samples of smgs expected with scuba-2and herschel.

1005.5176	a near-infrared morphological comparison of high-redshift submm and  radio galaxies: massive star-forming discs vs relaxed spheroids	we present deep, high-quality k-band images of complete subsamples ofpowerful radio and sub-mm galaxies at z=2. the data were obtained in the bestavailable seeing at ukirt and gemini north, with integration times scaled toensure that comparable rest-frame surface brightness levels are reached for allgalaxies. we fit two-dimensional axi-symmetric galaxy models to determinegalaxy morphologies at rest-frame optical wavelengths &gt; 4000a, varyingluminosity, axial ratio, half-light radius, and sersic index. we find that,while some images show evidence of galaxy interactions, &gt;95% of the rest-frameoptical light in all galaxies is well-described by these simple models. we alsofind a clear difference in morphology between these two classes of galaxy; fitsto the individual images and image stacks reveal that the radio galaxies aremoderately large (&lt;r{1/2}&gt;=8.4+-1.1kpc; median r{1/2}=7.8), de vaucouleursspheroids (&lt;n&gt; = 4.07+-0.27; median n=3.87), while the sub-mm galaxies appearto be moderately compact (&lt;r{1/2}&gt;=3.4+-0.3kpc; median r{1/2}=3.1kpc)exponential discs (&lt;n&gt;=1.44+-0.16; median n=1.08). we show that the z=2 radiogalaxies display a well-defined kormendy relation but that, while larger thanother recently-studied high-z massive galaxy populations, they are still ~1.5times smaller than their local counterparts. the scalelengths of the starlightin the sub-mm galaxies are comparable to those reported for the molecular gas.their sizes are also similar to those of comparably massive quiescent galaxiesat z&gt;1.5. in terms of stellar mass surface density, the majority of the radiogalaxies lie within the locus defined by local ellipticals. in contrast, whilebest modelled as discs, most of the sub-mm galaxies have higher stellar massdensities than local galaxies, and appear destined to evolve into present-daymassive ellipticals.

1104.3608	an h-alpha search for over-dense regions at z=2.23	we present the results of a narrow-band (h2s1, 2.121/0.021um) imaging searchwith wfcam/ukirt for h-alpha emitters around several potential signposts ofrare (10^-7-10^-8 mpc^-3) over-dense regions at z=2.23: an over-density of qsos(2qz cluster), a powerful, high-redshift radio galaxy (hzrg), and aconcentration of submillimetre galaxies (smgs) and optically faint radiogalaxies (ofrgs). in total, we detect 137 narrow-band emitter candidates downto emission-line fluxes of 0.5-1 x 10^-16 erg s^-1 cm^-2, across a total areaof 0.56 sq. degrees (2.1 x 10^5 comoving mpc at z=2.23) in these fields. thebzk colours of the emitters suggest that at least 80% of our sample are likelyto be h-alpha emitters (haes) at z=2.23. this is one of the largest hae samplesknown at z&gt;2. we find modest (~3-sigma) local over-densities of emittersassociated with all the three targets. in the 2qz cluster field, the emittersshow a striking filamentary structure connecting four of the z=2.23 qsosextending over 30mpc (comoving). in the hzrg and smg/ofrg fields, thestructures appear to be smaller and seen only in the vicinities of the targets.the k-band magnitudes and the h-alpha equivalent widths of the emitters areweakly correlated with the over-density of the emitters: emitters in over-denseregion are more evolved systems compared to those in under-dense regions atz=2.23. we find several examples of extended haes in our target fields,including a striking example with a spatial extent of 7.5 arcsec (60 kpc atz=2.23) in the 2qz field, suggesting that these are relatively common inhigh-density regions. we conclude that narrow-band h-alpha surveys areefficient routes to map over-dense regions at high-z and thus to understand therelation between the growth of galaxies and their surrounding large-scalestructures.

1104.5020	the luminosity-dependent high-redshift turnover in the steep spectrum  radio luminosity function: clear evidence for downsizing in the radio-agn  population	this paper presents a new grid-based method for investigating the evolutionof the steep-spectrum radio luminosity function, with the aim of quantifyingthe high-redshift cut-off suggested by previous work. to achieve this, thecombined eis-nvss survey of radio sources (censors) has been developed; this isa 1.4 ghz radio survey, containing 135 sources complete to a flux density of7.2 mjy, selected from the nrao vla sky survey (nvss) over 6 deg^2 of the esoimaging survey (eis) patch d. the sample is currently 73% spectroscopicallycomplete, with the remaining redshifts estimated via the k-z or i-zmagnitude-redshift relation. censors is combined with additional radio datafrom the parkes all-sky, parkes selected regions, hercules and vla cosmossamples to provide comprehensive coverage of the radio power vs. redshiftplane. the redshift distributions of these samples, together with radio sourcecount determinations, and measurements of the local luminosity function,provide the input to the fitting process. the modelling reveals clear declines,at &gt; 3sigma significance, in comoving density at z &gt; 0.7 for lower luminositysources (log p = 25-26); these turnovers are still present at log p &gt; 27, butmove to z &gt; 3, suggesting a luminosity-dependent evolution of the redshiftturnover, similar to the `cosmic downsizing' seen for other agn populations.these results are shown to be robust to the estimated redshift errors and toincreases in the spectral index for the highest redshift sources. analytic fitsto the best-fitting steep spectrum grid are provided so that the resultspresented here can be easily accessed by the reader, as well as allowingplausible extrapolations outside of the regions covered by the input datasets

1107.1037	the na d profiles of nearby low-power radio sources: jets powering  outflows	(abridged) we have analyzed the properties of the na d doublet lines in alarge sample of 691 radio galaxies using the sloan digital sky survey (sdss).these radio galaxies are resolved in the first survey, have redshifts less that0.2 and radio flux densities at 1.4 ghz higher than 40 mjy. approximately 1/3of the sources show a significant excess (above that contributed by theirstellar populations) of na d absorption that can be robustly fitted with twovoigt profiles representing the na d doublet. a further 1/6 of the sources showresidual absorption, for which the fits were not well constrained though while~50% of the sample show no significant residual absorption. the residualabsorption is modestly blueshifted, typically by ~50 km/s, but the velocitydispersions are high, generally ~500 km/s. assuming that the size of theabsorbing region is consistent with ~1 kpc for dust lanes in a sample ofgenerally more powerful radio sources and a continuous constant velocity flow(continuity equation), we estimate mass and energy outflow rates of about 10msun/yr and few x e42 erg/s. these rates are consistent with those in theliterature based on hi absorption line observations of radio galaxies. theenergy required to power these outflows is on the order of 1-10% of the jetmechanical power and we conclude that the radio jet alone is sufficient. themass and energy outflow rates are consistent with what is needed to heat/expelthe mass returned by the stellar populations as well as the likely amount ofgas from a cooling halo. this suggests that radio-loud agn play a key role inenergizing the outflow/heating phase of the feedback cycle. the deposition ofthe jet mechanical energy could be important for explaining the ensemblecharacteristics of massive early type galaxies in the local universe.

1111.5244	new insights on the z-alpha correlation from complete radio samples	the existence of a correlation between observed radio spectral index (alpha)and redshift (z) has long been used as a method for locating high-z radiogalaxies. we use 9 highly spectroscopically complete radio samples, selected atdifferent frequencies and flux limits, to determine the efficiency of thismethod, and compare consistently observed correlations between alpha,luminosity, linear size, and redshift. we observe a weak correlation between zand alpha which remains even when malmquist bias is removed. the strength ofthis correlation depends on both the k-correction and sample selectionfrequency, in addition to the frequency at which alpha is measured, andconsistent results for both high and low frequency selected samples are onlyseen if analysis is restricted to just extended radio galaxies. many of thehighest redshift radio galaxies are very compact and often display a negativelycurved or peaked spectrum, and therefore the low-frequency radio spectrum as awhole should be studied; this is something for which the lofar will be crucial.we quantify both the efficiency and the completeness of various techniques usedto select high-z radio galaxies. a steep-spectrum cut applied to low-frequencyselected samples can more than double the fraction of high-z sources, but at acost of excluding over half of the high-z sources present in the originalsample. an angular size cut is an almost as equally effective method as asteep-spectrum cut, and works for both high and low frequency selected samples.in multi-wavelength data, selection first of infrared-faint radio sourcesremains by far the most efficient method of selecting high-z sources. wepresent a simple method for selecting high-z radio galaxies, based purely oncombining their radio properties of alpha and angular size, with the additionof the k-band magnitude if available.[abridged]

1201.2397	on the fundamental dichotomy in the local radio-agn population:  accretion, evolution, and host galaxy properties	a sample of 18286 radio-loud agn is presented, constructed by combining thesdss dr7 with the nvss and first radio surveys. using this sample, thedifferences between `high-excitation' (or `quasar-mode'; herg) and`low-excitation' (`radio-mode'; lerg) radio galaxies are investigated. aprimary difference is the distinct nature of the eddington-scaled accretionrate onto their central black holes: hergs typically have accretion ratesbetween 1 and 10% of eddington, whereas lergs predominatly accrete at a ratebelow 1% eddington. this is consistent with models where the populationdichotomy is caused by a switch between radiatively efficient and inefficientaccretion modes at low accretion rates. local radio luminosity functions arederived separately for the two populations, showing that although lergsdominate at low luminosity and hergs above 1e26 w/hz, examples of both classesare found at all radio luminosities. using the v/vmax test it is shown that thepopulations show differential cosmic evolution at fixed radio luminosity: hergsevolve strongly at all luminosities, while lergs show weak or no evolution.this suggests that the luminosity-dependent evolution of the radio luminosityfunction is driven, at least in part, by the changing relative contributions ofthese two populations with luminosity. the host galaxies of the sources arealso distinct: hergs are typically of lower stellar mass, with lower black holemasses, bluer colours and weaker 4000-ang breaks indicating younger stellarpopulations. these results offer strong support to the picture in which hergsare fuelled at high rates through radiative accretion disks by cold gas,perhaps from mergers and interactions, while lergs are fuelled via radiativelyinefficient flows at low accretion rates, often by gas associated with the hotx-ray haloes of their host galaxy/cluster, as part of a radio-agn feedback loop(abridged).

1206.0578	the triggering probability of radio-loud agn: a comparison of high and  low excitation radio galaxies in hosts of different colors	low luminosity radio-loud active galactic nuclei (agn) are generally found inmassive red elliptical galaxies, where they are thought to be powered throughgas accretion from their surrounding hot halos in a radiatively inefficientmanner. these agn are often referred to as "low-excitation" radio galaxies(lergs). when radio-loud agn are found in galaxies with a young stellarpopulation and active star formation, they are usually high-powerradiatively-efficient radio agn ("high-excitation", herg). using a sample oflow-redshift radio galaxies identified within the sloan digital sky survey(sdss), we determine the fraction of galaxies that host a radio-loud agn,$f_{rl}$, as a function of host galaxy stellar mass, $m_*$, star formationrate, color (defined by the 4000 $\angstrom$ break strength), radio luminosityand excitation state (herg/lerg).  we find the following: 1. lergs are predominantly found in red galaxies. 2.the radio-loud agn fraction of lergs hosted by galaxies of any color follows a$f^{le}_{rl} \propto m^{2.5}_*$ power law. 3. the fraction of red galaxieshosting a lerg decreases strongly for increasing radio luminosity. for massiveblue galaxies this is not the case. 4. the fraction of green galaxies hosting alerg is lower than that of either red or blue galaxies, at all radioluminosities. 5. the radio-loud agn fraction of hergs hosted by galaxies of anycolor follows a $f^{he}_{rl} \propto m^{1.5}_*$ power law. 6. hergs have astrong preference to be hosted by green or blue galaxies. 7. the fraction ofgalaxies hosting a herg shows only a weak dependence on radio luminosity cut.8. for both hergs and lergs, the hosting probability of blue galaxies shows astrong dependence on star formation rate. this is not observed in galaxies of adifferent color.[abridged]

1206.4052	the clustering of h-alpha emitters at z=2.23 from hizels	(abridged) we present a clustering analysis of 370 high-confidence h-alphaemitters (haes) at z=2.23. the haes are detected in the hi-z emission linesurvey (hizels), a large-area blank field 2.121um narrowband survey using theunited kingdom infrared telescope (ukirt) wide field camera (wfcam). averagingthe two-point correlation function of haes in two ~1 degree scale fields(united kingdom infrared deep sky survey/ultra deep survey [uds] andcosmological evolution survey [cosmos] fields) we find a clustering amplitudeequivalent to a correlation length of r_0=3.7+/-0.3 mpc/h for galaxies withstar formation rates of &gt;7 m_sun/yr. the data are well-fitted by the expectedcorrelation function of cold dark matter, scaled by a bias factor:omega_hae=b^2 omega_dm where b=2.4^{+0.1}_{-0.2}. the corresponding'characteristic' mass for the halos hosting haes islog(m_h/[m_sun/h])=11.7+/-0.1. comparing to the latest semi-analytic galformpredictions for the evolution of haes in a lcdm cosmology, we find broadagreement with the observations, with galform predicting a hae correlationlength of ~4 mpc/h. motivated by this agreement, we exploit the simulations toconstruct a parametric model of the halo occupation distribution (hod) of haes,and use this to fit the observed clustering. our best-fitting hod canadequately reproduce the observed angular clustering of haes, yielding aneffective halo mass and bias in agreement with that derived from the scaledomega_dm fit, but with the relatively small sample size the current dataprovide a poor constraint on the hod. our results support the broad picturethat 'typical' (~l*) star-forming galaxies have been hosted by dark matterhaloes with m_h&lt;10^12 m_sun/h since z~2, but with a broad occupationdistribution and clustering that is likely to be a strong function ofluminosity.

0711.2839	radio loud agn and the l_x - \sigma relation of galaxy groups and  clusters	we use the rosat all-sky survey to study the x-ray properties of a sample of625 groups and clusters of galaxies selected from the sloan digital sky survey.we stack clusters with similar velocity dispersions and investigate whethertheir average x-ray luminosities and surface brightness profiles vary with theradio activity level of their central galaxies. we find that at a given valueof $\sigma$, clusters with a central radio agn have more concentrated x-raysurface brightness profiles, larger central galaxy masses, and higher x-rayluminosities than clusters with radio-quiet central galaxies. the enhancementin x-ray luminosity is more than a factor of two, is detected with better than6$\sigma$ significance, and cannot be explained by x-ray emission from theradio agn itself. this difference is largely due to a subpopulation ofradio-quiet, high velocity dispersion clusters with low mass central galaxies.these clusters are underluminous at x-ray wavelengths when compared tootherwise similar clusters where the central galaxy is radio-loud, moremassive, or both.

1212.4836	effect of the interactions and environment on nuclear activity	we present a study of the prevalence of optical and radio nuclear activitywith respect to the environment and interactions in a sample of sdss galaxies.we defined a local density parameter and a tidal forces estimator and used acluster richness estimator from the literature. the possible correlationsbetween these parameters were removed using a principal component analysis. weapplied a stratified statistical method that takes into account the effect ofpossible confounding factors like the galaxy mass. we found that the prevalenceof optical agn is a factor 2-3 lower in the densest environments, but increasesby a factor of ~2 in the presence of strong one-on-one interactions. theimportance of galaxy interactions decreases from star-forming nuclei (sfn) toseyferts to liners to passive galaxies, in accordance with previous suggestionsof an evolutionary time-sequence. the fraction of radio agn increases stronglytowards denser environments, and is enhanced by galaxy interactions. overall,the results agree with a scenario in which the mechanisms of accretion into theblack hole are determined by the presence and nature of a supply of gas, whichin turn is controlled by the local density of galaxies and their interactions.a plentiful cold gas supply is required to trigger sfn, optical agn andradiatively-efficient radio agn. this is less common in the cold-gas-poorenvironments of groups and clusters, but is enhanced by one-on-one interactionswhich result in the flow of gas into nuclear regions; these two factors competeagainst each other. in the denser environments where cold gas is rare, coolinghot gas can supply the nucleus at a sufficient rate to fuel low-luminosityradiatively-inefficient radio agn. however, the increased prevalence of theseagn in interacting galaxies suggests that this is not the only mechanism bywhich radiatively-inefficient agn can be triggered.

1301.3922	concurrent supermassive black hole and galaxy growth: linking  environment and nuclear activity in z = 2.23 h-alpha emitters	we present results from a ~100 ks chandra observation of the 2qz cluster1004+00 structure at z = 2.23 (hereafter, 2qz clus). 2qz clus was originallyidentified as an overdensity of four optically-selected qsos at z = 2.23 withina 15x15 arcmin^2 region. narrow-band imaging in the near-ir revealed that thestructure contains an additional overdensity of 22 z = 2.23 halpha-emittinggalaxies (haes), resulting in 23 unique z = 2.23 haes/qsos. our chandraobservations reveal that 3 haes in addition to the 4 qsos harbor powerfullyaccreting supermassive black holes (smbhs), with 2-10 kev luminosities of~(8-60) x 10^43 ergs/s and x-ray spectral slopes consistent with unobscuredagn. using a large comparison sample of 210 haes in chandra-cosmos (c-cosmos),we find suggestive evidence that the agn fraction increases with local haegalaxy density. the 2qz clus haes reside in a moderately overdense environment(a factor of ~2 times over the field), and after excluding optically-selectedqsos, we find the agn fraction is a factor of ~3.5^+3.8_-2.2 times higher thanc-cosmos haes in similar environments. using stacking analyses of the chandradata and herschel spire observations at 250 um, we respectively estimate meansmbh accretion rates (mdot) and star-formation rates (sfrs) for the 2qz clusand c-cosmos samples. we find that the mean 2qz clus hae stacked 2-10 kevluminosity is qso-like (~6-10 x 10^43 ergs/s), and the implied mdot/sfr \sim(1.6-3.2) x10^-3 is broadly consistent with the local mbh/m* relation and z ~ 2x-ray selected agn. the c-cosmos haes are on average an order of magnitude lessx-ray luminous and have mdot/sfr \sim (0.2-0.4) x10^-3, comparable to z ~ 1-2star-forming galaxies with similar mean x-ray luminosities. we estimate that aperiodic qso phase with duty cycle ~2-8% would be sufficient to bring thestar-forming galaxies onto the local mbh/m* relation.

1307.3556	herschel reveals the obscured star formation in hizels h\alpha\ emitters  at z=1.47	we describe the far-infrared (fir; rest-frame 8--1000\mu m) properties of asample of 443 h\alpha-selected star-forming galaxies in the cosmos and udsfields detected by the hizels imaging survey. sources are identified usingnarrow-band filters in combination with broad-band photometry to uniformlyselect h\alpha\ (and [oii] if available) emitters in a narrow redshift slice atz = 1.47+/-0.02. we use a stacking approach in spitzer, herschel (from pep andhermes surveys) and aztec images to describe their typical fir properties. wefind that hizels galaxies with observed h\alpha\ luminosities of ~ 10^{8.1-9.1}lo have bolometric fir luminosities of typical lirgs, l_fir ~ 10^{11.48+/-0.05}lo. combining the h\alpha\ and fir luminosities, we derive median sfr = 32+/-5mo/yr and h\alpha\ extinctions of a(h\alpha) = 1.0+/-0.2 mag. perhapssurprisingly, little difference is seen in typical hizels extinction levelscompared to local star-forming galaxies. we confirm previous empirical stellarmass (m*) to a(h\alpha) relations and the little or no evolution up to z =1.47. for hizels galaxies, we provide an empirical parametrisation of the sfras a function of (u-z)_rest colours and 3.6\mu m photometry. we find that theobserved h\alpha\ luminosity is a dominant sfr tracer when (u-z)_rest ~&lt; 0.9mag or when 3.6\mu m photometry &gt; 22 mag (vega) or when m* &lt; 10^9.7 mo. we donot find any correlation between the [oii]/h\alpha\ and fir luminosity,suggesting that this emission line ratio does not trace the extinction of themost obscured star-forming regions. the luminosity-limited hizels sample tendsto lie above of the so-called `main sequence' for star-forming galaxies,especially at low m*. this work suggests that obscured star formation is linkedto the assembly of m*, with deeper potential wells in massive galaxiesproviding dense, heavily obscured environments in which stars can form rapidly.

0802.1158	a combined eis-nvss survey of radio sources (censors) iii: spectroscopic  observations	the combined eis-nvss survey of radio sources (censors) is a 1.4ghz radiosurvey selected from the nrao vla sky survey (nvss) and complete to aflux-density of 7.2mjy. it targets the eso imaging survey (eis) patch d, whichis a 3 by 2 square degree field centred on 09 51 36.0, -21 00 00 (j2000). thispaper presents the results of spectroscopic observations of 143 of the 150censors sources. the primary motivation for these observations is to achievesufficient spectroscopic completeness so that the sample may be used toinvestigate the evolution of radio sources.  the observations result in secure spectroscopic redshifts for 63% of thesample and likely redshifts (based on a single emission line, for example) fora further 8%. following the identification of the quasars and star-forminggalaxies in the censors sample, estimated redshifts are calculated for theremainder of the sample via the k-z relation for radio galaxies. comparison ofthe redshift distribution of the censors radio sources to distributionspredicted by the various radio luminosity function evolution models of dunlop &amp;peacock 1990, results in no good match. this demonstrates that this sample canbe used to expand upon previous work in that field.

0802.1186	lofar-uk white paper: a science case for uk involvement in lofar	lofar, the low-frequency array, is a next-generation software-driven radiotelescope operating between 30 and 240mhz, currently under construction byastron in the netherlands. this low frequency radio band is one of the fewlargely unexplored regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. the sensitivity andangular resolution offered by lofar will be two to three orders of magnitudebetter than existing telescopes, and as such it will open up this new window onthe universe. lofar will impact on a broad range of astrophysics, fromcosmology to solar system studies.  there is growing european involvement in lofar, driven by the need to addstations far from the main core in order to improve angular resolution.lofar-uk is a project aimed at cementing uk participation in lofar via theoperation of four stations within the uk. lofar-uk ground stations will allowlofar observations to reach sub-arcsecond scales at the highest frequencies,and as a result will also improve the (confusion-limited) sensitivity limit ofthe telescope for deep surveys.  lofar-uk will achieve involvement for uk astronomers in a world-leadingscience facility operating in the immediate future. it will allow the uk tobuild up important scientific and technical expertise in `next generation'radio astronomy in preparation for the square kilometre array (ska), and willplay an important role in broadening the uk community that has an interest inradio astronomy. this white paper outlines the strategic importance to the ukastronomy community of gaining involvement in the lofar project, the scientificinterests of uk researchers in using the telescope, and the technicalchallenges that will need to be overcome [abridged].

1409.0263	the cosmic evolution of radio-agn feedback to z=1	this paper presents the first measurement of the radio luminosity function of'jet-mode' (radiatively-inefficient) radio-agn out to z=1, in order toinvestigate the cosmic evolution of radio-agn feedback. eight radio sourcesamples are combined to produce a catalogue of 211 radio-loud agn with0.5&lt;z&lt;1.0, which are spectroscopically classified into jet-mode andradiative-mode (radiatively-efficient) agn classes. comparing with largesamples of local radio-agn from the sloan digital sky survey, the cosmicevolution of the radio luminosity function of each radio-agn class isindependently derived. radiative-mode radio-agn show an order of magnitudeincrease in space density out to z~1 at all luminosities, consistent with theseagn being fuelled by cold gas. in contrast, the space density of jet-moderadio-agn decreases with increasing redshift at low radio luminosities (l_1.4 &lt;1e24 w/hz) but increases at higher radio luminosities. simple models aredeveloped to explain the observed evolution. in the best-fitting models, thecharacteristic space density of jet-mode agn declines with redshift inaccordance with the declining space density of massive quiescent galaxies,which fuel them via cooling of gas in their hot haloes. a time delay of 1.5-2gyr may be present between the quenching of star formation and the onset ofjet-mode radio-agn activity. the behaviour at higher radio luminosities can beexplained either by an increasing characteristic luminosity of jet-moderadio-agn activity with redshift (roughly as (1+z) cubed) or if the jet-moderadio-agn population also includes some contribution of cold-gas-fuelledsources seen at a time when their accretion rate was low. higher redshiftsmeasurements would distinguish between these possibilities.

1504.06642	the peculiar radio galaxy 4c 35.06: a case for recurrent agn activity?	using observations obtained with the low fequency array (lofar), thewesterbork synthesis radio telescope (wsrt) and archival very large array (vla)data, we have traced the radio emission to large scales in the complex source4c 35.06 located in the core of the galaxy cluster abell 407. at higher spatialresolution (~4"), the source was known to have two inner radio lobes spanning31 kpc and a diffuse, low-brightness extension running parallel to them, offsetby about 11 kpc (in projection).  at 62 mhz, we detect the radio emission of this structure extending out to210 kpc. at 1.4 ghz and intermediate spatial resolution (~30"), the structureappears to have a helical morphology.  we have derived the characteristics of the radio spectral index across thesource. we show that the source morphology is most likely the result of atleast two episodes of agn activity separated by a dormant period of around 35myr.  the agn is hosted by one of the galaxies located in the cluster core of abell407. we propose that it is intermittently active as it moves in the denseenvironment in the cluster core. using lofar, we can trace the relic plasmafrom that episode of activity out to greater distances from the core than everbefore.  using the the wsrt, we detect hi in absorption against the center of theradio source. the absorption profile is relatively broad (fwhm of 288 km/s),similar to what is found in other clusters.  understanding the duty cycle of the radio emission as well as the triggeringmechanism for starting (or restarting) the radio-loud activity can provideimportant constraints to quantify the impact of agn feedback on galaxyevolution. the study of these mechanisms at low frequencies using morphologicaland spectral information promises to bring new important insights in thisfield.

1506.02670	on the nature of h$\alpha$ emitters at $z \sim 2$ from the hizels  survey: physical properties, ly$\alpha$ escape fraction, and main sequence	we present a detailed multi-wavelength study (from rest-frame uv to far-ir)of narrow-band (nb) selected, star-forming (sf) h$\alpha$ emitters (haes) at $z\sim 2.23$ taken from the high redshift(z) emission line survey (hizels). wefind that haes have similar sed-derived properties and colors to $sbzk$galaxies and probe a well-defined portion of the sf population at $z \sim 2$.this is not true for ly$\alpha$ emitters (laes), which are strongly biasedtowards blue, less massive galaxies (missing a significant percentage of the sfpopulation). combining our h$\alpha$ observations with matched, existingly$\alpha$ data we determine that the ly$\alpha$ escape fraction ($f_{\rmesc}$) is low (only $\sim$ 4.5\% of haes show ly$\alpha$ emission) anddecreases with increasing dust attenuation, uv continuum slope, stellar mass,and star formation rate (sfr). this suggests that ly$\alpha$ preferentiallyescapes from blue galaxies with low dust attenuation. however, a smallpopulation of red and massive laes is also present in agreement with previousworks. this indicates that dust and ly$\alpha$ are not mutually exclusive.using different and completely independent measures of the total sfr we showthat the h$\alpha$ emission is an excellent tracer of star formation at $z \sim2$ with deviations typically lower than 0.3 dex for individual galaxies. wefind that the slope and zero-point of the hae main-sequence (ms) at $z \sim 2$strongly depend on the dust correction method used to recover sfr, althoughthey are consistent with previous works when similar assumptions are made.

1507.00341	cosmic downsizing of powerful radio galaxies to low radio luminosities	at bright radio powers ($p_{\rm 1.4 ghz} &gt; 10^{25}$ w/hz) the space densityof the most powerful sources peaks at higher redshift than that of their weakercounterparts. this paper establishes whether this luminosity-dependentevolution persists for sources an order of magnitude fainter than thosepreviously studied, by measuring the steep--spectrum radio luminosity function(rlf) across the range $10^{24} &lt; p_{\rm 1.4 ghz} &lt; 10^{28}$ w/hz, out to highredshift. a grid-based modelling method is used, in which no assumptions aremade about the rlf shape and high-redshift behaviour. the inputs to the modelare the same as in rigby et al. (2011): redshift distributions from radiosource samples, together with source counts and determinations of the localluminosity function. however, to improve coverage of the radio power vs.redshift plane at the lowest radio powers, a new faint radio sample isintroduced. this covers 0.8 sq. deg., in the subaru/xmm-newton deep field, to a1.4 ghz flux density limit of $s_{\rm 1.4 ghz} \geq 100~\mu$jy, with 99%redshift completeness. the modelling results show that the previously seenhigh-redshift declines in space density persist to $p_{\rm 1.4 ghz} &lt; 10^{25}$w/hz. at $p_{\rm 1.4 ghz} &gt; 10^{26}$ w/hz the redshift of the peak spacedensity increases with luminosity, whilst at lower radio luminosities theposition of the peak remains constant within the uncertainties. this `cosmicdownsizing' behaviour is found to be similar to that seen at opticalwavelengths for quasars, and is interpreted as representing the transition fromradiatively efficient to inefficient accretion modes in the steep-spectrumpopulation. this conclusion is supported by constructing simple models for thespace density evolution of these two different radio galaxy classes; these areable to successfully reproduce the observed variation in peak redshift.

0805.2861	hizels: a high redshift survey of h-alpha emitters. i: the cosmic  star-formation rate and clustering at z=2.23	we present results from a near-infrared narrow-band survey of emission-linegalaxies at z=2.23, using the wide field camera on the united kingdom infraredtelescope. the h2s1 narrow-band filter (lambda_c=2.121um) we employ selects theh-alpha emission line redshifted to z=2.23, and is thus suitable for selecting'typical' star forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei at this epoch. thepilot study was undertaken in the well studied cosmological evolution surveyfield (cosmos) and is already the largest near-infrared narrow-band survey atthis depth, with a line flux limit of f(h-alpha)~10^-16 erg/s/cm^2 over 0.60square degrees, probing ~220x10^3 mpc^3 (co-moving) down to a limiting starformation rate of 30 m_sun/yr (3sigma). in this paper we present the resultsfrom our pilot survey and evaluate the h-alpha luminosity function and estimatethe clustering properties of h-alpha emitters at z=2.23 from 55 detectedgalaxies. the integrated luminosity function is used to estimate the volumeaveraged star formation rate at z=2.23: sfrd = 0.17^{+0.16}_{-0.09}m_sun/yr/mpc^3 for l(h-alpha) &gt; 10^42 erg/s. for the first time, we use theh-alpha star-formation tracer to reliably constrain sfrd out to z=2.23demonstrating the rapid increase in srfd out to this redshift as well asconfirming the flattening in sfrd between z~1-2. in addition to the luminositydistribution, we analyse the clustering properties of these galaxies. using the2-point angular correlation function, we estimate a real space correlationlength of r_0= 4.2^{+0.4}_{-0.2} h^-1 mpc. in comparison to models ofclustering which take into account bias evolution, we estimate that thesegalaxies are hosted by dark matter halos of mass m_halo ~ 10^12 m_sunconsistent with the progenitors of the milky way.

1508.07239	lofar discovery of a 700-kpc remnant radio galaxy at low redshift	remnant radio galaxies represent the final dying phase of radio galaxyevolution, in which the jets are no longer active. due to their rarity in fluxlimited samples and the difficulty of identification, this dying phase remainspoorly understood and the luminosity evolution largely unconstrained. here wepresent the discovery and detailed analysis of a large (700 kpc) remnant radiogalaxy with a low surface brightness that has been identified in lofar imagesat 150 mhz. by combining lofar data with new follow-up westerbork observationsand archival data at higher frequencies, we investigated the source morphologyand spectral properties from 116 to 4850 mhz. by modelling the radio spectrumwe probed characteristic timescales of the radio activity. the source has arelatively smooth, diffuse, amorphous appearance together with a very weakcentral compact core which is associated with the host galaxy located atz=0.051. from our ageing and morphological analysis it is clear that thenuclear engine is currently switched off or, at most, active at a very lowpower state. the host galaxy is currently interacting with another galaxylocated at a projected separation of 15 kpc and a radial velocity offset of 300km/s. this interaction may have played a role in the triggering and/or shutdown of the radio jets. the spectral shape of this remnant radio galaxy differsfrom the majority of the previously identified remnant sources, which showsteep or curved spectra at low to intermediate frequencies. in light of thisfinding and in preparation for new-generation deep low-frequency surveys, wediscuss the selection criteria to be used to select representative samples ofthese sources.

[oii]/h-beta is shown to be auseful ionization mechanism diagnostic. statistical analysis of the data showsthat the ionization state of the emission line gas is strongly correlated withradio power, once the effects of other parameters are removed. no dependence ofionization state on z is observed, implying that the ionization state of theemission line gas is solely a function of the agn properties rather than thehostt galaxy and/or environment. statistical analysis of the kinematicproperties of the emission line gas shows that these are strongly correlatedindependently withh both p and z. the correlation with redshift is the strongerof the two, suggesting that host galaxy composition or environment may play arole in producing the less extreme gas kinematics observed in the emission lineregions of low redshift galaxies. for both the ionization and kinematicproperties of thee galaxies, the independent correlations observed with radiosize are strongest. radio source age is a determining factor for the extendedemission line regions.

(ii) weaker large-scale excesses extending out to between 1and 1.5 mpc radius. the presence or absence of galaxy excesses on these twoscales, however, differs greatly between the six different fields. theimplications of these results for both cluster formation and the nature of highredshift agn are discussed (abridged).

astro-ph;0402523	the environmental dependence of radio-loud agn activity and star  formation in the 2dfgrs	by combining the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey with the nrao vla skysurvey at 1.4 ghz, the environments of radio loud agn in the nearby universeare investigated using both local projected galaxy densities and afriends-of-friends group finding algorithm. radio-loud agn are preferentiallylocated in galaxy groups and poor-to-moderate richness galaxy clusters. the agnfraction appears to depend more strongly on the large-scale environment (group,cluster, etc) in which a galaxy is located than on its more local environment,except at the lowest galaxy surface densities where practically no radio-loudagn are found. the ratio of absorption-line to emission-line agn changesdramatically with environment, with essentially all radio-loud agn in richenvironments showing no emission lines. this result could be connected with thelack of cool gas in cluster galaxies, and may have important consequences foranalyses of optically-selected agn, which are invariably selected on emissionline properties. the local galaxy surface density of the absorption-line agn isstrongly correlated with radio luminosity, implying that the radio luminositiesmay be significantly boosted in dense environments due to confinement by thehot intracluster gas.  the environments of a radio-selected sample of star forming galaxies are alsoinvestigated to provide an independent test of optical studies. in line withthose studies, the fraction of star forming galaxies is found to decreasestrongly with increasing local galaxy surface density; this correlation extendsacross the whole range of galaxy surface densities, with no evidence for thedensity threshold found in some optical studies.

astro-ph;0403679	the search for agn in distant galaxy clusters	we are undertaking the first systematic study of the prevalence of agnactivity in a large sample of high redshift galaxy clusters. local clusterscontain mainly red elliptical galaxies, and have little or no luminous agnactivity. however, recent studies of some moderate to high redshift clustershave revealed significant numbers of luminous agn within the cluster. thiseffect may parallel the butcher-oemler effect - the increase in the fraction ofblue galaxies in distant clusters compared to local clusters. our aim is toverify and quantify recent evidence that agn activity in dense environmentsincreases with redshift, and to evaluate the significance of this effect. ascluster agn are far less prevalent than field sources, a large sample of over120 cluster fields at z &gt; 0.1 has been selected from the chandra archives andis being analysed for excess point sources. the size of the excess, the radialdistribution and flux of the sources and the dependence of these on clusterredshift and luminosity will reveal important information about the triggeringand fueling of agn.

astro-ph;0506268	a sample of radio-loud agn in the sloan digital sky survey	a sample of 2712 radio-luminous galaxies is defined from the second datarelease of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) by cross-comparing the mainspectroscopic galaxy sample with two radio surveys: the nrao vla sky survey(nvss) and the faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimetres (first)survey. the comparison is carried out in a multi-stage process and makesoptimal use of both radio surveys by exploiting the sensitivity of the nvss toextended and multi-component radio sources in addition to the high angularresolution of the first images. a radio source sample with 95% completeness and98.9% reliability is achieved, far better than would be possible for thissample if only one of the surveys was used. the radio source sample is thendivided into two classes: radio-loud agn and galaxies in which the radioemission is dominated by star formation. the division is based on the locationof a galaxy in the plane of 4000ang break strength versus radio luminosity perunit stellar mass and provides a sample of 2215 radio-loud agn and 497 starforming galaxies brighter than 5mjy at 1.4ghz. a full catalogue of positionsand radio properties is provided for these sources. the local radio luminosityfunction is then derived both for radio-loud agn and for star-forming galaxiesand is found to be in agreement with previous studies. by using the radio tofar-ir correlation, the radio luminosity function of star forming galaxies isalso compared to the luminosity function derived in the far-infrared. it isfound to agree well at high luminosities but less so at lower luminosities,confirming that the linearity of the radio to far-ir correlation breaks downbelow about 10^22 w/hz at 1.4ghz.

astro-ph;0506269	the host galaxies of radio-loud agn: mass dependencies, gas cooling and  agn feedback	the properties of the host galaxies of a well-defined sample of 2215radio-loud agn with redshifts 0.03 &lt; z &lt; 0.3, defined from the sdss, areinvestigated. these are predominantly low radio luminosity sources, with 1.4ghzluminosities of 10^23 to 10^25 w/hz. the fraction of galaxies that hostradio-loud agn with l(1.4ghz) &gt; 10^23 w/hz is a strong function of stellarmass, rising from nearly zero below a stellar mass of 10^10 msun to more than30% at 5x10^11 msun. the integral radio luminosity function is derived in sixranges of stellar and black hole mass. its shape is very similar in all ofthese ranges and can be well fitted by a broken power-law. its normalisationvaries strongly with mass, as m_*^2.5 or m_bh^1.6; this scaling only begins tobreak down when the predicted radio-loud fraction exceeds 20-30%. there is nocorrelation between radio and emission line luminosities for the radio-loud agnin the sample and the probability that a galaxy of given mass is radio-loud isindependent of whether it is optically classified as an agn. the host galaxiesof the radio-loud agn have properties similar to those of ordinary galaxies ofthe same mass.  all of these findings support the conclusion that the optical agn and lowradio luminosity agn phenomena are independent and are triggered by differentphysical mechanisms. intriguingly, the dependence on black hole mass of theradio-loud agn fraction mirrors that of the rate at which gas cools from thehot atmospheres of elliptical galaxies. it is speculated that gas coolingprovides a natural explanation for the origin of the radio-loud agn activity,and it is argued that agn heating could plausibly balance the cooling of thegas over time.

astro-ph;0512658	deviations from passive evolution - star formation and the uv excess in  z~1 radio galaxies	galaxy colours are determined for two samples of 6c and 3cr radio sources atz~1, differing by a factor of ~6 in radio power. corrections are made foremission line contamination and the presence of any nuclear point source, andthe data analysed as a function of both redshift and the radio sourceproperties. the galaxy colours are remarkably similar for the two populations,and the uv excess evolves with radio source size similarly in both samples,depsite the fact that the alignment effect is more extensive for the morepowerful 3cr radio galaxies. these results seem to suggest that the alignmenteffect at these redshifts does not scale strongly with radio power, and isinstead more closely dependent on galaxy mass (which is statisticallycomparable for the two samples). however, it is likely that the presence ofrelatively young (&lt; several 10^8 years old) stellar populations hasconsiderably contaminated the k-band flux of these systems, particularly in thecase of the more powerful 3cr sources, which are ~0.5mag more luminous than thepredictions of passive evolution models at z~1. the higher luminosity of the3cr alignment effect is balanced by emission at longer wavelengths, therebyleading to comparable colours for the two samples.

astro-ph;0602171	agn-controlled cooling in elliptical galaxies	a long-standing problem for models of galaxy formation has been the mismatchbetween the predicted shape of the mass function of dark matter halos and theobserved shape of the luminosity function of galaxies. the number of massivehalos is predicted to decrease as a power law (n proportional to m^-2) out tovery large masses, while the galaxy luminosity function cuts off exponentiallyat luminosities above l*. this implies that the efficiency with which gas coolsonto massive systems is lower than expected. this letter investigates the roleof radio-loud active galactic nuclei (agn) in continually re-heating thecooling gas. by combining two observational results, the time-averaged energyoutput associated with recurrent radio source activity is determined, as afunction of the black hole mass of the host galaxy: h = 10^21.4 (m_bh /m_sun)^1.6 w. it is shown that for massive elliptical galaxies thisradio-source heating balances the radiative energy losses from the hot gassurrounding the galaxy. the recurrent radio-loud agn activity may thereforeprovide a self-regulating feedback mechanism capable of controlling the rate ofgrowth of galaxies.

astro-ph;0603655	a combined eis-nvss survey of radio sources ii: infrared imaging and the  k-z relation	the combined eis-nvss survey of radio sources (censors) is a 1.4 ghz radiosurvey selected from the nrao vla sky survey (nvss) and complete to aflux-density of 7.2mjy. it targets the eso imaging survey (eis) patch d, whichis a 3 by 2 square degree field centred on 09 51 36.0 -21 00 00 (j2000). thispaper presents k-band imaging of 142 of the 150 censors sources. the primarymotivation for beginning infrared imaging of the sample was to identify thehost galaxies of the ~30% of sources for which the eis i-band imaging failed toproduce a likely candidate. in addition, k-band magnitudes allow photometricredshift estimation and i - k colours aid the identification of host galaxies(which are typically old, red ellipticals). of the sources observed in the iand k-bands, four remain undetected, possibly indicating high redshifts for thehost galaxies, and eight involve complicated radio structures, or severalcandidate host galaxies, which have yet to be resolved. thus, the host galaxyidentifications are brought to 92% completeness.  in conjunction with spectroscopic observations, the k-band magnitudes havebeen aperture corrected and used to establish a k-z relation for the censorsradio galaxies. this relation is of interest because of its variation, at z &gt;1, between radio surveys of different flux-density limit. establishing thisrelation for censors may shed light on the origin of this variation and willallow an appropriate k-z redshift estimator for any censors source whichremains without a spectroscopic redshift. it is shown that whilst the k-zrelation for censors is fainter than that of 3crr at all redshifts, it agreeswell with that of 7c over all redshifts studied.

(2003) is also utilized, this scatter decreases to 0.1 mag. wedemonstrate that this dust content is indeed higher for galaxies detected byiras and that it can be used to "predict" measured iras 60 micron flux densitywithin a factor of two using only sdss data. we also show that the position ofa galaxy in the emission-line-based baldwin-phillips-terlevich diagram iscorrelated with the optical light concentration index and u-r color determinedfrom the sdss broad-band imaging data, and discuss changes in the morphology ofthis diagram induced by requiring detections at other wavelengths. we study their-radio correlation and find evidence that its slope may be different for agnand star-forming galaxies and related to the h_alpha/h_beta line strengthratio.

astro-ph;0611197	on the prevalence of radio-loud agn in brightest cluster galaxies:  implications for agn heating of cooling flows	(abridged) the prevalence of radio-loud agn activity in present-day massivehalos is determined using a sample of 625 nearby groups and clusters from thesdss. brightest group and cluster galaxies (bcgs) are more likely to host aradio-loud agn than other galaxies of the same stellar mass (by less than afactor of two at a stellar mass of 5e11 m_sun, but over an order of magnitudebelow 1e11 m_sun). the distribution of radio luminosities for bcgs does notdepend on stellar mass, however, and is similar to that of field galaxies ofthe same mass. neither the radio-loud fraction nor the radio luminositydistribution of bcgs depends strongly on the cluster velocity dispersion. theradio-agn fraction is also studied as a function of clustercentric distance:only within 0.2 r_200 do cluster galaxies exhibit an enhanced likelihood ofradio-loud agn activity, approaching that of the bcgs. the radio-loud agnproperties of both bcgs and non-bcgs can naturally be explained if thisactivity is fuelled by cooling from hot gas surrounding the galaxy. usingobservational estimates of the mechanical output of the radio jets, thetime-averaged energy output associated with recurrent radio source activity isestimated for all group/cluster galaxies. within the cooling radius of thecluster, the radio-mode heating from the bcg dominates over that of all othergalaxies combined. the scaling between total radio-agn energy output andcluster velocity dispersion is considerably shallower than the sigma^4 scalingof the radiative cooling rate. thus, unless either the mechanical-to-radioluminosity ratio or the efficiency of converting agn mechanical energy intoheating increases by 2-3 orders of magnitude between groups and rich clusters,radio-mode heating will not balance cooling in systems of all masses.

astro-ph;9908210	deep spectroscopy of distant 3cr radio galaxies: the data	deep long-slit spectroscopic data are presented for a sample of 14 3cr radiogalaxies at redshift z ~ 1, previously studied in detail using the hubble spacetelescope, the very large array, and ukirt. analysis of the [oii] 3727 emissionline structures at 5 ang spectral resolution is carried out to derive thekinematic properties of the emission line gas. in line with previous, lowerresolution, studies, a wide variety of kinematics are seen, from gas consistentwith a mean rotational motion through to complex structures with velocitydispersions exceeding 1000 kms. the data confirm the presence of a highvelocity gas component in 3c265 and detached emission line systems in 3c356 and3c441, and show for the first time that the emission line gas in the centralregions of 3c324 is composed of two kinematically distinct components. emissionline fluxes and the colour of the continuum emission are determined down tounprecedently low observed wavelengths, lambda &lt; 3500 ang, sufficiently shortthat any contribution of an evolved stellar population is negligible. anaccompanying paper investigates the variation in the emission line ratios andvelocity structures within the sample, and draws conclusions as to the originof the ionisation and kinematics of these galaxies.

astro-ph;9908211	ionisation, shocks and evolution of the emission line gas of distant 3cr  radio galaxies	an analysis of the kinematics and ionisation state of the emission line gasof a sample of 14 3cr radio galaxies with redshifts z~1 is carried out. thedata used for these studies, deep long--slit spectroscopic exposures from thewht, are presented in an accompanying paper. it is found that radio sourceswith small linear sizes (&lt;150 kpc) have lower ionisation states, higheremission line fluxes and broader line widths than larger radio sources. theemission line ratios of small radio sources are in agreement with theoreticalshock ionisation predictions and their velocity profiles are distorted.together with the other emission line properties this indicates that shocksassociated with the radio source dominate the kinematics and ionisation of theemission line gas during the period that the radio source is expanding throughthe ism. gas clouds are accelerated by the shocks, giving rise to the irregularvelocity structures observed, whilst shock compression of the clouds and thepresence of the ionising photons associated with the shocks combine to lowerthe ionisation state of the emission line gas. by contrast, in larger sourcesthe shock fronts have passed well beyond the emission line regions; theiremission line gas has much more settled kinematical properties, indicative ofrotation, and emission line ratios consistent with the dominant source ofionising photons being the active galactic nucleus.
