0902.4751	observational study of sites of triggered star formation: co and  mid-infrared observations	(abridged) bright-rimmed clouds (brcs) are isolated molecular clouds locatedon the edges of evolved hii regions where star formation is thought may havebeen triggered. in this paper we investigate the current level of starformation within a sample of brcs and evaluate to what extent star formationmay have been induced. we present the results of a programme ofposition-switched co observations towards 45 southern brcs. the 12co, 13co andc18o (j=1-0) were simultaneously observed using the 22m mopra telescope. wecomplement these observations with archival mid-ir submm and radio data.analysis of the co, mid-ir and radio data result in the clouds being dividedinto three distinct groups. we refer to these groups as spontaneous, triggered,and zapped clouds, respectively. comparing the physical parameters ofspontaneous and triggered samples we find striking differences in luminosity,surface temperature and column density with all three quantities significantlyenhanced for the clouds considered to have been triggered. furthermore, we findstrong evidence for star formation within the triggered sample by way ofmethanol and h_2o masers, embedded mid-ir point sources and co wings, however,we find evidence of ongoing star formation within only two of the spontaneoussample. we have used co, mid-ir and radio data to identify 24 of the 45southern brcs that are undergoing a strong interaction with their hii region.we can therefore exclude ~50% from future studies. 14 of the 24 interactingbrcs are found to be associated with embedded mid-ir point sources and we findstrong evidence of that these clouds are forming stars. the absence ofmid-infrared sources towards the remaining ten clouds leads us to conclude thatthese represent an earlier evolutionary stage of star formation.

0905.2564	accounting for the foreground contribution to the dust emission towards  kepler's supernova remnant	whether or not supernovae contribute significantly to the overall dust budgetis a controversial subject. submillimetre (submm) observations, sensitive tocold dust, have shown an excess at 450 and 850 microns in young remnantscassiopeia a (cas a) and kepler. some of the submm emission from cas a has beenshown to be contaminated by unrelated material along the line of sight. in thispaper we explore the emission from material towards kepler using submmcontinuum imaging and spectroscopic observations of atomic and molecular gas,via hi, 12co (j=2-1) and 13co (j=2-1). we detect weak co emission (peak ta* =0.2-1k, 1-2km/s fwhm) from diffuse, optically thin gas at the locations of someof the submm clumps. the contribution to the submm emission from foregroundmolecular and atomic clouds is negligible. the revised dust mass for kepler'sremnant is 0.1--1.2 solar masses, about half of the quoted values in theoriginal study by morgan et al. (2003), but still sufficient to explain theorigin of dust at high redshifts.

0907.5086	infrared dark cloud cores in the scuba legacy catalogue	we present an investigation of candidate infrared dark cloud cores asidentified by simon et al. (2006) located within the scuba legacy catalogue.after applying a uniform noise cut to the catalogue data we identify 154infrared dark cloud cores that were detected at 850um and 51 cores that werenot. we derive column densities for each core from their 8um extinction andfind that the irdcs detected at 850um have higher column densities (a mean of1.7x10^22 cm-2) compared to those cores not detected at 850um (a mean of1.0x10^22 cm-2). combined with sensitivity estimates, we suggest that the coresnot detected at 850um are low mass, low column density and low temperaturecores that are below the sensitivity limit of scuba at 850um. for a subsampleof the cores detected at 850um those contained within the mipsgal area) we findthat two thirds are associated with 24um sources. cores not associated with24um emission are either ``starless'' irdc cores that perhaps have yet to formstars, or contain low mass ysos below the mipsgal detection limit. we see thatthose ``starless'' irdc cores and the irdc cores associated with 24um emissionare drawn from the same column density population and are of similar mass. ifwe then assume the cores without 24um embedded sources are at an earlierevolutionary stage to cores with embedded objects we derive a statisticallifetime for the quiescent phase of a few 10^3-10^4 years. finally, we makeconservative predictions for the number of observed irdcs that will be observedby the apex telescope galactic plane survey (atlasgal), the herschel infraredgalactic plane survey (hi-gal), the jcmt galactic plane survey (jps) and thescuba-2 ``all sky'' survey (sassy).

0912.1056	vista variables in the via lactea (vvv): the public eso near-ir  variability survey of the milky way	we describe the public eso near-ir variability survey (vvv) scanning themilky way bulge and an adjacent section of the mid-plane where star formationactivity is high. the survey will take 1929 hours of observations with the4-metre vista telescope during five years (2010-2014), covering ~10^9 pointsources across an area of 520 deg^2, including 33 known globular clusters and~350 open clusters. the final product will be a deep near-ir atlas in fivepassbands (0.9-2.5 microns) and a catalogue of more than 10^6 variable pointsources. unlike single-epoch surveys that, in most cases, only produce 2-dmaps, the vvv variable star survey will enable the construction of a 3-d map ofthe surveyed region using well-understood distance indicators such as rr lyraestars, and cepheids. it will yield important information on the ages of thepopulations. the observations will be combined with data from macho, ogle,eros, vst, spitzer, hst, chandra, integral, wise, fermi lat, xmm-newton, gaiaand alma for a complete understanding of the variable sources in the innermilky way. this public survey will provide data available to the wholecommunity and therefore will enable further studies of the history of the milkyway, its globular cluster evolution, and the population census of the galacticbulge and center, as well as the investigations of the star forming regions inthe disk. the combined variable star catalogues will have importantimplications for theoretical investigations of pulsation properties of stars.

1002.2475	the 6-ghz methanol multibeam maser catalogue i: galactic centre region,  longitudes 345 to 6	we have conducted a galactic plane survey of methanol masers at 6668 mhzusing a 7-beam receiver on the parkes telescope. here we present results fromthe first part, which provides sensitive unbiased coverage of a large regionaround the galactic centre. details are given for 183 methanol maser sites inthe longitude range 345$^{\circ}$ through the galactic centre to 6$^{\circ}$.within 6$^{\circ}$ of the centre, we found 88 maser sites, of which more thanhalf (48) are new discoveries. the masers are confined to a narrow galacticlatitude range, indicative of many sources at the galactic centre distance andbeyond, and confined to a thin disk population; there is no high latitudepopulation that might be ascribed to the galactic bulge.  within 2$^{\circ}$ of the galactic centre the maser velocities all liebetween -60 and +77 \kms, a range much smaller than the 540 \kms range observedin co. elsewhere, the maser with highest positive velocity (+107 \kms) occurs,surprisingly, near longitude 355$^{\circ}$ and is probably attributable to thegalactic bar. the maser with the most negative velocity (-127 \kms) is nearlongitude 346$^{\circ}$, within the longitude-velocity locus of the near sideof the `3-kpc arm'. it has the most extreme velocity of a clear population ofmasers associated with the near and far sides of the 3-kpc arm. closer to thegalactic centre the maser space density is generally low, except within 0.25kpc of the centre itself, the `galactic centre zone', where it is 50 timeshigher, which is hinted at by the longitude distribution, and confirmed by theunusual velocities.

1003.4426	a multiwavelength study of star formation in the vicinity of galactic  hii region sh2-100	we present multiwavelength investigation of morphology, physical-environment,stellar contents and star formation activity in the vicinity of star-formingregion sh 2-100. it is found that the sh 2-100 region contains seven hiiregions of ultracompact and compact nature. the present estimation of distancefor three hii regions, along with the kinematic distance for others, suggeststhat all of them belong to the same molecular cloud complex. using nirphotometry, we identified the most probable ionizing sources of six hiiregions. their approximate photometric spectral type estimates suggest thatthey are massive early-b to mid-o zams stars and agree well with radiocontinuum observations at 1280 mhz. the morphology of the complex shows anon-uniform distribution of warm and hot dust, well mixed with the ionized gas,which correlates well with the variation of average visual extinction (~ 4.2 -97 mag) across the region. we estimated the physical parameters of ionized gaswith the help of radio continuum observations. we detected an optically visiblecompact nebula located to the south of the 850 micron emission associated withone of the hii regions and the diagnostic of the optical emission line ratiosgives electron density and electron temperature of ~ 0.67 x 10^3 cm^-3 and ~10^4 k, respectively. the physical parameters suggest that all the hii regionsare in different stages of evolution, which correlate well with the probableages in the range ~ 0.01 - 2 myr of the ionizing sources. the positions of irexcess stars, ultracompact and compact hii regions at the periphery of an hishell, possibly created by a wr star, indicate that star formation in sh 2-100region might have been induced by an expanding hi shell.

1005.1783	a herschel study of yso evolutionary stages and formation timelines in  two fields of the hi-gal survey	we present a first study of the star-forming compact dust condensationsrevealed by herschel in the two 2 \times 2 \degr galactic plane fields centeredat [l;b] = [30\degr; 0 \degr] and [l;b] = [59\degr; 0 \degr], respectively, andobserved during the science demonstration phase for the herschel infraredgalactic plane survey (hi-gal) key-project. compact source catalogs extractedfor the two fields in the five hi-gal bands (70, 160, 250, 350 and 500 $\mu$m)were merged based on simple criteria of positional association and spectralenergy distribution (sed) consistency into a final catalog which contains onlycoherent seds with counterparts in at least three adjacent herschel bands.these final source lists contain 528 entries for the l = 30\degr field, and 444entries for the l = 59\degr field. the sed coverage has been augmented withancillary data at 24 $\mu$m and 1.1 mm. sed modeling for the subset of 318 and101 sources (in the two fields, respectively) for which the distance is knownwas carried out using both a structured star/disk/envelope radiative transfermodel and a simple isothermal grey-body. global parameters like mass,luminosity, temperature and dust properties have been estimated. the lbol/menvratio spans four orders of magnitudes from values compatible with thepre-protostellar phase to embedded massive zero-age main sequence stars.sources in the l = 59\degr field have on average lower l/m, possibly outliningan overall earlier evolutionary stage with respect to the sources in the l =30\degr field. many of these cores are actively forming high-mass stars,although the estimated core surface densities appear to be an order ofmagnitude below the 1 g cm$^{-2}$ critical threshold for high-mass starformation.

1005.3018	a search for debris disks in the herschel atlas	aims: we aim to demonstrate that the herschel atlas (h-atlas) is suitable fora blind and unbiased survey for debris disks by identifying candidate debrisdisks associated with main sequence stars in the initial science demonstrationfield of the survey. we show that h-atlas reveals a population offar-infrared/sub-mm sources that are associated with stars or star-like objectson the sdss main-sequence locus. we validate our approach by comparing theproperties of the most likely candidate disks to those of the known population.methods: we use a photometric selection technique to identify main sequencestars in the sdss dr7 catalogue and a bayesian likelihood ratio method toidentify h-atlas catalogue sources associated with these main sequence stars.following this photometric selection we apply distance cuts to identify themost likely candidate debris disks and rule out the presence of contaminatinggalaxies using ukidss las k-band images. results: we identify 78 h-atlassources associated with sdss point sources on the main-sequence locus, of whichtwo are the most likely debris disk candidates: h-atlas j090315.8 and h-atlasj090240.2. we show that they are plausible candidates by comparing theirproperties to the known population of debris disks. our initial resultsindicate that bright debris disks are rare, with only 2 candidates identifiedin a search sample of 851 stars. we also show that h-atlas can derive usefulupper limits for debris disks associated with hipparcos stars in the field andoutline the future prospects for our debris disk search programme.

1006.0833	ammonia observations of bright-rimmed clouds: establishing a sample of  triggered protostars	we observed 42 molecular condensations within previously identifiedbright-rimmed clouds in the ammonia rotational inversion lines nh3 (1,1),(2,2), (3,3) and (4,4) using the green bank telescope in green bank, westvirginia. using the relative peaks of the ammonia lines and their hyperfinesatellites we have determined important parameters of these clouds, includingrotational temperatures and column densities.  these observations confirm the presence of dense gas towards iras pointsources detected at submillimetre wavelengths. derived physical propertiesallow us to refine the sample of bright-rimmed clouds into those likely to besites of star formation, triggered via the process of radiatively-drivenimplosion. an investigation of the physical properties of our sources show thattriggered sources are host to greater turbulent velocity dispersions, likelyindicative of shock motions within the cloud material. these may be attributedto the passage of triggered shocks or simply the association of outflowactivity with the sources.  in all, we have refined the sugitani et al. (1991) catalogue to 15 cloudswhich are clearly star-forming and influenced by externalphotoionisation-induced shocks. these sources may be said, with highconfidence, to represent the best examples of triggering within bright-rimmedclouds.

1009.2779	variations of the spectral index of dust emissivity from hi-gal  observations of the galactic plane	variations in the dust emissivity are critical for gas mass determinationsderived from far-infrared observations, but also for separating dust foregroundemission from the cosmic microwave background (cmb). hi-gal observations allowus for the first time to study the dust emissivity variations in the innerregions of the galactic plane at resolution below 1 degree. we present maps ofthe emissivity spectral index derived from the combined herschel pacs 160 \mum, spire 250 \mu m, 350 \mu m, and 500 \mu m data, and the iris 100 \mu m data,and we analyze the spatial variations of the spectral index as a function ofdust temperature and wavelength in the two science demonstration phase hi-galfields, centered at l=30{\deg} and l=59{\deg}. applying two different methods,we determine both dust temperature and emissivity spectral index between 100and 500 \mu m, at an angular resolution of 4'. combining both fields, theresults show variations of the emissivity spectral index in the range 1.8-2.6for temperatures between 14 and 23 k. the median values of the spectral indexare similar in both fields, i.e. 2.3 in the range 100-500 \mu m, while themedian dust temperatures are equal to 19.1 k and 16.0 k in the l=30{\deg} andl=59{\deg} field, respectively. statistically, we do not see any significantdeviations in the spectra from a power law emissivity between 100 and 500 \mum. we confirm the existence of an inverse correlation between the emissivityspectral index and dust temperature, found in previous analyses.

1009.5390	herschel-atlas: the far-infrared--radio correlation at z&lt;0.5	we use data from the herschel-atlas to investigate the evolution of thefar-infrared--radio correlation over the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;0.5. using thetotal far-infrared luminosity of all &gt;5sigma sources in the herschel-atlasscience demonstration field and cross-matching these data with radio data fromthe faint images of the radio sky at twenty-centimetres (first) survey and thenrao vla northern sky survey (nvss), we obtain 104 radio counterparts to theherschel sources. with these data we find no evidence for evolution in thefar-infrared--radio correlation over the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;0.5, where themedian value for the ratio between far-infrared and radio luminosity, $q_{\rmir}$, over this range is $q_{\rm ir} = 2.40\pm 0.12$ (and a mean of $q_{\rmir}=2.52 \pm 0.03$ accounting for the lower limits), consistent with both thelocal value determined from {\em iras} and values derived from surveystargeting the high-redshift universe. by comparing the radio fluxes of oursample measured from both first and nvss we show that previous resultssuggesting an increase in the value of $q_{\rm ir}$ from high to low redshiftmay be the result of resolving out extended emission of the low-redshiftsources with relatively high-resolution interferometric data, although agncontamination could still play a significant role.  we also find tentative evidence that the longer wavelength, cooler dust isheated by an evolved stellar population which does not trace the star-formationrate as closely as the shorter wavelength $\ltsim 250~\mu$m emission or theradio emission, supporting suggestions based on detailed models of individualgalaxies.

1101.3154	the initial conditions of high-mass star formation: radiative transfer  models of irdcs seen in the herschel hi-gal survey	the densest infrared dark clouds (irdcs) may represent the earliestobservable stage of high-mass star formation. these clouds are very cold, hencethey emit mainly at far-infrared and sub-mm wavelengths. for the first time,herschel has provided multi-wavelength, spatially resolved observations ofcores within irdcs, which, when combined with radiative transfer modelling, canconstrain their properties, such as mass, density profile and dust temperature.we use a 3d, multi-wavelength monte carlo radiative transfer code to model indetail the emission from six cores in three typical irdcs seen in the hi-galsurvey (g030.50+00.95, g031.03+00.26 and g031.03+00.76), and thereby todetermine the properties of these cores and compare them with their low-massequivalents. we found masses ranging from 90 to 290 solar masses withtemperatures from 8 to 11k at the centre of each core and 18 to 28k at thesurface. the maximum luminosity of an embedded star within each core wascalculated, and we rule out the possibility of significant high mass starformation having yet occurred in three of our cores.

1101.4654	characterizing precursors to stellar clusters with herschel	context: despite their profound effect on the universe, the formation ofmassive stars and stellar clusters remains elusive. in the past decade,compelling evidence has emerged that suggests infrared dark clouds (irdcs) maybe precursors to stellar clusters. however, the usual method for identifyingirdcs is biased by the requirement that they are seen in absorption againstbright mid-ir emission, whereas dust continuum observations allow cold, densepre-stellar-clusters to be identified anywhere. aims: we aim to understand whatphysical properties characterize irdcs, to explore the population of dustcontinuum sources that are not irdcs, and to roughly characterize the starformation activity in dust continuum sources. results: we present temperatureand column density maps in the hi-gal l=30 and l=59 sdp fields, as well as arobust algorithm for cirrus subtraction and source identification using hi-gal.we report on the fraction of hi-gal sources which are mid-ir-dark, -neutral, or-bright in both fields. we find significant trends in column density andtemperature between mid-ir-dark and -bright pixels; mid-ir-dark pixels areabout 10 k colder and have a factor of 2 higher column density on average thanmid-ir-bright pixels. we find that hi-gal dust continuum sources span a rangeof evolutionary states from pre- to star-forming, and that warmer sources areassociated with more star formation tracers. there is a trend of increasingtemperature with tracer type from mid-ir-dark at the coldest, to outflow/masersources in the middle, and finally to 8 and 24 micron bright sources at thewarmest. finally, we identify five candidate irdc-like sources on the far-sideof the galaxy. these are cold (~ 20 k), high column density (n(h2) &gt; 10^22cm^-2) clouds identified with hi-gal which, despite bright surrounding mid-iremission, show little to no absorption at 8 micron.

1104.4808	clustering properties of far-infrared sources in hi-gal science  demonstration phase fields	we use a minimum spanning tree algorithm to characterize the spatialdistribution of galactic far-ir sources and derive their clustering properties.we aim to reveal the spatial imprint of different types of star formingprocesses, e.g. isolated spontaneous fragmentation of dense molecular clouds,or events of triggered star formation around hii regions, and highlight globalproperties of star formation in the galaxy. we plan to exploit the entirehi-gal survey of the inner galactic plane to gather significant statistics onthe clustering properties of star forming regions, and to look for possiblecorrelations with source properties such as mass, temperature or evolutionarystage. in this paper we present a pilot study based on the two 2x2 squaredegree fields centered at longitudes l=30 and l=59 obtained during the sciencedemonstration phase (sdp) of the herschel mission. we find that over half ofthe clustered sources are associated with hii regions and infrared dark clouds.our analysis also reveals a smooth chromatic evolution of the spatialdistribution where sources detected at short-wavelengths, likely proto-starssurrounded by warm circumstellar material emitting in the far-infrared, tend tobe clustered in dense and compact groups around hii regions while sourcesdetected at long-wavelengths, presumably cold and dusty density enhancements ofthe ism emitting in the sub-millimeter, are distributed in larger and loosergroups.

1105.0004	probing the initial conditions of high-mass star formation. ii.  fragmentation, stability, and chemistry	we present a new high-resolution study of pre-protocluster regions in tracersexclusively probing the coldest and dense gas (nh_2d). the data are used toconstrain the chemical, thermal, kinematic, and physical conditions (i.e.,densities) in g29.96e and g35.20w. nh_3, nh_2d, and continuum emission weremapped using the vla, and pdbi. in particular, nh_2d is a unique tracer ofcold, precluster gas at high densities, while nh_3 traces both the cold andwarm gas of modest-to-high densities. in g29.96e, spitzer images reveal twomassive filaments, one of them in extinction (infrared dark cloud). we observevery low line widths in nh_3 (fwhm &lt;1km/s). these multi-wavelength,high-resolution observations of high-mass pre-protocluster regions show thatthe target regions are characterized by (i) turbulent jeans fragmentation ofmassive clumps into cores (from a jeans analysis); (ii) cores and clumps thatare "over-bound/subvirial", i.e. turbulence is too weak to support them againstcollapse, meaning that (iii) some models of monolithic cloud collapse arequantitatively inconsistent with data; (iv) accretion from the core onto amassive star, which can (for observed core sizes and velocities) be sustainedby accretion of envelope material onto the core, suggesting that (similar tocompetitive accretion scenarios) the mass reservoir for star formation is notnecessarily limited to the natal core; (v) high deuteration ratios([nh_2d/nh_3]&gt;6%), which make the above discoveries possible; (vi) and thedestruction of nh_2d toward embedded stars.

1105.3532	the australia telescope compact array broadband backend (cabb)	here we describe the compact array broadband backend (cabb) and present firstresults obtained with the upgraded australia telescope compact array (atca).the 16-fold increase in observing bandwidth, from 2 x 128 mhz to 2 x 2048 mhz,high bit sampling, and addition of 16 zoom windows (each divided into a further2048 channels) provide major improvements for all atca observations. thebenefits of the new system are: (1) hugely increased radio continuum andpolarization sensitivity as well as image fidelity, (2) substantially improvedcapability to search for and map emission and absorption lines over largevelocity ranges, (3) simultaneous multi-line and continuum observations, (4)increased sensitivity, survey speed and dynamic range due to high-bit sampling,and (5) high velocity resolution, while maintaining full polarization output.the new cabb system encourages all observers to make use of both spectral lineand continuum data to achieve their full potential.  given the dramatic increase of the atca capabilities in all bands (rangingfrom 1.1 to 105 ghz) cabb enables scientific projects that were not feasiblebefore the upgrade, such as simultaneous observations of multiple spectrallines, on-the-fly mapping, fast follow-up of radio transients (e.g., the radioafterglow of new supernovae) and maser observations at high velocity resolutionand full polarization. the first science results presented here includewide-band spectra, high dynamic-range images, and polarization measurements,highlighting the increased capability and discovery potential of the atca.

1105.3924	physical conditions of the interstellar medium of high-redshift,  strongly lensed submillimetre galaxies from the herschel-atlas	we present herschel-spire fourier transform spectrometer (fts) and radiofollow-up observations of two herschel-atlas (h-atlas) detected strongly lenseddistant galaxies. in one of the targeted galaxies h-atlas j090311.6+003906(sdp.81) we detect [oiii] 88\mum and [cii] 158\mum lines at a signal-to-noiseratio of ~5. we do not have any positive line identification in the otherfainter target h-atlas j091305.0-005343 (sdp.130). currently sdp.81 is thefaintest sub-mm galaxy with positive line detections with the fts, withcontinuum flux just below 200 mjy in the 200-600 \mum wavelength range. thederived redshift of sdp.81 from the two detections is z=3.043 +/-0.012, inagreement with ground-based co measurements. this is the first detection byherschel of the [oiii] 88\mum line in a galaxy at redshift higher than 0.05.comparing the observed lines and line ratios with a grid of photo-dissociationregion (pdr) models with different physical conditions, we derive the pdr clouddensity n ~ 2000 cm^{-3} and the far-uv ionizing radiation field g_0 ~ 200 (inunits of the habing field -- the local galactic interstellar radiation field of1.6x10^{-6} w/m^2). using the co derived molecular mass and the pdr propertieswe estimate the effective radius of the emitting region to be 500-700 pc. thesecharacteristics are typical for star-forming, high redshift galaxies. the radioobservations indicate that sdp.81 deviates significantly from the localfir/radio correlation, which hints that some fraction of the radio emission iscoming from an agn. the constraints on the source size from millimiter-waveobservations put a very conservative upper limit of the possible agncontribution to less than 33%. these indications, together with the high[oiii]/fir ratio and the upper limit of [oi] 63\mum/[cii] 158\mum suggest thatsome fraction of the ionizing radiation is likely to originate from an agn.

1105.4663	the h_2o southern galactic plane survey (hops): i. techniques and h_2o  maser data	we present first results of the h_2o southern galactic plane survey (hops),using the mopra radiotelescope with a broad band backend and a beam size ofabout 2'. we have observed 100 square degrees of the southern galactic plane at12mm (19.5 to 27.5ghz), including spectral line emission from water masers,multiple metastable transitions of ammonia, cyanoacetylene, methanol and radiorecombination lines. in this paper, we report on the characteristics of thesurvey and water maser emission. we find 540 water masers, of which 334 are newdetections. the strongest maser is 3933jy and the weakest is 0.7jy, with 62masers over 100jy. in 14 maser sites, the spread in velocity of the water maseremission exceeds 100km/s. in one region, the water maser velocities areseparated by 351.3km/s. the rms noise levels are typically between 1-2jy, with95% of the survey under 2jy. we estimate completeness limits of 98% at around8.4jy and 50% at around 5.5jy. we estimate that there are between 800 and 1500water masers in the galaxy that are detectable in a survey with similarcompleteness limits to hops. we report possible masers in nh_3 (11,9) and (8,6)emission towards g19.61-0.23 and in the nh_3 (3,3) line towards g23.33-0.30.

1111.0972	the statistics of triggered star formation: an overdensity of massive  ysos around spitzer bubbles	we present a detailed statistical study of massive star formation in theenvironment of 322 spitzer mid-infrared bubbles by using the rms survey formassive young stellar objects (ysos). using a combination of simple surfacedensity plots and a more sophisticated angular cross-correlation functionanalysis we show that there is a statistically significant overdensity of rmsysos towards the bubbles. there is a clear peak in the surface density andangular cross-correlation function of ysos projected against the rim of thebubbles. by investigating the autocorrelation function of the rms ysos we showthat this is not due to intrinsic clustering of the rms yso sample. rms ysosand spitzer bubbles are essentially uncorrelated with each other beyond anormalised angular distance of two bubble radii. the bubbles associated withrms ysos tend to be both smaller and thinner than those that are not associatedwith ysos. we interpret this tendency to be due to an age effect, with ysosbeing preferentially found around smaller and younger bubbles. we find noevidence to suggest that the ysos associated with the bubbles are any moreluminous than the rest of the rms yso population, which suggests that thetriggering process does not produce a top heavy luminosity function or initialmass function. we suggest that it is likely that the ysos were triggered by theexpansion of the bubbles and estimate that the fraction of massive stars in themilky way formed by this process could be between 14 and 30%.

1111.1852	detection and characterization of a 500 mic dust emissivity excess in  the galactic plane using herschel/hi-gal observations	past and recent observations have revealed unexpected variations in thefir-mm dust emissivity. in the herschel spectral range, those are oftenreferred to as a 500{\mu}m emission excess. several dust emission models havebeen developed to interpret astrophysical data in the fir-mm domain. however,these are commonly unable to fully reconcile theoretical predictions withobservations. in contrast, the recently revised two level system (tls) modelseems to provide a promising way of interpreting the existing data. the newlyavailable herschel hi-gal data which covers most of the inner milky-way offersa unique opportunity to investigate possible variations in the dust emissionproperties both with wavelength and environment. by combining the iris 100{\mu}m with the hi-gal 160, 250, 350 and 500 {\mu}m data, we model the dustemission spectra in each pixel of the hi-gal maps, using both the tls modeland, for comparison, a single modified black-body fit. the effect oftemperature mixing along the line of sight is investigated. we find a slightdecrease in the dust temperature with distance from the galactic center. wealso report the detection of a significant 500 {\mu}m emissivity excess in theperipheral regions of the plane (35\circ&lt;|l|&lt;70\circ) of about 13-15% of theemissivity, that can reach up to 20% in some hii regions. we present thespatial distribution of the best-fit values for the two main parameters of thetls model, i.e. the charge correlation length, lc, used to characterize thedisordered charge distribution (dcd) part of the model, and the amplitude a ofthe tls processes, with respect to the dcd effect. they highlight the plausibleexistence of an overall gradient with distance to the galactic center. acomparison with previous findings in the solar neighborhood shows that thelocal value of the excess is less than expected from the galactic gradientobserved here.

1201.3812	the g305 star-forming complex: a wide-area radio survey of ultra-compact  hii regions	we present wide-area radio continuum 5.5 and 8.8 ghz (5.5 and 3.4 cm)australia telescope compact array observations of the complex and rich massivestar-forming region g305. the aim of this study is to perform an un-targetedsurvey of the region in search of the compact radio emission associated withultra-compact (uc) hii regions. observations presented here encompass theentire complex and have a maximum resolution of ~1.5x1.4" and sensitivity of~0.07 mjy beam^-1. by applying a data reduction method that emphasisessmall-scale structure, we are able to detect 71 compact radio sourcesdistributed throughout the observed field. to explore the nature of thesecompact radio sources we compare to mid-infrared data and in this way identify56 background sources, eight stellar radio sources, a single bright-rimmedcloud and six candidate uchii regions. the physical properties of thesecandidate uchii regions are determined and reveal five candidates have peakproperties consistent with known uchii regions with source radii ranging from0.04-0.1 pc, emission measures from 2.56--10.3x10^-6 pc cm^-6 and electrondensities of 0.34--1.03x10^4 cm^-3. we comment on these sites of recent massivestar formation within g305 and by comparing to other star formation tracers(masers, nh3, ysos) build a picture of the star formation history of theregion. using these results we estimate a lower limit to the star formationrate for the region of ~0.003 msun yr^-1.

1202.0395	cores in infra-red dark clouds (irdcs) seen in the hi-gal survey between  l = 300{\deg} and l = 330{\deg}	we have used data taken as part of the herschel infrared galactic planesurvey (hi-gal) to study 3171 infrared-dark cloud (irdc) candidates that wereidentified in the mid-infrared (8 {\mu}m) by spitzer (we refer to these as'spitzer-dark' regions). they all lie in the range l=300 - 330 \circ and |b| 61 \circ. of these, only 1205 were seen in emission in the far-infrared (250-500{\mu}m) by herschel (we call these 'herschel-bright' clouds). it is predictedthat a dense cloud will not only be seen in absorption in the mid-infrared, butwill also be seen in emission in the far-infrared at the longest herschelwavebands (250-500 {\mu}m). if a region is dark at all wavelengths throughoutthe mid-infrared and far-infrared, then it is most likely to be simply a regionof lower background infrared emission (a 'hole in the sky'). hence, it appearsthat previous surveys, based on spitzer and other mid-infrared data alone, mayhave over-estimated the total irdc population by a factor of 2. this hasimplications for estimates of the star formation rate in irdcs in the galaxy.westudied the 1205 herschel-bright irdcs at 250 {\mu}m, and found that 972 ofthem had at least one clearly defined 250-{\mu}m peak, indicating that theycontained one or more dense cores. of these, 653 (67 per cent) contained an8-{\mu}m point source somewhere within the cloud, 149 (15 per cent) contained a24-{\mu}m point source but no 8-{\mu}m source, and 170 (18 per cent) containedno 24-{\mu}m or 8-{\mu}m point sources. we use these statistics to makeinferences about the lifetimes of the various evolutionary stages of irdcs.

1202.3891	herschel-atlas: vista viking near-ir counterparts in the phase 1 gama 9h  data	we identify near-infrared ks band counterparts to herschel-atlas sub-mmsources, using a preliminary object catalogue from the vista viking survey. thesub-mm sources are selected from the h-atlas phase 1 catalogue of the gama 9hfield, which includes all objects detected at 250, 350 or 500 um with the spireinstrument. we apply and discuss a likelihood ratio (lr) method for vikingcandidates within a search radius of 10" of the 22,000 spire sources with a 5sigma detection at 250 um. we find that 11,294(51%) of the spire sources have abest viking counterpart with a reliability $r\ge 0.8$, and the falseidentification rate of these is estimated to be 4.2%. we expect to miss ~5% oftrue viking counterparts. there is evidence from z-j and j-ks colours that thereliable counterparts to spire galaxies are marginally redder than the fieldpopulation. we obtain photometric redshifts for ~68% of all (non-stellar)viking candidates with a median redshift of 0.405. comparing to the results ofthe optical identifications supplied with the phase i catalogue, we find thatthe use of medium-deep near-infrared data improves the identification rate ofreliable counterparts from 36% to 51%.

1204.1578	the effect of spiral arms on star formation in the galaxy	we have examined the ratio between the integrated luminosity of massive youngstellar objects detected by the red msx source (rms) survey and the mass ofmolecular clouds in the galactic ring survey region, as a function ofgalactocentric radius. the results indicate that 60--80% of the observedincreases in the star-formation rate density associated with spiral-armfeatures are due to source crowding within the arms. of the remainder, most ofthe increase in the inner sagittarius arm is due to an enhancement in thesimple star-formation efficiency, i.e. in the number of rms sources per unitmolecular gas mass. in the inner perseus arm, the residual increase is due to ahigher than average mean source luminosity, which implies a top-heavy imf, andthis is entirely due to the presence, in the grs region, of the w49star-forming complex, which appears to be exceptional in its nature. theresults also suggest that there is little or no increase in the star-formationefficiency on kiloparsec scales in the scutum tangent region which includesw43. we discuss the possible role played by the spiral arms in influencing thestar-formation efficiency and conclude that the most likely mechanisms arerelated to orbit crowding within the arms.

0711.0775	a scuba survey of bright-rimmed clouds	context: bright-rimmed clouds (brcs) are potential examples of triggered starformation regions, in which photoionisation driven shocks caused by theexpansion of hii regions induce protostellar collapse within the clouds. aims:the main purpose of the paper is to establish the level of star formationoccuring within a known set of brcs. a secondary aim is to determine theextent, if any, to which this star formation has been promulgated by theprocess of photoionisation triggering. methods:a primary set of observations ispresented obtained with submillimeter scuba observations and archival data fromnear-ir and mid- to far-ir have been explored for relevant observations andincorporated where appropriate. results:scuba observations show a total of 47dense cores within the heads of 44 observed brcs drawn from a catalogue of irassources embedded within hii regions, supportive of the scenario proposed by rdimodels. the physical properties of these cores indicate star formation acrossthe majority of our sample. this star formation appears to be predominately inthe regime of intermediate to high mass and may indicate the formation ofclusters. ir observations indicate the association of early star formingsources with our sample. a fundamental difference appears to exist betweendifferent morphological types of brc, which may indicate a differentevolutionary pathway toward star formation in the different types of brc.conclusions:bright-rimmed clouds are found to harbour star formation in itsearly stages. different evolutionary scenarios are found to exist for differentmorphological types of brc. the morphology of a brc is described as type `a',moderately curved rims, type `b', tightly curved rims, and `c', cometary rims.`b' and `c' morphological types...

1207.6159	the h2o southern galactic plane survey(hops): nh3 (1,1) and (2,2)  catalogues	the h2o southern galactic plane survey (hops) has mapped a 100 degree stripof the galactic plane (-70deg &gt; l &gt; 30deg, |b| &lt; 0.5deg) using the 22-m mopraantenna at 12-mm wavelengths. observations were conducted in on-the-fly modeusing the mopra spectrometer (mops), targeting water masers, thermal molecularemission and radio-recombination lines. foremost among the thermal lines arethe 23 ghz transitions of nh3 j,k = (1,1) and (2,2), which trace the densestparts of molecular clouds (n &gt; 10^4 cm^{-3}). in this paper we present the nh3(1,1) and (2,2) data, which have a resolution of 2 arcmin and cover a velocityrange of +/-200 km/s. the median sensitivity of the nh3 data-cubes is sigma_tmb= 0.20 +/1 0.06 k. for the (1,1) transition this sensitivity equates to a 3.2kpc distance limit for detecting a 20 k, 400 msun cloud at the 5-sigma level.similar clouds of mass 5,000 msun would be detected as far as the galacticcentre, while 30,000 msun clouds would be seen across the galaxy. we havedeveloped an automatic emission finding procedure based on the atnf duchampsoftware and have used it to create a new catalogue of 669 dense molecularclouds. the catalogue is 100 percent complete at the 5-sigma detection limit(tmb = 1.0 k). a preliminary analysis of the ensemble cloud properties suggestthat the near kinematic distances are favoured. the cloud positions areconsistent with current models of the galaxy containing a long bar. combinedwith other galactic plane surveys this new molecular-line dataset constitutes akey tool for examining galactic structure and evolution. data-cubes, spectraand catalogues are available to the community via the hops website.

1208.0599	the g305 star-forming complex: embedded massive star formation  discovered by herschel hi-gal	we present a herschel far-infrared study towards the rich massive star-forming complex g305, utilising pacs 70, 160 {\mu}m and spire 250, 350, and 500{\mu}m observations from the hi-gal survey of the galactic plane. the focus ofthis study is to identify the embedded massive star-forming population withing305, by combining far-infrared data with radio continuum, h2o maser, methanolmaser, mips, and red msx source survey data available from previous studies. byapplying a frequentist technique we are able to identify a sample of the mostlikely associations within our multi-wavelength dataset, that can then beidentified from the derived properties obtained from fitted spectral energydistributions (seds). by sed modelling using both a simple modified blackbodyand fitting to a comprehensive grid of model seds, some 16 candidateassociations are identified as embedded massive star-forming regions. we derivea two-selection colour criterion from this sample of log(f70/f500)\geq 1 andlog(f160/f350)\geq 1.6 to identify an additional 31 embedded massive starcandidates with no associated star-formation tracers. using this result we canbuild a picture of the present day star-formation of the complex, and byextrapolating an initial mass function, suggest a current population of \approx2 \times 10^4 young stellar objects (ysos) present, corresponding to a starformation rate (sfr) of 0.01-0.02 m\odot yr^-1. comparing this resolved starformation rate, to extragalactic star formation rate tracers (based on thekennicutt-schmidt relation), we find the star formation activity isunderestimated by a factor of \geq 2 in comparison to the sfr derived from theyso population.

1212.1784	the mid-infrared environments of 6.7 ghz methanol masers from the  methanol multi-beam survey	we present a study of the mid-infrared environments and association with starformation tracers of 6.7 ghz methanol masers taken from the methanol multi-beam(mmb) survey. our ultimate goal is to establish the mass of the host star andits evolutionary stage for each maser site. as a first step, the glimpse surveyof the galactic plane is utilised to investigate the environment of 776methanol masers and we find that while the majority of the masers areassociated with mid-infrared counterparts, a significant fraction (17%) are notassociated with any detectable mid-infrared emission. a number of the masercounterparts are clearly extended with respect to the glimpse point spreadfunction and we implement an adaptive non-circular aperture photometry (ancap)technique to determine the fluxes of the maser counterparts. the ancaptechnique doubles the number of masers with flux information at all fourwavelengths compared to the number of the corresponding counterparts obtainedfrom the glimpse point source catalogue. the colours of the maser counterpartsare found to be very similar to the smaller study carried out by ellingsen(2006). the mmb masers are weakly associated with extended green objects (egos)and red msx survey (rms) embedded sources (yso and hii classifications) with18% and 12% of masers associated with these objects respectively. the majorityof mmb masers (60%) have detectable glimpse infrared counterparts but have notbeen identified with previously recognised tracers of massive star formation;this confirms that the mmb survey has the potential to identify massive starforming regions independent of infrared selection.

1302.2538	atlasgal --- environments of 6.7\,ghz methanol masers	using the 870-$\mu$m apex telescope large area survey of the galaxy(atlasgal), we have identified 577 submillimetre continuum sources with masersfrom the methanol multibeam (mmb) survey in the region $280\degr &lt; \ell &lt;20\degr$; $|\,b\,| &lt; 1.5\degr$. 94\,per\,cent of methanol masers in the regionare associated with sub-millimetre dust emission. we estimate masses for ~450maser-associated sources and find that methanol masers are preferentiallyassociated with massive clumps. these clumps are centrally condensed, withenvelope structures that appear to be scale-free, the mean maser position beingoffset from the peak column density by 0.0 \pm 4". assuming a kroupa initialmass function and a star-formation efficiency of ~30\,per\,cent, we find thatover two thirds of the clumps are likely to form clusters with masses&gt;20\,\msun. furthermore, almost all clumps satisfy the empirical mass-sizecriterion for massive star formation. bolometric luminosities taken from theliterature for ~100 clumps range between ~100 and 10$^6$\,\lsun. this confirmsthe link between methanol masers and massive young stars for 90\,per\,cent ofour sample. the galactic distribution of sources suggests that thestar-formation efficiency is significantly reduced in the galactic-centreregion, compared to the rest of the survey area, where it is broadly constant,and shows a significant drop in the massive star-formation rate density in theouter galaxy. we find no enhancement in source counts towards the southernscutum-centaurus arm tangent at $\ell ~ 315\degr$, which suggests that this armis not actively forming stars.

1302.4436	herschel-atlas: a binary hylirg pinpointing a cluster of starbursting  proto-ellipticals	panchromatic observations of the best candidate hylirg from the widestherschel extragalactic imaging survey have led to the discovery of at leastfour intrinsically luminous z=2.41 galaxies across a ~100-kpc region - acluster of starbursting proto-ellipticals. via sub-arcsecond interferometricimaging we have measured accurate gas and star-formation surface densities. thetwo brightest galaxies span ~3 kpc fwhm in submm/radio continuum and co j=4-3,and double that in co j=1-0. the broad co line is due partly to the multitudeof constituent galaxies and partly to large rotational velocities in twocounter-rotating gas disks -- a scenario predicted to lead to the most intensestarbursts, which will therefore come in pairs. the disks have m(dyn) ofseveral x 10^11 msun, and gas fractions of ~40%. velocity dispersions aremodest so the disks are unstable, potentially on scales commensurate with theirradii: these galaxies are undergoing extreme bursts of star formation, notconfined to their nuclei, at close to the eddington limit. their specificstar-formation rates place them ~&gt;5x above the main sequence, which supposedlycomprises large gas disks like these. their high star-formation efficienciesare difficult to reconcile with a simple volumetric star-formation law. n-bodyand dark matter simulations suggest this system is the progenitor of ab(inary)-type ~10^14.6-msun cluster.

1305.1303	observation of hcn hyperfine line anomalies towards low- and high-mass  star-forming cores	hcn is becoming a popular choice of molecule for studying star formation inboth low- and high-mass regions and for other astrophysical sources from cometsto high-redshift galaxies. however, a major and often overlooked difficultywith hcn is that it can exhibit non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-lte)behaviour in its hyperfine line structure. individual hyperfine lines can bestrongly boosted or suppressed. in low-mass star-forming cloud observations,this could possibly lead to large errors in the calculation of opacity andexcitation temperature, while in massive star-forming clouds, where thehyperfine lines are blended due to turbulent broadening, errors will arise ininfall measurements that are based on the separation of the peaks in aself-absorbed profile. the underlying line shape cannot be known for certain ifhyperfine anomalies are present. we present a first observational investigationof these anomalies across a range of conditions and transitions by carrying outa survey of low-mass starless cores (in taurus &amp; ophiuchus) and high-massprotostellar objects (in the g333 giant molecular cloud) using hydrogen cyanide(hcn) j=1-0 and j=3-2 emission lines. we quantify the degree of anomaly inthese two rotational levels by considering ratios of individual hyperfine linescompared to lte values. we find that all the cores observed show some degree ofanomaly while many of the lines are severely anomalous. we conclude that hcnhyperfine anomalies are common in both lines in both low-mass and high-massprotostellar objects, and we discuss the differing hypotheses for thegeneration of the anomalies. in light of the results, we favour a line overlapeffect for the origins of the anomalies. we discuss the implications for theuse of hcn as a dynamical tracer and suggest in particular that the j=1-0,f=0-1 hyperfine line should be avoided in quantitative calculations.

1307.4105	atlasgal --- properties of compact hii regions and their natal clumps	we present a complete sample of molecular clumps containing compact andultra-compact (uc) hii regions between \ell=10\degr and 60\degr\ and$|b|&lt;1\degr, identified by combining the the atlasgal submm and cornish radiocontinuum surveys with visual examination of archival infrared data. our sampleis complete to optically thin, compact and uchii regions driven by a zero agemain sequence star of spectral type b0 or earlier embedded within a 1,000 msunclump. in total we identify 213 compact and uchii regions, associated with 170clumps. unambiguous kinematic distances are derived for these clumps and usedto estimate their masses and physical sizes, as well as the lyman continuumfluxes and sizes of their embedded hii regions. we find a clear lower envelopefor the surface density of molecular clumps hosting massive star formation of0.05 g cm^{-2}, which is consistent with a similar sample of clumps associatedwith 6.7 ghz masers. the mass of the most massive embedded stars is closelycorrelated with the mass of their natal clump. young b stars appear to besignificantly more luminous in the ultraviolet than predicted by currentstellar atmosphere models. the properties of clumps associated with compact anduchii regions are very similar to those associated with 6.7 ghz methanol masersand we speculate that there is little evolution in the structure of themolecular clumps between these two phases. finally, we identify a significantpeak in the surface density of compact and uchii regions associated with thew49a star-forming complex, noting that this complex is truly one of the mostmassive and intense regions of star formation in the galaxy.

1307.4590	a 325-mhz gmrt survey of the herschel-atlas/gama fields	we describe a 325-mhz survey, undertaken with the giant metrewave radiotelescope (gmrt), which covers a large part of the three equatorial fields at9, 12 and 14.5 h of right ascension from the herschel-astrophysical terahertzlarge area survey (h-atlas) in the area also covered by the galaxy and massassembly survey (gama). the full dataset, after some observed pointings wereremoved during the data reduction process, comprises 212 gmrt pointingscovering ~90 deg^2 of sky. we have imaged and catalogued the data using apipeline that automates the process of flagging, calibration, self-calibrationand source detection for each of the survey pointings. the resulting imageshave resolutions of between 14 and 24 arcsec and minimum rms noise (away frombright sources) of ~1 mjy/beam, and the catalogue contains 5263 sourcesbrighter than 5 sigma. we investigate the spectral indices of gmrt sourceswhich are also detected at 1.4 ghz and find them to agree broadly withpreviously published results; there is no evidence for any flattening of theradio spectral index below s_1.4=10 mjy. this work adds to the large amount ofavailable optical and infrared data in the h-atlas equatorial fields and willfacilitate further study of the low-frequency radio properties of starformation and agn activity in galaxies out to z~1.

1308.4406	herschel-atlas: correlations between dust and gas in local  submm-selected galaxies	we present an analysis of co molecular gas tracers in a sample of500{\mu}m-selected herschel-atlas galaxies at z&lt;0.05 (cz&lt;14990km/s). using22-500{\mu}m photometry from wise, iras and herschel, with hi data from theliterature, we investigate correlations between warm and cold dust, and tracersof the gas in different phases. the correlation between global co(3-2) linefluxes and fir-submillimetre fluxes weakens with increasing ir wavelength({\lambda}&gt;60{\mu}m), as a result of colder dust being less strongly associatedwith dense gas. conversely, co(2-1) and hi line fluxes both appear to be bettercorrelated with longer wavelengths, suggesting that cold dust is more stronglyassociated with diffuse atomic and molecular gas phases, consistent with itbeing at least partially heated by radiation from old stellar populations. theincreased scatter at long wavelengths implies that submillimetre fluxes are apoorer tracer of sfr. fluxes at 22 and 60{\mu}m are also better correlated withdiffuse gas tracers than dense co(3-2), probably due to very-small-grainemission in the diffuse interstellar medium, which is not correlated with sfr.the fir/co luminosity ratio and the dust mass/co luminosity ratio both decreasewith increasing luminosity, as a result of either correlations between mass andmetallicity (changing co/h2) or between co luminosity and excitation [changingco(3-2)/co(1-0)].

1309.4102	isothermal dust models of herschel-atlas galaxies	we use galaxies from the herschel-atlas survey, and a suite of ancillarysimulations based on an isothermal dust model, to study our ability todetermine the effective dust temperature, luminosity and emissivity index of250um selected galaxies in the local universe (z &lt; 0.5). as well as simplefar-infrared sed fitting of individual galaxies based on chi^2 minimisation, weattempt to derive the best global isothermal properties of 13,826 galaxies withreliable optical counterparts and spectroscopic redshifts. using oursimulations, we highlight the fact that applying traditional sed fittingtechniques to noisy observational data in the herschel space observatory bandsintroduces artificial anti-correlation between derived values of dusttemperature and emissivity index. this is true even for galaxies with the mostrobust detections in our sample, making the results hard to interpret. we applya method to determine the best-fit global values of isothermal effectivetemperature and emissivity index for z &lt; 0.5 galaxies in h-atlas, deriving t =22.3 +/- 0.1k and beta = 1.98 +/- 0.02 (or t = 23.5 +/- 0.1k and beta = 1.82+/- 0.02 if we attempt to correct for bias by assuming that t and beta areindependent and normally distributed). we use our technique to test for anevolving emissivity index, finding only weak evidence. the median dustluminosity of our sample is log(ldust/lsolar) = 10.72 +/- 0.05 which (unlike t)shows little dependence on the choice of beta used in our analysis, includingwhether it is variable or fixed. we use a further suite of simulations toemphasise the importance of the h-atlas pacs data for deriving dusttemperatures at these redshifts, even though they are less sensitive than thespire data. the majority of galaxies detected by h-atlas are normalstar-forming galaxies, though a substantial minority (~31%) fall in theluminous infrared galaxy category.

1310.4758	the rms survey: galactic distribution of massive star formation	abridged: we have used the well-selected sample of ~1750 embedded, young,massive stars identified by the rms survey to investigate the galacticdistribution of recent massive star formation. we describe the various methodsused to assign distances extracted from the literature, and solve the distanceambiguities towards ~200 sources located within the solar circle using archivalhi data. these distances are used to calculate bolometric luminosities andestimate the survey completeness (~2x10^4 lsun). in total, we calculate thedistance and luminosity of ~1650 sources, one third of which are above thesurvey's completeness threshold. examination of the sample's longitude,latitude, radial velocities and mid-infrared images has identified ~120 smallgroups of sources, many of which are associated with well known star formationcomplexes, such as w43, w49 and w51.  we compare the positional distribution of the sample with the expectedlocations of the spiral arms, assuming a model of the galaxy consisting of fourgaseous arms. the distribution of young massive stars in the milky way isspatially correlated with the spiral arms, with strong peaks in the sourceposition and luminosity distributions at the arms' galactocentric radii. theoverall source and luminosity surface densities are both well correlated withthe surface density of the molecular gas, which suggests that the massive starformation rate per unit molecular mass is approximately constant across thegalaxy.  we estimate the total luminosity of the embedded massive star population tobe ~0.76x10^8 lsun, 30% of which is associated with the ten most active starforming complexes. we measure the scale height as a function of galactocentricdistance and find that it increases only modestly from ~20-30 pc between 4 and8 kpc, but much more rapidly at larger distances.

1406.5078	atlasgal --- towards a complete sample of massive star forming clumps	by matching infrared-selected, massive young stellar objects (mysos) andcompact hii regions in the rms survey to massive clumps found in thesubmillimetre atlasgal survey, we have identified ~1000 embedded young massivestars between 280\degr &lt; $\ell$ &lt; 350\degr and 10degr &lt; $\ell$ &lt; 60\degr with|b|&lt;1.5degr. combined with an existing sample of radio-selected methanol masersand compact hii regions, the result is a catalogue of ~1700 massive starsembedded within ~1300 clumps located across the inner galaxy, containing threeobservationally distinct subsamples, methanol-maser, myso and hii-regionassociations, covering the most important tracers of massive star formation,thought to represent key stages of evolution. we find that massive starformation is strongly correlated with the regions of highest column density inspherical, centrally condensed clumps. we find no significant differencesbetween the three samples in clump structure or the relative location of theembedded stars, which suggests that the structure of a clump is set before theonset of star formation, and changes little as the embedded object evolvestowards the main sequence. there is a strong linear correlation between clumpmass and bolometric luminosity, with the most massive stars forming in the mostmassive clumps. we find that the myso and hii-region subsamples are likely tocover a similar range of evolutionary stages and that the majority are near theend of their main accretion phase. we find few infrared-bright mysos associatedwith the most massive clumps, probably due to very short pre-main sequencelifetimes in the most luminous sources.

1407.6042	methanol maser associated outflows: detection statistics and properties	we have selected the positions of 54 6.7ghz methanol masers from the methanolmultibeam survey catalogue, covering a range of longitudes between $20^{\circ}$and $34^{\circ}$ of the galactic plane. these positions were mapped in thej=3-2 transition of both the $\rm{^{13}co}$ and $\rm{c^{18}o}$ lines. a totalof 58 $\rm{^{13}co}$ emission peaks are found in the vicinity of these maserpositions. we search for outflows around all $\rm{^{13}co}$ peaks, and findevidence for high-velocity gas in all cases, spatially resolving the red andblue outflow lobes in 55 cases. of these sources, 44 have resolved kinematicdistances, and are closely associated with the 6.7ghz masers, a sub-setreferred to as methanol maser associated outflows (mmaos). we calculate themasses of the clumps associated with each peak using 870 $\rm{\mu m}$ continuumemission from the atlasgal survey. a strong correlation is seen between theclump mass and both outflow mass and mechanical force, lending support tomodels in which accretion is strongly linked to outflow. we find that thescaling law between outflow activity and clump masses observed for low-massobjects, is also followed by the mmaos in this study, indicating a commonalityin the formation processes of low-mass and high-mass stars.

1410.3377	very low-luminosity class i/flat outflow sources in sigma orionis	we present an optical through sub-millimetre multi-wavelength study of twovery low-luminosity class i/flat systems, mayrit 1701117 and mayrit 1082188, inthe sigma orionis cluster. we performed moderate resolution (r ~ 1000) optical(~0.4-0.9mu) spectroscopy with the twin spectrograph at the calar alto 3.5-mtelescope. the spectra for both sources show prominent emission in accretion-and outflow-associated lines. the mean accretion rate measured from multipleline diagnostics is 6.4x10^{-10} msun/yr for mayrit 1701117, and 2.5x10^{-10}msun/yr for mayrit 1082188. the outflow mass loss rates for the two systems aresimilar and estimated to be ~1x10^{-9} msun/yr. the activity rates are withinthe range observed for low-mass class i protostars. we obtained sub-millimetrecontinuum observations with the submillimetre common-user bolometer array(scuba-2) bolometer at the james clerk maxwell telescope. both objects aredetected at a &gt;5-sigma level in the scuba-2 850mu band. the bolometricluminosity of the targets as measured from the observed spectral energydistribution over ~0.8-850mu is 0.18+/-0.04 lsun for mayrit 1701117, and0.16+/-0.03 lsun for mayrit 1082188, and is in the very low-mass range. thetotal dust+gas mass derived from sub-millimetre fluxes is ~36 m_jup and ~22m_jup for mayrit 1701117 and mayrit 1082188, respectively. there is thepossibility that some of the envelope material might be dissipated by thestrong outflows driven by these sources, resulting in a final mass of thesystem close to or below the sub-stellar limit.

1410.6322	the almost ubiquitous association of 6.7 ghz methanol masers with dust	we report the results of 870-$\mu$m continuum observations, using the largeapex bolometer camera (laboca), towards 77 class-ii, 6.7-ghz methanol masersidentified by the methanol multibeam (mmb) survey to map the thermal emissionfrom cool dust towards these objects. these data complement a study of 630methanol masers associated with compact dense clumps identified from theatlasgal survey. compact dust emission is detected towards 70 sources, whichimplies a dust-association rate of 99% for the full mmb catalogue. evaluationof the derived dust and maser properties leads us to conclude that the combinedsample represents a single population tracing the same phenomenon. we findmedian clump masses of a few 10$^3$ m$\odot$ and that all but a handful ofsources satisfy the mass-size criterion required for massive star formation.this study provides the strongest evidence of the almost ubiquitous associationof methanol masers with massive, star-forming clumps. the fraction ofmethanol-maser associated clumps is a factor of ~2 lower in the outer galaxythan the inner galaxy, possibly a result of the lower metallicity environmentof the former. we find no difference in the clump-mass and maser-luminositydistributions of the inner and outer galaxy. the maser-pumping andclump-formation mechanisms are therefore likely to be relatively invariant togalactic location. finally, we use the ratio of maser luminosity and clump massto investigate the hypothesis that the maser luminosity is a good indicator ofthe evolutionary stage of the embedded source, however, we find no evidence tosupport this.

1501.06589	6.7ghz methanol maser associated outflows: an evolutionary sequence	we present a continuing study of a sample 44 molecular outflows, observed in13co lines, closely associated with 6.7ghz methanol masers, hence calledmethanol maser associated outflows (mmaos). we compare mmao properties withthose of outflows from other surveys in the literature. in general, mmaosfollow similar trends, but show a deficit in number at low masses and momenta,with a corresponding higher fraction at the high end of the distributions. asimilar trend is seen for the dynamical timescales of mmaos. we argue that thelack of relatively low mass and young flows in mmaos is due to the inherentselection-bias in the sample, i.e. its direct association with 6.7ghz methanolmasers. this implies that methanol masers must switch on after the onset ofoutflows (hence accretion), and not before a sufficient abundance of methanolis liberated from icy dust mantles. consequently the average dynamical age ofmmaos is older than for the general population of molecular outflows. wepropose an adjusted evolutionary sequence of outflow and maser occurrence inthe hot core phase, where methanol masers turn on after the onset of theoutflow phase.

1506.04552	star formation scales and efficiency in galactic spiral arms	we positionally match a sample of infrared-selected young stellar objects(ysos), identified by combining the spitzer glimpse, wise and herschel spaceobservatory hi-gal surveys, to the dense clumps identified in the millimetrecontinuum by the bolocam galactic plane survey in two galactic lines of sightcentred towards l = 30deg and l = 40deg. we calculate the ratio of infraredluminosity, l_ir, to the mass of the clump, m_clump, in a variety of galacticenvironments and find it to be somewhat enhanced in spiral arms compared to theinterarm regions when averaged over kiloparsec scales. we find no compellingevidence that these changes are due to the mechanical influence of the spiralarm on the star-formation efficiency rather than, e.g., different gradients inthe star-formation rate due to patchy or intermittent star formation, or localvariations that are not averaged out due to small source samples. the largestvariation in l_ir/m_clump is found in individual clump values, which follow alog-normal distribution and have a range of over three orders of magnitude.this spread is intrinsic as no dependence of l_ir/m_clump with m_clump wasfound. no difference was found in the luminosity distribution of sources in thearm and interarm samples and a strong linear correlation was found between l_irand m_clump.

1507.02187	the rms survey: ammonia mapping of the environment of massive young  stellar objects	we present the results of ammonia observations towards 66 massive starforming regions identified by the red msx source survey. we have used the greenbank telescope and the k-band focal plane array to map the ammonia nh3 (1,1)and (2,2) inversion emission at a resolution of 30 arcsec in 8 arcmin regionstowards the positions of embedded massive star formation. we have identified atotal of 115 distinct clumps, approximately two-thirds of which are associatedwith an embedded massive young stellar object or compact hii region, while theothers are classified as quiescent. there is a strong spatial correlationbetween the peak nh3 emission and the presence of embedded objects. we derivethe spatial distribution of the kinetic gas temperatures, line widths, andnh$_3$ column densities from these maps, and by combining these data with dustemission maps we estimate clump masses, h$_2$ column densities and ammoniaabundances. the clumps have typical masses of ~1000 msun and radii ~0.5 pc,line widths of ~2 km/s and kinetic temperatures of ~16-20 k. we find nosignificant difference between the sizes and masses of the star forming andquiescent subsamples; however, the distribution maps reveal the presence oftemperature and line width gradients peaking towards the centre for the starforming clumps while the quiescent clumps show relatively uniform temperaturesand line widths throughout. virial analysis suggests that the vast majority ofclumps are gravitationally bound and are likely to be in a state of global freefall in the absence of strong magnetic fields. the similarities between theproperties of the two subsamples suggest that the quiescent clumps are alsolikely to form massive stars in the future, and therefore provide a excellentopportunity to study the initial conditions of massive pre-stellar andprotostellar clumps.

1512.08235	chimps: the $^{13}$co/c$^{18}$o (j=3-2) heterodyne inner milky way plane  survey	we present the $^{13}$co/c$^{18}$o (j=3-2) heterodyne inner milky way planesurvey (chimps) which has been carried out using the heterodyne array receiverprogram on the 15 m james clerk maxwell telescope (jcmt) in hawaii. thehigh-resolution spectral survey currently covers |b| &lt; 0.5 deg and 28 &lt; l &lt; 46deg, with an angular resolution of 15 arcsec in 0.5 km/s velocity channels. thespectra have a median rms of $\sim$ 0.6 k at this resolution, and for opticallythin gas at an excitation temperature of 10 k, this sensitivity corresponds tocolumn densities of $n_{\mathrm{h}_{2}} \sim 3 \times 10^{20}\,$cm$^{-2}$ and$n_{\mathrm{h}_{2}} \sim 4 \times 10^{21}\,$cm$^{-2}$ for $^{13}$co andc$^{18}$o, respectively. the molecular gas that chimps traces is at highercolumn densities and is also more optically thin than in other publiclyavailable co surveys due to its rarer isotopologues, and thus morerepresentative of the three-dimensional structure of the clouds. the criticaldensity of the j=3-2 transition of co is $\gtrsim 10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$ attemperatures of $\leq 20$ k, and so the higher density gas associated with starformation is well traced. these data complement other existing galactic planesurveys, especially the jcmt galactic plane survey which has similar spatialresolution and column density sensitivity, and the herschel infrared galacticplane survey. in this paper, we discuss the observations, data reduction andcharacteristics of the survey, presenting integrated emission maps for theregion covered. position-velocity diagrams allow comparison with galacticstructure models of the milky way, and while we find good agreement with aparticular four arm model, there are some significant deviations.

astro-ph;0408205	high-mass star formation within the bright-rimmed cloud sfo 79	we report radio recombination line (rrl) and continuum observations towardthe iras point source 16362--4845, embedded within the bright-rimmed cloud(brc) sfo 79, a small molecular cloud lying at the edge of the hii region rcw108. high resolution observations of the h92alpha hydrogen recombination lineand of the continuum emission (3.6 and 6 cm) confirm the presence of a resolvedultra compact (uc) hii region embedded within the molecular cloud. theintegrated radio fluxes suggest the source of the ionisation to be an o9 zeroage main sequence (zams) star. millimetre observations of 12co, 13co and c18o(j=1--0) molecular lines reveal the presence of a molecular condensation offset\~30 arcsec to the north of the iras position on the boundary of the uc hiiregion. analysis of 2mass data has led to the identification of a small ircluster of young stellar objects (ysos) that are positionally coincident withthe uc hii region, lying to the south east of the peak of the radio emission.moreover, the uc hii region appears to be extended in the direction of the ircluster, which suggests that the radio emission and the ir cluster are in someway related to each other. msx 8.3 micron and 21.3 micron images have been usedto trace the large scale structure of the brc, revealing the presence of aphoto dominated region (pdr) and three embedded thermal sources within themolecular cloud. the alignment of the three thermal sources along a lineparallel to the bright rim suggests that they could have been triggered by thepropagation of a plane parallel shock through the cloud.

astro-ph;0506402	millimetre continuum observations of southern massive star formation  regions. i. simba observations of cold cores	we report the results of a sest 1.2 mm continuum emission survey towardregions previously identified as harbouring a methanol maser and/or an uc hiiregion, typically indicative of massive star formation. emission is detectedtoward all of the methanol maser and uc hii regions targeted, implying thatthese objescts are associated with cold, deeply embedded objects.  we have also identified a large number (253) of sources within the simbamaps, which are devoid of maser and radio continuum emission. these `mm-only'cores may be an entirely new class of source that represents an earlier stagein the evolution of massive stars, prior to the onset of methanol maseremission. or, they may harbour protoclusters, which do not contain any highmass stars (i.e. below the hii). alternatively, they may represent across-section of both, where the more massive mm-only cores are a precursor tothe methanol maser and the least massive mm-only cores will form intermediatemass stars.  analysis of the mm-only sources shows that they are less massive ({\= m} =0.9 x 10^{3} msun), and smaller ({\= r} = 0.4 pc) than sources with methanolmaser and/or radio continuum emission, which collectively have a mean mass of2.5 x 10^{3} msun and a mean radius of 0.7 pc.

astro-ph;0601718	radio continuum and molecular line observations of four bright-rimmed  clouds	we present the results of radio continuum and molecular line observationsconducted using the mopra millimetre-wave telescope and australia telescopecompact array. these observations reveal the presence of a dense core embeddedwithin each cloud, and the presence of a layer of hot ionised gas coincidedwith their bright-rims. the ionised gas has electron densities significantlyhigher than the critical density above which an ionised boundary layer can formand be maintained, strongly supporting the hypothesis that these clouds arebeing photoionised by the nearby ob star(s). from an evaluation of the pressurebalance between the ionised and molecular gas, sfo 58 and sfo 68 are identifiedas being in a post-pressure balance state, while sfo 75 and sfo 76 are morelikely to be in a pre-pressure balance state. we find secondary evidence forthe presence of ongoing star formation within sfo 58 and sfo 68, such asmolecular outflows, oh, h$_2$o and methanol masers, and identify a potentialembedded uc hii region, but find no evidence for any ongoing star formationwithin sfo 75 and sfo 76. our results are consistent with the star formationwithin sfo 58 and sfo 68 having been triggered by the radiatively drivenimplosion of these clouds.

astro-ph;0602294	millimetre continuum observations of southern massive star formation  regions ii. scuba observations of cold cores and the dust grain emissivity  index $\beta$	we report the results of a submillimetre continuum emission survey targetedtoward 78 star formation regions, 72 of which are devoid of methanol maser anduc hii regions, identified in the sest/simba millimetre continuum survey ofhill et al. (2005). at least 45 per cent of the latter sources, dubbed`mm-only', detected in this survey are also devoid of mid infrared msx,emission. the 450 and 850micron, continuum emission was mapped using thesubmillimetre common user bolometer array (scuba) instrument on the james clerkmaxwell telescope (jcmt). emission is detected toward 97 per cent of the 78sources targeted as well as towards 28 other simba sources lying in the scubafields.  we concatenate the results from four (sub)millimetre continuum surveys ofmassive star formation [walsh et al. (2003), hill et al. (2005), thompson etal. (2006); as well as this work], together with the galactic plane map ofpierce-price et al. (2000) in order to determine the dust grain emissivityindex $\beta$ for each of the sources in the simba source list. we examine thevalue of $\beta$ with respect to temperature, as well as for the source classesidentified in the simba survey, for variation of this index. our resultsindicate that $\beta$ is typically 2, which is consistent with previousdeterminations in the literature, but for a considerably larger sample thanprevious work.

astro-ph;0603230	triggered star formation in bright-rimmed clouds: the eagle nebula  revisited	a three dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamical (sph) model has beenextended to study the radiative driven implosion effect of massive stars on thedynamical evolutions of surrounding molecular clouds. the new elements in theupgraded code are the inclusion of lyman continuum in the incident radiationflux and the treatment of hydrogen ionisation process; introducing ionisationheating &amp; recombination cooling effects; and adding a proper description of themagnetic and turbulent pressures to the internal pressure of the molecularcloud. the application of this newly developed model to the structure of themiddle eagle nebula finger suggests that the shock induced by the ionisingradiation at the front side of the head precedes an ionisation front movingtowards the center of the core, and that the core at the fingertip is attransition stage evolving toward a state of induced star formation. thedynamical evolution of the velocity field of the simulated cloud structure isdiscussed to illustrate the role of the self-gravity and the different cloudmorphologies which appear at different stages in the evolutionary process ofthe cloud. the modelled gas evaporation rate is consistent with that of currentother models and the density, temperature and chemical profiles are agreementwith the observed values. the relative lifetimes of different simulated cloudmorphologies suggests a possible answer to the question of why morebright-rimmed clouds are observed to possess a flat-core than an elongated-coremorphology.

astro-ph;0604208	a scuba imaging survey of ultracompact hii regions: the environments of  massive star formation	we present a scuba submillimetre (450 &amp; 850 micron) survey of the environmentof 105 iras point sources, selected from the wood &amp; churchwell (1989a) andkurtz, churchwell &amp; wood (1994) radio ultracompact (uc) hii region surveys. wedetected a total of 155 sub-mm clumps associated with the iras point sourcesand identified three distinct types of object: ultracompact cm-wave sourcesthat are not associated with any sub-mm emission (sub-mm quiet objects), sub-mmclumps that are associated with ultracompact cm-wave sources (radio-loudclumps); and sub-mm clumps that are not associated with any known ultracompactcm-wave sources (radio-quiet clumps). 90% of the sample of iras point sourceswere found to be associated with strong sub-mm emission. we consider the sub-mmcolours, morphologies and distance-scaled fluxes of the sample of sub-mm clumpsand show that the sub-mm quiet objects are unlikely to represent embedded uchii regions unless they are located at large heliocentric distances. many ofthe 2.5 arcmin scuba fields contain more than one sub-mm clump, with an averagenumber of companions (the companion clump fraction) of 0.90. the clumps aremore strongly clustered than other candidate hmpos and the mean clump surfacedensity exhibits a broken power-law distribution with a break at 3 pc. wedemonstrate that the sub-mm and cm-wave fluxes of the majority of radio-loudclumps are in excellent agreement with the standard model of ultracompact hiiregions. we speculate on the nature of the radio-quiet sub-mm clumps and,whilst we do not yet have sufficient data to conclude that they are in a pre-uchii region phase, we argue that their characteristics are suggestive of such astage.

astro-ph;0611907	the jcmt spectral legacy survey	stars form in the densest, coldest, most quiescent regions of molecularclouds. molecules provide the only probes which can reveal the dynamics,physics, chemistry and evolution of these regions, but our understanding of themolecular inventory of sources and how this is related to their physical stateand evolution is rudimentary and incomplete. the spectral legacy survey (sls)is one of seven surveys recently approved by the jcmt board. starting in 2007,the sls will produce a spectral imaging survey of the content and distributionof all the molecules detected in the 345 ghz atmospheric window (between 332ghz and 373 ghz) towards a sample of 5 sources. our intended targets are: a lowmass core (ngc1333 iras4), 3 high mass cores spanning a range of star formingenvironments and evolutionary states (w49, afgl2591, and iras20126), and a pdr(the orion bar). the sls will use the unique spectral imaging capabilities ofharp-b/acsis to study the molecular inventory and the physical structure ofthese objects, which span different evolutionary stages and physicalenvironments, to probe their evolution during the star formation process. asits name suggests, the sls will provide a lasting data legacy from the jcmtthat is intended to benefit the entire astronomical community. as such, theentire data set (including calibrated spectral datacubes, maps of molecularemission, line identifications, and calculations of the gas temperature andcolumn density) will be publicly available.

astro-ph;0702548	probing the initial conditions of high mass star formation -- i.  deuteration and depletion in high mass pre/protocluster clumps	ultracompact hii regions are signposts of high mass star formation. sincehigh-mass star formation occurs in clusters, one expects to find even earlierphases of massive star formation in the vicinity of ultracompact hii regions.here, we study the amount of deuteration and depletion toward pre/protoclusterclumps found in a wide-field (10 x 10 arcmin) census of clouds in 32 massivestar-forming regions that are known to harbour uchii regions.  we find that 65% of the observed sources have strong nh2d emission and morethan 50% of the sources exhibit a high degree of deuteration, (0.1 &lt; nh2d/nh3 &lt;0.7), 0.7 being the highest observed deuteration of nh3 reported to date. oursearch for nhd2 in two sources did not result in a detection. the enhancementin deuteration coincides with moderate co depletion onto dust grains. there isno evidence of a correlation between the two processes, though an underlyingcorrelation cannot be ruled out as the depletion factor is very likely to beonly a lower limit. in summary, we find co depletion and high deuterationtowards cold cores in massive star forming regions. therefore, these are goodcandidates for sources at the early phases of massive star formation. while oursensitive upper limits on nhd2 do not prove the predictions of the gas-phaseand grain chemistry models wrong, an enhancement of ~10^4 over the cosmic d/hratio from nh2d warrants explanation.

astro-ph;0703252	a tale of two cores: triggered massive star formation in the  bright-rimmed cloud sfo 75	abridged: we present a detailed multi-wavelength study of the bright-rimmedcloud sfo 75, including 1.3cm and 1.2mm continuum, and 13co and ammoniaspectral line observations. the 13co and 1.2 mm emission reveals the presenceof a dense core located behind the bright rim of the cloud which isapproximately coincident with that of the iras point source. from an analysisof the iras and 1.2mm fluxes we derive a dust temperature of ~30 k, aluminosity of 1.6x10^4 l\odot and estimate the core mass to be ~570 m\odot. thehigher resolution ammonia observations resolve the 1.2mm core into two distinctcores, one directly behind the cloud's rim (core a) and the second locatedslightly farther back (core b). comparing the morphology of core a with that ofthe photon-dominated region and ionised boundary layer leaves little doubt thatit is being strongly affected by the ionisation front. 2mass and glimpsearchive data which reveal a small cluster of three deeply embedded high- andintermediate-mass young stellar objects towards core a leads us to concludethat the star formation found towards this core has been triggered. in starkcontrast, core b appears to have a much simpler, almost spherical, morphology.no stars are found towards core b. the scenario that emerges from our analysisis one where the two ammonia cores pre-date the arrival of the ionisationfront. since its arrival the over-pressure of the ionised gas at the surface ofthe cloud has driven shocks into the surface layers of the cloud. thepropagation of these shocks through core a have triggered the formation of asmall cluster of massive stars, however, the shock front has not yet propagateddeeply enough into the cloud to have affected the evolution of core b.

0810.2619	an investigation on the morphological evolution of bright-rimmed clouds	a new radiative driven implosion (rdi) model based on smoothed particlehydrodynamics (sph) technique is developed and applied to investigate themorphological evolutions of molecular clouds under the effect of ionisingradiation. this model self-consistently includes the self-gravity of the cloudin the hydrodynamical evolution, the uv radiation component in the radiationtransfer equations, the relevant heating and cooling mechanisms in the energyevolution and a comprehensive chemical network. the simulation results revealthat under the effect of ionising radiation, a molecular cloud may evolvethrough different evolutionary sequences. dependent on its initialgravitational state, the evolution of a molecular cloud does not necessarilyfollow a complete morphological evolution sequence from type a to b to c, asdescribed by previous rdi models. when confronted with observations, thesimulation results provide satisfactory physical explanations for a series ofpuzzles derived from bright-rimmed clouds (brcs) observations. the consistencyof the modelling results with observations shows that the self-gravity of amolecular cloud should not be neglected in any investigation on the dynamicalevolution of molecular clouds when they are exposed to ionising radiation.
