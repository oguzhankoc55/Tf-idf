0902.0371	simulations of baryon acoustic oscillations ii: covariance matrix of the  matter power spectrum	we use 5000 cosmological n-body simulations of 1(gpc/h)^3 box for theconcordance lcdm model in order to study the sampling variances of nonlinearmatter power spectrum. we show that the non-gaussian errors can be importanteven on large length scales relevant for baryon acoustic oscillations (bao).our findings are (1) the non-gaussian errors degrade the cumulativesignal-to-noise ratios (s/n) for the power spectrum amplitude by up to a factorof 2 and 4 for redshifts z=1 and 0, respectively. (2) there is littleinformation on the power spectrum amplitudes in the quasi-nonlinear regime,confirming the previous results. (3) the distribution of power spectrumestimators at bao scales, among the realizations, is well approximated by agaussian distribution with variance that is given by the diagonal covariancecomponent. (4) for the redshift-space power spectrum, the degradation in s/n bynon-gaussian errors is mitigated due to nonlinear redshift distortions. (5) foran actual galaxy survey, the additional shot noise contamination compromisesthe cosmological information inherent in the galaxy power spectrum, but alsomitigates the impact of non-gaussian errors. the s/n is degraded by up to 30%for a wfmos-type survey. (6) the finite survey volume causes additionalnon-gaussian errors via the correlations of long-wavelength fluctuations withthe fluctuations we want to measure, further degrading the s/n values by about30% even at high redshift z=3.

0903.1103	locuss: subaru weak lensing study of 30 galaxy clusters	(abridged) we use subaru data to conduct a detailed weak-lensing study of thedark matter distribution in a sample of 30 x-ray luminous galaxy clusters at0.15&lt;z&lt;0.3. a weak-lensing signal is detected at high statistical significancein each cluster, the total detection s/n ranging from 5 to 13. in this paper weconcentrate on fitting spherical models to the tangential distortion profilesof the clusters. when the models are fitted to the clusters individually, weare unable to discriminate statistically between sis and nfw models. howeverwhen the tangential distortion profiles of the individual clusters arecombined, and models fitted to the stacked profile, the sis model is rejectedat 6- and 11-sigma, respectively, for low- and high-mass bins. we also use theindividual cluster nfw model fits to investigate the relationship betweencluster mass (m_vir) and concentration (c_vir), finding an anti-correlation ofc_vir and m_vir. the best-fit c_vir-m_vir relation is: c_vir(m_vir) proptom_vir^{-alpha} with alpha=0.41+/-0.19 -- i.e. a non-zero slope is detected at2sigma significance. we then investigate the optimal radius within which tomeasure cluster mass, finding that the typical fractional errors are improvedto sigma(m_delta)/m_delta ~ 0.1-0.2 for cluster masses at higher over-densitiesdelta=500-2000, from 0.2-0.3 for the virial over-density (~110). furthercomparisons between mass measurements based on spherical model fitting and themodel-independent aperture mass method reveal that the 2d aperture massenclosed within a cylinder of a given aperture radius is systematically greaterthan the 3d spherical mass obtained from nfw model fitting: m_2d/m_3d= 1.34 and1.40 for delta=500 and 110, respectively. the amplitude of this effect agreeswell with that predicted by integrating the nfw model along the line-of-sight.

0906.2237	simulations of wide-field weak lensing surveys i: basic statistics and  non-gaussian effects	we study the lensing convergence power spectrum and its covariance for astandard lcdm cosmology. we run 400 cosmological n-body simulations and use theoutputs to perform a total of 1000 independent ray-tracing simulations. wecompare the simulation results with analytic model predictions. thesemi-analytic model based on smith et al.(2003) fitting formula underestimatesthe convergence power by ~30% at arc-minute angular scales. for the convergencepower spectrum covariance, the halo model reproduces the simulation resultsremarkably well over a wide range of angular scales and source redshifts. thedominant contribution at small angular scales comes from the sample variancedue to the number fluctuations of halos in a finite survey volume. thesignal-to-noise ratio for the convergence power spectrum is degraded by thenon-gaussian covariances by up to a factor 5 for a weak lensing survey to z_s~1. the probability distribution of the convergence power spectrum estimators,among the realizations, is well approximated by a chi-square distribution withbroadened variance given by the non-gaussian covariance, but has a largerpositive tail. the skewness and kurtosis have non-negligible values especiallyfor a shallow survey. we argue that a prior knowledge on the full distributionmay be needed to obtain an unbiased estimate on the ensemble averaged bandpower at each angular scale from a finite volume survey.

0907.2922	nonlinear power spectrum in the presence of massive neutrinos:  perturbation theory approach, galaxy bias and parameter forecasts	future or ongoing galaxy redshift surveys can put stringent constraints onneutrinos masses via the high-precision measurements of galaxy power spectrum,when combined with cosmic microwave background (cmb) information. in this paperwe develop a method to model galaxy power spectrum in the weakly nonlinearregime for a mixed dark matter (cdm plus finite-mass neutrinos) model, based onperturbation theory (pt) whose validity is well tested by simulations for a cdmmodel. in doing this we carefully study various aspects of the nonlinearclustering and then arrive at a useful approximation allowing for a quickcomputation of the nonlinear power spectrum as in the cdm case. the nonlineargalaxy bias is also included in a self-consistent manner within the ptframework. thus the use of our pt model can give a more robust understanding ofthe measured galaxy power spectrum as well as allow for higher sensitivity toneutrino masses due to the gain of fourier modes beyond the linear regime.based on the fisher matrix formalism, we find that boss or stage-iii typesurvey, when combined with planck cmb information, gives a precision of totalneutrino mass constraint, sigma(m_nu,tot) 0.1ev, while stage-iv type survey mayachieve sigma(m_nu,tot) 0.05ev, i.e. more than a 1-sigma detection of neutrinomasses. we also discuss possible systematic errors on dark energy parameterscaused by the neutrino mass uncertainty. the significant correlation betweenneutrino mass and dark energy parameters is found, if the information on powerspectrum amplitude is included. more importantly, for stage-iv type survey, abest-fit dark energy model may be biased and falsely away from the underlyingtrue model by more than the 1-sigma statistical errors, if neutrino mass isignored in the model fitting.

0912.1381	non-gaussian error contribution to likelihood analysis of the matter  power spectrum	we study the sample variance of the matter power spectrum for the standardlambda cold dark matter universe. we use a total of 5000 cosmological n-bodysimulations to study in detail the distribution of best-fit cosmologicalparameters and the baryon acoustic peak positions. the obtained distribution iscompared with the results from the fisher matrix analysis with and withoutincluding non-gaussian errors. for the fisher matrix analysis, we compute thederivatives of the matter power spectrum with respect to cosmologicalparameters using directly full nonlinear simulations. we show that thenon-gaussian errors increase the unmarginalized errors by up to a factor 5 fork_{max}=0.4h/mpc if there is only one free parameter provided other parametersare well determined by external information. on the other hand, formulti-parameter fitting, the impact of the non-gaussian errors is significantlymitigated due to severe parameter degeneracies in the power spectrum. thedistribution of the acoustic peak positions is well described by a gaussiandistribution, with its width being consistent with the statistical intervalpredicted from the fisher matrix. we also examine systematic bias in thebest-fit parameter due to the non-gaussian errors. the bias is found to besmaller than the 1 sigma statistical error for both the cosmological parametersand the acoustic scale positions.

0912.1460	a dipole anisotropy of galaxy distribution: does the cmb rest-frame  exist in the local universe?	the peculiar motion of the earth causes a dipole anisotropy modulation in thedistant galaxy distribution due to the aberration effect. however, theamplitude and angular direction of the effect is not necessarily the same asthose of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) dipole anisotropy due to thegrowth of cosmic structures. in other words exploring the aberration effect maygive us a clue to the horizon-scale physics perhaps related to the cosmicacceleration. in this paper we develop a method to explore the dipole angularmodulation from the pixelized galaxy data on the sky properly taking intoaccount the covariances due to the shot noise and the intrinsic galaxyclustering contamination as well as the partial sky coverage. we applied themethod to the galaxy catalogs constructed from the sloan digital sky survey(sdss) data release 6 data. after constructing the four galaxy catalogs thatare different in the ranges of magnitudes and photometric redshifts to studypossible systematics, we found that the most robust sample against systematicsindicates no dipole anisotropy in the galaxy distribution. this finding isconsistent with the expectation from the concordance lambda-dominated cold darkmatter model. finally we argue that an almost full-sky galaxy survey such aslsst may allow for a significant detection of the aberration effect of the cmbdipole having the precision of constraining the angular direction to ~ 20degrees in radius. assuming a hypothetical lsst galaxy survey, we find thatthis method can confirm or reject the result implied from a stacked analysis ofthe kinetic sunyaev-zel'dovich effect of x-ray luminous clusters in kashlinskyet al. (2008,2009) if the implied cosmic bulk flow is not extended out to thehorizon.

1002.2476	a clipping method to mitigate the impact of catastrophic photometric  redshift errors on weak lensing tomography	we use the mock catalog of galaxies, constructed based on the cosmos galaxycatalog including information on photometric redshifts (photo-z) and sed typesof galaxies, in order to study how to define a galaxy subsample suitable forweak lensing tomography feasible with optical (and nir) multi-band data. sincemost of useful cosmological information arises from the sample variance limitedregime for upcoming lensing surveys, a suitable subsample can be obtained bydiscarding a large fraction of galaxies that have less reliable photo-zestimations. we develop a method to efficiently identify photo-z outliers bymonitoring the width of posterior likelihood function of redshift estimationfor each galaxies. this clipping method may allow to obtain clean tomographicredshift bins (here three bins considered) that have almost no overlaps betweendifferent bins, by discarding more than 70% galaxies of ill-defined photo-z'scorresponding to the number densities of remaining galaxies less than 20 persquare arcminutes for a subaru-type deep survey. restricting the ranges ofmagnitudes and redshifts and/or adding near infrared data help obtain a cleanerredshift binning. by using the fisher information matrix formalism, wepropagate photo-z errors into biases in the dark energy equation of stateparameter w. we found that, by discarding most of ill-defined photo-z galaxies,the bias in w can be reduced to the level comparable to the marginalizedstatistical error, however, the residual, small systematic bias remains due toasymmetric scatters around the relation between photometric and true redshifts.we also use the mock catalog to estimate the cumulative signal-to-noise (s/n)ratios for measuring the angular cross-correlations of galaxies between finnerphoto-z bins, finding the higher s/n values for photo-z bins including photo-zoutliers.

1004.4214	direct measurement of dark matter halo ellipticity from two-dimensional  lensing shear maps of 25 massive clusters	we present new measurements of dark matter distributions in 25 x-ray luminousclusters by making a full use of the two-dimensional (2d) weak lensing signalsobtained from high-quality subaru/suprime-cam imaging data. our approach todirectly compare the measured lensing shear pattern with elliptical modelpredictions allows us to extract new information on the mass distributions ofindividual clusters, such as the halo ellipticity and mass centroid. we findthat these parameters on the cluster shape are little degenerate with clustermass and concentration parameters. by combining the 2d fitting results for asubsample of 18 clusters, the elliptical shape of dark matter haloes isdetected at 7\sigma significance level. the mean ellipticity is found to be e =0.46 \pm 0.04 (1\sigma), which is in excellent agreement with the standardcollisionless cdm model prediction. the mass centroid can be constrained with atypical accuracy of ~20" (~50 kpc/h) in radius for each cluster with somesignificant outliers, enabling to assess one of the most important systematicerrors inherent in the stacked cluster weak lensing technique, the masscentroid uncertainty. in addition, the shape of the dark mass distribution isfound to be only weakly correlated with that of the member galaxy distribution.we carefully examine possible sources of systematic errors in our measurements,finding none of them to be significant. our results demonstrate the power ofhigh-quality imaging data for exploring the detailed spatial distribution ofdark matter (abridged).

1006.4845	neutrino mass constraint with the sloan digital sky survey power  spectrum of luminous red galaxies and perturbation theory	we compare the model power spectrum, computed based on perturbation theory(pt) with the power spectrum of luminous red galaxies (lrg) measured from thesdssdr7 catalog, assuming a flat, cdm-dominated cosmology. the model includesthe effects of massive neutrinos, nonlinear matter clustering and nonlinear,scale-dependent galaxy bias in a self-consistent manner. we first test theaccuracy of pt-model by comparing the model predictions with the halo powerspectrum in real- and redshift-space measured from simulations without massiveneutrinos. we show that the pt-model with bias parameters being properlyadjusted can fairly well reproduce the simulation results. as a result thebest-fit parameters obtained from the hypothetical parameter fitting recover,within statistical uncertainties, the input cosmological parameters insimulations, including an upper bound on neutrino mass, if the power spectruminformation up to k~0.15h/mpc is used. however, for the redshift-space powerspectrum, the best-fit cosmological parameters show a sizable bias from theinput values if using the information up to k~0.2h/mpc, probably due tononlinear redshift distortion effect. given these tests, we decided, as aconservative choice, to use the lrg power spectrum up to k=0.1h/mpc in order tominimize possible unknown nonlinearity effects. in combination with the recentresults from wilkinson microwave background anisotropy probe (wmap), we derivea robust upper-bound on the sum of neutrino masses, given as m_nu,tot &lt; 0.81ev(95% c.l.), marginalized over other parameters including nonlinear biasparameters and dark energy equation of state parameter. the neutrino mass limitis improved by a factor of 1.85 compared to the limit from the wmap5 alone,m_nu,tot &lt; 1.5ev.

1103.3614	likelihood reconstruction method of real-space density and velocity  power spectra from a redshift galaxy survey	we develop a maximum likelihood based method of reconstructing band powers ofthe density and velocity power spectra at each wavenumber bins from themeasured clustering features of galaxies in redshift space, includingmarginalization over uncertainties inherent in the fingers-of-god (fog) effect.the reconstruction can be done assuming that the density and velocity powerspectra depend on the redshift-space power spectrum having different angularmodulations of mu with mu^{2n} (n=0,1,2) and that the model fog effect is givenas a multiplicative function in the redshift-space spectrum. by using n-bodysimulations and the halo catalogs, we test our method by comparing thereconstructed power spectra with the simulations. for the spectrum of mu^0 orequivalently the density power spectrum p_dd(k), our method recovers theamplitudes to a few percent accuracies up to k=0.3 h/mpc for both dark matterand halos. for the power spectrum of mu^2, which is equivalent to thedensity-velocity spectrum p_dv(k) in the linear regime, our method can recoverthe input power spectrum for dark matter up to k=0.2 h/mpc and at both z=0 and1, if using the adequate fog model. however, for the halo spectrum, thereconstructed spectrum shows greater amplitudes than the simulation p_dv(k). weargue that the disagreement is ascribed to nonlinearity effect that arises fromthe cross-bispectra of density and velocity perturbations. using theperturbation theory, we derive the nonlinear correction term, and find that theleading-order correction term is proportional to mu^2 and increases themu^2-power spectrum amplitudes at larger k, at lower redshifts and for moremassive halos. we find that adding the nonlinearity correction term to thesimulation p_dv(k) can fairly well reproduce the reconstructed p_dv(k) forhalos up to k~0.2 h/mpc.

1106.1640	using galaxy-galaxy weak lensing measurements to correct the  finger-of-god	for decades, cosmologists have been using galaxies to trace the large-scaledistribution of matter. at present, the largest source of systematicuncertainty in this analysis is the challenge of modeling the complexrelationship between galaxy redshift and the distribution of dark matter. ifall galaxies sat in the centers of halos, there would be minimal finger-of-god(fog) effects and a simple relationship between the galaxy and matterdistributions. however, many galaxies, even some of the luminous red galaxies(lrgs), do not lie in the centers of halos. because the galaxy-galaxy lensingis also sensitive to the off-centered galaxies, we show that we can use thelensing measurements to determine the amplitude of this effect and to determinethe expected amplitude of fog effects. we develop an approach for using thelensing data to model how the fog suppresses the power spectrum amplitudes andshow that the current data implies a 30% suppression at wavenumber k=0.2h/mpc.our analysis implies that it is important to complement a spectroscopic surveywith an imaging survey with sufficient depth and wide field coverage. jointimaging and spectroscopic surveys allow a robust, unbiased use of the powerspectrum amplitude information: it improves the marginalized error of growthrate fg=dln d/dln a by up to a factor of 2 over a wide range of redshiftsz&lt;1.4. we also find that the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, w0, andthe neutrino mass, fnu, can be unbiasedly constrained by combining the lensinginformation, with an improvement of 10--25% compared to a spectroscopic surveywithout lensing calibration.

1107.5115	locuss: the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect and weak lensing mass scaling  relation	we present the first weak-lensing-based scaling relation between galaxycluster mass, m_wl, and integrated compton parameter y_sph. observations of 18galaxy clusters at z~0.2 were obtained with the subaru 8.2-m telescope and thesunyaev-zel'dovich array. the m_wl-y_sph scaling relations, measured atdelta=500, 1000, and 2500 rho_c, are consistent in slope and normalization withprevious results derived under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium (hse).we find an intrinsic scatter in m_wl at fixed y_sph of 20%, larger than bothprevious measurements of m_hse-y_sph scatter as well as the scatter in truemass at fixed y_sph found in simulations. moreover, the scatter in ourlensing-based scaling relations is morphology dependent, with 30-40% largerm_wl for undisturbed compared to disturbed clusters at the same y_sph at r_500.further examination suggests that the segregation may be explained by theinability of our spherical lens models to faithfully describe thethree-dimensional structure of the clusters, in particular, the structure alongthe line-of-sight. we find that the ellipticity of the brightest clustergalaxy, a proxy for halo orientation, correlates well with the offset in massfrom the mean scaling relation, which supports this picture. this providesempirical evidence that line-of-sight projection effects are an importantsystematic uncertainty in lensing-based scaling relations.

1207.6322	information content of weak lensing power spectrum and bispectrum:  including the non-gaussian error covariance matrix	we address the amount of information in the non-gaussian regime of weaklensing surveys by modelling all relevant covariances of the power spectra andbispectra, using 1000 ray-tracing simulation realizations for a lambda-cdmmodel and an analytical halo model. we develop a formalism to describe thecovariance matrices of power spectra and bispectra of all triangleconfigurations. in addition to the known contributions which extend up tosix-point correlation functions, we propose a new contribution `the halo samplevariance (hsv)' arising from the coupling of the lensing fourier modes withlarge-scale mass fluctuations on scales comparable with the survey region viahalo bias theory. we show that the model predictions are in good agreement withthe simulation once we take the hsv into account. the hsv gives a dominantcontribution to the covariance matrices at multipoles l &gt; 10^3, which arisesfrom massive haloes with a mass of &gt; 10^14 solar mass and at relatively lowredshifts z &lt; 0.4. since such haloes are easily identified from a multi-colourimaging survey, the effect can be estimated from the data. by adding thebispectrum to the power spectrum, the total information content or thecumulative signal-to-noise ratio up to a certain maximum multipole of a few10^3 is improved by 20--50 per cent, which is equivalent to a factor of1.4--2.3 larger survey area for the power spectrum measurement alone. however,it is still smaller than the case of a gaussian field by a factor of 3 mostlydue to the hsv. thus bispectrum measurements are useful for cosmology, butusing information from upcoming surveys requires that non-gaussian covariancesare carefully estimated.

1209.4643	subaru weak-lensing measurement of a z = 0.81 cluster discovered by the  atacama cosmology telescope survey	we present a subaru weak lensing measurement of act-cl j0022.2-0036, one ofthe most luminous, high-redshift (z=0.81) sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) clustersdiscovered in the 268 deg^2 equatorial region survey of the atacama cosmologytelescope. for the weak lensing analysis using i'-band images, we use amodel-fitting (gauss-laguerre shapelet) method to measure shapes of galaxyimages, where we fit galaxy images in different exposures simultaneously toobtain best-fit ellipticities taking into account the different psfs in eachexposure. we also take into account the astrometric distortion effect on galaxyimages by performing the model fitting in the world coordinate system. toselect background galaxies behind the cluster at z=0.81, we use photometricredshift (photo-z) estimates for every galaxy derived from the co-added imagesof multi-passband br'i'z'y, with psf matching/homogenization. after a photo-zcut for background galaxy selection, we detect the tangential weak lensingdistortion signal with a total signal-to-noise ratio of about 3.7. by fitting anavarro-frenk-white model to the measured shear profile, we find the clustermass to be m_200\bar{\rho}_m = [7.5^+3.2_-2.8(stat.)^+1.3_-0.6(sys.)] x 10^14m_\odot/h. the weak lensing-derived mass is consistent with previous massestimates based on the sz observation, with assumptions of hydrostaticequilibrium and virial theorem, as well as with scaling relations between szsignal and mass derived from weak lensing, x-ray, and velocity dispersion,within the measurement errors. we also show that the existence of act-clj0022.2-0036 at z=0.81 is consistent with the cluster abundance prediction ofthe \lambda-dominated cold dark matter structure formation model. we thusdemonstrate the capability of subaru-type ground-based images for studying weaklensing of high-redshift clusters.

1211.1009	where are the luminous red galaxies (lrgs)? using correlation  measurements and lensing to relate lrgs to dark matter halos	nonlinear redshift-space distortions, the finger-of-god (fog) effect, cancomplicate the interpretation of the galaxy power spectrum. here, wedemonstrate the method proposed by hikage et al. (2012) to use complimentaryobservations to directly constrain this effect on the data. we use catalogs ofluminous red galaxies (lrgs) and photometric galaxies from the sdss dr7 tomeasure the redshift-space power spectrum of lrgs, the cross-correlation oflrgs with the shapes of background photometric galaxies (galaxy-galaxy weaklensing), and the projected cross-correlation of lrgs with photometric galaxieshaving similar photometric redshifts to the lrg spectroscopic redshift. all ofthese measurements use a reconstructed halo field. while we use the position ofeach lrg for single lrg systems, we compare the measurements using differenthalo-center proxies for multiple-lrg systems (4.5 per cent of all the halos):the brightest lrg position (blrg), the faintest lrg position (flrg) and theirarithmetical mean position (mean), respectively, in each system. we findsignificant differences in the measured correlations of different centers,showing consistent off-centering effects in the three observables. by comparingthe measurements with a halo model that treats the satellite photometricgalaxies as being distributed according to a generalized nfw profile, we findthat about 40 (70) per cent of blrgs (flrgs) are off-centered satellitegalaxies in the multiple-lrg systems. the satellite lrgs have typicaloff-centering radius of about 400 kpc/h, and velocity dispersion of about 500km/s in host halos with a mean mass of 1.6x10^14 ms/h. we show that, if lrgs inthe single lrg systems have similar offsets, the residual fog contamination inthe lrg power spectrum can be significant at k&gt;0.1 h/mpc, which may cause abias in cosmological parameters such as the neutrino mass.

1211.7077	understanding the nature of luminous red galaxies (lrgs): connecting  lrgs to central and satellite subhalos	we develop a novel abundance matching method to construct a mock catalog ofluminous red galaxies (lrgs) in sdss, using catalogs of halos and subhalos inn-body simulations for a lcdm model. motivated by observations suggesting thatlrgs are passively-evolving, massive early-type galaxies with a typical age&gt;5gyr, we assume that simulated halos at z=2 (z2-halo) are progenitors forlrg-host subhalos observed today, and we label the most tightly bound particlesin each progenitor z2-halo as lrg ``stars''. we then identify the subhaloscontaining these stars to z=0.3 (sdss redshift) in descending order of themasses of z2-halos until the comoving number density of the matched subhalosbecomes comparable to the measured number density of sdss lrgs, n=10^{-4}(h/mpc)^3. once the above prescription is determined, our only free parameteris the number density of halos identified at z=2 and this parameter is fixed tomatch the observed number density at z = 0.3. by tracing subsequent merging andassembly histories of each progenitor z2-halo, we can directly compute, fromthe mock catalog, the distributions of central and satellite lrgs and theirinternal motions in each host halo at z=0.3. while the sdss lrgs are galaxiesselected by the magnitude and color cuts from the sdss images and are notnecessarily a stellar-mass-selected sample, our mock catalog reproduces a hostof sdss measurements: the halo occupation distribution for central andsatellite lrgs, the projected auto-correlation function of lrgs, thecross-correlation of lrgs with shapes of background galaxies (lrg-galaxy weaklensing), and the nonlinear redshift-space distortion effect, the finger-of-godeffect, in the angle-averaged redshift-space power spectrum.

1212.4025	perturbation theory for nonlinear halo power spectrum: the renormalized  bias and halo bias	we revisit an analytical model to describe the halo-matter cross-powerspectrum and the halo auto-power spectrum in the weakly nonlinear regime, bycombining the perturbation theory (pt) for matter clustering, the local biasmodel, and the halo bias. nonlinearities in the power spectra arise from thenonlinear clustering of matter as well as the nonlinear relation between thematter and halo density fields. by using the "renormalization" approach, weexpress the nonlinear power spectra by a sum of the two contributions: thenonlinear matter power spectrum with the effective linear bias parameter, andthe higher-order pt spectra having the halo bias parameters as thecoefficients. the halo auto-power spectrum includes the residual shot noisecontamination that needs to be treated as additional free parameter. theterm(s) of the higher-order pt spectra and the residual shot noise cause ascale-dependent bias function relative to the nonlinear matter power spectrumin the weakly nonlinear regime. we show that the model predictions are in goodagreement with the spectra measured from a suit of high-resolution $n$-bodysimulations up to $k\simeq 0.2 h$/mpc at $z=0.35$, for different halo massbins.

0705.0163	probing dark energy with cluster counts and cosmic shear power spectra:  including the full covariance	(abridged) combining cosmic shear power spectra and cluster counts ispowerful to improve cosmological parameter constraints and/or test inherentsystematics. however they probe the same cosmic mass density field, if the twoare drawn from the same survey region, and therefore the combination may beless powerful than first thought. we investigate the cross-covariance betweenthe cosmic shear power spectra and the cluster counts based on the halo modelapproach, where the cross-covariance arises from the three-point correlationsof the underlying mass density field. fully taking into account thecross-covariance as well as non-gaussian errors on the lensing power spectrumcovariance, we find a significant cross-correlation between the lensing powerspectrum signals at multipoles l~10^3 and the cluster counts containing haloswith masses m&gt;10^{14}msun. including the cross-covariance for the combinedmeasurement degrades and in some cases improves the total signal-to-noiseratios up to plus or minus 20% relative to when the two are independent. forcosmological parameter determination, the cross-covariance has a smaller effectas a result of working in a multi-dimensional parameter space, implying thatthe two observables can be considered independent to a good approximation. wealso discuss that cluster count experiments using lensing-selected mass peakscould be more complementary to cosmic shear tomography than mass-selectedcluster counts of the corresponding mass threshold. using lensing selectedclusters with a realistic usable detection threshold (s/n~6 for a ground-basedsurvey), the uncertainty on each dark energy parameter may be roughly halved bythe combined experiments, relative to using the power spectra alone.

1302.6015	baryon acoustic oscillations with the cross-correlation of spectroscopic  and photometric samples	the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) experiment requires a sufficientlydense sampling of large-scale structure tracers with spectroscopic redshift,which is observationally expensive especially at high redshifts $z\simgt 1$.here we present an alternative route of the bao analysis that uses thecross-correlation of sparse spectroscopic tracers with a much denserphotometric sample, where the spectroscopic tracers can be quasars or bright,rare galaxies that are easier to access spectroscopically. we show thatmeasurements of the cross-correlation as a function of the transverse comovingseparation rather than the angular separation avoid a smearing of the baofeature without mixing the different scales at different redshifts in theprojection, even for a wide redshift slice $\delta z\simeq 1$. the bias,scatter, and catastrophic redshift errors of the photometric sample affect onlythe overall normalization of the cross-correlation which can be marginalizedover when constraining the angular diameter distance. as a specific example, weforecast an expected accuracy of the bao geometrical test via thecross-correlation of the sdss and boss spectroscopic quasar sample with a densephotometric galaxy sample that is assumed to have a full overlap with thesdss/boss survey region. we show that this cross-correlation bao analysisallows us to measure the angular diameter distances to a fractional accuracy ofabout 10% at each redshift bin over $1\simlt z\simlt 3$, if the photometricredshift errors of the galaxies, $\sigma_z/(1+z)$, are better than 10-20%level.

1302.6994	power spectrum super-sample covariance	we provide a simple, unified approach to describing the impact ofsuper-sample covariance, or beat coupling, on power spectrum estimation in afinite-volume survey. for a wide range of survey volumes, the sample variancethat arises from modes that are larger than the survey dominates the covarianceof power spectrum estimators for modes much smaller than the survey. the deeplynonlinear version of this effect is known as halo sample variance. we show thatall variants are unified by the matter trispectrum of squeezed configurationsand that such configurations obey a consistency relation which relates them tothe response of the power spectrum to a change in the background density. ourmethod also applies to statistics that are based on radial projections of thedensity field such as weak lensing shear. while we use the halo model for ananalytic description to expose the nature of the effect, the consistencydescription enables an accurate calibration of the full effect directly fromsimulations. it also suggests that super-sample covariance may be viewed as anadditional interesting signal rather than excess noise.

1305.5548	modeling the phase-space distribution around massive halos	the comparison between dynamical mass and lensing mass provides a targetedtest for a wide range of modified gravity models. in our previous paper weshowed, through numerical simulations, that the measurement of theline-of-sight velocity dispersion around stacked massive clusters whose lensingmasses are known allows for stringent constraints on modified gravity on scalesof 2 - 15 mpc/h. in this work we develop a semi-analytical approach based onthe halo model to describe the phase-space distribution and the line-of-sightvelocity dispersion for different tracers. the model distinguishescontributions from the halo pairwise velocity and the virial velocity withinhalos. we also discuss observational complications, in particular thecontribution from hubble flow, and show how our model can incorporate thesecomplications. we then incorporate the effects of modified gravity(specifically, f(r) and braneworld models), and show that the model predictionsare in excellent agreement with modified gravity simulations. more broadly, thephase-space distribution provides a sensitive test of our understanding ofhierarchical structure formation when confronted with observations via thismodel.

1306.4684	cosmological parameters from weak lensing power spectrum and bispectrum  tomography: including the non-gaussian errors	we re-examine a genuine power of weak lensing bispectrum tomography forconstraining cosmological parameters, when combined with the power spectrumtomography, based on the fisher information matrix formalism. to account forthe full information at two- and three-point levels, we include all the powerspectrum and bispectrum information built from all-available combinations oftomographic redshift bins, multipole bins and different triangle configurationsover a range of angular scales (up to lmax=2000 as our fiducial choice). forthe parameter forecast, we use the halo model approach in kayo, takada &amp; jain(2013) to model the non-gaussian error covariances as well as thecross-covariance between the power spectrum and the bispectrum, including thehalo sample variance or the nonlinear version of beat-coupling. we find thatadding the bispectrum information leads to about 60% improvement in the darkenergy figure-of-merit compared to the lensing power spectrum tomography alone,for three redshift-bin tomography and a subaru-type survey probing galaxies attypical redshift of zs~1. the improvement is equivalent to a 1.6 larger surveyarea. thus our results show that the bispectrum or more generally anythree-point correlation based statistics carries complementary information oncosmological parameters to the power spectrum. however, the improvement ismodest compared to the previous claim derived using the gaussian errorassumption, and therefore our results imply less additional information in evenhigher-order moments such as the four-point correlation function.

1307.4399	joint analysis of cluster number counts and weak lensing power spectrum  to correct for the super-sample covariance	a coherent over- or under-density contrast across a finite survey volumecauses an upward- or downward-fluctuation in the observed number of halos. thisfluctuation in halo number adds a significant co-variant scatter in theobserved amplitudes of weak lensing power spectrum at nonlinear, small scales-- the so-called super-sample variance or the halo sample variance. in thispaper, we show that by measuring both the number counts of clusters and thepower spectrum in the same survey region, we can mitigate this loss ofinformation and significantly enhance the scientific return from the upcomingsurveys.  first, using the halo model approach, we derive the cross-correlation betweenthe halo number counts and the weak lensing power spectrum, taking into accountthe super-sample covariance effect, which well matches the distributionsmeasured from 1000 realizations for a lambda-dominated cold dark matter model.then we show that adding the observed number counts of massive halos with m&gt;10^14 ms/h can significantly improve the information content of weak lensingpower spectrum, almost recovering the gaussian information up to lmax~1000, ifthe average mass profiles of the massive halos are known, which can beestimated from stacked lensing. when combined with the halo number counts for m&gt; 3 or 1 x 10^14 ms/h, the improvement is up to a factor of 1.4 or 2 atlmax~1000 --2000, equivalent to a factor 2 or 4 times larger survey volume,compared to the power spectrum measurement alone.

1308.6070	the synergy between weak lensing and galaxy redshift surveys	we study the complementarity of weak lensing (wl) and spectroscopic galaxyclustering (gc) surveys, by forecasting dark energy and modified gravityconstraints for three upcoming survey combinations: sumire (subaru measurementof images and redshifts, the combination of the hyper suprime-cam lensingsurvey and the prime focus spectrograph redshift survey), euclid and wfirst.from the wl surveys, we take into account both the shear and clustering of thesource galaxies and from the gc surveys, we use the three-dimensionalclustering of spectroscopic galaxies, including redshift space distortions. acmb prior is included in all cases. focusing on the large-scale, two-pointfunction information, we find strong synergy between the two probes. the darkenergy figure of merit from wl+gc is up to a factor ~2.5 larger than fromeither probe alone. considering modified gravity, if the growth factor f(z) istreated as a free function, it is very poorly constrained by wl or gc alone,but can be measured at the few percent level by the combination of the two. onthe other hand, for cosmological constraints derived from (angular) powerspectra and considering statistical errors only, it hardly matters whether thesurveys overlap on the sky or not. for instance, the dark energy figure ofmerit for overlapping surveys is at most ~20 % better than in the disjointcase. this modest gain can be traced to the fundamental fact that only a smallfraction of the total number of modes sampled by the gc survey (or by the wlsurvey) contributes to the cross-correlations between wl and gc.

1309.5389	novel probes of gravity and dark energy	the discovery of cosmic acceleration has stimulated theorists to considerdark energy or modifications to einstein's general relativity as possibleexplanations. the last decade has seen advances in theories that go beyondsmooth dark energy -- modified gravity and interactions of dark energy. whilethe theoretical terrain is being actively explored, the generic presence offifth forces and dark sector couplings suggests a set of distinct observationalsignatures. this report focuses on observations that differ from theconventional probes that map the expansion history or large-scale structure.examples of such novel probes are: detection of scalar fields via labexperiments, tests of modified gravity using stars and galaxies in the nearbyuniverse, comparison of lensing and dynamical masses of galaxies and clusters,and the measurements of fundamental constants at high redshift. theobservational expertise involved is very broad as it spans laboratoryexperiments, high resolution astronomical imaging and spectroscopy and radioobservations. in the coming decade, searches for these effects have thepotential for discovering fundamental new physics. we discuss how the searchescan be carried out using experiments that are already under way or with modestadaptations of existing telescopes or planned experiments. the accompanyingpaper on the growth of cosmic structure describes complementary tests ofgravity with observations of large-scale structure.

1311.1480	the weak lensing signal and the clustering of boss galaxies i:  measurements	a joint analysis of the clustering of galaxies and their weak gravitationallensing signal is well-suited to simultaneously constrain the galaxy-haloconnection as well as the cosmological parameters by breaking the degeneracybetween galaxy bias and the amplitude of clustering signal. in a series of twopapers, we perform such an analysis at the highest redshift ($z\sim0.53$) inthe literature using cmass galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey-iii baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey eleventh data release (sdss-iii/boss dr11)catalog spanning 8300~deg$^2$. in this paper, we present details of theclustering and weak lensing measurements of these galaxies. we define asubsample of 400,916 cmass galaxies based on their redshifts and stellar massestimates so that the galaxies constitute an approximately volume-limited andsimilar population over the redshift range $0.47\le z\le 0.59$. we obtain asignal-to-noise ratio $s/n\simeq 56$ for the galaxy clustering measurement. wealso explore the redshift and stellar mass dependence of the clustering signal.for the weak lensing measurement, we use existing deeper imaging data from thecfhtls with publicly available shape and photometric redshift catalogs fromcfhtlens, but only in a 105~deg$^2$ area which overlaps with boss. thisrestricts the lensing measurement to only 5,084 cmass galaxies. after carefulsystematic tests, we find a highly significant detection of the cmass weaklensing signal, with total $s/n\simeq 26$. these measurements form the basis ofthe halo occupation distribution and cosmology analysis presented in more etal.

1401.0385	super-sample covariance in simulations	using separate universe simulations, we accurately quantify super-samplecovariance (ssc), the typically dominant sampling error for matter powerspectrum estimators in a finite volume, which arises from the presence of supersurvey modes. by quantifying the power spectrum response to a background mode,this approach automatically captures the separate effects of beat coupling inthe quasilinear regime, halo sample variance in the nonlinear regime and a newdilation effect which changes scales in the power spectrum coherently acrossthe survey volume, including the baryon acoustic oscillation scale. it modelsthese effects at typically the few percent level or better with a handful ofsmall volume simulations for any survey geometry compared with directly usingmany thousands of survey volumes in a suite of large volume simulations. thestochasticity of the response is sufficiently small that in the quasilinearregime, ssc can be alternately included by fitting the mean density in thevolume with these fixed templates in parameter estimation. we also test thehalo model prescription and find agreement typically at better than the 10%level for the response.

1405.2666	an optimal survey geometry of weak lensing survey: minimizing  super-sample covariance	upcoming wide-area weak lensing surveys are expensive both in time and costand require an optimal survey design in order to attain maximum scientificreturns from a fixed amount of available telescope time. the super-samplecovariance (ssc), which arises from unobservable modes that are larger than thesurvey size, significantly degrades the statistical precision of weak lensingpower spectrum measurement even for a wide-area survey. using the 1000 mockrealizations of the log-normal model, which approximates the weak lensing fieldfor a $\lambda$-dominated cold dark matter model, we study an optimal surveygeometry to minimize the impact of ssc contamination. for a continuous surveygeometry with a fixed survey area, a more elongated geometry such as arectangular shape of 1:400 side-length ratio reduces the ssc effect and allowsfor a factor 2 improvement in the cumulative signal-to-noise ratio ($s/n$) ofpower spectrum measurement up to $\ell_{\rm max}\simeq $ a few $10^3$, comparedto compact geometries such as squares or circles. when we allow the surveygeometry to be disconnected but with a fixed total area, assuming $1\times 1$sq. degrees patches as the fundamental building blocks of survey footprints,the best strategy is to locate the patches with $\sim 15$ degrees separation.this separation angle corresponds to the scale at which the two-pointcorrelation function has a negative minimum. the best configuration allows fora factor 100 gain in the effective area coverage as well as a factor 2.5improvement in the $s/n$ at high multipoles, yielding a much wider coverage ofmultipoles than in the compact geometry.

1406.3330	joint likelihood function of cluster counts and $n$-point correlation  functions: improving their power through including halo sample variance	naive estimates of the statistics of large scale structure and weak lensingpower spectrum measurements that include only gaussian errors exaggerate theirscientific impact. non-linear evolution and finite volume effects are bothsignificant sources of non-gaussian covariance that reduce the ability of powerspectrum measurements to constrain cosmological parameters. using a halo modelformalism, we derive an intuitive understanding of the various contributions tothe covariance and show that our analytical treatment agrees with simulations.this approach enables an approximate derivation of a joint likelihood for thecluster number counts, the weak lensing power spectrum and the bispectrum. weshow that this likelihood is a good description of the ray-tracing simulation.since all of these observables are sensitive to the same finite volume effectsand contain information about the non-linear evolution, a combined analysisrecovers much of the "lost" information and obviates the non-gaussiancovariance. for upcoming weak lensing surveys, we estimate that a jointanalysis of power spectrum, number counts and bispectrum will produce animprovement of about $30-40\%$ in determinations of the matter density and thescalar amplitude. this improvement is equivalent to doubling the survey area.

1408.1081	super-sample signal	when extracting cosmological information from power spectrum measurements, wemust consider the impact of super-sample density fluctuations whose wavelengthsare larger than the survey scale. these modes contribute to the mean densityfluctuation $\delta_b$ in the survey and change the power spectrum in the sameway as a change in the cosmological background. they can be simply included incosmological parameter estimation and forecasts by treating $\delta_b$ as anadditional cosmological parameter enabling efficient exploration of its impact.to test this approach, we consider here an idealized measurement of the matterpower spectrum itself in the $\lambda$cdm cosmology though our techniques canreadily be extended to more observationally relevant statistics or otherparameter spaces. using sub-volumes of large-volume $n$-body simulations forpower spectra measured with respect to either the global or local mean density,we verify that the minimum variance estimator of $\delta_b$ is both unbiasedand has the predicted variance. parameter degeneracies arise since the responseof the matter power spectrum to $\delta_b$ and cosmological parameters sharesimilar properties in changing the growth of structure and dilating the scaleof features especially in the local case. for matter power spectrummeasurements, these degeneracies can lead in certain cases to substantial errordegradation and motivates future studies of specific cosmological observablessuch as galaxy clustering and weak lensing statistics with these techniques.

1504.01413	detection of universality of dark matter profile from subaru weak  lensing measurements of 50 massive clusters	we develop a novel method of measuring the lensing distortion profiles ofclusters with stacking the scaled amplitudes of background galaxy ellipticitiesas a function of the scaled centric radius according to the nfw prediction ofeach cluster, based on the assumption that the different clusters in a samplefollow the universal nfw profile. first we demonstrate the feasibility of thismethod using both the analytical nfw model and simulated halos inhigh-resolution $n$-body simulations. we then apply, as a proof of concept,this method to the subaru weak lensing data and the xmm/chandra x-rayobservables for a sample of 50 massive clusters in the redshift range $0.15\lez\le 0.3$, where their halo masses range over an order of magnitude. toestimate the nfw parameters of each cluster, we use the halo mass proxyrelation of x-ray observables, based on either the hydrostatic equilibrium orthe gas mass, and then infer the halo concentration from the model $c(m)$relation. we evaluate a performance of the nfw scaling analysis by measuringthe scatters of 50 cluster lensing profiles relative to the nfw predictionsover a range of radii, $0.14\le r/[h^{-1}{\rm mpc}]\le 2.8$. we found a 4 -6$\sigma$ level evidence of the universal nfw profile in 50 clusters, for boththe x-ray halo mass proxy relations, although the gas mass appears to be abetter proxy of the underlying true mass. by comparing the measurements withthe simulations of cluster lensing taking into account the statistical errorsof intrinsic galaxy shapes in the subaru data, we argue that additional halomass errors or intrinsic scatters of $\sigma_{\ln m_{500c}}\sim 0.2$ - $0.3$could reconcile a difference between the measurements and the simulations.

1504.06974	properties of weak lensing clusters detected on hyper suprime-cam 2.3  square degree field	we present properties of moderately massive clusters of galaxies detected bythe newly developed hyper suprime-cam on the subaru telescope using weakgravitational lensing. eight peaks exceeding a s/n ratio of 4.5 are identifiedon the convergence s/n map of a 2.3 square degree field observed during theearly commissioning phase of the camera. multi-color photometric data is usedto generate optically selected clusters using the camira algorithm. the opticalcluster positions were correlated with the peak positions from the convergencemap. all eight significant peaks have optical counterparts. the velocitydispersion of clusters are evaluated by adopting the singular isothemal sphere(sis) fit to the tangential shear profiles, yielding virial mass estimates,m500c, of the clusters which range from 2.7x10^13 to 4.4x10^14 solar mass. thenumber of peaks is considerably larger than the average number expected fromlambdacdm cosmology but this is not extremely unlikely if one takes the largesample variance in the small field into account. we could, however, safelyargue that the peak count strongly favours the recent planck result suggestinghigh sigma8$value of 0.83. the ratio of stellar mass to the dark matter halomass shows a clear decline as the halo mass increases. if the gas massfraction, fg, in halos is universal, as has been suggested in the literature,the observed baryon mass in stars and gas shows a possible deficit comparedwith the total baryon density estimated from the baryon oscillation peaks inanisotropy of the cosmic microwave background.

1508.02469	geometrical constraint on curvature with bao experiments	the spatial curvature ($k$ or $\omega_k$) is one of the most fundamentalparameters of an isotropic and homogeneous universe and has a close link to thephysics of the early universe. combining the radial and angular diameterdistances measured via the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) experiments allowsus to unambiguously constrain the curvature. the method is primarily based onthe metric theory, but is less sensitive to the theory of structure formationother than the existence of the bao scale and is free of any model of darkenergy. in this paper, we estimate a best achievable accuracy of constrainingthe curvature with the bao experiments. we show that an all-sky,cosmic-variance-limited galaxy survey covering the universe up to $z&gt; 4$enables a precise determination of the curvature to an accuracy of$\sigma(\omega_k)\simeq 10^{-3}$. when we assume a model of dark energy -either the cosmological constraint or the $(w_0,w_a)$ model - it can achieve aprecision of $\sigma(\omega_k)\simeq \mbox{a few}\times 10^{-4}$. theseforecasts require a high sampling density of galaxies, and are degraded by upto a factor of a few for a survey with a finite number density of $\sim10^{-3}(h/{\rm mpc})^3$.

astro-ph;0008377	detectability of gravitational lensing effect on the two-point  correlation function of hotspots in the cmb maps	we present quantitative investigations of the weak lensing effect on thetwo-point correlation functions of local maxima (hotspots),  $\xipk(\theta)$, in the cosmic microwave background (cmb) maps. the lensingeffect depends on the projected mass fluctuations between today and theredshift $z_{\rm rec}\approx1100$. if adopting the gaussian assumption for theprimordial temperature fluctuations field, the peak statistics can provide anadditional information about the intrinsic distribution of hotspots that thosepairs have some characteristic separation angles. the weak lensing thenredistributes hotspots in the observed cmb maps from the intrinsic distributionand consequently imprints non-gaussian signatures onto $\xipk(\theta)$.especially, since the intrinsic $\xipk(\theta)$ has a pronounced depressionfeature around the angular scale of $\theta\approx 70'$ for a flat universe,the weak lensing induces a large smoothing at the scale. we show that thelensing signature therefore has an advantage to effectively probe massfluctuations with large wavelength modes around $\lambda\approx 50 h^{-1}{\rmmpc}$. to reveal the detectability, we performed numerical experiments withspecifications of {\em map} and {\em planck surveyor} including theinstrumental effects of beam smoothing and detector noise. it is then foundthat our method can successfully provide constraints on amplitude of the massfluctuations and cosmological parameters in a flat universe with and withoutcosmological constant, provided that we use maps with 65% sky coverage expectedfrom planck.

astro-ph;0101449	lensing-induced non-gaussian signatures in the cosmic microwave  background	we propose a new method for extracting the non-gaussian signatures on theisotemperature statistics in the cosmic microwave background (cmb) sky, whichis induced by the gravitational lensing due to the intervening large-scalestructure of the universe. to develop the method, we focus on a specificstatistical property of the intrinsic gaussian cmb field; a field point in themap that has a larger absolute value of the temperature threshold tends to havea larger absolute value of the curvature parameter defined by a trace of secondderivative matrix of the temperature field, while the ellipticity parametersimilarly defined is uniformly distributed independently of the thresholdbecause of the isotropic nature of the gaussian field. the weak lensing thencauses a stronger distortion effect on the isotemperature contours with higherthreshold and especially induces a coherent distribution of the ellipticityparameter correlated with the threshold as a result of the coupling between thecmb curvature parameter and the gravitational tidal shear in the observed map.these characteristic patterns can be statistically picked up by consideringthree independent characteristic functions, which are obtained from theaverages of quadratic combinations of the second derivative fields of cmb overisotemperature contours with each threshold. consequently, we find that thelensing effect generates non-gaussian signatures on those functions that have adistinct functional dependence of the threshold. we test the method usingnumerical simulations of cmb maps and show that the lensing signals can bemeasured definitely, provided that we use cmb data with sufficiently low noiseand high angular resolution.

astro-ph;0110313	on the cross-correlation between dark matter distribution and secondary  cmb anisotropies by ionized intergalactic medium	we investigate a cross-correlation between the weak gravitational lensingfield of the large-scale structure, $\kappa$, and the secondary temperaturefluctuation field, $\delta$, of cosmic microwave background (cmb) induced bythomson scattering of cmb photons off the ionized medium in the mildlynonlinear structure. the cross-correlation is expected to observationallyunveil the biasing relation between the dark matter and ionized mediumdistributions in the large-scale structure. we develop a formalism forcalculating the cross-correlation function and its angular power spectrum basedon the small angle approximation. as a result, we find that leadingcontribution to the cross-correlation comes from the secondary cmb fluctuationfield induced by the quadratic doppler effects of the bulk velocity field $v$of ionized medium. the magnitude of the cross-correlation can be estimated as$\kaco{\kappa\delta}\sim 10^{-10}$ on small angular scales ($l\simgt 1000$)under the currently favored cold cdm model of the structure formation and thesimplest scenario of homogeneous reionization after a given redshift of $z_{\rmion}\simgt 5$. interestingly, we find that the density-modulated quadraticdoppler effect of $o(\delta_e v^2)$ produces the cross-correlation with theweak lensing field that has {\em linear} dependence on the electron densityfluctuation field $\delta_e$ or equivalently on the biasing relation betweenthe dark matter and electron distributions. in other words, the angular powerspectrum could be both positive or negative, depending on the positive biasingor antibiasing, respectively. detection of the cross-correlation thus offers anew opportunity to observationally understand the reionization history ofintergalactic medium connected to the dark matter clustering.

astro-ph;0112412	faraday rotation effect of intracluster magnetic field on cosmic  microwave background polarization	the observed magnetic field of microgauss strength in clusters of galaxiesshould induce the faraday rotation effect on the linearly polarized cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) radiation when the cmb radiation propagates througha cluster at low redshift. employing the press-schechter prescription for thecluster abundance under the cold dark matter (cdm) scenario and a plausibleisothermal $\beta$-model for the gas distribution, we compute angular powerspectra of the cmb polarization fields including the faraday rotation mixingeffect under the simple assumption of uniform magnetic field configurationacross a cluster. as a result, we find that a parity-odd b-type polarizationpattern is statistically generated on the observed sky, even when the primarypolarization only contains the parity-even e-mode component, such as in thecase of pure scalar perturbations. the generated b-type polarization has a peakwith amplitude of $\sim0.1 \mu{\rm k}(b_0/0.1 \mu{\rm g})(\nu_0/10 {\rmghz})^{-2}$ at angular scales of $l\approx 1000$ for the currently favoredadiabatic $\lambda$cdm model. this result also implies that, if the magneticfield has a $0.5 \mu{\rm g}$ strength and we observe at lower frequencies suchas $\nu_0\simlt 5 {\rm ghz}$, the secondary signal due to the faraday rotationeffect could be comparable to the magnitude of the primary polarization. thefrequency dependence of the faraday rotation can be then used to discriminatethe effect from primary and other secondary signals on the cmb polarizations.our results therefore offer a new empirical opportunity to measure or constrainthe intracluster magnetic field in the average sense.

astro-ph;0205055	the kurtosis of the cosmic shear field	we study the fourth-order moment of the cosmic shear field using the darkmatter halo approach to describe the nonlinear gravitational evolution ofstructure in the universe. since the third-order moment of the shear fieldvanishes because of symmetry, non-gaussian signatures in its one-pointstatistics emerge at the fourth-order level. we argue that the shear kurtosisparameter s_4 = &lt;gamma^4&gt;/&lt;gamma^2&gt;^3 may be more directly applicable torealistic data than the well-studied higher-order statistics of the convergencefield, since obtaining the convergence requires a non-local reconstruction fromthe measured shear field.  we compare our halo model predictions for the variance, skewness and kurtosisof lensing fields with ray-tracing simulations of cold dark matter models andfind good agreement. the shear kurtosis calculation is made tractable bydeveloping approximations for fast and accurate evaluations of the8-dimensional integrals needed to obtain the kurtosis. we show that on smallscales it is dominated by correlations within halos more massive than 10^14solar masses. the shear kurtosis is sensitive to the mass density parameter ofthe universe, omega, and has relatively weak dependences on other parameters.the approximations we develop for the third- and fourth-order moments allow foraccurate halo model predictions for the 3-dimensional mass distribution aswell. we demonstrate their accuracy in the small scale regime, below 2 mpc,where analytical approaches used in the literature so far cease to be accurate.

astro-ph;0209167	the three-point correlation function in cosmology	with the advent of high-quality surveys in cosmology the full three-pointcorrelation function will be a valuable statistic for describing structureformation models. it contains information on cosmological parameters anddetailed halo properties that cannot be extracted from the two-pointcorrelation function. we use the halo clustering model to analyticallycalculate the three-point correlation function (3pcf) for general cosmologicalfields. we present detailed results for the configuration dependence of the3-dimensional mass and galaxy distributions and the 2-dimensional cosmic shearfield. we work in real space, where higher order correlation functions on smallscales are easier to measure and interpret, but halo model calculations getrapidly intractable. hence we develop techniques for accurate evaluations ofthe 1, 2 and 3-halo contributions to the 3pcf.  the 3pcf violates the hierarchical ansatz in both its scale and configurationdependence. we study the behavior of the coefficient q in the hierarchicalexpansion from large, quasilinear scales down to about 20 kpc. we find that thenonlinear 3pcf is sensitive to the halo profile of massive halos, especiallyits inner slope. we model the distribution of galaxies in halos and show thatthe 3pcf of red galaxies has a weaker configuration and scale dependence thanthe mass, while for blue galaxies it is very sensitive to the parameters of thegalaxy formation model. the 3pcf from weak lensing on the other hand showsdifferent scalings due to projection effects and a sensitivity to cosmologicalparameters.

astro-ph;0210261	the three-point correlation function for spin-2 fields	the three-point correlation function (3pcf) of the spin-2 fields, the cosmicshear and cosmic microwave background polarization fields, is a statisticalmeasure of non-gaussian signals. at each vertex of a triangle, the shear fieldhas two independent components. the resulting eight possible 3pcfs wererecently investigated by schneider &amp; lombardi (2002) and zaldarriaga &amp;scoccimarro (2002). using rotation and parity transformations they addressedthe question: how many non-zero components for the shear 3pcf exist? we addressthis question using an analytical model and measurements from ray-tracingsimulations. we show that all the eight 3pcfs are generally non-zero and havecomparable amplitude. these eight 3pcfs can be used to improve thesignal-to-noise from survey data and their configuration dependence can be usedto separate the contribution from e and b-modes. we estimate thesignal-to-noise for measuring the shear 3pcf from weak lensing surveys usingsimulated maps that include the noise due to intrinsic ellipticities. a deeplensing survey with area exceeding 10 square degrees would allow for thedetection of the shear 3pcfs, but a survey area of order 100 square degrees isneeded for accurate measurements.

astro-ph;0304034	three-point correlations in weak lensing surveys: model predictions and  applications	we use the halo model of clustering to compute two- and three-pointcorrelation functions for weak lensing, and apply them in a new statisticaltechnique to measure properties of massive halos. we present analytical resultson the eight shear three-point correlation functions constructed usingcombination of the two shear components at each vertex of a triangle. wecompare the amplitude and configuration dependence of the functions withray-tracing simulations and find excellent agreement for different scales andmodels. these results are promising, since shear statistics are easier tomeasure than the convergence. in addition, the symmetry properties of the shearthree-point functions provide a new and precise way of disentangling thelensing e-mode from the b-mode due to possible systematic errors.  we develop an approach based on correlation functions to measure theproperties of galaxy-group and cluster halos from lensing surveys. shearcorrelations on small scales arise from the lensing matter within halos of massm &gt; 10^13 solar masses. thus the measurement of two- and three-pointcorrelations can be used to extract information on halo density profiles,primarily the inner slope and halo concentration. we demonstrate thefeasibility of such an analysis for forthcoming surveys. we include covariancesin the correlation functions due to sample variance and intrinsic ellipticitynoise to show that 10% accuracy on profile parameters is achievable withsurveys like the cfht legacy survey, and significantly better with futuresurveys. our statistical approach is complementary to the standard approach ofidentifying individual objects in survey data and measuring their properties.

astro-ph;0305381	halo model prediction of the cosmic magnification statistics: the full  non-linear contribution	the lensing magnification effect due to large-scale structure isstatistically measurable by correlation of size fluctuations in distant galaxyimages as well as by the qso-galaxy cross-correlation. we use the halo modelformulation of takada &amp; jain (2003) to compute these magnification-inducedcorrelations without employing the weak lensing approximation, mu=1+2kappa. ourpredictions thus include the full contribution from non-linear magnificationthat is due to lensing halos. we compare the model prediction with ray-tracingsimulations and find excellent agreement over a range of angular scales(0.'5&lt;theta&lt;30').  the non-linear magnification contribution enhances the amplitude of themagnification correlation relative to the weak lensing approximation, and thenon-linear correction is more significant on smaller angular scales and forsources at higher redshifts. the enhancement amounts to 10-25% on arcminitescales for the qso-galaxy cross-correlation, even after inclusion of arealistic model of galaxy clustering within the host halo. therefore, it isnecessary to account for the non-linear contribution in theoretical models inorder to make an unbiased, cosmological interpretation of the precisemeasurements expected from forthcoming massive surveys.

astro-ph;0310125	cosmological parameters from lensing power spectrum and bispectrum  tomography	we examine how lensing tomography with the bispectrum and power spectrum canconstrain cosmological parameters and the equation of state of dark energy. ouranalysis uses the full information at the two- and three-point level fromangular scales of a few degrees to 5 arcminutes (50 &lt; l &lt; 3000), which will beprobed by lensing surveys. we use all triangle configurations, cross-powerspectra and bispectra constructed from up to three redshift bins withphotometric redshifts, and relevant covariances in our analysis.  we find that the parameter constraints from bispectrum tomography arecomparable to those from power spectrum tomography. combining the two improvesparameter accuracies by a factor of three due to their complementarity. for thedark energy parameterization w(a) = w0 + wa(1-a), the marginalized errors fromlensing alone are sigma(w0) = 0.03 fsky^{-1/2} and sigma(wa) = 0.1 fsky^{-1/2}.we show that these constraints can be further improved when combined withmeasurements of the cosmic microwave background or type ia supernovae. theamplitude and shape of the mass power spectrum are also shown to be preciselyconstrained. we use hyper-extended perturbation theory to compute the nonlinearlensing bispectrum for dark energy models. accurate model predictions of thebispectrum in the moderately nonlinear regime, calibrated with numericalsimulations, will be needed to realize the parameter accuracy we haveestimated. finally, we estimate how well the lensing bispectrum can constrain amodel with primordial non-gaussianity.

astro-ph;0310607	searching for massive clusters in weak lensing surveys	we explore the ability of weak lensing surveys to locate massive clusters. weuse both analytic models of dark matter halos and mock weak lensing surveysgenerated from a large cosmological n-body simulation. the analytic modelsdescribe average properties of weak lensing halos and predict the numbercounts, enabling us to compute an effective survey selection function. we testthe model prediction for the peak number counts in weak lensing mass mapsagainst the mock numerical data, and find that the noise due to intrinsicgalaxy ellipticities causes a systematic effect which increases the peakcounts. we develop a correction scheme for the systematic effect in anempirical manner, and show that, after the correction, the model predictionagrees well with the mock data. the mock data is also used to examine thecompleteness and efficiency of the weak lensing halo search with fully takinginto account the noise and the projection effect by large-scale structures. weshow that the detection threshold of s/n=4-5 gives an optimal balance betweencompleteness and efficiency. our results suggest that, for a weak lensingsurvey with a galaxy number density of ng=30/arcmin^2 with a mean redshift z=1,the mean number of peaks in the 10sq deg area is n_peak=62 for a detectionthreshold s/n=4. the contamination rate is 42%, and thus, on average, 36 out of62 peaks (at least) are signals from real halos. weak lensing surveys thusprovide a reasonably efficient way to searching for massive clusters.

astro-ph;0505452	can the steep mass profile of a1689 be explained by a triaxial dark  halo?	the steep mass profile of a1689 derived from recent detailed lensingobservations is not readily reconciled with the low concentration halospredicted by the standard cdm model. however, halo triaxiality may act to biasthe profile constraints derived assuming a spherically symmetric massdistribution, since lensing relates only to the projected mass distribution. adegree of halo triaxiality is inherent to the cdm structure formation, arisingfrom the collision-less nature of the dark matter. here we compare thecdm-based model predictions of triaxial halo with the precise lensingmeasurements of a1689 based on the acs/hst and subaru data, over a wide rangeof 10kpc&lt;r&lt;2mpc. the model lensing profiles cover the intrinsic spread of halomass and shape, and are projected over all inclinations when comparing with thedata. we show that the model parameters are only weakly constrained andstrongly degenerate mainly because of the lack of information along the line ofsight. in particular, the limits on the concentration parameter become lessrestrictive with increasing triaxiality. yet, by comparing the obtainedconstraints with expected probability distributions for the axis ratio andconcentration parameters computed from numerical simulations, we find that ~6%of cluster-size halos in the cdm model can match the a1689 lensing observationsat the 2-sigma level, corresponding to cases where the major-axis of the halois aligned with the line of sight. thus halo triaxiality could reduce theapparent discrepancy between theory and observation. this hypothesis needs tobe further explored by a statistical lensing study for other clusters as wellas by complementary three-dimensional information derived using x-ray,kinematics, and sz effect observations.

astro-ph;9901079	how is the local-scale gravitational instability influenced by the  surrounding large-scale structure formation?	we develop the formalism to investigate the relation between the evolution ofthe large-scale (quasi) linear structure and that of the small-scale nonlinearstructure in newtonian cosmology within the lagrangian framework. in doing so,we first derive the standard friedmann expansion law using the averagingprocedure over the present horizon scale. then the large-scale (quasi) linearflow is defined by averaging the full trajectory field over a large-scaledomain, but much smaller than the horizon scale. the rest of the fulltrajectory field is supposed to describe small-scale nonlinear dynamics. weobtain the evolution equations for the large-scale and small-scale parts of thetrajectory field. these are coupled to each other in most general situations.  it is shown that if the shear deformation of fluid elements is ignored in theaveraged large-scale dynamics, the small-scale dynamics is described bynewtonian dynamics in an effective friedmann-robertson-walker (frw) backgroundwith a local scale factor. the local scale factor is defined by the sum of theglobal scale factor and the expansion deformation of the averaged large-scaledisplacement field. this means that the evolution of small-scale fluctuationsis influenced by the surrounding large-scale structure through the modificationof frw scale factor. the effect might play an important role in the structureformation scenario. furthermore, it is argued that the so-called {\itoptimized} or {\it truncated} lagrangian perturbation theory is a goodapproximation in investigating the large-scale structure formation up to thequasi nonlinear regime, even when the small-scale fluctuations are in thenon-linear regime.

0810.4170	the impact of non-gaussian errors on weak lensing surveys	the weak lensing power spectrum carries cosmological information via itsdependence on the growth of structure and on geometric factors. since much ofthe cosmological information comes from scales affected by nonlinearclustering, measurements of the lensing power spectrum can be degraded bynon-gaussian covariances. recently there have been conflicting studies aboutthe level of this degradation. we use the halo model to estimate it and includenew contributions related to the finite size of lensing surveys, followingrimes and hamilton's study of 3d simulations. we find that non-gaussiancorrelations between different multipoles can degrade the cumulativesignal-to-noise for the power spectrum amplitude by up to a factor of 2 (or 5for a worst-case model that exceeds current n-body simulation predictions).however, using an eight-parameter fisher analysis we find that the marginalizederrors on individual parameters are degraded by less than 10% (or 20% for theworst-case model). the smaller degradation in parameter accuracy is primarilybecause: individual parameters in a high-dimensional parameter space aredegraded much less than the volume of the full fisher ellipsoid; lensinginvolves projections along the line of sight, which reduce the non-gaussianeffect; some of the cosmological information comes from geometric factors whichare not degraded at all. we contrast our findings with those of lee &amp; pen(2008) who suggested a much larger degradation in information content. finally,our results give a useful guide for exploring survey design by giving thecosmological information returns for varying survey area, depth and the levelof some systematic errors.
