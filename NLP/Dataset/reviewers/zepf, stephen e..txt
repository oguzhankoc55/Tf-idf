0910.5475	the m31 globular cluster system: ugriz and k-band photometry and  structural parameters	we present an updated catalogue of m31 globular clusters (gcs) based onimages from the wide field camera (wfcam) on the uk infrared telescope and fromthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss). our catalogue includes new,self-consistent ugriz and k-band photometry of these clusters. we discuss thedifficulty of obtaining accurate photometry of clusters projected against m31due to small scale background structure in the galaxy. we consider the effectof this on the accuracy of our photometry and provide realistic photometricerror estimates. we investigate possible contamination in the current m31 gccatalogues using the excellent spatial resolution of these wfcam imagescombined with the sdss multicolour photometry. we identify a large populationof clusters with very blue colours. most of these have recently been proposedby other work as young clusters. we distinguish between these, and oldclusters, in the final classifications. our final catalogue includes 416 oldclusters, 156 young clusters and 373 candidate clusters. we also investigatethe structure of m31's old gcs using previously published king model fits tothese wfcam images. we demonstrate that the structure and colours of m31's oldgc system are similar to those of the milky way. one gc (b383) is found to besignificantly brighter in previous observations than observed here. weinvestigate all of the previous photometry of this gc and suggest that thisvariability appears to be genuine and short lived. we propose that the largeincrease in its luminosity my have been due to a classical nova in the gc atthe time of the previous observations in 1989.

0708.1166	global properties of the globular cluster systems of four spiral  galaxies	we present results from a wide-field imaging study of the globular cluster(gc) systems of a sample of edge-on, sb-sc spiral galaxies ~7-20 mpc away. thisstudy is part of a larger survey of the ensemble properties of the gcpopulations of giant galaxies. we imaged the galaxies in bvr filters withlarge-format ccd detectors on the wiyn 3.5-m telescope, to projected radii of~20-40 kpc. for four galaxies (ngc 2683, ngc 3556, ngc 4157, and ngc 7331), wequantify the radial distributions of the gc systems and estimate the totalnumber, luminosity- and mass-normalized specific frequencies (s_n and t), andblue (metal-poor) fraction of gcs. a fifth galaxy (ngc 3044) was apparently toodistant for us to have detected its gc system. our s_n for ngc 2683 is 2.5times smaller than the previously-published value, likely due in part toreduced contamination from non-gcs. for the spiral galaxies analyzed for thesurvey to date, the average number of gcs is 170+/-40 and the weighted meanvalues of s_n and t are 0.8+/-0.2 and 1.4+/-0.3. we use the survey data toderive a relationship between radial exent of the gc system and host galaxymass over a factor of 20 in mass. finally, we confirm the trend, identified inprevious survey papers, of increasing specific frequency of metal-poor gcs withincreasing galaxy mass. we compare the data with predictions from a simplemodel and show that carefully quantifying the numbers of metal-poor gcs ingalaxies can constrain the formation redshifts of the gcs and their hostgalaxies.

1006.0449	a systematic study of low mass x-ray binaries in the m31 globular  cluster system	we investigate low mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs) in the m31 globular cluster(gc) system using data from the 2xmmi catalogue. these x-ray data are based onall publicly available xmm-newton observations of the galaxy. this new surveyprovides the most complete and homogeneous x-ray survey of m31's gcs to date,covering &gt;80% of the confirmed old clusters in the galaxy. we associate 41x-ray sources with confirmed old clusters in the m31 cluster catalogue ofpeacock et al. (2010). comparing these data with previous surveys of m31, it isfound that three of these clusters are newly identified, including a brighttransient source in the cluster b128. four additional clusters, that are notdetected in these 2xmmi data, have previously been associated with x-raysources from chandra or rosat observations. including these clusters, weidentify 45 clusters in m31 which are associated with x-ray emission. byconsidering the latest optical gc catalogues, we identify that three of thepreviously proposed x-ray clusters are likely to be background galaxies and twohave stellar profiles. we consider the properties of lmxb-hosting clusters andconfirm significant trends between the presence of an lmxb and the metallicity,luminosity and stellar collision rate of a cluster. we consider therelationship between the luminosity and stellar collision rate of a cluster andnote that lmxb hosting clusters have higher than average stellar collisionrates for their mass. our findings strongly suggest that the stellar collisionrate is the dominant parameter related to the presence of lmxbs. this isconsistent with the formation of lmxbs in gcs through dynamical interactions.

1007.4768	a variable black hole x-ray source in a ngc 1399 globular cluster	we have discovered an accreting black hole (bh) in a spectroscopicallyconfirmed globular cluster (gc) in ngc 1399 through monitoring of its x-rayactivity. the source, with a peak luminosity of l_x=2x10^39 ergs/s, reveals anorder of magnitude change in the count rate within ~10 ks in a chandraobservation. the bh resides in a metal-rich [fe/h]~0.2 globular cluster. afterrz2109 in ngc 4472 this is only the second black-hole x-ray source in a gcconfirmed via rapid x-ray variability. unlike rz2109, the x-ray spectrum ofthis bh source did not change during the period of rapid variability. inaddition to the short-term variability the source also exhibits long-termvariability. after being bright for at least a decade since 1993 within a spanof 2 years it became progressively fainter, and eventually undetectable, ormarginally detectable, in deep chandra and xmm observations. the source alsobecame harder as it faded. the characteristics of the long term variability initself provide sufficient evidence to identify the source as a bh. the longterm decline in the luminosity of this object was likely not recognized inprevious studies because the rapid variability within the bright epochsuppressed the average luminosity in that integration. the hardening of thespectrum accompanying the fading would also make this black hole sourceindistinguishable from an accreting neutron star in some epochs. therefore somelow mass x-ray binaries identified as ns accretors in snapshot studies ofnearby galaxies may also be bhs. thus the discovery of the second confirmed bhin an extragalactic gc through rapid variability at the very least suggeststhat accreting bhs in gcs are not exceedingly rare occurences.

1009.2827	fading of the x-ray flux from the black hole in the ngc 4472 globular  cluster rz 2109	we present the results of new x-ray observations of xmmu 122939.7+075333, theblack hole (bh) in the globular cluster rz 2109 in the virgo cluster galaxy ngc4472. a combination of non-detections and marginal detections in several recentswift and chandra observations show that the source has varied by at least afactor of 20 in the past 6 years, and that the variations seem not just to be"flickering." this variation could be explained with changes in the absorptioncolumn intrinsic to the source no larger than those which were previously seennear the peak of the 1989 outburst of the galactic bh x-ray binary v404 cyg.the large amplitude variations are also a natural expectation from ahierarchical triple system with kozai cycles -- the mechanism recently proposedto produce bh-white dwarf (wd) binaries in globular clusters. on the otherhand, variation by such a large factor on timescales of years, rather thancenturies, is very difficult to reconcile with the scenario in which the x-rayemission from xmmu 122939.7+075333 is due to fallback of material from atidally destroyed or detonated wd.

0709.3103	[oiii] 5007 emission from the black-hole x-ray binary in a ngc 4472  globular cluster	we present the discovery of [oiii] 5007 emission associated with the blackhole x-ray binary recently identified in a globular cluster in the virgoelliptical galaxy ngc 4472. this object is the first confirmed black-hole x-raybinary in a globular cluster. the identification of [oiii] 5007 emission fromthe black-hole hosting globular cluster is based on two independent fiberspectra obtained at the vlt with flames, which cover a wavelength range of5000-5800 angstrom at a spectral resolution of about 6000. in each of thesespectra we find an emission line at 5031.2 angstrom with an uncertainty ofseveral tenths of an angstrom. these are consistent with [oiii] 5007 emissionat the 1475 +/- 7 km/s radial velocity of the globular cluster previouslydetermined from an analysis of its absorption lines. this agreement within thesmall uncertainties argues strongly in favor of the interpretation of the lineas [oiii] 5007 emission from the black-hole hosting globular cluster. we alsofind that the emission line most likely has a velocity width of several hundredkm/s. such a velocity width rules out a planetary nebula explanation for the[oiii] 5007 emission and implicates the black hole as the source of the powerdriving the nebular emission.

1105.1755	gemini/gmos imaging of globular cluster systems in five early-type  galaxies	this paper presents deep high quality photometry of globular cluster (gc)systems belonging to five early-type galaxies covering a range of mass andenvironment. photometric data were obtained with the gemini north and geminisouth telescopes in the filter passbands g', r', and i'. the combination ofthese filters with good seeing conditions allows an excellent separationbetween gc candidates and unresolved field objects. bimodal gc colourdistributions are found in all five galaxies. most of the gc systems appearbimodal even in the (g' -r') vs (r' -i') plane. a population ofresolved/marginally resolved gc and ultra compact dwarf candidates was found inall the galaxies. a search for the so-called "blue tilt" in thecolour-magnitude diagrams reveals that ngc 4649 clearly shows that phenomenonalthough no conclusive evidence was found for the other galaxies in the sample.this "blue tilt" translates into a mass-metallicity relation given by z \proptom^0.28\pm0.03 . this dependence was found using a new empirical (g' -i') vs[z/h] relation which relies on an homogeneous sample of gc colours andmetallicities. this paper also explores the radial trends in both colour andsurface density for the blue (metal-poor) and red (metal-rich) gcsubpopulations. as usual, the red gcs show a steeper radial distribution thanthe blue ones. evidence of galactocentric colour gradients is found in some ofthe gc systems, being more significant for the two s0 galaxies in the sample.red gc subpopulations show similar colours and gradients to the galaxy halostars in their inner region. a gc mean colour-galaxy luminosity relation,consistent with [z/h] \propto l_b ^0.26\pm0.08, is present for the red gcs. anestimate of the total gc populations and specific frequency sn values ispresented for ngc 3115, ngc 3379, ngc 3923 and ngc 4649.

1105.2561	probing the gc-lmxb connection in ngc 1399: a wide-field study with hst  and chandra	we present a wide field study of the globular clusters/low mass x-ray binary(lmxb) connection in the giant elliptical ngc1399. the large fov of theacs/wfc, combined with the hst and chandra high resolution, allow us toconstrain the lmxb formation scenarios in elliptical galaxies. we confirm thatngc1399 has the highest lmxb fraction in gcs of all nearby elliptical galaxiesstudied so far, even though the exact value depends on galactocentric distancedue to the interplay of a differential gc vs galaxy light distribution and thegc color dependence. in fact lmxbs are preferentially hosted by bright, red gcsout to $&gt;5 r_{eff}$ of the galaxy light. the finding that gc hosting lmxbsfollow the radial distribution of their parent gc population, argues againstthe hypothesis that the external dynamical influence of the galaxy affects lmxbformation in gcs. on the other hand field lmxbs closely match the host galaxylight, thus indicating that they are originally formed in situ and not insidegcs. we measure gc structural parameters, finding that the lmxb formationlikelihood is influenced independently by mass, metallicity and gcs structuralparameters. in particular the gc central density plays a major role inpredicting which gc host accreting binaries. finally our analysis shows thatlmxbs in gcs are marginally brighter than those in the field, and in particularthe only color-confirmed gc with $l_x&gt;10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ shows novariability, which may indicate a superposition of multiple lmxbs in thesesystems.

1105.3365	testing stellar population synthesis models with sloan digital sky  survey colors of m31's globular clusters	accurate stellar population synthesis models are vital in understanding theproperties and formation histories of galaxies. in order to calibrate and testthe reliability of these models, they are often compared with observations ofstar clusters. however, relatively little work has compared these models in theugriz filters, despite the recent widespread use of this filter set. in thispaper, we compare the integrated colors of globular clusters in the sloandigital sky survey (sdss) with those predicted from commonly used simplestellar population (ssp) models. the colors are based on sdss observations ofm31's clusters and provide the largest population of star clusters withaccurate photometry available from the survey. as such, it is a unique samplewith which to compare ssp models with sdss observations. from this work, weidentify a significant offset between the ssp models and the clusters' g-rcolors, with the models predicting colors which are too red by g-r\sim0.1. thisfinding is consistent with previous observations of luminous red galaxies inthe sdss, which show a similar discrepancy. the identification of this offsetin globular clusters suggests that it is very unlikely to be due to a minoritypopulation of young stars. the recently updated ssp model of maraston &amp;stromback better represents the observed g-r colors. this model is based on theempirical miles stellar library, rather than theoretical libraries, suggestingan explanation for the g-r discrepancy.

1107.4051	velocity structure and variability of [o iii] emission in black hole  host globular cluster rz2109	we present a multi-facility study of the optical spectrum of theextragalactic globular cluster rz2109, which hosts a bright black hole x-raysource. the optical spectrum of rz2109 shows strong and very broad [oiii]\lambda \lambda 4959,5007 emission in addition to the stellar absorptionlines typical of a globular cluster. we use observations over an extendedperiod of time to constrain the variability of these [o iii] emission lines. wefind that the equivalent width of the lines is similar in all of the datasets;the change in l[o iii]\lambda 5007 is \ltsim 10% between the first and lastobservations, which were separated by 467 days. the velocity profile of theline also shows no significant variability over this interval. using a simplegeometric model we demonstrate that the observed [o iii]\lambda 5007 linevelocity structure can be described by a two component model with most of theflux contributed by a bipolar conical outflow of about 1,600 km/s, and theremainder from a gaussian component with a fwhm of several hundred km/s.

0710.3141	clues to globular cluster evolution from multiwavelength observations of  extragalactic systems	we present a study of the globular cluster (gc) systems of nearby ellipticaland s0 galaxies at a variety of wavelengths from the x-ray to the infrared. ouranalysis shows that roughly half of the low mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs), thatare the luminous tracers of accreting neutron star or black hole systems, arein clusters. there is a surprisingly strong correlation between the lmxbfrequency and the metallicity of the gcs, with metal-rich gcs hosting threetimes as many lmxbs as metal-poor ones, and no convincing evidence of acorrelation with gc age so far. in some of the galaxies the lmxb formation ratevaries with gc color even within the red peak of the typical bimodal clustercolor distribution, providing some of the strongest evidence to date that thereare metallicity variations within the metal-rich gc peak as is expected in ahierarchical galaxy formation scenario. we also note that any analysis ofsubtler variations in gc color distributions must carefully account for bothstatistical and systematic errors. we caution that some published gccorrelations, such as the apparent 'blue-tilt' or mass-metallicity effect mightnot have a physical origin and may be caused by systematic observationalbiases.

1204.5800	limits on [oiii] 5007 emission from ngc4472's globular clusters:  constraints on planetary nebulae and ultraluminous black hole x-ray binaries  in globular clusters	we have searched for [oiii] 5007 emission in high resolution spectroscopicdata from flames/giraffe vlt observations of 174 massive globular clusters(gcs) in ngc4472. no planetary nebulae (pne) are observed in these clusters,constraining the number of pne per bolometric luminosity,\alpha&lt;0.8*10^{-7}pn/l_{\odot}. this is significantly lower than the ratepredicted from stellar evolution, if all stars produce pne. comparing ourresults to populations of pne in galaxies, we find most galaxies have a higher\alpha than these gcs (more pne per bolometric luminosity - though some massiveearly-type galaxies do have similarly low \alpha). the low \alpha required inthese gcs suggests that the number of pne per bolometric luminosity does notincrease strongly with decreasing mass or metallicity of the stellarpopulation. we find no evidence for correlations between the presence of knowngc pne and either the presence of low mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs) or thestellar interaction rates in the gcs. this, and the low \alpha observed,suggests that the formation of pne may not be enhanced in tight binary systems.these data do identify one [oiii] emission feature, this is the (previouslypublished) broad [oiii] emission from the cluster rz 2109. this emission isthought to originate from the lmxb in this cluster, which is accreting atsuper-eddington rates. the absence of any similar [oiii] emission from theother clusters favors the hypothesis that this source is a black hole lmxb,rather than a neutron star lmxb with significant geometric beaming of its x-rayemission.

1304.0477	signatures of multiple stellar populations in unresolved extragalactic  globular/ young massive star clusters	we present an investigation of potential signatures of the formation ofmultiple stellar populations in recently formed extragalactic star clusters.all of the galactic globular clusters for which good samples of individualstellar abundances are available show evidence for multiple populations. thisappears to require that multiple episodes of star formation and light elementenrichment are the norm in the history of a globular cluster. we show thatthere are detectable observational signatures of multiple formation events inthe unresolved spectra of massive, young extragalactic star clusters. wepresent the results of a pilot program to search for one of the cleanestsignatures that we identify - the combined presence of emission lines from avery recently formed population and absorption lines from a somewhat olderpopulation. a possible example of such a system is identified in the antennaegalaxies. this source's spectrum shows evidence of two stellar populations withages of 8 myr and 80 myr. further investigation shows that these populationsare in fact physically separated, but only by a projected distance of 59 pc. weshow that the clusters are consistent with being bound and discuss thepossibility that their coalescence could result in a single globular clusterhosting multiple stellar populations. while not the prototypical systemproposed by most theories of the formation of multiple populations in clusters,the detection of this system in a small sample is both encouraging andinteresting. our investigation suggests that expanded surveys of massive youngstar clusters should detect more clusters with such signatures.

0801.4388	the low mass x-ray binary - globular cluster link and its implications	studies of nearby elliptical and s0 galaxies reveal that roughly half of thelow mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs), which are luminous tracers of accretingneutron star or black hole systems, are in clusters. there is a surprisingtendency of lmxbs to be preferentially associated with metal-rich globularclusters (gcs), with metal-rich gcs hosting three times as many lmxbs asmetal-poor ones. there is no convincing evidence of a correlation with gc ageso far. in some galaxies the lmxb formation rate varies with gc color evenwithin the metal-rich peak of the typical bimodal cluster metallicitydistribution. this provides some of the strongest evidence to date that thereare metallicity variations within the metal-rich gc peak, as is expected inhierarchical galaxy formation scenarios. we also note that apparentcorrelations between the interaction rates in gcs and lmxb frequency may not bereliable because of the uncertainties in some gc parameters. we argue in factthat there are considerable uncertainties in the integrated properties of eventhe milky way clusters that are often overlooked.

1401.3405	evidence for a constant imf in early-type galaxies based on their x-ray  binary populations	a number of recent studies have proposed that the stellar initial massfunction (imf) of early type galaxies varies systematically as a function ofgalaxy mass, with higher mass galaxies having bottom heavy imfs. these bottomheavy imfs have more low-mass stars relative to the number of high mass stars,and therefore naturally result in proportionally fewer neutron stars and blackholes. in this paper, we specifically predict the variation in the number ofblack holes and neutron stars based on the power-law imf variation required toreproduce the observed mass-to-light ratio trends with galaxy mass. we thentest whether such variations are observed by studying the field low-mass x-raybinary populations (lmxbs) of nearby early-type galaxies. in these binaries, aneutron star or black hole accretes matter from a low-mass donor star. theirnumber is therefore expected to scale with the number of black holes andneutron stars present in a galaxy. we find that the number of lmxbs per k-bandlight is similar among the galaxies in our sample. these data thereforedemonstrate the uniformity of the slope of the imf from massive stars down tothose now dominating the k-band light, and are consistent with an invariantimf. our results are inconsistent with an imf which varies from akroupa/chabrier like imf for low mass galaxies to a steep power-law imf (withslope $x$=2.8) for high mass galaxies. we discuss how these observationsconstrain the possible forms of the imf variations and how future chandraobservations can enable sharper tests of the imf.

0802.2113	observational constraints on the formation and evolution of globular  cluster systems	this paper reviews some of the observational properties of globular clustersystems, with a particular focus on those that constrain and inform models ofthe formation and dynamical evolution of globular cluster systems. i firstdiscuss the observational determination of the globular cluster luminosity andmass function. i show results from new very deep hst data on the m87 globularcluster system, and discuss how these constrain models of evaporation and thedynamical evolution of globular clusters. the second subject of this review isthe question of how to account for the observed constancy of the globularcluster mass function with distance from the center of the host galaxy. theproblem is that a radial trend is expected for isotropic cluster orbits, andwhile the orbits are observed to be roughly isotropic, no radial trend in theglobular cluster system is observed. i review three extant proposals to accountfor this, and discuss observations and calculations that might determine whichof these is most correct. the final subject is the origin of the very weakmass-radius relation observed for globular clusters. i discuss how thisstrongly constrains how globular clusters form and evolve. i also note that theonly viable current proposal to account for the observed weak mass-radiusrelation naturally affects the globular cluster mass function, and that thesetwo problems may be related.

1403.7227	beyond the brim of the hat: kinematics of globular clusters out to large  radius in the sombrero galaxy	we have obtained radial velocity measurements for 51 new globular clustersaround the sombrero galaxy. these measurements were obtained usingspectroscopic observations from the aaomega spectrograph on theanglo-australian telescope and the hydra spectrograph at wiyn. combined withour own past measurements and velocity measurements obtained from theliterature we have constructed a large database of radial velocities thatcontains a total of 360 confirmed globular clusters. previous studies' analysesof the kinematics and mass profile of the sombrero globular cluster system havebeen constrained to the inner ~9' (~24 kpc or ~5 effective radii), but our newmeasurements have increased the radial coverage of the data, allowing us todetermine the kinematic properties of m104 out to ~15' (~41 kpc or ~9 effectiveradii). we use our set of radial velocities to study the gc system kinematicsand to determine the mass profile and v-band mass-to-light profile of thegalaxy. we find that the v-band mass-to-light ratio increases from 4.5 at thecenter to a value of 20.9 at 41 kpc (~9 effective radii or 15'), which impliesthat the dark matter halo extends to the edge of our available data set. wecompare our mass profile at 20 kpc (~4 effective radii or ~7.4') to the masscomputed from x-ray data and find good agreement. we also use our data to lookfor rotation in the globular cluster system as a whole, as well as in the redand blue subpopulations. we find no evidence for significant rotation in any ofthese samples.

1406.3634	kinematical fingerprints of star cluster early dynamical evolution	we study the effects of the external tidal field on the violent relaxationphase of star clusters dynamical evolution, with particular attention to thekinematical properties of the equilibrium configurations emerging at the end ofthis phase.we show that star clusters undergoing the process of violentrelaxation in the tidal field of their host galaxy can acquire significantinternal differential rotation and are characterized by a distinctive radialvariation of the velocity anisotropy. these kinematical properties are theresult of the symmetry breaking introduced by the external tidal field in thecollapse phase and of the action of the coriolis force on the orbit of thestars. the resulting equilibrium configurations are characterized bydifferential rotation, with a peak located between one and two half-mass radii.as for the anisotropy, similar to clusters evolving in isolation, the systemsexplored in this letter are characterized by an inner isotropic core, followedby a region of increasing radial anisotropy. however for systems evolving in anexternal tidal field the degree of radial anisotropy reaches a maximum in thecluster intermediate regions and then progressively decreases, with the clusteroutermost regions being characterized by isotropy or a mild tangentialanisotropy. young or old but less-relaxed dynamically young star clusters maykeep memory of these kinematical fingerprints of their early dynamicalevolution.

1503.07520	a sluggs and gemini/gmos combined study of the elliptical galaxy m60:  wide-field photometry and kinematics of the globular cluster system	we present new wide-field photometry and spectroscopy of the globularclusters (gcs) around ngc 4649 (m60), the third brightest galaxy in the virgocluster. imaging of ngc 4649 was assembled from a recently-obtained hst/acsmosaic, and new subaru/suprime-cam and archival cfht/megacam data. about 1200sources were followed up spectroscopically using combined observations fromthree multi-object spectrographs: keck/deimos, gemini/gmos and mmt/hectospec.we confirm 431 unique gcs belonging to ngc 4649, a factor of 3.5 larger thanprevious datasets and with a factor of 3 improvement in velocity precision. weconfirm significant gc colour bimodality and find that the red gcs are morecentrally concentrated, while the blue gcs are more spatially extended. weinfer negative gc colour gradients in the innermost 20 kpc and flat gradientsout to large radii. rotation is detected along the galaxy major axis for alltracers: blue gcs, red gcs, galaxy stars and planetary nebulae. we compare theobserved properties of ngc 4649 with galaxy formation models. we find thatformation via a major merger between two gas-poor galaxies, followed bysatellite accretion, can consistently reproduce the observations of ngc 4649 atdifferent radii. we find no strong evidence to support an interaction betweenngc 4649 and the neighbouring spiral galaxy ngc 4647. we identify interestinggc kinematic features in our data, such as counter-rotating subgroups and bumpykinematic profiles, which encode more clues about the formation history of ngc4649.

0805.2952	very broad [o iii]4959,5007 emission from the ngc 4472 globular cluster  rz2109 and implications for the mass of its black hole x-ray source	we present keck lris spectroscopy of the black hole-hosting globular clusterrz2109 in the virgo elliptical galaxy ngc 4472. we find that this object hasextraordinarily broad [oiii]5007 and [oiii]4959 emission lines, with velocitywidths of approximately 2,000 k/ms. this result has significant implicationsfor the nature of this accreting black-hole system and the mass of the globularcluster black hole. we show that the broad [oiii]5007 emission must arise frommaterial driven at high velocity from the black hole system. this is becausethe volume available near the black hole is too small by many orders ofmagnitude to have enough [oiii] emitting atoms to account for the observedl([oiii]5007) at high velocities, even if this volume is filled with oxygen atthe critical density for [oiii]5007. the balmer emission is also weak,indicating the observed [oiii] is not due to shocks. we therefore conclude thatthe [oiii]4959,5007 is produced by photoionization of material driven acrossthe cluster. the only known way to drive significant material at high velocityis for a system accreting mass near or above its eddington limit, whichindicates a stellar mass black hole. since it is dynamically implausible toform an accreting stellar mass black hole system in a globular cluster with anintermediate mass black hole (imbh), it appears this massive globular clusterdoes not have an imbh. we discuss further tests of this conclusion, and itsimplications for the m_bh - m_stellar and m_bh - sigma relations.

1512.06077	the x-ray luminosity function of low mass x-ray binaries in early-type  galaxies, their metal-rich, and metal-poor globular clusters	we present the x-ray luminosity function (xlf) of low mass x-ray binaries(lmxbs) in the globular clusters (gcs) and fields of seven early-typesgalaxies. these galaxies are selected to have both deep chandra observations,which allow their lmxb populations to be observed to x-ray luminosities of$10^{37}-10^{38}$ erg/s, and hst optical mosaics which enable the x-ray sourcesto be separated into field lmxbs, gc lmxbs, and contaminating background andforeground sources. we find that at all luminosities the number of field lmxbsper stellar mass is similar in these galaxies. this suggests that the fieldlmxb populations in these galaxies are not effected by the gc specificfrequency, and that properties such as binary fraction and the stellar initialmass function are either similar across the sample, or change in a way thatdoes not effect the number of lmxbs. we compare the xlf of the field lmxbs tothat of the gc lmxbs and find that they are significantly different with ap-value of $3\times10^{-6}$ (equivalent to 4.7$\sigma$ for a normaldistribution). the difference is such that the xlf of the gc lmxbs is flatterthan that of the field lmxbs, with the gcs hosting relatively more brightsources and fewer faint sources. a comparison of the xlf of the metal-rich andmetal-poor gcs hints that the metal-poor gcs may have more bright lmxbs, butthe difference is not statistically significant.

0808.1053	low mass x-ray binaries and black holes in globular clusters	studies of nearby galaxies reveal that roughly half of their low mass x-raybinary (lmxb) populations are associated with globular clusters (gcs). we haveestablished that the lmxb hosting frequency is correlated to various gcproperties such as mass and metallicity. while the x-ray luminosities of a fewof the brightest lmxbs in gcs are consistent with the accreting object being ablack hole (bh), the only definitive way to distinguish between a black holeand multiple superposed sources in a gc is to detect variability. we havediscovered just such a variable 4x10^39 erg/s black hole x-ray binary in a lowmetallicity globular cluster in the halo of ngc 4472. the change in the x-rayspectrum between the bright and faint epochs suggests that the luminosityvariation is due to eclipsing by a warped accretion disk. the optical spectrumof this source also reveals strong, broad, [o iii] lambda 5007 and [o iii]lambda 4959 emission. an analysis of the x-ray spectrum suggests that the [oiii] lines are produced by the photoionization of a wind driven by a stellarmass black hole accreting mass at or above its eddington luminosity. as it isdynamically implausible to form an accreting stellar mass bh system in a gcwith an intermediate mass bh it appears that this massive globular cluster doesnot harbor an intermediate mass bh. the inferred mass of this bh falls wellbelow the extrapolation of the well known m_bh-sigma and m_bh-m_stellarrelations to this gc. therefore our analysis suggests that not all old, metalpoor stellar systems form black holes consistent with these relations, whichhave been established for much more massive stellar systems.

astro-ph;0107146	some constraints on the formation of globular clusters	we explore the constraints on globular cluster formation provided by theobserved conditions in starbursts where globulars are currently forming, and bythe observed properties of young and old globular clusters. we note that thepressure in the ism of starbursts and mergers implies that molecular clouds inthese environments have radii similar to those of globular clusters. suchmolecular clouds are therefore viable precursors to globular clusters if thestar formation efficiency in the clouds is high. a high star formationefficiency may be a consequence of the high density and associated high bindingenergy and short dynamical timescale of molecular clouds in such environments.we also note that the apparent lack of a mass-radius relationship in young andold globular cluster systems places important constraints on globular clusterformation models. this is because molecular clouds are observed to follow avirial scaling relation between mass and radius. we suggest that a variablestar formation efficiency may weaken or eliminate the mass-radius relation ofmolecular clouds as they fragment to form globular clusters. we attribute theabsence of young globular clusters in the disks of ordinary galaxies such asthe milky way to the relatively low ambient pressures in such systems.

astro-ph;0107297	formation scenarios for globular clusters and their host galaxies	this review focuses on how galaxies and their globular cluster systems form.i first discuss the now fairly convincing evidence that some globular clustersform in galaxy starbursts/mergers. one way these observations are valuable isthey place important constraints on the physics of the formation of globularclusters. moreover, it is natural to associate the typically metal-richclusters forming in mergers with the substantial metal-rich population ofglobulars around ellipticals, thereby implying an important role for galaxymergers in the evolution of elliptical galaxies. i also highlight some newobservational efforts aimed at constraining how and when elliptical galaxiesand their globular cluster systems formed. these include systematic studies ofthe number of globular clusters around galaxies as a function of morphologicaltype, studies of the kinematics of globular cluster populations in ellipticalgalaxies, and a variety of observational programs aimed at constraining therelative ages of globular clusters within galaxies as a function of clustermetallicity. the understanding of the formation of globular cluster systems andtheir host galaxies has grown dramatically in recent years, and the futurelooks equally promising.

astro-ph;0304445	some constraints on the effects of age and metallicity on the low mass  x-ray binary formation rate	we have studied the low mass x-ray binary (lmxb) populations within andoutside globular clusters (gc) in ngc 4365 and ngc 3115. using published ageand metallicity constraints from optical and ir observations of their gcs, wedo not find any evidence for an increase in the lmxb formation rate in theintermediate age cluster population of ngc 4365, as has been proposed in somescenarios of dynamical lmxb formation in gcs. the old, metal-rich, redpopulation of gcs in ngc 3115 on the other hand is {\it at least} three timesas efficient at creating lmxbs as the old, metal-poor, blue clusters. thesedata suggest that the higher formation efficiency of lmxbs in the red gcsubsystems of many galaxies is largely a consequence of their highermetallicity. a comparison of the densities of field lmxbs in different galaxiesdoes not reveal an obvious correlation with the age of the field stars aspredicted by models in which the lmxb formation rate in the field dropsmonotonically with time after an initial burst. this suggests that either asignificant fraction of the field lmxbs are created in gcs and subsequentlyinjected into the field, or the lmxb formation rate has a more complex timeevolution pattern.

astro-ph;0309711	the formation and evolution of star clusters and galaxies	this paper addresses the questions of what we have learned about how and whendense star clusters form, and what studies of star clusters have revealed aboutgalaxy formation and evolution. one important observation is that globularclusters are observed to form in galaxy mergers and starbursts in the localuniverse, which both provides constraints on models of globular clusterformation, and suggests that similar physical conditions existed when mostearly-type galaxies and their globular clusters formed in the past. a secondimportant observation is that globular cluster systems typically have bimodalcolor distributions. this was predicted by merger models, and indicates anepisodic formation history for elliptical galaxies. a third and very recentresult is the discovery of large populations of intermediate age globularclusters in several elliptical galaxies through the use of optical tonear-infrared colors. these provide an important link between young clustersystems observed in starbursts and mergers and old cluster systems. thiscontinuum of ages of the metal-rich globular cluster systems also indicatesthat there is no special age or epoch for the formation of the metal-richglobular clusters, which comprise about half of the cluster population. thepaper concludes with a brief discussion of recent results on the globularcluster - low-mass x-ray binary connection.

astro-ph;0310845	microlensing candidates in m87 and the virgo cluster with the hubble  space telescope	the position of the giant elliptical galaxy m87 at the center of the virgocluster means that the inferred column density of dark matter associated withboth the cluster halo and the galaxy halo is quite large. this system is thusan important laboratory for studying massive dark objects in ellipticalgalaxies and galaxy clusters by gravitational microlensing, stronglycomplementing the studies of spiral galaxy halos performed in the local group.we have performed a microlensing survey of m87 with the wfpc2 instrument on thehubble space telescope. over a period of thirty days, with images taken oncedaily, we discover seven variable sources. four are variable stars of somesort, two are consistent with classical novae, and one exhibits an excellentmicrolensing lightcurve, though with a very blue color implying the somewhatdisfavored possibility of a horizontal branch source being lensed. based onsensitivity calculations from artificial stars and from artificial lightcurves,we estimate the expected microlensing rate. we find that the detection of oneevent is consistent with a dark halo with a 20% contribution of microlensingobjects for both m87 and the virgo cluster, similar to the value found fromobservations in the local group. further work is required to test thehypothesized microlensing component to the cluster.

astro-ph;0701310	a black hole in a globular cluster	globular star clusters contain thousands to millions of old stars packedwithin a region only tens of light years across. their high stellar densitiesmake it very probable that their member stars will interact or collide. therehas been considerable debate about whether black holes should exist in thesestar clusters. some theoretical work suggests that dynamical processes in thedensest inner regions of globular clusters may lead to the formation of blackholes of ~1,000 solar masses. other numerical simulations instead predict thatstellar interactions will eject most or all black holes that form in globularclusters. here we report the x-ray signature of an accreting black hole in aspectroscopically-confirmed globular cluster in the virgo cluster giantelliptical galaxy ngc 4472. this object has an x-ray luminosity of about4*10^39 ergs/sec, making it brighter than any non-black hole object can be inan old stellar population. the x-ray luminosity varies by a factor of 7 in afew hours, ruling out the possibility that the object is several neutron starssuperposed.

astro-ph;0703376	bimodal infrared colors of the m87 globular cluster system: peaks in the  metallicity distribution	the globular cluster (gc) systems of many galaxies reveal bimodal opticalcolor distributions. based on stellar evolutionary models and the bimodalcolors and metallicities of galactic gcs this is thought to reflect anunderlying bimodal metallicity distribution. however, stars at many differentphases of stellar evolution contribute to optical light. the i-h color is amuch cleaner tracer of metallicity because it primarily samples the metallicitysensitive giant branch. therefore, we use deep hst-nicmos h, and wfpc2 opticalobservations, of m87 gcs to study their metallicity distribution. the m87clusters are bimodal in i-h, for which there is no known physical explanationother than a bimodal metallicity distribution. moreover, the two modes definedby the b-i and i-h colors are comprised of roughly the same two sets ofobjects, confirming that optical colors also primarily trace the metallicity.this is inconsistent with a recent suggestion based on one model of metallicityeffects on the horizontal branch that bimodality arises from an underlyingunimodal metallicity distribution due to a specific color-metallicity relation.we also find no discernable variation in the peak colors of the m87 gcs out toroughly 75 kpc due to the declining ratio of red-to-blue gcs, as implied bythis model. similarly, there is no evidence that the bimodal peaks are bluerfor systems with large blue-to-red gc ratio. our observations confirm that theprimary cause of bimodality in cluster systems is an underlying bimodalmetallicity distribution, and not the specific color-metallicity relationshipdefined by this horizontal branch model.

astro-ph;9402001	a recipe for galaxy formation shaun cole	we present a detailed prescription for how galaxy formation can be modelledin hierarchical theories of structure formation. our model incorporates theformation and merging of dark matter halos, the shock heating and radiativecooling of baryonic gas gravitationally confined in these halos, the formationof stars regulated by the energy released by evolving stars and supernovae, themerging of galaxies within dark matter halos, and the spectral evolution of thestellar populations that are formed. the procedure that we describe is veryflexible and can be applied to any hierarchical clustering theory. we explorethe effects of varying the stellar initial mass function, star formation ratesand galaxy merging. the results we compare with an extensive range ofobservational data, including the b and k galaxy luminosity functions, galaxycolours, the tully-fisher relation and galaxy number counts.these data stronglyconstrain the models and enable the relative importance of each of the physicalprocess to be assessed. we present a broadly successful model defined by aplausible choice of parameters. this fiducial model produces a much moreacceptable luminosity function than most previous studies. this is achievedthrough a modest rate of galaxy mergers and strong suppression of starformation in halos of low circular velocity. however, it fails to producegalaxies as red as many observed ellipticals and, compared with the observedtully-fisher relation, the model galaxies have circular velocities which aretoo large. ** uuencoded compressed postscript file containing all text andfigures.**

astro-ph;9411030	constraints on the formation history of the elliptical galaxy ngc 3923  from the colors of its globular clusters	we present a study of the colors of globular clusters associated with theelliptical galaxy ngc 3923. our final sample consists of washington system cand t_1 photometry for 143 globular cluster candidates with an expectedcontamination of no more than 10%. we find that the color distribution of thengc 3923 globular cluster system (gcs) is broad and appears to have at leasttwo peaks. a mixture modeling analysis of the color distribution indicates thata two component model is favored over a single component one at a high level ofconfidence (&gt;99%). this evidence for more than one population in the gcs of ngc3923 is similar to that previously noted for the four other elliptical galaxiesfor which similar data have been published. furthermore, we find that the ngc3923 gcs is redder than the gcss of previously studied elliptical galaxies ofsimilar luminosity. the median metallicity inferred from our (c-t_1)_0 colorsis [fe/h]_{med} = -0.56, with an uncertainty of 0.14 dex arising from allsources of uncertainty in the mean color. this is more metal rich than themedian metallicity found for the gcs of m87 using the same method, [fe/h]_{med}= -0.94. since m87 is more luminous than ngc 3923, this result points tosignificant scatter about any trend of higher gcs metallicity with increasinggalaxy luminosity. we also show that there is a color gradient in the ngc 3923gcs corresponding to about -0.5 dex in delta[fe/h]\delta(log r). we concludethat the shape of the color distribution of individual gcss and the variationin mean color among the gcss of ellipticals are difficult to understand ifelliptical galaxies are formed in a single protogalactic

astro-ph;9503050	spectroscopy of candidate young globular clusters in ngc 1275	we present spectra of the brightest member of the population of compact blueobjects discovered in the peculiar galaxy ngc 1275 by holtzman et al. usinghubble space telescope images. these spectra show strong balmer absorptionlines like those observed in a-type stars, as expected if the object is a youngglobular cluster. the age estimated from the strength of the balmer lines isabout 0.5 gyr, although ages ranging from 0.1 gyr to 0.9 gyr can not beconfidently excluded given current models of stellar populations. if theseestimated ages are adopted for the young cluster population of ngc 1275 as awhole, the fading predicted by stellar populations models gives a luminosityfunction which is consistent with that of the galactic globular cluster systemconvolved with the observational selection function for the ngc 1275 system. wealso use the equivalent widths of the mg $b$ and fe 5270 features to constrainthe metallicity of the young cluster. combining these absorption-line widthswith the age estimates from the balmer lines and stellar population models, wefind a metallicity of roughly solar based on the mg $b$ index and somewhathigher for the fe 5270 index. the radial velocity of the absorption lines ofthe cluster spectrum is offset from the emission lines of the galaxy spectrumat the same position by $-130$ \kms, providing further evidence for theidentification of the object as a globular cluster, and opening up the futurepossibility of studying the kinematics of young cluster systems. the discoveryof objects with the characteristics of young globular clusters in ngc 1275,which shows evidence of a recent interaction or merger, supports the hypothesisthat galaxy interactions and mergers are favorable sites for the formation ofglobular clusters.

astro-ph;9506069	globular cluster systems as distance indicators: metallicity effects on  the luminosity function	we investigate the universality of the globular cluster luminosity function(gclf) and the use of this function as an extragalactic distance indicator.previous studies have found an offset between gclf distances and those obtainedwith other techniques. we show that this offset can be understood in terms of ametallicity effect. specifically, the globular cluster systems used in distancescale studies have traditionally been those around elliptical galaxies. thesesystems have higher mean metallicities than the milky way globular clustersystem. consequently, the peak of the gclf in the systems around ellipticals issignificantly fainter in $b$ and $v$ than the gclf peak in the milky way. wecalculate the shift in the peak of the gclf relative to the milky way globularsin $b$, $v$, $r$, $i$ and $j$ for a range of globular cluster metallicities.applying these corrections, we find good agreement between gclf distances andthose obtained using the surface brightness fluctuations method. the similaritybetween metallicity-corrected gclfs suggests that the underlying mass functionof globular cluster systems is remarkably constant from one galaxy to another.our results allow the gclf to be employed as an improved distance indicator.

astro-ph;9601166	on the effects of bursts of massive star formation during the evolution  of elliptical galaxies	we consider the hypothesis that the formation of elliptical galaxies includesa phase in which star formation is mostly restricted to massive stars, with thebias towards high mass stars increasing with elliptical galaxy mass. the massfraction of stars in this top-heavy mode of star formation is constrained byrequiring the resulting stellar remnants to account for the observed increasein the mass-to-light ratio of ellipticals with increasing galaxy mass. we thenconsider the implications of this population of massive stars for theintracluster medium and the extragalactic background at various wavelengths.the mass and abundance ratios of metals produced by our proposed population ofmassive stars are consistent with the observations of the mass and abundanceratios of metals in the hot gas of galaxy clusters for most of the standardrange of imf slopes and sn ii yields. the predicted energy density produced bythis stellar population approaches current limits on the extragalacticbackground at both optical wavelengths, into which the ultraviolet radiation ofthe massive stars is likely to be redshifted, and far-infared wavelengths, atwhich starlight reprocessed by dust associated with the starburst will beobserved. in either case, the background is predicted to be significantlyclustered since massive ellipticals are clustered.

astro-ph;9606153	keck spectroscopy of objects with lens-like morphologies in the hubble  deep field	we present spectroscopy from the keck telescope of three sets of objects inthe hubble deep field which have lens-like morphologies. in the case ofj123641+621204, which is composed of four objects with similar colors and amean separation of &lt;= 0.8", we find at least two distinct components atredshifts of z=3.209 and z=3.220 which are separated by 0.5" spatially. each ofthese components has narrow ly-alpha emission, and possibly nv emission andsiiv and civ in absorption or with a p-cygni profile. the second case isj123652+621227, which has an arc-like feature offset by 1.8" to the southwestof a red elliptical-like galaxy, and a ``counterimage'' offset 1.4" on theopposite side. we tentatively find a single line at 5301 aa at the spatialposition of the counterimage, and no corresponding emission line at theposition of the arc. the colors of the counterimage are consistent with theidentification of this line as ly-alpha at z=3.36. the colors of the arc aredifferent than those of the counterimage, and thus both the colors and spectraindicate that this object is unlikely to be a gravitational lens. for a thirdlensing candidate (j123656+621221), which is a blue arc offset by 0.9" from ared, elliptical-like galaxy, our spectroscopy does not clearly resolve thesystem spatially, complicating the interpretation of the spectrum. we discusspossible identifications of features in the spectrum, and find thatgravitational lensing remains a possibility in this case. we conclude that thefrequency of strong gravitational lensing by galaxies in the hdf appears to bevery low. this result is difficult to reconcile with the introduction of acosmological constant to account for the large number of faint blue galaxiesvia a large volume element at high redshift.

astro-ph;9707341	the faint end of the luminosity function of galaxies in compact groups	we study the luminosity function of galaxies in hickson groups using ourrecent redshift survey of galaxies in and around 17 of these groups. we findthat the galaxies in these regions have a luminosity function with m* = -19.5 +5 log h, and alpha = -1.0, where m* and alpha are the usual parameters in thestandard schechter form of the luminosity function, and the magnitudes aremeasured in the b band. the formal 95% confidence intervals for m* and alpharange from (-19.3,-0.8), to (-19.7,-1.2) and are highly correlated as is usualfor these fits. this luminosity function for galaxies in our hickson groupsample is very similar from that found in large surveys covering a range ofenvironments. these values are also consistent with our earlier estimates basedon a photometric analysis with statistical background correction, and do notsupport previous suggestions of an underabundance of intrinsically faintgalaxies in compact groups. we confirm our earlier finding that the faintergalaxies are more diffusely distributed within individual groups than thebrighter ones. this can be interpreted either as evidence for mass segregationwithin the groups or as the result of the selection procedure for hicksongroups.

astro-ph;9711355	the absence of passively evolving ellipticals in deep optical and  near-infrared surveys	the traditional view of elliptical galaxies has been that they formed in asingle, rapid burst of star formation at high redshift, and have evolvedquiescently since that time. in opposition to this traditional view is evidencethat at least some elliptical galaxies have formed from the merger of two diskgalaxies. what has not been clear is which process is the dominant formationmechanism for the large majority of elliptical galaxies. this question hassignificant implications for cosmological models, as different models makedifferent predictions for the formation mechanism and epoch of ellipticalgalaxies. here i use deep optical and near-infrared images to show that thereare fewer galaxies with very red optical and near-infrared colors thanpredicted by models in which typical elliptical galaxies have completed theirstar formation by z &gt;= 5. these observations require that elliptical galaxieshave significant star formation at z &lt; 5. this requirement, combined withconstraints on lower redshift starbursts from the modest ultravioletluminosities of galaxies in the hubble deep field and the properties ofgalaxies from 0 &lt; z &lt; 1, suggests that elliptical galaxies form at moderateredshift in dusty starbursts and/or through the hierarchical merging of smallerobjects.

astro-ph;9712206	globular cluster systems of elliptical galaxies	we review the observed properties of globular cluster systems and theirimplications for models of galaxy formation. observations show that globularclusters form in gas-rich mergers, and that bimodal metallicity distributionsare common in the globular cluster systems of ellipticals, with the metal-poorpopulation more extended than the metal-rich one. these are three of the fourpredictions of the simple merger model of ashman &amp; zepf (1992). the fourthprediction concerns the properties of the globular cluster systems of spirals,and is still to be tested by observation. adopting occam's razor, theconfirmation of the fundamental predictions of the merger model from both youngand old globular cluster systems is strong evidence that typical ellipticalgalaxies formed from the mergers of spiral galaxies. however, the simplifyingassumptions of the ashman-zepf merger model limit its applicability to certaincomplex situations such as the formation of cd galaxies. we conclude thisreview by introducing new observational and theoretical programs that willfurther the understanding of the physical mechanisms of globular cluster andgalaxy formation.

astro-ph;9903324	hst imaging of globular clusters in the edge--on spiral galaxies ngc  4565 and ngc 5907	we present a study of the globular cluster systems of two edge-on spiralgalaxies, ngc4565 and ngc5907, from wfpc2 images in the f450w and f814wfilters. the globular cluster systems of both galaxies appear to be similar tothe galactic globular cluster system. in particular, we derive total numbers ofglobular clusters of n_{gc}(4565)= 204+/-38 {+87}{-53} andn_{gc}(5907)=170+/-41 {+47}{-72} (where the first are statistical, the secondpotential systematic errors) for ngc4565 and ngc5907, respectively. thisdetermination is based on a comparison to the milky way system, for which weadopt a total number of globular clusters of 180+/-20. the specific frequencyof both galaxies is s_n~0.6: indistinguishable from the value for the milkyway. the similarity in the globular cluster systems of the two galaxies isnoteworthy since they have significantly different thick disks andbulge-to-disk ratios. this would suggest that these two components do not playa major role in the building up of a globular cluster system around late-typegalaxies.

astro-ph;9904368	a cepheid distance to ngc 4603 in centaurus	in an attempt to use cepheid variables to determine the distance to thecentaurus cluster, we have obtained images of ngc 4603 with the hubble spacetelescope on 9 epochs using wfpc2 and the f555w and f814w filters. this galaxyhas been suggested to lie within the ``cen30'' portion of the cluster and isthe most distant object for which this method has been attempted. previousdistance estimates for cen30 have varied significantly and some have presenteddisagreements with the peculiar velocity predicted from redshift surveys,motivating this investigation. using our observations, we have found 61candidate cepheid variable stars; however, a significant fraction of thesecandidates are likely to be nonvariable stars whose magnitude measurementerrors happen to fit a cepheid light curve of significant amplitude for somechoice of period and phase. through a maximum likelihood technique, wedetermine that we have observed 43 +/- 7 real cepheids and that ngc 4603 has adistance modulus of 32.61 +0.11/-0.10 (random, 1 sigma) +0.24/-0.25(systematic, adding in quadrature), corresponding to a distance of 33.3 mpc.this is consistent with a number of recent estimates of the distance to ngc4603 or cen30 and implies a small peculiar velocity consistent with predictionsfrom the iras 1.2 jy redshift survey if the galaxy lies in the foreground ofthe cluster.

astro-ph;9908140	a cepheid distance to ngc 4258	distances measured using cepheid variable stars have been essential forestablishing the cosmological distance scale and the value of the hubbleconstant. these stars have remained the primary extragalactic distanceindicator since 1929 because of the small observed scatter in the relationshipbetween their pulsation period and luminosity, their large numbers, which allowmany independent measures of the distance to a galaxy, and the simplicity ofthe basic physics underlying their variability. potential systematicuncertainties in the use of the lmc-calibrated cepheid period-luminosityrelation to determine distances using hst are estimated to be 8-10%. here wedescribe the results of a search for cepheids in the nearby galaxy ngc 4258,which has an independently determined geometric distance of 7.2 +/- 0.5 mpc(herrnstein et al. 1999). we obtain a cepheid distance of 8.1 +/- 0.4(excluding possible systematic errors affecting all hst cepheid distances) mpc;there is a 1.3 sigma difference between the two measurements. if themaser-based distance is adopted and other hst cepheid distances are revisedaccording to our results, the derived value of the hubble constant would beincreased by 12 +/- 9%, and the corresponding age of the universe woulddecrease by the same factor.

0811.0391	color bimodality in m87 globular clusters	we present an analysis of a 50 orbit hst acs observation of the m87 globularcluster system. we use the extraordinary depth of this dataset to test whetherthe colors and magnitudes show evidence for a mass-metallicity relation inglobular cluster populations. we find only a weak or absent relation betweenthe colors and magnitudes of the metal poor subpopulation of globular clusters.the weakness or absence of a color-magnitude relation is established over awide range in luminosity from $m_v=-11$ to $m_v=-6$, encompassing most of them87 globular clusters. the constancy of the colors of the metal-poorsubpopulation seen in our 50 orbit observation is in contrast to suggestionsfrom single orbit acs data that the metal-poor globular clusters in m87 andseveral other galaxies show a "blue tilt." the formal best fit for themass-metallicity relation for the metal-poor subpopulation in our much deeperdata is $z\propto m^{0.08\pm0.05}$. our analysis of these data also shows apossible small "red tilt" in the metal-rich globular cluster subpopulation.while either of these small tilts may be real, they may also illustrate thelimit to which mass-metallicity relations can be determined, even in suchextraordinarily deep data. we specifically test for a wide range of systematiceffects and find that while small tilts cannot be confirmed or rejected, thedata place a strong upper limit to any tilt of $|0.20|\pm0.05$. this upperlimit is much smaller than some earlier claims from single orbit data, andstrongly limits self-enrichment within globular clusters. this mass-metallicityrelation for globular clusters is also shallower than the relation forgalaxies, suggesting that the formation mechanisms for these two types ofobjects are different.
