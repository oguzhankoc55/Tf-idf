0905.1958	the edge of the m87 halo and the kinematics of the diffuse light in the  virgo cluster core	we present high resolution flames/vlt spectroscopy of intracluster planetarynebula (icpn) candidates, targeting three new fields in the virgo cluster corewith surface brightness down to mu_b = 28.5. based on the projected phase spaceinformation we separate the old and 12 newly-confirmed pns into galaxy andintracluster components. the m87 pns are confined to the extended stellarenvelope of m87, within a projected radius of ~ 160 kpc, while the icpns arescattered across the whole surveyed region between m87 and m86. the velocitydispersions determined from the m87 pns at projected radii of 60 kpc and 144kpc show that the galaxy's velocity dispersion profile decreases in the outerhalo, down to 78 +/- 25 km/s. a jeans model for the m87 halo stars in thegravitational potential traced by the x-ray emission fits the observed velocitydispersion profile only if the stellar orbits are strongly radially anisotropic(beta ~= 0.4 at r ~= 10 kpc increasing to 0.8 at the outer edge), and ifadditionally the stellar halo is truncated at ~= 150 kpc average ellipticalradius. from the spatial and velocity distribution of the icpns we infer thatm87 and m86 are falling towards each other and that we may be observing themjust before the first close pass. the inferred luminosity-specific pn numbersfor the m87 halo and the icl are in the range of values observed for old (&gt; 10gyr) stellar populations (abridged).

0908.3848	intracluster light in the virgo cluster: large scale distribution	the intracluster light (icl) is a faint diffuse stellar component in clustersmade of stars not bound to individual galaxies. we have carried out a largescale study of this component in the nearby virgo cluster. the diffuse light istraced using planetary nebulae (pne). the pne are detected in the on-band imagedue to their strong emission in the [oiii] 5007 line, but disappear in theoff-band image. the contribution of ly-alpha emitters at z=3.14 are correctedstatistically using blank field surveys. we have surveyed a total area of 3.3square degrees in the virgo cluster with eleven fields located at differentradial distances. those fields located at smaller radii than 80 arcmin from thecluster center contain most of the detected diffuse light. in this centralregion of the cluster, the icl has a surface brightness in the range 28.8 - 30mag per sqarsec in the b band, it is not uniformly distributed, and representsabout 7% of the total galaxy light in this area. at distances larger than 80arcmin the icl is confined to single fields and individual sub-structures, e.g.in the virgo sub-clump b, the m60/m59 group. for several fields at 2 and 3degrees from the virgo cluster center we set only upper limits. these resultsindicate that the icl is not homogeneously distributed in the virgo core, andit is concentrated in the high density regions of the virgo cluster, e.g. thecluster core and other sub-structures. outside these regions, the icl isconfined within areas of 100 kpc in size, where tidal effects may be at work.these observational results link the formation of the icl with the formationhistory of the most luminous cluster galaxies.

1001.3523	diffuse light in galaxy clusters	diffuse intracluster light (icl) has now been observed in nearby and inintermediate redshift clusters. individual intracluster stars have beendetected in the virgo and coma clusters and the first color-magnitude diagramand velocity measurements have been obtained. recent studies show that the iclcontains of the order of 10% and perhaps up to 30% of the stellar mass in thecluster, but in the cores of some dense and rich clusters like coma, the localicl fraction can be high as 40%-50%. what can we learn from the icl about theformation of galaxy clusters and the evolution of cluster galaxies? how andwhen did the icl form? what is the connection to the central brightest clustergalaxy? cosmological n-body and hydrodynamical simulations are beginning tomake predictions for the kinematics and origin of the icl. the icl traces theevolution of baryonic substructures in dense environments and can thus be usedto constrain some aspects of cosmological simulations that are most uncertain,such as the modeling of star formation and the mass distribution of thebaryonic component in galaxies.

1007.5322	steepening mass profiles, dark matter and environment of x-ray bright  elliptical galaxies	we use a new non-parametric bayesian approach to obtain the most probablemass distributions and circular velocity curves along with their confidenceranges, given deprojected density and temperature profiles of the hot gassurrounding x-ray bright elliptical galaxies. for a sample of six x-ray brightellipticals, we find that all circular velocity curves are rising in the outerparts due to a combination of a rising temperature profile and a logarithmicpressure gradient that increases in magnitude. comparing the circular velocitycurves we obtain from x-rays to those obtained from dynamical models, we findthat the former are often lower in the central ~10 kpc. this is probably due toa combination of: i) non-thermal contributions of up to ~35% in the pressure(with stronger effects in ngc 4486), ii) multiple-temperature components in thehot gas, iii) incomplete kinematic spatial coverage in the dynamical models,and iv) mass profiles that are insufficiently general in the dynamicalmodelling. complementing the total mass information from the x-rays withphotometry and stellar population models to infer the dark matter content, wefind evidence for massive dark matter haloes with dark matter mass fractions of~35-80% at 2re, rising to a maximum of 80-90% at the outermost radii. we alsofind that the six galaxies follow a tully-fisher relation with slope ~4 andthat their circular velocities at 1re correlate strongly with the velocitydispersion of the local environment. as a result, the galaxy luminosity at 1realso correlates with the velocity dispersion of the environment. theserelations suggest a close link between the properties of central x-ray brightelliptical galaxies and their environments (abridged).

1009.1682	counter-dispersed slitless-spectroscopy technique: planetary nebula  velocities in the halo of ngc 1399	using a counter-dispersed slitless spectroscopy technique, we detect andmeasure the line-of-sight velocities of 187 planetary nebulae (pne) around oneof the nearest cd galaxies, ngc 1399, with fors1 on the vlt. we describe themethod for identifying and classifying the emission-line sources and theprocedure for computing their j2000 coordinates and velocities. the number ofpn detections and the errors in the velocity measurements (37 km/s indicatethat this technique is comparable to other methods, such as that described byteodorescu et al. (2005). we present the spatial distribution of the pne and abasic analysis of their velocities. the pn two-dimensional velocity field showsmarginal rotation consistent with other studies. we also find a low-velocitysubstructure in the halo and a flatter velocity-dispersion profile compared toprevious observations that extends to ~400 arcsec. the detection of alow-velocity subcomponent underscores the importance of discrete velocitytracers for the detection of un-mixed components. the new velocity-dispersionprofile is in good agreement with revised velocity dispersions for the redglobular clusters in ngc 1399, using the data of schuberth et al. (2009). theouter parts of this profile are consistent with one of the dynamical models ofkronawitter et al. (2000), which corresponds to a circular velocity of ~340km/s and a rescaled b-band mass-to-light ratio of ~20 at 7' radius. thesemeasurements trace the kinematics of the outer halo and disentangle theheterogenous populations in the fornax cluster core. the new data set the stagefor a revised dynamical model of the outer halo of ngc 1399.

1009.3380	the outer halos of elliptical galaxies	recent progress is summarized on the determination of the densitydistributions of stars and dark matter, stellar kinematics, and stellarpopulation properties, in the extended, low surface brightness halo regions ofelliptical galaxies. with integral field absorption spectroscopy and withplanetary nebulae as tracers, velocity dispersion and rotation profiles havebeen followed to ~4 and ~5-8 effective radii, respectively, and in m87 to theouter edge at ~150 kpc. the results are generally consistent with the knowndichotomy of elliptical galaxy types, but some galaxies show more complexrotation profiles in their halos and there is a higher incidence ofmisalignments, indicating triaxiality. dynamical models have shown a range ofslopes for the total mass profiles, and that the inner dark matter densities inellipticals are higher than in spiral galaxies, indicating earlier assemblyredshifts. analysis of the hot x-ray emitting gas in x-ray bright ellipticalsand comparison with dynamical mass determinations indicates that non-thermalcomponents to the pressure may be important in the inner ~10 kpc, and that theproperties of these systems are closely related to their group environments.first results on the outer halo stellar population properties do not yet give aclear picture. in the halo of one bright galaxy, lower [alpha/fe] abundancesindicate longer star formation histories pointing towards late accretion of thehalo. this is consistent with independent evidence for on-going accretion, andsuggests a connection to the observed size evolution of elliptical galaxieswith redshift.

1105.0928	unifying boxy bulge and planar long bar in the milky way	it has been known for some time that the milky way is a barred disk galaxy.more recently several studies inferred from starcount observations that thegalaxy must contain a separate, new, flat long bar component, twisted relativeto the barred bulge. here we use a simulation with a boxy bulge and bar tosuggest that these observations can be reproduced with a single structure. inthis simulation a stellar bar evolved from the disk, and the boxy bulgeoriginated from it through secular evolution and the buckling instability. wecalculate starcount distributions for this model at different longitudes andlatitudes, in a similar way as observers have done for resolved starcounts.good agreement between the simulation and the observations can be achieved fora suitable snapshot, even though the simulation has a single boxy bulge andbar} structure. in this model, part of the long bar signature is due to avolume effect in the starcounts, and another part is due to chosing a snapshotin which the planar part of the boxy bulge and bar has developed leading endsthrough interaction with the adjacent spiral arm heads. we also providepredictions from this model for the line-of-sight velocity distributions at thelongitudes with the long bar signature, for comparison with upcoming surveys.

1105.3478	using nmagic to probe the dark matter halo and orbital structure of the  x-ray bright, massive elliptical galaxy, ngc 4649	we create dynamical models of the massive elliptical galaxy, ngc 4649, usingthe n-body made-to-measure code, nmagic, and kinematic constraints fromlong-slit and planetary nebula (pn) data. we explore a range of potentialsbased on previous determinations from x-ray observations and a dynamical modelfitting globular cluster (gc) velocities and a stellar density profile. thex-ray mass distributions are similar in the central region but have varyingouter slopes, while the gc mass profile is higher in the central region and onthe upper end of the range further out. our models cannot differentiate betweenthe potentials in the central region, and therefore if non-thermal pressures ormulti-phase components are present in the hot gas, they must be smaller thanpreviously inferred. in the halo, we find that the pn velocities are sensitivetracers of the mass, preferring a less massive halo than that derived from thegc mass profile, but similar to one of the mass distributions derived fromx-rays. our results show that the gcs may form a dynamically distinct system,and that the properties of the hot gas derived from x-rays in the outer halohave considerable uncertainties that need to be better understood. estimatingthe mass in stars using photometric information and a stellar populationmass-to-light ratio, we infer a dark matter mass fraction in ngc 4649 of ~0.39at 1re (10.5 kpc) and ~0.78 at 4re. we find that the stellar orbits areisotropic to mildly radial in the central ~6 kpc depending on the potentialassumed. further out, the orbital structure becomes slightly more radial alongr and more isotropic along z, regardless of the potential assumed. in theequatorial plane, azimuthal velocity dispersions dominate over meridionalvelocity dispersions, implying that meridional velocity anisotropy is themechanism for flattening the stellar system.

1105.5797	spin-up of low mass classical bulges in barred galaxies	secular evolution is one of the key routes through which galaxies evolvealong the hubble sequence. not only the disk undergoes morphological andkinematic changes, but also a preexisting classical bulge may be dynamicallychanged by the secular processes driven primarily by the bar. we study theinfluence of a growing bar on the dynamical evolution of a low mass classicalbulge such as might be present in galaxies like the milky way. usingself-consistent high resolution {\it n}-body simulations, we study how aninitially isotropic non-rotating small classical bulge absorbs angular momentumemitted by the bar. the basic mechanism of this angular momentum exchange isthrough resonances and a considerable fraction of the angular momentum ischanneled through lagrange point (-1:1) and ilr (2:1) orbits. in the phase ofrapid dynamical growth, also retrograde non-resonant orbits absorb significantangular momentum. as a result of this angular momentum gain, the initiallynon-rotating classical bulge transforms into a fast rotating, radiallyanisotropic and triaxial object, embedded in the similarly fast rotating boxybulge formed from the disk. towards the end of the evolution, the classicalbulge develops cylindrical rotation. by that time, its inner regions host a"classical bulge-bar" whose distinct kinematics could serve as directobservational evidence for the secular evolution in the galaxy. someimplications of these results are discussed briefly.

1112.0179	the inner galactic bulge: evidence for a nuclear bar?	recent data from the vvv survey have strengthened evidence for a structuralchange in the galactic bulge inwards of |l|&lt;=4 deg. here we show with an n-bodybarred galaxy simulation that a boxy bulge formed through the bar and bucklinginstabilities effortlessly matches measured bulge longitude profiles for redclump stars. the same simulation snapshot was earlier used to clarify theapparent boxy bulge - long bar dichotomy, for the same orientation and scaling.the change in the slope of the model longitude profiles in the inner fewdegrees is caused by a transition from highly elongated to more nearlyaxisymmetric isodensity contours in the inner boxy bulge. this transition isconfined to a few degrees from the galactic plane, thus the change of slope ispredicted to disappear at higher galactic latitudes. we also show that thenuclear star count map derived from this simulation snapshot displays alongitudinal asymmetry similar to that observed in the 2mass data, but is lessflattened to the galactic plane than the 2mass map. these results support theinterpretation that the galactic bulge originated from disk evolution, andquestion the evidence advanced from star count data for the existence of asecondary nuclear bar in the milky way.

1202.2355	regularizing made-to-measure particle models of galaxies	made-to-measure methods such as the parallel code nmagic are powerful toolsto build galaxy models reproducing observational data. they work by adaptingthe particle weights in an n-body system until the target observables are wellmatched. here we introduce a moving prior regularization (mpr) method for suchparticle models. it is based on determining from the particles a distributionof priors in phase-space, which are updated in parallel with the weightadaptation. this method allows one to construct smooth models from noisy datawithout erasing global phase-space gradients. we first apply mpr to a sphericalsystem for which the distribution function can in theory be uniquely recoveredfrom idealized data. we show that nmagic with mpr indeed converges to the truesolution with very good accuracy, independent of the initial particle model.compared to the standard weight entropy regularization, biases in theanisotropy structure are removed and local fluctuations in the intrinsicdistribution function are reduced. we then investigate how the uncertainties inthe inferred dynamical structure increase with less complete and noisierkinematic data, and how the dependence on the initial particle model alsoincreases. finally, we apply the mpr technique to the twointermediate-luminosity elliptical galaxies ngc 4697 and ngc 3379, obtainingsmoother dynamical models in luminous and dark matter potentials.

(ii)themassive systems have nearly flat total cvcs at large radii, while the lessmassive systems have mildly decreasing cvcs. the slope of the cvc at largeradii correlates with v_circ itself. (iii)the dark matter fractions within reare in the range 15-30% and increase to 40-65% at 5re. larger and more massivegalaxies have higher dark matter fractions. (iv)the short axes of simulatedgalaxies and their host dark matter haloes are well aligned and theirshort-to-long axis ratios are correlated. (v)the stellar vrms(r) profiles areslowly declining, in agreement with planetary nebulae observations in the outerhaloes of most etgs. (vi)the line-of-sight velocity fields v show that rotationproperties at small and large radii are correlated. most radial profiles forthe cumulative specific angular momentum parameter lambda(r) are nearly flat orslightly rising, with values in [0.06,0.75] from 2re to 5re. (vii)stellar mass,ellipticity at 5re, and lambda(5re) are correlated: the more massive systemshave less angular momentum and are rounder, as for observed etgs.

1212.2317	secular evolution and cylindrical rotation in boxy/peanut bulges: impact  of initially rotating classical bulges	boxy/peanut bulges are believed to originate from galactic discs throughsecular processes. a little explored question is how this evolution would bemodified if the initial disc was assembled around a preexisting classicalbulge. previously we showed that a low-mass initial classical bulge (icb), asmight have been present in milky way-like galaxies, can spin up significantlyby gaining angular momentum from a bar formed through disc instability. here weinvestigate how the disc instability and the kinematics of the finalboxy/peanut (bp) bulge depend on the angular momentum of such a low-mass icb.we show that a strong bar forms and transfers angular momentum to the icb inall our models. however, rotation in the icb limits the emission of the bar'sangular momentum, which in turn changes the size and growth of the bar, and ofthe bp bulge formed from the disc.  the final bp bulge in these models is a superposition of the bp bulge formedvia the buckling instability and the spun-up icb. we find that the long-termkinematics of the composite bp bulges in our simulations is independent of therotation of the icb, and is always described by cylindrical rotation. however,as a result of the co-evolution between bulge and bar, deviations fromcylindrical rotation are seen during the early phases of secular evolution, andmay correspond to similar deviations observed in some bulges. we provide asimple criterion to quantify deviations from pure cylindrical rotation, applyit to all our model bulges, and also illustrate its use for two galaxies:ngc7332 and ngc4570.

1212.4579	rotation of classical bulges during secular evolution of barred galaxies	bar driven secular evolution plays a key role in changing the morphology andkinematics of disk galaxies, leading to the formation of rapidly rotatingboxy/peanut bulges. if these disk galaxies also hosted a preexisting classicalbulge, how would the secular evolution influence the classical bulge, and alsothe observational properties.  we first study the co-evolution of a bar and a preexisting non-rotatinglow-mass classical bulge such as might be present in galaxies like the milkyway. it is shown with n-body simulations that during the secular evolution,such a bulge can gain significant angular momentum emitted by the bar throughresonant and stochastic orbits. thereby it transforms into a cylindricallyrotating, anisotropic and triaxial object, embedded in the fast rotating boxybulge that forms via disk instability (saha et al. 2012). the compositeboxy/peanut bulge also rotates cylindrically.  we then show that the growth of the bar depends only slightly on the rotationproperties of the preexisting classical bulge. for the initially rotating smallclassical bulge, cylindrical rotation in the resulting composite boxy/peanutbulge extends to lower heights (saha &amp; gerhard 2012). more massive classicalbulges also gain angular momentum emitted by the bar, inducing surprisinglylarge rotational support within about 4 gyrs (saha et al. in prep).

1302.1613	metallicity gradients through disk instability: a simple model for the  milky way's boxy bulge	observations show a clear vertical metallicity gradient in the galacticbulge, which is often taken as a signature of dissipative processes in theformation of a classical bulge. various evidence shows, however, that the milkyway is a barred galaxy with a boxy bulge representing the innerthree-dimensional part of the bar. here we show with a secular evolution n-bodymodel that a boxy bulge formed through bar and buckling instabilities can showvertical metallicity gradients similar to the observed gradient, if the initialaxisymmetric disk had a comparable radial metallicity gradient. in thisframework the range of metallicities in bulge fields constrains the chemicalstructure of the galactic disk at early times, before bar formation. oursecular evolution model was previously shown to reproduce inner galaxy starcounts and we show here that it also has cylindrical rotation. we use it topredict a full mean metallicity map across the galactic bulge from a simplemetallicity model for the initial disk. this map shows a general outwardgradient on the sky as well as longitudinal perspective asymmetries. we alsobriefly comment on interpreting metallicity gradient observations in externalboxy bulges.

1308.0593	mapping the three-dimensional density of the galactic bulge with vvv red  clump stars	the inner milky way is dominated by a boxy, triaxial bulge which is believedto have formed through disk instability processes. despite its proximity, itslarge-scale properties are still not very well known, due to our position inthe obscuring galactic disk. here we make a measurement of thethree-dimensional density distribution of the galactic bulge using red clumpgiants identified in dr1 of the vvv survey. our density map covers the inner(2.2x1.4x1.1)kpc of the bulge/bar. line-of-sight density distributions areestimated by deconvolving extinction and completeness corrected k-bandmagnitude distributions. in constructing our measurement, we assume that thethree-dimensional bulge is 8-fold mirror triaxially symmetric. in doing so wemeasure the angle of the bar-bulge to the line-of-sight to be (27+- 2)deg,where the dominant error is systematic arising from the details of thedeconvolution process. the resulting density distribution shows a highlyelongated bar with projected axis ratios ~(1:2.1) for isophotes reaching ~2kpcalong the major axis. along the bar axes the density falls off roughlyexponentially, with axis ratios (10:6.3:2.6) and exponential scale-lengths(0.70:0.44:0.18)kpc. from about 400pc above the galactic plane, the bulgedensity distribution displays a prominent x-structure. overall, the densitydistribution of the galactic bulge is characteristic for a strongly boxy/peanutshaped bulge within a barred galaxy.

1311.5258	the nuclear cluster of the milky way: total mass and luminosity	here we present the fundamental properties of the nuclear cluster of themilky way. first, we derive its structural properties by constructing a densitymap of the central 1000'' using extinction-corrected star counts. we candescribe the data with a two-component model built from sersic profiles. theinner nearly spherical component is the nuclear cluster. the outer, stronglyflattened component can be identified with the stellar component of thecircumnuclear zone. second, we enlarge the radius inside which detaileddynamics are available from $1\,$pc to $4\,$pc. we use more than 10000individual proper motions and more than 2700 radial velocities. we determinethe cluster mass by means of isotropic spherical jeans modeling. we get anuclear cluster mass within 100'' of $m_{100''}=(6.11 \pm 0.52|_{\mathrm{fix}r_0}\pm 0.97|_{r_0}) \times 10^6 $ m$_{\odot}$, which corresponds to a totalcluster mass of m$_{\mathrm{nc}}=(13.08 \pm 2.51|_{\mathrm{fix} r_0}\pm2.08|_{r_0}) \times 10^6 $ m$_{\odot}$. by combination of our mass with theflux we calculate $m/l=0.50 \pm 0.12 m_{\odot}/l_{\odot,\mathrm{ks}}$ for thecentral 100''. that is broadly consistent with a chabrier imf. with its massand a luminosity of m$_{\mathrm{ks}}=-15.30\pm0.26$ the nuclear cluster is abright and massive specimen with a typical size.

0802.1726	dark matter content and internal dynamics of ngc 4697: nmagic particle  models from slit data and planetary nebulae velocities	we present a dynamical study of ngc 4697, an almost edge-on,intermediate-luminosity, e4 elliptical galaxy, combining new surface brightnessphotometry, new as well as published long-slit absorption line kinematic data,and published planetary nebulae (pne) velocity data. the combined kinematicdata set extends out to ~= 5' ~= 4.5 r_e and allows us to probe the galaxy'souter halo. for the first time, we model such a dataset with the new andflexible chi^2-made-to-measure particle code nmagic. we extend nmagic toinclude seeing effects, introduce an efficient scheme to estimate themass-to-light ratio, and incorporate a maximum likelihood technique to accountfor discrete velocity measurements. for modelling the pne kinematics we useline-of-sight velocities and velocity dispersions computed on two differentspatial grids, and we also use the individual velocity measurements with thelikelihood method, in order to make sure that our results are not biased by theway we treat the pne measurements. we generate axisymmetric self-consistentmodels as well models including various dark matter halos. these models fit allthe mean velocity and velocity dispersion data with chi^2/n&lt;1, both in the casewith only luminous matter and in potentials including quite massive halos. thelikelihood analysis together with the velocity histograms suggest that modelswith low density halos such that the circular velocity v_c ~&lt; 200 km/s at r_eare not consistent with the data. a range of massive halos with v_c ~= 250 km/sat 5r_e fit the pn data best. to derive stronger results would require pnvelocities at even larger radii. the best fitting models are slightly radiallyanisotropic; the anisotropy parameter beta ~= 0.3 at the center, increasing tobeta ~= 0.5 at radii &gt;~ 2r_e.

1403.5266	the old nuclear star cluster in the milky way: dynamics, mass,  statistical parallax, and black hole mass	we derive new constraints on the mass, rotation, orbit structure andstatistical parallax of the galactic old nuclear star cluster (nsc) and themass of the supermassive black hole. we combine star counts and kinematic datafrom fritz et al (2014), including 2'500 line-of-sight velocities and 10'000proper motions. we show that the difference between the proper motiondispersions sigma_l and sigma_b cannot be explained by rotation, but is aconsequence of the flattening of the nsc. we fit the surface densitydistribution of stars in the central 1000" by a spheroidal cluster with scale~100" and a much larger nuclear disk component. we compute the two-integraldistribution function f(e,lz) for this density model, and add rotationself-consistently. we find that: (i) the orbit structure of the f(e,lz) givesan excellent match to the observed velocity dispersion profiles as well as theproper motion and line-of-sight velocity histograms, including the double-peakin the v_l-histograms. (ii) this requires an axial ratio of q= 0.73+-0.04 forr&lt;70" consistent with our determination from star counts. (iii) the nsc isapproximately described by an isotropic rotator model. (iv) using thecorresponding jeans equations to fit the proper motion and line-of-sightvelocity dispersions, we obtain best estimates for the nsc mass, black holemass, and distance m*(r&lt;100")=(8.94+-0.31|stat+-0.9|syst)x10^6msun,mbh=(3.86+-0.14|stat+-0.4|syst)x10^6msun, and r0=8.27+-0.09|stat+-0.1|syst kpc,where the systematic errors estimate additional uncertainties in the dynamicalmodeling. (v) the combination of the cluster dynamics with the s-star orbitsaround sgr a* strongly reduces the degeneracy between black hole mass andgalactic centre distance present in previous s-star studies. a jointstatistical analysis with the results of gillessen et al (2009) givesmbh=(4.23+-0.14)x10^6msun and r0=8.33+-0.11kpc.

1502.02032	the outer regions of the giant virgo galaxy m87. kinematic separation of  stellar halo and intracluster light	we present a spectroscopic study of 287 planetary nebulas (pns) in a totalarea of ~0.4 deg^2 around the bcg m87 in virgo a. with these data we candistinguish the stellar halo from the co-spatial intracluster light (icl). pnswere identified from their narrow and symmetric redshifted lambda 5007\4959angstrom [oiii] emission lines, and the absence of significant continuum. weimplement a robust technique to measure the halo velocity dispersion from theprojected phase-space to identify pns associated with the m87 halo and icl. thevelocity distribution of the spectroscopically confirmed pns is bimodal,containing a narrow component centred on the systemic velocity of the bcg andan off-centred broader component, that we identify as halo and icl,respectively. halo and icpn have different spatial distributions: the halo pnsfollow the galaxy's light, whereas the icpns are characterised by a shallowerpower-law profile. the composite pn number density profile shows thesuperposition of different pn populations associated with the m87 halo and theicl, characterised by different pn alpha-parameters, the icl contributing ~3times more pns per unit light. down to m_5007=28.8, the m87 halo pn luminosityfunction (pnlf) has a steeper slope towards faint magnitudes than the ic pnlf,and both are steeper than the standard pnlf for the m31 bulge. moreover, the icpnlf has a dip at ~1-1.5 mag fainter than the bright cutoff, reminiscent of thepnlfs of systems with extended star formation history. the m87 halo and thevirgo icl are dynamically distinct components with different density profilesand velocity distribution. the different alpha values and pnlf shapes of thehalo and icl indicate distinct parent stellar populations, consistent with theexistence of a gradient towards bluer colours at large radii. these resultsreflect the hierarchical build-up of the virgo cluster.

1504.01401	the structure of the milky way's bar outside the bulge	while it is incontrovertible that the inner galaxy contains a bar, itsstructure near the galactic plane has remained uncertain, where extinction fromintervening dust is greatest. we investigate here the galactic bar outside thebulge, the long bar, using red clump giant (rcg) stars from ukidss, 2mass, vvv,and glimpse. we match and combine these surveys to investigate a wide area inlatitude and longitude, |b|&lt;9deg and |l|&lt;40deg. we find: (1) the bar extends tol~25deg at |b|~5deg from the galactic plane, and to l~30deg at lower latitudes.(2) the long bar has an angle to the line-of-sight in the range (28-33)deg,consistent with studies of the bulge at |l|&lt;10deg. (3) the scale-height of rcgstars smoothly transitions from the bulge to the thinner long bar. (4) there isevidence for two scale heights in the long bar. we find a ~180pc thin barcomponent reminiscent of the old thin disk near the sun, and a ~45pc super-thinbar component which exists predominantly towards the bar end. (5) constructingparametric models for the rc magnitude distributions, we find a bar half lengthof 5.0+-0.2kpc for the 2-component bar, and 4.6+-0.3kpc for the thin barcomponent alone. we conclude that the milky way contains a central box/peanutbulge which is the vertical extension of a longer, flatter bar, similar as seenin both external galaxies and n-body models.

[...] we link this to the sizedistribution of hi supershells and assess the properties of likely26al-carrying superbubbles. 26al is produced by star clusters of all massesabove about 200 solar masses, roughly equally contributed over a logarithmicstar cluster mass scale, and strongly linked to the injection of feedbackenergy. the observed superbubble size distribution cannot be related to thestar cluster mass function in a straight forward manner. in order to avoid thatthe added volume of all superbubbles exceeds the volume of the milky way,individual superbubbles have to merge frequently. if any two superbubblesmerge, or if 26al is injected off-centre in a bigger hi supershell we expectthe hot 26al-carrying gas to obtain velocities of the order of the typicalsound speed in superbubbles, about 300 km/s before decay.

1505.04508	spin-up of massive classical bulges during secular evolution	classical bulges in spiral galaxies are known to rotate but the origin ofthis observed rotational motion is not well understood. it has been shownrecently that a low-mass classical bulge (clb) in a barred galaxy can acquirerotation from absorbing a significant fraction of the angular momentum emittedby the bar. our aim here is to investigate whether bars can spin up also moremassive clbs during the secular evolution of the bar, and to study thekinematics and dynamics of these clbs. we use a set of self-consistent n-bodysimulations to study the interaction of clbs with a bar that formsself-consistently in the disk. we use orbital spectral analysis to investigatethe angular momentum gain by the classical bulge stars. we show that the clbsgain, on average, about 2 - 6% of the disk's initial angular momentum withinthe bar region. most of this angular momentum gain occurs via low-orderresonances, particularly 5:2 resonant orbits. a density wake forms in the clbwhich corotates and aligns with the bar at the end of the evolution. thespin-up process creates a characteristic linear rotation profile and mildtangential anisotropy in the clb. the induced rotation is small in the centrebut significant beyond $\sim2$ bulge half mass radii, where it leads tomass-weighted $v/\sigma \sim 0.2$, and reaches a local $v_{max}/\sigma_{in}\sim 0.5$ at around the scale of the bar. the resulting $v/\sigma$ is tightlycorrelated with the ratio of the bulge size to the bar size. in all models, abox/peanut bulge forms suggesting that composite bulges may be common.bar-bulge resonant interaction in barred galaxies can provide some spin up ofmassive clbs, but the process appears to be less efficient than for low-massclbs. further angular momentum transfer due to nuclear bars or gas inflow wouldbe required to explain the observed rotation if it is not primordial.

astro-ph;0012381	dynamical family properties and dark halo scaling relations of giant  elliptical galaxies	based on a uniform dynamical analysis of line-profile shapes for 21 luminousround elliptical galaxies, we have investigated the dynamical family relationsof ellipticals: (i) the circular velocity curves (cvcs) of elliptical galaxiesare flat to within ~10% for r&gt;~0.2r_e. (ii) most ellipticals are moderatelyradially anisotropic; their dynamical structure is surprisingly uniform. (iii)elliptical galaxies follow a tully-fisher (tf) relation, with v_c^max=300 km/sfor an l_b^* galaxy. at given v_c^max, they are ~1 mag fainter in b and appearto have slightly lower baryonic mass than spirals even for maximum m/l_b. (iv)the luminosity dependence of m/l_b is confirmed. the tilt of the fundamentalplane is not caused by dynamical non-homology, nor only by an increasing darkmatter fraction with l. it is, however, consistent with stellar populationmodels based on published metallicities and ages. the main driver is thereforeprobably metallicity, and a secondary population effect is needed to explainthe k-band tilt. (v) these results make it likely that elliptical galaxies havenearly maximal m/l_b (minimal halos). (vi) despite the uniformly flat cvcs,there is a spread in cumulative m/l_b(r). some galaxies have no indication fordark matter within 2r_e, whereas others have local m/l_bs of 20-30 at 2r_e.(vii) in models with maximum stellar mass, the dark matter contributes ~10-40%of the mass within r_e. (viii) the corresponding halo core densities andphase-space densities are at least ~25 times larger and the halo core radii ~4times smaller than in spiral galaxies of the same v_c^max. the increase in m/lsets in at ~10 times larger acceleration than in spirals. this could imply thatelliptical galaxy halos collapsed at high redshift or that some of the darkmatter in ellipticals might be baryonic.

astro-ph;0110368	spiral arms, bar shape and bulge microlensing in the milky way	a new model for the luminosity distribution in the inner milky way is found,using a non-parametric penalized maximum-likelihood algorithm to deproject adereddened cobe/dirbe l-band map of the inner galaxy. the model is alsoconstrained by the apparent magnitude (line-of-sight) distributions of clumpgiant stars in certain bulge fields. an important new feature is the inclusionof a spiral arm model in the disk. spiral arms make the model appear broader onthe sky, thus our bar is more elongated than in previous eight-fold symmetricmodels. they also lead to a smoother disk model interior to the sun. the barlength is approx. 3.5kpc and its axis ratios are 1:(0.3-0.4):0.3, independentof whether the spiral arm model is 4-armed or 2-armed. the larger elongation inthe plane makes it possible to reproduce the observed clump giant distributionsas well. for the bar angle we estimate 15^o &lt;= phi &lt;= 30^o, with the bestmodels obtained for 20^o &lt;= phi &lt;= 25^o. we use our reference model to predicta microlensing optical depth map towards the bulge, normalising its mass by theobserved terminal velocity curve. for clump giant sources at (l,b)=(3.9,-3.8)we find tau_{-6}:=tau/10^{-6}=1.27, within 1.8*sigma of the new machomeasurement given by popowski et al. the value for all sources at(l,b)=(2.68,-3.35) is tau_{-6}=1.1, still &gt;3*sigma away from the publishedmacho dia value. the dispersion of these tau_{-6} values within our models is10%. because the distribution of sources is well-fit by the nir model,increasing the predicted optical depths by &gt;20% will be difficult. thus thehigh value of the measured clump giant optical depth argues for a near-maximaldisk in the milky way.

astro-ph;0203110	mass distribution in our galaxy	this article summarizes recent work on the luminosity and mass distributionof the galactic bulge and disk, and on the mass of the milky way's dark halo. anew luminosity model consistent with the cobe nir data and the apparentmagnitude distributions of bulge clump giant stars has bulge/bar length of$\simeq 3.5\kpc$, axis ratios of 1:(0.3-0.4):0.3, and short disk scale-length($\simeq 2.1\kpc$). gas-dynamical flows in the potential of this model withconstant m/l fit the terminal velocities in $10\deg\le |l| \le 50\deg$ verywell. the luminous mass distribution with this m/l is consistent with thesurface density of known matter near the sun, but still underpredicts themicrolensing optical depth towards the bulge. together, these facts arguestrongly for a massive, near-maximal disk in our $\sim l^\ast$, sbc spiralgalaxy. while the outer rotation curve and global mass distribution are not asreadily measured as in similar spiral galaxies, the dark halo mass estimatedfrom satellite velocities is consistent with a flat rotation curve continuingon from the luminous mass distribution.

astro-ph;0203375	the pattern speed of the oh/ir stars in the milky way	we show how the continuity equation can be used to determine pattern speedsin the milky way galaxy (mwg). this method, first discussed by tremaine &amp;weinberg in the context of external galaxies, requires projected positions,$(l,b)$, and line-of-sight velocities for a spatially complete sample ofrelaxed tracers. if the local standard of rest (lsr) has a zero velocity in theradial direction ($u_{\rm lsr}$), then the quantity that is measured is $\deltav \equiv \omega_p r_0 - v_{\rm lsr}$, where $\omega_p$ is the pattern speed ofthe non-axisymmetric feature, $r_0$ is the distance of the sun from thegalactic centre and $v_{\rm lsr}$ is the tangential motion of the lsr,including the circular velocity. we use simple models to assess the reliabilityof the method for measuring a single, constant pattern speed of either a bar orspiral in the inner mwg. we then apply the method to the oh/ir stars in theatca/vla oh 1612 mhz survey of sevenster et al, finding $\delta v = 252 \pm 41$km/s, if $u_{\rm lsr} = 0$. assuming further that $r_0 = 8$ kpc and $v_{\rmlsr} = 220$ \kms, this gives $\omega_p = 59\pm 5$ km/s/kpc with a possiblesystematic error of perhaps 10 km/s/kpc. the non-axisymmetric feature for whichwe measure this pattern speed must be in the disc of the mwg.

astro-ph;0301499	the formation of a disk galaxy within a growing dark halo	we present a dynamical model for the formation and evolution of a massivedisk galaxy, within a growing dark halo whose mass evolves according tocosmological simulations of structure formation. the galactic evolution issimulated with a new 3d chemo-dynamical code, including dark matter, stars anda multi-phase ism. the simulations start at redshift z=4.85 with a small darkhalo in a lcdm universe and we follow the evolution until the present epoch.the energy release by massive stars and sne prevents a rapid collapse of thebaryonic matter and delays the maximum star formation until z=1. the galaxyforms radially from inside-out and vertically from halo to disk. the firstgalactic component that forms is the halo, followed by the bulge, the disk-halotransition region, and the disk. at z=1, a bar begins to form which later turnsinto a triaxial bulge. there is a pronounced deficiency of low-metallicity diskstars due to pre-enrichment of the disk ism with metal-rich gas from the bulgeand inner disk (g-dwarf problem). the mean rotation and the distribution oforbital eccentricities for all stars as a function of metallicity are not verydifferent from those observed in the solar neighbourhood, showing thathomogeneous collapse models are oversimplified. the approach presented hereprovides a detailed description of the formation and evolution of an isolateddisk galaxy in a lcdm universe, yielding new information about the kinematicaland chemical history of the stars and the ism, but also about the evolution ofthe luminosity, the colours and the morphology of disk galaxies.

(ii) this translates to anupper limit of 1.6% for the fraction of luminosity in a diffuse intragroupcomponent in the densest 3 x 2 deg area of the leo group,relative to the lightin galaxies. (iii) using this leo field as a blank field, we derive an averagefraction of 13.6% background emission line objects that enter in surveys ofvirgo intracluster pn. the small fraction confirms the validity of theselection criteria for intracluster pn candidates in virgo.

astro-ph;0312139	gas physics, disk fragmentation, and bulge formation in young galaxies	we investigate the evolution of star-forming gas-rich disks, using a 3dchemodynamical model including a dark halo, stars, and a two-phase interstellarmedium with feedback processes from the stars. we show that galaxy evolutionproceeds along very different routes depending on whether it is the gas disk orthe stellar disk which first becomes unstable, as measured by the respectiveq-parameters. this in turn depends on the uncertain efficiency of energydissipation of the cold cloud component from which stars form. when the coldgas cools efficiently and drives the instability, the galactic disk fragmentsand forms a number of massive clumps of stars and gas. the clumps spiral to thecenter of the galaxy in a few dynamical times and merge there to form a centralbulge component in a strong starburst. when the kinetic energy of the coldclouds is dissipated at a lower rate, stars form from the gas in a morequiescent mode, and an instability only sets in at later times, when thesurface density of the stellar disk has grown sufficiently high. the systemthen forms a stellar bar, which channels gas into the center, evolves, andforms a bulge whose stars are the result of a more extended star formationhistory. we investigate the stability of the gas-stellar disks in both regimes,as well as the star formation rates and element enrichment. we study themorphology of the evolving disks, calculating spatially resolved colours fromthe distribution of stars in age and metallicity, including dust absorption. wethen discuss morphological observations such as clumpy structures and chaingalaxies at high redshift as possible signatures of fragmenting, gas-richdisks. finally, we investigate abundance ratio distributions as a means todistinguish the different scenarios for bulge formation.

astro-ph;0502421	the line-of-sight velocity distributions of intracluster planetary  nebulae in the virgo cluster core	radial velocities of 40 intracluster planetary nebulae (icpne) in the virgocluster were obtained with the new multi-fiber flames spectrograph on ut2 atvlt. for the first time, the lambda 4959 aa line of the [oiii] doublet is seenin a large fraction (50%) of icpne spectra, and a large fraction of thephotometric candidates with m(5007) &lt;\= 27.2 is spectroscopically confirmed.icpne with the velocity dispersion of the virgo cluster are found in our corefield 1 deg from m87. these may have originated from tidal mass loss of smallergalaxies in the m87 subcluster halo. in a field 0.25 deg from m87, we see anextended stellar halo of m87 in approximate dynamical equilibrium, but with fewicpne. finally, in a field near m84/m86, the icpne velocities are highlycorrelated with the galaxy velocities, showing that any well-mixed intraclusterpopulation is yet to form. overall, the measured velocity distributions confirmthe non-uniform dynamical structure and on-going assembly of the virgocluster.(based on data collected with the flames spectrograph at the ut2 of thevlt at cerro paranal, chile, operated by eso, during observing run71.b-0147(a))

astro-ph;0510499	kinematic evidence for different planetary nebulae populations in the  elliptical galaxy ngc 4697	we have analysed the magnitudes, kinematics and positions of a completesample of 320 pns in the elliptical galaxy ngc 4697. we show (i) that the pnsin ngc 4697 do not constitute a single population that is a fair tracer of thedistribution of all stars. the radial velocity distributions, mean velocities,and dispersions of bright and faint subsamples differ with high statisticalconfidence. (ii) using the combined data for pns brighter than 26.2, we haveidentified a subpopulation of pns which is azimuthally unmixed andkinematically peculiar, and which thus neither traces the distribution of allstars nor can it be in dynamical equilibrium with the galaxy potential. (iii)the planetary nebula luminosity functions (pnlf) of two kinematic subsamples inngc 4697 differ with 99.7% confidence, ruling out a universal pnlf. we estimatethat the inferred secondary pn population introduces an uncertainty in thebright cutoff magnitude of ~ 0.15 mag for this galaxy. -- we argue that thissecondary pn distribution may be associated with a younger, &gt;~ 1 gyr oldstellar population, perhaps formed in tidal structures that have now fallenback onto the galaxy, as has previously been suggested for the x-ray pointsources in this galaxy, or coming from a more recent merger/accretion with ared galaxy. the use of pns for extragalactic distance determinations is notnecessarily compromised, but their use as dynamical tracers of dark halos willrequire deep observations and careful analysis of large pn samples.

astro-ph;0609211	virgo's intracluster globular clusters as seen by the advanced camera  for surveys	we report the discovery of 4 candidate intracluster globular clusters (igcs)in a single deep hst acs field of the virgo cluster. we show that each clusteris roughly spherical, has a magnitude near the peak of the virgo globularcluster luminosity function, has a radial profile that is best-fit by a kingmodel, and is surrounded by an excess of point sources which have the colorsand magnitudes of cluster red giant stars. despite the fact that two of our igccandidates have integrated colors redder than the mean of the m87 globularcluster system, we propose that all of the objects are metal-poor with [m/h] &lt;-1. we show that the tidal radii of our intracluster globulars are all largerthan the mean for milky way clusters, and suggest that the clusters haveundergone less tidal stress than their galactic counterparts. finally, wenormalize our globular cluster observations to the luminosity of intraclusterstars, and derive a value of s_n ~ 6 for the specific frequency of virgointracluster globular clusters. we use these data to constrain the origins ofvirgo's intracluster population, and suggest that globular clusters in ourintracluster field have a different origin than globular clusters in thevicinity of m87. in particular, we argue that dwarf elliptical galaxies may bean important source of intracluster stars.

astro-ph;0610386	the metallicity distribution of intracluster stars in virgo	we have used the hubble space telescope's advanced camera for surveys (acs)to detect and measure ~5300 stars in a single intracluster field in the virgocluster. by performing f606w and f814w photometry on these stars, we havedetermined their metallicity distribution function, and constrained the typesof stars present in this portion of virgo's intracluster space. based on thesmall number of stars detected brighter than the red giant branch (rgb) tip, wesuggest that in this region, virgo's intracluster stars are mostly old (&gt;~10gyr). through analysis of the rgb stars themselves, we determine that thepopulation contains the full range of metallicities probed (-2.3&lt;[m/h]&lt;0.0). wealso present evidence that the younger (&lt;10 gyr) component of the population ismore metal-rich, with [m/h]&gt;-0.5. the spatial distribution of the mostmetal-poor stars in the field shows significantly more structure than that ofthe metal-rich stars, indicating that the intracluster population is notwell-mixed. we discuss the implications these observations have for theproduction of intracluster stars and the dynamical evolution of the virgocluster.

astro-ph;0611180	the resolved stellar populations of a dwarf spheroidal galaxy in the  virgo cluster	we report on the discovery of a faint (m_v ~ -10.6 +/- 0.2) dwarf spheroidalgalaxy on deep f606w and f814w hubble space telescope images of a virgointracluster field. the galaxy is easily resolved in our images, as our colormagnitude diagram (cmd) extends &gt; 1 magnitude beyond the tip of the red giantbranch (rgb). thus, it is the deepest cmd for a small dwarf galaxy inside acluster environment. using the colors of the rgb stars, we derive a metalabundance for the dwarf of [m/h]= -2.3 +/- 0.3, and show that the metallicitydispersion is less than 0.6 dex at 95% confidence. we also use the galaxy'slack of agb stars and the absence of objects brighter than m_bol ~ -4.1 +/- 0.2to show that the system is old (t &gt;~10 gyr). finally, we derive the object'sstructural parameters, and show that the galaxy displays no obvious evidence oftidal threshing. since the tip of the red giant branch distance ((m-m)_0 =31.23 +/- 0.17 or d = 17.6 +/- 1.4 mpc) puts the galaxy near the core of thevirgo cluster, one might expect the object to have undergone some tidalprocessing. yet the chemical and morphological similarity between the dwarf andthe dsph galaxies of the local and m81 group demonstrates that the object isindeed pristine, and not the shredded remains of a much larger galaxy. wediscuss the possible origins of this galaxy, and suggest that it is just nowfalling into virgo for the first time.

(ii) webuild a self-consistent oblate three-integral maximum rotator model and comparehow the distribution function is recovered from integral field and slitkinematic data. (iii) we create a non-rotating and a figure rotating triaxialstellar particle model, reproduce the projected kinematics of the figurerotating system by a non-rotating system of the same intrinsic shape, andillustrate the signature of pattern rotation in this model. from these tests wecomment on the dependence of the results from chi-squared-m2m on the initialmodel, the geometry, and the amount of available data.

astro-ph;0703606	kinematic substructures in the coma cluster core as traced by  intracluster planetary nebulae	the coma cluster is the richest and most compact of the nearby clusters, yetthere is growing evidence that its formation is still on-going. a sensitiveprobe of this evolution is the dynamics of intracluster stars, which areunbound from galaxies while the cluster forms, according to cosmologicalsimulations. with a new multi-slit imaging spectroscopy technique pioneered atthe 8.2 m subaru telescope and focas, we can now detect and measure theline-of-sight velocities of the intracluster planetary nebulae which areassociated with the diffuse stellar population of stars, at 100 mpc distance.we detect significant velocity substructures within a 6 arcmin diameter field,centred on the coma x-ray cluster emission. one substructure ispresent at ~5000km/s, probably from infall of a galaxy group, while the main intraclusterstellar component moves at ~ 6500 km/s. hence the icpns associated with thediffuse light at the position of the msis field are not bound to the nearby cdgalaxy ngc 4874, whose radial velocity is ~ 700 km/s greater.

astro-ph;0703770	the kinematics of intracluster planetary nebulae and the on-going  subcluster merger in the coma cluster core	the coma cluster is the richest and most compact of the nearby clusters, yetthere is growing evidence that its formation is still on-going. with a newmulti-slit imaging spectroscopy technique pioneered at the 8.2 m subarutelescope and focas, we have detected and measured the line-of-sight velocitiesof 37 intracluster planetary nebulae associated with the diffuse stellarpopulation of stars in the coma cluster core, at 100 mpc distance. we detectclear velocity substructures within a 6 arcmin diameter field. a substructureis present at ~5000 km/s, probably from in-fall of a galaxy group, while themain intracluster stellar component is centered around ~6500 km/s, ~700 km/soffset from the nearby cd galaxy ngc 4874. the kinematics and morphology of theintracluster stars show that the cluster core is in a highly dynamicallyevolving state. in combination with galaxy redshift and x-ray data this arguesstrongly that the cluster is currently in the midst of a subcluster merger,where the ngc 4874 subcluster core may still be self-bound, while the ngc 4889subcluster core has probably dissolved. the ngc 4889 subcluster is likely tohave fallen into coma from the eastern a2199 filament, in a direction nearly inthe plane of the sky, meeting the ngc 4874 subcluster arriving from the west.the two inner subcluster cores are presently beyond their first and secondclose passage, during which the elongated distribution of diffuse light hasbeen created. we predict the kinematic signature expected in this scenario, andargue that the extended western x-ray arc recently discovered traces the arcshock generated by the collision between the two subcluster gas halos. anypreexisting cooling core region would have been heated by the subclustercollision.

astro-ph;9509149	baryonic dark halos: machos and cold gas?	we consider the possibility that the dark matter in the halos of galaxies maybe in the form of clusters of \macho s within which are embedded cold, densegas clouds. microlensing experiments have found evidence that the galactic halocontains up to half of its mass in the form of low-mass \macho s. a number ofobservational and dynamical arguments point to the existence of hithertounobserved cold gas around galaxies. we show that the cold gas can bestabilized by \macho\ clusters. within the framework of a simple two-componentmodel, we derive constraints on the \macho\ clusters and on the halo cold gascontent. typical cluster masses are $\sim 10 \msun$, typical \macho\ masses are$\sim 0.01 \msun$, and the gas content could be up to of order 50 \%. variouspredictions are given for testing the hypothesis that such objects couldconstitute most of the mass in the dark halos of galaxies. if halos are indeedbaryonic and contain significant amounts of cold gas, they are likely to play amuch more active role in galaxy formation and evolution than is commonlysupposed.

astro-ph;9609066	the photometric structure of the inner galaxy	the light distribution in the inner few kiloparsecs of the milky way isrecovered non-parametrically from a dust-corrected near-infrared cobe/dirbesurface brightness map of the inner galaxy. the best fits to the photometry areobtained when the sun is assumed to lie $\sim14\pm4\pc$ below the plane. therecovered density distributions clearly show an elongated three-dimensionalbulge set in a highly non-axisymmetric disk. in the favoured models, the bulgehas axis ratios $1{:}0.6{:}0.4$ and semi-major axis length $\sim2\kpc$. itsnearer long axis lies in the first quadrant. the bulge is surrounded by anelliptical disk that extends to $\sim2\kpc$ on the minor axis and $\sim3.5\kpc$on the major axis. in all models there is a local density minimum $\sim2.2\kpc$down the minor axis. the subsequent maximum $\sim3\kpc$ down the minor axis(corresponding to $l\simeq-22\deg$ and $l\simeq 17\deg$) may be associated withthe lagrange point l$_4$. from this identification and the length of thebulge-bar, we infer a pattern speed $\omega_b\simeq 60-70\kms\kpc^{-1}$ for thebar. experiments in which pseudo-data derived from models with spiral structurewere deprojected under the assumption that the galaxy is either eight-fold orfour-fold symmetric, indicate that the highly non-axisymmetric disks recoveredfrom the cobe data could reflect spiral structure within the milky way if thatstructure involves density contrasts greater than $\gta 3$ at nir wavelengths.these experiments indicate that the angle $\phi_0$ between the sun--centre lineand a major axis of the bulge lies near $20\deg$.

astro-ph;9611176	two modes of gas flow in a single barred galaxy	we investigate stationary gas flows in a fixed, rotating barred potential.the gas is assumed to be isothermal with an effective sound speed c_s, and theequations of motion are solved with smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph).since the thermal energy in cloud random motions is negligible compared to theorbital kinetic energy, no dependence of the flow on c_s is expected. however,this is not the case when shocks are involved.  for low values of c_s an open, off-axis shock flow forms that ischaracteristic for potentials with an inner lindblad resonance (ilr). throughthis shock the gas streams inwards from x_1 to x_2-orbits. at high sound speedsthe gas arranges itself in a different, on-axis shock flow pattern. in thiscase, there is no gas on x_2-orbits, demonstrating that the gas can behave asif there were no ilr. the critical effective sound speed dividing the tworegimes is in the range of values observed in the milky way.  we give a heuristic explanation for this effect. a possible consequence isthat star formation may change the structure of the flow by which it wasinitiated. low-mass galaxies should predominantly be in the on-axis regime.  a brief comparison of our sph results with those from a grid-basedhydrodynamic code is also given.

astro-ph;9710129	breaking the degeneracy between anisotropy and mass: the dark halo of  the e0 galaxy ngc 6703	(abridged) we have measured line-of-sight velocity profiles (vps) in the e0galaxy ngc 6703 out to 2.6 r_e. from these data we constrain the massdistribution and the anisotropy of the stellar orbits in this galaxy.  we have developed a non-parametric technique to determine the df f(e,l^2)directly from the kinematic data. from monte carlo tests using the spatialextent, sampling, and error bars of the ngc 6703 data we find that smoothunderlying dfs can be recovered to an rms accuracy of 12%, and the anisotropyparameter beta(r) to an accuracy of 0.1, in a given potential. anasymptotically constant halo circular velocity v_0 can be determined with anaccuracy of +- \lta 50km/s.  for ngc 6703 we determine the true circular velocity at 2.6 r_e to be 250 +-40km/s at 95% c.l., corresponding to a total mass in ngc 6703 inside 78'' (13.5h_50^-1 kpc), of 1.6-2.6 x 10^11 h_50^-1 msun. no model without dark matterwill fit the data; however, a maximum stellar mass model in which the luminouscomponent provides nearly all the mass in the centre does. in such a model, thetotal luminous mass inside 78'' is 9 x 10^10 msun and the integratedm/l_b=5.3-10, corresponding to a rise from the center by at least a factor of1.6.  the anisotropy of the stellar distribution function in ngc 6703 changes fromnear-isotropic at the centre to slightly radially anisotropic (beta=0.3-0.4 at30'', beta=0.2-0.4 at 60'') and is not well-constrained at the outer edge ofthe data.  our results suggest that also elliptical galaxies begin to be dominated bydark matter at radii of \sim 10kpc.

astro-ph;9810208	gas dynamics and large-scale morphology of the milky way galaxy	we present a new model for the gas dynamics in the galactic disk inside thesun's orbit. quasi-equilibrium flow solutions are determined in thegravitational potential of the deprojected cobe nir bar and disk, complementedby a central cusp and, in some models, an outer halo. these models genericallylead to four-armed spiral structure between corotation of the bar and the solarcircle; their large-scale morphology is not sensitive to the precise value ofthe bar's pattern speed, to the orientation of the bar with respect to theobserver, and to whether or not the spiral arms carry mass.  our best model provides a coherent interpretation of many observed gasdynamical features. its four-armed spiral structure outside corotationreproduces quantitatively the directions to the five main spiral arm tangentsat |l|&lt;=60deg observed in a variety of tracers. the 3-kpc-arm is identifiedwith one of the model arms emanating from the ends of the bar, extending intothe corotation region. the model features an inner gas disk with a cusped orbitshock transition to an x_2 orbit disk of radius r~150pc.  the bar's corotation radius is fairly well--constrained at r_c=3.5 +/- 0.5kpc. the best value for the orientation angle of the bar is probably 20-25deg,but the uncertainty is large since no detailed quantitative fit to all featuresin the observed lv-diagrams is yet possible. the galactic terminal velocitycurve from hi and co observations out to l=+/-45deg (=5 kpc) is approximatelydescribed by a maximal disk model with constant mass-to-light ratio for the nirbulge and disk.

astro-ph;9901036	dynamics of the boxy elliptical galaxy ngc 1600	we use three--integral models to infer the distribution function (df) of theboxy e3-e4 galaxy ngc 1600 from surface brightness and line profile data on theminor and major axes. we assume axisymmetry and that the mass-to-light ratio isconstant in the central ~1 r_e. stars in the resulting gravitational potentialmove mainly on regular orbits. we use an approximate third integral k fromperturbation theory, and write the df as a sum of basis functions in the threeintegrals e, l_z and k. we then fit the projected moments of these basisfunctions to the kinematic observables and deprojected density, using anon-parametric algorithm.  the deduced dynamical structure is radially anisotropic, withsigma_theta/sigma_r ~ sigma_phi/sigma_r ~ 0.7 on the major axis. both on theminor axis and near the centre the velocity distribution is more isotropic;thus the model is flattened by equatorial radial orbits. the kinematic data isfit without need for a central black hole; the central mass determinedpreviously from ground-based data therefore overestimates the actual black holemass. the mass-to-light ratio of the stars is m/l_v = 6 h_50.  the anisotropy structure of ngc 1600 with a radially anisotropic main bodyand more nearly isotropic centre is similar to that found recently in ngc 1399,ngc 2434, ngc 3379 and ngc 6703, suggesting that this pattern may be commonamongst massive elliptical galaxies. we discuss a possible merger origin of ngc1600 in the light of these results.
