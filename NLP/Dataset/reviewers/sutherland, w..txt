0902.2213	the macho project hst follow-up: the large magellanic cloud microlensing  source stars	we present hubble space telescope (hst) wfpc2 photometry of 13 microlensedsource stars from the 5.7 year large magellanic cloud (lmc) survey conducted bythe macho project. the microlensing source stars are identified by derivingaccurate centroids in the ground-based macho images using difference imageanalysis (dia) and then transforming the dia coordinates to the hst frame. noneof these sources is coincident with a background galaxy, which rules out thepossibility that the macho lmc microlensing sample is contaminated withmisidentified supernovae or agn in galaxies behind the lmc. this supports theconclusion that the macho lmc microlensing sample has only a small amount ofcontamination due to non-microlensing forms of variability. we compare thewfpc2 source star magnitudes with the lensed flux predictions derived frommicrolensing fits to the light curve data. in most cases the source starbrightness is accurately predicted. finally, we develop a statistic whichconstrains the location of the large magellanic cloud (lmc) microlensing sourcestars with respect to the distributions of stars and dust in the lmc andcompare this to the predictions of various models of lmc microlensing. thistest excludes at &gt; 90% confidence level models where more than 80% of thesource stars lie behind the lmc. exotic models that attempt to explain theexcess lmc microlensing optical depth seen by macho with a population ofbackground sources are disfavored or excluded by this test. models in whichmost of the lenses reside in a halo or spheroid distribution associated witheither the milky way or the lmc are consistent which these data, but lmc haloor spheroid models are favored by the combined macho and eros microlensingresults.

1007.5260	herschel-atlas: counterparts from the uv--nir in the science  demonstration phase catalogue	we present a technique to identify optical counterparts of 250 um-selectedsources from the herschel-atlas survey. of the 6621 250 um &gt; 32 mjy sources inour science demonstration catalogue we find that ~60 percent have counterpartsbrighter than r=22.4 mag in the sloan digital sky survey. applying a likelihoodratio technique we are able to identify 2423 of the counterparts with areliability r &gt; 0.8. this is approximately 37 percent of the full 250 microncatalogue. we have estimated photometric redshifts for each of these 2423reliable counterparts, while 1099 also have spectroscopic redshifts collatedfrom several different sources, including the gama survey. we estimate thecompleteness of identifying counterparts as a function of redshift, and presentevidence that 250 um-selected herschel-atlas galaxies have a bimodal redshiftdistribution. those with reliable optical identifications have a redshiftdistribution peaking at z ~ 0.25 +/- 0.05, while sub-mm colours suggest that asignificant fraction with no counterpart above the r-band limit have z &gt; 1. wealso suggest a method for selecting populations of strongly-lensed highredshift galaxies. our identifications are matched to uv--nir photometry fromthe gama survey, and these data are available as part of the herschel-atlaspublic data release.

1009.0616	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): dust obscuration in galaxies and their  recent star formation histories	we present self-consistent star formation rates derived through pan-spectralanalysis of galaxies drawn from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey. wedetermine the most appropriate form of dust obscuration correction viaapplication of a range of extinction laws drawn from the literature as appliedto halpha, [o{ii}] and uv luminosities. these corrections are applied to asample of 31,508 galaxies from the gama survey at z &lt; 0.35. we consider severaldifferent obscuration curves, including those of milky way, calzetti (2001) andfischera and dopita (2005) curves and their effects on the observedluminosities. at the core of this technique is the observed balmer decrement,and we provide a prescription to apply optimal obscuration corrections usingthe balmer decrement. we carry out an analysis of the star formation history(sfh) using stellar population synthesis tools to investigate the evolutionaryhistory of our sample of galaxies as well as to understand the effects ofvariation in the initial mass function (imf) and the effects this has on theevolutionary history of galaxies. we find that the fischera and dopita (2005)obscuration curve with an r_{v} value of 4.5 gives the best agreement betweenthe different sfr indicators. the 2200a feature needed to be removed from thiscurve to obtain complete consistency between all sfr indicators suggesting thatthis feature may not be common in the average integrated attenuation of galaxyemission. we also find that the uv dust obscuration is strongly dependent onthe sfr.

1103.3080	gama/h-atlas: the ultraviolet spectral slope and obscuration in galaxies	we use multiwavelength data from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) andherschel atlas (h-atlas) surveys to compare the relationship between variousdust obscuration measures in galaxies. we explore the connections between theultraviolet (uv) spectral slope, $\beta$, the balmer decrement, and the farinfrared (ir) to $150\,$nm far ultraviolet (fuv) luminosity ratio. we exploretrends with galaxy mass, star formation rate (sfr) and redshift in order toidentify possible systematics in these various measures. we reiterate thefinding of other authors that there is a large scatter between the balmerdecrement and the $\beta$ parameter, and that $\beta$ may be poorly constrainedwhen derived from only two broad passbands in the uv. we also emphasise thatfuv derived sfrs, corrected for dust obscuration using $\beta$, will beoverestimated unless a modified relation between $\beta$ and the attenuationfactor is used. even in the optimum case, the resulting sfrs have a significantscatter, well over an order of magnitude. while there is a stronger correlationbetween the ir to fuv luminosity ratio and $\beta$ parameter than with thebalmer decrement, neither of these correlations are particularly tight, anddust corrections based on $\beta$ for high redshift galaxy sfrs must be treatedwith caution. we conclude with a description of the extent to which thedifferent obscuration measures are consistent with each other as well as theeffects of including other galactic properties on these correlations.

1112.3653	spitzer irac identification of herschel-atlas spire sources	we use spitzer-irac data to identify near-infrared counterparts tosubmillimeter galaxies detected with herschel-spire at 250um in the herschelastrophysical terahertz large area survey (h-atlas). using a likelihood ratioanalysis we identify 146 reliable irac counterparts to 123 spire sources out ofthe 159. we find that, compared to the field population, the spire counterpartsoccupy a distinct region of 3.6 and 4.5um color-magnitude space, and we usethis property to identify a further 23 counterparts to 13 spire sources. theirac identification rate of 86% is significantly higher than those that havebeen demonstrated with wide-field ground-based optical and near-ir imaging ofherschel fields. we estimate a false identification rate of 3.6%, correspondingto 4 to 5 sources. among the 73 counterparts that are undetected in sdss, 57have both 3.6 and 4.5um coverage. of these 43 have [3.6] - [4.5]&gt; 0 indicatingthat they are likely to be at z &gt; 1.4. thus, ~ 40% of identified spire galaxiesare likely to be high redshift (z &gt; 1.4) sources. we discuss the statisticalproperties of the irac-identified spire galaxy sample including far-irluminosities, dust temperatures, star-formation rates, and stellar masses. themajority of our detected galaxies have 10^10 to 10^11 l_sun total irluminosities and are not intense starbursting galaxies as those found at z ~ 2,but they have a factor of 2 to 3 above average specific star-formation ratescompared to near-ir selected galaxy samples.

1202.0402	herschel-atlas: towards a sample of ~1000 strongly-lensed galaxies	while the selection of strongly lensed galaxies with 500{\mu}m flux densitys_500&gt;100 mjy has proven to be rather straightforward (negrello et al. 2010),for many applications it is important to analyze samples larger than the onesobtained when confining ourselves to such a bright limit. moreover, only byprobing to fainter flux densities is possible to exploit strong lensing toinvestigate the bulk of the high-z star-forming galaxy population. we describehalos (the herschel-atlas lensed objects selection), a method for efficientlyselecting fainter candidate strongly lensed galaxies, reaching a surfacedensity of ~1.5-2 deg^-2, i.e. a factor of about 4 to 6 higher than that at the100 mjy flux limit. halos will allow the selection of up to ~1000 candidatestrongly lensed galaxies (with amplifications \mu&gt;2) over the full h-atlassurvey area. applying halos to the h-atlas science demonstration phase field(~14.4 deg^2) we find 31 candidate strongly lensed galaxies, whose candidatelenses are identified in the viking near-infrared catalog. using the availableinformation on candidate sources and candidate lenses we tentatively estimate a~72% purity of the sample. the redshift distribution of the candidate lensedsources is close to that reported for most previous surveys for lensedgalaxies, while that of candidate lenses extends to substantially higherredshifts than found in the other surveys. the counts of candidate stronglylensed galaxies are also in good agreement with model predictions (lapi et al.2011). even though a key ingredient of the method is the deep near-infraredviking photometry, we show that h-atlas data alone allow the selection of asimilarly deep sample of candidate strongly lensed galaxies with an efficiencyclose to 50%; a slightly lower surface density (~1.45 deg^-2) can be reachedwith a ~70% efficiency.

1202.3891	herschel-atlas: vista viking near-ir counterparts in the phase 1 gama 9h  data	we identify near-infrared ks band counterparts to herschel-atlas sub-mmsources, using a preliminary object catalogue from the vista viking survey. thesub-mm sources are selected from the h-atlas phase 1 catalogue of the gama 9hfield, which includes all objects detected at 250, 350 or 500 um with the spireinstrument. we apply and discuss a likelihood ratio (lr) method for vikingcandidates within a search radius of 10" of the 22,000 spire sources with a 5sigma detection at 250 um. we find that 11,294(51%) of the spire sources have abest viking counterpart with a reliability $r\ge 0.8$, and the falseidentification rate of these is estimated to be 4.2%. we expect to miss ~5% oftrue viking counterparts. there is evidence from z-j and j-ks colours that thereliable counterparts to spire galaxies are marginally redder than the fieldpopulation. we obtain photometric redshifts for ~68% of all (non-stellar)viking candidates with a median redshift of 0.405. comparing to the results ofthe optical identifications supplied with the phase i catalogue, we find thatthe use of medium-deep near-infrared data improves the identification rate ofreliable counterparts from 36% to 51%.

1204.6586	ultravista: a new ultra-deep near-infrared survey in cosmos	in this paper we describe the first data release of the ultravistanear-infrared imaging survey of the cosmos field. we summarise the key goalsand design of the survey and provide a detailed description of our datareduction techniques . we provide stacked, sky-subtracted images in $yjhk_{\rms}$ and narrow-band filters constructed from data collected during the firstyear of ultravista observations. our stacked images reach $5\sigma$ $ab$ depthsin an aperture of $2\arcsec$ diameter of $\sim 25$ in $y$ and $\sim 24$ in$jhk_{\rm s}$ bands and all have sub-arcsecond seeing. to this $5\sigma$ limit,our $k_{\rm s}$ catalogue contains 216,268 sources. we carry out a series ofquality assessment tests on our images and catalogues, comparing our stackswith existing catalogues. the $1\sigma$ astrometric rms in both directions forstars selected with $17.0&lt;k_{\rm s}\rm {(ab)} &lt;19.5$ is $\sim 0.08\arcsec$ incomparison to the publicly-available cosmos acs catalogues. our images areresampled to the same pixel scale and tangent point as the publicly availablecosmos data and so may be easily used to generate multi-colour catalogues usingthis data. all images and catalogues presented in this paper are publiclyavailable through eso's "phase 3" archiving and distribution system and fromthe ultravista web site.

1205.1929	mining the herschel-atlas: submillimeter-selected blazars in equatorial  fields	the herschel astrophysical terahertz large area survey (h-atlas) provides anunprecedented opportunity to search for blazars at sub-mm wavelengths. wecross-matched the first radio source catalogue with the 11655 sources brighterthan 35 mjy at 500{\mu}m in the \sim 135 square degrees of the sky covered bythe h-atlas equatorial fields at 9 h and 15 h, plus half of the field at 12 h.we found that 379 of the h-atlas sources have a first counterpart within 10arcsec, including 8 catalogued blazars (plus one known blazar that was found atthe edge of one the h-atlas maps). to search for additional blazar candidateswe have devised new diagnostic diagrams and found that known blazars occupy aregion of the log(s500{\mu}m/s350{\mu}m) vs. log(s500{\mu}m/s1.4ghz) planeseparated from that of the other sub-mm sources with radio counterparts. usingthis diagnostic we have selected 12 further candidates that turn out to bescattered in the (r-z) vs. (u-r) plane or in the wise colour-colour diagramproposed by massaro et al. (2012), where known blazars are concentrated in welldefined strips. this suggests that the majority of them either are not blazarsor have spectral energy distributions contaminated by their host galaxies. asignificant fraction of true blazars are found to be hosted by star-forminggalaxies. this finding, supported by an analysis of blazars detected in planck545 and 857 ghz bands, is at odds with the notion that blazar hosts are passiveellipticals and indicates that the sub-mm selection is providing a novelprospect on blazar properties. based on an inspection of the availablephotometric data, including the wise all-sky survey, the unpublished vikingsurvey and new radio observations, we tentatively estimate that there are 11blazars with synchrotron flux density s500{\mu}m &gt; 35mjy over the consideredarea. this result already allows us to constrain blazar evolution models.

1206.4263	the vista deep extragalactic observations (video) survey	in this paper we describe the first data release of the the visible andinfrared survey telescope for astronomy (vista) deep extragalactic observations(video) survey. video is a ~12degree^2 survey in the near-infrared z,y,j,h andk_s bands, specifically designed to enable the evolution of galaxies and largestructures to be traced as a function of both epoch and environment from thepresent day out to z=4, and active galactic nuclei (agn) and the most massivegalaxies up to and into the epoch of reionization. with its depth and area,video will be able to fully explore the period in the universe where agn andstarburst activity were at their peak and the first galaxy clusters werebeginning to virialize. video therefore offers a unique data set with which toinvestigate the interplay between agn, starbursts and environment, and the roleof feedback at a time when it was potentially most crucial.  we provide data over the video-xmm3 tile, which also covers thecanada-france-hawaii-telescope legacy survey deep-1 field (cfhtls-d1). thereleased video data reach a 5-sigma ab-magnitude depth of z=25.7, y=24.5,j=24.4, h=24.1 and k_s=23.8 in 2 arcsec diameter apertures (the full depth ofy=24.6 will be reached within the full integration time in future releases).the data are compared to previous surveys over this field and we find goodastrometric agreement with the two-micron all sky survey, and source counts inagreement with the recently released ultravista survey data. the addition ofthe video data to the cfhtls-d1 optical data increases the accuracy ofphotometric redshifts and significantly reduces the fraction of catastrophicoutliers over the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;1 from 5.8 to 3.1 per cent in the absenceof an i-band luminosity prior.

1301.7127	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): spectroscopic analysis	the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey is a multiwavelength photometricand spectroscopic survey, using the aaomega spectrograph on theanglo-australian telescope to obtain spectra for up to ~300000 galaxies over280 square degrees, to a limiting magnitude of r_pet &lt; 19.8 mag. the targetgalaxies are distributed over 0&lt;z&lt;0.5 with a median redshift of z~0.2, althoughthe redshift distribution includes a small number of systems, primarilyquasars, at higher redshifts, up to and beyond z=1. the redshift accuracyranges from sigma_v~50km/s to sigma_v~100km/s depending on the signal-to-noiseof the spectrum. here we describe the gama spectroscopic reduction and analysispipeline. we present the steps involved in taking the raw two-dimensionalspectroscopic images through to flux-calibrated one-dimensional spectra. theresulting gama spectra cover an observed wavelength range of 3750&lt;lambda&lt;8850 aat a resolution of r~1300. the final flux calibration is typically accurate to10-20%, although the reliability is worse at the extreme wavelength ends, andpoorer in the blue than the red. we present details of the measurement ofemission and absorption features in the gama spectra. these measurements arecharacterised through a variety of quality control analyses detailing therobustness and reliability of the measurements. we illustrate the quality ofthe measurements with a brief exploration of elementary emission lineproperties of the galaxies in the gama sample. we demonstrate the luminositydependence of the balmer decrement, consistent with previously publishedresults, and explore further how balmer decrement varies with galaxy mass andredshift. we also investigate the mass and redshift dependencies of the[nii]/halpha vs [oiii]/hbeta spectral diagnostic diagram, commonly used todiscriminate between star forming and nuclear activity in galaxies.

1311.5898	herschel-atlas: deep hst/wfc3 imaging of strongly lensed submillimeter  galaxies	we report on deep near-infrared observations obtained with the wide fieldcamera 3 (wfc3) onboard the hubble space telescope (hst) of the first fiveconfirmed gravitational lensing events discovered by the herschel astrophysicalterahertz large area survey (h-atlas). we succeed in disentangling thebackground galaxy from the lens to gain separate photometry of the twocomponents. the hst data allow us to significantly improve on previousconstraints of the mass in stars of the lensed galaxy and to perform accuratelens modelling of these systems, as described in the accompanying paper by dyeet al. we fit the spectral energy distributions of the background sources fromnear-ir to millimetre wavelengths and use the magnification factors estimatedby dye et al. to derive the intrinsic properties of the lensed galaxies. wefind these galaxies to have star-formation rates of approximately 400 to 2000m_sol/yr, with approximately (6-25)x10^10 m_sol of their baryonic mass alreadyturned into stars. at these rates of star formation, all remaining moleculargas will be exhausted in less than 100 myr, reaching a final mass in stars of afew 10^11 m_sol. these galaxies are thus proto-ellipticals caught during theirmajor episode of star formation, and observed at the peak epoch z=1.5-3 of thecosmic star formation history of the universe.

astro-ph;0001272	the macho project: microlensing results from 5.7 years of lmc  observations	we report on our search for microlensing towards the large magellanic cloud(lmc). analysis of 5.7 years of photometry on 11.9 million stars in the lmcreveals 13 - 17 microlensing events. this is significantly more than the $\sim$2 to 4 events expected from lensing by known stellar populations. thetimescales ($\that$) of the events range from 34 to 230 days. we estimate themicrolensing optical depth towards the lmc from events with $2 &lt; \that &lt; 400$days to be 1.2 ^{+0.4}_ {-0.3} \ten{-7}$, with an additional 20% to 30% ofsystematic error. the spatial distribution of events is mildly inconsistentwith lmc/lmc disk self-lensing, but is consistent with an extended lensdistribution such as a milky way or lmc halo. interpreted in the context of agalactic dark matter halo, consisting partially of compact objects, a maximumlikelihood analysis gives a macho halo fraction of 20% for a typical halo modelwith a 95% confidence interval of 8% to 50%. a 100% macho halo is ruled out atthe 95% c.l. for all except our most extreme halo model. interpreted as agalactic halo population, the most likely macho mass is between $ 0.15 \msun$and $ 0.9 \msun$, depending on the halo model, and the total mass in machos outto 50 kpc is found to be 9+4-3 10^{10} msun, independent of the halo model.these results are marginally consistent with our previous results, but arelower by about a factor of two. besides a larger data set, this work alsoincludes an improved efficiency determination, improved likelihood analysis,and more thorough testing of systematic errors, especially with respect to thetreatment of potential backgrounds to microlensing, such as supernovae ingalaxies behind the lmc.

astro-ph;0001435	the macho project 9 million star color-magnitude diagram of the large  magellanic cloud	we present a 9 million star color-magnitude diagram (9m cmd) of the lmc bar.the 9m cmd reveals a complex superposition of different age and metallicitystellar populations, with important stellar evolutionary phases occurring over3 orders of magnitude in number density. first, we count the non-variablesupergiants, the associated cepheids, and measure the effective temperaturesdefining the instability strip. lifetime predictions of stellar evolutiontheory are tested, with implications for the origin of low-luminosity cepheids.the highly-evolved agb stars have a bimodal distribution in brightness, whichwe interpret as discrete old populations (&gt;1 gyr). the faint agb may bemetal-poor and very old. we identify the clusters ngc 411 and m3 as templatesfor the admixture of old stellar populations. however, there are indicationsthat the old and metal-poor field population has a red hb morphology: the rrlyraes lie on the red edge of the instability strip, the agb-bump is very red,and the ratio of agb-bump stars to rr lyraes is quite large. if the hb secondparameter is age, the old and metal-poor field population likely formed afterthe oldest clusters. lifetime predictions of stellar evolution theory lead usto associate a significant fraction of the red hb clump giants with the sameold and metal-poor population producing the rr lyraes and the agb-bump. in thiscase, compared to the age-dependent luminosity predictions of stellar evolutiontheory, the red hb clump is too bright relative to the rr lyraes and agb-bump.last, the surface density profile of rr lyraes is fit by an exponential,favoring a disk-like rather than spheroidal distribution. we conclude that theage of the lmc disk is probably similar to the age of the galactic disk.(abridged)

astro-ph;0002510	the macho project: microlensing optical depth towards the galactic bulge  from difference image analysis	we present the microlensing optical depth towards the galactic bulge based onthe detection of 99 events found in our difference image analysis (dia) survey.this analysis encompasses three years of data, covering ~ 17 million stars in ~4 deg^2, to a source star baseline magnitude limit of v = 23. the dia techniqueimproves the quality of photometry in crowded fields, and allows us to detectmore microlensing events with faint source stars. we find this method increasesthe number of detection events by 85% compared with the standard analysistechnique. dia light curves of the events are presented and the microlensingfit parameters are given. the total microlensing optical depth is estimated tobe tau_(total)= 2.43^(+0.39/-0.38) x 10^(-6) averaged over 8 fields centered atl=2.68 and b=-3.35. for the bulge component we findtau_(bulge)=3.23^(+0.52/-0.50) x 10^(-6) assuming a 25% stellar contributionfrom disk sources. these optical depths are in good agreement with the pastdeterminations of the macho alcock et al. (1997) and ogle udalski et al. (1994)groups, and are higher than predicted by contemporary galactic models. we showthat our observed event timescale distribution is consistent with thedistribution expected from normal mass stars, if we adopt the stellar massfunction of scalo (1986) as our lens mass function. however, we note that asthere is still disagreement about the exact form of the stellar mass function,there is uncertainty in this conclusion. based on our event timescaledistribution we find no evidence for the existence of a large population ofbrown dwarfs in the direction of the galactic bulge.

astro-ph;0003392	the macho project: microlensing detection efficiency	the macho project is a search for dark matter in the form of massive compacthalo objects (machos). the project has photometrically monitored tens ofmillions of stars in the large magellanic cloud (lmc), small magellanic cloud(smc), and galactic bulge in search of rare gravitational microlensing eventscaused by these otherwise invisible objects. in 5.7 years of observationstoward the lmc some 13-17 microlensing events have been observed by the machosurvey, allowing powerful statements to be made about the nature of the darkpopulation in the halo of our galaxy. a critical component of these statementsis an accurate determination of the survey's detection efficiency. thedetection efficiency is a complicated function of temporal sampling, stellarcrowding (the luminosity function), image quality, photometry, time-seriesanalysis, and criteria used to select the microlensing candidates. such acomplex interdependence is most naturally solved using a monte carlo approach.here we describe the details of the monte carlo used to calculate theefficiency presented in the macho 5.7-year lmc results. here we correct severalshortcomings of past determinations, including (1) adding fainter source stars(2.5 magnitudes below our faintest detected "stars"), (2) an up-to-dateluminosity function for the lmc, (3) better sampling of real images in bothstellar density and observing conditions, (4) an improved scheme for addingartificial microlensing onto a random sample of real lightcurves, and manyother improvements.

astro-ph;0012027	predicting the peculiar velocities of nearby psc-z galaxies using the  least action principle	we use the least action principle to predict the peculiar velocities of psc-zgalaxies inside $cz=2000$\km. linear theory is used to account for tidaleffects to $cz=15000$\km, and we iterate galaxy positions to account forredshift distortions. as the least action principle is valid beyond lineartheory, we can predict reliable peculiar velocities even for very nearbygalaxies (ie $cz \leq 500$\km). these predicted peculiar velocities are thencompared with the observed velocities of 12 galaxies with cepheid distances.the combination of the psc-z galaxy survey (with its large sky coverage anduniform selection), with the accurate cepheid distances, makes this comparisonrelatively free from systematic effects. we find that galaxies are good tracersof the mass, even at small ($\leq 10$\mpc) scales; and under the assumption ofno biasing, $0.25 \leq \beta \leq 0.75$ (at 90% confidence). we use thereliable predicted peculiar velocities to estimate the hubble constant \ho fromthe local volume without ``stepping up'' the distance ladder, finding aconfidence range of 65-75\kmm (at 90% confidence).

astro-ph;0101094	mass-losing semiregular variable stars in baade's windows	by cross-correlating the results of two recent large-scale surveys, thegeneral properties of a well defined sample of semi-regular variable stars havebeen determined. isogal mid-infrared photometry and macho lightcurves areassembled for approximately 300 stars in the baade's windows of low extinctiontowards the galactic bulge. these stars are mainly giants of late m spectraltype, evolving along the asymptotic giant branch (agb). they are found topossess a wide and continuous distribution of pulsation periods and to obey anapproximate log~period -- bolometric magnitude relation or set of suchrelations.  approximate mass-loss rates in the range of 1e-8 to 5e-7 m_sun per year arederived from isogal mid-infrared photometry and models of stellar spectraadjusted for the presence of optically-thin circumstellar silicate dust.mass-loss rates depend on luminosity and pulsation period. some stars lose massas rapidly as short-period miras but do not show mira-like amplitudes. a periodof 70 days or longer is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for massloss to occur.  for agb stars in the mass-loss ranges that we observe, the functionaldependence of mass-loss rate on temperature and luminosity is found to be inagreement with recent theoretical predictions. if we include our mass-lossrates with a sample of extreme mass-losing agb stars in the large magellaniccloud, we get the general result for agb stars that mass-loss rate isproportional to luminosity^{2.7}, valid for agb stars with 10^{-8} to 10^{-4}m_sun per year (abridged).

astro-ph;0106430	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: the population of nearby radio galaxies  at the 1 mjy level	we use redshift determinations and spectral analysis of galaxies in the 2dfgalaxy redshift survey to study the properties of local radio sources with$s\ge 1$ mjy. 557 objects drawn from the first survey, corresponding to 2.3 percent of the total radio sample, are found in the 2dfgrs cataloge within thearea $9^h 48^m \simlt {\rm ra}({\rm 2000}) \simlt 14^h 32^m$ and $-2.77^\circ\simlt {\rm dec}({\rm 2000}) \simlt 2.25^\circ$, down to a magnitude limit$b_j= 19.45$. the excellent quality of 2df spectra allows us to divide thesesources into classes, according to their optical spectra. radio galaxies (i.e.absorption systems, mainly belonging to the class of fr i sources, whosespectra may or may not show emission lines due to agn activity) make up 63 percent of the spectroscopic sample; they are characterized by relatively highradio-to-optical ratios, red colours and luminosities $10^{21}\simlt p_{1.4{\rmghz}} w hz^${-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ \simlt 10^{24}$. actively star-forming galaxiesinstead contribute with 30 per cent to the total sample. these objects --principally found at low redshifts ($z \simlt 0.1$) -- in general show lowradio-to-optical ratios, blue colours and low radio luminosities. we also found18 seyfert 2 galaxies and 4 seyfert 1's. analysis of the local radio luminosityfunction shows that radio galaxies are well described by models that assumepure luminosity evolution, at least down to radio powers $p_{1.4{\rmghz}}\simlt 10^{20.5} w hz$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ late-type galaxies, whose relativecontribution to the rlf is found to be lower than was predicted by previouswork, present a luminosity function which is compatible with the iras galaxylf, and therefore plausibly constitute the radio counterpart of the dustyspirals and starbursts that dominate the counts at 60 $\mu$m.

astro-ph;0109467	gravitational microlensing events due to stellar mass black holes	we present an analysis of the longest timescale microlensing eventsdiscovered by the macho collaboration during a 7 year survey of the galacticbulge. we find 6 events that exhibit very strong microlensing parallax signalsdue, in part, to accurate photometric data from the gman and mpscollaborations. the microlensing parallax fit parameters are used in alikelihood analysis, which is able to estimate the distance and masses of thelens objects based upon a standard model of the galactic velocity distribution.this analysis indicates that the most likely masses of 5 of the 6 lenses are &gt;1 msun, which suggests that a substantial fraction of the galactic lenses maybe massive stellar remnants. this could explain the observed excess of longtimescale microlensing events. the lenses for events macho-96-blg-5 andmacho-98-blg-6 are the most massive, with mass estimates of m/msun = 6 +10/-3and m/msun = 6 +7/-3, respectively. the observed upper limits on the absolutebrightness of main sequence stars for these lenses are &lt; 1 lsun, so both lensesare black hole candidates. the black hole interpretation is also favored by alikelihood analysis with a bayesian prior using a conventional model for thelens mass function. we consider the possibility that the source stars for someof these 6 events may lie in the foreground or background of the galacticbulge, but we find that this is unlikely. future hst observations of theseevents can either confirm the black hole lens hypothesis or detect the lensstars and provide a direct measurement of their masses. future observations ofsimilar events by sim or the keck or vlti interferometers will allow directmeasurements of the lens masses for stellar remnant lenses as well.

astro-ph;0303668	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: galaxy clustering per spectral type	we have calculated the two-point correlation functions in redshift space,xi(sigma,pi), for galaxies of different spectral types in the 2df galaxyredshift survey. using these correlation functions we are able to estimatevalues of the linear redshift-space distortion parameter, beta = omega_m^0.6/b,the pairwise velocity dispersion, a, and the real-space correlation function,xi(r), for galaxies with both relatively low star-formation rates (for whichthe present rate of star formation is less than 10% of its past averaged value)and galaxies with higher current star-formation activity. at small separations,the real-space clustering of passive galaxies is very much stronger than thatof the more actively star-forming galaxies; the correlation-function slopes arerespectively 1.93 and 1.50, and the relative bias between the two classes is adeclining function of radius. on scales larger than 10 h^-1 mpc there isevidence that the relative bias tends to a constant, b(passive)/b(active) ~ 1.this result is consistent with the similar degrees of redshift-spacedistortions seen in the correlation functions of the two classes -- thecontours of xi(sigma,pi) require beta(active)=0.49+/-0.13, andbeta(passive)=0.48+/-0.14. the pairwise velocity dispersion is highlycorrelated with beta. however, despite this a significant difference is seenbetween the two classes. over the range 8-20 h^-1 mpc, the pairwise velocitydispersion has mean values 416+/-76 km/s and 612+/-92 km/s for the active andpassive galaxy samples respectively. this is consistent with the expectationfrom morphological segregation, in which passively evolving galaxiespreferentially inhabit the cores of high-mass virialised regions.

astro-ph;0401405	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: hierarchical galaxy clustering	we use the two-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) to test thehierarchical scaling hypothesis: namely, that the $p$-point galaxy correlationfunctions can be written in terms of the two point correlation function orvariance. this scaling is expected if an initially gaussian distribution ofdensity fluctuations evolves under the action of gravitational instability. wemeasure the volume averaged $p$-point correlation functions using a counts incells technique applied to a volume limited sample of 44,931 $l_*$ galaxies. wedemonstrate that $l_{*}$ galaxies display hierarchical clustering up to order$p=6$ in redshift space. the variance measured for $l_{*}$ galaxies is inexcellent agreement with the predictions from a $\lambda$-cold dark mattern-body simulation. this applies to all cell radii considered,$0.3&lt;(r/h^{-1}{\rm mpc})&lt;30$. however, the higher order correlation functionsof $l_*$ galaxies have a significantly smaller amplitude than is predicted forthe dark matter for $r&lt;10h^{-1}$mpc. this disagreement implies that anon-linear bias exists between the dark matter and $l_*$ galaxies on thesescales. we also show that the presence of two rare, massive superclusters inthe 2dfgrs has an impact on the higher-order clustering moments measured onlarge scales.

astro-ph;0401406	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: voids and hierarchical scaling models	we measure the redshift space reduced void probability function (vpf) for2dfgrs volume limited galaxy samples covering the absolute magnitude rangem_bj-5logh=-18 to -22. theoretically, the vpf connects the distribution ofvoids to the moments of galaxy clustering of all orders, and can be used todiscriminate clustering models in the weakly non-linear regime. the reduced vpfmeasured from the 2dfgrs is in excellent agreement with the paradigm ofhierarchical scaling of the galaxy clustering moments. the accuracy of ourmeasurement is such that we can rule out, at a very high significance, popularmodels for galaxy clustering, including the lognormal distribution. wedemonstrate that the negative binomial model gives a very good approximation tothe 2dfgrs data over a wide range of scales, out to at least 20h-1mpc.conversely, the reduced vpf for dark matter in a lambdacdm universe does appearto be lognormal on small scales but deviates significantly beyond \approx4h-1mpc. we find little dependence of the 2dfgrs reduced vpf on galaxyluminosity. our results hold independently in both the north and south galacticpole survey regions.

astro-ph;0402566	galaxy groups in the 2dfgrs: the luminous content of the groups	the 2dfgrs percolation-inferred galaxy group (2pigg) catalogue of ~29000objects is used to study the luminous content of galaxy systems of varioussizes. mock galaxy catalogues constructed from cosmological simulations areused to gauge the accuracy with which intrinsic group properties can berecovered. a schechter function is found to be a reasonable fit to the galaxyluminosity functions in groups of different mass in the real data. thecharacteristic luminosity l* is larger for more massive groups. however, themock data show that the shape of the recovered luminosity function is expectedto differ from the true shape, and this must be allowed for when interpretingthe data. the variation of halo mass-to-light ratio with group size is studiedin both these wavebands. a robust trend of increasing m/l with increasing groupluminosity is found in the 2pigg data. from groups with l_bj=10^{10}lsol tothose 100 times more luminous, the typical bj-band m/l increases by a factor of5, whereas the rf-band m/l grows by a factor of 3.5. these trends agree wellwith the simulations, which also predict a minimum m/l on a scale correspondingto the local group. our data indicate that if such a minimum exists, then itmust occur at l&lt;~10^{10}lsol, below the range accurately probed by the 2piggcatalogue. according to the mock data, the bj m/ls of the largest groups areexpected to be approximately 1.1 times the global value. assuming that thiscorrection applies to the real data yields an estimate of omega_m=0.26+/-0.03(statistical).

astro-ph;0404275	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: stochastic relative biasing between  galaxy populations	it is well known that the clustering of galaxies depends on galaxy type.suchrelative bias complicates the inference of cosmological parameters from galaxyredshift surveys, and is a challenge to theories of galaxy formation andevolution. in this paper we perform a joint counts-in-cells analysis ongalaxies in the 2df galaxy redshift survey, classified by both colour andspectral type, eta, as early or late type galaxies. we fit three differentmodels of relative bias to the joint probability distribution of the cellcounts, assuming poisson sampling of the galaxy density field. we investigatethe nonlinearity and stochasticity of the relative bias, with cubical cells ofside 10mpc \leq l \leq 45mpc (h=0.7). exact linear bias is ruled out with highsignificance on all scales. power law bias gives a better fit, but likelihoodratios prefer a bivariate lognormal distribution, with a non-zero`stochasticity' - i.e. scatter that may result from physical effects on galaxyformation other than those from the local density field. using this model, wemeasure a correlation coefficient in log-density space (r_ln) of 0.958 forcells of length l=10mpc, increasing to 0.970 by l=45mpc. this corresponds to astochasticity sigma_b/bhat of 0.44\pm0.02 and 0.27\pm0.05 respectively. forsmaller cells, the poisson sampled lognormal distribution presents anincreasingly poor fit to the data, especially with regard to the fraction ofcompletely empty cells. we compare these trends with the predictions ofsemianalytic galaxy formation models: these match the data well in terms ofoverall level of stochasticity, variation with scale, and fraction of emptycells.

astro-ph;0404276	the nature of the relative bias between galaxies of different spectral  type in 2dfgrs	we present an analysis of the relative bias between early- and late-typegalaxies in the two-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs). our analysisexamines the joint counts in cells between early- and late-type galaxies, usingapproximately cubical cells with sides ranging from 7h^{-1}mpc to 42h^{-1}mpc.we measure the variance of the counts in cells using the method of efstathiouet al. (1990), which we find requires a correction for a finite volume effect.we fit lognormal models to the one-point density distribution and developmethods of dealing with biases in the recovered variances resulting from thistechnique. we directly fit deterministic models for the joint densitydistribution function, f(delta_e,delta_l), to the joint counts in cells using amaximum likelihood technique. our results are consistent with a scale invariantrelative bias factor on all scales studied. linear bias is ruled out on scalesless than l=28h^{-1}mpc. a power-law bias model is a significantly better fitto the data on all but the largest scales studied; the relative goodness of fitof this model as compared to that of the linear bias model suggests that anynonlinearity is negligible for l&gt;~40h^{-1}mpc, consistent with the expectationfrom theory that the bias should become linear on large scales.

astro-ph;0407537	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: luminosity functions by density  environment and galaxy type	we use the 2df galaxy redshift survey to measure the dependence of thebj-band galaxy luminosity function on large-scale environment, defined bydensity contrast in spheres of radius 8h-1mpc, and on spectral type, determinedfrom principal component analysis. we find that the galaxy populations at bothextremes of density differ significantly from that at the mean density. thepopulation in voids is dominated by late types and shows, relative to the mean,a deficit of galaxies that becomes increasingly pronounced at magnitudesbrighter than m_bj-5log10h &lt;-18.5. in contrast, cluster regions have a relativeexcess of very bright early-type galaxies with m_bj-5log10h &lt; -21. differencesin the mid to faint-end population between environments are significant: atm_bj-5log10h=-18 early and late-type cluster galaxies show comparableabundances, whereas in voids the late types dominate by almost an order ofmagnitude. we find that the luminosity functions measured in all densityenvironments, from voids to clusters, can be approximated by schechterfunctions with parameters that vary smoothly with local density, but in afashion which differs strikingly for early and late-type galaxies. theseobserved variations, combined with our finding that the faint-end slope of theoverall luminosity function depends at most weakly on density environment, mayprove to be a significant challenge for models of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0410319	microlensing optical depth towards the galactic bulge using clump giants  from the macho survey	using 7 years of macho survey data, we present a new determination of theoptical depth to microlensing towards the galactic bulge. we select the sampleof 62 microlensing events (60 unique) on clump giant sources and perform adetailed efficiency analysis. we use only the clump giant sources because theseare bright bulge stars and are not as strongly affected by blending as otherevents. using a subsample of 42 clump events concentrated in just 4.5 squaredegrees, we find tau = 2.17^{+0.47}_{-0.38} x 10^{-6} at (l,b) = (1.50, -2.68),somewhat smaller than found in most previous macho studies, but in excellentagreement with recent theoretical predictions. we also present the opticaldepth in each of the 19 fields in which we detected events, and find limits onoptical depth for fields with no events. the errors in optical depth inindividual fields are dominated by poisson noise. we measure optical depthgradients (1.06 +/- 0.71) x 10^{-6} deg^{-1} and (0.29 +/- 0.43) x 10^{-6}deg^{-1} in the galactic latitude b and longitude l directions, respectively.finally, we discuss the possibility of anomalous duration distribution ofevents in the field 104 centered on (l,b) = (3.11, -3.01) as well asinvestigate spatial clustering of events in all fields.

astro-ph;0501174	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: power-spectrum analysis of the final  dataset and cosmological implications	we present a power spectrum analysis of the final 2df galaxy redshift survey,employing a direct fourier method. the sample used comprises 221,414 galaxieswith measured redshifts. we investigate in detail the modelling of the sampleselection. a new angular mask is derived, based on revisions to the photometriccalibration. the redshift selection function is determined by dividing thesurvey according to rest-frame colour, and deducing a self-consistent treatmentof k-corrections and evolution for each population. the covariance matrix forthe power-spectrum estimates is determined using two different approaches tothe construction of mock surveys which are used to demonstrate that the inputcosmological model can be correctly recovered. we are confident that the 2dfgrspower spectrum can be used to infer the matter content of the universe. onlarge scales, our estimated power spectrum shows evidence for the `baryonoscillations' that are predicted in cdm models. fitting to a cdm model,assuming a primordial $n_{s}=1$ spectrum, $h=0.72$ and negligible neutrinomass, the preferred parameters are $\omega_{m} h = 0.168 \pm 0.016$ and abaryon fraction $\omega_{b} /\omega_{m} = 0.185\pm0.046$ (1$\sigma$ errors).the value of $\omega_{m} h$ is $1\sigma$ lower than the $0.20 \pm 0.03$ in our2001 analysis of the partially complete 2dfgrs. this shift is largely due tothe signal from the newly-sampled regions of space, rather than the refinementsin the treatment of observational selection. this analysis therefore implies adensity significantly below the standard $\omega_{m} =0.3$: in combination withcmb data from wmap, we infer $\omega_{m} =0.231\pm 0.021$.

astro-ph;9309052	possible gravitational microlensing of a star in the large magellanic  cloud	there is now abundant evidence for the presence of large quantities of unseenmatter surrounding normal galaxies, including our own$^{1,2}$. the nature ofthis `dark matter' is unknown, except that it cannot be made of normal stars,dust, or gas, as they would be easily detected. exotic particles such asaxions, massive neutrinos or other weakly interacting massive particles(collectively known as wimps) have been proposed)$^{3,4}$, but have yet to bedetected. a less exotic alternative is normal matter in the form of bodies withmasses ranging from that of a large planet to a few $ \msun$. such objects,known collectively as massive compact halo objects$^5$ (machos) might be browndwarfs or `jupiters' (bodies too small to produce their own energy by fusion),neutron stars, old white dwarfs, or black holes. paczynski$^6$ suggested thatmachos might act as gravitational microlenses, occasionally causing theapparent brightness of distant background stars temporarily to increase. we areconducting a microlensing experiment to determine whether the dark matter haloof our galaxy is made up of machos. here we report a candidate for amicrolensing event, detected by monitoring the light curves of 1.8 millionstars in the large magellanic cloud for one year. the light curve shows novariation for most of the year of data taking, and an upward excursion lastingover 1 month, with a maximum increase of $\approx \bf 2$ mag. the most probablelens mass, inferred from the duration of the event, is $\bf \sim 0.1 \,\msun$.

astro-ph;9411019	theory of exploring the dark halo with microlensing 1: power--law models	the detection of microlensing has opened the way for the development of newmethods in galactic astronomy. this series of papers investigates whatmicrolensing can teach us about the structure and shape of the dark halo. inthis paper we present formulas for the microlensing rate, optical depth andevent duration distributions for a simple set of axisymmetric disk-halo models.the halos are based on the "power--law models" which have simple velocitydistributions. using these models, we show that there is a large uncertainty inthe predicted microlensing rate because of uncertainty in the halo parameters.for example, models which reproduce the measured galactic observables to withintheir errors still differ in microlensing rate towards the magellanic clouds bymore than a factor of ten. we find that while the more easily computed opticaldepth correlates well with microlensing rate, the ratio of optical depth torate can vary by a factor of two (or greater if the disk is maximal).comparison of microlensing rates towards the large and small magellanic clouds(lmc and smc) and m31 can be used to aid determinations of the halo flatteningand rotation curve slope. for example, the ratio of microlensing rates towardsthe lmc and smc is $\sim 0.7-0.8$ for e0 halos and $\sim 1.0 - 1.2$ for e7halos (c.f. sackett \&amp; gould 1993). once the flattening has been established,the ratio of microlensing rates towards m31 and the lmc may help to distinguishbetween models with rising, flat or falling rotation curves. comparison ofrates along lmc and galactic bulge lines-of-sight gives useful information onthe halo core radius, although this may not be so easy to extract in practice.maximal disk models provide substantially smaller halo optical depths, shorterevent durations and even larger model uncertainties.

astro-ph;9506114	first observation of parallax in a gravitational microlensing event	we present the first detection of parallax effects in a gravitationalmicrolensing event. parallax in a gravitational microlensing event observedonly from the earth appears as a distortion of the lightcurve due to the motionof the earth around the sun. this distortion can be detected if the eventduration is not much less than a year and if the projected velocity of the lensis not much larger than the orbital velocity of the earth about the sun. theevent presented here has a duration of 220 days and clearly shows thedistortion due to the earth's motion. we find that the projected velocity ofthe lens is 75+/-5 km/s at an angle of 28+/-4 deg from the direction ofincreasing galactic longitude, as expected for a lens in the galactic disk.  a likelihood analysis yields estimates of the distance to and mass of thelens: d_{lens} = 1.7 (+1.1/-0.7) kpc and m = 1.3 (+1.3/-0.6) msun, suggestingthat the lens is a remnant such as a white dwarf or neutron star. a less likelypossibility is that the lens is a main sequence star. if so, we can add ourupper limit on the observed flux from the lens to the analysis. this modifiesthe estimates to: d_{lens} = 2.8 (+1.1/-0.6) kpc, and m = 0.6 (+0.4/-0.2) msun.

astro-ph;9608036	the macho project lmc variable star inventory iv: multimode rr lyrae  stars, distance to the lmc and age of the oldest stars	we report the discovery of 73 double-mode rr lyrae (rrd) stars in fields nearthe bar of the lmc. the stars are detected among the macho database ofshort-period variables that currently contains about 7900 rr lyrae stars.fundamental periods (p_0) for these stars are found in the range 0.46-0.55 daysand first overtone-to-fundamental period ratios are found to be in the range0.742 &lt; p_1/p_0 &lt; 0.748. a significant fraction of our current sample haveperiod ratios smaller than any previously discovered rrd variables. we presentmean magnitudes, colors, and lightcurve properties for all lmc rrd starsdetected to date. the range in period ratios is unexpectedly large.  we present a determination of absolute magnitudes for these stars basedprimarily on pulsation theory and the assumption that all observed stars are atthe fundamental blue edge (fbe) of the instability strip. comparison of thecalibrated macho v and r_kc photometry with these derived absolute magnitudesyields an absorption-corrected distance modulus to the lmc of 18.57 +/- 0.19mag which is in good agreement with that found (18.5) through comparison ofgalactic and lmc cepheids.  adopting this luminosity calibration, we derive an increase in the distancemodulus, and thus a reduction in the age found via isochrone fitting for m15 ofabout 33% and discuss the implications for cosmology.

astro-ph;9702199	macho alert 95-30 : first real-time observation of extended source  effects in gravitational microlensing	we present analysis of macho alert 95-30, a dramatic gravitationalmicrolensing event towards the galactic bulge whose peak magnification departssignificantly from the standard point-source microlensing model. alert 95-30was observed in real-time by the global microlensing alert network (gman),which obtained densely sampled photometric and spectroscopic data throughoutthe event. we interpret the light-curve ``fine structure'' as indicatingtransit of the lens across the extended face of the source star. this signifiesresolution of a star several kpc distant. we find a lens angular impactparameter theta_{min}/theta_{source} = 0.715 +/- 0.003. this information, alongwith the radius and distance of the source, provides an additional constrainton the lensing system. spectroscopic and photometric data indicate the sourceis an m4 iii star of radius 61 +/- 12 rsun, located on the far side of thebulge at 9 kpc. we derive a lens angular velocity, relative to the source, of21.5 +/- 4.9 km/s/kpc, where the error is dominated by uncertainty in thesource radius. likelihood analysis yields a median lens mass of0.67{+2.53}{-0.46} msun, located with 80% probability in the galactic bulge ata distance of 6.93{+1.56}{-2.25} kpc. if the lens is a main-sequence star, wecan include constraints on the lens luminosity. this modifies our estimates tom_lens = 0.53{+0.52}{-0.35} msun and d_lens = 6.57{+0.99}{-2.25} kpc. spectrataken during the event show that the absorption line equivalent widths of halpha and the tio bands near 6700 a vary, as predicted for microlensing of anextended source. this is most likely due to center-to-limb variation in thestellar spectral lines. these data demonstrate the feasibility of usingmicrolensing limb crossings as a tool to probe stellar atmospheres directly.

astro-ph;9712228	the topology of the iras point source catalogue redshift survey	we investigate the topology of the new point source catalogue redshift survey(pscz) of iras galaxies by means of the genus statistic. the survey maps thelocal universe with approximately 15000 galaxies over 84.1 per cent of the skyand provides an unprecedented number of resolution elements for the topologicalanalysis. for comparison with the pscz data we also examine the genus of largen-body simulations of four variants of the cold dark matter cosmogony. thesimulations are part of the virgo project to simulate the formation ofstructure in the universe. we assume that the statistical properties of thegalaxy distribution can be identified with those of the dark matter particlesin the simulations. we extend the standard genus analysis by examining theinfluence of sampling noise on the genus curve and introducing a statistic ableto quantify the amount of phase correlation present in the density field, the"amplitude drop" of the genus compared to a gaussian field with identical powerspectrum. the results for pscz are consistent with the hypothesis ofrandom-phase initial conditions. in particular, no strong phase correlation isdetected on scales ranging from 10 h^(-1)mpc to 32 h^(-1)mpc, whereas there isa positive detection of phase correlation at smaller scales. among thesimulations, phase correlations are detected in all models at small scales,albeit with different strengths. when scaled to a common normalization, theamplitude drop primarily depends on the shape of the power spectrum. we findthat the constant bias standard cdm model can be ruled out at high significancebecause the shape of its power spectrum is not consistent with pscz. the othercdm models with more large-scale power all fit the pscz data almost equallywell, with a slight preference for a high-density taucdm model.

astro-ph;9807163	discovery and characterization of a caustic crossing microlensing event  in the smc	we present photometric observations and analysis of the second microlensingevent detected towards the small magellanic cloud (smc), macho alert 98-smc-1.this event was detected early enough to allow intensive observation of thelightcurve. these observations revealed 98-smc-1 to be the first causticcrossing, binary microlensing event towards the magellanic clouds to bediscovered in progress.  frequent coverage of the evolving lightcurve allowed an accurate predictionfor the date of the source crossing out of the lens caustic structure. thecaustic crossing temporal width, along with the angular size of the sourcestar, measures the proper motion of the lens with respect to the source, andthus allows an estimate of the location of the lens. lenses located in thegalactic halo would have a velocity projected to the smc of v^hat ~1500 km/s,while an smc lens would typically have v^hat ~60 km/s.  we have performed a joint fit to the macho/gman data presented here,including recent eros data of this event. these joint data are sufficient toconstrain the time for the lens to move an angle equal to the source angularradius; 0.116 +/- 0.010 days. we estimate a radius for the lensed source of 1.4+/- 0.1 r_sun. this yields a projected velocity of v^hat = 84 +/- 9 km/s. only0.15% of halo lenses would be expected to have a v^hat value at least as smallas this, while 31% of smc lenses would be expected to have v^hat as large asthis. this implies that the lensing system is more likely to reside in the smcthan in the galactic halo.

astro-ph;9811240	the macho project large magellanic cloud variable star inventory. viii.  the recent star formation history of the lmc from the cepheid period  distribution	we present an analysis of the period distribution of $\sim 1800$ cepheids inthe large magellanic cloud, based on data obtained by the macho microlensingexperiment and on a previous catalogue by payne-gaposchkin. using stellarevolution and pulsation models, we construct theoretical period-frequencydistributions that are compared to the observations. these models reveal that asignificant burst of star formation has occurred recently in the lmc ($\sim1.15\times 10^8$ years). we also show that during the last $\sim 10^8$ years,the main center of star formation has been propagating from se to nw along thebar. we find that the evolutionary masses of cepheids are still smaller thanpulsation masses by $\sim 7$ % and that the red edge of the cepheid instabilitystrip could be slightly bluer than indicated by theory. there are $\sim 600$cepheids with periods below $\sim 2.5$ days cannot be explained by evolutiontheory. we suggest that they are anomalous cepheids; a number of these starsare double-mode cepheids.

astro-ph;9901087	likelihood analysis of the local group acceleration	we compute the acceleration on the local group using 11206 iras galaxies fromthe recently completed all-sky pscz redshift survey. measuring the accelerationvector in redshift space generates systematic uncertainties due to the redshiftspace distortions in the density field. we therefore assign galaxies to theirreal space positions by adopting a non-parametric model for the velocity fieldthat solely relies on the linear gravitational instability and linear biasinghypotheses. remaining systematic contributions to the measured accelerationvector are corrected for by using pscz mock catalogues from n-body experiments.the resulting acceleration vector points approx. 15 degrees away from the cmbdipole apex, with a remarkable alignment between small and large scalecontributions. a considerable fraction of the measured acceleration isgenerated within 40 h-1 mpc with a non-negligible contribution from scalesbetween 90 and 140 h-1 mpc after which the acceleration amplitude seems to haveconverged. the local group acceleration from pscz appears to be consistent withthe one determined from the iras 1.2 jy galaxy catalogue once the differentcontributions from shot noise have been taken into account. the results areconsistent with the gravitational instability hypothesis and do not indicateany strong deviations from the linear biasing relation on large scales. amaximum-likelihood analysis of the comulative pscz dipole is performed within aradius of 150 h-1 mpc in which we account for nonlinear effects, shot noise andfinite sample size. we obtain \beta = 0.70 (+ 0.35)(-0.2) at 1 \sigmaconfidence level.

astro-ph;9901189	the power spectrum of the psc redshift survey	we measure the redshift-space power spectrum p(k) for the recently completediras point source catalogue (psc) redshift survey, which contains 14500galaxies over 84% of the sky with 60 micron flux &gt;= 0.6 jansky. comparison withsimulations shows that our estimated errors on p(k) are realistic, and thatsystematic errors due to the finite survey volume are small for wavenumbers k&gt;~ 0.03 h mpc^-1. at large scales our power spectrum is intermediate betweenthose of the earlier qdot and 1.2 jansky surveys, but with considerably smallererror bars; it falls slightly more steeply to smaller scales. we have fittedfamilies of cdm-like models using the peacock-dodds formula for non-linearevolution; the results are somewhat sensitive to the assumed small-scalevelocity dispersion \sigma_v. assuming a realistic \sigma_v \approx 300 km/syields a shape parameter \gamma ~ 0.25 and normalisation b \sigma_8 ~ 0.75; if\sigma_v is as high as 600 km/s then \gamma = 0.5 is only marginally excluded.there is little evidence for any `preferred scale' in the power spectrum ornon-gaussian behaviour in the distribution of large-scale power.

astro-ph;9901366	a non parametric model for the cosmic velocity field	we present a self consistent nonparametric model of the local cosmic velocityfield based on the density distribution in the pscz redshift survey of irasgalaxies. the error analysis, carried out on mock pscz catalogues constructedfrom n-body simulations, reveals uncertainties of ~70 km/sec. the densersampling provided by the pscz survey compared to previous iras galaxy surveysallows us to reconstruct the velocity field out to larger distances. the moststriking feature of the model velocity field is a coherent large-scalestreaming motion along a baseline connecting perseus-pisces, the localsupercluster, the great attractor, and the shapley concentration. we find noevidence for back-infall onto the great attractor. instead, material behind andaround the great attractor in inferred to be streaming towards the shapleyconcentration the pscz model velocities compare well with those predicted fromthe 1.2jy redshift survey of iras galaxies and with those predicted from thedistribution of abell/aco clusters, out to 140 mpc/h. comparison of thereal-space density fields (or, alternatively, the peculiar velocity fields)inferred from the psc$z$ and cluster catalogues gives a relative (linear) biasparameter between clusters and iras galaxies of 4.4 +/- 0.6. finally, wecompare the cumulative bulk flows predicted from the pscz gravity field withthose measured from the mark iii and sfi catalogues of peculiar velocities. aconservative estimate of beta=omega**0.6/b, where b is the bias parameter foriras galaxies, gives beta =0.6 + 0.22 -0.15, in agreement with other recentdeterminations.

astro-ph;9903215	difference image analysis of galactic microlensing i. data analysis	this is a preliminary report on the application of difference image analysis(dia) to galactic bulge images. the aim of this analysis is to increase thesensitivity to the detection of gravitational microlensing. we discuss how thedia technique simplifies the process of discovering microlensing events bydetecting only objects which have variable flux. we illustrate how the diatechnique is not limited to detection of so called ``pixel lensing'' events,but can also be used to improve photometry for classical microlensing events byremoving the effects of blending. we will present a method whereby dia can beused to reveal the true unblended colours, positions and light curves ofmicrolensing events. we discuss the need for a technique to obtain the accuratemicrolensing time scales from blended sources, and present a possible solutionto this problem using the existing hst colour magnitude diagrams of thegalactic bulge and lmc. the use of such a solution with both classical andpixel microlensing searches is discussed. we show that one of the major causesof systematic noise in dia is differential refraction. a technique for removingthis systematic by effectively registering images to a common airmass ispresented. improvements to commonly used image differencing techniques arediscussed.

astro-ph;9905182	a comparison of the pscz and stromlo-apm redshift surveys	we present a direct comparison of the clustering properties of two redshiftsurveys covering a common volume of space: the recently completed iras pointsource catalogue redshift survey (pscz) containing 14500 galaxies with alimiting flux of 0.6 jy at 60 microns, and the optical stromlo-apm surveycontaining 1787 galaxies in a region of 4300 deg^2 in the southern galacticcap. we use three methods to compare the clustering properties: thecounts-in-cells comparison of efstathiou (1995), the two-point crosscorrelation function, and the tegmark (1998) `null-buster' test. we find thatthe stromlo variances are systematically higher than those of pscz, as expecteddue to the deficit of early-type galaxies in iras samples. however we find thatthe differences between the cell counts are consistent with a linear biasbetween the two surveys, with a relative bias parameter b_rel =b_stromlo/b_pscz \approx 1.3 which appears approximately scale-independent. thecorrelation coefficient r between optical and iras densities on scales \sim 20mpc/h is r &gt; 0.72 at 95% c.l., placing limits on types of `stochastic bias'which affect optical and iras galaxies differently.

astro-ph;9909227	calibration of the macho photometry database	the macho project is a microlensing survey that monitors the brightnesses of60 million stars in the large magellanic cloud (lmc), small magellanic cloud,and galactic bulge. our database presently contains about 80 billionphotometric measurements, a significant fraction of all astronomicalphotometry. we describe the calibration of macho two-color photometry andtransformation to the standard kron-cousins v and r system. calibrated machophotometry may be properly compared with all other observations on thekron-cousins standard system, enhancing the astrophysical value of these data.for 9 million stars in the lmc bar, independent photometric measurements of20,000 stars with v &lt; 18 mag in field-overlap regions demonstrate an internalprecision sigv = 0.021, sigr = 0.019, and sig(v-r) = 0.028 mag. the accuracy ofthe zero-point in this calibration is estimated to be +-0.035 mag for starswith colors in the range -0.1 &lt; (v-r) &lt; 1.2 mag. a comparison of calibratedmacho photometry with published photometric sequences and new hubble spacetelescope observations shows agreement. the current calibration zero-pointuncertainty for the remainder of the macho photometry database is estimated tobe +- 0.10 mag in v or r and +-0.04 mag in (v-r). we describe the firstapplication of calibrated macho photometry data: the construction of acolor-magnitude diagram used to calculate our experimental sensitivity todetect microlensing in the lmc.

astro-ph;9912223	the iras pscz dipole	we use the pscz iras galaxy redshift survey to analyze the cosmologicalgalaxy dipole out to a distance 300 h$^{-1}$ mpc. the masked area is filled inthree different ways, firstly by sampling the whole sky at random, secondly byusing neighbouring areas to fill a masked region, and thirdly using a sphericalharmonic analysis. the method of treatment of the mask is found to have asignificant effect on the final calculated dipole.  the conversion from redshift space to real space is accomplished by using ananalytical model of the cluster and void distribution, based on 88 nearbygroups, 854 clusters and 163 voids, with some of the clusters and all of thevoids found from the pscz database.  the dipole for the whole pscz sample appears to have converged within adistance of 200 $h^{-1}$mpc and yields a value for $\beta = \omega^{0.6}/b$ =0.75 (+0.11,-0.08), consistent with earlier determinations from iras samples bya variety of methods. for b = 1, the $2-\sigma$ range for $\omega_{o}$ is0.43-1.02.  the direction of the dipole is within 13$^o$ of the cmb dipole, the mainuncertainty in direction being associated with the masked area behind thegalactic plane. the improbability that further major contributions to thedipole amplitude will come from volumes larger than those surveyed here meansthat the question of the origin of the cmb dipole is essentially resolved.
