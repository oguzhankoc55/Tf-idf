0901.4038	the optical afterglows and host galaxies of three short/hard gamma-ray  bursts	short grbs are commonly thought to originate from the merging of doublecompact object binaries but direct evidence for this scenario is still missing.optical observations of short grbs allow us to measure redshifts, firmlyidentify host galaxies, characterize their properties, and accurately localizegrbs within them. multiwavelength observations of grb afterglows provide usefulinformation on the emission mechanisms at work. these are all key issues thatallow one to discriminate among different models of these elusive events. wecarried out photometric observations of the short/hard grb 051227, grb 061006,and grb 071227 with the eso-vlt starting from several hours after the explosiondown to the host galaxy level several days later. for grb 061006 and grb 071227we also obtained spectroscopic observations of the host galaxy. we compared theresults obtained from our optical observations with the available x-ray data ofthese bursts. for all the three above bursts, we discovered optical afterglowsand firmly identified their host galaxies. about half a day after the burst,the optical afterglows of grb 051227 and grb 061006 present a decaysignificatly steeper than in the x-rays. in the case of grb 051227, the opticaldecay is so steep that it likely indicates different emission mechanisms in thetwo wavelengths ranges. the three hosts are blue, star forming galaxies atmoderate redshifts and with metallicities comparable to the solar one. theprojected offsets of the optical afterglows from their host galaxies centersspan a wide range, but all afterglows lie within the light of their hosts andpresent evidence for local absorption in their x-ray spectra. we discuss ourfindings in light of the current models of short grb progenitors.

0903.4714	detailed radio to soft gamma-ray studies of the 2005 outburst of the new  x-ray transient xte j1818-245	xte j1818-245 is an x-ray nova that experienced an outburst in 2005, firstseen by the rxte satellite. the source was observed simultaneously at variouswavelengths up to soft gamma-rays with the integral satellite, from 2005february to september. x-ray novae are extreme systems that often harbor ablack hole, and are known to emit throughout the electromagnetic spectrum whenin outburst. we analyzed radio, (n)ir, optical, x-ray and soft gamma-rayobservations and constructed simultaneous broad-band x-ray spectra. analyzingboth the light curves in various energy ranges and the hardness-intensitydiagram enabled us to study the long-term behavior of the source. spectralparameters were typical of the soft intermediate states and the high softstates of a black hole candidate. the source showed relatively small spectralvariations in x-rays with considerable flux variation in radio. spectralstudies showed that the accretion disc cooled down from 0.64 to 0.27 kev in 100days and that the total flux decreased while the relative flux of the hotmedium increased. radio emission was detected several times, and,interestingly, five days after entering the hss. modeling the spectral energydistribution from the radio to the soft gamma-rays reveals that the radioflares arise from several ejection events. xte j1818-245 is likely a black holecandidate transient source that might be closer than the galactic bulge. theresults from the data analysis trace the physical changes that took place inthe system at a maximum bolometric luminosity of (0.4-0.9)e38 erg/s (assuming adistance between 2.8-4.3 kpc) and they are discussed within the context of discand jet models.

0906.3187	uves/vlt high resolution absorption spectroscopy of the grb080330  afterglow: a study of the grb host galaxy and intervening absorbers	we study the gamma ray burst (grb) environment and intervening absorbers byanalyzing the optical absorption features produced by gas surrounding the grbor along its line of sight. we analyzed high resolution spectroscopicobservations (r=40000, s/n=3 - 6) of the optical afterglow of grb080330, takenwith uves at the vlt ~ 1.5 hours after the grb trigger. the spectrumillustrates the complexity of the ism of the grb host galaxy at z = 1.51 whichhas at least four components in the main absorption system. we detect strongfeii, siii, and niii excited absorption lines associated with the bluemostcomponent only. in addition to the host galaxy, at least two more absorberslying along the line of sight to the afterglow have been detected in theredshift range 0.8 &lt; z &lt; 1.1, each exhibiting mgii absorption. for the bluemostcomponent in the host galaxy, we derive information about its distance from thesite of the grb explosion. we do so by assuming that the excited absorptionlines are produced by indirect uv pumping, and compare the data with a timedependent photo-excitation code. the distance of this component is found to be280+40-50 pc, which is lower than found for other grbs (1 - 6 kpc). we identifytwo additional mgii absorbers, one of them with a rest frame equivalent widthlarger than 1a. the distance between the grb and the absorber measured in thispaper confirms that the power of the grb radiation can influence the conditionsof the interstellar medium up to a distance of at least several hundred pc. forthe intervening absorbers, we confirm the trend that on average one strongintervening system is found per afterglow, as has been noted in studiesexhibiting an excess of strong mgii absorbers along grb sightlines compared toquasars.

0906.3191	non variability of intervening absorbers observed in the uves spectra of  the "naked-eye" grb080319	the aim of this paper is to investigate the properties of the interveningabsorbers lying along the line of sight of gamma-ray burst (grb) 080319bthrough the analysis of its optical absorption features. to this purpose, weanalyze a multi-epoch, high resolution spectroscopic observations (r=40000,corresponding to 7.5 km/s) of the optical afterglow of grb080319b (z=0.937),taken with uves at the vlt. thanks to the rapid response mode (rrm), weobserved the afterglow just 8m:30s after the grb onset when the magnitude was r~ 12. this allowed us to obtain the best signal-to-noise, high resolutionspectrum of a grb afterglow ever (s/n per resolution element ~ 50). two furtherrrm and target of opportunity observations were obtained starting 1.0 and 2.4hours after the event, respectively. four mgii absorption systems lying alongthe line of sight to the afterglow have been detected in the redshift range 0.5&lt; z &lt; 0.8, most of them showing a complex structure featuring severalcomponents. absorptions due to feii, mgi and mnii are also present; they appearin four, two and one intervening absorbers, respectively. one out of foursystems show a mgii2796 rest frame equivalent width larger than 1a. thisconfirms the excess of strong mgii absorbers compared to quasars, with dn/dz =0.9, ~ 4 times larger than the one observed along quasar lines of sight. inaddition, the analysis of multi-epoch, high-resolution spectra allowed us toexclude a significant variability in the column density of the singlecomponents of each absorber. combining this result with estimates of the sizeof the emitting region, we can reject the hypothesis that the differencebetween grb and qso mgii absorbers is due to a different size of the emittingregions.

0911.3901	grb 090313: x-shooter's first shot at a grb	context. x-shooter is the first second-generation instrument to becomeoperative at the eso very large telescope (vlt). it is a broad-bandmedium-resolution spectrograph designed with gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglowspectroscopy as one of its main science drivers.  aims. during the first commissioning night on sky with the instrument fullyassembled, x-shooter observed the afterglow of grb 090313 as a demonstration ofthe instrument's capabilities.  methods. grb 090313 was observed almost two days after the burst onset, whenthe object had already faded to r~21.6. furthermore, the 90% illuminated moonwas just 30 degrees away from the field. in spite of the adverse conditions, weobtained a spectrum that, for the first time in grb research, coverssimultaneously the range from 5700 to 23000 angstroms.  results. the spectrum shows multiple absorption features at a redshift of3.3736, the redshift of the grb. these features are composed of 3 componentswith different ionisation levels and velocities. some of the features havenever been observed before in a grb at such a high redshift. furthermore, wedetect two intervening systems at redshifts of 1.8005 and 1.9597.  conclusions. these results demonstrate the potential of x-shooter in the grbfield, as it was capable of observing a grb down to a magnitude limit thatwould include 72% of long grb afterglows 2 hours after the burst onset. coupledwith the rapid response mode available at vlt, allowing reaction times of justa few minutes, x-shooter constitutes an important leap forward on mediumresolution spectroscopic studies of grbs, their host galaxies and interveningsystems, probing the early history of the universe.

1002.4626	galaxy counterparts of metal-rich damped lyman-alpha absorbers - i: the  case of the z=2.35 dla towards q2222-0946	we have initiated a survey using the newly commissioned x-shooterspectrograph to target candidate relatively metal-rich damped lyman-alphaabsorbers (dlas). the spectral coverage of x-shooter allows us to search fornot only lyman-alpha emission, but also rest-frame optical emission lines. wehave chosen dlas where the strongest rest-frame optical lines ([oii], [oiii],hbeta and halpha) fall in the nir atmospheric transmission bands. in this firstpaper resulting from the survey, we report on the discovery of the galaxycounterpart of the z_abs = 2.354 dla towards the z=2.926 quasar q2222$-0946.this dla is amongst the most metal-rich z&gt;2 dlas studied so far at comparableredshifts and there is evidence for substantial depletion of refractoryelements onto dust grains. we measure metallicities from znii, siii, niii, mniiand feii of -0.46+/-0.07, -0.51+/-0.06, -0.85+/-0.06, -1.23+/-0.06, and-0.99+/-0.06, respectively. the galaxy is detected in the lyman-alpha, [oiii]lambda4959,5007 halpha emission lines at an impact parameter of about 0.8arcsec (6 kpc at z_abs = 2.354). we infer a star-formation rate of 10 m_sunyr^-1, which is a lower limit due to the possibility of slit-loss. compared tothe recently determined halpha luminosity function for z=2.2 galaxies thedla-galaxy counterpart has a luminosity of l~0.1l^*_halpha. the emission-lineratios are 4.0 (lyalpha/halpha) and 1.2 ([oiii]/halpha). the lyalpha line showsclear evidence for resonant scattering effects, namely an asymmetric,redshifted (relative to the systemic redshift) component and a much weakerblueshifted component. the fact that the blueshifted component is relativelyweak indicates the presence of a galactic wind. the properties of the galaxycounterpart of this dla is consistent with the prediction that metal-rich dlasare associated with the most luminous of the dla-galaxy counterparts.

1007.4769	challenging grb models through the broadband dataset of grb060908	context: multiwavelength observations of gamma-ray burst prompt and afterglowemission are a key tool to disentangle the various possible emission processesand scenarios proposed to interpret the complex gamma-ray burst phenomenology.aims: we collected a large dataset on grb060908 in order to carry out acomprehensive analysis of the prompt emission as well as the early and lateafterglow. methods: data from swift-bat, -xrt and -uvot together with data froma number of different ground-based optical/nir and millimeter telescopesallowed us to follow the afterglow evolution from about a minute from thehigh-energy event down to the host galaxy limit. we discuss the physicalparameters required to model these emissions. results: the prompt emission ofgrb060908 was characterized by two main periods of activity, spaced by a fewseconds of low intensity, with a tight correlation between activity andspectral hardness. observations of the afterglow began less than one minuteafter the high-energy event, when it was already in a decaying phase, and itwas characterized by a rather flat optical/nir spectrum which can beinterpreted as due to a hard energy-distribution of the emitting electrons. onthe other hand, the x-ray spectrum of the afterglow could be fit by a rathersoft electron distribution. conclusions: grb060908 is a good example of agamma-ray burst with a rich multi-wavelength set of observations. theavailability of this dataset, built thanks to the joint efforts of manydifferent teams, allowed us to carry out stringent tests for variousinterpretative scenarios showing that a satisfactorily modeling of this eventis challenging. in the future, similar efforts will enable us to obtainoptical/nir coverage comparable in quality and quantity to the x-ray data formore events, therefore opening new avenues to progress gamma-ray burstresearch.

1011.5312	galaxy counterparts of metal-rich damped lyman-alpha absorbers - ii. a  solar-metallicity and dusty dla at z_abs=2.58	[abridged]. here, we report on the discovery of the galaxy counterpart of thez_abs=2.58 dla on the line-of-sight to the z=3.07 quasar sdssj091826.16+163609.0. the galaxy counterpart of the dla is detected in the oiii5007 and oii 3726,3729 emission lines redshifted into the nir at an impactparameter of 16 kpc. ly-alpha emission is not detected. the upper limit impliesthat ly-alpha emission from this galaxy is suppressed by more than an order ofmagnitude. the dla is amongst the most metal-rich dlas studied so far atcomparable redshifts. we find evidence for substantial depletion of refractoryelements onto dust grains. fitting the main metal line component of the dla,which is located at z_abs=2.5832 and accounts for at least 85% of the totalcolumn density of low-ionisation species, we measure metal abundances fromznii, sii, siii, crii, mnii, feii and niii of -0.12, -0.26, -0.46, -0.88,-0.92, -1.03 and -0.78, respectively. in addition, we detect absorption in thelyman and werner bands of hydrogen, which represents the first detection of h_2molecules with x-shooter. the background quasar q0918+1636 is amongst thereddest qsos at redshifts 3.02&lt;z&lt;3.12 from the sdss catalogue. its uv to nirspectrum is well fitted by a composite qso spectrum reddened by smc/lmc-likeextinction curves at z_abs=2.58 with a significant amount of extinction givenby a_v = 0.2 mag. this supports previous claims that there may be moremetal-rich dlas missing from current samples due to dust reddening of thebackground qsos. the fact that there is evidence for dust both in the centralemitting regions of the galaxy (as evidenced by the lack of ly-alpha emission)and at an impact parameter of 16 kpc (as probed by the dla) suggests that dustis widespread in this system.

1302.2352	a new population of ultra-long duration gamma-ray bursts	we present comprehensive multiwavelength observations of three gamma-raybursts (grbs) with durations of several thousand seconds. we demonstrate thatthese events are extragalactic transients; in particular we resolve thelong-standing conundrum of the distance of grb 101225a (the "christmas-dayburst"), finding it to have a redshift z=0.847, and showing that two apparentlysimilar events (grb 111209a and grb 121027a) lie at z=0.677 and z=1.773respectively. the systems show extremely unusual x-ray and optical lightcurves,very different from classical grbs, with long lasting highly variable x-rayemission and optical light curves that exhibit little correlation with thebehaviour seen in the x-ray. their host galaxies are faint, compact, and highlystar forming dwarf galaxies, typical of "blue compact galaxies". we proposethat these bursts are the prototypes of a hitherto largely unrecognizedpopulation of ultra-long grbs, that while observationally difficult to detectmay be astrophysically relatively common. the long durations may naturally beexplained by the engine driven explosions of stars of much larger radii thannormally considered for grb progenitors which are thought to have compactwolf-rayet progenitor stars. however, we cannot unambiguously identifysupernova signatures within their light curves or spectra. we also consider thealternative possibility that they arise from the tidal disruption of stars bysupermassive black holes.

1308.2984	spectroscopy of the short-hard grb 130603b: the host galaxy and  environment of a compact object merger	short duration gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs) are thought to be related to theviolent merger of compact objects, such as neutron stars or black holes, whichmakes them promising sources of gravitational waves. the detection of a'kilonova'-like signature associated to the swift-detected grb 130603b hassuggested that this event is the result of a compact object merger. ourknowledge on sgrb has been, until now, mostly based on the absence of supernovasignatures and the analysis of the host galaxies to which they cannot always besecurely associated. further progress has been significantly hampered by thefaintness and rapid fading of their optical counterparts (afterglows), whichhas so far precluded spectroscopy of such events. afterglow spectroscopy is thekey tool to firmly determine the distance at which the burst was produced,crucial to understand its physics, and study its local environment. here wepresent the first spectra of a prototypical sgrb afterglow in which bothabsorption and emission features are clearly detected. together withmultiwavelength photometry we study the host and environment of grb 130603b.from these spectra we determine the redshift of the burst to be z =0.3565+/-0.0002, measure rich dynamics both in absorption and emission, and asubstantial line of sight extinction of a_v = 0.86+/-0.15 mag. the grb waslocated at the edge of a disrupted arm of a moderately star forming galaxy withnear-solar metallicity. unlike for most long grbs (lgrbs), n_hx / a_v isconsistent with the galactic ratio, indicating that the explosion site differsfrom those found in lgrbs. the merger is not associated with the moststar-forming region of the galaxy; however, it did occur in a dense region,implying a rapid merger or a low natal kick velocity for the compact objectbinary.

1401.3774	grb 120422a/sn 2012bz: bridging the gap between low- and high-luminosity  grbs	at low redshift, a handful of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been discoveredwith peak luminosities ($l_{\rm iso} &lt; 10^{48.5}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}$)substantially lower than the average of the more distant ones ($l_{\rm iso} &gt;10^{49.5}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}$). the properties of several low-luminosity(low-$l$) grbs indicate that they can be due to shock break-out, as opposed tothe emission from ultrarelativistic jets. owing to this, it is highly debatedhow both populations are connected, and whether there is a continuum betweenthem. the burst at redshift $z=0.283$ from 2012 april 22 is one of the very fewexamples of intermediate-$l$ grbs with a $\gamma$-ray luminosity of$l\sim10^{48.9}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}$ that have been detected up to now. togetherwith the robust detection of its accompanying supernova sn 2012bz, it has thepotential to answer important questions on the origin of low- and high-$l$ grbsand the grb-sn connection. we carried out a spectroscopy campaign using medium-and low-resolution spectrographs at 6--10-m class telescopes, covering the timespan of 37.3 days, and a multi-wavelength imaging campaign from radio to x-rayenergies over a duration of $\sim270$ days. furthermore, we used a tuneablefilter centred at h$\alpha$ to map star formation in the host galaxy and thesurrounding galaxies. we used these data to extract and model the properties ofdifferent radiation components and incorporate spectral-energy-distributionfitting techniques to extract the properties of the host galaxy. modelling thelight curve and spectral energy distribution from the radio to the x-raysrevealed the blast-wave to expand with an initial lorentz factor of$\gamma_0\sim60$, low for a high-$l$ grb, and that the afterglow had anexceptional low peak luminosity-density of$\lesssim2\times10^{30}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}\,\rm{hz}^{-1}$ in the sub-mm.[abridged]

1402.4026	vlt/x-shooter spectroscopy of the grb 120327a afterglow	we present a study of the environment of the swift long gamma-ray burst grb120327a at z ~2.8 through optical spectroscopy of its afterglow. we analyzedmedium-resolution, multi-epoch spectroscopic observations (~7000 - 12000,corresponding to ~ 15 - 23 km/s, s/n = 15- 30 and wavelength range3000-25000aa) of the optical afterglow of grb 120327a, taken with x-shooter atthe vlt 2.13 and 27.65 hr after the grb trigger. the first epoch spectrum showsthat the ism in the grb host galaxy at z = 2.8145 is extremely rich inabsorption features, with three components contributing to the line profiles.the hydrogen column density associated with grb 120327a has log nh / cm^(-2) =22.01 +/- 0.09, and the metallicity of the host galaxy is in the range [x/h] =-1.3 to -1.1. in addition to the ground state lines, we detect absorptionfeatures associated with excited states of cii, oi, siii, feii, and niii, whichwe used to derive information on the distance between the host absorbing gasand the site of the grb explosion. the variability of the fei\lambda2396excited line between the two epochs proves that these features are excited bythe grb uv flux. moreover, the distance of component i is found to bedi=200+100-60 pc, while component ii is located closer to the grb, atdii=100+40-30 pc. these values are among the lowest found in grbs. componentiii does not show excited transitions, so it should be located farther awayfrom the grb. the presence of h2 molecules is firmly established, with amolecular fraction in the range f=4 x 10^(-7) - 10^(-4). this particularly lowvalue can be attributed to the small dust content. this represents the thirdpositive detection of molecules in a grb environment.

1409.4804	vlt/x-shooter spectroscopy of the afterglow of the swift grb 130606a:  chemical abundances and reionisation at $z\sim6$	the reionisation of the universe is thought to have ended around z~6, asinferred from spectroscopy of distant bright background sources, such asquasars (qso) and gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglows. furthermore, spectroscopyof a grb afterglow provides insight in its host galaxy, which is often too dimand distant to study otherwise. we present the high s/n vlt/x-shooter spectrumof grb130606a at z=5.913. we aim to measure the degree of ionisation of the igmbetween 5.02&lt;z&lt;5.84 and to study the chemical abundance pattern and dustcontent of its host galaxy. we measured the flux decrement due to absorption atly$\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ wavelength regions. the hydrogen and metalabsorption lines formed in the host galaxy were fitted with voigt profiles toobtain column densities. our measurements of the ly$\alpha$-forest opticaldepth are consistent with previous measurements of qsos, but have a muchsmaller uncertainty. the analysis of the red damping wing yields a neutralfraction $x_{hi}&lt;0.05$ (3$\sigma$). we obtain column density measurements ofseveral elements. the ionisation corrections due to the grb is estimated to benegligible (&lt;0.03 dex), but larger corrections may apply due to thepre-existing radiation field (up to 0.4 dex based on sub-dla studies). ourmeasurements confirm that the universe is already predominantly ionised overthe redshift range probed in this work, but was slightly more neutral at z&gt;5.6.grbs are useful probes of the ionisation state of the igm in the earlyuniverse, but because of internal scatter we need a larger statistical sampleto draw robust conclusions. the high [si/fe] in the host can be due to dustdepletion, alpha-element enhancement, or a combination of both. the very highvalue of [al/fe]=2.40+/-0.78 might connected to the stellar population history.we estimate the host metallicity to be -1.7&lt;[m/h]&lt;-0.9 (2%-13% of solar).(trunc.)

1503.03623	spectrophotometric analysis of grb afterglow extinction curves with  x-shooter	in this work we use gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglow spectra observed with thevlt/x-shooter spectrograph to measure rest-frame extinction in grblines-of-sight by modeling the broadband near-infrared (nir) to x-ray afterglowspectral energy distributions (seds). our sample consists of nine swift grbs,eight of them belonging to the long-duration and one to the short-durationclass. dust is modeled using the average extinction curves of the milky way andthe two magellanic clouds. we derive the rest-frame extinction of the entiresample, which fall in the range $0 \lesssim {\it a}_{\rm v} \lesssim 1.2$.moreover, the smc extinction curve is the preferred extinction curve templatefor the majority of our sample, a result which is in agreement with thosecommonly observed in grb lines-of-sights. in one analysed case (grb 120119a),the common extinction curve templates fail to reproduce the observedextinction. to illustrate the advantage of using the high-quality x-shooterafterglow seds over the photometric seds, we repeat the modeling using thebroadband seds with the nir-to-uv photometric measurements instead of thespectra. the main result is that the spectroscopic data, thanks to acombination of excellent resolution and coverage of the blue part of the sed,are more successful in constraining the extinction curves and therefore thedust properties in grb hosts with respect to photometric measurements. in allcases but one the extinction curve of one template is preferred over theothers. we show that the modeled values of the extinction and the spectralslope, obtained through spectroscopic and photometric sed analysis, can differsignificantly for individual events. finally we stress that, regardless of theresolution of the optical-to-nir data, the sed modeling gives reliable resultsonly when the fit is performed on a sed covering a broader spectral region.

astro-ph;0411410	the eclairs micro-satellite for multi-wavelength studies of gamma-ray  burst prompt emission	the cosmological revolution of 1997 has established that (at least longduration) gamma-ray bursts (grb) are among the most energetic events in theuniverse and occur at cosmological distances. the eclairs micro-satellite, tobe launched in 2009, will provide multi-wavelength observations forastrophysical studies of grb and for their possible use as cosmological probes.it is expected to be the only space borne grb trigger available for groundbased robotic telescopes operational at that time. this paper presents theeclairs project and its status. an x/gamma-ray camera onboard eclairs with awide field of view of 2 sr, will detect ~100 grb/yr in the 4-50 kev energyrange, localize the grb with a precision of ~10 arcmin on the sky, and transmitthis information to the ground in near real-time, as a grb trigger for groundbased optical telescopes. inspired by the integral imager ibis, it is based ona cdte detection plane covering 1000 cm^2, placed 35 cm below a coded mask. anoptical camera, sensitive to magnitude-15 stars, covering up to 1/4th of thex/gamma-ray camera's field of view, will observe the prompt emission and apossible precursor of ~10 grb/yr in the visible-band. used in a continuousacquisition mode at a rate of ~5 images/s dumped into an on-board memory, a grbevent sent by the x/gamma-ray camera triggers a seek-back in memory for the grboptical precursor. the full x/gamma-ray and visible-band data of a grb are sentto ground when a high data-rate telemetry ground receiver is reachable.

astro-ph;0609708	integral serendipitous detection of the gamma-ray microquasar ls 5039	ls 5039 is the only x-ray binary persistently detected at tev energies by thecherenkov hess telescope. it is moreover a gamma-ray emitter in the gev andpossibly mev energy ranges. to understand important aspects of jet physics,like the magnetic field content or particle acceleration, and emissionprocesses, such as synchrotron and inverse compton (ic), a complete modeling ofthe multiwavelength data is necessary. ls 5039 has been detected along almostall the electromagnetic spectrum thanks to several radio, infrared, optical andsoft x-ray detections. however, hard x-ray detections above 20 kev have been sofar elusive and/or doubtful, partly due to source confusion for the poorspatial resolution of hard x-ray instruments. we report here on deep (300 ksec)serendipitous integral hard x-ray observations of ls 5039, coupled withsimultaneous vla radio observations. we obtain a 20-40 kev flux of 1.1 +/- 0.3mcrab (5.9 (+/-1.6) x 10^{-12} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}), a 40-100 kev upper limit of1.5 mcrab (9.5 x 10^{-12} erg cm^{-2}s^{-1}), and typical radio flux densitiesof about 25 mjy at 5ghz. these hard x-ray fluxes are significantly lower thanprevious estimates obtained with batse in the same energy range but, in thelower interval, agree with extrapolation of previous rxte measurements. theintegral observations also hint to a break in the spectral behavior at hardx-rays. a more sensitive characterization of the hard x-ray spectrum of ls 5039from 20 to 100 kev could therefore constrain key aspects of the jet physics,like the relativistic particle spectrum and the magnetic field strength. futuremultiwavelength observations would allow to establish whether such hard x-raysynchrotron emission is produced by the same population of relativisticelectrons as those presumably producing tev emission through ic.

astro-ph;9709096	the ibis view of the galactic centre: integral's imager observations  simulations	the imager on board integral satellite (ibis) is the imaging instrument ofthe integral satellite, the hard-x/soft-gamma ray esa mission to be launched in2001. it provides diagnostic capabilities of fine imaging (12' fwhm), sourceidentification and spectral sensitivity to both continuum and broad lines overa broad (15 kev--10 mev) energy range. it has a continuum sensitivity of2~10^{-7} ph cm^{-2} s^{-1} at 1 mev for a 10^6 seconds observation and aspectral resolution better than 7 % at 100 kev and of 6 % at 1 mev. the imagingcapabilities of the ibis are characterized by the coupling of the above quotedsource discrimination capability with a very wide field of view (fov), namely 9x 9 degrees fully coded, 29 x 29 degrees partially coded fov. we presentsimulations of ibis observations of the galactic center based on the results ofthe sigma galactic center survey. they show the capabilities of this instrumentin discriminating between different sources while at the same time monitoring ahuge fov. it will be possible to simultaneously take spectra of all of thesesources over the fov even if the sensitivity decreases out of the fully codedarea. it is envisaged that a proper exploitation of both the fov dimension andthe source localization capability of the ibis will be a key factor inmaximizing its scientific output.

astro-ph;9808211	sigma and xte observations of the soft x-ray transient xtej1755-324	we present observations of the x-ray transient xtej1755-324 performed duringsummer 1997 with the xte satellite and with the sigma hard x-ray telescopeonboard the granat observatory. the source was first detected in soft x-rayswith xte on july 25 1997 with a rather soft x-ray spectrum and its outburst wasmonitored in soft x-rays up to november 1997. on september 16 it was firstdetected in hard x-rays by the french soft gamma ray telescope sigma during agalactic center observation. the flux was stronger on september 16 and 17reaching a level of about 110 mcrab in the 40-80 kev energy band. on the samedays the photon index of the spectrum was determined to be alpha =-2.3 +/- 0.9(1 sigma error) while the 40-150 kev luminosity was about 8 x 10^{36} erg/s fora distance of 8.5 kpc. sigma and xte results on this source indicate that thissource had an ultrasoft-like state during its main outburst and a hardersecondary outburst in september. these characteristics make the source similarto x-nova muscae 1991, a well known black hole candidate.

astro-ph;9901392	deep sigma observations of the central square degree of the galaxy	the center of the milky way emits radiation through all the electromagneticspectrum due to the presence of several astrophysical phenomena. variousscientifical questions remain unsolved in the picture that emerge fromobservations, the main one being the presence and activity of a supermassiveblack hole at the galactic center. also in the x-ray band a strong diffuseemission is detected up to 22 kev, it has been suggested that its origin islinked to past high energy activity of the galactic center. the french sigmasoft gamma ray telescope on board the russian granat satellite observed thegalacti center (gc) for abour 9 x 10^6 seconds from 1990 to the end of 1997.its unique imaging capabilities coupled with the unprecedented exposure alreadyallowed us to set preliminary constraints on the persistent high energyemission from sgr a*. here we present a new analysis of the complete set ofobservations of this region taking into account the possible presence ofdiffuse emission in the low energy channels. this allows us both to testcurrent advection models of high energy emission from sgr a* and to investigateon past high energy activity.

astro-ph;9903212	long-term variability of the hard x-ray source grs 1758-258:  granat/sigma observations	the results of granat/sigma hard x-ray observations of grs 1758-258 in1990-1998 are presented. the source lies at ~5\arcdeg from the galactic centerand was within the sigma field of view during the granat surveys of thisregion. the total exposure time of the galactic center was 11x10^6 s. theregular sigma observations revealed strong variability of the source: the40-150 kev flux varied at least by a factor of 8 on a time scale of a year,between less than 13 mcrab and ~100-110 mcrab. the average flux was ~60 mcrabin 1990-1998. the source's spectrum is well fitted by a power law with a photonindex \alpha ~1.86 in the energy range 40 to 150 kev and becomes steeper atenergies above ~100 kev. the radio and hard x-ray properties of grs 1758-258are similar to those of another galactic center source, 1e1740.7-2942. grs1758-258 and 1e1740.7-2942 are the two brightest hard x-ray sources in thegalactic center region. both sources have radio jets, similar x-rayluminosities (~10^37 erg/s), and spectra, and exhibit variations in the hardx-ray flux on long times scales by a factor of ~10 or more . in contrast tomost of the known black hole candidates, which are x-ray transients, grs1758-258 and 1e1740.7-2942 were detected by sigma during most of theobservations in 1990-1998. assuming that this behavior of the sources impliesthe suppression of accretion-disk instability in the region of partial hydrogenionization through x-ray heating, we impose constraints on the mass of theoptical companion and on the orbital period of the binary system.

0811.0989	probing the complex environments of grb host galaxies and intervening  systems: high resolution spectroscopy of grb050922c	the aim of this paper is to investigate the environment of gamma ray bursts(grbs) and the interstellar matter of their host galaxies. we use to thispurpose high resolution spectroscopic observations of the afterglow ofgrb050922c, obtained with uves/vlt 3.5 hours after the grb event. we foundthat, as for most high resolution spectra of grbs, the spectrum of theafterglow of grb050922c is complex. at least seven components contribute to themain absorption system at z=2.1992. the detection of lines of neutral elementslike mgi and the detection of fine-structure levels of the ions feii, siii andcii allows us to separate components in the grb ism along the line of sight.moreover, in addition to the main system, we have analyzed the five interveningsystems between z = 2.077 and z = 1.5664 identified along the grb line ofsight. grb afterglow spectra are very complex, but full of information. thiscan be used to disentangle the contribution of the different parts of the grbhost galaxy and to study their properties. our metallicity estimates agree withthe scenario of grbs exploding in low metallicity galaxies

0706.1273	multicolor observations of the afterglow of the short/hard grb 050724	new information on short/hard gamma-ray bursts (grbs) is being gatheredthanks to the discovery of their optical and x-ray afterglows. however, somekey aspects are still poorly understood, including the collimation level of theoutflow, the duration of the central engine activity, and the properties of theprogenitor systems. we want to constrain the physical properties of the shortgrb 050724 and of its host galaxy, and make some inferences on the global shortgrb population. we present optical observations of the afterglow of grb 050724and of its host galaxy, significantly expanding the existing dataset for thisevent. we compare our results with models, complementing them with availablemeasurements from the literature. we study the afterglow light curve andspectrum including x-ray data. we also present observations of the host galaxy.the observed optical emission was likely related to the large flare observed inthe x-ray light curve. the apparent steep decay was therefore not due to thejet effect. available data are indeed consistent with low collimation, in turnimplying a large energy release, comparable to that of long grbs. the flareproperties also constrain the internal shock mechanism, requiring a largelorentz factor contrast between the colliding shells. this implies that thecentral engine was active at late times, rather than ejecting all shellssimultaneously. the host galaxy has red colors and no ongoing star formation,consistent with previous findings on this grb. however, it is not a pureelliptical, and has some faint spiral structure. grb 050724 provides the mostcompelling case for association between a short burst and a galaxy with oldstellar population. it thus plays a pivotal role in constraining progenitorsmodels, which should allow for long delays between birth and explosion.
