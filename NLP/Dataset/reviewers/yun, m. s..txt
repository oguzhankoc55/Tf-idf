0902.3671	imaging the cool gas, dust, star formation, and agn in the first  galaxies	when, and how, did the first galaxies and supermassive black holes (smbh)form, and how did they reionization the universe? first galaxy formation andcosmic reionization are among the last frontiers in studies of cosmic structureformation. we delineate the detailed astrophysical probes of early galaxy andsmbh formation afforded by observations at centimeter through submillimeterwavelengths. these observations include studies of the molecular gas (= thefuel for star formation in galaxies), atomic fine structure lines (= thedominant ism gas coolant), thermal dust continuum emission (= an ideal starformation rate estimator), and radio continuum emission from star formation andrelativistic jets. high resolution spectroscopic imaging can be used to studygalaxy dynamics and star formation on sub-kpc scales. these cm and mmobservations are the necessary compliment to near-ir observations, which probethe stars and ionized gas, and x-ray observations, which reveal the agn.together, a suite of revolutionary observatories planned for the next decadefrom centimeter to x-ray wavelengths will provide the requisite panchromaticview of the complex processes involved in the formation of the first generationof galaxies and smbhs, and cosmic reionization.

0906.4561	an aztec 1.1 mm survey of the goods-n field -- ii. multi-wavelength  identifications and redshift distribution	we present results from a multi-wavelength study of 29 sources (falsedetection probabilities &lt;5%) from a survey of the great observatories originsdeep survey-north field at 1.1mm using the aztec camera. comparing withexisting 850um scuba studies in the field, we examine differences in the sourcepopulations selected at the two wavelengths. the aztec observations uniformlycover the entire survey field to a 1-sigma depth of ~1mjy. searching deep1.4ghz vla, and spitzer 3--24um catalogues, we identify robust counterparts for21 1.1mm sources, and tentative associations for the remaining objects. theredshift distribution of aztec sources is inferred from available spectroscopicand photometric redshifts. we find a median redshift of z=2.7, somewhat higherthan z=2.0 for 850um-selected sources in the same field, and our lowestredshift identification lies at a spectroscopic redshift z=1.1460. we measurethe 850um to 1.1mm colour of our sources and do not find evidence for `850umdropouts', which can be explained by the low-snr of the observations. we alsocombine these observed colours with spectroscopic redshifts to derive the rangeof dust temperatures t, and dust emissivity indices $\beta$ for the sample,concluding that existing estimates t~30k and $\beta$~1.75 are consistent withthese new data.

0907.1093	aztec half square degree survey of the shades fields -- i. maps,  catalogues, and source counts	we present the first results from the largest deep extragalacticmillimetre-wavelength survey undertaken to date. these results are derived frommaps covering over 0.7 deg^2, made at 1.1mm, using the aztec continuum cameramounted on the james clerk maxwell telescope. the maps were made in the twofields originally targeted at 0.85mm with scuba in the shades project, namelythe lockman hole east (mapped to a depth of 0.9-1.3 mjy rms) and the subaru xmmdeep field (1.0-1.7 mjy rms). the wealth of existing and forthcoming deepmulti-frequency data in these two fields will allow the bright mm sourcepopulation revealed by these images to be explored in detail in subsequentpapers. here we present the maps themselves, a catalogue of 114high-significance sub-millimetre galaxy detections, and a thorough statisticalanalysis leading to the most robust determination to date of the 1.1mm sourcenumber counts. through careful comparison, we find that both the cosmos andgoods north fields, also imaged with aztec, contain an excess of mm sourcesover the new 1.1mm source-count baseline established here. in particular, ournew aztec/shades results indicate that very luminous high-redshift dustenshrouded starbursts (s_{1.1} &gt; 3 mjy) are 25-50% less common than would havebeen inferred from these smaller surveys, thus highlighting the potential rolesof cosmic variance and clustering in such measurements. we compare number countpredictions from recent models of the evolving mm/sub-mm source population tothese smg surveys, which provide important constraints for the ongoingrefinement of semi-analytic and hydrodynamical models of galaxy formation, andfind that all recent models over-predict the number of bright sub-millimetregalaxies found in this survey.

0909.3299	the aztec/sma interferometric imaging survey of submillimeter-selected  high-redshift galaxies	we present results from a continuing interferometric survey of high-redshiftsubmillimeter galaxies with the submillimeter array, including high-resolution(beam size ~2 arcsec) imaging of eight additional aztec 1.1mm selected sourcesin the cosmos field, for which we obtain six reliable (peak s/n&gt;5 or peak s/n&gt;4with multiwavelength counterparts within the beam) and two moderatesignificance (peak s/n&gt;4) detections. when combined with previous detections,this yields an unbiased sample of millimeter-selected smgs with completeinterferometric followup. with this sample in hand, we (1) empirically confirmthe radio-submillimeter association, (2) examine the submillimeter morphology -including the nature of submillimeter galaxies with multiple radio counterpartsand constraints on the physical scale of the far infrared - of the sample, and(3) find additional evidence for a population of extremely luminous, radio-dimsubmillimeter galaxies that peaks at higher redshift than previous,radio-selected samples. in particular, the presence of such a population ofhigh-redshift sources has important consequences for models of galaxy formation- which struggle to account for such objects even under liberal assumptions -and dust production models given the limited time since the big bang.

0910.1595	an aztec 1.1-mm survey for ulirgs in the field of the galaxy cluster ms  0451.6-0305	we have undertaken a deep (sigma~1.1 mjy) 1.1-mm survey of the z=0.54 clusterms 0451.6-0305 using the aztec camera on the james clerk maxwell telescope. wedetect 36 sources with s/n&gt;3.5 in the central 0.10 deg^2 and present the aztecmap, catalogue and number counts. we identify counterparts to 18 sources (50%)using radio, mid-infrared, spitzer irac and submillimeter array data. optical,near- and mid-infrared spectral energy distributions are compiled for the 14 ofthese galaxies with detectable counterparts, which are expected to contain alllikely cluster members. we then use photometric redshifts and colour selectionto separate background galaxies from potential cluster members and test thereliability of this technique using archival observations of submillimetregalaxies. we find two potential ms 0451-03 members, which, if they are bothcluster galaxies have a total star-formation rate (sfr) of ~100 solar massesper year -- a significant fraction of the combined sfr of all the othergalaxies in ms 0451-03. we also examine the stacked rest-frame mid-infrared,millimetre and radio emission of cluster members below our aztec detectionlimit and find that the sfrs of mid-ir selected galaxies in the cluster andredshift-matched field populations are comparable. in contrast, the average sfrof the morphologically classified late-type cluster population is ~3 times lessthan the corresponding redshift-matched field galaxies. this suggests thatthese galaxies may be in the process of being transformed on the red-sequenceby the cluster environment. our survey demonstrates that although theenvironment of ms 0451-03 appears to suppress star-formation in late-typegalaxies, it can support active, dust-obscured mid-ir galaxies and potentiallymillimetre-detected lirgs.

(1995) which utilized position-switching observations along the majoraxis and a model fitting method. we find that our otf derived co propertiesagree well with the young et al. results in many cases, but the young et al.measurements are larger by a factor of 1.4 - 2.4 for seven (out of 18) cases.we will explore further the possible causes for the discrepancy in the analysispaper currently under preparation.

0912.0282	powerful h$_2$ line-cooling in stephan's quintet : i - mapping the  significant cooling pathways in group-wide shocks	we present results from the mid-infrared spectral mapping of stephan'squintet using the spitzer space telescope. a 1000 km/s collision has produced agroup-wide shock and for the first time the large-scale distribution of warmmolecular hydrogen emission is revealed, as well as its close association withknown shock structures. in the main shock region alone we find 5.0$\times10^{8}$ m$_{\odot}$ of warm h$_2$ spread over $\sim$ 480 kpc$^2$ andadditionally report the discovery of a second major shock-excited h$_2$feature. this brings the total h$_2$ line luminosity of the group in excess of10$^42$ erg/s. in the main shock, the h$_2$ line luminosity exceeds, by afactor of three, the x-ray luminosity from the hot shocked gas, confirming thatthe h$_2$-cooling pathway dominates over the x-ray. [si ii]34.82$\mu$memission, detected at a luminosity of 1/10th of that of the h$_2$, appears totrace the group-wide shock closely and in addition, we detect weak[feii]25.99$\mu$m emission from the most x-ray luminous part of the shock.comparison with shock models reveals that this emission is consistent withregions of fast shocks (100 &lt; $v_{s}$ &lt; 300 km/s) experiencing depletion ofiron and silicon onto dust grains. star formation in the shock (as traced viaionic lines, pah and dust emission) appears in the intruder galaxy, but moststrikingly at either end of the radio shock. the shock ridge itself showslittle star formation, consistent with a model in which the tremendous h$_{2}$power is driven by turbulent energy transfer from motions in a post-shockedlayer. the significance of the molecular hydrogen lines over other measuredsources of cooling in fast galaxy-scale shocks may have crucial implicationsfor the cooling of gas in the assembly of the first galaxies.

1001.3690	unveiling the nature of submillimeter galaxy sxdf850.6	we present an 880 micron submillimeter array (sma) detection of thesubmillimeter galaxy sxdf850.6. sxdf850.6 is a bright source (s(850 micron) = 8mjy) detected in the scuba half degree extragalactic survey (shades), and hasmultiple possible radio counterparts in its deep radio image obtained at thevla. our new sma detection finds that the submm emission coincides with thebrightest radio emission that is found ~8" north of the coordinates determinedfrom scuba. despite the lack of detectable counterparts in deep uv/opticalimages, we find a source at the sma position in near-infrared and longerwavelength images. we perform sed model fits to uv-optical-ir photometry (u, b,v, r, i', z', j, h, k, 3.6 micron, 4.5 micron, 5.8 micron, and 8.0 micron) andto submm-radio photometry (850 micron, 880 micron, 1100 micron, and 21 cm)independently, and we find both are well described by starburst templates at aredshift of z ~= 2.2 (+/- 0.3). the best-fit parameters from the uv-optical-irsed fit are a redshift of z = 1.87 (+0.15/-0.07), a stellar mass of m_star =2.5 +2.2/-0.3 x 10^11 m_sun, an extinction of a_v = 3.0 (+0.3/-1.0) mag, and anage of 720 (+1880/-210) myr. the submm-radio sed fit provides a consistentredshift of z ~ 1.8-2.5, an ir luminosity of l_ir = (7-26) x 10^12 l_sun, and astar formation rate of 1300-4500 m_sun/yr. these results suggest that sxdf850.6is a mature system already having a massive amount of old stellar populationconstructed before its submm bright phase and is experiencing a dustystarburst, possibly induced by major mergers.

1003.0447	mid-infrared spectroscopy of candidate agn-dominated submillimeter  galaxies	spitzer spectroscopy has revealed that ~80% of submm galaxies (smgs) arestarburst (sb) dominated in the mid-infrared. here we focus on the remaining~20% that show signs of harboring powerful active galactic nuclei (agn). wehave obtained spitzer-irs spectroscopy of a sample of eight smgs which arecandidates for harboring powerful agn on the basis of irac color-selection(s8/s4.5&gt;2; i.e. likely power-law mid-infrared seds). smgs with an agndominating (&gt;50%) their mid-infrared emission could represent `missing link'sources in an evolutionary sequence involving a major merger. first of all, wedetect pah features in all of the smgs, indicating redshifts from 2.5-3.4,demonstrating the power of the mid-infrared to determine redshifts for theseoptically faint dusty galaxies. secondly, we see signs of both star-formation(from the pah features) and agn activity (from continuum emission) in oursample: 62% of the sample are agn-dominated in the mid-infrared with a medianagn content of 56%, compared with &lt;30% on average for typical smgs, revealingthat our irac color selection has successfully singled out sources withproportionately more agn emission than typical sb-dominated smgs. however, wefind that only about 10% of these agn dominate the bolometric emission of thesmg when the results are extrapolated to longer infrared wavelengths, implyingthat agn are not a significant power source to the smg population overall, evenwhen there is evidence in the mid-infrared for substantial agn activity. whenexisting samples of mid-infrared agn-dominated smgs are considered, we findthat s8/s4.5&gt;1.65 works well at selecting mid-infrared energetically dominantagn in smgs, implying a duty cycle of ~15% if all smgs go through a subsequentmid-infrared agn-dominated phase in the proposed evolutionary sequence.

1003.4264	the physical scale of the far-infrared emission in the most luminous  submillimetre galaxies ii: evidence for merger-driven star formation	we present high-resolution 345 ghz interferometric observations of twoextreme luminous (l_{ir}&gt;10^{13} l_sun), submillimetre-selected galaxies (smgs)in the cosmos field with the submillimeter array (sma). both targets werepreviously detected as unresolved point-sources by the sma in its compactconfiguration, also at 345 ghz. these new data, which provide a factor of ~3improvement in resolution, allow us to measure the physical scale of thefar-infrared in the submillimetre directly. the visibility functions of bothtargets show significant evidence for structure on 0.5-1 arcsec scales, whichat z=1.5 translates into a physical scale of 5-8 kpc. our results areconsistent with the angular and physical scales of two comparably luminousobjects with high-resolution sma followup, as well as radio continuum and cosizes. these relatively compact sizes (&lt;5-10 kpc) argue strongly formerger-driven starbursts, rather than extended gas-rich disks, as the preferredchannel for forming smgs. for the most luminous objects, the derived sizes mayalso have important physical consequences; under a series of simplifyingassumptions, we find that these two objects in particular are forming starsclose to or at the eddington limit for a starburst.

1009.1455	detection of an ultra-bright submillimeter galaxy in the  subaru/xmm-newton deep field using aztec/aste	we report the detection of an extremely bright ($\sim$37 mjy at 1100 $\mu$mand $\sim$91 mjy at 880 $\mu$m) submillimeter galaxy (smg),aztec-aste-sxdf1100.001 (hereafter referred to as sxdf1100.001 or orochi),discovered in 1100 $\mu$m observations of the subaru/xmm-newton deep fieldusing aztec on aste. subsequent carma 1300 $\mu$m and sma 880 $\mu$mobservations successfully pinpoint the location of orochi and suggest that ithas two components, one extended (fwhm of $\sim$ 4$^{\prime\prime}$) and onecompact (unresolved). z-spec on cso has also been used to obtain a wide bandspectrum from 190 to 308 ghz, although no significant emission/absorption linesare found. the derived upper limit to the line-to-continuum flux ratio is0.1--0.3 (2 $\sigma$) across the z-spec band.  based on the analysis of the derived spectral energy distribution fromoptical to radio wavelengths of possible counterparts near the sma/carma peakposition, we suggest that orochi is a lensed, optically dark smg lying at $z\sim 3.4$ behind a foreground, optically visible (but red) galaxy at $z \sim1.4$. the deduced apparent (i.e., no correction for magnification) infraredluminosity ($l_{\rm ir}$) and star formation rate (sfr) are $6 \times 10^{13}$$l_{\odot}$ and 11000 $m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively, assuming that the$l_{\rm ir}$ is dominated by star formation. these values suggest that orochiwill consume its gas reservoir within a short time scale ($3 \times 10^{7}$yr), which is indeed comparable to those in extreme starbursts like the centresof local ulirgs.

1010.0585	aztec/aste 1.1-mm survey of the akari deep field south: source catalogue  and number counts	we present results of a 1.1 mm deep survey of the akari deep field south(adf-s) with aztec mounted on the atacama submillimetre telescope experiment(aste). we obtained a map of 0.25 sq. deg area with an rms noise level of0.32-0.71 mjy. this is one of the deepest and widest maps thus far atmillimetre and submillimetre wavelengths. we uncovered 198 sources with asignificance of 3.5-15.6 sigma, providing the largest catalog of 1.1 mm sourcesin a contiguous region. most of the sources are not detected in thefar-infrared bands of the akari satellite, suggesting that they are mostly at z~ 1.5 given the detection limits. we constructed differential and cumulativenumber counts in the adf-s, the subaru/xmm newton deep field (sxdf), and thessa 22 field surveyed by aztec/aste, which provide currently the tightestconstraints on the faint end. the integration of the best-fit number counts inthe adf-s find that the contribution of 1.1 mm sources with fluxes &gt;=1 mjy tothe cosmic infrared background (cib) at 1.1 mm is 12-16%, suggesting that thelarge fraction of the cib originates from faint sources of which the numbercounts are not yet constrained. we estimate the cosmic star-formation ratedensity contributed by 1.1 mm sources with &gt;=1 mjy using the best-fit numbercounts in the adf-s and find that it is lower by about a factor of 5-10compared to those derived from uv/optically-selected galaxies at z ~ 2-3. thefraction of stellar mass of the present-day universe produced by 1.1 mm sourceswith &gt;=1 mjy at z &gt;= 1 is ~20%, calculated by the time integration of thestar-formation rate density. if we consider the recycled fraction of &gt;0.4,which is the fraction of materials forming stars returned to the interstellarmedium, the fraction of stellar mass produced by 1.1 mm sources decrease to&lt;~10%.

1105.0890	aztec millimeter survey of the cosmos field - iii. source catalog over  0.72 sq. deg. and plausible boosting by large-scale structure	we present a 0.72 sq. deg. contiguous 1.1mm survey in the central area of thecosmos field carried out to a 1sigma ~ 1.26 mjy/beam depth with the azteccamera mounted on the 10m atacama submillimeter telescope experiment (aste). wehave uncovered 189 candidate sources at a signal-to-noise ratio s/n &gt;= 3.5, outof which 129, with s/n &gt;= 4, can be considered to have little chance of beingspurious (&lt; 2 per cent). we present the number counts derived with this survey,which show a significant excess of sources when compared to the number countsderived from the ~0.5 sq. deg. area sampled at similar depths in the scuba halfdegree extragalactic survey (shades, austermann et al. 2010). they are,however, consistent with those derived from fields that were considered toosmall to characterize the overall blank-field population. we identifydifferences to be more significant in the s &gt; 5 mjy regime, and demonstratethat these excesses in number counts are related to the areas where galaxies atredshifts z &lt; 1.1 are more densely clustered. the positions of optical-irgalaxies in the redshift interval 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 0.75 are the ones that show thestrongest correlation with the positions of the 1.1mm bright population (s &gt; 5mjy), a result which does not depend exclusively on the presence of richclusters within the survey sampled area. the most likely explanation for theobserved excess in number counts at 1.1mm is galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-grouplensing at moderate amplification levels, that increases in amplitude as onesamples larger and larger flux densities. this effect should also be detectablein other high redshift populations.

1105.2537	goods-herschel: an infrared main sequence for star-forming galaxies	we present the deepest far-ir observations obtained with herschel and examinethe 3-500um seds of galaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;2.5, supplemented by a local referencesample from iras, iso, spitzer and akari data. we find that the ratio of totalir luminosity to rest-frame 8um luminosity, ir8 (=lir/l8), follows a gaussiandistribution centered on ir8=4 and defines an ir main sequence (ms). a minoritypopulation (&lt;20 %) of outliers producing a tail skewed toward higher values ofir8 consist of starbursts (sb) with compact projected star formation densities.ir8 can be used to separate galaxies with normal and extended modes of starformation from compact sbs with high-ir8, high projected ir surface brightness(&gt;3x10^10 lsun kpc^-2) and a high specific sfr (i.e., sbs). the rest-frame,uv-2700a size of these distant sbs is typically half that of ms galaxies,supporting the correlation between star formation density and sb activity thatis measured for the local sample. locally, (u)lirgs are systematically in thesb mode, whereas most distant (u)lirgs form stars in the "normal" ms mode. thisconfusion between two modes of star formation is the cause of the so-called"mid-ir excess" population of galaxies found at z&gt;1.5 by previous studies. msgalaxies have strong pah emission line features, a broad far-ir bump resultingfrom a combination of dust temperatures (tdust~15-50 k), and an effectivetdust~31 k, as derived from the peak wavelength of their ir sed. galaxies inthe sb regime instead exhibit weak pah ew and a sharper far-ir bump with aneffective tdust~40 k. finally, we present evidence that the mid-to-far iremission of x-ray agns is predominantly produced by star formation and thatcandidate dusty agns with a power-law emission in the mid-ir systematicallyoccur in compact, dusty sbs. after correcting for the effect of sbs on ir8, weidentify new candidates for extremely obscured agns.

0709.4511	seyfert's sextet: a slowly dissolving stephan's quintet?	we present a multiwavelength study of the highly evolved compact galaxy groupknown as seyfert's sextet (hcg79: ss). we interpret ss as a 2-3 gyr moreevolved analog of stephan's quintet (hcg92: sq). we postulate that ss formed bysequential acquisition of 4-5 primarily late-type field galaxies. four of thefive galaxies show an early-type morphology which is likely the result ofsecular evolution driven by gas stripping. stellar stripping has produced amassive/luminous halo and embedded galaxies that are overluminous for theirsize. these are interpreted as remnant bulges of the accreted spirals. h79dcould be interpreted as the most recent intruder being the only galaxy with anintact ism and uncertain evidence for tidal perturbation. in addition tostripping activity we find evidence for past accretion events. h79b (ngc6027)shows a strong counter-rotating emission line component interpreted as anaccreted dwarf spiral. h79a shows evidence for an infalling component of gasrepresenting feedback or possible cross fueling by h79d. the biggest challengeto this scenario involves the low gas fraction in the group. if ss formed fromnormal field spirals then much of the gas is missing. finally, despite itsadvanced stage of evolution, we find no evidence for major mergers and inferthat ss (and sq) are telling us that such groups coalesce via slow dissolution.

1108.2130	the amiga sample of isolated galaxies ix. molecular gas properties	aims: we characterize the molecular gas content using co emission of aredshift-limited subsample of isolated galaxies from the amiga (analysis of theinterstellar medium of isolated galaxies) project. methods: we present the12co(1-0) data for 273 amiga galaxies. we constructed a redshift-limited samplecontaining galaxies with 1500\kms &lt;v&lt;5000\kms and excluded objects withmorphological evidence of possible interaction. this sample ($n=173$) is thebasis for our statistical analysis. it is dominated, both in absolute numberand in detection rate, by galaxies of type t=3-5 (sb-sc). most galaxies wereobserved with a single pointing towards their centers. therefore, we performedan extrapolation to the total molecular gas mass expected in the entire diskbased on the assumption of an exponential distribution. we then studied therelationships between \mhtwo\ and other galactic properties (\lb,\dopttwo,\lk,\lfir, and \mhi). results: we find correlations between \mhtwo\ and \lb,\dopttwo, \lk, and \lfir. the tightest correlation of \mhtwo\ holds with \lfir\and, for $t=3-5$, with \lk, and the poorest with \dopttwo. the correlationswith \lfir and \lk are very close to linearity. the correlation with \lb isnonlinear so that \mhtwo/\lb\ increases with \lb. the molecular and the atomicgas masses of our sample show no strong correlation. we find a low mean value,log(\mhtwo/\mhi)=-0.7 (for $t=3-5$), and a strong decrease in this ratio withmorphological type. the molecular gas column density and the surface density ofthe star formation rate (the kennicutt-schmidt law) show a tight correlationwith a rough unity slope. we compare the relations of \mhtwo\ with \lb and \lkfound for amiga galaxies to samples of interacting galaxies from the literatureand find an indication for an enhancement of the molecular gas in interactinggalaxies of up to 0.2-0.3 dex.

1112.6241	aztec 1.1 mm observations of the mbm12 molecular cloud	we present 1.1 mm observations of the dust continuum emission from the mbm12high-latitude molecular cloud observed with the astronomical thermal emissioncamera (aztec) mounted on the james clerk maxwell telescope on mauna kea,hawaii. we surveyed a 6.34 deg$^2$ centered on mbm12, making this the largestarea that has ever been surveyed in this region with submillimeter andmillimeter telescopes. eight secure individual sources were detected with asignal-to-noise ratio of over 4.4. these eight aztec sources can be consideredto be real astronomical objects compared to the other candidates based oncalculations of the false detection rate. the distribution of the detected 1.1mm sources or compact 1.1 mm peaks is spatially anti-correlated with that ofthe 100 micronm emission and the $^{12}$co emission. we detected the 1.1 mmdust continuum emitting sources associated with two classical t tauri stars,lkhalpha262 and lkhalpha264. observations of spectral energy distributions(seds) indicate that lkhalpha262 is likely to be class ii (pre-main-sequencestar), but there are also indications that it could be a late class i(protostar). a flared disk and a bipolar cavity in the models of class isources lead to more complicated seds. from the present aztec observations ofthe mbm12 region, it appears that other sources detected with aztec are likelyto be extragalactic and located behind mbm12. some of these have radiocounterparts and their star formation rates are derived from a fit of the sedsto the photometric evolution of galaxies in which the effects of a dustyinterstellar medium have been included.

1202.0458	on the molecular gas content and sfr in hickson compact groups: enhanced  or deficient?	we study the effect of the extreme environment in hickson compact groups(hcgs) on the molecular gas mass, \mhtwo, and the star formation rate (sfr) ofgalaxies as a function of atomic hydrogen (hi) content and evolutionary phaseof the group. we have selected a redshift limited (d$&lt;$100 mpc) sample of 88galaxies in 20 hcgs with available atomic hydrogen (hi) vla maps, covering awide range of hi deficiencies and evolutionary phases of the groups, andcontaining at least one spiral galaxy. we derived the far-infrared (fir)luminosity (\lfir) from iras data and used it as a tracer of the sfr. wecalculated the hi mass, \lfir and \mhtwo deficiencies. the mean deficiencies of\lfir and \mhtwo of spiral galaxies in hcgs are close to 0, indicating thattheir average sfr and molecular gas content are similar to those of isolatedgalaxies. however, there are indications of an excess in \mhtwo\($\sim$ 50%) inspiral galaxies in hcgs which can be interpreted as either an enhancedmolecular gas content or as a higher concentration of \mhtwo towards the centerin comparison to galaxies in lower density environments. in contrast, the mean\mhi of spiral galaxies in hcgs is only 12% of the expected value. the specificstar formation rate (ssfr= sfr/stellar mass) tends to be lower for galaxieswith a higher \mhtwo\ or \mhi\ deficiency. this trend is not seen for the starformation efficiency (sfe=sfr/\mhtwo). we found tentative indications for anenhancement of \mhtwo\ in spiral galaxies in hcgs in an early evolutionaryphase and a decrease in later phases. we suggest that this might be due to anenhancement of the conversion from atomic to molecular gas due to on-goingtidal interactions in an early evolutionary phase, followed by hi stripping anda decrease of the molecular gas content because of lack of replenishment.

1203.2609	the source counts of submillimetre galaxies detected at 1.1 mm	the source counts of galaxies discovered at sub-millimetre and millimetrewavelengths provide important information on the evolution of infrared-brightgalaxies. we combine the data from six blank-field surveys carried out at 1.1mm with aztec, totalling 1.6 square degrees in area with root-mean-squaredepths ranging from 0.4 to 1.7 mjy, and derive the strongest constraints todate on the 1.1 mm source counts at flux densities s(1100) = 1-12 mjy. usingadditional data from the aztec cluster environment survey to extend the countsto s(1100) ~ 20 mjy, we see tentative evidence for an enhancement relative tothe exponential drop in the counts at s(1100) ~ 13 mjy and a smooth connectionto the bright source counts at &gt;20 mjy measured by the south pole telescope;this excess may be due to strong lensing effects. we compare these counts topredictions from several semi-analytical and phenomenological models and findthat for most the agreement is quite good at flux densities &gt; 4 mjy; however,we find significant discrepancies (&gt;3sigma) between the models and the observed1.1 mm counts at lower flux densities, and none of them are consistent with theobserved turnover in the euclidean-normalised counts at s(1100) &lt; 2 mjy. ournew results therefore may require modifications to existing evolutionary modelsfor low luminosity galaxies. alternatively, the discrepancy between themeasured counts at the faint end and predictions from phenomenological modelscould arise from limited knowledge of the spectral energy distributions offaint galaxies in the local universe.

1203.5542	quest for cosmos submillimeter galaxy counterparts using carma and vla:  identifying three high-redshift starburst galaxies	we report on interferometric observations at 1.3 mm at 2"-3" resolution usingthe combined array for research in millimeter-wave astronomy (carma). weidentify multi-wavelength counterparts of three submillimeter galaxies (smgs;f(1mm)&gt;5.5 mjy) in the cosmos field, initially detected with mambo and aztecbolometers at low, ~10"-30", resolution. all three sources -- aztec/c1, cosbo-3and cosbo-8 -- are identified to coincide with positions of 20 cm radiosources. cosbo-3, however, is not associated with the most likely radiocounterpart, closest to the mambo source position, but that further away fromit. this illustrates the need for intermediate-resolution (~2") mm-observationsto identify the correct counterparts of single-dish detected smgs. all of ourthree sources become prominent only at nir wavelengths, and their mm-to-radioflux based redshifts suggest that they lie at redshifts z&gt;~2. as a proof ofconcept, we show that photometric redshifts can be well determined for smgs,and we find photometric-redshifts of 5.6+/-1.2, 1.9+0.9(-0.5), and ~4 foraztec/c1, cosbo-3, and cosbo-8, respectively. using these we infer that thesegalaxies have radio-based star formation rates of &gt;~1000 msol/yr, and irluminosities of ~10^13 lsol consistent with properties of high-redshift smgs.in summary, our sources reflect a variety of smg properties in terms ofredshift and clustering, consistent with the framework that smgs areprogenitors of z~2 and today's passive galaxies.

1209.0786	hi asymmetry in the isolated galaxy cig 85 (ugc 1547)	we present the results from the giant metrewave radio telescope (gmrt)interferometric hi and 20 cm radio continuum observations of cig 85, anisolated asymmetric galaxy from the amiga (analysis of the interstellar mediumof isolated galaxies) sample. despite being an isolated galaxy, cig 85 showedan appreciable optical and hi spectral asymmetry and therefore was an excellentcandidate for resolved hi studies to understand the reasons giving rise toasymmetries in isolated galaxies. the galaxy was imaged in hi and 20 cm radiocontinuum using the gmrt. for a detailed discussion of the results we also madeuse of multi-wavelength data from archival sdss, galex and halpha imaging. wefind the hi in cig 85 to have a clumpy, asymmetric distribution which in the nwpart is correlated with optical tail like features, but the hi velocity fielddisplays a relatively regular rotation pattern. evaluating all theobservational evidence, we come to a conclusion that cig 85 is most likely acase of a disturbed spiral galaxy which now appears to have the morphology ofan irregular galaxy. although it is currently isolated from major companions,the observational evidence is consistent with hi asymmetries, a highlydisturbed optical disk and recent increase in star formation having been causedby a minor merger, remnants of which are now projected in front of the opticaldisk. if this is correct, the companion will be fully accreted by cig 85 in thenear future.

1301.4549	enhanced warm h2 emission in the compact group mid-infrared "green  valley"	we present results from a spitzer, mid-infrared spectroscopy study of asample of 74 galaxies located in 23 hickson compact groups, chosen to be at adynamically-active stage of hi depletion. we find evidence for enhanced warm h2emission (i.e. above that associated with uv excitation in star-formingregions) in 14 galaxies (~20%), with 8 galaxies having extreme values of l(h2s(0)-s(3))/l(7.7micron pah), in excess of 0.07. such emission has been seenpreviously in the compact group hcg 92 (stephan's quintet), and was shown to beassociated with the dissipation of mechanical energy associated with alarge-scale shock caused when one group member collided, at high velocity, withtidal debris in the intragroup medium. similarly, shock excitation or turbulentheating is likely responsible for the enhanced h2 emission in the compact groupgalaxies, since other sources of heating (uv or x-ray excitation from starformation or agn) are insufficient to account for the observed emission. thegroup galaxies fall predominantly in a region of mid-infrared color-color spaceidentified by previous studies as being connected to rapid transformations inhcg galaxy evolution. furthermore, the majority of h2-enhanced galaxies lie inthe optical "green valley" between the blue cloud and red-sequence, and areprimarily early-type disk systems. we suggest that h2-enhanced systems mayrepresent a specific phase in the evolution of galaxies in dense environmentsand provide new insight into mechanisms which transform galaxies onto theoptical red sequence.

1305.5865	dynamical modeling of galaxy mergers using identikit	we present dynamical models of four interacting systems: ngc 5257/8, themice, the antennae, and ngc 2623. the parameter space of the encounters areconstrained using the identikit model-matching and visualization tool.identikit utilizes hybrid n-body and test particle simulations to enable rapidexploration of the parameter space of galaxy mergers. the identikit-derivedmatches of these systems are reproduced with self-consistent collisionlesssimulations which show very similar results. the models generally reproduce theobserved morphology and \hi\ kinematics of the tidal tails in these systemswith reasonable properties inferred for the progenitor galaxies. the modelspresented here are the first to appear in the literature for ngc 5257/8 and ngc2623, and the mice and the antennae are compared with previously publishedmodels. based on the assumed mass model and our derived initial conditions, themodels indicate the four systems are currently being viewed 175-260 myr afterfirst passage and cover a wide range of merger stages. in some instances thereare mismatches between the models and the data (e.g., in the length of a tail);these are likely due to our adoption of a single mass model for all galaxies.despite the use of a single mass model, these results demonstrate the utilityof identikit in constraining the parameter space for galaxy mergers whenapplied to real data.

1405.2594	a ~ 12 kpc hi extension and other hi asymmetries in the isolated galaxy  cig 340 (ic 2487)	hi kinematic asymmetries are common in late-type galaxies irrespective ofenvironment, although the amplitudes are strikingly low in isolated galaxies.as part of our studies of the hi morphology and kinematics in isolatedlate-type galaxies we have chosen several very isolated galaxies from the amigasample for hi mapping. here we present gmrt 21-cm hi line mapping of cig 340which was selected because its integrated hi spectrum has a very symmetricprofile, aflux = 1.03. optical images of the galaxy hinted at a warped disk incontrast to the symmetric integrated hi spectrum profile. our aim is todetermine the extent to which the optical asymmetry is reflected in theresolved hi morphology and kinematics. gmrt observations reveal significant himorphological asymmetries in cig 340 despite it's overall symmetric opticalform and highly symmetric hi spectrum. the most notable hi features are: 1) awarp in the hi disk (with an optical counterpart), 2) the hi north/south fluxratio = 1.32 is much larger than expected from the integrated hi spectrumprofile and 3) a ~ 45" (12 kpc) hi extension, containing ~ 6% of the detectedhi mass on the northern side of the disk. we conclude that in isolated galaxiesa highly symmetric hi spectrum can mask significant hi morphologicalasymmetries. the northern hi extension appears to be the result of a recentperturbation (10^8 yr), possibly by a satellite which is now disrupted orprojected within the disk. this study provides an important step in our ongoingprogram to determine the predominant source of hi asymmetries in isolatedgalaxies. for cig 340 the isolation from major companions, symmetric hispectrum, optical morphology and interaction timescales have allowed us tonarrow the possible causes the hi asymmetries and identify tests to furtherconstrain the source of the asymmetries.

0806.3791	an aztec 1.1 mm survey of the goods-n field i: maps, catalogue, and  source statistics	we have conducted a deep and uniform 1.1 mm survey of the goods-n field withaztec on the james clerk maxwell telescope (jcmt). here we present the firstresults from this survey including maps, the source catalogue, and 1.1 mmnumber-counts. the results presented here were obtained from a 245 sq-arcminregion with near uniform coverage to a depth of 0.96-1.16 mjy/beam. our robustcatalogue contains 28 source candidates detected with s/n &gt;= 3.75, only 1-2 ofwhich are expected to be spurious detections. of these source candidates, 8 arealso detected by scuba at 850 um in regions where there is good overlap betweenthe two surveys. the major advantage of our survey over that with scuba is theuniformity of coverage. we calculate number counts using two differenttechniques: the first using a frequentist parameter estimation, and the secondusing a bayesian method. the two sets of results are in good agreement. we findthat the 1.1 mm differential number counts are well described in the 2-6 mjyrange by the functional form dn/ds = n' (s'/s) exp(-s/s') with fittedparameters s' = 1.25 +/-0.38 mjy and dn/ds = 300 +/- 90 per mjy per sq-deg at 3mjy.

astro-ph;0010252	the central velocity field in ngc 253 : possible indication of a bar	we have investigated whether motion of gas in a bar-like potential canaccount for the peculiar but systematic velocity field observed in the nuclearregion of the starburst galaxy ngc 253. this unusual velocity field withgradients along both major and minor axes was revealed in a high resolution($1.8^{\arcsec}\times 1.0^{\arcsec}$) h92$\alpha$ recombination lineobservation by anantharamiah and goss (1996). a simple logarithmic potential isused to model the bar. assuming that the bulk of the gas flows along closed andnon-intersecting x1 (bar) and x2 (anti-bar) orbits of the bar potential, wehave computed the expected velocity field and position-velocity diagrams andcompared them with the observations. a comparison of the integrated cointensity maps with the spatial distribution of the x1 and x2 orbits in themodel indicates that the nuclear molecular gas in ngc 253 lies mainly on the x2orbits. we also find that the velocity field observed in the central 100 pcregion in the h92$\alpha$ recombination line is well accounted for by the barmodel if most of the ionized gas resides in the inner x2 orbits. however, themodel is unable to explain the velocity field on a larger scale of $\sim 500$pc observed using the ovro interferometer with a resolution of$5^{\arcsec}\times 3^{\arcsec}$. the direction of the observed co velocityfield appears twisted compared to the model. we suggest that this perturbationin the velocity field may be due to an accretion event that could have occurred$10^7$ years ago.

astro-ph;0108223	where is the neutral atomic gas in hickson groups?	we have analyzed the total hi contents of 72 hickson compact groups ofgalaxies (hcgs) and the detailed spatial distributions and kinematics of hiwithin a subset of 16 groups using the high angular resolution observationsobtained with the vla in order to investigate a possible evolutionary scenariofor these densest systems in the present day galaxy hierarchy. for the morehomogeneous subsample of 48 groups, we found a mean hi deficiency of defhi = 40(40% of the expected hi for the lbs and morphological types of the membergalaxies). the individual galaxies show larger degrees of deficiency than thegroups globally, defhi = 0.62 (24% of the expected hi), due in most cases toefficient gas stripping from individual galaxies into the group environmentvisible in the vla maps. the degree of deficiency is found to be similar to thecentral galaxies of virgo and coma cluster, and coma i group, in spite of thesignificantly different characteristics of these environments. phasetransformation of the hi should explain the deficiency. the detection rate ofhcgs at x-ray wavelengths is larger for hi deficient groups. in theevolutionary scenario we propose, the amount of detected hi would decreasefurther with evolution, by continuous tidal stripping and/or heating. the h2content also tends to be lower than expected for the galaxies in hi deficientgroups, this may suggest that the hi stripping by frequent tidal interactionbreaks the balance between the disruption of molecular clouds by star formationand the replenishment from the ambient hi.

0808.2391	star formation rates in lyman break galaxies: radio stacking of lbgs in  the cosmos field and the sub-$\mu$jy radio source population	we present an analysis of the radio properties of large samples of lymanbreak galaxies (lbgs) at $z \sim 3$, 4, and 5 from the cosmos field. the medianstacking analysis yields a statistical detection of the $z \sim 3$ lbgs (u-banddrop-outs), with a 1.4 ghz flux density of $0.90 \pm 0.21 \mu$jy. the stackedemission is unresolved, with a size $&lt; 1"$, or a physical size $&lt; 8$kpc. thetotal star formation rate implied by this radio luminosity is $31\pm 7$$m_\odot$ year$^{-1}$, based on the radio-fir correlation in low redshift starforming galaxies. the star formation rate derived from a similar analysis ofthe uv luminosities is 17 $m_\odot$ year$^{-1}$, without any correction for uvdust attenuation. the simplest conclusion is that the dust attenuation factoris 1.8 at uv wavelengths. however, this factor is considerably smaller than thestandard attenuation factor $\sim 5$, normally assumed for lbgs. we discusspotential reasons for this discrepancy, including the possibility that the dustattenuation factor at $z \ge 3$ is smaller than at lower redshifts. conversely,the radio luminosity for a given star formation rate may be systematicallylower at very high redshift. two possible causes for a suppressed radioluminosity are: (i) increased inverse compton cooling of the relativisticelectron population due to scattering off the increasing cmb at high redshift,or (ii) cosmic ray diffusion from systematically smaller galaxies. the radiodetections of individual sources are consistent with a radio-loud agn fractionof 0.3%. one source is identified as a very dusty, extreme starburst galaxy (a'submm galaxy').

0809.0329	the evolution of galaxy disks in dense environments - lessons from  compact galaxy groups	disk galaxies in compact galaxy groups exhibit a remarkable shortfall ofneutral hydrogen compared to both isolated spirals and spirals in more loosegroups, but the origin of this hi deficiency remains unclear. based on a sampleof highly hi deficient compact galaxy groups, here updated to also include hcg58 and hcg 93, we summarise the first results of a multi-wavelength campaignaimed at understanding the processes responsible for modifying the hi contentof galaxy disks in these environments. while tidal stripping, ram pressurestripping by hot intragroup gas, and star-formation induced strangulation couldindividually be affecting the ism in some of the group members, these processeseach face specific difficulties in explaining the inferred deficiency of hi forthe sample as a whole. a complete picture of the mechanisms driving the ismevolution in the disk galaxies of these groups has thus yet to emerge, butpromising avenues for further progress in this field are briefly discussed onthe basis of the present sample.

astro-ph;0601582	the bolocam 1.1 mm lockman hole galaxy survey: sharc ii 350 micron  photometry and implications for spectral models, dust temperatures, and  redshift estimation	we present 350 micron photometry of all 17 galaxy candidates in the lockmanhole detected in a 1.1 mm bolocam survey. several of the galaxies werepreviously detected at 850 microns, at 1.2 mm, in the infrared by spitzer, andin the radio. nine of the bolocam galaxy candidates were detected at 350microns and two new candidates were serendipitously detected at 350 microns(bringing the total in the literature detected in this way to three). five ofthe galaxies have published spectroscopic redshifts, enabling investigation ofthe implied temperature ranges and a comparison of photometric redshifttechniques.  lambda = 350 microns lies near the spectral energy distribution peak for z =2.5 thermally emitting galaxies. thus, luminosities can be measured withoutextrapolating to the peak from detection wavelengths of lambda &gt; 850 microns.characteristically, the galaxy luminosities lie in the range 1.0 - 1.2 x 10^13l_solar, with dust temperatures in the range of 40 k to 70 k, depending on thechoice of spectral index and wavelength of unit optical depth. the implied dustmasses are 3 - 5 x 10^8 m_solar. we find that the far-infrared to radiorelation for star-forming ulirgs systematically overpredicts the radioluminosities and overestimates redshifts on the order of delta z ~ 1, whereasredshifts based on either on submillimeter data alone or the 1.6 micron stellarbump and pah features are more accurate.

astro-ph;0602554	powerful high velocity-dispersion molecular hydrogen associated with an  intergalactic shock wave in stephan's quintet	we present the discovery of strong mid-infrared emission lines of molecularhydrogen of apparently high velocity dispersion (~870 km/s) originating from agroup-wide shock wave in stephan's quintet. these spitzer space telescopeobservations reveal emission lines of molecular hydrogen and little else. thisis the first time an almost pure h_2 line spectrum has been seen in anextragalactic object. along with the absence of pah features and very lowexcitation ionized gas tracers, the spectra resemble shocked gas seen ingalactic supernova remnants, but on a vast scale. the molecular emissionextends over 24 kpc along the x-ray emitting shock-front, but has ten times thesurface luminosity as the soft x-rays, and about one-third the surfaceluminosity of the ir continuum. we suggest that the powerful h_2 emission isgenerated by the shock wave caused when a high-velocity intruder galaxycollides with filaments of gas in the galaxy group. our observations suggest aclose connection between galaxy-scale shock-waves and strong broad h_2 emissionlines, like those seen in the spectra of ultraluminous infrared galaxies wherehigh-speed collisions between galaxy disks are common.

astro-ph;9702031	resolution and kinematics of molecular gas surrounding the cloverleaf  quasar at z=2.6 using the gravitational lens	gravitational lenses have long been advertised as primitive telescopes,capable of magnifying cosmologically distant sources (zwicky 1937). in thisletter, we present new 0''.9 resolution co (7-6) observations of the z=2.56cloverleaf quasar (h 1413+117) and spatially resolved images. by modeling thegravitational lens, we infer a size scale of 0''.3 (~1 kpc) for the moleculargas structure surrounding the quasar, and the gas has a kinematic structureroughly consistent with a rotating disk. the observed properties of the coemitting gas are similar to the nuclear starburst complexes found in theinfrared luminous galaxies in the local universe, and metal enrichment byvigorous star formation within this massive nuclear gas complex can explain theabundance of carbon and oxygen in the interstellar medium of this systemobserved when the universe was only a few billion years old. obtainingcorresponding details in an unlensed object at similar distances would be wellbeyond the reach of current instruments, and this study highlights the lessexploited yet powerful use of a gravitational lens as a natural telescope.

astro-ph;9706302	non-linear dependence of l(b) on l(fir) and m(h2) among spiral galaxies  and effects of tidal interaction	through the study of a carefully selected sample of isolated spiral galaxies,we have established that two important global physical quantities for tracingstar forming activities, l(fir) and m(h2), have non-linear dependence onanother commonly cited global quantity l(b). furthermore we show that simplepower law relations can effectively describe these non-linear relations forspiral galaxies spanning four orders of magnitude in fir and m(h2) and nearlythree orders of magnitude in l(b). while the existence of non-linear dependenceof m(h2) (assuming a constant co-to-h2 conversion) and l(fir) on opticalluminosity l(b) has been previously noted in the literature, an impropernormalization of simple scaling by l(b) has been commonly used in many previousstudies to claim enhanced molecular gas content and induced activities amongtidally interacting and other types of galaxies. we remove these non-lineareffects using the template relations derived from the isolated galaxy sampleand conclude that strongly interacting galaxies do not have enhanced moleculargas content, contrary to previous claims. with these non-linear relations amongl(b), l(fir) and m(h2) properly taken into account, we confirm again that thefir emission and the star formation efficiency l(fir)/m(h2) are indeed enhancedby tidal interactions. virgo galaxies show the same level of m(h2) and l(fir)as isolated galaxies. we do not find any evidence for enhanced star formingactivity among barred galaxies.

astro-ph;9907436	studying high redshift star forming galaxies at centimeter and  millimeter wavelengths	we discuss various aspects of centimeter and millimeter wavelength continuumand line observations of high redshift star forming galaxies. perhaps the mostimportant lesson is that sensitive observations at submm through cm wavelengthsreveal a population of active star forming galaxies at high redshift which areunseen in deep optical surveys due to dust obscuration. current models suggestthat this population represents the formation of the spheroidal components ofgalaxies at z between 2 and 5, constituting about half of the total amount ofcosmic star formation from the big bang to the present. high resolution imagingat cm wavelengths provides sub-arcsecond astrometry, and can be used to searchfor gravitational lensing and/or for the presence of an agn. radio continuumobservations provide unique information on the magnetic fields in earlygalaxies, and give a gross indication of the star formation rate, while theradio-to-submm spectral index provides a rough indication of source redshift.low j transitions of co are redshifted into the cm bands for z &gt; 2, allowingfor sensitive searches for co emission over large volumes at high redshift. wepresent recent results from the very large array (vla), and from the new 230ghz mpifr bolometer array at the iram 30m telescope. a wide field survey withthe bolometer array indicates a cut-off in the source distribution function atfir luminosities &gt; 3e12 l_sun. lastly, we summarize the scientific promise ofthe new vla.

astro-ph;9909056	tracing interactions in hcgs through the hi	we present a global study of hi spectral line mapping for 16 hickson compactgroups (hcgs) combining new and unpublished vla data, plus the analysis of thehi content of individual galaxies. sixty percent of the groups showmorphological and kinematical signs of perturbations (from multiple tidalfeatures to concentration of the hi in a single enveloping cloud) and sixtyfive of the resolved galaxies are found to be hi deficient with respect to asample of isolated galaxies. in total, 77% of the groups suffer interactionsamong all its members which provides strong evidence of their reality. we findthat dynamical evolution does not always produce hi deficiency, but when thisdeficiency is observed, it appears to correlate with a high group velocitydispersion and in some cases with the presence of a first-ranked elliptical.the x-ray data available for our sample are not sensitive enough for acomparison with the hi mass; however this study does suggest a correlationbetween hi deficiency and hot gas since velocity dispersions are known from theliterature to correlate with x-ray luminosity.

astro-ph;9910316	the scatter in the relationship between redshift and the radio-to-submm  spectral index	we derive the scatter in the relationship between redshift and radio-to-submmspectral index, alpha^{350}_{1.4}, using the observed spectral energydistributions of 17 low redshift star forming galaxies. a mean galaxy model isderived, along with the rms scatter in alpha^{350}_{1.4}. the scatter isroughly constant with redshift. constant rms scatter, combined with theflattening of the mean alpha^{350}_{1.4} -- z relationship with increasingredshift, leads to increasing uncertainty for redshift estimates at highredshifts. normalizing by the dust temperature in the manner proposed by blaindecreases the scatter in alpha^{350}_{1.4} for most of the sample, but does notremove outliers, and free-free absorption at rest frequencies above 1.4 ghz isnot likely to be a dominant cause for scatter in the alpha^{350}_{1.4} -- zrelationship. we re-derive the cumulative redshift distribution of the 14 fieldgalaxies in a recent submm and radio source sample of smail et al.. the mostlikely median redshift for the distribution is 2.7, with a conservative lowerlimit of z = 2, as was also found by smail et al. based on the originalalpha^{350}_{1.4} -- z models. the normalization and shape of the redshiftdistribution for the faint submm sources are consistent with those expected forforming elliptical galaxies.

astro-ph;9912411	the neutral hydrogen distribution in merging galaxies: differences  between stellar and gaseous tidal morphologies	we have mapped the neutral atomic gas (hi) in the three disk-disk mergersystems ngc 520, arp 220, and arp 299. these systems differ from the majorityof the mergers mapped in hi, in that their stellar and gaseous tidal featuresdo not coincide. in particular, they exhibit large stellar tidal features withlittle if any accompanying neutral gas and large gas-rich tidal features withlittle if any accompanying starlight. on smaller scales, there are strikinganti-correlations where the gaseous and stellar tidal features appear to cross.we explore several possible causes for these differences, including dustobscuration, ram pressure stripping, and ionization effects. no singleexplanation can account for all of the observed differences. the fact that eachof these systems shows evidence for a starburst driven superwind expanding inthe direction of the most striking anti-correlations leads us to suggest thatthe superwind is primarily responsible for the observed differences, either bysweeping the features clear of gas via ram pressure, or by excavating a clearsightline towards the starburst and allowing uv photons to ionize regions ofthe tails.

0810.3405	molecular gas in a submillimeter galaxy at z=4.5: evidence for a major  merger at 1 billion years after the big bang	we report the detection of co molecular line emission in the z=4.5millimeter-detected galaxy cosmos_j100054+023436 (hereafter: j100+0234) usingthe iram plateau de bure interferometer (pdbi) and nrao's very large array(vla). the co(4-3) line as observed with pdbi has a full line width of ~1000km/s, an integrated line flux of 0.66 jy km/s, and a co luminosity of 3.2e10l_sun. comparison to the 3.3sigma detection of the co(2-1) line emission withthe vla suggests that the molecular gas is likely thermalized to the j=4-3transition level. the corresponding molecular gas mass is 2.6e10 m_sun assumingan ulirg-like conversion factor. from the spatial offset of the red- andblue-shifted line peaks and the line width a dynamical mass of 1.1e11 m_sun isestimated assuming a merging scenario. the molecular gas distribution coincideswith the rest-frame optical and radio position of the object while being offsetby 0.5'' from the previously detected ly$\alpha$ emission. j1000+0234 exhibitsvery typical properties for lower redshift (z~2) sub-millimeter galaxies (smgs)and thus is very likely one of the long sought after high redshift (z&gt;4)objects of this population. the large co(4-3) line width taken together withits highly disturbed rest-frame uv geometry suggest an ongoing major mergerabout a billion years after the big bang. given its large star formation rate(sfr) of &gt;1000 m_sun/yr and molecular gas content this object could be theprecursor of a 'red-and-dead' elliptical observed at a redshift of z=2.

0812.0814	aztec millimetre survey of the cosmos field - ii. source count  overdensity and correlations with large-scale structure	we report an over-density of bright sub-millimetre galaxies (smgs) in the0.15 sq. deg. aztec/cosmos survey and a spatial correlation between the smgsand the optical-ir galaxy density at z &lt;~ 1.1. this portion of the cosmos fieldshows a ~ 3-sigma over-density of robust smg detections when compared to abackground, or "blankfield", population model that is consistent with smgsurveys of fields with no extragalactic bias. the smg over-density is mostsignificant in the number of very bright detections (14 sources with measuredfluxes s(1.1mm) &gt; 6 mjy), which is entirely incompatible with sample variancewithin our adopted blank-field number densities and infers an over-densitysignificance of &gt;&gt; 4. we find that the over-density and spatial correlation tooptical-ir galaxy density are most consistent with lensing of a background smgpopulation by foreground mass structures along the line of sight, rather thanphysical association of the smgs with the z &lt;~ 1.1 galaxies/clusters. the smgpositions are only weakly correlated with weak-lensing maps, suggesting thatthe dominant sources of correlation are individual galaxies and the moretenuous structures in the region and not the massive and compact clusters.these results highlight the important roles cosmic variance and large-scalestructure can play in the study of smgs.
