1008.0658	phat: photo-z accuracy testing	here we introduce phat, the photo-z accuracy testing programme, aninternational initiative to test and compare different methods of photo-zestimation. two different test environments are set up, one (phat0) based onsimulations to test the basic functionality of the different photo-z codes, andanother one (phat1) based on data from the goods survey. the accuracy of thedifferent methods is expressed and ranked by the global photo-z bias, scatter,and outlier rates. most methods agree well on phat0 but produce photo-zscatters that can differ by up to a factor of two even in this idealised case.a larger spread in accuracy is found for phat1. few methods benefit from theaddition of mid-ir photometry. remaining biases and systematic effects can beexplained by shortcomings in the different template sets and the use of priorson the one hand and an insufficient training set on the other hand. scatters of4-8% in delta_z/(1+z) were obtained, consistent with other studies. however,somewhat larger outlier rates (&gt;7.5% with delta_z/(1+z)&gt;0.15; &gt;4.5% aftercleaning) are found for all codes. there is a general trend that empiricalcodes produce smaller biases than template-based codes. the systematic,quantitative comparison of different photo-z codes presented here is a snapshotof the current state-of-the-art of photo-z estimation and sets a standard forthe assessment of photo-z accuracy in the future. the rather large outlierrates reported here for phat1 on real data should be investigated further sincethey are most probably also present (and possibly hidden) in many otherstudies. the test data sets are publicly available and can be used to comparenew methods to established ones and help in guiding future photo-z methoddevelopment.

1103.5618	the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash): strong  lensing analysis of abell 383 from 16-band hst wfc3/acs imaging	we examine the inner mass distribution of the relaxed galaxy cluster abell383 in deep 16-band hst/acs+wfc3 imaging taken as part of the clash multi-cycletreasury program. our program is designed to study the dark matter distributionin 25 massive clusters, and balances depth with a wide wavelength coverage tobetter identify lensed systems and generate precise photometric redshifts. thisinformation together with the predictive strength of our strong-lensinganalysis method identifies 13 new multiply-lensed images and candidates, sothat a total of 27 multiple-images of 9 systems are used to tightly constrainthe inner mass profile, $d\log \sigma/d\log r\simeq -0.6\pm 0.1$ (r&lt;160 kpc).we find consistency with the standard distance-redshift relation for the fullrange spanned by the lensed images, 1.01&lt;z&lt;6.03, with the higher redshiftsources deflected through larger angles as expected. the inner mass profilederived here is consistent with the results of our independent weak-lensinganalysis of wide-field subaru images, with good agreement in the region ofoverlap. the overall mass profile is well fitted by an nfw profile withm_{vir}=(5.37^{+0.70}_{-0.63}\pm 0.26) x 10^{14}m_{\odot}/h and a relativelyhigh concentration, c_{vir}=8.77^{+0.44}_{-0.42}\pm 0.23, which lies above thestandard c-m relation similar to other well-studied clusters. the criticalradius of abell 383 is modest by the standards of other lensing clusters,r_{e}\simeq16\pm2\arcsec (for z_s=2.55), so the relatively large number oflensed images uncovered here with precise photometric redshifts validates ourimaging strategy for the clash survey. in total we aim to provide similarlyhigh-quality lensing data for 25 clusters, 20 of which are x-ray selectedrelaxed clusters, enabling a precise determination of the representative massprofile free from lensing bias.

1107.2649	clash: new multiple-images constraining the inner mass profile of macs  j1206.2-0847	we present a strong-lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster macs j1206.2-0847($z$=0.44) using uv, optical, and ir, hst/acs/wfc3 data taken as part of theclash multi-cycle treasury program, with vlt/vimos spectroscopy for some of themultiply-lensed arcs. the clash observations, combined with our mass-model,allow us to identify 47 new multiply-lensed images of 12 distant sources. theseimages, along with the previously known arc, span the redshift range $1\laz\la5.5$, and thus enable us to derive a detailed mass distribution and toaccurately constrain, for the first time, the inner mass-profile of thiscluster. we find an inner profile slope of $d\log \sigma/d\log \theta\simeq-0.55\pm 0.1$ (in the range [1\arcsec, 53\arcsec], or $5\la r \la300$ kpc), ascommonly found for relaxed and well-concentrated clusters. using the manysystems uncovered here we derive credible critical curves and einstein radiifor different source redshifts. for a source at $z_{s}\simeq2.5$, the criticalcurve encloses a large area with an effective einstein radius of$\theta_{e}=28\pm3\arcsec$, and a projected mass of $1.34\pm0.15\times10^{14}m_{\odot}$. from the current understanding of structure formation inconcordance cosmology, these values are relatively high for clusters at$z\sim0.5$, so that detailed studies of the inner mass distribution of clusterssuch as macs j1206.2-0847 can provide stringent tests of the $\lambda$cdmparadigm.

1111.2544	calibrating the bao scale using the cmb: lifting the degeneracy between  geometric and dynamic distortions using the sound horizon from the cmb	the degeneracy between geometric (alcock-paczynski) and dynamic (redshiftspace) distortions in the pattern of the galaxy distribution has been a longstanding problem in the study of the large scale structure of the universe. weexamine the possibility of lifting this degeneracy and constrainingcosmological parameters by using the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) scale asa feature of known physical size, the sound horizon r_s ~ 150 mpc. wecallibrate this scale with the equivalent feature in the cosmic microwavebackground (cmb). first, we construct a toy model of a power spectrum whichincludes the bao as well as geometric and dynamic distortions. by adding aprior onto the sound horizon of ~1% we show, using a fisher matrix analysis,that error ellipses for line of sight and tangential distortion parametersshrink by a factor of two for a 20(gpc/h)^3 `despec/bigboss'-like galaxy surveyincluding shot noise. this improvement is even more marked in smaller surveys.we also carry out a monte carlo nested sampling analysis on our parameterspace. we find that monte carlo and fisher methods can agree reasonably wellfor surveys with large volume but differ greatly for small volume surveys.

0711.2163	predicting spectral features in galaxy spectra from broad-band  photometry	we explore the prospects of predicting emission line features present ingalaxy spectra given broad-band photometry alone. there is a general consentthat colours, and spectral features, most notably the 4000 a break, can predictmany properties of galaxies, including star formation rates and hence theycould infer some of the line properties. we argue that these techniques havegreat prospects in helping us understand line emission in extragalactic objectsand might speed up future galaxy redshift surveys if they are to targetemission line objects only. we use two independent methods, artifical neuralneworks (based on the annz code) and locally weighted regression (lwr), toretrieve correlations present in the colour n-dimensional space and to predictthe equivalent widths present in the corresponding spectra. we also investigatehow well it is possible to separate galaxies with and without lines from broadband photometry only. we find, unsurprisingly, that recombination lines can bewell predicted by galaxy colours. however, among collisional lines some can andsome cannot be predicted well from galaxy colours alone, without any furtherredshift information. we also use our techniques to estimate how muchinformation contained in spectral diagnostic diagrams can be recovered frombroad-band photometry alone. we find that it is possible to classify agn andstar formation objects relatively well using colours only. we suggest that thistechnique could be used to considerably improve redshift surveys such as theupcoming fmos survey and the planned wfmos survey.

1211.2230	a census of star-forming galaxies in the z~9-10 universe based on  hst+spitzer observations over 19 clash clusters: three candidate z~9-10  galaxies and improved constraints on the star formation rate density at z~9	we utilise a two-color lyman-break selection criterion to search for z~9-10galaxies over the first 19 clusters in the clash program. a systematic searchyields three z~9-10 candidates. while we have already reported the most robustof these candidates, macs1149-jd, two additional z~9 candidates are also foundand have h_{160}-band magnitudes of ~26.2-26.9. a careful assessment of varioussources of contamination suggests &lt;~1 contaminants for our z~9-10 selection. todetermine the implications of these search results for the lf and sfr densityat z~9, we introduce a new differential approach to deriving these quantitiesin lensing fields. our procedure is to derive the evolution by comparing thenumber of z~9-10 galaxy candidates found in clash with the number of galaxiesin a slightly lower redshift sample (after correcting for the differences inselection volumes), here taken to be z~8. this procedure takes advantage of thefact that the relative volumes available for the z~8 and z~9-10 selectionsbehind lensing clusters are not greatly dependent on the details of the lensingmodels. we find that the normalization of the uv lf at z~9 is just0.28_{-0.20}^{+0.39}\times that at z~8, ~1.4_{-0.8}^{+3.0}x lower thanextrapolating z~4-8 lf results. while consistent with the evolution in the uvlf seen at z~4-8, these results marginally favor a more rapid evolution at z&gt;8.compared to similar evolutionary findings from the hudf, our result is lessinsensitive to large-scale structure uncertainties, given our many independentsightlines on the high-redshift universe.

1306.5236	star/galaxy separation at faint magnitudes: application to a simulated  dark energy survey	we address the problem of separating stars from galaxies in future largephotometric surveys. we focus our analysis on simulations of the dark energysurvey (des). in the first part of the paper, we derive the sciencerequirements on star/galaxy separation, for measurement of the cosmologicalparameters with the gravitational weak lensing and large scale structureprobes. these requirements are dictated by the need to control both thestatistical and systematic errors on the cosmological parameters, and by pointspread function calibration. we formulate the requirements in terms of thecompleteness and purity provided by a given star/galaxy classifier. in order toachieve these requirements at faint magnitudes, we propose a new method forstar/galaxy separation in the second part of the paper. we first use principalcomponent analysis to outline the correlations between the objects parametersand extract from it the most relevant information. we then use the reduced setof parameters as input to an artificial neural network. this multi-parameterapproach improves upon purely morphometric classifiers (such as the classifierimplemented in sextractor), especially at faint magnitudes: it increases thepurity by up to 20% for stars and by up to 12% for galaxies, at i-magnitudefainter than 23.

1307.5847	evidence for ubiquitous, high-ew nebular emission in z~7 galaxies:  towards a clean measurement of the specific star formation rate using a  sample of bright, magnified galaxies	growing observational evidence now indicates that nebular line emission has asignificant impact on the rest-frame optical fluxes of z~5-7 galaxies observedwith spitzer. this line emission makes z~5-7 galaxies appear more massive, withlower specific star formation rates. however, corrections for this lineemission have been very difficult to perform reliably due to huge uncertaintieson the overall strength of such emission at z&gt;~5.5. here, we present the mostdirect observational evidence yet for ubiquitous high-ew [oiii]+hbeta lineemission in lyman-break galaxies at z~7, while also presenting a strategy foran improved measurement of the ssfr at z~7. we accomplish this through theselection of bright galaxies in the narrow redshift window z~6.6-7.0 where theirac 4.5 micron flux provides a clean measurement of the stellar continuumlight. observed 4.5 micron fluxes in this window contrast with the 3.6 micronfluxes which are contaminated by the prominent [oiii]+hbeta lines. to ensure ahigh s/n for our irac flux measurements, we consider only the brightest(h_{160}&lt;26 mag) magnified galaxies we have identified in clash and otherprograms targeting galaxy clusters. remarkably, the mean rest-frame opticalcolor for our bright seven-source sample is very blue, [3.6]-[4.5]=-0.9+/-0.3.such blue colors cannot be explained by the stellar continuum light and requirethat the rest-frame ew of [oiii]+hbeta be greater than 637 angstroms for theaverage source. the bluest four sources from our seven-source sample require aneven more extreme ew of 1582 angstroms. our derived lower limit for the mean[oiii]+hbeta ew could underestimate the true ew by ~2x based on a simplemodeling of the redshift distribution of our sources. we can also set a robustlower limit of &gt;~4 gyr^-1 on the specific star formation rates based on themean sed for our seven-source sample.

1405.5521	a prescription for galaxy biasing evolution as a nuisance parameter	there is currently no consistent approach to modelling galaxy bias evolutionin cosmological inference. this lack of a common standard makes the rigorouscomparison or combination of probes difficult. we show that the choice ofbiasing model has a significant impact on cosmological parameter constraintsfor a survey such as the dark energy survey (des), considering the 2-pointcorrelations of galaxies in five tomographic redshift bins. we find thatmodelling galaxy bias with a free biasing parameter per redshift bin gives afigure of merit (fom) for dark energy equation of state parameters w_0, w_asmaller by a factor of 10 than if a constant bias is assumed. an incorrect biasmodel will also cause a shift in measured values of cosmological parameters.motivated by these points and focusing on the redshift evolution of linearbias, we propose the use of a generalised galaxy bias which encompasses a rangeof bias models from theory, observations and simulations, b(z) = c + (b_0 -c)/d(z)^alpha, where parameters c, b_0 and alpha depend on galaxy propertiessuch as halo mass. for a des-like galaxy survey we find that this model givesan unbiased estimate of w_0, w_a with the same number or fewer nuisanceparameters and a higher fom than a simple b(z) model allowed to vary in z-bins.we show how the parameters of this model are correlated with cosmologicalparameters. we fit a range of bias models to two recent datasets, and concludethat this generalised parameterisation is a sensible benchmark expression ofgalaxy bias on large scales.

1406.4407	photometric redshift analysis in the dark energy survey science  verification data	we present results from a study of the photometric redshift performance ofthe dark energy survey (des), using the early data from a science verification(sv) period of observations in late 2012 and early 2013 that providedscience-quality images for almost 200 sq.~deg.~at the nominal depth of thesurvey. we assess the photometric redshift performance using about 15000galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts available from other surveys. thesegalaxies are used, in different configurations, as a calibration sample, andphoto-$z$'s are obtained and studied using most of the existing photo-$z$codes. a weighting method in a multi-dimensional color-magnitude space isapplied to the spectroscopic sample in order to evaluate the photo-$z$performance with sets that mimic the full des photometric sample, which is onaverage significantly deeper than the calibration sample due to the limiteddepth of spectroscopic surveys. empirical photo-$z$ methods using, forinstance, artificial neural networks or random forests, yield the bestperformance in the tests, achieving core photo-$z$ resolutions $\sigma_{68}\sim 0.08$. moreover, the results from most of the codes, including templatefitting methods, comfortably meet the des requirements on photo-$z$performance, therefore, providing an excellent precedent for future des datasets.

0705.1437	photo-z for weak lensing tomography from space: the role of optical and  near-ir photometry	we study in detail the photometric redshift requirements needed fortomographic weak gravitational lensing in order to measure accurately the darkenergy equation of state. in particular, we examine how ground-based photometry(u,g,r,i,z,y) can be complemented by space-based near-infrared (ir) photometry(j,h), e.g. on board the planned dune satellite. using realistic photometricredshift simulations and an artificial neural network photo-z method weevaluate the figure of merit for the dark energy parameters $(w_0, w_a)$. weconsider a dune-like broad optical filter supplemented with ground-basedmulti-band optical data from surveys like the dark energy survey, pan-starrsand lsst. we show that the dark energy figure of merit would improved by afactor of 1.3 to 1.7 if ir filters are added on board dune. furthermore we showthat with ir data catastrophic photo-z outliers can be removed effectively.there is an interplay between the choice of filters, the magnitude limits andthe removal of outliers. we draw attention to the dependence of the results onthe galaxy formation scenarios encoded into the mock galaxies, e.g the galaxyreddening. for example, deep u band data could be as effective as the ir. wealso find that about $10^5-10^6$ spectroscopic redshifts are needed forcalibration of the full survey.

1407.3801	combining dark energy survey science verification data with near  infrared data from the eso vista hemisphere survey	we present the combination of optical data from the science verificationphase of the dark energy survey (des) with near infrared data from the esovista hemisphere survey (vhs). the deep optical detections from des are used toextract fluxes and associated errors from the shallower vhs data. joint 7-band($grizyjk$) photometric catalogues are produced in a single 3 sq-deg decamfield centred at 02h26m$-$04d36m where the availability of ancillarymulti-wavelength photometry and spectroscopy allows us to test the dataquality. dual photometry increases the number of des galaxies with measured vhsfluxes by a factor of $\sim$4.5 relative to a simple catalogue level matchingand results in a $\sim$1.5 mag increase in the 80\% completeness limit of thenir data. almost 70\% of des sources have useful nir flux measurements in thisinitial catalogue. photometric redshifts are estimated for a subset of galaxieswith spectroscopic redshifts and initial results, although currently limited bysmall number statistics, indicate that the vhs data can help reduce thephotometric redshift scatter at both $z&lt;0.5$ and $z&gt;1$. we present exampledes+vhs colour selection criteria for high redshift luminous red galaxies(lrgs) at $z\sim0.7$ as well as luminous quasars. using spectroscopicobservations in this field we show that the additional vhs fluxes enable acleaner selection of both populations with $&lt;$10\% contamination from galacticstars in the case of spectroscopically confirmed quasars and $&lt;0.5\%$contamination from galactic stars in the case of spectroscopically confirmedlrgs. the combined des+vhs dataset, which will eventually cover almost 5000sq-deg, will therefore enable a range of new science and be ideally suited fortarget selection for future wide-field spectroscopic surveys.

1502.05747	the echo science case	the discovery of almost 2000 exoplanets has revealed an unexpectedly diverseplanet population. observations to date have shown that our solar system iscertainly not representative of the general population of planets in our milkyway. the key science questions that urgently need addressing are therefore:what are exoplanets made of? why are planets as they are? what causes theexceptional diversity observed as compared to the solar system?  echo (exoplanet characterisation observatory) has been designed as adedicated survey mission for transit and eclipse spectroscopy capable ofobserving a large and diverse planet sample within its four-year missionlifetime. echo can target the atmospheres of super-earths, neptune-like, andjupiter-like planets, in the very hot to temperate zones (planet temperaturesof 300k-3000k) of f to m-type host stars. over the next ten years, several newground- and space-based transit surveys will come on-line (e.g. ngts, cheops,tess, plato), which will specifically focus on finding bright, nearby systems.the current rapid rate of discovery would allow the target list to be furtheroptimised in the years prior to echo's launch and enable the atmosphericcharacterisation of hundreds of planets. placing the satellite at l2 provides acold and stable thermal environment, as well as a large field of regard toallow efficient time-critical observation of targets randomly distributed overthe sky. a 1m class telescope is sufficiently large to achieve the necessaryspectro-photometric precision. the spectral coverage (0.5-11 micron, goal 16micron) and snr to be achieved by echo, thanks to its high stability anddedicated design, would enable a very accurate measurement of the atmosphericcomposition and structure of hundreds of exoplanets.

1507.05647	mapping and simulating systematics due to spatially-varying observing  conditions in des science verification data	spatially-varying depth and characteristics of observing conditions, such asseeing, airmass, or sky background, are major sources of systematicuncertainties in modern galaxy survey analyses, in particular in deepmulti-epoch surveys. we present a framework to extract and project thesesources of systematics onto the sky, and apply it to the dark energy survey(des) to map the observing conditions of the science verification (sv) data.the resulting distributions and maps of sources of systematics are used inseveral analyses of des sv to perform detailed null tests with the data, andalso to incorporate systematics in survey simulations. we illustrate thecomplementarity of these two approaches by comparing the sv data with thebcc-ufig, a synthetic sky catalogue generated by forward-modelling of the dessv images. we analyse the bcc-ufig simulation to construct galaxy samplesmimicking those used in sv galaxy clustering studies. we show that thespatially-varying survey depth imprinted in the observed galaxy densities andthe redshift distributions of the sv data are successfully reproduced by thesimulation and well-captured by the maps of observing conditions. the combineduse of the maps, the sv data and the bcc-ufig simulation allows us to quantifythe impact of spatial systematics on $n(z)$, the redshift distributionsinferred using photometric redshifts. we conclude that spatial systematics inthe sv data are mainly due to seeing fluctuations and are under control incurrent clustering and weak lensing analyses. the framework presented here isrelevant to all multi-epoch surveys, and will be essential for exploitingfuture surveys such as the large synoptic survey telescope (lsst), which willrequire detailed null-tests and realistic end-to-end image simulations tocorrectly interpret the deep, high-cadence observations of the sky.

1508.02381	digging deeper into the southern skies: a compact milky-way companion  discovered in first-year dark energy survey data	the dark energy survey (des) is a 5000 sq. degree survey in the southernhemisphere, which is rapidly reducing the existing north-south asymmetry in thecensus of mw satellites and other stellar substructure. we use the first-yeardes data down to previously unprobed photometric depths to search for stellarsystems in the galactic halo, therefore complementing the previous analysis ofthe same data carried out by our group earlier this year. our search is basedon a matched filter algorithm that produces stellar density maps consistentwith stellar population models of various ages, metallicities, and distancesover the survey area. the most conspicuous density peaks in these maps havebeen identified automatically and ranked according to their significance andrecurrence for different input models. we report the discovery of oneadditional stellar system besides those previously found by several authorsusing the same first-year des data. the object is compact, and consistent withbeing dominated by an old and metal-poor population. des j0034-4902 is found athigh significance and appears in the des images as a compact concentration offaint blue point sources at ~ 87 {kpc}. its half-light radius of r_h = 9.88 +/-4.31 {pc} and total luminosity of m_v ~ -3.05_{-0.42}^{+0.69} are consistentwith it being a low mass halo cluster. it is also found to have a veryelongated shape. in addition, our deeper probe of des 1st year data confirmsthe recently reported satellite galaxy candidate horologium ii as a significantstellar overdensity. we also infer its structural properties and compare themto those reported in the literature.

1508.03622	eight ultra-faint galaxy candidates discovered in year two of the dark  energy survey	we report the discovery of eight new ultra-faint dwarf galaxy candidates inthe second year of optical imaging data from the dark energy survey (des). sixof these candidates are detected at high confidence, while two lower-confidencecandidates are identified in regions of non-uniform survey coverage. the newstellar systems are found by three independent automated search techniques andare identified as overdensities of stars, consistent with the isochrone andluminosity function of an old and metal-poor simple stellar population. the newsystems are faint (mv &gt; -4.7 mag) and span a range of physical sizes (17 pc &lt;$r_{1/2}$ &lt; 181 pc) and heliocentric distances (25 kpc &lt; d &lt; 214 kpc). all ofthe new systems have central surface brightnesses consistent with knownultra-faint dwarf galaxies (\mu &lt; 27.5 mag arcsec$^{-2}$). roughly half of thedes candidates are more distant, less luminous, and/or have lower surfacebrightnesses than previously known milky way satellite galaxies. most of thecandidates are found in the southern part of the des footprint close to themagellanic clouds. we find that the des data alone exclude (p &lt; 0.001) aspatially isotropic distribution of milky way satellites and that the observeddistribution can be well, though not uniquely, described by an associationbetween several of the des satellites and the magellanic system. our modelpredicts that the full sky may hold ~100 ultra-faint galaxies with physicalproperties comparable to the des satellites and that 20-30% of these would bespatially associated with the magellanic clouds.

1509.07121	photometric redshifts and clustering of emission line galaxies selected  jointly by des and eboss	we present the results of the first test plates of the extended baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey. this paper focuses on the emission linegalaxies (elg) population targetted from the dark energy survey (des)photometry. we analyse the success rate, efficiency, redshift distribution, andclustering properties of the targets. from the 9000 spectroscopic redshiftstargetted, 4600 have been selected from the des photometry. the total successrate for redshifts between 0.6 and 1.2 is 71\% and 68\% respectively for abright and faint, on average more distant, samples including redshifts measuredfrom a single strong emission line. we find a mean redshift of 0.8 and 0.87,with 15 and 13\% of unknown redshifts respectively for the bright and faintsamples. in the redshift range 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.2, for the most secure spectroscopicredshifts, the mean redshift for the bright and faint sample is 0.85 and 0.9respectively. star contamination is lower than 2\%. we measure a galaxy biasaveraged on scales of 1 and 10~mpc/h of 1.72 \pm 0.1 for the bright sample andof 1.78 \pm 0.12 for the faint sample. the error on the galaxy bias have beenobtained propagating the errors in the correlation function to the fittedparameters. this redshift evolution for the galaxy bias is in agreement withtheoretical expectations for a galaxy population with mb-5\log h &lt; -21.0. wenote that biasing is derived from the galaxy clustering relative to a model forthe mass fluctuations. we investigate the quality of the des photometricredshifts and find that the outlier fraction can be reduced using a comparisonbetween template fitting and neural network, or using a random forestalgorithm.

1512.01032	physical properties of star clusters in the outer lmc as observed by the  dark energy survey	the large magellanic cloud (lmc) harbors a rich and diverse system of starclusters, whose ages, chemical abundances, and positions provide informationabout the lmc history of star formation. we use science verification imagingdata from the dark energy survey to increase the census of known star clustersin the outer lmc and to derive physical parameters for a large sample of suchobjects using a spatially and photometrically homogeneous data set. our samplecontains 255 visually identified cluster candidates, of which 109 were notlisted in any previous catalog. we quantify the crowding effect for the stellarsample produced by the des data management pipeline and conclude that thestellar completeness is &lt; 10% inside typical lmc cluster cores. we thereforedevelop a pipeline to sample and measure stellar magnitudes and positionsaround the cluster candidates using daophot. we also implement amaximum-likelihood method to fit individual density profiles andcolour-magnitude diagrams. for 117 (from a total of 255) of the clustercandidates (28 uncatalogued clusters), we obtain reliable ages, metallicities,distance moduli and structural parameters, confirming their nature as physicalsystems. the distribution of cluster metallicities shows a radial dependence,with no clusters more metal-rich than [fe/h] ~ -0.7 beyond 8 kpc from the lmccenter. the age distribution has two peaks at ~ 1.2 gyr and ~ 2.7 gyr.

1512.04535	cross-correlation of gravitational lensing from des science verification  data with spt and planck lensing	we measure the cross-correlation between weak lensing of galaxy images and ofthe cosmic microwave background (cmb). the effects of gravitational lensing ondifferent sources will be correlated if the lensing is caused by the same massfluctuations. we use galaxy shape measurements from 139 deg$^{2}$ of the darkenergy survey (des) science verification data and overlapping cmb lensing fromthe south pole telescope (spt) and planck. the des source galaxies have amedian redshift of $z_{\rm med} {\sim} 0.7$, while the cmb lensing kernel isbroad and peaks at $z{\sim}2$. the resulting cross-correlation is maximallysensitive to mass fluctuations at $z{\sim}0.44$. assuming the planck 2015best-fit cosmology, the amplitude of the des$\times$spt cross-power is found tobe $a = 0.88 \pm 0.30$ and that from des$\times$planck to be $a = 0.86 \pm0.39$, where $a=1$ corresponds to the theoretical prediction. these areconsistent with the expected signal and correspond to significances of $2.9\sigma$ and $2.2 \sigma$ respectively. we demonstrate that our results arerobust to a number of important systematic effects including the shearmeasurement method, estimator choice, photometric redshift uncertainty and cmblensing systematics. significant intrinsic alignment of galaxy shapes wouldincrease the cross-correlation signal inferred from the data; we calculate avalue of $a = 1.08 \pm 0.36$ for des$\times$spt when we correct theobservations with a simple ia model. with three measurements of thiscross-correlation now existing in the literature, there is not yet reliableevidence for any deviation from the expected lcdm level of cross-correlation,given the size of the statistical uncertainties and the significant impact ofsystematic errors, particularly ias. we provide forecasts for the expectedsignal-to-noise of the combination of the five-year des survey and spt-3g.

astro-ph;0105500	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: luminosity dependence of galaxy  clustering	we investigate the dependence of the strength of galaxy clustering onintrinsic luminosity using the anglo-australian two degree field galaxyredshift survey (2dfgrs). the 2dfgrs is over an order of magnitude larger thanprevious redshift surveys used to address this issue. we measure the projectedtwo-point correlation function of galaxies in a series of volume-limitedsamples. the projected correlation function is free from any distortion of theclustering pattern induced by peculiar motions and is well described by apower-law in pair separation over the range 0.1 &lt; r /h mpc &lt; 10. the clusteringof l* galaxies in real space is well fit by a correlation length r0 = 4.9 +/-0.3 /h mpc and power-law slope gamma = 1.71 +/- 0.06. the clustering amplitudeincreases slowly with absolute magnitude for galaxies fainter than m*, butrises more strongly at higher luminosities. at low luminosities, our resultsagree with measurements from the ssrs2 by benoist et al. however, we find aweaker dependence of clustering strength on luminosity at the highestluminosities. the correlation function amplitude increases by a factor of 4.0between $m_{b_{j}} -5\log_{10}h = -18$ and -22.5, and the most luminousgalaxies are 3.0 times more strongly clustered than l* galaxies. the power-lawslope of the correlation function shows remarkably little variation for samplesspanning a factor of 20 in luminosity. our measurements are in very goodagreement with the predictions of the hierarchical galaxy formation models ofbenson et al.

astro-ph;0106430	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: the population of nearby radio galaxies  at the 1 mjy level	we use redshift determinations and spectral analysis of galaxies in the 2dfgalaxy redshift survey to study the properties of local radio sources with$s\ge 1$ mjy. 557 objects drawn from the first survey, corresponding to 2.3 percent of the total radio sample, are found in the 2dfgrs cataloge within thearea $9^h 48^m \simlt {\rm ra}({\rm 2000}) \simlt 14^h 32^m$ and $-2.77^\circ\simlt {\rm dec}({\rm 2000}) \simlt 2.25^\circ$, down to a magnitude limit$b_j= 19.45$. the excellent quality of 2df spectra allows us to divide thesesources into classes, according to their optical spectra. radio galaxies (i.e.absorption systems, mainly belonging to the class of fr i sources, whosespectra may or may not show emission lines due to agn activity) make up 63 percent of the spectroscopic sample; they are characterized by relatively highradio-to-optical ratios, red colours and luminosities $10^{21}\simlt p_{1.4{\rmghz}} w hz^${-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ \simlt 10^{24}$. actively star-forming galaxiesinstead contribute with 30 per cent to the total sample. these objects --principally found at low redshifts ($z \simlt 0.1$) -- in general show lowradio-to-optical ratios, blue colours and low radio luminosities. we also found18 seyfert 2 galaxies and 4 seyfert 1's. analysis of the local radio luminosityfunction shows that radio galaxies are well described by models that assumepure luminosity evolution, at least down to radio powers $p_{1.4{\rmghz}}\simlt 10^{20.5} w hz$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ late-type galaxies, whose relativecontribution to the rlf is found to be lower than was predicted by previouswork, present a luminosity function which is compatible with the iras galaxylf, and therefore plausibly constitute the radio counterpart of the dustyspirals and starbursts that dominate the counts at 60 $\mu$m.

astro-ph;0108170	the las campanas ir survey: early type galaxy progenitors beyond  redshift one	(abridged) we have identified a population of faint red galaxies from a 0.62square degree region of the las campanas infrared survey whose properties areconsistent with their being the progenitors of early-type galaxies. the opticaland ir colors, number-magnitude relation and angular clustering togetherindicate modest evolution and increased star formation rates among theearly-type field population at redshifts between one and two. the counts of redgalaxies with $h$ magnitudes between 17 and 20 rise with a slope that is muchsteeper than that of the total h sample. the surface density of red galaxiesdrops from roughly 3000 per square degree at h = 20.5, i-h &gt; 3 to ~ 20 persquare degree at h = 20, i-h &gt; 5. the v-i colors are approximately 1.5magnitudes bluer on average than a pure old population and span a range of morethan three magnitudes. the colors, and photometric redshifts derived from them,indicate that the red galaxies have redshift distributions adequately describedby gaussians with sigma_z ~ 0.2$ centered near redshift one, with the exceptionthat galaxies having $v-i&lt;1.6$ and $i-h&gt;3$ are primarily in the 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2range. we find co-moving correlation lengths of 9-10 mpc at z ~ 1, comparableto, or larger than, those found for early-type galaxies at lower redshifts. asimple photometric evolution model reproduces the counts of the red galaxies,with only a ~ 30% decline in the underlying space density of early-typegalaxies at z ~ 1.2. we suggest on the basis of the colors, counts, andclustering that these red galaxies are the bulk of the progenitors of presentday early-type galaxies.

astro-ph;0110676	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: constraints on cosmic star-formation  history from the cosmic spectrum	we present the first results on the history of star formation in the universebased on the `cosmic spectrum', in particular, the volume-averaged,luminosity-weighted, stellar absorption line spectrum of present day galaxiesfrom the 2dfgrs. this method is novel in that unlike previous studies it is notan estimator based on total luminosity density. the cosmic spectrum is fittedwith models of population synthesis, tracing the history of star formationprior to the epoch of the observed galaxies, using a method we have developedwhich decouples continuum and spectral-line variations and is robust againstspectrophotometric uncertainties. the cosmic spectrum can only be fitted withmodels incorporating chemical evolution and indicates there was a peak ofstar-formation rate in the past of at least three times the current value andthat the increase back to z=1, assuming it scales as (1+z)^beta, has a strongupper limit of beta&lt;5. we find in the general case there is some modeldegeneracy between star formation at low and high redshift. however, if weincorporate previous work on star formation at z&lt;1 we can put strong upperlimits on the sfr at z&gt;1: e.g., if beta&gt;2 then the sfr for 1&lt;z&lt;5 scales as(1+z)^alpha with alpha&lt;2. this is equivalent to stating that no more than 80%of stars in the universe formed at z&gt;1. our results are consistent with thebest-fit results from compilations of cosmic sfr estimates based on uvluminosity density, which give 1.8&lt;beta&lt;2.9 and -1.0&lt;alpha&lt;0.7, and are alsoconsistent with estimates of omega_stars based on the k-band luminositydensity.

astro-ph;0112043	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: the dependence of galaxy clustering on  luminosity and spectral type	we investigate the dependence of galaxy clustering on luminosity and spectraltype using the 2df galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs). spectral types are assignedusing the principal component analysis of madgwick et al. we divide the sampleinto two broad spectral classes: galaxies with strong emission lines(`late-types'), and more quiescent galaxies (`early-types'). we measure theclustering in real space, free from any distortion of the clustering patterndue to peculiar velocities, for a series of volume-limited samples. theprojected correlation functions of both spectral types are well described by apower law for transverse separations in the range 2 &lt; (sigma/mpc/h) &lt; 15, witha marginally steeper slope for early-types than late-types. both early and latetypes have approximately the same dependence of clustering strength onluminosity, with the clustering amplitude increasing by a factor of ~2.5between l* and 4 l*. at all luminosities, however, the correlation functionamplitude for the early-types is ~50% higher than that of the late-types. theseresults support the view that luminosity, and not type, is the dominant factorin determining how the clustering strength of the whole galaxy populationvaries with luminosity.

astro-ph;0112161	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: the bias of galaxies and the density of  the universe	we compute the bispectrum of the 2df galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) and useit to measure the bias parameter of the galaxies. this parameter quantifies thestrength of clustering of the galaxies relative to the mass in the universe. byanalysing 80 million triangle configurations in the wavenumber range 0.1 &lt; k &lt;0.5 h/mpc (i.e. on scales roughly between 5 and 30 mpc/h) we find that thelinear bias parameter is consistent with unity: b_1=1.04 pm 0.11, and thequadratic (nonlinear) bias is consistent with zero: b_2=-0.054 pm 0.08. thus,at least on large scales, optically-selected galaxies do indeed trace theunderlying mass distribution. the bias parameter can be combined with the2dfgrs measurement of the redshift distortion parameter beta =omega_m^{0.6}/b_1, to yield omega_m = 0.27 pm 0.06 for the matter density ofthe universe, a result which is determined entirely from this survey,independently of other datasets. our measurement of the matter density of theuniverse should be interpreted as omega_m at the effective redshift of thesurvey (z=0.17).

astro-ph;0212375	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: correlation functions, peculiar  velocities and the matter density of the universe	we present a detailed analysis of the two-point correlation function, fromthe 2df galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs). we estimate the redshift-spacecorrelation function, xi(s), from which we measure the redshift-spaceclustering length, s_0=6.82+/-0.28 mpc/h. we also estimate the projectedcorrelation function, xi(sigma), and the real-space correlation function,xi(r), which can be fit by a power-law, with r_0=5.05+/-0.26mpc/h,gamma_r=1.67+/-0.03. for r&gt;20mpc/h, xi drops below a power-law as is expectedin the popular lcdm model. the ratio of amplitudes of the real andredshift-space correlation functions on scales of 8-30mpc/h gives an estimateof the redshift-space distortion parameter beta. the quadrupole moment of xi onscales 30-40mpc/h provides another estimate of beta. we also estimate thedistribution function of pairwise peculiar velocities, f(v), includingrigorously the effect of infall velocities, and find that it is well fit by anexponential. the accuracy of our xi measurement is sufficient to constrain amodel, which simultaneously fits the shape and amplitude of xi(r) and the tworedshift-space distortion effects parameterized by beta and velocitydispersion, a. we find beta=0.49+/-0.09 and a=506+/-52km/s, though the best fitvalues are strongly correlated. we measure the variation of the peculiarvelocity dispersion with projected separation, a(sigma), and find that theshape is consistent with models and simulations. using the constraints on biasfrom recent estimates, and taking account of redshift evolution, we concludethat beta(l=l*,z=0)=0.47+/-0.08, and that the present day matter density of theuniverse is 0.3, consistent with other 2dfgrs estimates and independentanalyses.

astro-ph;0303668	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: galaxy clustering per spectral type	we have calculated the two-point correlation functions in redshift space,xi(sigma,pi), for galaxies of different spectral types in the 2df galaxyredshift survey. using these correlation functions we are able to estimatevalues of the linear redshift-space distortion parameter, beta = omega_m^0.6/b,the pairwise velocity dispersion, a, and the real-space correlation function,xi(r), for galaxies with both relatively low star-formation rates (for whichthe present rate of star formation is less than 10% of its past averaged value)and galaxies with higher current star-formation activity. at small separations,the real-space clustering of passive galaxies is very much stronger than thatof the more actively star-forming galaxies; the correlation-function slopes arerespectively 1.93 and 1.50, and the relative bias between the two classes is adeclining function of radius. on scales larger than 10 h^-1 mpc there isevidence that the relative bias tends to a constant, b(passive)/b(active) ~ 1.this result is consistent with the similar degrees of redshift-spacedistortions seen in the correlation functions of the two classes -- thecontours of xi(sigma,pi) require beta(active)=0.49+/-0.13, andbeta(passive)=0.48+/-0.14. the pairwise velocity dispersion is highlycorrelated with beta. however, despite this a significant difference is seenbetween the two classes. over the range 8-20 h^-1 mpc, the pairwise velocitydispersion has mean values 416+/-76 km/s and 612+/-92 km/s for the active andpassive galaxy samples respectively. this is consistent with the expectationfrom morphological segregation, in which passively evolving galaxiespreferentially inhabit the cores of high-mass virialised regions.

astro-ph;0401405	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: hierarchical galaxy clustering	we use the two-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) to test thehierarchical scaling hypothesis: namely, that the $p$-point galaxy correlationfunctions can be written in terms of the two point correlation function orvariance. this scaling is expected if an initially gaussian distribution ofdensity fluctuations evolves under the action of gravitational instability. wemeasure the volume averaged $p$-point correlation functions using a counts incells technique applied to a volume limited sample of 44,931 $l_*$ galaxies. wedemonstrate that $l_{*}$ galaxies display hierarchical clustering up to order$p=6$ in redshift space. the variance measured for $l_{*}$ galaxies is inexcellent agreement with the predictions from a $\lambda$-cold dark mattern-body simulation. this applies to all cell radii considered,$0.3&lt;(r/h^{-1}{\rm mpc})&lt;30$. however, the higher order correlation functionsof $l_*$ galaxies have a significantly smaller amplitude than is predicted forthe dark matter for $r&lt;10h^{-1}$mpc. this disagreement implies that anon-linear bias exists between the dark matter and $l_*$ galaxies on thesescales. we also show that the presence of two rare, massive superclusters inthe 2dfgrs has an impact on the higher-order clustering moments measured onlarge scales.

astro-ph;0402566	galaxy groups in the 2dfgrs: the luminous content of the groups	the 2dfgrs percolation-inferred galaxy group (2pigg) catalogue of ~29000objects is used to study the luminous content of galaxy systems of varioussizes. mock galaxy catalogues constructed from cosmological simulations areused to gauge the accuracy with which intrinsic group properties can berecovered. a schechter function is found to be a reasonable fit to the galaxyluminosity functions in groups of different mass in the real data. thecharacteristic luminosity l* is larger for more massive groups. however, themock data show that the shape of the recovered luminosity function is expectedto differ from the true shape, and this must be allowed for when interpretingthe data. the variation of halo mass-to-light ratio with group size is studiedin both these wavebands. a robust trend of increasing m/l with increasing groupluminosity is found in the 2pigg data. from groups with l_bj=10^{10}lsol tothose 100 times more luminous, the typical bj-band m/l increases by a factor of5, whereas the rf-band m/l grows by a factor of 3.5. these trends agree wellwith the simulations, which also predict a minimum m/l on a scale correspondingto the local group. our data indicate that if such a minimum exists, then itmust occur at l&lt;~10^{10}lsol, below the range accurately probed by the 2piggcatalogue. according to the mock data, the bj m/ls of the largest groups areexpected to be approximately 1.1 times the global value. assuming that thiscorrection applies to the real data yields an estimate of omega_m=0.26+/-0.03(statistical).

astro-ph;0404276	the nature of the relative bias between galaxies of different spectral  type in 2dfgrs	we present an analysis of the relative bias between early- and late-typegalaxies in the two-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs). our analysisexamines the joint counts in cells between early- and late-type galaxies, usingapproximately cubical cells with sides ranging from 7h^{-1}mpc to 42h^{-1}mpc.we measure the variance of the counts in cells using the method of efstathiouet al. (1990), which we find requires a correction for a finite volume effect.we fit lognormal models to the one-point density distribution and developmethods of dealing with biases in the recovered variances resulting from thistechnique. we directly fit deterministic models for the joint densitydistribution function, f(delta_e,delta_l), to the joint counts in cells using amaximum likelihood technique. our results are consistent with a scale invariantrelative bias factor on all scales studied. linear bias is ruled out on scalesless than l=28h^{-1}mpc. a power-law bias model is a significantly better fitto the data on all but the largest scales studied; the relative goodness of fitof this model as compared to that of the linear bias model suggests that anynonlinearity is negligible for l&gt;~40h^{-1}mpc, consistent with the expectationfrom theory that the bias should become linear on large scales.

astro-ph;0407537	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: luminosity functions by density  environment and galaxy type	we use the 2df galaxy redshift survey to measure the dependence of thebj-band galaxy luminosity function on large-scale environment, defined bydensity contrast in spheres of radius 8h-1mpc, and on spectral type, determinedfrom principal component analysis. we find that the galaxy populations at bothextremes of density differ significantly from that at the mean density. thepopulation in voids is dominated by late types and shows, relative to the mean,a deficit of galaxies that becomes increasingly pronounced at magnitudesbrighter than m_bj-5log10h &lt;-18.5. in contrast, cluster regions have a relativeexcess of very bright early-type galaxies with m_bj-5log10h &lt; -21. differencesin the mid to faint-end population between environments are significant: atm_bj-5log10h=-18 early and late-type cluster galaxies show comparableabundances, whereas in voids the late types dominate by almost an order ofmagnitude. we find that the luminosity functions measured in all densityenvironments, from voids to clusters, can be approximated by schechterfunctions with parameters that vary smoothly with local density, but in afashion which differs strikingly for early and late-type galaxies. theseobserved variations, combined with our finding that the faint-end slope of theoverall luminosity function depends at most weakly on density environment, mayprove to be a significant challenge for models of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0501174	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: power-spectrum analysis of the final  dataset and cosmological implications	we present a power spectrum analysis of the final 2df galaxy redshift survey,employing a direct fourier method. the sample used comprises 221,414 galaxieswith measured redshifts. we investigate in detail the modelling of the sampleselection. a new angular mask is derived, based on revisions to the photometriccalibration. the redshift selection function is determined by dividing thesurvey according to rest-frame colour, and deducing a self-consistent treatmentof k-corrections and evolution for each population. the covariance matrix forthe power-spectrum estimates is determined using two different approaches tothe construction of mock surveys which are used to demonstrate that the inputcosmological model can be correctly recovered. we are confident that the 2dfgrspower spectrum can be used to infer the matter content of the universe. onlarge scales, our estimated power spectrum shows evidence for the `baryonoscillations' that are predicted in cdm models. fitting to a cdm model,assuming a primordial $n_{s}=1$ spectrum, $h=0.72$ and negligible neutrinomass, the preferred parameters are $\omega_{m} h = 0.168 \pm 0.016$ and abaryon fraction $\omega_{b} /\omega_{m} = 0.185\pm0.046$ (1$\sigma$ errors).the value of $\omega_{m} h$ is $1\sigma$ lower than the $0.20 \pm 0.03$ in our2001 analysis of the partially complete 2dfgrs. this shift is largely due tothe signal from the newly-sampled regions of space, rather than the refinementsin the treatment of observational selection. this analysis therefore implies adensity significantly below the standard $\omega_{m} =0.3$: in combination withcmb data from wmap, we infer $\omega_{m} =0.231\pm 0.021$.

astro-ph;0507166	the dipole anisotropy of the 2 micron all-sky redshift survey	we estimate the acceleration on the local group (lg) from the two micron allsky redshift survey (2mrs). the sample used includes about 23,200 galaxies withextinction corrected magnitudes brighter than k_s=11.25 and it allows us tocalculate the flux weighted dipole. the near-infrared flux weighted dipoles arevery robust because they closely approximate a mass weighted dipole, bypassingthe effects of redshift distortions and require no preferred reference frame.this is combined with the redshift information to determine the change indipole with distance. the misalignment angle between the lg and the cmb dipoledrops to 12 degrees at around 50 mpc/h, but then increases at larger distances,reaching 21 degrees at around 130 mpc/h. exclusion of the galaxies maffei 1,maffei 2, dwingeloo 1, ic342 and m87 brings the resultant flux dipole to 14degrees away from the cmb velocity dipole in both cases, the dipole seeminglyconverges by 60 mpc/h. assuming convergence, the comparison of the 2mrs fluxdipole and the cmb dipole provides a value for the combination of the massdensity and luminosity bias parameters omega_m^0.6/b_l=0.40+/-0.09.

astro-ph;0511753	a principal component analysis approach to the star formation history of  elliptical galaxies in compact groups	(abridged) environmental differences in the stellar populations of early-typegalaxies are explored using principal component analysis (pca), focusing ondifferences between elliptical galaxies in hickson compact groups (hcgs) and inthe field. the method is model-independent and relies on variations between theobserved spectra. the projections (pc1,pc2) reveal a difference with respect toenvironment, with a wider range in pc1 and pc2 in the group sample. we define aspectral parameter (zeta=0.36pc1-pc2) which simplifies this result to a singlenumber: field galaxies have a very similar value of zeta, whereas hcg galaxiesspan a wide range in this parameter. we obtain a strong correlation between thevalues of zeta and the mass fraction in younger stars, so that some groupgalaxies present a higher fraction of them. pca is more sensitive than othermethods based on a direct analysis of observables such as the structure of thesurface brightness profile or the equivalent width of absorption lines. thelatter do not reveal any significant variation between field and compact groupgalaxies. our results imply that the presence of young stars only amounts to afraction of a percent in its contribution to the total variance.

astro-ph;0611456	principal component analysis as a tool to explore star formation  histories	principal component analysis (pca) is a well-known multivariate techniqueused to decorrelate a set of vectors. pca has been extensively applied in thepast to the classification of stellar and galaxy spectra. here we apply pca tothe optical spectra of early-type galaxies, with the aim of extractinginformation about their star formation history. we consider two different datasets: 1) a reduced sample of 30 elliptical galaxies in hickson compact groupsand in the field, and 2) a large volume-limited (z&lt;0.1) sample of ~7,000galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey. even though these data sets arevery different, the homogeneity of the populations results in a very similarset of principal components. furthermore, most of the information (in the senseof variance) is stored into the first few components in both samples. the firstcomponent (pc1) can be interpreted as an old population and carries over 99% ofthe variance. the second component (pc2) is related to young stars and we finda correlation with nuv flux from galex. model fits consistently give youngerages for those galaxies with higher values of pc2.

astro-ph;9311059	wiener reconstruction of galaxy surveys in spherical harmonics	the analysis of whole-sky galaxy surveys commonly suffers from the problemsof shot-noise and incomplete sky coverage (e.g. at the zone of avoidance). theorthogonal set of spherical harmonics is utilized here to expand the observedgalaxy distribution. we show that in the framework of bayesian statistics andgaussian random fields the $4 \pi$ harmonics can be recovered and theshot-noise can be removed, giving the most probable picture of the underlyingdensity field. the correction factor from observed to reconstructed harmonicsturns out to be the well-known wiener filter (the ratio of signal tosignal+noise), which is also derived by requiring minimum variance. we applythe method to the projected 1.2 jy iras survey. the reconstruction confirms theconnectivity of the supergalactic plane across the galactic plane (at galacticlongitude $l \sim 135^o$ and $l \sim 315^o$) and the puppis cluster behind thegalactic plane ($ l \sim 240^o$). the method can be extended to 3-d in bothreal and redshift space, and applied to other cosmic phenomena such as the cobemicrowave background maps.

astro-ph;9410080	wiener reconstruction of the large scale structure	the formalism of wiener filtering is developed here for the purpose ofreconstructing the large scale structure of the universe from noisy, sparse andincomplete data. the method is based on a linear minimum variance solution,given data and an assumed \prior model which specifies the covariance matrix ofthe field to be reconstructed. while earlier applications of the wiener filterhave focused on estimation, namely suppressing the noise in the measuredquantities, we extend the method here to perform both prediction and dynamicalreconstruction. the wiener filter is used to predict the values of unmeasuredquantities, such as the density field in un-sampled regions of space, or todeconvolve blurred data. the method is developed, within the context of lineargravitational instability theory, to perform dynamical reconstruction of onefield which is dynamically related to some other observed field. this is thecase, for example, in the reconstruction of the real space galaxy distributionfrom its redshift distribution when the field to be reconstructed is a gaussianrandom field, such as the primordial perturbation field predicted by thecanonical model of cosmology, the wiener filter can be pushed to its fullestpotential. in such a case the wiener estimator coincides with the bayesianestimator designed to maximize the {\it posterior} probability. the wienerfilter can be also derived by assuming a quadratic regularization function, inanalogy with the `maximum entropy' method. the mean field obtained by theminimal variance solution can be supplemented with constrained realizations ofthe gaussian field to

(iii) supervised ann (using the backpropagation or quasi-newtonalgorithms) based on a training set for which the human classification isknown. here the output for previously unclassified galaxies can be interpretedas either a continuous (analog) output (e.g. $t$-type) or a bayesian {\it aposteriori} probability for each class. although the eso-lv parameters aresub-optimal, the success of the ann in reproducing the human classification is2 $t$-type units, similar to the degree of agreement between two human expertswho classify the same galaxy images on plate material. we also examine theaspects of ann configurations, reproducibility, scaling of input parameters andredshift information.

astro-ph;9612190	the correlation function of radio sources	we investigate the large-scale clustering of radio sources in the green bankand parkes-mit-nrao 4.85 ghz surveys by measuring the angular two-pointcorrelation function w(\theta). excluding contaminated areas, the two surveystogether cover 70 per cent of the whole sky. we find both surveys to bereasonably complete above 50 mjy. on the basis of previous studies, the radiosources are galaxies and radio-loud quasars lying at redshifts up to z \sim 4,with a median redshift z \sim 1. this provides the opportunity to probelarge-scale structures in a volume far larger than that within the reach ofpresent optical and infrared surveys. we detect a clustering signal w(\theta)\approx 0.01 for \theta = 1\degr. by assuming an evolving power-law spatialcorrelation function in comoving coordinates \xi(r_c,z) = ( r_c / r_0)^{-\gamma} (1+z)^{\gamma-(3+\epsilon)}, where \gamma = 1.8, and the redshiftdistribution n(z) of the radio galaxies, we constrain the r_0--\epsilonparameter space. for `stable clustering' (\epsilon = 0), we find thecorrelation length r_0 \approx 18 mpc/h, larger than the value for nearbynormal galaxies and comparable to the cluster-cluster correlation length.

astro-ph;9806342	constraints on the clustering, biasing and redshift distribution of  radio sources	we discuss how different theoretical predictions for the variance $\sigma^2$of the distribution of radio sources can be matched to measurements from thefirst survey at different flux limits. the predictions are given by theintegration of models for the angular correlation function $w(\theta)$ forthree different functional forms of the redshift distribution $n(z)$, differentspatial correlation functions and by different evolutions of the bias $b(z)$with redshift. we also consider the two cases of open and flat universes.although the predicted $w(\theta)$ show substantial differences due todifferences in the $n(z)$'s, these differences are not significant compared tothe uncertainties in the current observations. it turns out that the best fitis provided by models with constant biasing at all times, although thedifference between models with epoch-independent bias and models with bias thatevolves linearly with redshift is not very large. all models with strongevolution of bias with epoch are ruled out. as a further step we directlycalculated $w_{obs}(\theta)$ at 3mjy from the catalogue and matched it with ourmodels for the angular correlation function in the hypothesis that theclustering signal comes from two different populations, namely agn-poweredsources and starbursting galaxies. the results are consistent with a scenariofor hierarchical clustering where the fainter starbursting galaxies trace themass at all epochs, while brighter agn's are strongly biased, with $b(z)$evolving linearly with redshift, as suggested by some theories of galaxyformation and evolution.

astro-ph;9809343	the supergalactic plane revisited with the optical redshift survey	we re-examine the existence and extent of the planar structure in the localgalaxy density field, the so-called supergalactic plane (sgp). this structureis studied here in three dimensions using both the new optical redshift survey(ors) and the iras 1.2 jy redshift survey. the density contrast in a slab ofthickness of 20 mpc/h and diameter of 80 mpc/h aligned with the standard devaucouleurs' supergalactic coordinates, is delta_sgp =0.5 for both ors andiras. the structure of the sgp is not well described by a homogeneousellipsoid, although it does appear to be a flattened structure, which wequantify by calculating the moment of inertia tensor of the density field. thedirections of the principal axes vary with radius, but the minor axis remainswithin 30 deg of the standard sgp z-axis, out to a radius of 80 mpc/h, for bothors and \iras. however, the structure changes shape with radius, varyingbetween a flattened pancake and a dumbbell, the latter at a radius of ~50mpc/h, where the great attractor and perseus-pisces superclusters dominate thedistribution. this calls to question the connectivity of the `plane' beyond ~40mpc/h. the configuration found here can be viewed as part of a web of filamentsand sheets, rather than as an isolated pancake-like structure. an optimalminimum variance reconstruction of the density field using wiener filteringwhich corrects for both redshift distortion and shot noise, yields a similarmisalignment angle and behaviour of axes. the background-independent statisticof axes proposed here can be best used for testing cosmological models bycomparison with n-body simulations.

astro-ph;9902260	the observed evolution of galaxy clustering vs. epoch-dependent biasing  models	we study the observed evolution of galaxy clustering as a function ofredshift. we find that the clustering of galaxies decreases as we go fromobservations of the local universe to $z \sim 2$. on the other hand, clusteringof the lyman break galaxies at $z \sim 3$ is very strong, comparable to theclustering of present day galaxies. however there are three major factors totake into account while comparing clustering measurements coming from varioussurveys: the so-called ``scale-dependence'' effect, due to measurements beingmade at different scales; the ``type-selection'' effect introduced by the factthat different galaxy surveys select different populations which do not havethe same clustering amplitudes; and the malmquist bias. we correct for thefirst two effects and discuss the implications of malmquist bias on theinterpretation of the data at different $z$. then we compare the observedgalaxy clustering with models for the evolution of clustering in some fixedcosmologies. correcting for the scale-dependence effect significantly reducesthe discrepancies amongst different measurements. we interpret the observedclustering signal at high redshift as coming from objects which are highlybiased with respect to the underlying distribution of mass; this is not thecase for $z\simlt 2$ where measurements are compatible with the assumption of amuch lower biasing level which only shows a weak dependence on $z$. finally wepropose a model-independent test that can be used to place a lower limit on thedensity parameter $\omega_0$.

astro-ph;9903472	cosmological parameters from cluster abundances, cmb and iras	we combine information on cosmological parameters from cluster abundances,cmb primordial anisotropies and the iras 1.2 jy galaxy redshift survey. we takeas free parameters the present values of the total matter density of theuniverse, omega_m, the hubble parameter, h, sigma_8, and the iras biasingfactor, b_iras. we assume that the universe is spatially flat, with acosmological constant, and that structure formed from adiabatic initialfluctuations with a harrison-zel'dovich power spectrum. the nucleosynthesisvalue omega_b=0.019/h^2 is adopted. we use the full three- and four-dimensional likelihood functions for each data set and marginalise these totwo- and one- dimensional distributions in a bayesian way, integrating over theother parameters. it is shown that the three data sets are in excellentagreement, with a best fit point of omega_m= 1-omega_lambda=0.36, h=0.54,sigma_8=0.74, and b_iras=1.08. this point is within one sigma of the minimumfor each data set alone. pairs of these data sets have their degeneracies insufficiently different directions that using only two data sets at a time issufficient to place good constraints on the cosmological parameters. we showthat the results from each of the three possible pairings of the data are alsoin good agreement. finally, we combine all three data sets to obtainmarginalised 68 per cent confidence intervals of 0.30&lt;omega_m&lt;0.43,0.48&lt;h&lt;0.59, 0.69&lt;sigma_8&lt;0.79, and 1.01&lt;b_iras&lt;1.16. for the best fitparameters the cmb quadrupole is q_rms-ps=18.0 uk, gamma=0.15, omega_b=0.066and the age of the universe is 16.7 gyr.

astro-ph;9908187	the 2-10 kev xrb dipole and its cosmological implications	the hard x-ray (&gt;2 kev) emission of the local and distant universe asobserved with the heao1-a2 experiment is reconsidered in the context of largescale cosmic structure. using all-sky x-ray samples of agn and galaxy clusterswe remove the dominant local x-ray flux from within a redshift of ~ 0.02. weevaluate the dipolar and higher order harmonic structure in 4 x-ray colours.the estimated dipole anisotropy of the unresolved flux appears to be consistentwith a combination of the compton-getting effect due to the local group motion(dipole amplitude delta = 0.0042) and remaining large scale structure (0.0023&lt;~ delta &lt;~ 0.0085), in good agreement with the expectations of cold darkmatter models. the observed anisotropy does however also suggest anon-negligible galactic contribution which is more complex than current, simplemodels of &gt;2 kev galactic x-ray emission. comparison of the soft and hardcolour maps with a harmonic analysis of the 1.5 kev rosat all-sky dataqualitatively suggests that at least a third of the faint, unresolved ~ 18 degscale structure in the heao1-a2 data may be galactic in origin. however, theeffect on measured flux dipoles is small (&lt;~3%).  we derive an expression for dipole anisotropy and acceleration anddemonstrate how the dipole anisotropy of the distant x-ray frame can constrainthe amplitude of bulk motions of the universe. from observed bulk motions overa local ~ 50 mpc/h radius volume we determine 0.14 &lt;~ omega^0.6/b_x(0) &lt;~ 0.59.
