0707.2953	multiwavelength monitoring of the unusual ultraluminous supernova sn  1978k in ngc 1313 and the search for an associated gamma-ray burst	we discuss our radio (australia telescope compact array and australian longbaseline array) and x-ray (xmm-newton) monitoring observations of the unusualultraluminous supernova sn 1978k in ngc 1313 at ~25 years after the explosion.sn 1978k is a rare example of a type iin supernova that has remained brightenough to have long-term x-ray and radio observations. the observations probethe dense medium that was ejected by the progenitor star prior to itsexplosion; the star might have been a luminous blue variable. the radio imagingshows that the source remains compact, but it may be marginally resolved. theradio monitoring shows deviations from a smooth decay suggesting thatinhomogeneities are present in the radio emitting region. it appears that amajor change occurred in the mass-loss rate of the progenitor star shortlybefore the supernova event. the x-ray emission between 2000 and 2006 isconsistent with the radiation coming from two shocks. all the x-ray data can befit using the same model (with no systematic evolution or short-termvariability) but this has a surprising requirement: the x-ray emitting regionshave a very large abundance of helium. this would be consistent with the x-rayemitting shocks being located in a helium-rich layer that was ejected by theprogenitor star, or helium-rich material was ejected in the supernovaexplosion. the unusual properties of the supernova motivated a search for anassociated gamma-ray burst (grb). we show that sn 1978k was inside the ~4 sigmaerror box of grb 771029. if this association is correct, the grb wasexceptionally underluminous. however, the quality of the gamma-ray burstlocations at that time was poor, and this is likely just a chance alignment.

1002.1020	multiwavelength observations of 3c 454.3. iii. eighteen months of agile  monitoring of the "crazy diamond"	we report on 18 months of multiwavelength observations of the blazar 3c 454.3(crazy diamond) carried out in july 2007-january 2009. we show the results ofthe agile campaigns which took place on may-june 2008, july-august 2008, andoctober 2008-january 2009. during the may 2008-january 2009 period, the sourceaverage flux was highly variable, from an average gamma-ray flux f(e&gt;100mev) &gt;200e-8 ph/cm2/s in may-june 2008, to f(e&gt;100mev)~80e-8 ph/cm2/s in october2008-january 2009. the average gamma-ray spectrum between 100 mev and 1 gev canbe fit by a simple power law (gamma_grid ~ 2.0 to 2.2). only 3-sigma upperlimits can be derived in the 20-60 kev energy band with super-agile. duringjuly-august 2007 and may-june 2008, rxte measured a flux of f(3-20 kev)=8.4e-11 erg/cm2/s, and f(3-20 kev)=4.5e-11 erg/cm2/s, respectively and aconstant photon index gamma_pca=1.65. swift/xrt observations were carried outduring all agile campaigns, obtaining a f(2-10 kev)=(0.9-7.5)e-11 erg/cm2/s anda photon index gamma_xrt=1.33-2.04. bat measured an average flux of ~5 mcrab.gasp-webt monitored 3c 454.3 during the whole 2007-2008 period from the radioto the optical. a correlation analysis between the optical and the gamma-rayfluxes shows a time lag of tau=-0.4 days. an analysis of 15 ghz and 43 ghz vlbicore radio flux observations shows an increasing trend of the core radio flux,anti- correlated with the higher frequency data. the modeling seds, and thebehavior of the long-term light curves in different energy bands, allow us tocompare the jet properties during different emission states, and to study thegeometrical properties of the jet on a time-span longer than one year.

0704.0269	modeling the spectral energy distribution and variability of 3c 66a  during the webt campaign of 2003 -- 2004	the bl lac object 3c 66a was observed in an extensive multiwavelengthmonitoring campaign from july 2003 till april 2004. the spectral energydistribution (sed) was measured over the entire electromagnetic spectrum, withflux measurements from radio to x-ray frequencies and upper limits in the veryhigh energy (vhe) gamma-ray regime. here, we use a time-dependent leptonic jetmodel to reproduce the sed and optical spectral variability observed during ourmultiwavelength campaign. our model simulations could successfully reproducethe observed sed and optical light curves and predict an intrinsic cutoff valuefor the vhe gamma-ray emission at ~ 4 gev. the effect of the optical depth dueto the intergalactic infrared background radiation (iibr) on the peak of thehigh-energy component of 3c 66a was found to be negligible. also, the presenceof a broad line region (blr) in the case of 3c 66a may play an important rolein the emission of gamma-ray photons when the emission region is very close tothe central engine, but further out, the production mechanism of hard x-ray andgamma-ray photons becomes rapidly dominated by synchrotron self-comptonemission. we further discuss the possibility of an observable x-ray spectralvariability pattern. the simulated results do not predict observable hysteresispatterns in the optical or soft x-ray regimes for major flares on multi-daytime scales.

0708.2291	the webt campaign on the blazar 3c279 in 2006	the quasar 3c279 was the target of an extensive multiwavelength monitoringcampaign from january through april 2006, including an optical-ir-radiomonitoring campaign by the whole earth blazar telescope (webt) collaboration.in this paper we focus on the results of the webt campaign. the sourceexhibited substantial variability of optical flux and spectral shape, with acharacteristic time scale of a few days. the variability patterns throughoutthe optical bvri bands were very closely correlated with each other. inintriguing contrast to other (in particular, bl lac type) blazars, we find alag of shorter- behind longer-wavelength variability throughout the rvb ranges,with a time delay increasing with increasing frequency. spectral hardeningduring flares appears delayed with respect to a rising optical flux. this, incombination with the very steep ir-optical continuum spectral index of ~ 1.5 -2.0, may indicate a highly oblique magnetic field configuration near the baseof the jet. an alternative explanation through a slow (time scale of severaldays) acceleration mechanism would require an unusually low magnetic field of &lt;0.2 g, about an order of magnitude lower than inferred from previous analysesof simultaneous seds of 3c279 and other fsrqs with similar properties.

1104.3557	multiwavelength observations of the gamma-ray blazar pks 0528+134 in  quiescence	we present multiwavelength observations of the ultraluminous blazar-typeradio loud quasar pks 0528+134 in quiescence during the period july to december2009. significant flux variability on a time scale of several hours was foundin the optical regime, accompanied by a weak trend of spectral softening withincreasing flux. we suggest that this might be the signature of a contributionfrom the accretion disk at the blue end of the optical spectrum. the opticalflux is weakly polarized with rapid variations of the degree and direction ofpolarization, while the polarization of the 43 ghz radio core remains steady.optical spectropolarimetry suggests a trend of increasing degree ofpolarization with increasing wavelength, providing additional evidence for anaccretion disc contribution towards the blue end of the optical spectrum. weconstructed four seds indicating that even in the quiescent state, thebolometric luminosity of pks 0528+134 is dominated by its gamma-ray emission. aleptonic single-zone jet model produced acceptable fits to the seds withcontributions to the high-energy emission from synchrotron self-comptonradiation and comptonization of direct accretion disk emission. fit parametersclose to equipartition were obtained. the moderate variability on long timescales implies the existence of on-going particle acceleration, while theobserved optical polarization variability seems to point towards a turbulentacceleration process. turbulent particle acceleration at stationary featuresalong the jet therefore appears to be a viable possibility for the quiescentstate of pks 0528+134.

0711.2089	redshift limits of bl lacertae objects from optical spectroscopy	context: bl lacertae objects have been the targets for numerous recentmultiwavelength campaigns, continuum spectral variability studies, andtheoretical spectral and variability modeling. a meaningful interpretation ofthe results of such studies requires a reliable knowledge of the objects'redshifts; however, the redshifts for many are still unknown or uncertain.aims: therefore, we hope to determine or constrain the redshifts of six bl lacobjects with unknown or poorly known redshifts. methods: observations were madeof these objects with the mdm 2.4 m hiltner telescope. although no spectralfeatures were detected, and thus no redshifts could be measured, lower redshiftlimits were assigned to the objects based on the expected equivalent widths ofabsorption features in their host galaxies. redshifts were also estimated forsome objects by assuming the host galaxies are standard candles and using hostgalaxy apparent magnitudes taken from the literature. results: the commonlyused redshift of $z=0.102$ for 1219+285 is almost certainly wrong, while theredshifts of the other objects studied remain undetermined.

1208.5926	studies of active galactic nuclei with cta	in this paper, we review the prospects for studies of active galactic nuclei(agn) using the envisioned future cherenkov telescope array (cta). this reviewfocuses on jetted agn, which constitute the vast majority of agn detected atgamma-ray energies. future progress will be driven by the planned lower energythreshold for very high energy (vhe) gamma-ray detections to ~10 gev andimproved flux sensitivity compared to current-generation cherenkov telescopefacilities. we argue that cta will enable substantial progress on gamma-raypopulation studies by deepening existing surveys both through increased fluxsensitivity and by improving the chances of detecting a larger number oflow-frequency peaked blazars because of the lower energy threshold. moredetailed studies of the vhe gamma-ray spectral shape and variability mightfurthermore yield insight into unsolved questions concerning jet formation andcomposition, the acceleration of particles within relativistic jets, and themicrophysics of the radiation mechanisms leading to the observable high-energyemission. the broad energy range covered by cta includes energies wheregamma-rays are unaffected from absorption while propagating in theextragalactic background light (ebl), and extends to an energy regime where vhespectra are strongly distorted. this will help to reduce systematic effects inthe spectra from different instruments, leading to a more reliable ebldetermination, and hence will make it possible to constrain blazar models up tothe highest energies with less ambiguity.

1304.0605	leptonic and hadronic modeling of fermi-detected blazars	we describe new implementations of leptonic and hadronic models for thebroadband emission from relativistic jets in agn in a temporary steady state.for the leptonic model, a temporary equilibrium between particleinjection/acceleration, radiative cooling, and escape from a spherical emissionregion is evaluated, and the self-consistent radiative output is calculated.for the hadronic model, a temporary equilibrium between particleinjection/acceleration, radiative and adiabatic cooling, and escape isevaluated for both primary electrons and protons. a new, semi-analytical methodto evaluate the radiative output from cascades initiated by internalgamma-gamma pair production is presented. we use our codes to fit snap-shotspectral energy distributions of a representative set of fermi-lat detectedblazars. we find that the leptonic model provides acceptable fits to the sedsof almost all blazars with parameters close to equipartition between themagnetic field and the relativistic electron population. however, the hardgamma-ray spectrum of ao 0235+164, in contrast to the very steep ir-optical-uvcontinuum, poses a severe problem for the leptonic model. if charge neutralityin leptonic models is provided by cold protons, the kinetic energy carried bythe jet should be dominated by protons. we find satisfactory representations ofthe snapshot seds of most blazars in our sample with the hadronic modelpresented here. however, in the case of two quasars the characteristic break ata few gev energies can not be well modelled. all of our hadronic model fitsrequire powers in relativistic protons in the range l_p ~ 1e47 - 1e49 erg/s.

1504.03020	short timescale photometric and polarimetric behavior of two bl lacertae  type objects	blazars are astrophysical sources whose emission is dominated by non-thermalprocesses, typically interpreted as synchrotron and inverse compton emission.although the general picture is rather robust and consistent with observations,many aspects are still unexplored. polarimetric monitoring can offer a wealthof information about the physical processes in blazars. models with largelydifferent physical ingredients can often provide almost indistinguishablepredictions for the total flux, but usually are characterized by markedlydifferent polarization properties. we explore, with a pilot study, thepossibility to derive structural information about the emitting regions ofblazars by means of a joint analysis of rapid variability of the total andpolarized flux at optical wavelengths. short timescale (from tens of seconds toa couple of minutes) optical linear polarimetry and photometry for two blazars,bl lacertae and pks 1424+240, was carried out with the paolo polarimeter at the3.6m telescopio nazionale galileo. several hours of almost continuousobservations were obtained for both sources. our intense monitoring allowed usto draw strongly different scenarios for bl lacertae and pks 1424+240, with theformer characterized by intense variability on time-scales from hours to a fewminutes and the latter practically constant in total flux. essentially the samebehavior is observed for the polarized flux and the position angle. thevariability time-scales turned out to be as short as a few minutes, althoughinvolving only a few percent variation of the flux. the polarizationvariability time-scale is generally consistent with the total flux variability.total and polarized flux appear to be essentially uncorrelated. however, evenduring our relatively short monitoring, different regimes can be singled out.(abridged)

astro-ph;0107217	pair production and radiation effects in clouds illuminated by gamma ray  sources	many classes of gamma-ray sources, such as gamma-ray bursts, blazars, seyfertgalaxies, and galactic black hole sources are surrounded by large amounts ofgas and dust. x-rays and gamma-rays that traverse this material will beattenuated by compton scattering and photoelectric absorption. one signature ofan intervening scattering cloud is radiation-hardening by electrons that havebeen scattered and heated by the incident radiation, as illustrated by a montecarlo calculation. compton scattering provides backscattered photons that willattenuate subsequent gamma rays through \gamma\gamma pair-production processes.we calculate the pair efficiency for a cloud illuminated by gamma-ray burstradiation. an analytic calculation of the flux of x-rays and gamma rays thomsonscattered by an intervening cloud is presented. illuminated clouds near grbswill form relativistic plasmas containing large numbers of electron-positronpairs that can be detected within ~1-2 days of the explosion before expandingand dissipating. localized regions of pair annihilation radiation in the galaxycould reveal gamma-ray sources embedded in dense clouds, or sites of past grbexplosions.

astro-ph;0108446	radiation from collision-dominated relativistic pair fireballs	it is generally accepted that gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are initiated by arelativistic pair fireball, converting its internal energy into kinetic energyof a relativistically moving plasmoid and subsequently into radiation. here, weinvestigate the early stages of this evolution, after the pair fireball hasbecome optically thin to gamma-gamma pair production. we show that for a shortperiod of time, ~ 0.1 - a few seconds after the initial explosion, the pairplasmoid evolution might be dominated by collisional processes prior to theformation of a collisionless shock. we simulate these processes during theearly pair plasmoid evolution and calculate the expected radiative signatures.we show that the radiation from the collision-dominated pair plasmoid phaseresults in a short (~ a few ms) flash of thermal soft x-ray emission, followedby a transition phase of &lt; 1 s during which the fireball turns thomson thin,but its radiation remains dominated by thermal comptonization, peaking ataround e_pk ~ 100 mev - a few gev. while the very early thermal emission couldbe associated with the quasi-thermal radiation signatures found in the veryearly phases of several bright batse grbs, the predicted subsequent flash ofhigh-energy emission should be easily detectable with the glast satellite.

astro-ph;0207066	conversion of relativistic pair energy into radiation in the jets of  active galactic nuclei	it is generally accepted that relativistic jet outflows power the nonthermalemission from active galactic nuclei (agn). the composition of these jets --leptonic versus hadronic -- is still under debate. we investigate themicrophysical details of the conversion process of the kinetic energy incollimated relativistic pair outflows into radiation through interactions withthe ambient interstellar medium. viewed from the coordinate system comovingwith the pair outflow, the interstellar protons and electrons represent aproton-electron beam propagating with relativistic speed in the pair plasma. wedemonstrate that the beam excites both electrostatic and low-frequencymagnetohydrodynamic alfven-type waves via a two-stream instability in the pairbackground plasma, and we calculate the time evolution of the distributionfunctions of the beam particles and the generated plasma wave turbulence powerspectra. for standard agn jet outflow and environment parameters we show thatthe initial beam distributions of interstellar protons and electrons quicklyrelax to plateau-distributions in parallel momentum, transferring therebyone-half of the initial energy density of the beam particles to electric fieldfluctuations of the generated electrostatic turbulence. on considerably longertime scales, the plateaued interstellar electrons and protons will isotropiseby their self-generated transverse turbulence and thus be picked-up in theoutflow pair plasma. these longer time scales are also characteristic for thedevelopment of transverse hydromagnetic turbulence from the plateaued electronsand protons. this hydromagnetic turbulence upstream and downstream is crucialfor diffusive shock acceleration to operate at external or internal shocksassociated with pair outflows.

astro-ph;0403627	modeling the multiwavelength spectra and variability of bl lacertae in  2000	bl lacertae was the target of an extensive multiwavelength monitoringcampaign in the second half of 2000. in this paper, we are using leptonic andhadronic jet models to fit the observed broadband spectra and spectralvariability patterns. we start out with global spectral models. subsequently,we investigate various flaring scenarios for comparison with the observedshort-term variability. for our leptonic jet model, we find that the short-termvariability, in particular the optical and x-ray spectral variability, can bebest represented with a flaring scenario dominated by a spectral-index changeof the spectrum of ultrarelativistic electrons injected into the jet. based onthis result, a detailed model simulation, reproducing the observed optical andx-ray spectral variability and broadband sed of bl lacertae simultaneously, ispresented. our leptonic modeling results are compared to fits using thehadronic synchrotron-proton blazar (spb) model. that model can reproduce theobserved seds of bl lacertae in a scenario with muon-synchrotron dominatedhigh-energy emission. it requires a significantly higher magnetic field thanthe leptonic model (~ 40 g vs. ~ 2 g in the leptonic model) and a lower dopplerfactor associated with the bulk motion of the emission region (d ~ 8 vs. d ~ 18in the leptonic model). the hadronic model predicts a significantly larger &gt;100 gev flux than the leptonic models, well within the anticipated capabilitiesof veritas and magic.

astro-ph;0505233	neutrino emission in the hadronic synchrotron mirror model: the "orphan"  tev flare from 1es 1959+650	a challenge to standard leptonic ssc models are so-called orphan tev flares,i.e. enhanced very high energy (vhe) gamma-ray emission without anycontemporaneous x-ray flaring activity, that have recently been observed intev-blazars (e.g., 1es 1959+650). in order to explain the orphan tev flare of1es 1959+650 observed in june 2002, the co-called hadronic synchrotron mirrormodel has been developed. here, relativistic protons are proposed to exist inthe jet, and interact with reflected electron-synchrotron radiation of theprecursor ssc flare. if the reflector is located in the cloud region, timeshifts of several days are possible between the precursor and the orphan flare.the external photons, blueshifted in the comoving jet frame, are able to excitethe \delta(1232)-resonance when interacting with protons of lorentz factors\gamma'_p~10^3-10^4. the decay products of this resonance include charged pionswhich, upon decay, give rise to neutrino production during the orphan flare. inthis paper we calculate the expected neutrino emission for the june 4, 2002,orphan tev flare of 1es 1959+650. we compare our results with the recentobservations of amanda-ii of a neutrino event in spatial and temporalcoincidence with the orphan flare of this blazar. we find that the expectedneutrino signal from the hadronic synchrotron mirror model is insufficient toexplain the observed neutrino event from the direction of 1es 1959+650.

astro-ph;9809156	time-dependent photoelectric absorption, photoionization and  fluorescence line emission in gamma-ray burst environments	if gamma-ray bursts are associated with dense star-forming regions in younggalaxies, photoelectric absorption by the dense circumburster material (cbm)will occur. as the burst evolves, the surrounding material is photoionized,leading to fluorescence line emission and reduced photoelectric absorptionopacity. we have analyzed this process in detail, accounting for thetime-dependent photoelectric absorption, photoionization and fluorescence lineemission from the cbm. we find that even if grbs are hosted in densestar-forming regions, photoionization of the grb environment leads to aconstant, but very weak level of delayed fluorescence line emission ontimescales of weeks to years after the burst. a temporally evolving iron~k edgeabsorption feature can serve as diagnostic tool to reveal the density structureof the cbm and may provide an opportunity for redshift measurements. we alsoinvestigated whether photoelectric absorption could be responsible for thespectral evolution of the low-energy slopes of some bright batse $\gamma$-raybursts displaying extremely hard spectra below the peak energy, inconsistentwith the optically-thin synchrotron shock model. we find that a very strongmetal enrichment (~ 100 times solar-system abundances) in the gamma-ray burstenvironment and a rather peculiar spatial distribution of the cbm would benecessary in order to account for the observed hard spectra below a few 100 kevand their temporal evolution.

astro-ph;9901106	broadband spectral analysis of pks 0528+134: a report on six years of  egret observations	the multiwavelength spectra of pks 0528+134 during six years of observationsby egret have been analyzed using synchrotron self-compton (ssc) and externalradiation compton (erc) models. we find that a two-component model, in whichthe target photons are produced externally to the gamma-ray emitting region,but also including an ssc component, is required to suitably reproduce thespectral energy distributions of the source. our analysis indicates that thereis a trend in the observed properties of pks 0528+134, as the source goes froma gamma-ray low state to a flaring state. we observe that during the highergamma-ray states, the bulk lorentz factor of the jet increases and the erccomponent dominates the high-energy emission. our model calculations indicatethe trend that the energies of the electrons giving rise to the synchrotronpeak decreases, and the power-ratio of the gamma-ray and low energy spectralcomponents increases, as the source goes from a low to a high gamma-ray state.

astro-ph;9910472	spectral energy distributions of gamma ray bursts energized by external  shocks	sari, piran, and narayan have derived analytic formulas to model the spectrafrom gamma-ray burst blast waves that are energized by sweeping up materialfrom the surrounding medium. we extend these expressions to apply to generalradiative regimes and to include the effects of synchrotron self-absorption.electron energy losses due to the synchrotron self-compton process are alsotreated in a very approximate way. the calculated spectra are compared withdetailed numerical simulation results. we find that the spectral and temporalbreaks from the detailed numerical simulation are much smoother than theanalytic formulas imply, and that the discrepancies between the analytic andnumerical results are greatest near the breaks and endpoints of the synchrotronspectra. the expressions are most accurate (within a factor of ~ 3) in theoptical/x-ray regime during the afterglow phase, and are more accurate whenepsilon_e, the fraction of swept-up particle energy that is transferred to theelectrons, is &lt;~ 0.1. the analytic results provide at best order-of-magnitudeaccuracy in the self-absorbed radio/infrared regime, and give poor fits to theself-compton spectra due to complications from klein-nishina effects andphoton-photon opacity.

astro-ph;9912030	line emission from gamma-ray burst environments	the time and angle dependent line and continuum emission from a dense torusaround a cosmological gamma-ray burst source is simulated, taking into accountphotoionization, collisional ionization, recombination, and electron heatingand cooling due to various processes. the importance of the hydrodynamicalinteraction between the torus and the expanding blast wave is stressed. due tothe rapid deceleration of the blast wave as it interacts with the dense torus,the material in the torus will be illuminated by a drastically different photonspectrum than observable through a low-column-density line of sight, and willbe heated by the hydrodynamical interaction between the blast wave and thetorus. a model calculation to reproduce the fe k-alpha line emission observedin the x-ray afterglow of grb 970508 is presented. the results indicate that ~10^{-4} solar masses of iron must be concentrated in a region of less than10^{-3} pc. the illumination of the torus material due to the hydrodynamicinteraction of the blast wave with the torus is the dominant heating andionization mechanism leading to the formation of the iron line. these resultssuggest that misaligned grbs may be detectable as x-ray flashes with pronouncediron emission line features.

0811.0003	the optical variability of the quasar 3c~279: the signature of a  decelerating jet?	a recent optical monitoring campaign on the prominent quasar 3c279 revealed aperiod of a remarkably clean exponential decay of bvri fluxes with time, with atime constant of 12.8 d, over about 14 days. this is clearly too long to beassociated with radiative cooling. here we propose that this may be thesignature of deceleration of the synchrotron emitting jet component. we developa model analogous to the relativistic blast wave model for grbs, includingradiative energy losses and radiation drag, to simulate the deceleration of arelativistically moving plasmoid in the moderately dense agn environment.synchrotron, ssc and external compton emission are evaluated self-consistently.we show that the observed optical light curve decay can be successfullyreproduced with this model. the decelerating plasmoid model predicts a delayedx-ray flare, about 2 - 3 weeks after the onset of the quasi-exponential lightcurve decay in the optical. a robust prediction of this model, which can betested with fermi and simultaneous optical monitoring, is that the peak in thegamma-ray light curve at ~ 100 mev is expected to be delayed by a few days withrespect to the onset of the optical decay, while the vhe gamma-rays areexpected to track the optical light curve closely with a delay of at most a fewhours.

0811.0501	the webt campaign on the intermediate bl lac object 3c66a in 2007-2008	prompted by a high optical state in september 2007, the whole earth blazartelescope (webt) consortium organized an intensive optical, near-ir (jhk) andradio observing campaign on the intermediate bl lac object 3c 66a throughoutthe fall and winter of 2007 -- 2008. the source remained in a high opticalstate throughout the observing period and exhibited several bright flares ontime scales of ~ 10 days. this included an exceptional outburst aroundseptember 15 - 20, 2007, reaching a peak brightness at r ~ 13.4. our campaignrevealed microvariability with flux changes up to |dr/dt| ~ 0.02 mag/hr. ourobservations do not reveal evidence for systematic spectral variability orspectral lags. we infer a value of the magnetic field in the emission region ofb ~ 19 e_b^{2/7} \tau_h^{-6/7} d_1^{13/7} g. from the lack of systematicspectral variability, we can derive an upper limit on the doppler factor, d &lt;=28 \tau_h^{-1/8} e_b^{3/16}. this is in agreement with superluminal motionmeasurements of \beta_{app} \le 27 and argues against models with very highlorentz factors of \gamma &gt; 50, required for a one-zone ssc interpretation ofsome high-frequency-peaked bl lac objects detected at tev gamma-ray energies.
