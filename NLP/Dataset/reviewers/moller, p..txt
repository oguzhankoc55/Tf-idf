0901.3845	the building the bridge survey for z=3 ly-alpha emitting galaxies ii:  completion of the survey	(abridged). we aim at bridging the gap between absorption selected andemission selected galaxies at z~3 by probing the faint end of the luminosityfunction of star-forming galaxies at z~3. we have performed narrow-band imagingin three fields with intervening qso absorbers (a damped ly$\alpha$ absorberand two lyman-limit systems) using the vlt. we target ly-alpha at redshifts2.85, 3.15 and 3.20. we find a consistent surface density of about 10ly-alpha-emitters per square arcmin per unit redshift in all three fields downto our detection limit of about 3x10^41 ergs s^-1. the luminosity function isconsistent with what has been found by other surveys at similar redshifts.about 85% of the sources are fainter than the canonical limit of r=25.5 formost lyman-break galaxy surveys. in none of the three fields do we detect theemission counterparts of the qso absorbers. in particular we do not detect thecounterpart of the z=2.85 damped ly-alpha absorber towards q2138-4427.narrow-band surveys for ly-alpha emitters are excellent to probe the faint endof the luminosity function at z~3. there is a very high surface density of thisclass of objects. this is consistent with a very steep slope of the faint endof the luminosity function as has been inferred by other studies. this faintpopulation of galaxies is playing a central role in the early universe. thereis evidence that this population is dominating the integrated star-formationactivity, responsible for the bulk of the ionizing photons at z~3 and likelyalso responsible for the bulk of the enrichment of the intergalactic medium.

nucl-th;9704015	microscopic enhancement of heavy-element production	realistic fusion barriers are calculated in a macroscopic-microscopic modelfor several soft-fusion heavy-ion reactions leading to heavy and superheavyelements. the results obtained in such a realistic picture are very differentfrom those obtained in a purely macroscopic model. for reactions on 208:pbtargets, shell effects in the entrance channel result in fusion-barrierenergies at the touching point that are only a few mev higher than the groundstate for compound systems near z = 110. the entrance-channel fragment-shelleffects remain far inside the touching point, almost to configurations onlyslightly more elongated than the ground-state configuration, where the fusionbarrier has risen to about 10 mev above the ground-state energy. calculatedsingle-particle level diagrams show that few level crossings occur until thepeak in the fusion barrier very close to the ground-state shape is reached,which indicates that dissipation is negligible until very late in the fusionprocess. whereas the fission valley in a macroscopic picture is several tens ofmev lower in energy than is the fusion valley, we find in themacroscopic-microscopic picture that the fission valley is only about 5 mevlower than the fusion valley for soft-fusion reactions leading to compoundsystems near z = 110. these results show that no significant``extra-extra-push'' energy is needed to bring the system inside the fissionsaddle point and that the typical reaction energies for maximum cross sectionin heavy-element synthesis correspond to only a few mev above the maximum inthe fusion barrier.

1001.1099	correction of field rotator-induced flat-field systematics - a case  study using archived vlt-fors data	eso's two focal reducer and low dispersion spectrographs (fors) are theprimary optical imaging instruments for the vlt. they are not direct-imaginginstruments, as there are several optical elements in the light path. inparticular, both instruments are attached to a field rotator. obtaining trulyphotometric data with such instruments present a significant challenge. in thispaper, we investigate in detail twilight flats taken with the fors instruments.we find that a large fraction of the structure seen in these flatfields rotateswith the field rotator.  we discuss in detail the methods we use to determine the cause of thiseffect. the effect was tracked down to be caused by the linear atmosphericdispersion corrector (ladc). the results are thus of special interest fordesigners of instruments with ladcs and developers of calibration plans andpipelines for such instruments. the methods described here to find and correctit, however, are of interest also for other instruments using a field rotator.  if not properly corrected, this structure in the flatfield may degrade thephotometric accuracy of imaging observations taken with the fors instruments byadding a systematic error of up to 4% for broad band filters. we discussseveral strategies to obtain photometric images in the presence of rotatingflatfield pattern.

1011.5312	galaxy counterparts of metal-rich damped lyman-alpha absorbers - ii. a  solar-metallicity and dusty dla at z_abs=2.58	[abridged]. here, we report on the discovery of the galaxy counterpart of thez_abs=2.58 dla on the line-of-sight to the z=3.07 quasar sdssj091826.16+163609.0. the galaxy counterpart of the dla is detected in the oiii5007 and oii 3726,3729 emission lines redshifted into the nir at an impactparameter of 16 kpc. ly-alpha emission is not detected. the upper limit impliesthat ly-alpha emission from this galaxy is suppressed by more than an order ofmagnitude. the dla is amongst the most metal-rich dlas studied so far atcomparable redshifts. we find evidence for substantial depletion of refractoryelements onto dust grains. fitting the main metal line component of the dla,which is located at z_abs=2.5832 and accounts for at least 85% of the totalcolumn density of low-ionisation species, we measure metal abundances fromznii, sii, siii, crii, mnii, feii and niii of -0.12, -0.26, -0.46, -0.88,-0.92, -1.03 and -0.78, respectively. in addition, we detect absorption in thelyman and werner bands of hydrogen, which represents the first detection of h_2molecules with x-shooter. the background quasar q0918+1636 is amongst thereddest qsos at redshifts 3.02&lt;z&lt;3.12 from the sdss catalogue. its uv to nirspectrum is well fitted by a composite qso spectrum reddened by smc/lmc-likeextinction curves at z_abs=2.58 with a significant amount of extinction givenby a_v = 0.2 mag. this supports previous claims that there may be moremetal-rich dlas missing from current samples due to dust reddening of thebackground qsos. the fact that there is evidence for dust both in the centralemitting regions of the galaxy (as evidenced by the lack of ly-alpha emission)and at an impact parameter of 16 kpc (as probed by the dla) suggests that dustis widespread in this system.

1109.5200	time-of-flight mass measurements for nuclear processes in neutron star  crusts	the location of electron capture heat sources in the crust of accretingneutron stars depends on the masses of extremely neutron-rich nuclei. wepresent first results from a new implementation of the time-of-flight techniqueto measure nuclear masses of rare isotopes at the national superconductingcyclotron laboratory. the masses of 16 neutron-rich nuclei in the scandium --nickel range were determined simultaneously, improving the accuracy compared toprevious data in 12 cases. the masses of $^{61}${v}, $^{63}${cr}, $^{66}${mn},and $^{74}${ni} were measured for the first time with mass excesses of$-30.510(890)$ mev, $-35.280(650)$ mev, $-36.900(790)$ mev, and $-49.210(990)$mev, respectively. with the measurement of the $^{66}$mn mass, the locations ofthe two dominant electron capture heat sources in the outer crust of accretingneutron stars that exhibit superbursts are now experimentally constrained. wefind that the location of the $^{66}$fe$\rightarrow^{66}$mn electron capturetransition occurs significantly closer to the surface than previously assumedbecause our new experimental q-value is 2.1 mev (2.6$\sigma$) smaller thanpredicted by the frdm mass model.

1112.5055	beta-decay of nuclei around se-90. search for signatures of a n=56  sub-shell closure relevant the r-process	nuclear structure plays a significant role on the rapid neutron captureprocess (r-process) since shapes evolve with the emergence of shells andsub-shells. there was some indication in neighboring nuclei that we might findexamples of a new n=56 sub-shell, which may give rise to a doubly magic se-90nucleus. beta-decay half lives of nuclei around se-90 have been measured todetermine if this nucleus has in fact a doubly-magic character. thefragmentation of xe-136 beam at the national superconducting cyclotronlaboratory at michigan state university was used to create a cocktail of nucleiin the a=90 region. we have measured the half lives of twenty-two nuclei nearthe r-process path in the a=90 region. the half lives of as-88 and se-90 havebeen measured for the first time. the values were compared with theoreticalpredictions in the search for nuclear-deformation signatures of a n=56sub-shell, and its possible role in the emergence of a potential doubly-magicse-90. the impact of such hypothesis on the synthesis of heavy nuclei,particularly in the production of sr, y and zr elements was investigated with aweak r-process network. the new half lives agree with results obtained from astandard global qrpa model used in r-process calculations, indicating thatse-90 has a quadrupole shape incompatible with a closed n=56 sub-shell in thisregion. the impact of the measured se-90 half-life in comparison with a formertheoretical predication associated with a spherical half-life on theweak-r-process is shown to be strong.

1207.1193	optical/near-infrared selection of red qsos: evidence for steep  extinction curves towards galactic centers?	we present the results of a search for red qsos using a selection based onoptical imaging from sdss and near-infrared imaging from ukidss. for a sampleof 58 candidates 46 (79%) are confirmed to be qsos. the qsos are predominantlydust-reddened except a handul at redshifts z&gt;3.5. the dust is most likelylocated in the qso host galaxies. 4 (7%) of the candidates turned out to belate-type stars, and another 4 (7%) are compact galaxies. the remaining 4objects we could not identify. in terms of their optical spectra the qsos aresimilar to the qsos selected in the first-2mass red quasar survey except theyare on average fainter, more distant and only two are detected in the firstsurvey. we estimate the amount of extinction using the sdss qso templatereddened by smc-like dust. it is possible to get a good match to the observed(restframe ultraviolet) spectra, but for nearly all the reddened qsos it is notpossible to match the near-ir photometry from ukidss. the likely reasons arethat the sdss qso template is too red at optical wavelengths due tocontaminating host galaxy light and that the assumed smc extinction curve istoo shallow. our survey has demonstrated that selection of qsos based onnear-ir photometry is an efficent way to select qsos, including reddened qsos,with only small contamination from late-type stars and compact galaxies. thiswill be useful with ongoing and future wide-field near-ir surveys such as thevista and euclid surveys.

1207.6088	galaxy counterparts of intervening high-z sub-dlas/dlas and mgii  absorbers towards gamma-ray bursts	we present the first search for galaxy counterparts of intervening high-z(2&lt;z&lt; 3.6) sub-dlas and dlas towards grbs. our final sample comprises of fiveintervening sub-dlas and dlas in four grb fields. to identify candidate galaxycounterparts of the absorbers we use deep optical and near-infrared imaging,and low-, mid- and high-resolution spectroscopy acquired with 6 to 10-m classtelescopes, the hubble and the spitzer space telescopes. furthermore, we usethe spectroscopic information and spectral-energy-distribution fittingtechniques to study them in detail. our main result is the detection andspectroscopic confirmation of the galaxy counterpart of the intervening dla atz=3.096 in the field of grb 070721b (z_grb=3.6298) as proposed by otherauthors. we also identify good candidates for the galaxy counterparts of thetwo strong mgii absorbers at z=0.6915 and 1.4288 towards grb 050820a(z_grb=2.615). the properties of the detected dla galaxy are typical forlyman-break galaxies (lbgs) at similar redshifts; a young, highly starforminggalaxy that shows evidence for a galactic outflow. this supports the hypothesisthat a dla can be the gaseous halo of an lbg. in addition, we report a redshiftcoincidence of different objects associated with metal lines in the same field,separated by 130-161 kpc. the high detection rate of three correlatedstructures on a length scale as small as ~150 kpc in two pairs of lines ofsight is intriguing. the absorbers in each of these are most likely not part ofthe same gravitationally bound structure. they more likely represent groups ofgalaxies.

1301.5013	mass-metallicity relation from z=5 to the present: evidence for a  transition in the mode of galaxy growth at z=2.6 due to the end of sustained  primordial gas infall	we analyze the redshift evolution of the mass-metallicity relation in asample of 110 damped ly$\alpha$ absorbers spanning the redshift range$z=0.11-5.06$ and find that the zero-point of the correlation changessignificantly with redshift. the evolution is such that the zero-point isconstant at the early phases of galaxy growth (i.e. no evolution) but thenfeatures a sharp break at $z=2.6\pm 0.2$ with a rapid incline towards lowerredshifts such that damped absorbers of identical masses are more metal rich atlater times than earlier. the slope of this mass metallicity correlationevolution is $0.35 \pm 0.07$ dex per unit redshift.  we compare this result to similar studies of the redshift evolution ofemission selected galaxy samples and find a remarkable agreement with the slopeof the evolution of galaxies of stellar mass log$(m_{*}/m_\odot) \approx 8.5$.this allows us to form an observational tie between damped absorbers andgalaxies seen in emission.  we use results from simulations to infer the virial mass of the dark matterhalo of a typical dla galaxy and find a ratio $(m_{vir}/m_{*}) \approx 30$.  we compare our results to those of several other studies that have reportedstrong transition-like events at redshifts around $z=2.5-2.6$ and argue thatall those observations can be understood as the consequence of a transitionfrom a situation where galaxies were fed more unprocessed infalling gas thanthey could easily consume to one where they suddenly become infall starved andturn to mainly processing, or re-processing, of previously acquired gas.

1305.0262	on-sky characterisation of the vista nb118 narrow-band filters at 1.19  micron	observations of the high redshift universe through narrow-band filters haveproven very successful in the last decade. the 4-meter vista telescope,equipped with the wide-field camera vircam, offers a major step forward inwide-field near-infrared imaging, and in order to utilise vista's largefield-of-view and sensitivity, the dark cosmology centre provided a set of 16narrow-band filters for vircam. these nb118 filters are centered at awavelength near 1.19 micron in a region with few airglow emission lines. thefilters allow the detection of halpha emitters at z = 0.8, hbeta and [oiii]emitters at z ~ 1.4, [oii] emitters at z = 2.2, and ly-alpha emitters at z =8.8. based on guaranteed time observations of the cosmos field we here presenta detailed description and characterization of the filters and theirperformance. in particular we provide sky-brightness levels and depths for eachof the 16 detector/filter sets and find that some of the filters show signs ofsome red-leak. we identify a sample of 2 x 10^3 candidate emission-line objectsin the data. cross-correlating this sample with a large set of galaxies withknown spectroscopic redshifts we determine the "in situ" passbands of thefilters and find that they are shifted by about 3.5-4 nm (corresponding to 30%of the filter width) to the red compared to the expectation based on thelaboratory measurements. finally, we present an algorithm to mask outpersistence in vircam data. scientific results extracted from the data will bepresented separately.

0805.2454	splitting sensitivity of the ground and 7.6 ev isomeric states of 229th	the lowest-known excited state in nuclei is the 7.6 ev isomer of 229th. thisenergy is within the range of laser-based investigations that could allowaccurate measurements of possible temporal variation of this energy splitting.this in turn could probe temporal variation of the fine-structure constant orother parameters in the nuclear hamiltonian. we investigate the sensitivity ofthis transition energy to these quantities. we find that the two states arepredicted to have identical deformations and thus the same coulomb energieswithin the accuracy of the model (viz., within roughly 30 kev). we thereforefind no enhanced sensitivity to variation of the fine-structure constant. inthe case of the strong interaction the energy splitting is found to have acomplicated dependence on several parameters of the interaction, which makes anaccurate prediction of sensitivity to temporal changes of fundamental constantsproblematical. neither the strong- nor coulomb-interaction contributions to theenergy splitting of this doublet can be constrained within an accuracy betterthan a few tens of kev, so that only upper limits can be set on the possiblesensitivity to temporal variations of the fundamental constants.

1508.05964	a method to calculate fission-fragment yields $y(z,n)$ versus proton and  neutron number in the brownian shape-motion model. application to  calculations of u and pu charge yields	we propose a method to calculate the two-dimensional (2d) fission-fragmentyield $y(z,n)$ versus both proton and neutron number, with inclusion ofodd-even staggering effects in both variables. the approach is to use brownianshape-motion on a macroscopic-microscopic potential-energy surface which, for aparticular compound system is calculated versus four shape variables:elongation (quadrupole moment $q_2$), neck $d$, left nascent fragmentspheroidal deformation $\epsilon_{\rm f1}$, right nascent fragment deformation$\epsilon_{\rm f2}$ and two asymmetry variables, namely proton and neutronnumbers in each of the two fragments. the extension of previous models 1)introduces a method to calculate this generalized potential-energy function and2) allows the correlated transfer of nucleon pairs in one step, in addition tosequential transfer. in the previous version the potential energy wascalculated as a function of $z$ and $n$ of the compound system and its shape,including the asymmetry of the shape. we outline here how to generalize themodel from the "compound-system" model to a model where the emerging fragmentproton and neutron numbers also enter, over and above the compound systemcomposition.

1508.06294	nuclear ground-state masses and deformations: frdm(2012)	we tabulate the atomic mass excesses and binding energies, ground-stateshell-plus-pairing corrections, ground-state microscopic corrections, andnuclear ground-state deformations of 9318 nuclei ranging from $^{16}$o to$a=339$. the calculations are based on the finite-range droplet macroscopicmodel and the folded-yukawa single-particle microscopic model. relative to ourfrdm(1992) mass table in {\sc atomic data and nuclear data tables} [{\bf 59}185 (1995)], the results are obtained in the same model, but with considerablyimproved treatment of deformation and fewer of the approximations that werenecessary earlier, due to limitations in computer power. the more accurateexecution of the model and the more extensive and more accurate experimentalmass data base now available allows us to determine one additionalmacroscopic-model parameter, the density-symmetry coefficient $l$, which wasnot varied in the previous calculation, but set to zero. because we now realizethat the frdm is inaccurate for some highly deformed shapes occurring infission, because some effects are derived in terms of perturbations around asphere, we only adjust its macroscopic parameters to ground-state masses. thevalues of ten constants are determined directly from an optimization to fitground-state masses of 2149 nuclei ranging from $^{16}$o to $^{265}_{106}$sgand $^{264}_{108}$hs. the error of the mass model is 0.5595~mev. we alsoprovide masses in the frldm, which in the more accurate treatments now has anerror of 0.6618 mev. but in contrast to the frdm, it is suitable for studies offission and has been extensively so applied elsewhere, with frldm(2002)constants. the frldm(2012) fits 31 fission barrier heights from $^{70}$se to$^{252}$cf with a root-mean-square deviation of 1.052 mev.

astro-ph;0001105	clustering of galaxies at faint magnitudes	significant uncertainties exist in the measured amplitude of the angulartwo-point correlation function of galaxies at magnitudes $i\approx26$ andfainter. published results from hst and ground-based galaxy catalogs seem todiffer by as much as a factor of 3, and it is not clear whether the correlationamplitude as a function of magnitude increases or decreases in the faintestmagnitude bins. in order to clarify the situation, we present new results fromboth ground-based and hst galaxy catalogs. the angular two-point correlationfunction as a function of limiting r and i magnitudes was computed from agalaxy catalog created from the hubble deep field - south (hdf-s) wfpc2 image.the measured amplitudes of the correlation at an angular separation of 1 arcsecare consistent with those measured in the northern counter part of the field.the flanking fields (ff fields) of the hubble deep fields were used to extendthe magnitude range for which we compute correlation amplitudes towardsbrighter magnitude bins. this allows easier comparison of the amplitudes toground based data. the newly measured correlation amplitudes as a function ofmagnitude limit were compared to previously published measurements at largerseparations. for this comparison, the correlation function was approximated bya power law with an index of 0.8. the scatter in the correlation amplitudes istoo large to be explained by random errors. we argue that the most likely causeis the assumption that the shape of the correlation function does not depend onthe magnitude limit.

astro-ph;0004079	the sources of extended continuum emission towards q0151+048a : the host  galaxy and the damped ly-alpha absorber	we present deep imaging in the u, b and i bands obtained under excellentseeing conditions of the double quasar q0151+048a,b and of the damped ly-alpha(dla) absorbing galaxy at z(abs) = 1.9342 named s4.  we analyse the data employing two separate and independent methods. first wedeconvolve the images using the mcs algorithm, secondly we decompose the imagesvia an object based iteration process where we fit models to objects withoutany attempt to improve the resolution of the data. our detailed analysis of theimages reveals, somewhat surprisingly, that extended objects centred on thequasars themselves are much brighter continuum sources than the dla galaxy.  due to the complexity caused by the many superimposed objects, we are unableto certify whether or not continuum emission from the dla galaxy is detected.continuum emission from the extended objects centred on the positions of thequasars is clearly seen, and the objects are tentatively identified as the``host galaxies'' of the quasars. the flux of those host galaxies is of order2--6% of the quasar flux, and the light profile of the brighter of the two isclearly best fit with a de vaucouleurs profile. we discuss two alternativeinterpretations of the origin of the extended flux: i) the early stage of amassive elliptical galaxy in the process of forming the bulk of its stars, andii) quasar light scattered by dust.

astro-ph;0007252	the fundamental plane of field early-type galaxies at intermediate  redshift	we present preliminary results on the evolution of the stellar populations offield early-type galaxies (e/s0) from z=0.4 to z=0. the diagnostic tool used inthis study is the fundamental plane (fp), a tight empirical correlation betweentheir central velocity dispersion (sigma), effective radius (re), and effectivesurface brightness (sbe), which is observed to hold in the local universe.using hst-wfpc2 archive images and spectra obtained at the eso-3.6m telescopewe measured the fp parameters for a sample of ~30 field e/s0s at z=0.2-0.4.remarkably, field e/s0s at intermediate redshift also define a tight fp, withscatter unchanged with respect to that of local samples. the intermediateredshift fp is offset from the local one, in the sense that, for given re andsigma, galaxies are brighter at z=0.4 than at z=0. the implication of theoffset of the fp in terms of passive evolution of the stellar populationdepends on its star formation history. in a single burst scenario, the stellarpopulations of field e/s0s were formed at z=0.8-1.6 (omega=0.3;omega_{lambda}=0.7; h_0=50 km/s/mpc). alternatively, the bulk of stars (90% inmass) can be formed at high redshift (z~3), and the rest in a secondary burstoccurred more recently (z~0.5-0.8).

astro-ph;0101064	deep imaging of q2112+059: a bright host galaxy but no dla absorber	in a ongoing programme aimed at studying galaxy counterparts of dampedly-alpha absorbers (dlas) we have obtained high resolution deep i-band imagingdata of the field around the z_em = 0.457 bal qso q2112+059. in the literaturethis qso is listed to have a candidate dla at z_abs = 0.2039 along the line ofsight. after subtraction of the qso point spread function (psf) we detect agalaxy centred on the position of q2112+059. to help answer whether this galaxyis the dla or the qso host galaxy we retrieved a ghrs spectrum of q2112+059from the hst-archive. this spectrum shows that there is no ly-alpha absorptionline at z_abs = 0.2039. this fact in combination with the perfect alignment onthe sky of the galaxy and q2112+059 lead us to the conclusion that the galaxymust be the host galaxy of q2112+059.  the host galaxy of q2112+059 is bright (m_i^obs = -23.6), and has a radialprofile well fitted by a {\it modified hubble + de vaucouleurs} profile withr_c = 0.5 kpc and r_e = 3.6 kpc. our results are well in line with theconclusion of earlier work done at lower redshifts, that bright low redshiftqsos preferentially reside in luminous, elliptical galaxies. the host ofq2112+059 is however, despite it's brightness, very compact when compared toearly type galaxies at lower redshifts.

astro-ph;0103058	the host galaxy and optical light curve of the gamma-ray burst grb  980703	we present deep hst/stis and ground-based photometry of the host galaxy ofthe gamma-ray burst grb 980703 taken 17, 551, 710, and 716 days after theburst. we find that the host is a blue, slightly over-luminous galaxy withv_gal = 23.00 +/- 0.10, (v-r)_gal = 0.43 +/- 0.13, and a centre that isapproximately 0.2 mag bluer than the outer regions of the galaxy. the galaxyhas a star-formation rate of 8-13 m_sun/yr, assuming no extinction in the host.we find that the galaxy is best fit by a sersic r^(1/n) profile with n ~= 1.0and a half-light radius of 0.13 arcsec (= 0.72/h_100 proper kpc). thiscorresponds to an exponential disk with a scale radius of 0.22 arcsec (=1.21/h_100 proper kpc). subtracting a fit with elliptical isophotes leaveslarge residuals, which suggests that the host galaxy has a somewhat irregularmorphology, but we are unable to connect the location of grb 980703 with anyspecial features in the host. the host galaxy appears to be a typical exampleof a compact star forming galaxy similar to those found in the hubble deepfield north. the r-band light curve of the optical afterglow associated withthis gamma-ray burst is consistent with a single power-law decay having a slopeof alpha = -1.37 +/- 0.14. due to the bright underlying host galaxy the latetime properties of the light-curve are very poorly constrained. the decay ofthe optical light curve is consistent with a contribution from an underlyingtype ic supernova like sn1998bw, or a dust echo, but such contributions cannotbe securely established.

astro-ph;0105032	nicmos imaging search for damped lya galaxies	we are engaged in a programme of imaging with the stis and nicmos (nic2)instruments aboard the hubble space telescope (hst), to search for the galaxycounterparts of 18 high-redshift z&gt;1.75 damped lya absorption lines and 5lyman-limit systems seen in the spectra of 16 target quasars. this paperpresents the results of the imaging campaign with the nic2 camera. we describethe steps followed in reducing the data and combining in mosaics, and themethods used for subtracting the image of the quasar in each field, and forconstructing error frames that include the systematic errors associated withthe psf subtraction. to identify candidate counterparts, that are eithercompact or diffuse, we convolved the image and variance frames with circulartop-hat filters of diameter 0.45 and 0.90 arcsec respectively, to create framesof summed s/n within the aperture. for each target quasar we provide catalogueslisting positions and aperture magnitudes of all sources within a square ofside 7.5 arcsec centred on the quasar, detected at s/n&gt;6. we find a total of 41candidates of which three have already been confirmed spectroscopically as thecounterparts. we provide the aperture magnitude detection limits as a functionof impact parameter, for both detection filters, for each field. the averagedetection limit for compact (diffuse) sources is h(ab)=25.0 (24.4) at anangular separation of 0.56 arcsec (0.79 arcsec) from the quasar, improving toh(ab)=25.5 (24.8) at large angular separations. for the brighter sources wehave measured the half-light radius and the n parameter of the best-fitdeconvolved sersic-law surface-brightness profile, and the ellipticity andorientation.

astro-ph;0105114	detection of a redshift 3.04 filament	the filamentary structure of the early universe has until now only been seenin numerical simulations. despite this lack of direct observational evidence,the prediction of early filamentary structure formation in a cold dark matterdominated universe has become a paradigm for our understanding of galaxyassembly at high redshifts. clearly observational confirmation is required.lyman break galaxies are too rare to be used as tracers of filaments and weargue that to map out filaments in the high z universe, one will need toidentify classes of objects fainter than those currently accessible via thelyman break technique. objects selected via their ly-alpha emission, and/or asdla absorbers, populate the faintest accessible part of the high redshiftgalaxy luminosity function, and as such make up good candidates for objectswhich will map out high redshift filaments. here we present the first directdetection of a filament (at z=3.04) mapped by those classes of objects. theobservations are the deepest yet to have been done in ly-alpha imaging at highredshift, and they reveal a single string of proto-galaxies spanning about 5mpc (20 mpc comoving). expanding the cosmological test proposed by alcock &amp;paczynski (1979), we outline how observations of this type can be used todetermine omega_lambda at z=3.

astro-ph;0105399	probing the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function at z=3 with  ly-alpha emission	we present spectroscopic observations obtained with the eso very largetelecope (vlt) of seven candidate ly-alpha emitting galaxies in the field ofthe radio quiet q1205-30 at z=3.04 previously detected with deep narrow bandimaging. based on equivalent widths and limits on line ratios we confirm thatall seven objects are ly-alpha emitting galaxies. deep images also obtainedwith the vlt in the b and i bands show that five of the seven galaxies havevery faint continuum fluxes (i(ab) approx. 26.8 and b(ab) approx. 27.3). thestar formation rates of these seven galaxies estimated from the rest-frame uvcontinuum around 2000aa, as probed by the i-band detections, as well as fromthe ly-alpha luminosities, are 1-4 m_sun yr^{-1}. this is 1-3 orders ofmagnitude lower than for other known populations of star-forming galaxies atsimilar redshifts (the lyman-break galaxies and the sub-mm selected sources).the inferred density of the objects is high, 16+-4 per arcmin^2 per unitredshift. this is consistent with the integrated luminosity function forlyman-break galaxies down to r=27 if the fraction of ly-alpha emitting galaxiesis approx. 70% at the faint end of the luminosity function. however, if thisfraction is 20% as reported for the bright end of the luminosity function thenthe space density in this field is significantly larger (by a factor of 3.5)than expected from the luminosity function for lyman-break galaxies in thehdf-north. this would be an indication that at least some radio quiet qsos athigh redshift reside in overdense environments or that the faint end slope ofthe high redshift luminosity function has been underestimated. theseobservations show that ly-alpha emission is an efficient method by which toprobe the faint end of the luminosity function at high redshifts.

astro-ph;0203245	deep ly-alpha imaging of two z=2.04 grb host galaxy fields	we report on the results of deep narrow-band ly-alpha, u and i imaging of thefields of two grbs at z=2.04 (grb 000301c and grb 000926). we find that thehost galaxy of grb 000926 is an extended, strong ly-alpha emitter with arest-frame equivalent width of 71+20-15 aa. the galaxy consists of two maincomponents and several fainter knots. grb 000926 occurred in the westerncomponent, whereas most of the ly-alpha luminosity (about 65%) originates inthe eastern component. using archival hst images of the host galaxy we measurethe spectral slopes (f_lambda prop. to lambda^beta) of the two components tobeta = -2.4+-0.3 (east) and -1.4+-0.2 (west). this implies that both componentscontain at most small amounts of dust, consistent with the observed strongly-alpha emission. the western component has a slightly redder v-i colour thanthe eastern component, suggesting the presence of at least some dust. we do notdetect the host galaxy of grb 000301c in neither ly-alpha emission nor in u andi-band images. we infer a limit of u(ab)&gt;27.7 (2-sigma limit per arcsec^2). theupper limits on the ly-alpha flux implies a ly-alpha equivalent width upperlimit of 150aa. we find 11 and 8 other galaxies with excess emission in thenarrow filter in the fields of grb 000301c and grb 000926 respectively. basedon these detections we conclude that grb 000926 occurred in one of thestrongest centres of star formation within several mpc, whereas grb 000301coccurred in an intrinsically very faint galaxy far from being the strongestcentre of star formation in its galactic environment. under the hypothesis thatgrbs trace star formation, the wide range of grb host galaxy luminositiesimplies a very steep faint end slope of the high redshift galaxy luminosityfunction.

astro-ph;0205425	constraints on (omega_m,omega_lambda) using distributions of inclination  angles for high redshift filaments	in this paper we present a scale free method to determine the cosmologicalparameters (omega_m, omega_lambda). the method is based on the requirement ofisotropy of the distribution of orientations of cosmological filaments. thecurrent structure formation paradigm predicts that the first structures to formare voids and filaments, causing a web-like structure of the matterdistribution at high redshifts. recent observational evidence suggests that thethreads, or filaments, of the cosmic web most easily are mapped in ly-alphaemission. we describe how such a 3d map can be used to constrain thecosmological parameters in a way which, contrary to most other cosmologicaltests, does not require the use of a standard rod or a standard candle. weperform detailed simulations in order to define the optimal survey parametersfor the definition of an observing programme aimed to address this test, and toinvestigate how statistical and observational errors will influence theresults. we conclude that observations should target filaments of comoving size15-50 mpc in the redshift range 2-4, and that each filament must be defined byat least four ly-alpha emitters. detection of 20 filaments will be sufficientto obtain a result, while 50 filaments will make it possible to placesignificant new constraints on the values of omega_m and omega_lambda permittedby the current supernova observations. in a future paper we study how robustthese conclusions are to systematic velocities in the survey box.

astro-ph;0406307	detection of lyman-alpha emission from a dla galaxy: possible  implications for a luminosity-metallicity relation at z = 2-3	in an ongoing programme to identify a sample of high z dla galaxies we havefound the long sought for case of a ly-alpha emitter seen in the centre of abroad dla trough. this is the predicted `textbook case' of an intervening dlagalaxy if dla galaxies are small, but would not be expected if intervening highredshift dla galaxies have large gaseous disks. the ly-alpha flux is5.4{+2}{-0.8} * 1e-17 ergs/s/cm2 similar to what has been found in previouslyknown high z dla galaxies. the impact parameter is found to be 0.3+-0.3 arcsec.this is smaller than what was found in previous cases but still consistent withrandom sight-lines through absorbers with mean impact parameter ~1 arcsec. ofthe 24 dlas targeted in the nicmos imaging survey five have now been identifiedas ly-alpha emitters. the dla galaxies with detected ly-alpha emission tend tohave higher interstellar metallicities than those with undetected ly-alphaemission. this is plausibly explained as a consequence of a positivecorrelation between the ly-alpha line luminosities of the galaxies and theirmetallicities, although the present sample is too small for a definitiveconclusion. the available observations of high-redshift dla galaxies are alsoconsistent with a negative correlation between ly-alpha equivalent widths andmetallicities, as seen in nearby star-forming galaxies and usually attributedto the preferential absorption of ly-alpha photons by dust grains.

astro-ph;0504402	the mass-metallicity relation for high-redshift damped ly-alpha galaxies	we used our database of eso vlt-uves spectra of quasars to build up a sampleof 67 damped lyman-alpha (dla) systems with redshifts 1.7&lt;zabs&lt;3.7. for eachsystem, we measured average metallicities relative to solar, [x/h] (with eitherx=zn, s or si), and the velocity widths of low-ionization line profiles, w1. wefind that there is a tight correlation between the two quantities, detected atthe 5sigma significance level. the existence of such a correlation, over morethan two orders of magnitude spread in metallicity, is likely to be theconsequence of an underlying mass-metallicity relation for the galaxiesresponsible for dla absorption lines. the best-fit linear relation is[x/h]=1.35(\pm 0.11)\log w1 -3.69(\pm 0.18)$ with w1 expressed in km/s. whilethe slope of this velocity-metallicity relation is the same withinuncertainties between the higher and the lower redshift bins of our sample,there is a hint of an increase of the intercept point of the relation withdecreasing redshift. this suggests that galaxy halos of a given mass tend tobecome more metal-rich with time. moreover, the slope of this relation isconsistent with that of the luminosity-metallicity relation for local galaxies.the dla systems having the lowest metallicities among the dla population wouldtherefore, on average, correspond to the galaxies having the lowest masses. inturn, these galaxies should have the lowest luminosities among the dla galaxypopulation. this may explain the recent result that the few dla systems withdetected ly-alpha emission have higher than average metallicities.

astro-ph;0505477	tracing large-scale structure at high redshift with lyman-alpha  emitters: the effect of peculiar velocities	we investigate the effect of peculiar velocities on the redshift spacedistribution of z&gt;~2 galaxies, and we focus in particular on ly-alpha emitters.we generate catalogues of dark matter (dm) halos and identify emitters withhalos of the same co-moving space density (m(ly-alpha emitters) ~ 3x10^11m_sun). we decompose the peculiar velocity field of halos into streaming,gradient and random components, and compute and analyse these as a function ofscale. streaming velocities are determined by fluctuations on very largescales, strongly affected by sample variance, but have a modest impact on theinterpretation of observations. gradient velocities are the most important asthey distort structures in redshift space, changing the thickness andorientation of sheets and filaments. random velocities are typically below orof the same order as the typical observational uncertainty on the redshift. wediscuss the importance of these effects for the interpretation of data on thelarge-scale structure as traced by ly-alpha emitters (or similar kinds ofastrophysical high-redshift objects), focusing on the induced errors in theviewing angles of filaments. we compare our predictions of velocity patternsfor ly-alpha emitters to observations and find that redshift clumping ofly-alpha emitters, as reported for instance in the fields of high-redshiftradio galaxies, does not allow to infer whether an observed field is samplingan early galaxy overdensity.

astro-ph;0505542	ly-alpha and uv emission from high-redshift grb hosts: to what extent do  grbs trace star formation?	we report the result of a search for ly-alpha emission from the host galaxiesof the gamma-ray bursts (grbs) 030226 (z = 1.986), 021004 (z = 2.335) and020124 (z = 3.198). we find that the host galaxy of grb 021004 is an extended(around 8 kpc) strong ly-alpha emitter with a restframe equivalent width (ew)of 68^{+12}_{-11} aa, and a star-formation rate of 10.6 +/- 2.0 m_sun/yr. we donot detect the hosts of grb 030226 and grb 020124, but the upper limits ontheir ly-alpha fluxes do not rule out large restframe ews. in the fields of grb021004 and grb 030226 we find seven and five other galaxies, respectively, withexcess emission in the narrow-band filter. these galaxies are candidately-alpha emitting galaxies in the environment of the host galaxies. we havealso compiled a list of all z &gt; 2 grb hosts, and demonstrate that a scenariowhere they trace star formation in an unbiased way is compatible with currentobservational constraints. fitting the z=3 luminosity function (lf) under thisassumption, results in a characteristic luminosity of r* = 24.6 and a faint endslope of alpha = -1.55, consistent with the lf measured for lyman-breakgalaxies.

astro-ph;0506101	on the afterglow and host galaxy of grb021004: a comprehensive study  with the hubble space telescope	(abridged) we report on hst observations of the late-time afterglow and hostgalaxy of grb021004 (z=2.33). although this grb is one of the best observed sofar, there is substantial disagreement between different interpretations ofdata sets on this burst in the literature. we have observed the field ofgrb021004 with the hst at multiple epochs from 3 days until almost 10 monthsafter the burst. with stis spectroscopy we cover the spectral region 600-1700aain the restframe. from the limit on the flux recovery bluewards of thelyman-limit we constrain the hi column density to be above 1x10^18 cm-2 basedon acs and nicmos imaging we find that the afterglow evolved achromaticallywithin the errors. the color changes observed by other authors during the firstfour days must be related to a stochastic phenomenon superimposed on anafterglow component with a constant spectral shape. this achromaticity impliesthat the cooling break has remained on the blue side of the optical part of thespectrum for at least two weeks after the burst. the optical-to-x-ray slope isconsistent with being the same at 1.4 and 52.4 days after the burst. thisindicates that the cooling frequency is constant and hence, according tofireball models, that the circumburst medium has a constant density profile.the late-time slope of the lightcurve is in the range alpha_2 = 1.8-1.9, and isinconsistent with a single power-law. this could be due to a late-timeflattening caused by the transition to non-relativistic expansion or due toexcess emission (a lightcurve `bump') 7 days after burst. the host is astarburst galaxy with no evidence for dust and with strong ly-alpha emission.the afterglow was located very close (~100 pc) to the center of the hostsuggesting that the progenitor was associated with a circumnuclear starburst.

astro-ph;0509424	multi-wavelength studies of the optically dark gamma-ray burst 001025a	we identify the fading x-ray afterglow of grb 001025a from xmm-newtonobservations obtained 1.9-2.3 days, 2 years, and 2.5 years after the burst. thenon-detection of an optical counterpart to an upper limit of r=25.5, 1.20 daysafter the burst, makes grb 001025a a ``dark'' burst. based on the x-rayafterglow spectral properties of grb 001025a, we argue that some bursts appearoptically dark because their afterglow is faint and their cooling frequency isclose to the x-ray band. this interpretation is applicable to several of thefew other dark bursts where the x-ray spectral index has been measured. thex-ray afterglow flux of grb 001025a is an order of magnitude lower than fortypical long-duration gamma-ray bursts. the spectrum of the x-ray afterglow canbe fitted with an absorbed synchrotron emission model, an absorbed thermalplasma model, or a combination thereof. for the latter, an extrapolation tooptical wavelengths can be reconciled with the r-band upper limit on theafterglow, without invoking any optical circumburst absorption, provided thecooling frequency is close to the x-ray band. alternatively, if the x-rayafterglow is due to synchrotron emission only, seven magnitudes of extinctionin the observed r-band is required to meet the r-band upper limit, making grb001025a much more obscured than bursts with detected optical afterglows. basedon the column density of x-ray absorbing circumburst matter, an smc gas-to-dustratio is insufficient to produce this amount of extinction. the x-ray tail ofthe prompt emission enters a steep temporal decay excluding that the tail ofthe prompt emission is the onset of the afterglow (abridged).

astro-ph;0603530	an optical supernova associated with the x-ray flash xrf 060218	long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are associated with type ic supernovaethat are more luminous than average and that eject material at very highvelocities. less-luminous supernovae were not hitherto known to be associatedwith grbs, and therefore grb-supernovae were thought to be rare events. whetherx-ray flashes - analogues of grbs, but with lower luminosities and fewergamma-rays - can also be associated with supernovae, and whether they areintrinsically 'weak' events or typical grbs viewed off the axis of the burst,is unclear. here we report the optical discovery and follow-up observations ofthe type ic supernova sn 2006aj associated with x-ray flash xrf 060218.supernova 2006aj is intrinsically less luminous than the grb-supernovae, butmore luminous than many supernovae not accompanied by a grb. the ejectavelocities derived from our spectra are intermediate between these two groups,which is consistent with the weakness of both the grb output and the supernovaradio flux. our data, combined with radio and x-ray observations, suggest thatxrf 060218 is an intrinsically weak and soft event, rather than a classical grbobserved off-axis. this extends the grb-supernova connection to x-ray flashesand fainter supernovae, implying a common origin. events such as xrf 060218 areprobably more numerous than grb-supernovae.

astro-ph;0606060	the vimos vlt deep survey: the faint type-1 agn sample	we present the type-1 active galactic nuclei (agn) sample extracted from thevimos vlt deep survey first observations of 21000 spectra in 1.75 squaredegree. this sample, which is purely magnitude limited, free of morphologicalor color selection biases, contains 130 broad line agn (blagn) spectra withredshift up to 5. our data are divided into a wide (iab &lt; 22.5) and a deep (iab&lt; 24) subsample containing 56 and 74 objects respectively. because of its depthand selection criteria, this sample is uniquely suited to study the populationof faint type-1 agn. our measured surface density (~ 472 +- 48 blagn per squaredegree with iab &lt; 24) is significantly higher than that of any other opticallyselected sample of blagn with spectroscopic confirmation. by applying amorphological and color analysis to our agn sample we find that: (1)~23% of theagn brighter than iab=22.5 are classified as extended; this percentageincreases to ~42% for those with z &lt; 1.6; (2) a non-negligible fraction of ourblagn are lying close to the color space area occupied by stars in u*-g' versusg'-r' color-color diagram. this leads us to the conclusion that classicaloptical ultraviolet preselection technique, if employed at such deep magnitudes(iab=22.5) in conjuction with a preselection of point-like sources, can missmiss up to ~35% of the agn population. finally, we present a composite spectrumof our sample of objects. while the continuum shape is very similar to that ofthe sdss composite at short wavelengths, it is much redder than it at lambda &gt;3000 a. we interpret this as due to significant contamination from emission ofthe host galaxies, as expected from the faint absolute magnitudes sampled byour survey.

astro-ph;0606185	velocity-metallicity correlation for high-z dla galaxies: evidence for a  mass-metallicity relation?	we used our database of vlt-uves quasar spectra to build up a sample of 70damped lyman-alpha (dla) or strong sub-dla systems with total neutral hydrogencolumn densities of log n(hi)&gt;20 and redshifts in the range 1.7&lt;z_abs&lt;4.3. foreach of the systems, we measured in an homogeneous manner the metallicitiesrelative to solar, [x/h] (with x=zn, or s or si), and the velocity widths oflow-ionization line profiles, delta v. we provide for the first time evidencefor a correlation between dla metallicity and line profile velocity width,which is detected at the 6.1sigma significance level. this confirms the trendpreviously observed in a much smaller sample by wolfe &amp; prochaska (1998). thebest-fit linear relation is [x/h]=1.55(\pm 0.12) log delta v -4.33(\pm 0.23)with delta v expressed in km/s. the slope of the dla velocity-metallicityrelation is the same within uncertainties between the higher (z_abs&gt;2.43) andthe lower (z_abs&lt;2.43) redshift halves of our sample. however, the twopopulations of systems are statistically different. there is a strong redshiftevolution in the sense that the mean metallicity and mean velocity widthincrease with decreasing redshift. we argue that the existence of a dlavelocity-metallicity correlation, over more than a factor of 100 spread inmetallicity, is probably the consequence of an underlying mass-metallicityrelation for the galaxies responsible for dla absorption lines. assuming asimple linear scaling of the galaxy luminosity with the mass of the dark-matterhalo, we find that the slope of the dla velocity-metallicity relation isconsistent with that of the luminosity-metallicity relation derived for localgalaxies.

astro-ph;0610705	photometry with fors at the eso vlt	eso's two focal reducer and low dispersion spectrographs (fors) are theprimary imaging cameras for the vlt. since they are not direct-imaging cameras,the accuracy of photometry which can routinely be obtained is limited bysignificant sky concentration and other effects.  photometric standard observations are routinely obtained by eso, and nightlyzero points are computed mainly for the purpose of monitoring the instrumentperformance. the accuracy of these zero points is about 10%.  recently, we have started a program to investigate, if and how percent-levelabsolute photometric accuracy with fors can be achieved. the main results ofthis project are presented in this paper. we first discuss the quality of theflatfields and how it can be improved. we then use data with improvedflat-fielding to investigate the usefulness of stetson standard fields for forscalibration and the accuracy which can be achieved. the main findings of thefors absolute photometry project program are as follows. there are significantdifferences between the sky flats and the true photometric response of theinstrument which partially depend on the rotator angle. a second ordercorrection to the sky flat significantly improves the relative photometrywithin the field. percent level photometric accuracy can be achieved withfors1. to achieve this accuracy, observers need to invest some of the assignedscience time for imaging of photometric standard fields in addition to theroutine nightly photometric calibration.

astro-ph;0611690	rapid-response mode vlt/uves spectroscopy of grb060418: conclusive  evidence for uv pumping from the time evolution of feii and niii excited- and  metastable-level populations	we present high-resolution spectroscopic observations of grb060418, obtainedwith vlt/uves. these observations were triggered using the vlt rapid responsemode (rrm), which allows for automated observations of transient phenomena,without any human intervention. this resulted in the first uves exposure ofgrb060418 to be started only 10 minutes after the initial swift satellitetrigger. a sequence of spectra covering 330-670 nm were acquired at 11, 16, 25,41 and 71 minutes (mid-exposure) after the trigger, with a resolving power of 7km/s, and a signal-to-noise ratio of 10-15. this time-series clearly showsevidence for time variability of allowed transitions involving feiifine-structure levels, and metastable levels of both feii and niii, at thehost-galaxy redshift z=1.490. this is the first report of absorption linesarising from metastable levels of feii and niii along any grb sightline. wemodel the observed evolution of the level populations with three differentexcitation mechanisms: collisions, excitation by infra-red photons, andfluorescence following excitation by ultraviolet photons. our data allow us toreject the collisional and ir excitation scenarios with high confidence. the uvpumping model, in which the grb afterglow uv photons excite a cloud of atomswith a column density n, distance d, and doppler broadening parameter b,provides an excellent fit, with best-fit values: log n(feii)=14.75+0.06-0.04,log n(niii)=13.84+/-0.02, d=1.7+/-0.2 kpc (but see appendix a), and b=25+/-3km/s. the success of our uv pumping modeling implies that no significant amountof feii or niii is present at distances smaller than ~1.7 kpc (but see erratumin appendix a), most likely because it is ionized by the grb x-ray/uv flash.because neutral hydrogen is more easily ionized than feii and niii, thisminimum distance also applies to any hi present.

astro-ph;9812434	extended ly-alpha emission from a damped ly-alpha absorber at z = 1.93,  and the relation between dlas and lyman-break galaxies	the number of damped ly-alpha absorbers (dlas) currently known is about 100,but our knowledge of their sizes and morphologies is still very sparse as veryfew have been detected in emission. here we present narrow-band and broad-bandobservations of a dla in the field of the quasar pair q0151+048a (qa) andq0151+048b (qb). these two quasars have very similar redshifts z_em = 1.922,1.937, respectively, and an angular separation of 3.27 arcsec. the spectrum ofqa contains a dla at z_abs = 1.9342 (close to the emission redshift) whichshows an emission line in the trough, detected at 4 sigma. our narrow-bandimage confirms this detection and we find ly-alpha emission from an extendedarea covering 6x3 arcsec^2, corresponding to 25x12h^-2 kpc^2 (q0=0.5, h0 = 100hkm s^-1). the total ly-alpha luminosity from the dla is 1.2 x 10^43 h^-2 ergs^-1, which is a factor of several higher than the ly-alpha luminosity foundfrom other dlas. the narrow-band image also indicates that qb is not covered bythe dla. this fact, together with the large equivalent width of the emissionline from the ly-alpha cloud, the large luminosity, and the 300 km s^-1blueshift relative to the dla, can plausibly be explained if qb is the sourceofa lyman-limit system. we also consider the relation between dlas andlyman-break galaxies (lbgs). if dlas are gaseous disks surrounding lbgs, and ifthe apparent brightnesses and impact parameters of the few identified dlas arerepresentative of the brighter members of the population, then the luminositydistribution of dlas is nearly flat, and we would expect that some 70% of thegalaxy counterparts to dlas at z=3 are fainter than m_r=28.
