0902.4457	photometric and spectroscopic detection of the primary transit of the  111-day-period planet hd 80606 b	we report the detection of the primary transit of the extra-solar planet hd80606 b, thanks to photometric and spectroscopic observations performed atobservatoire de haute-provence, simultaneously with the ccd camera at the120-cm telescope and the sophie spectrograph at the 193-cm telescope. weobserved the whole egress of the transit and partially its central part, inboth data sets with the same timings. the ingress occurred before sunset andwas not observed. the full duration of the transit was between 9.5 and 17.2hours. the data allows the planetary radius to be measured (rp = 0.9 +- 0.1rjup) and other parameters of the system to be refined. radial velocitymeasurements show the detection of a prograde rossiter-mclaughlin effect, andprovide a hint for a spin-orbit misalignment. if confirmed, this misalignmentwould corroborate the hypothesis that hd 80606 b owes its unusual orbitalconfiguration to kozai migration. hd 80606 b is by far the transiting planet onthe longest period detected today. its unusually small radius reinforces theobserved relationship between the planet radius and the incident flux receivedfrom the star and opens new questions for theory. orbiting a quite bright star(v=9), it opens opportunities to numerous follow-up studies.

0707.0679	refined parameters and spectroscopic transit of the super-massive planet  hd147506b	in this paper, we report a refined determination of the orbital parametersand the detection of the rossiter-mclaughlin effect of the recently discoveredtransiting exoplanet hd147506b (hat-p-2b). the large orbital eccentricity atthe short orbital period of this exoplanet is unexpected and is distinguishingfrom other known transiting exoplanets. we performed high-precision radialvelocity spectroscopic observations of hd147506 (hat-p-2) with the newspectrograph sophie, mounted on the 1.93 m telescope at the haute-provenceobservatory (ohp). we obtained 63 new measurements, including 35 on may 14 and20 on june 11, when the planet was transiting its parent star. the radialvelocity (rv) anomaly observed illustrates that hat-p-2b orbital motion is setin the same direction as its parent star spin. the sky-projected angle betweenthe normal of the orbital plane and the stellar spin axis, \lambda = 0.2 +12.2-12.5 deg, is consistent with zero. the planetary and stellar radii werere-determined, yielding r_p = 0.951 +0.039 -0.053 r_jup, r_s = 1.416 +0.040-0.062 r_sun. the mass m_p = 8.62 +0.39 -0.55 m_jup and radius of hat-p-2bindicate a density of 12.5 +2.6 -3.6 g cm^{-3}, suggesting an object in betweenthe known close-in planets with typical density of the order of 1 g cm^{-3},and the very low-mass stars, with density greater than 50 g cm^{-3}.

0908.4521	extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs around a-f type stars - vii. theta  cygni radial velocity variations: planets or stellar phenomenon?	(abridged) in the frame of the search for extrasolar planets and brown dwarfsaround early-type main-sequence stars, we present the results obtained on theearly f-type star theta cygni. elodie and sophie at ohp were used to obtain thespectra. our dedicated radial-velocity measurement method was used to monitorthe star's radial velocities over five years. we also use complementary, highangular resolution and high-contrast images taken with pueo at cfht. we showthat theta cygni radial velocities are quasi-periodically variable, with a~150-day period. these variations are not due to the ~0.35-msun stellarcompanion that we detected in imaging at more than 46 au from the star. theabsence of correlation between the bisector velocity span variations and theradial velocity variations for this 7 km/s vsini star, as well as othercriteria indicate that the observed radial velocity variations are not due tostellar spots. the observed amplitude of the bisector velocity span variationsalso seems to rule out stellar pulsations. however, we observe a peak in thebisector velocity span periodogram at the same period as the one found in theradial velocity periodogram, which indicates a probable link between theseradial velocity variations and the low amplitude lineshape variations which areof stellar origin. long-period variations are not expected from this type ofstar to our knowledge. if a stellar origin (hence of new type) was to beconfirmed for these long-period radial velocity variations, this would haveseveral consequences on the search for planets around main-sequence stars, bothin terms of observational strategy and data analysis. an alternativeexplanation for these variable radial velocities is the presence of at leastone planet of a few jupiter masses orbiting at less than 1 au.

0909.0802	candidate free-floating super-jupiters in the young sigma orionis open  cluster	free-floating substellar candidates with estimated theoretical masses of aslow as ~5 jupiter masses have been found in the ~3 myr old sigma orionis opencluster. as the overlap with the planetary mass domain increases, the questionof how these objects form becomes important. the determination of their numberdensity and whether a mass cut-off limit exists is crucial to understandingtheir formation. we propose to search for objects of yet lower masses in thecluster and determine the shape of the mass function at low mass. using new-and (re-analysed) published izjhks[3.6]-[8.0]-band data of an area of 840arcmin2, we performed a search for lt-type cluster member candidates in themagnitude range j=19.5-21.5 mag, based on their expected magnitudes andcolours. besides recovering the t type object s ori 70 and two other knownobjects, we find three new cluster member candidates, s ori 72-74, with j=21mag and within 12 arcmin of the cluster centre. they have theoretical masses of4 (-2,+3) m_jup and are among the least massive free-floating objects detectedby direct imaging outside the solar system. the photometry in archival spitzer[3.6]-[5.8]-band images infers that s ori 72 is an l/t transition candidate ands ori 73 a t-type candidate, following the expected cluster sequence in themid-infrared. finally, the l-type candidate s ori 74 with lower qualityphotometry is located at 11.8 arcsec (~4250 au) of a stellar member of sigmaorionis and could be a companion. after contaminant correction in the areacomplete to j=21.1 mag, we estimate that there remain between zero and twocluster members in the mass interval 6-4 m_jup. our result suggests a possibleturnover in the substellar mass spectrum below ~6 jupiter masses, which couldbe investigated further by wider and deeper photometric surveys.

1001.4774	the harps search for southern extra-solar planets xix. characterization  and dynamics of the gj876 planetary system	precise radial-velocity measurements for data acquired with the harpsspectrograph infer that three planets orbit the m4 dwarf star gj876. inparticular, we confirm the existence of planet "d", which orbits every 1.93785days. we find that its orbit may have significant eccentricity (e=0.14), anddeduce a more accurate estimate of its minimum mass of 6.3 earth masses.dynamical modeling of the harps measurements combined with literaturevelocities from the keck observatory strongly constrain the orbitalinclinations of the "b" and "c" planets. we find that i_b = 48.9 degrees andi_c = 48.1 degrees, which infers the true planet masses of m_b = 2.64 jupitermasses and m_c = 0.83 jupiter masses, respectively. radial velocities alone, inthis favorable case, can therefore fully determine the orbital architecture ofa multi-planet system, without the input from astrometry or transits.  the orbits of the two giant planets are nearly coplanar, and their 2:1 meanmotion resonance ensures stability over at least 5 gyr. the libration amplitudeis smaller than 2 degrees, suggesting that it was damped by some dissipativeprocess during planet formation. the system has space for a stable fourthplanet in a 4:1 mean motion resonance with planet "b", with a period around 15days. the radial velocity measurements constrain the mass of this possibleadditional planet to be at most that of the earth.

1004.0790	observation of the full 12-hour-long transit of the exoplanet hd80606b.  warm-spitzer photometry and sophie spectroscopy	we present new observations of a transit of the 111-day-period exoplanethd80606b. using the spitzer space telescope and its irac camera on thepost-cryogenic mission, we performed a 19-hour-long photometric observation ofhd80606 that covers the full transit of 13-14 january 2010. we complement thisphotometric data by new spectroscopic observations that we simultaneouslyperformed with sophie at haute-provence observatory. this provides radialvelocity measurements of the first half of the transit that was previouslyuncovered with spectroscopy. this new data set allows the parameters of thissingular planetary system to be significantly refined. we obtained aplanet-to-star radius ratio r_p/r_* = 0.1001 +/- 0.0006 that is slightly lowerthan the one measured from previous ground observations. we detected a featurein the spitzer light curve that could be due to a stellar spot. we also found atransit timing about 20 minutes earlier than the ephemeris prediction; thiscould be caused by actual ttvs due to an additional body in the system or byunderestimated systematic uncertainties. the sky-projected angle between thespin-axis of hd80606 and the normal to the planetary orbital plane is found tobe lambda = 42 +/- 8 degrees thanks to the fit of the rossiter-mclaughlinanomaly. this allows scenarios with aligned spin-orbit to be definitivelyrejected. over the twenty planetary systems with measured spin-orbit angles, afew of them are misaligned; this is probably the signature of two differentevolution scenarios for misaligned and aligned systems, depending if theyexperienced or not gravitational interaction with a third body. as in the caseof hd80606b, most of the planetary systems including a massive planet aretilted; this could be the signature of a separate evolution scenario formassive planets in comparison with jupiter-mass planets.

1009.2589	exploring the magnetic topologies of cool stars	magnetic fields of cool stars can be directly investigated through the studyof the zeeman effect on photospheric spectral lines using several approaches.with spectroscopic measurement in unpolarised light, the total magnetic fluxaveraged over the stellar disc can be derived but very little information onthe field geometry is available. spectropolarimetry provides a complementaryinformation on the large-scale component of the magnetic topology. withzeeman-doppler imaging (zdi), this information can be retrieved to produce amap of the vector magnetic field at the surface of the star, and in particularto assess the relative importance of the poloidal and toroidal components aswell as the degree of axisymmetry of the field distribution. the development ofhigh-performance spectropolarimeters associated with multi-lines techniques andzdi allows us to explore magnetic topologies throughout the hertzsprung-russeldiagram, on stars spanning a wide range of mass, age and rotation period. theseobservations bring novel constraints on magnetic field generation by dynamoeffect in cool stars. in particular, the study of solar twins brings newinsight on the impact of rotation on the solar dynamo, whereas the detection ofstrong and stable dipolar magnetic fields on fully convective stars questionsthe precise role of the tachocline in this process.

1109.0321	long-term magnetic activity of a sample of m-dwarf stars from the harps  program i. comparison of activity indices	aims. other stars are known to have magnetic cycles similar to that of thesun. the relationship between these activity variations and the observedradial-velocity is still not satisfactorily understood. in this first paper ouraim is to assess the long-term activity variations in the low end of the mainsequence, having in mind a planetary search perspective. methods. we used asample of 30 m0-m5.5 stars from the harps m-dwarf planet search program with amedian timespan of observations of 5.2 years. we computed chromosphericactivity indicators based on the ca ii h and k, h{\alpha}, he i d3, and na i d1and d2 lines. all data were binned in to average out undesired effects such asrotationally modulated atmospheric inhomogeneities. we searched for long-termvariability of each index and determined the correlations between them.results. while the s_caii, h{\alpha}, and na i indices showed significantvariability for a fraction of our stellar sample (39%, 33%, and 37%,respectively), only 10% of our stars presented significant variability in thehe i index. we therefore conclude that this index is a poor activity indicatorat least for this type of stars. although the h{\alpha} shows good correlationwith s_ca ii for the most active stars, the correlation is lost when theactivity level decreases. this result appears to indicate that the caii-h{\alpha} correlation is dependent on the activity level of the star. the nai lines correlate very well with the s_ca ii index for the stars with lowactivity levels we used, and are thus a good chromospheric activity proxy forearly-m dwarfs. we therefore strongly recommend the use of the na i activityindex because the signal-to-noise ratio in the sodium lines spectral region isalways higher than for the calcium lines.

1110.2694	metallicity of m dwarfs ii. a comparative study of photometric  metallicity scales	stellar parameters are not easily derived from m dwarf spectra, which aredominated by complex bands of diatomic and triatomic molecules and not welldescribed at the line by line level by atmospheric models. m dwarfmetallicities are therefore most commonly derived through less directtechniques. several recent publications propose calibrations that provide themetallicity of an m dwarf from its ks band absolute magnitude and its v-kscolor, but disagree at the \pm0.1 dex level. we compare these calibrations on asample of 23 m dwarfs, which we select as wide (&gt; 5 arcsec) companions of f-,g- or k- dwarfs with metallicities measured on a homogeneous scale, and whichwe require to have v band photometry measured to better than \sim0.03magnitude. we find that the schlaufman &amp; laughlin (2010) calibration has lowestoffsets and residuals against our sample, and use our improved statistics tomarginally refine that calibration. with more strictly selected photometry thanin previous studies, the dispersion around the calibration is well in excess ofthe [fe/h] and photometric uncertainties. this suggests that the origin of theremaining dispersion is astrophysical rather than observational.

0711.1418	the stable magnetic field of the fullly-convective star v374 peg	we report in this paper phase-resolved spectropolarimetric observations ofthe rapidly-rotating fully-convective m4 dwarf v374 peg, on which a strong,mainly axisymmetric, large-scale poloidal magnetic field was recently detected.in addition to the original data set secured in 2005 august, we present herenew data collected in 2005 september and 2006 august. from the rotationalmodulation of unpolarised line profiles, we conclude that starspots are presentat the surface of the star, but their contrast and fractional coverage are muchlower than those of non-fully convective active stars with similar rotationrate. applying tomographic imaging on each set of circularly polarised profilesseparately, we find that the large-scale magnetic topology is remarkably stableon a timescale of 1 yr; repeating the analysis on the complete data setsuggests that the magnetic configuration is sheared by very weak differentialrotation (about 1/10th of the solar surface shear) and only slightly distortedby intrinsic variability. this result is at odds with various theoreticalpredictions, suggesting that dynamo fields of fully-convective stars should bemostly non-axisymmetric unless they succeed at triggering significantdifferential rotation.

1205.5835	the sophie search for northern extrasolar planets. v. follow-up of  elodie candidates: jupiter-analogs around sun-like stars	we present radial-velocity measurements obtained in a programs underway tosearch for extrasolar planets with the spectrograph sophie at the 1.93-mtelescope of the haute-provence observatory. targets were selected fromcatalogs observed with elodie, mounted previously at the telescope, in order todetect long-period planets with an extended database close to 15 years. two newjupiter-analog candidates are reported to orbit the bright stars hd150706 andhd222155 in 16.1 and 10.9 yr at 6.7 (+4.0,-1.4) and 5.1(+0.6,-0.7) au and tohave minimum masses of 2.71 (+1.44,-0.66) and 1.90 (+0.67,-0.53) m_jup,respectively. using the measurements from elodie and sophie, we refine theparameters of the long-period planets hd154345b and hd89307b, and publish thefirst reliable orbit for hd24040b. this last companion has a minimum mass of4.01 +/- 0.49 m_jup orbiting its star in 10.0 yr at 4.92 +/- 0.38 au. moreover,the data provide evidence of a third bound object in the hd24040 system. with asurrounding dust debris disk, hd150706 is an active g0 dwarf for which wepartially corrected the effect of the stellar spot on the sophieradial-velocities. hd222155 is an inactive g2v star. on the basis of theprevious findings of lovis and collaborators and since no significantcorrelation between the radial-velocity variations and the activity index arefound in the sophie data, these variations are not expected to be only due tostellar magnetic cycles. finally, we discuss the main properties of this newpopulation of long-period jupiter-mass planets, which for the moment, consistsof fewer than 20 candidates. these stars are preferential targets either fordirect-imaging or astrometry follow-up to constrain the system parameters andfor higher precision radial-velocity to search for lower mass planets, aimingto find a solar system twin.

1210.0305	cfbdsir2149-0403: a 4-7 jupiter-mass free-floating planet in the young  moving group ab doradus ?	using the cfbdsir wide field survey for brown dwarfs, we identifiedcfbdsirj214947.2-040308.9, a late t dwarf with atypically red j-ks colour. weobtained an x-shooter spectra, with signal detectable from 0.8 to 2.3 micron,which confirmed a t7 spectral type with an enhanced ks-band flux indicative ofa potentially low-gravity, young, object. the comparison of our near infraredspectrum with atmosphere models, for solar metallicity, shows thatcfbdsirj214947.2-040308.9 is probably a 650-750 k, log g=3.75-4.0 substellarobject. using evolution models, this translates into a planetary mass object,with an age in the 20-200 myr range. an independent bayesian analysis fromproper motion measurements results in a 87% probability that this free-floatingplanet is a member of the 50-120 myr old ab doradus moving group, whichstrengthens the spectroscopic youth diagnosis. by combining our atmosphericcharacterisation with the age and metallicity constraints arising from theprobable membership to the ab doradus moving group, we find thatcfbdsirj214947.2-040308.9 is probably a 4-7 jupiter masses free-floating planetwith an effective temperature of ~700k and a log g of ~4.0, typical of the latet-type exoplanets that are targeted by direct imaging. we stress that thisobject could be used as a benchmark for understanding the physics of thesimilar t-type exoplanets that will be discovered by the upcoming high contrastimagers.

0801.2371	clouds search for variability in brown dwarf atmospheres	context: l-type ultra-cool dwarfs and brown dwarfs have cloudy atmospheresthat could host weather-like phenomena. the detection of photometric orspectral variability would provide insight into unresolved atmosphericheterogeneities, such as holes in a global cloud deck.  aims: it has been proposed that growth of heterogeneities in the global clouddeck may account for the l- to t-type transition as brown dwarf photospheresevolve from cloudy to clear conditions. such a mechanism is compatible withvariability. we searched for variability in the spectra of five l6 to t6 browndwarfs in order to test this hypothesis.  methods: we obtained spectroscopic time series using vlt/isaac, over0.99-1.13um, and irtf/spex for two of our targets, in j, h and k bands. wesearch for statistically variable lines and correlation between those.  results: high spectral-frequency variations are seen in some objects, butthese detections are marginal and need to be confirmed. we find no evidence forlarge amplitude variations in spectral morphology and we place firm upperlimits of 2 to 3% on broad-band variability, on the time scale of a few hours.the t2 transition brown dwarf sdss j1254-0122 shows numerous variable features,but a secure variability diagnosis would require further observations.  conclusions: assuming that any variability arises from the rotation ofpatterns of large-scale clear and cloudy regions across the surface, we findthat the typical physical scale of cloud cover disruption should be smallerthan 5-8% of the disk area for four of our targets. the possible variationsseen in sdss j1254-0122 are not strong enough to allow us to confirm the cloudbreaking hypothesis.

0807.3014	prospects for near-infrared characterisation of hot jupiters with vsi	in this paper, we study the feasibility of obtaining near-infrared spectra ofbright extrasolar planets with the 2nd generation vlti spectro-imagerinstrument (vsi), which has the required angular resolution to resolve nearbyhot extrasolar giant planets (egps) from their host stars. taking into accountfundamental noises, we simulate closure phase measurements of severalextrasolar systems using four 8-m telescopes at the vlt and a low spectralresolution (r = 100). synthetic planetary spectra from t. barman are used as aninput. standard chi2-fitting methods are then used to reconstruct planetaryspectra from the simulated data. these simulations show that low-resolutionspectra in the h and k bands can be retrieved with a good fidelity for half adozen targets in a reasonable observing time (about 10 hours, spread over a fewnights). such observations would strongly constrain the planetary temperatureand albedo, the energy redistribution mechanisms, as well as the chemicalcomposition of their atmospheres. systematic errors, not included in oursimulations, could be a serious limitation to these performance estimations.the use of integrated optics is however expected to provide the requiredinstrumental stability (around 10^-4 on the closure phase) to enable the firstthorough characterisation of extrasolar planetary emission spectra in thenear-infrared.

astro-ph;0106277	new neighbours. iii. 21 new companions to nearby dwarfs, discovered with  adaptive optics	we present some results of a cfht adaptive optics search for companions tonearby dwarfs. we identify 21 new components in solar neighbourhood systems, ofwhich 13 were found while surveying a volume-limited sample of m dwarfs within12pc. we are obtaining complete observations for this subsample, to deriveunbiased multiplicity statistics for the very-low-mass disk population.additionally, we resolve for the first time 6 known spectroscopic orastrometric binaries, for a total of 27 newly resolved companions. a fairfraction of the new binaries has favourable parameters for accurate massdeterminations. the newly resolved companion of gl120.1c had an apparentspectroscopic minimum mass in the brown-dwarf range (duquennoy &amp; mayor 1991)and it contributed to the statistical evidence that a few percent of solar typestars might have close-in brown-dwarf companions. we find that gl~120.1cactually is an unrecognised double-lined spectroscopic pair. itsradial-velocity amplitude had therefore been strongly underestimated byduquennoy &amp; mayor, and it does not truly belong to their sample of single-linedsystems with minimum spectroscopic mass below the substellar limit. we alsopresent the first direct detection of gl~494b, an astrometric brown-dwarfcandidate. its luminosity does straddle the substellar limit, and it is a browndwarf if its age is less than 300myr. a few more years of observations willascertain its mass and status from first principles.

astro-ph;0309784	vinci / vlti observations of main sequence stars	main sequence (ms) stars are by far the most numerous class in the universe.they are often somewhat neglected as they are relatively quiet objects (butexceptions exist), though they bear testimony of the past and future of oursun. an important characteristic of the ms stars, particularly the solar-typeones, is that they host the large majority of the known extrasolar planets.moreover, at the bottom of the ms, the red m dwarfs pave the way tounderstanding the physics of brown dwarfs and giant planets. we have measuredvery precise angular diameters from recent vinci/vlti interferometricobservations of a number of ms stars in the k band, with spectral types betweena1v and m5.5v. they already cover a wide range of effective temperatures andradii. combined with precise hipparcos parallaxes, photometry, spectroscopy aswell as the asteroseismic information available for some of these stars, theangular diameters put strong constraints on the detailed models of these stars,and therefore on the physical processes at play.

astro-ph;0405111	first determination of the dynamical mass of a binary l dwarf	we present here the results of astrometric, photometric and spectroscopicobservations leading to the determination of the orbit and dynamical masses ofthe binary l dwarf 2massw j0746425+2000321. high angular resolutionobservations spread over almost 4 years and obtained with the hubble spacetelescope (hst), the eso very large telescope (vlt), and a the w. m. keckobservatory (keck) allow us to cover 36% of the period, corresponding to 60% ofthe orbit, and, for the first time, to derive a precise estimate of the totaland individual masses of such a late-type object. we find an orbital period of3850.9$^{+904}_{-767}$ days. the corresponding total mass is0.146$^{+0.016}_{-0.006}$ m$_{\sun}$, with uncertainties depending on thedistance. spatially resolved low resolution optical (550--1025 nm) spectra havebeen obtained with hst/stis, allowing us to measure the spectral types of thetwo components (l0$\pm$0.5 for the primary and l1.5$\pm$0.5 for the secondary).we also present precise photometry of the individual components measured on thehigh angular resolution images obtained with hst/acs and wfpc2 (visible),vlt/naco (j, h and ks bands) and keck i (ks) band). these spectral andphotometric measurements enable us to estimate their effective temperatures andmass ratio, and to place the object accurately in a h--r diagram. the binarysystem is most likely formed by a primary with a mass of 0.085$\pm$0.010m$_{\sun}$ and a secondary with a mass of 0.066$\pm$0.006 m$_{\sun}$, thusclearly substellar, for an age of approximately 300$\pm$150 myr. h$\alpha$variability indicates chromospheric and/or magnetic activity.

astro-ph;0503260	metallicity of m dwarfs i. a photometric calibration and impact on the  mass-luminosity relation at the bottom of the main sequence	we obtained high resolution elodie and coralie spectra for both components of20 wide visual binaries composed of an f-, g- or k-dwarf primary and an m-dwarfsecondary. we analyse the well understood spectra of the primaries to determinemetallicities ([fe/h]) for these 20 systems, and hence for their m dwarfcomponents. we pool these metallicities with determinations from the literatureto obtain a precise (+- 0.2 dex) photometric calibration of m dwarfmetallicities. this calibration represents a breakthrough in a field wherediscussions have had to remain largely qualitative, and it helps us demonstratethat metallicity explains most of the large dispersion in the empirical v-bandmass-luminosity relation. we examine the metallicity of the two known m-dwarfplanet-host stars, gl 876 (+0.02 dex) and gl 436 (-0.03 dex), in the context ofpreferential planet formation around metal-rich stars. we finally determine themetallicity of the 47 brightest single m dwarfs in a volume limited sample, andcompare the metallicity distributions of solar-type and m-dwarf stars in thesolar neighbourhood.

astro-ph;0610936	direct constraint on the distance of y2 velorum from amber/vlti  observations	in this work, we present the first amber observations, of the wolf-rayet ando (wr+o) star binary system y2 velorum. the amber instrument was used with thetelescopes ut2, ut3, and ut4 on baselines ranging from 46m to 85m. it deliveredspectrally dispersed visibilities, as well as differential and closure phases,with a resolution r = 1500 in the spectral band 1.95-2.17 micron. we interpretthese data in the context of a binary system with unresolved components,neglecting in a first approximation the wind-wind collision zone fluxcontribution. we show that the amber observables result primarily from thecontribution of the individual components of the wr+o binary system. we discussseveral interpretations of the residuals, and speculate on the detection of anadditional continuum component, originating from the free-free emissionassociated with the wind-wind collision zone (wwcz), and contributing at mostto the observed k-band flux at the 5% level. the expected absolute separationand position angle at the time of observations were 5.1&amp;plusmn;0.9mas and66&amp;plusmn;15&amp;deg; respectively. however, we infer a separation of3.62+0.11-0.30 mas and a position angle of 73+9-11&amp;deg;. our analysis thusimplies that the binary system lies at a distance of 368+38-13 pc, in agreementwith recent spectrophotometric estimates, but significantly larger than thehipparcos value of 258+41-31 pc.
