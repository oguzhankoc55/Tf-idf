0901.4737	a holistic approach to carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars	by considering the various cemp subclasses separately, we try to derive, fromthe specific signatures imprinted on the abundances, parameters (such asmetallicity, mass, temperature, and neutron source) characterizing agbnucleosynthesis from the specific signatures imprinted on the abundances, andseparate them from the impact of thermohaline mixing, first dredge-up, anddilution associated with the mass transfer from the companion.to put cemp starsin a broad context, we collect abundances for about 180 stars of variousmetallicities, luminosity classes, and abundance patterns, from our own sampleand from literature. first, we show that there are cemp stars which share theproperties of cemp-s stars and cemp-no stars (which we call cemp-low-s stars).we also show that there is a strong correlation between ba and c abundances inthe s-only cemp stars. this strongly points at the operation of the 13c neutronsource in low-mass agb stars. for the cemp-rs stars (seemingly enriched withelements from both the s- and r-processes), the correlation of the n abundanceswith abundances of heavy elements from the 2nd and 3rd s-process peaks bearsinstead the signature of the 22ne neutron source. adding the fact that cemp-rsstars exhibit o and mg enhancements, we conclude that extremely hot conditionsprevailed during the thermal pulses of the contaminating agb stars. finally, weargue that most cemp-no stars (with no overabundances for the neutron-captureelements) are likely the extremely metal-poor counterparts of cempneutron-capture-rich stars. we also show that the c enhancement in cemp-nostars declines with metallicity at extremely low metallicity ([fe/h]~&lt; -3.2).this trend is not predicted by any of the current agb models.

0903.4174	first stars xii. abundances in extremely metal-poor turnoff stars,and  comparison with the giants	context:the detailed chemical abundances of extremely metal-poor (emp) starsare key guides to understanding the early chemical evolution of the galaxy.most existing data are, however, for giant stars which may have experiencedinternal mixing later. aims: we aim to compare the results for giants with new,accurate abundances for all observable elements in 18 emp turnoff stars.methods:vlt/uves spectra at r ~45,000 and s/n~ 130 per pixel (330-1000 nm) areanalysed with osmarcs model atmospheres and the turbospectrum code to deriveabundances for c, mg, si, ca, sc, ti, cr, mn, co, ni, zn, sr, and ba. results:for ca, ni, sr, and ba, we find excellent consistency with our earlier sampleof emp giants, at all metallicities. however, our abundances of c, sc, ti, cr,mn and co are ~0.2 dex larger than in giants of similar metallicity. mg and siabundances are ~0.2 dex lower (the giant [mg/fe] values are slightly revised),while zn is again ~0.4 dex higher than in giants of similar [fe/h] (6 starsonly). conclusions:for c, the dwarf/giant discrepancy could possibly have anastrophysical cause, but for the other elements it must arise from shortcomingsin the analysis. approximate computations of granulation (3d) effects yieldsmaller corrections for giants than for dwarfs, but suggest that this is anunlikely explanation, except perhaps for c, cr, and mn. nlte computations forna and al provide consistent abundances between dwarfs and giants, unlike thelte results, and would be highly desirable for the other discrepant elements aswell. meanwhile, we recommend using the giant abundances as reference data forgalactic chemical evolution models.

0904.4307	chemical composition of extremely metal-poor stars in the sextans dwarf  spheroidal galaxy	chemical abundances of six extremely metal-poor ([fe/h]&lt;-2.5) stars in thesextans dwarf spheroidal galaxy are determined based on high resolutionspectroscopy (r=40,000) with the subaru telescope high dispersion spectrograph.(1) the fe abundances derived from the high resolution spectra are in goodagreement with the metallicity estimated from the ca triplet lines in lowresolution spectra. the lack of stars with [fe/h]=&lt;-3 in sextans, found byprevious estimates from the ca triplet, is confirmed by our measurements,although we note that high resolution spectroscopy for a larger sample of starswill be necessary to estimate the true fraction of stars with such lowmetallicity. (2) while one object shows an overabundance of mg (similar togalactic halo stars), the mg/fe ratios of the remaining five stars are similarto the solar value. this is the first time that low mg/fe ratios at such lowmetallicities have been found in a dwarf spheroidal galaxy. no evidence forover-abundances of ca and ti are found in these five stars, though themeasurements for these elements are less certain. possible mechanisms toproduce low mg/fe ratios, with respect to that of galactic halo stars, arediscussed. (3) ba is under-abundant in four objects, while the remaining twostars exhibit large and moderate excesses of this element. the abundancedistribution of ba in this galaxy is similar to that in the galactic halo,indicating that the enrichment of heavy elements, probably by the r-process,started at metallicities [fe/h] &lt; -2.5, as found in the galactic halo.

0906.2876	signatures of intrinsic li depletion and li-na anti-correlation in the  metal-poor globular cluster ngc6397	to alleviate the discrepancy between the prediction of the primordial lithiumabundance in the universe and the abundances observed in pop ii dwarfs andsubgiant stars, it has been suggested that the stars observable today haveundergone photospheric depletion of li. to constrain the nature of suchdepletion, we conduct a homogeneous analysis of a very large sample of stars inthe metal-poor globular cluster ngc6397, covering well all evolutionary phasesfrom below the main sequence turn-off to high up the red giant branch. non-lteli abundances or abundance upper limits are obtained for all stars, and for asize-able sub-set of the targets also na abundances are obtained. the sodiumabundances are used to distinguish stars formed out of pristine material fromstars formed out of material affected by pollution from a previous generationof more massive stars. the dwarfs, turn-off, and early subgiant stars form athin abundance plateau, disrupted in the middle of the subgiant branch by thelithium dilution caused by the first dredge-up. a second steep abundance dropis seen at the red giant branch bump. the turn-off stars are more lithium-poor,by up to 0.1 dex, than subgiants that have not yet undergone dredge-up. inaddition, hotter dwarfs are slightly more lithium-poor than cooler dwarfs,which may be a signature of the so-called li dip in the cluster, commonly seenamong popi stars. a considerably large spread in na abundance confirms thatngc6397 has suffered from intra-cluster pollution in its infancy and a limitednumber of na-enhanced and li-deficient stars strongly contribute to form asignificant anti-correlation between the abundances of na and li. the inferredli abundances are compared to predictions from stellar structure modelsincluding atomic diffusion and ad-hoc turbulence below the convection zone.

0906.3140	on the metallicity gradient of the galactic disk	aims: the iron abundance gradient in the galactic stellar disk providesfundamental constraints on the chemical evolution of this important galaxycomponent. however the spread around the mean slope is, at fixed galactocentricdistance, larger than estimated uncertainties. methods: to provide quantitativeconstraints on these trends we adopted iron abundances for 265 classicalcepheids (more than 50% of the currently known sample) based either onhigh-resolution spectra or on photometric metallicity indices. homogeneousdistances were estimated using near-infrared period-luminosity relations. thesample covers the four disk quadrants and their galactocentric distances rangefrom ~5 to ~17 kpc. results: a linear regression over the entire sampleprovides an iron gradient of -0.051+/-0.004 dex/kpc. the above slope agreesquite well, within the errors, with previous estimates based either on cepheidsor on open clusters covering similar galactocentric distances. however, once wesplit the sample in inner (rg &lt; 8 kpc) and outer disk cepheids we found thatthe slope (-0.130+/-0.015 dex/kpc) in the former region is ~3 times steeperthan the slope in the latter one (-0.042+/-0.004 dex/kpc). we found that in theouter disk the radial distribution of metal-poor (mp, [fe/h]&lt;-0.02 dex) andmetal-rich (mr) cepheids across the four disk quadrants does not show a cleartrend when moving from the innermost to the external disk regions. we alsofound that the relative fractions of mp and mr cepheids in the 1st and in the3rd quadrant differ at 8 sigma (mp) and 15 sigma (mr) level.

0707.1019	stroemgren photometry of galactic globular clusters. i. new calibrations  of the metallicity index	we present a new calibration of the stroemgren metallicity index m1 using redgiant (rg) stars in 4 globular clusters (gcs:m92,m13,ngc1851,47tuc) withmetallicity ranging from [fe/h]=-2.2 to -0.7, marginally affected by reddening(e(b-v)&lt;0.04) and with accurate u,v,b,y photometry.the main difference betweenthe new metallicity-index-color (mic) relations and similar relations availablein the literature is that we adopted the u-y/v-y colors instead of theb-y.these colors present a stronger sensitivity to effective temperature, andthe mic relations show a linear slope. the difference between photometricestimates and spectroscopic measurements for rgs in m71,ngc288,ngc362,ngc6397,and ngc6752 is 0.04+/-0.03dex (sigma=0.11dex). we also apply the mic relationsto 85 field rgs with metallicity raning from [fe/h]=-2.4 to -0.5 and accuratereddening estimates. we find that the difference between photometric estimatesand spectroscopic measurements is-0.14+/-0.01dex (sig=0.17dex). we also providetwo sets of mic relations based on evolutionary models that have beentransformed into the observational plane by adopting either semi-empirical ortheoretical color-temperature relations. we apply the semi-empirical relationsto the 9 gcs and find that the difference between photometric and spectroscopicmetallicities is 0.04+/-0.03dex (sig=0.10dex).a similar agreement is found forthe sample of field rgs, with a difference of -0.09+/-0.03dex (sig=0.19dex).thedifference between metallicity estimates based on theoretical relations andspectroscopic measurements is -0.11+/-0.03dex (sig=0.14dex) for the 9 ggcs and-0.24+/-0.03dex (sig=0.15dex) for the field rgs. current evidence indicatesthat new mic relations provide metallicities with an intrinsic accuracy betterthan 0.2dex.

1003.3854	new baade-wesselink distances and radii for four metal-rich galactic  cepheids	we provided accurate estimates of distances, radii and iron abundances forfour metal-rich cepheids, namely v340 ara, uz sct, av sgr and vy sgr. the mainaim of this investigation is to constrain their pulsation properties and theirlocation across the galactic inner disk. we adopted new accurate nir (j,h,k)light curves and new radial velocity measurements for the target cepheids todeterminate their distances and radii using the baade-wesselink technique. inparticular, we adopted the most recent calibration of the ir surface brightnessrelation and of the projection factor. moreover, we also provided accuratemeasurements of the iron abundance of the target cepheids. current distanceestimates agree within one sigma with similar distances based either onempirical or on theoretical nir period-luminosity relations. however, theuncertainties of the baade-wesselink distances are on average a factor of 3-4smaller when compared with errors affecting other distance determinations. meanbaade-wesselink radii also agree at one sigma level with cepheid radii basedeither on empirical or on theoretical period-radius relations. iron abundancesare, within one sigma, similar to the iron contents provided by andrievsky andcollaborators, thus confirming the super metal-rich nature of the targetcepheids. we also found that the luminosity amplitudes of classical cepheids,at odds with rr lyrae stars, do not show a clear correlation with themetal-content. this circumstantial evidence appears to be the consequence ofthe hertzsprung progression together with the dependence of the topology of theinstability strip on metallicity, evolutionary effects and binaries.

1012.0477	tracing the evolution of ngc6397 through the chemical composition of its  stellar populations	with the aim to constrain multiple populations in the metal-poor globularcluster ngc6397, we analyse and discuss the chemical compositions of a largenumber of elements in 21 red giant branch stars. high-resolution spectra wereobtained with the flames/uves spectrograph on vlt. we have determined non-lteabundances of na and lte abundances for the remaining 21 elements, including o,mg, al, alpha, iron-peak, and neutron-capture elements, many of which have notpreviously been analysed for this cluster. we have also considered theinfluence of possible he enrichment in the analysis of stellar spectra. we findthat the na abundances of evolved, as well as unevolved, stars show a distinctbimodality, which suggests the presence of two stellar populations; oneprimordial stellar generation with composition similar to field stars, and asecond generation that is enriched in material processed throughhydrogen-burning (enriched in na and al and depleted in o and mg). the clusteris dominated (75%) by the second generation. the red giant branch show asimilar bimodal distribution in the stroemgren colour index c_y=c_1-(b-y),implying a large difference also in n abundance. the two populations have thesame composition of all analysed elements heavier than al, within themeasurement uncertainty of the analysis, with the possible exception of [y/fe].using two stars with close to identical stellar parameters, one from eachgeneration, we estimate the difference in he content, delta y=0.01+-0.06, giventhe assumption that the mass fraction of iron is the same for the stars.finally, we show that winds from fast rotating massive stars of the firstgeneration can be held responsible for the abundance patterns observed inngc6397 second generation long-lived stars and estimate that the initial massof the cluster were at least ten times higher than its present-day value.

1012.4358	first stars xiv. sulfur abundances in extremely metal-poor (emp) stars	sulfur is important: the site of its formation is uncertain, and at very lowmetallicity the trend of [s/fe] against [fe/h] is controversial. below[fe/h]=-2.0, [s/fe] remains constant or it decreases with [fe/h], depending onthe author and the multiplet used in the analysis. moreover, although sulfur isnot significantly bound in dust grains in the ism, it seems to behavedifferently in dlas and in old metal-poor stars. we aim to determine precise sabundance in a sample of extremely metal-poor stars taking into account nlteand 3d effects. nlte profiles of the lines of the multiplet 1 of si have beencomputed using a new model atom for s. we find sulfur in emp stars to behavelike the other alpha-elements, with [s/fe] remaining approximately constant for[fe/h]&lt;-3. however, [s/mg] seems to decrease slightly as a function of [mg/h].the overall abundance patterns of o, na, mg, al, s, and k are best matched bythe sn model yields by heger &amp; woosley. the [s/zn] ratio in emp stars is solar,as found also in dlas. we obtain an upper limit on the abundance of sulfur,[s/fe] &lt; +0.5, for the ultra metal-poor star cs 22949-037. this, along with aprevious reported measurement of zinc, argues against the conjecture that thelight-element abundances pattern in this star, and, by analogy, the hypermetal-poor stars he 0107-5240 and he 1327-2326, are due to dust depletion.

1403.6128	on the fine structure of the cepheid metallicity gradient in the  galactic thin disk	we present homogeneous and accurate iron abundances for 42 galactic cepheidsbased on high-spectral resolution (r~38,000) high signal-to-noise ratio(snr&gt;100) optical spectra collected with uves at vlt (128 spectra). the aboveabundances were complemented with high-quality iron abundances provided eitherby our group (86) or available in the literature. we paid attention in derivinga common metallicity scale and ended up with a sample of 450 cepheids. we alsoestimated for the entire sample accurate individual distances by usinghomogeneous near-infrared photometry and the reddening free period-wesenheitrelations. the new metallicity gradient is linear over a broad range ofgalactocentric distances (rg~5-19 kpc) and agrees quite well with similarestimates available in the literature (-0.060+/-0.002 dex/kpc). we also uncoverevidence which suggests that the residuals of the metallicity gradient aretightly correlated with candidate cepheid groups (cgs). the candidate cgs havebeen identified as spatial overdensities of cepheids located across the thindisk. they account for a significant fraction of the residual fluctuations, andin turn for the large intrinsic dispersion of the metallicity gradient. weperformed a detailed comparison with metallicity gradients based on differenttracers: ob stars and open clusters. we found very similar metallicitygradients for ages younger than 3 gyrs, while for older ages we found ashallower slope and an increase in the intrinsic spread. the above findingsrely on homogeneous age, metallicity and distance scales. finally we found, byusing a large sample of galactic and magellanic cepheids for which areavailable accurate iron abundances, that the dependence of the luminosityamplitude on metallicity is vanishing.

1409.7703	vlt/flames spectroscopy of red giant branch stars in the fornax dwarf  spheroidal galaxy	fornax is one of the most massive dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the localgroup. the fornax field star population is dominated by intermediate age starsbut star formation was going on over almost its entire history. it has beenproposed that fornax experienced a minor merger event. despite recent progress,only the high metallicity end of fornax field stars ([fe/h]&gt;-1.2 dex) has beensampled in larger number via high resolution spectroscopy. we want to betterunderstand the full chemical evolution of this galaxy by better sampling thewhole metallicity range, including more metal poor stars. we use the vlt-flamesmulti-fibre spectrograph in high-resolution mode to determine the abundances ofseveral alpha, iron-peak and neutron-capture elements in a sample of 47individual red giant branch stars in the fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy. wecombine these abundances with accurate age estimates derived from the ageprobability distribution from the colour-magnitude diagram of fornax. similarto other dwarf spheroidal galaxies, the old, metal-poor stars of fornax aretypically alpha-rich while the young metal-rich stars are alpha-poor. in theclassical scenario of the time delay between sne ii and sne ia, we confirm thatsne ia started to contribute to the chemical enrichment at [fe/h] between -2.0and -1.8 dex. we find that the onset of sne ia took place between 12-10 gyrsago. the high values of [ba/fe], [la/fe] reflect the influence of sne ia andagb stars in the abundance pattern of the younger stellar population of fornax.our findings of low [alpha/fe] and enhanced [eu/mg] are compatible with aninitial mass function that lacks the most massive stars and with star formationthat kept going on throughout the whole history of fornax. we find that massivestars kept enriching the interstellar medium in alpha-elements, although theywere not the main contributor to the iron enrichment.

1410.5460	new nir light-curve templates for classical cepheids	we present new near-infrared (nir) light-curve templates for fundamental (fu,jhk) and first overtone (fo, j) cepheids. the new templates together with pland pw relations provide cepheid distances from single-epoch observations witha precision only limited by the intrinsic accuracy of the method adopted. thetemplates rely on a very large set of galactic and magellanic clouds (mcs)cepheids (fu,~600; fo,~200) with well sampled nir (irsf data) and optical (v,i;ogle data) light curves. to properly trace the change in the shape of the lightcurve as a function of period, we split the sample of calibrating cepheids into10 different period bins. the templates for the first time cover fo cepheidsand the fu short-period cepheids (p&lt;5 days). moreover, the zero-point phase isanchored to the phase of the mean magnitude along the rising branch. the newapproach has several advantages in sampling the light curve of bump cepheidswhen compared with the phase of maximum light. we also provide new estimates ofthe nir-to-optical amplitude ratios for fu and fo cepheids. we perform detailedanalytical fits using both 7th-order fourier series and multi-gaussian periodicfunctions. the latter are characterized by a smaller number of free parameters(9 vs 15). mean nir magnitudes based on the new templates are up to 80% moreaccurate than single-epoch measurements and up to 50% more accurate than meanmagnitudes based on previous templates, with typical associated uncertaintiesranging from 0.015 mag (j) to 0.019 mag (k). moreover, the errors on individualdistances of small mc cepheids derived from nir pw relations, are essentiallyreduced to the intrinsic scatter of the adopted relations. thus, the newtemplates are the ultimate tool to estimate precise cepheid distances from nirsingle-epoch observations, which can be adopted to derive the 3d structure ofthe mcs.

1503.03758	on the alpha-element gradients of the galactic thin disk using cepheids	we present new homogeneous measurements of na, al and three alpha-elements(mg, si, ca) for 75 galactic cepheids. the abundances are based on highspectral resolution (r ~ 38,000) and high signal-to-noise ratio (s/n ~ 50-300)spectra collected with uves at eso vlt. the current measurements werecomplemented with cepheid abundances either provided by our group (75) oravailable in the literature, for a total of 439 galactic cepheids. specialattention was given in providing a homogeneous abundance scale for these fiveelements plus iron (genovali et al. 2013, 2014). in addition, accurategalactocentric distances (rg) based on near-infrared photometry are alsoavailable for all the cepheids in the sample (genovali et al. 2014). they covera large fraction of the galactic thin disk (4.1 &lt;= rg &lt;= 18.4 kpc). we foundthat the above five elements display well defined linear radial gradients andmodest standard deviations over the entire range of rg. moreover, the[element/fe] abundance ratios are constant across the entire thin disk; onlythe ca radial distribution shows marginal evidence of a positive slope. theseresults indicate that the chemical enrichment history of iron and of the quotedfive elements has been quite similar across the four quadrants of the galacticthin disk. the [element/fe] ratios are also constant over the entire periodrange. this empirical evidence indicates that the chemical enrichment ofgalactic cepheids has also been very homogenous during the range in age thatthey cover (~10-300 myr). once again, [ca/fe] vs. log(p) shows a (negative)gradient, being underabundant among youngest cepheids. finally, we also foundthat cepheid abundances agree quite well with similar abundances for thin andthick disk dwarf stars and they follow the typical mg-al and na-o correlations.

1505.06597	the carina project. viii. the {\alpha}-element abundances	we have performed a new abundance analysis of carina red giant (rg) starsfrom spectroscopic data collected with uves (high resolution) andflames/giraffe (high and medium resolution) at eso/vlt. the former sampleincludes 44 rgs, while the latter consists of 65 (high) and ~800 (mediumresolution) rgs, covering a significant fraction of the galaxy's rg branch(rgb), and red clump stars. to improve the abundance analysis at the faintmagnitude limit, the flames/giraffe data were divided into ten surface gravityand effective temperature bins. the spectra of the stars belonging to the samegravity/temperature bin were stacked. this approach allowed us to increase byat least a factor of five the signal-to-noise ratio in the faint limit(v&gt;20.5mag). we took advantage of the new photometry index cu,b,i introduced bymonelli et al. (2014), as an age and probably a metallicity indicator, to splitstars along the rgb. these two stellar populations display distinct [fe/h] and[mg/h] distributions: their mean fe abundances are -2.15$\pm$0.06dex(sig=0.28), and -1.75$\pm$0.03dex (sig=0.21), respectively. the two irondistributions differ at the 75% level. this supports preliminary results bylemasle et al. (2012) and by monelli et al. (2014). moreover, we found that theold and intermediate-age stellar populations have mean [mg/h] abundances of-1.91$\pm$0.05dex (sig=0.22) and -1.35$\pm$0.03dex (sig=0.22); these differ atthe 83% level. carina's {\alpha}-element abundances agree, within 1sigma, withsimilar abundances for field halo stars and for cluster (galactic, magellanic)stars. the same outcome applies to nearby dwarf spheroidals and ultra-faintdwarf galaxies, in the iron range covered by carina stars. finally, we foundevidence of a clear correlation between na and o abundances, thus suggestingthat carina's chemical enrichment history is quite different than in theglobular clusters.

0705.2330	tracing mixing in stars: new beryllium observations of the open clusters  ngc 2516, hyades, and m67	determinations of beryllium abundance in stars, together with lithium,provide a key tool to investigate the so far poorly understood extra-mixingprocesses at work in stellar interiors. we measured be in three openclusters,complementing existing be surveys, and aiming at gathering a morecomplete empirical scenario of the evolution of be as a function of stellar ageand temperature. specifically, we analyzed vlt/uves spectra of members of ngc2516, the hyades, and m 67 to determine their be and li abundances. in thefirst two clusters we focused on stars cooler than 5400 k, while the m 67sample includes stars warmer than 6150 k, as well as two subgiants and two bluestragglers. we also computed the evolution of be for a 0.9 mo star based onstandard evolutionary models. we find different emprical behaviours for starsin different temperature bins and ages. stars warmer than 6150 k show bedepletion and follow a be vs. li correlation while be is undepleted in stars inthe ~6150-5600 k range. ngc 2516 members cooler than 5400 k have not depletedany be, but older hyades of similar temperature do show some depletion. be isseverely depleted in the subgiants and blue stragglers. the results for warmstars are in agreement with previous studies, supporting the hypothesis thatmixing in this temperature regime is driven by rotation. the same holds for thetwo subgiants that have evolved from the "li gap". this mechanism is insteadnot the dominant one for solar-type stars. we show that be depletion of coolhyades cannot simply be explained by the effect of increasing depth of theconvective zone. finally, the different be content of the two blue stragglerssuggests that they have formed by two different processes (i.e., collisions vs.binary merging).

1510.06314	on the neutron-capture elements across the galactic thin disk using  cepheids	we present new accurate abundances for five neutron-capture (y, la, ce, nd,eu) elements in 73 classical cepheids located across the galactic thin disk.individual abundances are based on high spectral resolution (r ~ 38,000) andhigh signal-to-noise ratio (s/n ~ 50-300) spectra collected with uves at esovlt for the dionysos project. taking account for similar cepheid abundancesprovided either by our group (111 stars) or available in the literature, we endup with a sample of 435 cepheids covering a broad range in iron abundances(-1.6 &lt; [fe/h] &lt; 0.6). we found, using homogeneous individual distances andabundance scales, well defined gradients for the above elements. however, theslope of the light s-process element (y) is at least a factor of two steeperthan the slopes of heavy s- (la, ce, nd) and r- (eu) process elements. the s tor abundance ratio ([la/eu]) of cepheids shows a well defined anticorrelationwith of both eu and fe. on the other hand, galactic field stars attain analmost constant value and only when they approach solar iron abundance displaya mild enhancement in la. the [y/eu] ratio shows a mild evidence of acorrelation with eu and, in particular, with iron abundance for field galacticstars. we also investigated the s-process index - [hs/ls] - and we found a welldefined anticorrelation, as expected, between [la/y] and iron abundance.moreover, we found a strong correlation between [la/y] and [la/fe] and, inparticular, a clear separation between galactic and sagittarius red giants.finally, the comparison between predictions for low-mass asymptotic giantbranch stars and the observed [la/y] ratio indicate a very good agreement overthe entire metallicity range covered by cepheids. however, the observed spread,at fixed iron content, is larger than predicted by current models.

0807.1196	the influence of chemical composition on the properties of cepheid  stars. ii-the iron content	the cepheid period-luminosity (pl) relation is unquestionably one of the mostpowerful tools at our disposal for determining the extragalactic distancescale. while significant progress has been made in the past few years towardsits understanding and characterization both on the observational andtheoretical sides, the debate on the influence that chemical composition mayhave on the pl relation is still unsettled. with the aim to assess theinfluence of the stellar iron content on the pl relation in the v and k bands,we have related the v-band and the k-band residuals from the standard plrelations of freedman et al. (2001) and persson et al. (2004), respectively, to[fe/h]. we used direct measurements of the iron abundances of 68 galactic andmagellanic cepheids from feros and uves high-resolution and highsignal-to-noise spectra. we find a mean iron abundance ([fe/h]) about solar(sigma = 0.10) for our galactic sample (32 stars), -0.33 dex (sigma = 0.13) forthe large magellanic cloud (lmc) sample (22 stars) and -0.75 dex (sigma = 0.08)for the small magellanic cloud (smc) sample (14 stars). our abundancemeasurements of the magellanic cepheids double the number of stars studied upto now at high resolution. the metallicity affects the v-band cepheid plrelation and metal-rich cepheids appear to be systematically fainter thanmetal-poor ones. these findings depend neither on the adopted distance scalefor galactic cepheids nor on the adopted lmc distance modulus. current data donot allow us to reach a firm conclusion concerning the metallicity dependenceof the k-band pl relation. the new galactic distances indicate a small effect,whereas the old ones support a marginal effect.

astro-ph;0104357	measurement of stellar age from uranium decay	the ages of the oldest stars in the galaxy indicate when star formationbegan, and provide a minimum age for the universe. radioactive dating ofmeteoritic material and stars relies on comparing the present abundance ratiosof radioactive and stable nuclear species to the theoretically predicted ratiosof their production. the radioisotope $^{232}$th (half-life 14 gyr) has beenused to date galactic stars, but it decays by only a factor of two over thelifetime of the universe. $^{238}$u (half-life 4.5 gyr) is in principle a moreprecise age indicator, but even its strongest spectral line, from singlyionized uranium at a wavelength of 385.957 nm, has previously not been detectedin stars. here we report a measurement of this line in the very metal-poor starcs31082-001, a star which is strongly overabundant in its heavy elements. thederived uranium abundance, log(u/h) = -13.7+/-0.14+/-0.12 yields an age of12.5+/-3 gyr, though this is still model dependent. the observation of thiscosmochronometer gives the most direct age determination of the galaxy. also,with improved theoretical and laboratory data, it will provide a highly preciselower limit to the age of the universe.

astro-ph;0203462	the extreme r-element rich, iron-poor halo giant cs31082-001:  implications for the r-process site(s) and radioactive cosmochronology	we present a high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of the bright (v=11.7),extreme halo giant cs31082-001 ([fe/h] = -2.9), obtained in an eso-vlt largeprogramme dedicated to very metal-poor stars. we find cs31082-001 to beextremely rich in r-process elements, comparable in this respect only to thesimilarly metal-poor, but carbon-enriched, giant cs22892-052. as a result ofthe extreme overabundance of the heaviest r-process elements, and negligibleblending from ch and cn molecular lines, a reliable measurement is obtained ofthe u ii line at 386 nm, for the first time in a halo star, along with numerouslines of th ii, as well as lines of 25 other r-process elements. abundanceestimates for a total of 43 elements are reported in cs31082-001, almost halfof the entire periodic table. all elements with 56 \leq z \leq 72 follow thesolar r-element pattern, reduced by about 1.25 dex ([r/fe]=+1.7 dex, a factor50). pb, in contrast, seems to be below the shifted solar r-processdistribution, possibly indicating an error in the latter, while thorium is moreenhanced than the lighter nuclides. thus, while a universal production ratiofor the r-process elements seems to hold in the interval 56 \leq z \leq 72, itbreaks down in the actinide region. when available, the u/th is thus preferableto th/eu for radioactive dating: (i) because of its faster decay rate andsmaller sensitivity to observational errors, and (ii) because the initalproduction ratio of the neighboring nuclides 238u and 232th is more robustlypredicted than the 151eu/232th ratio. our current best estimate for the age ofcs31082-001 is 14.0+/-2.4 gyr.

astro-ph;0310217	determining the metallicity of cepheid stars in the smc, lmc and the  galaxy	the cepheid period-luminosity relation is unquestionably one of the mostpowerful tools at our disposal for determining the extragalactic distancescale. while significant progress has been made in the past few years towardsits understanding and characterisation, both on the observational (e.g. the hstkey project) and theoretical (e.g. non-linear pulsation models, non-lteatmospheres etc.) sides, the debate on the influence that chemical compositionmay have on the period-luminosity relation is still unsettled. currentestimates lead to differences in the distance as large as 15%, effectivelylimiting the accuracy of cepheids as distance indicators.  to further tackle this problem, we have obtained high resolution spectra of alarge sample of cepheids in our galaxy and the magellanic clouds. the superbquality of the data allow us to probe the detailed effects of chemicalcomposition (alpha, iron-group, and heavy elements) over more than a factor often in metallicity. here, we present the first preliminary results of theanalysis of iron abundances in a sub-sample of cepheids.

astro-ph;0310291	first stars iv.cs 29497-030: evidence for operation of the s-process at  very low metallicity	we present an abundance analysis of the very metal-poor, carbon-enhanced starcs 29497-030. our results indicate that this unusually hot turnoff star (teff =6650k, log g = 3.5) has a metallicity [fe/h] = -2.8, and exhibits largeoverabundances of carbon ([c/fe] = +2.38), nitrogen ([n/fe]= +1.88), and oxygen([o/fe]= +1.67). this star also exhibits a large enhancement in itsneutron-capture elements; the pattern follows that expected to arise from thes-process. in particular, the pb abundance is found to be very high withrespect to iron ([pb/fe]= +3.5), and also with respect to the second peaks-process elements (e.g., ba, la, ce, nd), which fits into the newly introducedclassification of lead (pb) stars. the known spectroscopic binary status ofthis star, along with the observed s-process abundance pattern, suggest that ithas accreted matter from a companion, which formerly was an asymptoticgiant-branch(agb) star. in a preliminary analysis, we have also identifiedbroad absorption lines of metallic species that suggest a large axialrotational velocity for this star, which may be the result of spin-upassociated with the accretion of material from its previous agb companion. inaddition, this star is clearly depleted in the light element li. whenconsidered along with its rather high inferred temperature, these observationsare consistent with the expected properties of a very low metallicity halo bluestraggler.

0810.0205	galactic abundance gradients from cepheids : on the iron abundance  gradient around 10-12 kpc	context: classical cepheids can be adopted to trace the chemical evolution ofthe galactic disk since their distances can be estimated with very highaccuracy. aims: homogeneous iron abundance measurements for 33 galacticcepheids located in the outer disk together with accurate distancedeterminations based on near-infrared photometry are adopted to constrain thegalactic iron gradient beyond 10 kpc. methods: iron abundances were determinedusing high resolution cepheid spectra collected with three differentobservational instruments: espadons@cfht, narval@tbl and feros@2.2m eso/mpgtelescope. cepheid distances were estimated using near-infrared (j,h,k-band)period-luminosity relations and data from saao and the 2mass catalog. results:the least squares solution over the entire data set indicates that the irongradient in the galactic disk presents a slope of -0.052+/-0.003 dex/kpc in the5-17 kpc range. however, the change of the iron abundance across the disk seemsto be better described by a linear regime inside the solar circle and aflattening of the gradient toward the outer disk (beyond 10 kpc). in the latterregion the iron gradient presents a shallower slope, i.e. -0.012+/-0.014dex/kpc. in the outer disk (10-12 kpc) we also found that cepheids present anincrease in the spread in iron abundance. current evidence indicates that thespread in metallicity depends on the galactocentric longitude. finally, currentdata do not support the hypothesis of a discontinuity in the iron gradient atgalactocentric distances of 10-12 kpc. conclusions: the occurrence of a spreadin iron abundance as a function of the galactocentric longitude indicates thatlinear radial gradients should be cautiously treated to constrain the chemicalevolution across the disk.

0810.4832	stellar abundances and ages for metal-rich milky way globular clusters -  stellar parameters and elemental abundances for 9 hb stars in ngc6352	[abridged] metal-rich globular clusters provide important tracers of theformation of our galaxy. moreover, and not less important, they are veryimportant calibrators for the derivation of properties of extra-galacticmetal-rich stellar populations. nonetheless, only a few of the metal-richglobular clusters in the milky way have been studied using high-resolutionstellar spectra to derive elemental abundances. in this paper we presentelemental abundances for nine hb stars in the metal-rich globular clusterngc6352. the elemental abundances are based on high-resolution, highsignal-to-noise spectra obtained with vlt/uves. the elemental abundances havebeen derived using standard lte calculations. we find that ngc6352 has [fe/h]=-0.55, is enhanced in the alpha-elements to about +0.2 dex for ca, si, and tirelative to fe. for the iron-peak elements we find solar values. based on thespectroscopically derived stellar parameters we find that an e(b-v)=0.24 and(m-m) roughly equal to 14.05 better fits the data than the nominal values. aninvestigation of log(gf)-values for suitable fei lines lead us to theconclusion that the commonly used correction to the may et al.(1974) datashould not be employed. note: only the postscript reproduces the finding chartcorrectly.
