0910.1352	local lyman break galaxy analogs: the impact of massive star-forming  clumps on the interstellar medium and the global structure of young, forming  galaxies	we present hst uv/optical imaging, spitzer mid-ir photometry, and opticalspectroscopy of a sample of 30 low-redshift (z=0.1-0.3) galaxies chosen fromsdss/galex to be accurate local analogs of the high-z lyman break galaxies. thelyman break analogs (lbas) are similar in mass, metallicity, dust, sfr, sizeand gas velocity dispersion, thus enabling a detailed investigation ofprocesses that are important at high-z. the optical emission line properties oflbas are also similar to those of lbgs, indicating comparable conditions intheir ism. in the uv, lbas are characterized by complexes of massivestar-forming "clumps", while in the optical they most often show evidence for(post-)mergers/interactions. in 6 cases, we find an extremely massive (&gt;10^9msun) compact (r~100 pc) dominant central object (dco). the dcos arepreferentially found in lbas with the highest mid-ir luminosities andcorrespondingly high sfrs (15-100 msun/yr). we show that the massive sf clumps(including the dcos) have masses much larger than the nuclear super starclusters seen in normal late type galaxies. however, the dcos have masses,sizes, and densities similar to the excess-light/central-cusps seen in typicalelliptical galaxies with masses similar to the lba galaxies. we suggest thatthe dcos form in present-day examples of the dissipative mergers at highredshift that are believed to have produced the central-cusps in localellipticals. more generally, the properties of the lbas are consistent with theidea that instabilities in a gas-rich disk lead to very massive star-formingclumps that eventually coalesce to form a spheroid. we speculate that the dcosare too young at present to be growing a supermassive black hole because theyare still in a supernova-dominated outflow phase.

0911.1279	morphologies of local lyman break galaxy analogs ii: a comparison with  galaxies at z=2-4 in acs and wfc3 images of the hubble ultra deep field	lyman break galaxies (lbgs) display a range in structures (fromsingle/compact to clumpy/extended) that is different from typical localstar-forming galaxies. recently, we have introduced a sample of rare, nearby(z&lt;0.3) starbursts that appear to be good analogs of lbgs. these "lyman breakanalogs" (lbas) provide an excellent training set for understanding starburstsat different redshifts. we present an application of this by comparing therest-frame uv/optical morphologies of 30 lbas with those of sbzk galaxies atz~2, and lbgs at z~3-4 in the hudf. the uv/optical colors and sizes of lbas andlbgs are very similar, while the bzk galaxies are somewhat redder and larger.there is significant overlap between the morphologies (g, c, a and m_20) of thelocal and high-z samples, although the latter are somewhat less concentratedand clumpier. we find that in the majority of lbas the starbursts appear to betriggered by interactions/mergers. when the images of the lbas are degraded tothe same sensitivity and resolution as the images of lbgs and bzk galaxies,these relatively faint asymmetric features are no longer detectable. thiseffect is particularly severe in the rest-frame uv. it has been suggested thathigh-z galaxies experience intense bursts unlike anything seen locally,possibly due to cold flows and instabilities. in part, this is based on thefact that the majority (~70%) of lbgs do not show morphological signatures ofmergers. our results suggest that this evidence is insufficient, since a largefraction of such signatures would likely have been missed in currentobservations of z&gt;2 galaxies. this leaves open the possibility that clumpyaccretion and mergers remain important in driving the evolution of thesestarbursts, together with rapid gas accretion through other means.

0912.0192	the cluster terzan 5 as a remnant of a primordial building block of the  galactic bulge	globular star clusters are compact and massive stellar systems old enough tohave witnessed the entire history of our galaxy, the milky way. although recentresults suggest that their formation may have been more complex than previouslythought, they still are the best approximation to a stellar population formedover a relatively short time scale (less than 1 gyr) and with virtually nodispersion in the iron content. indeed, only one cluster-like system (omegacentauri) in the galactic halo is known to have multiple stellar populationswith a significant spread in iron abundance and age4,5. similar findings in thegalactic bulge have been hampered by the obscuration arising from thick andvarying layers of interstellar dust. here we report that terzan 5, aglobular-cluster-like system in the galactic bulge, has two stellar populationswith different iron content and ages. terzan 5 could be the surviving remnantof one of the primordial building blocks that are thought to merge and formgalaxy bulges.

0707.2896	the galex uv emission in shell galaxies: tracing galaxy "rejuvenation"  episodes	we present the galex far fuv and near nuv ultraviolet imaging of three nearbyshell galaxies, namely ngc 2865, ngc 5018 and ngc 7135. the system of shellsand fine structures visible in the optical is detected in the nuv image of ngc2865 and in both nuv and fuv images of ngc 7135. the nuv image of ngc 5018 doesnot present shell structures. we detect absorption features in the nuclearregion of all three galaxies. ngc 2865 has a nearly flat colour profile with(fuv-nuv)~2 throughout the whole galaxy. ngc 7135 is blue in the center(fuv-nuv)~0 and as red as (fuv-nuv)~1.5 in the outskirts, including the faintshell-like feature. we investigate the ability of the nuclear galex (fuv-nuv)colour to provide information about rejuvenation phenomena in the stellarpopulations of the shell galaxies. to this aim, we derive from theory therelationship between the mg2, hbeta, hgammaa, hdeltaa lick line-strengthindices and the (fuv-nuv) colour. we extend the study to a sample of early-typegalaxies with emission lines in their optical spectra (annibali et al. 2007).in the index vs.(fuv-nuv) colour diagrams, most of the galaxies are wellexplained by passively evolving ssps. on the average, ages and metallicities ofthe galaxies in our sample estimated from optical line-strength indices areconsistent with those inferred from the (fuv-nuv) colour. in general, all thecolours but for (fuv-nuv) and (fuv-v), become nearly age insensitive when 1-2gyr have elapsed from the last star forming event. considering compositestellar population models with a recent burst of star formation, we suggestthat the position of the ngc 7135 and ngc 2865 nuclei in the (fuv-nuv)-hbetaplane could be explained in term of a recent rejuvenation episode.

0707.3415	uv to ir seds of uv selected galaxies in the elais fields: evolution of  dust attenuation and star formation activity from z=0.7 to z=0.2	we study the ultraviolet to far-infrared (hereafter uv-to-ir) seds of asample of intermediate redshift (0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.7) uv-selected galaxies from theelais-n1 and elais-n2 fields by fitting a multi-wavelength dataset to a libraryof grasil templates. star formation related properties of the galaxies arederived from the library of models by using the bayesian statistics. we find adecreasing presence of galaxies with low attenuation and low total luminosityas redshift decreases, which does not hold for high total luminosity galaxies.in addition the dust attenuation of low mass galaxies increases as redshiftdecreases, and this trend seems to disappear for galaxies with m* &gt; 10^11m_sun. this result is consistent with a mass dependent evolution of the dust togas ratio, which could be driven by a mass dependent efficiency of starformation in star forming galaxies. the specific star formation rates (ssfr)decrease with increasing stellar mass at all redshifts, and for a given stellarmass the ssfr decreases with decreasing redshift. the differences in the slopeof the m*--ssfr relation found between this work and others at similar redshiftcould be explained by the adopted selection criteria of the samples which, fora uv selected sample, favours blue, star forming galaxies.

1003.6114	a radial velocity and calcium triplet abundance survey of field small  magellanic cloud giants	we present the results of a pilot wide-field radial velocity and metalabundance survey of red giants in ten fields in the small magellanic cloud(smc). the targets lie at projected distances of 0.9 and 1.9 kpc from the smccentre ($m-m=18.79$) to the north, east, south and west. two more fields are tothe east at distances of 3.9 and 5.1 kpc. in this last field we find only a fewto no smc giants, suggesting that the edge of the smc in this direction liesapproximately at 6 kpc from its centre. in all eastern fields we observe adouble peak in the radial velocities of stars, with a component at theclassical smc recession velocity of $\sim 160$ km s$^{-1}$ and a high velocitycomponent at about 200 km s$^{-1}$, similar to observations in h{\small i}. inthe most distant field (3.9 kpc) the low velocity component is at 106 kms$^{-1}$. the metal abundance distribution in all fields is broad and centredat about [fe/h] $\sim -1.25$, reaching to solar and possibly slightlysupersolar values and down to [fe/h] of about -2.5. in the two innermost (0.9kpc) northern and southern fields we observe a secondary peak at metallicitiesof about $\sim -0.6$. this may be evidence of a second episode of starformation in the centre, possibly triggered by the interactions that createdthe stream and bridge.

0708.4026	the evolution of oxygen and magnesium in the bulge and disk of the milky  way	we show that the galactic bulge and disk share a similar, strong, decline in[o/mg] ratio with [mg/h]. the similarity of the [o/mg] trend in these two,markedly different, populations suggests a metallicity-dependent modulation ofthe stellar yields from massive stars, by mass loss from winds, and related tothe wolf-rayet phenomenon, as proposed by mcwilliam &amp; rich (2004). we havemodified existing models for the chemical evolution of the galactic bulge andthe solar neighborhood with the inclusion of metallicity-dependent oxygenyields from theoretical predictions for massive stars that include mass loss bystellar winds. our results significantly improve the agreement betweenpredicted and observed [o/mg] ratios in the bulge and disk above solarmetallicity; however, a small zero-point normalization problem remains to beresolved. the zero-point shift indicates that either the semi-empirical yieldsof francois et al. (2004) need adjustment, or that the bulge imf is not quiteas flat as found by ballero et al. (2007); the former explanation is preferred.our result removes a previous inconsistency between the interpretation of[o/fe] and [mg/fe] ratios in the bulge, and confirms the conclusion that thebulge formed more rapidly than the disk, based on the over-abundances ofelements produced by massive stars. we also provide an explanation for thelong-standing difference between [mg/fe] and [o/fe] trends among disk starsmore metal-rich than the sun.

1010.5276	the kinematic identification of a thick stellar disc in m31	we present the first characterization of a thick disc component in theandromeda galaxy (m31) using kinematic data from the deimos multi-objectspectrograph instrument on keck ii. using 21 fields in the south west of thegalaxy, we measure the lag of this component with respect to the thin disc, aswell as the dispersion, metallicity and scale length of the component. we findan average lag between the two components of &lt;dv&gt;=46.0+/-3.9km/s. the velocitydispersion of the thick disc is sigma_{thick}=50.8+/-1.9km/s, greater than thevalue of dispersion we determine for the thin disc,sigma_{thin}=35.7+/-1.0km/s. the thick disc is more metal poor than the thindisc, with [fe/h]_{spec}=-1.0+/-0.1 compared to [fe/h]_{spec}=-0.7+/-0.05 forthe thin disc. we measure a radial scale length of the thin and thick discs ofh_r=7.3+/-1.0 kpc and h_r=8.0+/-1.2 kpc. from this, we infer scale heights forboth discs of 1.1+/-0.2 kpc and 2.8+/-0.6 kpc, both of which are ~2--3 timeslarger than those observed in the milky way. we estimate a mass range for thethick disc component of 2.4x10^{10}msun&lt; m_{*,thick} &lt;4.1x10^{10}msun. thisvalue provides a useful constraint on possible formation mechanisms, as anyproposed method for forming a thick disc must be able to heat (or deposit) atleast this amount of material.

1012.2047	spectroscopy unveils the complex nature of terzan 5	we present the chemical abundance analysis of 33 red giant stars belonging tothe complex stellar system terzan 5. we confirm the discovery of two stellarpopulations (ferraro et al. 2009, nature, 462,483) with distinct ironabundances: a relatively metal-poor component with [fe/h]=-0.25 +/- 0.07r.m.s., and another component with [fe/h]=+0.27 +/- 0.04 r.m.s., exceeding inmetallicity any known galactic globular cluster. the two populations also showdifferent [alpha/fe] abundance ratios. the metal-poor component has an average[alpha/fe]=+0.34 +/- 0.06 r.m.s., consistent with the canonical scenario forrapid enrichment by core collapse supernovae (sne). the metal-rich componenthas [alpha/fe]=+0.03 +/-i 0.04 r.m.s., suggesting that the gas from which itformed was polluted by both type ii and type ia sne on a longer timescale.neither of the two populations shows evidence of the [al/fe] over [o/fe]anti-correlation, that is typically observed in galactic globular clusters.because these chemical abundance patterns are unique, we propose that terzan 5is not a true globular cluster, but a stellar system with a much more complexhistory of star formation and chemical enrichment.

1103.2121	the scatter about the "universal" dwarf spheroidal mass profile: a  kinematic study of the m31 satellites, and v and and vi	while the satellites of the milky way (mw) have been shown to be largelyconsistent in terms of their mass contained within one half--light radius(m_{half}) with a "universal" mass profile, a number of m31 satellites arefound to be inconsistent with such relations, and seem kinematically colder intheir central regions than their mw cousins. in this work, we present newkinematic and updated structural properties for two m31 dsphs, and v and and viusing data from the keck low resolution imaging spectrograph (lris) and thedeep imaging multi-object spectrograph (deimos) instruments and the subarusuprime-cam imager. we measure systemic velocities of v_r=-393.1+/-4.2km/s and-344.8+/-2.5km/s, and dispersions of sigma_v=11.5{+5.3}{-4.4}km/s andsigma_v=9.4{+3.2}{-2.4}km/s for and v and and vi respectively, meaning thesetwo objects are consistent with the trends in sigma_v and r_{half} set by theirmw counterparts. we also investigate the nature of this scatter about the mwdsph mass profiles for the "classical" (i.e. m_v&lt;-8) mw and m31 dsphs. whencomparing both the "classical" mw and m31 dsphs to the best--fit mass profilesin the size--velocity dispersion plane, we find general scatter in both thepositive (i.e. hotter) and negative (i.e. colder) directions from theseprofiles. however, barring one exception (cvni) only the m31 dsphs are found toscatter towards a colder regime, and, excepting the and i dsph, only mw objectsscatter to hotter dispersions. we also note that the scatter for the combinedpopulation is greater than expected from measurement errors alone. we assessthis divide in the context of the differing disc-to-halo mass (i.e. stars andbaryons to total virial mass) ratios of the two hosts and argue that theunderlying mass profiles for dsphs differ from galaxy to galaxy, and aremodified by the baryonic component of the host.

1103.5771	star cluster formation and evolution in mrk 930: properties of a  metal-poor starburst	we present a hst multiband analysis of the large population of star clustersin the blue compact galaxy (bcg) mrk 930. we have reconstructed the spectralenergy distributions of the star clusters and estimated age, mass, andextinction for a representative sample. we observe a very young clusterpopulation with 70% of the systems formed less than 10 myr ago. the peak in thestar cluster age distribution at 4 myr is corroborated by the presence ofwolf-rayet spectral features, and by the observed optical and ir lines ratios[oiii]/h_beta and [neiii]/[neii]. the recovered extinction in these very youngclusters shows large variations, with a decrease at older ages. it is likelythat our analysis is limited to the optically brightest objects (i.e. systemsonly partially embedded in their natal cocoons). we map the extinction acrossthe galaxy using low-resolution spectra and the h_alpha/h_beta ratio, asobtained from ground-based narrow band imaging. we find that the mean opticalextinction derived in the starburst regions is close to the averaged valueobserved in the clusters, but locally, do not trace the more extinguishedclusters. previous hst studies of bcgs have revealed a population of young andextremely red super star clusters. we detect a considerable fraction ofclusters affected by a red excess also in mrk 930. the nature of the redexcess, which turns up at near-ir wavelengths remains unknown. we compare thecluster and the star formation history, the latter derived from the fit ofspectral population synthesis models to the spectra. we find a generalagreement between the two independently estimated quantities. using the clusterproperties we perform a study of the host environmental properties. we findthat the cluster formation efficiency is significantly higher, suggesting a keyrole of the environment for the formation of these massive objects.[abridged]

1202.5112	an hst search for planets in the lower main sequence of the globular  cluster ngc 6397	searches for planetary transits carried out in open and globular clustershave yielded to date only a handful of weak, unconfirmed candidates. theseresults have been interpreted either as being insignificant, or as evidencethat the cluster chemical or dynamical environment inhibits the planetaryformation or survival. most campaigns were limited by small sample statisticsor systematics from ground-based photometry. in this work we performed a searchfor transiting planets and variables in a deep stellar field of ngc 6397 imagedby hst-acs for 126 orbits. we analyzed 5,078 light curves, including a puresample of 2,215 cluster-member m0-m9 dwarfs. the light curves have beencorrected for systematic trends and inspected with several tools. nohigh-significance planetary candidate is detected. we compared this nulldetection with the most recent results from kepler, showing that no conclusiveevidence of lower planet incidence can be drawn. however, a very smallphotometric jitter is measured for early-m cluster members (&lt;~2 mmag on 98% ofthem), which may be worth targeting in the near future with more optimizedcampaigns. twelve variable stars are reported for the first time.

1203.6081	the recent stellar archeology of m31 - the nearest red disk galaxy	we examine the star-forming history (sfh) of the m31 disk during the past fewhundred myr. the luminosity functions (lfs) of main sequence stars at distancesr_gc &gt; 21 kpc (i.e. &gt; 4 disk scale lengths) are matched by models that assume aconstant star formation rate (sfr). however, at smaller r_gc the lfs suggestthat during the past ~10 myr the sfr was 2 - 3 times higher than during thepreceding ~100 myr. the rings of cool gas that harbor a significant fraction ofthe current star-forming activity are traced by stars with ages ~100 myr,indicating that (1) these structures have ages of at least 100 myr, and (2)stars in these structures do not follow the same relation between age andrandom velocity as their counterparts throughout the disks of other spiralgalaxies, probably due to the inherently narrow orbital angular momentumdistribution of the giant molecular clouds in these structures. thedistribution of evolved red stars is not azimuthally symmetric, in the sensethat their projected density along the north east segment of the major axis isroughly twice that on the opposite side of the galaxy. the north east arm ofthe major axis thus appears to be a fossil star-forming area that dates tointermediate epochs. such a structure may be the consequence of interactionswith a companion galaxy.

0711.4059	planets in the galactic bulge: results from the sweeps project	the exoplanets discovered so far have been mostly around relatively nearbyand bright stars. as a result, the host stars are mostly (i) in the galacticdisk, (ii) relatively massive, and (iii) relatively metal rich. the aim of thesweeps project is to extend our knowledge to stars which (i) are in a differentpart of the galaxy, (ii) have lower masses, and (iii) have a large range ofmetallicities. to achieve this goal, we used the hubble space telescope tosearch for transiting planets around f, g, k, and m dwarfs in the galacticbulge. we photometrically monitored 180,000 stars in a dense bulge fieldcontinuously for 7 days. we discovered 16 candidate transiting extrasolarplanets with periods of 0.6 to 4.2 days, including a new class of ultra-shortperiod planets (uspps) with p &lt; 1.2 days. radial-velocity observations of thetwo brightest candidates support their planetary nature. these results suggestthat planets are as abundant in the galactic bulge as they are in the solarneighborhood, and they are equally abundant around low-mass stars (within afactor 2). the planet frequency increases with metallicity even for the starsin the galactic bulge. all the uspp hosts are low-mass stars, suggesting eitherthat close-in planets around higher-mass stars are irradiatively evaporated, orthat the planets can migrate to close-in orbits only around such old andlow-mass stars.

1209.4901	an empirical measure of the rate of white dwarf cooling in 47 tucanae	we present an empirical determination of the white dwarf cooling sequence inthe globular cluster 47 tucanae. using spectral models, we determinetemperatures for 887 objects from wide field camera 3 data, as well as 292objects from data taken with the advanced camera for surveys. we make theassumption that the rate of white dwarf formation in the cluster is constant.stellar evolution models are then used to determine the rate at which objectsare leaving the main sequence, which must be the same as the rate at whichobjects are arriving on the white dwarf sequence in our field. the result is anempirically derived relation between temperature ($t_{eff}$) and time ($t$) onthe white dwarf cooling sequence. comparing this result to theoretical coolingmodels, we find general agreement with the expected slopes between 20,000k and30,000k and between 6,000k and 20,000k, but the transition to the mestelcooling rate of $t_{eff} \propto t^{-0.4}$ is found to occur at hottertemperatures, and more abruptly than is predicted by any of these models.

0711.4588	kinematic and chemical constraints on the formation of m31's inner and  outer halo	the halo of m31 shows a wealth of substructures that are consistent withsatellite accretion. here we report on kinematic and abundance results fromkeck/deimos spectroscopy in the calcium triplet region of over 3500 red giantstar candidates along the minor axis and in off-axis spheroid fields of m31.our data reach out to large radial distances of 160 kpc. the derived velocitydistributions show a kinematically cold substructure at 17 kpc that has beenreported before. we devise an improved method to measure accurate metallicitiesfrom the calcium triplet in low signal-to-noise spectra using a coaddition ofthe individual lines. the resulting distribution leads us to note an evenstronger gradient in the abundance distribution along m31's minor axis thanpreviously detected. the mean metallicity in the outer halo reaches below -2dex, with individual values as low as -2.6 dex. in the inner spheroid, at 17-19kpc, we find a sharp decline of ~0.5 dex in metallicity, which roughlycoincides with the edge of an extended disk, previously detected from starcount maps. a large fraction of red giants in the most distant fields arelikely members of m33's overlapping halo. a comparison of our velocities withthose predicted by new n-body simulations argues that the event responsible forthe giant stream is most likely not responsible for the full population of theinner halo; we show further that the abundance distribution of the stream isdifferent from that of the inner halo, from which it becomes evident that themerger event that formed the outer halo cannot have contributed any significantmaterial to the inner spheroid. all this evidence of severe structure changesin the halo suggests a high degree of infall and stochastic abundance accretiongoverning the build-up of m31's halo.

1210.0826	deep hst imaging in ngc 6397: stellar dynamics	multi-epoch observations with acs on hst provide a unique and comprehensiveprobe of stellar dynamics within ngc 6397. we are able to confront analyticmodels of the globular cluster with the observed stellar proper motions. themeasured proper motions probe well along the main sequence from 0.8 to below0.1 m$_\odot$ as well as white dwarfs younger than one gigayear. the observedfield lies just beyond the half-light radius where standard models of globularcluster dynamics (e.g. based on a lowered maxwellian phase-space distribution)make very robust predictions for the stellar proper motions as a function ofmass. the observed proper motions show no evidence for anisotropy in thevelocity distribution; furthermore, the observations agree in detail with astraightforward model of the stellar distribution function. we do not find anyevidence that the young white dwarfs have received a natal kick incontradiction with earlier results. using the observed proper motions of themain-sequence stars, we obtain a kinematic estimate of the distance to ngc 6397of $2.2^{+0.5}_{-0.7}$ kpc and a mass of the cluster of $1.1 \pm 0.1 \times10^5 \mathrm{m}_\odot$ at the photometric distance of 2.53 kpc. one of themain-sequence stars appears to travel on a trajectory that will escape thecluster, yielding an estimate of the evaporation timescale, over which thenumber of stars in the cluster decreases by a factor of e, of about 3 gyr. theproper motions of the youngest white dwarfs appear to resemble those of themost massive main-sequence stars, providing the first direct constraint on therelaxation time of the stars in a globular cluster of greater than or about 0.7gyr.

1307.6282	uv-bright nearby early type galaxies observed in the mid-infrared:  evidence for a multi-stage formation history by way of wise and galex imaging	in the local universe, 10% of massive elliptical galaxies are observed toexhibit a peculiar property: a substantial excess of ultraviolet emission (uvx)over what is expected from their old, red stellar populations. several originsfor the uvx have been proposed, including a population of hot young stars, or apopulation of old, blue horizontal branch or extended horizontal branch (bhb orehb) stars that have undergone substantial mass loss from their outeratmospheres. we explore the radial distribution of ultraviolet excess (uvx) ina selection of 49 nearby e/s0-type galaxies by measuring the extendedphotometry in the uv-midir with galex, sdss and wise. we compare uv/optical anduv/mid-ir colors with the flexible stellar population synthesis with ehb models(conroy &amp; gunn 2010). we find that combined wise mid-ir and galex uv colors aremore effective in distinguishing models than optical colors, and that theuv/mid-ir combination is sensitive to ehb fraction. there are strong colorgradients with the outer radii bluer than the inner half-light radii by ~1magnitude. this color difference is easily accounted for with a bhb fractionincrease of 0.25 with radius. we estimated the average ages for the inner andouter radii are 7.0+/-0.3 gyr, and 6.2+/-0.2 gyr, respectively, with theimplication that the outer regions are likely to have formed ~1 gyr after theinner regions. additionally, we find that metallicity gradients are likely nota significant factor in the color difference. the separation of color betweenthe inner and outer regions, which agrees with a specific stellar populationdifference (e.g., higher ehb populations), and the ~0.5-2 gyr age differencesuggests multi-stage formation. our results are best explained by inside-outformation: rapid star formation within the core at early epochs (&gt;4 gyr ago)and at least one later stage starburst event coinciding with z~1

1308.0032	an age difference of 2 gyr between a metal-rich and a metal-poor  globular cluster	globular clusters trace the formation history of the spheroidal components ofboth our galaxy and others, which represent the bulk of star formation over thehistory of the universe. they also exhibit a range of metallicities, withmetal-poor clusters dominating the stellar halo of the galaxy, and highermetallicity clusters found within the inner galaxy, associated with the stellarbulge, or the thick disk. age differences between these clusters can indicatethe sequence in which the components of the galaxy formed, and in particularwhich clusters were formed outside the galaxy and later swallowed along withtheir original host galaxies, and which were formed in situ. here we present anage determination of the metal-rich globular cluster 47 tucanae by fitting theproperties of the cluster white dwarf population, which implies an absolute ageof 9.9 (0.7) gyr at 95% confidence. this is about 2.0 gyr younger than inferredfor the metal-poor cluster ngc 6397 from the same models, and providesquantitative evidence that metal-rich clusters like 47 tucanae formed laterthan the metal-poor halo clusters like ngc 6397.

1309.3053	the masses of local group dwarf spheroidal galaxies: the death of the  universal mass profile	we investigate the claim that all dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dsphs) residewithin halos that share a common, universal mass profile as has been derivedfor dsphs of the galaxy. by folding in kinematic information for 25 andromedadsphs, more than doubling the previous sample size, we find that a singularmass profile can not be found to fit all the observations well. further, thebest-fit dark matter density profile measured for solely the milky way dsphs ismarginally discrepant (at just beyond the 1 sigma level) with that of theandromeda dsphs, where a profile with lower maximum circular velocity, andhence mass, is preferred. the agreement is significantly better when threeextreme andromeda outliers, and xix, xxi and xxv, all of which have largehalf-light radii (&gt;600pc) and low velocity dispersions (sigma_v &lt; 5km/s) areomitted from the sample. we argue that the unusual properties of these outliersare likely caused by tidal interactions with the host galaxy.

1403.4096	an empirical mass-loss law for population ii giants from the  spitzer-irac survey of galactic globular clusters	the main aim of the present work is to derive an empirical mass-loss (ml) lawfor population ii stars in first and second ascent red giant branches. we usedthe spitzer infrared array camera (irac) photometry obtained in the 3.6-8micron range of a carefully chosen sample of 15 galactic globular clustersspanning the entire metallicity range and sampling the vast zoology ofhorizontal branch (hb) morphologies. we complemented the irac photometry withnear-infrared data to build suitable color-magnitude and color-color diagramsand identify mass-losing giant stars. we find that while the majority of starsshow colors typical of cool giants, some stars show an excess of mid-infraredlight that is larger than expected from their photospheric emission and that isplausibly due to dust formation in mass flowing from them. for these stars, weestimate dust and total (gas + dust) ml rates and timescales. we finallycalibrate an empirical ml law for population ii red and asymptotic giant branchstars with varying metallicity. we find that at a given red giant branchluminosity only a fraction of the stars are losing mass. from this, we concludethat ml is episodic and is active only a fraction of the time, which we defineas the duty cycle. the fraction of mass-losing stars increases by increasingthe stellar luminosity and metallicity. the ml rate, as estimated fromreasonable assumptions for the gas-to-dust ratio and expansion velocity,depends on metallicity and slowly increases with decreasing metallicity. incontrast, the duty cycle increases with increasing metallicity, with the netresult that total ml increases moderately with increasing metallicity, about0.1 msun every dex in [fe/h]. for population ii asymptotic giant branch stars,we estimate a total ml of &lt;0.1 msun, nearly constant with varying metallicity.

1403.7203	the zcosmos redshift survey: evolution of the light in bulges and discs  since z~0.8	we studied the chronology of galactic bulge and disc formation by analysingthe relative contributions of these components to the b-band rest-frameluminosity density at different epochs. we present the first estimate of theevolution of the fraction of rest-frame b-band light in galactic bulges anddiscs since redshift z~0.8. we performed a bulge-to-disc decomposition ofhst/acs images of 3266 galaxies in the zcosmos-bright survey with spectroscopicredshifts in the range 0.7 &lt; z &lt; 0.9. we find that the fraction of b-band lightin bulges and discs is $(26 \pm 4)%$ and $(74 \pm 4)%$, respectively. whencompared with rest-frame b-band measurements of galaxies in the local universein the same mass range ($10^{9} m_{\odot}\lessapprox m \lessapprox 10^{11.5}m_{\odot}$), we find that the b-band light in discs decreases by ~30% fromz~0.7-0.9 to z~0, while the light from the bulge increases by ~30% over thesame period of time. we interpret this evolution as the consequence of starformation and mass assembly processes, as well as morphological transformation,which gradually shift stars formed at half the age of the universe fromstar-forming late-type/irregular galaxies toearlier types and ultimately intospheroids.

1407.0047	chemical and kinematical properties of galactic bulge stars surrounding  the stellar system terzan 5	as part of a study aimed at determining the kinematical and chemicalproperties of terzan 5, we present the first characterization of the bulgestars surrounding this puzzling stellar system. we observed 615 targets locatedwell beyond the tidal radius of terzan 5 and we found that their radialvelocity distribution is well described by a gaussian function peaked at&lt;v_rad&gt;=+21.0\pm4.6 km/s and with dispersion sigma_v=113.0\pm2.7 km/s. this isthe one of the few high-precision spectroscopic survey of radial velocities fora large sample of bulge stars in such a low and positive latitude environment(b=+1.7{\deg}). we found no evidence for the peak at &lt;v_rad&gt;\sim+200 km/s foundin nidever et al. 2012. the strong contamination of many observed spectra bytio bands prevented us from deriving the iron abundance for the entirespectroscopic sample, introducing a selection bias. the metallicitydistribution was finally derived for a sub-sample of 112 stars in a magnituderange where the effect of the selection bias is negligible. the distribution isquite broad and roughly peaked at solar metallicity ([fe/h]\simeq+0.05 dex)with a similar number of stars in the super-solar and in the sub-solar ranges.the population number ratios in different metallicity ranges agree well withthose observed in other low-latitude bulge fields suggesting (i) the possiblepresence of a plateau for |b|&lt;4{\deg} for the ratio between stars in thesuper-solar (0&lt;[fe/h]&lt;0.5 dex) and sub-solar (-0.5&lt;[fe/h]&lt;0 dex) metallicityranges; (ii) a severe drop of the metal-poor component ([fe/h]&lt;-0.5) as afunction of galactic latitude.

1408.5754	on the hi-hole and agb stellar population of the sagittarius dwarf  irregular galaxy	using two hst/acs data-sets that are separated by ~2 years has allowed us toderive the relative proper-motion for the sagittarius dwarf irregular (sagdig)and reduce the heavy foreground galactic contamination. the proper-motiondecontaminated sagdig catalog provides a much clearer view of the youngred-supergiant and intermediate-age asymptotic giant branch populations. wereport the identification of 3 milky way carbon-rich dwarf stars, probablybelonging to the thin disk, and pointing to the high incidence of this class atlow galactic latitudes. a sub-group of 4 oxygen-rich candidate stars depicts afaint, red extension of the well-defined sagdig carbon-rich sequence. theorigin of these oxygen-rich candidate stars remains unclear, reflecting theuncertainty in the ratio of carbon/oxygen rich stars. sagdig is also a gas-richgalaxy characterized by a single large cavity in the gas disk (hi-hole), whichis offset by ~360 pc from the optical centre of the galaxy. we nonethelessinvestigate the stellar feedback hypothesis by comparing the proper-motioncleaned stellar populations within the hi-hole with appropriately selectedcomparison regions, having higher hi densities external to the hole. thecomparison shows no significant differences. in particular, the centre of thehi-hole (and the comparison regions) lack stellar populations younger than ~400myr, which are otherwise abundant in the inner body of the galaxy. we concludethat there is no convincing evidence that the sagdig hi-hole is the result ofstellar feedback, and that gravitational and thermal instabilities in the gasare the most likely mechanism for its formation.

1409.1682	ceci n'est pas a globular cluster: the metallicity distribution of the  stellar system terzan 5	we present new determinations of the iron abundance for 220 stars belongingto the stellar system terzan 5 in the galactic bulge. the spectra have beenacquired with flames at the very large telescope of the european southernobservatory and deimos at the keck ii telescope. this is by far the largestspectroscopic sample of stars ever observed in this stellar system. from thisdataset, a subsample of targets with spectra unaffected by tio bands wasextracted and statistically decontaminated from field stars. once combined with34 additional stars previously published by our group, a total sample of 135member stars covering the entire radial extent of the system has been used todetermine the metallicity distribution function of terzan 5. the irondistribution clearly shows three peaks: a super-solar component at[fe/h]$\simeq0.25$ dex, accounting for 29% of the sample, a dominant sub-solarpopulation at [fe/h]$\simeq-0.30$ dex, corresponding to 62% of the total, and aminor (6%) metal-poor component at [fe/h]$\simeq-0.8$ dex. such a broad,multi-modal metallicity distribution demonstrates that terzan 5 is not agenuine globular cluster but the remnant of a much more complex stellar system.

1504.03252	multiple stellar populations in magellanic cloud clusters. iii. the  first evidence of an extended main sequence turn-off in a young cluster:  ngc1856	recent studies have shown that the extended main-sequence turn off (emsto) isa common feature of intermediate-age star clusters in the magellanic clouds(mcs). the most simple explanation is that these stellar systems harbormultiple generations of stars with an age difference of a few hundred myrs.  however, while an emsto has been detected in a large number of clusters withages between ~1-2 gyrs, several studies of young clusters in both mcs and innearby galaxies do not find any evidence for a prolonged star-formationhistory, i.e. for multiple stellar generations. these results have suggestedalternative interpretation of the emstos observed in intermediate-age starclusters. the emsto could be due to stellar rotation mimicking an age spread orto interacting binaries. in these scenarios, intermediate-age mc clusters wouldbe simple stellar populations, in close analogy with younger clusters.  here we provide the first evidence for an emsto in a young stellar cluster.we exploit multi-band hubble space telescope photometry to study the ~300-myrold star cluster ngc1856 in the large magellanic cloud and detected a broadenedmsto that is consistent with a prolonged star-formation which had a duration ofabout 150 myrs. below the turn-off, the ms of ngc1856 is split into a red andblue component, hosting 33+/-5% and 67+/-5% of the total number of ms stars,respectively. we discuss these findings in the context ofmultiple-stellar-generation, stellar-rotation, and interacting-binaryhypotheses.

1506.01400	deep near-ir observations of the globular cluster m4: hunting for brown  dwarfs	we present an analysis of deep hst/wfc3 near-ir (nir) imaging data of theglobular cluster m4. the best-photometry nir colour-magnitude diagram (cmd)clearly shows the main sequence extending towards the expected end of thehydrogen-burning limit and going beyond this point towards fainter sources. thewhite dwarf sequence can be identified. as such, this is the deepest nir cmd ofa globular cluster to date. archival hst optical data were used forproper-motion cleaning of the cmd and for distinguishing the white dwarfs (wds)from brown dwarf (bd) candidates. detection limits in the nir are around f110wapprox 26.5 mag and f160w approx27 mag, and in the optical around f775w approx28 mag. comparing our observed cmds with theoretical models, we conclude thatwe have reached beyond the h-burning limit in our nir cmd and are probably justabove or around this limit in our optical-nir cmds. thus, any faint nir sourcesthat have no optical counterpart are potential bd candidates, since the opticaldata are not deep enough to detect them. we visually inspected the positions ofnir sources which are fainter than the h-burning limit in f110w and for whichthe optical photometry did not return a counterpart. we found in total fivesources for which we did not get an optical measurement. for four of these fivesources, a faint optical counterpart could be visually identified, and an upperoptical magnitude was estimated. based on these upper optical magnitude limits,we conclude that one source is likely a wd, one source could either be a wd orbd candidate, and the remaining two sources agree with being bd candidates. foronly one source no optical counterpart could be detected, which makes thissource a good bd candidate. we conclude that we found in total four good bdcandidates.

1510.02622	chemical evolution of the inner 2 degrees of the milky way bulge:  [alpha/fe] trends and metallicity gradients	the structure, formation, and evolution of the milky way bulge is a matter ofdebate. important diagnostics for discriminating between bulge models includealpha-abundance trends with metallicity, and spatial abundance and metallicitygradients. due to the severe optical extinction in the inner bulge region, onlya few detailed investigations have been performed of this region. here we aimat investigating the inner 2 degrees by observing the [alpha/fe] element trendsversus metallicity, and by trying to derive the metallicity gradient.[alpha/fe] and metallicities have been determined by spectral synthesis of 2micron spectra observed with vlt/crires of 28 m-giants, lying along thesouthern minor axis at (l,b)=(0,0), (0,-1), and (0,-2). vlt/isaac spectra areused to determine the effective temperature of the stars. we present the firstconnection between the galactic center and the bulge using similar stars, highspectral resolution, and analysis techniques. the [alpha/fe] trends in all our3 fields show a large similarity among each other and with trends further outin the bulge, with a lack of an [\alpha/fe] gradient all the way into thecentre. this suggests a homogeneous bulge when it comes to the enrichmentprocess and star-formation history. we find a large range of metallicities(-1.2&lt;[fe/h]&lt;+0.3), with a lower dispersion in the galactic center:-0.2&lt;[fe/h]&lt;+0.3. the derived metallicities get in the mean, progressivelyhigher the closer to the galactic plane they lie. we could interpret this as acontinuation of the metallicity gradient established further out in the bulge,but due to the low number of stars and possible selection effects, more data ofthe same sort as presented here is necessary to conclude on the innermetallicity gradient from our data alone. our results firmly argues for thecenter being in the context of the bulge rather than very distinct.

astro-ph;0003004	on the helium content of galactic globular clusters via the r parameter	we estimate the empirical r parameter in 26 galactic globular clusterscovering a wide metallicity range, imaged by wfpc2 on board the hst. theimproved spatial resolution permits a large fraction of the evolved stars to bemeasured and permits accurate assessment of radial populaton gradients andcompleteness corrections. in order to evaluate both the he abundance and the heto metal enrichment ratio, we construct a large set of evolutionary models byadopting similar metallicities and different he contents. we find an absolutehe abundance which is lower than that estimated from spectroscopic measurementsin hii regions and from primordial nucleosynthesis models. this discrepancycould be removed by adopting a c12o16 nuclear cross section about a factor oftwo smaller than the canonical value, although also different assumptions formixing processes can introduce systematical effects. the trend in the rparameter toward solar metallicity is consistent with an upper limit to the heto metal enrichment ratio of the order of 2.5.

(abridged version) mayall ii = g1 is one of the brightest globular clustersbelonging to m31, the andromeda galaxy. our observations with hst/wfpc2 providedata for the (i vs. v-i) and (v vs. v-i) color-magnitude diagrams. from modelfitting, we determine a rather high mean metallicity of [fe/h] = --0.95 +-0.09, somewhat similar to 47 tucanae. we find a larger spread in v-i than canbe explained by the measurement errors, and we attribute this to an intrinsicmetallicity dispersion amongst the stars of g1. so far, only omega centauri,the giant galactic globular cluster, has been known to exhibit such anintrinsic metallicity dispersion.  three estimates of the total mass of this globular cluster can be obtained:king mass = 15 x 10^6 with m/lv ~ 7.5, virial mass = 7.3 x 10^6 with m/lv ~3.6, and king-michie mass range from 14 to 17 x 10^6. although uncertain, allof these mass estimates make g1 more than twice as massive as omega centauri.  such large masses relate to the metallicity spread whose origin is stillunknown (either self-enrichment, an inhomogeneous proto-cluster cloud, orremaining core of a dwarf galaxy). when considering the positions of g1 in thedifferent diagrams defined by kormendy (1985), g1 always appears on thesequence defined by globular clusters, and definitely away from the othersequences defined by elliptical galaxies, bulges, and dwarf spheroidalgalaxies. the same is true for omega centauri and for the nucleus of the dwarfelliptical ngc 205. this does not prove that all (massive) globular clustersare the remnant cores of nucleated dwarf galaxies.

0808.2746	relation between stellar mass and star formation activity in galaxies	for a mass-selected sample of 66544 galaxies with photometric redshifts fromthe cosmic evolution survey (cosmos), we examine the evolution of starformation activity as a function of stellar mass in galaxies. we estimate thecosmic star formation rates (sfr) over the range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.2, using therest-frame 2800 a flux (corrected for extinction). we find the mean sfr to be astrong function of the galactic stellar mass at any given redshift, withmassive systems (log (m/m(sun)) &gt; 10.5) contributing less (by a factor of ~ 5)to the total star formation rate density (sfrd).  combining data from the cosmos and gemini deep deep survey (gdds), we extendthe sfrd-z relation as a function of stellar mass to z~2. for massive galaxies,we find a steep increase in the sfrd-z relation to z~2; for the less massivesystems, the sfrd which also increases from z=0 to 1, levels off at z~1. thisimplies that the massive systems have had their major star formation activityat earlier epochs (z &gt; 2) than the lower mass galaxies.  we study changes in the sfrds as a function of both redshift and stellar massfor galaxies of different spectral types. we find that the slope of the sfrd-zrelation for different spectral type of galaxies is a strong function of theirstellar mass. for low and intermediate mass systems, the main contribution tothe cosmic sfrd comes from the star-forming galaxies while, for more massivesystems, the evolved galaxies are the most dominant population.

astro-ph;0303254	v, j, h and k imaging of the metal rich globular cluster ngc 6528	new near-infrared observations of ngc6528 are presented. the jhk observationscomplement a previous hst/nicmos data set by ortolani et al. (2001), in thatthey sample a larger area, contain a more numerous sample of red giant stars,and include the k band. also, archival hst data sets (separated by 6.093 years)were used to proper-motion decontaminate the near-infrared sample and extract aclean vjhk catalogue. using the present wide colour baseline, we compared thecleaned colour-magnitude diagrams of ngc6528 with those of ngc 6553 and ngc104and derived new estimates of reddening and distance, e(b-v)=0.55 and(m-m)o=14.44 (7.7 kpc). moreover, the morphology and location of the cleanedred giant branch were used to derive a photometric estimate of the clustermetallicity. the average of 10 metallicity indicators yields a mean value of[m/h] ~ 0.0, and [fe/h] ~-0.20 and +0.08 on the zinn &amp; west (1984) and carretta&amp; gratton (1997) revised metallicity scale, respectively. the best isochronefit to the cleaned k,v-k diagram is obtained for a 12.6 gyr and z=0.02isochrone, i.e. the derived metallicity of ngc6528 turns out to be very closeto the mean of stars in the baade's window. five agb variable star candidates,whose membership has to be confirmed spectroscopically, are bolometrically asbright as the known long period variable stars in ngc6553. as discussed inguarnieri et al. (1997) for ngc6553, this may indicate that an `intermediateage' population is not needed to account for the brightest stars in externalgalaxies such as m32.

astro-ph;0311200	the stellar content of the southern tail of ngc 4038/9 and a revised  distance	we have used the hubble space telescope and wide field planetary camera 2 toimage the putative tidal dwarf galaxy located at the tip of the southern tidaltail of ngc 4038/9, the antennae. we resolve individual stars, and identify twostellar populations. hundreds of massive stars are present, concentrated intotight ob associations on scales of 200 pc, with ages ranging from 2-100 myr. anolder stellar population is distributed roughly following the outer contours ofthe neutral hydrogen in the tidal tail; we associate these stars with materialejected from the outer disks of the two spirals. the older stellar populationhas a red giant branch tip at i=26.5+/-0.2 from which we derive a distancemodulus (m-m)_0=30.7+/-0.25. the implied distance of 13.8+/-1.7 mpc issignificantly smaller than commonly quoted distances for ngc 4038/9. incontrast to the previously studied core of the merger, we find no super starclusters. one might conclude that sscs require the higher pressures found inthe central regions in order to form, while spontaneous star formation in thetail produces the kind of o-b star associations seen in dwarf irregulargalaxies. the youngest population in the putative tidal dwarf has a totalstellar mass of ~2x10^5 msun, while the old population has a stellar mass of\~7x10^7 msun. if our smaller distance modulus is correct, it has far-reachingconsequences for this proto-typical merger. specifically, the luminous todynamical mass limits for the tidal dwarf candidates are significantly lessthan 1, the central super star clusters have sizes typical of galactic globularclusters rather than being 1.5 times as large, and the unusually luminous x-raypopulation becomes both less luminous and less populous.

astro-ph;0401440	hst observations of the main sequence of m4	this paper presents new results from a photometric study of the main-sequencestars in m4, the closest globular cluster to the sun. multi-field, multi-epochobservations at approximately 1, 2, and 6 core-radii were obtained with thewfpc2 camera on the hst. the multi-epoch observations allowed us to clean thedata on the basis of proper motion. in all the fields the cluster main sequencecan be traced to at least v = 27.0 but there remains a trail of stars to thelimit of the data near v = 30 in the deepest outer field. there is no evidencethat we have reached the end of the hydrogen burning main sequence in any ofour fields, however, there is some indication that very few stars remain to bedetected in the deepest data.  the scatter about the cluster main sequence yields a surprisingly small andvariable binary fraction; f_b = 2% in the inner parts of the cluster falling tothe 1% range outside. for the currently visible main sequence stars, thecluster mass function is very flat (alpha =0.1) in the outer field and flattensfurther in the inner fields suggesting well developed mass segregation. theobserved variation in the mass function is broadly consistent with isotropic,multi-mass michie-king models. because we have a large sample of white dwarfsin the outer field we are able to show that the cluster imf above 0.8msun wasconsiderably steeper than the present day mass function for low mass stars.  two appendicies are included in this contribution; a detailed discussion ofthe techniques used to reduce the data and a direct comparison between thecluster stars and those belonging to the inner spheroid of the galaxy yieldinga galactocentric distance of 7.5+/-0.6 kpc.

astro-ph;0401446	concerning the white dwarf cooling age of m4: a response to the paper by  de marchi et al. on "a different interpretation of recent hst observations"	we respond to the paper by de marchi, paresce, straniero and moroni (2003) onthe white dwarf cooling age of m4. the authors question the data analysis andinterpretation that led to the conclusions in hansen et al. (2002). in theirpaper, de marchi et al. are unable to obtain photometry as deep as ours fromthe same data set and therefore assert that only a lower limit to the whitedwarf cooling age for this cluster of approximately 9 gyr can be obtained.  in this short contribution we show that shortcomings in the data analysis andreduction techniques of de marchi et al. are responsible for their inability toreach the photometry limits that our study reports. in a forthcoming paper inwhich the complete techniques for age determination with white dwarfs are laidout, we demonstrate that their method of fitting the luminosity function givesa spuriously low white dwarf cooling age.

astro-ph;0402592	relative frequencies of blue stragglers in galactic globular clusters:  constraints for the formation mechanisms	we discuss the main properties of the galactic globular cluster (gc) bluestraggler stars (bss), as inferred from our new catalog containing nearly 3000bss. the catalog has been extracted from the photometrically homogeneous v vs.(b-v) color-magnitude diagrams (cmd) of 56 gcs, based on wfpc2 images of theircentral cores. in our analysis we used consistent relative distances based onthe same photometry and calibration. the number of bss has been normalized toobtain relative frequencies (f_{bss}) and specific densities (n_s) usingdifferent stellar populations extracted from the cmd. the cluster f_{bss} issignificantly smaller than the relative frequency of field bss. we find asignificant anti-correlation between the bss relative frequency in a clusterand its total absolute luminosity (mass). there is no statistically significanttrend between the bss frequency and the expected collision rate. f_{bss} doesnot depend on other cluster parameters, apart from a mild dependence on thecentral density. pcc clusters act like normal clusters as far as the bssfrequency is concerned. we also show that the bss luminosity function for themost luminous clusters is significantly different, with a brighter peak andextending to brighter luminosities than in the less luminous clusters. theseresults imply that the efficiency of bss production mechanisms and theirrelative importance vary with the cluster mass.

astro-ph;0411309	galex observations of the ultraviolet halos of ngc 253 and m82	we present galaxy evolution explorer (galex) images of the prototypicaledge-on starburst galaxies m82 and ngc253. our initial analysis is restrictedto the complex of ultraviolet (uv) filaments in the starburst-driven outflowsin the galaxy halos. the uv luminosities in the halo are too high to beprovided by shock-heated or photoionized gas except perhaps in the brightestfilaments in m82, suggesting that most of the uv light is the stellar continuumof the starburst scattered into our line of sight by dust in the outflow. thisinterpretation agrees with previous results from optical imaging polarimetry inm82. the morphology of the uv filaments in both galaxies shows a high degree ofspatial correlation with h-alpha and x-ray emission. this indicates that theseoutflows contain cold gas and dust, some of which may be vented into theintergalactic medium (igm). uv light is seen in the ``h-alpha cap'' 11 kpcnorth of m82. if this cap is a result of the wind fluid running into apre-existing gas cloud, the gas cloud contains dust and is not primordial innature but was probably stripped from m82 or m81. if starburst windsefficiently expel dust into the igm, this could have significant consequencesfor the observation of cosmologically distant objects.

astro-ph;0411318	the look-back time evolution of far-uv flux from elliptical galaxies:  the fornax cluster and abell 2670	in order to investigate the origin of the far-uv (fuv) flux from theearly-type galaxies, galaxy evolution explorer (galex) is collecting the uvdata for the elliptical-rich clusters at moderate redshifts (z &lt; 0.2) where thedominant fuv source is predicted to be hot horizontal-branch (hb) stars andtheir post-hb progeny. here we present our first result for the early-typegalaxies in abell 2670 at z = 0.076. compared to ngc 1399, a nearby giantelliptical galaxy in the fornax cluster, it appears that the rest-frame fuv - vcolor of the giant ellipticals gets redder by ~ 0.7 mag at the distance ofabell 2670 (z = 0.076; look-back time ~ 1.0 gyr). although a detailedcomparison with the models is postponed until more cluster data areaccumulated, it is interesting to note that this value is consistent with thevariation predicted by the population synthesis models where the meantemperature of hb stars declines rapidly with increasing look-back time.

astro-ph;0411336	a comparative study of the spatial distribution of ultraviolet and  far-infrared fluxes from m 101	the total ultraviolet (uv) flux (from 1412 to 2718 aa) of m 101 is comparedon a pixel-to-pixel basis with the total far-infrared (fir) flux (from 60 to170 micron), using the maps of the galaxy taken by galex in the near-uv andfar-uv and by isophot at 60, 100 and 170 micron. the main result of thisinvestigation is the discovery of a tight dependence of the fir/uv ratio onradius, with values monotonically decreasing from around 4 in the nuclearregion to nearly zero towards the edge of the optical disk.  although the tightness of this dependence is in part attributable toresolution effects, the result is consistent with the presence of a large-scaledistribution of diffuse dust having a face-on optical depth which decreaseswith radius and which dominates over the more localized variations in opacitybetween the arm and interarm regions. we also find a trend for the fir/uv ratioto take on higher values in the regions of diffuse interarm emission than inthe spiral-arm regions, at a given radius. this is interpreted quantitativelyin terms of the escape probability of uv photons from spiral arms and theirsubsequent scattering in the interarm regions, and in terms of the largerrelative contribution of optical photons to the heating of the dust in theinterarm regions.

astro-ph;0411372	uv emission from stellar populations within tidal tails: catching the  youngest galaxies in formation?	new galex observations have detected significant fuv (1530 angstroms) and nuv(2310 angstroms) emission from stellar substructures within the tidal tails offour ongoing galaxy mergers. the uv-bright regions are optically faint and arecoincident with hi density enhancements. fuv emission is detected at anylocation where the hi surface density exceeds ~2 m_sun pc^{-2}, and is oftendetected in the absence of visible wavelength emission. uv luminosities of thebrighter regions of the tidal tails imply masses of 10^6 m_sun to ~10^9 m_sunin young stars in the tails, and hi luminosities imply similar hi masses.uv-optical colors of the tidal tails indicate stellar populations as young as afew myr, and in all cases ages &lt; 400myr. most of the young stars in the tailsformed in single bursts rather than resulting from continuous star formation,and they formed *in situ* as the tails evolved. star formation appears to beolder near the parent galaxies and younger at increasing distances from theparent galaxy. this could be because the star formation occurs progressivelyalong the tails, or because the star formation has been inhibited near thegalaxy/tail interface. the youngest stellar concentrations, usually near theends of long tidal tails, have masses comparable to confirmed tidal dwarfgalaxies and may be newly forming galaxies undergoing their first burst of starformation.

astro-ph;0509561	local group dwarf elliptical galaxies: i. mapping the dynamics of ngc  205 beyond the tidal radius	ngc 205 is the nearest example of a dwarf elliptical (de) galaxy and theprototype of this enigmatic galaxy class. photometric evidence suggests thatngc 205, a close satellite of the m31 galaxy, is tidally interacting with itsparent galaxy. we present stellar radial velocity measurements out to aprojected radius of 20' (5 kpc) in ngc 205 based on keck/deimos multislitspectroscopic observations of 725 individual red giant branch stars. ourkinematic measurements extend from the center out to six times the effectiveradius of ngc 205, well past the expected tidal radius. the contamination inour kinematic sample from m31 field stars is estimated to be a few percentbased on maximum likelihood fits. we measure a maximum major-axis rotationspeed for the body of ngc 205 of 11+/- 5 kms; this is the first de galaxy inwhich the maximum rotation velocity has been measured. combined with thevelocity dispersion, we conclude that ngc 205 is supported by a combination ofrotation and random motions. at a major-axis distance of 4.5' (1 kpc), thevelocity profile of ngc 205 turns over; stars beyond this radius are movingcounter to the rotation of the inner part of the galaxy. the turnover radius iscoincident with the onset of isophotal twisting and the estimated tidal radius,suggesting that the outer kinematics of ngc 205 are dominated by gravitationalinteractions with the nearby m31 galaxy. the motion of stars beyond a radius of4.5' implies that ngc 205 is in a prograde encounter with its parent galaxym31.

astro-ph;0510254	halos of spiral galaxies. ii. halo metallicity-luminosity relation	using the hubble space telescope, we have resolved individual red-giantbranch stars in the halos of eight nearby spiral galaxies. the fields lie atprojected distances between 2 and 13 kpc along the galaxies' minor axes. thedata set allows a first look at the systematic trends in halo stellarpopulations. we have found that bright galaxies tend to have broad red-giantbranch star color distributions with redder mean colors, suggesting that theheavy element abundance spread increases with the parent galaxy luminosity. themean metallicity of the stellar halo, estimated using the mean colors ofred-giant branch stars, correlates with the parent galaxy luminosity. themetallicity of the milky way halo falls nearly 1 dex below thisluminosity-metallicity relation, suggesting that the halo of the galaxy is morethe exception than the rule for spiral galaxies; i.e., massive spirals withmetal-poor halos are unusual. the luminosity-halo stellar abundance relation isconsistent with the scaling relation expected for stellar systems embedded indominant halos, suggesting that the bulk of the halo stellar population mayhave formed in situ.

astro-ph;0510255	halos of spiral galaxies. iii. metallicity distributions	(abriged) we report results of a campaign to image the stellar populations inthe halos of highly inclined spiral galaxies, with the fields roughly 10 kpc(projected) from the nuclei. we use the f814w (i) and f606w (v) filters in thewide field planetary camera 2, on board the hubble space telescope. extendedhalo populations are detected in all galaxies. the color-magnitude diagramsappear to be completely dominated by giant-branch stars, with no evidence forthe presence of young stellar populations in any of the fields. we find thatthe metallicity distribution functions are dominated by metal-rich populations,with a tail extending toward the metal poor end. to first order, the overallshapes of the metallicity distribution functions are similar to what ispredicted by simple, single-component model of chemical evolution with theeffective yields increasing with galaxy luminosity. however, metallicitydistributions significantly narrower than the simple model are observed for afew of the most luminous galaxies in the sample. it appears clear that moreluminous spiral galaxies also have more metal-rich stellar halos. theincreasingly significant departures from the closed-box model for the moreluminous galaxies indicate that a parameter in addition to a single yield isrequired to describe chemical evolution. this parameter, which could be relatedto gas infall or outflow either in situ or in progenitor dwarf galaxies thatlater merge to form the stellar halo, tends to act to make the metallicitydistributions narrower at high metallicity.

astro-ph;0512161	kinematics and metallicity of m31 red giants: the giant southern stream  and discovery of a second cold component at r = 20 kpc	we present spectroscopic observations of red giant branch (rgb) stars in theandromeda spiral galaxy (m31), acquired with the deimos instrument on the keckii 10-m telescope. the three fields targeted in this study are in the m31spheroid, outer disk, and giant southern stream. in this paper, we focus on thekinematics and chemical composition of rgb stars in the stream field located ata projected distance of r = 20 kpc from m31's center. a mix of stellarpopulations is found in this field. m31 rgb stars are isolated from milky waydwarf star contaminants using a variety of spectral and photometricdiagnostics. the radial velocity distribution of rgb stars displays a clearbimodality -- a primary peak centered at v = -513 km/s and a secondary one at v= -417 km/s -- along with an underlying broad component that is presumablyrepresentative of the smooth spheroid of m31. both peaks are found to bedynamically cold with intrinsic velocity dispersions of sigma(v) = 16 km/s. themean metallicity and metallicity dispersion of stars in the two peaks is alsofound to be similar: [fe/h] = -0.45 and sigma([fe/h]) = 0.2. the observedvelocity of the primary peak is consistent with that predicted by dynamicalmodels for the stream, but there is no obvious explanation for the secondarypeak. the nature of the secondary cold population is unclear: it may represent:(1) tidal debris from a satellite merger event that is superimposed on, butunrelated to, the giant southern stream; (2) a wrapped around component of thegiant southern stream; (3) a warp or overdensity in m31's disk at r &gt; 50 kpc(this component is well above the outward extrapolation of the smoothexponential disk brightness profile).

astro-ph;0601029	uv-optical colours as probes of early-type galaxy evolution	we have studied ~2100 early-type galaxies in the sdss dr3 which have beendetected by the galex medium imaging survey (mis), in the redshift range 0 &lt; z&lt; 0.11. combining galex uv photometry with corollary optical data from thesdss, we find that, at a 95 percent confidence level, at least ~30 percent ofgalaxies in this sample have uv to optical colours consistent with some recentstar formation within the last gyr. in particular, galaxies with a nuv - rcolour less than 5.5 are very likely to have experienced such recent starformation, taking into account the possibility of a contribution to nuv fluxfrom the uv upturn phenomenon. we find quantitative agreement between theobservations and the predictions of a semi-analytical lcdm hierarchical mergermodel and deduce that early-type galaxies in the redshift range 0 &lt; z &lt; 0.11have ~1 to 3 percent of their stellar mass in stars less than 1 gyr old. theaverage age of this recently formed population is ~300 to 500 myrs. we alsofind that monolithically evolving galaxies, where recent star formation can bedriven solely by recycled gas from stellar mass loss, cannot exhibit the bluecolours (nuv - r &lt; 5.5) seen in a significant fraction (~30 percent) of ourobserved sample.

astro-ph;0601036	the effect of environment on the uv colour-magnitude relation of  early-type galaxies	we use \textit{galex} (galaxy evolution explorer) near-uv (nuv) photometry ofa sample of early-type galaxies selected in \textit{sdss} (sloan digital skysurvey) to study the uv color-magnitude relation (cmr). $nuv-r$ color is anexcellent tracer of even small amounts ($\sim 1$% mass fraction) of recent($\la 1$ gyr) star formation and so the $nuv-r$ cmr allows us to study theeffect of environment on the recent star formation history. we analyze avolume-limited sample of 839 visually-inspected early-type galaxies in theredshift range $0.05 &lt; z &lt; 0.10$ brighter than $m_{r}$ of -21.5 with anypossible emission-line or radio-selected agn removed to avoid contamination. wefind that contamination by agn candidates and late-type interlopers highly biasany study of recent star formation in early-type galaxies and that, afterremoving those, our lower limit to the fraction of massive early-type galaxiesshowing signs of recent star formation is roughly $30 \pm 3%$ this suggeststhat residual star formation is common even amongst the present day early-typegalaxy population.  we find that the fraction of uv-bright early-type galaxies is 25% higher inlow-density environments. however, the density effect is clear only in thelowest density bin. the blue galaxy fraction for the subsample of the brightestearly-type galaxies however shows a very strong density dependence, in thesense that the blue galaxy fraction is lower in a higher density region.

astro-ph;0601235	star formation in the nearby universe: the ultraviolet and infrared  points of view	this work presents the main ultraviolet (uv) and far-infrared (fir)properties of two samples of nearby galaxies selected from the galex ($\lambda= 2315$\aa, hereafter nuv) and iras ($\lambda = 60\mu$m) surveys respectively.they are built in order to get detection at both wavelengths for most of thegalaxies. star formation rate (sfr) estimators based on the uv and firemissions are compared. systematic differences are found between the sfrestimators for individual galaxies based on the nuv fluxes corrected for dustattenuation and on the total ir luminosity. a combined estimator based on nuvand ir luminosities seems to be the best proxy over the whole range of valuesof sfr. although both samples present similar average values of the birthrateparameter b, their star-formation-related properties are substantiallydifferent: nuv-selected galaxies tend to show larger values of $b$ for lowermasses, sfrs and dust attenuations, supporting previous scenarios for the starformation history (sfh). conversely, about 20% of the fir-selected galaxiesshow high values of $b$, sfr and nuv attenuation. these galaxies, most of thembeing lirgs and ulirgs, break down the downsizing picture for the sfh, howevertheir relative contribution per unit volume is small in the local universe.finally, the cosmic sfr density of the local universe is estimated in aconsistent way from the nuv and ir luminosities.

(...) this data set has been complemented with archival optical,near-infrared, and far-infrared fluxes and colors. we find that the integrated(fuv-k) color provides robust discrimination between elliptical andspiral/irregular galaxies and also among spiral galaxies of differentsub-types. elliptical galaxies with brighter k-band luminosities (i.e. moremassive) are redder in (nuv-k) color but bluer in (fuv-nuv) than less massiveellipticals. in the case of the spiral/irregular galaxies our analysis showsthe presence of a relatively tight correlation between the (fuv-nuv) color andthe total infrared-to-uv ratio. the correlation found between (fuv-nuv) colorand k-band luminosity (with lower luminosity objects being bluer than moreluminous ones) can be explained as due to an increase in the dust content withgalaxy luminosity.  the images in this atlas along with the profiles and integrated propertiesare publicly available through a dedicated web page athttp://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/galex_atlas/

astro-ph;0701924	star formation in aegis field galaxies since z=1.1 : the dominance of  gradually declining star formation, and the main sequence of star-forming  galaxies	we analyze star formation (sf) as a function of stellar mass (m*) andredshift z in the all wavelength extended groth strip international survey(aegis). for 2905 field galaxies, complete to 10^10(10^10.8) msun at z&lt;0.7(1),with keck spectroscopic redshifts out to z=1.1, we compile sf rates (sfr) fromemission lines, galex, and spitzer mips 24 micron photometry, optical-nir m*measurements, and hst morphologies. galaxies with reliable signs of sf form adistinct "main sequence (ms)", with a limited range of sfr at a given m* and z(1 sigma &lt; +-0.3 dex), and log(sfr) approximately proportional to log(m*). therange of log(sfr) remains constant to z&gt;1, while the ms as a whole moves tohigher sfr as z increases. the range of sfr along the ms constrains theamplitude of episodic variations of sf, and the effect of mergers on sfr.typical galaxies spend ~67(95)% of their lifetime since z=1 within a factor of&lt;~ 2(4) of their average sfr at a given m* and z. the dominant mode of theevolution of sf since z~1 is apparently a gradual decline of the average sfr inmost individual galaxies, not a decreasing frequency of starburst episodes, ora decreasing factor by which sfr are enhanced in starbursts. lirgs at z~1 seemto mostly reflect the high sfr typical for massive galaxies at that epoch. thesmooth ms may reflect that the same set of few physical processes governs starformation prior to additional quenching processes. a gradual process like gasexhaustion may play a dominant role.

(1993). the bulge imf is also quite similar to the mass functionsderived for those globular clusters which are believed to have experiencedlittle or no dynamical evolution. finally, we derive the $m/l_j$ ratio of thebulge to be $\sim 0.9\pm0.1$ $m_\odot/l_\odot$, and briefly discuss theimplications of this bulge imf for the interpretation of the microlensingevents observed in the direction of the galactic bulge.

0810.2794	the correlation of star formation quenching with internal galaxy  properties and environment	we investigate the correlation of star formation quenching with internalgalaxy properties and large scale environment (halo mass) in empirical data andtheoretical models. we make use of the halo-based group catalog of yang andcollaborators, which is based on the sloan digital sky survey. data from thegalaxy evolution explorer (galex) are also used to extract the recent starformation rate. in order to investigate the environmental effects, we examinethe properties of "central" and "satellite" galaxies separately. for centralgalaxies, we are unable to conclude whether star formation quenching isprimarily connected with halo mass or stellar mass, because these twoquantities are themselves strongly correlated. for satellite galaxies, a nearlyequally strong dependence on halo mass and stellar mass is seen. we make thesame comparison for five different semi-analytic models based on threeindependently developed codes. we find that the models with agn feedbackreproduce reasonably well the dependence of the fraction of central red andpassive galaxies on halo mass and stellar mass. however, for satellitegalaxies, the same models badly overproduce the fraction of red/passivegalaxies and do not reproduce the empirical trends with stellar mass or halomass. this {\em satellite overquenching problem} is caused by the too-rapidstripping of the satellites' hot gas halos, which leads to rapid strangulationof star formation.

0811.1205	a golden standard type ia supernova sn 2005cf: observations from the  ultraviolet to the near-infrared wavebands	we present extensive photometry at ultraviolet (uv), optical, andnear-infrared (nir) wavelengths, as well as dense sampling of optical spectra,for the normal type ia supernova (sn ia) 2005cf. from the well-sampled lightcurves, we find that sn 2005cf reached a b-band maximum at 13.63+/-0.02 mag,with an observed luminosity decline rate dm_15(b) = 1.05+/-0.03 mag. thecorrelations between the decline rate and various color indexes, recalibratedon the basis of an expanded sn ia sample, yielded e(b-v)_host=0.09+/-0.03 magfor sn2005cf. the uv photometry was obtained with the hst and the swiftultraviolet/optical telescope, and the results match each other to within0.1-0.2 mag. the uv light curves show similar evolution to the broadband u,with an exception in the 2000-2500 angstrom spectral range (corresponding tothe f220w/uvm2 filters), where the light curve appears broader and much fainterthan that on either side (likely owing to the intrinsic spectral evolution).combining the uv data with the ground-based optical and nir data, we establishthe generic uv-optical-nir bolometric light curve for sn 2005cf and derive thebolometric corrections in the absence of uv and/or nir data. the overallspectral evolution of sn 2005cf is similar to that of a normal sn ia, but withvariety in the strength and profile of the main feature lines. the spectra atearly times displayed strong, detached high-velocity (hv) features in the ca iih&amp;k doublet and nir triplet. similar hv features may exist in the siii 6355absorption line which evolved rapidly from a flat-bottomed feature in theearliest phase to a triangular shape one week before maximum, and may be commonin other normal sne ia. the possible origin of the hv absorption features isbriefly discussed (abridged).
