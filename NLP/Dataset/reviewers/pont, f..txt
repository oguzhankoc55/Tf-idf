0902.4457	photometric and spectroscopic detection of the primary transit of the  111-day-period planet hd 80606 b	we report the detection of the primary transit of the extra-solar planet hd80606 b, thanks to photometric and spectroscopic observations performed atobservatoire de haute-provence, simultaneously with the ccd camera at the120-cm telescope and the sophie spectrograph at the 193-cm telescope. weobserved the whole egress of the transit and partially its central part, inboth data sets with the same timings. the ingress occurred before sunset andwas not observed. the full duration of the transit was between 9.5 and 17.2hours. the data allows the planetary radius to be measured (rp = 0.9 +- 0.1rjup) and other parameters of the system to be refined. radial velocitymeasurements show the detection of a prograde rossiter-mclaughlin effect, andprovide a hint for a spin-orbit misalignment. if confirmed, this misalignmentwould corroborate the hypothesis that hd 80606 b owes its unusual orbitalconfiguration to kozai migration. hd 80606 b is by far the transiting planet onthe longest period detected today. its unusually small radius reinforces theobserved relationship between the planet radius and the incident flux receivedfrom the star and opens new questions for theory. orbiting a quite bright star(v=9), it opens opportunities to numerous follow-up studies.

0903.1829	noise properties of the corot data: a planet-finding perspective	in this short paper, we study the photometric precision of stellar lightcurves obtained by the corot satellite in its planet finding channel, with aparticular emphasis on the timescales characteristic of planetary transits.together with other articles in the same issue of this journal, it forms anattempt to provide the building blocks for a statistical interpretation of thecorot planet and eclipsing binary catch to date.  after pre-processing the light curves so as to minimise long-term variationsand outliers, we measure the scatter of the light curves in the first threecorot runs lasting more than 1 month, using an iterative non-linear filter toisolate signal on the timescales of interest. the bevhaiour of the noise on 2htimescales is well-described a power-law with index 0.25 in r-magnitude,ranging from 0.1mmag at r=11.5 to 1mmag at r=16, which is close to thepre-launch specification, though still a factor 2-3 above the photon noise dueto residual jitter noise and hot pixel events. there is evidence for a slightdegradation of the performance over time. we find clear evidence for enhancedvariability on hours timescales (at the level of 0.5 mmag) in stars identifiedas likely giants from their r-magnitude and b-v colour, which representapproximately 60 and 20% of the observed population in the direction of aquilaand monoceros respectively. on the other hand, median correlated noise levelsover 2h for dwarf stars are extremely low, reaching 0.05mmag at the bright end.

0904.2979	bulk composition of the transiting hot neptune around gj 436	the hot neptune orbiting around gj 436 is a unique example of an intermediatemass planet. its close-in orbit suggests that the planet has undergonemigration and its study is fundamental to understanding planet formation andevolution. as it transits its parent star, it is the only neptune-massextrasolar planet of known mass and radius, being slightly larger and moremassive than neptune (m=22.6 m_earth, r=4.19r_earth). in this regime, severalbulk compositions are possible: from an earth-like core with a thick hydrogenenvelope to a water-rich planet with a thin hydrogen envelope comprising aneptune-like structure. we combine planet-structure modeling with an advancedplanet-formation model to assess the likelihood of the different possible bulkcompositions of gj 436 b. we find that both an envelope-free water planet("ocean planet") as well as a diminute version of a gaseous giant planet areexcluded. consisting of a rocky core with a thick hydrogen/helium envelope, a"dry" composition produces not only too small a radius but is also a veryunlikely outcome of planet formation around such a low-mass star. we concludethat gj 436 b is probably of much higher rock content than neptune (more than45% in mass), with a small h-he envelope (10 - 20% in mass). this is theexpected outcome of the gathering of materials during the migration process inthe inner disk, creating a population of which the hot neptune isrepresentative.

0906.5605	spin-orbit misalignment in the hd80606 planetary system	we recently reported the photometric and spectroscopic detection of theprimary transit of the 111-day-period, eccentric extra-solar planet hd80606 b,at observatoire de haute-provence, france (moutou et al. 2009). the wholeegress of the primary transit and a section of its central part were observed,allowing the measurement of the planetary radius, and evidence for a spin-orbitmisalignment through the observation of the rossiter-mclaughlin anomaly. theingress having not been observed for this long-duration transit, uncertaintiesremained in the parameters of the system. we present here a refined, combinedanalysis of our photometric and spectroscopic data, together with furtherpublished radial velocities, ground-based photometry, and spitzer photometryaround the secondary eclipse, as well as new photometric measurements of hd80606 acquired at mount hopkins, arizona, just before the beginning of theprimary transit. although the transit is not detected in those new data, theyprovide an upper limit for the transit duration, which narrows down thepossible behaviour of the rossiter-mclaughlin anomaly in the unobserved part ofthe transit. we analyse the whole data with a bayesian approach using amarkov-chain monte carlo integration on all available information. we find r_p= 0.98 +- 0.03 r_jup for the planetary radius, and a total primary transitduration of 11.9 +- 1.3 hours from first to fourth contact. our analysisreinforces the hypothesis of spin-orbit misalignment in this system (alignmentexcluded at &gt;95 % level), with a positive projected angle between the planetaryorbital axis and the stellar rotation (median solution lambda ~ 50 degrees). ashd80606 is a component of a binary system, the peculiar orbit of its planetcould result from a kozai mechanism.

0707.0417	efficient identification of exoplanetary transit candidates from  superwasp light curves	transiting extrasolar planets constitute only a small fraction of the rangeof stellar systems found to display periodic, shallow dimmings in wide-fieldsurveys employing small-aperture camera arrays. here we present an efficientselection strategy for follow-up observations, derived from analysis of thelight curves of a sample of 67 superwasp targets that passed the selectiontests we used in earlier papers, but which have subsequently been identifiedeither as planet hosts or as astrophysical false positives. we determine thesystem parameters using markov-chain monte carlo analysis of the superwasplight curves. we use a constrained optimisation of chi-squared combined with abayesian prior based on the main-sequence mass and radius expected from the2mass j-h colour. the bayesian nature of the analysis allows us to quantifyboth the departure of the host star from the main-sequence mass-radius relationand the probability that the companion radius is less than 1.5 jupiter radii.when augmented by direct light curve analyses that detect binaries with unequalprimary and secondary eclipses, and objects with aperture blends that areresolved by superwasp, we find that only 13 of the original 67 stars, includingthe three known planets in the sample, would qualify for follow-up. thissuggests that planet discovery "hit rates" better than one-in-five should beachievable. in addition, the stellar binaries that qualify are likely to haveastrophysically interesting stellar or sub-stellar secondaries.

0908.4521	extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs around a-f type stars - vii. theta  cygni radial velocity variations: planets or stellar phenomenon?	(abridged) in the frame of the search for extrasolar planets and brown dwarfsaround early-type main-sequence stars, we present the results obtained on theearly f-type star theta cygni. elodie and sophie at ohp were used to obtain thespectra. our dedicated radial-velocity measurement method was used to monitorthe star's radial velocities over five years. we also use complementary, highangular resolution and high-contrast images taken with pueo at cfht. we showthat theta cygni radial velocities are quasi-periodically variable, with a~150-day period. these variations are not due to the ~0.35-msun stellarcompanion that we detected in imaging at more than 46 au from the star. theabsence of correlation between the bisector velocity span variations and theradial velocity variations for this 7 km/s vsini star, as well as othercriteria indicate that the observed radial velocity variations are not due tostellar spots. the observed amplitude of the bisector velocity span variationsalso seems to rule out stellar pulsations. however, we observe a peak in thebisector velocity span periodogram at the same period as the one found in theradial velocity periodogram, which indicates a probable link between theseradial velocity variations and the low amplitude lineshape variations which areof stellar origin. long-period variations are not expected from this type ofstar to our knowledge. if a stellar origin (hence of new type) was to beconfirmed for these long-period radial velocity variations, this would haveseveral consequences on the search for planets around main-sequence stars, bothin terms of observational strategy and data analysis. an alternativeexplanation for these variable radial velocities is the presence of at leastone planet of a few jupiter masses orbiting at less than 1 au.

1109.3251	a gaussian process framework for modelling instrumental systematics:  application to transmission spectroscopy	transmission spectroscopy, which consists of measuring thewavelength-dependent absorption of starlight by a planet's atmosphere during atransit, is a powerful probe of atmospheric composition. however, the expectedsignal is typically orders of magnitude smaller than instrumental systematics,and the results are crucially dependent on the treatment of the latter. in thispaper, we propose a new method to infer transit parameters in the presence ofsystematic noise using gaussian processes, a technique widely used in themachine learning community for bayesian regression and classification problems.our method makes use of auxiliary information about the state of theinstrument, but does so in a non-parametric manner, without imposing a specificdependence of the systematics on the instrumental parameters, and naturallyallows for the correlated nature of the noise. we give an example applicationof the method to archival nicmos transmission spectroscopy of the hot jupiterhd 189733, which goes some way towards reconciling the controversy surroundingthis dataset in the literature. finally, we provide an appendix giving ageneral introduction to gaussian processes for regression, in order toencourage their application to a wider range of problems.

1208.4982	gtc osiris transiting exoplanet atmospheric survey: detection of sodium  in xo-2b from differential long-slit spectroscopy	we present two transits of the hot-jupiter exoplanet xo-2b using the grantelescopio canarias (gtc). the time series observations were performed usinglong-slit spectroscopy of xo-2 and a nearby reference star with the osirisinstrument, enabling differential specrophotometric transit lightcurves capableof measuring the exoplanet's transmission spectrum. two optical low-resolutiongrisms were used to cover the optical wavelength range from 3800 to 9300{\aa}.we find that sub-mmag level slit losses between the target and reference starprevent full optical transmission spectra from being constructed, limiting ouranalysis to differential absorption depths over ~1000{\aa} regions. wider longslits or multi-object grism spectroscopy with wide masks will likely proveeffective in minimising the observed slit-loss trends. during both transits, wedetect significant absorption in the planetary atmosphere of xo-2b using a50{\aa} bandpass centred on the na i doublet, with absorption depths ofdelta(r_pl/r_star)^2=0.049+/-0.017 % using the r500r grism and 0.047+/-0.011 %using the r500b grism (combined 5.2-sigma significance from both transits). thesodium feature is unresolved in our low-resolution spectra, with detailedmodelling also likely ruling out significant line-wing absorption over an~800{\aa} region surrounding the doublet. combined with narrowband photometricmeasurements, xo-2b is the first hot jupiter with evidence for both sodium andpotassium present in the planet's atmosphere.

1210.4163	the prevalence of dust on the exoplanet hd 189733b from hubble and  spitzer observations	the hot jupiter hd189733b is the most extensively observed exoplanet. itsatmosphere has been detected and characterised in transmission and eclipsespectroscopy, and its phase curve measured at several wavelengths. this paperbrings together results of our campaign to obtain the complete transmissionspectrum of the atmosphere of this planet from uv to ir with hst, using stis,acs and wfc3. we provide a new tabulation of the transmission spectrum acrossthe entire visible and ir range. the radius ratio in each wavelength band wasrederived to ensure a consistent treatment of the bulk transit parameters andstellar limb-darkening. special care was taken to correct for, and deriverealistic estimates of the uncertainties due to, both occulted and unoccultedstar spots. the combined spectrum is very different from the predictions ofcloud-free models: it is dominated by rayleigh scattering over the wholevisible and near infrared range, the only detected features being narrow na andk lines. we interpret this as the signature of a haze of condensate grainsextending over at least 5 scale heights. we show that a dust-dominatedatmosphere could also explain several puzzling features of the emissionspectrum and phase curves, including the large amplitude of the phase curve at3.6um, the small hot-spot longitude shift and the hot mid-infrared emissionspectrum. we discuss possible compositions and derive some first-orderestimates for the properties of the putative condensate haze/clouds. we finishby speculating that the dichotomy between the two observationally definedclasses of hot jupiter atmospheres, of which hd189733b and hd209458b are theprototypes, might not be whether they possess a temperature inversion, butwhether they are clear or dusty. we also consider the possibility of acontinuum of cloud properties between hot jupiters, young jupiters and l-typebrown dwarfs.

0712.1374	detection of atmospheric haze on an extrasolar planet: the 0.55 - 1.05  micron transmission spectrum of hd189733b with the hubble space telescope	the nearby transiting planet hd 189733b was observed during three transitswith the acs camera of the hubble space telescope in spectroscopic mode. theresulting time series of 675 spectra covers the 550-1050 nm range, with aresolution element of ~8 nm, at extremely high accuracy (signal-to-noise ratioup to 10,000 in 50 nm intervals in each individual spectrum). using these data,we disentangle the effects of limb darkening, measurement systematics, andspots on the surface of the host star, to calculate the wavelength dependenceof the effective transit radius to an accuracy of ~50 km. this constitutes the``transmission spectrum'' of the planetary atmosphere. it indicates at eachwavelength at what height the planetary atmosphere becomes opaque to thegrazing stellar light during the transit. in this wavelength range, strongfeatures due to sodium, potassium and water are predicted by atmosphere modelsfor a planet like hd 189733b, but they can be hidden by broad absorption fromclouds or hazes higher up in the atmosphere.  we observed an almost featureless transmission spectrum between 550 and 1050nm, with no indication of the expected sodium or potassium atomic absorptionfeatures. comparison of our results with the transit radius observed in thenear and mid-infrared (2-8 microns), and the slope of the spectrum, suggest thepresence of a haze of sub-micron particles in the upper atmosphere of theplanet.

1309.5261	hst hot jupiter transmission spectral survey: evidence for aerosols and  lack of tio in the atmosphere of wasp-12b	we present hst optical transmission spectra of the transiting hot jupiterwasp-12b, taken with the stis instrument. from the transmission spectra, we areable to decisively rule out prominent absorption by tio in the exoplanet'satmosphere. strong pressure-broadened na and k absorption signatures are alsoexcluded, as are significant metal-hydride features. we compare our combinedbroadband spectrum to a wide variety of existing aerosol-free atmosphericmodels, though none are satisfactory fits. however, we do find that the fulltransmission spectrum can be described by models which include significantopacity from aerosols: including rayleigh scattering, mie scattering, tholinhaze, and settling dust profiles. the transmission spectrum follows aneffective extinction cross section with a power-law of index alpha, with theslope of the transmission spectrum constraining the quantity alphat =-3528+/-660 k, where t is the atmospheric temperature. rayleigh scattering(alpha=-4) is among the best fitting models, though requires low terminatortemperatures near 900 k. sub-micron size aerosol particles can provide equallygood fits to the entire transmission spectrum for a wide range of temperatures,and we explore corundum as a plausible dust aerosol. the presence ofatmospheric aerosols also helps to explain the modestly bright albedo impliedby spitzer observations, as well as the near black body nature of the emissionspectrum. ti-bearing condensates on the cooler night-side is the most naturalexplanation for the overall lack of tio signatures in wasp-12b, indicating theday/night cold-trap is an important effect for very hot jupiters. these findingindicate that aerosols can play a significant atmospheric role for the entirewide range of hot-jupiter atmospheres, potentially affecting their overallspectrum and energy balance.(abridged)

astro-ph;0202494	the araucaria project. discovery of cepheid variables in ngc 300 from a  wide-field imaging survey	based on observations of ngc 300, obtained with the wide-field camera at the2.2 m eso/mpi telescope during 29 nights spread over a 5.3 month interval, 117cepheids and 12 cepheid candidates were found which cover the period range from115 to 5.4 days. we present a catalog which provides equatorial coordinates,period, time of maximum brightness, and intensity mean b and v magnitudes foreach variable, and we show phased b and v light curves for all the cepheidsfound. we also present the individual b and v observations for each cepheid inour catalog. we find very good agreement between our photometry and thatobtained by freedman et al. from ground-based ccd data for common stars. thecepheids delineate the spiral arms of ngc 300, and a couple of them weredetected very close to the center of the galaxy. from the color-magnitudediagram of ngc 300 constructed from our data, we expect that our cepheiddetection is near-complete for variables with periods larger than about 10days. we present plots of the pl relations in the b and v bands obtained fromour data, which clearly demonstrate the presence of a malmquist bias forperiods below about 10 days. a thorough discussion of the distance to ngc 300will be presented in a forthcoming paper which will include the analysis ofphotometry in longer-wavelength bands.

astro-ph;0405198	the geneva-copenhagen survey of the solar neighbourhood: ages,  metallicities, and kinematic properties of 14,000 f and g dwarfs	we present and discuss new determinations of metallicity, rotation, age,kinematics, and galactic orbits for a complete, magnitude-limited, andkinematically unbiased sample of 16,682 nearby f and g dwarf stars. our 63,000new, accurate radial-velocity observations for nearly 13,500 stars allowidentification of most of the binary stars in the sample and, together withpublished data complete the kinematic information for 14,139 stars. a majoreffort has been devoted to the determination of new isochrone ages for allstars for which this is possible. particular attention has been given to arealistic treatment of statistical biases and error estimates, as standardtechniques tend to underestimate these effects and introduce spurious featuresin the age distributions. we demonstrate, however, how strong observational andtheoretical biases cause the distribution of the observed ages to be verydifferent from that of the true age distribution of the sample. our firstresults confirm the lack of metal-poor g dwarfs relative to closed-box modelpredictions (the ``g dwarf problem''), the existence of radial metallicitygradients in the disk, the small change in mean metallicity of the thin disksince its formation and the substantial scatter in metallicity at all ages, andthe continuing kinematic heating of the thin disk with an efficiency consistentwith that expected for a combination of spiral arms and giant molecular clouds.distinct features in the distribution of the v component of the space motionare extended in age and metallicity, corresponding to the effects of stochasticspiral waves rather than classical moving groups, and may complicate theidentification of thick-disk stars from kinematic criteria.

astro-ph;0409023	surface brightness and stellar populations at the outer edge of the  large magellanic cloud: no stellar halo yet	we present a high quality cmd for a 36'x 36' field located 8 degrees (7 kpc)from the lmc center, as well as a precise determination of the lmc surfacebrightness derived from the resolved stellar population out to this largegalactocentric radius. this deep cmd shows for the first time the detailed agedistribution at this position, where the surface brightness is v=26.5 mag/sq".at a radius r=474' the main sequence is well populated from the oldest turnoffat i=21.5 to the 2.5 gyr turnoff at i=19.5. beyond this radius, a relativelystrong gradient in the density of stars with ages in the 2.5-4 gyr range isapparent. there are some stars brighter and bluer than the main population,quite uniformly distributed over the whole area surveyed, which are wellmatched by a 1.5 gyr isochrone and may be indicative of a relatively recentstar formation, or merger, event. the surface brightness profile of the lmcremains exponential to this large galactocentric radius and shows no evidenceof disk truncation. combining the information on surface brightness and stellarpopulation we conclude that the lmc disk extends (and dominates over a possiblestellar halo) out to a distance of at least 7 kpc. these results confirm thatthe absence of blue stars in the relatively shallow off-center cmds of dirrgalaxies is not necessarily evidence for an exclusively old stellar populationresembling the halo of the milky way.

astro-ph;0501615	doppler follow-up of ogle planetary transit candidates in carina	we present the results of our high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up of 42planetary transit candidates in carina from the ogle survey. this follow-up hasalready allowed the discovery of three new transiting exoplanets, ogle-tr-111,113 and 132, presented in earlier letters (bouchy et al. 2004, pont et al.2004). here we analyse the data for the remaining 39 candidates. the radialvelocity data show that most of them are eclipsing binaries, in very variedconfigurations. precise radial velocity orbits were derived for 15 binaries,revealing 9 transits of small stars (generally m-dwarfs) in front of f-gdwarfs, 1 grazing equal-mass eclipsing binary, 4 triple and 1 quadruplesystems. a remaining 14 systems appear binary, but the exact orbit is uncertainor was not determined. 2 objects do not show any radial velocity variations inphase with the transit signal, and 6 do not possess spectral lines strongenough for a reliable cross-correlation function to be measured. among theselast two categories, up to 6 objects are suspected false positives of thephotometric transit detection. finally 2 objects are unsolved cases thatdeserve further observations. our study illustrates the wide variety of casesthat can mimic photometric planetary transits, and the importance ofspectroscopic follow-up. multi-fiber capacities and an optimized follow-upstrategy, which we present here, can help deal with the high number ofcandidates that are likely to turn up in the near future.

astro-ph;0510048	elodie metallicity-biased search for transiting hot jupiters i. two hot  jupiters orbiting the slightly evolved stars hd118203 and hd149143	we report the discovery of a new planet candidate orbiting the subgiant starhd118203 with a period of p=6.1335 days. the best keplerian solution yields aneccentricity e=0.31 and a minimum mass m2sin(i)=2.1mjup for the planet. thisstar has been observed with the elodie fiber-fed spectrograph as one of thetargets in our planet-search programme biased toward high-metallicity stars,on-going since march 2004 at the haute-provence observatory. an analysis of thespectroscopic line profiles using line bisectors revealed no correlationbetween the radial velocities and the line-bisector orientations, indicatingthat the periodic radial-velocity signal is best explained by the presence of aplanet-mass companion. a linear trend is observed in the residuals around theorbital solution that could be explained by the presence of a second companionin a longer-period orbit. we also present here our orbital solution for anotherslightly evolved star in our metal-rich sample, hd149143, recently proposed tohost a 4-d period hot jupiter by the n2k consortium. our solution yields aperiod p=4.09 days, a marginally significant eccentricity e=0.08 and aplanetary minimum mass of 1.36mjup. we checked that the shape of the spectrallines does not vary for this star as well.

astro-ph;0606395	high accuracy transit photometry of the planet ogle-tr-113b with a new  deconvolution-based method	a high accuracy photometry algorithm is needed to take full advantage of thepotential of the transit method for the characterization of exoplanets,especially in deep crowded fields. it has to reduce to the lowest possiblelevel the negative influence of systematic effects on the photometric accuracy.it should also be able to cope with a high level of crowding and with largescale variations of the spatial resolution from one image to another. a recentdeconvolution-based photometry algorithm fulfills all these requirements, andit also increases the resolution of astronomical images, which is an importantadvantage for the detection of blends and the discrimination of false positivesin transit photometry. we made some changes to this algorithm in order tooptimize it for transit photometry and used it to reduce ntt/susi2 observationsof two transits of ogle-tr-113b. this reduction has led to two very highprecision transit light curves with a low level of systematic residuals, usedtogether with former photometric and spectroscopic measurements to derive newstellar and planetary parameters in excellent agreement with previous ones, butsignificantly more precise.

astro-ph;0608669	kinematics of planet-host stars and their relation with dynamical  streams in the solar neighbourhood	we present a detailed study on the kinematics of metal-rich stars with andwithout planets, and their relation with the hyades, sirius and herculesdynamical streams in the solar neighbourhood. accurate kinematics have beenderived for all the stars belonging to the coralie planet search survey. weused precise radial velocity measurements and ccf parameters from the coraliedatabase, and parallaxes, photometry and proper motions from the hipparcos andtycho-2 catalogues. the location of stars with planets in the thin or thickdiscs has been analysed using both kinematic and chemical constraints. wecompare the kinematic behaviour of known planet-host stars to the remainingtargets belonging to the volume-limited sample, in particular to its metal-richpopulation. the high average metallicity of the hyades stream is confirmed. theplanet-host targets show a kinematic behaviour similar to that of themetal-rich comparison subsample, rather than to that of the comparison sampleas a whole, thus supporting a primordial origin for the metal excess observedin stars with known planetary companions. according to the scenarios proposedas an explanation for the dynamical streams, systems with giant planets couldhave formed more easily in metal-rich inner galactic regions and then beenbrought into the solar neighbourhood by dynamical streams.

astro-ph;0609259	on the age of stars harboring transiting planets	results of photometric surveys have brought to light the existence of apopulation of giant planets orbiting their host stars even closer than the hotjupiters (hj), with orbital periods below 3 days. the reason why radialvelocity surveys were not able to detect these very-hot jupiters (vhj) is underdiscussion. a possible explanation is that these close-in planets areshort-lived, being evaporated on short time-scales due to uv flux of their hoststars. in this case, stars hosting transiting vhj planets would besystematically younger than those in the radial velocity sample. we have usedthe uves spectrograph (vlt-ut2 telescope) to obtain high resolution spectra of5 faint stars hosting transiting planets, namely, ogle-tr-10, 56, 111, 113 andtres-1. previously obtained coralie spectra of hd189733, and published data onthe other transiting planet-hosts were also used. the immediate objective is toestimate ages via li abundances, using the ca ii activity-age relation, andfrom the analysis of the stellar rotational velocity. for the stars for whichwe have spectra, li abundances were computed as in israelian et al. (2004)using the stellar parameters derived in santos et al. (2006). the chromosphericactivity index $s_{us}$ was built as the ratio of the flux within the core ofthe ca ii h &amp; k lines and the flux in two nearby continuum regions. the index$s_{us}$ was calibrated to mount wilson index $s_{mw}$ allowing the computationof the ca ii h &amp; k corrected for the photospheric contribution. these valueswere then used to derive the ages by means of the henry et al. (1996)activity-age relation. bearing in mind the limitations of the ages derived byli abundances, chromospheric activity, and stellar rotational velocities, noneof the stars studied in this paper seem to be younger than 0.5 gyr.

astro-ph;0609418	a fast hybrid algorithm for exoplanetary transit searches	we present a fast and efficient hybrid algorithm for selecting exoplanetarycandidates from wide-field transit surveys. our method is based on thewidely-used sysrem and box least-squares (bls) algorithms. patterns ofsystematic error that are common to all stars on the frame are mapped andeliminated using the sysrem algorithm. the remaining systematic errors causedby spatially localised flat-fielding and other errors are quantified using aboxcar-smoothing method. we show that the dimensions of the search-parameterspace can be reduced greatly by carrying out an initial bls search on a coarsegrid of reduced dimensions, followed by newton-raphson refinement of thetransit parameters in the vicinity of the most significant solutions. weillustrate the method's operation by applying it to data from one field of thesuperwasp survey, comprising 2300 observations of 7840 stars brighter thanv=13.0. we identify 11 likely transit candidates. we reject stars that exhibitsignificant ellipsoidal variations indicative of a stellar-mass companion. weuse colours and proper motions from the 2mass and usno-b1.0 surveys to estimatethe stellar parameters and the companion radius. we find that two stars showingunambiguous transit signals pass all these tests, and so qualify for detailedhigh-resolution spectroscopic follow-up.

astro-ph;0609785	the hyades stream: evaporated cluster or intrusion from the inner disk?	the nature of the hyades stream, or hyades moving group, is a long-standingquestion of galactic astronomy. is this stream caused by non-axisymmetricperturbations of the galactic potential, such as transient or quasi-stationaryspiral waves, or by the on-going evaporation of the hyades cluster? a simpleobservational test has been designed to answer that question. using thegeneva-copenhagen survey of f and g dwarfs, we compare the mass distributionand metallicity of the stream to those of field disk stars. if the hyadesstream is composed of stars trapped at resonance, its mass distribution shouldobey the present-day mass function (pdmf) of the disk, and its metallicityshould reflect its origin in the inner regions of the galaxy. on the otherhand, if it is an evaporated cluster, we expect a different mass distribution,depending on the inital mass function (imf) of the cluster, and on theproportion of evaporated stars as a function of mass. we find that extremeconditions have to be adopted for the selective evaporation and imf of thecluster to make the observed mass ditribution of the stream only roughlyconsistent (at a one-sigma level) with the coeval evaporated cluster scenario.the observed mass distribution is in much better agreement with the pdmf of thefield. we also note that the peculiar metallicity of the stream is inconsistentwith that of a field population from the solar neighbourhood trapped in theprimordial cluster during its formation process and subsequently evaporated.these observations thus favour a resonant origin for the hyades stream.
