1001.1187	joint scheduling and arq for mu-mimo downlink in the presence of  inter-cell interference	user scheduling and multiuser multi-antenna (mu-mimo) transmission are at thecore of high rate data-oriented downlink schemes of the next-generation ofcellular systems (e.g., lte-advanced). scheduling selects groups of usersaccording to their channels vector directions and sinr levels. however, whenscheduling is applied independently in each cell, the inter-cell interference(ici) power at each user receiver is not known in advance since it changes ateach new scheduling slot depending on the scheduling decisions of allinterfering base stations. in order to cope with this uncertainty, we considerthe joint operation of scheduling, mu-mimo beamforming and automatic repeatrequest (arq). we develop a game-theoretic framework for this problem and buildon stochastic optimization techniques in order to find optimal scheduling andarq schemes. particularizing our framework to the case of "outage servicerates", we obtain a scheme based on adaptive variable-rate coding at thephysical layer, combined with arq at the logical link control (arq-llc). then,we present a novel scheme based on incremental redundancy hybrid arq (harq)that is able to achieve a throughput performance arbitrarily close to the"genie-aided service rates", with no need for a genie that providesnon-causally the ici power levels. the novel harq scheme is both easier toimplement and superior in performance with respect to the conventionalcombination of adaptive variable-rate coding and arq-llc.

1009.1193	coarse network coding: a simple relay strategy to resolve interference	reminiscent of the parity function in network coding for the butterflynetwork, it is shown that forwarding an even/odd indicator bit for a scalarquantization of a relay observation recovers 1 bit of information at the twodestinations in a noiseless interference channel where interference is treatedas noise. based on this observation, a coding strategy is proposed to improvethe rate of both users at the same time using a relay node in an interferencechannel. in this strategy, the relay observes a linear combination of the twosource signals, and broadcasts a common message to the two destinations over ashared out-of-band link of rate r0 bits per channel use. the relay messageconsists of the bin index of a structured binning scheme obtained from a2^r0-way partition of the squared lattice in the complex plane. we show thatsuch scalar quantization-binning relay strategy asymptotically achieves thecut-set bound in an interference channel with a common out-of-band relay linkof limited rate, improving the sum rate by two bits for every bit relayed,asymptotically at high signal to noise ratios (snr) and when interference istreated as noise. we then use low-density parity-check (ldpc) codes along withbit-interleaved coded-modulation (bicm) as a practical coding scheme for theproposed strategy. we consider matched and mismatched scenarios, depending onwhether the input alphabet of the interference signal is known or unknown tothe decoder, respectively. for the matched scenario, we show the proposedstrategy results in significant gains in snr. for the mismatched scenario, weshow that the proposed strategy results in rate improvements that, without therelay, cannot be achieved by merely increasing transmit powers. finally, we usegeneralized mutual information analysis to characterize the theoreticalperformance of the mismatched scenario and validate our simulation results.

1012.3198	network mimo with linear zero-forcing beamforming: large system  analysis, impact of channel estimation and reduced-complexity scheduling	we consider the downlink of a multi-cell system with multi-antenna basestations and single-antenna user terminals, arbitrary base station cooperationclusters, distance-dependent propagation pathloss, and general "fairness"requirements. base stations in the same cooperation cluster employ jointtransmission with linear zero-forcing beamforming, subject to sum or per-basestation power constraints. inter-cluster interference is treated as noise atthe user terminals. analytic expressions for the system spectral efficiency arefound in the large-system limit where both the numbers of users and antennasper base station tend to infinity with a given ratio. in particular, for theper-base station power constraint, we find new results in random matrix theory,yielding the squared frobenius norm of submatrices of the moore-penrosepseudo-inverse for the structured non-i.i.d. channel matrix resulting from thecooperation cluster, user distribution, and path-loss coefficients. theanalysis is extended to the case of non-ideal channel state information at thetransmitters (csit) obtained through explicit downlink channel training anduplink feedback. specifically, our results illuminate the trade-off between thebenefit of a larger number of cooperating antennas and the cost of estimatinghigher-dimensional channel vectors. furthermore, our analysis leads to a newsimplified downlink scheduling scheme that pre-selects the users according toprobabilities obtained from the large-system results, depending on the desiredfairness criterion. the proposed scheme performs close to the optimal(finite-dimensional) opportunistic user selection while requiring significantlyless channel state feedback, since only a small fraction of pre-selected usersmust feed back their channel state information.

1104.0430	two birds and one stone: gaussian interference channel with a shared  out-of-band relay of limited rate	the two-user gaussian interference channel with a shared out-of-band relay isconsidered. the relay observes a linear combination of the source signals andbroadcasts a common message to the two destinations, through a perfect link offixed limited rate $r_0$ bits per channel use. the out-of-band nature of therelay is reflected by the fact that the common relay message does not interferewith the received signal at the two destinations. a general achievable rate isestablished, along with upper bounds on the capacity region for the gaussiancase. for $r_0$ values below a certain threshold, which depends on channelparameters, the capacity region of this channel is determined in this paper towithin a constant gap of $\delta=1.95$ bits. we identify interference regimeswhere a two-for-one gain in achievable rates is possible for every bit relayed,up to a constant approximation error. instrumental to these results is acarefully-designed quantize-and-forward type of relay strategy along with ajoint decoding scheme employed at destination ends. further, we also studysuccessive decoding strategies with optimal decoding order (corresponding tothe order at which common, private, and relay messages are decoded), and showthat successive decoding also achieves two-for-one gains asymptotically inregimes where a two-for-one gain is achievable by joint decoding; yet,successive decoding produces unbounded loss asymptotically when compared tojoint decoding, in general.

1107.3862	achieving "massive mimo" spectral efficiency with a not-so-large number  of antennas	the main focus and contribution of this paper is a novel network-mimo tddarchitecture that achieves spectral efficiencies comparable with "massivemimo", with one order of magnitude fewer antennas per active user per cell. theproposed architecture is based on a family of network-mimo schemes defined bysmall clusters of cooperating base stations, zero-forcing multiuser mimoprecoding with suitable inter-cluster interference constraints, uplink pilotsignals reuse across cells, and frequency reuse. the key idea consists ofpartitioning the users population into geographically determined "bins", suchthat all users in the same bin are statistically equivalent, and use theoptimal network-mimo architecture in the family for each bin. a scheduler takescare of serving the different bins on the time-frequency slots, in order tomaximize a desired network utility function that captures some desired notionof fairness. this results in a mixed-mode network-mimo architecture, wheredifferent schemes, each of which is optimized for the served user bin, aremultiplexed in time-frequency. in order to carry out the performance analysisand the optimization of the proposed architecture in a clean andcomputationally efficient way, we consider the large-system regime where thenumber of users, the number of antennas, and the channel coherence block lengthgo to infinity with fixed ratios. the performance predicted by the large-systemasymptotic analysis matches very well the finite-dimensional simulations.overall, the system spectral efficiency obtained by the proposed architectureis similar to that achieved by "massive mimo", with a 10-fold reduction in thenumber of antennas at the base stations (roughly, from 500 to 50 antennas).

1109.4179	femtocaching: wireless video content delivery through distributed  caching helpers	video on-demand streaming from internet-based servers is becoming one of themost important services offered by wireless networks today. in order to improvethe area spectral efficiency of video transmission in cellular systems, smallcells heterogeneous architectures (e.g., femtocells, wifi off-loading) arebeing proposed, such that video traffic to nomadic users can be handled byshort-range links to the nearest small cell access points (referred to as"helpers"). as the helper deployment density increases, the backhaul capacitybecomes the system bottleneck. in order to alleviate such bottleneck we proposea system where helpers with low-rate backhaul but high storage capacity cachepopular video files. files not available from helpers are transmitted by thecellular base station. we analyze the optimum way of assigning files to thehelpers, in order to minimize the expected downloading time for files. wedistinguish between the uncoded case (where only complete files are stored) andthe coded case, where segments of fountain-encoded versions of the video filesare stored at helpers. we show that the uncoded optimum file assignment isnp-hard, and develop a greedy strategy that is provably within a factor 2 ofthe optimum. further, for a special case we provide an efficient algorithmachieving a provably better approximation ratio of $1-(1-1/d)^d$, where $d$ isthe maximum number of helpers a user can be connected to. we also show that thecoded optimum cache assignment problem is convex that can be further reduced toa linear program. we present numerical results comparing the proposed schemes.

1109.6371	multi-user mimo with outdated csi: training, feedback and scheduling	conventional mu-mimo techniques, e.g. linear zero-forced beamforming (lzfb),require sufficiently accurate channel state information at the transmitter(csit) in order to realize spectral efficient transmission (degree of freedomgains). in practical settings, however, csit accuracy can be limited by anumber of issues including csi estimation, csi feedback delay between userterminals to base stations, and the time/frequency coherence of the channel.the latter aspects of csit-feedback delay and channel-dynamics can lead tosignificant challenges in the deployment of efficient mu-mimo systems. recentlyit has been shown by maddah-ali and tse (mat) that degree of freedom gains canbe realized by mu-mimo even when the knowledge of csit is completely outdated.specifically, outdated csit, albeit perfect csit, is known for transmissionsonly after they have taken place. this aspect of insensitivity to csit-feedbackdelay is of particular interest since it allows one to reconsider mu-mimodesign in dynamic channel conditions. indeed, as we show, with appropriatescheduling, and even in the context of csi estimation and feedback errors, theproposed mat scheme can have performance advantages over conventional mu-mimoin such scenarios.

1205.6862	airsync: enabling distributed multiuser mimo with full spatial  multiplexing	the enormous success of advanced wireless devices is pushing the demand forhigher wireless data rates. denser spectrum reuse through the deployment ofmore access points per square mile has the potential to successfully meet theincreasing demand for more bandwidth. in theory, the best approach to densityincrease is via distributed multiuser mimo, where several access points areconnected to a central server and operate as a large distributed multi-antennaaccess point, ensuring that all transmitted signal power serves the purpose ofdata transmission, rather than creating "interference." in practice, whileenterprise networks offer a natural setup in which distributed mimo might bepossible, there are serious implementation difficulties, the primary one beingthe need to eliminate phase and timing offsets between the jointly coordinatedaccess points.  in this paper we propose airsync, a novel scheme which provides not only timebut also phase synchronization, thus enabling distributed mimo with fullspatial multiplexing gains. airsync locks the phase of all access points usinga common reference broadcasted over the air in conjunction with a kalman filterwhich closely tracks the phase drift. we have implemented airsync as a digitalcircuit in the fpga of the warp radio platform. our experimental testbed,comprised of two access points and two clients, shows that airsync is able toachieve phase synchronization within a few degrees, and allows the system tonearly achieve the theoretical optimal multiplexing gain. we also discuss macand higher layer aspects of a practical deployment. to the best of ourknowledge, airsync offers the first ever realization of the full multiuser mimogain, namely the ability to increase the number of wireless clients linearlywith the number of jointly coordinated access points, without reducing the perclient rate.

1305.5216	wireless device-to-device caching networks: basic principles and system  performance	as wireless video transmission is the fastest-growing form of data traffic,methods for spectrally efficient video on-demand wireless streaming areessential to service providers and users alike. a key property of videoon-demand is the asynchronous content reuse, such that a few dominant videosaccount for a large part of the traffic, but are viewed by users at differenttimes. caching of content on devices in conjunction with d2d communicationsallows to exploit this property, and provide a network throughput that issignificantly in excess of both the conventional approach of unicasting fromthe base station and the traditional d2d networks for regular data traffic.this paper presents in a semi-tutorial concise form some recent results on thethroughput scaling laws of wireless networks with caching and asynchronouscontent reuse, contrasting the d2d approach with a competing approach based oncombinatorial cache design and network coded transmission from the base station(bs) only, referred to as coded multicasting. interestingly, the spatial reusegain of the former and the coded multicasting gain of the latter yield, somehowsurprisingly, the same near-optimal throughput behavior in the relevant regimewhere the number of video files in the library is smaller than the number ofstreaming users. based on our recent theoretical results, we propose a holisticd2d system design that incorporates traditional microwave (2 ghz) as well asmillimeter-wave d2d links; the direct connections to the base station can beused to provide those rare video requests that cannot be found in local caches.we provide extensive simulations under a variety of system settings, andcompare our scheme with other existing schemes by the bs. we show that, despitethe similar behavior of the scaling laws, the proposed d2d approach offers verysignificant throughput gains with respect to the bs-only schemes.

1307.2672	index coding problem with side information repositories	to tackle the expected enormous increase in mobile video traffic in cellularnetworks, an architecture involving a base station along with caching femtostations (referred to as helpers), storing popular files near users, has beenproposed [1]. the primary benefit of caching is the enormous increase indownloading rate when a popular file is available at helpers near a userrequesting that file. in this work, we explore a secondary benefit of cachingin this architecture through the lens of index coding. we assume a system withn users and constant number of caching helpers. only helpers store files, i.e.have side information. we investigate the following scenario: each userrequests a distinct file that is not found in the set of helpers nearby. usersare served coded packets (through an index code) by an omniscient base station.every user decodes its desired packet from the coded packets and the sideinformation packets from helpers nearby. we assume that users can obtain anyfile stored in their neighboring helpers without incurring transmission costs.with respect to the index code employed, we investigate two achievable schemes:1) xor coloring based on coloring of the side information graph associated withthe problem and 2)vector xor coloring based on fractional coloring of the sideinformation graph. we show that the general problem reduces to a canonicalproblem where every user is connected to exactly one helper under sometopological constraints. for the canonical problem, with constant number ofhelpers (k), we show that the complexity of computing the best xor/vector xorcoloring schemes are polynomial in the number of users n. the result exploits aspecial complete bi-partite structure that the side information graphs exhibitfor any finite k.

0801.2588	coding and decoding for the dynamic decode and forward relay protocol	we study the dynamic decode and forward (ddf) protocol for a singlehalf-duplex relay, single-antenna channel with quasi-static fading. the ddfprotocol is well-known and has been analyzed in terms of thediversity-multiplexing tradeoff (dmt) in the infinite block length limit. wecharacterize the finite block length dmt and give new explicit codeconstructions. the finite block length analysis illuminates a few key aspectsthat have been neglected in the previous literature: 1) we show that onedominating cause of degradation with respect to the infinite block lengthregime is the event of decoding error at the relay; 2) we explicitly take intoaccount the fact that the destination does not generally know a priori therelay decision time at which the relay switches from listening to transmitmode. both the above problems can be tackled by a careful design of thedecoding algorithm. in particular, we introduce a decision rejection criterionat the relay based on forney's decision rule (a variant of the neyman-pearsonrule), such that the relay triggers transmission only when its decision isreliable. also, we show that a receiver based on the generalized likelihoodratio test rule that jointly decodes the relay decision time and theinformation message achieves the optimal dmt. our results show that no cyclicredundancy check (crc) for error detection or additional protocol overhead tocommunicate the decision time are needed for ddf. finally, we investigate theuse of minimum mean squared error generalized decision feedback equalizer(mmse-gdfe) lattice decoding at both the relay and the destination, and showthat it provides near optimal performance at moderate complexity.

1308.0870	on interference networks over finite fields	we present a framework to study linear deterministic interference networksover finite fields. unlike the popular linear deterministic models introducedto study gaussian networks, we consider networks where the channel coefficientsare general scalars over some extension field $\ff_{p^m}$ (scalar $m$-thextension-field models), $m \times m$ diagonal matrices over $\ff_p$($m$-symbol extension ground-field models), and $m \times m$ generalnon-singular matrices (mimo ground field models). we use the companion matrixrepresentation of the extension field to convert $m$-th extension scalar modelsinto mimo ground-field models where the channel matrices have special algebraicstructure. for such models, we consider the $2 \times 2 \times 2$ topology(two-hops two-flow) and the 3-user interference network topology. we deriveachievability results and feasibility conditions for certain schemes based onthe precoding-based network alignment (pbna) approach, where intermediate nodesuse random linear network coding (i.e., propagate random linear combinations oftheir incoming messages) and non-trivial precoding/decoding is performed onlyat the network edges, at the sources and destinations. furthermore, we applythis approach to the scalar $2\times 2\times 2$ complex gaussian ic with fixedchannel coefficients, and show two competitive schemes outperforming otherknown approaches at any snr, where we combine finite-field linearprecoding/decoding with lattice coding and the compute and forward approach atthe signal level. as a side result, we also show significant advantages ofvector linear network coding both in terms of feasibility probability (withrandom coding coefficients) and in terms of coding latency, with respect tostandard scalar linear network coding, in pbna schemes.

1310.7001	scalable synchronization and reciprocity calibration for distributed  multiuser mimo	large-scale distributed multiuser mimo (mu-mimo) is a promising wirelessnetwork architecture that combines the advantages of "massive mimo" and "smallcells." it consists of several access points (aps) connected to a centralserver via a wired backhaul network and acting as a large distributed antennasystem. we focus on the downlink, which is both more demanding in terms oftraffic and more challenging in terms of implementation than the uplink. inorder to enable multiuser joint precoding of the downlink signals, channelstate information at the transmitter side is required. we consider timedivision duplex (tdd), where the {\em downlink} channels can be learned fromthe user uplink pilot signals, thanks to channel reciprocity. furthermore,coherent multiuser joint precoding is possible only if the aps maintain asufficiently accurate relative timing and phase synchronization. apsynchronization and tdd reciprocity calibration are two key problems to besolved in order to enable distributed mu-mimo downlink. in this paper, wepropose novel over-the-air synchronization and calibration protocols that scalewell with the network size. the proposed schemes can be applied to networksformed by a large number of aps, each of which is driven by an inexpensive802.11-grade clock and has a standard rf front-end, not explicitly designed tobe reciprocal. our protocols can incorporate, as a building block, any suitabletiming and frequency estimator. here we revisit the problem of joint ml timingand frequency estimation and use the corresponding cramer-rao bound to evaluatethe performance of the synchronization protocol. overall, the proposedsynchronization and calibration schemes are shown to achieve sufficientaccuracy for satisfactory distributed mu-mimo performance.

1311.6247	full-duplex relaying with half-duplex relays	we consider "virtual" full-duplex relaying by means of half-duplex relays. inthis configuration, each relay stage in a multi-hop relaying network is formedby at least two relays, used alternatively in transmit and receive modes, suchthat while one relay transmits its signal to the next stage, the other relayreceives a signal from the previous stage. with such a pipelined scheme, thesource is active and sends a new information message in each time slot. weconsider the achievable rates for different coding schemes and compare themwith a cut-set upper bound, which is tight in certain conditions. inparticular, we show that both lattice-based compute and forward (cof) andquantize remap and forward (qmf) yield attractive performance and can be easilyimplemented. in particular, qmf in this context does not require "long"messages and joint (non-unique) decoding, if the quantization mean-squaredistortion at the relays is chosen appropriately. also, in the multi-hop casethe gap of qmf from the cut-set upper bound grows logarithmically with thenumber of stages, and not linearly as in the case of "noise level"quantization. furthermore, we show that cof is particularly attractive in thecase of multi-hop relaying, when the channel gains have fluctuations not largerthan 3db, yielding a rate that does not depend on the number of relayingstages. in particular, we argue that such architecture may be useful for awireless backhaul with line-of-sight propagation between the relays.

1312.2045	joint spatial division and multiplexing for mm-wave channels	massive mimo systems are well-suited for mm-wave communications, as largearrays can be built with reasonable form factors, and the high array gainsenable reasonable coverage even for outdoor communications. one of the mainobstacles for using such systems in frequency-division duplex mode, namely thehigh overhead for the feedback of channel state information (csi) to thetransmitter, can be mitigated by the recently proposed jsdm (joint spatialdivision and multiplexing) algorithm. in this paper we analyze the performanceof this algorithm in some realistic propagation channels that take into accountthe partial overlap of the angular spectra from different users, as well as thesparsity of mm-wave channels. we formulate the problem of user grouping for twodifferent objectives, namely maximizing spatial multiplexing, and maximizingtotal received power, in a graph-theoretic framework. as the resulting problemsare numerically difficult, we proposed (sub optimum) greedy algorithms asefficient solution methods. numerical examples show that the differentalgorithms may be superior in different settings.we furthermore develop a new,"degenerate" version of jsdm that only requires average csi at the transmitter,and thus greatly reduces the computational burden. evaluations in propagationchannels obtained from ray tracing results, as well as in measured outdoorchannels show that this low-complexity version performs surprisingly well inmm-wave channels.

1312.2135	a repair framework for scalar mds codes	several works have developed vector-linear maximum-distance separable (mds)storage codes that min- imize the total communication cost required to repair asingle coded symbol after an erasure, referred to as repair bandwidth (bw).vector codes allow communicating fewer sub-symbols per node, instead of theentire content. this allows non trivial savings in repair bw. in sharpcontrast, classic codes, like reed- solomon (rs), used in current storagesystems, are deemed to suffer from naive repair, i.e. downloading the entirestored message to repair one failed node. this mainly happens because they arescalar-linear. in this work, we present a simple framework that treats scalarcodes as vector-linear. in some cases, this allows significant savings inrepair bw. we show that vectorized scalar codes exhibit properties thatsimplify the design of repair schemes. our framework can be seen as a finitefield analogue of real interference alignment. using our simplified framework,we design a scheme that we call clique-repair which provably identifies thebest linear repair strategy for any scalar 2-parity mds code, under someconditions on the sub-field chosen for vectorization. we specify optimal repairschemes for specific (5,3)- and (6,4)-reed- solomon (rs) codes. further, wepresent a repair strategy for the rs code currently deployed in the facebookanalytics hadoop cluster that leads to 20% of repair bw savings over naiverepair which is the repair scheme currently used for this code.

1312.2637	the throughput-outage tradeoff of wireless one-hop caching networks	we consider a wireless device-to-device (d2d) network where the nodes havepre-cached information from a library of available files. nodes request filesat random. if the requested file is not in the on-board cache, then it isdownloaded from some neighboring node via one-hop "local" communication. anoutage event occurs when a requested file is not found in the neighborhood ofthe requesting node, or if the network admission control policy decides not toserve the request. we characterize the optimal throughput-outage tradeoff interms of tight scaling laws for various regimes of the system parameters, whenboth the number of nodes and the number of files in the library grow toinfinity. our analysis is based on gupta and kumar {\em protocol model} for theunderlying d2d wireless network, widely used in the literature on capacityscaling laws of wireless networks without caching. our results show that thecombination of d2d spectrum reuse and caching at the user nodes yields aper-user throughput independent of the number of users, for any fixed outageprobability in $(0,1)$. this implies that the d2d caching network is"scalable": even though the number of users increases, each user achievesconstant throughput. this behavior is very different from the classical guptaand kumar result on ad-hoc wireless networks, for which the per-user throughputvanishes as the number of users increases. furthermore, we show that the userthroughput is directly proportional to the fraction of cached information overthe whole file library size. therefore, we can conclude that d2d cachingnetworks can turn "memory" into "bandwidth" (i.e., doubling the on-board cachememory on the user devices yields a 100\% increase of the user throughout).

1401.6476	adaptive video streaming in mu-mimo networks	we consider extensions and improvements on our previous work on dynamicadaptive video streaming in a multi-cell multiuser ``small cell'' wirelessnetwork. previously, we treated the case of single-antenna base stations and,starting from a network utility maximization (num) formulation, we devised a``push'' scheduling policy, where users place requests to sequential videochunks to possibly different base stations with adaptive video quality, andbase stations schedule their downlink transmissions in order to stabilize theirtransmission queues. in this paper we consider a ``pull'' strategy, where everyuser maintains a request queue, such that users keep track of the video chunksthat are effectively delivered. the pull scheme allows to download the chunksin the playback order without skipping or missing them. in addition, motivatedby the recent/forthcoming progress in small cell networks (e.g., in wave-2 ofthe recent ieee 802.11ac standard), we extend our dynamic streaming approach tothe case of base stations capable of multiuser mimo downlink, i.e., servingmultiple users on the same time-frequency slot by spatial multiplexing. byexploiting the ``channel hardening'' effect of high dimensional mimo channels,we devise a low complexity user selection scheme to solve the underlyingmax-weighted rate scheduling, which can be easily implemented and runsindependently at each base station. through simulations, we show mimo gains interms of video streaming qoe metrics like the pre-buffering and re-bufferingtimes.

1402.1815	on the performance of optimized dense device-to-device wireless networks	we consider a d2d wireless network where $n$ users are densely deployed in asquared planar region and communicate with each other without the help of awired infrastructure. for this network, we examine the 3-phase hierarchicalcooperation (hc) scheme and the 2-phase improved hc scheme based on the conceptof {\em network multiple access}. exploiting recent results on the optimalityof treating interference as noise in gaussian interference channels, weoptimize the achievable average per-link rate and not just its scaling law. inaddition, we provide further improvements on both the previously proposedhierarchical cooperation schemes by a more efficient use of tdma and spatialreuse. thanks to our explicit achievable rate expressions, we can compare hcscheme with multihop routing (mr), where the latter can be regarded as thecurrent practice of d2d wireless networks. our results show that the improvedand optimized hc schemes yield very significant rate gains over mr in realisticconditions of channel propagation exponents, signal to noise ratio, and numberof users. this sheds light on the long-standing question about the realadvantage of hc scheme over mr beyond the well-known scaling laws analysis. incontrast, we also show that our rate optimization is non-trivial, since when hcis applied with off-the-shelf choice of the system parameters, no significantrate gain with respect to mr is achieved. we also show that for large pathlossexponent the sum rate is a nearly linear function of the number of users $n$ inthe range of networks of practical size. this also sheds light on along-standing dispute on the effective achievability of linear sum rate scalingwith hc. finally, we notice that the achievable sum rate for large $\alpha$ ismuch larger than for small $\alpha$. this suggests that hc scheme may be a veryeffective approach for networks operating at mm-waves.

1402.3119	cellular interference alignment	interference alignment promises that, in gaussian interference channels, eachlink can support half of a degree of freedom (dof) per pair of transmit-receiveantennas. however, in general, this result requires to precode the data bearingsignals over a signal space of asymptotically large diversity, e.g., over aninfinite number of dimensions for time-frequency varying fading channels, orover an infinite number of rationally independent signal levels, in the case oftime-frequency invariant channels. in this work we consider a wireless cellularsystem scenario where the promised optimal dofs are achieved with linearprecoding in one-shot (i.e., over a single time-frequency slot). we focus onthe uplink of a symmetric cellular system, where each cell is split into threesectors with orthogonal intra-sector multiple access. in our model,interference is "local", i.e., it is due to transmitters in neighboring cellsonly. we consider a message-passing backhaul network architecture, in whichnearby sectors can exchange already decoded messages and propose an alignmentsolution that can achieve the optimal dofs. to avoid signaling schemes relyingon the strength of interference, we further introduce the notion of\emph{topologically robust} schemes, which are able to guarantee a minimum rate(or dofs) irrespectively of the strength of the interfering links. towards thisend, we design an alignment scheme which is topologically robust and stillachieves the same optimum dofs.

0802.2975	hard fairness versus proportional fairness in wireless communications:  the multiple-cell case	we consider the uplink of a cellular communication system with $k$ users percell and infinite base stations equally spaced on a line. the system isconventional, i.e., it does not make use of joint cell-site processing. a hardfairness (hf) system serves all users with the same rate in any channel state.in contrast, a system based on proportional fairness serves the users withvariable instantaneous rates depending on their channel state. we compare thesetwo options in terms of the system spectral efficiency \textsf{c} (bit/s/hz)versus $e_b/n_0$. proportional fair scheduling (pfs) performs generally betterthan the more restrictive hf system in the regime of low to moderate snr, butfor high snr an optimized hf system achieves throughput comparable to that ofpfs system for finite $k$. the hard-fairness system is interference limited. wecharacterize this limit and validate a commonly used simplified model thattreats outer cell interference power as proportional to the in-cell total powerand we analytically characterize the proportionality constant. in contrast, thespectral efficiency of pfs can grow unbounded for $k \to \infty$ thanks to themultiuser diversity effect. we also show that partial frequency/time reuse canmitigate the throughput penalty of the hf system, especially at high snr.

1402.4572	caching and coded multicasting: multiple groupcast index coding	the capacity of caching networks has received considerable attention in thepast few years. a particularly studied setting is the case of a single server(e.g., a base station) and multiple users, each of which caches segments offiles in a finite library. each user requests one (whole) file in the libraryand the server sends a common coded multicast message to satisfy all users atonce. the problem consists of finding the smallest possible codeword length tosatisfy such requests. in this paper we consider the generalization to the casewhere each user places $l \geq 1$ requests. the obvious naive scheme consistsof applying $l$ times the order-optimal scheme for a single request, obtaininga linear in $l$ scaling of the multicast codeword length. we propose a newachievable scheme based on multiple groupcast index coding that achieves asignificant gain over the naive scheme. furthermore, through an informationtheoretic converse we find that the proposed scheme is approximately optimalwithin a constant factor of (at most) $18$.

1404.6320	demystifying the scaling laws of dense wireless networks: no linear  scaling in practice	we optimize the hierarchical cooperation protocol of ozgur, leveque and tse,which is supposed to yield almost linear scaling of the capacity of a densewireless network with the number of users $n$. exploiting recent results on theoptimality of "treating interference as noise" in gaussian interferencechannels, we are able to optimize the achievable average per-link rate and notjust its scaling law. our optimized hierarchical cooperation protocolsignificantly outperforms the originally proposed scheme. on the negative side,we show that even for very large $n$, the rate scaling is far from linear, andthe optimal number of stages $t$ is less than 4, instead of $t \rightarrow\infty$ as required for almost linear scaling. combining our results and thefact that, beyond a certain user density, the network capacity is fundamentallylimited by maxwell laws, as shown by francheschetti, migliore and minero, weargue that there is indeed no intermediate regime of linear scaling for densenetworks in practice.

1404.6512	cellular interference alignment: omni-directional antennas and  asymmetric configurations	although interference alignment (ia) can theoretically achieve the optimaldegrees of freedom (dofs) in the $k$-user gaussian interference channel, itsdirect application comes at the prohibitive cost of precoding overexponentially-many signaling dimensions. on the other hand, it is known thatpractical "one-shot" ia precoding (i.e., linear schemes without symbolexpansion) provides a vanishing dofs gain in large fully-connected networkswith generic channel coefficients. in our previous work, we introduced theconcept of "cellular ia" for a network topology induced by hexagonal cells withsectors and nearest-neighbor interference. assuming that neighboring sectorscan exchange decoded messages (and not received signal samples) in the uplink,we showed that linear one-shot ia precoding over $m$ transmit/receive antennascan achieve the optimal $m/2$ dofs per user. in this paper we extend thisframework to networks with omni-directional (non-sectorized) cells and considerthe practical scenario where users have $2$ antennas, and base-stations have$2$, $3$ or $4$ antennas. in particular, we provide linear one-shot ia schemesfor the $2\times 2$, $2\times3$ and $2\times 4$ cases, and show theachievability of $3/4$, $1$ and $7/6$ dofs per user, respectively. dofsconverses for one-shot schemes require the solution of a discrete optimizationproblem over a number of variables that grows with the network size. we developa new approach to transform such challenging optimization problem into atractable linear program (lp) with significantly fewer variables. this approachis used to show that the achievable $3/4$ dofs per user are indeed optimal fora large (extended) cellular network with $2\times 2$ links.

1405.5336	fundamental limits of caching in wireless d2d networks	we consider a wireless device-to-device (d2d) network where communication isrestricted to be single-hop. users make arbitrary requests from a finitelibrary of files and have pre-cached information on their devices, subject to aper-node storage capacity constraint. a similar problem has already beenconsidered in an ``infrastructure'' setting, where all users receive a commonmulticast (coded) message from a single omniscient server (e.g., a base stationhaving all the files in the library) through a shared bottleneck link. in thiswork, we consider a d2d ``infrastructure-less'' version of the problem. wepropose a caching strategy based on deterministic assignment of subpackets ofthe library files, and a coded delivery strategy where the users send linearlycoded messages to each other in order to collectively satisfy their demands. wealso consider a random caching strategy, which is more suitable to a fullydecentralized implementation. under certain conditions, both approaches canachieve the information theoretic outer bound within a constant multiplicativefactor. in our previous work, we showed that a caching d2d wireless networkwith one-hop communication, random caching, and uncoded delivery, achieves thesame throughput scaling law of the infrastructure-based coded multicastingscheme, in the regime of large number of users and files in the library. thisshows that the spatial reuse gain of the d2d network is order-equivalent to thecoded multicasting gain of single base station transmission. it is thereforenatural to ask whether these two gains are cumulative, i.e.,if a d2d networkwith both local communication (spatial reuse) and coded multicasting canprovide an improved scaling law. somewhat counterintuitively, we show thatthese gains do not cumulate (in terms of throughput scaling law).

1405.5864	caching eliminates the wireless bottleneck in video-aware wireless  networks	cellular data traffic almost doubles every year, greatly straining networkcapacity. the main driver for this development is wireless video. traditionalmethods for capacity increase (like using more spectrum and increasing basestation density) are very costly, and do not exploit the unique features ofvideo, in particular a high degree of {\em asynchronous content reuse}. in thispaper we give an overview of our work that proposed and detailed a newtransmission paradigm exploiting content reuse, and the fact that storage isthe fastest-increasing quantity in modern hardware. our network structure usescaching in helper stations (femto-caching) and/or devices, combined with highlyspectrally efficient short-range communications to deliver video files. forfemto-caching, we develop optimum storage schemes and dynamic streamingpolicies that optimize video quality. for caching on devices, combined withdevice-to-device communications, we show that communications within {\emclusters} of mobile stations should be used; the cluster size can be adjustedto optimize the tradeoff between frequency reuse and the probability that adevice finds a desired file cached by another device in the same cluster. weshow that in many situations the network throughput increases linearly with thenumber of users, and that d2d communications also is superior in providing abetter tradeoff between throughput and outage than traditional base-stationcentric systems. simulation results with realistic numbers of users and channelconditions show that network throughput (possibly with outage constraints) canbe increased by two orders of magnitude compared to conventional schemes.

1407.5716	massive-mimo meets hetnet: interference coordination through spatial  blanking	in this paper, we study the downlink performance of a heterogeneous cellularnetwork (hetnet) where both macro and small cells share the same spectrum andhence interfere with each other. we assume that the users are concentrated atcertain areas in the cell, i.e., they form hotspots. while some of the hotspotsare assumed to have a small cell in their vicinity, the others are directlyserved by the macrocell. due to a relatively small area of each hotspot, theusers lying in a particular hotspot appear to be almost co-located to themacrocells, which are typically deployed at some elevation. assuming largenumber of antennas at the macrocell, we exploit this directionality in thechannel vectors to obtain spatial blanking, i.e., concentrating transmissionenergy only in certain directions while creating transmission opportunities forthe small cells lying in the other directions. in addition to this inherentinterference suppression, we also develop three low-complexity interferencecoordination strategies: (i) turn off small cells based on the amount ofcross-tier interference they receive or cause to the scheduled macrocellhotspots, (ii) schedule hotspots such that treating interference as noise isapproximately optimal for the resulting gaussian interference channel, and(iii) offload some of the macrocell hotspots to nearby small cells in order toimprove throughput fairness across all hotspots. for all these schemes, westudy the relative merits and demerits of uniform deployment of small cells vs.deploying more small cells towards the cell center or the cell edge.

1407.6731	optimal user-cell association for massive mimo wireless networks	the use of a very large number of antennas at each base station site(referred to as "massive mimo") is one of the most promising approaches to copewith the predicted wireless data traffic explosion. in combination with timedivision duplex and with simple per-cell processing, it achieves largethroughput per cell, low latency, and attractive power efficiency performance.following the current wireless technology trend of moving to higher frequencybands and denser small cell deployments, a large number of antennas can beimplemented within a small form factor even in small cell base stations. in aheterogeneous network formed by large (macro) and small cell bss, a key systemoptimization problem consists of "load balancing", that is, associating usersto bss in order to avoid congested hot-spots and/or under-utilizedinfrastructure. in this paper, we consider the user-bs association problem fora massive mimo heterogeneous network. we formulate the problem as a networkutility maximization, and provide a centralized solution in terms of thefraction of transmission resources (time-frequency slots) over which each useris served by a given bs. furthermore, we show that such a solution isphysically realizable, i.e., there exists a sequence of integer schedulingconfigurations realizing (by time-sharing) the optimal fractions. while thissolution is optimal, it requires centralized computation. then, we alsoconsider decentralized user-centric schemes, formulated as non-cooperativegames where each user makes individual selfish association decisions based onlyon its local information. we identify a class of schemes such that their nashequilibrium is very close to the global centralized optimum. hence, theseuser-centric algorithms are attractive not only for their simplicity and fullydecentralized implementation, but also because they operate near the system"social" optimum.

1502.02943	a control-theoretic approach to adaptive video streaming in dense  wireless networks	recently, the way people consume video content has been undergoing a dramaticchange. plain tv sets, that have been the center of home entertainment for along time, are losing grounds to hybrid tv's, pc's, game consoles, and, morerecently, mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones. the new predominantparadigm is: watch what i want, when i want, and where i want.  the challenges of this shift are manifold. on the one hand, broadcasttechnologies such as dvb-t/c/s need to be extended or replaced by mechanismssupporting asynchronous viewing, such as iptv and video streaming overbest-effort networks, while remaining scalable to millions of users. on theother hand, the dramatic increase of wireless data traffic begins to stretchthe capabilities of the existing wireless infrastructure to its limits.finally, there is a challenge to video streaming technologies to cope with ahigh heterogeneity of end-user devices and dynamically changing networkconditions, in particular in wireless and mobile networks.  in the present work, our goal is to design an efficient system that supportsa high number of unicast streaming sessions in a dense wireless access network.we address this goal by jointly considering the two problems of wirelesstransmission scheduling and video quality adaptation, using techniques inspiredby the robustness and simplicity of proportional-integral-derivative (pid)controllers. we show that the control-theoretic approach allows to efficientlyutilize available wireless resources, providing high quality of experience(qoe) to a large number of users.

1502.03124	order-optimal rate of caching and coded multicasting with random demands	we consider the canonical {\em shared link network} formed by a source node,hosting a library of $m$ information messages (files), connected via anoiseless common link to $n$ destination nodes (users), each with a cache ofsize m files. users request files at random and independently, according to agiven a-priori demand distribution $\qv$. a coding scheme for this networkconsists of a caching placement (i.e., a mapping of the library files into theuser caches) and delivery scheme (i.e., a mapping for the library files anduser demands into a common multicast codeword) such that, after the codewordtransmission, all users can retrieve their requested file. the rate of thescheme is defined as the {\em average} codeword length normalized with respectto the length of one file, where expectation is taken over the random userdemands. for the same shared link network, in the case of deterministicdemands, the optimal min-max rate has been characterized within a uniformbound, independent of the network parameters. in particular, fractional caching(i.e., storing file segments) and using linear network coding has been shown toprovide a min-max rate reduction proportional to 1/m with respect to standardschemes such as unicasting or "naive" uncoded multicasting. the case of randomdemands was previously considered by applying the same order-optimal min-maxscheme separately within groups of files requested with similar probability.however, no order-optimal guarantee was provided for random demands under theaverage rate performance criterion. in this paper, we consider the randomdemand setting and provide general achievability and converse results. inparticular, we consider a family of schemes that combine random fractionalcaching according to a probability distribution $\pv$ that depends on thedemand distribution $\qv$, with a linear coded delivery scheme based on ...

1504.00041	optimality of treating interference as noise: a combinatorial  perspective	for single-antenna gaussian interference channels, we re-formulate theproblem of determining the generalized degrees of freedom (gdof) regionachievable by treating interference as gaussian noise (tin) derived in [3] froma combinatorial perspective. we show that the tin power control problem can becast into an assignment problem, such that the globally optimal powerallocation variables can be obtained by well-known polynomial time algorithms.furthermore, the expression of the tin-achievable gdof region (tina region) canbe substantially simplified with the aid of maximum weighted matchings. we alsoprovide conditions under which the tina region is a convex polytope that relaxthose in [3]. for these new conditions, together with a channel connectivity(i.e., interference topology) condition, we show tin optimality for a new classof interference networks that is not included, nor includes, the class found in[3].  building on the above insights, we consider the problem of joint linkscheduling and power control in wireless networks, which has been widelystudied as a basic physical layer mechanism for device-to-device (d2d)communications. inspired by the relaxed tin channel strength condition as wellas the assignment-based power allocation, we propose a low-complexitygdof-based distributed link scheduling and power control mechanism (itlinq+)that improves upon the itlinq scheme proposed in [4] and further improves overthe heuristic approach known as flashlinq. it is demonstrated by simulationthat itlinq+ provides significant average network throughput gains over bothitlinq and flashlinq, and yet still maintains the same level of implementationcomplexity. more notably, the energy efficiency of the newly proposed itlinq+is substantially larger than that of itlinq and flashlinq, which is desirablefor d2d networks formed by battery-powered devices.

1505.02896	on the role of transmit correlation diversity in multiuser mimo systems	correlation across transmit antennas, in multiple antenna systems (mimo), hasbeen studied in various scenarios and has been shown to be detrimental orprovide benefits depending on the particular system and underlying assumptions.in this paper, we investigate the effect of transmit correlation on thecapacity of the gaussian mimo broadcast channel (bc), with a particularinterest in the large-scale array (or massive mimo) regime. to this end, weintroduce a new type of diversity, referred to as transmit correlationdiversity, which captures the fact that the channel vectors of different usersmay have different, and often nearly mutually orthogonal, large-scale channeleigen-directions. in particular, when taking the cost of downlink trainingproperly into account, transmit correlation diversity can yield significantcapacity gains in all regimes of interest. our analysis shows that the systemmultiplexing gain can be increased by a factor up to $\lfloor{m}/{r}\rfloor$,where $m$ is the number of antennas and $r\le m$ is the common rank of theusers transmit correlation matrices, with respect to standard schemes that areagnostic of the transmit correlation and treat the channels as if they wereisotropically distributed. thus, this new form of diversity reveals itself as avaluable "new resource" in multiuser communications.

0805.1327	bit-interleaved coded modulation revisited: a mismatched decoding  perspective	we revisit the information-theoretic analysis of bit-interleaved codedmodulation (bicm) by modeling the bicm decoder as a mismatched decoder. themismatched decoding model is well-defined for finite, yet arbitrary, blocklengths, and naturally captures the channel memory among the bits belonging tothe same symbol. we give two independent proofs of the achievability of thebicm capacity calculated by caire et al. where bicm was modeled as a set ofindependent parallel binary-input channels whose output is the bitwiselog-likelihood ratio. our first achievability proof uses typical sequences, andshows that due to the random coding construction, the interleaver is notrequired. the second proof is based on the random coding error exponents withmismatched decoding, where the largest achievable rate is the generalizedmutual information. we show that the generalized mutual information of themismatched decoder coincides with the infinite-interleaver bicm capacity. wealso show that the error exponent -and hence the cutoff rate- of the bicmmismatched decoder is upper bounded by that of coded modulation and may thus belower than in the infinite-interleaved model. we also consider the mutualinformation appearing in the analysis of iterative decoding of bicm with exitcharts. we show that the corresponding symbol metric has knowledge of thetransmitted symbol and the exit mutual information admits a representation as apseudo-generalized mutual information, which is in general not achievable. adifferent symbol decoding metric, for which the extrinsic side informationrefers to the hypothesized symbol, induces a generalized mutual informationlower than the coded modulation capacity.

1505.06856	wiflix: adaptive video streaming in massive mu-mimo wireless networks	we consider the problem of simultaneous on-demand streaming of stored videoto multiple users in a multi-cell wireless network where multiple unicaststreaming sessions are run in parallel and share the same frequency band. eachstreaming session is formed by the sequential transmission of video "chunks,"such that each chunk arrives into the corresponding user playback buffer withinits playback deadline. we formulate the problem as a network utilitymaximization (num) where the objective is to fairly maximize users' videostreaming quality of experience (qoe) and then derive an iterative controlpolicy using lyapunov optimization, which solves the num problem up to anylevel of accuracy and yields an online protocol with control actions at everyiteration decomposing into two layers interconnected by the users' requestqueues : i) a video streaming adaptation layer reminiscent of dash, implementedat each user node; ii) a transmission scheduling layer where a max-weightscheduler is implemented at each base station. the proposed chunk requestscheme is a pull strategy where every user opportunistically requests videochunks from the neighboring base stations and dynamically adapts the quality ofits requests based on the current size of the request queue. for thetransmission scheduling component, we first describe the general max-weightscheduler and then particularize it to a wireless network where the basestations have multiuser mimo (mu-mimo) beamforming capabilities. we exploit thechannel hardening effect of large-dimensional mimo channels (massive mimo) anddevise a low complexity user selection scheme to solve the underlyingcombinatorial problem of selecting user subsets for downlink beamforming, whichcan be easily implemented and run independently at each base station.

1507.07716	a hierarchical rate splitting strategy for fdd massive mimo under  imperfect csit	in a multiuser mimo broadcast channel, the rate performance is affected bythe multiuser interference when the channel state information at thetransmitter (csit) is imperfect. to tackle the interference problem, arate-splitting (rs) approach has been proposed recently, which splits oneuser's message into a common and a private part, and superimposes the commonmessage on top of the private messages. the common message is drawn from apublic codebook and should be decoded by all users. in this paper, we propose anovel and general framework, denoted as hierarchical rate splitting (hrs), thatis particularly suited to fdd massive mimo systems. hrs simultaneouslytransmits private messages intended to each user and two kinds of commonmessages that can be decoded by all users and by a subset of users,respectively. we analyse the asymptotic sum rate of hrs under imperfect csit. aclosed-form power allocation is derived which provides insights into theeffects of system parameters. finally, simulation results validate thesignificant sum rate gain of hrs over various baselines.

1510.01367	cooperation alignment for distributed interference management	we consider a cooperative gaussian interference channel in which eachreceiver must decode its intended message locally, with the help of cooperationeither at the receivers side or at the transmitter side. in the case ofreceiver cooperation, the receivers can process and share information throughlimited capacity backhaul links. in contrast to various previously considereddistributed antenna architectures, where processing is utterly performed in acentralized fashion, the model considered in this paper aims to capture theessence of decentralized processing, allowing for a more general class of"interactive" interference management strategies. focusing on the three-usercase, we characterize the fundamental tradeoff between the achievablecommunication rates and the corresponding backhaul cooperation rate, in termsof degrees of freedom (dof). surprisingly, we show that the optimumcommunication-cooperation tradeoff per user remains the same when we move fromtwo-user to three-user interference channels. in the absence of cooperation,this is due to interference alignment, which keeps the fraction ofcommunication dimensions wasted for interference unchanged. when backhaulcooperation is available, we develop a new idea that we call cooperationalignment, which guarantees that the average (per user) backhaul load remainsthe same as we increase the number of users. in the case of transmittercooperation, the transmitters can form their jointly precoded signals throughan interactive protocol over the backhaul. in this case, we show that theoptimal (per user) tradeoff between the achievable communication rates and thecorresponding backhaul cooperation rate in the three-user case is the same asfor receiver cooperation.

1511.01634	an active-sensing approach to channel vector subspace estimation in  mm-wave massive mimo systems	millimeter-wave (mm-wave) cellular systems are a promising option for a veryhigh data rate communication because of the large bandwidth available atmm-wave frequencies. due to the large path-loss exponent in the mm-wave rangeof the spectrum, directional beamforming with a large antenna gain is necessaryat the transmitter, the receiver or both for capturing sufficient signal power.this in turn implies that fast and robust channel estimation plays a centralrole in systems performance since without a reliable estimate of the channelstate the received signal-to-noise ratio (snr) would be much lower than theminimum necessary for a reliable communication.  in this paper, we mainly focus on single-antenna users and a multi-antennabase-station. we propose an adaptive sampling scheme to speed up the user'ssignal subspace estimation. in our scheme, the beamforming vector for takingevery new sample is adaptively selected based on all the previous beamformingvectors and the resulting output observations. we apply the theory of optimaldesign of experiments in statistics to design an adaptive algorithm forestimating the signal subspace of each user. the resulting subspace estimatesfor different users can be exploited to efficiently communicate to the usersand to manage the interference. we cast our proposed algorithm aslow-complexity optimization problems, and illustrate its efficiency vianumerical simulations.

1511.02574	wireless multihop device-to-device caching networks	we consider a wireless device-to-device (d2d) network where $n$ nodes areuniformly distributed at random over the network area. we let each node withstorage capacity $m$ cache files from a library of size $m \geq m$. each nodein the network requests a file from the library independently at random,according to a popularity distribution, and is served by other nodes having therequested file in their local cache via (possibly) multihop transmissions.under the classical "protocol model" of wireless networks, we characterize theoptimal per-node capacity scaling law for a broad class of heavy-tailedpopularity distributions including zipf distributions with exponent less thanone. in the parameter regimes of interest, we show that a decentralized randomcaching strategy with uniform probability over the library yields the optimalper-node capacity scaling of $\theta(\sqrt{m/m})$, which is constant with $n$,thus yielding throughput scalability with the network size. furthermore, themultihop capacity scaling can be significantly better than for the case ofsingle-hop caching networks, for which the per-node capacity is $\theta(m/m)$.the multihop capacity scaling law can be further improved for a zipfdistribution with exponent larger than some threshold $&gt; 1$, by using adecentralized random caching uniformly across a subset of most popular files inthe library. namely, ignoring a subset of less popular files (i.e., effectivelyreducing the size of the library) can significantly improve the throughputscaling while guaranteeing that all nodes will be served with high probabilityas $n$ increases.

1511.07539	an efficient multiple-groupcast coded multicasting scheme for finite  fractional caching	coded multicasting has been shown to improve the caching performance ofcontent delivery networks with multiple caches downstream of a common multicastlink. however, the schemes that have been shown to achieve order-optimalperfor- mance require content items to be partitioned into a number of packetsthat grows exponentially with the number of users [1]. in this paper, we firstextend the analysis of the achievable scheme in [2] to the case ofheterogeneous cache sizes and demand distribu- tions, providing an achievablescheme and an upper bound on the limiting average performance when the numberof packets goes to infinity while the remaining system parameters are keptconstant. we then show how the scheme achieving this upper bound can veryquickly loose its multiplicative caching gain for finite content packetization.to overcome this limitation, we design a novel polynomial-time algorithm basedon greedy local graph-coloring that, while keeping the same contentpacketization, recovers a significant part of the multiplicative caching gain.our results show that the achievable schemes proposed to date to quantify thelimiting performance, must be properly designed for practical finite systemparameters.

1511.07542	caching-aided coded multicasting with multiple random requests	the capacity of caching networks has received considerable attention in thepast few years. a particularly studied setting is the shared link cachingnetwork, in which a single source with access to a file library communicateswith multiple users, each having the capability to store segments (packets) ofthe library files, over a shared multicast link. each user requests one filefrom the library according to a common demand distribution and the server sendsa coded multicast message to satisfy all users at once. the problem consists offinding the smallest possible average codeword length to satisfy such requests.in this paper, we consider the generalization to the case where each userplaces l &gt;= 1 independent requests according to the same common demanddistribution. we propose an achievable scheme based on random vector(packetized) caching placement and multiple groupcast index coding, shown to beorder-optimal in the asymptotic regime in which the number of packets per fileb goes to infinity. we then show that the scalar (b = 1) version of theproposed scheme can still preserve order-optimality when the number of per-userrequests l is large enough. our results provide the first order-optimalcharacterization of the shared link caching network with multiple randomrequests, revealing the key effects of l on the performance of caching-aidedcoded multicast schemes.

cs;0506029	a unified framework for tree search decoding : rediscovering the  sequential decoder	we consider receiver design for coded transmission over linear gaussianchannels. we restrict ourselves to the class of lattice codes and formulate thejoint detection and decoding problem as a closest lattice point search (clps).here, a tree search framework for solving the clps is adopted. in ourframework, the clps algorithm decomposes into the preprocessing and tree searchstages. the role of the preprocessing stage is to expose the tree structure ina form {\em matched} to the search stage. we argue that the minimum mean squareerror decision feedback (mmse-dfe) frontend is instrumental for solving thejoint detection and decoding problem in a single search stage. it is furthershown that mmse-dfe filtering allows for using lattice reduction methods toreduce complexity, at the expense of a marginal performance loss, and solvingunder-determined linear systems. for the search stage, we present a genericmethod, based on the branch and bound (bb) algorithm, and show that itencompasses all existing sphere decoders as special cases. the proposed genericalgorithm further allows for an interesting classification of tree searchdecoders, sheds more light on the structural properties of all known spheredecoders, and inspires the design of more efficient decoders. in particular, anefficient decoding algorithm that resembles the well known fano sequentialdecoder is identified. the excellent performance-complexity tradeoff achievedby the proposed mmse-fano decoder is established via simulation results andanalytical arguments in several mimo and isi scenarios.

cs;0702070	a practical approach to lossy joint source-channel coding	this work is devoted to practical joint source channel coding. although theproposed approach has more general scope, for the sake of clarity we focus on aspecific application example, namely, the transmission of digital images overnoisy binary-input output-symmetric channels. the basic building blocks of moststate-of the art source coders are: 1) a linear transformation; 2) scalarquantization of the transform coefficients; 3) probability modeling of thesequence of quantization indices; 4) an entropy coding stage. we identify theweakness of the conventional separated source-channel coding approach in thecatastrophic behavior of the entropy coding stage. hence, we replace this stagewith linear coding, that maps directly the sequence of redundant quantizeroutput symbols into a channel codeword. we show that this approach does notentail any loss of optimality in the asymptotic regime of large block length.however, in the practical regime of finite block length and low decodingcomplexity our approach yields very significant improvements. furthermore, ourscheme allows to retain the transform, quantization and probability modeling ofcurrent state-of the art source coders, that are carefully matched to thefeatures of specific classes of sources. in our working example, we make use of``bit-planes'' and ``contexts'' model defined by the jpeg2000 standard and were-interpret the underlying probability model as a sequence of conditionallymarkov sources. the markov structure allows to derive a simple successivecoding and decoding scheme, where the latter is based on iterative beliefpropagation. we provide a construction example of the proposed scheme based onpunctured turbo codes and we demonstrate the gain over a conventional separatedscheme by running extensive numerical experiments on test images.
