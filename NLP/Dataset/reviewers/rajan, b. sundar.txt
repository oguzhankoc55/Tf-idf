0901.0168	coding for two-user siso and mimo multiple access channels	constellation constrained (cc) capacity regions of a two-user siso gaussianmultiple access channel (gmac) with finite complex input alphabets andcontinuous output are computed in this paper. when both the users employ thesame code alphabet, it is well known that an appropriate rotation between thealphabets provides unique decodability to the receiver. for such a set-up, ametric is proposed to compute the angle(s) of rotation between the alphabetssuch that the cc capacity region is maximally enlarged. subsequently, codepairs based on trellis coded modulation (tcm) are designed for the two-usergmac with $m$-psk and $m$-pam alphabet pairs for arbitrary values of $m$ and itis proved that, for certain angles of rotation, ungerboeck labelling on thetrellis of each user maximizes the guaranteed squared euclidean distance of the\textit{sum trellis}. hence, such a labelling scheme can be used systematicallyto construct trellis code pairs for a two-user gmac to achieve sum rates closeto the sum capacity of the channel. more importantly, it is shown for the firsttime that ml decoding complexity at the destination is significantly reducedwhen $m$-pam alphabet pairs are employed with \textit{almost} no loss in thesum capacity. \indent a two-user multiple input multiple output (mimo) fadingmac with $n_{t}$ antennas at both the users and a single antenna at thedestination has also been considered with the assumption that the destinationhas the perfect knowledge of channel state information and the two users havethe perfect knowledge of only the phase components of their channels. for sucha set-up, two distinct classes of space time block code (stbc) pairs derivedfrom the well known class of real orthogonal designs are proposed such that thestbc pairs are information lossless and have low ml decoding complexity.

0901.1864	low-complexity near-ml decoding of large non-orthogonal stbcs using  reactive tabu search	non-orthogonal space-time block codes (stbc) with {\em large dimensions} areattractive because they can simultaneously achieve both high spectralefficiencies (same spectral efficiency as in v-blast for a given number oftransmit antennas) {\em as well as} full transmit diversity. decoding ofnon-orthogonal stbcs with large dimensions has been a challenge. in this paper,we present a reactive tabu search (rts) based algorithm for decodingnon-orthogonal stbcs from cyclic division algebras (cda) having largedimensions. under i.i.d fading and perfect channel state information at thereceiver (csir), our simulation results show that rts based decoding of$12\times 12$ stbc from cda and 4-qam with 288 real dimensions achieves $i)$$10^{-3}$ uncoded ber at an snr of just 0.5 db away from siso awgn performance,and $ii)$ a coded ber performance close to within about 5 db of the theoreticalmimo capacity, using rate-3/4 turbo code at a spectral efficiency of 18 bps/hz.rts is shown to achieve near siso awgn performance with less number ofdimensions than with las algorithm (which we reported recently) at some extracomplexity than las. we also report good ber performance of rts when i.i.dfading and perfect csir assumptions are relaxed by considering a spatiallycorrelated mimo channel model, and by using a training based iterative rtsdecoding/channel estimation scheme.

0909.1638	single-generation network coding for networks with delay	a single-source network is said to be \textit{memory-free} if all of theinternal nodes (those except the source and the sinks) do not employ memory butmerely send linear combinations of the incoming symbols (received at theirincoming edges) on their outgoing edges. memory-free networks with delay usingnetwork coding are forced to do inter-generation network coding, as a result ofwhich the problem of some or all sinks requiring a large amount of memory fordecoding is faced. in this work, we address this problem by utilizing memoryelements at the internal nodes of the network also, which results in thereduction of the number of memory elements used at the sinks. we give analgorithm which employs memory at the nodes to achieve single-generationnetwork coding. for fixed latency, our algorithm reduces the total number ofmemory elements used in the network to achieve single-generation networkcoding. we also discuss the advantages of employing single-generation networkcoding together with convolutional network-error correction codes (cneccs) fornetworks with unit-delay and illustrate the performance gain of cneccs by usingmemory at the intermediate nodes using simulations on an example network undera probabilistic network error model.

1001.0357	orthogonal vs non-orthogonal multiple access with finite input alphabet  and finite bandwidth	for a two-user gaussian multiple access channel (gmac), frequency divisionmultiple access (fdma), a well known orthogonal-multiple-access (o-ma) schemehas been preferred to non-orthogonal-multiple-access (no-ma) schemes since fdmacan achieve the sum-capacity of the channel with only single-user decodingcomplexity [\emph{chapter 14, elements of information theory by cover andthomas}]. however, with finite alphabets, in this paper, we show that no-ma isbetter than o-ma for a two-user gmac. we plot the constellation constrained(cc) capacity regions of a two-user gmac with fdma and time division multipleaccess (tdma) and compare them with the cc capacity regions with trellis codedmultiple access (tcma), a recently introduced no-ma scheme. unlike the gaussianalphabets case, it is shown that the cc capacity region with fdma is strictlycontained inside the cc capacity region with tcma. in particular, for a givenbandwidth, the gap between the cc capacity regions with tcma and fdma is shownto increase with the increase in the average power constraint. also, for agiven power constraint, the gap between the cc capacity regions with tcma andfdma is shown to decrease with the increase in the bandwidth. hence, for finitealphabets, a no-ma scheme such as tcma is better than the well known o-macschemes, fdma and tdma which makes no-ma schemes worth pursuing in practice fora two-user gmac.

1001.1026	on network-error correcting convolutional codes under the bsc edge error  model	convolutional network-error correcting codes (cneccs) are known to provideerror correcting capability in acyclic instantaneous networks within thenetwork coding paradigm under small field size conditions. in this work, weinvestigate the performance of cneccs under the error model of the networkwhere the edges are assumed to be statistically independent binary symmetricchannels, each with the same probability of error $p_e$($0\leq p_e&lt;0.5$). weobtain bounds on the performance of such cneccs based on a modified generatingfunction (the transfer function) of the cneccs. for a given network, we derivea mathematical condition on how small $p_e$ should be so that only single edgenetwork-errors need to be accounted for, thus reducing the complexity ofevaluating the probability of error of any cnecc. simulations indicate thatconvolutional codes are required to possess different properties to achievegood performance in low $p_e$ and high $p_e$ regimes. for the low $p_e$ regime,convolutional codes with good distance properties show good performance. forthe high $p_e$ regime, convolutional codes that have a good \textit{slope} (theminimum normalized cycle weight) are seen to be good. we derive a lower boundon the slope of any rate $b/c$ convolutional code with a certain degree.

1001.2376	a hybrid rts-bp algorithm for improved detection of large-mimo m-qam  signals	low-complexity near-optimal detection of large-mimo signals has attractedrecent research. recently, we proposed a local neighborhood search algorithm,namely `reactive tabu search' (rts) algorithm, as well as a factor-graph based`belief propagation' (bp) algorithm for low-complexity large-mimo detection.the motivation for the present work arises from the following two observationson the above two algorithms: $i)$ rts works for general m-qam. although rts wasshown to achieve close to optimal performance for 4-qam in large dimensions,significant performance improvement was still possible for higher-order qam(e.g., 16- and 64-qam). ii) bp also was shown to achieve near-optimalperformance for large dimensions, but only for $\{\pm 1\}$ alphabet. in thispaper, we improve the large-mimo detection performance of higher-order qamsignals by using a hybrid algorithm that employs rts and bp. in particular,motivated by the observation that when a detection error occurs at the rtsoutput, the least significant bits (lsb) of the symbols are mostly in error, wepropose to first reconstruct and cancel the interference due to bits other thanlsbs at the rts output and feed the interference cancelled received signal tothe bp algorithm to improve the reliability of the lsbs. the output of the bpis then fed back to rts for the next iteration. our simulation results showthat in a 32 x 32 v-blast system, the proposed rts-bp algorithm performs betterthan rts by about 3.5 db at $10^{-3}$ uncoded ber and by about 2.5 db at$3\times 10^{-4}$ rate-3/4 turbo coded ber with 64-qam at the same order ofcomplexity as rts. we also illustrate the performance of large-mimo detectionin frequency-selective fading channels.

(ii) we construct a new class offast-group-decodable codes for all even number of transmit antennas and rates$1 &lt; r \leq 5/4$.(iii) given a design with full-rank linear dispersionmatrices, we show that a full-diversity stbc can be constructed from thisdesign by encoding the real symbols independently using only regular pamconstellations.

1004.2844	minimizing the complexity of fast sphere decoding of stbcs	decoding of linear space-time block codes (stbcs) with sphere-decoding (sd)is well known. a fast-version of the sd known as fast sphere decoding (fsd) hasbeen recently studied by biglieri, hong and viterbo. viewing a linear stbc as avector space spanned by its defining weight matrices over the real numberfield, we define a quadratic form (qf), called the hurwitz-radon qf (hrqf), onthis vector space and give a qf interpretation of the fsd complexity of alinear stbc. it is shown that the fsd complexity is only a function of theweight matrices defining the code and their ordering, and not of the channelrealization (even though the equivalent channel when sd is used depends on thechannel realization) or the number of receive antennas. it is also shown thatthe fsd complexity is completely captured into a single matrix obtained fromthe hrqf. moreover, for a given set of weight matrices, an algorithm to obtaina best ordering of them leading to the least fsd complexity is presented. thewell known classes of low fsd complexity codes (multi-group decodable codes,fast decodable codes and fast group decodable codes) are presented in theframework of hrqf.

1102.1782	on network coding for acyclic networks with delays	problems related to network coding for acyclic, instantaneous networks (wherethe edges of the acyclic graph representing the network are assumed to havezero-delay) have been extensively dealt with in the recent past. the mostprominent of these problems include (a) the existence of network codes thatachieve maximum rate of transmission, (b) efficient network code constructions,and (c) field size issues. in practice, however, networks have transmissiondelays. in network coding theory, such networks with transmission delays aregenerally abstracted by assuming that their edges have integer delays. notethat using enough memory at the nodes of an acyclic network with integer delayscan effectively simulate instantaneous behavior, which is probably why onlyacyclic instantaneous networks have been primarily focused on thus far. in thiswork, we elaborate on issues ((a), (b) and (c) above) related to network codingfor acyclic networks with integer delays, which have till now mostly beenoverlooked. we show that the delays associated with the edges of the networkcannot be ignored, and in fact turn out to be advantageous, disadvantageous orimmaterial, depending on the topology of the network and the problem consideredi.e., (a), (b) or (c). in the process, we also show that for a single sourcemulticast problem in acyclic networks (instantaneous and with delays), thenetwork coding operations at each node can simply be limited to storing oldsymbols and coding them over a binary field. therefore, operations overelements of larger fields are unnecessary in the network, the trade-off beingthat enough memory exists at the nodes and at the sinks, and that the sinkshave more processing power.

1103.3882	a transform approach to linear network coding for acyclic networks with  delay	the algebraic formulation for linear network coding in acyclic networks withthe links having integer delay is well known. based on this formulation, for agiven set of connections over an arbitrary acyclic network with integer delayassumed for the links, the output symbols at the sink nodes, at any given timeinstant, is a \mathbb{f}_{q}$-linear combination of the input symbols acrossdifferent generations, where $\mathbb{f}_{q}$ denotes the field over which thenetwork operates. we use finite-field discrete fourier transform (dft) toconvert the output symbols at the sink nodes, at any given time instant, into a$\mathbb{f}_{q}$-linear combination of the input symbols generated during thesame generation. we call this as transforming the acyclic network with delayinto {\em $n$-instantaneous networks} ($n$ is sufficiently large). we show thatunder certain conditions, there exists a network code satisfying sink demandsin the usual (non-transform) approach if and only if there exists a networkcode satisfying sink demands in the transform approach. furthermore, we showthat the transform method (along with the use of alignment strategies) can beemployed to achieve half the rate corresponding to the individualsource-destination min-cut (which are assumed to be equal to 1) for someclasses of three-source three-destination unicast network with delays, when thezero-interference conditions are not satisfied.

1104.0640	on the sphere decoding complexity of stbcs for asymmetric mimo systems	in the landmark paper by hassibi and hochwald, it is claimed without proofthat the upper triangular matrix r encountered during the sphere decoding ofany linear dispersion code is full-ranked whenever the rate of the code is lessthan the minimum of the number of transmit and receive antennas. in this paper,we show that this claim is true only when the number of receive antennas is atleast as much as the number of transmit antennas. we also show that all knownfamilies of high rate (rate greater than 1 complex symbol per channel use)multigroup ml decodable codes have rank-deficient r matrix even when thecriterion on rate is satisfied, and that this rank-deficiency problem arisesonly in asymmetric mimo with number of receive antennas less than the number oftransmit antennas. unlike the codes with full-rank r matrix, the average spheredecoding complexity of the stbcs whose r matrix is rank-deficient is polynomialin the constellation size. we derive the sphere decoding complexity of most ofthe known high rate multigroup ml decodable codes, and show that for each code,the complexity is a decreasing function of the number of receive antennas.

1104.0735	a non-orthogonal df scheme for the single relay channel and the effect  of labelling	we consider the uncoded transmission over the half-duplex single relaychannel, with a single antenna at the source, relay and destination nodes, in arayleigh fading environment. the phase during which the relay is in receptionmode is referred to as phase 1 and the phase during which the relay is intransmission mode is referred to as phase 2. the following two cases areconsidered: the non-orthogonal decode and forward (nodf) scheme, in which boththe source and the relay transmit during phase 2 and the orthogonal decode andforward (odf) scheme, in which the relay alone transmits during phase 2. a nearml decoder which gives full diversity (diversity order 2) for the nodf schemeis proposed. due to the proximity of the relay to the destination, thesource-destination link, in general, is expected to be much weaker than therelay-destination link. hence it is not clear whether the transmission made bythe source during phase 2 in the nodf scheme, provides any performanceimprovement over the odf scheme or not. in this regard, it is shown that thenodf scheme provides significant performance improvement over the odf scheme.in fact, at high snr, the performance of the nodf scheme with the non-idealsource-relay link, is same as that of the nodf scheme with an idealsource-relay link. in other words, to study the high snr performance of thenodf scheme, one can assume that the source-relay link is ideal, whereas thesame is not true for the odf scheme. further, it is shown that proper choice ofthe mapping of the bits on to the signal points at the source and the relay,provides a significant improvement in performance, for both the nodf and theodf schemes.

1108.2861	generalized distributive law for ml decoding of space-time block codes	the problem of designing good space-time block codes (stbcs) with lowmaximum-likelihood (ml) decoding complexity has gathered much attention in theliterature. all the known low ml decoding complexity techniques utilize thesame approach of exploiting either the multigroup decodable or thefast-decodable (conditionally multigroup decodable) structure of a code. werefer to this well known technique of decoding stbcs as conditional ml (cml)decoding. in this paper we introduce a new framework to construct ml decodersfor stbcs based on the generalized distributive law (gdl) and the factor-graphbased sum-product algorithm. we say that an stbc is fast gdl decodable if theorder of gdl decoding complexity of the code is strictly less than m^l, where lis the number of independent symbols in the stbc, and m is the constellationsize. we give sufficient conditions for an stbc to admit fast gdl decoding, andshow that both multigroup and conditionally multigroup decodable codes are fastgdl decodable. for any stbc, whether fast gdl decodable or not, we show thatthe gdl decoding complexity is strictly less than the cml decoding complexity.for instance, for any stbc obtained from cyclic division algebras which is notmultigroup or conditionally multigroup decodable, the gdl decoder providesabout 12 times reduction in complexity compared to the cml decoder. similarly,for the golden code, which is conditionally multigroup decodable, the gdldecoder is only half as complex as the cml decoder.

1210.0490	physical layer network coding for the multiple access relay channel	we consider the two user wireless multiple access relay channel (marc), inwhich nodes $a$ and $b$ want to transmit messages to a destination node $d$with the help of a relay node $r$. for the marc, wang and giannakis proposed acomplex field network coding (cfnc) scheme. as an alternative, we propose ascheme based on physical layer network coding (pnc), which has so far beenstudied widely only in the context of two-way relaying. for the proposed pncscheme, transmission takes place in two phases: (i) phase 1 during which $a$and $b$ simultaneously transmit and, $r$ and $d$ receive, (ii) phase 2 duringwhich $a$, $b$ and $r$ simultaneously transmit to $d$. at the end of phase 1,$r$ decodes the messages $x_a$ of $a$ and $x_b$ of $b,$ and during phase 2transmits $f(x_a,x_b),$ where $f$ is many-to-one. communication protocols inwhich the relay node decodes are prone to loss of diversity order, due to errorpropagation from the relay node. to counter this, we propose a novel decoderwhich takes into account the possibility of an error event at $r$, withouthaving any knowledge about the links from $a$ to $r$ and $b$ to $r$. it isshown that if certain parameters are chosen properly and if the map $f$satisfies a condition called exclusive law, the proposed decoder offers themaximum diversity order of two. also, it is shown that for a proper choice ofthe parameters, the proposed decoder admits fast decoding, with the samedecoding complexity order as that of the cfnc scheme. simulation resultsindicate that the proposed pnc scheme performs better than the cfnc scheme.

1212.3903	full-rate, full-diversity, finite feedback space-time schemes with  minimum feedback and transmission duration	in this paper a mimo quasi static block fading channel with finite n-arydelay-free, noise-free feedback is considered. the transmitter uses a set of nspace-time block codes (stbcs), one corresponding to each of the n possiblefeedback values, to encode and transmit information. the feedback function usedat the receiver and the n component stbcs used at the transmitter togetherconstitute a finite feedback scheme (ffs). although a number of ffss areavailable in the literature that provably achieve full-diversity, there is noknown universal criterion to determine whether a given arbitrary ffs achievesfull-diversity or not. further, all known full-diversity ffss for t&lt;n_t wheren_t is the number of transmit antennas, have rate at the most 1. in this papera universal necessary condition for any ffs to achieve full-diversity is given,using which the notion of feedback-transmission duration optimal (ft-optimal)ffss - schemes that use minimum amount of feedback n given the transmissionduration t, and minimum transmission duration given the amount of feedback toachieve full-diversity - is introduced. when there is no feedback (n=1) anft-optimal scheme consists of a single stbc with t=n_t, and the universalnecessary condition reduces to the well known necessary and sufficientcondition for an stbc to achieve full-diversity: every non-zero codeworddifference matrix of the stbc must be of rank n_t. also, a sufficient conditionfor full-diversity is given for the ffss in which the component stbc with thelargest minimum euclidean distance is chosen. using this sufficient conditionfull-rate (rate n_t) full-diversity ft-optimal schemes are constructed for all(n_t,t,n) with nt=n_t. these are the first full-rate full-diversity ffssreported in the literature for t&lt;n_t. simulation results show that the newschemes have the best error performance among all known ffss.

1301.4646	physical layer network coding for two-way relaying with qam	the design of modulation schemes for the physical layer network-coded two wayrelaying scenario was studied in [1], [3], [4] and [5]. in [7] it was shownthat every network coding map that satisfies the exclusive law is representableby a latin square and conversely, and this relationship can be used to get thenetwork coding maps satisfying the exclusive law. but, only the scenario inwhich the end nodes use $m$-psk signal sets is addressed in [7] and [8]. inthis paper, we address the case in which the end nodes use $m$-qam signal sets.in a fading scenario, for certain channel conditions $\gamma e^{j \theta}$,termed singular fade states, the ma phase performance is greatly reduced. byformulating a procedure for finding the exact number of singular fade statesfor qam, we show that square qam signal sets give lesser number of singularfade states compared to psk signal sets. this results in superior performanceof $m$-qam over $m$-psk. it is shown that the criterion for partitioning thecomplex plane, for the purpose of using a particular network code for aparticular fade state, is different from that used for $m$-psk. using amodified criterion, we describe a procedure to analytically partition thecomplex plane representing the channel condition. we show that when $m$-qam ($m&gt;4$) signal set is used, the conventional xor network mapping fails to removethe ill effects of $\gamma e^{j \theta}=1$, which is a singular fade state forall signal sets of arbitrary size. we show that a doubly block circulant latinsquare removes this singular fade state for $m$-qam.

1510.02956	on the number of optimal linear index codes for unicast index coding  problems	an index coding problem arises when there is a single source with a number ofmessages and multiple receivers each wanting a subset of messages and knowing adifferent set of messages a priori. the noiseless index coding problem is toidentify the minimum number of transmissions (optimal length) to be made by thesource through noiseless channels so that all receivers can decode their wantedmessages using the transmitted symbols and their respective prior information.recently, it is shown that different optimal length codes perform differentlyin a noisy channel. towards identifying the best optimal length index code oneneeds to know the number of optimal length index codes. in this paper wepresent results on the number of optimal length index codes making use of therepresentation of an index coding problem by an equivalent network code. ourformulation results in matrices of smaller sizes compared to the approach ofkotter and medard. our formulation leads to a lower bound on the minimum numberof optimal length codes possible for all unicast index coding problems which ismet with equality for several special cases of the unicast index codingproblem. a method to identify the optimal length codes which lead tominimum-maximum probability of error is also presented.

1510.04820	error-correcting functional index codes, generalized exclusive laws and  graph coloring	we consider the \emph{functional index coding problem} over an error-freebroadcast network in which a source generates a set of messages and there aremultiple receivers, each holding a set of functions of source messages in itscache, called the \emph{has-set}, and demands to know another set of functionsof messages, called the \emph{want-set}. cognizant of the receivers'\emph{has-sets}, the source aims to satisfy the demands of each receiver bymaking coded transmissions, called a \emph{functional index code}. theobjective is to minimize the number of such transmissions required. therestriction a receiver's demands pose on the code is represented via aconstraint called the \emph{generalized exclusive law} and obtain a code usingthe \emph{confusion graph} constructed using these constraints. bounds on thesize of an optimal code based on the parameters of the confusion graph arepresented. next, we consider the case of erroneous transmissions and provide anecessary and sufficient condition that an fic must satisfy for correctdecoding of desired functions at each receiver and obtain a lower bound on thelength of an error-correcting fic.

1511.00542	optimal vector linear index codes for some symmetric side information  problems	this paper deals with vector linear index codes for multiple unicast indexcoding problems where there is a source with k messages and there are kreceivers each wanting a unique message and having symmetric (with respect tothe receiver index) two-sided antidotes (side information). optimal scalarlinear index codes for several such instances of this class of problems forone-sided antidotes(not necessarily adjacent) have already been reported. thesecodes can be viewed as special cases of the symmetric unicast index codingproblems discussed by maleki, cadambe and jafar with one sided adjacentantidotes. in this paper, starting from a given multiple unicast index codingproblem with with k messages and one-sided adjacent antidotes for which ascalar linear index code $\mathfrak{c}$ is known, we give a constructionprocedure which constructs a sequence (indexed by m) of multiple unicast indexproblems with two-sided adjacent antidotes (for the same source) for all ofwhich a vector linear code $\mathfrak{c}^{(m)}$ is obtained from$\mathfrak{c}.$ also, it is shown that if $\mathfrak{c}$ is optimal then$\mathfrak{c}^{(m)}$ is also optimal for all $m.$ we illustrate ourconstruction for some of the known optimal scalar linear codes.

0806.1577	co-ordinate interleaved distributed space-time coding for  two-antenna-relays networks	distributed space time coding for wireless relay networks when the source,the destination and the relays have multiple antennas have been studied by jingand hassibi. in this set-up, the transmit and the receive signals at differentantennas of the same relay are processed and designed independently, eventhough the antennas are colocated. in this paper, a wireless relay network withsingle antenna at the source and the destination and two antennas at each ofthe r relays is considered. a new class of distributed space time block codescalled co-ordinate interleaved distributed space-time codes (cidstc) areintroduced where, in the first phase, the source transmits a t-length complexvector to all the relays and in the second phase, at each relay, the in-phaseand quadrature component vectors of the received complex vectors at the twoantennas are interleaved and processed before forwarding them to thedestination. compared to the scheme proposed by jing-hassibi, for $t \geq 4r$,while providing the same asymptotic diversity order of 2r, cidstc scheme isshown to provide asymptotic coding gain with the cost of negligible increase inthe processing complexity at the relays. however, for moderate and large valuesof p, cidstc scheme is shown to provide more diversity than that of the schemeproposed by jing-hassibi. cidstcs are shown to be fully diverse provided theinformation symbols take value from an appropriate multi-dimensional signalset.

0806.3227	a non-differential distributed space-time coding for partially-coherent  cooperative communication	in a distributed space-time coding scheme, based on the relay channel model,the relay nodes co-operate to linearly process the transmitted signal from thesource and forward them to the destination such that the signal at thedestination appears as a space time block code. recently, a code designcriteria for achieving full diversity in a partially-coherent environment havebeen proposed along with codes based on differential encoding and decodingtechniques. for such a set up, in this paper, a non-differential encodingtechnique and construction of distributed space time block codes from unitarymatrix groups at the source and a set of diagonal unitary matrices for therelays are proposed. it is shown that, the performance of our scheme isindependent of the choice of unitary matrices at the relays. when the group iscyclic, a necessary and sufficient condition on the generator of the cyclicgroup to achieve full diversity and to minimize the pairwise error probabilityis proved. various choices on the generator of cyclic group to reduce the mldecoding complexity at the destination is presented. it is also shown that, atthe source, if non-cyclic abelian unitary matrix groups are used, thenfull-diversity can not be obtained. the presented scheme is also robust tofailure of any subset of relay nodes.

0807.4074	low-delay, low-papr, high-rate non-square complex orthogonal designs	the maximal rate for non-square complex orthogonal designs (cods) with $n$transmit antennas is ${1/2}+\frac{1}{n}$ if $n$ is even and${1/2}+\frac{1}{n+1}$ if $n$ is odd, which are close to 1/2 for large values of$n.$ a class of maximal rate non-square cods have been constructed by liang(ieee trans. inform. theory, 2003) and lu et. al. (ieee trans. inform. theory,2005) have shown that the decoding delay of the codes given by liang, can bereduced by 50% when number of transmit antennas is a multiple of 4. adams et.al. (ieee trans. inform. theory, 2007) have shown that the designs of liang areof minimal-delay for $n$ equal to 1 and 3 modulo 4 and that of lu et.al. are ofminimal delay when $n$ is a multiple of $4.$ however, these minimal delays arelarge compared to the delays of the rate 1/2 non-square cods constructed bytarokh et al (ieee trans. inform. theory, 1999) from rate-1 real orthogonaldesigns (rods). in this paper, we construct a class of rate-1/2 non-square codsfor any $n$ with the decoding delay equal to 50% of that of the delay of therate-1/2 codes given by tarokh et al. this is achieved by giving first ageneral construction of rate-1 square real orthogonal designs (rods) whichincludes as special cases the well known constructions of adams, lax andphillips and geramita and pullman, and then making use of it to obtain thedesired rate-1/2 non-square cod. for the case of 9 transmit antennas, ourrate-1/2 cod is shown to be of minimal-delay. the proposed construction resultsin designs with zero entries which may have high peak-to-average power ratio(papr) and it is shown that by appropriate postmultiplication, a design with nozero entries can be obtained with no change in the code parameters.

0807.4128	square complex orthogonal designs with low papr and signaling complexity	space-time block codes from square complex orthogonal designs (scod) havebeen extensively studied and most of the existing scods contain large number ofzero. the zeros in the designs result in high peak-to-average power ratio(papr) and also impose a severe constraint on hardware implementation of thecode when turning off some of the transmitting antennas whenever a zero istransmitted. recently, rate 1/2 scods with no zero entry have been reported for8 transmit antennas. in this paper, scods with no zero entry for $2^a$ transmitantennas whenever $a+1$ is a power of 2, are constructed which includes the 8transmit antennas case as a special case. more generally, for arbitrary valuesof $a$, explicit construction of $2^a\times 2^a$ rate $\frac{a+1}{2^a}$ scodswith the ratio of number of zero entries to the total number of entries equalto $1-\frac{a+1}{2^a}2^{\lfloor log_2(\frac{2^a}{a+1}) \rfloor}$ is reported,whereas for standard known constructions, the ratio is $1-\frac{a+1}{2^a}$. thecodes presented do not result in increased signaling complexity. simulationresults show that the codes constructed in this paper outperform the codesusing the standard construction under peak power constraint while performingthe same under average power constraint.

0808.1400	a class of maximal-rate, low-papr, non-square complex orthogonal designs	space-time block codes (stbcs) from non-square complex orthogonal designs arebandwidth efficient when compared with those from square real/complexorthogonal designs. though there exists rate-1 rod for any number of transmitantennas, rate-1 complex orthogonal designs (cod) does not exist for more than2 transmit antennas. liang (ieee trans. inform. theory, 2003) and lu et al(ieee trans. inform. theory, 2005) have constructed a class of maximal ratenon-square cods where the rate is ${1/2}+\frac{1}{n}$ if number of transmitantennas $n$ is even and ${1/2}+\frac{1}{n+1}$ if $n$ is odd. in this paper, wepresent a simple construction for maximal rate non-square cods obtained fromsquare cods which resembles the construction of rate-1 non-square rods fromsquare rods. these designs are shown to be amenable for construction of a classof generalized cods (called coordinate-interleaved scaled cods) with lowpeak-to-average power ratio (papr) having the same parameters as the maximalrate codes. simulation results indicate that these codes perform better thanthe existing maximal rate codes under peak power constraint while performingthe same under average power constraint.

cs;0702023	high-rate, multi-symbol-decodable stbcs from clifford algebras	it is well known that space-time block codes (stbcs) obtained from orthogonaldesigns (ods) are single-symbol-decodable (ssd) and from quasi-orthogonaldesigns (qods) are double-symbol decodable. however, there are ssd codes thatare not obtainable from ods and dsd codes that are not obtainable from qods. inthis paper a method of constructing $g$-symbol decodable ($g$-sd) stbcs usingrepresentations of clifford algebras are presented which when specialized to$g=1,2$ gives ssd and dsd codes respectively. for the number of transmitantennas $2^a$ the rate (in complex symbols per channel use) of the $g$-sdcodes presented in this paper is $\frac{a+1-g}{2^{a-g}}$. the maximum rate ofthe dsd stbcs from qods reported in the literature is $\frac{a}{2^{a-1}}$ whichis smaller than the rate $\frac{a-1}{2^{a-2}}$ of the dsd codes of this paper,for $2^a$ transmit antennas. in particular, the reported dsd codes for 8 and 16transmit antennas offer rates 1 and 3/4 respectively whereas the known stbcsfrom qods offer only 3/4 and 1/2 respectively. the construction of this paperis applicable for any number of transmit antennas.
