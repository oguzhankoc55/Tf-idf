0902.4472	neutral oxygen spectral line formation revisited with new collisional  data: large departures from lte at low metallicity	we present a detailed study of the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium(non-lte) formation of the high-excitation neutral oxygen 777 nm triplet inmarcs model atmospheres representative of late-type stars with spectral types fto k. we carried out the calculations using the statistical equilibrium codemulti, including estimates of the impact on elemental abundance analysis. theatomic model employed includes, in particular, recent quantum-mechanicalelectron collision data. we confirm that the o i triplet lines form undernon-lte conditions in late-type stars, suffering negative abundance correctionswith respect to lte. at low metallicity, large line opacity stems fromtriplet-quintet intersystem electron collisions, a form of coupling previouslynot considered or seriously underestimated. the non-lte effects becomegenerally severe for models (both giants and dwarfs) with higher t_eff.interestingly, in metal-poor turn-off stars, the negative non-lte abundancecorrections tend to rapidly become more severe towards lower metallicity. whenneglecting h collisions, they amount to as much as ~ 0.9 dex and ~ 1.2 dex,respectively at [fe/h]=-3 and [fe/h]=-3.5. even when such collisions areincluded, the lte abundance remains a serious overestimate, correspondingly by~ 0.5 dex and ~ 0.9 dex at such low metallicities. although the poorly knowninelastic hydrogen collisions thus remain an important uncertainty, the largemetallicity-dependent non-lte effects seem to point to a resulting "low"(compared to lte) [o/fe] in metal-poor halo stars.

0905.3101	granulation in k-type dwarf stars. ii. hydrodynamic simulations and 3d  spectrum synthesis	we construct a 3d radiative-hydrodynamic model atmosphere of parameters teff= 4820 k, log g = 4.5, and solar chemical composition. the theoretical lineprofiles computed with this model are asymmetric, with their bisectors having acharacteristic c-shape and their core wavelengths shifted with respect to theirlaboratory values. the line bisectors span from about 10 to 250 m/s, dependingon line strength, with the stronger features showing larger span. thecorresponding core wavelength shifts range from about -200 m/s for the weak fei lines to almost +100 m/s in the strong fe i features. based on observationalresults for the sun, we argue that there should be no core wavelength shift forfe i lines of ew &gt; 100 ma. the cores of the strongest lines show contributionsfrom the uncertain top layers of the model, where non-lte effects and thepresence of the chromosphere, which are important in real stars, are notaccounted for. the comparison of model predictions to observed fe i linebisectors and core wavelength shifts for a reference star, hip86400, showsexcellent agreement, with the exception of the core wavelength shifts of thestrongest features, for which we suspect inaccurate theoretical values. sincethis limitation does not affect the predicted line equivalent widthssignificantly, we consider our 3d model validated for photospheric abundancework.

0906.0982	subaru high-resolution spectroscopy of star g in the tycho supernova  remnant	it is widely believed that type ia supernovae (sn ia) originate in binarysystems where a white dwarf accretes material from a companion star until itsmass approaches the chandrasekhar mass and carbon is ignited in the whitedwarf's core. this scenario predicts that the donor star should survive thesupernova explosion, providing an opportunity to understand the progenitors oftype ia supernovae.in this paper we argue that rotation is a generic signatureexpected of most non-giant donor stars that is easily measurable.\citep{2004natur.431.1069r} examined stars in the center of the remnant of sn1572 (tycho's sn) and showed evidence that a subgiant star (star g by theirnaming convention) near the remnant's centre was the system's donor star. wepresent high-resolution (r \simeq 40000) spectra taken with the high dispersionspectrograph on subaru of this candidate donor star and measure the star'sradial velocity as $79\pm 2$ \kms with respect to the lsr and put an upperlimit on the star's rotation of 7.5 \kms. in addition, by comparing images thatwere taken in 1970 and 2004, we measure the proper motion of star g to be$\mu_l = -1.6 \pm 2.1$ \masyr and $\mu_b = -2.7 \pm 1.6$ \masyr. we demonstratethat all of the measured properties of star g presented in this paper areconsistent with those of a star in the direction of tycho's sn that is notassociated with the supernova event. however, we discuss an unlikely, but stillviable scenario for star g to be the donor star, and suggest furtherobservations that might be able to confirm or refute it.

0906.2876	signatures of intrinsic li depletion and li-na anti-correlation in the  metal-poor globular cluster ngc6397	to alleviate the discrepancy between the prediction of the primordial lithiumabundance in the universe and the abundances observed in pop ii dwarfs andsubgiant stars, it has been suggested that the stars observable today haveundergone photospheric depletion of li. to constrain the nature of suchdepletion, we conduct a homogeneous analysis of a very large sample of stars inthe metal-poor globular cluster ngc6397, covering well all evolutionary phasesfrom below the main sequence turn-off to high up the red giant branch. non-lteli abundances or abundance upper limits are obtained for all stars, and for asize-able sub-set of the targets also na abundances are obtained. the sodiumabundances are used to distinguish stars formed out of pristine material fromstars formed out of material affected by pollution from a previous generationof more massive stars. the dwarfs, turn-off, and early subgiant stars form athin abundance plateau, disrupted in the middle of the subgiant branch by thelithium dilution caused by the first dredge-up. a second steep abundance dropis seen at the red giant branch bump. the turn-off stars are more lithium-poor,by up to 0.1 dex, than subgiants that have not yet undergone dredge-up. inaddition, hotter dwarfs are slightly more lithium-poor than cooler dwarfs,which may be a signature of the so-called li dip in the cluster, commonly seenamong popi stars. a considerably large spread in na abundance confirms thatngc6397 has suffered from intra-cluster pollution in its infancy and a limitednumber of na-enhanced and li-deficient stars strongly contribute to form asignificant anti-correlation between the abundances of na and li. the inferredli abundances are compared to predictions from stellar structure modelsincluding atomic diffusion and ad-hoc turbulence below the convection zone.

0910.0448	chemical abundances for 11 bulge stars from high-resolution, near-ir  spectra	it is debated whether the milky way bulge has the characteristics of aclassical bulge sooner than those of a pseudobulge. detailed abundance studiesof bulge stars is a key to investigate the origin, history, and classificationof the bulge. the aim is to add to the discussion on the origin of the bulgeand to study detailed abundances determined from near-ir spectra for bulgegiants already investigated with optical spectra, the latter also providing thestellar parameters which are very significant for the results of the presentstudy. especially, the important cno elements are better determined in thenear-ir. high-resolution, near-infrared spectra in the h band are recordedusing the crires spectrometer on the very large telescope. the cno abundancescan all be determined from the numerous molecular lines in the wavelength rangeobserved. abundances of the alpha elements are also determined from the near-irspectra. [o/fe], [si/fe] and [s/fe] are enhanced up to metallicities of atleast [fe/h]=-0.3, after which they decline. this suggests that the milky waybulge experienced a rapid and early star-formation history like that of aclassical bulge. however, a similarity between the bulge trend and the trend ofthe local thick disk seems present. such a similarity could suggest that thebulge has a pseudobulge origin. our [c/fe] trend does not show any increasewith [fe/h] which could have been expected if w-r stars have contributedsubstantially to the c abundances. no "cosmic scatter" can be traced around ourobserved abundance trends; the scatter found is expected, given theobservational uncertainties.

0911.1893	does the anomalous solar chemical composition come from planet  formation?	we derive the abundance of 19 elements in a sample of 64 stars withfundamental parameters very similar to solar, which minimizes the impact ofsystematic errors in our spectroscopic 1d-lte differential analysis, usinghigh-resolution (r=60,000), high signal-to-noise ratio (s/n=200) spectra. theestimated errors in the elemental abundances relative to solar are as small as0.025 dex. the abundance ratios [x/fe] as a function of [fe/h] agree closelywith previously established patterns of galactic thin-disk chemical evolution.interestingly, the majority of our stars show a significant correlation between[x/fe] and condensation temperature (tc). in the sample of 22 stars withparameters closest to solar, we find that, on average, low tc elements aredepleted with respect to high tc elements in the solar twins relative to thesun by about 0.08 dex (20%). an increasing trend is observed for the abundancesas a function of tc for 900&lt;tc&lt;1800 k, while abundances of lower tc elementsappear to be roughly constant. we speculate that this is a signature of theplanet formation that occurred around the sun but not in the majority of solartwins. if this hypothesis is correct, stars with planetary systems like ours,although rare (frequency of 15%), may be identified through a very detailedinspection of the chemical compositions of their host stars.

0911.5076	chemical evolution of the galactic bulge as traced by microlensed dwarf  and subgiant stars. ii. ages, metallicities, detailed elemental abundances,  and connections to the galactic thick disc	the bulge is the least understood major stellar population of the milky way.most of what we know about the formation and evolution of the bulge comes frombright giant stars. the underlying assumption that giants represent all thestars, and accurately trace the chemical evolution of a stellar population, isunder debate. in particular, recent observations of a few microlensed dwarfstars give a very different picture of the evolution of the bulge from thatgiven by the giant stars. [abridged] we perform a detailed elemental abundanceanalysis of dwarf stars in the galactic bulge, based on high-resolution spectrathat were obtained while the stars were optically magnified duringgravitational microlensing events. [abridged] we present detailed elementalabundances and stellar ages for six new dwarf stars in the galactic bulge.combining these with previous events, here re-analysed with the same methods,we study a homogeneous sample of 15 stars, which constitute the largest sampleto date of microlensed dwarf stars in the galactic bulge. we find that thestars span the full range of metallicities from [fe/h]=-0.72 to +0.54, and anaverage metallicity of &lt;[fe/h]&gt;=-0.08+/-0.47, close to the average metallicitybased on giant stars in the bulge. furthermore, the stars follow well-definedabundance trends, that for [fe/h]&lt;0 are very similar to those of the localgalactic thick disc. this suggests that the bulge and the thick disc have had,at least partially, comparable chemical histories. at sub-solar metallicitieswe find the bulge dwarf stars to have consistently old ages, while atsuper-solar metallicities we find a wide range of ages. using the new age andabundance results from the microlensed dwarf stars we investigate possibleformation scenarios for the bulge.

1001.3142	an absolutely calibrated effective temperature scale from the infrared  flux method	various effective temperature scales have been proposed over the years.despite much work and the high internal precision usually achieved, systematicdifferences of order 100 k (or more) among various scales are still present. wepresent an investigation based on the infrared flux method aimed at assessingthe source of such discrepancies and pin down their origin.  we break the impasse among different scales by using a large set of solartwins, stars which are spectroscopically and photometrically identical to thesun, to set the absolute zero point of the effective temperature scale towithin few degrees. our newly calibrated, accurate and precise temperaturescale applies to dwarfs and subgiants, from super-solar metallicities to themost metal-poor stars currently known. at solar metallicities our resultsvalidate spectroscopic effective temperature scales, whereas for [fe/h]&lt;-2.5our temperatures are roughly 100 k hotter than those determined from model fitsto the balmer lines and 200 k hotter than those obtained from the excitationequilibrium of fe lines.  empirical bolometric corrections and useful relations linking photometricindices to effective temperatures and angular diameters have been derived. ourresults take full advantage of the high accuracy reached in absolutecalibration in recent years and are further validated by interferometricangular diameters and space based spectrophotometry over a wide range ofeffective temperatures and metallicities.

1007.2760	radiative transfer with scattering for domain-decomposed 3d mhd  simulations of cool stellar atmospheres	we present the implementation of a radiative transfer solver with coherentscattering in the new bifrost code for radiative magneto-hydrodynamical (mhd)simulations of stellar surface convection. the code is fully parallelized usingmpi domain decomposition, which allows for large grid sizes and improvedresolution of hydrodynamical structures. we apply the code to simulate thesurface granulation in a solar-type star, ignoring magnetic fields, andinvestigate the importance of coherent scattering for the atmosphericstructure. a scattering term is added to the radiative transfer equation,requiring an iterative computation of the radiation field. we use ashort-characteristics-based gauss-seidel acceleration scheme to computeradiative flux divergences for the energy equation. the effects of coherentscattering are tested by comparing the temperature stratification of three 3dtime-dependent hydrodynamical atmosphere models of a solar-type star: withoutscattering, with continuum scattering only, and with both continuum and linescattering. we show that continuum scattering does not have a significantimpact on the photospheric temperature structure for a star like the sun.including scattering in line-blanketing, however, leads to a decrease oftemperatures by about 350\,k below log tau &lt; -4. the effect is opposite to thatof 1d hydrostatic models in radiative equilibrium, where scattering reduces thecooling effect of strong lte lines in the higher layers of the photosphere.coherent line scattering also changes the temperature distribution in the highatmosphere, where we observe stronger fluctuations compared to a treatment oflines as true absorbers.

1008.3161	a possible signature of terrestrial planet formation in the chemical  composition of solar analogs	recent studies have shown that the elemental abundances in the sun areanomalous when compared to most (about 85%) nearby solar twin stars. comparedto its twins, the sun exhibits a deficiency of refractory elements (those withcondensation temperatures tc&gt;900k) relative to volatiles (tc&lt;900k). thisfinding is speculated to be a signature of the planet formation that occurredmore efficiently around the sun compared with the majority of solar twins.furthermore, within this scenario, it seems more likely that the abundancepatterns found are specifically related to the formation of terrestrialplanets. in this work we analyze abundance results from six large independentstellar abundance surveys to determine whether they confirm or reject thisobservational finding. we show that the elemental abundances derived for solaranalogs in these six studies are consistent with the tc trend suggested as aplanet formation signature. the same conclusion is reached when those resultsare averaged heterogeneously. we also investigate the dependency of theabundances with first ionization potential (fip), which correlates well withtc. a trend with fip would suggest a different origin for the abundancepatterns found, but we show that the correlation with tc is statistically moresignificant. we encourage similar investigations of metal-rich solar analogsand late f-type dwarf stars, for which the hypothesis of a planet formationsignature in the elemental abundances makes very specific predictions. finally,we examine a recent paper that claims that the abundance patterns of two starshosting super-earth like planets contradict the planet formation signaturehypothesis. instead, we find that the chemical compositions of these two starsare fully compatible with our hypothesis.

1101.3265	three-dimensional surface convection simulations of metal-poor stars --  the effect of scattering on the photospheric temperature stratification	three-dimensional (3d) radiative hydrodynamic model atmospheres of metal-poorlate-type stars are characterized by cooler upper photospheric layers thantheir 1d counterparts. this property of 3d models can dramatically affectelemental abundances derived from temperature-sensitive spectral lines. weinvestigate whether the cool surface temperatures predicted by metal-poor 3dmodels can be ascribed to the approximated treatment of scattering in theradiative transfer. we use the bifrost code to test three different ways tohandle scattering in 3d model atmospheres of metal-poor stars. first, we solveself-consistently the radiative transfer equation for a source function with acoherent scattering term. second, we solve the radiative transfer equation fora planckian source function, neglecting the contribution of continuumscattering to extinction in the optically thin layers; this has been thedefault mode in previous models of ours. third, we treat scattering as pureabsorption everywhere, which is the standard case in co5bold models. we findthat the second approach produces temperature structures with cool upperphotospheric layers very similar to the correct coherent scattering solution.in contrast, treating scattering as pure absorption leads to significantlyhotter and shallower temperature stratifications. the main differences intemperature structure between our published models and those generated with theco5bold code can be traced to the different treatments of scattering.neglecting the contribution of continuum scattering to extinction in opticallythin layers provides a good approximation to the full radiative transfersolution for metal-poor stars. our results demonstrate that the cooltemperature stratifications predicted for metal-poor late-type stellaratmospheres by previous models of ours are not an artifact of the approximatedtreatment of scattering.

1102.1556	the influence of electron collisions on non-lte li line formation in  stellar atmospheres	the influence of the uncertainties in the rate coefficient data forelectron-impact excitation and ionization on non-lte li line formation in coolstellar atmospheres is investigated. we examine the electron collision dataused in previous non-lte calculations and compare them to recent calculationsthat use convergent close-coupling (ccc) techniques and to our own calculationsusing the r-matrix with pseudostates (rmps) method. we find excellent agreementbetween rate coefficients from the ccc and rmps calculations, and reasonableagreement between these data and the semi-empirical data used in non-ltecalculations up to now. the results of non-lte calculations using the old andnew data sets are compared and only small differences found: about 0.01 dex (~2%) or less in the abundance corrections. we therefore conclude that theinfluence on non-lte calculations of uncertainties in the electron collisiondata is negligible. indeed, together with the collision data for the chargeexchange process li(3s) + h &lt;-&gt; li^+ + h^- now available, and barring theexistence of an unknown important collisional process, the collisional data ingeneral is not a source of significant uncertainty in non-lte li line formationcalculations.

1108.3366	3d lte spectral line formation with scattering in red giant stars	we investigate the effects of coherent isotropic continuum scattering on theformation of spectral lines in local thermodynamic equilibrium (lte) using 3dhydrodynamical and 1d hydrostatic model atmospheres of red giant stars.continuum flux levels, spectral line profiles and curves of growth fordifferent species are compared with calculations that treat scattering asabsorption. photons may escape from deeper, hotter layers through scattering,resulting in significantly higher continuum flux levels beneath a wavelength of5000 a. the magnitude of the effect is determined by the importance ofscattering opacity with respect to absorption opacity; we observe the largestchanges in continuum flux at the shortest wavelengths and lowest metallicities;intergranular lanes of 3d models are more strongly affected than granules.continuum scattering acts to increase the profile depth of lte lines: continuagain more brightness than line cores due to their larger thermalization depthin hotter layers. we thus observe the strongest changes in line depth forhigh-excitation species and ionized species, which contribute significantly tophoton thermalization through their absorption opacity near the continuumoptical surface. scattering desaturates the line profiles, leading to largerabundance corrections for stronger lines, which reach -0.5 dex at 3000 a for feii lines in 3d with excitation potential 2 ev at [fe/h]=-3.0. the correctionsare less severe for low-excitation lines, longer wavelengths, and highermetallicity. velocity fields increase the effects of scattering by separatingemission from granules and intergranular lanes in wavelength. 1d calculationsexhibit similar scattering abundance corrections for weak lines, but those forstrong lines are generally smaller compared to 3d models and depend on thechoice of microturbulence.

1202.0548	limb darkening laws for two exoplanet host stars derived from 3d stellar  model atmospheres	we compare limb darkening laws derived from 3d hydrodynamical modelatmospheres and 1d hydrostatic marcs models for the host stars of the twotransiting exoplanet systems hd 209458 and hd 189733. the surface brightnessdistribution of the stellar disks is calculated using 3d lte spectrum formationand opacity sampling. we test our predictions using least-squares fits of modellight curves to primary eclipses that were observed with the hubble spacetelescope (hst).  the limb darkening law derived from the 3d model of hd 209458 between 2900 aand 5700 a produces significantly better fits to the hst data, removingsystematic residuals that were previously observed for model light curves basedon 1d predictions. this difference arises mainly from the shallower meantemperature structure of the 3d model, which is a consequence of the explicitsimulation of surface granulation. in the case of hd 189733, the modelatmospheres produce practically equivalent limb darkening curves between 2900 aand 5700 a, partly due to obstruction by spectral lines, and the data are notsufficient to distinguish between the light curves. we also analyze hstobservations between 5350 a and 10500 a for this star; the 3d model leads to abetter fit compared to 1d predictions.  the significant improvement of fit quality for the hd 209458 systemdemonstrates the higher degree of realism of 3d models and the importance ofsurface granulation for the formation of the atmospheric radiation field oflate-type stars. this result agrees well with recent investigations of limbdarkening in the solar continuum and other observational tests. the case of hd189733 is no contradiction as the model light curves are less sensitive to thetemperature stratification of the atmosphere and the observed data in the 2900a - 5700 a region are not sufficient to distinguish more clearly between 3d and1d limb darkening.

1202.2825	the double sub-giant branch of ngc 6656 (m22): a chemical  characterization	we present an abundance analysis of 101 subgiant branch (sgb) stars in theglobular cluster m22. using low resolution flames/giraffe spectra we havedetermined abundances of the neutron-capture strontium and barium and the lightelement carbon. with these data we explore relationships between the observedsgb photometric split in this cluster and two stellar groups characterized bydifferent contents of iron, slow neutron-capture process (s-process) elements,and the alpha element calcium, that we previously discovered in m22's red-giantstars. we show that the sgb stars correlate in chemical composition andcolor-magnitude diagram position: the stars with higher metallicity andrelative s-process abundances define a fainter sgb, while stars with lowermetallicity and s-process content reside on a relatively brighter sgb. thisresult has implications for the relative ages of the two stellar groups of m22.in particular, it is inconsistent with a large spread in ages of the two sgbs.by accounting for the chemical content of the two stellar groups, isochronefitting of the double sgb suggests that their ages are not different by morethan 300 myr.

1207.0888	the origin of the split red clump in the galactic bulge of the milky way	near the minor axis of the galactic bulge, at latitudes b &lt; -5 degrees, thered giant clump stars are split into two components along the line of sight. weinvestigate this split using the three fields from the argos survey that lie onthe minor axis at (l,b) = (0,-5), (0,-7.5), (0,-10) degrees. the separation isevident for stars with [fe/h] &gt; -0.5 in the two higher-latitude fields, but notin the field at b = -5 degrees. stars with [fe/h] &lt; -0.5 do not show the split.we compare the spatial distribution and kinematics of the clump stars withpredictions from an evolutionary n-body model of a bulge that grew from a diskvia bar-related instabilities. the density distribution of the peanut-shapedmodel is depressed near its minor axis. this produces a bimodal distribution ofstars along the line of sight through the bulge near its minor axis, very muchas seen in our observations. the observed and modelled kinematics of the twogroups of stars are also similar. we conclude that the split red clump of thebulge is probably a generic feature of boxy/peanut bulges that grew from disks,and that the disk from which the bulge grew had relatively few stars with[fe/h] &lt; -0.5

1209.6127	the infrared colors of the sun	solar infrared colors provide powerful constraints on the stellar effectivetemperature scale, but to this purpose they must be measured with both accuracyand precision. we achieve this requirement by using line-depth ratios to derivein a model independent way the infrared colors of the sun, and use the latterto test the zero-point of the casagrande et al. (2010) effective temperaturescale, confirming its accuracy. solar colors in the widely used 2mass -j h k-and wise -w1 w2 w3 w4- systems are provided. a cross check of the effectivetemperatures derived implementing 2mass or wise magnitudes in the infrared fluxmethod confirms that the absolute calibration of the two systems agree withinthe errors, possibly suggesting a 1% offset between the two, thus validatingextant near and mid infrared absolute calibrations. while 2mass magnitudes areusually well suited to derive effective temperatures, we find that a number ofbright, solar-like stars exhibit anomalous wise colors. in most cases thiseffect is spurious and traceable to lower quality measurements, although for acouple of objects (3 +/- 2 % of the total sample) it might be real and hintstowards the presence of warm/hot debris disks.

1211.3157	the most metal-poor stars. iv. the two populations with [fe/h] &lt; -3.0	we discuss the carbon-normal and carbon-rich populations of galactic halostars having [fe/h] &lt; -3.0, utilizing chemical abundances from high-resolution,high-s/n model-atmosphere analyses. the c-rich population represents ~28% ofstars below [fe/h] = -3.1, with the present c-rich sample comprising 16 cemp-nostars, and two others with [fe/h] ~ -5.5 and uncertain classification. thepopulation is o-rich ([o/fe] &gt; +1.5); the light elements na, mg, and al areenhanced relative to fe in half the sample; and for z &gt; 20 (ca) there is littleevidence for enhancements relative to solar values. these results are bestexplained in terms of the admixing and processing of material from h-burningand he-burning regions as achieved by nucleosynthesis in zero-heavy-elementmodels in the literature of "mixing and fallback" supernovae (sne); ofrotating, massive and intermediate mass stars; and of type ii sne withrelativistic jets. the available (limited) radial velocities offer littlesupport for the c-rich stars with [fe/h] &lt; -3.1 being binary. more data arerequired before one could conclude that binarity is key to an understanding ofthis population. we suggest that the c-rich and c-normal populations resultfrom two different gas cooling channels in the very early universe, of materialthat formed the progenitors of the two populations. the first was cooling byfine-structure line transitions of cii and oi (to form the c-rich population);the second, while not well-defined (perhaps dust-induced cooling?), led to thec-normal group. in this scenario, the c-rich population contains the oldeststars currently observed.

1211.6848	chemical evolution of the galactic bulge as traced by microlensed dwarf  and subgiant stars. v. evidence for a wide age distribution and a complex mdf	based on high-resolution spectra obtained during gravitational microlensingevents we present a detailed elemental abundance analysis of 32 dwarf andsubgiant stars in the galactic bulge. [abridged], we now have 58 microlensedbulge dwarfs and subgiants that have been homogeneously analysed. the maincharacteristics of the sample and the findings that can be drawn are: (i) themetallicity distribution (mdf) is wide and spans all metallicities between[fe/h]=-1.9 to +0.6; (ii) the dip in the mdf around solar metallicity that wasapparent in our previous analysis of a smaller sample (26 microlensed stars) isno longer evident; instead it has a complex structure and indications ofmultiple components are starting to emerge. [abridged]; (iii) the stars with[fe/h]&lt;-0.1 are old with ages between 10 and 12 gyr; (iv) the metal-rich starswith [fe/h]&gt;-0.1 show a wide variety of ages, ranging from 2 to 12 gyr with adistribution that has a dominant peak around 4-5 gyr and a tail towards higherages; (v) there are indications in the [alpha/fe] - [fe/h] that the "knee"occurs around [fe/h] = -0.3 to -0.2, which is a slightly higher metallicity ascompared to the "knee" for the local thick disk. this suggests that thechemical enrichment of the metal-poor bulge has been somewhat faster than whatis observed for the local thick disk. the results from the microlensed bulgedwarf stars in combination with other findings in the literature, in particularthe evidence that the bulge has cylindrical rotation, indicate that the milkyway could be an almost pure disk galaxy. the bulge would then just be aconglomerate of the other galactic stellar populations (thin disk, thick disk,halo, and ...?), residing together in the central parts of the galaxy,influenced by the galactic bar.

1212.1540	argos iii: stellar populations in the galactic bulge of the milky way	we present the metallicity results from the argos spectroscopic survey of thegalactic bulge. our aim is to understand the formation of the galactic bulge:did it form via mergers, as expected from lambda cdm theory, or from diskinstabilities, as suggested by its boxy/peanut shape, or both? we have obtainedspectra for 28,000 stars at a spectral resolution of r = 11,000. from thesespectra, we have determined stellar parameters and distances to an accuracy of&lt; 1.5 kpc. the stars in the inner galaxy span a large range in [fe/h], -2.8 &lt;[fe/h] &lt; +0.6. from the spatial distribution of the red clump stars as afunction of [fe/h] (ness et al. 2012a), we propose that the stars with [fe/h] &gt;-0.5 are part of the boxy/peanut bar/bulge. we associate the lower metallicitystars ([fe/h] &lt; -0.5) with the thick disk, which may be puffed up in the innerregion, and with the inner regions of the metal-weak thick disk and inner halo.for the bulge stars with [fe/h] &gt; -0.5, we find two discrete populations; (i)stars with [fe/h] ~ -0.25 which provide a roughly constant fraction of thestars in the latitude interval b = -5 deg to -10 deg, and (ii) a kinematicallycolder, more metal-rich population with mean [fe/h] ~ +0.15 which is moreprominent closer to the plane. the changing ratio of these components withlatitude appears as a vertical abundance gradient of the bulge. we attributeboth of these bulge components to instability-driven bar/bulge formation fromthe thin disk. we do not exclude a weak underlying classical merger-generatedbulge component, but see no obvious kinematic association of any of our bulgestars with such a classical bulge component.

1302.2621	the stagger-grid: a grid of 3d stellar atmosphere models - i. methods  and general properties	we present the stagger-grid, a comprehensive grid of time-dependent, 3dhydrodynamic model atmospheres for late-type stars with realistic treatment ofradiative transfer, covering a wide range in stellar parameters. this grid of3d models is intended for various applications like stellar spectroscopy,asteroseismology and the study of stellar convection. in this introductorypaper, we describe the methods used for the computation of the grid and discussthe general properties of the 3d models as well as their temporal and spatialaverages (&lt;3d&gt;). all our models were generated with the stagger-code, usingrealistic input physics for the equation of state (eos) and for continuous andline opacities. our ~220 grid models range in teff from 4000 to 7000k in stepsof 500k, in log g from 1.5 to 5.0 in steps of 0.5 dex, and [fe/h] from -4.0 to+0.5 in steps of 0.5 and 1.0 dex. we find a tight scaling relation between thevertical velocity and the surface entropy jump, which itself correlates withthe constant entropy value of the adiabatic convection zone. the range inintensity contrast is enhanced at lower metallicity. the granule sizecorrelates closely with the pressure scale height sampled at the depth ofmaximum velocity. we compare the &lt;3d&gt; models with widely applied 1d models, aswell as with theoretical 1d hydrostatic models generated with the same eos andopacity tables as the 3d models, in order to isolate the effects of usingself-consistent and hydrodynamic modeling of convection, rather than theclassical mixing length theory approach. for the first time, we are able toquantify systematically over a broad range of stellar parameters theuncertainties of 1d models arising from the simplified treatment of physics, inparticular convective energy transport. in agreement with previous findings, wefind that the differences can be significant, especially for metal-poor stars.

1303.5187	the sumo project i. a survey of multiple populations in globular  clusters	we present a general overview and the first results of the sumo project (asurvey of multiple populations in globular clusters). the objective of thissurvey is the study of multiple stellar populations in the largest sample ofglobular clusters homogeneously analysed to date. to this aim we obtained highsignal-to-noise (s/n&gt;50) photometry for main sequence stars with mass down to~0.5 m_sun in a large sample of clusters using both archival and proprietary u,b, v, and i data from ground-based telescopes. in this paper, we focus on theoccurrence of multiple stellar populations in twenty three clusters. we havedefined a new photometric index cubi= (u-b)-(b-i), that turns out to be veryeffective for identifying multiple sequences along the red giant branch (rgb).we found that in the v-cubi diagram all clusters presented in this paper showbroadened or multimodal rgbs, with the presence of two or more components. wefound a direct connection with the chemical properties of different sequences,that display different abundances of light elements (o, na, c, n, and al). thecubi index is also a powerful tool to identify distinct sequences of starsalong the horizontal branch and, for the first time in the case of ngc104 (47tuc), along the asymptotic giant branch. our results demonstrate that i) thepresence of more than two stellar populations is a common feature amongglobular clusters, as already highlighted in previous work; ii) multiplesequences with different chemical contents can be easily identified by usingstandard johnson photometry obtained with ground-based facilities; iii) in thestudy of gc multiple stellar populations the cubi index is alternative tospectroscopy, and has the advantage of larger statistics.

1303.6656	argos iv: the kinematics of the milky way bulge	we present the kinematic results from our argos spectroscopic survey of thegalactic bulge of the milky way. our aim is to understand the formation of thegalactic bulge. we examine the kinematics of about 17,400 stars in the bulgelocated within 3.5 kpc of the galactic centre, identified from the 28,000 starargos survey. we aim to determine if the formation of the bulge has beeninternally driven from disk instabilities as suggested by its boxy shape, or ifmergers have played a significant role as expected from lambda cdm simulations.from our velocity measurements across latitudes b = -5 deg, -7.5 deg and -10deg we find the bulge to be a cylindrically rotating system that transitionssmoothly out into the disk. within the bulge, we find a kinematically distinctmetal-poor population ([fe/h] &lt; -1.0) that is not rotating cylindrically. the5% of our stars with [fe/h] &lt; -1.0 are a slowly rotating spheroidal population,which we believe are stars of the metal weak thick disk and halo whichpresently lie in the inner galaxy. the kinematics of the two bulge componentsthat we identified in argos paper iii (mean [fe/h] = -0.25 and [fe/h] = +0.15,respectively) demonstrate that they are likely to share a common formationorigin and are distinct from the more metal poor populations of the thick diskand halo which are colocated inside the bulge. we do not exclude an underlyingmerger generated bulge component but our results favour bulge formation frominstabilities in the early thin disk.

1310.8581	chemical signatures of planets: beyond solar-twins	elemental abundance studies of solar twin stars suggest that the solarchemical composition contains signatures of the formation of terrestrialplanets in the solar system, namely small but significant depletions of therefractory elements. to test this hypothesis, we study stars which, compared tosolar twins, have less massive convective envelopes (therefore increasing theamplitude of the predicted effect) or are, arguably, more likely to hostplanets (thus increasing the frequency of signature detections). we measurerelative atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances of a late-f type dwarfsample (52 stars) and a sample of metal-rich solar analogs (59 stars). wedetect refractory-element depletions with amplitudes up to about 0.15 dex. thedistribution of depletion amplitudes for stars known to host gas giant planetsis not different from that of the rest of stars. the maximum amplitude ofdepletion increases with effective temperature from 5650 k to 5950 k, while itappears to be constant for warmer stars (up to 6300 k). the depletions observedin solar twin stars have a maximum amplitude that is very similar to that seenhere for both of our samples. gas giant planet formation alone cannot explainthe observed distributions of refractory-element depletions, leaving theformation of rocky material as a more likely explanation of our observations.more rocky material is necessary to explain the data of solar twins thanmetal-rich stars, and less for warm stars. however, the sizes of the stars'convective envelopes at the time of planet formation could be regulating theseamplitudes. our results could be explained if disk lifetimes were shorter inmore massive stars, as independent observations indeed seem to suggest.

1312.4169	global and non-global parameters of horizontal branch morphology of  globular clusters	the horizontal branch (hb) morphology of globular clusters (gcs) is mainlydetermined by metallicity. however, the fact that gcs with almost the samemetallicity exhibit different hb morphologies demonstrates that at least onemore parameter is needed to explain the hb morphology. it has been suggestedthat one of these should be a global parameter that varies from gc to gc, andthe other a non-global parameter that varies within the gc. in this study weprovide empirical evidence corroborating this idea. we used the photometriccatalogs obtained with the advanced camera for surveys (acs) of the hubblespace telescope (hst) and analyse the cmds of 74 gcs. the hb morphology of oursample of gcs has been investigated on the basis of the two new parameters l1and l2 that measure the distance between the rgb and the coolest part of thehb, and the color extension of the hb, respectively. we find that l1 correlateswith both metallicity and age, whereas l2 most strongly correlates with themass of the hosting gc. the range of helium abundance among the stars in a gc,characterised by delta y and associated with the presence of multiple stellarpopulations, has been estimated in a few gcs to date. in these gcs we find aclose relationship among delta y, gc mass, and l2. we conclude that age andmetallicity are the main global parameters while the range of helium abundancewithin a gc is the main non-global parameter defining the hb morphology ofgalactic gcs.

1312.6472	the gaia-eso survey: abundance ratios in the inner-disk open clusters  trumpler 20, ngc 4815, ngc 6705	open clusters are key tools to study the spatial distribution of abundancesin the disk and their evolution with time. using the first release of stellarparameters and abundances of the gaia-eso survey, we analyse the chemicalproperties of stars in three old/intermediate-age open clusters, namely ngc6705, ngc 4815, and trumpler 20, all located in the inner part of the galacticdisk at galactocentric radius r$_{gc}\sim$7 kpc, aiming at proving theirhomogeneity and at comparing them with the field population. we study theabundance ratios of elements belonging to two different nucleosyntheticchannels: $\alpha$-elements and iron-peak elements. the main results can besummarised as follows: i) cluster members are chemically homogeneous within3-$\sigma$ in all analysed elements; ii) the three clusters have comparable[el/fe] patters within $\sim$1-$\sigma$, but they differ in their global metalcontent [el/h], with ngc 4815 having the lowest metallicity. their [el/fe]ratios show differences and analogies with those of the field population, bothin the solar neighbourhood and in the bulge/inner disk; iii) comparing theabundance ratios with the results of two chemical evolution models and withfield star abundance distributions, we find that the abundance ratios of mg,ni, ca in ngc 6705 might require an inner birthplace, implying a subsequentvariation of its r$_{gc}$ during its lifetime, consistent with previous orbitdetermination. the full dataset of the gaia-eso survey will be a superlativetool to constrain the chemical evolution of our galaxy by disentanglingdifferent formation and evolution scenarios.

1401.3754	towards stellar effective temperatures and diameters at one per cent  accuracy for future surveys	the apparent size of stars is a crucial benchmark for fundamental stellarproperties such as effective temperatures, radii and surface gravities. whileinterferometric measurements of stellar angular diameters are the most directmethod to gauge these, they are still limited to relatively nearby and brightstars, which are saturated in most of the modern photometric surveys. thisdichotomy prevents us from safely extending well calibrated relations to thefaint stars targeted in large spectroscopic and photometric surveys. here, wealleviate this obstacle by presenting saao near-infrared jhk observations of 55stars: 16 of them have interferometric angular diameters, and the rest are incommon with the 2mass (unsaturated) dataset, allowing us to tie the effectivetemperatures and angular diameters derived via the infrared flux method to theinterferometric scale. we extend the test to recent interferometricmeasurements of unsaturated 2mass stars, including giants, and the metal-poorbenchmark target hd122563. with a critical evaluation of the systematicsinvolved, we conclude that a 1% accuracy in fundamental stellar parameters isusually within reach. caution, however, must be used when indirectly testing atemperature scale via colour relations, as well as when assessing thereliability of interferometric measurements, especially at sub-milliarcseclevel. as a result, rather different effective temperature scales can becompatible with a given subset of interferometric data. we highlight somecaveats to be aware of in such a quest, and suggest a simple method to checkagainst systematics in fundamental measurements. a new diagnostic combinationseismic radii with astrometric distances is also presented.

1401.4437	the gaia-eso survey: radial metallicity gradients and age-metallicity  relation of stars in the milky way disk	we study the relationship between age, metallicity, and alpha-enhancement offgk stars in the galactic disk. the results are based upon the analysis ofhigh-resolution uves spectra from the gaia-eso large stellar survey. we explorethe limitations of the observed dataset, i.e. the accuracy of stellarparameters and the selection effects that are caused by the photometric targetpreselection. we find that the colour and magnitude cuts in the survey suppressold metal-rich stars and young metal-poor stars. this suppression may be ashigh as 97% in some regions of the age-metallicity relationship. the datasetconsists of 144 stars with a wide range of ages from 0.5 gyr to 13.5 gyr,galactocentric distances from 6 kpc to 9.5 kpc, and vertical distances from theplane 0 &lt; |z| &lt; 1.5 kpc. on this basis, we find that i) the observedage-metallicity relation is nearly flat in the range of ages between 0 gyr and8 gyr; ii) at ages older than 9 gyr, we see a decrease in [fe/h] and a clearabsence of metal-rich stars; this cannot be explained by the survey selectionfunctions; iii) there is a significant scatter of [fe/h] at any age; and iv)[mg/fe] increases with age, but the dispersion of [mg/fe] at ages &gt; 9 gyr isnot as small as advocated by some other studies. in agreement with earlierwork, we find that radial abundance gradients change as a function of verticaldistance from the plane. the [mg/fe] gradient steepens and becomes negative. inaddition, we show that the inner disk is not only more alpha-rich compared tothe outer disk, but also older, as traced independently by the ages and mgabundances of stars.

1402.1517	a single low-energy, iron-poor supernova as the source of metals in the  star smss j 031300.36-670839.3	the element abundance ratios of four low-mass stars with extremely lowmetallicities indicate that the gas out of which the stars formed was enrichedin each case by at most a few, and potentially only one low-energy, supernova.such supernovae yield large quantities of light elements such as carbon butvery little iron. the dominance of low-energy supernovae is surprising, becauseit has been expected that the first stars were extremely massive, and that theydisintegrated in pair-instability explosions that would rapidly enrich galaxiesin iron. what has remained unclear is the yield of iron from the firstsupernovae, because hitherto no star is unambiguously interpreted asencapsulating the yield of a single supernova. here we report the opticalspectrum of smss j031300.36- 670839.3, which shows no evidence of iron (with anupper limit of 10^-7.1 times solar abundance). based on a comparison of itsabundance pattern with those of models, we conclude that the star was seededwith material from a single supernova with an original mass of ~60 mo (and thatthe supernova left behind a black hole). taken together with the previouslymentioned low-metallicity stars, we conclude that low-energy supernovae werecommon in the early universe, and that such supernovae yield light elementenrichment with insignificant iron. reduced stellar feedback both chemicallyand mechanically from low-energy supernovae would have enabled first-generationstars to form over an extended period. we speculate that such stars may perhapshave had an important role in the epoch of cosmic reionization and the chemicalevolution of early galaxies.

1403.2754	stroemgren survey for asteroseismology and galactic archaeology: let the  saga begin	asteroseismology has the capability of precisely determining stellarproperties which would otherwise be inaccessible, such as radii, masses andthus ages of stars. when coupling this information with classicaldeterminations of stellar parameters, such as metallicities, effectivetemperatures and angular diameters, powerful new diagnostics for galacticstudies can be obtained. the ongoing stroemgren survey for asteroseismology andgalactic archaeology (saga) has the goal of transforming the kepler field intoa new benchmark for galactic studies, similarly to the solar neighborhood. herewe present first results from a stripe centred at galactic longitude 74deg andcovering latitude from about 8 to 20deg, which includes almost 1000 k-giantswith seismic information and the benchmark open cluster ngc 6819. we describethe coupling of classical and seismic parameters, the accuracy as well as thecaveats of the derived effective temperatures, metallicities, distances,surface gravities, masses, and radii. confidence in the achieved precision iscorroborated by the detection of the first and secondary clump in a populationof field stars with a ratio of 2 to 1, and by the negligible scatter in theseismic distances among ngc 6819 member stars. an assessment of the reliabilityof stellar parameters in the kepler input catalogue is also performed, and theimpact of our results for population studies in the milky way is discussed,along with the importance of an all-sky stroemgren survey.

1403.4865	the gaia-eso survey: processing of the flames-uves spectra	the gaia-eso survey is a large public spectroscopic survey that aims toderive radial velocities and fundamental parameters of about 10^5 milky waystars in the field and in clusters. observations are carried out with themulti-object optical spectrograph flames, using simultaneously the mediumresolution (r~20,000) giraffe spectrograph and the high resolution (r~47,000)uves spectrograph. in this paper, we describe the methods and the software usedfor the data reduction, the derivation of the radial velocities, and thequality control of the flames-uves spectra. data reduction has been performedusing a workflow specifically developed for this project. this workflow runsthe eso public pipeline optimizing the data reduction for the gaia-eso survey,performs automatically sky subtraction, barycentric correction andnormalisation, and calculates radial velocities and a first guess of therotational velocities. the quality control is performed using the outputparameters from the eso pipeline, by a visual inspection of the spectra and bythe analysis of the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectra.  using the observations of the first 18 months, specifically targets observedmultiple times at different epochs, stars observed with both giraffe and uves,and observations of radial velocity standards, we estimated the precision andthe accuracy of the radial velocities. the statistical error on the radialvelocities is sigma~0.4 km s^-1 and is mainly due to uncertainties in the zeropoint of the wavelength calibration. however, we found a systematic bias withrespect to the giraffe spectra (~0.9 km s^-1) and to the radial velocities ofthe standard stars (~0.5 kms^-1) retrieved from the literature. this bias willbe corrected in the future data releases, when a common zero point for all thesetups and instruments used for the survey will be established.

1403.7568	the gaia-eso survey: the galactic thick to thin disc transition	(abridged) we have used the atmospheric parameters, [alpha/fe] abundances andradial velocities, determined from the gaia-eso survey giraffe spectra offgk-type stars (idr1), to provide a chemo-kinematical characterisation of thedisc stellar populations. we focuss on a subsample of 1016 stars with highquality parameters, covering the volume |z|&lt;4.5kpc and r in the range 2-13kpc.we have identified a thin to thick disc separation in the [alpha/fe] vs [m/h]plane, thanks to the presence of a low-density region in the number densitydistribution. the thick disc stars seem to lie in progressively thinner layersabove the galactic plane, as metallicity increases and [alpha/fe] decreases.the thin disc population presents a constant value of the mean distance to theplane at all metallicities. our data confirm the already known correlationsbetween v_phi and [m/h] for the two discs. for the thick disc sequence, a studyof the possible contamination by thin disc stars suggests a gradient up to64km/s/dex. the distributions of v_phi, v_z, and orbital parameters areanalysed for the chemically separated samples. concerning the gradients withgalactocentric radius, we find for the thin disc a flat behaviour of v_phi, a[m/h] gradient of -0.058dex/kpc and a small positive [alpha/fe] gradient. forthe thick disc, flat gradients in [m/h] and [alpha/fe] are derived. ourchemo-kinematical analysis suggests a picture in which the thick disc seems tohave experienced a settling process, during which its rotation increasedprogressively, and, possibly, the v_phi dispersion decreased. at [m/h]-0.25dexand [alpha/fe]0.1dex, the mean characteristics of the thick disc in distance tothe galactic plane, v_phi, v_phi dispersion and eccentricity agree with thoseof the thin disc stars, suggesting a possible connection between thesepopulations at a certain epoch of the disc evolution.

1404.2112	a high precision chemical abundance analysis of the hat-p-1 stellar  binary: constraints on planet formation	we present a high-precision, differential elemental abundance analysis of thehat-p-1 stellar binary based on high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratiokeck/hires spectra. the secondary star in this double system is known to host atransiting giant planet while no planets have yet been detected around theprimary star. the derived metallicities ([fe/h]) of the primary and secondarystars are identical within the errors: $0.146 \pm 0.014$ dex ($\sigma$ = 0.033dex) and $0.155 \pm 0.007$ dex ($\sigma$ = 0.023 dex), respectively. extremelyprecise differential abundance ratios of 23 elements have been measured (meanerror of $\sigma$([x/fe]) = 0.013 dex) and are found to be indistinguishablebetween the two stars: $\delta$[x/fe] (secondary - primary) = $+0.001 \pm0.006$ dex ($\sigma$ = 0.008 dex). the striking similarity in the chemicalcomposition of the two stellar components in hat-p-1 is contrary to thepossible 0.04 dex level difference seen in 16 cyg a+b, which also hosts a giantplanet, at least 3 times more massive than the one around hat-p-1 secondarystar. we conclude that the presence of giant planets does not necessarily implydifferences in the chemical compositions of the host stars. the elementalabundances of each star in hat-p-1 relative to the sun show an identical,positive correlation with the condensation temperature of the elements; theirabundance patterns are thus very similar to those observed in the majority ofsolar twins. in view of the melendez et al. (2009)'s interpretation of thepeculiar solar abundance pattern, we conclude that hat-p-1 experienced lessefficient formation of terrestrial planets than the sun. this is in line withthe expectation that the presence of close-in giant planets preventing theformation or survival of terrestrial planets.

1405.5846	exploring the origin of lithium, carbon, strontium and barium with four  new ultra metal-poor stars	we present an elemental abundance analysis for four newly discovered ultrametal-poor stars from the hamburg/eso survey, with $\mathrm{[fe/h]}\leq-4$.based on high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra, we derive abundancesfor 17 elements in the range from li to ba. three of the four stars exhibitmoderate to large over-abundances of carbon, but have no enhancements in theirneutron-capture elements. the most metal-poor star in the sample,he~0233$-$0343 ($\mathrm{[fe/h]} = -4.68$), is a subgiant with a carbonenhancement of $\mathrm{[c/fe]}= +3.5$, slightly above the carbon-enhancementplateau suggested by spite et al. no carbon is detected in the spectrum of thefourth star, but the quality of its spectrum only allows for the determinationof an upper limit on the carbon abundance ratio of $\mathrm{[c/fe]} &lt; +1.7$. wedetect lithium in the spectra of two of the carbon-enhanced stars, includinghe~0233$-$0343. both stars with li detections are li-depleted, with respect tothe li plateau for metal-poor dwarfs found by spite \&amp; spite. this suggeststhat whatever site(s) produced c either do not completely destroy lithium, orthat li has been astrated by early-generation stars and mixed with primordialli in the gas that formed the stars observed at present. the derived abundancesfor the $\alpha$-elements and iron-peak elements of the four stars are similarto those found in previous large samples of extremely and ultra metal-poorstars. finally, a large spread is found in the abundances of sr and ba forthese stars, possibly influenced by enrichment from fast rotating stars in theearly universe.

1406.0944	the halo+cluster system of the galactic globular cluster ngc1851	ngc1851 is surrounded by a stellar component that extends more than ten timesbeyond the tidal radius. although the nature of this stellar structure is notknown, it has been suggested to be a sparse halo of stars or associated with astellar stream. we analyse the nature of this intriguing stellar componentsurrounding ngc1851 by investigating its radial velocities and chemicalcomposition, in particular in comparison with those of the central clusteranalysed in a homogeneous manner. in total we observed 23 stars in the halowith radial velocities consistent with ngc1851, and for 15 of them we infer[fe/h] abundances. our results show that: (i) stars dynamically linked tongc1851 are present at least up to ~2.5 tidal radii, supporting the presence ofa halo of stars surrounding the cluster; (ii) apart from the ngc1851 radialvelocity-like stars, our observed velocity distribution agrees with thatexpected from galactic models, suggesting that no other sub-structure (such asa stream) at different radial velocities is present in our field; (iii) thechemical abundances for the s-process elements sr and ba are consistent withthe s-normal stars observed in ngc1851; (iv) all halo stars have metallicities,and abundances for the other studied elements ca, mg and cr, consistent withthose exhibited by the cluster. the complexity of the whole ngc1851cluster+halo system may agree with the scenario of a tidally-disrupted dwarfgalaxy in which ngc1851 was originally embedded.

1406.5244	18 sco: a solar twin rich in refractory and neutron-capture elements.  implications for chemical tagging	we study with unprecedented detail the chemical composition and stellarparameters of the solar twin 18 sco in a strictly differential sense relativeto the sun. our study is mainly based on high resolution (r ~ 110 000) high s/n(800-1000) vlt uves spectra, which allow us to achieve a precision of about0.005 dex in differential abundances. the effective temperature and surfacegravity of 18 sco are teff = 5823+/-6 k and log g = 4.45+/-0.02 dex, i.e., 18sco is 46+/-6 k hotter than the sun and log g is 0.01+/-0.02 dex higher. itsmetallicity is [fe/h] = 0.054+/-0.005 dex and its microturbulence velocity is+0.02+/-0.01 km/s higher than solar. our precise stellar parameters anddifferential isochrone analysis show that 18 sco has a mass of 1.04+/-0.02m_sunand that it is ~1.6 gyr younger than the sun. we use precise harps radialvelocities to search for planets, but none were detected. the chemicalabundance pattern of 18 sco displays a clear trend with condensationtemperature, showing thus higher abundances of refractories in 18 sco than inthe sun. intriguingly, there are enhancements in the neutron-capture elementsrelative to the sun. despite the small element-to-element abundance differencesamong nearby n-capture elements (~0.02 dex), we successfully reproduce ther-process pattern in the solar system. this is independent evidence for theuniversality of the r-process. our results have important implications forchemical tagging in our galaxy and nucleosynthesis in general.

1409.0568	gaia-eso survey: the analysis of high-resolution uves spectra of  fgk-type stars	the gaia-eso survey is obtaining high-quality spectroscopic data for about10^5 stars using flames at the vlt. uves high-resolution spectra are beingcollected for about 5000 fgk-type stars. these uves spectra are analyzed inparallel by several state-of-the-art methodologies. our aim is to present howthese analyses were implemented, to discuss their results, and to describe howa final recommended parameter scale is defined. we also discuss the precision(method-to-method dispersion) and accuracy (biases with respect to thereference values) of the final parameters. these results are part of thegaia-eso 2nd internal release and will be part of its 1st public release ofadvanced data products. the final parameter scale is tied to the one defined bythe gaia benchmark stars, a set of stars with fundamental atmosphericparameters. a set of open and globular clusters is used to evaluate thephysical soundness of the results. each methodology is judged against thebenchmark stars to define weights in three different regions of the parameterspace. the final recommended results are the weighted-medians of those from theindividual methods. the recommended results successfully reproduce thebenchmark stars atmospheric parameters and the expected teff-log g relation ofthe calibrating clusters. atmospheric parameters and abundances have beendetermined for 1301 fgk-type stars observed with uves. the median of themethod-to-method dispersion of the atmospheric parameters is 55 k for teff,0.13 dex for log g, and 0.07 dex for [fe/h]. systematic biases are estimated tobe between 50-100 k for teff, 0.10-0.25 dex for log g, and 0.05-0.10 dex for[fe/h]. abundances for 24 elements were derived: c, n, o, na, mg, al, si, ca,sc, ti, v, cr, mn, fe, co, ni, cu, zn, y, zr, mo, ba, nd, and eu. the typicalmethod-to-method dispersion of the abundances varies between 0.10 and 0.20 dex.

1409.1230	stellar chemical abundances: in pursuit of the highest achievable  precision	the achievable level of precision on photospheric abundances of stars is amajor limiting factor on investigations of exoplanet host star characteristics,the chemical histories of star clusters, and the evolution of the milky way andother galaxies. while model-induced errors can be minimized through thedifferential analysis of spectrally similar stars, the maximum achievableprecision of this technique has been debated. as a test, we derive differentialabundances of 19 elements from high-quality asteroid-reflected solar spectrataken using a variety of instruments and conditions. we treat the solar spectraas being from unknown stars and use the resulting differential abundances,which are expected to be zero, as a diagnostic of the error in ourmeasurements. our results indicate that the relative resolution of the targetand reference spectra is a major consideration, with use of differentinstruments to obtain the two spectra leading to errors up to 0.04 dex. use ofthe same instrument at different epochs for the two spectra has a much smallereffect (~0.007 dex). the asteroid used to obtain the solar standard also has anegligible effect (~0.006 dex). assuming that systematic errors from thestellar model atmospheres have been minimized, as in the case of solar twins,we confirm that differential chemical abundances can be obtained at sub-0.01dex precision with due care in the observations, data reduction and abundanceanalysis.

0804.4124	chemical similarities between galactic bulge and local thick disk red  giant stars	the evolution of the milky way bulge and its relationship with the othergalactic populations is still poorly understood. the bulge has been suggestedto be either a merger-driven classical bulge or the product of a dynamicalinstability of the inner disk. to probe the star formation history, the initialmass function and stellar nucleosynthesis of the bulge, we performed anelemental abundance analysis of bulge red giant stars. we also completed anidentical study of local thin disk, thick disk and halo giants to establish thechemical differences and similarities between the various populations.high-resolution infrared spectra of 19 bulge giants and 49 comparison giants inthe solar neighborhood were acquired with gemini/phoenix. all stars havesimilar stellar parameters but cover a broad range in metallicity. a standard1d local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis yielded the abundances of c, n, oand fe. a homogeneous and differential analysis of the bulge, halo, thin diskand thick disk stars ensured that systematic errors were minimized. we confirmthe well-established differences for [o/fe] (at a given metallicity) betweenthe local thin and thick disks. for the elements investigated, we find nochemical distinction between the bulge and the local thick disk, which is incontrast to previous studies relying on literature values for disk dwarf starsin the solar neighborhood. our findings suggest that the bulge and local thickdisk experienced similar, but not necessarily shared, chemical evolutionhistories. we argue that their formation timescales, star formation rates andinitial mass functions were similar.

1503.02082	testing the chemical tagging technique with open clusters	context. stars are born together from giant molecular clouds and, if weassume that the priors were chemically homogeneous and well-mixed, we expectthem to share the same chemical composition. most of the stellar aggregates aredisrupted while orbiting the galaxy and most of the dynamic information islost, thus the only possibility of reconstructing the stellar formation historyis to analyze the chemical abundances that we observe today.  aims. the chemical tagging technique aims to recover disrupted stellarclusters based merely on their chemical composition. we evaluate the viabilityof this technique to recover co-natal stars that are no longer gravitationallybound.  methods. open clusters are co-natal aggregates that have managed to survivetogether. we compiled stellar spectra from 31 old and intermediate-age openclusters, homogeneously derived atmospheric parameters, and 17 abundancespecies, and applied machine learning algorithms to group the stars based ontheir chemical composition. this approach allows us to evaluate the viabilityand efficiency of the chemical tagging technique.  results. we found that stars at different evolutionary stages have distinctchemical patterns that may be due to nlte effects, atomic diffusion, mixing,and biases. when separating stars into dwarfs and giants, we observed that afew open clusters show distinct chemical signatures while the majority show ahigh degree of overlap. this limits the recovery of co-natal aggregates byapplying the chemical tagging technique. nevertheless, there is room forimprovement if more elements are included and models are improved.

1510.01376	measuring the vertical age structure of the galactic disc using  asteroseismology and saga	the existence of a vertical age gradient in the milky way disc has beenindirectly known for long. here, we measure it directly for the first time withseismic ages, using red giants observed by kepler. we use stroemgren photometryto gauge the selection function of asteroseismic targets, and derive colour andmagnitude limits where giants with measured oscillations are representative ofthe underlying population in the field. limits in the 2mass system are alsoderived. we lay out a method to assess and correct for target selection effectsindependent of galaxy models. we find that low mass, i.e. old red giantsdominate at increasing galactic heights, whereas closer to the galactic planethey exhibit a wide range of ages and metallicities. parametrizing this as avertical gradient returns approximately 4 gyr/kpc for the disc we probe,although with a large dispersion of ages at all heights. the ages of stars showa smooth distribution over the last 10 gyr, consistent with a mostly quiescentevolution for the milky way disc since a redshift of about 2. we also find aflat age-metallicity relation for disc stars. finally, we show how to usesecondary clump stars to estimate the present-day intrinsic metallicity spread,and suggest using their number count as a new proxy for tracing the ageing ofthe disc. this work highlights the power of asteroseismology for galacticstudies; however, we also emphasize the need for better constraints on stellarmass-loss, which is a major source of systematic age uncertainties in red giantstars.

1511.03930	extremely metal-poor stars from the cosmic dawn in the bulge of the  milky way	the first stars are predicted to have formed within 200 million years afterthe big bang, initiating the cosmic dawn. a true first star has not yet beendiscovered, although stars with tiny amounts of elements heavier than helium('metals') have been found in the outer regions ('halo') of the milky way. thefirst stars and their immediate successors should, however, preferentially befound today in the central regions ('bulges') of galaxies, because they formedin the largest over-densities that grew gravitationally with time. the milkyway bulge underwent a rapid chemical enrichment during the first 1-2 billionyears, leading to a dearth of early, metal-poor stars. here we reportobservations of extremely metal-poor stars in the milky way bulge, includingone star with an iron abundance about 10,000 times lower than the solar valuewithout noticeable carbon enhancement. we confirm that the most metal-poorbulge stars are on tight orbits around the galactic centre, rather than beinghalo stars passing through the bulge, as expected for stars formed at redshiftsgreater than 15. their chemical compositions are in general similar to typicalhalo stars of the same metallicity although intriguing differences exist,including lower abundances of carbon.

1511.09287	the detailed chemical composition of the terrestrial planet host  kepler-10	chemical abundance studies of the sun and solar twins have demonstrated thatthe solar composition of refractory elements is depleted when compared tovolatile elements, which could be due to the formation of terrestrial planets.in order to further examine this scenario, we conducted a line-by-linedifferential chemical abundance analysis of the terrestrial planet hostkepler-10 and fourteen of its stellar twins. stellar parameters and elementalabundances of kepler-10 and its stellar twins were obtained with very highprecision using a strictly differential analysis of high quality cfht, het andmagellan spectra. when compared to the majority of thick disc twins, kepler-10shows a depletion in the refractory elements relative to the volatile elements,which could be due to the formation of terrestrial planets in the kepler-10system. the average abundance pattern corresponds to ~ 13 earth masses, whilethe two known planets in kepler-10 system have a combined ~ 20 earth masses.for two of the eight thick disc twins, however, no depletion patterns arefound. although our results demonstrate that several factors (e.g., planetsignature, stellar age, stellar birth location and galactic chemical evolution)could lead to or affect abundance trends with condensation temperature, we findthat the trends give further support for the planetary signature hypothesis.

astro-ph;0005319	the effects of numerical resolution on hydrodynamical surface convection  simulations and spectral line formation	the computationally demanding nature of radiative-hydrodynamical simulationsof stellar surface convection warrants an investigation of the sensitivity ofthe convective structure and spectral synthesis to the numerical resolution anddimension of the simulations, which is presented here. with too coarse aresolution the predicted spectral lines tend to be too narrow, reflectinginsufficient doppler broadening from the convective motions, while at thecurrently highest affordable resolution the line shapes have convergedessentially perfectly to the observed profiles. similar conclusions are drawnfrom the line asymmetries and shifts. in terms of abundances, weak fei and feiilines show a very small dependence (~0.02 dex) while for intermediate stronglines with significant non-thermal broadening the sensitivity increases (~0.10dex). problems arise when using 2d convection simulations to describe aninherent 3d phenomenon, which translates to inaccurate atmospheric velocityfields and temperature and pressure structures. in 2d the theoretical lineprofiles tend to be too shallow and broad compared with the 3d calculations andobservations, in particular for intermediate strong lines. in terms ofabundances, the 2d results are systematically about 0.1 dex lower than for the3d case for fei lines. furthermore, the predicted line asymmetries and shiftsare much inferior in 2d. given these shortcomings and computing timeconsiderations it is better to use 3d simulations of even modest resolutionthan high-resolution 2d simulations.

astro-ph;0005321	line formation in solar granulation: ii. the photospheric fe abundance	the solar photospheric fe abundance has been determined using realistic abinitio 3d, time-dependent, hydrodynamical model atmospheres. the study is basedon the excellent agreement between the predicted and observed line profilesdirectly rather than equivalent width, since the intrinsic doppler broadeningfrom the convective motions and oscillations provide the necessary non-thermalbroadening. thus, three of the four hotly debated parameters (equivalentwidths, microturbulence and damping enhancement factors) in the center of therecent solar fe abundance dispute regarding fei lines no longer enter theanalysis, leaving the transition probabilities as the main uncertainty. bothfei (using the samples of lines of both the oxford and kiel studies) and feiilines have been investigated, which give consistent results: log fei = 7.44 +-0.05 and log feii = 7.45 +- 0.10. also the wings of strong fei lines returnconsistent abundances, log feii = 7.42 +- 0.03, but due to the uncertaintiesinherent in analyses of strong lines we give this determination lower weightthan the results from weak and intermediate strong lines. in view of the recentslight downward revision of the meteoritic fe abundance log fe = 7.46 +- 0.01,the agreement between the meteoritic and photospheric values is very good, thusappearingly settling the debate over the photospheric fe abundance from feilines.

astro-ph;0104071	on oh line formation and oxygen abundances in metal-poor stars	the formation of the uv oh spectral lines has been investigated for a rangeof stellar parameters in the light of 3d hydrodynamical model atmospheres. thelow atmospheric temperatures encountered at low metallicities compared with theradiative equilibrium values enforced in classical 1d hydrostatic modelatmospheres have a profound impact on the oh line strengths. as a consequence,the derived o abundances using 3d models are found to be systematically lowerby more than 0.6 dex at [fe/h]=-3.0 compared with previous 1d analyses, castingdoubts on the recent claims for a monotonic increase in [o/fe] towards lowermetallicities. in fact, taken at face value the resulting 3d lte trend is inrough agreement with the conventional [o/fe] plateau. caution must, however, beexercised in view of the remaining assumptions in the 3d calculations. we haveverified that the stellar parameters remain essentially unchanged with 3d modelatmospheres provided that the infrared flux method, hipparcos parallaxes andfeii lines are utilised, leaving the 3d o abundances from oh lines largelyintact. greater concern stems from possible departures from lte in both theline formation and the molecular equilibrium, which, if present, would increasethe derived o abundances again. non-lte line formation calculations with 1dmodel atmospheres suggest no significant steepening of the [o/fe] trend even ifthe abundance corrections amount to about 0.2 dex for all investigated stellarparameters. we note, however, that the 3d case may not necessarily be asmetallicity-independent. the apparent lack of laboratory or theoretical ratecoefficients at the relevant temperatures for the involved molecular reactionsunfortunately prevents a quantitative discussion on the possible effects ofnon-equilibrium chemistry.

astro-ph;0312291	line formation in solar granulation: v. missing uv-opacity and the  photospheric be abundance	the possibility of unaccounted for opacity sources in the uv for late-typestars has often been invoked to explain discrepancies between predicted andobserved flux distributions and spectral line strengths. such missinguv-opacity could among other things have a significant impact on abundancedetermination for elements whose only relevant spectral features are accessiblein this wavelength region, such as be. here, the study by balachandran &amp; bell(1998) is re-visited in the light of a realistic 3d hydrodynamical solar modelatmosphere and the recently significantly downward revised solar o abundanceobtained with the same model atmosphere. the amount of missing uv-opacity, ifany, is quantified by enforcing that the oh a-x electronic lines around 313 nmproduce the same o abundance as the other available diagnostics: ohvibration-rotation and pure rotation lines in the ir, the forbidden [oi] 630.0and 636.3 nm lines and high-excitation, permitted oi lines. this additionalopacity is then applied for the synthesis of the beii line at 313.0nm to derivea solar photospheric be abundance in excellent agreement with the meteoriticvalue, thus re-enforcing the conclusions of balachandran &amp; bell. the about 50%extra opacity over accounted for opacity sources can be well explained byrecent calculations by the iron project for photo-ionization of fei.

astro-ph;0405154	center-to-limb variation of solar line profiles as a test of nlte line  formation calculations	we present new observations of the center-to-limb variation of spectral linesin the quiet sun. our long-slit spectra are corrected for scattered light,which amounts to 4-8 % of the continuum intensity, by comparison with a fouriertransform spectrum of the disk center. we examine the effect of inelasticcollisions with neutral hydrogen in nlte line formation calculations of theoxygen infrared triplet, and the na i 6160.8 a line. adopting a classicalone-dimensional theoretical model atmosphere, we find that the sodiumtransition, formed in higher layers, is much more effectively thermalized byhydrogen collisions than the high-excitation oxygen lines. this result appearsas a simple consequence of the decrease of the ratio nh/ne with depth in thesolar photosphere. the center-to-limb variation of the selected lines isstudied both under lte and nlte conditions. in the nlte analysis, inelasticcollisions with hydrogen atoms are considered with a simple approximation orneglected, in an attempt to test the validity of such approximation. for thesodium line studied, the best agreement between theory and observation happenswhen nlte is considered and inelastic collisions with hydrogen are neglected inthe rate equations. the analysis of the oxygen triplet benefits from a verydetailed calculation using an lte three-dimensional model atmosphere and nlteline formation. the chi**2 statistics favors including hydrogen collisions withthe approximation adopted, but the oxygen abundance derived in that case issignificantly higher than the value derived from oh infrared transitions.

astro-ph;0410681	line formation in solar granulation vi. [c i], c i, ch and c2 lines and  the photospheric c abundance	the solar photospheric carbon abundance has been determined from [c i], c i,ch vibration-rotation, ch a-x electronic and c2 swan electronic lines by meansof a time-dependent, 3d, hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere.departures from lte have been considered for the c i lines. these turned out tobe of increasing importance for stronger lines and are crucial to remove atrend in lte abundances with the strengths of the lines. very gratifyingagreement is found among all the atomic and molecular abundance diagnostics inspite of their widely different line formation sensitivities. the mean of thesolar carbon abundance based on the four primary abundance indicators ([c i], ci, ch vibration-rotation, c_2 swan) is log c = 8.39 +/- 0.05, including ourbest estimate of possible systematic errors. consistent results also come fromthe ch electronic lines, which we have relegated to a supporting role due totheir sensitivity to the line broadening. the new 3d based solar c abundance issignificantly lower than previously estimated in studies using 1d modelatmospheres.

astro-ph;0512290	oxygen abundances in metal-poor subgiants as determined from [o i], o i  and oh lines	the debate on the oxygen abundances of metal-poor stars has its origin incontradictory results obtained using different abundance indicators. to achievea better understanding of the problem we have acquired high quality spectrawith the ultraviolet and visual echelle spectrograph at vlt, with asignal-to-noise of the order of 100 in the near ultraviolet and 500 in theoptical and near infrared wavelength range. three different oxygen abundanceindicators, oh ultraviolet lines around 310.0 nm, the [oi] line at 630.03 nmand the oi lines at 777.1-5 nm were observed in the spectra of 13 metal-poorsubgiants with -3.0&lt;=[fe/h]&lt;=-1.5. oxygen abundances were obtained from theanalysis of these indicators which was carried out assuming local thermodynamicequilibrium and plane-parallel model atmospheres. abundances derived from oiwere corrected for departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium. stellarparameters were computed using teff-vs-color calibrations based on the infraredflux method and balmer line profiles, hipparcos parallaxes and feii lines.[o/fe] values derived from the forbidden line at 630.03 nm are consistent withan oxygen/iron ratio that varies linearly with [fe/h] as[o/fe]}=-0.09(+/-0.08)[fe/h]+0.36(+/-0.15). values based on the oi triplet areon average 0.19+/-0.22 dex(s.d.) higher than the values based on the forbiddenline while the agreement between oh ultraviolet lines and the forbidden line ismuch better with a mean difference of the order of -0.09+/-0.25 dex(s.d.). ingeneral, our results follow the same trend as previously published results withthe exception of the ones based on oh ultraviolet lines. in that case ourresults lie below the values which gave rise to the oxygen abundance debate formetal-poor stars.

0809.1377	carbon abundances of three carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars from  high-resolution gemini-s/bhros spectra of the 8727a [c i] line	we present the results from an analysis of the 8727ang forbidden [c i] linein high-resolution gemini-s/bhros spectra of three cemp stars. we find the[c/fe] ratios based on the [c i] abundances of the two most fe-rich stars inour sample (hip 0507-1653: [fe/h] = -1.42 and hip 0054-2542: [fe/h] = -2.66) tobe in good agreement with previously determined ch and c_2 line-based values.for the most fe-deficient star in our sample (hip 1005-1439: [fe/h] = -3.08),however, the [c/fe] ratio is found to be 0.34 dex lower than the publishedmolecular-based value. we have carried out 3d local thermodynamic equilibrium(lte) calculations for [c i], and the resulting corrections are found to bemodest for all three stars, suggesting that the discrepancy between the [c i]and molecular-based c abundances of hip 1005-1439 is due to more severe 3deffects on the molecular lines. carbon abundances are also derived from c ihigh-excitation lines and are found to be 0.45-0.64 dex higher than the [ci]-based abundances. previously published non-lte c i abundance correctionsbring the [c i] and c i abundances into better agreement; however, targetednlte calculations for cemp stars are clearly needed. we have also derived theabundances of n, k, and fe for each star. the fe abundances agree well withpreviously derived values, and the k abundances are similar to those ofc-normal metal-poor stars. nitrogen abundances have been derived from resolvedlines of the cn red system. the abundances are found to be approximately 0.44dex larger than literature values, which have been derived from cn blue bandsnear 3880 and 4215 ang. we discuss evidence that suggests that analyses of thecn blue system bands underestimate the n abundances of metal-poor giants.

astro-ph;0608284	the non-lte line formation of neutral carbon in late-type stars	we investigate the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-lte) lineformation of neutral carbon in late-type stars in order to remove some of thepotential systematic errors in stellar abundance analyses employing c ifeatures. the statistical equilibrium code multi was used on a grid ofplane-parallel 1d marcs atmospheric models. within the parameter spaceexplored, the high-excitation c i lines are stronger in non-lte due to thecombined effect of line source function drop and increased lower levelpopulation; the relative importance of the two effects depends on theparticular combination of teff, log g, [fe/h] and [c/fe] and on the analysed ci line. as a consequence, the non-lte abundance corrections are negative andcan be substantially so, for example ~-0.4 dex in halo turn-off stars at[fe/h]~-3. the magnitude of the non-lte corrections is rather insensitive towhether inelastic h collisions are included or not. our results haveimplications on studies of nucleosynthetic processes and on galactic chemicalevolution models. when applying our calculated corrections to recentobservational data, the upturn in [c/o] at low metallicity might still bepresent (thus apparently still necessitating contributions from massive pop.iii stars for the carbon production), but at a lower level and possibly with arather shallow trend of ~-0.2 dex/dex below [o/h]~-1

astro-ph;0611832	chemical homogeneity in collinder 261 and implications for chemical  tagging	this paper presents abundances for 12 red giants of the old open clustercollinder 261 based on spectra from vlt/uves. abundances were derived for na,mg, si, ca, mn, fe, ni, zr and ba. we find the cluster has a solar-levelmetallicity of [fe/h] = -0.03 dex. however some alpha elements were found to beenhanced. the star-to-star scatter was consistent with the expected measurementuncertainty for all elements. the observed rms scatter is as follows: na =0.07, mg = 0.05, si = 0.06, ca = 0.05, mn = 0.03, fe = 0.02, ni = 0.04, zr =0.12, and ba = 0.03 dex. the intrinsic scatter was estimated to be less than0.05 dex. such high levels of homogeneity indicate that chemical informationremains preserved in this old open cluster.  we use the chemical homogeneity we have now established in cr 261, hyades andthe hr1614 moving group to examine the uniqueness of the individual clusterabundance patterns, ie. chemical signatures. we demonstrate that the threestudied clusters have unique chemical signatures, and discuss how other suchsignatures may be searched for in the future. our findings support the prospectof chemically tagging disk stars to common formation sites in order to unravelthe dissipative history of the galactic disk.

astro-ph;0702689	sulphur and zinc abundances in galactic halo stars revisited	high resolution uves spectra of 40 main-sequence stars with -3.3 &lt; [fe/h] &lt;-1.0 are used to derive s, fe and zn abundances from lines in the 400 - 950 nmregion. for one star we also present novel observations of the si triplet at1.046 micron carried out with the eso vlt crires spectrograph. comparison ofsulphur abundances from the weak and strong si lines provides importantconstraints on non-lte effects. the high sulphur abundances reported by othersfor some metal-poor stars are not confirmed; instead, when taking non-lteeffects into account, the galactic halo stars distribute around a plateau at[s/fe] = +0.2 dex with a scatter of 0.07 dex only. this indicates that sulphurin galactic halo stars has been made by alpha-capture processes in massive sne.the observed scatter in s/fe is, however, much smaller than predicted fromcurrent stochastic models of the chemical evolution of the early galaxy,suggesting that either the models or the calculated yields of massive sneshould be revised. [zn/fe] is close to zero for metallicities in the range -2.0&lt; [fe/h] &lt; -1.0 but increases to a level of [zn/fe] = +0.15 dex in the range-2.7 &lt; [fe/h] &lt; -2.0. at still lower metallicities [zn/fe] rises steeply to avalue around [zn/fe] = +0.5 dex at [fe/h] = -3.2. we also examine the behaviourof s/zn and find that departures from the solar ratio are significantly reducedat all metallicities if non-lte corrections to the abundances of these twoelements are adopted. this effect, if confirmed, would reduce the usefulness ofthe s/zn ratio as a diagnostic of past star-formation activity, but would bringcloser together the values measured in damped lyman-alpha systems and ingalactic stars.

astro-ph;9801068	abundance similarities between the r crb star v854 cen and the  born-again sakurai's object	the elemental abundances of the mildly hydrogen-deficient r coronae borealis(r crb) star v854 cen have been estimated. the r crb stars have been dividedinto majority and minority classes judging by their abundance patterns. classassignment has previously been unambiguous but v854 cen has traits of both theminority and majority class. neither v854 cen nor the three obvious minoritymembers show any clear abundance signatures of having been affected by e.g.dust-gas separation as often observed in post-agb stars. by chemicalcomposition, v854 cen closely resembles sakurai's object, which has probablyrecently experienced a final he-shell flash. therefore v854 cen and sakurai'sobject may share the same evolutionary background, which would add support forthe final-flash scenario as a viable origin of the r crb stars. most of the fewdifferences in abundance ratios between the stars could if so be attributed tomilder h-ingestion in connection with the final he-shell flash of v854 cen. theidentification of either the majority or the minority group, if any, as finalflash objects, remain uncertain, however, due to the unclear membership statusof v854 cen.

astro-ph;9811208	the rapid evolution of the born-again giant sakurai's object	the extraordinarily rapid evolution of the born-again giant sakurai's objectcan be traced both in a continued cooling of the stellar surface and dramaticchanges in chemical composition on a timescale of a mere few months. theabundance alterations are the results of the mixing and nuclear reactions whichhave ensued due to the final he-shell flash which occurred during the descentalong the white dwarf cooling track. the observed changes in the h and liabundances can be explained by ingestion and burning of the h-rich envelope andli-production through the cameron-fowler mechanism. the rapidly increasingabundances of the light s-elements (including sc) is consistent with currents-processing by neutrons released from the concomitantly produced 13c. however,the possibility that the s-elements have previously been synthesized during theagb-phase and only mixed to the surface in connection with the final he-shellflash cannot be convincingly ruled out either. since sakurai's object showssubstantial abundance similarities with the r crb stars and has recentlyundergone rcrb-like visual fading events, the ``birth'' of an rcrb star mayhave been witnessed for the first time ever.

0810.0281	the c/o ratio at low metallicity: constraints on early chemical  evolution from observations of galactic halo stars	we present new measurements of the abundances of carbon and oxygen derivedfrom high-excitation c i and o i absorption lines in metal-poor halo stars,with the aim of clarifying the main sources of these two elements in the earlystages of the chemical enrichment of the galaxy. we target 15 new starscompared to our previous study, with an emphasis on additional c/odeterminations in the crucial metallicity range -3&lt;[fe/h]&lt;-2. departures fromlocal thermodynamic equilibrium were accounted for in the line formation forboth carbon and oxygen. the non-lte effects are very strong at the lowestmetallicities but, contrary to what has sometimes been assumed in the past dueto a simplified assessment, of different degrees for the two elements. inaddition, for the 28 stars with [fe/h]&lt;-1 previously analysed, stellarparameters were re-derived and non-lte corrections applied in the same fashionas for the rest of our sample, giving consistent abundances for 43 halo starsin total. the new observations and non-lte calculations strengthen previoussuggestions of an upturn in c/o towards lower metallicity (particularly for[o/h]&lt;-2). adopting the h collisional cross-sections estimated from theclassical drawin formula leads to [c/o]~0 at [o/h]~-3. to remove the upturn inc/o, near-lte formation for o i lines would be required, which could onlyhappen if the h collisional efficiency with the drawin recipe is underestimatedby factors of up to several tens of times, which we consider unlikely. the highc/o values derived at the lowest metallicities may be revealing thefingerprints of population iii stars or may signal rotationally-aidednucleosynthesis in more normal population ii stars.

0811.4586	the barium isotopic abundance in the metal-poor star hd140283	we derive the mixture of odd to even barium isotopes in the atmosphere of themetal-poor subgiant hd140283 from the analysis of the ba ii transition at 455.4nm in a high-resolution high signal-to-noise spectrum of the star. the detailedshape of this spectral line depends on the relative contributions of odd andeven isotopes via isotopic and hyperfine splitting. we measure the fractionalabundance of odd ba isotopes by modelling the formation of the ba ii 455.4 nmline profile with the use of both a classical 1d hydrostatic and a 3dhydrodynamical model atmosphere of hd140283. we interpret the results in termsof contributions by the slow (s-) and rapid (r-) neutron-capture processes tothe isotopic mix. while the result of the 1d analysis of the ba ii featureindicates a (64 +/- 36)% contribution of the r-process to the isotopic mix, the3d analysis points toward a mere (15 +/- 34)% contribution from this process,that is consistent with a solar-like mixture of barium isotopes.
