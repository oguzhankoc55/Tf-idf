0902.0384	evidence for a non-uniform initial mass function in the local universe	many results in modern astrophysics rest on the notion that the initial massfunction (imf) is universal. our observations of hi selected galaxies in thelight of h-alpha and the far-ultraviolet (fuv) challenge this notion. the fluxratio h-alpha/fuv from these two star formation tracers shows strongcorrelations with the surface-brightness in h-alpha and the r band: low surfacebrightness (lsb) galaxies have lower ratios compared to high surface brightnessgalaxies and to expectations from equilibrium star formation models usingcommonly favored imf parameters. weaker but significant correlations ofh-alpha/fuv with luminosity, rotational velocity and dynamical mass are foundas well as a systematic trend with morphology. the correlated variations ofh-alpha/fuv with other global parameters are thus part of the larger family ofgalaxy scaling relations. the h-alpha/fuv correlations can not be due to dustcorrection errors, while systematic variations in the star formation historycan not explain the trends with both h-alpha and r surface brightness. lsbgalaxies are unlikely to have a higher escape fraction of ionizing photonsconsidering their high gas fraction, and color-magnitude diagrams. the mostplausible explanation for the correlations are systematic variations of theupper mass limit and/or slope of the imf at the upper end. we outline ascenario of pressure driving the correlations by setting the efficiency of theformation of the dense star clusters where the highest mass stars form. ourresults imply that the star formation rate measured in a galaxy is highlysensitive to the tracer used in the measurement. a non-universal imf also callsinto question the interpretation of metal abundance patterns in dwarf galaxiesand star formation histories derived from color magnitude diagrams. abridged.

0910.1352	local lyman break galaxy analogs: the impact of massive star-forming  clumps on the interstellar medium and the global structure of young, forming  galaxies	we present hst uv/optical imaging, spitzer mid-ir photometry, and opticalspectroscopy of a sample of 30 low-redshift (z=0.1-0.3) galaxies chosen fromsdss/galex to be accurate local analogs of the high-z lyman break galaxies. thelyman break analogs (lbas) are similar in mass, metallicity, dust, sfr, sizeand gas velocity dispersion, thus enabling a detailed investigation ofprocesses that are important at high-z. the optical emission line properties oflbas are also similar to those of lbgs, indicating comparable conditions intheir ism. in the uv, lbas are characterized by complexes of massivestar-forming "clumps", while in the optical they most often show evidence for(post-)mergers/interactions. in 6 cases, we find an extremely massive (&gt;10^9msun) compact (r~100 pc) dominant central object (dco). the dcos arepreferentially found in lbas with the highest mid-ir luminosities andcorrespondingly high sfrs (15-100 msun/yr). we show that the massive sf clumps(including the dcos) have masses much larger than the nuclear super starclusters seen in normal late type galaxies. however, the dcos have masses,sizes, and densities similar to the excess-light/central-cusps seen in typicalelliptical galaxies with masses similar to the lba galaxies. we suggest thatthe dcos form in present-day examples of the dissipative mergers at highredshift that are believed to have produced the central-cusps in localellipticals. more generally, the properties of the lbas are consistent with theidea that instabilities in a gas-rich disk lead to very massive star-formingclumps that eventually coalesce to form a spheroid. we speculate that the dcosare too young at present to be growing a supermassive black hole because theyare still in a supernova-dominated outflow phase.

0707.3415	uv to ir seds of uv selected galaxies in the elais fields: evolution of  dust attenuation and star formation activity from z=0.7 to z=0.2	we study the ultraviolet to far-infrared (hereafter uv-to-ir) seds of asample of intermediate redshift (0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.7) uv-selected galaxies from theelais-n1 and elais-n2 fields by fitting a multi-wavelength dataset to a libraryof grasil templates. star formation related properties of the galaxies arederived from the library of models by using the bayesian statistics. we find adecreasing presence of galaxies with low attenuation and low total luminosityas redshift decreases, which does not hold for high total luminosity galaxies.in addition the dust attenuation of low mass galaxies increases as redshiftdecreases, and this trend seems to disappear for galaxies with m* &gt; 10^11m_sun. this result is consistent with a mass dependent evolution of the dust togas ratio, which could be driven by a mass dependent efficiency of starformation in star forming galaxies. the specific star formation rates (ssfr)decrease with increasing stellar mass at all redshifts, and for a given stellarmass the ssfr decreases with decreasing redshift. the differences in the slopeof the m*--ssfr relation found between this work and others at similar redshiftcould be explained by the adopted selection criteria of the samples which, fora uv selected sample, favours blue, star forming galaxies.

1006.5470	mid-infrared spectral measures of star-formation and agn activity in  normal galaxies	we investigate the use of mir pah bands, continuum and emission lines asprobes of star-formation and agn activity in a sample of 100 'normal' and local(z~0.1) emission-line galaxies. the mir spectra were obtained with the spitzerspace telescope infrared spectrograph (irs) as part of the spitzer-sdss-galexspectroscopic survey (ssgss) which includes multi-wavelength photometry fromthe uv to the fir and optical spectroscopy. the continuum and features wereextracted using pahfit (smith et al. 2007), a decomposition code which we findto yield pah equivalent widths up to ~30 times larger than the commonly usedspline methods. despite the lack of extreme objects in our sample (such asstrong agns, low metallicity galaxies or ulirgs), we find significantvariations in pah, continuum and emission line properties and systematic trendsbetween these mir properties and optically derived physical properties such asage, metallicity and radiation field hardness. we revisit the diagnosticdiagram relating pah equivalent widths and [ne ii]12.8micrometers/[oiv]25.9micrometers line ratios and find it to be in much better agreement withthe standard optical star-formation/agn classification than when splinedecompositions are used, while also potentially revealing obscured agns. theluminosity of individual pah components, of the continuum, and with poorerstatistics, of the neon emission lines and molecular hydrogen lines, are foundto be tightly correlated to the total ir luminosity, making individual mircomponents good gauges of the total dust emission in sf galaxies. like thetotal ir luminosity, these individual components can be used to estimate dustattenuation in the uv and in halpha lines based on energy balance arguments. wealso propose average scaling relations between these components and dustcorrected, halpha derived star-formation rates.

1007.4550	tightly correlated hi and fuv emission in the outskirts of m83	we compare sensitive hi data from the hi nearby galaxy survey (things) anddeep far uv (fuv) data from galex in the outer disk of m83. the fuv and hi mapsshow a stunning spatial correlation out to almost 4 optical radii (r25),roughly the extent of our maps. this underscores that hi traces the gasreservoir for outer disk star formation and it implies that massive (at leastlow level) star formation proceeds almost everywhere hi is observed. whereasthe average fuv intensity decreases steadily with increasing radius beforeleveling off at ~1.7 r25, the decline in hi surface density is more subtle. lowhi columns (&lt;2 m_solar/pc^2) contribute most of the mass in the outer disk,which is not the case within r25. the time for star formation to consume theavailable hi, inferred from the ratio of hi to fuv intensity, rises withincreasing radius before leveling off at ~100 gyr, i.e., many hubble times,near ~1.7 r25. assuming the relatively short h2 depletion times observed in theinner parts of galaxies hold in outer disks, the conversion of hi into bound,molecular clouds seems to limit star formation in outer galaxy disks. the longconsumption times suggest that most of the extended hi observed in m83 will notbe consumed by in situ star formation. however, even these low star formationrates are enough to expect moderate chemical enrichment in a closed outer disk.

1007.5260	herschel-atlas: counterparts from the uv--nir in the science  demonstration phase catalogue	we present a technique to identify optical counterparts of 250 um-selectedsources from the herschel-atlas survey. of the 6621 250 um &gt; 32 mjy sources inour science demonstration catalogue we find that ~60 percent have counterpartsbrighter than r=22.4 mag in the sloan digital sky survey. applying a likelihoodratio technique we are able to identify 2423 of the counterparts with areliability r &gt; 0.8. this is approximately 37 percent of the full 250 microncatalogue. we have estimated photometric redshifts for each of these 2423reliable counterparts, while 1099 also have spectroscopic redshifts collatedfrom several different sources, including the gama survey. we estimate thecompleteness of identifying counterparts as a function of redshift, and presentevidence that 250 um-selected herschel-atlas galaxies have a bimodal redshiftdistribution. those with reliable optical identifications have a redshiftdistribution peaking at z ~ 0.25 +/- 0.05, while sub-mm colours suggest that asignificant fraction with no counterpart above the r-band limit have z &gt; 1. wealso suggest a method for selecting populations of strongly-lensed highredshift galaxies. our identifications are matched to uv--nir photometry fromthe gama survey, and these data are available as part of the herschel-atlaspublic data release.

1008.0805	mid-infrared galaxy morphology from the spitzer survey of stellar  structure in galaxies (s^4g): the imprint of the de vaucouleurs revised  hubble-sandage classification system at 3.6 microns	spitzer space telescope infrared array camera (irac) imaging provides anopportunity to study all known morphological types of galaxies in the mid-ir ata depth significantly better than ground-based near-infrared and opticalimages. the goal of this study is to examine the imprint of the de vaucouleursclassification volume in the 3.6 micron band, which is the best spitzerwaveband for galactic stellar mass morphology owing to its depth and itsreddening-free sensitivity mainly to older stars. for this purpose, we haveprepared classification images for 207 galaxies from the spitzer archive, mostof which are formally part of the spitzer survey of stellar structure ingalaxies (s^4g), a spitzer post-cryogenic ("warm") mission exploration sciencelegacy program survey of 2,331 galaxies closer than 40 mpc. for the purposes ofmorphology, the galaxies are interpreted as if the images are {\it blue light},the historical waveband for classical galaxy classification studies. we findthat 3.6 micron classifications are well-correlated with blue-lightclassifications, to the point where the essential features of many galaxieslook very similar in the two very different wavelength regimes. drasticdifferences are found only for the most dusty galaxies. consistent with aprevious study by eskridge et al. (2002), the main difference between bluelight and mid-ir types is an approximately 1 stage interval difference for s0/ato sbc or sc galaxies, which tend to appear "earlier" in type at 3.6 micronsdue to the slightly increased prominence of the bulge, the reduced effects ofextinction, and the reduced (but not completely eliminated) effect of theextreme population i stellar component. we present an atlas of all of the 207galaxies analyzed here, and bring attention to special features or galaxy typesthat are particularly distinctive in the mid-ir.

1009.0616	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): dust obscuration in galaxies and their  recent star formation histories	we present self-consistent star formation rates derived through pan-spectralanalysis of galaxies drawn from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey. wedetermine the most appropriate form of dust obscuration correction viaapplication of a range of extinction laws drawn from the literature as appliedto halpha, [o{ii}] and uv luminosities. these corrections are applied to asample of 31,508 galaxies from the gama survey at z &lt; 0.35. we consider severaldifferent obscuration curves, including those of milky way, calzetti (2001) andfischera and dopita (2005) curves and their effects on the observedluminosities. at the core of this technique is the observed balmer decrement,and we provide a prescription to apply optimal obscuration corrections usingthe balmer decrement. we carry out an analysis of the star formation history(sfh) using stellar population synthesis tools to investigate the evolutionaryhistory of our sample of galaxies as well as to understand the effects ofvariation in the initial mass function (imf) and the effects this has on theevolutionary history of galaxies. we find that the fischera and dopita (2005)obscuration curve with an r_{v} value of 4.5 gives the best agreement betweenthe different sfr indicators. the 2200a feature needed to be removed from thiscurve to obtain complete consistency between all sfr indicators suggesting thatthis feature may not be common in the average integrated attenuation of galaxyemission. we also find that the uv dust obscuration is strongly dependent onthe sfr.

1103.3080	gama/h-atlas: the ultraviolet spectral slope and obscuration in galaxies	we use multiwavelength data from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) andherschel atlas (h-atlas) surveys to compare the relationship between variousdust obscuration measures in galaxies. we explore the connections between theultraviolet (uv) spectral slope, $\beta$, the balmer decrement, and the farinfrared (ir) to $150\,$nm far ultraviolet (fuv) luminosity ratio. we exploretrends with galaxy mass, star formation rate (sfr) and redshift in order toidentify possible systematics in these various measures. we reiterate thefinding of other authors that there is a large scatter between the balmerdecrement and the $\beta$ parameter, and that $\beta$ may be poorly constrainedwhen derived from only two broad passbands in the uv. we also emphasise thatfuv derived sfrs, corrected for dust obscuration using $\beta$, will beoverestimated unless a modified relation between $\beta$ and the attenuationfactor is used. even in the optimum case, the resulting sfrs have a significantscatter, well over an order of magnitude. while there is a stronger correlationbetween the ir to fuv luminosity ratio and $\beta$ parameter than with thebalmer decrement, neither of these correlations are particularly tight, anddust corrections based on $\beta$ for high redshift galaxy sfrs must be treatedwith caution. we conclude with a description of the extent to which thedifferent obscuration measures are consistent with each other as well as theeffects of including other galactic properties on these correlations.

1109.6274	h-atlas/gama: dusty early-type galaxies and passive spirals	we present the dust properties and star-formation histories of localsubmillimetre-selected galaxies in herschel-atlas, classified by opticalmorphology. the early-type galaxies (etgs) that are detected contain as muchdust as typical spirals, and form a unique sample that has been blindlyselected at submillimetre wavelengths.  comparing h-atlas galaxies to a control sample of optically selectedgalaxies, we find 5.5% of luminous etgs are detected in h-atlas. the h-atlasetgs contain a significant mass of cold dust: the mean dust mass is 5.5x10^7msun, with individual galaxies ranging from 9x10^5-4x10^8 msun. this iscomparable to that of spirals in our sample, and is an order of magnitude moredust than that found for the control etgs, which have a median dust massinferred from stacking of (0.8-4.0)x10^6 msun. the etgs detected in h-atlashave bluer nuv-r colours, higher specific star-formation rates and youngerstellar populations than etgs which are optically selected, and may betransitioning from the blue cloud to the red sequence. we also find thath-atlas and control etgs inhabit similar low-density environments. we concludethat the dust in h-atlas and control etgs cannot be solely from stellarsources, and a large contribution from dust formed in the ism or externalsources is required. alternatively, dust destruction may not be as efficient aspredicted.  we also explore the properties of the most passive spiral galaxies in oursample with ssfr&lt;10^-11/yr. we find these passive spirals have lowerdust-to-stellar mass ratios, higher stellar masses and older stellar populationages than normal spirals. the passive spirals inhabit low density environmentssimilar to those of the normal spiral galaxies in our sample. this shows thatthe processes which turn spirals passive do not occur solely in theintermediate density environments of group and cluster outskirts.

0710.3010	it's a wonderful tail: the mass loss history of mira	recent observations of the mira ab binary system have revealed a surroundingarc-like structure and a stream of material stretching 2 degrees away inopposition to the arc. the alignment of the proper motion vector and thearc-like structure shows the structures to be a bow shock and accompanyingtail. we have successfully hydrodynamically modelled the bow shock and tail asthe interaction between the asymptotic giant branch (agb) wind launched frommira a and the surrounding interstellar medium. our simulations show that thewake behind the bow shock is turbulent: this forms periodic density variationsin the tail similar to those observed. we investigate the possiblity ofmass-loss variations, but find that these have limited effect on the tailstructure. the tail is estimated to be approximately 450,000 years old, and ismoving with a velocity close to that of mira itself. we suggest that theduration of the high mass-loss phase on the agb may have been underestimated.finally, both the tail curvature and the rebrightening at large distance can bequalitatively understood if mira recently entered the local bubble. this isestimated to have occured 17 pc downstream from its current location.

1201.1916	herschel-atlas/gama: a census of dust in optically selected galaxies  from stacking at submillimetre wavelengths	we use the herschel-atlas survey to conduct the first large-scale statisticalstudy of the submm properties of optically selected galaxies. using ~80,000r-band selected galaxies from 126 deg^2 of the gama survey, we stack into submmimaging at 250, 350 and 500{\mu}m to gain unprecedented statistics on the dustemission from galaxies at z &lt; 0.35. we find that low redshift galaxies accountfor 5% of the cosmic 250{\mu}m background (4% at 350{\mu}m; 3% at 500{\mu}m),of which approximately 60% comes from 'blue' and 20% from 'red' galaxies(rest-frame g - r). we compare the dust properties of different galaxypopulations by dividing the sample into bins of optical luminosity, stellarmass, colour and redshift. in blue galaxies we find that dust temperature andluminosity correlate strongly with stellar mass at a fixed redshift, but redgalaxies do not follow these correlations and overall have lower luminositiesand temperatures. we make reasonable assumptions to account for thecontaminating flux from lensing by red sequence galaxies and conclude thatgalaxies with different optical colours have fundamentally different dustemission properties. results indicate that while blue galaxies are moreluminous than red galaxies due to higher temperatures, the dust masses of thetwo samples are relatively similar. dust mass is shown to correlate withstellar mass, although the dust/stellar mass ratio is much higher for lowstellar mass galaxies, consistent with the lowest mass galaxies having thehighest specific star formation rates. we stack the 250{\mu}m/nuv luminosityratio, finding results consistent with greater obscuration of star formation atlower stellar mass and higher redshift. submm luminosities and dust masses ofall galaxies are shown to evolve strongly with redshift, indicating a fall inthe amount of obscured star formation in ordinary galaxies over the last fourbillion years.

1209.0259	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the 0.013 &lt; z &lt; 0.1 cosmic spectral  energy distribution from 0.1 micron to 1mm	we use the gama i dataset combined with galex, sdss and ukidss imaging toconstruct the low-redshift (z&lt;0.1) galaxy luminosity functions in fuv, nuv,ugriz, and yjhk bands from within a single well constrained volume of 3.4 x10^5 (mpc/h)^{3}. the derived luminosity distributions are normalised to thesdss dr7 main survey to reduce the estimated cosmic variance to the 5 per centlevel. the data are used to construct the cosmic spectral energy distribution(csed) from 0.1 to 2.1 \mum free from any wavelength dependent cosmic variancefor both the elliptical and non-elliptical populations. the two populationsexhibit dramatically different cseds as expected for a predominantly old andyoung population respectively. using the driver et al. (2008) prescription forthe azimuthally averaged photon escape fraction, the non-ellipticals arecorrected for the impact of dust attenuation and the combined csed constructed.the final results show that the universe is currently generating (1.8 +/- 0.3)x 10^{35} h w mpc^{-3} of which (1.2 +/- 0.1) x 10^{35} h w mpc^{-3} isdirectly released into the inter-galactic medium and (0.6 +/- 0.1) x 10^{35} hw mpc^{-3} is reprocessed and reradiated by dust in the far-ir. using the gamadata and our dust model we predict the mid and far-ir emission which agreesremarkably well with available data. we therefore provide a robust descriptionof the pre- and post dust attenuated energy output of the nearby universe from0.1micron to 0.6mm. the largest uncertainty in this measurement lies in the midand far-ir bands stemming from the dust attenuation correction and itscurrently poorly constrained dependence on environment, stellar mass, andmorphology.

1302.1379	gama/h-atlas: the dust opacity - stellar mass surface density relation  for spiral galaxies	we report the discovery of a well-defined correlation between b-band face-oncentral optical depth due to dust, \tau^f_b, and the stellar mass surfacedensity, \mu_{*}, of nearby (z &lt; 0.13) spiral galaxies: log(\tau^f_b) =1.12(+-0.11)log(\mu_{*}/m_sol kpc^2)-8.6(+-0.8). this relation was derived froma sample of spiral galaxies taken from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)survey and detected in the fir/submm in the herschel-atlas survey. using aquantitative analysis of the nuv attenuation-inclination relation for completesamples of gama spirals categorized according to \mu_{*} we demonstrate thatthis correlation can be used to statistically correct for dust attenuationpurely on the basis of optical photometry and s'ersic-profile morphologicalfits. considered together with previously established empirical relationshipsbetween stellar mass, metallicity and gas mass, the near linearity and highconstant of proportionality of the \tau^f_b-\mu_{*} relation disfavors astellar origin for the bulk of refractory grains in spiral galaxies, insteadbeing consistent with the existence of a ubiquitous and very rapid mechanismfor the growth of dust in the ism. we use the \tau^f_b-\mu_{*} relation inconjunction with the radiation transfer model for spiral galaxies of popescu &amp;tuffs (2011) to derive intrinsic scaling relations between specific starformation rate (ssfr), stellar mass, and \mu_{*}, in which the attenuation ofthe uv light used to measure the sfr is corrected on an object-to-object basis.a marked reduction in scatter in these relations is achieved which isdemonstrably due to correction of both the inclination-dependent and face-oncomponents of attenuation. our results are consistent with a picture of spiralgalaxies in which most of the submm emission originates from grains residing intranslucent structures, exposed to uv in the diffuse interstellar radiationfield.

1302.4276	gama/h-atlas: linking the properties of sub-mm detected and undetected  early-type galaxies: i. z$\le$0.06 sample	we present two large, nearby (0.013$\le$z$\le$0.06) samples of early-typegalaxies (etgs): a visually classified sample of 220 etgs, created usingsource-matched data from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) database withfir/sub-mm detections from $herschel$-atlas; and a visually classified sampleof 551 etgs which are undetected with $herschel$-atlas. active galactic nuclei(agn) are removed from our samples using optical emission line diagnostics.these samples are scrutinised to determine characteristics of sub-mm detectedversus undetected etgs. we find similarities in the stellar mass distributionsof the two etg samples but testing other properties uncovers significantdifferences. the sub-mm detected sample is shown to have lower concentrationand s\'ersic indices than those in the undetected sample - a result which maybe linked to the presence of dust in the former. optical and uv-optical coloursare also shown to be much bluer, indicating that the dust is linked with recentstar formation. the intrinsic effective radii are on average 1.5 times largerfor the sub-mm detected etgs. surface densities and groups data from the gamadatabase are examined for the two samples, leading to the conclusion that dustyetgs inhabit sparser environments than non-dusty etgs in the nearby universe,although environments of the brightest etgs are shown to differ the least.modified planck functions are fit to the h-atlas detected pacs and spire fluxesfor etgs with sub-mm flux densities of at least 3$\sigma$ in the 350$\mu$mspire band, giving a resultant mean cold dust temperature of t$_{d}$=22.1k,with a range of 9-30k. the corresponding mean dust mass is1.8$\times10^{7}$m$_{\odot}$, with a range of(0.08-35.0)$\times10^{7}$m$_{\odot}$. the dust masses calculated from thesefits, normalised by stellar mass, are shown to increase with decreasing stellarmass and bluer colours.

0712.4149	uv/optical detections of candidate tidal disruption events by galex and  cfhtls	we present two luminous uv/optical flares from the nuclei of apparentlyinactive early-type galaxies at z=0.37 and 0.33 that have the radiativeproperties of a flare from the tidal disruption of a star. in this paper wereport the second candidate tidal disruption event discovery in the uv by thegalex deep imaging survey, and present simultaneous optical light curves fromthe cfhtls deep imaging survey for both uv flares. the first few months of theuv/optical light curves are well fitted with the canonical t^(-5/3) power-lawdecay predicted for emission from the fallback of debris from a tidallydisrupted star. chandra acis x-ray observations during the flares detect softx-ray sources with t_bb= (2-5) x 10^5 k or gamma &gt; 3 and place limits on hardx-ray emission from an underlying agn down to l_x (2-10 kev) &lt;~ 10^41 ergs/s.blackbody fits to the uv/optical spectral energy distributions of the flaresindicate peak flare luminosities of &gt; 10^44-10^45 ergs/s. the temperature,luminosity, and light curves of both flares are in excellent agreement withemission from a tidally disrupted main sequence star onto a central black holeof several times 10^7 msun. the observed detection rate of our search over ~2.9 deg^2 of galex deep imaging survey data spanning from 2003 to 2007 isconsistent with tidal disruption rates calculated from dynamical models, and weuse these models to make predictions for the detection rates of the nextgeneration of optical synoptic surveys.

1304.6083	the impact of bars on disk breaks as probed by s4g imaging	we have analyzed the radial distribution of old stars in a sample of 218nearby face-on disks, using deep 3.6um images from the spitzer survey ofstellar structure in galaxies (s4g). in particular, we have studied thestructural properties of those disks with a broken or down-bending profile. wefind that, on average, disks with a genuine single exponential profile have ascale-length and a central surface brightness which are intermediate to thoseof the inner and outer components of a down-bending disk with the same totalstellar mass. in the case of barred galaxies, the ratio between the break andthe bar radii (rbr/rbar) depends strongly on the total stellar mass of thegalaxy. for galaxies more massive than 10^10 msun, the distribution is bimodal,peaking at rbr/rbar~2 and ~3.5. the first peak, which is the most populatedone, is linked to the outer lindblad resonance of the bar, whereas the secondone is consistent with a dynamical coupling between the bar and the spiralpattern. for galaxies below 10^10 msun, breaks are found up to ~10 rbar, but weshow that they could still be caused by resonances given the rising nature ofrotation curves in these low-mass disks. while not ruling out star formationthresholds, our results imply that radial stellar migration induced bynon-axysymmetric features can be responsible not only for those breaks at 2rbar, but also for many of those found at larger radii.

1309.1444	morphological parameters of spitzer survey of stellar structure in  galaxies (s4g)	the morphology of galaxies can be quantified to some degree using a set ofscale-invariant parameters. concentration (c), asymmetry (a), smoothness (s),the gini index (g), relative contribution of the brightest pixels to the secondorder moment of the flux (m20), ellipticity (e), and the gini index of thesecond order moment (gm) have all been applied to morphologically classifygalaxies at various wavelengths. here we present a catalog of these parametersfor the spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies (s4g), a volume-limitednear-infrared imaging survey of nearby galaxies using the 3.6 and 4.5 micronchannels of the irac camera. our goal is to provide a reference catalog ofnear-infrared quantified morphology for high-redshift studies and galaxyevolution models with enough detail to resolve stellar mass morphology.  we explore where normal, non-interacting galaxies -those typically found onthe hubble tuning fork- lie in this parameter space and show that there is atight relation between concentration and m20 for normal galaxies. m20 can beused to classify galaxies into earlier and later types (e.g., to separatespirals from irregulars). several criteria using these parameters exist toselect systems with a disturbed morphology, i.e., those that appear to beundergoing a tidal interaction. we examine the applicability of these criteriato spitzer near-infrared imaging. we find that four relations, based on theparameters a&amp;s, g&amp;m20, gm, and c&amp;m20, respectively, select outliers in themorphological parameter space, but each selects different subsets of galaxies.two criteria (gm &gt; 0.6, g &gt; -0.115 x m20 + 0.384) seem most appropriate toidentify possible mergers and the merger fraction in near-infrared surveys. wefind no strong relation between lopsidedness and most of these morphologicalparameters, except for a weak dependence of lopsidedness on concentration andm20.

1311.4725	non-parametric cell-based photometric proxies for galaxy morphology:  methodology and application to the morphologically-defined star formation --  stellar mass relation of spiral galaxies in the local universe	(abridged) we present a non-parametric cell-based method of selecting highlypure and largely complete samples of spiral galaxies using photometric andstructural parameters as provided by standard photometric pipelines and simpleshape fitting algorithms, demonstrably superior to commonly used proxies.furthermore, we find structural parameters derived using passbands longwards ofthe $g$ band and linked to older stellar populations, especially the stellarmass surface density $\mu_*$ and the $r$ band effective radius $r_e$, toperform at least equally well as parameters more traditionally linked to theidentification of spirals by means of their young stellar populations. inparticular the distinct bimodality in the parameter $\mu_*$, consistent withexpectations of different evolutionary paths for spirals and ellipticals,represents an often overlooked yet powerful parameter in differentiatingbetween spiral and non-spiral/elliptical galaxies. we investigate the intrinsicspecific star-formation rate - stellar mass relation ($\psi_* - m_*$) for amorphologically defined volume limited sample of local universe spiralgalaxies, defined using the cell-based method with an appropriate parametercombination. the relation is found to be well described by $\psi_* \proptom_*^{-0.5}$ over the range of $10^{9.5} m_{\odot} \le m_* \le 10^{11}m_{\odot}$ with a mean interquartile range of $0.4\,$dex. this is somewhatsteeper than previous determinations based on colour-selected samples ofstar-forming galaxies, primarily due to the inclusion in the sample of redquiescent disks.

1312.0866	arrakis: atlas of resonance rings as known in the s4g	resonance rings are the consequence of secular evolution processes thatredistribute material and angular momentum in discs. we produced a catalogueand an atlas of the rings detected in the spitzer survey of stellar structurein galaxies (s4g) and to conduct a statistical study of the data in thecatalogue.  we traced the contours of rings previously identified by buta et al. (inpreparation) and fitted them with ellipses. we found the orientation of bars bystudying the galaxy ellipse fits from s4g's pipeline 4. we used the galaxyorientation data obtained by s4g's pipeline 4 to obtain intrinsic ellipticitiesand orientations of rings and the bars.  arrakis contains data on 724 ringed galaxies in the s4g. the frequency ofresonance rings in the s4g is of 16+-1% and 35+-1% for outer and innerfeatures, respectively. outer rings are mostly found in hubble stages -1&lt;=t&lt;=4.inner rings are found in a distribution that covers the range -1&lt;=t&lt;=7. weconfirm that outer rings have two preferred orientations, parallel andperpendicular to the bar. we confirm a tendency for inner rings to be orientedparallel to the bar, but we find that a significant fraction (~50%) of themhave random orientations with respect to the bar. these misaligned inner ringsare mostly found in late-type galaxies (t&gt;=4). this may be due to spiral modesdecoupled from the bar dominating the fourier amplitude spectrum at the radiusof the inner ring.  we find that the fraction of barred galaxies hosting outer (inner) rings is~1.7 times (~1.3 times) that in unbarred galaxies. the fact that rings are onlymildly favoured by bars suggests that those in unbarred galaxies either formeddue to weak departures from the axisymmetry of the galactic potential or thatthey are born because of bars that have been destroyed after the ringformation.

1402.5210	reconstructing the stellar mass distributions of galaxies using s4g irac  3.6 and 4.5 micron images: ii. the conversion from light to mass	we present a new approach for estimating the 3.6 micron stellar mass-to-lightratio in terms of the [3.6]-[4.5] colors of old stellar populations. ourapproach avoids several of the largest sources of uncertainty in existingtechniques. by focusing on mid-ir wavelengths, we gain a virtually dustextinction-free tracer of the old stars, avoiding the need to adopt a dustmodel to correctly interpret optical or optical/nir colors normally leveragedto assign m/l. by calibrating a new relation between nir and mid-ir colors ofglimpse giant stars we also avoid discrepancies in model predictions for the[3.6]-[4.5] colors of old stellar populations due to uncertainties in molecularline opacities. we find that the [3.6]-[4.5] color, which is driven primarilyby metallicity, provides a tight constraint on m/l_3.6, which variesintrinsically less than at optical wavelengths. the uncertainty on m/l_3.6 of~0.07 dex due to unconstrained age variations marks a significant improvementon existing techniques for estimating the stellar m/l with shorter wavelengthdata. a single m/l_3.6=0.6 (assuming a chabrier imf), independent of[3.6]-[4.5] color, is also feasible as it can be applied simultaneously to old,metal-rich and young, metal-poor populations, and still with comparable (orbetter) accuracy (~0.1 dex) as alternatives. we expect our m/l_3.6 to beoptimal for mapping the stellar mass distributions in s4g galaxies, for whichwe have developed an independent component analysis technique to first isolatethe old stellar light at 3.6 micron from non-stellar emission (e.g. hot dustand the 3.3 pah feature). our estimate can also be used to determine thefractional contribution of non-stellar emission to global (rest-frame) 3.6micron fluxes, e.g. in wise imaging, and establishes a reliable basis forexploring variations in the stellar imf.

1402.6315	the baryonic tully-fisher relationship for s$^4$g galaxies and the  "condensed" baryon fraction of galaxies	we combine data from the spitzer survey for stellar structure in galaxies(s$^4$g), a recently calibrated empirical stellar mass estimator from eskew etal., and an extensive database of hi spectral line profiles to examine thebaryonic tully-fisher (btf) relation. we find 1) that the btf has lower scatterthan the classic tully-fisher (tf) relation and is better described as a linearrelationship, confirming similar previous results, 2) that the inclusion of aradial scale in the btf decreases the scatter but only modestly, as seenpreviously for the tf relation, and 3) that the slope of the btf, which we findto be $3.5\pm 0.2$ ($\delta$ log $m_{baryon}/\delta$ log $v_c$), implies thaton average a nearly constant fraction ($\sim 0.4$) of all baryons expected tobe in a halo are "condensed" onto the central region of rotationally supportedgalaxies. the condensed baryon fraction, $m_{baryon}/m_{total}$, is, to ourmeasurement precision, nearly independent of galaxy circular velocity (oursample spans circular velocities, $v_c$, between 60 and 250 km s$^{-1}$, but isextended to $v_c\sim 10$ km s$^{-1}$ using data from the literature). theobserved galaxy-to-galaxy scatter in this fraction is generally $\le$ a factorof 2 despite fairly liberal selection criteria. these results imply thatcooling and heating processes, such as cold vs. hot accretion, mass loss due tostellar winds, and agn driven feedback, to the degree that they affect theglobal galactic properties involved in the btf, are independent of halo massfor galaxies with $10 &lt; v_c &lt; 250$ km/s and typically introduce no more than afactor of two range in the resulting $m_{baryon}/m_{total}$. recent simulationsby aumer et al. of a small sample of disk galaxies are in excellent agreementwith our data, suggesting that current simulations are capable of reproducingthe global properties of individual disk galaxies.

1404.0559	morphology and environment of galaxies with disc breaks in the s4g and  nirs0s	we study the surface brightness profiles of disc galaxies in the 3.6 micronimages from the spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies (s4g) andk_s-band images from the near infrared s0-sa galaxy survey (nirs0s). weparticularly connect properties of single exponential (type i), downbendingdouble exponential (type ii), and upbending double exponential (type iii) discprofile types, to structural components of galaxies by using detailedmorphological classifications, and size measurements of rings and lenses. wealso study how the local environment of the galaxies affects the profile typesby calculating parameters describing the environmental density and the tidalinteraction strength. we find that in majority of type ii profiles the breakradius is connected with structural components such as rings, lenses, andspirals. the exponential disc sections of all three profile types, whenconsidered separately, follow the disc scaling relations. however, the outerdiscs of type ii, and the inner discs of type iii, are similar in scalelengthto the single exponential discs. although the different profile types havesimilar mean environmental parameters, the scalelengths of the type iiiprofiles show a positive correlation with the tidal interaction strength.

1410.0009	the spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies (s$^4$g): precise  stellar mass distributions from automated dust correction at 3.6 microns	the mid-infrared is an optimal window to trace stellar mass in nearbygalaxies and the 3.6$\mu m$ irac band has been exploited to this effect, butsuch mass estimates can be biased by dust emission. we present our pipeline toreveal the old stellar flux at 3.6$\mu m$ and obtain stellar mass maps for morethan 1600 galaxies available from the spitzer survey of stellar structure ingalaxies (s$^{4}$g). this survey consists of images in two infrared bands (3.6and 4.5$\mu m$), and we use the independent component analysis (ica) methodpresented in meidt et al. (2012) to separate the dominant light from old starsand the dust emission that can significantly contribute to the observed 3.6$\mum$ flux. we exclude from our ica analysis galaxies with low signal-to-noiseratio (s/n &lt; 10) and those with original [3.6]-[4.5] colors compatible with anold stellar population, indicative of little dust emission (mostly early hubbletypes, which can directly provide good mass maps). for the remaining 1251galaxies to which ica was successfully applied, we find that as much as 10-30%of the total light at 3.6$\mu m$ typically originates from dust, and locally itcan reach even higher values. this contamination fraction shows a correlationwith specific star formation rates, confirming that the dust emission that wedetect is related to star formation. additionally, we have used our largesample of mass estimates to calibrate a relationship of effective mass-to-lightratio ($m/l$) as a function of observed [3.6]-[4.5] color: $\log(m/l)=-0.339(\pm 0.057) \times ([3.6]-[4.5]) -0.336 (\pm 0.002)$. our final pipelineproducts have been made public through irsa, providing the astronomicalcommunity with an unprecedentedly large set of stellar mass maps ready to usefor scientific applications.

1511.08018	h-atlas/gama: the nature and characteristics of optically red galaxies  detected at submillimetre wavelengths	we combine herschel/spire sub-millimeter (submm) observations with existingmulti-wavelength data to investigate the characteristics of low redshift,optically red galaxies detected in submm bands. we select a sample of galaxiesin the redshift range 0.01$\leq$z$\leq$0.2, having &gt;5$\sigma$ detections in thespire 250 micron submm waveband. sources are then divided into two sub-samplesof $red$ and $blue$ galaxies, based on their uv-optical colours. galaxies inthe $red$ sample account for $\approx$4.2 per cent of the total number ofsources with stellar masses m$_{*}\gtrsim$10$^{10}$ solar-mass. followingvisual classification of the $red$ galaxies, we find that $\gtrsim$30 per centof them are early-type galaxies and $\gtrsim$40 per cent are spirals. thecolour of the $red$-spiral galaxies could be the result of their highlyinclined orientation and/or a strong contribution of the old stellarpopulation.  it is found that irrespective of their morphological types, $red$ and $blue$sources occupy environments with more or less similar densities (i.e., the$\sigma_5$ parameter). from the analysis of the spectral energy distributions(seds) of galaxies in our samples based on magphys, we find that galaxies inthe $red$ sample (of any morphological type) have dust masses similar to thosein the $blue$ sample (i.e. normal spiral/star-forming systems). however, incomparison to the $red$-spirals and in particular $blue$ systems,$red$-ellipticals have lower mean dust-to-stellar mass ratios. besides galaxiesin the $red$-elliptical sample have much lower meanstar-formation/specific-star-formation rates in contrast to their counterpartsin the $blue$ sample. our results support a scenario where dust in early-typesystems is likely to be of an external origin.

astro-ph;0405537	the origin of the mass--metallicity relation: insights from 53,000  star-forming galaxies in the sdss	we utilize sloan digital sky survey imaging and spectroscopy of ~53,000star-forming galaxies at z~0.1 to study the relation between stellar mass andgas-phase metallicity. we derive gas-phase oxygen abundances and stellar massesusing new techniques which make use of the latest stellar evolutionarysynthesis and photoionization models. we find a tight (+/-0.1 dex) correlationbetween stellar mass and metallicity spanning over 3 orders of magnitude instellar mass and a factor of 10 in metallicity. the relation is relativelysteep from 10^{8.5} - 10^{10.5} m_sun, in good accord with known trends betweenluminosity and metallicity, but flattens above 10^{10.5} m_sun. we use indirectestimates of the gas mass based on the h-alpha luminosity to compare our datato predictions from simple closed box chemical evolution models. we show thatmetal loss is strongly anti-correlated with baryonic mass, with low mass dwarfgalaxies being 5 times more metal-depleted than l* galaxies at z~0.1. evidencefor metal depletion is not confined to dwarf galaxies, but is found in galaxieswith masses as high as 10^{10} m_sun. we interpret this as strong evidence bothof the ubiquity of galactic winds and of their effectiveness in removing metalsfrom galaxy potential wells.

astro-ph;0411309	galex observations of the ultraviolet halos of ngc 253 and m82	we present galaxy evolution explorer (galex) images of the prototypicaledge-on starburst galaxies m82 and ngc253. our initial analysis is restrictedto the complex of ultraviolet (uv) filaments in the starburst-driven outflowsin the galaxy halos. the uv luminosities in the halo are too high to beprovided by shock-heated or photoionized gas except perhaps in the brightestfilaments in m82, suggesting that most of the uv light is the stellar continuumof the starburst scattered into our line of sight by dust in the outflow. thisinterpretation agrees with previous results from optical imaging polarimetry inm82. the morphology of the uv filaments in both galaxies shows a high degree ofspatial correlation with h-alpha and x-ray emission. this indicates that theseoutflows contain cold gas and dust, some of which may be vented into theintergalactic medium (igm). uv light is seen in the ``h-alpha cap'' 11 kpcnorth of m82. if this cap is a result of the wind fluid running into apre-existing gas cloud, the gas cloud contains dust and is not primordial innature but was probably stripped from m82 or m81. if starburst windsefficiently expel dust into the igm, this could have significant consequencesfor the observation of cosmologically distant objects.

astro-ph;0411343	dust attenuation in the nearby universe: comparison between galaxies  selected in the ultraviolet or in the infrared	we compare the dust attenuation properties of two samples of galaxies purelyselected in the near-ultraviolet (nuv) band (1750-2750 a, lambda_m = 2310 a)and in the far-infrared (fir) at 60micron. these samples are built using thegalex and iras sky surveys over ~600 square degrees. the nuv selected samplecontains 95 galaxies detected down to nuv=16mag (ab system). 83 galaxies inthis sample are spirals or irregulars and only two of them are not detected at60micron. the fir selected sample is built from the iras pscz catalog completedown to 0.6jy. among the 163 sources, we select 118 star forming galaxies wellmeasured by iras, all but 1 are detected in nuv and 14 galaxies are notdetected in the far-ultraviolet (fuv) band (1350-1750 a, lambda_m = 1530 a).the dust to ultraviolet (nuv and fuv) flux ratio is calibrated to estimate thedust attenuation at both wavelengths. the median value of the attenuation innuv is found to be ~1 mag for the nuv selected sample versus ~2 mag for the firselected one. within both samples, the dust attenuation is found to correlatewith the luminosity of the galaxies. almost all the nuv selected galaxies and2/3 of the fir selected sample exhibit a lower dust attenuation than thatexpected from the tight relation found previously for starburst galaxiesbetween the dust attenuation and the slope of the ultraviolet continuum. thesituation is inverse for one third of the fir selected galaxies: theirextinction is higher than that deduced from their fuv-nuv color and therelation valid for starbursts.

astro-ph;0411354	new constraints on the star formation histories and dust attenuation of  galaxies in the local universe from galex	we derive a variety of physical parameters including star formation rates(sfrs), dust attenuation and burst mass fractions for 6472 galaxies observed bythe galaxy evolution explorer (galex) and present in the sdss dr1 mainspectroscopic sample. parameters are estimated in a statistical way bycomparing each observed broad-band sed (two galex and five sdss bands) with anextensive library of model galaxy seds, which cover a wide range of starformation histories and include stochastic starbursts. we compare theconstraints derived using sdss bands only with those derived using thecombination of sdss and galex photometry. we find that the addition of thegalex bands leads to significant improvement in the estimation of both the dustoptical depth and the star formation rate over timescales of 100 myr to 1 gyrin a galaxy. we are sensitive to sfrs as low as 10^{-3} m_sun/yr, and we findthat low levels of star formation (sf) are mostly associated with early-type,red galaxies. the least massive galaxies have ratios of current topast-averaged sf rates (b-parameter) consistent with constant sf over a hubbletime. for late-type galaxies, this ratio on average decreases with mass. wefind that b correlates tightly with nuv-r color, implying that the sf historyof a galaxy can be constrained on the basis of the nuv-r color alone. thefraction of galaxies that have undergone a significant starburst episode withinthe last 1 gyr steeply declines with mass-from ~20% for galaxies with ~10^8m_sun to ~5% for ~10^11 m_sun galaxies.

astro-ph;0411372	uv emission from stellar populations within tidal tails: catching the  youngest galaxies in formation?	new galex observations have detected significant fuv (1530 angstroms) and nuv(2310 angstroms) emission from stellar substructures within the tidal tails offour ongoing galaxy mergers. the uv-bright regions are optically faint and arecoincident with hi density enhancements. fuv emission is detected at anylocation where the hi surface density exceeds ~2 m_sun pc^{-2}, and is oftendetected in the absence of visible wavelength emission. uv luminosities of thebrighter regions of the tidal tails imply masses of 10^6 m_sun to ~10^9 m_sunin young stars in the tails, and hi luminosities imply similar hi masses.uv-optical colors of the tidal tails indicate stellar populations as young as afew myr, and in all cases ages &lt; 400myr. most of the young stars in the tailsformed in single bursts rather than resulting from continuous star formation,and they formed *in situ* as the tails evolved. star formation appears to beolder near the parent galaxies and younger at increasing distances from theparent galaxy. this could be because the star formation occurs progressivelyalong the tails, or because the star formation has been inhibited near thegalaxy/tail interface. the youngest stellar concentrations, usually near theends of long tidal tails, have masses comparable to confirmed tidal dwarfgalaxies and may be newly forming galaxies undergoing their first burst of starformation.

astro-ph;0506332	extinction law variations and dust excitation in the spiral galaxy ngc  300	we investigate the origin of the strong radial gradient in theultraviolet-to-infrared ratio in the spiral galaxy ngc 300, and emphasize theimportance of local variations in the interstellar medium geometry, concludingthat they cannot be neglected with respect to metallicity effects. thisanalysis is based upon a combination of maps from galex and spitzer, and fromthe ground (ubvri, halpha and hbeta). we select ionizing stellar clustersassociated with hii regions of widely varying morphologies, and derive theirfundamental parameters from population synthesis fitting of their spectralenergy distributions, measured to eliminate local backgrounds accurately. fromthese fits, we conclude that the stellar extinction law is highly variable inthe line of sight of young clusters of similar ages. in the particular modelgeometry that we consider most appropriate to the sampled regions, we checkedthat our findings are not significantly altered by the correct treatment ofradiative transfer effects. the variations are systematic in nature: extinctionlaws of the milky way or lmc type are associated with compact hii regions (thecompacity being quantified in two different ways), while clusters surrounded bydiffuse hii regions follow extinction laws of the 30 doradus or smc type. thecalzetti starburst attenuation law, although most often degenerate with the 30doradus extinction law, overpredicts ionizing photon fluxes by large amounts.we also find that the extinction law variations are correlated with the columndensity of dust species emitting in the near- and mid-infrared. finally, webriefly discuss the nebular to stellar extinction ratios, and the excitation ofaromatic band carriers, invalidating their claimed association with cold dust.

astro-ph;0507169	uv properties of early-type galaxies in the virgo cluster	we study the uv properties of a volume limited sample of early-type galaxiesin the virgo cluster combining new galex far- (1530 a) and near-ultraviolet(2310 a) data with spectro-photometric data available at other wavelengths. thesample includes 264 ellipticals, lenticulars and dwarfs spanning a large rangein luminosity (m(b)&lt;-15). while the nuv to optical or near-ir color magnituderelations (cmr) are similar to those observed at optical wavelengths, with amonotonic reddening of the color index with increasing luminosity, the (fuv-v)and (fuv-h) cmrs show a discontinuity between massive and dwarf objects. aneven more pronounced dichotomy is observed in the (fuv-nuv) cmr. forellipticals the (fuv-nuv) color becomes bluer with increasing luminosity andwith increasing reddening of the optical or near-ir color indices. for thedwarfs the opposite trend is observed. these observational evidences areconsistent with the idea that the uv emission is dominated by hot, evolvedstars in giant systems, while in dwarf ellipticals residual star formationactivity is more common.

astro-ph;0510165	uv dust attenuation in normal star forming galaxies: i. estimating the  l_tir/l_fuv ratio	we analyze the dust attenuation properties of a volume-limited,optically-selected sample of normal star forming galaxies in nearby clusters asobserved by galex. the internal attenuation is estimated using threeindependent indicators, namely: the ratio of the total infrared tofar-ultraviolet emission, the ultraviolet spectral slope beta and the balmerdecrement. we confirm that normal galaxies follow a l_tir/l_fuv-beta relationoffset from the one observed for starburst galaxies. this offset is found toweakly correlate with the birthrate parameter, thus with the galaxy starformation history. we study the correlations of dust attenuation with otherglobal properties, such as the metallicity, dynamical mass, ionized gasattenuation, halpha emission and mass surface density. metal-rich, massivegalaxies are, as expected, more heavily extinguished in the uv than are smallsystems. for the same gas metallicity normal galaxies have lower l_tir/l_fuvratio than starbursts, in agreement with the difference observed in thel_tir/l_fuv-beta relation. unexpectedly we find however that normal starforming galaxies follow exactly the same relationship between metallicity andultraviolet spectral slope beta determined for starbursts, complicating ourunderstanding of dust properties. this result might indicate a different dustgeometry between normal galaxies and starbursts, but it could also be due toaperture effects eventually present in the iue starbursts dataset. the presentmultiwavelength study allows us to provide some empirical relations from whichthe total infrared to far ultraviolet ratio (l_tir/l_fuv) can be estimated whenfar infrared data are absent.

astro-ph;0601029	uv-optical colours as probes of early-type galaxy evolution	we have studied ~2100 early-type galaxies in the sdss dr3 which have beendetected by the galex medium imaging survey (mis), in the redshift range 0 &lt; z&lt; 0.11. combining galex uv photometry with corollary optical data from thesdss, we find that, at a 95 percent confidence level, at least ~30 percent ofgalaxies in this sample have uv to optical colours consistent with some recentstar formation within the last gyr. in particular, galaxies with a nuv - rcolour less than 5.5 are very likely to have experienced such recent starformation, taking into account the possibility of a contribution to nuv fluxfrom the uv upturn phenomenon. we find quantitative agreement between theobservations and the predictions of a semi-analytical lcdm hierarchical mergermodel and deduce that early-type galaxies in the redshift range 0 &lt; z &lt; 0.11have ~1 to 3 percent of their stellar mass in stars less than 1 gyr old. theaverage age of this recently formed population is ~300 to 500 myrs. we alsofind that monolithically evolving galaxies, where recent star formation can bedriven solely by recycled gas from stellar mass loss, cannot exhibit the bluecolours (nuv - r &lt; 5.5) seen in a significant fraction (~30 percent) of ourobserved sample.

astro-ph;0601036	the effect of environment on the uv colour-magnitude relation of  early-type galaxies	we use \textit{galex} (galaxy evolution explorer) near-uv (nuv) photometry ofa sample of early-type galaxies selected in \textit{sdss} (sloan digital skysurvey) to study the uv color-magnitude relation (cmr). $nuv-r$ color is anexcellent tracer of even small amounts ($\sim 1$% mass fraction) of recent($\la 1$ gyr) star formation and so the $nuv-r$ cmr allows us to study theeffect of environment on the recent star formation history. we analyze avolume-limited sample of 839 visually-inspected early-type galaxies in theredshift range $0.05 &lt; z &lt; 0.10$ brighter than $m_{r}$ of -21.5 with anypossible emission-line or radio-selected agn removed to avoid contamination. wefind that contamination by agn candidates and late-type interlopers highly biasany study of recent star formation in early-type galaxies and that, afterremoving those, our lower limit to the fraction of massive early-type galaxiesshowing signs of recent star formation is roughly $30 \pm 3%$ this suggeststhat residual star formation is common even amongst the present day early-typegalaxy population.  we find that the fraction of uv-bright early-type galaxies is 25% higher inlow-density environments. however, the density effect is clear only in thelowest density bin. the blue galaxy fraction for the subsample of the brightestearly-type galaxies however shows a very strong density dependence, in thesense that the blue galaxy fraction is lower in a higher density region.

astro-ph;0601235	star formation in the nearby universe: the ultraviolet and infrared  points of view	this work presents the main ultraviolet (uv) and far-infrared (fir)properties of two samples of nearby galaxies selected from the galex ($\lambda= 2315$\aa, hereafter nuv) and iras ($\lambda = 60\mu$m) surveys respectively.they are built in order to get detection at both wavelengths for most of thegalaxies. star formation rate (sfr) estimators based on the uv and firemissions are compared. systematic differences are found between the sfrestimators for individual galaxies based on the nuv fluxes corrected for dustattenuation and on the total ir luminosity. a combined estimator based on nuvand ir luminosities seems to be the best proxy over the whole range of valuesof sfr. although both samples present similar average values of the birthrateparameter b, their star-formation-related properties are substantiallydifferent: nuv-selected galaxies tend to show larger values of $b$ for lowermasses, sfrs and dust attenuations, supporting previous scenarios for the starformation history (sfh). conversely, about 20% of the fir-selected galaxiesshow high values of $b$, sfr and nuv attenuation. these galaxies, most of thembeing lirgs and ulirgs, break down the downsizing picture for the sfh, howevertheir relative contribution per unit volume is small in the local universe.finally, the cosmic sfr density of the local universe is estimated in aconsistent way from the nuv and ir luminosities.

(...) this data set has been complemented with archival optical,near-infrared, and far-infrared fluxes and colors. we find that the integrated(fuv-k) color provides robust discrimination between elliptical andspiral/irregular galaxies and also among spiral galaxies of differentsub-types. elliptical galaxies with brighter k-band luminosities (i.e. moremassive) are redder in (nuv-k) color but bluer in (fuv-nuv) than less massiveellipticals. in the case of the spiral/irregular galaxies our analysis showsthe presence of a relatively tight correlation between the (fuv-nuv) color andthe total infrared-to-uv ratio. the correlation found between (fuv-nuv) colorand k-band luminosity (with lower luminosity objects being bluer than moreluminous ones) can be explained as due to an increase in the dust content withgalaxy luminosity.  the images in this atlas along with the profiles and integrated propertiesare publicly available through a dedicated web page athttp://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/galex_atlas/

astro-ph;0609020	the fate of spiral galaxies in clusters: the star formation history of  the anemic virgo cluster galaxy ngc 4569	we present a new method for studying the star formation history of late-type,cluster galaxies undergoing gas starvation or a ram-pressure stripping event bycombining bidimensional multifrequency observations with multi-zones models ofgalactic chemical and spectrophotometricevolution. this method is applied tothe virgo cluster anemic galaxy ngc 4569. we extract radial profiles fromrecently obtained uv galex images at 1530 and 2310 a, from visible and near-irnarrow (halpha) and broad band images at different wavelengths (u, b, g, v, r,i, z, j, h, k), from spitzer irac and mips images and from atomic and moleculargas maps. the model in the absence of interaction (characterized by itsrotation velocity and spin parameter) is constrained by the unperturbed h bandlight profile and by the halpha rotation curve. we can reconstruct the observedtotal-gas radial-density profile and the light surface-brightness profiles atall wavelengths in a ram-pressure stripping scenario by making simpleassumptions about the gas removal process and the orbit of ngc 4569 inside thecluster. the observed profiles cannot be reproduced by simply stopping gasinfall, thus mimicing starvation. gas removal is required, which is moreefficient in the outer disk, inducing a radial quenching in the star formationactivity, as observed and reproduced by the model. this observational result,consistent with theoretical predictions that a galaxy-cluster igm interactionis able to modify structural disk parameters without gravitationalperturbations, is discussed in the framework of the origin of lenticulars inclusters.

astro-ph;9910404	disk accretion onto high-mass planets	we analyze the nonlinear, two-dimensional response of a gaseous, viscousprotoplanetary disk to the presence of a planet of one jupiter mass (1 m_j) andgreater that orbits a 1 solar mass star by using the zeus hydrodynamics codewith high resolution near the planet's roche lobe. the planet is assumed to bein a circular orbit about the central star and is not allowed to migrate. a gapis formed about the orbit of the planet, but there is a nonaxisymmetric flowthrough the gap and onto the planet. the gap partitions the disk into an inner(outer) disk that extends inside (outside) the planet's orbit. for a 1 m_jplanet and typical disk parameters, the accretion through the gap onto theplanet is highly efficient. for typical disk parameters, the mass doubling timescale is less than 10^5 years, considerably shorter than the disk lifetime.following shocks near the l1 and l2 lagrange points, disk material enters theroche lobe in the form of two gas streams. shocks occur within the roche lobeas the gas streams collide, and shocks lead to rapid inflow towards the planetwithin much of planet's roche lobe. shocks also propagate in the inner andouter disks that orbit the star. for higher mass planets (of order 6 m_j), theflow rate onto the planet is considerably reduced, which suggests an upper masslimit to planets in the range of 10 m_j. this rate reduction is related to thefact that the gap width increases relative to the roche (hill sphere) radiuswith increasing planetary mass. the flow in the gap affects planetarymigration. for the 1 m_j planet case, mass can penetrate from the outer disk tothe inner disk, so that the inner disk is not depleted. the results suggestthat most of the mass in gas giant planets is acquired by flows through gaps.
