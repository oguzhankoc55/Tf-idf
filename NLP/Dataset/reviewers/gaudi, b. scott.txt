0903.0181	marvels: revealing the formation and dynamical evolution of giant planet  systems	marvels, the multi-object apo radial velocity exoplanet large-area survey, isa 6-year program to characterize the distribution of gas giant planets withorbital periods ranging from several hours to two years. marvels will usemulti-fiber interferometric spectrographs on the wide-field, 2.5-meter sloanfoundation telescope at apache point observatory to monitor ~11,000 stars inthe magnitude range v=8-12, visiting each star ~30 times over an 18-monthinterval, with velocity precision of 14, 18, and 35 m/s at v=8, 10, and 12.marvels will survey far more stars with a wider range of spectral types andmetallicities than previous radial velocity searches, yielding a statisticallywell defined sample of ~150 giant planets drawn from a host sample with wellunderstood selection biases. with a unique combination of large numbers andwell characterized sensitivity, marvels will provide a critical data set fortesting theories of the formation and dynamical evolution of giant planetsystems. the marvels detections will also be an ideal sample for follow-upobservations to identify multiple planet systems and understand the influenceof giant planet migration on the formation and survival of less massiveplanets. marvels is one of four surveys that comprise sdss-iii (the sloandigital sky survey iii), a 6-year program that will use highly multiplexedspectrographs on the sloan foundation telescope to investigate cosmologicalparameters, the history and structure of the milky way galaxy, and thepopulation of giant planet systems.

0903.0880	the demographics of extrasolar planets beyond the snow line with  ground-based microlensing surveys	in the currently-favored paradigm of planet formation, the location of thesnow line in the protoplanetary disk plays a crucial role. determining thedemographics of planets beyond the snow line of stars of various masses is thusessential for testing this model. microlensing is sensitive to planets that aregenerally inaccessible to other methods, and in particular is most sensitive tocool planets at or beyond the snow line, including very low-mass (i.e.terrestrial) planets. hence, microlensing is uniquely suited and so essentialfor a comprehensive study of this region. microlensing is also sensitive toplanets orbiting low-mass stars, free-floating planets, planets in the galacticbulge and disk, and even planets in external galaxies. these planets can alsoprovide critical constraints on models of planet formation. althoughmicrolensing searches have so far detected only a handful of planets, thesehave already changed our understanding of planet formation beyond the snowline. next generation microlensing surveys, which would be sensitive to tens of"cold earths" in this region, are well advanced in design conception and arestarting initial practical implementation.

0707.3604	a new low-mass eclipsing binary from sdss-ii	we present observations of a new low-mass double-lined eclipsing binarysystem discovered using repeat observations of the celestial equator from thesloan digital sky survey ii. using near-infrared photometry and opticalspectroscopy we have measured the properties of this short-period[p=0.407037(14) d] system and its two components. we find the followingparameters for the two components: m_1=0.272+/-0.020 m_sun, r_1=0.268+/-0.010r_sun, m_2=0.240+/-0.022 m_sun, r_2=0.248+/-0.0090 r_sun, t_1=3320+/-130 k,t_2=3300+/-130 k. the masses and radii of the two components of this systemagree well with theoretical expectations based on models of low-mass stars,within the admittedly large errors. future synoptic surveys like pan-starrs andlsst will produce a wealth of information about low-mass eclipsing systems andshould make it possible, with an increased reliance on follow-up observations,to detect many systems with low-mass and sub-stellar companions. with the largenumbers of objects for which these surveys will produce high-qualityphotometry, we suggest that it becomes possible to identify such systems evenwith sparse time sampling and a relatively small number of individualobservations.

1002.0001	binary contamination in the segue sample: effects on sspp determinations  of stellar atmospheric parameters	using numerical modeling and a grid of synthetic spectra, we examine theeffects that unresolved binaries have on the determination of various stellaratmospheric parameters for segue targets measured using the segue stellarparameter pipeline (sspp). to model undetected binaries that may be in thesegue sample, we use a variety of mass distributions for the primary andsecondary stars in conjunction with empirically determined relationships fororbital parameters to determine the fraction of g-k dwarf stars, as defined bysdss color cuts, that will be blended with a secondary companion. we focus onthe g-k dwarf sample in segue as it records the history of chemical enrichmentin our galaxy. to determine the effect of the secondary on the spectroscopicparameters, we synthesize a grid of model spectra from 3275 to 7850 k (~0.1 to1.0 \msun) and [fe/h]=-0.5 to -2.5 from marcs model atmospheres usingturbospectrum. we analyze both "infinite" signal-to-noise ratio (s/n) modelsand degraded versions, at median s/n of 50, 25 and 10. by running individualand combined spectra (representing the binaries) through the sspp, we determinethat ~10% of the blended g-k dwarf pairs with s/n&gt;=25 will have theiratmospheric parameter determinations, in particular temperature andmetallicity, noticeably affected by the presence of an undetected secondary. toaccount for the additional uncertainty from binary contamination at a s/n~10,uncertainties of ~140 k and ~0.17 dex in [fe/h] must be added in quadrature tothe published uncertainties of the sspp. (abridged)

1002.0332	exoplanetary microlensing	gravitational microlensing occurs when a foreground star happens to pass veryclose to our line of sight to a more distant background star. the foregroundstar acts as a lens, splitting the light from the source star into two images,which are typically unresolved. however, these images are also magnified, by anamount that depends on the angular lens-source separation. the relativelens-source motion results in a time-variable source magnification: amicrolensing event. if the foreground star happens to host a planet withprojected separation near the paths of these images, the planet will furtherperturb the images, resulting in a characteristic, short-lived signature of theplanet. this chapter provides an introduction to the discovery andcharacterization of exoplanets with gravitational microlensing. the theoreticalfoundation of the method is reviewed, focusing on the phenomenology ofplanetary perturbations. the strengths and weaknesses of the microlensingtechnique are discussed, highlighting the fact that it is sensitive to low-massplanets with separations just beyond the snow line, orbiting stars locatedthroughout the galactic disk and foreground bulge. an overview of the practiceof microlensing planet searches is given, with a discussion of some of thechallenges with detecting and analyzing planetary perturbations. the chapterconcludes with a review of the results that have been obtained to date, and adiscussion of the near and long-term prospects for microlensing planet surveys.ultimately, microlensing is potentially sensitive to multiple-planet systemscontaining analogs of all the solar system planets except mercury, as well asto free floating planets, and will provide a crucial test of planet formationtheories by determining the demographics of planets throughout the galaxy.

1005.4415	achieving better than 1 minute accuracy in the heliocentric and  barycentric julian dates	as the quality and quantity of astrophysical data continue to improve, theprecision with which certain astrophysical events can be timed becomes limitednot by the data themselves, but by the manner, standard, and uniformity withwhich time itself is referenced. while some areas of astronomy (most notablypulsar studies) have required absolute time stamps with precisions ofconsiderably better than 1 minute for many decades, recently new areas havecrossed into this regime. in particular, in the exoplanet community, we havefound that the (typically unspecified) time standards adopted by various groupscan differ by as much as a minute. left uncorrected, this ambiguity may bemistaken for transit timing variations and bias eccentricity measurements. weargue that, since the commonly-used julian date, as well as its heliocentricand barycentric counterparts, can be specified in several time standards, it isimperative that their time standards always be reported when accuracies of 1minute are required. we summarize the rationale behind our recommendation toquote the site arrival time, in addition to using bjd_tdb, the barycentricjulian date in the barycentric dynamical time standard for any astrophysicalevent. the bjd_tdb is the most practical absolute time stamp forextra-terrestrial phenomena, and is ultimately limited by the properties of thetarget system. we compile a general summary of factors that must be consideredin order to achieve timing precisions ranging from 15 minutes to 1 microsecond.finally, we provide software tools that, in principal, allow one to calculatebjd_tdb to a precision of 1 microsecond for any target from anywhere on earthor from any spacecraft.

1006.1627	discovery of a low-mass companion to a metal-rich f star with the  marvels pilot project	we report the discovery of a low-mass companion orbiting the metal-rich, mainsequence f star tyc 2949-00557-1 during the marvels (multi-object apo radialvelocity exoplanet large-area survey) pilot project. the host star has aneffective temperature t_eff = 6135 +/- 40 k, log(g) = 4.4 +/- 0.1 and [fe/h] =0.32 +/- 0.01, indicating a mass of m = 1.25 +/- 0.09 m_\odot and r = 1.15 +/-0.15 r_\odot. the companion has an orbital period of 5.69449 +/- 0.00023 daysand straddles the hydrogen burning limit with a minimum mass of 64 m_j, and maythus be an example of the rare class of brown dwarfs orbiting at distancescomparable to those of "hot jupiters." we present relative photometry thatdemonstrates the host star is photometrically stable at the few millimagnitudelevel on time scales of hours to years, and rules out transits for a companionof radius greater than 0.8 r_j at the 95% confidence level. tidal analysis ofthe system suggests that the star and companion are likely in a doublesynchronous state where both rotational and orbital synchronization have beenachieved. this is the first low-mass companion detected with a multi-object,dispersed, fixed-delay interferometer.

1007.2881	the invisible majority? evolution and detection of outer planetary  systems without gas giants	we present 230 realizations of a numerical model of planet formation insystems without gas giants. these represent a scenario in which protoplanetsgrow in a region of a circumstellar disk where water ice condenses (the "iceline''), but fail to accrete massive gas envelopes before the gaseous disk isdispersed. each simulation consists of a small number of gravitationallyinteracting oligarchs and a much larger number of small bodies that representthe natal disk of planetesimals. we investigate systems with varying initialnumber of oligarchs, oligarch spacing, location of the ice line, total mass inthe ice line, and oligarch mean density. systems become chaotic in ~1 myr butsettle into stable configurations in 10-100 myr. we find: (1) runs consistentlyproduce a 5-9 earth mass planet at a semimajor axis of 0.25-0.6 times theposition of the ice line, (2) the distribution of planets' orbitaleccentricities is distinct from, and skewed toward lower values than theobserved distribution of (giant) exoplanet orbits, (3) inner systems of twodominant planets (e.g., earth and venus) are not stable or do not form becauseof the gravitational influence of the innermost icy planet. the planetspredicted by our model are unlikely to be detected by current dopplerobservations. microlensing is currently sensitive to the most massive planetsfound in our simulations. a scenario where up to 60% of stars host systems suchas those we simulate is consistent with all the available data. we predictthat, if this scenario holds, the nasa kepler spacecraft will detect about 120planets by two or more transits over the course of its 3.5 yr mission. futuremicrolensing surveys will detect ~130 analogs over a 5 yr survey. finally, thespace interferometry mission (sim-lite) should be capable of detecting 96% ofthe innermost icy planets over the course of a 5 yr mission.

1009.3013	ensemble analysis of open cluster transit surveys: upper limits on the  frequency of short-period planets consistent with the field	several photometric surveys for short-period transiting giant planets havetargeted a number of open clusters, but no convincing detections have beenmade. although each individual survey typically targeted an insufficient numberof stars to expect a detection assuming the frequency of short-period giantplanets found in surveys of field stars, we ask whether the lack of detectionsfrom the ensemble of open cluster surveys is inconsistent with expectationsfrom the field planet population. we select a subset of existing transitsurveys with well-defined selection criteria and quantified detectionefficiencies, and statistically combine their null results to show that theupper limit on the planet fraction is 5.5% and 1.4% for 1.0 $r_{j}$ and 1.5$r_{j}$ planets, respectively in the $3&lt;p&lt;5$ day period range. for the periodrange of $1&lt;p&lt;3$ days we find upper limits of 1.4% and 0.31% for 1.0 $r_{j}$and 1.5 $r_{j}$, respectively. comparing these results to the frequency ofshort-period giant planets around field stars in both radial velocity andtransit surveys, we conclude that there is no evidence to suggest that openclusters support a fundamentally different planet population than field starsgiven the available data.

0705.0004	on constraining a transiting exoplanet's rotation rate with its transit  spectrum	we investigate the effect of planetary rotation on the transit spectrum of anextrasolar giant planet. during ingress and egress, absorption features arisingfrom the planet's atmosphere are doppler shifted by of order the planet'srotational velocity (~1-2 km/s) relative to where they would be if the planetwere not rotating. we focus in particular on the case of hd209458b, which oughtto be at least as good a target as any other known transiting planet. forhd209458b, this shift should give rise to a small net centroid shift of ~60cm/s on the stellar absorption lines. using a detailed model of thetransmission spectrum due to a rotating star transited by a rotating planetwith an isothermal atmosphere, we simulate the effect of the planet's rotationon the shape of the spectral lines, and in particular on the magnitude of theirwidth and centroid shift. we then use this simulation to determine the expectedsignal-to-noise ratio for distinguishing a rotating from a non-rotating planet,and assess how this s/n scales with various parameters of hd209458b. we findthat with a 6 m telescope, an equatorial rotational velocity of ~2 km/s couldbe detected with a s/n~5 by accumulating the signal over many transits over thecourse of several years. with a 30 m telescope, the time required to make sucha detection reduces to less than 2 months.

1305.0280	marvels-1: a face-on double-lined binary star masquerading as a resonant  planetary system; and consideration of rare false positives in radial  velocity planet searches	we have analyzed new and previously published radial velocity observations ofmarvels-1, known to have an ostensibly substellar companion in a ~6- day orbit.we find significant (~100 m/s) residuals to the best-fit model for thecompanion, and these residuals are naively consistent with an interior giantplanet with a p = 1.965d in a nearly perfect 3:1 period commensuribility(|pb/pc - 3| &lt; 10^{-4}). we have performed several tests for the reality ofsuch a companion, including a dynamical analysis, a search for photometricvariability, and a hunt for contaminating stellar spectra. we find many reasonsto be critical of a planetary interpretation, including the fact that most ofthe three-body dynamical solutions are unstable. we find no evidence fortransits, and no evidence of stellar photometric variability. we havediscovered two apparent companions to marvels-1 with adaptive optics imaging atkeck; both are m dwarfs, one is likely bound, and the other is likely aforeground object. we explore false-alarm scenarios inspired by variouscuriosities in the data. ultimately, a line profile and bisector analysis leadus to conclude that the ~100 m/s residuals are an artifact of spectralcontamination from a stellar companion contributing ~15-30% of the opticallight in the system. we conclude that origin of this contamination is thepreviously detected radial velocity companion to marvels-1, which is not, aspreviously reported, a brown dwarf, but in fact a g dwarf in a face-on orbit.

1305.1298	a posteriori transit probabilities	typically, when estimating the prior transit probability, one assumes auniform distribution for the cosine of the inclination angle i of thecompanion's orbit, which yields the familiar estimate of ~r_*/a. however, theposterior transit probability depends not only on the prior probabilitydistribution of i but also on the prior probability distribution of thecompanion mass m_c. in general, the posterior can be larger or smaller than theprior transit probability. we derive analytic expressions for the posteriortransit probability assuming a power-law form for the distribution of truemasses with exponent alpha. for low transit probabilities, these probabilitiesreduce to a constant multiplicative factor of the corresponding prior transitprobability. the prior and posterior probabilities are equal for alpha = -1,whereas the posterior transit probability is ~1.5 times larger and ~4/pi largerfor for alpha = -3 and alpha = -2, but is less than the prior for alpha &gt;= 0,and can be arbitrarily small for alpha &gt; 1. we also calculate the posteriortransit probability in different mass regimes for two physically-motivated massdistributions of companions around sun-like stars, finding that the posterioris likely higher for super-earths, neptunes and super-jupiters. we thereforesuggest that companions with minimum masses in these regimes might bebetter-than-expected targets for transit follow-up, and we identify promisingtargets from rv-detected planets in the literature.

1306.3157	a cautionary tale: marvels brown dwarf candidate reveals itself to be a  very long period, highly eccentric spectroscopic stellar binary	we report the discovery of a highly eccentric, double-lined spectroscopicbinary star system (tyc 3010-1494-1), comprising two solar-type stars that wehad initially identified as a single star with a brown dwarf companion. at themoderate resolving power of the marvels spectrograph and the spectrographs usedfor subsequent radial-velocity (rv) measurements (r ~ &lt;30,000), this particularstellar binary mimics a single-lined binary with an rv signal that would beinduced by a brown dwarf companion (msin(i)~50 m_jup) to a solar-type primary.at least three properties of this system allow it to masquerade as a singlestar with a very low-mass companion: its large eccentricity (e~0.8), itsrelatively long period (p~238 days), and the approximately perpendicularorientation of the semi-major axis with respect to the line of sight (omega~189degrees). as a result of these properties, for ~95% of the orbit the two setsof stellar spectral lines are completely blended, and the rv measurements basedon centroiding on the apparently single-lined spectrum is very well fit by anorbit solution indicative of a brown dwarf companion on a more circular orbit(e~0.3). only during the ~5% of the orbit near periastron passage does thetrue, double-lined nature and large rv amplitude of ~15 km/s reveal itself. thediscovery of this binary system is an important lesson for rv surveys searchingfor substellar companions; at a given resolution and observing cadence, asurvey will be susceptible to these kinds of astrophysical false positives fora range of orbital parameters. finally, for surveys like marvels that lack theresolution for a useful line bisector analysis, it is imperative to monitor thepeak of the cross-correlation function for suspicious changes in width orshape, so that such false positives can be flagged during the candidate vettingprocess.

0804.1150	predicting the yields of photometric surveys for transiting extrasolar  planets	we develop a method for predicting the yield of transiting planets from aphotometric survey given the parameters of the survey (nights observed,bandpass, exposure time, telescope aperture, locations of the target fields,observational conditions, and detector characteristics), as well as theunderlying planet properties (frequency, period and radius distributions).using our updated understanding of transit surveys provided by the experiencesof the survey teams, we account for those factors that have proven to have thegreatest effect on the survey yields. specifically, we include the effects ofthe surveys' window functions, adopt revised estimates of the giant planetfrequency, account for the number and distribution of main-sequence stars inthe survey fields, and include the effects of galactic structure andinterstellar extinction. we approximate the detectability of a planetarytransit using a signal-to-noise ratio (s/n) formulation. we argue that ourchoice of detection criterion is the most uncertain input to our predictions,and has the largest effect on the resulting planet yield. thus drawing robustinferences about the frequency of planets from transit surveys will requirethat the survey teams impose and report objective, systematic, and quantifiabledetection criteria. nevertheless, with reasonable choices for the minimum s/n,we calculate yields that are generally lower, more accurate, and more realisticthan previous predictions. as examples, we apply our method to thetrans-atlantic exoplanet survey, the xo survey, and the {\it kepler} mission.we discuss red noise and its possible effects on planetary detections. weconclude with estimates of the expected detection rates for future wide-anglesynoptic surveys.

1505.00014	criteria for sample selection to maximize planet sensitivity and yield  from space-based microlens parallax surveys	space-based microlens parallax measurements are a powerful tool forunderstanding planet populations, especially their distribution throughout thegalaxy. however, if space-based observations of the microlensing events must bespecifically targeted, it is crucial that microlensing events enter theparallax sample without reference to the known presence or absence of planets.hence, it is vital to define objective criteria for selecting events wherepossible and to carefully consider and minimize the selection biases where notpossible so that the final sample represents a controlled experiment.  we present objective criteria for initiating observations and determiningtheir cadence for a subset of events, and we define procedures for isolatingsubjective decision making from information about detected planets for theremainder of events. we also define procedures to resolve conflicts betweensubjective and objective selections. these procedures maximize planetsensitivity of the sample as a whole by allowing for planet detections even ifthey occur before satellite observations for objectively-selected events and byhelping to trigger fruitful follow-up observations for subjectively-chosenevents. this paper represents our public commitment to these procedures, whichis a necessary component of enforcing objectivity on the experimental protocol.

1507.00780	astrophysical sources of statistical uncertainty in precision radial  velocities and their approximations	we investigate astrophysical contributions to the statistical uncertainty ofprecision radial velocity measurements of stellar spectra. we analyticallydetermine the uncertainty in centroiding isolated spectral lines broadened bygaussian, lorentzian, voigt, and rotational profiles, finding that for allcases and assuming weak lines, the uncertainty is the line centroid is$\sigma_v\approx c\,\theta^{3/2}/(w i_0^{1/2})$, where $\theta$ is thefull-width at half-maximum of the line, $w$ is the equivalent width, and $i_0$is the continuum signal-to-noise ratio, with $c$ a constant of order unity thatdepends on the specific line profile. we use this result to motivateapproximate analytic expressions to the total radial velocity uncertainty for astellar spectrum with a given photon noise, resolution, wavelength, effectivetemperature, surface gravity, metallicity, macroturbulence, and stellarrotation. we use these relations to determine the dominant contributions to thestatistical uncertainties in precision radial velocity measurements as afunction of effective temperature and mass for main-sequence stars. for starsmore than $\sim1.1\,m_\odot$ we find that stellar rotation dominates thevelocity uncertainties for moderate and high resolution spectra($r\gtrsim30,000$). for less massive stars, a variety of sources contributedepending on the spectral resolution and wavelength, with photon noise due todecreasing bolometric luminosity generally becoming increasingly important forlow-mass stars at fixed exposure time and distance. in most cases, resolutionsgreater than 60,000 provide little benefit in terms of statistical precision.we determine the optimal wavelength range for stars of various spectral types,finding that the optimal region depends on the stellar effective temperature,but for mid m-dwarfs and earlier the most efficient wavelength region is from6000a to 9000a.

1512.03745	recurring occultations of rw aurigae by coagulated dust in the tidally  disrupted circumstellar disk	we present photometric observations of rw aurigae, a classical t taurisystem, that reveal two remarkable dimming events. these events are similar tothat which we observed in 2010-2011, which was the first such deep dimmingobserved in rw aur in a century's worth of photometric monitoring. we suggestedthe 2010-2011 dimming was the result of an occultation of the star by itstidally disrupted circumstellar disk. in 2012-2013, the rw aur system dimmed by~0.7 mag for ~40 days and in 2014/2015 the system dimmed by ~2 mag for &gt;250days. the ingress/egress duration measurements of the more recent events agreewell with those from the 2010-2011 event, providing strong evidence that thenew dimmings are kinematically associated with the same occulting source.therefore, we suggest that both the 2012-2013 and 2014-2015 dimming events,measured using data from the kilodegree extremely little telescope and thekutztown university observatory, are also occultations of rw aur a by tidallydisrupted circumstellar material. recent hydrodynamical simulations of theeccentric fly-by of rw aur b suggest the occulting body to be a bridge ofmaterial connecting rw aur a and b. these simulations suggest the possibilityof additional occultations, supported by the observations presented in thiswork. the color evolution of the dimmings suggest that the tidally strippeddisk material includes dust grains ranging in size from small grains at theleading edge, typical of star forming regions, to large grains, ices or pebblesproducing grey or nearly grey extinction deeper within the occulting material.it is not known whether this material represents arrested planet building priorto the tidal disruption event, or perhaps accelerated planet building as aresult of the disruption event, but in any case the evidence suggests thepresence of advanced planet building material in the space between rw aur a andb.

astro-ph;0102003	resolving the image of gamma-ray burst afterglows with gravitational  microlensing	microlensing of a gamma-ray burst afterglow by an intervening star can beused to infer the radial structure of the afterglow image. near the peak of themicrolensing event, the outer edge of the image is more highly magnified thanits central region, whereas the situation is reversed at later times due to therapid radial expansion of the image on the sky. thus, the microlensed afterglowlight curve can be inverted to recover the self-similar radial intensityprofile of the afterglow image. we calculate the expected errors in therecovered intensity profile as a function of the number of resolution elements,under the assumption that the afterglow and microlensing event parameters areknown. for a point-mass lens and uniform source, we derive a simple scalingrelation between these parameters and the resultant errors. the afterglow neednot be monitored for its entire duration; rather, observations from the peakmagnification time t_p of the microlensing event until 7 t_p are sufficient toresolve the majority of the image. thus, microlensing events can be alerted byrelatively infrequent observations of afterglows and then monitoredintensively, without significant loss of information about the afterglowintensity profile. the relative intensity profile of about 1% of all afterglowscan be measured with 10 resolution elements to an accuracy of 1% in the opticaland 10% in the infrared, using 4m-class telescopes. weak microlensing eventswith large impact parameters are more common; we estimate that for about 10% ofafterglows the image profile may be inverted to a fractional accuracy 20%through frequent optical observations. we also calculate the effects ofexternal shear due to the host galaxy or a binary companion, and contaminationby background light from the host galaxy.

astro-ph;0108301	interpreting the m22 spike events	recently sahu et al., using the hubble space telescope to monitor stars inthe direction of the old globular cluster m22, detected six events in whichotherwise constant stars brightened by ~50% during a time of &lt;1 day. theytentatively interpret these unresolved events as due to microlensing ofbackground bulge stars by free-floating planets in m22. i show that if thesespike events are due to microlensing, the lensing objects are unlikely to beassociated with m22, and unlikely to be part of a smoothly distributed galacticpopulation. thus either there happens to be a massive, dark cluster of planetsalong our line-of-sight to m22, or the spike events are not due tomicrolensing. the lensing planets cannot be bound to stars in the core of m22:if they were closer than 8 au, the lensing influence of the parent star wouldhave been detectable. moreover, in the core of m22, all planets withseparations &gt; 1 au would have been ionized by random stellar encounters. mostunbound planets would have escaped the core via evaporation whichpreferentially affects such low-mass objects. bound or free-floating planetscan exist in the outer halo of m22; however, for reasonable assumptions, themaximum optical depth to such a population falls short of the observed opticaldepth, tau ~ 3x10^{-6}, by a factor of 5-10. therefore, if real, these eventsrepresent the detection of a significant free-floating galactic planetpopulation. the optical depth to these planets is comparable to and mutuallyexclusive from the optical depth to resolved events measured by microlensingsurvey collaborations toward the bulge, and thus implies a similar additionalmass of lensing objects. such a population is difficult to reconcile with boththeory and observations.

astro-ph;0210318	identifying lenses with small-scale structure. i. cusp lenses	the inability of standard models to explain the flux ratios in many 4-imagegravitational lenses has been cited as evidence for significant small-scalestructure in lens galaxies. that claim has generally relied on detailed lensmodeling, so it is both model dependent and somewhat difficult to interpret. wepresent a more robust and generic method for identifying lenses withsmall-scale structure. for a close triplet of images associated with a sourcenear a cusp caustic, the sum of the signed magnifications should approximatelyvanish. we derive realistic upper bounds on the sum, and argue that lenses withflux ratios that significiantly violate the bounds can be said to havestructure in the lens potential on scales smaller than the image separation.five observed lenses have such flux ratio ``anomalies'': b2045+265, 1rxsj1131-1231, and sdss j0924+0219 have strong anomalies; b0712+472 has a stronganomaly at optical/near-ir wavelengths and a marginal anomaly at radiowavelengths; and rx j0911+0551 appears to have an anomaly, but this conclusionis subject to uncertainties about octopole modes in early-type galaxies.analysis of the cusp relation does not identify the known anomaly in b1422+231,so methods that are more sophisticated (and less generic) than the cusprelation may be necessary to uncover flux ratio anomalies in some systems.although these flux ratio anomalies might represent milli- or micro-lensing, wecannot identify the cause; we can only conclude that the lenses havesignificant structure in the potential on scales smaller than the separationbetween the images. additional arguments must be invoked to specify the natureof this small-scale structure.

astro-ph;0304314	resolving the microlens mass degeneracy for earth-mass planets	of all planet-finding techniques, microlensing is potentially the mostsensitive to earth-mass planets. however, microlensing lightcurves genericallyyield only the planet-star mass ratio: the mass itself is uncertain to a factorof a few. to determine the planet mass, one must measure both the ``microlensparallax'' and source-lens relative proper motion. here we present a new methodto measure microlens masses for terrestrial planets. we show that, with only amodest adjustment to the proposed orbit of the dedicated satellite that findsthe events, and combined with observations from a ground-based observingprogram, the planet mass can be measured routinely. the dedicated satellitethat finds the events will automatically measure the proper motion and oneprojection of the ``vector microlens parallax.'' if the satellite is placed inan l2 orbit, or a highly elliptical orbit around the earth, the earth-satellitebaseline is sufficient to measure a second projection of the vector microlensparallax from the difference in the lightcurves as seen from the earth and thesatellite as the source passes over the caustic structure induced by theplanet. this completes the mass measurement.

astro-ph;0307280	extremely close-in giant planets from tidal capture	planets that form around stars born in dense stellar environments are subjectto dynamical perturbations from other stars in the system. these perturbationswill strip outer planets, forming a population of free-floating planets, someof which will be tidally captured before they evaporate from the system. forsystems with velocity dispersion of 1 km/s, jupiter-mass planets can becaptured into orbits with periods of 0.1-0.4 days, which are generally stableover a gyr, assuming quadratic suppression of eddy viscosity in the convectivezones of the host stars. under this assumption, and that most stars formseveral massive planets at separations 5-50 au, about 0.03% of stars in rich,mature open clusters should have extremely close-in tidally captured planets.approximately 0.005% of field stars should also have such planets, which may befound in field searches for transiting planets. detection of a population oftidally-captured planets would indicate that most stars formed in stellarclusters. in globular clusters, the fraction of stars with tidally-capturedplanets rises to 0.1% -- in conflict with the null result of the transit searchin 47 tuc. this implies that, if the quadratic prescription for viscositysuppression is correct, planetary formation was inhibited in 47 tuc: less thanone planet of jupiter-mass or greater (bound or free-floating) formed percluster star. less than half of the stars formed solar-system analogs. browndwarfs can also be captured in tight orbits; the lack of such companions in 47tuc in turn implies an upper limit on the initial frequency of brown dwarfs inthis cluster. however, this upper limit is extremely sensitive to the highlyuncertain timescale for orbital decay, and thus it is difficult to draw robustconclusions about the low-mass end of the mass function in 47 tuc.

(1) if most stars have rotation periods similarto chromospherically-active (i.e. spotted) giant stars in the bulge, than ~15%should be sufficiently oblate (e&gt;0.25) to produce detectable (&gt;1%) deviationswith current observations. the form of the deviation due to ellipticity isqualitatively similar to that due to limb-darkening. thus stellar oblatenessmay have to be taken into account in interpretations of precise limb-darkeningmeasurements with microlensing. (2) giant planets will generally not produce adetectable oblateness signal, either because they rotate too slowly (if theyare close-in and tidally locked), or because they are too faint (if they arefarther away from the parent star). (3) there is a near-degeneracy betweenellipticity and position angle for equal-area sources with scale-free intensityprofiles and elliptical isophotes. this degeneracy results in a factor of ~2uncertainty in the measurement of the scale-length of a standard thin accretiondisk using observations of a single, linear fold crossing quasar microlensingevent in passbands probing the outer parts of the disk. higher-frequencyobservations can reduce this uncertainty.

astro-ph;0405217	prospects for the detection of earth-mass planets	we compare potential state-of-the-art experiments for detecting earth-massplanets around main-sequence stars using radial velocities, transits,astrometry, and microlensing. for conventionally-discussed signal-to-noiseratio (s/n) thresholds, s/n ~ 8, the last three methods are roughly comparablein terms of both the total number of planets detected and the mass distributionof their host stars. however we argue that s/n ~ 25 is a more conservative andrealistic s/n threshold. we show analytically and numerically that the declinein the number of detections as a function of s/n is very steep for radialvelocities, transits, and astrometry, such that the number of expecteddetections at s/n ~ 25 is more than an order-of-magnitude smaller than atconventional s/n thresholds. indeed, unless earth-mass planets are very commonor are packed much closer to their parent stars than in the solar system,future searches using these methods (as they are currently planned) may notyield any reliable earth-mass planet detections. on the other hand,microlensing has a much shallower s/n slope than the other techniques and sohas much greater sensitivity at realistic s/n thresholds. we show that even ifall stars have earth-mass planets at periods of one year (and adopting otheroptimistic assumptions as well), the combined yield of all four techniqueswould be the detection of only about five such planets at s/n ~ 25.

astro-ph;0409443	on the period distribution of close-in extrasolar giant planets	transit (tr) surveys for extrasolar planets have recently uncovered apopulation of ``very hot jupiters,'' planets with orbital periods of p&lt; 3 d. atfirst sight this may seem surprising, given that radial velocity (rv) surveyshave found a dearth of such planets, despite the fact that their sensitivityincreases with decreasing p. we examine the confrontation between rv and trsurvey results, paying particular attention to selection biases that favorshort-period planets in transit surveys. we demonstrate that, when such biasesand small-number statistics are properly taken into account, the perioddistribution of planets found by rv and tr surveys are consistent at betterthan the 1-sigma level. this consistency holds for a large range of reasonableassumptions. in other words, there are not enough planets detected to robustlyconclude that the rv and tr short-period planet results are inconsistent.assuming a logarithmic distribution of periods, we find that the relativefrequency of very hot jupiters (vhj: p=1-3 d) to hot jupiters (hj: p=3-9 d) is10-20%. given an absolute frequency of hj of ~1%, this implies thatapproximately one star in ~500-1000 has a vhj. we also note that vhj and hjappear to be distinct in terms of their upper mass limit. we discuss theimplications of our results for planetary migration theories, as well aspresent and future tr and rv surveys.

astro-ph;0409589	microlensing characterization of wide-separation planets	with their excellent photometric precision and dramatic increase inmonitoring frequency, future microlensing survey experiments are expected to besensitive to very short time-scale, isolated events caused by free-floating andwide-separation planets with mass as low as a few lunar masses. we estimate theprobability of measuring the einstein radius \theta_e for bound andfree-floating planets. we carry out detailed simulations of the planetaryevents expected in next-generation surveys and estimate the resultinguncertainty in \theta_e for these events. we show that, for main-sequencesources and jupiter-mass planets, the caustic structure of wide-separationplanets with projected separations of &lt; 20 au substantially increases theprobability of measuring the dimensionless source size and thus determining\theta_e compared to the case of unbound planets. in this limit where thesource is much smaller than the caustic, the effective cross-section to measure\theta_e to 10% is ~25% larger than the full width of the caustic. measurementof the lens parallax is possible for low-mass planetary events by combinedobservations from the ground and a satellite located in an l2 orbit; this wouldcomplete the mass measurements for such wide-separation planets. finally,short-duration events caused by bound planets can be routinely distinguishedfrom those caused by free-floating planets for planet-star separations &lt; 20 aufrom either the deviations due to the planetary caustic or (more often) thelow-amplitude bump from the magnification due to the parent star.

astro-ph;0503452	identifying lenses with small-scale structure. ii. fold lenses	when the source in a 4-image gravitational lens lies close to a "fold"caustic, two of the lensed images lie close together. if the lens potential issmooth on the scale of the separation between the two close images, then thedifference between their fluxes should approximately vanish, rfold =(f1-f2)/(f1+f2) \approx 0. violations of this "fold relation" in observedlenses are thought to indicate the presence of structure on scales smaller thanthe separation between the close images. we study the fold relation and find itto be more subtle and rich than was previously realized. the degree to whichrfold can differ from zero for realistic smooth lenses depends not only on thedistance of the source from the caustic, but also on its location along thecaustic, and on the angular structure of the lens potential. thus, it isimpossible to say from rfold alone whether observed flux ratios are anomalousor not. instead, we must consider the full distribution of rfold values thatcan be obtained from smooth potentials that reproduce the separation betweenthe two close images and the distance to the next nearest image. we analyze thegeneric and specific features of this distribution, and then show that 5 of the12 known lenses with fold configurations have flux ratio anomalies: b0712+472,sdss 0924+0219, pg 1115+080, b1555+375, and b1933+503. combining this with ourprevious analysis revealing anomalies in 3 of the 4 known lenses with cuspconfigurations, we conclude that at least half (8/16) of all 4-image lensesthat admit generic, local analyses exhibit flux ratio anomalies indicative ofsmall-scale structure. the fold and cusp relations do not reveal the nature ofthe implied small-scale structure, but do provide the formal foundation forsubstructure studies.

astro-ph;0504123	on the size distribution of close-in extrasolar giant planets	the precisions of extrasolar planet radius measurements are reaching thepoint at which meaningful and discriminatory comparisons with theoreticalpredictions are can be made. however, care must be taken to account forselection effects in the transit surveys that detect the transiting planets forwhich radius measurements are possible. here i identify one such selectioneffect, such that the number of planets with radius r_p detected in asignal-to-noise ratio limited transit survey is proportional to r_p^alpha, withalpha~4-6. in the presence of a dispersion sigma in the intrinsic distributionof planet radii, this selection effect translates to bias b in the radii ofobserved planets. detected planets are, on average, larger by a fractionalamount b ~ alpha (sigma/&lt;r_p&gt;)^2 relative to the mean radius &lt;r_p&gt; of theunderlying distribution. i argue that the intrinsic dispersion in planetaryradii is likely to be in the range sigma = (0.05-0.13)r_j, where the lowerbound is that expected theoretically solely from the variance in stellarinsolation, and the upper bound is the 95% c.l. upper limit from the scatter inobserved radii. assuming an arbitrary but plausible value of sigma/&lt;r_p&gt;~10%,and thus b~6%, i infer a mean intrinsic radius of close-in massive extrasolarplanets of &lt;r_p&gt;=(1.03+/-0.01)r_j. this value reinforces the case for hd209458bhaving an anomalously large radius, and may be inconsistent with corelessmodels of irradiated giant planets.

astro-ph;0512207	survey for transiting extrasolar planets in stellar systems: iii. a  limit on the fraction of stars with planets in the open cluster ngc 1245	we analyze a 19-night photometric search for transiting extrasolar planets inthe open cluster ngc 1245. an automated transit search algorithm withquantitative selection criteria finds six transit candidates; none are bonafide planetary transits. we characterize the survey detection probability viamonte carlo injection and recovery of realistic limb-darkened transits. we usethis to derive upper limits on the fraction of cluster members with close-injupiter-radii, rj, companions. we carefully analyze the random and systematicerrors of the calculation. for similar photometric noise and weather propertiesas this survey, observing ngc 1245 twice as long results in a tighterconstraint on "hot jupiter", hj, companions than observing an additionalcluster of similar richness as ngc 1245 for the same length of time as thissurvey. this survey observed ~870 cluster members. if 1% of stars have 1.5 rjhj companions, we expect to detect one planet for every 5000 dwarf starsobserved for a month. to reach a ~2% upper limit on the fraction of stars with1.5 rj hj companions, we conclude a total sample size of ~7400 dwarf starsobserved for at least a month will be needed. results for 1.0 rj companions,without substantial improvement in the photometric precision, will require asmall factor larger sample size.

astro-ph;0601001	frequency of hot jupiters and very hot jupiters from the ogle-iii  transit surveys toward the galactic bulge and carina	we derive the frequencies of hot jupiters (hjs) with 3--5 day periods andvery hot jupiters (vhjs) with 1-3 day periods by comparing the planets actuallydetected in the ogle-iii survey with those predicted by our models. the modelsare constructed following gould &amp; morgan (2003) by populating the line of sightwith stars drawn from the hipparcos catalog. using these, we demonstrate thatthe number of stars with sensitivity to hjs and vhjs is only 4--16% of those inthe ogle-iii fields satisfying the spectroscopic-followup limit of v_max&lt;17.5.hence, the frequencies we derive are much higher than a naive estimate wouldindicate. we find that at 90% confidence the fraction of stars with planets inthe two period ranges is (1/310)(1^{+1.39}_{-0.59}) for hjs and(1/690)(1^{+1.10}_{-0.54}) for vhjs. the hj rate is statisticallyindistinguishable from that found in radial velocity (rv) studies. however, wenote that magnitude-limited rv samples are heavily biased toward metal-rich(hence, planet-bearing) stars, while transit surveys are not, and therefore weexpect that more sensitive transit surveys should find a deficit of hjs ascompared to rv surveys. the detection of 3 transiting vhjs, all with periodsless than 2 days, is marginally consistent with the complete absence of suchdetections in rv surveys. the planets detected are consistent with beinguniformly distributed between 1.00 and 1.25 jovian radii, but there are too fewin the sample to map this distribution in detail.

astro-ph;0608071	prospects for the characterization and confirmation of transiting  exoplanets via the rossiter-mclaughlin effect	the rossiter-mclaughlin (rm) effect is the distortion of stellar spectrallines that occurs during eclipses or transits, due to stellar rotation. weassess the future prospects for using the rm effect to measure the alignment ofplanetary orbits with the spin axes of their parent stars, and to confirmexoplanetary transits. we compute the achievable accuracy for the parameters ofinterest, in general and for the 5 known cases of transiting exoplanets withbright host stars. we determine the requirements for detecting the effects ofdifferential rotation. for transiting planets with small masses or long periods(as will be detected by forthcoming satellite missions), the velocity anomalyproduced by the rm effect can be much larger than the orbital velocity of thestar. for a terrestrial planet in the habitable zone of a sun-like star foundby the kepler mission, it will be difficult to use the rm effect to confirmtransits with current instruments, but it still may be easier than measuringthe spectroscopic orbit.

astro-ph;0611448	characterization of gravitational microlensing planetary host stars	the gravitational microlensing light curves that reveal the presence ofextrasolar planets generally yield the planet-star mass ratio and separation inunits of the einstein ring radius. the microlensing method does not require thedetection of light from the planetary host star. this allows the detection ofplanets orbiting very faint stars, but it also makes it difficult to convertthe planet-star mass ratio to a value for the planet mass. we show that in manycases, the lens stars are readily detectable with high resolution space-basedfollow-up observations in a single passband. when the lens star is detected,the lens-source relative proper motion can also be measured, and this allowsthe masses of the planet and its host star to be determined and the star-planetseparation can be converted to physical units. observations in multiplepassbands provide redundant information, which can be used to confirm thisinterpretation. for the recently detected super-earth planet,ogle-2005-blg-169lb, we show that the lens star will definitely be detectablewith observations by the hubble space telescope (hst) unless it is a stellarremnant. finally, we show that most planets detected by a space-basedmicrolensing survey are likely to orbit host stars that will be detected andcharacterized by the same survey.

astro-ph;0612141	statistics and simulations of transit surveys for extrasolar planets	the yields from transit surveys can be used to constrain the frequency andstatistical properties of extrasolar planets. conversely, planet frequenciescan be used to estimate expected detection rates, which are critical for theplanning and execution of these surveys. here i review efforts to accomplishthese two related goals, both of which generally require realistic simulations.early attempts to predict planet yields generally resulted in overly optimisticdetection rates that have not been realized. i point out where these estimateslikely went wrong, and emphasize the strong biases and sensitivity to detectionthresholds inherent in transit surveys. i argue that meaningful comparisonsbetween observed and predicted detection rates require proper calibration ofthese biases and thresholds. in the few cases where this has been done, theobserved rates agree with the results from radial velocity surveys for similarstellar environments. i then go on to describe recent, detailed calculationswhich should provide more accurate rates, which can be critically compared toobserved yields. finally, i discuss expectations for future all-sky synopticsurveys, which may have the sensitivity to detect hundreds or thousands ofclose-in transiting planets. realizing the enormous potential of these surveyswill require novel methods of coping with the overwhelming number ofastrophysical false positives that will accompany the planet detections.

astro-ph;0703125	discovery of a very bright, nearby gravitational microlensing event	we report the serendipitous detection of a very bright, very nearbymicrolensing event. in late october 2006, an otherwise unremarkable a0 star ata distance ~1 kpc (gsc 3656-1328) brightened achromatically by a factor ofnearly 40 over the span of several days and then decayed in an apparentlysymmetrical way. we present a light curve of the event based on opticalphotometry from the center for backyard astrophysics and the all sky automatedsurvey, as well as near-infrared photometry from the peters automated infraredimaging telescope. this light curve is well-fit by a generic microlensingmodel. we also report optical spectra, and swift x-ray and uv observations thatare consistent with the microlensing interpretation. we discuss and rejectalternative explanations for this variability. the lens star is probably alow-mass star or brown dwarf, with a relatively high proper motion of &gt;20mas/yr, and may be visible using precise optical/infrared imaging taken severalyears from now. a modest, all-sky survey telescope could detect ~10 such eventsper year, which would enable searches for very low-mass planetary companions torelatively nearby stars.

astro-ph;9601030	satellite parallaxes of lensing events towards the galactic bulge	in order to understand the nature of the lenses that generate microlensingevents, one would like to measure their mass, distance, and velocity.unfortunately, current microlensing experiments measure only one parameter ofthe events, the characteristic timescale, which is a combination of theunderlying physical parameters. other methods are required to extractadditional information. parallax measurements using a satellite in anearth-like orbit yield the projected velocity of the lens: ${\bf{\tilde v}}={\bf{v}}/(1-z)$, where ${\bf{v}}$ is the transverse velocity (speed anddirection) of the lens relative to the earth-source line of sight, and $z$ isthe ratio of the distances to the lens and the source. a measurement of${\bf{\tilde v}}$ could distinguish between lenses belonging to the bulge anddisk populations. we show that for photometric precisions of 1% to 2%, it ispossible to measure the projected speed, $\tilde v$, to an accuracy of $\leq10%$ for over 70% of disk lenses and over 60% of bulge lenses. for measuringthe projected velocity ${\bf{\tilde v}}$, the percentages are 40% and {30%},respectively. we find lines of sight $&gt; 2^{\circ}$ away from the ecliptic arepreferable, and an earth-satellite separation in the range $0.7 {\rm{au}} -1.9{\rm{au}}$ is optimal. the requirements of the satellite for measuring theprojected velocities of events towards the bulge are similar to those formeasurements toward the lmc.

astro-ph;9606104	detection rates for close binaries via microlensing	microlensing is one of the most promising methods of reconstructing thestellar mass function down to masses even below the hydrogen-burning limit. thefundamental limit to this technique is the presence of unresolved binaries,which can in principle significantly alter the inferred mass function. here wequantify the fraction of binaries that can be detected using microlensing,considering specifically the mass ratio and separation of the binary. we findthat almost all binary systems with separations greater than $b \sim 0.4$ oftheir combined einstein ring radius are detectable assuming a detectionthreshold of $3\%$. for two m dwarfs, this corresponds to a limiting separationof $\gsim 1 \au$. since very few observed m dwarfs have companions atseparations $\lsim 1 \au$, we conclude that close binaries will probably notcorrupt the measurements of the mass function. we find that the detectabilitydepends only weakly on the mass ratio. for those events for which individualmasses can be determined, we find that binaries can be detected down to $b \sim0.2$.

astro-ph;9610123	planet parameters in microlensing events	a planetary microlensing event occurs when a planet perturbs one of the twoimages created in a point-mass microlensing event, causing a deviation from thestandard paczy\'nski curve. determination of the two physical parameters thatcan be extracted from a planetary microlensing event, the planet/star massratio q, and the planet/star separation in units of the stellar einstein ring,$y_p$, is hampered by several types of degeneracies. there are two distinct andqualitatively different classes of planetary events: major and minor imageperturbations. for major image perturbations, there is a potentially cripplingcontinuous degeneracy in q which is of order $\delta_d^{-1}$, where $\delta_d$is the maximum fractional deviation of the planetary perturbation. since thethreshold of detection is expected to be $\delta_d \sim 5%$, this degeneracy inq can be a factor of $\sim 20$. for minor image perturbations, the continuousdegeneracy in q is considerably less severe, and is typically less than afactor 4. we show that these degeneracies can be resolved by observations fromdedicated telescopes on several continents together with optical/infraredphotometry from one of these sites. there also exists a class of discretedegeneracies. these are typically easy to resolve given good temporal coverageof the planetary event. unambiguous interpretation of planetary microlensingevents requires the resolution of both types of degeneracy. we describe thedegeneracies in detail and specify the situations in which they areproblematic. we also describe how individual planet masses and physicalprojected separations can be measured.

astro-ph;9706268	planetary microlensing perturbations: true planets or binary sources?	a planetary microlensing event is characterized by a short-lived perturbationto the standard paczy\'nski curve. planetary perturbations typically last froma few hours to a day, and have maximum amplitudes, $\dmax$, of $5-20%$ of thestandard curve. there exist a subset of binary-source events that can reproducethese main features, and thus masquerade as planetary events. these eventsrequire a binary source with a small flux ratio, $\epsil \sim 10^{-2}-10^{-4}$,and a small impact parameter for the fainter source, $\beta_2 \lsim \epsil /\dmax$. the detection probability of events of this type is $\sim \beta_2$, andcan be as high as $\sim 30%$; this is comparable to planetary detection rates.thus a sample of planetary-like perturbations could be seriously contaminatedby binary-source events, and there exists the possibility that completelymeaningless physical parameters would be derived for any given perturbation.here i derive analytic expressions for a binary-source event in the extremeflux ratio limit, and use these to demonstrate the basic degeneracy betweenbinary source and planet perturbations. i describe how the degeneracy can bebroken by dense and accurate sampling of the perturbation, optical/infraredphotometry, or spectroscopic measurements.

astro-ph;9802205	spectrophotometric resolution of stellar atmospheres with microlensing	microlensing is a powerful tool for studying stellar atmospheres because asthe source crosses regions of formally infinite magnification (caustics) thesurfaceof the star is resolved, thereby allowing one to measure the radialintensity profile, both photometrically and spectroscopically. however, causticcrossing events are relatively rare, and monitoring them requires intensiveapplication of telescope resources. it is therefore essential that theobservational parameters needed to accurately measure the intensity profile arequantified. we calculate the expected errors in the recovered radial intensityprofile as a function of the unlensed flux, source radius, spatial resolutionthe recovered intensity profile, and caustic crossing time for the twoprinciple types of caustics: point-mass and binary lenses. we demonstrate thatfor both cases there exist simple scaling relations between these parametersand the resultant errors. we find that the error as a function of the spatialresolution of the recovered profile, parameterized by the number of radialbins, increases as $n_r^{3/2}$, considerably faster than the naive $n_r^{1/2}$expectation. finally, we discuss the relative advantages of binarycaustic-crossing events and point-lens events. binary events are more common,easier to plan for, and provide more homogeneous information about the stellaratmosphere. however, a sub-class of point-mass events with low impactparameters can provide dramatically more information provided that they can berecognized in time to initiate observations.

astro-ph;9803282	microlensing by multiple planets in high magnification events	microlensing is increasingly gaining recognition as a powerful method for thedetection and characterization of extra-solar planetary systems. naively, onemight expect that the probability of detecting the influence of more than oneplanet on any single microlensing light curve would be small. recently,however, griest &amp; safizadeh (1998) have shown that, for a subset of events,those with minimum impact parameter $u_{min} \lsim 0.1$ (high magnificationevents), the detection probability is nearly 100% for jovian mass planets withprojected separations in the range 0.6--1.6 of the primary einstein ring radius$r_e$, and remains substantial outside this zone. in this letter, we point outthat this result implies that, regardless of orientation, all jovian massplanets with separations near 0.6--1.6$r_e$ dramatically affect the centralregion of the magnification pattern, and thus have a significant probability ofbeing detected (or ruled out) in high magnification events. the probability,averaged over all orbital phases and inclination angles, of two planets havingprojected separations within 0.6--$1.6r_e$ is substantial: 1-15% for twoplanets with the intrinsic orbital separations of jupiter and saturn orbitingaround 0.3--1.0$m_\odot$ parent stars. we illustrate by example the complicatedmagnification patterns and light curves that can result when two planets arepresent, and discuss possible implications of our result on detectionefficiencies and the ability to discriminate between multiple and singleplanets in high magnification events.
