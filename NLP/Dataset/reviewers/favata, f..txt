0707.2322	the correlation between soft and hard x-rays component in flares: from  the sun to the stars	in this work we study the correlation between the soft (1.6--12.4 kev, mostlythermal) and the hard (20--40 and 60--80 kev, mostly non-thermal) x-rayemission in solar flares up to the most energetic events, spanning about 4orders of magnitude in peak flux, establishing a general scaling law andextending it to the most intense stellar flaring events observed to date. weused the data from the reuven ramaty high-energy solar spectroscopic imager(rhessi) spacecraft, a nasa small explorer launched in february 2002. rhessihas good spectral resolution (~1 kev in the x-ray range) and broad energycoverage (3 kev--20 mev), which makes it well suited to distinguish the thermalfrom non-thermal emission in solar flares. our study is based on the detailedanalysis of 45 flares ranging from the goes c-class, to the strongest x-classevents, using the peak photon fluxes in the goes 1.6--12.4 kev and in two bandsselected from rhessi data, i.e.20--40 kev and 60--80 kev. we find a significantcorrelation between the soft and hard peak x-ray fluxes spanning the completesample studied. the resulting scaling law has been extrapolated to the case ofthe most intense stellar flares observed, comparing it with the stellarobservations. our results show that an extrapolation of the scaling law derivedfor solar flares to the most active stellar events is compatible with theavailable observations of intense stellar flares in hard x-rays.

1005.2125	generation of radiative knots in a randomly pulsed protostellar jet ii.  x-ray emission	protostellar jets are known to emit in a wide range of bands, from radio toir to optical bands, and to date also about ten x-ray emitting jets have beendetected, with a rate of discovery of about one per year. we aim atinvestigating the mechanism leading to the x-ray emission detected inprotostellar jets and at constraining the physical parameters that describe thejet/ambient interaction by comparing our model predictions with observations.we perform 2d axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations of the interaction betweena supersonic jet and the ambient. the jet is described as a train of plasmablobs randomly ejected by the stellar source along the jet axis. we explore theparameter space by varying the ejection rate, the initial jet mach number, andthe initial density contrast between the ambient and the jet. we synthesizedfrom the model the x-ray emission as it would be observed with the currentx-ray telescopes. the mutual interactions among the ejected blobs and of theblobs with the ambient medium lead to complex x-ray emitting structures withinthe jet: irregular chains of knots; isolated knots with measurable propermotion; apparently stationary knots; reverse shocks. the predicted x-rayluminosity strongly depends on the ejection rate and on the initial densitycontrast between the ambient and the jet, with a weaker dependence on the jetmach number. our model represents the first attempt to describe the x-rayproperties of all the x-ray emitting protostellar jets. the comparison betweenour model predictions and the observations can provide a useful diagnostic toolnecessary for a proper interpretation of the observations. in particular, wesuggest that the observable quantities derived from the spectral analysis ofx-ray observations can be used to constrain the ejection rate, a parameterexplored in our model that is not measurable by current observations.

1005.4384	accretion dynamics and disk evolution in ngc 2264: a study based on the  corot photometric observations	the young cluster ngc 2264 was observed with the corot satellite for 23 daysuninterruptedly in march 2008 with unprecedent photometric accuracy. we presenthere the first results of the analysis of the accreting population. we intendedto look for possible light curve variability of the same nature as thatobserved in the classical t tauri star aa tau, which was attributed to amagnetically controlled inner disk warp, which is directly associated with theinteraction between the stellar magnetic field and the inner disk region. weanalysed the corot light curves of 83 previously known classical t tauri starsthat belong to ngc 2264 and classified them according to their morphology. wealso studied the corot light curve morphology as a function of a spitzer-basedclassification of the star-disk systems. the classification derived on thebasis of the corot light curve morphology agrees very well with the spitzerirac-based classification of the systems. the percentage of aa tau-like lightcurves decreases as the inner disk dissipates, from 40% +- 10% in systems withthick inner disks to 36% +- 16% in systems with anemic disks and none in nakedphotosphere systems. indeed, 91% +- 29% of the ctts with naked photospheresexhibit pure spot-like variability, while only 18% +- 7% of the thick disksystems do so, presumably those seen at low inclination and thus free ofvariable obscuration. aa tau-like light curves are found to be fairly common,with a frequency of at least ~ 30 to 40% in young stars with inner dusty disks.the temporal evolution of the light curves indicates that the structure of theinner disk warp, located close to the corotation radius and responsible for theobscuration episodes, varies over a timescale of a few (~ 1-3) rotationalperiods. this probably reflects the highly dynamical nature of the star-diskmagnetospheric interaction.

1006.0041	correlated optical and x-ray variability in ctts - indications of  absorption-modulated emission	optical and x-ray emission from classical t tauri stars (cttss) has long beenknown to be highly variable. our long, uninterrupted optical observation of thengc2264 region with corot allows the optical variability in ctts to be studiedwith unprecedented accuracy and time coverage. two short chandra observationsobtained during the corot pointing with a separation of 16 days allow us tostudy whether there is a correlation between optical and x-ray variability onthis timescale, thus probing the physical mechanisms driving the variability inboth bands. we have computed the optical and x-ray fractional variabilitybetween the two 30 ks duration windows covered by both the chandra and corotobservations, for a sample of classical and weak line t tauri stars (wttss) inngc2264. a scatter plot clearly shows that the variability of cttss in theoptical and soft x-ray (0.5-1.5 kev) bands is correlated, while no correlationis apparent in the hard (1.5-8.0 kev) band. also, no correlation in either bandis present for wttss. we show that the correlation between soft x-ray andoptical variability of cttss can be naturally explained in terms oftime-variable shading (absorption) from circumstellar material orbiting thestar, in a scenario rather similar to the one invoked to explain the observedphenomenology in the ctts aa tau. the slope of the observed correlation implies(in the hypothesis of homogeneous shading) a significant dust depletion in thecircumstellar material (with a gas-to-dust ratio approximately 5 times lowerthan the standard value for interstellar material).

1105.4081	x-ray emission from protostellar jet hh 154: the first evidence of a  diamond shock?	x-ray emission from about ten protostellar jets has been discovered and itappears as a feature common to the most energetic jets. although x-ray emissionseems to originate from shocks internal to jets, the mechanism forming theseshocks remains controversial. one of the best studied x-ray jet is hh 154 thathas been observed by chandra over a time base of about 10 years. we analyze thechandra observations of hh 154 by investigating the evolution of its x-raysource. we show that the x-ray emission consists of a bright stationarycomponent and a faint elongated component. we interpret the observations bydeveloping a hydrodynamic model describing a protostellar jet originating froma nozzle and compare the x-ray emission synthesized from the model with thex-ray observations. the model takes into account the thermal conduction andradiative losses and shows that the jet/nozzle leads to the formation of adiamond shock at the nozzle exit. the shock is stationary over the periodcovered by our simulations and generates an x-ray source with luminosity andspectral characteristics in excellent agreement with the observations. weconclude that the x-ray emission from hh 154 is consistent with a diamond shockoriginating from a nozzle through which the jet is launched into the ambientmedium. we suggest that the physical origin of the nozzle could be related tothe dense gas in which the hh 154 driving source is embedded and/or to themagnetic field at the jet launching/collimation region.

1405.6988	dynamical star-disk interaction in the young stellar system v354 mon	the main goal of this work is to characterize the mass accretion and ejectionprocesses of the classical t tauri star v354 mon, a member of the young stellarcluster ngc 2264. in march 2008, photometric and spectroscopic observations ofv354 mon were obtained simultaneously with the corot satellite, the 60 cmtelescope at the observat\'orio pico dos dias (lna - brazil) equipped with accd camera and johnson/cousins bvri filters, and the sophie \'echellespectrograph at the observatoire de haute-provence (cnrs - france). the lightcurve of v354 mon shows periodical minima (p = 5.26 +/- 0.50 days) that vary indepth and width at each rotational cycle. from the analysis of the photometricand spectroscopic data, it is possible to identify correlations between theemission line variability and the light-curve modulation of the young system,such as the occurrence of pronounced redshifted absorption in the h_alpha lineat the epoch of minimum flux. this is evidence that during photometric minimawe see the accretion funnel projected onto the stellar photosphere in our lineof sight, implying that the hot spot coincides with the light-curve minima. weapplied models of cold and hot spots and a model of occultation bycircumstellar material to investigate the source of the observed photometricvariations. we conclude that nonuniformly distributed material in the innerpart of the circumstellar disk is the main cause of the photometric modulation,which does not exclude the presence of hot and cold spots at the stellarsurface. it is believed that the distortion in the inner part of the disk iscreated by the dynamical interaction between the stellar magnetosphere,inclined with respect to the rotation axis, and the circumstellar disk, as alsoobserved in the classical t tauri star aa tau and predicted bymagnetohydrodynamical numerical simulations.

astro-ph;0310381	characterising stellar micro-variability for planetary transit searches	(abridged) a method for simulating light curves containing stellarmicro-variability for a range of spectral types and ages, based onparameter-by-parameter scaling of a multi-component fit to the solar irradiancepower spectrum (from virgo/pmo6 data), and scaling laws derived from groundbased observations of various stellar samples, is presented.  we observe a correlation in the sun between the amplitude of the powerspectrum on weeks timescales and the bbso ca ii k-line index of chromosphericactivity. on the basis of this evidence, the chromospheric activity level,predicted from rotation period and b-v colour estimates according to therelationship first introduced by noyes(1983) and noyes et al. (1984), is usedto predict the variability power on weeks time scale. the rotation period isestimated on the basis of a fit to the distribution of rotation period versus$b-v$ observed in the hyades and the skumanich (1972) spin-down law. thecharacteristic timescale of the variability is also scaled according to therotation period.  we use this model to estimate the impact of the target star type and age onthe detection capability of missions such as eddington and kepler. k stars arefound to be the most promising targets, while the performance dropssignificantly for stars earlier than g and younger than 2.0 gyr. simulationsalso show that \emph{eddington} should detect terrestrial planets orbitingsolar-age stars in most of the habitable zone for g2 types and all of it for k0and k5 types.

astro-ph;0610507	x-rays from protostellar jets: emission from continuous flows	recently x-ray emission from protostellar jets has been detected with bothxmm-newton and chandra satellites, but the physical mechanism which can giverise to this emission is still unclear. we performed an extensive explorationof a wide space of the main parameters influencing the jet/ambient interaction.aims include: 1) to constrain the jet/ambient interaction regimes leading tothe x-ray emission observed in herbig-haro objects in terms of the emission bya shock forming at the interaction front between a continuous supersonic jetand the surrounding medium; 2) to derive detailed predictions to be comparedwith optical and x-ray observations of protostellar jets; 3) to get insightinto the protostellar jet's physical conditions. we performed a set ofbidimensional hydrodynamic numerical simulations, in cylindrical coordinates,modeling supersonic jets ramming a uniform ambient medium. the model takes intoaccount the most relevant physical effects, namely the thermal conduction andthe radiative losses. our model explains the observed x-ray emission fromprotostellar jets in a natural way. in particular we find that the case of aprotostellar jet less dense than the ambient medium reproduces well theobservations of the nearest herbig-haro object, hh154, and allows us to makedetailed predictions of a possible x-ray source proper motion (vsh = 500 km/s),detectable with chandra. furthermore our results suggest that the simulatedprotostellar jets which best reproduce the x-rays observations cannot drivemolecular outflows.

astro-ph;0611520	the onset of x-ray emission in young stellar objects: a chandra  observation of the serpens star-forming region	aims: to study the properties of x-ray emissions from young stellar objects(ysos), through their evolution from class i to class iii and determine whetherclass 0 protostars emit in x-rays. methods: a deep chandra x-ray observation ofthe serpens star-forming region was obtained. the serpens cloud core is ideallysuited for this type of investigation, being populated by a dense and extremelyyoung cluster whose members are found in all different evolutionary stages,including six well studied class 0 sources. results: none of the six class 0protostars is detected in our observations, excluding the presence of sourceswith x-ray luminosities &gt; 0.4 10^30 erg/s (for column densities of the order of4 10^{23} cm^-2, or a_v ~ 200). a total of 85 x-ray sources are detected andthe light curves and spectra of 35 ysos are derived. there is a clear trend ofdecreasing absorbing column densities as one moves from class i to class iiisources, and, possibly, evidence of decreasing plasma temperatures, too. weobserve a strong, long-duration, flare from a class ii low-mass star, for whichwe derive a flaring loop length of the order of 20 stellar radii. we interpretthe flaring event as originating from a magnetic flux tube connecting the starto its circumstellar disk. the presence of such a disk is supported by thedetection, in the spectrum of this star, of 6.4 kev fe fluorescent emission.

astro-ph;0701814	eclipsed x-ray flares in binary stars: geometrical constraints on the  flare's location and size	the observation of eclipses during x-rays flares taking place in active coolstars binaries allows us to calculate the position and size of the flares. thisinformation cannot be derived by analyzing the decay of the flares, afrequently used approach in the literature that requires the assumption of aphysical model. we make use of the eclipsing light curve to constrain the setof possible solutions, from the geometrical point of view, in two flares ofalgol, and one flare in vw cep. we make use of a technique developed with thesystem sv cam (i~90 deg) and generalize it to binary systems with arbitraryinclination. the method simulates all possible geometrical situations that canproduce the times of the four contacts of the eclipse. as an approximation weassume that the emitting region has a spherical shape that remains unchangedduring the eclipse. we however show that this is a good approximation for theproblem. the solutions observed indicate that in two of the three cases theflare cannot be polar (lat&lt;55 deg) and in a third one the flare can be placedeither near the pole or at other latitudes. the emitting regions must have asmall size (0.002-0.5 r_*), but if interpreted as the apex of coronal loops,their length could actually be up to 3.1 r_* for one of the algol flares. thesemeasurements imply a lower limit to the electron density in the emitting regionbetween log n_e(cm^-3) 10.4 and 14.0, and a magnetic field between 70 and 3500g. similar results are found if the emitting region is assumed to beloop-shaped.

astro-ph;0702529	habitat of early life: solar x-ray and uv radiation at earth's surface  4-3.5 billion years ago	solar x-ray and uv radiation (0.1-320 nm) received at earth's surface is animportant aspect of the circumstances under which life formed on earth. thequantity that is received depends on two main variables: the emission ofradiation by the young sun and its extinction through absorption and scatteringby the earth's early atmosphere. the spectrum emitted by the sun when lifeformed, between 4 and 3.5 ga, was modeled here, including the effects of flaresand activity cycles, using a solar-like star that has the same age now as thesun had 4-3.5 ga. atmospheric extinction was calculated using the beer-lambertlaw, assuming several density profiles for the atmosphere of the archean earth.we found that almost all radiation with a wavelength shorter than 200 nm isattenuated effectively, even by very tenuous atmospheres. longer-wavelengthradiation is progressively less well attenuated, and its extinction is moresensitive to atmospheric composition. minor atmospheric components, such asmethane, ozone, water vapor, etc., have only negligible effects, but changes inco2 concentration can cause large differences in surface flux. differences dueto variability in solar emission are small compared to this. in all casessurface radiation levels on the archean earth were several orders of magnitudehigher in the 200-300 nm wavelength range than current levels in this range.that means that any form of life that might have been present at earth'ssurface 4-3.5 ga must have been exposed to much higher quantities of damagingradiation than at present.

astro-ph;0703439	coronal abundances in orion nebula cluster stars	following the chandra orion ultradeep project (coup) observation, we havestudied the chemical composition of the hot plasma in a sample of 146 x-raybright pre-main sequence stars in the orion nebula cluster. we reportmeasurements of individual element abundances for a subsample of 86slightly-absorbed and bright x-ray sources, using low resolution x-ray spectraobtained from the chandra acis instrument. the x-ray emission originates from aplasma with temperatures and elemental abundances very similar to those ofactive coronae in older stars. a clear pattern of abundances vs. firstionization potential (fip) is evident if solar photospheric abundances areassumed as reference. the results are validated by extensive simulations. theobserved abundance distributions are compatible with a single pattern ofabundances for all stars, although a weak dependence on flare loop size may bepresent. the abundance of calcium is the only one which appears to varysubstantially between stars, but this quantity is affected by relatively largeuncertainties. the ensemble properties of the x-ray bright coup sources confirmthat the iron in the emitting plasma is underabundant with respect to both thesolar composition and to the average stellar photospheric values. comparison ofthe present plasma abundances with those of the stellar photospheres and thoseof the gaseous component of the nebula, indicates a good agreement for all theother elements with available measurements, and in particular for the high-fipelements (ne, ar, o, and s) and for the low-fip element si. we conclude thatthere is evidence of a significant chemical fractionation effect only for iron,which appears to be depleted by a factor 1.5--3 with respect to the stellarcomposition.

astro-ph;0703619	the coronal structure of ab dor determined from contemporaneous doppler  imaging and x-ray spectroscopy	we obtain contemporaneous observations of the surface and corona of ab dorusing ground-based circularly polarised spectra from the anglo-australiantelescope and x-ray data from the chandra satellite. the ground-based data areused to construct surface magnetic field maps, which are extrapolated toproduce detailed models of the quiescent corona. the x-ray data serve as a newtest for the validity of these coronal models.  the high coronal density and complex multi-polar magnetic field indicate acompact x-ray corona, which is concentrated close to the surface, with aheight, h~0.3-0.4r*. there is also significant correlation between the surfaceand coronal active region locations. at this epoch ab dor appears to possessone very large active longitude region; displaying enhanced activity in theform of large dark spots, strong magnetic fields and chromospheric emission.  finally, the level of rotational modulation and shape of the x-ray lightcurvedepend on the distribution of magnetic field in the obscured hemisphere. themodels that best reproduce the rotational modulation observed in thecontemporaneous chandra x-ray lightcurve and spectra require the magnetic fieldin the obscured hemisphere to be of the same polarity as that in the observedhemisphere. the sun shows different behaviour, with the leading polarityreversed in the opposite hemisphere. the x-ray observations provide a uniqueconstraint on the magnetic structure in the obscured hemisphere.

astro-ph;9707057	on the widespread weak-line t-tauri population detected in the rosat  all-sky survey	we discuss the apparent widespread presence of weak-line t-tauri stars (wtts)among stellar coronal sources detected in the rosat all-sky survey (rass), andtheir relative number with respect to young main-sequence stars in the samesamples. the approach taken in most of the current literature for identifyingand classifying wtt stars among rass x-ray sources is based on the usage oflow-resolution optical spectra only and on simple, mass-independent thresholdson the equivalent width of the lii 6707.8 a doublet. we show that this approachis likely to lead to putative wtts samples which contain a large number ofnormal, young main-sequence stars masquerading as wtts sources. youngmain-sequence stars are known to be the dominant contributor in stellar x-rayselected samples at the limiting flux levels of the rass, yet they appear to bevery rare in the rass samples discussed here. we argue that many of theputative wtts sources are actually mis-classified young main-sequence stars,and that thus there is likely not a true ``wtts question'' in the rass samples.

astro-ph;9707058	on coronal abundances derived with the sax/lecs and asca/sis detectors	we have studied the performance of global chi^2 fitting of low-resolutionx-ray spectra in retrieving intrinsic source parameters, with emphasis on thecoronal metallicity. the study has been conducted by fitting large numbers ofsimulated spectra with known characteristics, and studying the distribution ofbest-fit parameters. we have studied the behavior of the lecs detector on boardthe sax satellite and the sis detector on board the asca satellite. the fittedsource spectra have either two discrete temperature components or a power-lawtemperature distribution, with metallicity variations modeled by a singleglobal abundance parameter. the model used for the fitting has always been atwo-temperature one, with global varying abundance, to explore the influence ofthe a priori ignorance of the actual temperature stratification in the sourcebeing observed. the simulations performed explore the influence of varyingstatistics in the observed spectrum (spanning a realistic range of values) aswell as the effect of varying the intrinsic source metallicity, with values inthe range 0.15--1.0 times the solar value. we find that the source metallicitycan be retrieved within few tens of percent from asca/sis spectra of typicalsignal to noise ratio, and within few percent from sax/lecs spectra at the samesignal to noise ratio. however relatively small uncertainties in the detectorcalibrations and in the plasma emission codes are likely to potentially causelarge systematic off-sets in the value

astro-ph;9707061	a sax/lecs x-ray observation of the active binary capella	we present a sax/lecs x-ray observation of the active binary capella, thefirst coronal source observed in the sax guest investigator program. theanalysis of this observation, performed using the mekal plasma emission code,shows that the lecs spectrum is well fit by a two-component optically-thinplasma model. a differential emission measure (dem) obtained by directinversion of the x-ray spectrum shows no additional features in addition to thedouble-peaked structure implied by the direct two-temperature analysis. such asimple temperature stratification is however not compatible with the euveemission from the same object, which is well represented by a more complex dem,with a power-law-like tail toward the low temperatures. at the same time, theeuve-derived dem predicts well the softer part of the capella lecs spectrum,but it fails to correctly reproduce the higher energy part of the capella lecsspectrum. possible causes for this discrepancy are discussed. the coronalmetallicity derived from the sax observation is compatible both with theeuve-derived metallicity as well as with the photospheric metallicity ofcapella, thus showing no evidence for coronal under-abundances.

astro-ph;9709248	a bepposax observation of the x-ray pulsar 1e 2259+586 and the supernova  remnant g109.1-1.0 (ctb 109)	the 7 s x-ray pulsar 1e2259+586 and the supernova remnant (snr) g109.1-1.0(ctb 109) were observed by bepposax in 1996 november. the pulse period of6.978914 +/- 0.000006 s implies that the source continues its near constantspin-down trend. the 0.5-10 kev pulse shape is characterized by a double peakedprofile, with the amplitude of the second peak ~50% of that of the main peak.the pulse profile does not exhibit any strong energy dependence. we confirm theasca discovery of an additional low-energy spectral component from 1e2259+586.this can best be modeled as a 0.44 kev blackbody, but we cannot exclude thatsome, or all, of this emission arises from the part of the snr that lies withinthe pulsar's extraction region.  the spectrum of g109.1-1.0 is well fit with a non-equilibrium ionizationplasma model with a best-fit temperature of 0.95 kev. the derived mass for thex-ray emitting plasma (~15-20 solar masses) and its near cosmic abundancesimply that the x-ray emission comes mainly from mildly enriched, swept-upcircumstellar material. the spectrum is strongly out of equilibrium with anionization age of only 3000 yr. this age is in good agreement with that derivedfrom hydrodynamic simulations of the snr using the above x-ray temperature.

astro-ph;9903109	the low-energy cosmic x-ray background spectrum observed by the bepposax  lecs	the spectrum of the 0.1-7.0 kev cosmic x-ray background (cxb) at galacticlatitudes &gt;|25| degrees has been measured using the bepposax low-energyspectrometer concentrator (lecs). above 1 kev the spectrum is consistent with apower-law of photon index 1.47 +/- 0.10 and normalization 11.0 +/- 0.8 photoncm^-2 s^-1 kev^-1 sr^-1 at 1kev. the overall spectrum can be modeled by apower-law with 2 thermal components, or by a broken power-law and a singlethermal component. in both cases the softer thermal emission dominates at lessthan 0.3 kev and is seen through a column of a few 10^19 atom cm^-2. the othercomponents have columns consistent with the mean line of sight value. the metalabundances for the thermal components are poorly constrained, but consistentwith cosmic values. the power-law together with 2 thermal components model hasbeen used to fit recent combined asca and rosat cxb measurements. here, thesoft thermal component is interpreted as emission from the local hot bubble andthe hard thermal component as emission from a more distant absorbed region.while such a 2 component thermal model is consistent with the lecs spectrum, itis not required, and the hard thermal component may result from inadequatemodeling of the extragalactic contribution. the observed low-energy spectralcomplexity may therefore originate primarily in the local hot bubble. there isno evidence for the presence of a very soft cxb component with a temperature&lt;0.1 kev. the emission measure seen by rosat is rejected at 90% confidence.

astro-ph;9909040	continuous heating of a giant x-ray flare on algol	giant flares can release large amounts of energy within a few days: x-rayemission alone can be up to ten percent of the star's bolometric luminosity.these flares exceed the luminosities of the largest solar flares by many ordersof magnitude, which suggests that the underlying physical mechanisms supplyingthe energy are different from those on the sun. magnetic coupling between thecomponents in a binary system or between a young star and an accretion disk hasbeen proposed as a prerequisite for giant flares. here we report x-rayobservations of a giant flare on algol b, a giant star in an eclipsing binarysystem. we observed a total x-ray eclipse of the flare, which demonstrates thatthe plasma was confined to algol b, and reached a maximum height of 0.6 stellarradii above its surface. the flare occurred around the south pole of algol b,and energy must have been released continously throughout its life. we concludethat a specific extrastellar environment is not required for the presence of aflare, and that the processes at work are therefore similar to those on thesun.

astro-ph;9909041	spectroscopic analysis of a super-hot giant flare observed on algol by  bepposax on 30 august 1997	we present an x-ray observation of the eclipsing binary algol, obtained withthe bepposax observatory. during the observation a huge flare was observed,exceptional both in duration as well as in peak plasma temperature and totalenergy release. the wide spectral response of the different bepposaxinstruments, together with the long decay time scale of the flare, allowed usto perform a detailed time-resolved x-ray spectroscopic analysis of the flare.we derive the physical parameters of the emitting region together with theplasma density applying different methods to the observed flare decay. thex-ray emission from the flare is totally eclipsed during the secondary opticaleclipse, so that the size of the emitting region is strongly constrained (asdescribed in a companion paper) on purely geometrical arguments. the size ofthe flare thus derived is much smaller than the size derived from the analysisof the evolution of the spectral parameters using the quasi-static coolingformalism, showing that the time evolution of the flare is determinedessentially from the temporal profile of the heating, with the intrinsic decayof the flaring loop having little relevance. the very high signal-to-noise ofthe individual spectra strongly constrains some of the derived physicalparameters. in particular, very significant evidence for a three-fold increasein coronal abundance and for a large increase in absorbing column densityduring the initial phases of the flare evolution is present.

astro-ph;9909491	an extreme x-ray flare observed on ev lac by asca in july 1998	we present a long (150 ks elapsed time) asca x-ray observation of the dm3.5estar ev lac, during which an exceptionally intense flaring event (lastingapproximately 12 ks) was observed: at the flare's peak, the x-ray count rate inthe asca gis detectors was approx. 300 times the quiescent value. the physicalparameters of the flaring region have been derived by analyzing the decay,using both a quasi-static approach and an approach based on hydrodynamicsimulations of decaying flaring loops. this second method shows that theflare's decay is compatible with its being produced in a relatively compactregion of semi-length l approx. 0.5 stellar radii), large but not exceptionaleven by solar standards. the flare decays is fast (with a e-folding time forthe light curve of &lt;= 2 ks), but nevertheless the hydrodynamic-based analysisshows strong evidence for sustained heating, with the shape of the light curvedominated by the time evolution of the heating rather than by the naturalcooling of the flaring plasma. the quasi-static method yields a much largerestimate of the loop's length (l approx. 2 stellar radii). the event shows alight curve characterized by two separate decay time constants (with theinitial decay being faster) and a significant enhancement in the plasma metalabundance at the peak of the flare. the energetics of the event areexceptional, with the peak x-ray luminosity of the event reaching up to approx.25% of the bolometric luminosity of the star, making this one of the largestx-ray flare (in relative terms) observed to date on a main-sequence star.
