0904.4256	doublets and double peaks: late-time [o i] 6300, 6364 line profiles of  stripped-envelope, core-collapse supernovae	we present optical spectra of sn 2007gr, sn 2007rz, sn 2007uy, sn 2008ax, andsn 2008bo obtained in the nebular phase when line profiles can lead toinformation about the velocity distribution of the exploded cores. we comparethese to 13 other published spectra of stripped-envelope core-collapsesupernovae (type iib, ib, and ic) to investigate properties of theirdouble-peaked [o i] 6300, 6364 emission. these 18 supernovae are divided intotwo empirical line profile types: (1) profiles showing two conspicuous emissionpeaks nearly symmetrically centered on either side of 6300 angstroms and spacedapproximately 64 angstroms apart, close to the wavelength separation betweenthe [o i] 6300, 6364 doublet lines, and (2) profiles showing asymmetric [o i]line profiles consisting of a pronounced emission peak near 6300 angstroms plusone or more blueshifted emission peaks. examination of these emission profiles,as well as comparison with profiles in the lines of [o i] 5577, o i 7774, andmg i] 4571, leads us to conclude that neither type of [o i] double-peakedprofile is necessarily the signature of emission from front and rear faces ofejecta arranged in a toroidal disk or elongated shell geometry as previouslysuggested. we propose possible alternative interpretations of double-peakedemission for each profile type, test their feasibility with simple line-fittingmodels, and discuss their strengths and weaknesses. the underlying cause of theobserved predominance of blueshifted emission peaks is unclear, but may be dueto internal scattering or dust obscuration of emission from far side ejecta.

0908.2817	a relativistic type ibc supernova without a detected gamma-ray burst	long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) mark the explosive death of somemassive stars and are a rare sub-class of type ibc supernovae (sne ibc). theyare distinguished by the production of an energetic and collimated relativisticoutflow powered by a central engine (an accreting black hole or neutron star).observationally, this outflow is manifested in the pulse of gamma-rays and along-lived radio afterglow. to date, central engine-driven sne have beendiscovered exclusively through their gamma-ray emission, yet it is expectedthat a larger population goes undetected due to limited satellite sensitivityor beaming of the collimated emission away from our line-of-sight. in thisframework, the recovery of undetected grbs may be possible through radiosearches for sne ibc with relativistic outflows. here we report the discoveryof luminous radio emission from the seemingly ordinary type ibc sn 2009bb,which requires a substantial relativistic outflow powered by a central engine.the lack of a coincident grb makes sn 2009bb the first engine-driven sndiscovered without a detected gamma-ray signal. a comparison with our extensiveradio survey of sne ibc reveals that the fraction harboring central engines islow, ~1 percent, measured independently from, but consistent with, the inferredrate of nearby grbs. our study demonstrates that upcoming optical and radiosurveys will soon rival gamma-ray satellites in pinpointing the nearestengine-driven sne. a similar result for a different supernova is reportedindependently.

0908.2818	the high-metallicity explosion environment of the relativistic supernova  2009bb	we investigate the environment of the nearby (d ~ 40mpc) broad-lined type icsupernova sn 2009bb. this event was observed to produce a relativistic outflowlikely powered by a central accreting compact object. while such a phenomenonwas previously observed only in long-duration gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs), no lgrbwas detected in association with sn 2009bb. using an optical spectrum of the sn2009bb explosion site, we determine a variety of ism properties for the hostenvironment, including metallicity, young stellar population age, and starformation rate. we compare the sn explosion site properties to observations oflgrb and broad-lined sn ic host environments on optical emission line ratiodiagnostic diagrams. based on these analyses, we find that the sn 2009bbexplosion site has a very high metallicity of ~2x solar, in agreement withother broad-lined sn ic host environments and at odds with the low-redshiftlgrb host environments and recently proposed maximum metallicity limits forrelativistic explosions. we consider the implications of these findings and theimpact that sn 2009bb's unusual explosive properties and environment have onour understanding of the key physical ingredient that enables some sne toproduce a relativistic outflow.

0911.2002	pushing the boundaries of conventional core-collapse supernovae: the  extremely energetic supernova sn 2003ma	we report the discovery of a supernova (sn) with the highest apparent energyoutput to date and conclude that it represents an extreme example of the typeiin subclass. the sn, which was discovered behind the large magellanic cloud atz = 0.289 by the supermacho microlensing survey, peaked at m_r = -21.5 mag andonly declined by 2.9 mag over 4.7 years after the peak. over this period, sn2003ma had an integrated bolometric luminosity of 4 x 10^51 ergs, more than anyother sn to date. the radiated energy is close to the limit allowed byconventional core-collapse explosions. optical spectra reveal that sn 2003mahas persistent single-peaked intermediate-width hydrogen lines, a signature ofinteraction between the sn and a dense circumstellar medium. the light curvesshow further evidence for circumstellar interaction, including a long plateauwith a shape very similar to the classic sn iin 1988z -- however, sn 2003ma isten times more luminous at all epochs. the fast velocity measured for theintermediate-width h_alpha component (~6000 km/s) points towards an extremelyenergetic explosion (&gt; 10^52 ergs), which imparts a faster blast-wave speed tothe post-shock material and a higher luminosity from the interaction than isobserved in typical sne iin. mid-infrared observations of sn 2003ma suggest aninfrared light echo is produced by normal interstellar dust at a distance ~0.5pc from the sn.

1102.4568	the chandra acis survey of m33 (chasem33): the final source catalog	this study presents the final source catalog of the chandra acis survey ofm33 (chasem33). with a total exposure time of 1.4 ms, chasem33 covers ~70% ofthe d25 isophote (r\approx4kpc) of m33 and provides the deepest, most complete,and detailed look at a spiral galaxy in x-rays. the source catalog includes 662sources, reaches a limiting unabsorbed luminosity of ~2.4x10^(34) erg/s in the0.35-8.0kev energy band, and contains source positions, source net counts,fluxes and significances in several energy bands, and information on sourcevariability. the analysis challenges posed by chasem33 and the techniquesadopted to address these challenges are discussed. to constrain the nature ofthe detected x-ray source, hardness ratios were constructed and spectra werefit for 254 sources, followup mmt spectra of 116 sources were acquired, andcross-correlations with previous x-ray catalogs and other multi-wavelength datawere generated. based on this effort, 183 of the 662 chasem33 sources could beidentified. finally, the luminosity function for the detected point sources aswell as the one for the x-ray binaries in m33 is presented. the luminosityfunctions in the soft band (0.5-2.0 kev) and the hard band (2.0-8.0 kev) have alimiting luminosity at the 90% completeness limit of 4.0x10^(34) erg/s and1.6x10^(35) erg/s (for d=817kpc), respectively, which is significantly lowerthan what was reported by previous x-ray binary population studies in galaxiesmore distant than m33. the resulting distribution is consistent with a dominantpopulation of high mass x-ray binaries as would be expected for m33.

0710.2338	constraining cosmic evolution of type ia supernovae	we present the first large-scale effort of creating composite spectra ofhigh-redshift type ia supernovae (sne ia) and comparing them to low-redshiftcounterparts. through the essence project, we have obtained 107 spectra of 88high-redshift sne ia with excellent light-curve information. in addition, wehave obtained 397 spectra of low-redshift sne through a multiple-decade effortat lick and keck observatories, and we have used 45 uv spectra obtained byhst/iue. the low-redshift spectra act as a control sample when comparing to theessence spectra. in all instances, the essence and lick composite spectraappear very similar. the addition of galaxy light to the lick composite spectraallows a nearly perfect match of the overall spectral-energy distribution withthe essence composite spectra, indicating that the high-redshift sne are morecontaminated with host-galaxy light than their low-redshift counterparts. thisis caused by observing objects at all redshifts with the same slit width, whichcorresponds to different projected distances. after correcting for thegalaxy-light contamination, subtle differences in the spectra remain. we haveestimated the systematic errors when using current spectral templates fork-corrections to be ~0.02 mag. the variance in the composite spectra give anestimate of the intrinsic variance in low-redshift maximum-light sn spectra of~3% in the optical and growing toward the uv. the difference between themaximum light low and high-redshift spectra constrain sn evolution between oursamples to be &lt; 10% in the rest-frame optical.

1203.0006	late-time optical emission from core-collapse supernovae	ground-based optical spectra and hubble space telescope images of tencore-collapse supernovae (ccsne) obtained several years to decades afteroutburst are analyzed with the aim of understanding the general properties oftheir late-time emissions. new observations of sn 1957d, 1970g, 1980k, and1993j are included as part of the study. blueshifted line emissions in oxygenand/or hydrogen with conspicuous line substructure are a common andlong-lasting phenomenon in the late-time spectra. followed through multipleepochs, changes in the relative strengths and velocity widths of the emissionlines are consistent with expectations for emissions produced by interactionbetween sn ejecta and the progenitor star's circumstellar material. the mostdistinct trend is an increase in the strength of [o iii]/([o i]+[o ii]) withage, and a decline in halpha/([o i]+[o ii]) which is broadly consistent withthe view that the reverse shock has passed through the h envelope of the ejectain many of these objects. we also present a spatially integrated spectrum ofthe young galactic supernova remnant cassiopeia a (cas a). similaritiesobserved between the emission line profiles of the 330 yr old cas a remnant anddecades old ccsne suggest that observed emission line asymmetry in evolved ccsnspectra may be associated with dust in the ejecta, and that minor peaksubstructure typically interpreted as 'clumps' or 'blobs' of ejecta may insteadbe linked with large-scale rings of sn debris.

1203.4832	the spectroscopic diversity of type ia supernovae	we present 2603 spectra of 462 nearby type ia supernovae (sn ia) obtainedduring 1993-2008 through the center for astrophysics supernova program. most ofthe spectra were obtained with the fast spectrograph at the flwo 1.5m telescopeand reduced in a consistent manner, making data set well suited for studies ofsn ia spectroscopic diversity. we study the spectroscopic and photometricproperties of sn ia as a function of spectroscopic class using theclassification schemes of branch et al. and wang et al. the width-luminosityrelation appears to be steeper for sn ia with broader lines. based on theevolution of the characteristic si ii 6355 line, we propose improved methodsfor measuring velocity gradients, revealing a larger range than previouslysuspected, from ~0 to ~400 km/s/day considering the instantaneous velocitydecline rate at maximum light. we find a weaker and less significantcorrelation between si ii velocity and intrinsic b-v color at maximum lightthan reported by foley et al., owing to a more comprehensive treatment ofuncertainties and host galaxy dust. we study the extent of nuclear burning andreport new detections of c ii 6580 in 23 early-time spectra. the frequency of cii detections is not higher in sn ia with bluer colors or narrower lightcurves, in conflict with the recent results of thomas et al. based on nebularspectra of 27 sn ia, we find no relation between the fwhm of the iron emissionfeature at ~4700 a and dm15(b) after removing the two low-luminosity sn 1986gand sn 1991bg, suggesting that the peak luminosity is not strongly dependent onthe kinetic energy of the explosion for most sn ia. finally, we confirm thecorrelation of velocity shifts in some nebular lines with the intrinsic b-vcolor of sn ia at maximum light, although several outliers suggest a possiblenon-monotonic behavior for the largest blueshifts.

1302.0009	ps1-10afx at z=1.388: pan-starrs1 discovery of a new type of  superluminous supernova	we present the pan-starrs1 discovery of ps1-10afx, a uniquehydrogen-deficient superluminous supernova (slsn) at z=1.388. the light curvepeaked at z_p1=21.7 mag, making ps1-10afx comparable to the most luminous knownsne, with m_u = -22.3 mag. our extensive optical and nir observations indicatethat the bolometric light curve of ps1-10afx rose on the unusually fasttimescale of ~12 d to the extraordinary peak luminosity of 4.1e44 erg/s (m_bol= -22.8 mag) and subsequently faded rapidly. equally important, the sed isunusually red for a slsn, with a color temperature of 6800 k near maximumlight, in contrast to previous h-poor slsne, which are bright in the uv. thespectra more closely resemble those of a normal sn ic than any known slsn, witha photospheric velocity of 11,000 km/s and evidence for line blanketing in therest-frame uv. despite the fast rise, these parameters imply a very largeemitting radius (&gt;5e15 cm). we demonstrate that no existing theoretical modelcan satisfactorily explain this combination of properties: (i) a nickel-poweredlight curve cannot match the combination of high peak luminosity with the fasttimescale; (ii) models powered by the spindown energy of a rapidly-rotatingmagnetar predict significantly hotter and faster ejecta; and (iii) modelsinvoking shock breakout through a dense circumstellar medium cannot explain theobserved spectra or color evolution. the host galaxy is well detected inpre-explosion imaging with a luminosity near l*, a star formation rate of 15m_sun/yr, and is fairly massive (2e10 m_sun), with a stellar population age of1e8 yr, also in contrast to the dwarf hosts of known h-poor slsne. ps1-10afx isdistinct from known examples of slsne in its spectra, colors, light-curveshape, and host galaxy properties, suggesting that it resulted from a differentchannel than other hydrogen-poor slsne.

0712.2759	infrared and x-ray evidence for circumstellar grain destruction by the  blast wave of supernova 1987a	multiwavelength observations of supernova remnant (snr) 1987a show that itsmorphology and luminosity are rapidly changing at x-ray, optical, infrared, andradio wavelengths as the blast wave from the explosion expands into thecircumstellar equatorial ring, produced by mass loss from the progenitor star.the observed infrared (ir) radiation arises from the interaction of dust grainsthat formed in mass outflow with the soft x-ray emitting plasma component ofthe shocked gas. spitzer irs spectra at 5 - 30 microns taken on day 6190 sincethe explosion show that the emission arises from ~ 1.1e-6 msun of silicategrains radiating at a temperature of ~180+20-15 k. subsequent observations onday 7137 show that the ir flux had increased by a factor of 2 while maintainingan almost identical spectral shape. the observed ir-to-x-ray flux ratio (irx)is consistent with that of a dusty plasma with standard large magellanic clouddust abundances. irx has decreased by a factor of ~ 2 between days 6190 and7137, providing the first direct observation of the ongoing destruction of dustin an expanding sn blast wave on dynamic time scales. detailed modelsconsistent with the observed dust temperature, the ionization timescale of thesoft x-ray emission component, and the evolution of irx suggest that theradiating silicate grains are immersed in a 3.5e6 k plasma with a density of(0.3-1)e4 cm^{-3}, and have a size distribution that is confined to a narrowrange of radii between 0.023 and 0.22 microns. smaller grains may have beenevaporated by the initial uv flash from the supernova.

1306.0038	a panchromatic view of the restless sn2009ip reveals the explosive  ejection of a massive star envelope	the 2012 explosion of sn2009ip raises questions about our understanding ofthe late stages of massive star evolution. here we present a comprehensivestudy of sn2009ip during its remarkable re-brightening(s). high-cadencephotometric and spectroscopic observations from the gev to the radio bandobtained from a variety of ground-based and space facilities (including thevla, swift, fermi, hst and xmm) constrain sn2009ip to be a low energy (e~ 10^50erg for an ejecta mass ~ 0.5 msun) and likely asymmetric explosion in a complexmedium shaped by multiple eruptions of the restless progenitor star. most ofthe energy is radiated as a result of the shock breaking out through a denseshell of material located at 5x10^14 cm with m~0.1 msun, ejected by theprecursor outburst ~40 days before the major explosion. we interpret the nirexcess of emission as signature of dust vaporization of material locatedfurther out (r&gt;4x 10^15 cm), the origin of which has to be connected withdocumented mass loss episodes in the previous years. our modeling predictsbright neutrino emission associated with the shock break-out if the cosmic rayenergy is comparable to the radiated energy. we connect this phenomenology withthe explosive ejection of the outer layers of the massive progenitor star, thatlater interacted with material deposited in the surroundings by previouseruptions. future observations will reveal if the luminous blue variable (lbv)progenitor star survived. irrespective of whether the explosion was terminal,sn2009ip brought to light the existence of new channels for sustained episodicmass-loss, the physical origin of which has yet to be identified.

1306.2337	the fast and furious decay of the peculiar type ic supernova 2005ek	we present extensive multi-wavelength observations of the extremely rapidlydeclining type ic supernova, sn 2005ek. reaching a peak magnitude of m_r =-17.3 and decaying by ~3 mag in the first 15 days post-maximum, sn 2005ek isamong the fastest type i supernovae observed to date. the spectra of sn 2005ekclosely resemble those of normal sn ic, but with an accelerated evolution.there is evidence for the onset of nebular features at only nine dayspost-maximum. spectroscopic modeling reveals an ejecta mass of ~0.3 msun thatis dominated by oxygen (~80%), while the pseudo-bolometric light curve isconsistent with an explosion powered by ~0.03 msun of radioactive ni-56.although previous rapidly evolving events (e.g., sn 1885a, sn 1939b, sn 2002bj,sn 2010x) were hypothesized to be produced by the detonation of a helium shellon a white dwarf, oxygen-dominated ejecta are difficult to reconcile with thisproposed mechanism. we find that the properties of sn 2005ek are consistentwith either the edge-lit double detonation of a low-mass white dwarf or theiron-core collapse of a massive star, stripped by binary interaction. however,if we assume that the strong spectroscopic similarity of sn 2005ek to other snic is an indication of a similar progenitor channel, then a white-dwarfprogenitor becomes very improbable. sn 2005ek may be one of the lowest massstripped-envelope core-collapse explosions ever observed. we find that the rateof such rapidly declining type i events is at least 1-3% of the normal sn iarate.

1404.2004	towards characterization of the type iip supernova progenitor  population: a statistical sample of light curves from pan-starrs1	in recent years, wide-field sky surveys providing deep multi-band imaginghave presented a new path for indirectly characterizing the progenitorpopulations of core-collapse supernovae (sn): systematic light curve studies.we assemble a set of 76 grizy-band type iip sn light curves from pan-starrs1,obtained over a constant survey program of 4 years and classified using bothspectroscopy and machine learning-based photometric techniques. we develop andapply a new bayesian model for the full multi-band evolution of each lightcurve in the sample. we find no evidence of a sub-population of fast-decliningexplosions (historically referred to as "type iil" sne). however, we identify ahighly significant relation between the plateau phase decay rate and peakluminosity among our sne iip. these results argue in favor of a singleparameter, likely determined by initial stellar mass, predominantly controllingthe explosions of red supergiants. this relation could also be applied forsupernova cosmology, offering a standardizable candle good to an intrinsicscatter of 0.2 mag. we compare each light curve to physical models fromhydrodynamic simulations to estimate progenitor initial masses and otherproperties of the pan-starrs1 type iip sn sample. we show that correction ofsystematic discrepancies between modeled and observed sn iip light curveproperties and an expanded grid of progenitor properties, are needed to enablerobust progenitor inferences from multi-band light curve samples of this kind.this work will serve as a pathfinder for photometric studies of core-collapsesne to be conducted through future wide field transient searches.

0803.0419	xmm-newton slew survey discovery of the nova xmmsl1 j070542.7-381442  (v598 pup)	in an attempt to catch new x-ray transients while they are still bright, thedata taken by xmm-newton as it slews between targets is being processed andcross-correlated with other x-ray observations as soon as the slew data appearsin the xmm-newton archive.  a bright source, xmmsl1 j070542.7-381442, was detected on 9 oct 2007 at aposition where no previous x-ray source had been seen. the xmm slew data andoptical data acquired with the magellan clay 6.5m telescope were used toclassify the new object.  no xmm slew x-ray counts are detected above 1kev and the source is seen to be~750 times brighter than the rosat all-sky survey upper limit at that position.the normally m(v)~16 star, usno-a2.0 0450-03360039, which lies 3.5" from thex-ray position, was seen in our magellan data to be very much enhanced inbrightness. our optical spectrum showed emission lines which identified thesource as a nova in the auroral phase. hence this optical source is undoubtedlythe progenitor of the x-ray source - a new nova (now also known as v598 pup).the x-ray spectrum indicates that the nova was in a super-soft state (withkt(eff)~35ev). we estimate the distance to the nova to be ~3kpc. analysis ofarchival robotic optical survey data shows a rapid decline light curveconsistent with that expected for a very fast nova.  the xmm-newton slew data present a powerful opportunity to find new x-raytransient objects while they are still bright. here we present the first suchsource discovered by the analysis of near real-time slew data.

1405.3677	extensive hst ultraviolet spectra and multi-wavelength observations of  sn 2014j in m82 indicate reddening and circumstellar scattering by typical  dust	sn 2014j in m82 is the closest detected type ia supernova (sn ia) in at least28 years and perhaps in 410 years. despite its small distance of 3.3 mpc, sn2014j is surprisingly faint, peaking at v = 10.6 mag, and assuming a typical snia luminosity, we infer an observed visual extinction of a_v = 2.0 +/- 0.1 mag.but this picture, with r_v = 1.6 +/- 0.2, is too simple to account for allobservations. we combine 10 epochs (spanning a month) of hst/stis ultravioletthrough near-infrared spectroscopy with hst/wfc3, kait, and fancam photometryfrom the optical to the infrared and 9 epochs of high-resolution tresspectroscopy to investigate the sources of extinction and reddening for sn2014j. we argue that the wide range of observed properties for sn 2014j iscaused by a combination of dust reddening, likely originating in theinterstellar medium of m82, and scattering off circumstellar material. for thismodel, roughly half of the extinction is caused by reddening from typical dust(e(b-v ) = 0.45 mag and r_v = 2.6) and roughly half by scattering off lmc-likedust in the circumstellar environment of sn 2014j.

0805.2201	from shock breakout to peak and beyond: extensive panchromatic  observations of the type ib supernova 2008d associated with swift x-ray  transient 080109	we present extensive early photometric (ultraviolet through near-infrared)and spectroscopic (optical and near-infrared) data on supernova (sn) 2008d aswell as x-ray data analysis on the associated swift/x-ray transient (xrt)080109. our data span a time range of 5 hours before the detection of the x-raytransient to 150 days after its detection, and detailed analysis allowed us toderive constraints on the nature of the sn and its progenitor; throughout wedraw comparisons with results presented in the literature and find several keyaspects that differ. we show that the x-ray spectrum of xrt 080109 can be fitequally well by an absorbed power law or a superposition of about equal partsof both power law and blackbody. our data first established that sn 2008d is aspectroscopically normal sn ib (i.e., showing conspicuous he lines), and showthat sn 2008d had a relatively long rise time of 18 days and a modest opticalpeak luminosity. the early-time light curves of the sn are dominated by acooling stellar envelope (for \delta t~0.1- 4 day, most pronounced in the bluebands) followed by 56^ni decay. we construct a reliable measurement of thebolometric output for this stripped-envelope sn, and, combined with estimatesof e_k and m_ej from the literature, estimate the stellar radius r_star of itsprobable wolf-rayet progenitor. according to the model of waxman et al. and ofchevalier &amp; fransson, we derive r_star^{w07}= 1.2+/-0.7 r_sun andr_star^{cf08}= 12+/-7 r_sun, respectively; the latter being more in line withtypical wn stars. spectra obtained at 3 and 4 months after maximum light showdouble-peaked oxygen lines that we associate with departures from sphericalsymmetry, as has been suggested for the inner ejecta of a number of sn ibcores.

0805.4607	scattered-light echoes from the historical galactic supernovae  cassiopeia a and tycho (sn 1572)	we report the discovery of an extensive system of scattered light echoarclets associated with the recent supernovae in the local neighbourhood of themilky way: tycho (sn 1572) and cassiopeia a. existing work suggests that thetycho sn was a thermonuclear explosion while the cas a supernova was a corecollapse explosion. precise classifications according to modern nomenclaturerequire spectra of the outburst light. in the case of ancient sne, this canonly be done with spectroscopy of their light echo, where the discovery of thelight echoes from the outburst light is the first step. adjacent light echopositions suggest that cas a and tycho may share common scattering duststructures. if so, it is possible to measure precise distances betweenhistorical galactic supernovae. on-going surveys that alert on the developmentof bright scattered-light echo features have the potential to reveal detailedspectroscopic information for many recent galactic supernovae, both directlyvisible and obscured by dust in the galactic plane.

1511.01907	metamorphosis of sn 2014c: delayed interaction between a hydrogen poor  core-collapse supernova and a nearby circumstellar shell	we present optical observations of supernova sn 2014c, which underwent anunprecedented slow metamorphosis from h-poor type ib to h-rich type iin overthe course of one year. the observed spectroscopic evolution is consistent withthe supernova having exploded in a cavity before encountering a massive shellof the progenitor star's stripped hydrogen envelope. possible origins for thecircumstellar shell include a brief wolf-rayet fast wind phase that overtook aslower red supergiant wind, eruptive ejection, or confinement of circumstellarmaterial by external influences of neighboring stars. an extended high velocityhalpha absorption feature seen in near-maximum light spectra implies that theprogenitor star was not completely stripped of hydrogen at the time of corecollapse. archival pre-explosion subaru telescope suprime-cam and hubble spacetelescope wide field planetary camera 2 images of the region obtained in 2009show a coincident source that is most likely a compact massive star cluster inngc 7331 that hosted the progenitor system. by comparing the emissionproperties of the source with stellar population models that incorporateinteracting binary stars we estimate the age of the host cluster to be 30 - 300myr, and favor ages closer to 30 myr in light of relatively strong halphaemission. sn 2014c is the best-observed member of a class of core-collapsesupernovae that fill the gap between events that interact strongly with dense,nearby environments immediately after explosion and those that never show signsof interaction. better understanding of the frequency and nature of thisintermediate population can contribute valuable information about the poorlyunderstood final stages of stellar evolution.

astro-ph;0205337	the axially symmetric ejecta of supernova 1987a	extensive early observations proved that the ejecta of supernova 1987a (sn1987a) are aspherical. fifteen years after the supernova explosion, the hubblespace telescope has resolved the rapidly expanding ejecta. the late-time imagesand spectroscopy provide a geometrical picture that is consistent with earlyobservations and suggests a highly structured, axially symmetric geometry. wepresent here a new synthesis of the old and new data. we show that the bochumevent, presumably a clump of $^{56}$ni, and the late-time image, the locus ofexcitation by $^{44}$ti, are most naturally accounted for by sharing a commonposition angle of about 14\degree, the same as the mystery spot and earlyspeckle data on the ejecta, and that they are both oriented along the axis ofthe inner circumstellar ring at 45\degree to the plane of the sky. we alsodemonstrate that the polarization represents a prolate geometry with the sameposition angle and axis as the early speckle data and the late-time image andhence that the geometry has been fixed in time and throughout the ejecta. thebochum event and the doppler kinematics of the [ca ii]/[o ii] emission inspatially resolved hst spectra of the ejecta can be consistently integratedinto this geometry. the radioactive clump is deduced to fall approximatelyalong the axis of the inner circumstellar ring and therefore to be redshiftedin the north whereas the [ca ii]/[o ii] 7300 \aa emission is redshifted in thesouth. we present a jet-induced model for the explosion and argue that such amodel can account for many of the observed asymmetries. in the jet models, theoxygen and calcium are not expected to be distributed along the jet, butprimarily in an expanding torus that shares the plane and northern blue shiftof the inner circumstellar ring.

astro-ph;0208382	the progenitor of supernova 1993j revisited	from hubble space telescope images with 0.05" resolution we identify fourstars brighter than v=25 mag within 2.5" of sn 1993j in m81 which contaminatedprevious ground-based brightness estimates for the supernova progenitor.correcting for the contamination, we find that the energy distribution of theprogenitor is consistent with that of an early k-type supergiant star with m_v\~ -7.0 +/- 0.4 mag and an initial mass of 13--22 msun. the brightnesses of thenearby stars are sufficient to account for the excess blue light seen from theground in pre-explosion observations. therefore, the sn 1993j progenitor didnot necessarily have a blue companion, although by 2001, fainter blue stars areseen in close proximity to the supernova. these observations do not stronglylimit the mass of a hypothetical companion. a blue dwarf star with a mass up to30 msun could have been orbiting the progenitor without being detected in theground-based images. explosion models and observations show that the sn 1993jprogenitor had a helium-rich envelope. to test whether the helium abundancecould influence the energy distribution of the progenitor, we calculated modelsupergiant atmospheres with a range of plausible helium abundances. the modelsshow that the pre-supernova colors are not strongly affected by the heliumabundance longward of 4000 a, and abundances ranging between solar and 90%helium (by number) are all consistent with the observations.

astro-ph;0701246	measured metallicities at the sites of nearby broad-lined type ic  supernovae and implications for the sn-grb connection	we compare the chemical abundances at the sites of 12 nearby (z &lt;0.14) typeic supernovae (sn ic) that showed broad lines, but had no observed gamma-rayburst (grb), with the chemical abundances in 5 nearby (z &lt; 0.25) galaxies atthe sites of grb where broad-lined sn ic were seen after the fireball hadfaded. it has previously been noted that grb hosts are low in luminosity andlow in their metal abundances. if low metallicity is sufficient to force theevolution of massive stars to end their lives as grb with an accompanyingbroad-lined sn ic, then we would expect higher metal abundances for thebroad-lined sn ic that have no detected grb. this is what we observe, and thistrend is independent of the choice of metallicity calibration we adopt, and themode of sn survey that found the broad-lined sn. a unique feature of thisanalysis is that we present new spectra of the host galaxies and analyze allthe measurements of both samples in the same set of ways, using the galaxyemission-line measurements corrected for extinction and stellar absorption, viaindependent metallicity diagnostics of kewley &amp; dopita (2002), of mcgaugh(1991) and of pettini &amp; pagel (2004). in our small sample, the boundary betweengalaxies that have grb accompanying their broad-lined sn ic and those that havebroad-lined sn ic without a grb lies at an oxygen abundance of 12+log(o/h)_kd02~ 8.5, which corresponds to 0.2-0.6 z_sun depending on the adopted metallicityscale and solar abundance value. even when we limit the comparison to sn icthat were found in untargeted supernova surveys, the environment of everybroad-lined sn ic that had no grb is more metal rich than the site of anybroad-lined sn ic where a grb was detected.

astro-ph;9705199	two confirmed cataclysmic variables in the old stellar cluster ngc 6791	based on new ccd photometry and spectroscopy we confirm the presence of twocataclysmic variables (cvs) in the very old open cluster ngc 6791. one of thesevariables, known as b8, was observed by rucinski, kaluzny &amp; hilditch (1996) toundergo a large magnitude outburst in 1995. the spectrum of this star outsidethe outburst, obtained by us with mmt, shows clearly the emission linescharacteristic for dwarf novae. we observed the second star, known as b7, toundergo large ($\sim3 mag$) drop in its brightness over $\sim 10 days$. thespectrum of b7 obtained in the high state resembles spectra of nova-like cvs.this star a likely member of ux~uma subtype of cvs. variables b7 and b8represent only the second and the third cataclysmic variables known in openclusters. variable b7 has observational characteristics which would make itdifficult to identify as a cv with some of the methods being currently used insurveys for cvs in globular clusters.

astro-ph;9707260	time dilation from spectral feature age measurements of type ia  supernovae	we have developed a quantitative, empirical method for estimating the age oftype ia supernovae (sne ia) from a single spectral epoch. the techniqueexamines the goodness of fit of spectral features as a function of the temporalevolution of a large database of sne ia spectral features. when a sn iaspectrum with good signal-to-noise ratio over the rest frame range 3800 to 6800a is available, the precision of a spectral feature age (sfa) is (1-sigma) ~1.4 days. sfa estimates are made for two spectral epochs of sn 1996bj (z=0.574)to measure the rate of aging at high redshift. in the 10.05 days which elapsedbetween spectral observations, sn 1996bj aged 3.35 $\pm$ 3.2 days, consistentwith the 6.38 days of aging expected in an expanding universe and inconsistentwith no time dilation at the 96.4 % confidence level. the precision to whichindividual features constrain the supernova age has implications for the sourceof inhomogeneities among sne ia.

astro-ph;9710123	constraints on cosmological models from hubble space telescope  observations of high-z supernovae	we have coordinated hubble space telescope photometry with ground-baseddiscovery for three supernovae: two sn ia near z~0.5 (sn 1997ce, sn 1997cj) anda third event at z=0.97 (sn 1997ck). the superb spatial resolution of hstseparates each supernova from its host galaxy and leads to good precision inthe light curves. the hst data combined with ground-based photometry providegood temporal coverage. we use these light curves and relations betweenluminosity, light curve shape, and color calibrated from low-z samples toderive relative luminosity distances which are accurate to 10% at z~0.5 and 20%at z=1. the redshift-distance relation is used to place constraints on theglobal mean matter density, omega_matter, and the normalized cosmologicalconstant, omega_lambda. when the hst sample is combined with the distance to sn1995k (z=0.48), analyzed by the same precepts, it suggests that matter alone isinsufficient to produce a flat universe. specifically, foromega_matter+omega_lambda=1, omega_matter is less than 1 with &gt;95% confidence,and our best estimate of omega_matter is -0.1 +/- 0.5 if omega_lambda=0.although the present result is based on a very small sample whose systematicsremain to be explored, it demonstrates the power of hst measurements for highredshift supernovae.

astro-ph;9806396	supernova limits on the cosmic equation of state	we use type ia supernovae studied by the high-z supernova search team toconstrain the properties of an energy component which may have contributed toaccelerating the cosmic expansion. we find that for a flat geometry theequation of state parameter for the unknown component, alpha_x=p_x/rho_x, mustbe less than -0.55 (95% confidence) for any value of omega_m and is furtherlimited to alpha_x&lt;-0.60 (95%) if omega_m is assumed to be greater than 0.1 .these values are inconsistent with the unknown component being topologicaldefects such as domain walls, strings, or textures. the supernova data areconsistent with a cosmological constant (alpha_x=-1) or a scalar field whichhas had, on average, an equation of state parameter similar to the cosmologicalconstant value of -1 over the redshift range of z=1 to the present. supernovaand cosmic microwave background observations give complementary constraints onthe densities of matter and the unknown component. if only matter and vacuumenergy are considered, then the current combined data sets provide directevidence for a spatially flat universe with omega_tot=omega_m+omega_lambda =0.94 +/- 0.26 (1-sigma).

astro-ph;9906220	the type ia supernova 1998bu in m96 and the hubble constant	we present optical and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy of the typeia sn 1998bu in the leo i group galaxy m96 (ngc 3368). the data set consists of356 photometric measurements and 29 spectra of sn 1998bu between ut 1998 may 11and july 15. the well-sampled light curve indicates the supernova reachedmaximum light in b on ut 1998 may 19.3 (jd 2450952.8 +/- 0.8) with b = 12.22+/- 0.03 and v = 11.88 +/- 0.02. application of a revised version of themulticolor light curve shape (mlcs) method yields an extinction toward thesupernova of a_v = 0.94 +/- 0.15 mag, and indicates the supernova was ofaverage luminosity compared to other normal type ia supernovae. using the hstcepheid distance modulus to m96 (tanvir et al. 1995) and the mlcs fitparameters for the supernova, we derive an extinction-corrected absolutemagnitude for sn 1998bu at maximum, m_v = -19.42 +/- 0.22. our independentresults for this supernova are consistent with those of suntzeff et al. (1999).combining sn 1998bu with three other well-observed local calibrators and 42supernovae in the hubble flow yields a hubble constant, h_0 = 64^{+8}_{-6}km/s/mpc, where the error estimate incorporates possible sources of systematicuncertainty including the calibration of the cepheid period-luminosityrelation, the metallicity dependence of the cepheid distance scale, and thedistance to the lmc.

astro-ph;9906496	direct analysis of spectra of the type ic supernova 1994i	synthetic spectra generated with the parameterized supernovasynthetic-spectrum code synow are compared to observed photospheric-phasespectra of the type ic supernova 1994i. the observed optical spectra can bewell matched by synthetic spectra that are based on the assumption of sphericalsymmetry. we consider the identification of the infrared absorption featureobserved near 10,250 \aa, which previously has been attributed to he i$\lambda10830$ and regarded as strong evidence that sn 1994i ejected somehelium. we have difficulty accounting for the infrared absorption with he ialone. it could be a blend of he i and c i lines. alternatively, we find thatit can be fit by si i lines without compromising the fit in the optical region.  in synthetic spectra that match the observed spectra, from 4 days before to26 days after the time of maximum brightness, the adopted velocity at thephotosphere decreases from 17,500 to 7000 \kms. simple estimates of the kineticenergy carried by the ejected mass give values that are near the canonicalsupernova energy of $10^{51}$ ergs. the velocities and kinetic energies that wefind for sn 1994i in this way are much lower than those that we find elsewherefor the peculiar type ic sne 1997ef and 1998bw, which therefore appear to havebeen hyper-energetic.

0811.0002	a second case of variable na i d lines in a highly-reddened type ia  supernova	recent high-resolution spectra of the type ia sn 2006x have revealed thepresence of time-variable and blueshifted na i d features, interpreted by patatet al. as originating in circumstellar material within the progenitor system.the variation seen in sn 2006x induces relatively large changes in the total nai d equivalent width (\delta ew ~ 0.5 a in just over two weeks), that would bedetectable at lower resolutions. we have used a large data set comprising 2400low-resolution spectra of 450 type ia supernovae (sne ia) obtained by the cfasupernova program to search for variable na i d features. out of the 31 sne ia(including sn 2006x) in which we could have detected similar ew variations,only one other (sn 1999cl) shows variable na i d features, with an even largerchange over a similar ~10-day timescale (\delta ew = 1.66 +/- 0.21 a).interestingly, both sn 1999cl and sn 2006x are the two most highly-reddenedobjects in our sample, raising the possibility that the variability isconnected to dusty environments.

0811.1205	a golden standard type ia supernova sn 2005cf: observations from the  ultraviolet to the near-infrared wavebands	we present extensive photometry at ultraviolet (uv), optical, andnear-infrared (nir) wavelengths, as well as dense sampling of optical spectra,for the normal type ia supernova (sn ia) 2005cf. from the well-sampled lightcurves, we find that sn 2005cf reached a b-band maximum at 13.63+/-0.02 mag,with an observed luminosity decline rate dm_15(b) = 1.05+/-0.03 mag. thecorrelations between the decline rate and various color indexes, recalibratedon the basis of an expanded sn ia sample, yielded e(b-v)_host=0.09+/-0.03 magfor sn2005cf. the uv photometry was obtained with the hst and the swiftultraviolet/optical telescope, and the results match each other to within0.1-0.2 mag. the uv light curves show similar evolution to the broadband u,with an exception in the 2000-2500 angstrom spectral range (corresponding tothe f220w/uvm2 filters), where the light curve appears broader and much fainterthan that on either side (likely owing to the intrinsic spectral evolution).combining the uv data with the ground-based optical and nir data, we establishthe generic uv-optical-nir bolometric light curve for sn 2005cf and derive thebolometric corrections in the absence of uv and/or nir data. the overallspectral evolution of sn 2005cf is similar to that of a normal sn ia, but withvariety in the strength and profile of the main feature lines. the spectra atearly times displayed strong, detached high-velocity (hv) features in the ca iih&amp;k doublet and nir triplet. similar hv features may exist in the siii 6355absorption line which evolved rapidly from a flat-bottomed feature in theearliest phase to a triangular shape one week before maximum, and may be commonin other normal sne ia. the possible origin of the hv absorption features isbriefly discussed (abridged).

0811.4424	spectroscopy of high-redshift supernovae from the essence project: the  first four years	we present the results of spectroscopic observations from the essencehigh-redshift supernova (sn) survey during its first four years of operation.this sample includes spectra of all sne ia whose light curves were presented bymiknaitis et al. (2007) and used in the cosmological analyses of davis et al.(2007) and wood-vasey et al. (2007). the sample represents 273 hours ofspectroscopic observations with 6.5 - 10-m-class telescopes of objects detectedand selected for spectroscopy by the essence team. we present 174 spectra of156 objects. combining this sample with that of matheson et al. (2005), we havea total sample of 329 spectra of 274 objects. from this, we are able tospectroscopically classify 118 type ia sne. as the survey has matured, theefficiency of classifying sne ia has remained constant while we have observedboth higher-redshift sne ia and sne ia farther from maximum brightness.examining the subsample of sne ia with host-galaxy redshifts shows thatredshifts derived from only the sn ia spectra are consistent with redshiftsfound from host-galaxy spectra. moreover, the phases derived from only the snia spectra are consistent with those derived from light-curve fits. bycomparing our spectra to local templates, we find that the rate of objectssimilar to the overluminous sn 1991t and the underluminous sn 1991bg in oursample are consistent with that of the local sample. we do note, however, thatwe detect no object spectroscopically or photometrically similar to sn 1991bg.although systematic effects could reduce the high-redshift rate we expect basedon the low-redshift surveys, it is possible that sn 1991bg-like sne ia are lessprevalent at high redshift.
