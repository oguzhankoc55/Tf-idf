0812.4151	the isolated neutron star candidate 2xmm j104608.7-594306	over the last decade, x-ray observations unveiled the existence of severalclasses of isolated neutron stars (inss) which are radio-quiet or exhibit radioemission with properties much at variance with those of ordinary radio pulsars.the identification of new sources is crucial in order to understand therelations among the different classes and to compare observational constraintswith theoretical expectations. a recent analysis of the 2xmmp catalogueprovided less than 30 new thermally emitting ins candidates. among these, thesource 2xmm j104608.7-594306 appears particularly interesting because of thesoftness of its x-ray spectrum and of the present upper limits in the optical,which imply a logarithmic x-ray-to-optical flux ratio greater than 3.1,corrected for absorption. we present the x-ray and optical properties of 2xmmj104608.7-594306 and discuss its nature in the light of two possible scenariosinvoked to explain the x-ray thermal emission from inss: the release ofresidual heat in a cooling neutron star, as in the seven radio-quietrosat-discovered inss, and accretion from the interstellar medium. we find thatthe present observational picture of 2xmm j104608.7-594306 is consistent with adistant cooling ins with properties in agreement with the most up-to-dateexpectations of population synthesis models: it is fainter, hotter and moreabsorbed than the seven rosat sources and possibly located in the carinanebula, a region likely to harbour unidentified cooling neutron stars. theaccretion scenario, although not entirely ruled out by observations, wouldrequire a very slow (~10 km/s) ins accreting at the bondi-hoyle rate.

0901.2241	from outburst to quiescence: the decay of the transient anomalous x-ray  pulsar xte j1810-197	xte j1810-197 is the first transient anomalous x-ray pulsar ever discovered.its highly variable x-ray flux allowed us to study the timing and spectralemission properties of a magnetar candidate over a flux range of about twoorders of magnitude. we analyzed nine xmm-newton observations of xte j1810-197collected over a four years baseline (september 2003 - september 2007). epic pnand mos data were reduced and used for detailed timing and spectral analysis.pulse phase spectroscopic studies were also carried out for observations withsufficiently high signal to noise. we find that: (i) a three blackbodies modelreproduces the spectral properties of the source over the entire outburststatistically better than the two blackbodies model previously used in theliterature, (ii) the coldest blackbody is consistent with the thermal emissionfrom the whole surface, and has temperature and radius similar to thoseinferred from rosat observations before the outburst onset, (iii) there is aspectral feature around 1.1 kev during six consecutive observations (sincemarch 2005); if due to proton resonant cyclotron scattering, it would imply amagnetic field of around 2e14 g. this is in a very good agreement with thevalue from the spin period measurements.

0901.3453	suzaku observation of the new soft gamma repeater sgr 0501+4516 in  outburst	we present the first suzaku observation of the new soft gamma repeater sgr0501+4516, performed on 2008 august 26, four days after the onset of burstingactivity of this new member of the magnetar family. the soft x-ray persistentemission was detected with the x-ray imaging spectrometer (xis) at a 0.5-10 kevflux of 3.8e-11 erg/s/cm2, with a spectrum well fitted by an absorbed blackbodyplus power-law model. the source pulsation was confirmed at a period of5.762072+/-0.000002 s, and 32 x-ray bursts were detected by the xis, four ofwhich were also detected at higher energies by the hard x-ray detector (hxd).the strongest burst, which occurred at 03:16:16.9 (utc), was so bright that itcaused instrumental saturation, but its precursor phase, lasting for about 200ms, was detected successfully over the 0.5-200 kev range, with a fluence of~2.1e-7 erg/cm2 and a peak intensity of about 89 crab. the entire burst fluenceis estimated to be ~50 times higher. the precursor spectrum was very hard, andwell modeled by a combination of two blackbodies. we discuss the burstingactivity and x/gamma-ray properties of this newly discovered soft gammarepeater in comparison with other members of the class.

0901.3576	vlt/naco near-infrared observations of the transient radio magnetar 1e  1547.0-5408	despite about a decade of observations, very little is known about theoptical and infrared (ir) emission properties of the soft gamma-ray repeaters(sgrs) and of the anomalous x-ray pulsars (axps), the magnetar candidates, andabout the physical processes which drive their emission at these wavelengths.this is mainly due to the limited number of identifications achieved so far,five in total, and to the sparse spectral coverage obtained from multi-bandoptical/ir photometry. aim of this work is to search for a likely candidatecounterpart to the recently discovered transient radio axp 1e 1547.0-5408. weperformed the first deep near-ir (nir) observations (ks band) of 1e 1547.0-5408with the vlt on three nights (july 8th, 12th, and august 17th), after the x-raysource rebrightening and during the subsequent decay reported around june 2007.we detected four objects within, or close to, the 3sigma radio position of 1e1547.0-5408. the faintest of them (object 1) has a brightness k = 20.27 +/-0.05, which would yield an unabsorbed x-ray to nir flux ratio fx/fks ~ 800 for1e 1547.0-5408, i.e. on average lower than those derived for other magnetars.the non-detection of object 1 on the nights of july 8th and august 17th onlyallowed us to set an upper limit of delta ks ~ 0.2 on its nir variability,which prevented us to search for correlations with the radio or x-ray flux. wedetected no other object at the radio position down to a limit of ks ~ 21.7 (at5sigma), computed in our deepest vlt image (july 12th). from our observationswe can not confidently propose a nir counterpart to 1e 1547.0-5408. more nirobservations of object 1, e.g. to determine its colors and to monitorvariability, would be conclusive to determine whether or not it can beconsidered a plausible candidate.

0902.0720	topology of magnetars external field. i. axially symmetric fields	there is an increasing theoretical and observational evidence that theexternal magnetic field of magnetars may contain a toroidal component, likelyof the same order of the poloidal one. such "twisted magnetospheres" arethreaded by currents flowing along the closed field lines which can efficientlyinteract with soft thermal photons via resonant cyclotron scatterings (rcs).actually, rcs spectral models proved quite successful in explaining thepersistent ~1-10 kev emission from the magnetar candidates, the soft gamma-rayrepeaters (sgrs) and the anomalous x-ray pulsars (axps). moreover, it has beenproposed that, in presence of highly relativistic electrons, the same processcan give rise to the observed hard x-ray spectral tails extending up to ~200kev. spectral calculations have been restricted up to now to the case of aglobally twisted dipolar magnetosphere, although there are indications that thetwist may be confined only to a portion of the magnetosphere, and/or that thelarge scale field is more complex than a simple dipole. in this paper weinvestigate multipolar, force-free magnetospheres of ultra-magnetized neutronstars. we first discuss a general method to generate multipolar solutions ofthe grad- schluter-shafranov equation, and analyze in detail dipolar,quadrupolar and octupolar fields. the spectra and lightcurves for thesemultipolar, globally twisted fields are then computed using a monte carlo codeand compared with those of a purely dipolar configuration. finally thephase-resolved spectra and energy-dependent lightcurves obtained with a simplemodel of a locally sheared field are confronted with the integral observationsof the axps 1rxs j1708-4009 and 4u 0142+61. results support a picture in whichthe field in these two sources is not globally twisted.

0906.5480	vlt optical observations of the isolated neutron star rx j0420.0-5022	x-ray observations performed with rosat led to the discovery of 7radio-silent isolated neutron stars (inss) which are detected only through therelatively dim and purely thermal x-ray emission from the cooling star surface.a few of these inss (a.k.a. x-ray dim inss, or xdinss) have been also detectedat optical wavelengths where they seem to feature thermal spectra. opticalstudies of xdinss thus play a crucial role in mapping the temperaturedistribution on the neutron star surface and in investigating the existence ofan atmosphere around the neutron star. the aim of this work is to investigatethe optical identification of the xdins rx j0420.0-5022, tentatively proposedby haberl et al. (2004) based on vlt observations. we re-analysed the originalobservations of haberl et al. to assess the detection significance of theproposed counterpart and we performed deeper vlt observations aiming at ahigher confidence detection. with a ~2 sigma detection significance and are-computed flux of b=27.52+/-0.61, we can not rule out that the proposedcounterpart was spurious and produced by the halo of a very bright nearby star.while we could not detect the proposed counterpart in our deeper vltobservations, we found evidence for a marginally significant (~3.9 sigma)detection of a similarly faint object (b= 27.5+/-0.3), ~ 0.5" north of it andcoincident with the updated chandra position of rx j0420.0-5022. interestingly,the angular separation is consistent with the upper limit on the rxj0420.0-5022 proper motion (motch et al. 2009), which suggests that we mighthave actually detected the haberl et al. proposed counterpart. from the flux ofthe putative rx j0420.0-5022 counterpart we can rule out a &gt; 7 optical excesswith respect to the extrapolation of the xmm-newton spectrum.

0907.0054	new limits on radio emission from x-ray dim isolated neutron stars	we have carried out a search for radio emission at 820 mhz from six x-ray dimisolated neutron stars with the robert c. byrd green bank radio telescope. notransient or pulsed emission was found using fast folding, fast fouriertransform, and single-pulse searches. the corresponding flux limits are about0.01 mjy for pulsed emission, depending on the integration time for theparticular source and assuming a duty cycle of 2%, and 20 mjy for singledispersed pulses. these are the most sensitive limits to date on radio emissionfrom x-ray dim isolated neutron stars. there is no evidence for isolated radiopulses, as seen in a class of neutron stars known as rotating radio transients.our results imply that either the radio luminosities of these objects are lowerthan those of any known radio pulsars, or they could simply be long-periodnearby radio pulsars with high magnetic fields beaming away from the earth. totest the latter possibility, we would need around 40 similar sources to providea 1 sigma probability of at least one of them beaming toward us. we also give adetailed description of our implementation of the fast folding algorithm.

0907.4616	quiet but still bright: xmm-newton observations of the soft gamma-ray  repeater sgr 0526-66	sgr 0526-66 was the first soft gamma-ray repeater (sgr) from which a giantflare was detected in march 1979, suggesting the existence of magnetars, i.e.neutron stars powered by the decay of their extremely strong magnetic field.since then, very little information has been obtained on this object, mainlybecause it has been burst-inactive since 1983 and the study of its persistentx-ray emission has been hampered by its large distance and its location in ax-ray bright supernova remnant in the large magellanic cloud. here we report ona comprehensive analysis of all the available xmm-newton observations of sgr0526-66. in particular, thanks to a deep observation taken in 2007, we measuredits pulsation period (p = 8.0544 +/- 0.0002 s) 6 years after its latestdetection by chandra. this allowed us to detect for the first time asignificant reduction of its spin-down rate. from a comparison with two shorterxmm-newton observations performed in 2000 and 2001, we found no significantchanges in the spectrum, which is well modelled by an absorbed power-law withnh = 4.6e+21 cm^-2 and photon index = 3.27. the high luminosity (about 4e+35erg/s, in the 1-10 kev energy band) still observed about 25 years after thelatest detection of bursting activity places sgr 0526-66 in the group of brightand persistent magnetar candidates.

0911.3064	the dust-scattering x-ray rings of the anomalous x-ray pulsar 1e  1547.0-5408	on 2009 january 22 numerous strong bursts were detected from the anomalousx-ray pulsar 1e 1547.0-5408. swift/xrt and xmm-newton/epic observations carriedout in the following two weeks led to the discovery of three x-ray ringscentered on this source. the ring radii increased with time following theexpansion law expected for a short impulse of x-rays scattered by three dustclouds. assuming different models for the dust composition and grain sizedistribution, we fit the intensity decay of each ring as a function of time atdifferent energies, obtaining tight constrains on the distance of the x-raysource. although the distance strongly depends on the adopted dust model, wefind that some models are incompatible with our x-ray data, restricting to 4-8kpc the range of possible distances for 1e 1547.0-5408. the best-fitting dustmodel provides a source distance of 3.91 +/- 0.07 kpc, which is compatible withthe proposed association with the supernova remnant g 327.24-0.13, and impliesdistances of 2.2 kpc, 2.6 kpc and 3.4 kpc for the dust clouds, in goodagreement with the dust distribution inferred by co line observations towards1e 1547.0-5408. however, dust distances in agreement with co data are alsoobtained for a set of similarly well-fitting models that imply a sourcedistance of about 5 kpc. a distance of about 4-5 kpc is also favored by thefact that these dust models are already known to provide good fits to thedust-scattering halos of bright x-ray binaries.

1103.4099	vlt/fors2 observations of the optical counterpart of the isolated  neutron star rbs 1774	x-ray observations performed with rosat led to the discovery of a group(seven to date) of x-ray dim and radio-silent middle-aged isolated neutronstars (a.k.a. xdinss), which are characterised by pure blackbody spectra(kt~40-100 ev), long x-ray pulsations (p=3-12 s), and appear to be endowed withrelatively high magnetic fields, (b~10d13-14 g). rbs 1774 is one of the fewxdinss with a candidate optical counterpart, which we discovered with the vlt.we performed deep observations of rbs 1774 in the r band with the vlt todisentangle a non-thermal power-law spectrum from a rayleigh-jeans, whosecontributions are expected to be very much different in the red part of thespectrum. we did not detect the rbs 1774 candidate counterpart down to a 3sigma limiting magnitude of r~27. the constraint on its colour, (b-r)&lt;0.6,rules out that it is a background object, positionally coincident with thex-ray source. our r-band upper limit is consistent with the extrapolation ofthe b-band flux (assuming a 3 sigma uncertainty) for a set of power-laws f_nu~nu^alpha with spectral indeces alpha&lt;0.07. if the optical spectrum of rbs 1774were non-thermal, its power-law slope would be very much unlike those of allisolated neutron stars with non-thermal optical emission, suggesting that it ismost likely thermal. for instance, a rayleigh-jeans with temperature t_o = 11ev, for an optically emitting radius r_o=15 km and a source distance d=150 pc,would be consistent with the optical measurements. the implied low distance iscompatible with the 0.04 x-ray pulsed fraction if either the star spin axis isnearly aligned with the magnetic axis or with the line of sight, or it isslightly misaligned with respect to both the magnetic axis and the line ofsight by 5-10 degrees

1107.5488	is sgr 0418+5729 indeed a waning magnetar ?	sgr 0418+5729 is a transient soft gamma-ray repeater which underwent a majoroutburst in june 2009, during which the emission of short bursts was observed.its properties appeared quite typical of other sources of the same class untillong-term x-ray monitoring failed to detect any period derivative. the presentupper limit on $\dot p$ implies that the surface dipole field is $b_p\lesssim7.5\times 10^{12}\ {\rm g}$ (rea et al 2010), well below those measured inother soft gamma-ray repeaters (sgrs) and in the anomalous x-ray pulsars(axps), a group of similar sources. both sgrs and axps are currently believedto be powered by ultra-magnetized neutron stars (magnetars, $b_p\approx10^{14}$--$10^{15}\ {\rm g}$). sgr 0418+5729 hardly seems to fit in such apicture. we show that the magneto-rotational properties of sgr 0418+5729 can bereproduced if this is an aged magnetar, $\approx 1\ {\rm myr}$ old, whichexperienced substantial field decay. the large initial toroidal component ofthe internal field required to match the observed properties of sgr 0418+5729ensures that crustal fractures, and hence bursting activity, can still occur atpresent time. the thermal spectrum observed during the outburst decay iscompatible with the predictions of a resonant compton scattering model (as inother sgrs/axps) if the field is low and the magnetospheric twist moderate.

1111.4158	the influence of magnetic field geometry on magnetars x-ray spectra	nowadays, the analysis of the x-ray spectra of magnetically powered neutronstars or magnetars is one of the most valuable tools to gain insight into thephysical processes occurring in their interiors and magnetospheres. inparticular, the magnetospheric plasma leaves a strong imprint on the observedx-ray spectrum by means of compton up-scattering of the thermal radiationcoming from the star surface. motivated by the increased quality of theobservational data, much theoretical work has been devoted to develop montecarlo (mc) codes that incorporate the effects of resonant compton scattering inthe modeling of radiative transfer of photons through the magnetosphere. thetwo key ingredients in this simulations are the kinetic plasma properties andthe magnetic field (mf) configuration. the mf geometry is expected to becomplex, but up to now only mathematically simple solutions (self-similarsolutions) have been employed. in this work, we discuss the effects of new,more realistic, mf geometries on synthetic spectra. we use new force-freesolutions in a previously developed mc code to assess the influence of mfgeometry on the emerging spectra. our main result is that the shape of thefinal spectrum is mostly sensitive to uncertain parameters of themagnetospheric plasma, but the mf geometry plays an important role on theangle-dependence of the spectra.

1112.4602	a time-variable, phase-dependent emission line in the x-ray spectrum of  the isolated neutron star rx j0822-4300	rx j0822-4300 is the central compact object associated with the puppis asupernova remnant. previous x-ray observations suggested rx j0822-4300 to be ayoung neutron star with a weak dipole field and a peculiar surface temperaturedistribution dominated by two antipodal spots with different temperatures andsizes. an emission line at 0.8 kev was also detected. we performed a very deep(130 ks) observation with xmm-newton, which allowed us to study in detail thephase-resolved properties of rx j0822-4300. our new data confirm the existenceof a narrow spectral feature, best modelled as an emission line, only seen inthe `soft' phase interval - when the cooler region is best aligned to the lineof sight. surprisingly, comparison of our recent observations to the older onesyields evidence for a variation in the emission line component, which can bemodelled as a decrease in the central energy from ~0.80 kev in 2001 to ~0.73kev in 2009--2010. the line could be generated via cyclotron scattering ofthermal photons in an optically thin layer of gas, or - alternatively - itcould originate in low-rate accretion by a debris disk. in any case, avariation in energy, pointing to a variation of the magnetic field in the lineemitting region, cannot be easily accounted for.

1203.6449	a new low magnetic field magnetar: the 2011 outburst of swift  j1822.3-1606	we report on the long term x-ray monitoring with swift, rxte, suzaku, chandraand xmm-newton of the outburst of the newly discovered magnetar swiftj1822.3-1606 (sgr 1822-1606), from the first observations soon after thedetection of the short x-ray bursts which led to its discovery, through thefirst stages of its outburst decay (covering the time-span from july 2011,until end of april 2012). we also report on archival rosat observations whichwitnessed the source during its likely quiescent state, and on upper limits onswift j1822.3-1606's radio-pulsed and optical emission during outburst, withthe green bank telescope (gbt) and the gran telescopio canarias (gtc),respectively. our x-ray timing analysis finds the source rotating with a periodof p=8.43772016(2) s and a period derivative \dot{p}=8.3(2)x10^{-14} s s^{-1} ,which entails an inferred dipolar surface magnetic field of b~2.7x10^{13} g atthe equator. this measurement makes swift j1822.3-1606 the second lowestmagnetic field magnetar (after sgr 0418+5729; rea et al. 2010). following theflux and spectral evolution from the beginning of the outburst, we find thatthe flux decreased by about an order of magnitude, with a subtle softening ofthe spectrum, both typical of the outburst decay of magnetars. by modeling thesecular thermal evolution of swift j1822.3-1606, we find that the observedtiming properties of the source, as well as its quiescent x-ray luminosity, canbe reproduced if it was born with a poloidal and crustal toroidal fields ofb_{p}~1.5x10^{14} g and b_{tor}~7x10^{14} g, respectively, and if its currentage is ~550 kyr.

1212.3141	the birthplace and age of the isolated neutron star rx j1856.5-3754	x-ray observations unveiled various types of radio-silent isolated neutronstars (inss), phenomenologically very diverse, e.g. the myr old x-ray dim ins(xdinss) and the kyr old magnetars. although their phenomenology is muchdiverse, the similar periods (p=2--10 s) and magnetic fields (~10^{14} g)suggest that xdinss are evolved magnetars, possibly born from similarpopulations of supermassive stars. one way to test this hypothesis is toidentify their parental star clusters by extrapolating backward the neutronstar velocity vector in the galactic potential. by using the information on theage and space velocity of the xdins rx j1856.5-3754, we computed backwards itsorbit in the galactic potential and searched for its parental stellar clusterby means of a closest approach criterion. we found a very likely associationwith the upper scorpius ob association, for a neutron star age of 0.42+/-0.08myr, a radial velocity v_r^ns =67+/- 13$ km s^{-1}, and a present-timeparallactic distance d_\pi^ns = 123^{+11}_{-15} pc. our result confirms thatthe "true" neutron star age is much lower than the spin-down age (tau_{sd}=3.8myrs), and is in good agreement with the cooling age, as computed withinstandard cooling scenarios. the mismatch between the spin-down and thedynamical/cooling age would require either an anomalously large breaking index(n~20) or a decaying magnetic field with initial value b_0 ~ 10^{14} g.unfortunately, owing to the uncertainty on the age of the upper scorpius obassociation and the masses of its members we cannot yet draw firm conclusionson the estimated mass of the rx j1856.5-3754 progenitor.

1303.5579	the outburst decay of the low magnetic field magnetar sgr 0418+5729	we report on the long term x-ray monitoring of the outburst decay of the lowmagnetic field magnetar sgr 0418+5729, using all the available x-ray dataobtained with rxte, swift, chandra, and xmm-newton observations, from thediscovery of the source in june 2009, up to august 2012. the timing analysisallowed us to obtain the first measurement of the period derivative of sgr0418+5729: \dot{p}=4(1)x10^{-15} s/s, significant at ~3.5 sigma confidencelevel. this leads to a surface dipolar magnetic field of b_dip ~6x 10^{12} g.this measurement confirms sgr 0418+5729 as the lowest magnetic field magnetar.following the flux and spectral evolution from the beginning of the outburst upto ~1200 days, we observe a gradual cooling of the tiny hot spot responsiblefor the x-ray emission, from a temperature of ~0.9 to 0.3 kev. simultaneously,the x-ray flux decreased by about 3 orders of magnitude: from about1.4x10^{-11} to 1.2x10^{-14} erg/s/cm^2 . deep radio, millimeter, optical andgamma-ray observations did not detect the source counterpart, implyingstringent limits on its multi-band emission, as well as constraints on thepresence of a fossil disk. by modeling the magneto-thermal secular evolution ofsgr 0418+5729, we infer a realistic age of ~550 kyr, and a dipolar magneticfield at birth of ~10^{14} g. the outburst characteristics suggest the presenceof a thin twisted bundle with a small heated spot at its base. the bundleuntwisted in the first few months following the outburst, while the hot spotdecreases in temperature and size. we estimate the outburst rate of lowmagnetic field magnetars to be about one per year per galaxy, and we brieflydiscuss the consequences of such result in several other astrophysicalcontexts.

1309.4917	unifying neutron stars: getting to guns	the variety of the observational appearance of young isolated neutron starsmust find an explanation in the framework of some unifying approach. nowadaysit is believed that such scenario must include magnetic field decay, thepossibility of magnetic field emergence on a time scale $\lesssim 10^4$--$10^5$yrs, significant contribution of non-dipolar fields, and appropriate initialparameter distributions. we present our results on the initial spin perioddistribution, and suggest that inconsistences between distributions derived bydifferent methods for samples with different average ages can uncover fielddecay or/and emerging field. we describe a new method to probe the magneticfield decay in normal pulsars. the method is a modified pulsar currentapproach, where we study pulsar flow along the line of increasingcharacteristic age for constant field. our calculations, performed with thismethod, can be fitted with an exponential decay for ages in the range $8\times10^4$--$3.5 \times 10^5$ yrs with a time scale $\sim 5 \times 10^5$ yrs. wediscuss several issues related to the unifying scenario. at first, we note thatthe dichotomy, among local thermally emitting neutron stars, between normalpulsars and the magnificent seven remains unexplained. then we discuss the roleof high-mass x-ray binaries in the unification of neutron star evolution. wenote, that such systems allow to check evolutionary effects on a time scalelonger than what can be probed with normal pulsars alone. we conclude with abrief discussion of importance of discovering old neutron stars accreting fromthe interstellar medium.

0806.3714	x-ray spectra from magnetar candidates. ii resonant cross sections for  electron-photon scattering in the relativistic regime	recent models of spectral formation in magnetars called renewed attention onelectron-photon scattering in the presence of ultra-strong magnetic fields.investigations presented so far mainly focussed on mildly relativisticparticles and magnetic scattering was treated in the non-relativistic (thomson)limit. this allows for consistent spectral calculations up to a few tens ofkevs, but becomes inadequate in modelling the hard tails (&lt;200 kev) detected byintegral from magnetar sources. in this paper, the second in a series devotedto model the x-/soft gamma-ray persistent spectrum of magnetar candidates, wepresent explicit, relatively simple expressions for the magnetic comptoncross-section at resonance which account for landau-raman scattering up to thesecond landau level. no assumption is made on the magnetic field strength. wefind that sensible departures from the thomson regime can bealready present atb ~5e12 g. the form of the magnetic cross section we derived can be easilyimplemented in monte carlo transfer codes and a direct application to magnetarspectral calculations will be presented in a forthcoming study.

0806.4136	observations of isolated neutron stars with the eso multi-conjugate  adaptive optics demonstrator	high-energy observations have unveiled peculiar classes of isolated neutronstars which, at variance with radio pulsars, are mostly radio silent and notpowered by the star rotation. among these objects are the magnetars,hyper-magnetized neutron stars characterized by transient x-ray/gamma-rayemission, and neutron stars with purely thermal, and in most cases stationary,x-ray emission (a.k.a., x-ray dim isolated neutron stars or xdinss). whileapparently dissimilar in their high-energy behavior and age, both magnetars andxdinss have similar periods and unusually high magnetic fields. this suggests atantalizing scenario where the former evolve into the latter.discovering so faruninvestigated similarities between the multi-wavelength properties of thesetwo classes would be a further step forward to establish an evolutionaryscenario. a most promising channels is the near infrared (nir) one, wheremagnetars are characterized by a distinctive spectral flattening with respectto the extrapolation of the soft x-ray spectrum.we observed the two xdinss rxj0420.0-5022 and rx j1856.5-3754 with the multi-conjugate adaptive opticsdemonstrator (mad) at the very large telescope (vlt) as part of the instrumentguaranteed time observations program, to search for their nir counterparts.both rx j1856.5-3754 and rx j0420.0-5022 were not detected down to k_s ~20 andks ~21.5, respectively. in order to constrain the relation between xdinss andmagnetars it would be of importance to perform deeper nir observations. a goodcandidate is 1rxs j214303.7+065419 which is the xdins with the highest inferredmagnetic field.

astro-ph;0003456	an efficient algorithm for two-dimensional radiative transfer in  axisymmetric circumstellar envelopes and disks	we present an algorithm for two-dimensional radiative transfer inaxisymmetric, circumstellar media. the formal integration of the transferequation is performed by a generalization of the short characteristics (sc)method to spherical coordinates. accelerated lambda iteration (ali) and ng'salgorithm are used to converge towards a solution. by taking a logarithmicallyspaced radial coordinate grid, the method has the natural capability oftreating problems that span several decades in radius, in the most extreme casefrom the stellar radius up to parsec scale. flux conservation is guaranteed inspherical coordinates by a particular choice of discrete photon directions anda special treatment of nearly-radially outward propagating radiation. thealgorithm works well from zero up to very high optical depth, and can be usedfor a wide variety of transfer problems, including non-lte line formation, dustcontinuum transfer and high temperature processes such as compton scattering.in this paper we focus on multiple scattering off dust grains and on non-ltetransfer in molecular and atomic lines. line transfer is treated according toan ali scheme for multi-level atoms/molecules, and includes both random andsystematic velocity fields. the algorithms are implemented in a multi-purposeuser-friendly radiative transfer program named radical. we present two examplecomputations: one of dust scattering in the egg nebula, and one of non-lte lineformation in rotational transitions of hco$^{+}$ in a flattened protostellarcollapsing cloud.

astro-ph;0008199	isolated neutron stars in the galaxy	in this article we briefly review our recent results on evolution andproperties of isolated neutron stars (inss) in the galaxy.  as the first step we calculate a {\it census} of inss in our galaxy.  we infer a lower bound for the mean kick velocity of nss, $ &lt;v&gt; \sim$(200-300) ${\rm km s^{-1}}$. the same conclusion is reached for both aconstant magnetic field ($b\sim 10^{12}$ g) and for a magnetic field decayingexponentially with a timescale $\sim 10^9$ yr. these results, moreover,constrain the fraction of low velocity stars, which could have escaped pulsarstatistics, to $\sim$few percents.  then we show that the range of minimum value of magnetic moment, $\mu_b$:$\sim 10^{29.5}\ge \mu_b \ge 10^{28} {\rm g} {\rm cm}^3$, and thecharacteristic decay time, $t_d$: $\sim 10^8\ge t_d \ge 10^7 {\rm yrs}$, can beexcluded assuming the standard initial magnetic momentum, $\mu_0=10^{30} {\rmg} {\rm cm}^3$, if accreting inss are observed. for these parameters an inswould never reach the stage of accretion from the interstellar medium even fora low space velocity of the star and high density of the ambient plasma. therange of excluded parameters increases for lower values of $\mu_0$.  it is shown that old accreting inss become more abundant than young coolinginss at x-ray fluxes below $\sim 10^{-13}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. we canpredict that about one accreting ins per square degree should be observed atthe {\it chandra} and {\it newton} flux limits of $\sim 10^{-16}$ erg cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}.$ the weak {\it rosat} sources, associated with inss, can be youngcooling objects, if the nss birth rate in the solar vicinity during the last$\sim 10^6$ yr was much higher than inferred from radiopulsar observations.

astro-ph;0302197	rx j1856.5-3754: bare quark star or naked neutron star ?	recent chandra observations have shown that the soft x-ray spectrum from theisolated neutron star rx j1856.5-3754 is featureless and best fitted by ablackbody, in contrast with the predictions of current neutron star atmosphericmodels. the star distance (~120-140 pc) implies a radiation radius of at most\~5-6 km, too small for any neutron star equation of state. proposedexplanations for such a small radius include a reduced x-ray emitting region(as a polar cap), or the presence of a more compact object, as a barequark/strange star. however, both interpretations rely on the presumption thatthe quark star or the cap radiates a pure blackbody spectrum, and nojustification for this assumption has been presented yet. here we discuss analternative possibility. cool neutron stars (t &lt; 10^6 k) endowed with highmagnetic field (b &gt; 10^13 g) may suffer a phase transition in the outermostlayers. the neutron star is then left bare of the gaseous atmosphere. wecomputed spectra from naked neutron stars with a surface fe composition.depending on b, we found that the 0.1-2 kev emission can be featureless andindistinguishable from a blackbody. owing to the reduced surface emissivity,the star only radiates ~30-50 % of the blackbody power, thus that the size ofthe emitting region is larger than for a perfect planckian emitter. whenapplied to rx j1856.5-3754 our model accounts for the observed x-ray propertiesand solves the paradox of the small radius. the apparent star radius is ~10-12km, consistent with equations of state of a neutron star. the optical emissionof rx j1856.5-3754 may be explained by the presence a thin gaseous shell on thetop of the fe condensate.

astro-ph;0304249	radiative acceleration and transient, radiation-induced electric fields	the radiative acceleration of particles and the electrostatic potentialfields that arise in low density plasmas hit by radiation produced by atransient, compact source are investigated. we calculate the dynamicalevolution and asymptotic energy of the charged particles accelerated by thephotons and the radiation-induced electric double layer in the fullrelativistic, klein-nishina regime. for fluxes in excess of $10^{27}$ ${\rmerg} {\rm cm}^{-2} {\rm s}^{-1}$, the radiative force on a diluted plasma($n\la 10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$) is so strong that electrons are accelerated rapidlyto relativistic speeds while ions lag behind owing to their larger inertia. theions are later effectively accelerated by the strong radiation-induced doublelayer electric field up to lorentz factors $\approx 100$, attainable in thecase of negligible compton drag. the asymptotic energies achieved by both ionsand electrons are larger by a factor 2--4 with respect to what one couldnaively expect assuming that the electron-ion assembly is a rigidly coupledsystem. the regime we investigate may be relevant within the framework of giantflares from soft gamma-repeaters.

astro-ph;0411618	population synthesis as a probe of neutron star thermal evolution	the study of thermal emission from isolated, cooling neutron stars plays akey role in probing the physical conditions of both the star crust and thecore. the comparison of theoretical models for the star thermal evolution withthe surface temperature derived from x-ray observations of sources of differentage is one of the main tools to investigate the properties of the interior andconstrain the equation of state. here we propose to use population synthesisstudies as an independent approach to test the physics governing the starcooling. theoretical log n - log s distributions depend on the assumed neutronstar thermal evolution. we have computed distributions for several differentcooling scenarios and found that comparison with the observed log n - log s ofisolated neutron stars is effective in discriminating among cooling models.among the eleven cooling models considered in this paper, all of which mayreproduce the observed temperature vs. age diagram, only at most three canexplain the log n - log s distribution of close-by cooling neutron stars. thelog n - log s test, being a ``global'' one and despite some limitations,appears capable of complementing the standard temperature vs. age test used upto now.

(2005).these new x-ray observations show that the axp flux is rising again, and thespectrum hardening. if the increase in the source intensity is indeed connectedwith the glitches and a possible bursting activity, we expect this source toenter in a bursting active phase around 2006-2007. second, we report on deep irobservations of 1rxs j170849-400910, taken with the vlt-naco adaptive optics,showing that there are many weak sources consistent with the axp position.neither star a or b, previously proposed by different authors, might yet beconclusively recognised as the ir counterpart of 1rxs j170849-400910. third,using monte carlo simulations, we re-address the calculation of thesignificance of the absorption line found in a phase-resolved spectrum of thissource by rea et al. (2003), and interpreted as a resonant scattering cyclotronfeature.

astro-ph;9910114	the neutron stars census	the paucity of old isolated accreting neutron stars in rosat observations isused to derive a lower limit on the mean velocity of neutron stars at birth.the secular evolution of the population is simulated following the paths of astatistical sample of stars for different values of the initial kick velocity,drawn from an isotropic gaussian distribution with mean velocity $0\leq &lt;v&gt;\leq 550$ ${\rm km s^{-1}}$. the spin--down, induced by dipole losses and theinteraction with the ambient medium, is tracked together with the dynamicalevolution in the galactic potential, allowing for the determination of thefraction of stars which are, at present, in each of the four possible stages:ejector, propeller, accretor, and georotator. taking from the rosat all skysurvey an upper limit of $\sim 10$ accreting neutron stars within $\sim 140$ pcfrom the sun, we infer a lower bound for the mean kick velocity, $ &lt; v&gt;\gtrsim200-300$ ${\rm km s^{-1}},$ corresponding to a velocity dispersion$\sigma_v\gtrsim 125-190$ km s$^{-1}$. the same conclusion is reached for botha constant magnetic field ($b\sim 10^{12}$ g) and a magnetic field decayingexponentially with a timescale $\sim 10^9$ yr. such high velocities areconsistent with those derived from radio pulsar observations. present results,moreover, constrain the fraction of low velocity stars, which could haveescaped pulsar statistics, to less than 1%.

0810.5319	spectral and temporal variations of the isolated neutron star rx  j0720.4-3125: new xmm-newton observations	in the past, the isolated, radio-quiet neutron star rx j0720.4-3125 showedvariations in the spectral parameters (apparent radius, temperature of theemitting area and equivalent width of the absorption feature) seen in the x-rayspectra, not only during the spin period of 8.39s, but also over time scales ofyears. new x-ray observations of rx j0720.4-3125 with xmm newton extend thecoverage to about 7.5 years with the latest pointing performed in november2007. out of a total of fourteen available epic-pn datasets, eleven have beenobtained with an identical instrumental setup (full frame read-out mode withthin filter), and are best suited for a comparative investigations of thespectral and timing properties of this enigmatic x-ray pulsar.  we analysed the new xmm newton observations together with archival data inorder to follow the spectral and temporal evolution of rx j0720.4-3125  all xmm-newton data were reduced with the standard xmm-sas software package.a systematic and consistent data reduction of all these observations wasemphasised in order to reduce systematic errors as far as possible.  we investigate the phase residuals derived from data from different energybands using different timing solutions for the spin period evolution andconfirm the phase lag between hard and soft photons. the phase shift in thex-ray pulses between hard and soft photons varies with time and changes signaround mjd=52800 days, regardless of the chosen timing solution. the phaseresiduals[abridge]

0812.0014	xmm-newton discovery of 2.6 s pulsations in the soft gamma-ray repeater  sgr 1627-41	after nearly a decade of quiescence, the soft gamma-ray repeater sgr 1627-41reactivated on 2008 may 28 with a bursting episode followed by a slowlydecaying enhancement of its persistent emission. to search for the stillunknown spin period of this sgr taking advantage of its high flux state, weperformed on 2008 september 27-28 a 120 ks long x-ray observation with thexmm-newton satellite. pulsations with p = 2.594578(6) s were detected at ahigher than 6-sigma confidence level, with a double-peaked pulse profile. thepulsed fraction in the 2-12 kev range is 19% +/- 3% and 24% +/- 3% for thefundamental and the second harmonic, respectively. the observed 2-10 kev fluxis 3.4e-13 erg/cm^2/s, still a factor of ~ 5 above the quiescentpre-burst-activation level, and the spectrum is well fitted by an absorbedpower law plus blackbody model (photon index gamma = 0.6, blackbody temperaturekt = 0.5 kev, and absorption nh = 1.2e+23 cm^-2). we also detected a shell ofdiffuse soft x-ray emission which is likely associated with the young supernovaremnant g337.0-0.1.
