0706.1345	spectroscopy and multiband photometry of the afterglow of intermediate  duration gamma-ray burst 040924 and its host galaxy	we present optical photometry and spectroscopy of the afterglow and hostgalaxy of gamma-ray burst 040924. this grb had a rather short duration of t90~2.4s, and a well sampled optical afterglow light curve. we aim to use thisdataset to find further evidence that this burst is consistent with a massivestar core-collapse progenitor. we combine the afterglow data reported here withdata taken from the literature and compare the host properties with surveydata. we find that the global behaviour of the optical afterglow is well fit bya broken power-law, with a break at ~0.03 days. we determine the redshift z =0.858 +/- 0.001 from the detected emission lines in our spectrum. using thespectrum and photometry we derive global properties of the host, showing it tohave similar properties to long grb hosts. we detect the [ne iii] emission linein the spectrum, and compare the fluxes of this line of a sample of 15 long grbhost galaxies with survey data, showing the long grb hosts to be comparable tolocal metal-poor emission line galaxies in their [ne iii] emission. we fit thesupernova bump accompanying this burst, and find that it is similar to otherlong grb supernova bumps, but fainter. all properties of grb 040924 areconsistent with an origin in the core-collapse of a massive star: thesupernova, the spectrum and sed of the host and the afterglow.

0901.4100	near-infrared follow-up to the may 2008 activation of sgr 1627-41	on 28 may 2008, the swift satellite detected the first reactivation of sgr1627-41 since its discovery in 1998.  following this event we began an observing campaign in near infraredwavelengths to search for a possible counterpart inside the error circle ofthis sgr, which is expected to show flaring activity simultaneous to the highenergy flares or at least some variability as compared to the quiescent state.  for the follow-up we used the 0.6m rem robotic telescope at la sillaobservatory, which allowed a fast response within 24 hours and, throughdirector discretionary time, the 8.2m very large telescope at paranalobservatory. there, we observed with naco to produce high angular resolutionimaging with the aid of adaptive optics.  these observations represent the fastest near infrared observations after anactivation of this sgr and the deepest and highest spatial resolutionobservations of the chandra error circle.  5 sources are detected in the immediate vicinity of the most precise x-raylocalisation of this source. for 4 of them we do not detect variability,although the x-ray counterpart experimented a significant decay during ourobservation period. the 5th source is only detected in one epoch, where we havethe best image quality, so no variability constrains can be imposed and remainsas the only plausible counterpart. we can impose a limit of ks &gt; 21.6magnitudes to any other counterpart candidate one week after the onset of theactivity. our adaptive optics imaging, with a resolution of 0.2" provides areference frame for subsequent studies of future periods of activity.

0906.1577	a glimpse of the end of the dark ages: the gamma-ray burst of 23 april  2009 at redshift 8.3	it is thought that the first generations of massive stars in the universewere an important, and quite possibly dominant, source of the ultra-violetradiation that reionized the hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium (igm); astate in which it has remained to the present day. measurements of cosmicmicrowave background anisotropies suggest that this phase-change largely tookplace in the redshift range z=10.8 +/- 1.4, while observations of quasars andlyman-alpha galaxies have shown that the process was essentially completed byz=6. however, the detailed history of reionization, and characteristics of thestars and proto-galaxies that drove it, remain unknown. further progress inunderstanding requires direct observations of the sources of ultra-violetradiation in the era of reionization, and mapping the evolution of the neutralhydrogen fraction through time. the detection of galaxies at such redshifts ishighly challenging, due to their intrinsic faintness and high luminositydistance, whilst bright quasars appear to be rare beyond z~7. here we reportthe discovery of a gamma-ray burst, grb 090423, at redshift z=8.26 -0.08 +0.07.this is well beyond the redshift of the most distant spectroscopicallyconfirmed galaxy (z=6.96) and quasar (z=6.43). it establishes that massivestars were being produced, and dying as grbs, ~625 million years after the bigbang. in addition, the accurate position of the burst pinpoints the location ofthe most distant galaxy known to date. larger samples of grbs beyond z~7 willconstrain the evolving rate of star formation in the early universe, whilerapid spectroscopy of their afterglows will allow direct exploration of theprogress of reionization with cosmic time.

0907.3449	low-resolution spectroscopy of gamma-ray burst optical afterglows:  biases in the swift sample and characterization of the absorbers	(abridged). we present a sample of 77 optical afterglows (oas) of swiftdetected grbs for which spectroscopic follow-up observations have been secured.we provide linelists and equivalent widths for all detected lines redward ofly-alpha. we discuss to what extent the current sample of swift bursts with oaspectroscopy is a biased subsample of all swift detected grbs. for that purposewe define an x-ray selected sample of swift bursts with optimal conditions forground-based follow up from the period march 2005 to september 2008; 146 burstsfulfill our sample criteria. we derive the redshift distribution for thissample and conclude that less than 19% of swift bursts are at z&gt;7. we comparethe high energy properties for three sub-samples of bursts in the sample: i)bursts with redshifts measured from oa spectroscopy, ii) bursts with detectedoa, but no oa-based redshift, and iii) bursts with no detection of the oa. thebursts in group i) have significantly less excess x-ray absorption than burstsin the other two groups. in addition, the fraction of dark bursts is 14% ingroup i), 38% in group ii) and &gt; 39% in group iii). from this we conclude thatthe sample of grbs with oa spectroscopy is not representative for all swiftbursts, most likely due to a bias against the most dusty sight-lines. finally,we characterize grb absorption systems as a class and compare them to qsoabsorption systems, in particular dlas. on average grb absorbers arecharacterized by significantly stronger ews for hi as well as for both low andhigh ionization metal lines than what is seen in intervening qso absorbers.based on the z&gt;2 bursts in the sample we place a 95% confidence upper limit of7.5% on the mean escape fraction of ionizing photons from star-forminggalaxies.

0907.4578	multi-wavelength observations of the energetic grb 080810: detailed  mapping of the broadband spectral evolution	grb 080810 was one of the first bursts to trigger both swift and the fermigamma-ray space telescope. it was subsequently monitored over the x-ray anduv/optical bands by swift, in the optical by rotse and a host of othertelescopes and was detected in the radio by the vla. the redshift of z= 3.355+/- 0.005 was determined by keck/hires and confirmed by rtt150 and not. theprompt gamma/x-ray emission, detected over 0.3-10^3 kev, systematically softensover time, with e_peak moving from ~600 kev at the start to ~40 kev around 100s after the trigger; alternatively, this spectral evolution could be identifiedwith the blackbody temperature of a quasithermal model shifting from ~60 kev to~3 kev over the same time interval. the first optical detection was made at 38s, but the smooth, featureless profile of the full optical coverage impliesthat this originated from the afterglow component, not the pulsed/flaringprompt emission.  broadband optical and x-ray coverage of the afterglow at the start of thefinal x-ray decay (~8 ks) reveals a spectral break between the optical andx-ray bands in the range 10^15 - 2x10^16 hz. the decay profiles of the x-rayand optical bands show that this break initially migrates blueward to thisfrequency and then subsequently drifts redward to below the optical band by~3x10^5 s. grb 080810 was very energetic, with an isotropic energy output forthe prompt component of 3x10^53 erg and 1.6x10^52 erg for the afterglow; thereis no evidence for a jet break in the afterglow up to six days following theburst.

0911.1214	the x-ray absorbing column densities of swift gamma-ray bursts	long gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are associated with the explosion of massivestars in star forming regions. a large fraction of grbs show intrinsicabsorption as detected in optical spectra but absorption signatures are alsodetectable in afterglow x-ray spectra. we present here a comprehensive analysisthe full sample of 93 grbs with known redshift promptly observed by swift xrtup to june 2009. the distribution of x-ray column densities clearly shows thatgrbs are heavily absorbed indicating that they indeed occur in denseenvironments. furthermore, there is a lack of heavily absorbed grbs at lowredshift (z&lt;1-2) that might therefore be candidates for the missing `dark' grbpopulation. however, there is no statistically significant correlation betweenthe amount of x-ray absorption and the `darkness' of a grb. finally, we comparethe hydrogen column densities derived in the optical with those derived fromx-ray absorption. the two distributions are different, with the optical columndensities being lower than the x-ray ones, which is even more apparent whencorrecting for metallicity effects. the most likely explanation isphotoionization of hydrogen in the circumburst material caused by the radiationfield of the burst.

0911.3150	unveiling the origin of grb 090709a: lack of periodicity in a reddened  cosmological long-duration gamma-ray burst	we present broadband (gamma-ray, x-ray, near-infrared, optical, and radio)observations of the gamma-ray burst (grb) 090709a and its afterglow in aneffort to ascertain the origin of this high-energy transient. previous analysessuggested that grb 090709a exhibited quasi-periodic oscillations with a periodof 8.06 s, a trait unknown in long-duration grbs but typical of flares fromsoft gamma-ray repeaters. when properly accounting for the underlying shape ofthe power-density spectrum of grb 090709a, we find no conclusive (&gt; 3 sigma)evidence for the reported periodicity. in conjunction with the location of thetransient (far from the galactic plane and absent any nearby host galaxy in thelocal universe) and the evidence for extinction in excess of the galacticvalue, we consider a magnetar origin relatively unlikely. a long-duration grb,however, can account for the majority of the observed properties of thissource. grb 090709a is distinguished from other long-duration grbs primarily bythe large amount of obscuration from its host galaxy (a_k,obs &gt;~ 2 mag).

0911.3901	grb 090313: x-shooter's first shot at a grb	context. x-shooter is the first second-generation instrument to becomeoperative at the eso very large telescope (vlt). it is a broad-bandmedium-resolution spectrograph designed with gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglowspectroscopy as one of its main science drivers.  aims. during the first commissioning night on sky with the instrument fullyassembled, x-shooter observed the afterglow of grb 090313 as a demonstration ofthe instrument's capabilities.  methods. grb 090313 was observed almost two days after the burst onset, whenthe object had already faded to r~21.6. furthermore, the 90% illuminated moonwas just 30 degrees away from the field. in spite of the adverse conditions, weobtained a spectrum that, for the first time in grb research, coverssimultaneously the range from 5700 to 23000 angstroms.  results. the spectrum shows multiple absorption features at a redshift of3.3736, the redshift of the grb. these features are composed of 3 componentswith different ionisation levels and velocities. some of the features havenever been observed before in a grb at such a high redshift. furthermore, wedetect two intervening systems at redshifts of 1.8005 and 1.9597.  conclusions. these results demonstrate the potential of x-shooter in the grbfield, as it was capable of observing a grb down to a magnitude limit thatwould include 72% of long grb afterglows 2 hours after the burst onset. coupledwith the rapid response mode available at vlt, allowing reaction times of justa few minutes, x-shooter constitutes an important leap forward on mediumresolution spectroscopic studies of grbs, their host galaxies and interveningsystems, probing the early history of the universe.

1006.4469	searching for differences in swift's intermediate grbs	gamma-ray bursts are usually classified through their high-energy emissioninto short-duration and long-duration bursts, which presumably reflect twodifferent types of progenitors. however, it has been shown on statisticalgrounds that a third, intermediate population is needed in this classificationscheme, although an extensive study of the properties of this class has so farnot been done. the large amount of follow-up studies generated during the swiftera allows us to have a suficient sample to attempt a study of this thirdpopulation through the properties of their prompt emission and theirafterglows. our study is focused on a sample of grbs observed by swift duringits first four years of operation. the sample contains those bursts withmeasured redshift since this allows us to derive intrinsic properties.intermediate bursts are less energetic and have dimmer afterglows than longgrbs, especially when considering the x-ray light curves, which are on averageone order of magnitude fainter than long bursts. there is a less significanttrend in the redshift distribution that places intermediate bursts closer thanlong bursts. except for this, intermediate bursts show similar properties tolong bursts. in particular, they follow the epeak vs. eiso correlation andhave, on average, positive spectral lags with a distribution similar to that oflong bursts. like long grbs, they normally have an associated supernova,although some intermediate bursts have shown no supernova component. this studyshows that intermediate bursts are different from short bursts and, in spite ofsharing many properties with long bursts, there are some differences betweenthem as well. we suggest that the physical difference between intermediate andlong bursts could be that for the first the ejecta are thin shells while forthe latter they are thick shells.

1007.5357	vlt/x-shooter spectroscopy of the grb 090926a afterglow	the aim of this paper is to study the environment and intervening absorbersof the gamma-ray burst grb 090926a through analysis of optical spectra of itsafterglow. we analyze medium resolution spectroscopic observations (r=10 000,corresponding to 30 km/s, s/n=15 - 30 and wavelength range 3000-25000) of theoptical afterglow of grb 090926a, taken with x-shooter at the vlt ~ 22 hr afterthe grb trigger. the spectrum shows that the ism in the grb host galaxy at z =2.1071 is rich in absorption features, with two components contributing to theline profiles. in addition to the ground state lines, we detect c ii, o i, siii, fe ii and ni ii excited absorption features. no host galaxy emission lines,molecular absorption features nor diffuse interstellar bands are detected inthe spectrum. the hydrogen column density associated to grb 090926a is logn_h/cm^{-2} = 21.60 +/- 0.07, and the metallicity of the host galaxy is in therange [x/h] =3.2x10^{-3}-1.2x10^{-2} with respect to the solar values, i.e.,among the lowest values ever observed for a grb host galaxy. a comparison withgalactic chemical evolution models has suggested that the host of grb090926a islikely to be a dwarf irregular galaxy. we put an upper limit to the hydrogenmolecular fraction of the host galaxy ism, which is f &lt; 7x10^{-7}. we deriveinformation on the distance between the host absorbing gas and the site of thegrb explosion. the distance of component i is found to be 2.40 +/- 0.15 kpc,while component ii is located far away from the grb, possibly at ~ 5 kpc. thesevalues are compatible with that found for other grbs.

1105.3015	an unusual stellar death on christmas day	long gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are the most dramatic examples of massivestellar deaths, usually as- sociated with supernovae (woosley et al. 2006).they release ultra-relativistic jets producing non-thermal emission throughsynchrotron radiation as they interact with the surrounding medium (zhang etal. 2004). here we report observations of the peculiar grb 101225a (the"christmas burst"). its gamma-ray emission was exceptionally long and followedby a bright x-ray transient with a hot thermal component and an unusual opticalcounterpart. during the first 10 days, the optical emission evolved as anexpanding, cooling blackbody after which an additional component, consistentwith a faint supernova, emerged. we determine its distance to 1.6 gpc byfitting the spectral-energy distribution and light curve of the opticalemission with a grb-supernova template. deep optical observations may haverevealed a faint, unresolved host galaxy. our proposed progenitor is a heliumstar-neutron star merger that underwent a common envelope phase expelling itshydrogen envelope. the resulting explosion created a grb-like jet which getsthermalized by interacting with the dense, previously ejected material and thuscreating the observed black-body, until finally the emission from the supernovadominated. an alternative explanation is a minor body falling onto a neutronstar in the galaxy (campana et al. 2011).

1107.3748	grb 070125 and the environments of spectral-line poor afterglow  absorbers	grb 070125 is among the most energetic bursts detected and the mostextensively observed so far. nevertheless, unresolved issues are still open inthe literature on the physics of the afterglow and on the grb environment. inparticular, grb 070125 was claimed to have exploded in a galactic haloenvironment, based on the uniqueness of the optical spectrum and thenon-detection of an underlying host galaxy. in this work we collect allpublicly available data and address these issues by modelling the nir-to-x-rayspectral energy distribution (sed) and studying the high signal-to-noisevlt/fors afterglow spectrum in comparison with a larger sample of grbabsorbers. the sed reveals a synchrotron cooling break in the uv, lowequivalent hydrogen column density and little reddening caused by a lmc- orsmc-type extinction curve. from the weak mgii absorption at z=1.5477 in thespectrum, we derived logn(mgii)=12.96+0.13-0.18 and upper limits on the ioniccolumn density of several metals. these suggest that the grb absorber is mostlikely an lls with a 0.03z\odot&lt;z&lt;1.3z\odot metallicity. the comparison withother grb absorbers places grb070125 at the low end of the absorption lineequivalent width distribution, confirming that weak spectral features andspectral-line poor absorbers are not so uncommon in afterglow spectra.moreover, we show that the effect of photo-ionization on the gas surroundingthe grb, combined with a low n(hi) along a short segment of the line of sightwithin the host galaxy, can explain the lack of spectral features in grb070125.finally, the non-detection of an underlying galaxy is consistent with a faintgrb host galaxy, well within the grb host brightness distribution. thus, thepossibility that grb070125 is simply located in the outskirts of a gas-rich,massive star-forming region inside its small and faint host galaxy seems morelikely than a gas-poor, halo environment origin.

1107.3841	grb091127/sn2009nz and the vlt/x-shooter spectroscopy of its host  galaxy: probing the faint end of the mass-metallicity relation	we perform a detailed study of the gamma-ray burst grb091127/sn2009nz hostgalaxy at z=0.490 using the vlt/x-shooter spectrograph in slit andintegral-field unit (ifu). from the analysis of the optical and x-ray afterglowdata obtained from ground-based telescopes and swift-xrt we confirm thepresence of a bump associated with sn2009nz and find evidence of a possible jetbreak in the afterglow lightcurve. the x-shooter afterglow spectra revealseveral emission lines from the underlying host, from which we derive itsintegrated properties. these are in agreement with those of previously studiedgrb-sn hosts and, more generally, with those of the long grb host population.we use the hubble space telescope and ground based images of the host todetermine its stellar mass (m_star). our results extend to lower m_star valuesthe m-z plot derived for the sample of long grb hosts at 0.3&lt;z&lt;1.0 adding newinformation to probe the faint end of the m-z relation and the shift of thelgrb host m-z relation from that found from emission line galaxy surveys.thanks to the ifu spectroscopy we can build the 2d velocity, velocitydispersion and star formation rate (sfr) maps. they show that the host galaxyhas a perturbed rotation kinematics with evidence of a sfr enhancementconsistent with the afterglow position.

1111.0283	panchromatic observations of the textbook grb 110205a: constraining  physical mechanisms of prompt emission and afterglow	we present a comprehensive analysis of a bright, long duration (t90 ~ 257 s)grb 110205a at redshift z= 2.22. the optical prompt emission was detected byswift/uvot, rotse-iiib and bootes telescopes when the grb was still radiatingin the gamma-ray band. nearly 200 s of observations were obtainedsimultaneously from optical, x-ray to gamma-ray, which makes it one of theexceptional cases to study the broadband spectral energy distribution across 6orders of magnitude in energy during the prompt emission phase. by fitting thetime resolved prompt spectra, we clearly identify, for the first time, aninteresting two-break energy spectrum, roughly consistent with the standard grbsynchrotron emission model in the fast cooling regime. although the promptoptical emission is brighter than the extrapolation of the best fit x/gamma-rayspectra, it traces the gamma-ray light curve shape, suggesting a relation tothe prompt high energy emission. the synchrotron + ssc scenario is disfavoredby the data, but the models invoking a pair of internal shocks or having twoemission regions can interpret the data well. shortly after prompt emission (~1100 s), a bright (r = 14.0) optical emission hump with very steep rise (alpha~ 5.5) was observed which we interpret as the emission from the reverse shock.it is the first time that the rising phase of a reverse shock component hasbeen closely observed. the full optical and x-ray afterglow lightcurves can beinterpreted within the standard reverse shock (rs) + forward shock (fs) model.in general, the high quality prompt emission and afterglow data allow us toapply the standard fireball shock model to extract valuable information aboutthe grb including the radiation mechanism, radius of prompt emission r, initiallorentz factor of the outflow, the composition of the ejecta, as well as thecollimation angle and the total energy budget.

1201.1292	the origin of the early time optical emission of swift grb 080310	we present broadband multi-wavelength observations of grb 080310 at redshiftz = 2.43. this burst was bright and long-lived, and unusual in having extensiveoptical and near ir follow-up during the prompt phase. using these data weattempt to simultaneously model the gamma-ray, x-ray, optical and ir emissionusing a series of prompt pulses and an afterglow component. initial attempts toextrapolate the high energy model directly to lower energies for each pulsereveal that a spectral break is required between the optical regime and 0.3 kevto avoid over predicting the optical flux. we demonstrate that afterglowemission alone is insufficient to describe all morphology seen in the opticaland ir data. allowing the prompt component to dominate the early-time opticaland ir and permitting each pulse to have an independent low energy spectralindices we produce an alternative scenario which better describes the opticallight curve. this, however, does not describe the spectral shape of grb 080310at early times. the fit statistics for the prompt and afterglow dominatedmodels are nearly identical making it difficult to favour either. however oneenduring result is that both models require a low energy spectral indexconsistent with self absorption for at least some of the pulses identified inthe high energy emission model.

1202.0347	the shallow-decay phase in both optical and x-ray afterglows of swift  grb 090529a: energy injection into a wind-type medium?	the energy injection model is usually proposed to interpret the shallow-decayphase in swift grb x-ray afterglows. however, very few grbs have simultaneoussignatures of energy injection in their optical and x-ray afterglows. here, wereport optical observations of grb 090529a from 2000 sec to $\sim10^6$ secafter the burst, in which an achromatic decay is seen at both wavelengths. theoptical light curve shows a decay from 0.37 to 0.99 with a break at $\sim10^5$sec. in the same time interval, the decay indices of the x-ray light curvechanged from 0.04 to 1.2. comparing these values with the closure relations,the segment after 3$\times10^{4}$ sec is consistent with the prediction of theforward shock in an ism medium without any energy injection. the shallow-decayphase between 2000 to 3$\times10^{4}$ sec could be due to the external shock ina wind-type-like medium with an energy injection under the condition of $\nu_o&lt; \nu_c &lt; \nu_x$. however, the constraint of the spectral region is not wellconsistent with the multi-band observations. for this shallow-decay phase,other models are also possible, such as energy injection with evolvingmicrophysical parameters, or a jet viewed off-axis,etc.

1202.1434	a deep search for the host galaxies of grbs with no detected optical  afterglow	gamma-ray bursts can provide information about star formation at highredshifts. even in the absence of a optical/near-infrared/radio afterglow, thehigh detection rate of x-ray afterglows by swift/xrt and its localizationprecision of 2-3 arcsec facilitates the identification and study of grb hostgalaxies. we focus on the search for the host galaxies of a sample of 17 burstswith xrt error circles but no detected long-wavelength afterglow. three ofthese events can also be classified as truly dark bursts: the observed upperlimit on the optical flux of the afterglow was less than expected based on thex-ray flux. our study is based on deep r and k-band observations performed witheso/vlt instruments, supported by grond and newfirm. to be conservative, wesearched for host galaxies in an area with a radius twice the 90% swift/xrterror circle. for 15 of the 17 bursts we find at least one galaxy inside thedoubled xrt error circle. in seven cases we discover extremely red objects inthe error circles. the most remarkable case is the host of grb 080207 which asa colour of r-k~4.7 mag (ab), one of the reddest galaxies ever associated witha grb. as a by-product of our study we identify the optical afterglow of grb070517a. optically dim afterglows result from cosmological lyman drop out anddust extinction, but the former process is only equired for a minority of cases(&lt;1/3). extinction by dust in the host galaxies might explain all other events.thereby, a seemingly non-negligible fraction of these hosts are globallydust-enshrouded, extremely red galaxies. this suggests that bursts withoptically dim afterglows trace a subpopulation of massive starburst galaxies,which are markedly different from the main body of the grb host galaxypopulation, namely the blue, subluminous, compact galaxies.

1203.4265	detailed optical and near-infrared polarimetry, spectroscopy and  broadband photometry of the afterglow of grb 091018: polarisation evolution	[abridged] a number of phenomena have been observed in grb afterglows thatdefy explanation by simple versions of the standard fireball model, leading toa variety of new models. polarimetry can be a major independent diagnostic ofafterglow physics, probing the magnetic field properties and internal structureof the grb jets. in this paper we present the first high quality multi-nightpolarimetric light curve of a swift grb afterglow, aimed at providing a wellcalibrated dataset of a typical afterglow to serve as a benchmark system formodelling afterglow polarisation behaviour. in particular, our dataset of theafterglow of grb 091018 (at redshift z=0.971) comprises optical linearpolarimetry (r band, 0.13 - 2.3 days after burst); circular polarimetry (rband) and near-infrared linear polarimetry (ks band). we add to that highquality optical and near-infrared broadband light curves and spectral energydistributions as well as afterglow spectroscopy. the linear polarisation variesbetween 0 and 3%, with both long and short time scale variability visible. wefind an achromatic break in the afterglow light curve, which corresponds tofeatures in the polarimetric curve. we find that the data can be reproduced byjet break models only if an additional polarised component of unknown nature ispresent in the polarimetric curve. we probe the ordered magnetic fieldcomponent in the afterglow through our deep circular polarimetry, findingp_circ &lt; 0.15% (2 sigma), the deepest limit yet for a grb afterglow, suggestingordered fields are weak, if at all present. our simultaneous r and ks bandpolarimetry shows that dust induced polarisation in the host galaxy is likelynegligible.

1207.3003	comprehensive multi-wavelength modelling of the afterglow of grb050525a	the swift era has posed a challenge to the standard blast-wave model of gammaray burst (grb) afterglows. the key observational features expected within themodel are rarely observed, such as the achromatic steepening (`jet-break') ofthe light curves. the observed afterglow light curves showcase additionalcomplex features requiring modifications within the standard model. here wepresent optical/nir observations, millimeter upper limits and comprehensivebroadband modelling of the afterglow of the bright grb 0505025a, detected byswift. this afterglow cannot be explained by the simplistic form of thestandard blast-wave model. we attempt modelling the multi-wavelength lightcurves using (i) a forward-reverse shock model, (ii) a two-component outflowmodel and (iii) blast-wave model with a wind termination shock. theforward-reverse shock model cannot explain the evolution of the afterglow. thetwo component model is able to explain the average behaviour of the afterglowvery well but cannot reproduce the fluctuations in the early x-ray light curve.the wind termination shock model reproduces the early light curves well butdeviates from the global behaviour of the late-time afterglow.

1209.0891	the distribution of equivalent widths in long grb afterglow spectra	the extreme brightness of gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglows and their simplespectral shape make them ideal beacons to study the interstellar medium oftheir host galaxies through absorption line spectroscopy. using 69low-resolution grb afterglow spectra, we conduct a study of the rest-frameequivalent width (ew) distribution of features with an average rest-frame ewlarger than 0.5 a. to compare an individual grb with the sample, we develop ewdiagrams as a graphical tool, and we give a catalogue with diagrams for the 69spectra. we introduce a line strength parameter (lsp) that allows us toquantify the strength of the absorption features as compared to the sample by asingle number. using the distributions of ews of single-species features, wederive the distribution of column densities by a curve of growth (cog) fit. wefind correlations between the lsp and the extinction of the grb, the uvbrightness of the host galaxies and the neutral hydrogen column density.however, we see no significant evolution of the lsp with the redshift. there isa weak correlation between the ionisation of the absorbers and the energy ofthe grb, indicating that, either the grb event is responsible for part of theionisation, or that galaxies with high-ionisation media produce more energeticgrbs. spectral features in grb spectra are, on average, 2.5 times stronger thanthose seen in qso intervening damped lyman-alpha (dla) systems and slightlymore ionised. in particular we find larger excess in the ew of civ1549 relativeto qso dlas, which could be related to an excess of wolf-rayet stars in theenvironments of grbs. from the cog fitting we obtain an average number ofcomponents in the absorption features of grbs of 6.00(-1.25,+1.00). the mostextreme ionisation ratios in our sample are found for grbs with low neutralhydrogen column density, which could be related to ionisation by the grbemission.

0712.2186	the afterglows of swift-era gamma-ray bursts. i. comparing pre-swift and  swift era long/soft (type ii) grb optical afterglows	we have gathered optical photometry data from the literature on a largesample of swift-era gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglows including grbs up toseptember 2009, for a total of 76 grbs, and present an additional threepre-swift grbs not included in an earlier sample. furthermore, we publish 840additional new photometry data points on a total of 42 grb afterglows,including large data sets for grbs 050319, 050408, 050802, 050820a, 050922c,060418, 080413a and 080810. we analyzed the light curves of all grbs in thesample and derived spectral energy distributions for the sample with the bestdata quality, allowing us to estimate the host galaxy extinction. wetransformed the afterglow light curves into an extinction-corrected z=1 systemand compared their luminosities with a sample of pre-swift afterglows. theresults of a former study, which showed that grb afterglows clustered andexhibited a bimodal distribution in luminosity space, is weakened by the largersample. we found that the luminosity distribution of the two afterglow samples(swift-era and pre-swift) are very similar, and that a subsample for which wewere not able to estimate the extinction, which is fainter than the mainsample, can be explained by assuming a moderate amount of line-of-sight hostextinction. we derived bolometric isotropic energies for all grbs in oursample, and found only a tentative correlation between the prompt energyrelease and the optical afterglow luminosity at one day after the grb in thez=1 system. a comparative study of the optical luminosities of grb afterglowswith echelle spectra (which show a high number of foreground absorbing systems)and those without reveals no indication that the former are statisticallysignificantly more luminous.

1302.2352	a new population of ultra-long duration gamma-ray bursts	we present comprehensive multiwavelength observations of three gamma-raybursts (grbs) with durations of several thousand seconds. we demonstrate thatthese events are extragalactic transients; in particular we resolve thelong-standing conundrum of the distance of grb 101225a (the "christmas-dayburst"), finding it to have a redshift z=0.847, and showing that two apparentlysimilar events (grb 111209a and grb 121027a) lie at z=0.677 and z=1.773respectively. the systems show extremely unusual x-ray and optical lightcurves,very different from classical grbs, with long lasting highly variable x-rayemission and optical light curves that exhibit little correlation with thebehaviour seen in the x-ray. their host galaxies are faint, compact, and highlystar forming dwarf galaxies, typical of "blue compact galaxies". we proposethat these bursts are the prototypes of a hitherto largely unrecognizedpopulation of ultra-long grbs, that while observationally difficult to detectmay be astrophysically relatively common. the long durations may naturally beexplained by the engine driven explosions of stars of much larger radii thannormally considered for grb progenitors which are thought to have compactwolf-rayet progenitor stars. however, we cannot unambiguously identifysupernova signatures within their light curves or spectra. we also consider thealternative possibility that they arise from the tidal disruption of stars bysupermassive black holes.

1304.7003	molecular hydrogen in the damped lyman-alpha system towards grb 120815a  at z=2.36	we present the discovery of molecular hydrogen (h_2), including the presenceof vibrationally-excited h_2^* in the optical spectrum of the afterglow of grb120815a at z=2.36 obtained with x-shooter at the vlt. simultaneous photometricbroad-band data from grond and x-ray observations by swift/xrt place furtherconstraints on the amount and nature of dust along the sightline. the galacticenvironment of grb 120815a is characterized by a strong dla withlog(n(h)/cm^-2) = 21.95 +/- 0.10, prominent h_2 absorption in the lyman-wernerbands (log(n(h_2)/cm^-2) = 20.53 +/- 0.13) and thus a molecular gas fractionlog f(h_2)=-1.14 +/- 0.15. the distance d between the absorbing neutral gas andgrb 120815a is constrained via photo-excitation modeling of fine-structure andmeta-stable transitions of feii and niii to d = 0.5 +/- 0.1 kpc. the dlametallicity ([zn/h] = -1.15 +/- 0.12), visual extinction (a_v &lt; 0.15 mag) anddust depletion ([zn/fe] = 1.01 +/- 0.10) are intermediate between the values ofwell-studied, h_2-deficient grb-dlas observed at high spectral resolution, andthe approximately solar metallicity, highly-obscured and h_2-rich grb 080607sightline. with respect to n(h), metallicity, as well as dust-extinction anddepletion, grb 120815a is fairly representative of the average properties ofgrb-dlas. this demonstrates that molecular hydrogen is present in at least afraction of the more typical grb-dlas, and h_2 and h_2^* are probably morewide-spread among grb-selected systems than the few examples of previousdetections would suggest.

1306.0892	the low-extinction afterglow in the solar-metallicity host galaxy of  gamma-ray burst 110918a	metallicity is theoretically thought to be a fundamental driver in gamma-rayburst (grb) explosions and energetics, but is still, even after more than adecade of extensive studies, not fully understood. this is largely related totwo phenomena: a dust-extinction bias, that prevented high-mass and thus likelyhigh-metallicity grb hosts to be detected in the first place, and a lack ofefficient instrumentation, that limited spectroscopic studies includingmetallicity measurements to the low-redshift end of the grb host population.the subject of this work is the very energetic grb 110918a, for which wemeasure a redshift of z=0.984. grb 110918a gave rise to a luminous afterglowwith an intrinsic spectral slope of b=0.70, which probed a sight-line withlittle extinction (a_v=0.16 mag) typical of the established distributions ofafterglow properties. photometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations ofthe galaxy hosting grb 110918a, including optical/nir photometry with grond andspectroscopy with vlt/x-shooter, however, reveal an all but average grb host incomparison to the z~1 galaxies selected through similar afterglows to date. ithas a large spatial extent with a half-light radius of ~10 kpc, the higheststellar mass for z&lt;1.9 (log(m_*/m_sol) = 10.68+-0.16), and an halpha-based starformation rate of 41 m_sol/yr. we measure a gas-phase extinction of ~1.8 magthrough the balmer decrement and one of the largest host-integratedmetallicities ever of around solar (12 + log(o/h) = 8.93+/-0.13). this presentsone of the very few robust metallicity measurements of grb hosts at z~1, andestablishes that grb hosts at z~1 can also be very metal rich. it conclusivelyrules out a metallicity cut-off in grb host galaxies and argues against ananti-correlation between metallicity and energy release in grbs.

1311.6466	spatially-resolved dust properties of the grb 980425 host galaxy	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been proposed as a tool for studying starformation in the universe, so it is crucial to investigate whether their hostgalaxies and immediate environments are in any way special compared with otherstar-forming galaxies. here we present spatially resolved maps of dust emissionof the host galaxy of the closest known grb 980425 at z=0.0085 using our newhigh-resolution observations from herschel, atacama pathfinder experiment(apex), atacama large millimeter array (alma) and australia telescope compactarray (atca). we modelled the spectral energy distributions of the host and ofthe star-forming region displaying the wolf-rayet signatures in the spectrum(wr region), located 800 pc from the grb position. the host is characterised bylow dust content and a high fraction of uv-visible star formation, similar toother dwarf galaxies. these galaxies are abundant in the local universe, so itis not surprising to find a grb in one of them, assuming the correspondencebetween the grb rate and star formation. the wr region contributessubstantially to the host emission at the far-infrared, millimetre, and radiowavelengths and we propose that this is a consequence of its high gas density.if dense environments are also found close to the positions of other grbs, thenthe ism density should also be considered, along with metallicity, an importantfactor influencing whether a given stellar population can produce a grb.

1401.3774	grb 120422a/sn 2012bz: bridging the gap between low- and high-luminosity  grbs	at low redshift, a handful of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been discoveredwith peak luminosities ($l_{\rm iso} &lt; 10^{48.5}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}$)substantially lower than the average of the more distant ones ($l_{\rm iso} &gt;10^{49.5}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}$). the properties of several low-luminosity(low-$l$) grbs indicate that they can be due to shock break-out, as opposed tothe emission from ultrarelativistic jets. owing to this, it is highly debatedhow both populations are connected, and whether there is a continuum betweenthem. the burst at redshift $z=0.283$ from 2012 april 22 is one of the very fewexamples of intermediate-$l$ grbs with a $\gamma$-ray luminosity of$l\sim10^{48.9}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}$ that have been detected up to now. togetherwith the robust detection of its accompanying supernova sn 2012bz, it has thepotential to answer important questions on the origin of low- and high-$l$ grbsand the grb-sn connection. we carried out a spectroscopy campaign using medium-and low-resolution spectrographs at 6--10-m class telescopes, covering the timespan of 37.3 days, and a multi-wavelength imaging campaign from radio to x-rayenergies over a duration of $\sim270$ days. furthermore, we used a tuneablefilter centred at h$\alpha$ to map star formation in the host galaxy and thesurrounding galaxies. we used these data to extract and model the properties ofdifferent radiation components and incorporate spectral-energy-distributionfitting techniques to extract the properties of the host galaxy. modelling thelight curve and spectral energy distribution from the radio to the x-raysrevealed the blast-wave to expand with an initial lorentz factor of$\gamma_0\sim60$, low for a high-$l$ grb, and that the afterglow had anexceptional low peak luminosity-density of$\lesssim2\times10^{30}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}\,\rm{hz}^{-1}$ in the sub-mm.[abridged]

1402.0766	on the nature of the 'hostless' short grbs	a significant proportion ($\sim30\%$) of the short-duration gamma-ray bursts(sgrbs) localised by swift have no detected host galaxy coincident with theburst location to deep limits, and also no high-likelihood association withproximate galaxies on the sky. these sgrbs may represent a population atmoderately high redshifts ($z\gtrsim1$), for which the hosts are faint, or apopulation where the progenitor has been kicked far from its host or is sitedin an outlying globular cluster. we consider the afterglow and hostobservations of three 'hostless' bursts (grbs 090305a, 091109b and 111020a),coupled with a new observational diagnostic to aid the association of sgrbswith putative host galaxies to investigate this issue. considering the welllocalised sgrb sample, 7/25 sgrbs can be classified as 'hostless' by ourdiagnostic. statistically, however, the proximity of these seven sgrbs tonearby galaxies is higher than is seen for random positions on the sky. thissuggests that the majority of 'hostless' sgrbs have likely been kicked fromproximate galaxies at moderate redshift. though this result still suggests onlya small proportion of sgrbs will be within the adligo horizon for ns-ns orns-bh inspiral detection ($z\sim0.1$), in the particular case of grb 111020a aplausible host candidate is at $z=0.02$.

1402.4026	vlt/x-shooter spectroscopy of the grb 120327a afterglow	we present a study of the environment of the swift long gamma-ray burst grb120327a at z ~2.8 through optical spectroscopy of its afterglow. we analyzedmedium-resolution, multi-epoch spectroscopic observations (~7000 - 12000,corresponding to ~ 15 - 23 km/s, s/n = 15- 30 and wavelength range3000-25000aa) of the optical afterglow of grb 120327a, taken with x-shooter atthe vlt 2.13 and 27.65 hr after the grb trigger. the first epoch spectrum showsthat the ism in the grb host galaxy at z = 2.8145 is extremely rich inabsorption features, with three components contributing to the line profiles.the hydrogen column density associated with grb 120327a has log nh / cm^(-2) =22.01 +/- 0.09, and the metallicity of the host galaxy is in the range [x/h] =-1.3 to -1.1. in addition to the ground state lines, we detect absorptionfeatures associated with excited states of cii, oi, siii, feii, and niii, whichwe used to derive information on the distance between the host absorbing gasand the site of the grb explosion. the variability of the fei\lambda2396excited line between the two epochs proves that these features are excited bythe grb uv flux. moreover, the distance of component i is found to bedi=200+100-60 pc, while component ii is located closer to the grb, atdii=100+40-30 pc. these values are among the lowest found in grbs. componentiii does not show excited transitions, so it should be located farther awayfrom the grb. the presence of h2 molecules is firmly established, with amolecular fraction in the range f=4 x 10^(-7) - 10^(-4). this particularly lowvalue can be attributed to the small dust content. this represents the thirdpositive detection of molecules in a grb environment.

1409.8331	spectroscopy of superluminous supernova host galaxies. a preference of  hydrogen-poor events for extreme emission line galaxies	superluminous supernovae (slsne) are very bright explosions that were onlydiscovered recently and that show a preference for occurring in faint dwarfgalaxies. understanding why stellar evolution yields different types of stellarexplosions in these environments is fundamental in order to both uncover theelusive progenitors of slsne and to study star formation in dwarf galaxies. inthis paper, we present the first results of our project to study superluminoussupernova host galaxies, focusing on the sample for which we have obtainedspectroscopy. we show that slsne-i and slsne-r (hydrogen-poor) often (~50% inour sample) occur in a class of galaxies that is known as extreme emission linegalaxies (eelgs). the probability of this happening by chance is negligible andwe therefore conclude that the extreme environmental conditions and the slsnphenomenon are related. in contrast, slsne-ii (hydrogen-rich) occur in moremassive, more metal-rich galaxies with softer radiation fields. therefore, ifslsne-ii constitute a uniform class, their progenitor systems are likelydifferent from those of h-poor slsne. gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are, on average,not found in as extreme environments as h-poor slsne. we propose that h-poorslsne result from the very first stars exploding in a starburst, even earlierthan grbs. this might indicate a bottom-light initial mass function in thesesystems. slsne present a novel method of selecting candidate eelgs independentof their luminosity.

1503.03623	spectrophotometric analysis of grb afterglow extinction curves with  x-shooter	in this work we use gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglow spectra observed with thevlt/x-shooter spectrograph to measure rest-frame extinction in grblines-of-sight by modeling the broadband near-infrared (nir) to x-ray afterglowspectral energy distributions (seds). our sample consists of nine swift grbs,eight of them belonging to the long-duration and one to the short-durationclass. dust is modeled using the average extinction curves of the milky way andthe two magellanic clouds. we derive the rest-frame extinction of the entiresample, which fall in the range $0 \lesssim {\it a}_{\rm v} \lesssim 1.2$.moreover, the smc extinction curve is the preferred extinction curve templatefor the majority of our sample, a result which is in agreement with thosecommonly observed in grb lines-of-sights. in one analysed case (grb 120119a),the common extinction curve templates fail to reproduce the observedextinction. to illustrate the advantage of using the high-quality x-shooterafterglow seds over the photometric seds, we repeat the modeling using thebroadband seds with the nir-to-uv photometric measurements instead of thespectra. the main result is that the spectroscopic data, thanks to acombination of excellent resolution and coverage of the blue part of the sed,are more successful in constraining the extinction curves and therefore thedust properties in grb hosts with respect to photometric measurements. in allcases but one the extinction curve of one template is preferred over theothers. we show that the modeled values of the extinction and the spectralslope, obtained through spectroscopic and photometric sed analysis, can differsignificantly for individual events. finally we stress that, regardless of theresolution of the optical-to-nir data, the sed modeling gives reliable resultsonly when the fit is performed on a sed covering a broader spectral region.

1508.03094	massive stars formed in atomic hydrogen reservoirs: hi observations of  gamma-ray burst host galaxies	long gamma-ray bursts (grbs), among the most energetic events in theuniverse, are explosions of massive and short-lived stars, so they pinpointlocations of recent star formation. however, several grb host galaxies haverecently been found to be deficient in molecular gas (h2), believed to be thefuel of star formation. moreover, optical spectroscopy of grb afterglowsimplies that the molecular phase constitutes only a small fraction of the gasalong the grb line-of-sight. here we report the first ever 21 cm lineobservations of grb host galaxies, using the australia telescope compact array,implying high levels of atomic hydrogen (hi), which suggests that theconnection between atomic gas and star formation is stronger than previouslythought, with star formation being potentially directly fuelled by atomic gas(or with very efficient hi-to-h2 conversion and rapid exhaustion of moleculargas), as has been theoretically shown to be possible. this can happen in lowmetallicity gas near the onset of star formation, because cooling of gas(necessary for star formation) is faster than the hi-to-h2 conversion. indeed,large atomic gas reservoirs, together with low molecular gas masses, stellarand dust masses are consistent with grb hosts being preferentially galaxieswhich have very recently started a star formation episode after accretingmetal-poor gas from the intergalactic medium. this provides a natural route forforming grbs in low-metallicity environments. the gas inflow scenario is alsoconsistent with the existence of the companion hi object with no opticalcounterpart ~19 kpc from the grb 060505 host, and with the fact that the hicentroids of the grb 980425 and 060505 hosts do not coincide with opticalcentres of these galaxies, but are located close to the grb positions.

astro-ph;0206201	detection of an optical transient following the 13 march 2000 short/hard  gamma-ray burst	we imaged the error box of a gamma-ray burst of the short (0.5 s), hard type(grb 000313), with the bootes-1 experiment in southern spain, starting 4 minafter the gamma-ray event, in the i-band. a bright optical transient (ot000313) with i = 9.4 +/- 0.1 was found in the bootes-1 image, close to theerror box (3-sigma) provided by batse. late time vrik'-band deep observationsfailed to reveal an underlying host galaxy. if the ot 000313 is related to theshort, hard grb 000313, this would be the first optical counterpart ever foundfor this kind of events (all counterparts to date have been found for bursts ofthe long, soft type). the fact that only prompt optical emission has beendetected (but no afterglow emission at all, as supported by theoretical models)might explain why no optical counterparts have ever been found for short, hardgrbs.this fact suggests that most short bursts might occur in a low-densitymedium and favours the models that relate them to binary mergers in verylow-density enviroments.

astro-ph;0312359	earliest spectroscopy of the grb030329 optical transient	we present the earliest bta (sao ras 6-m telescope) spectroscopicobservations of the grb030329 optical transient (ot), which almost coincide intime with the first "break" (t ~ 0.5 day after the grb) of the ot light curve.the bta/mpfs (multi pupil fiber spectrograph) spectra are clearly not smooth:the ot spectra showed a continuum with several broad spectral features at about4000, 4450, 5900aa. the ot spectrum showed some evolution starting from thefirst night after the burst, and the beginning of spectral changes are seen asearly as ~10-12 hours after the grb. the onset of the spectral changes for t &lt;1 day indicates that the contribution from type ic supernova (sn) into the otoptical flux can be detected earlier. so, summarizing our and otherspectroscopic data on the ot we confirm the evolution of the ot spectrum andcolor pointed also by other authors (hjorth et al. 2003; matheson et al.2003b). the early spectra of grb030329/sn2003dh properties can be consistentwith a shock moving into a stellar wind formed from the pre-sn. such a behavior(similar to one near the uv shock breakout in sne) can be explained by theexistence of a dense matter in the immediate surroundings of grb/sn progenitor.

astro-ph;0402240	on the afterglow of the x-ray flash of july 23 2003: photometric  evidence for an off-axis gamma-ray burst with an associated supernova?	we present optical and near-infrared follow-up observations of the x-rayflash (xrf) of july 23 2003. our observations in the r-band cover the temporalrange from 4.2 h to 64 days after the high energy event. we also present theresults of multicolor imaging extending to the k-band on three epochs. thelightcurve of the r-band afterglow the first week after the burst is similar tothe lightcurve for long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs), i.e., a brokenpower-law with a late time slope of alpha=-2.0 (f_nu propto t^alpha).furthermore, the spectral energy distribution (sed) has a power-law (f_nupropto nu^beta) shape with slope beta=-1.0. however, the decay slope at t&lt;1 dayis shallow, consistent with zero. this is in qualitative agreement with theprediction that xrfs are off-axis classical grbs. after the first week there isa strong bump in the lightcurve, which peaks at around 16 days. the sed afterthe peak becomes significantly redder. we discuss the possible interpretationsof this bump, and conclude that an underlying supernova is the most likelyexplanation since no other model appears consistent with the evolution of thesed. finally, we present deep spectroscopy of the burst both in the afterglowand in the bump phase. a firm upper limit of z=2.3 is placed on the redshift ofxrf030723 from the lack of ly-alpha forest lines in the spectrum of theafterglow. the lack of significant absorption and emission lines in either ofthe two spectra excludes a spectroscopic redshift determination.

astro-ph;0408041	probing a grb progenitor at a redshift of z=2: a comprehensive observing  campaign of the afterglow of grb 030226	we report results from a comprehensive follow-up observing campaign of theafterglow of grb 030226, including vlt spectroscopy, vlt polarimetry, andchandra x-ray observations. in addition, we present bootes-1 wide-fieldobservations at the time of the occurrence of the burst. first observations ateso started 0.2 days after the event when the grb afterglow was at a magnitudeof r~19 and continued until the afterglow had faded below the detectionthreshold (r&gt;26). no underlying host galaxy was found. the optical light curveshows a break around 0.8 days after the burst, which is achromatic within theobservational errors, supporting the view that it was due to a jettedexplosion. close to the break time the degree of linear polarization of theafterglow light was less than 1.1%, which favors a uniform jet model ratherthan a structured one. vlt spectra show two absorption line systems atredshifts z=1.962+/-0.001 and at z=1.986+/-0.001, placing the lower limit forthe redshift of the grb close to 2. we emphasize that the kinematics and thecomposition of the absorbing clouds responsible for these line systems is verysimilar to those observed in the afterglow of grb 021004. this corroborates thepicture in which at least some grbs are physically related to the explosion ofa wolf-rayet star.

astro-ph;0604093	physics of the grb 030328 afterglow and its environment	we report on the photometric, spectroscopic and polarimetric, monitoring ofthe optical afterglow of gamma-ray burst (grb) 030328 detected by hete-2.photometry, collected at 7 different telescopes, shows that a smoothly brokenpowerlaw decay, with indices alpha_1 = 0.76 +/- 0.03, alpha_2 = 1.50 +/- 0.07and a break at t_b = 0.48 +/- 0.03 days after the grb, provides the best fit ofthe optical afterglow decline. this shape is interpreted as due to collimatedemission, for which we determine a jet opening angle theta_{jet} of about 3.2degrees. an achromatic bump starting around 0.2 d after the grb is possiblymarginally detected in the optical light curves. optical spectroscopy shows thepresence of two rest-frame ultraviolet metal absorption systems at z = 1.5216+/- 0.0006 and at z = 1.295 +/- 0.001, the former likely associated with thegrb host galaxy. analysis of the absorption lines at z = 1.5216 suggests thatthe host of this grb may be a damped lyman-alpha absorber. the optical v-bandafterglow appears polarized, with p= (2.4 +/- 0.6) % and theta = (170 +/- 7)degrees, suggesting an asymmetric blastwave expansion. an x-ray-to-opticalspectral flux distribution of the grb 030328 afterglow was obtained at 0.78days after the grb and fitted using a broken powerlaw, with an optical spectralslope beta_{opt} = 0.47 +/- 0.15, and an x-ray slope beta_{x} = 1.0 +/- 0.2.the discussion of these results in the context of the "fireball model" showsthat the preferred scenario for this afterglow is collimated structured jetwith fixed opening angle in a homogeneous medium.

astro-ph;0610157	x-ray flashes or soft gamma-ray bursts? the case of the likely distant  xrf 040912	in this work, we present a multi-wavelength study of xrf 040912, aimed atmeasuring its distance scale and the intrinsic burst properties. we performed adetailed spectral and temporal analysis of both the prompt and the afterglowemission and we estimated the distance scale of the likely host galaxy. we thenused the currently available sample of xrfs with known distance to discuss theconnection between xrfs and classical gamma-ray bursts (grbs). we found thatthe prompt emission properties unambiguously identify this burst as an xrf,with an observed peak energy of e_p=17+/-13 kev and a burst fluence ratios(2-30kev)/s(30-400kev)&gt;1. a non-fading optical source with r~24 mag and withan apparently extended morphology is spatially consistent with the x-rayafterglow, likely the host galaxy. xrf 040912 is a very dark burst since noafterglow optical counterpart is detected down to r&gt;25 mag (3 sigma limitingmagnitude) at 13.6 hours after the burst. the host galaxy spectrum detectedfrom 3800a to 10000a, shows a single emission line at 9552a. the lack of anyother strong emission lines blue-ward of the detected one and the absence ofthe ly alpha cut-off down to 3800a are consistent with the hypothesis of the[oii] line at redshift z=1.563+/-0.001. the intrinsic spectral properties rankthis xrf among the soft grbs in the e_peak-e_iso diagram. similar results wereobtained for most xrfs at known redshift. only xrf 060218 and xrf 020903represent a good example of instrinsic xrf(i-xrf) and are possibly associatedwith a different progenitor population. this scenario may calls for a newdefinition of xrfs.

astro-ph;0701736	the nature of the x-ray flash of august 24 2005	we present comprehensive photometric r-band observations of the fadingoptical afterglow of the x-ray flash xrf050824, from 11 minutes to 104 daysafter the burst. the r-band lightcurve of the afterglow resembles thelightcurves of long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs), i.e., a power-law albeitwith a rather shallow slope of alpha=0.6. our late r-band images reveal thehost galaxy with a rest-frame b-band luminosity corresponding to roughly 0.5lstar. the star-formation rate as determined from the [o ii] emission lineluminosity is about 1.8 msun per year. when accounting for the hostcontribution, the slope is alpha=0.65+-0.01 and a break in the lightcurve isalso suggested. a potential lightcurve bump at 2 weeks can be interpreted as asupernova only if this is a supernova with a fast rise and a fast decay.however, the overall fit still show excess scatter in the lightcurve due towiggles and bumps. the flat lightcurves in the optical and x-rays could beexplained by a continuous energy injection scenario with an on-axis viewingangle and a wide jet opening angle (theta_j&gt;10 deg). if the energy injectionsare episodic, this could potentially help explain the bumps and wiggles.spectroscopy of the afterglow give a redshift of z=0.828+-0.005 from bothabsorption and emission lines. the spectral energy distribution (sed) of theafterglow has a power-law shape with slope beta=0.56+-0.04. this can becompared to the x-ray spectral index which is betax=1.0+-0.1. the curvature ofthe sed constrain the dust reddening towards the burst to av&lt;0.5 mag.(abridged)

0809.4231	optical and infrared flares from a transient galactic soft gamma-ray  repeater	soft gamma-ray repeaters (sgrs) are a rare type of gamma-ray transientsources that are ocasionally detected as bursts in the high-energy sky. theyare thought to be produced by magnetars, young neutron stars with very strongmagnetic fields of the order of 10^(14-15) g. only three such objects are knownin our galaxy, and a fourth one is associated with the supernova remnant n49 inthe large magellanic cloud. in none of these cases has an optical counterpartto either the gamma-ray flares or the quiescent source been identified. here wepresent multi-wavelength observations of a puzzling source, swiftj195509+261406, for which we detected more than 40 flaring episodes in theoptical band over a time span of 3 days, plus a faint infrared flare 11 dayslater, after which it returned to quiescence. we propose that swiftj195509+261406 is a member of a subgroup of sgrs for which the long-term x-rayemission is transient in nature. furthermore, it is the first sgr for whichbursts have been detected in the optical and near-infrared bands and maybe thelink between the "persistent" sgrs and the dim isolated neutron stars.

0810.2107	detection of the high z grb 080913 and its implications on progenitors  and energy extraction mechanisms	aims: we present multiwavelength observations of one of the most distantgamma-ray bursts detected so far, grb 080913. based on these observations, weconsider whether it could be classified as a short-duration grb and discuss theimplications for the progenitor nature and energy extraction mechanisms.  methods: multiwavelength x-ray, near ir and millimetre observations were madebetween 20.7 hours and 16.8 days after the event.  results: whereas a very faint afterglow was seen at the 3.5m caha telescopein the nir, the x-ray afterglow was clearly detected in both swift andxmm-newton observations. an upper limit is reported in the mm range. we havemodeled the data assuming a collimated $\theta_0$ $\gtrsim$ 3$^\circ$ blastwave with an energy injection at 0.5 days carrying $5\sim 10^{52}$ erg orapproximately 12 times the initial energy of the blast wave. we find that grb080913 shares many of the gamma-ray diagnostics with the more recent burst grb090423 for being classified as short had they ocurred at low redshift. if theprogenitor were a compact binary merger, it is likely composed by a ns and bh.the blandford-znajek (bz) mechanism is the preferred one to extract energy fromthe central, maximally-rotating bh. both the magnetic field close to the eventhorizon (b) and the bh mass ($m_{bh}$) are restricted within a relativelynarrow range, such that $(b / 3\times 10^{16} \rm{g}) (m_{bh} / 7 m_\odot) \sim1$. similar constraints on the central bh hold for collapsar-like progenitorsystems if the bz-mechanism works for the system at hand.

0810.4333	simultaneous polarization monitoring of supernovae sn2008d/xt080109 and  sn2007uy: isolating geometry from dust	the possible existence of a continuum encompassing the diversity of explosivestellar deaths,ranging from ordinary sne to relativistic hypernovae associatedwith long duration grbs, is under intense debate. in this context, sn2008dassociated with xt080109 could represent a paradigmatic case, since it mightexemplify a potential borderline event. the main aim is to infer geometricinformation of sn2008d through the evolution of its linear opticalpolarization. we also report the polarization evolution of sn2007uy, anddiscuss the properties of the host ism towards the xt. the final goal is tocompare the polarization properties, and hence the geometries of both sne,which shone contemporaneously in ngc2770. this fortunate coincidence brought usthe opportunity to observe both sne simultaneously, and most importantly, withidentical instrumental setups. the observations span 74.9 days, starting 3.6days after the xt and are distributed in 11 visits. in addition we performedobservations in the mm range in order to identify the dominant polarization. wereport positive linear polarization detections at several epochs for sn2008d ata level of ~1% and at ~1.5% for sn2007uy. sn2007uy shows constant polarization,which could be described by the host interstellar polarization plus a constanteccentricity expansion on the sky plane. a statistical analysis of thedistribution of the sn2008d stokes parametres suggests that it could show anintrinsic variable polarization component. assuming the sn2007uy polarizationis constant, we find that the evolution of the intrinsic sn2008d polarizationcould be explained by an aspherical axisymmetric expansion with variableeccentricity. we come to the same result even if we make no assumption onsn2007uy, although at a lower significance level. we suggest that at least theprojected, if not the intrinsic, geometries of both sne could differ.
