0902.2412	a pulsed, precessing jet in cepheus a	we present near-infrared h2, radio co, and thermal infrared observations ofthe nearby massive star-forming region cepheus a (cep a). from h2 bow shocksarranged along four distinct jet axes, we infer that the massive protostellarsource hw2 drives a pulsed, precessing jet that has changed its orientation byabout 45 degrees in roughly 104 years. the current hw2 radio jet represents themost recent event in this time series of eruptions. this scenario is consistentwith the recent discovery of a disk around hw2, perpendicular to the currentjet orientation, and with the presence of companions at projected distancescomparable to the disk radius. we propose that the cep a system formed by thedisk-assisted capture of a sibling star by hw2. we present a numerical model ofa 15 m_sun star with a circumstellar disk, orbited by a companion in aninclined, eccentric orbit. close passages of the companion through or near thedisk result in periods of enhanced accretion and mass loss, as well as forcedprecession of the disk and associated orientation changes in the jet. theobservations reveal a second powerful outflow that emerges from radio sourcehw3c or hw3d. this flow is associated with blueshifted co emission and a fainth2 bow shock to the east, and with hh 168 to the west. a collision between theflows from hw2 and hw3c/d may be responsible for x-ray and radio continuumemission in cep a west.

0903.0374	young stellar clusters and star formation throughout the galaxy	most stars are born in rich young stellar clusters (yscs) embedded in giantmolecular clouds. the most massive stars live out their short lives there,profoundly influencing their natal environments by ionizing hii regions,inflating wind-blown bubbles, and soon exploding as supernovae. thousands oflower-mass pre-main sequence stars accompany the massive stars, and theexpanding hii regions paradoxically trigger new star formation as they destroytheir natal clouds. while this schematic picture is established, ourunderstanding of the complex astrophysical processes involved in clustered starformation have only just begun to be elucidated. the technologies arechallenging, requiring both high spatial resolution and wide fields atwavelengths that penetrate obscuring molecular material and removecontaminating galactic field stars. we outline several important projects forthe coming decade: the imfs and structures of yscs; triggered star formationaround ysc; the fate of ob winds; the stellar populations of infrared darkclouds; the most massive star clusters in the galaxy; tracing star formationthroughout the galactic disk; the galactic center region and yscs in themagellanic clouds. programmatic recommendations include: developing a 30m-classadaptive optics infrared telescope; support for high-resolution and wide fieldx-ray telescopes; large-aperture sub-millimeter and far-infrared telescopes;multi-object infrared spectrographs; and both numerical and analytical theory.

1002.4898	hst/acs h-alpha imaging of the carina nebula: outflow activity traced by  irradiated herbig-haro jets	we report the discovery of new herbig-haro (hh) jets in the carina nebula,and we discuss the protostellar outflow activity of a young ob association.these are the first results of an hst/acs h-alpha imaging survey of carina.adding to the one previously known example (hh666), we detect 21 new hh jets,plus 17 new candidate jets, ranging in length from 0.005 to 3 pc. we derive jetmass-loss rates ranging from 8e-9 to 1e-6 msun/yr, but a comparison to thedistribution of jet mass-loss rates in orion suggests that we may be missing alarge fraction of the jets below 1e-8 msun/yr. a key qualitative result is thateven some of the smallest dark globules with sizes of 0.01pc are active sitesof ongoing star formation because we see hh jets emerging from them, and thatthese offer potential analogs to the cradle of our solar system because oftheir proximity to dozens of imminent supernovae that will enrich them withradioactive nuclides like 60fe. hst images reveal proplyd structures in thecore of the tr14 cluster, only 0.1-0.2 pc from several o-type stars. manyexamples of bent jets serve as "wind socks"; strong photoevaporative flows canshape the jets, competing with the direct winds and radiation from massivestars. finally, even allowing for a large number of jets that may escapedetection, we find that hh jets are negligible to the global turbulence of thesurrounding region, which is driven by massive star feedback.

1004.2263	spitzer space telescope observations of the carina nebula: the steady  march of feedback-driven star formation	we report the first results of imaging the carina nebula with spitzer/irac,providing a catalog of point sources and ysos based on sed fits. we discussseveral aspects of the extended emission, including dust pillars that resultwhen a clumpy molecular cloud is shredded by massive star feedback. there arefew "extended green objects" (egos) normally taken as signposts of outflowactivity, and none of the hh jets detected optically are seen as egos. apopulation of "extended red objects" tends to be found around ob stars, somewith clear bow-shocks. these are dusty shocks where stellar winds collide withflows off nearby clouds. finally, the relative distributions of o stars andsubclusters of ysos as compared to dust pillars shows that while some ysos arelocated within pillars, many more stars and ysos reside just outside pillarheads. we suggest that pillars are transient phenomena, part of a continuousoutwardly propagating wave of star formation driven by massive star feedback.as pillars are destroyed, they leave newly formed stars in their wake, whichare then subsumed into the young ob association. altogether, the currentgeneration of ysos shows no strong deviation from a normal imf. the number ofysos suggests a roughly constant star-formation rate over the past 3myr,implying that star formation in pillars constitutes an important mechanism toconstruct unbound ob associations. accelerated pillars may give birth to o-typestars that, after several myr, could appear to have formed in isolation.

1008.0871	an infrared through radio study of the properties and evolution of irdc  clumps	we examine the physical properties and evolutionary stages of a sample of 17clumps within 8 infrared dark clouds (irdcs) by combining existing infrared,millimeter, and radio data with new bolocam galactic plane survey (bgps) 1.1 mmdata, vla radio continuum data, and hht dense gas (hco+ and n2h+) spectroscopicdata. we combine literature studies of star formation tracers and dusttemperatures within irdcs with our search for ultra-compact (uc) hii regions todiscuss a possible evolutionary sequence for irdc clumps. in addition, weperform an analysis of mass tracers in irdcs and find that 8 micron extinctionmasses and 1.1 mm bolocam galactic plane survey (bgps) masses are complementarymass tracers in irdcs except for the most active clumps (notably thosecontaining uchii regions), for which both mass tracers suffer biases. we findthat the measured virial masses in irdc clumps are uniformly higher than themeasured dust continuum masses on the scale of ~1 pc. we use 13co, hco+, andn2h+ to study the molecular gas properties of irdcs and do not see any evidenceof chemical differentiation between hot and cold clumps on the scale of ~1 pc.however, both hco+ and n2h+ are brighter in active clumps, due to an increasein temperature and/or density. we report the identification of four uchiiregions embedded within irdc clumps and find that uchii regions are associatedwith bright (&gt;1 jy) 24 micron point sources, and that the brightest uchiiregions are associated with "diffuse red clumps" (an extended enhancement at 8micron). the broad stages of the discussed evolutionary sequence (from aquiescent clump to an embedded hii region) are supported by literature dusttemperature estimates; however, no sequential nature can be inferred betweenthe individual star formation tracers.

1011.0691	the bolocam galactic plane survey: survey description and data reduction	we present the bolocam galactic plane survey (bgps), a 1.1 mm continuumsurvey at 33" effective resolution of 170 square degrees of the galactic planevisible from the northern hemisphere. the survey is contiguous over the range-10.5 &lt; l &lt; 90.5, |b| &lt; 0.5 and encompasses 133 square degrees, including someextended regions |b| &lt; 1.5. in addition to the contiguous region, four targetedregions in the outer galaxy were observed: ic1396, a region towards the perseusarm, w3/4/5, and gem ob1. the bgps has detected approximately 8400 clumps overthe entire area to a limiting non-uniform 1-sigma noise level in the range 11to 53 mjy/beam in the inner galaxy. the bgps source catalog is presented in acompanion paper (rosolowsky et al. 2010). this paper details the surveyobservations and data reduction methods for the images. we discuss in detailthe determination of astrometric and flux density calibration uncertainties andcompare our results to the literature. data processing algorithms that separateastronomical signals from time-variable atmospheric fluctuations in the datatime-stream are presented. these algorithms reproduce the structure of theastronomical sky over a limited range of angular scales and produce artifactsin the vicinity of bright sources. based on simulations, we find that extendedemission on scales larger than about 5.9' is nearly completely attenuated (&gt;90%) and the linear scale at which the attenuation reaches 50% is 3.8'.comparison with other millimeter-wave data sets implies a possible systematicoffset in flux calibration, for which no cause has been discovered. thispresentation serves as a companion and guide to the public data release throughnasa's infrared processing and analysis center (ipac) infrared science archive(irsa). new data releases will be provided through ipac irsa with any futureimprovements in the reduction.

1011.0932	the bolocam galactic plane survey iv: 1.1 and 0.35 mm dust continuum  emission in the galactic center region	the bolocam galactic plane survey (bgps) data for a six square degree regionof the galactic plane containing the galactic center is analyzed and comparedto infrared and radio continuum data. the bgps 1.1 mm emission consists ofclumps interconnected by a network of fainter filaments surrounding cavities, afew of which are filled with diffuse near-ir emission indicating the presenceof warm dust or with radio continuum characteristic of hii regions or supernovaremnants. new 350 {\mu}m images of the environments of the two brightestregions, sgr a and b, are presented. sgr b2 is the brightest mm-emitting clumpin the central molecular zone and may be forming the closest analog to a superstar cluster in the galaxy. the central molecular zone (cmz) contains thehighest concentration of mm and sub-mm emitting dense clumps in the galaxy.most 1.1 mm features at positive longitudes are seen in silhouette against the3.6 to 24 {\mu}m background observed by the spitzer space telescope. however,only a few clumps at negative longitudes are seen in absorption, confirming thehypothesis that positive longitude clumps in the cmz tend to be on thenear-side of the galactic center, consistent with the suspected orientation ofthe central bar in our galaxy. some 1.1 mm cloud surfaces are seen in emissionat 8 {\mu}m, presumably due to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs). a~0.2\degree (~30 pc) diameter cavity and infrared bubble between l \approx0.0\degree and 0.2\degree surrounds the arches and quintuplet clusters and sgra. the bubble contains several clumpy dust filaments that point toward sgra\ast; its potential role in their formation is explored.

1011.5512	explosive outflows powered by the decay of non-hierarchical multiple  systems of massive stars: orion bn/kl	the explosive bn/kl outflow emerging from omc1 behind the orion nebula mayhave been powered by the dynamical decay of a non-hierarchical multiple system$\sim$500 years ago that ejected the massive stars i, bn, and source n, withvelocities of about 10 to 30 km s$^{-1}$. new proper motion measurements ofh$_2$ features show that within the errors of measurement, the outfloworiginated from the site of stellar ejection. combined with published data,these measurements indicate an outflow age of $\sim$500 years, similar to thetime since stellar ejection. the total kinetic energy of the ejected stars andthe outflow is about 2 to $6 \times 10^{47}$ ergs. it is proposed that thegravitational potential energy released by the formation of a short-periodbinary, most likely source i, resulted in stellar ejection and powered theoutflow. a scenario is presented for the formation of a compact,non-hierarchical multiple star system, its decay into an ejected binary and twohigh-velocity stars, and launch of the outflow. three mechanisms may havecontributed to the explosion in the gas: (i) unbinding of the circum-clusterenvelope following stellar ejection, (ii) disruption of circumstellar disks andhigh-speed expulsion of the resulting debris during the final stellarencounter, and (iii) the release of stored magnetic energy. plausibleproto-stellar disk end envelope properties can produce the observed outflowmass, velocity, and kinetic energy distributions. the ejected stars may haveacquired new disks by fall-back or bondi-hoyle accretion with axes roughlyorthogonal to their velocities. the expulsion of gas and stars from omc1 mayhave been driven by stellar interactions.

1112.3113	accretion of jupiter's atmosphere from a supernova-contaminated  molecular cloud	if jupiter and the sun both formed directly from the same well-mixedproto-solar nebula, then their atmospheric compositions should be similar.however, direct sampling of jupiter's troposphere indicates that it is enrichedin elements such as c, n, s, ar, kr, and xe by 2-6 times relative to the sun.most existing models to explain this enrichment require an extremely coldproto-solar nebula which allows these heavy elements to condense, and cannoteasily explain the observed variations between these species. we find thatjupiter's atmospheric composition may be explained if the solar system's diskheterogeneously accretes small amounts of enriched material such as supernovaejecta from the interstellar medium during jupiter's formation. our results aresimilar to, but substantially larger than, isotopic anomalies in terrestrialmaterial that indicate the solar system formed from multiple distinctreservoirs of material simultaneously with one or more nearby supernovae. suchtemporal and spatial heterogeneities could have been common at the time of thesolar system's formation, rather than the cloud having a purely well-mixed`solar nebula' composition.

1303.6286	what controls star formation in the central 500 pc of the galaxy?	the star formation rate (sfr) in the central molecular zone (cmz, i.e. thecentral 500 pc) of the milky way is lower by a factor of &gt;10 than expected forthe substantial amount of dense gas it contains, which challenges current starformation theories. in this paper, we quantify which physical mechanisms couldbe responsible. on scales larger than the disc scale height, the low sfr isfound to be consistent with episodic star formation due to secularinstabilities or possibly variations of the gas inflow along the galactic bar.the cmz is marginally toomre-stable when including gas and stars, but highlytoomre-stable when only accounting for the gas, indicating a low condensationrate of self-gravitating clouds. on small scales, we find that the sfr in thecmz may be caused by an elevated critical density for star formation due to thehigh turbulent pressure. the existence of a universal density threshold forstar formation is ruled out. the hi-h$_2$ phase transition of hydrogen, thetidal field, a possible underproduction of massive stars due to a bottom-heavyinitial mass function, magnetic fields, and cosmic ray or radiation pressurefeedback also cannot individually explain the low sfr. we propose aself-consistent cycle of star formation in the cmz, in which the effects ofseveral different processes combine to inhibit star formation. therate-limiting factor is the slow evolution of the gas towards collapse - oncestar formation is initiated it proceeds at a normal rate. the ubiquity of starformation inhibitors suggests that a lowered central sfr should be a commonphenomenon in other galaxies. we discuss the implications for galactic-scalestar formation and supermassive black hole growth, and relate our results tothe star formation conditions in other extreme environments.

1304.4597	the bolocam galactic plane survey. viii. a mid-infrared kinematic  distance discrimination method	we present a new distance estimation method for dust-continuum-identifiedmolecular cloud clumps. recent (sub-)millimeter galactic plane surveys havecataloged tens of thousands of these objects, but detailed study of theirphysical properties requires robust distance determinations. we derive bayesiandistance probability density functions (dpdfs) for 770 objects from the bolocamgalactic plane survey in the longitude range 7.5 &lt; l &lt; 65. the dpdf formalismis based on kinematic distances, and uses external data sets to place priordistance probabilities to resolve the kinematic distance ambiguity (kda) forobjects in the inner galaxy. we present priors related to the mid-infraredabsorption of dust in dense molecular regions and the galactic distribution ofmolecular gas. by assuming a numerical model of galactic mid-infrared emissionand simple radiative transfer, we match the morphology of millimeter thermaldust emission with mid-infrared absorption to compute a prior dpdf for distancediscrimination. selecting objects first from (sub-)millimeter source catalogsavoids a bias towards the darkest infrared dark clouds (irdcs) and extends therange of heliocentric distance and contrast range probed by mid-infraredextinction. we derive well-constrained kda resolutions for 618 molecular cloudclumps, with approximately 15% placed at or beyond the tangent distance.objects sufficiently dark to be cataloged as irdcs are generally placed at thenear kinematic distance. distance comparisons with galactic ring survey kdaresolutions yield a 92% agreement, and a galactic face-on view reveals sectionsof the sagittarius and scutum-centaurus arms. this kda-resolution method forlarge catalogs of sources through the combination of (sub-)millimeter andmid-infrared observations of molecular cloud clumps is generally applicable toother dust-continuum galactic plane surveys.

1309.0419	early stage massive star formation near the galactic center: sgr c	we present near-infrared spectroscopy and 1 mm line and continuumobservations of a recently identified site of high mass star formation likelyto be located in the central molecular zone near sgr c. located on theoutskirts of the massive evolved hii region associated with sgr c, the area ischaracterized by an extended green object measuring ~10" in size (0.4 pc),whose observational characteristics suggest the presence of an embedded massiveprotostar driving an outflow. our data confirm that early-stage star formationis taking place on the periphery of the sgr c hii region, with detections oftwo protostellar cores and several knots of h2 and brackett gamma emissionalongside a previously detected compact radio source. we calculate the cores'joint mass to be ~10^3 msun, with column densities of 1-2 x 10^24 cm-2. we showthe host molecular cloud to hold ~10^5 msun of gas and dust with temperaturesand column densities favourable for massive star formation to occur, however,there is no evidence of star formation outside of the ego, indicating that thecloud is predominantly quiescent. given its mass, density, and temperature, thecloud is comparable to other remarkable non-star-forming clouds such as g0.253in the eastern cmz.

1311.1112	the curious morphology and orientation of orion proplyd hst-10	hst-10 is one of the largest proplyds in the orion nebula and is locatedapproximately 1' se of the trapezium. unlike other proplyds in orion, however,the long-axis of hst-10 does not align with theta 1 c ori, but is insteadaligned with the rotational axis of the hst-10 disk. this cannot be easilyexplained using current photo-evaporation models. in this letter, we presenthigh spatial resolution near-infrared images of the orion proplyd hst-10 usingkeck/nirc2 with the laser guide star adaptive optics system, along withmulti-epoch analysis of hh objects near hst-10 using hubble space telescopewfpc2 and acs cameras. our narrow-band near-ir images resolve the proplydionization front (if) and circumstellar disk down to 23 au at the distance toorion in br gamma, he i, h_2, and pah emission. br gamma and he i emissionprimarily trace the if (with the disk showing prominently in silhouette), whilethe h_2 and pah emission trace the surface of the disk itself. pah emissionalso traces small dust grains within the proplyd envelope which is asymmetricand does not coincide with the if. the curious morphology of the pah emissionmay be due to uv-heating by both theta 1c ori and theta 2a ori. multi-epoch hstimages of the hst-10 field show proper motion of 3 knots associated with hh517, clearly indicating that hst-10 has a jet. we postulate that theorientation of hst-10 is determined by the combined ram-pressure of this jetand the fuv-powered photo-ablation flow from the disk surface.

1401.4175	the formation and early evolution of young massive clusters	we review the formation and early evolution of the most massive and denseyoung stellar clusters, focusing on the role they can play in our understandingof star and planet formation as a whole. young massive cluster (ymc) progenitorclouds in the galactic center can accumulate to a high enough density withoutforming stars that the initial protostellar densities are close to the finalstellar density. for this to hold in the disk, the time scale to accumulate thegas to such high densities must be much shorter than the star formationtimescale. otherwise the gas begins forming stars while it is being accumulatedto high density. the distinction between the formation regimes in the twoenvironments is consistent with the predictions of environmentally-dependentdensity thresholds for star formation. this implies that stars in ymcs ofsimilar total mass and radius can have formed at widely different initialprotostellar densities. the fact that no systematic variations in fundamentalproperties are observed between ymcs in the disk and galactic center suggestsstellar mass assembly is not strongly affected by the initial protostellardensity. we review recent theoretical advances and summarize the debate onthree key open questions: the initial (proto)stellar distribution, infant(im)mortality and age spreads within ymcs. we conclude: the initialprotostellar distribution is likely hierarchical; ymcs likely experienced aformation history that was dominated by gas exhaustion rather than gasexpulsion; ymcs are dynamically stable from a young age; and ymcs have agespreads much smaller than their mean age. finally, we show that it is plausiblethat metal-rich globular clusters may have formed in a similar way to ymcs innearby galaxies. in summary, the study of ymc formation bridges star/planetformation in the solar neighborhood to the oldest structures in the localuniverse.

1402.6196	the milky way as a star formation engine	the cycling of material from the interstellar medium (ism) into stars and thereturn of stellar ejecta into the ism is the engine that drives the "galacticecology" in normal spirals, a cornerstone in the formation and evolution ofgalaxies through cosmic time. major observational and theoretical challengesneed to be addressed in determining the processes responsible for convertingthe low-density ism into dense molecular clouds, forming dense filaments andclumps, fragmenting them into stars, ob associations and bound clusters, andcharacterizing the feedback that limits the rate and efficiency of starformation. this formidable task can be now effectively attacked thanks to thecombination of new global-scale surveys of the milky way galactic plane frominfrared to radio wavelengths, offering the possibility of bridging the gapbetween local and extragalactic star formation studies. the herschel, spitzerand wise mid to far infrared continuum surveys, complemented by analoguesurveys from ground-based facilities in the millimetre and radio wavelengths,enables us to measure the galactic distribution and physical properties of duston all scales and in all components of the ism from diffuse clouds tofilamentary complexes and tens of thousands of dense clumps. a complementarysuite of spectroscopic surveys in various atomic and molecular tracers isproviding the chemical fingerprinting of dense clumps and filaments, as well asessential kinematic information to derive distances and thus transformpanoramic data into a 3d representation. the latest results emerging from thesegalaxy-scale surveys are reviewed. new insights into cloud formation andevolution, filaments and their relationship to channeling gas ontogravitationally-bound clumps, the properties of these clumps, densitythresholds for gravitational collapse, and star and cluster formation rates arediscussed.

1403.2026	alma observations of the orion proplyds	we present alma observations of protoplanetary disks ("proplyds") in theorion nebula cluster. we imaged 5 individual fields at 856um containing 22hst-identified proplyds and detected 21 of them. eight of those disks weredetected for the first time at submillimeter wavelengths, including the mostprominent, well-known proplyd in the entire orion nebula, 114-426. thermal dustemission in excess of any free-free component was measured in all but one ofthe detected disks, and ranged between 1-163 mjy, with resulting disk masses of0.3-79 mjup. an additional 26 stars with no prior evidence of associated disksin hst observations were also imaged within the 5 fields, but only 2 weredetected. the disk mass upper limits for the undetected targets, which includeob stars, theta1ori c and theta1ori f, range from 0.1-0.6 mjup. combining thesealma data with previous sma observations, we find a lack of massive (&gt;3 mjup)disks in the extreme-uv dominated region of orion, within 0.03 pc of o-startheta1ori c. at larger separations from theta1ori c, in the far-uv dominatedregion, there is a wide range of disk masses, similar to what is found inlow-mass star forming regions. taken together, these results suggest that arapid dissipation of disk masses likely inhibits potential planet formation inthe extreme-uv dominated regions of ob associations, but leaves disks in thefar-uv dominated regions relatively unaffected.

1405.3308	the comparison of physical properties derived from gas and dust in a  massive star-forming region	we explore the relationship between gas and dust in massive star-formingregions by comparing physical properties derived from each. we compare thetemperatures and column densities in a massive star-forming infrared dark cloud(irdc, g32.02+0.05), which shows a range of evolutionary states, from quiescentto active. the gas properties were derived using radiative transfer modeling ofthe (1,1), (2,2), and (4,4) transitions of nh3 on the karl g. jansky very largearray (vla), while the dust temperatures and column densities were calculatedusing cirrus-subtracted, modified blackbody fits to herschel data. we comparethe derived column densities to calculate an nh3 abundance, 4.6 x 10^-8. in thecoldest star-forming region, we find that the measured dust temperatures arelower than the measured gas temperatures (mean and standard deviations t_dust ~11.6 +/- 0.2 k vs. t_gas ~ 15.2 +/- 1.5 k), which may indicate that the gas anddust are not well-coupled in the youngest regions (~0.5 myr) or that theseobservations probe a regime where the dust and/or gas temperature measurementsare unreliable. finally, we calculate millimeter fluxes based on thetemperatures and column densities derived from nh3 which suggest thatmillimeter dust continuum observations of massive star-forming regions, such asthe bolocam galactic plane survey or atlasgal, can probe hot cores, cold cores,and the dense gas lanes from which they form, and are generally not dominatedby the hottest core.

0804.0438	`tail-end' bondi-hoyle accretion in young star clusters: implications  for disks, planets, and stars	young stars orbiting in the gravitational potential well of forming starclusters pass through the cluster's dense molecular gas and can experiencebondi-hoyle accretion from reservoirs outside their individual protostellarcloud cores. accretion can occur for several million years after the starsform, but before the cluster disperses. this accretion is predominantly ontothe disk and not the star. n-body simulations of stars orbiting in three youngmodel clusters containing 30, 300, and 3000 stars are presented. thesimulations include the gravitational potential of the molecular gas whichsmoothly disperses over time. the clusters have a star formation efficiency of33% and a radius of 0.22 pc. we find that the disks surrounding solar-massstars in the n=30 cluster accretes ~0.01 m_sol (~1 minimum-mass solar nebula,mmsn) per myr. the accretion rate scales as m^2.1 for stars of mass m. theaccretion rate is ~5 times lower for n=3000 cluster, due to its higher stellarvelocities and higher temperature. the bondi-hoyle accretion rates onto thedisks are several times lower than accretion rates observed directly onto youngstars (e.g., muzerolle et al 2005): these two accretion rates follow the samem^2 behavior and may be related. the accreted disk mass is large enough that itmay have a substantial and unappreciated effect on disk structure and theformation of planetary systems. we discuss a variety of implications of thisprocess, including its effect on metallicity differences between cluster stars,compositional differences between a star and its disk, the formation ofterrestrial and gas-giant planets, and isotopic anomalies observed in our solarsystem.

(1) the dense gas fraction inthe w51 a and b clouds shows that w51 a will continue to form stars vigorously,while star formation has mostly ended in w51 b. the lack of dense, star-forminggas around w51 c indicates that collect-and-collapse is not acting or isinefficient in w51. (2) ongoing high-mass star formation is correlated with n ~1x10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$ gas. gas with n &gt; 10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$ is weakly correlated withlow and moderate mass star formation, but does not strongly correlate withhigh-mass star formation. (3) the nondetection of h$_2$co emission implies thatthe emission detected in other galaxies, e.g. arp 220, comes from high-densitygas that is not directly affiliated with already-formed massive stars. eitherthe non-star-forming ism of these galaxies is very dense, implying the starformation density threshold is higher, or h ii regions have their emissionsuppressed.

1504.00669	hh 666: different kinematics from h{\alpha} and [fe ii] emission provide  a missing link between jets and outflows	hh 666 is an externally irradiated protostellar outflow in the carina nebulafor which we present new near-ir [fe ii] spectra obtained with the firespectrograph at magellan observatory. earlier h{\alpha} and near-ir [fe ii]imaging revealed that the two emission lines trace substantially differentmorphologies in the inner ~40" of the outflow. h{\alpha} traces a broad cocoonthat surrounds the collimated [fe ii] jet that extends throughout the parentdust pillar. new spectra show that this discrepancy extends to theirkinematics. near-ir [fe ii] emission traces steady, fast velocities of +/- 200km/s from the eastern and western limbs of the jet. we compare this to apreviously published h{\alpha} spectrum that reveals a hubble-flow velocitystructure near the jet-driving source. new, second-epoch hst/acs h{\alpha}images reveal the lateral spreading of the h{\alpha} outflow lobe away from thejet axis. h{\alpha} proper motions also indicate a sudden increase in themass-loss rate ~1000 yr ago, while steady [fe ii] emission throughout the innerjet suggests that the burst is ongoing. an accretion burst sustained for ~1000yr is an order of magnitude longer than expected for fu orionis outbursts, butrepresents only a small fraction of the total age of the hh 666 outflow.altogether, available data suggests that [fe ii] traces the highly collimatedprotostellar jet while h{\alpha} traces the entrained and irradiated outflow.hh 666 appears to be a missing link between bare jets seen in h ii regions andentrained molecular outflows seen from embedded protostars in more quiescentregions.

1504.01388	the bolocam galactic plane survey. xiii. physical properties and mass  functions of dense molecular cloud structures	we use the distance probability density function (dpdf) formalism ofellsworth-bowers et al. (2013, 2015) to derive physical properties for thecollection of 1,710 bolocam galactic plane survey (bgps) version 2 sources withwell-constrained distance estimates. to account for malmquist bias, we estimatethat the present sample of bgps sources is 90% complete above 400 $m_\odot$ and50% complete above 70 $m_\odot$. the mass distributions for the entire sampleand astrophysically motivated subsets are generally fitted well by a lognormalfunction, with approximately power-law distributions at high mass. power-lawbehavior emerges more clearly when the sample population is narrowed inheliocentric distance (power-law index $\alpha = 2.0\pm0.1$ for sources nearerthan 6.5 kpc and $\alpha = 1.9\pm0.1$ for objects between 2 kpc and 10 kpc).the high-mass power-law indices are generally $1.85 \leq \alpha \leq 2.05$ forvarious subsamples of sources, intermediate between that of giant molecularclouds and the stellar initial mass function. the fit to the entire sampleyields a high-mass power-law $\hat{\alpha} = 1.94_{-0.10}^{+0.34}$. physicalproperties of bgps sources are consistent with large molecular cloud clumps orsmall molecular clouds, but the fractal nature of the dense interstellar mediummakes difficult the mapping of observational categories to the dominantphysical processes driving the observed structure. the face-on map of thegalactic disk's mass surface density based on bgps dense molecular cloudstructures reveals the high-mass star-forming regions w43, w49, and w51 asprominent mass concentrations in the first quadrant. furthermore, we present a0.25-kpc resolution map of the dense gas mass fraction across the galactic diskthat peaks around 5%.

1506.03391	alma observations of the largest proto-planetary disk in the orion  nebula, 114-426: a co silhouette	we present alma observations of the largest protoplanetary disk in the orionnebula, 114-426. detectable 345 ghz (856 micron) dust continuum is producedonly in the 350 au central region of the ~1000 au diameter silhouette seenagainst the bright h-alpha background in hst images. assuming optically thindust emission at 345 ghz, a gas-to-dust ratio of 100, and a grain temperatureof 20 k, the disk gas-mass is estimated to be 3.1 +/- 0.6 jupiter masses. ifmost solids and ices have have been incorporated into large grains, however,this value is a lower limit. the disk is not detected in dense-gas tracers suchas hco+ j=4-3, hcn j=4-3, or cs =7-6. these results may indicate that the114-426 disk is evolved and depleted in some light organic compounds found inmolecular clouds. the co j=3-2 line is seen in absorption against the bright 50to 80 k background of the orion a molecular cloud over the full spatial extentand a little beyond the dust continuum emission. the co absorption reaches adepth of 27 k below the background co emission at vlsr ~6.7 km/s about 0.52arcseconds (210 au) northeast and 12 k below the background co emission at vlsr~ 9.7 km/s about 0.34 arcseconds (140 au) southwest of the suspected locationof the central star, implying that the embedded star has a mass less than 1solar mass .

1509.01583	dense gas in the galactic central molecular zone is warm and heated by  turbulence	the galactic center is the closest region in which we can study starformation under extreme physical conditions like those in high-redshiftgalaxies. we measure the temperature of the dense gas in the central molecularzone (cmz) and examine what drives it. we mapped the inner 300 pc of the cmz inthe temperature-sensitive j = 3-2 para-formaldehyde (p-h$_2$co) transitions. weused the $3_{2,1} - 2_{2,0} / 3_{0,3} - 2_{0,2}$ line ratio to determine thegas temperature in $n \sim 10^4 - 10^5 $cm$^{-3}$ gas. we have producedtemperature maps and cubes with 30" and 1 km/s resolution and published alldata in fits form. dense gas temperatures in the galactic center range from ~60k to &gt; 100 k in selected regions. the highest gas temperatures t_g &gt; 100 k areobserved around the sgr b2 cores, in the extended sgr b2 cloud, the 20 km/s and50 km/s clouds, and in "the brick" (g0.253+0.016). we infer an upper limit onthe cosmic ray ionization rate ${\zeta}_{cr} &lt; 10^{-14}$ 1/s. the densemolecular gas temperature of the region around our galactic center is similarto values found in the central regions of other galaxies, in particularstarburst systems. the gas temperature is uniformly higher than the dusttemperature, confirming that dust is a coolant in the dense gas. turbulentheating can readily explain the observed temperatures given the observed linewidths. cosmic rays cannot explain the observed variation in gas temperatures,so cmz dense gas temperatures are not dominated by cosmic ray heating. the gastemperatures previously observed to be high in the inner ~75 pc are confirmedto be high in the entire cmz.

1510.08070	an excess of mid-infrared emission from the type iax sn 2014dt	supernovae type iax (sne iax) are less energetic and less luminous thantypical thermonuclear explosions. a suggested explanation for the observedcharacteristics of this subclass is a binary progenitor system consisting of aco white dwarf primary accreting from a helium star companion. asingle-degenerate explosion channel might be expected to result in a densecircumstellar medium (csm), although no evidence for such a csm has yet beenobserved for this subclass. here we present recent spitzer observations of thesn iax 2014dt obtained by the spirits program nearly one year post-explosionthat reveal a strong mid-ir excess over the expected fluxes of more normal sneia. this excess is consistent with 1e-5 m_solar of newly formed dust, whichwould be the first time that newly formed dust has been observed to form in anormal type ia. the excess, however, is also consistent with a dusty csm thatwas likely formed in pre-explosion mass-loss, thereby suggesting a singledegenerate progenitor system. compared to other sne ia that show significantshock interaction (sne ia-csm) and interacting core-collapse events (sne iin),this dust shell in sn 2014dt is less massive. we consider the implications thatsuch a pre-existing dust shell has for the progenitor system, including abinary system with a mass donor that is a red giant, a red supergiant, and anasymptotic giant branch star.

1511.06300	large-scale latitude distortions of the inner milky way disk from the  herschel/hi-gal survey	we use the herschel hi-gal survey data to study the spatial distribution ingalactic longitude and latitude of the interstellar medium and of dense,star-forming clumps in the inner galaxy. the peak position and width of thelatitude distribution of the dust column density as well as of number densityof compact sources from the band-merged hi-gal photometric catalogues areanalysed as a function of longitude. the width of the diffuse dust columndensity traced by the hi-gal 500 micron emission varies across the innergalaxy, with a mean value of 1{\deg}.2-1{\deg}.3, similar to that of the 250umhi-gal sources. 70um hi-gal sources define a much thinner disk, with a meanfwhm of 0{\deg}.75, and an average latitude of b=0{\deg}.06, coincident withthe results from atlasgal. the glat distribution as a function of glon showsmodulations, both for the diffuse emission and for the compact sources, with~0{\deg}.2 displacements mostly toward negative latitudes at l~ +40{\deg},+12{\deg}, -25{\deg} and -40{\deg}. no such modulations can be found in themipsgal 24 or wise 22 um data when the entire source samples are considered.the distortions revealed by herschel are interpreted as large-scale bendingmodes of the plane. the lack of similar distortions in tracers of more evolvedysos or stars rules out gravitational instabilities or satellite-inducedperturbations, as they should act on both the diffuse and stellar diskcomponents. we propose that the observed bends are caused by incoming flows ofextra-planar gas interacting with the gaseous disk. stars decouple from thegaseous ism and relax into the stellar disk potential. the time required forthe disappearance of the distortions from the diffuse ism to the relativelyevolved yso stages are compatible with star-formation timescales.

1511.08810	the bolocam galactic plane survey. xiv. physical properties of massive  starless and star forming clumps	we sort $4683$ molecular clouds between $10^\circ&lt; \ell &lt;65^\circ$ from thebolocam galactic plane survey based on observational diagnostics of starformation activity: compact $70$ $\mu{\rm m}$ sources, mid-ir color-selectedysos, ${\rm h_2o}$ and ${\rm ch_3oh}$ masers, and uchii regions. we alsopresent a combined ${\rm nh_3}$-derived gas kinetic temperature and ${\rmh_2o}$ maser catalog for $1788$ clumps from our own gbt 100m observations andfrom the literature. we identify a subsample of $2223$ ($47.5\%$) starlessclump candidates, the largest and most robust sample identified from a blindsurvey to date. distributions of flux density, flux concentration, solid angle,kinetic temperature, column density, radius, and mass show strong ($&gt;1$ dex)progressions when sorted by star formation indicator. the median starless clumpcandidate is marginally sub-virial ($\alpha \sim 0.7$) with $&gt;75\%$ of clumpswith known distance being gravitationally bound ($\alpha &lt; 2$). these samplesshow a statistically significant increase in the median clump mass of $\delta m\sim 170-370$ m$_\odot$ from the starless candidates to clumps associated withprotostars. this trend could be due to (i) mass growth of the clumps at$\dot{m}\sim200-440$ msun myr$^{-1}$ for an average free-fall $0.8$ myrtime-scale, (ii) a systematic factor of two increase in dust opacity fromstarless to protostellar phases, (iii) and/or a variation in the ratio ofstarless to protostellar clump lifetime that scales as $\sim m^{-0.4}$. bycomparing to the observed number of ${\rm ch_3oh}$ maser containing clumps weestimate the phase-lifetime of massive ($m&gt;10^3$ m$_\odot$) starless clumps tobe $0.37 \pm 0.08 \ {\rm myr} \ (m/10^3 \ {\rm m}_\odot)^{-1}$; the majority($m&lt;450$ m$_\odot$) have phase-lifetimes longer than their average free-falltime.

0705.3054	and in the darkness bind them: equatorial rings, b[e] supergiants, and  the waists of bipolar nebulae	we report the discovery of two new circumstellar ring nebulae in the westerncarina nebula. the brighter object, sbw1, resembles a lidless staring eye andencircles a b1.5 iab supergiant. its size is identical to the inner ring aroundsn1987a, but sbw1's low n abundance indicates that the star didn't pass througha rsg phase. the fainter object, sbw2, is a more distorted ring, is n-rich, andhas a central star that seems to be invisible. we discuss these two new nebulaein context with rings around sn1987a, sher25, hd168625, ry scuti, webo1, suwt2,and others. the ring bearers fall into two groups: five rings surround hotsupergiants, and all except for the one known binary are carbon copies of thering around sn1987a. we propose a link between these rings and b[e]supergiants, where the rings derive from the same material in an earlier b[e]phase. the remaining four rings surround evolved intermediate-mass stars; allmembers of this ring fellowship are close binaries, hinting that binaryinteractions govern the forging of such rings. we estimate that there may beseveral thousand more dark rings in the galaxy, but we are scarcely aware oftheir existence due to selection effects. the lower-mass objects might be theequatorial density enhancements often invoked to bind the waists of bipolarpne.

astro-ph;0009376	irradiated herbig-haro jets in the orion nebula and near ngc 1333	we report the discovery of a dozen herbig-haro jets illuminated by the lymancontinuum and/or softer far-ultraviolet radiation fields of nearby high massstars. five irradiated outflows lie in the outer parts of the orion nebula andseven lie near the reflection nebula ngc 1333 in the perseus molecular cloud.we propose that the uv radiation field has eroded residual material left overfrom the formation of these young source stars. many of the irradiated jetsexhibit unusual c-shaped bending. in the outskirts of the orion nebula, mostirradiated jets bend away from the core of the nebula. on the other hand, inngc 1333, the c-shaped jets bend back towards the cluster center. jet bendingin the orion nebula may be dominated by either the outflow of material from thenebular core or by the rocket effect pushing on the irradiated portion of amostly neutral jet beam. but in ngc 1333, jet bending may indicate that thesource stars have been ejected from the cluster core. many irradiated jets areasymmetric with one beam much brighter than the other. when fullyphoto-ionized, irradiated jets may provide unique insights into the physicalconditions within outflows powered by young stars, permitting the determinationof the density and location of stellar ejecta even in the absence of shocks. wepresent a model for the photo-ionization of these outflows by externalradiation fields and discuss possible mechanisms for producing the observedasymmetries. we demonstrate that the uv radiation field may alter the amount ofcloud material entrained by the jet. we also report the discovery of some largescale bow shocks which face the core of the orion nebula and which surroundvisible young stars. these wind-wind collision fronts provide further evidencefor a large scale mass flow originating near the nebular core.

astro-ph;0103401	discovery of x rays from class 0 protostar candidates in omc-3	we have observed the orion molecular clouds 2 and 3 (omc-2 and omc-3) withthe chandra x-ray observatory (cxo). the northern part of omc-3 is found to beparticularly rich in new x-ray features; four hard x-ray sources are located inand along the filament of cloud cores. two sources coincide positionally withthe sub$mm$-$mm$ dust condensations of mms 2 and 3 or an outflow radio sourcevla 1, which are in a very early phase of star formation. the x-ray spectra ofthese sources show an absorption column of (1-3) x 10^23 h cm-2. assuming amoderate temperature plasma, the x-ray luminosity in the 0.5-10 kev band isestimated to be ~10^30 erg s^-1 at a distance of 450 pc. from the largeabsorption, positional coincidence and moderate luminosity, we infer that thehard x-rays are coming from very young stellar objects embedded in themolecular cloud cores. we found another hard x-ray source near the edge of thedust filament. the extremely high absorption of 3 x 10^23 h cm^-2 indicatesthat the source must be surrounded by dense gas, suggesting that it is either ayso in an early accretion phase or a type ii agn (e.g. a seyfert 2), althoughno counterpart is found at any other wavelength. in contrast to the hard x-raysources, soft x-ray sources are found spread around the dust filaments, most ofwhich are identified with ir sources in the t tauri phase.

astro-ph;0411178	opening the treasure chest: a newborn star cluster emerges from its dust  pillar in carina	we present detailed observations of the treasure chest, a compact nebula atthe head of a dust pillar in the southern carina nebula. this object is ofinterest because it is an example of a dense young cluster containing at leastone massive star, the formation of which may have been triggered by feedbackfrom the very massive stars in the carina nebula, and possibly eta car itself.we investigate both the nebular and stellar content of the object. near-iremission-line images reveal a cavity inside the head of the dust pillar, whichcontains a dense cluster of young stars, while the observed spectrum of thenebula is consistent with an h ii region ionized by an o9.5 v star. aftersubtracting contamination of field stars within the carina nebula itself, wecompare the cluster's color magnitude diagram with pre-main-sequence isochronesto derive a likely cluster age less than about 0.1 myr. this is in reasonableagreement with the dynamical age of a few times 10^4 yr for the expandingnebular cavity, indicating extreme youth. stars in the treasure chest clusterare highly reddened, with extinction values as large as a_v=50. two-thirds ofcluster members show strong infrared excess colors indicative of circumstellardisks, which may prove to be among the highest fraction yet seen for a youngcluster. all evidence suggests that the treaure chest is an extremely youngcluster that is just now breaking out of its natal cloud into the surroundingmassive star forming region, and is a good target for more detailed study.

astro-ph;0502485	the birth of high mass stars: accretion and/or mergers?	the observational consequences of the merger scenario for massive starformation are explored and contrasted with the gradual accumulation of mass byaccretion. protostellar mergers may produce high luminosity infrared flareslasting years to centuries followed by a luminosity decline on thekelvin-helmholtz time-scale of the merger product. mergers may be surrounded bythick tori of expanding debris, impulsive wide-angle outflows, and shockinduced maser and radio continuum emission. collision products are expected tohave fast stellar rotation and a large multiplicity fraction. close encountersor mergers will produce circumstellar debris disks with an orientation thatdiffers form that of a pre-existing disk. the extremely rare merger of twostars close to the upper-mass end of the imf may be a possible pathway tohypernova generated gamma-ray bursters. while accretional growth can lead tothe formation of massive stars in isolation or in loose clusters, mergers canonly occur in high-density cluster environments. it is proposed that theoutflow emerging from the omc1 core in the orion molecular cloud was producedby a protostellar merger that released between $10^{48}$ to $10^{49}$ ergs lessthan a thousand years ago.

astro-ph;0506445	thermal dust emission from proplyds, unresolved disks, and shocks in the  orion nebula	we present a new 11.7 micron mosaic image of the orion nebula obtained witht-recs on gemini south. the map includes the bn/kl region, the trapezium, andomc-1 south. excluding bn/kl, we detect 91 point sources, with 27 knownproplyds and over 30 ``naked'' stars showing no extended structure in hstimages. within the region we surveyed, 80 percent of known proplyds showdetectable emission, almost 40 percent of naked stars are detected at 11.7micron, and the fraction of all visible sources with ir excess emission isroughly 50 percent. thermal dust emission from stars with no extended structurein hst images means that they have dust disks comparable to the size of oursolar system. proplyds and stars with ir excess show a clear anti-correlationin their spatial distribution, with proplyds clustered close to theta1c, andother infrared sources found farther away. we suspect that the clusteredproplyds trace the youngest 0.5 myr age group associated with the trapezium,while the more uniformly-distributed sources trace the older 1-2 myr populationof the onc. this suggests that small disks persist for a few myr in irradiatedenvironments, and hints that hierarchical sub-clustering has been important.within 30 arcsec of theta1c, all proplyds are detected at 11.7 micron. the startheta1d is associated with the most prominent mid-ir dust arc in the nebula. wepropose that this arc is the consequence of theta1d being the closest member ofthe trapezium to the background cloud. finally, we detect dust emission from hhjets in orion, including hh202, hh529, hh513, and hh514. this is the firstdetection of mid-ir continuum emission from dust in the body of a collimated hhjet or bow shock.

astro-ph;0506650	x-ray emission from orion nebula cluster stars with circumstellar disks  and jets	we investigate the x-ray and near-infrared emission properties of a sample ofpre-main sequence (pms) stellar systems in the orion nebula cluster (onc) thatdisplay evidence for circumstellar disks (``proplyds'') and optical jets inhubble space telescope (hst) imaging. approximately 70% of ~140 proplyds weredetected as x-ray sources in the chandra orion ultradeep program observation ofthe onc, including ~25% of proplyds that do not display central stars in hstimaging. many proplyds display near-infrared excesses, suggesting diskaccretion is ongoing onto the central, pms stars. among circumstellar disksthat are detected in absorption in hst imaging, we find that x-ray absorbingcolumn and apparent disk inclination are well correlated, providing insightinto the disk scale heights and metal abundances of uv- and x-ray-irradiatedprotoplanetary disks. jet sources display some of the largest near-infraredexcesses among the x-ray-detected proplyds, suggesting that the origin of thejets is closely related to ongoing, pms stellar accretion. some jet sourcesdisplay double-peaked x-ray spectral energy distributions, with soft componentsindicative of strong shocks in the jet collimation region. these resultssupport models in which circumstellar disks collimate and/or launch jets fromyoung stellar objects and, furthermore, demonstrate that star-disk-jetinteractions may contribute to pms x-ray emission.

astro-ph;0507187	the [o iii] veil: astropause of eta carinae's wind?	we present narrowband images of eta carinae in the light of [o iii] 5007obtained with hst/wfpc2, as well as a ground-based image in the same emissionline with a larger field of view. these images show a thin veil of [o iii]emission around eta car and its ejecta, confirming the existence of anoxygen-bearing ``cocoon'' inferred from spectra. this [o iii] veil may be theremnant of the pre-outburst wind of eta car, and its outer edge probably marksthe interface where eta car's ejecta meet the stellar wind of the nearby o4v((f)) star hd303308 or other ambient material -- i.e., it marks the``astropause'' in eta car's wind. this veil is part of a more extensive [o iii]shell that appears to be shaped and ionized by hd303308. a pair of hst imageswith a 10 yr baseline shows no proper motion, limiting the expansion speed awayfrom eta car to 12pm13 km/s, or an expansion age of a few times 10^4 yr. thus,this is probably the decelerated pre-outburst lbv wind of eta car. the [o iii]morphology is very different from that seen in [n ii], which traces young knotsof cno-processed material; this represents a dramatic shift in the chemicalmakeup of material recently ejected by eta car. this change in the chemicalabundances may have resulted from the sudden removal of the star's outerenvelope during eta car's 19th century outburst or an earlier but similarevent.

astro-ph;0601508	x-rays from hh210 in the orion nebula	we report the detection during the chandra orion ultradeep project (coup) oftwo soft, constant, and faint x-ray sources associated with the herbig-haroobject hh210. hh210 is located at the tip of the nne finger of the emissionline system bursting out of the bn-kl complex, northwest of the trapeziumcluster in the omc-1 molecular cloud. using a recent halpha image obtained withthe acs imager on board hst, and taking into account the known proper motionsof hh210 emission knots, we show that the position of the brightest x-raysource, coup703, coincides with the emission knot 154-040a of hh210, which isthe emission knot of hh210 having the highest tangential velocity (425 km/s).the second x-ray source, coup704, is located on the complicated emission tailof hh210 close to an emission line filament and has no obvious optical/infraredcounterpart. spectral fitting indicates for both sources a plasma temperatureof ~0.8 mk and absorption-corrected x-ray luminosities of about 1e30 erg/s(0.5-2.0 kev). these x-ray sources are well explained by a model invoking afast-moving, radiative bow shock in a neutral medium with a density of ~12000cm^{-3}. the x-ray detection of coup704 therefore reveals, in the complicatedhh210 region, an energetic shock not yet identified at other wavelengths.

astro-ph;0603119	resolving the nature of the rosette hh1 jet facing strong uv dissipation	the rosette hh1 jet is a collimated flow immersed in the strong uv radiationfield of the rosette nebula. we investigate the physical properties of therosette hh1 jet using high-quality narrow-band images and high-dispersionspectroscopy. the new images show that the axis of the jet is not preciselyaligned with the star near the base of the jet. the high resolution of thespectra allows us to accurately determine the contributions from the \ion{h}{2}region, jet, and star. the appoaching and receding sides of the expanding shellof the rosette nebula are at heliocentric velocities of 13 and 40 km s$^{-1}$,while the jet reaches a maximum velocity offset at a heliocentric velocity of$-$30 km s$^{-1}$. the [\ion{s}{2}] doublet ratios indicate an electron densityof $\sim$1000 cm$^{-3}$ in the jet and $\le$100 cm$^{-3}$ in the \ion{h}{2}region. with a careful subtraction of the nebular and jet components, we findthe stellar h$\alpha$ line is dominated by a broad absorption profile withlittle or no emission component, indicating a lack of substantial circumstellarmaterial. the circumstellar material has most likely been photo-evaporated bythe strong uv radiation field in the rosette nebula. the evaporation time scaleis 10$^3$ -- 10$^4$ yr. the rosette hh1 jet source provides evidence for anaccelerated evolution from a ctts to a wtts due to the strong uv radiationfield; therefore, both cttss and wttss can be spatially mixed in regions withmassive star formation.

astro-ph;0605174	silicate emission profiles from low-mass protostellar disks in the orion  nebula: evidence for growth and thermal processing of grains	we present 8--13 micron low resolution spectra (r~100) of 8 low-massprotostellar objects ("proplyds") in the orion nebula using the long wavelengthspectrometer (lws) at the w. m. keck observatory. all but one of the sources inour sample show strong circumstellar silicate emission, with profiles that arequalitatively similar to those seen in some t tauri and herbig ae/be stars. thesilicate profile in all cases is significantly flattened compared to theprofile for typical interstellar dust, suggesting that the dominant emittinggrains are significantly larger than those found in the interstellar medium.the 11.3-to-9.8 micron flux ratio--often used as an indicator of graingrowth--is in the 0.8 to 1.0 range for all of our targets, indicating that thetypical grain size is around a few microns in the surface layers of theattendant circumstellar disk for each object. furthermore, the silicateprofiles show some evidence of crystalline features, as seen in other youngstellar objects. the results of our analysis show that the grains in thephotoevaporating protostellar disks of orion have undergone significant growthand perhaps some annealing, suggesting that grain evolution for these objectsis not qualitatively different from other young stellar objects.

astro-ph;0605543	cleaning up eta carinae: detection of ammonia in the homunculus	we report the first detection of ammonia in the homunculus nebula around etacarinae, which is also the first detection of emission from a polyatomicmolecule in this or any other luminous blue variable (lbv) nebula. observationsof the nh3 (j,k)=(3,3) inversion transition made with the australia telescopecompact array reveal emission at locations where infrared h2 emission had beendetected previously, near the strongest dust emission in the core of thehomunculus. we also detect ammonia emission from the so-called ``strontiumfilament'' in the equatorial disk. the presence of nh3 around eta car hintsthat molecular shells around some wolf-rayet stars could have originated inprior lbv eruptions, rather than in cool red supergiant winds or the ambientinterstellar medium. combined with the lack of any co detection, nh3 seems tosuggest that the homunculus is nitrogen rich like the ionized ejecta around etacar. it also indicates that the homunculus is a unique laboratory in which tostudy unusual molecule and dust chemistry, as well as their rapid formation ina nitrogen-rich environment around a hot star. we encourage future observationsof other transitions like nh3 (1,1) and (2,2), related molecules like n2h+, andrenewed attempts to detect co.

astro-ph;0610633	capture formed binaries via encounters with massive protostars	most massive stars are found in the center of dense clusters, and have acompanion fraction much higher than their lower mass siblings; the massivestars of the trapezium core in orion have ~ 1.5 companions each. this highmultiplicity could be a consequence of formation via a capture scenario, or itcould be due to fragmentation of the cores that form the massive stars. duringstellar formation circumstellar disks appear to be nearly ubiquitous. theirlarge radii compared to stellar sizes increase the interaction radiussignificantly, suggesting that disk interactions with neighboring stars couldassist in capturing binary companions. this mechanism has been studied forstars of approximately solar mass and found to be inefficient. in this paper wepresent simulations of interactions between a 22 msun star-disk system and lessmassive impactors, to study the disk-assisted capture formation of binaries ina regime suited to massive stars. the formation of binaries by capture is foundto be much more efficient for massive capturers. we discuss the effects of amass dependent velocity dispersion and mass segregation on the capture rates,and consider the long term survival of the resultant binaries in a densecluster.

astro-ph;9706177	a theoretical calibration of ^{13}co lte column density in molecular  clouds	in this work we use models of molecular clouds (mc), and non-lte radiativetransfer calculations, to obtain a theoretical calibration of the relationbetween lte 13co column density and true column density in mcs. the cloudmodels consist of 3 dimensional grids of density and velocity fields obtainedas solutions of the compressible magneto-hydrodynamic equations in a128x128x128 periodic grid in both the supersonic and super-alfvenic regimes.due to the random nature of the velocity field and the presence of shocks, thedensity spans a continuous range of values covering over 5-6 orders ofmagnitude (from ~0.1 to ~10^5 cm^-3). as a result, the lte column density canbe calibrated over 3 orders of magnitude. we find that lte column density ofmolecular clouds typically underestimates the mean 13co true column density bya factor ranging from 1.3 to 7. these results imply that the standard ltemethods for the derivation of column densities from co data systematicallyunderestimate the true values independent of other major sources of uncertaintysuch as the relative abundance of co.
