0902.0662	a kiloparsec-scale hyper-starburst in a quasar host less than 1 gigayear  after the big bang	the host galaxy of the quasar sdss j114816.64+525150.3 (at redshift z=6.42,when the universe was &lt;1 billion years old) has an infrared luminosity of2.2x10^13 l_sun, presumably significantly powered by a massive burst of starformation. in local examples of extremely luminous galaxies such as arp220, theburst of star formation is concentrated in the relatively small central regionof &lt;100pc radius. it is unknown on which scales stars are forming in activegalaxies in the early universe, which are likely undergoing their initial burstof star formation. we do know that at some early point structures comparable tothe spheroidal bulge of the milky way must have formed. here we report aspatially resolved image of [cii] emission of the host galaxy ofj114816.64+525150.3 that demonstrates that its star forming gas is distributedover a radius of ~750pc around the centre. the surface density of the starformation rate averaged over this region is ~1000 m_sun/yr/kpc^2. this surfacedensity is comparable to the peak in arp220, though ~2 orders of magnitudeslarger in area. this vigorous star forming event will likely give rise to amassive spheroidal component in this system.

0903.0862	co line emission in the halo of a radio galaxy at z=2.6	we report the detection of luminous co(3-2) line emission in the halo of thez=2.6 radio galaxy (hzrg) txs0828+193, which has no detected counterpart atoptical to mid-infrared wavelengths implying a stellar mass &lt; few x10^9 m_sunand relatively low star-formation rates. with the iram pdbi we find two coemission line components at the same position at ~80 kpc distance from the hzrgalong the axis of the radio jet, with different blueshifts of few 100 km s^-1relative to the hzrg and a total luminosity of ~2x10^10 k km s^-1 pc^2 detectedat 8 sigma significance. hzrgs have significant galaxy overdensities andextended halos of metal-enriched gas often with embedded clouds or filaments ofdenser material, and likely trace very massive dark-matter halos. the coemission may be associated with a gas-rich, low-mass satellite galaxy withlittle on-going star formation, in contrast to all previous co detections ofgalaxies at similar redshifts. alternatively, the co may be related to a gascloud or filament and perhaps jet-induced gas cooling in the outer halo,somewhat in analogy with extended co emission found in low-redshift galaxyclusters.

0906.2493	molecular gas in nuclei of galaxies (nuga): xii. the head-on collision  in ngc1961	we present high-resolution co(1-0) and co(2-1) maps of the liner 2 galaxyngc1961. this galaxy is unusual among late-type (sc) disk galaxies in having avery large radial extent and inferred dynamical mass. we propose a head-oncollision scenario to explain the perturbed morphology of this galaxy- both theoff-centered rings and the inflated radius. this scenario is supported by thedetection of a steep velocity gradient in the co(1-0) map at the position of asouthwest peak in radio continuum and near-infrared emission. this peak wouldrepresent the remnant of the disrupting companion. we use numerical models todemonstrate the plausibility of the scenario. while ram pressure strippingcould in principle be important for shocking the atomic gas and produce thestriking head-tail morphology, the non detection of this small galaxy group inx-ray emission suggests that any hot intragroup medium has too low a density.the collision with the companion of mass ratio 1:4 produces a lopsided wave,which accounts for the sharp boundary observed in the atomic gas on thesouthern side. we argue that ngc1961 has a strongly warped disk, which givesthe false impression of a nearly face-on system; the main disk is actually moreedge-on, and this error in the true inclination has led to the surprisinglyhigh dynamical mass for a morphologically late-type galaxy. in addition, theoutward propagating ring artificially enlarges the disk. the collisionde-stabilizes the inner disk and can provide gas inflow to the active nucleus.

0910.5756	molecular gas in submillimetre-faint, star-forming ultraluminous  galaxies at z&gt;1	[abridged] we present interferometric co observations of twelve z~2submillimetre-faint, star-forming radio galaxies (sfrgs) which are thought tobe ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) possibly dominated by warmer dust(t_dust ~&gt; 40 k) than submillimetre galaxies (smgs) of similar luminosities.four other co-observed sfrgs are included from the literature, and allobservations are taken at the plateau de bure interferometer (pdbi) in thecompact configuration. ten of the sixteen sfrgs observed in co (63%) aredetected at &gt;4sigma with a mean inferred molecular gas mass of ~2*10^10 m_sun.sfrgs trend slightly above the local ulirg l_fir-l'_co relation. since sfrgsare about two times fainter in radio luminosity but exhibit similar columinosities to smgs, this suggests sfrgs are slightly more efficient starformers than smgs at the same redshifts. sfrgs also have a narrow mean co linewidth, 320+-80km/s. sfrgs bridge the gap between properties of very luminous&gt;5*10^12 l_sun smgs and those of local ulirgs and are consistent withintermediate stage major mergers. we suspect that more moderate-luminositysmgs, not yet surveyed in co, would show similar molecular gas properties tosfrgs. the agn fraction of sfrgs is consistent with smgs and is estimated to be0.3+-0.1, suggesting that sfrgs are observed near the peak phase of starformation activity and not in a later, post-smg enhanced agn phase. this cosurvey of sfrgs serves as a pilot project for the much more extensive survey ofherschel and scuba-2 selected sources which only partially overlap with smgs.better constraints on co properties of a diverse high-z ulirg population areneeded from alma to determine the evolutionary origin of extreme starbursts,and what role ulirgs serve in catalyzing the formation of massive stellarsystems in the early universe.

0912.1598	high-resolution co and radio imaging of z~2 ulirgs: extended co  structures, and implications for the universal star formation law	we present high spatial resolution (0.4", ~3.5 kpc) pdbi interferometric dataon three ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) at z~2: two submillimetregalaxies and one submillimetre faint star forming radio galaxy. the threegalaxies have been ro- bustly detected in co rotational transitions, either12co(j=4-3) or 12co(j=3-2), allowing their sizes and gas masses to beaccurately constrained. these are the highest spatial resolution observationsobserved to date (by a factor of ~2) for intermediate-excitation co emission inz~2 ulirgs. the galaxies appear extended over several resolution elements,having a mean radius of 3.7 kpc. high-resolution (0.3") combined merlin-vlaobservations of their radio continua allow an analysis of the star formationbehaviour of these galaxies, on comparable spatial scales to that of the coobservations. this 'matched beam' approach sheds light on the spatialdistribution of both molecular gas and star formation, and we can thereforecalculate accurate star formation rates and gas surface densities: this allowsus to place the three systems in the context of a kennicutt-schmidt (ks)-stylestar formation law. we find a difference in size between the co and radioemission regions, and as such we suggest that using the spatial extent of theco emission region to estimate the surface density of star formation may leadto error. this size difference also causes the star formation efficiencieswithin systems to vary by up to a factor of 5. we also find, with our newaccurate sizes, that smgs lie significantly above the ks relation, indicatingthat stars are formed more efficiently in these extreme systems than in otherhigh-z star forming galaxies.

0912.3356	dust properties of protoplanetary disks in the taurus-auriga star  forming region from millimeter wavelengths	we present the most sensitive 3 mm-survey to date of protoplanetary diskscarried in the taurus-auriga star forming region (average rms of about 0.3mjy), using the iram pdbi. with our high detection rate of 17/19, we providethe first detections at wavelengths longer than about 1 mm for 12 sources. thisenables us to study statistically the mm sed slopes and dust properties offaint disks and compare them to brighter disks using a uniform analysis method.with these new data and literature measurements at sub-millimeter andmillimeter wavelengths, we analyze the dust properties of a sample of 21isolated disks around t tauri stars in the taurus-auriga star forming region.together with the information about the disks spatial extension from sub/mm-mminterferometric studies, we derive from the observed sub-mm/mm spectral energydistribution constraints on the dust opacity law at these wavelengths, usingtwo-layer flared disk models and a self-consistent dust model that takesproperly into account the variation of the dust opacity with grain growth. wefind evidence for the presence in the disk midplane of dust particles that havegrown to sizes as large as at least 1 millimeter in all the disks of oursample, confirming what was previously observed on smaller brighter objects.this indicates that the dust coagulation from ism dust to mm-sized grains is avery fast process in protoplanetary disks, that appears to occur before a youngstellar object enters the class ii evolutionary stage. also, the amount ofthese large grains in the disk outer regions is stationary throughout all theclass ii evolutionary stage, indicating that mechanisms slowing down the dustinward migration are playing an important role in the taurus-aurigaprotoplanetary disks.

0707.3335	molecular gas in qso host galaxies at z&gt;5	we present observations with the iram plateau de bure interferometer of threeqsos at z&gt;5 aimed at detecting molecular gas in their host galaxies as tracedby co transitions. co (5-4) is detected in sdssj033829.31+002156.3 at z=5.0267,placing it amongst the most distant sources detected in co. the co emission isunresolved with a beam size of ~1", implying that the molecular gas iscontained within a compact region, less than ~3kpc in radius. we infer an upperlimit on the dynamical mass of the co emitting region of ~3x10^10msun/sin(i)^2. the comparison with the black hole mass inferred from near-irdata suggests that the bh-to-bulge mass ratio in this galaxy is significantlyhigher than in local galaxies. from the co luminosity we infer a mass reservoirof molecular gas as high as m(h2)=2.4x10^10 msun, implying that the moleculargas accounts for a significant fraction of the dynamical mass. when compared tothe star formation rate derived from the far-ir luminosity, we infer a veryshort gas exhaustion timescale (~10^7 yrs), comparable to the dynamicaltimescale. co is not detected in the other two qsos (sdssj083643.85+005453.3and sdssj163033.90+401209.6) and upper limits are given for their molecular gascontent. when combined with co observations of other type 1 agns, spanning awide redshift range (0&lt;z&lt;6.4), we find that the host galaxy co luminosity(hence molecular gas content) and the agn optical luminosity (hence bhaccretion rate) are correlated, but the relation is not linear: l(co) ~[lambda*l_lambda(4400a)]^0.72. moreover, at high redshifts (and especially atz&gt;5) the co luminosity appears to saturate. we discuss the implications ofthese findings in terms of black hole-galaxy co-evolution.

1002.2149	high molecular gas fractions in normal massive star forming galaxies in  the young universe	stars form from cold molecular interstellar gas. since this is relativelyrare in the local universe, galaxies like the milky way form only a few newstars per year. typical massive galaxies in the distant universe formed starsan order of magnitude more rapidly. unless star formation was significantlymore efficient, this difference suggests that young galaxies were much more gasrich. molecular gas observations in the distant universe have so far beenlargely restricted to very luminous, rare objects, including mergers andquasars. here we report the results of a systematic survey of molecular gas insamples of typical massive star forming galaxies at &lt;z&gt;~1.2 and 2.3, when theuniverse was 40% and 24% of its current age. our measurements provide empiricalevidence that distant star forming galaxies indeed were gas rich, and that thestar formation efficiency is not strongly dependent on cosmic epoch. theaverage fraction of cold gas relative to total galaxy baryonic mass at z= 2.3and z=1.2 is ~44% and 34%, three to ten times higher than in today's massivespiral galaxies. the slow decrease between z~2 and 1 probably requires amechanism of semi-continuous replenishment of fresh gas to the young galaxies.

1003.5180	a study of the gas-star formation relation over cosmic time	we use the first systematic data sets of co molecular line emission in z~1-3normal star forming galaxies for a comparison of the dependence ofgalaxy-averaged star formation rates on molecular gas masses at low and highredshifts, and in different galactic environments. although the current high-zsamples are still small and biased toward the luminous and massive tail of theactively star-forming 'main-sequence', a fairly clear picture is emerging.independent of whether galaxy integrated quantities or surface densities areconsidered, low- and high-z sfg galaxy populations appear to follow similarmolecular gas-star formation relations with slopes 1.1 to 1.2. thegas-depletion time scale in these sfgs grows from 0.5 gyrs at z~2 to 1.5 gyrsat z~0. because star formation depletion times are significantly smaller thanthe hubble time at all redshifts sampled, star formation rates and gasfractions are set by the balance between gas accretion from the halo andstellar feedback. in contrast, very luminous gas rich major mergers at bothlow-z and high-z produce on average 4 to10 times more far-infrared luminosityper unit gas mass. only some fraction of this difference can be explained byuncertainties in gas-mass or luminosity estimators; much of it must beintrinsic. the most likely interpretation is that the star formation relationis driven by global dynamical effects. for a given mass, the more compactmerger systems produce stars more rapidly because their gas clouds are morecompressed with shorter dynamical times, so that they churn more quicklythrough the available gas reservoir than the typical normal disk galaxies. whenthe dependence on galactic dynamical time scale is explicitly included, diskgalaxies and mergers appear to follow similar gas to star-formation relations.the mergers may be forming stars at slightly higher efficiencies than thedisks.

1005.1263	molecular gas chemistry in agn. ii. high-resolution imaging of sio  emission in ngc1068: shocks or xdr?	this paper is part of a multi-species survey of line emission from themolecular gas in the circum-nuclear disk (cnd) of the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc1068.single-dish observations have provided evidence that the abundance of siliconmonoxide(sio) in the cnd of ngc1068 is enhanced by 3-4 orders of magnitude withrespect to the values typically measured in quiescent molecular gas in thegalaxy. we aim at unveiling the mechanism(s) underlying the sio enhancement. wehave imaged with the iram plateau de bure interferometer the emission of thesio(2-1) and cn(2--1) lines in ngc1068 at 150pc and 60pc spatial resolution,respectively. we have also obtained complementary iram 30m observations of hncoand methanol (ch3oh) lines. sio is detected in a disk of 400pc size around theagn. sio abundances in the cnd of (1-5)xe-09 are about 1-2 orders of magnitudeabove those measured in the starburst ring. the overall abundance of cn in thecnd is high: (0.2-1)xe-07. the abundances of sio and cn are enhanced at theextreme velocities of gas associated with non-circular motions close to the agn(r&lt;70pc). abundances measured for cn and sio, and the correlation of cn/co andsio/co ratios with hard x-ray irradiation, suggest that the cnd of ngc1068 hasbecome a giant x-ray dominated region (xdr). the extreme properties ofmolecular gas in the circum-nuclear molecular disk of ngc1068 result from theinterplay between different processes directly linked to nuclear activity.whereas xdr chemistry offers a simple explanation for cn and sio in ngc1068,the relevance of shocks deserves further scrutiny. the inclusion of dust grainchemistry would help solve the controversy regarding the abundances of othermolecular species, like hcn, which are under-predicted by xdr models.

1008.3183	the properties of the interstellar medium within a star-forming galaxy  at z=2.3	we present an analysis of the molecular and atomic gas emission in therest-frame far-infrared and sub-millimetre, from the lensed z=2.3sub-millimetre galaxy smm j2135-0102. we obtain very high signal-to-noisedetections of 11 transitions from 3 species and limits on a further 20transitions from 9 species. we use the 12co, [ci] and hcn line strengths toinvestigate the gas mass, kinematic structure and interstellar medium (ism)chemistry, and find strong evidence for a two-phase medium comprising a hot,dense, luminous component and an underlying extended cool, low-excitationmassive component. employing photo-dissociation region models we show that onaverage the molecular gas is exposed to a uv radiation field that is ~1000 xmore intense than the milky way, with star-forming regions having acharacteristic density of n~10^4 /cm^3. these conditions are similar to thosefound in local ulirgs and in the central regions of typical starburst galaxies,even though the star formation rate is far higher in this system. the 12cospectral line energy distribution and line profiles give strong evidence thatthe system comprises multiple kinematic components with different conditions,including temperature, and line ratios suggestive of high cosmic ray fluxwithin clouds. we show that, when integrated over the galaxy, the gas andstar-formation surface densities appear to follow the kennicutt-schmidtrelation, although when compared to high-resolution sub-mm imaging, our datasuggest that this relation breaks down on scales of &lt;100pc. by virtue of thelens amplification, these observations uncover a wealth of information on thestar formation and ism at z~2.3 at a level of detail that has only recentlybecome possible at z&lt;0.1, and show the potential physical properties that willbe studied in unlensed galaxies when alma is in full operation.

1009.2495	most submillimetre galaxies are major mergers	we analyse subarcsecond resolution interferometric co line data for twelvesub-millimetre-luminous (s850um &gt; 5mjy) galaxies with redshifts between 1 and3, presenting new data for four of them. morphologically and kinematically mostof the twelve systems appear to be major mergers. five of them arewell-resolved binary systems, and seven are compact or poorly resolved. of thefour binary systems for which mass measurements for both separate componentscan be made, all have mass ratios of 1:3 or closer. furthermore, comparison ofthe ratio of compact to binary systems with that observed in local ulirgsindicates that at least a significant fraction of the compact smgs must also belate-stage mergers. in addition, the dynamical and gas masses we derive aremost consistent with the lower end of the range of stellar masses published forthese systems, favouring cosmological models in which smgs result from mergers.these results all point to the same conclusion, that likely most of the brightsmgs with l_ir &gt; 5x10e12l_sun are major mergers.

1009.2697	new constraints on dust grain size and distribution in cq tau	grain growth in circumstellar disks is expected to be the first step towardsthe formation of planetary systems. there is now evidence for grain growth inseveral disks around young stars. radially resolved images of grain growth incircumstellar disks are believed to be a powerful tool to constrain the dustevolution models and the initial stage for the formation of planets. in thispaper we attempt to provide these constraints for the disk surrounding theyoung star cq tau. this system was already suggested from previous studies tohost a population of grains grown to large sizes. we present new high angularresolution (0.3-0.9 arcsec) observations at wavelengths from 850um to 3.6cmobtained at the sma, iram-pdbi and nrao-vla interferometers. we perform acombined analysis of the spectral energy distribution and of thehigh-resolution images at different wavelengths using a model to describe thedust thermal emission from the circumstellar disk. we include a prescriptionfor the gas emission from the inner regions of the system. we detect thepresence of evolved dust by constraining the disk averaged dust opacitycoefficient beta (computed between 1.3 and 7mm) to be 0.6+/-0.1. this confirmsthe earlier suggestions that the disk contains dust grains grown to significantsizes and puts this on firmer grounds by tightly constraining the gascontamination to the observed fluxes at mm-cm wavelengths. we report someevidence of radial variations in dust properties, but current resolution andsensitivity are still too low for definitive results.

1101.2626	molecular gas in nuclei of galaxies (nuga) xiv. the barred liner/seyfert  2 galaxy ngc 3627	we present co(1-0) and co(2-1) maps of the interacting barred liner/seyfert 2galaxy ngc 3627 obtained with the iram interferometer at resolutions of 2.1" x1.3" and 0.9" x 0.6", respectively. the molecular gas emission shows a nuclearpeak, an elongated bar-like structure of ~18" (~900 pc) diameter in both comaps and, in co(1-0), a two-arm spiral feature from r~9" (~450 pc) to r~16"(~800 pc). the inner ~18" bar-like structure, with a north/south orientation(pa = 14{\deg}), forms two peaks at the extremes of this elongated emissionregion. the kinematics of the inner molecular gas shows signatures ofnon-circular motions associated both with the 18" bar-like structure and thespiral feature detected beyond it. the 1.6 micron h-band 2mass image of ngc3627 shows a stellar bar with a pa = -21{\deg}, different from the pa (=14{\deg}) of the co bar-like structure, indicating that the gas is leading thestellar bar. the torques computed with the hst-nicmos f160w image and our pdbimaps are negative down to the resolution limit of our images, ~60 pc inco(2-1). if the bar ends at ~3 kpc, coincident with corotation (cr), thetorques are negative between the cr of the bar and the nucleus, down to theresolution limit of our observations. this scenario is compatible with arecently-formed rapidly rotating bar which has had insufficient time to slowdown because of secular evolution, and thus has not yet formed an innerlindblad resonance (ilr). the presence of molecular gas inside the cr of theprimary bar, where we expect that the ilr will form, makes ngc 3627 a potentialsmoking gun of inner gas inflow. the gas is fueling the central region, and ina second step could fuel directly the active nucleus.

1104.4113	discovery of a multiply-lensed submillimeter galaxy in early hermes  herschel/spire data	we report the discovery of a bright ($f(250\mum) &gt; 400$ mjy), multiply-lensedsubmillimeter galaxy \obj\ in {\it  herschel}/spire science demonstration phase data from the hermes project.interferometric 880\mum\ submillimeter array observations resolve at least fourimages with a large separation of $\sim 9\arcsec$. a high-resolution adaptiveoptics $k_p$ image with keck/nirc2 clearly shows strong lensing arcs. follow-upspectroscopy gives a redshift of $z=2.9575$, and the lensing model gives atotal magnification of $\mu \sim 11 \pm 1$. the large image separation allowsus to study the multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution (sed) of thelensed source unobscured by the central lensing mass. thefar-ir/millimeter-wave sed is well described by a modified blackbody fit withan unusually warm dust temperature, $88 \pm 3$ k. we derive a lensing-correctedtotal ir luminosity of $(1.43 \pm 0.09) \times 10^{13}\, \mathrm{l}_{\odot}$,implying a star formation rate of $\sim 2500\, \mathrm{m}_{\odot}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. however, models primarily developed from brighter galaxiesselected at longer wavelengths are a poor fit to the full optical-to-millimetersed. a number of other strongly lensed systems have already been discovered inearly {\it herschel} data, and many more are expected as additional data arecollected.

1104.4115	redshift determination and co line excitation modeling for the  multiply-lensed galaxy hlsw-01	we report on the redshift measurement and co line excitation of hermesj105751.1+573027 (hlsw-01), a strongly lensed submillimeter galaxy discoveredin herschel/spire observations as part of the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey (hermes). hlsw-01 is an ultra-luminous galaxy with anintrinsic far-infrared luminosity of 1.4x10^(13) solar luminosities, and islensed by a massive group of galaxies into at least four images with a totalmagnification of 10.9+/-0.7. with the 100 ghz instantaneous bandwidth of thez-spec instrument on the caltech submillimeter observatory, we robustlyidentify a redshift of z=2.958+/-0.007 for this source, using the simultaneousdetection of four co emission lines (j = 7-6, j = 8-7, j = 9-8, and j = 10-9).combining the measured line fluxes for these high-j transitions with the j =1-0, j = 3-2 and j = 5-4 line fluxes measured with the green bank telescope,the combined array for research in millimeter astronomy, and the plateau debure interferometer, respectively, we model the physical properties of themolecular gas in this galaxy. we find that the full co spectral line energydistribution is well described by warm, moderate-density gas with tkin = 86-235k and n(h2) = (1.1-3.5)x10^3 cm^(-3). however, it is possible that thehighest-j transitions are tracing a small fraction of very dense gas inmolecular cloud cores, and two-component models that include a warm/densemolecular gas phase with tkin ~ 200 k, n(h2) ~ 10^5 cm^(-3) are also consistentwith these data. higher signal-to-noise measurements of the j(upper) &gt; 7transitions with high spectral resolution, combined with high spatialresolution co maps, are needed to improve our understanding of the gasexcitation, morphology, and dynamics of this interesting high-redshift galaxy.

1104.4116	dynamical structure of the molecular interstellar medium in an extremely  bright, multiply lensed z~3 submillimeter galaxy discovered with herschel	we report the detection of co 5-4, 3-2, and 1-0 emission in the stronglylensed, herschel/spire-selected submillimeter galaxy (smg) hlsw-01 atz=2.9574+/-0.0001, using the plateau de bure interferometer, the combined arrayfor research in millimeter-wave astronomy, and the green bank telescope. theobservations spatially resolve the molecular gas into four lensed images with amaximum separation of ~9", and reveal the internal gas dynamics in this system.we derive lensing-corrected co line luminosities of l'(co 1-0) = (4.17+/-0.41),l'(co 3-2) = (3.96+/-0.20) and l'(co 5-4) = (3.45+/-0.20) x 10^10(mu_l/10.9)^-1 kkm/s pc^2, corresponding to luminosity ratios of r_31 =0.95+/-0.10, r_53 = 0.87+/-0.06, and r_51 = 0.83+/-0.09. this suggests a totalmolecular gas mass of mgas = 3.3 x 10^10 (alpha_co/0.8) (mu_l/10.9)^-1 msun.the gas mass, gas mass fraction, gas depletion timescale, star formationefficiency, and specific star formation rate are typical for an smg. thevelocity structure of the gas reservoir suggests that the brightest two lensedimages are dynamically resolved projections of the same dust-obscured region inthe galaxy that are kinematically offset from the unresolved fainter images.the resolved kinematics appear consistent with the complex velocity structureobserved in major, `wet' (i.e., gas-rich) mergers. major mergers are commonlyobserved in smgs, and are likely to be responsible for fueling their intensestarbursts at high gas consumption rates. this study demonstrates the level ofdetail to which galaxies in the early universe can be studied by utilizing theincrease in effective spatial resolution and sensitivity provided bygravitational lensing.

1104.4119	modeling of the hermes j105751.1+573027 submillimeter source lensed by a  dark matter dominated foreground group of galaxies	we present the results of a gravitational lensing analysis of the bright$\zs=2.957$ sub-millimeter galaxy (smg), hermes j105751.1+573027 found in {\itherschel}/spire science demonstration phase data from the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey (hermes) project. the high resolution imaging available inoptical and near-ir channels, along with co emission obtained with the plateaude bure interferometer, allow us to precisely estimate the intrinsic sourceextension and hence estimate the total lensing magnification to be $\mu=10.9\pm0.7$. we measure the half-light radius $r_{\rm eff}$ of the source in therest-frame near-uv and $v$ bands that characterize the unobscured light comingfrom stars and find $r_{\rm eff,*}= [2.0 \pm 0.1]$ kpc, in good agreement withrecent studies on the submillimeter galaxy population. this lens model is alsoused to estimate the size of the gas distribution ($r_{\rm eff,gas}=[1.1\pm0.5]$) kpc by mapping back in the source plane the co (j=5-4) transitionline emission. the lens modeling yields a relatively large einstein radius$r_{\rm ein}= 4\farcs10 \pm 0\farcs02$, corresponding to a deflector velocitydispersion of [$483\pm 16] \,\kms$. this shows that hermes j105751.1+573027 islensed by a {\it galaxy group-size} dark matter halo at redshift $\zl\sim 0.6$.the projected dark matter contribution largely dominates the mass budget withinthe einstein radius with $f_{\rm dm}(&lt;r_{\rm ein})\sim 80%$. this fractionreduces to $f_{\rm dm}(&lt;r_{\rm eff,g1}\simeq 4.5\kpc)\sim 47%$ within theeffective radius of the main deflecting galaxy of stellar mass $m_{\rm*,g1}=[8.5\pm 1.6] \times 10^{11}\msun$. at this smaller scale the dark matterfraction is consistent with results already found for massive lensingellipticals at $z\sim0.2$ from the slacs survey.

1105.6089	sma/pdbi multiple line observations of the nearby seyfert2 galaxy ngc  1068: shock related gas kinematics and heating in the central 100pc?	we present high angular resolution (0.5-2.0") observations of the mmcontinuum and the 12co(j=3-2), 13co(j=3-2), 13co(j=2-1), c18o(j=2-1),hcn(j=3-2), hco+(j=4-3) and hco+(j=3-2) line emission in the circumnuclear disk(r=100pc) of the proto-typical seyfert type-2 galaxy ngc1068, carried out withthe submillimeter array. we further include in our analysis new 13co(j=1-0) andimproved 12co(j=2-1) observations of ngc1068 at high angular resolution(1.0-2.0") and sensitivity, conducted with the iram plateau de bureinterferometer. based on the complex dynamics of the molecular gas emissionindicating non-circular motions in the central ~100pc, we propose a scenario inwhich part of the molecular gas in the circumnuclear disk of ngc1068 isradially blown outwards as a result of shocks. this shock scenario is furthersupported by quite warm (tkin&gt;=200k) and dense (nh2=10^4cm^-3) gas constrainedfrom the observed molecular line ratios. the hcn abundance in the circumnucleardisk is found to be [hcn]/[12co]=10^-3.5. this is slightly higher than theabundances derived for galactic and extragalactic starforming/starburstingregions. this results lends further support to x-ray enhanced hcn formation inthe circumnuclear disk of ngc1068, as suggested by earlier studies. the hco+abundance ([hco+]/[12co]=10^-5) appears to be somewhat lower than that ofgalactic and extragalactic starforming/starbursting regions. when trying to fitthe cm to mm continuum emission by different thermal and non-thermal processes,it appears that electron-scattered synchrotron emission yields the best resultswhile thermal free-free emission seems to over-predict the mm continuumemission.

1106.2098	the metallicity dependence of the co {\rightarrow} h_2 conversion factor  in z&gt;1 star forming galaxies	we use the first systematic samples of co millimeter emission in z&gt;1'main-sequence' star forming galaxies (sfgs) to study the metallicitydependence of the conversion factor {\alpha}co, from co line luminosity tomolecular gas mass. the molecular gas depletion rate inferred from the ratio ofthe star formation rate (sfr) to co luminosity, is ~1 gyr-1 for near-solarmetallicity galaxies with stellar masses above m_s~1e11 m_sun. in this regimethe depletion rate does not vary more than a factor of two to three as afunction of molecular gas surface density, or redshift between z~0 and 2. belowm_s the depletion rate increases rapidly with decreasing metallicity. we arguethat this trend is not caused by starburst events, by changes in the physicalparameters of the molecular clouds, or by the impact of the fundamentalmetallicity-sfr-stellar mass relation. a more probable explanation is that theconversion factor is metallicity dependent and that star formation can occur in'co-dark' gas. the trend is also expected theoretically from the effect ofenhanced photodissociation of co by ultraviolet radiation at low metallicity.from the available z~0 and z~1-3 samples we constrain the slope of thelog({\alpha}co) -log (metallicity) relation to range between -1 and -2, fairlyinsensitive to the assumed slope of the gas-star formation rate relation.because of the lower metallicities near the peak of the galaxy formationactivity at z~1-2 compared to z~0, we suggest that molecular gas massesestimated from co luminosities have to be substantially corrected upward forgalaxies below m_s.

1107.4979	observation of h2o in a strongly lensed herschel-atlas source at z=2.3	the herschel survey, h-atlas, with its large areal coverage, has recentlydiscovered a number of bright, strongly lensed high-z submillimeter galaxies.the strong magnification makes it possible to study molecular species otherthan co, which are otherwise difficult to observe in high-z galaxies. among thelensed galaxies already identified by h-atlas, the source j090302.9-014127b(sdp.17b) at z = 2.305 is remarkable due to its excitation conditions and atentative detection of the h2o 202-111 emission line (lupu et al. 2010). wereport observations of this line in sdp.17b using the iram interferometerequipped with its new 277- 371ghz receivers. the h2o line is detected at aredshift of z = 2.3049+/-0.0006, with a flux of 7.8+/-0.5 jy km s-1 and a fwhmof 250+/-60 km s-1. the new flux is 2.4 times weaker than the previoustentative detection, although both remain marginally consistent within1.6-sigma. the intrinsic line luminosity and ratio of h2o(202-111)/co8-7 seemcomparable with those of the nearby starburst/enshrouded-agn mrk 231,suggesting that sdp.17b could also host a luminous agn. the detection of astrong h2o 202-111 line in sdp.17b implies an efficient excitation mechanism ofthe water levels that must occur in very dense and warm interstellar gas.

1203.5844	detection of atomic carbon [cii] 158 micron and dust emission from a  z=7.1 quasar host galaxy	using the iram plateau de bure interferometer, we report the detection of the158 micron [cii] emission line and underlying dust continuum in the host galaxyof the quasar ulas j112001.48+064124.3 (hereafter j1120+0641) atz=7.0842+/-0.0004. this is the highest redshift detection of the [cii] line todate, and allows us to put first constraints on the physical properties of thehost galaxy. the [cii] line luminosity is (1.2+/-0.2)x10^9 lsun, which is afactor ~4 lower than observed in a luminous quasar at z=6.42 (sdss j1148+5251).the underlying far-infrared (fir) continuum has a flux density of 0.61+/-0.16mjy, similar to the average flux density of z~6 quasars that were notindividually detected in the rest-frame fir. assuming the fir luminosity ofl_fir = 5.8x10^11-1.8x10^12 lsun is mainly powered by star-formation, we derivea star-formation rate in the range 160-440 msun/yr and a total dust mass in thehost galaxy of 6.7x10^7-5.7x10^8 msun (both numbers have significantuncertainties given the unknown nature of dust at these redshifts). the [cii]line width of sigma_v=100+/-15 km/s is among the smallest observed whencompared to the molecular line widths detected in z~6 quasars. both the [cii]and dust continuum emission are spatially unresolved at the current angularresolution of 2.0x1.7 arcsec^2 (corresponding to 10x9 kpc^2 at the redshift ofj1120+0641).

1204.2904	evidence of strong quasar feedback in the early universe	most theoretical models invoke quasar driven outflows to quench starformation in massive galaxies, this feedback mechanism is required to accountfor the population of old and passive galaxies observed in the local universe.the discovery of massive, old and passive galaxies at z=2, implies that suchquasar feedback onto the host galaxy must have been at work very early on,close to the reionization epoch. we have observed the [cii]158um transition insdssj114816.64+525150.3 that, at z=6.4189, is one of the most distant quasarsknown. we detect broad wings of the line tracing a quasar-driven massiveoutflow. this is the most distant massive outflow ever detected and is likelytracing the long sought quasar feedback, already at work in the early universe.the outflow is marginally resolved on scales of about 16 kpc, implying that theoutflow can really affect the whole galaxy, as required by quasar feedbackmodels. the inferred outflow rate, dm/dt &gt; 3500 msun/yr, is the highest everfound. at this rate the outflow can clean the gas in the host galaxy, andtherefore quench star formation, in a few million years.

1301.0628	towards a resolved kennicutt-schmidt law at high redshift	massive galaxies in the distant universe form stars at much higher rates thantoday. although direct resolution of the star forming regions of these galaxiesis still a challenge, recent molecular gas observations at the iram plateau debure interferometer enable us to study the star formation efficiency onsubgalactic scales around redshift z = 1.2. we present a method for obtainingthe gas and star formation rate (sfr) surface densities of ensembles of clumpscomposing galaxies at this redshift, even though the corresponding scales arenot resolved. this method is based on identifying these structures inposition-velocity diagrams corresponding to slices within the galaxies. we useunique iram observations of the co(3-2) rotational line and deep2 spectra offour massive star forming distant galaxies - egs13003805, egs13004291,egs12007881, and egs13019128 in the aegis terminology - to determine the gasand sfr surface densities of the identifiable ensembles of clumps thatconstitute them. the integrated co line luminosity is assumed to be directlyproportional to the total gas mass, and the sfr is deduced from the [oii] line.we identify the ensembles of clumps with the angular resolution available inboth co and [oii] spectroscopy; i.e., 1-1.5". sfr and gas surface densities areaveraged in areas of this size, which is also the thickness of the deep2 slitsand of the extracted iram slices, and we derive a spatially resolvedkennicutt-schmidt (ks) relation on a scale of ~8 kpc. the data generallyindicates an average depletion time of 1.9 gyr, but with significant variationsfrom point to point within the galaxies.

1302.4436	herschel-atlas: a binary hylirg pinpointing a cluster of starbursting  proto-ellipticals	panchromatic observations of the best candidate hylirg from the widestherschel extragalactic imaging survey have led to the discovery of at leastfour intrinsically luminous z=2.41 galaxies across a ~100-kpc region - acluster of starbursting proto-ellipticals. via sub-arcsecond interferometricimaging we have measured accurate gas and star-formation surface densities. thetwo brightest galaxies span ~3 kpc fwhm in submm/radio continuum and co j=4-3,and double that in co j=1-0. the broad co line is due partly to the multitudeof constituent galaxies and partly to large rotational velocities in twocounter-rotating gas disks -- a scenario predicted to lead to the most intensestarbursts, which will therefore come in pairs. the disks have m(dyn) ofseveral x 10^11 msun, and gas fractions of ~40%. velocity dispersions aremodest so the disks are unstable, potentially on scales commensurate with theirradii: these galaxies are undergoing extreme bursts of star formation, notconfined to their nuclei, at close to the eddington limit. their specificstar-formation rates place them ~&gt;5x above the main sequence, which supposedlycomprises large gas disks like these. their high star-formation efficienciesare difficult to reconcile with a simple volumetric star-formation law. n-bodyand dark matter simulations suggest this system is the progenitor of ab(inary)-type ~10^14.6-msun cluster.

1304.4381	high angular resolution observations towards omc-2 fir 4: dissecting an  intermediate-mass protocluster	omc-2 fir 4 is one of the closest known young intermediate-massprotoclusters, located at a distance of 420 pc in orion. this region is one ofthe few where the complete 500-2000 ghz spectrum has been observed with theheterodyne spectrometer hifi on board the herschel satellite, and unbiasedspectral surveys at 0.8, 1, 2 and 3 mm have been obtained with the jcmt andiram 30-m telescopes.  in order to investigate the morphology of this region, we used the iramplateau de bure interferometer to image omc-2 fir 4 in the 2-mm continuumemission, as well as in dco+(2-1), dcn(2-1), c34s(3-2), and several ch3ohlines. in addition, we analysed observations of the nh3(1,1) and (2,2)inversion transitions made with the very large array of the nrao. the resultingmaps have an angular resolution which allows us to resolve structures of 5",equivalent to 2000 au.  our observations reveal three spatially resolved sources within omc-2 fir 4,of one or several solar masses each, with hints of further unresolvedsubstructure within them. two of these sources have elongated shapes and areassociated with dust continuum emission peaks, thus likely containing at leastone molecular core each. one of them also displays radio continuum emission,which may be attributed to a young b3-b4 star that dominates the overallluminosity output of the region. the third source identified displays adco+(2-1) emission peak, and weak dust continuum emission. its higher abundanceof dco+ relative to the other two regions suggests a lower temperature andtherefore its possible association with either a younger low-mass protostar ora starless core. it may alternatively be part of the colder envelope of omc-2fir 4.  our interferometric observations evidence the complexity of this region,where multiple cores, chemical differentiation and an ionised region allcoexist within an area of only 10000 au.

1305.4930	the rapid assembly of an elliptical galaxy of 400 billion solar masses  at a redshift of 2.3	stellar archeology shows that massive elliptical galaxies today formedrapidly about ten billion years ago with star formation rates above severalhundreds solar masses per year (m_sun/yr). their progenitors are likely thesub-millimeter-bright galaxies (smgs) at redshifts (z) greater than 2. whilesmgs' mean molecular gas mass of 5x10^10 m_sun can explain the formation oftypical elliptical galaxies, it is inadequate to form ellipticals that alreadyhave stellar masses above 2x10^11 m_sun at z ~ 2. here we reportmulti-wavelength high-resolution observations of a rare merger of two massivesmgs at z = 2.3. the system is currently forming stars at a tremendous rate of2,000 m_sun/yr. with a star formation efficiency an order-of-magnitude greaterthan that of normal galaxies, it will quench the star formation by exhaustingthe gas reservoir in only ~200 million years. at a projected separation of 19kiloparsecs, the two massive starbursts are about to merge and form a passiveelliptical galaxy with a stellar mass of ~4x10^11 m_sun. our observations showthat gas-rich major galaxy mergers, concurrent with intense star formation, canform the most massive elliptical galaxies by z ~ 1.5.

1311.2595	massive molecular outflows and evidence for agn feedback from co  observations	we study the properties of massive, galactic-scale outflows of molecular gasand investigate their impact on galaxy evolution. we present new iram pdbico(1-0) observations of local ulirgs and qso hosts: clear signature of massiveand energetic molecular outflows, extending on kpc scales, is found in theco(1-0) kinematics of four out of seven sources, with measured outflow rates ofseveral 100 msun/yr. we combine these new observations with data from theliterature, and explore the nature and origin of massive molecular outflowswithin an extended sample of 19 local galaxies. we find thatstarburst-dominated galaxies have an outflow rate comparable to their sfr, oreven higher by a factor of ~ 2-4, implying that starbursts can indeed beeffective in removing cold gas from galaxies. nevertheless, our results suggestthat the presence of an agn can boost the outflow rate by a large factor, whichis found to increase with the l_agn/l_bol ratio. the gas depletion time-scalesdue to molecular outflows are anti-correlated with the presence and luminosityof an agn in these galaxies, and range from a few hundred million years instarburst galaxies, down to just a few million years in galaxies hostingpowerful agns. in quasar hosts the depletion time-scales due to the outflow aremuch shorter than the depletion time-scales due to star formation. we estimatethe outflow kinetic power and find that, for galaxies hosting powerful agns, itcorresponds to about 5% of the agn luminosity, as expected by models of agnfeedback. moreover, we find that momentum rates of about 20 l_agn/c are commonamong the agn-dominated sources in our sample. for "pure" starburst galaxiesour data tentatively support models in which outflows are mostlymomentum-driven by the radiation pressure from young stars onto dusty clouds.

1401.4120	alma reveals the feeding of the seyfert 1 nucleus in ngc 1566	we report alma observations of co(3-2) emission in the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc1566, at a spatial resolution of 25 pc. our aim is to investigate themorphology and dynamics of the gas inside the central kpc, and to probe nuclearfueling and feedback phenomena. ngc 1566 has a nuclear bar of 1.7 kpc radiusand a conspicuous grand design spiral starting from this radius. the alma fieldof view, of diameter 0.9 kpc, lies well inside the nuclear bar and reveals amolecular trailing spiral structure from 50 to 300~pc in size, which iscontributing to fuel the nucleus, according to its negative gravity torques.  the spiral starts with a large pitch angle from the center and then winds upin a pseudo-ring at the inner lindblad resonance (ilr) of the nuclear bar.  this is the first time that a trailing spiral structure is clearly seendriving the gas inwards inside the ilr ring of the nuclear bar. this phenomenonshows that the massive central black hole has a significant dynamical influenceon the gas, triggering its fueling.  the gaseous spiral is well correlated with the dusty spiral seen throughextinction in hst images, and also with a spiral feature emitting 0.87mmcontinuum. this continuum emission must come essentially from cold dust heatedby the interstellar radiation field. the hcn(4-3) and hco+(4-3) lines weresimultaneously mapped and detected in the nuclear spiral. the hco+(4-3) line is3 times stronger than the hcn(4-3), as expected when star formation excitationdominates over active galactic nucleus (agn) heating. the co(3-2)/hco+(4-3)integrated intensity ratio is \sim 100.  the molecular gas is in remarkably regular rotation, with only slightnon-circular motions at the periphery of the nuclear spiral arms. theseperturbations are quite small, and no outflow nor agn feedback is detected.

0802.2775	molecular gas in nuclei of galaxies (nuga): ix. the decoupled bars and  gas inflow in ngc 2782	we present co(1-0) and co(2-1) maps of the starburst/seyfert 1 galaxy ngc2782, obtained with the iram interferometer. the co emission is aligned alongthe stellar nuclear bar of radius 1 kpc, configured in an elongated structurewith two spiral arms at high pitch angle. at the extremity of the nuclear bar,the co changes direction to trace two more extended spiral features at a lowerpitch angle. these are the beginning of two straight dust lanes, which arealigned parallel to an oval distortion, reminiscent of a primary bar, almostperpendicular to the nuclear one. the two embedded bars appear in spitzer iracnear-infrared images, and hst color images, although highly obscured by dust inthe latter. we compute the torques exerted by the stellar bars on the gas, andfind systematically negative average torques down to the resolution limit ofthe images, providing evidence of gas inflow tantalizingly close to the nucleusof ngc 2782. the observations are well reproduced by numerical simulations,including gas dissipation, which predict the secondary bar decoupling, theformation of an elongated ring at the 1 kpc-radius inner lindblad resonance(ilr) of the primary bar, and the gas inflow to the ilr of the nuclear bar. thepresence of molecular gas inside the ilr of the primary bar, transported by asecond nuclear bar, is a potential ``smoking gun''; the gas there is certainlyfueling the central starburst, and in a second step could fuel directly theagn.

1409.1171	combined co &amp; dust scaling relations of depletion time and molecular gas  fractions with cosmic time, specific star formation rate and stellar mass	we combine molecular gas masses inferred from co emission in 500 star forminggalaxies (sfgs) between z=0 and 3, from the iram-coldgass, phibss1/2 and othersurveys, with gas masses derived from herschel far-ir dust measurements in 512galaxy stacks over the same stellar mass/redshift range. we constrain thescaling relations of molecular gas depletion time scale (tdepl) and gas tostellar mass ratio (mmolgas/m*) of sfgs near the star formation main-sequencewith redshift, specific star formation rate (ssfr) and stellar mass (m*). theco- and dust-based scaling relations agree remarkably well. this suggests thatthe co-h2 mass conversion factor varies little within 0.6dex of the mainsequence (ssfr(ms,z,m*)), and less than 0.3dex throughout this redshift range.this study builds on and strengthens the results of earlier work. we find thattdepl scales as (1+z)^-0.3 *(ssfr/ssfr(ms,z,m*))^-0.5, with little dependenceon m*. the resulting steep redshift dependence of mmolgas/m* ~(1+z)^3 mirrorsthat of the ssfr and probably reflects the gas supply rate. the decreasing gasfractions at high m* are driven by the flattening of the sfr-m* relation.throughout the redshift range probed a larger ssfr at constant m* is due to acombination of an increasing gas fraction and a decreasing depletion timescale. as a result galaxy integrated samples of the mmolgas-sfr rate relationexhibit a super-linear slope, which increases with the range of ssfr. withthese new relations it is now possible to determine mmolgas with an accuracy of0.1dex in relative terms, and 0.2dex including systematic uncertainties.

1503.04112	chemical composition of the circumstellar disk around ab aurigae	aims. our goal is to determine the molecular composition of the circumstellardisk around ab aurigae (hereafter, ab aur). ab aur is a prototypical herbig aestar and the understanding of its disk chemistry is of paramount importance tounderstand the chemical evolution of the gas in warm disks. methods. we usedthe iram 30-m telescope to perform a sensitive search for molecular lines in abaur as part of the iram large program asai (a chemical survey of sun-likestar-forming regions). these data were complemented with interferometricobservations of the hco+ 1-0 and c17o 1-0 lines using the iram plateau de bureinterferometer (pdbi). single-dish and interferometric data were used toconstrain chemical models. results. throughout the survey, several lines of coand its isotopologues, hco+, h2co, hcn, cn and cs, were detected. in addition,we detected the so 54-33 and 56-45 lines, confirming the previous tentativedetection. comparing to other t tauri's and herbig ae disks, ab aur presentslow hcn 3-2/hco+ 3-2 and cn 2-1/hcn 3-2 line intensity ratios, similar to othertransition disks. ab aur is the only protoplanetary disk detected in so thusfar. conclusions. we modeled the line profiles using a chemical model and aradiative transfer 3d code. our model assumes a flared disk in hydrostaticequilibrium. the best agreement with observations was obtained for a disk witha mass of 0.01 msun , rin=110 au, rout=550 au, a surface density radial indexof 1.5 and an inclination of 27 deg. the intensities and line profiles werereproduced within a factor of 2 for most lines. this agreement is reasonabletaking into account the simplicity of our model that neglects any structurewithin the disk. however, the hcn 3-2 and cn 2-1 line intensities werepredicted more intense by a factor of &gt;10. we discuss several scenarios toexplain this discrepancy.

1505.04705	high-resolution imaging of the molecular outflows in two mergers:  iras17208-0014 and ngc1614	galaxy evolution scenarios predict that the feedback of star formation andnuclear activity (agn) can drive the transformation of gas-rich spiral mergersinto ulirgs, and, eventually, lead to the build-up of qso/elliptical hosts. westudy the role that star formation and agn feedback have in launching andmaintaining the molecular outflows in two starburst-dominated advanced mergers,ngc1614 and iras17208-0014, by analyzing the distribution and kinematics oftheir molecular gas reservoirs. we have used the pdbi array to image with highspatial resolution (0.5"-1.2") the co(1-0) and co(2-1) line emissions inngc1614 and iras17208-0014, respectively. the velocity fields of the gas areanalyzed and modeled to find the evidence of molecular outflows in thesesources and characterize the mass, momentum and energy of these components.while most (&gt;95%) of the co emission stems from spatially-resolved(~2-3kpc-diameter) rotating disks, we also detect in both mergers the emissionfrom high-velocity line wings that extend up to +-500-700km/s, well beyond theestimated virial range associated with rotation and turbulence. the kinematicmajor axis of the line wing emission is tilted by ~90deg in ngc1614 and by~180deg in iras17208-0014 relative to their respective rotating disk majoraxes. these results can be explained by the existence of non-coplanar molecularoutflows in both systems. in stark contrast with ngc1614, where star formationalone can drive its molecular outflow, the mass, energy and momentum budgetrequirements of the molecular outflow in iras17208-0014 can be best accountedfor by the existence of a so far undetected (hidden) agn of l_agn~7x10^11l_sun. the geometry of the molecular outflow in iras17208-0014 suggests thatthe outflow is launched by a non-coplanar disk that may be associated with aburied agn in the western nucleus.

0807.3674	interferometric co observations of submillimeter-faint, radio-selected  starburst galaxies at z~2	high-redshift, dust-obscured galaxies -- selected to be luminous in the radiobut relatively faint at 850um -- appear to represent a different populationfrom the ultra-luminous submillimeter- (submm-) bright population. they may bestar-forming galaxies with hotter dust temperatures or they may have lowerfar-infrared luminosities and larger contributions from obscured activegalactic nuclei (agn). here we present observations of three z~2 examples ofthis population, which we term submm-faint radio galaxies (sfrgs) in co(3-2)using the iram plateau de bure interferometer to study their gas and dynamicalproperties. we estimate the molecular gas mass in each of the three sfrgs(8.3x10^{9} m_odot, &lt;5.6x10^{9} m_odot and 15.4x10^{9} m_odot, respectively)and, in the case of rg163655, a dynamical mass by measurement of the width ofthe co(3-2) line (8x10^{10} csc^2i m_odot). while these gas masses aresubstantial, on average they are 4x lower than submm-selected galaxies (smgs).radio-inferred star formation rates (&lt;sfr_radio&gt;=970 m_odot\yr) suggest muchhigher star-formation efficiencies than are found for smgs, and shorter gasdepletion time scales (~11 myr), much shorter than the time required to formtheir current stellar masses (~160 myr; ~10^{11} m_odot). by contrast, sfrs maybe overestimated by factors of a few, bringing the efficiencies in line withthose typically measured for other ultraluminous star-forming galaxies andsuggesting sfrgs are more like ultraviolet- (uv-)selected star-forming galaxieswith enhanced radio emission. a tentative detection of \rga at 350um suggestshotter dust temperatures -- and thus similar gas-to-dust mass fractions -- asthe smgs. we conclude that sfrgs' radio luminosities are larger than wouldnaturally scale from local ulirgs given their gas masses or gas fractions.

0705.3662	molecular gas in nuclei of galaxies (nuga) vii. ngc4569, a large scale  bar funnelling gas into the nuclear region	this work is part of the nuga survey of co emission in nearby activegalaxies. we present observations of ngc4569, a member of the virgo cluster. weanalyse the molecular gas distribution and kinematics in the central region andwe investigate a possible link to the strong starburst present at the nucleus.70% of the 1.1x10^9 msolar of molecular gas detected in the inner 20" is foundto be concentrated within the inner 800 pc and is distributed along the largescale stellar bar seen in near-infrared observations. a hole in the codistribution coincides with the nucleus where most of the halpha emission andblue light are emitted. the kinematics are modelled in three different ways,ranging from the purely geometrical to the most physical. this approach allowsus to constrain progressively the physical properties of the galaxy andeventually to emerge with a reasonable fit to an analytical model of orbits ina barred potential. fitting an axisymmetric model shows that the non-circularmotions must be comparable in amplitude to the circular motions (120 km/s).fitting a model based on elliptical orbits allows us to identify withconfidence the single inner lindblad resonance (ilr) of the large scale bar.finally, a model based on analytical solutions for the gas particle orbits in aweakly barred potential constrained by the ilr radius reproduces theobservations well. the mass inflow rate is then estimated and discussed basedon the best fit model solution. the gravitational torques implied by this modelare able to efficiently funnel the gas inside the ilr down to 300 pc, althoughanother mechanism must take over to fuel the nuclear starburst inside 100 pc.

astro-ph;0009195	a ridge of recent massive star formation between sgr b2m and sgr b2n	we present single dish and interferometric maps of several rotationaltransitions of hc3n vibrationally excited levels towards sgr b2. the singledish maps show, for the first time, new four bright clumps (sgr b2r1 to b2r4)in the ridge connecting the main cores sgr b2m and sgr b2n, and a lowbrightness extended region to the west of the ridge (sgr b2w). the physicalproperties and the kinematics of all hot cores have been derived from the hc3n*lines. our high angular resolution images show that the sgr b2n hot core breaksin two different hot cores, sgr b2n1 and n2, with different radial velocitiesand separated by 2 arcsec in declination. we find that the excitation of thehc3n* emission in all hot cores can be represented by a single temperature andthat the linewidth of the hc3n* rotational lines arising from differentvibrational levels systematically decreases as the energy of the vibrationallevel increases. the systematic trend in the linewidth is likely related to theincrease of the velocity as the distance to the exciting source increases. thedifferent hc3n abundances in the hot cores reflect different stages ofevolution due to time dependent chemistry and/or photo-dissociation by uvradiation from nearby hii regions. we propose that sgr b2m and b2n contain acluster of 20-30 hot cores and that the sgr b2r1-b2r4 hot cores representisolated formation of massive stars.

astro-ph;0201009	sio chimneys and supershells in m82	in this letter we present the first images of the emission of sio and h13co+in the nucleus of the starburst galaxy m82. contrary to other molecular speciesthat mainly trace the distribution of the star-forming molecular gas within thedisk, the sio emission extends noticeably out of the galaxy plane. the bulk ofthe sio emission is restricted to two major features. the first feature,referred to as the sio supershell, is an open shell of 150 pc diameter, located120 pc west from the galaxy center.  the sio supershell represents the inner front of a molecular shell expandingat 40 km/s, produced by mass ejection around a supercluster of young starscontaining supernova remnant snr 41.95+57.5. the second feature is a verticalfilament, referred to as the sio chimney, emanating from the disk at 200 pceast from the galaxy center. the sio chimney reaches a 500 pc vertical height,and it is associated with the most prominent chimney identified in radiocontinuum maps. the kinematics, morphology, and fractional abundances of thesio gas features in m82 can be explained in the framework of shocked chemistrydriven by local episodes of gas ejection from the starburst disk.

(2003), a comparison of the line flux ratios withpredictions from a large velocity gradient model suggests that the gas islikely of high excitation, at densities ~10^5 cm^-3 and a temperature ~100 k.since in this case the co lines appear to have moderate optical depths, the gasmust be extended over a few kpc. the gas mass detected in j1148+5251 can fuelstar formation at the rate implied by the far-infrared luminosity for less than10 million years, a time comparable to the dynamical time of the region. thegas must therefore be replenished quickly, and metal and dust enrichment mustoccur fast. the strong dust emission and massive, dense gas reservoir at z~6.4provide further evidence that vigorous star formation is co-eval with the rapidgrowth of massive black holes at these early epochs of the universe.

astro-ph;0403483	new light on the s235a-b star forming region	the s235a-b star forming region has been extensively observed in the pastfrom the radio to the near-ir, but what was happening in the immediatesurroundings of the water maser, placed in between the two nebulosities, wasstill unclear because of insufficient resolution especially in the spectralrange from the far-ir to the mm, even though there were sound indications thatnew young stellar objects (ysos) are being formed there. we present here newhigh resolution maps at mm wavelengths in different molecules (hco+, c34s,h2cs, so2 and ch3cn), as well as in the 1.2 and 3.3 mm continuum obtained withthe plateau de bure interferometer, and jcmt observations at 450 micron and 850micron that unambiguously reveal the presence of new ysos placed in between thetwo hii regions s235a and s235b and associated with the water maser. amolecular core and an unresolved source in the mm and in the sub-mm are centredon the maser, with indication of mass infall onto the core. two molecularbipolar outflows and a jet originate from the same position. weak evidence isfound for a molecular rotating disk perpendicular to the direction of the mainbipolar outflow. the derived parameters indicate that one of the ysos is anintermediate luminosity object (l~1000 lsun) in a very early evolutionaryphase, embedded in a molecular core of ~100 msun, with a temperature of 30 k.the main source of energy for the yso could come from gravitational infall,thus making of this yso a rare example of intermediate luminosity protostarrepresenting a link between the earliest evolutionary phases of massive starsand low mass protostars of class 0-i.

astro-ph;0503055	an interferometric co survey of luminous submm galaxies	in this paper we present results from an iram plateau de bure millimetre-waveinterferometer (pdbi) survey for co emission towards radio-detectedsubmillimetre galaxies (smgs) with known optical and near-infraredspectroscopic redshifts. five sources in the redshift range z~1-3.5 weredetected, nearly doubling the number of smgs detected in co. we summarise theproperties of all 12 co-detected smgs, as well as 6 sources not detected in coby our survey, and use this sample to explore the bulk physical properties ofthe smg population as a whole. the median co line luminosity of the smgs is&lt;l_co&gt; = (3.8 +- 2.0) x 10^10 k km/s pc^2. using a co-to-h_2 conversion factorappropriate for starburst galaxies, this corresponds to a molecular gas mass&lt;m(h_2)&gt; = (3.0 +- 1.6) x 10^10 msun within a ~2kpc radius, about four timesgreater than the most luminous local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs)but comparable to that of the most extreme high-redshift radio galaxies andqsos. the median co fwhm linewidth is broad, &lt;fwhm&gt; = 780 +- 320 km/s, and thesmgs often have double peaked line profiles, indicative of either a merger or adisk. from their median gas reservoirs (~3 x 10^10 msun) and star-formationrates (&gt;700 msun/yr) we estimate a lower limit on the typical gas-depletiontime scale of &gt;40myr in smgs. this is marginally below the typical age expectedfor the starbursts in smgs, and suggests that negative feedback processes mayplay an important role in prolonging the gas consumption time scale. we find astatistically-significant correlation between the far-infrared and columinosities of the smgs which extends the observed correlation for localulirgs to higher luminosities and higher redshifts.

astro-ph;0510290	large-scale molecular shocks in galaxies: the sio interferometer map of  ic342	(abridged) we present the first high-resolution (5.6''x5.1'') images of theemission of silicon monoxide (sio) in the nearby spiral ic342, obtained withthe iram plateau de bure interferometer. we have mapped the emission of thesio(2-1) and h13co+(1-0) lines in a 0.9kpcx1.3kpc region around the nucleus ofic342. the bulk of the line emission comes from a 290pc spiral arm and a r~80pcnuclear ring. the distribution of sio clouds is mostly anticorrelated with thecontinuum emission at 87ghz, dominated by thermal free-free bremsstrahlung. thesio/h13co+ intensity ratio increases by an order of magnitude from the nuclearring to the spiral arm. furthermore the gas kinematics show significantdifferences between sio and h13co+ over the spiral arm, where the linewidths ofsio are 2 times larger than that of h13co+. the average abundance of sio in theinner r~320pc, x(sio)&gt;2x10^{-10}, evidences that shock chemistry is at work inic342. we have compared the emission of sio with another tracer of molecularshocks: the emission of methanol (ch3oh). the significant difference of thex(sio) measured between the spiral arm (~a few 10^{-9}) and the nuclear ring(~10^{-10}) is not echoed by a comparable variation in the sio/ch3oh intensityratio. this implies that the typical shock velocities should be similar in bothregions. in contrast, the fraction of shocked molecular gas should be 5-7 timeslarger in the spiral arm (up to ~10% of the available molecular gas mass overthe arm region) compared to the nuclear ring. we conclude that the large-scaleshocks revealed by the sio map of ic342 are mostly unrelated with starformation and arise instead in a pre-starburst phase. shocks are driven bycloud-cloud collisions along the potential well of the ic342 bar. the generalimplications for the current understanding of galaxy evolution are discussed.

astro-ph;0510542	hcn j=5-4 emission in apm08279+5255 at z=3.91	we detect hcn j=5-4 emission from the ultraluminous quasar apm08279+5255 atz=3.911 using the iram plateau de bure interferometer. this object is stronglygravitationally lensed, yet still thought to be one of the most intrinsicallyluminous objects in the universe. the new data imply a line luminosityl'_hcn(j=5-4) = 4.0+/-0.5 x 10^(10) k km/s pc^2. the ~440 km/s full width halfmaximum of the hcn j=5-4 line matches that of the previously observed high-j colines in this object and suggests that the emission from both species emergesfrom the same region: a warm, dense circumnuclear disk. simple radiativetransfer models suggest an enhanced abundance of hcn relative to co in thenuclear region of apm08279+5255, perhaps due to increased ionization, orpossibly the selective depletion of oxygen. the ratio of far-infraredluminosity to hcn luminosity is at the high end of the range found for nearbystar forming galaxies, but comparable to that observed in the few high redshiftobjects detected in the hcn j=1-0 line. this is the first clear detection ofhigh-j hcn emission redshifted into the 3-millimeter atmospheric window.

[ci] observations are consistent with c-typenon-dissociative shocks. mapping of the high-velocity molecular bullets b1-b3located beyond the optical jet, with the pdbi, reveals small structures of 3"by 7" flattened perpendicular to the flow direction. they are made of cold gasof moderate density(a few 10^3 cm-3). the bullets appear to expand into thelow-density surrounding medium. we conclude that they are probably shocked gasknots resulting from past time-variable ejections in the jet.

astro-ph;0701403	molecular gas in nuclei of galaxies (nuga): vi. detection of a molecular  gas disk/torus via hcn in the seyfert2 galaxy ngc6951?	several studies of nearby active galaxies indicate significantly higherhcn-to-co intensity ratios in agn than in starburst (sb) environments. hcnenhancement can be caused by many different effects, such as higher gasdensities/temperatures, uv/x-ray radiation, and non-collisional excitation. asactive galaxies often exhibit intense circumnuclear sb, high angularresolution/sensitivity observations are of paramount importance todisentangling the influence of sb from that of nuclear activity on thechemistry of the surrounding molecular gas. the tight relation of hcnenhancement and nuclear activity may qualify hcn as an ideal tracer ofmolecular gas close to the agn, providing complementary and additionalinformation to that gained via co. ngc6951 houses nuclear and sb activity,making it an ideal testbed in which to study the effects of differentexcitation conditions on the molecular gas. we used the new abcd configurationsof the iram pdbi to observe hcn(1-0) in ngc6951 at high angular resolution(1''). we detect very compact (&lt;50pc) hcn emission in its nucleus, supportingprevious hints of nuclear gas structure. our observations also reveal hcnemission in the sb ring and resolve it into several peaks, leading to a highercoincidence between the hcn and co distributions than previously reported. wefind a significantly higher hcn-to-co intensity ratio (&gt;0.4) in the nucleusthan in the sb ring (0.02-0.05). as for ngc1068, this might result from ahigher hcn abundance in the centre due to an x-ray dominated gas chemistry, buta higher gas density/temperature or additional non-collisional excitation ofhcn cannot be entirely ruled out, based on these observations. the compact hcnemission is associated with rotating gas in a circumnuclear disk/torus.

astro-ph;9810111	detection of co(4-3), co(9-8), and dust emission in the bal quasar apm  08279+5255 at a redshift of 3.9	we detected with the iram interferometer the lines of co(4-3) and co(9-8)from the recently-discovered broad absorption line quasar apm 08279+5255. themolecular lines are at a redshift of 3.911, which we take to be the truecosmological redshift of the quasar's host galaxy. this means the quasaremission lines at z=3.87 are blueshifted by a kinematic component of -2500km/s, and, along with the broad absorption lines, are probably emitted in thequasar's wind or jet, moving toward us. the co line ratios suggest themolecular gas is at a temperature of about 200 k, at a density of about 4000cm^-3. we also detected the dust emission at 94 and 214 ghz (emittedwavelengths 650 and 290 microns). the spectral index of the mm/submm continuumis +3.2, indicating the dust emission is optically thin in this part of thespectrum. the extremely high co and dust luminosities suggest magnification bygravitational lensing. using the optical extent and our limit on the size ofthe co region, we estimate a magnification of 7 to 30 for the co lines and thefar-ir continuum, and 14 to 60 for the optical/uv. in this interpretation, themolecular gas and dust is in a nuclear disk of radius 90 to 270 pc around thequasar. the quasar is 25 to 100 times stronger than, but otherwise resembles,the nucleus of mrk 231.

astro-ph;9901068	interferometer 12co observations of the box-shaped bulge spiral ngc 4013	the nucleus of the box-shaped galaxy ngc4013 has been observed with the iraminterferometer in the j=1-0 and j=2-1 lines of 12co. our maps show theexistence of a fast--rotating(130 km/s) molecular gas disk of radius r=110pc.several arguments support the existence of a bar potential in ngc4013. thefigure-of-eight pattern of the major axis p-v plot, the ring-like distributionof gas, and the existence of gas emission at non-circular velocities are bestaccounted by a bar. we have also detected gas at high z distances from theplane (z=200-300pc). the latter component is related to a system of 4 halphafilaments of diffuse ionized gas that come out from the nucleus. the galacticfountain model seems the best to account for the halpha and co filaments.although the peanut distortion can be spontaneously formed by a stellar bar inthe disk, gas at high z might have been ejected after a nuclear starburst. thehalpha filaments start in the plane of the disk at r=200pc, and reach severalkpc height at r=600pc, coinciding with the maximum peanut distortion. althougha link between the bar and the box-shaped bulge in ngc4013 is suggested we findnoticeable differences between the results of previous numerical simulationsand the present observations. the discrepancy concerns the parameters of thebar generating the peanut. we see in ngc4013 the existence of a strong ilrregion. the inclusion of a dissipative component, which remains to bethoroughly studied, may change the evolution of the stellar peanut: although insimulations the peanut appears initially near a marginal ilr, the inflow of gasdriven by the bar, can make two ilrs appear.

0810.0832	on the chemistry and distribution of hoc+ in m82: more evidence for  extensive pdrs	the molecular gas composition in the inner 1 kpc disk of the starburst galaxym82 resembles that of galactic photon dominated regions (pdrs). in particular,large abundances of the reactive ions hoc+ and co+ have been measured in thenucleus of this galaxy. to investigate the origin of the large abundances ofreactive ions in m82, we have completed our previous 30m hoc+ j=1-0observations with the higher excitation hco+ and hoc+ j=4-3 and 3-2 rotationallines. in addition, we have obtained with the iram plateau de bureinterferometer (pdbi) a 4" resolution map of the hoc+ 1-0 emission, the firstever obtained in a galactic or extragalactic source. our hoc+ interferometricimage shows that the emission of the hoc+ 1-0 line is mainly restricted to thenuclear disk, with the maxima towards the e. and w. molecular peaks. inaddition, line excitation calculations imply that the hoc+ emission arises indense gas. therefore, the hoc+ emission is arising in the dense pdrs embeddedin the m82 nuclear disk, rather than in the intercloud phase and/or wind. wehave improved our previous chemical model of m82 by (i) using the new versionof the meudon pdr code, (ii) updating the chemical network, and (iii)considering two different types of clouds (with different thickness). mostmolecular observations (hco+, hoc+, co+, cn, hcn, h3o+) are well explainedassuming that ~ 87 % of the mass of the molecular gas is forming small clouds(av=5 mag) while only ~ 13 % of the mass is in large molecular clouds (av=50mag). such small number of large molecular clouds suggests that m82 is an oldstarburst, where star formation has almost exhausted the molecular gasreservoir.

0812.1636	circumstellar disks around herbig be stars	we completed a search for circumstellar disks around herbig be stars usingthe nrao very large array (vla) and the iram plateau de bure (pdb)interferometers. we present our new vla and pdbi data for the three objects mwc297, z cma, and lkha 215. we constructed the sed from near-ir to centimeterwavelengths by adding our millimeter and centimeter data to the available dataat other wavelengths, mainly spitzer images. the entire sed was fitted using adisk+envelope model. in addition, we compiled all the disk millimeterobservations in the literature and completed a statistical analysis of all thedata. we show that the disk mass is usually only a small percentage (less than10%) of the mass of the entire envelope in hbe stars. for the disks, there arelarge source-to-source variations. two disks in our sample, r mon and z cma,have similar sizes and masses to those found in t tauri and herbig ae stars.the disks around mwc 1080 and mwc 297 are, however, smaller (rout&lt;100 au). wedid not detect the disks towards mwc 137 and lkha 215 at millimeterwavelengths, which limits the mass and the size of the possible circumstellardisks. a comparison between our data and previous results for t tauri andherbig ae stars indicates that although massive disks (0.1 msun) are found inyoung objects (10^4 yr), the masses of the disks around herbig be stars areusually 5-10 times lower than those around lower mass stars. we propose thatdisk photoevaporation is responsible for this behavior. in herbig be stars, theuv radiation disperses the gas in the outer disk on a timescale of a few 10^5yr. once the outer part of the disk has vanished, the entire gaseous disk isphotoevaporated on a very short timescale (10^5 yr) and only a small, dustydisk consisting of large grains remains.

0812.3409	new co detections of lensed submillimeter galaxies in a2218: probing  molecular gas in the lirg regime at high redshift	context: submillimeter galaxies (smgs) are distant, dusty galaxies undergoingstar formation at prodigious rates. recently there has been major progress inunderstanding the nature of the bright smgs (i.e. s(850um)&gt;5mjy). the samplesfor the fainter smgs are small and are currently in a phase of being built upthrough identification studies. aims: we study the molecular gas content in twosmgs, smmj163555 and smmj163541, at z=1.034 and z=3.187 with unlensed submmfluxes of 0.4mjy and 6.0mjy. both smgs are gravitationally lensed by theforeground cluster a2218. methods: iram plateau de bure interferometryobservations at 3mm were obtained for the lines co(2-1) for smmj163555 andco(3-2) for smmj163541. additionally we obtained co(4-3) for the candidatez=4.048 smmj163556 with an unlensed submm flux of 2.7mjy. results: co(2-1) wasdetected for smmj163555 at z=1.0313 with an integrated line intensity of1.2+-0.2jy km/s and a line width of 410+-120 km/s. from this a gas mass of1.6x10^9 msun is derived and a star formation efficiency of 440lsun/msun isestimated. co(3-2) was detected for smmj163541 at z=3.1824, possibly with asecond component at z=3.1883, with an integrated line intensity of 1.0+-0.1 jykm/s and a line width of 280+-50 km/s. from this a gas mass of 2.2x10^10 msunis derived and a star formation efficiency of 1000 lsun/msun is estimated. forsmmj163556 the co(4-3) is undetected within the redshift range 4.035-4.082 downto a sensitivity of 0.15 jy km/s. conclusions: our co line observations confirmthe optical redshifts for smmj163555 and smmj163541. the co line luminosityl'_co for both galaxies is consistent with the l_fir-l'_co relation. smmj163555has the lowest fir luminosity of all smgs with a known redshift and is one ofthe few high redshift lirgs whose properties can be estimated prior to alma.
