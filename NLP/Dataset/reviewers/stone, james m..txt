0706.3715	faraday rotation in global accretion disk simulations: implications for  sgr a*	these faraday rotation calculations of hot, thick accretion flows aremotivated by the measured steady rotation measure (rm) of $\approx -6 \times10^5$ rad m$^{-2}$ from sgr a*. in our numerical simulations, the quasi-steadystate structure of the accretion flow, and the rm it produces, depends on theinitial magnetic field. in spite of this dependence, we can draw several robustconclusions about faraday rotation produced by geometrically thick accretiondisks: i) the time averaged rm does not depend that sensitively on the viewingangle, but the stability of the rm can. equatorial viewing angles showsignificant variability in rm (including sign reversals), while polar viewingangles are relatively stable if there is a large scale magnetic field threadingthe disk at large radii. ii) most of the rm is produced at small radii forpolar viewing angles while all radii contribute significantly near the midplaneof the disk. our simulations confirm previous analytic arguments that theaccretion rate onto sgr a* must satisfy $\dot m_{\rm in} \ll \dot m_{\rm bondi}\sim 10^{-5} \mpy$ in order to not over-produce the measured rm. we argue thatthe steady rm $\approx -6 \times 10^5$ rad m$^{-2}$ from sgr a* has twoplausible explanations: 1) it is produced at $\sim 100$ schwarzschild radii,requires $\dot{m}_{\rm in} \approx 3 \times 10^{-8} m_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, and weview the flow at an angle of $\sim 30^\circ$ relative to the rotation axis ofthe disk; in our simulations, the variation in rm across a finite-sized sourceis sufficient to depolarize the emission below $\approx$ 100 ghz, consistentwith observations. 2) alternatively, the rm may be produced in the relativelyspherical inflowing plasma near the circularization radius at $\sim 10^3-10^4$schwarzschild radii.

0906.4422	turbulent resistivity driven by the magnetorotational instability	we measure the turbulent resistivity in the nonlinear regime of the mri, andevaluate the turbulent magnetic prandtl number. we perform a set of numericalsimulations with the eulerian finite volume codes athena and ramses in theframework of the shearing box model. we consider models including explicitdissipation coefficients and magnetic field topologies such that the netmagnetic flux threading the box in both the vertical and azimuthal directionsvanishes. we first demonstrate good agreement between the two codes bycomparing the properties of the turbulent states in simulations havingidentical microscopic diffusion coefficients (viscosity and resistivity). wefind the properties of the turbulence do not change when the box size isincreased in the radial direction, provided it is elongated in the azimuthaldirection. to measure the turbulent resistivity in the disk, we impose a fixedelectromotive force on the flow and measure the amplitude of the saturatedmagnetic field that results. we obtain a turbulent resistivity that is in roughagreement with mean field theories like the second order smoothingapproximation. the numerical value translates into a turbulent magnetic prandtlnumber pm_t of order unity. pm_t appears to be an increasing function of theforcing we impose. it also becomes smaller as the box size is increased in theradial direction, in good agreement with previous results obtained in verylarge boxes. our results are in general agreement with other recently publishedpapers studying the same problem but using different methodology. thus, ourconclusion that pm_t is of order unity appears robust.

0707.1022	nonlinear evolution of the magnetohydrodynamic rayleigh-taylor  instability	we study the nonlinear evolution of the magnetic rayleigh-taylor instabilityusing three-dimensional mhd simulations. we consider the idealized case of twoinviscid, perfectly conducting fluids of constant density separated by acontact discontinuity perpendicular to the effective gravity g, with a uniformmagnetic field b parallel to the interface. modes parallel to the field withwavelengths smaller than l_c = [b b/(d_h - d_l) g] are suppressed (where d_hand d_l are the densities of the heavy and light fluids respectively), whereasmodes perpendicular to b are unaffected. we study strong fields with l_cvarying between 0.01 and 0.36 of the horizontal extent of the computationaldomain. even a weak field produces tension forces on small scales that aresignificant enough to reduce shear (as measured by the distribution of theamplitude of vorticity), which in turn reduces the mixing between fluids, andincreases the rate at which bubbles and finger are displaced from the interfacecompared to the purely hydrodynamic case. for strong fields, the highlyanisotropic nature of unstable modes produces ropes and filaments. however, atlate time flow along field lines produces large scale bubbles. the kinetic andmagnetic energies transverse to gravity remain in rough equipartition andincrease as t^4 at early times. the growth deviates from this form once themagnetic energy in the vertical field becomes larger than the energy in theinitial field. we comment on the implications of our results to z-pinchexperiments, and a variety of astrophysical systems.

1005.4980	particle-gas dynamics with athena: method and convergence	the athena mhd code has been extended to integrates the motion of particlescoupled with the gas via aerodynamic drag, in order to study the dynamics ofgas and solids in protoplanetary disks and the formation of planetesimals. ourparticle-gas hybrid scheme is based on a second order predictor-correctormethod. careful treatment of the momentum feedback on the gas guarantees exactconservation. the hybrid scheme is stable and convergent in most regimesrelevant to protoplanetary disks. we describe a semi-implicit integratorgeneralized from the leap-frog approach. in the absence of drag force, itpreserves the geometric properties of a particle orbit. we also present afully-implicit integrator that is unconditionally stable for all regimes ofparticle-gas coupling. using our hybrid code, we study the numericalconvergence of the non-linear saturated state of the streaming instability. wefind that gas flow properties are well converged with modest grid resolution(128 cells per pressure length \eta r for dimensionless stopping timetau_s=0.1), and equal number of particles and grid cells. on the other hand,particle clumping properties converge only at higher resolutions, and finerresolution leads to stronger clumping before convergence is reached. finally,we find that measurement of particle transport properties resulted from thestreaming instability may be subject to error of about 20%.

1005.4982	dynamics of solids in the midplane of protoplanetary disks: implications  for planetesimal formation	(abridged) we present local 2d and 3d hybrid numerical simulations ofparticles and gas in the midplane of protoplanetary disks (ppds) using theathena code. the particles are coupled to gas aerodynamically, withparticle-to-gas feedback included. magnetorotational turbulence is ignored asan approximation for the dead zone of ppds, and we ignore particle self-gravityto study the precursor of planetesimal formation. our simulations include awide size distribution of particles, ranging from strongly coupled particleswith dimensionless stopping time tau_s=omega t_stop=1e-4 to marginally coupledones with tau_s=1 (where omega is the orbital frequency, t_stop is the particlefriction time), and a wide range of solid abundances. our main results are: 1.particles with tau_s&gt;=0.01 actively participate in the streaming instability,generate turbulence and maintain the height of the particle layer beforekelvin-helmholtz instability is triggered. 2. strong particle clumping as aconsequence of the streaming instability occurs when a substantial fraction ofthe solids are large (tau_s&gt;=0.01) and when height-integrated solid to gas massratio z is super-solar. 3. the radial drift velocity is reduced relative to theconventional nakagawa-sekiya-hayashi (nsh) model, especially at high z. wederive a generalized nsh equilibrium solution for multiple particle specieswhich fits our results very well. 4. collision velocity between particles withtau_s&gt;=0.01 is dominated by differential radial drift, and is strongly reducedat larger z. 5. there exist two positive feedback loops with respect to theenrichment of local disk solid abundance and grain growth. all these effectspromote planetesimal formation.

1006.0139	implementation of the shearing box approximation in athena	we describe the implementation of the shearing box approximation for thestudy of the dynamics of accretion disks in the athena magnetohydrodynamics(mhd) code. second-order crank-nicholson time differencing is used for thecoriolis and tidal gravity source terms that appear in the momentum equationfor accuracy and stability. we show this approach conserves energy forepicyclic oscillations in hydrodynamic flows to round-off error. in the energyequation, the tidal gravity source terms are differenced as the gradient of aneffective potential in a way which guarantees that total energy (including thegravitational potential energy) is also conserved to round-off error. weintroduce an orbital advection algorithm for mhd based on constrained transportto preserve the divergence-free constraint on the magnetic field. thisalgorithm removes the orbital velocity from the time step constraint, and makesthe truncation error more uniform in radial position. modifications to theshearing box boundary conditions applied at the radial boundaries are necessaryto conserve the total vertical magnetic flux. in principle similar correctionsare also required to conserve mass, momentum and energy, however in practice wefind the orbital advection method conserves these quantities to better than0.03% over hundreds of orbits. the algorithms have been applied to studies ofthe nonlinear regime of the mri in very wide (up to 32 scale heights)horizontal domains.

1101.3573	a second order godunov method for multidimensional relativistic  magnetohydrodynamics	we describe a new godunov algorithm for relativistic magnetohydrodynamics(rmhd) that combines a simple, unsplit second order accurate integrator withthe constrained transport (ct) method for enforcing the solenoidal constrainton the magnetic field. a variety of approximate riemann solvers are implementedto compute the fluxes of the conserved variables. the methods are tested with acomprehensive suite of multidimensional problems. these tests have helped usdevelop a hierarchy of correction steps that are applied when the integrationalgorithm predicts unphysical states due to errors in the fluxes, or errors inthe inversion between conserved and primitive variables. although usedexceedingly rarely, these corrections dramatically improve the stability of thealgorithm. we present preliminary results from the application of thesealgorithms to two problems in rmhd: the propagation of supersonic magnetizedjets, and the amplification of magnetic field by turbulence driven by therelativistic kelvin-helmholtz instability (khi). both of these applicationsreveal important differences between the results computed with riemann solversthat adopt different approximations for the fluxes. for example, we show thatuse of riemann solvers which include both contact and rotationaldiscontinuities can increase the strength of the magnetic field within thecocoon by a factor of ten in simulations of rmhd jets, and can increase thespectral resolution of three-dimensional rmhd turbulence driven by the khi by afactor of 2. this increase in accuracy far outweighs the associated increase incomputational cost. our rmhd scheme is publicly available as part of the athenacode.

1103.1380	effect of ambipolar diffusion on the non-linear evolution of  magnetorotational instability in weakly ionized disks	we study the role of ambipolar diffusion (ad) on the non-linear evolution ofthe mri in protoplanetary disks using the strong coupling limit, which applieswhen the electron recombination time is much shorter than the orbital time. theeffect of ad in this limit is characterized by the dimensionless number am, thefrequency of which neutral particles collide with ions normalized to theorbital frequency. we perform three-dimensional unstratified shearing-boxsimulations of the mri over a wide range of am as well as different magneticfield strengths and geometries. the saturation level of the mri turbulencedepends on the magnetic geometry and increases with the net magnetic flux.there is an upper limit to the net flux for sustained turbulence, correspondingto the requirement that the most unstable vertical wavelength be less than thedisk scale height. correspondingly, at a given am, there exists a maximum valueof the turbulent stress alpha_max. for am&lt;1, the largest stress is associatedwith a field geometry that has both net vertical and toroidal flux. in thiscase, we confirm the results of linear analyses that show the fastest growingmode has a non-zero radial wave number with growth rate exceeding the purevertical field case. we find there is a very tight correlation between theturbulent stress (alpha) and the plasma beta=p_gas/p_mag~1/(2alpha) at thesaturated state of the mri turbulence regardless of field geometry, andalpha_max rapidly decreases with decreasing am. in particular, we quotealpha_max~0.007 for am=1 and alpha_max~0.0006 for am=0.1.

1106.4019	global simulations of accretion disks i: convergence and comparisons  with local models	grid-based magnetohydrodynamic (mhd) simulations have proven invaluable forthe study of astrophysical accretion disks. however, the fact that angularmomentum transport in disks is mediated by mhd turbulence (with structure downto very small scales) raises the concern that the properties of the modeledaccretion disks are affected by the finite numerical resolution of thesimulation. by implementing an orbital advection algorithm into the athena codein cylindrical geometry, we have performed a set of global (but unstratified)newtonian disk simulations extending up to resolutions previously unattained.we study the convergence of these models as a function of spatial resolutionand initial magnetic field geometry. the usual viscosity parameter ($\alpha$)or the ratio of thermal-to-magnetic pressure ($\beta$) are found to be poordiagnostics of convergence, whereas the average tilt angle of the magneticfield in the $(r,\phi)$-plane is a very good diagnostic of convergence. wesuggest that this is related to the saturation of the mhd turbulence viaparasitic modes of the magnetorotational instability. even in the case ofzero-net magnetic flux, we conclude that our highest resolution simulations(with 32-zones and 64-zones per vertical scale height) have achievedconvergence.  our global simulations reach resolutions comparable to those used in local,shearing box models of mhd disk turbulence. we find that the saturationpredictors derived from local simulations correspond well to the instantaneouscorrelations between local flux and stress found in our global simulations.however, the conservation of magnetic flux implicit in local models is notrealized in our global disks. thus, the magnetic connectivity of an accretiondisk represents physics that is truly global and cannot be captured in anyab-initio local model.

1109.1557	density waves excited by low-mass planets in protoplanetary disks i:  linear regime	density waves excited by planets embedded in protoplanetary disks play acentral role in planetary migration and gap opening processes. we carry out 2dshearing sheet simulations to study the linear regime of wave evolution withthe grid-based code athena, and provide detailed comparisons with thetheoretical predictions. low mass planets (down to ~0.03 earth mass at 1 au)and high spatial resolution (256 grid points per scale height) are chosen tomitigate the effects of wave nonlinearity. to complement the existing numericalstudies, we focus on the primary physical variables such as the spatial profileof the wave, torque density, and the angular momentum flux carried by the wave,instead of secondary quantities such as the planetary migration rate. ourresults show percent level agreement with theory in both physical and fourierspace. new phenomena such as the change of the toque density sign far from theplanet are discovered and discussed. also, we explore the effect of thenumerical algorithms, and find that a high order of accuracy, high resolution,and an accurate planetary potential are crucial to achieve good agreement withthe theory. we find that the use of a too large time-step without properlyresolving the dynamical time scale around the planet produces incorrectresults, and may lead to spurious gap opening. global simulations of planetmigration and gap opening violating this requirement may be affected byspurious effects resulting in e.g. the incorrect planetary migration rate andgap opening mass.

1109.2590	density waves excited by low-mass planets in protoplanetary disks ii:  high-resolution simulations of the nonlinear regime	we investigate numerically the propagation of density waves excited by alow-mass planet in a protoplanetary disk in the nonlinear regime, using 2dlocal shearing box simulations with the grid-based code athena at high spatialresolution (256 grid points per scale height h). the nonlinear evolutionresults in the wave steepening into a shock, causing damping and angularmomentum transfer to the disk. on long timescales this leads to spatialredistribution of the disk density, causing migration feedback and potentiallyresulting in gap opening. previous numerical studies concentrated on exploringthese secondary phenomena as probes of the nonlinear wave evolution. here wefocus on exploring the evolution of the basic wave properties, such as itsdensity profile evolution, shock formation, post-shock wave behavior, andprovide comparison with analytical theory. the generation of potentialvorticity at the shock is computed analytically and is subsequently verified bysimulations and used to pinpoint the shock location. we confirm the theoreticalrelation between the shocking length and the planet mass (including the effectof the equation of state), and the post-shock decay of the angular momentumflux carried by the wave. the post-shock evolution of the wave profile isexplored, and we quantitatively confirm its convergence to the theoreticallyexpected n-wave shape. the accuracy of various numerical algorithms used tocompute the nonlinear wave evolution is also investigated: we find that higherorder spatial reconstruction and high resolution are crucial for capturing theshock formation correctly.

1112.4841	the effect of anisotropic conduction on the thermal instability in the  interstellar medium	thermal instability (ti) can strongly affect the structure and dynamics ofthe interstellar medium (ism) in the milky way and other disk galaxies. thermalconduction plays an important role in the ti by stabilizing small scales andlimiting the size of the smallest condensates. in the magnetized ism, however,heat is conducted anisotropically (primarily along magnetic field lines). weinvestigate the effects of anisotropic thermal conduction on the nonlinearregime of the ti by performing two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations.we present models with magnetic fields of different initial geometries andstrengths, and compare them to hydrodynamic models with isotropic conduction.we find anisotropic conduction does not significantly alter the overall densityand temperature statistics in the saturated state of the ti. however, it canstrongly affect the shapes and sizes of cold clouds formed by the ti. forexample, for uniform initial fields long filaments of cold gas are producedthat are reminiscent of some observed hi clouds. for initially tangled fields,such filaments are not produced. we also show that anisotropic conductionsuppresses turbulence generated by evaporative flows from the surfaces of coldblobs, which may have implications for mechanisms for driving turbulence in theism.

1112.6055	central regions of barred galaxies: two-dimensional non-self-gravitating  hydrodynamic simulations	the inner regions of barred galaxies contain substructures such as off-axisshocks, nuclear rings, and nuclear spirals. these substructure may affect starformation, and control the activity of a central black hole (bh) by determiningthe mass inflow rate. we investigate the formation and properties of suchsubstructures using high-resolution, grid-based hydrodynamic simulations. thegaseous medium is assumed to be infinitesimally-thin, isothermal, andnon-self-gravitating. the stars and dark matter are represented by a staticgravitational potential with four components: a stellar disk, the bulge, acentral bh, and the bar. to investigate various galactic environments, we varythe gas sound speed c_s as well as the mass of the central bh m_bh. once theflow has reached a quasi-steady state, off-axis shocks tend to move closer tothe bar major axis as c_s increases. nuclear rings shrink in size withincreasing c_s, but are independent of m_bh, suggesting that ring position isnot determined by the lindblad resonances. rings in low-c_s models are narrowsince they are occupied largely by gas on x2-orbits and well decoupled fromnuclear spirals, while they become broad because of large thermal perturbationsin high-c_s models. nuclear spirals persist only when either c_s is small orm_bh is large; they would otherwise be destroyed completely by the ringmaterial on eccentric orbits. the shape and strength of nuclear spirals dependsensitively on c_s and m_bh such that they are leading if both c_s and m_bh aresmall, weak trailing if c_s is small and m_bh is large, and strong trailing ifboth c_s and m_bh are large. while the mass inflow rate toward the nucleus isquite small in low-c_s models because of the presence of a narrow nuclear ring,it becomes larger than 0.01 msun/yr when c_s is large, providing a potentialexplanation of nuclear activity in seyfert galaxies.

1201.2222	a radiation transfer solver for athena using short characteristics	we describe the implementation of a module for the athenamagnetohydrodynamics (mhd) code which solves the time-independent,multi-frequency radiative transfer (rt) equation on multidimensional cartesiansimulation domains, including scattering and non-lte effects. the module isbased on well-known and well-tested algorithms developed for modeling stellaratmospheres, including the method of short characteristics to solve the rtequation, accelerated lambda iteration to handle scattering and non-lteeffects, and parallelization via domain decomposition. the module servesseveral purposes: it can be used to generate spectra and images, to compute avariable eddington tensor (vet) for full radiation mhd simulations, and tocalculate the heating and cooling source terms in the mhd equations in flowswhere radiation pressure is small compared with gas pressure. for the lattercase, the module is combined with the standard mhd integrators usingoperator-splitting and we describe this approach in detail. implementation ofthe vet method for radiation pressure dominated flows is described in acompanion paper. we present results from a suite of test problems for both thert solver itself, and for dynamical problems that include radiative heating andcooling. these tests demonstrate that the radiative transfer solution isaccurate, and confirm that the operator split method is stable, convergent, andefficient for problems of interest. we demonstrate there is no need to adoptad-hoc assumptions of questionable accuracy to solve rt problems in concertwith mhd: the computational cost for our general-purpose module for simple(e.g. lte grey) problems can be comparable to or less than a single timestep ofathena's mhd integrators, and only few times more expensive than that for moregeneral problems.

1201.2223	a godunov method for multidimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamics  based on a variable eddington tensor	we describe a numerical algorithm to integrate the equations of radiationmagnetohydrodynamics in multidimensions using godunov methods. this algorithmsolves the radiation moment equations in the mixed frame, without invoking anydiffusion-like approximations. the moment equations are closed using a variableeddington tensor whose components are calculated from a formal solution of thetransfer equation at a large number of angles using the method of shortcharacteristics. we use a comprehensive test suite to verify the algorithm,including convergence tests of radiation-modified linear acoustic andmagnetosonic waves, the structure of radiation modified shocks, andtwo-dimensional tests of photon bubble instability and the ablation of denseclouds by an intense radiation field. these tests cover a very wide range ofregimes, including both optically thick and thin flows, and ratios of theradiation to gas pressure of at least 10^{-4} to 10^{4}. across most of theparameter space, we find the method is accurate. however, the tests also revealthere are regimes where the method needs improvement, for example when both theradiation pressure and absorption opacity are very large. we suggestmodifications to the algorithm that will improve accuracy in this case. wediscuss the advantages of this method over those based on flux-limiteddiffusion. in particular, we find the method is not only substantially moreaccurate, but often no more expensive than the diffusion approximation for ourintended applications.

1202.3442	buoyancy instabilities in a weakly collisional intracluster medium	the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters is a weakly collisional, high-betaplasma in which the transport of heat and momentum occurs primarily alongmagnetic-field lines. anisotropic heat conduction allows convectiveinstabilities to be driven by temperature gradients of either sign, themagnetothermal instability (mti) in the outskirts of non-isothermal clustersand the heat-flux buoyancy-driven instability (hbi) in their cooling cores. weemploy the athena mhd code to investigate the nonlinear evolution of theseinstabilities, self-consistently including the effects of anisotropic viscosity(i.e. braginskii pressure anisotropy), anisotropic conduction, and radiativecooling. we highlight the importance of the microscale instabilities thatinevitably accompany and regulate the pressure anisotropies generated by thehbi and mti. we find that, in all but the innermost regions of cool-coreclusters, anisotropic viscosity significantly impairs the ability of the hbi toreorient magnetic-field lines orthogonal to the temperature gradient. thus,while radio-mode feedback appears necessary in the central few tens of kpc,conduction may be capable of offsetting radiative losses throughout most of acool core over a significant fraction of the hubble time. magnetically-alignedcold filaments are then able to form by local thermal instability. viscousdissipation during the formation of a cold filament produces accompanying hotfilaments, which can be searched for in deep chandra observations of nearbycool-core clusters. in the case of the mti, anisotropic viscosity maintains thecoherence of magnetic-field lines over larger distances than in the inviscidcase, providing a natural lower limit for the scale on which the field canfluctuate freely. in the nonlinear state, the magnetic field exhibits a foldedstructure in which the field-line curvature and field strength areanti-correlated.

1204.0073	two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of barred galaxies	barred galaxies are known to possess magnetic fields that may affect theproperties of bar substructures such as dust lanes and nuclear rings. we usetwo-dimensional high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic (mhd) simulations toinvestigate the effects of magnetic fields on the formation and evolution ofsuch substructures as well as on the mass inflow rates to the galaxy center.the gaseous medium is assumed to be infinitesimally-thin, isothermal,non-self-gravitating, and threaded by initially uniform, azimuthal magneticfields. we find that there exists an outermost x1-orbit relative to whichgaseous responses to an imposed stellar bar potential are completely differentbetween inside and outside. inside this orbit, gas is shocked into dust lanesand infalls to form a nuclear ring. magnetic fields are compressed in dustlanes, reducing their peak density. magnetic stress removes further angularmomentum of the gas at the shocks, temporarily causing the dust lanes to bendinto an 'l' shape and eventually leading to a smaller and more centrallydistributed ring than in unmagnetized models. the mass inflow rates inmagnetized models correspondingly become larger, by more than two orders ofmagnitude when the initial fields have an equipartition value with thermalenergy, than in the unmagnetized counterparts. outside the outermost x1-orbit,on the other hand, an mhd dynamo due to the combined action of the barpotential and background shear operates near the corotation and bar-endregions, efficiently amplifying magnetic fields. the amplified fields shapeinto trailing magnetic arms with strong fields and low density. the base of themagnetic arms has a thin layer in which magnetic fields with opposite polarityreconnect via a tearing-mode instability. this produces numerous magneticislands with large density which propagate along the arms to turn the outerdisk into a highly chaotic state.

1205.4009	angular momentum transport and variability in boundary layers of  accretion disks driven by global acoustic modes	disk accretion onto a weakly magnetized central object, e.g. a star, isinevitably accompanied by the formation of a boundary layer near the surface,in which matter slows down from the highly supersonic orbital velocity of thedisk to the rotational velocity of the star. we perform high resolution 2dhydrodynamical simulations in the equatorial plane of an astrophysical boundarylayer with the goal of exploring the dynamics of non-axisymmetric structuresthat form there. we generically find that the supersonic shear in the boundarylayer excites non-axisymmetric quasi-stationary acoustic modes that are trappedbetween the surface of the star and a lindblad resonance in the disk. thesemodes rotate in a prograde fashion, are stable for hundreds of orbital periods,and have a pattern speed that is less than and of order the rotational velocityat the inner edge of the disk. the origin of these intrinsically global modesis intimately related to the operation of a corotation amplifier in the system.dissipation of acoustic modes in weak shocks provides a universal mechanism forangular momentum and mass transport even in purely hydrodynamic (i.e.non-magnetized) boundary layers. we discuss the possible implications of thesetrapped modes for explaining the variability seen in accreting compact objects.

1208.1795	a new way to conserve total energy for eulerian hydrodynamic simulations  with self-gravity	we propose a new method to conserve the total energy to round-off error ingrid-based codes for hydrodynamic simulations with self-gravity. a formula forthe energy flux due to the work done by the the self-gravitational force isgiven, so the change in total energy can be written in conservative form.numerical experiments with the code athena show that the total energy is indeedconserved with our new algorithm and the new algorithm is second orderaccurate. we have performed a set of tests that show the numerical errors inthe traditional, non-conservative algorithm can affect the dynamics of thesystem. the new algorithm only requires one extra solution of the poissonequation, as compared to the traditional algorithm which includes self-gravityas a source term. if the poisson solver takes a negligible fraction of thetotal simulation time, such as when ffts are used, the new algorithm is almostas efficient as the original method. this new algorithm is useful in eulerianhydrodynamic simulations with self-gravity, especially when results aresensitive to small energy errors, as for radiation pressure dominated flow.

1209.4358	planet-disk interaction in 3d: the importance of buoyancy waves	we carry out local three dimensional (3d) hydrodynamic simulations ofplanet-disk interaction in stratified disks with varied thermodynamicproperties. we find that whenever the brunt-vaisala frequency (n) in the diskis nonzero, the planet exerts a strong torque on the disk in the vicinity ofthe planet, with a reduction in the traditional "torque cutoff". in particular,this is true for adiabatic perturbations in disks with isothermal densitystructure, as should be typical for centrally irradiated protoplanetary disks.we identify this torque with buoyancy waves, which are excited (when n isnon-zero) close to the planet, within one disk scale height from its orbit.these waves give rise to density perturbations with a characteristic 3d spatialpattern which is in close agreement with the linear dispersion relation forbuoyancy waves. the torque due to these waves can amount to as much as severaltens of per cent of the total planetary torque, which is not expected based onanalytical calculations limited to axisymmetric or low-m modes. buoyancy wavesshould be ubiquitous around planets in the inner, dense regions ofprotoplanetary disks, where they might possibly affect planet migration.

1210.4164	turbulence in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks. i. weak  accretion with no vertical magnetic flux	we use local numerical simulations to investigate the strength and nature ofmagnetohydrodynamic (mhd) turbulence in the outer regions of protoplanetarydisks, where ambipolar diffusion is the dominant non-ideal mhd effect. thesimulations include vertical stratification and assume zero net verticalmagnetic flux. we employ a super time-stepping technique to ameliorate thecourant restriction on the diffusive time step. we find that in idealizedstratified simulations, with a spatially constant ambipolar elsasser number am,turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability (mri) behaves in asimilar manner as in prior unstratified calculations. turbulence dies away foram &lt; 1, and becomes progressively more vigorous as ambipolar diffusion isdecreased. near-ideal mhd behavior is recovered for am &gt; 1000. in theintermediate regime (10 &lt; am &lt; 1000) ambipolar diffusion leads to substantialincreases in both the period of the mri dynamo cycle and the characteristicscales of magnetic field structures. to quantify the impact of ambipolarphysics on disk accretion, we run simulations at 30 au and 100 au that includea vertical am profile based upon far ultraviolet (fuv) ionized disk models.these models develop a vertically layered structure analogous to the ohmic deadzone that is present at smaller radii. we find that, although the levels ofsurface turbulence can be strong (and consistent with constraints on turbulentline widths at these radii), the inferred accretion rates are at least an orderof magnitude smaller than those observed in t tauri stars. this discrepancy isvery likely due to the assumption of zero vertical magnetic field in oursimulations and suggests that vertical magnetic fields are essential formri-driven accretion in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks.

1210.6661	local study of accretion disks with a strong vertical magnetic field:  magnetorotational instability and disk outflow	we perform 3d vertically-stratified local shearing-box ideal mhd simulationsof the magnetorotational instability (mri) that include a net vertical magneticflux, which is characterized by beta_0 (ratio of gas pressure to magneticpressure of the net vertical field at midplane). we have consideredbeta_0=10^2, 10^3 and 10^4 and in the first two cases the most unstable linearmri modes are well resolved in the simulations. we find that the behavior ofthe mri turbulence strongly depends on beta_0: the radial transport of angularmomentum increases with net vertical flux, achieving alpha=0.08 for beta_0=10^4and alpha&gt;1.0 for beta_0=100, where alpha is the shakura-sunyaev parameter. acritical value lies at beta_0=10^3: for beta_0&gt;10^3, the disk consists of a gaspressure dominated midplane and a magnetically dominated corona. the turbulentstrength increases with net flux, and angular momentum transport is dominatedby turbulent fluctuations. the magnetic dynamo that leads to cyclic flips oflarge-scale fields still exists, but becomes more sporadic as net fluxincreases. for beta_0&lt;10^3, the entire disk becomes magnetic dominated. theturbulent strength saturates, and the magnetic dynamo is quenched. strongerlarge-scale fields are generated with increasing net flux, which dominatesangular momentum transport. a strong outflow is launched from the disk by themagnetocentrifugal mechanism, and the mass flux increases linearly with netvertical flux and shows sign of saturation at beta_0=10^2. however, the outflowis unlikely to be directly connected to a global wind: for beta_0&gt;10^3, thelarge-scale field has no permanent bending direction due to dynamo activities,while for beta_0&lt;10^3, the outflows from the top and bottom sides of the diskbend towards opposite directions, inconsistent with a physical disk windgeometry. global simulations are needed to address the fate of the outflow.

1212.0580	angular momentum transport by acoustic modes generated in the boundary  layer i: hydrodynamical theory and simulations	the nature of angular momentum transport in the boundary layers of accretiondisks has been one of the central and long-standing issues of accretion disktheory. in this work we demonstrate that acoustic waves excited by supersonicshear in the boundary layer serve as an efficient mechanism of mass, momentumand energy transport at the interface between the disk and the accretingobject. we develop the theory of angular momentum transport by acoustic modesin the boundary layer, and support our findings with 3d hydrodynamicalsimulations, using an isothermal equation of state. our first major result isthe identification of three types of global modes in the boundary layer. wederive dispersion relations for each of these modes that accurately capture thepattern speeds observed in simulations to within a few percent. second, we showthat angular momentum transport in the boundary layer is intrinsicallynonlocal, and is driven by radiation of angular momentum away from the boundarylayer into both the star and the disk. the picture of angular momentumtransport in the boundary layer by waves that can travel large distances beforedissipating and redistributing angular momentum and energy to the disk and staris incompatible with the conventional notion of local transport by turbulentstresses. our results have important implications for semianalytical modelsthat describe the spectral emission from boundary layers.

1301.0318	wind-driven accretion in protoplanetary disks. i: suppression of the  magnetorotational instability and launching of the magnetocentrifugal wind	we perform local, vertically stratified shearing-box mhd simulations ofprotoplanetary disks (ppds) at a fiducial radius of 1 au that take into accountthe effects of both ohmic resistivity and ambipolar diffusion (ad). themagnetic diffusion coefficients are evaluated self-consistently from a look-uptable based on equilibrium chemistry. we first show that the inclusion of addramatically changes the conventional picture of layered accretion. without netvertical magnetic field, the system evolves into a toroidal field dominatedconfiguration with extremely weak turbulence in the far-uv ionization layerthat is far too inefficient to drive rapid accretion. in the presence of a weaknet vertical field (plasma beta~10^5 at midplane), we find that the mri iscompletely suppressed, resulting in a fully laminar flow throughout thevertical extent of the disk. a strong magnetocentrifugal wind is launched thatefficiently carries away disk angular momentum and easily accounts for theobserved accretion rate in ppds. moreover, under a physical disk wind geometry,all the accretion flow proceeds through a strong current layer with thicknessof ~0.3h that is offset from disk midplane with radial velocity of up to 0.4times the sound speed. both ohmic resistivity and ad are essential for thesuppression of the mri and wind launching. the efficiency of wind transportincreases with increasing net vertical magnetic flux and the penetration depthof the fuv ionization. our laminar wind solution has important implications onplanet formation and global evolution of ppds.

1302.3239	low mass planets in protoplanetary disks with net vertical magnetic  fields: the planetary wake and gap opening	we study wakes and gap opening by low mass planets in gaseous protoplanetarydisks threaded by net vertical magnetic fields which drivemagnetohydrodynamical (mhd) turbulence through the magnetorotational instabilty(mri), using three dimensional simulations in the unstratified local shearingbox approximation. the wakes, which are excited by the planets, are damped byshocks similar to the wake damping in inviscid hydrodynamic (hd) disks. angularmomentum deposition by shock damping opens gaps in both mhd turbulent disks andinviscid hd disks even for low mass planets, in contradiction to the "thermalcriterion" for gap opening. to test the "viscous criterion", we compared gapproperties in mri-turbulent disks to those in viscous hd disks having the samestress, and found that the same mass planet opens a significantly deeper andwider gap in net vertical flux mhd disks than in viscous hd disks. thisdifference arises due to the efficient magnetic field transport into the gapregion in mri disks, leading to a larger effective \alpha within the gap. thus,across the gap, the maxwell stress profile is smoother than the gap densityprofile, and a deeper gap is needed for the maxwell stress gradient to balancethe planetary torque density. we also confirmed the large excess torque closeto the planet in mhd disks, and found that long-lived density features (termedzonal flows) produced by the mri can affect planet migration. the comparisonwith previous results from net toroidal flux/zero flux mhd simulationsindicates that the magnetic field geometry plays an important role in the gapopening process. overall, our results suggest that gaps can be commonlyproduced by low mass planets in realistic protoplanetary disks, and caution theuse of a constant \alpha-viscosity to model gaps in protoplanetary disks.

1303.1823	saturation of the mri in strongly radiation dominated accretion disks	the saturation level of the magneto-rotational instability (mri) in astrongly radiation dominated accretion disk is studied using a new godunovradiation mhd code in the unstratified shearing box approximation. sincevertical gravity is neglected in this work, our focus is on how the mrisaturates in the optically thick mid-plane of the disk. we confirm thatturbulence generated by the mri is very compressible in the radiation dominatedregime, as found by previous calculations using the flux-limited diffusionapproximation. we also find little difference in the saturation properties incalculations that use a larger horizontal domain (up to four times the verticalscale height in the radial direction). however, in strongly radiation pressuredominated disks (one in which the radiation energy density reaches 1% of therest mass energy density of the gas), we find maxwell stress from the mriturbulence is larger than the value produced when radiation pressure isreplaced with the same amount of gas pressure. at the same time, the ratiobetween maxwell stress and reynolds stress is increased by almost a factor of 8compared with the gas pressure dominated case. we suggest that this effect iscaused by radiation drag, which acts like bulk viscosity and changes theeffective magnetic prandtl number of the fluid. radiation viscositysignificantly exceeds both the microscopic plasma viscosity and resistivity,ensuring that radiation dominated systems occupy the high magnetic prandtlnumber regime. nevertheless, we find radiative shear viscosity is negligiblecompared to the maxwell and reynolds stress in the flow. this may haveimportant implications for the structure of radiation dominated accretiondisks.

1306.3222	turbulence in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks. ii. strong  accretion driven by a vertical magnetic field	we carry out a series of local, vertically stratified shearing boxsimulations of protoplanetary disks that include ambipolar diffusion and a netvertical magnetic field. the ambipolar diffusion profiles we employ correspondto 30au and 100au in a minimum mass solar nebula (mmsn) disk model, whichconsists of a far-uv-ionized surface layer and low-ionization disk interior.these simulations serve as a follow up to simon et al. (2013), in which wefound that without a net vertical field, the turbulent stresses that resultfrom the magnetorotational instability (mri) are too weak to account forobserved accretion rates. the simulations in this work show a very strongdependence of the accretion stresses on the strength of the background verticalfield; as the field strength increases, the stress amplitude increases. for gasto magnetic pressure ratios of 1e4 and 1e5, we find accretion rates between1e-8 and 1e-7 solar masses per year. these accretion rates agree withobservational constraints, suggesting a vertical magnetic field strengthbetween 60 and 200 microgauss at 30au and 10 and 30 microgauss at 100au in ammsn disk. furthermore, the stress has a non-negligible component due to amagnetic wind. for sufficiently strong vertical field strengths, mri turbulenceis quenched, and the flow becomes largely laminar, with accretion proceedingthrough large scale correlations in the radial and toroidal field components aswell as through the magnetic wind. in all simulations, the presence of a lowionization region near the disk mid-plane, which we call the ambipolar dampingzone, results in reduced stresses there.

1308.0648	particle concentration at planet induced gap edges and vortices: i.  inviscid 3-d hydro disks	we perform a systematic study of the dynamics of dust particles inprotoplanetary disks with embedded planets using global 2-d and 3-d inviscidhydrodynamic simulations. lagrangian particles have been implemented intomagnetohydrodynamic code athena with cylindrical coordinates. we find twodistinct outcomes depending on the mass of the embedded planet. in the presenceof a low mass planet ($8 m_{\oplus}$), two narrow gaps start to open in the gason each side of the planet where the density waves shock. these shallow gapscan dramatically affect particle drift speed and cause significant, roughlyaxisymmetric dust depletion. on the other hand, a more massive planet ($&gt;0.1m_{j}$) carves out a deeper gap with sharp edges, which are unstable to thevortex formation. particles with a wide range of sizes ($0.02&lt;\omega t_{s}&lt;20$)are trapped and settle to the midplane in the vortex, with the strongestconcentration for particles with $\omega t_{s}\sim 1$. the dust concentrationis highly elongated in the $\phi$ direction, and can be as wide as 4 disk scaleheights in the radial direction. dust surface density inside the vortex can beincreased by more than a factor of 10$^2$ in a very non-axisymmetric fashion.for very big particles ($\omega t_{s}\gg 1$) we find strong eccentricityexcitation, in particular around the planet and in the vicinity of the meanmotion resonances, facilitating gap opening there. our results imply that inweakly turbulent protoplanetary disk regions (e.g. the "dead zone") dustparticles with a very wide range of sizes can be trapped at gap edges andinside vortices induced by planets with $m_{p}&lt;m_{j}$, potentially acceleratingplanetesimal and planet formation there, and giving rise to distinctivefeatures that can be probed by alma and evla.

0801.3646	kinematics of solid particles in a turbulent protoplanetary disc	we perform numerical simulations of solid particle motion in a shearing boxmodel of a protoplanetary disc. the accretion flow is turbulent due to theaction of the magnetorotational instability. aerodynamic drag on the particlesis modelled using the epstein law with the gas velocity interpolated to theparticle position. the effect of the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence on particlevelocity dispersions is quantified for solids of different stopping times t_s,or equivalently, different sizes. the anisotropy of the turbulence is reflectedupon the dispersions of the particle velocity components, with the radialcomponent larger than both the azimuthal and vertical components for particleslarger than ~ 10 cm (assuming minimum-mass solar nebula conditions at 5 au).the dispersion of the particle velocity magnitude, as well as that of theradial and azimuthal components, as functions of stopping time, agree withprevious analytical results for isotropic turbulence. the relative speedbetween pairs of particles with the same value of t_s decays faster withdecreasing separation than in the case of solids with different stopping time.correlations in the particle number density introduce a non-uniform spatialdistribution of solids in the 10 to 100 cm size range. any clump of particlesis disrupted by the turbulence in less than one tenth on an orbital period, andthe maximally concentrated clumps are stable against self-gravitationalcollapse.

0802.2708	the magnetohydrodynamics of shock-cloud interaction in three dimensions	the magnetohydrodynamic evolution of a dense spherical cloud as it interactswith a strong planar shock is studied, as a model for shock interactions withdensity inhomogeneities in the interstellar medium. the cloud is assumed to besmall enough that radiative cooling, thermal conduction, and self-gravity canbe ignored. a variety of initial orientations (including parallel,perpendicular, and oblique to the incident shock normal) and strengths for themagnetic field are investigated. during the early stages of the interaction(less than twice the time taken for the transmitted shock to cross the interiorof the cloud) the structure and dynamics of the shocked cloud is fairlyinsensitive to the magnetic field strength and orientation. however, at latetimes strong fields substantially alter the dynamics of the cloud, suppressingfragmentation and mixing by stabilizing the interface at the cloud surface.even weak magnetic fields can drastically alter the evolution of the cloudcompared to the hydrodynamic case. weak fields of different geometries resultin different distributions and amplifications of the magnetic energy density,which may affect the thermal and non-thermal x-ray emission expected fromshocked clouds associated with, for example, supernovae remnants.

1402.2979	radiation magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of the formation of hot  accretion disk coronae	a new mechanism to form a magnetic pressure supported, high temperaturecorona above the photosphere of an accretion disk is explored using threedimensional radiation magneto-hydrodynamic (mhd) simulations. the thermalproperties of the disk are calculated self-consistently by balancing radiativecooling through the surfaces of the disk with heating due to dissipation ofturbulence driven by magneto-rotational instability (mri). as has been noted inprevious work, we find the dissipation rate per unit mass increasesdramatically with height above the mid-plane, in stark contrast to thealpha-disk model which assumes this quantity is a constant. thus, we find thatin simulations with a low surface density (and therefore a shallowphotosphere), the fraction of energy dissipated above the photosphere issignificant (about 3.4% in our lowest surface density model), and this fractionincreases as surface density decreases. when a significant fraction of theaccretion energy is dissipated in the optically thin photosphere, the gastemperature increases substantially and a high temperature, magnetic pressuresupported corona is formed. the volume-averaged temperature in the disk coronais more than 10 times larger than at the disk mid-plane. moreover, gastemperature in the corona is strongly anti-correlated with gas density, whichimplies the corona formed by mri turbulence is patchy. this mechanism to forman accretion disk corona may help explain the observed relation between thespectral index and luminosity from agns, and the soft x-ray excess from someagns. it may also be relevant to spectral state changes in x-ray binaries.

1403.1874	radiation feedback in ulirgs: are photons movers and shakers?	we use our variable eddington tensor (vet) radiation hydrodynamics code toperform two-dimensional simulations to study the impact of radiation forces onatmospheres composed of dust and gas. our setup closely follows that ofkrumholz &amp; thompson, assuming that dust and gas are well-coupled and that theradiation field is characterized by blackbodies with temperatures &gt;~ 80 k, asmight be found in ultraluminous infrared galaxies. in agreement with previouswork, we find that rayleigh-taylor instabilities develop in radiation supportedatmospheres, leading to inhomogeneities that limit momentum exchange betweenradiation and dusty gas, and eventually providing a near balance of theradiation and gravitational forces. however, the evolution of the velocity andspatial distributions of the gas differs significantly from previous work,which utilized a less accurate flux-limited diffusion (fld) method. our vetsimulations show continuous net acceleration of the gas, with no steady-statereached by the end of the simulation. in contrast, fld results show little netacceleration of the gas and settle in to a quasi-steady, turbulent state withlow velocity dispersion. the discrepancies result primarily from the inabilityof fld to properly model the variation of the radiation field around structuresthat are less than a few optical depths across. we conclude that radiationfeedback remains a viable mechanism for driving high-mach number turbulence. wediscuss implications for observed systems and global numerical simulations offeedback, but more realistic setups are needed to make robust observationalpredictions and assess the prospect of launching outflows with radiation.

1403.6126	an algorithm for radiation magnetohydrodynamics based on solving the  time-dependent transfer equation	(abridged) we describe a new algorithm for solving the coupledfrequency-integrated transfer equation and the equations ofmagnetohydrodynamics when the light-crossing time is only marginally shorterthan dynamical timescales. the transfer equation is solved in the mixed frame,including velocity dependent source terms accurate to o(v/c). an operator splitapproach is used to compute the specific intensity along discrete rays, withupwind monotonic interpolation used along each ray to update the transportterms, and implicit methods used to compute the scattering and absorptionsource terms. conservative differencing is used for the transport terms, whichensures the specific intensity (as well as energy and momentum) are conservedalong each ray to round-off error. the use of implicit methods for the sourceterms ensures the method is stable even if the source terms are very stiff. tocouple the solution of the transfer equation to the mhd algorithms in theathena code, we perform direct quadrature of the specific intensity over anglesto compute the energy and momentum source terms. we present the results of avariety of tests of the method, such as calculating the structure of a non-lteatmosphere, an advective diffusion test, linear wave convergence tests, and thewell-known shadow test. we use new semi-analytic solutions for radiationmodified shocks to demonstrate the ability of our algorithm to capture theeffects of an anisotropic radiation field accurately. since the method usesexplicit differencing of the spatial operators, it shows excellent weak scalingon parallel computers. the method is ideally suited for problems in whichcharacteristic velocities are non-relativistic, but still within a few percentor more of the speed of light. the method is an intermediate step towardsalgorithms for fully relativistic flows.

1405.2778	dust transport in mri turbulent disks: ideal and non-ideal mhd with  ambipolar diffusion	we study dust transport in turbulent protoplanetary disks usingthree-dimensional global unstratified magnetohydrodynamic (mhd) simulationsincluding lagrangian dust particles. the turbulence is driven by themagnetorotational instability (mri) with either ideal or non-ideal mhd thatincludes ambipolar diffusion (ad). in ideal mhd simulations, the surfacedensity evolution (except for dust that drifts fastest), turbulent diffusion,and vertical scale height of dust can all be reproduced by simpleone-dimensoinal and/or analytical models. however, in ad dominated simulationswhich simulate protoplanetary disks beyond 10s of au, the vertical scale heightof dust is larger than previously predicted. to understand this anomaly in moredetail, we carry out both unstratified and stratified local shearing boxsimulations with lagrangian particles, and find that turbulence in ad dominateddisks has very different properties (e.g., temporal autocorrelation functionsand power spectra) than turbulence in ideal mhd disks, which leads to quitedifferent particle diffusion efficiency. for example, mri turbulence with adhas a longer correlation time for the vertical velocity, which causessignificant vertical particle diffusion and large dust scale height. in idealmhd the schmidt numbers ($sc$) for radial and vertical turbulent diffusion are$sc_{r}\sim 1$ and $sc_{z}\gtrsim 3$, but in the ad dominated regime both$sc_{r}$ and $sc_{z}$ are $\lesssim 1$. particle concentration in pressurebumps induced by mri turbulence has also been studied. since non-ideal mhdeffects dominate most regions in protoplanetary disks, our study suggests thatmodeling dust transport in turbulence driven by mri with non-ideal mhd effectsis important for understanding dust transport in realistic protoplanetarydisks.

1405.2790	dust trapping by vortices in transitional disks: evidence for non-ideal  mhd effects in protoplanetary disks	we study particle trapping at the edge of a gap opened by a planet in aprotoplanetary disk. in particular, we explore the effects of turbulence drivenby the magnetorotational instability on particle trapping, using globalthree-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (mhd) simulations including lagrangiandust particles. we study disks either in the ideal mhd limit or dominated byambipolar diffusion (ad) that plays an essential role at the outer regions of aprotoplanetary disk. with ideal mhd, strong turbulence (the equivalentviscosity parameter $\alpha\sim 10^{-2}$) in disks prevents vortex formation atthe edge of the gap opened by a 9 $m_{j}$ planet, and most particles (exceptthe particles that drift fastest) pile up at the outer gap edge almostaxisymmetrically. when ad is considered, turbulence is significantly suppressed($\alpha\lesssim 10^{-3}$), and a large vortex forms at the edge of the planetinduced gap, which survives $\sim$ 1000 orbits. the vortex can efficiently trapdust particles that span 3 orders of magnitude in size within 100 planetaryorbits. we have also carried out two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulationsusing viscosity as an approximation to mhd turbulence. these hydrodynamicalsimulations can reproduce vortex generation at the gap edge as seen in mhdsimulations. finally, we use our simulation results to generate syntheticimages for alma dust continuum observations on oph irs 48 and hd 142527, whichshow good agreement with existing observations. predictions for future almacycle 2 observations have been made. we conclude that the asymmetry in almaobservations can be explained by dust trapping vortices and the existence ofvortices could be the evidence that the outer protoplanetary disks aredominated by ambipolar diffusion with $\alpha&lt;10^{-3}$ at the disk midplane.

1409.2512	magnetic flux concentration and zonal flows in magnetorotational  instability turbulence	accretion disks are likely threaded by external vertical magnetic flux, whichenhances the level of turbulence via the magnetorotational instability (mri).using shearing-box simulations, we find that such external magnetic flux alsostrongly enhances the amplitude of banded radial density variations known aszonal flows. moreover, we report that vertical magnetic flux is stronglyconcentrated toward low-density regions of the zonal flow. mean verticalmagnetic field can be more than doubled in low-density regions, and reduced tonearly zero in high density regions in some cases. in ideal mhd, the scale onwhich magnetic flux concentrates can reach a few disk scale heights. in thenon-ideal mhd regime with strong ambipolar diffusion, magnetic flux isconcentrated into thin axisymmetric shells at some enhanced level, whose sizeis typically less than half a scale height. we show that magnetic fluxconcentration is closely related to the fact that the magnetic diffusivity ofthe mri turbulence is anisotropic. in addition to a conventional ohmic-liketurbulent resistivity, we find that there is a correlation between the verticalvelocity and horizontal magnetic field fluctuations that produces a meanelectric field that acts to anti-diffuse the vertical magnetic flux. theanisotropic turbulent diffusivity has analogies to the hall effect, and mayhave important implications for magnetic flux transport in accretion disks. thephysical origin of magnetic flux concentration may be related to thedevelopment of channel flows followed by magnetic reconnection, which acts todecrease the mass-to-flux ratio in localized regions. the association ofenhanced zonal flows with magnetic flux concentration may lead to globalpressure bumps in protoplanetary disks that helps trap dust particles andfacilitates planet formation.

1410.0678	a global three dimensional radiation magneto-hydrodynamic simulation of  super-eddington accretion disks	we study super-eddington accretion flows onto black holes using a globalthree dimensional radiation magneto-hydrodynamical simulation. we solve thetime dependent radiative transfer equation for the specific intensities toaccurately calculate the angular distribution of the emitted radiation.turbulence generated by the magneto-rotational instability providesself-consistent angular momentum transfer. the simulation reaches inflowequilibrium with an accretion rate ~220l_edd/c^2 and forms a radiation drivenoutflow along the rotation axis. the mechanical energy flux carried by theoutflow is ~20% of the radiative energy flux. the total mass flux lost in theoutflow is about 29% of the net accretion rate. the radiative luminosity ofthis flow is ~10l_edd. this yields a radiative efficiency ~4.5%, which iscomparable to the value in a standard thin disk model. in our simulation,vertical advection of radiation caused by magnetic buoyancy transports energyfaster than photon diffusion, allowing a significant fraction of the photons toescape from the surface of the disk before being advected into the black hole.we contrast our results with the lower radiative efficiencies inferred in mostmodels, such as the slim disk model, which neglect vertical advection. ourinferred radiative efficiencies also exceed published results from previousglobal numerical simulations, which did not attribute a significant role tovertical advection. we briefly discuss the implications for the growth ofsupermassive black holes in the early universe and describe how these resultsprovided a basis for explaining the spectrum and population statistics ofultraluminous x-ray sources.

0804.1353	spherical accretion with anisotropic thermal conduction	we study the effects of anisotropic thermal conduction on magnetizedspherical accretion flows using global axisymmetric mhd simulations. in lowcollisionality plasmas, the bondi spherical accretion solution is unstable tothe magnetothermal instability (mti). the mti grows rapidly at large radiiwhere the inflow is subsonic. for a weak initial field, the mti saturates bycreating a primarily radial magnetic field, i.e., by aligning the field lineswith the background temperature gradient. the saturation is quasilinear in thesense that the magnetic field is amplified by a factor of $\sim 10-30$independent of the initial field strength (for weak fields). in the saturatedstate, the conductive heat flux is much larger than the convective heat flux,and is comparable to the field-free (spitzer) value (since the field lines arelargely radial). the mti by itself does not appreciably change the accretionrate $\dot m$ relative to the bondi rate $\dot m_b$. however, the radial fieldlines created by the mti are amplified by flux freezing as the plasma flows into small radii. oppositely directed field lines are brought together by theconverging inflow, leading to significant resistive heating. when the magneticenergy density is comparable to the gravitational potential energy density, theplasma is heated to roughly the virial temperature; the mean inflow is highlysubsonic; most of the energy released by accretion is transported to largeradii by thermal conduction; and the accretion rate $\dot m \ll \dot m_b$. thepredominantly radial magnetic field created by the mti at large radii inspherical accretion flows may account for the stable faraday rotation measuretowards sgr a* in the galactic center.

1505.02480	survival and structure of dusty vortices in protoplanetary discs	we have studied the impact of dust feedback on the survival and structure ofvortices in protoplanetary discs using 2-d shearing box simulations withlagrangian dust particles. we consider dust with a variety of sizes (stoppingtime $t_s = 10^{-2}\omega^{-1} - 10^{2}\omega^{-1}$, from fully coupled withthe gas to the decoupling limit. we find that a vortex is destroyed by dustfeedback when the total dust-to-gas mass ratio within the vortex is larger than30-50%, independent of the dust size. the dust distribution can still beasymmetric in some cases after the vortex has been destroyed. with smalleramounts of dust, a vortex can survive for at least 100 orbits, and the maximumdust surface density within the vortex can be more than 100 times larger thanthe gas surface density, potentially facilitating planetesimal formation. onthe other hand, in these stable vortices, small ($t_s &lt; \omega^{-1}$) and large($t_s &gt; \omega^{-1}$) dust grains concentrate differently and affect the gasdynamics in different ways. the distribution of large dust is more elongatedthan that of small dust. large dust ($t_s &gt; \omega^{-1}$) concentrates in thecentre of the vortex and feedback leads to turn-over in vorticity towards thecentre, forming a quiescent region within an anticyclonic vortex. such aturn-over is absent if the vortex is loaded with small grains. we demonstratethat, in protoplanetary discs where both large and small dust grains arepresent and under the right condition, the concentration of large dust towardsthe vortex centre can lead to a quiescent centre, repelling the small dust andforming a small dust ring around the vortex centre. such anticorrelationsbetween small and large dust within vortices may explain the discrepancybetween alma and near-ir scattered light observations in the asymmetric regionof transitional discs.

1507.03599	the structure of spiral shocks excited by planetary-mass companions	direct imaging observations have revealed spiral structures in protoplanetarydisks. previous studies have suggested that planet-induced spiral arms cannotexplain some of these spiral patterns, due to the large pitch angle and highcontrast of the spiral arms in observations. we have carried out threedimensional (3-d) hydrodynamical simulations to study spiral wakes/shocksexcited by young planets. we find that, in contrast with linear theory, thepitch angle of spiral arms does depend on the planet mass, which can beexplained by the non-linear density wave theory. a secondary (or even atertiary) spiral arm, especially for inner arms, is also excited by a massiveplanet. with a more massive planet in the disk, the excited spiral arms havelarger pitch angle and the separation between the primary and secondary arms inthe azimuthal direction is also larger. we also find that although the arms inthe outer disk do not exhibit much vertical motion, the inner arms havesignificant vertical motion, which boosts the density perturbation at the diskatmosphere. combining hydrodynamical models with monte-carlo radiative transfercalculations, we find that the inner spiral arms are considerably moreprominent in synthetic near-ir images using full 3-d hydrodynamical models thanimages based on 2-d models assuming vertical hydrostatic equilibrium,indicating the need to model observations with full 3-d hydrodynamics. overall,companion-induced spiral arms not only pinpoint the companion's position butalso provide three independent ways (pitch angle, separation between two arms,and contrast of arms) to constrain the companion's mass.

1509.03630	a validated nonlinear kelvin-helmholtz benchmark for numerical  hydrodynamics	the nonlinear evolution of the kelvin-helmholtz instability is a popular testfor code verification. to date, most kelvin-helmholtz problems discussed in theliterature are ill-posed: they do not converge to any single solution withincreasing resolution. this precludes comparisons among different codes andseverely limits the utility of the kelvin-helmholtz instability as a testproblem. the lack of a reference solution has led various authors to assert theaccuracy of their simulations based on ad-hoc proxies, e.g., the existence ofsmall-scale structures. this paper proposes well-posed kelvin-helmholtzproblems with smooth initial conditions and explicit diffusion. we show that inmany cases numerical errors/noise can seed spurious small-scale structure inkelvin-helmholtz problems. we demonstrate convergence to a reference solutionusing both athena, a godunov code, and dedalus, a pseudo-spectral code.problems with constant initial density throughout the domain are relativelystraightforward for both codes. however, problems with an initial density jump(which are the norm in astrophysical systems) exhibit rich behavior and aremore computationally challenging. in the latter case, athena simulations areprone to an instability of the inner rolled-up vortex; this instability isseeded by grid-scale errors introduced by the algorithm, and disappears asresolution increases. both athena and dedalus exhibit late-time chaos. inviscidsimulations are riddled with extremely vigorous secondary instabilities whichinduce more mixing than simulations with explicit diffusion. our resultshighlight the importance of running well-posed test problems with demonstratedconvergence to a reference solution. to facilitate future comparisons, weinclude the resolved, converged solutions to the kelvin-helmholtz problems inthis paper in machine-readable form.

1511.09115	spreading layers in accreting objects: role of acoustic waves for  angular momentum transport, mixing and thermodynamics	disk accretion at high rate onto a white dwarf or a neutron star has beensuggested to result in the formation of a spreading layer (sl) - a belt-likestructure on the object's surface, in which the accreted matter steadilyspreads in the poleward (meridional) direction while spinning down. to assessits basic characteristics we perform two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulationsof supersonic sls in the relevant morphology with a simple prescription forcooling. we demonstrate that supersonic shear naturally present at the base ofthe sl inevitably drives sonic instability that gives rise to large scaleacoustic modes governing the evolution of the sl. these modes dominate thetransport of momentum and energy, which is intrinsically global and cannot becharacterized via some form of local effective viscosity (e.g.$\alpha$-viscosity). the global nature of the wave-driven transport should haveimportant implications for triggering type i x-ray bursts in low mass x-raybinaries. the nonlinear evolution of waves into a system of shocks driveseffective re-arrangement (sensitively depending on thermodynamical propertiesof the flow) and deceleration of the sl, which ultimately becomes transonic andsusceptible to regular kelvin-helmholtz instability. we interpret thisevolution in terms of the global structure of the sl and suggest that mixing ofthe sl material with the underlying stellar fluid should become effective onlyat intermediate latitudes on the accreting object's surface, where the flow hasdecelerated appreciably. in the near-equatorial regions the transport isdominated by acoustic waves and mixing is less efficient. we speculate thatthis latitudinal non-uniformity of mixing in accreting white dwarfs may belinked to the observed bipolar morphology of classical novae ejecta.

1512.01106	saturation of the magnetorotational instability in the unstratified  shearing box with zero net flux: convergence in taller boxes	previous studies of the nonlinear regime of the magnetorotational instabilityin one particular type of shearing box model -- unstratified with no netmagnetic flux -- find that without explicit dissipation (viscosity andresistivity) the saturation amplitude decreases with increasing numericalresolution. we show that this result is strongly dependent on the verticalaspect ratio of the computational domain $l_z/l_x$. when $l_z/l_x\lesssim 1$,we recover previous results. however, when the vertical domain is extended$l_z/l_x \gtrsim 2.5$, we find the saturation level of the stress is greatlyincreased (giving a ratio of stress to pressure $\alpha \gtrsim 0.1$), andmoreover the results are independent of numerical resolution. consistent withprevious results, we find that saturation of the mri in this regime iscontrolled by a cyclic dynamo which generates patches of strong toroidal fieldthat switches sign on scales of $l_x$ in the vertical direction. we speculatethat when $l_z/l_x\lesssim 1$, the dynamo is inhibited by the small size of thevertical domain, leading to the puzzling dependence of saturation amplitude onresolution. we show that previous toy models developed to explain the mridynamo are consistent with our results, and that the cyclic pattern of toroidalfields observed in stratified shearing box simulations (leading to theso-called butterfly diagram) may also be related. in tall boxes the saturationamplitude is insensitive to whether or not explicit dissipation is included inthe calculations, at least for large magnetic reynolds and prandtl number.finally, we show mri turbulence in tall domains has a smaller critical$\rm{pm}_c$, and an extended lifetime compared to $l_z/l_x\lesssim 1$ boxes.

astro-ph;0104374	a ballistic bow shock model for jet-driven protostellar outflow shells	we analyze the dynamics of the shell produced when a bow shock from acollimated jet propagates into the surrounding medium. under interstellarconditions, the shock is radiative, and a ballistic approximation for the shellflow is appropriate beyond the working surface where the jet impacts itssurroundings. the solution is then determined by the ambient and jet densitiesand velocities and by the momentum impulse applied in the working surface.using estimates for these impulses (confirmed by separate numericalsimulations), we obtain solutions for the shell structure, and for the range ofvelocities in the shell at any point. we provide predictions for theposition-velocity and mass-velocity relations expected for plane-of-skybow-shock shells, and for the bulk shell properties. in a companion paper, weshow that these analytic solutions are in excellent agreement with the resultsof direct numerical simulations. we argue that classical molecular (co)outflows cannot be purely jet-driven, because the bow-shock shell solutions aremuch too elongated compared with observations. finally, we suggest that the``spur'' structures seen in position-velocity diagrams of observed molecularoutflows are the manifestation of internal bow shocks which may be fit with oursimple dynamical models.

astro-ph;0201179	the effect of the hall term on the nonlinear evolution of the  magnetorotational instability: i. local axisymmetric simulations	the effect of the hall term on the evolution of the magnetorotationalinstability (mri) in weakly ionized accretion disks is investigated using localaxisymmetric simulations. first, we show that the hall term has importanteffects on the mri when the temperature and density in the disk is below a fewthousand k and between 10^13 and 10^18 cm^{-3} respectively. such conditionscan occur in the quiescent phase of dwarf nova disks, or in the inner part(inside 10 - 100 au) of protoplanetary disks. when the hall term is important,the properties of the mri are dependent on the direction of the magnetic fieldwith respect to the angular velocity vector \omega. if the disk is threaded bya uniform vertical field oriented in the same sense as \omega, the axisymmetricevolution of the mri is an exponentially growing two-channel flow withoutsaturation. when the field is oppositely directed to \omega, however, smallscale fluctuations prevent the nonlinear growth of the channel flow and the mrievolves into mhd turbulence. these results are anticipated from thecharacteristics of the linear dispersion relation. in axisymmetry on a fieldwith zero-net flux, the evolution of the mri is independent of the size of thehall term relative to the inductive term. the evolution in this case isdetermined mostly by the effect of ohmic dissipation.

astro-ph;0205383	the effect of the hall term on the nonlinear evolution of the  magnetorotational instability: ii. saturation level and critical magnetic  reynolds number	the nonlinear evolution of the magnetorotational instability (mri) in weaklyionized accretion disks, including the effect of the hall term and ohmicdissipation, is investigated using local three-dimensional mhd simulations andvarious initial magnetic field geometries. when the magnetic reynolds number,re_m \equiv v_a^2 / \eta \omega (where v_a is the alfven speed, \eta themagnetic diffusivity, and \omega the angular frequency), is initially largerthan a critical value re_{m, crit}, the mri evolves into mhd turbulence inwhich angular momentum is transported efficiently by the maxwell stress. ifre_m &lt; re_{m, crit}, however, ohmic dissipation suppresses the mri, and thestress is reduced by several orders of magnitude. the critical value is in therange of 1 - 30 depending on the initial field configuration. the hall effectdoes not modify the critical magnetic reynolds number by much, but enhances thesaturation level of the maxwell stress by a factor of a few. we show that thesaturation level of the mri is characterized by v_{az}^2 / \eta \omega, wherev_{az} is the alfven speed in the nonlinear regime along the vertical componentof the field. the condition for turbulence and significant transport is givenby v_{az}^2 / \eta \omega \gtrsim 1, and this critical value is independent ofthe strength and geometry of the magnetic field or the size of the hall term.if the magnetic field strength in an accretion disk can be estimatedobservationally, and the magnetic reynolds number v_a^2 / \eta \omega is largerthan about 30, this would imply the mri is operating in the disk.

astro-ph;0210541	local magnetohydrodynamical models of layered accretion disks	using numerical mhd simulations, we have studied the evolution of themagnetorotational instability in stratified accretion disks in which theionization fraction (and therefore resistivity) varies substantially withheight. this model is appropriate to dense, cold disks around protostars ordwarf nova systems which are ionized by external irradiation of cosmic rays orhigh-energy photons. we find the growth and saturation of the mri occurs onlyin the upper layers of the disk where the magnetic reynolds number exceeds acritical value; in the midplane the disk remains queiscent. the verticalpoynting flux into the "dead", central zone is small, however velocityfluctuations in the dead zone driven by the turbulence in the active layersgenerate a significant reynolds stress in the midplane. when normalized by thethermal pressure, the reynolds stress in the midplane never drops below about10% of the value of the maxwell stress in the active layers, even though themaxwell stress in the dead zone may be orders of magnitude smaller than this.significant mass mixing occurs between the dead zone and active layers.fluctuations in the magnetic energy in the active layers can drive verticaloscillations of the disk in models where the ratio of the column density in thedead zone to that in the active layers is &lt;10. these results have importantimplications for the global evolution of a layered disk, in particular theremay be residual mass inflow in the dead layer. we discuss the effects that dustin the disk may have on our results.

astro-ph;0212076	a local one-zone model of mhd turbulence in dwarf nova disks	the evolution of the magnetorotational instability (mri) during thetransition from outburst to quiescence in a dwarf nova disk is investigatedusing three-dimensional mhd simulations. the shearing box approximation isadopted for the analysis, so that the efficiency of angular momentum transportis studied in a small local patch of the disk: this is usually referred as to aone-zone model. to take account of the low ionization fraction of the disk, theinduction equation includes both ohmic dissipation and the hall effect. weinduce a transition from outburst to quiescence by an instantaneous decrease ofthe temperature. the evolution of the mri during the transition is found to bevery sensitive to the temperature of the quiescent disk. as long as thetemperature is higher than a critical value of about 2000 k, mhd turbulence andangular momentum transport is sustained by the mri. however, mhd turbulencedies away within an orbital time if the temperature falls below this criticalvalue. in this case, the stress drops off by more than 2 orders of magnitude,and is dominated by the reynolds stress associated with the remnant motionsfrom the outburst. the critical temperature depends slightly on the distancefrom the central star and the local density of the disk.

astro-ph;0612195	saturation of the magnetothermal instability in three dimensions	in dilute astrophysical plasmas, thermal conduction is primarily alongmagnetic field lines, and therefore highly anisotropic. as a result, the usualconvective stability criterion is modified from a condition on entropy to acondition on temperature. for small magnetic fields or small wavenumbers,instability occurs in any atmosphere where the temperature and pressuregradients point in the same direction. we refer to the resulting convectiveinstability as the magnetothermal instability (mti). we present fullythree-dimensional simulations of the mti and show that saturation results in anatmosphere with different vertical structure, dependent upon the boundaryconditions. when the temperature at the boundary of the unstable layer isallowed to vary, the temperature gradient relaxes until the unstable region isalmost isothermal. when the temperature at the boundary of the unstable regionis fixed, the magnetic field is reoriented to an almost vertical geometry as aresult of buoyant motions. this case exhibits more vigorous turbulence. in bothcases the resulting saturated heat flux is almost one-half of the valueexpected if the conduction were purely isotropic. the action of the mti resultsin dynamical processes that lead to significant transport perpendicular to theinitial direction of the magnetic field. the resulting magnetoconvection inboth cases amplifies the magnetic field until it is almost in equipartitionwith sustained subsonic turbulence. these results are relevant to understandingmeasurements of the temperature profiles of the intracluster medium of clustersof galaxies as well as the structure of radiatively inefficient accretionflows.

astro-ph;0702425	effect of the coriolis force on the hydrodynamics of colliding wind  binaries	using fully three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we investigate theeffect of the coriolis force on the hydrodynamic and observable properties ofcolliding wind binary systems. to make the calculations tractable, we assumeadiabatic, constant velocity winds. the neglect of radiative driving,gravitational deceleration, and cooling limit the application of our models toreal systems. however, these assumptions allow us to isolate the effect of thecoriolis force, and by simplifying the calculations, allow us to use a higherresolution (up to 640^3) and to conduct a larger survey of parameter space. westudy the dynamics of collidng winds with equal mass loss rates and velocitiesemanating from equal mass stars on circular orbits, with a range of values forthe ratio of the wind to orbital velocity. we also study the dynamics of windsfrom stars on elliptical orbits and with unequal strength winds. orbital motionof the stars sweeps the shocked wind gas into an archimedean spiral, withasymmetric shock strengths and therefore unequal postshock temperatures anddensities in the leading and trailing edges of the spiral. we observe thekelvin-helmholtz instability at the contact surface between the shocked windsin systems with orbital motion even when the winds are identical. the change inshock strengths caused by orbital motion increases the volume of x-ray emittingpost-shock gas with t &gt; 0.59 kev by 63% for a typical system as the ratio ofwind velocity to orbital velocity decreases to v_w/v_o = 2.5. this causesincreased free-free emission from systems with shorter orbital periods and analtered time-dependence of the wind attenuation. we comment on the importanceof the effects of orbital motion on the observable properties of colliding windbinaries.

astro-ph;0703097	coulomb bubbles: over-stable driving of magnetoacoustic waves due to the  rapid and anisotropic diffusion of energy	we perform a linear magnetohydrodynamic perturbation analysis for astratified magnetized envelope where the diffusion of heat is mediated bycharged particles that are confined to flow along magnetic field lines. weidentify an instability, the ``coulomb bubble instability,'' which may bethought of as standard magnetosonic fast and slow waves, driven by the rapiddiffusion of heat along the direction of the magnetic field. we calculate thegrowth rate and stability criteria for the coulomb bubble instability forvarious choices of equilibrium conditions. the coulomb bubble instability ismost strongly driven for weakly magnetized atmospheres that are stronglyconvectively stable. we briefly discuss a possible application of astrophysicalinterest: diffusion of interstellar cosmic rays in the hot t ~ 10^6 k galacticcorona. we show that for commonly accepted values of the cosmic ray and gaspressure as well as its overall characteristic dimensions, the galactic coronais in a marginal state of stability with respect to a cosmic ray coulomb bubbleinstability. the implication being that a cosmic ray coulomb bubble instabilityplays a role regulating both the pressure and transport properties ofinterstellar cosmic rays, while serving as a source of acoustic power above thegalactic disk.

astro-ph;0703572	electron heating in hot accretion flows	local (shearing box) simulations of the nonlinear evolution of themagnetorotational instability in a collisionless plasma show that angularmomentum transport by pressure anisotropy ($p_\perp \ne p_\parallel$, where thedirections are defined with respect to the local magnetic field) is comparableto that due to the maxwell and reynolds stresses. pressure anisotropy, which iseffectively a large-scale viscosity, arises because of adiabatic invariantsrelated to $p_\perp$ and $p_\parallel$ in a fluctuating magnetic field. in acollisionless plasma, the magnitude of the pressure anisotropy, and thus theviscosity, is determined by kinetic instabilities at the cyclotron frequency.our simulations show that $\sim 50$ % of the gravitational potential energy isdirectly converted into heat at large scales by the viscous stress (theremaining energy is lost to grid-scale numerical dissipation of kinetic andmagnetic energy). we show that electrons receive a significant fraction ($\sim[t_e/t_i]^{1/2}$) of this dissipated energy. employing this heating by ananisotropic viscous stress in one dimensional models of radiatively inefficientaccretion flows, we find that the radiative efficiency of the flow is greaterthan 0.5% for $\dot{m} \gtrsim 10^{-4} \dot{m}_{edd}$. thus a low accretionrate, rather than just a low radiative efficiency, is necessary to explain thelow luminosity of many accreting black holes. for sgr a* in the galacticcenter, our predicted radiative efficiencies imply an accretion rate of$\approx 3 \times 10^{-8} m_\odot {\rm yr^{-1}}$ and an electron temperature of$\approx 3 \times 10^{10}$ k at $\approx 10$ schwarzschild radii; the latter isconsistent with the brightness temperature inferred from vlbi observations.

astro-ph;9702072	systematic errors in the hubble constant based on measurement of the  sunyaev-zeldovich effect	values of the hubble constant reported to date which are based on measurementof the sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) effect in clusters of galaxies are systematicallylower than those derived by other methods (e.g., cepheid variable stars, or thetully-fisher relation). we investigate the possibility that systematic errorsmay be introduced into the analysis by the generally adopted assumptions thatobserved clusters are in hydrostatic equilibrium, are spherically symmetric,and are isothermal. we construct self-consistent theoretical models of mergingclusters of galaxies using hydrodynamical/n-body simulations. we then computethe magnitude of ho derived from the sz effect at different times and atdifferent projection angles both from first principles, and by applying each ofthe standard assumptions used in the interpretation of observations. ourresults indicate that the assumption of isothermality in the evolving clusterscan result in ho being underestimated by 10-30% depending on both epoch andprojection angle. moreover, use of the projected, emission-weighted temperatureprofile under the assumption of spherical symmetry does not significantlyimprove the situation except in the case of more extreme mergers (i.e., thoseinvolving relatively gas-rich subclusters).

astro-ph;9708043	anatomy of a merger: a numerical model of a754	a754 is a well-observed cluster of galaxies which exhibits a variety ofmorphological peculiarities. these include a bar of x-ray emission that isoffset significantly from the galaxy distribution, an elongated x-ray surfacebrightness distribution extending between two distinct peaks in the galaxydistribution, and an extremely non-isothermal and asymmetric intraclustermedium (icm) temperature morphology. using these observational constraints, wepresent a numerical hydro/n-body model of a754 in which two clusters (2.5:1mass ratio) have merged nearly in the plane of the sky less than 0.5 gyrs agowith an impact parameter of ~120 kpc, and an impact velocity of ~2500 km/s(roughly the escape velocity of the primary cluster). our models allow us toidentify the origin of a754's peculiar x-ray and temperature morphologies, theunderlying hydrodynamical processes that shape them, and their futureevolution. we make detailed predictions for future high resolution x-rayspectroscopic observations (e.g. astro-e). we discuss general properties of ourmodels which will be characteristic of off-axis mergers. in particular, we findsignificant non-thermal pressure support within the central region which couldbias cluster mass estimates. we find significant angular momentum imparted onthe gas distribution in the cluster. we find that mixing of the subcluster gascomponents is an inefficient process, particularly at large radii. finally, wefind that subsequent dark matter core passages result in an extended relaxationtimescale.

astro-ph;9710305	radiation driven winds from luminous accretion disks	we study the 2-d, time-dependent hydrodynamics of radiation-driven winds fromaccretion disks in which the radiation force is mediated by spectral lines. ifthe dominant contribution to the total radiation field comes from the disk,then we find the outflow is intrinsically unsteady and characterised by largeamplitude velocity and density changes. both infall and outflow can occur indifferent regions of the wind at the same time. on the other hand, if the totalluminosity of the system is dominated by the central star, then the outflow issteady. in either case, we find the 2-d structure of the wind consists of adense, slow outflow, typically confined to angles within about 45$^o$ of theequatorial plane, that is bounded on the polar side by a high -velocity, lowerdensity stream. the flow geometry is controlled largely by the geometry of theradiation field. global properties e.g., the total mass loss rate and terminalvelocity depend more on the system luminosity and are insensitive to geometry.matter is fed into the fast wind from within a few stellar radii of the centralstar. our solutions agree qualitatively with the kinematics of outflows in cvsystems inferred from spectroscopic observations. we predict that lowluminosity systems may display unsteady behavior in wind-formed spectral lines.our study also has application to winds from active galactic nuclei and fromhigh mass ysos.

astro-ph;9802227	nonlinear evolution of the magnetorotational instability in ion-neutral  disks	we carry out three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of themagnetorotational (balbus-hawley) instability in weakly-ionized plasmas. weadopt a formulation in which the ions and neutrals each are treated as separatefluids coupled only through a collisional drag term. ionization andrecombination processes are not considered. the linear stability of theion-neutral system has been previously considered by blaes and balbus (1994).here we extend their results into the nonlinear regime by computing theevolution of keplerian angular momentum distribution in the local shearing boxapproximation. we find significant turbulence and angular momentum transportwhen the collisional frequency is on order 100 times the orbital frequency. athigher collision rates, the two-fluid system studied here behaves much like thefully ionized systems studied previously. at lower collision rates theevolution of the instability is determined primarily by the properties of theions, with the neutrals acting as a sink for the turbulence. since in thisregime saturation occurs when the magnetic field is superthermal with respectto the ion pressure, we find the amplitude of the magnetic energy and thecorresponding angular momentum transport rate is proportional to the iondensity. our calculations show the ions and neutrals are essentially decoupledwhen the collision frequency is less than 0.01 times the orbital frequency; inthis case the ion fluid behaves as in the single fluid simulations and theneutrals remain quiescent. we find that purely toroidal initial magnetic fieldconfigurations are unstable to the magnetorotational instability across therange of coupling frequencies.

astro-ph;9810321	kinetic and structural evolution of self-gravitating, magnetized clouds:  2.5-dimensional simulations of decaying turbulence	the molecular component of the galaxy is comprised of turbulent, magnetizedclouds, many of which are self-gravitating and form stars. to understand howthese clouds' evolution may depend on their level of turbulence, meanmagnetization, and degree of self-gravity, we perform a survey of directnumerical mhd simulations in 2.5 dimensions. two of our independent surveyparameters allow us to model clouds which either meet or fail conditions formagneto-jeans stability and magnetic criticality. our third survey parameterallows us to initiate turbulence of either sub- or super-alfv\'enic amplitude.we evaluate the times for each cloud model to become gravitationally bound, andmeasure each model's kinetic energy loss over the fluid flow crossing time. wecompare the evolution of density and magnetic field structural morphology, andquantify the differences in the density contrast generated by internalstresses, for models of differing mean magnetization. we find that the valuesof (c_s/v_a)^2 and l/l_jeans, but not the initial mach number v/c_s, determinethe time for cloud gravitational binding and collapse. we find, contrary tosome previous expectations, less than a factor of two difference betweenturbulent decay times for models with varying magnetic field strength. in allmodels, we find turbulent amplification in the magnetic field strength, withthe turbulent magnetic energy between 25-60% of the turbulent kinetic energyafter one flow crossing time. we find that for non-self-gravitating stages ofevolution, the mass-averaged density contrast magnitudes &lt;log(\rho/\bar\rho)&gt;are in the range 0.2-0.5; we note that only the more strongly-magnetized modelsappear consistent with estimates of clump/interclump density contrasts inferredin galactic gmcs.

astro-ph;9908185	hydrodynamical non-radiative accretion flows in two-dimensions	two-dimensional (axially symmetric) numerical hydrodynamical calculations ofaccretion flows which cannot cool through emission of radiation are presented.the calculations begin from an equilibrium configuration consisting of a thicktorus with constant specific angular momentum. accretion is induced by theaddition of a small anomalous azimuthal shear stress which is characterized bya function \nu. we study the flows generated as the amplitude and form of \nuare varied. a spherical polar grid which spans more than two orders ofmagnitude in radius is used to resolve the flow over a wide range of spatialscales. we find that convection in the inner regions produces significantoutward mass motions that carry away both the energy liberated by, and a largefraction of the mass participating in, the accretion flow. although theinstantaneous structure of the flow is complex and dominated by convectiveeddies, long time averages of the dynamical variables show remarkablecorrespondence to certain steady-state solutions. near the equatorial plane,the radial profiles of the time-averaged variables are power-laws with an indexthat depends on the radial scaling of the shear stress. we find that regardlessof the adiabatic index of the gas, or the form or magnitude of the shearstress, the mass inflow rate is a strongly increasing function of radius, andis everywhere nearly exactly balanced by mass outflow. the net mass accretionrate through the disc is only a fraction of the rate at which mass is suppliedto the inflow at large radii, and is given by the local, viscous accretion rateassociated with the flow properties near the central object.

0809.4005	dissipation and heating in supersonic hydrodynamic and mhd turbulence	we study energy dissipation and heating by supersonic mhd turbulence inmolecular clouds using athena, a new higher-order godunov code. we analyze thedependence of the saturation amplitude, energy dissipation characteristics,power spectra, sonic scaling, and indicators of intermittency in the turbulenceon factors such as the magnetic field strength, driving scale, energy injectionrate, and numerical resolution. while convergence in the energies is reached atmoderate resolutions, we find that the power spectra require much higherresolutions that are difficult to obtain. in a 1024^3 hydro run, we find apower law relationship between the velocity dispersion and the spatial scale onwhich it is measured, while for an mhd run at the same resolution we find nosuch power law. the time-variability and temperature intermittency in theturbulence both show a dependence on the driving scale, indicating thatnumerically driving turbulence by an arbitrary mechanism may not allow arealistic representation of these properties. we also note similar features inthe power spectrum of the compressive component of velocity for supersonic mhdturbulence as in the velocity spectrum of an initially-spherical mhd blastwave, implying that the power law form does not rule out shocks, rather than aturbulent cascade, playing a significant role in the regulation of energytransfer between spatial scales.

0812.2568	anisotropic winds from close-in extra-solar planets	we present two-dimensional hydrodynamic models of thermally driven winds fromhighly irradiated, close-in extra-solar planets. we adopt a very simpletreatment of the radiative heating processes at the base of the wind, andinstead focus on the differences between the properties of outflows inmultidimensions in comparison to spherically symmetric models computed with thesame methods. for hot (t &gt; 2 x 10^{4} k) or highly ionized gas, we find strong(supersonic) polar flows are formed above the planet surface which produce weakshocks and outflow on the night-side. in comparison to a spherically symmetricwind with the same parameters, the sonic surface on the day-side is much closerto the planet surface in multidimensions, and the total mass loss rate isreduced by almost a factor of four. we also compute the steady-state structureof interacting planetary and stellar winds. both winds end in a terminationshock, with a parabolic contact discontinuity which is draped over the planetseparating the two shocked winds. the planetary wind termination shock and thesonic surface in the wind are well separated, so that the mass loss rate fromthe planet is essentially unaffected. however, the confinement of the planetarywind to the small volume bounded by the contact discontinuity greatly enhancesthe column density close to the planet, which might be important for theinterpretation of observations of absorption lines formed by gas surroundingtransiting planets.
