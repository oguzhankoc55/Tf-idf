0907.1074	the circumstellar disc in the bok globule cb 26: multi-wavelength  observations and modelling of the dust disc and envelope	circumstellar discs are expected to be the nursery of planets. grain growthwithin such discs is the first step in the planet formation process. the bokglobule cb 26 harbours such a young disc. we present a detailed model of theedge-on circumstellar disc and its envelope in the bok globule cb 26. the modelis based on hst near-infrared maps in the i, j, h, and k bands, ovro and smaradio maps at 1.1mm, 1.3mm and 2.7mm, and the spectral energy distribution(sed) from 0.9 microns to 3mm. new photometric and spectroscopic data from thespitzer space telescope and the caltech submilimeter observatory have beenobtained and are part of our analysis. using the self-consistent radiativetransfer code mc3d, the model we construct is able to discriminate parametersets and dust properties of both its parts, namely envelope and disc. we findthat the disc has an inner hole with a radius of 45 +/- 5 au. based on a dustmodel including silicate and graphite the maximum grain size needed toreproduce the spectral millimetre index is 2.5 microns. features seen in thenear-infrared images, dominated by scattered light, can be described as aresult of a rotating envelope. successful employment of ism dust in both thedisc and envelope hint that grain growth may not yet play a significant rolefor the appearance of this system. a larger inner hole gives rise to theassumption that cb 26 is a circumbinary disc.

0910.1609	the science case for building a band 1 receiver suite for alma	we present a set of compelling science cases for the alma band 1 receiversuite. for these cases, we assume in tandem the updated nominal band 1frequency range of 35-50 ghz with a likely extension up to 52 ghz; togetherthese frequencies optimize the band 1 science return. the scope of the sciencecases ranges from nearby stars to the re-ionization edge of the universe. twocases provide additional leverage on the present alma level one science goalsand are seen as particularly powerful motivations for building the band 1receiver suite: (1) detailing the evolution of grains in protoplanetary disks,as a complement to the gas kinematics, requires continuum observations out to~35 ghz (~9mm); and (2) detecting co 3-2 line emission from galaxies like themilky way during the epoch of re-ionization, i.e., 6 &lt; z &lt; 10, also requiresband 1 receiver coverage. the range of band 1 science is wide, however, andincludes studies of very small dust grains in the ism, pulsar wind nebulae,radio supernovae, x-ray binaries, the galactic center (i.e., sgr a*), densecloud cores, complex carbon-chain molecules, masers, magnetic fields in thedense ism, jets and outflows from young stars, distant galaxies, and galaxyclusters (i.e., the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect). a comparison of alma and thejansky vla (jvla) at the same frequencies of band 1 finds similar sensitivityperformance at 40-50 ghz, with a slight edge for alma at higher frequencies(e.g., within a factor of 2 for continuum observations). with its larger numberof instantaneous baselines, however, alma band 1data will have greater fidelitythan those from the jvla at similar frequencies.

0911.3445	panchromatic observations and modeling of the hv tau c edge-on disk	we present new high spatial resolution (&lt;~ 0.1") 1-5 micron adaptive opticsimages, interferometric 1.3 mm continuum and 12co 2-1 maps, and 350 micron, 2.8and 3.3 mm fluxes measurements of the hv tau system. our adaptive optics imagesreveal an unusually slow orbital motion within the tight hv tau ab pair thatsuggests a highly eccentric orbit and/or a large deprojected physicalseparation. scattered light images of the hv tau c edge-on protoplanetary disksuggest that the anisotropy of the dust scattering phase function is almostindependent of wavelength from 0.8 to 5 micron, whereas the dust opacitydecreases significantly over the same range. the images further reveal a markedlateral asymmetry in the disk that does not vary over a timescale of 2 years.we further detect a radial velocity gradient in the disk in our 12co map thatlies along the same position angle as the elongation of the continuum emission,which is consistent with keplerian rotation around an 0.5-1 msun central star,suggesting that it could be the most massive component in the triple system. weuse a powerful radiative transfer model to compute synthetic disk observationsand use a bayesian inference method to extract constraints on the diskproperties. each individual image, as well as the spectral energy distribution,of hv tau c can be well reproduced by our models with fully mixed dust providedgrain growth has already produced larger-than-interstellar dust grains.however, no single model can satisfactorily simultaneously account for allobservations. we suggest that future attempts to model this source include morecomplex dust properties and possibly vertical stratification.

1001.3691	toward understanding the formation of multiple systems - a pilot  iram-pdbi survey of class 0 objects	the formation process of binary stars and multiple systems is poorlyunderstood. here, we seek to determine the typical outcome of protostellarcollapse and to constrain models of binary formation by core fragmentationduring collapse, using high-resolution millimeter continuum imaging of veryyoung (class 0) protostars observed at the beginning of the main accretionphase. we carried out a pilot high-resolution study of 5 class 0 objects, usingthe most extended (a) configuration of the iram pdbi at 1.3 mm, which allow usto probe the multiplicity of class 0 protostars down to separations a ~50 auand circumstellar mass ratios q ~0.07. we show that our pdbi observationsrevealed only wide (&gt;1500 au) protobinary systems and/or outflow-generatedfeatures. when combined with previous millimeter interferometric observationsof class 0 protostars, our pilot pdbi study tentatively suggests that thebinary fraction in the ~ 75-1000 au range increases from the class 0 to theclass i stage. it also seems to argue against purely hydrodynamic models ofbinary star formation. we briefly discuss possible alternative scenarios toreconcile the low multiplicity rate of class 0 protostars on small scales withthe higher binary fraction observed at later evolutionary stages.

1001.4800	high precision dynamical masses of very low mass binaries	[abridged] we present the results of a 3 year monitoring program of a sampleof very low mass (vlm) field binaries using both astrometric and spectroscopicdata obtained in conjunction with the laser guide star adaptive optics systemon the w.m. keck ii 10 m telescope. fifteen systems have undergone sufficientorbital motion, allowing us to derive their relative orbital parameters andhence their total system mass. these measurements triple the number of massesfor vlm objects. among the 11 systems with both astrometric and spectroscopicmeasurements, six have sufficient radial velocity variations to allow us toobtain individual component masses. this is the first derivation of thecomponent masses for five of these systems. altogether, the orbital solutionsof these low mass systems show a correlation between eccentricity and orbitalperiod, consistent with their higher mass counterparts. in our primaryanalysis, we find that there are systematic discrepancies between our dynamicalmass measurements and the predictions of theoretical evolutionary models(tucson and lyon) with both models either underpredicting or overpredicting themost precisely determined dynamical masses. these discrepancies are a functionof spectral type, with late m through mid l systems tending to have theirmasses underpredicted, while one t type system has its mass overpredicted.these discrepancies imply that either the temperatures predicted byevolutionary and atmosphere models are inconsistent for an object of a givenmass, or the mass-radius relationship or cooling timescales predicted by theevolutionary models are incorrect. if these spectral type trends hold into theplanetary mass regime, the implication is that the masses of directly imagedextrasolar planets are overpredicted by the evolutionary models.

1008.5065	multi-wavelength study of the disk around the very low-mass star  par-lup3-4	par-lup3-4 is a very low-mass star (spectral type m5) in the lupus iiistar-forming region. the object is underluminous by ~4 mag when compared toobjects of similar mass in the same association. to better understand theorigin of its underluminosity, we have analyzed high angular resolution near-irimaging data and mid-ir spectroscopy. we have also compared the sed of thetarget (from the optical to the sub-millimeter regime) to a grid of radiativetransfer models of circumstellar disks. the diffraction-limited infraredobservations do not show obvious extended emission, allowing us to put an upperlimit to the disk outer radius of ~20au. the lack of extended emission,together with the non detection of a strong 9.8 microns silicate in absorptionindicates that par-lup3-4 is probably in a class ii (rather than class i)evolutionary stage. the sed of par-lup3-4 resembles that of objects withedge-on disks seen in scattered light, that is, a double peaked-sed and a dipat ~10 microns. we can fit the whole sed with a single disk model with aninclination of 81+/-6 degrees which provides a natural explanation for theunder-luminosity of the target. our analysis allows to put constraints on thedisk inner radius, rin &lt; 0.05 au, which is very close to the dust sublimationradius, and the maximum size of the dust grains, a_max &gt; 10 microns, whichindicates that dust processing has already taken place in par-lup3-4.

1112.1018	a surprising dynamical mass for v773~tau~b	we report on new high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy on the multiple ttauri star system v773 tau over the 2003 -- 2009 period. with these data wederive relative astrometry, photometry between the a and b components, andradial velocity (rv) of the a-subsystem components. combining these new datawith previously published astrometry and rvs, we update the relative a-b orbitmodel. this updated orbit model, the known system distance, and a subsystemparameters yields a dynamical mass for the b component for the first time.remarkably the derived b dynamical mass is in the range of 1.7 -- 3.0 m$_\sun$.this is much higher than previous estimates, and suggests that like a, b isalso a multiple stellar system.  among these data, spatially-resolved spectroscopy provide new insight intothe nature of the b component. similar to a, these near-ir spectra indicatethat the dominant source in b is of mid-k spectral type. if b is in fact amultiple star system as suggested by the dynamical mass estimate, the simplestassumption is that b is composed of similar $\sim$ 1.2 m$_\sun$ pms stars in aclose ($&lt;$ 1 au) binary system. this inference is supported by line-shapechanges in near-ir spectroscopy of b, tentatively interpreted as changing rvamong components in v773 tau b.  relative photometry indicate that b is highly variable in the near-ir. themost likely explanation for this variability is circum-b material resulting invariable line-of-sight extinction. the distribution of this material must besignificantly affected by both the putative b multiplicity, and the a-b orbit.

1201.1911	99 herculis: host to a circumbinary polar-ring debris disk	we present resolved herschel images of a circumbinary debris disk in the 99herculis system. the primary is a late f-type star. the binary orbit is wellcharacterised and we conclude that the disk is misaligned with the binaryplane. two different models can explain the observed structure. the first modelis a ring of polar orbits that move in a plane perpendicular to the binarypericenter direction. we favour this interpretation because it includes theeffect of secular perturbations and the disk can survive for gyr timescales.the second model is a misaligned ring. because there is an ambiguity in theorientation of the ring, which could be reflected in the sky plane, this ringeither has near-polar orbits similar to the first model, or has a 30 degreemisalignment. the misaligned ring, interpreted as the result of a recentcollision, is shown to be implausible from constraints on the collisional anddynamical evolution. because disk+star systems with separations similar to 99herculis should form coplanar, possible formation scenarios involve either aclose stellar encounter or binary exchange in the presence of circumstellarand/or circumbinary disks. discovery and characterisation of systems like 99herculis will help understand processes that result in planetary systemmisalignment around both single and multiple stars.

1202.5555	rotational velocities of individual components in very low mass binaries	we present rotational velocities for individual components of eleven very lowmass (vlm) binaries with spectral types between m7 and l7.5. these results arebased on observations taken with the near-infrared spectrograph, nirspec, andthe keck ii laser guide star adaptive optics (lgs ao) system. we find that theobserved sources tend to be rapid rotators (vsini &gt; 10 km/s), consistent withprevious seeing-limited measurements of vlm objects. the two sources with thelargest vsini, lp 349-25b and hd 130948c, are rotating at ~30% of their breakup speed, and are among the most rapidly rotating vlm objects known.furthermore, five binary systems, all with orbital semi-major axes &lt;3.5 au,have component vsini values that differ by greater than 3sigma. to bring thebinary components with discrepant rotational velocities into agreement wouldrequire the rotational axes to be inclined with respect to each other, and thatat least one component is inclined with respect to the orbital plane.alternatively, each component could be rotating at a different rate, eventhough they have similar spectral types. both differing rotational velocitiesand inclinations have implications for binary star formation and evolution. wealso investigate possible dynamical evolution in the triple system hd130948a-bc. the close binary brown dwarfs b and c have significantly differentvsini values. we demonstrate that components b and c could have been torquedinto misalignment by the primary star, a, via orbital precession. such ascenario can also be applied to another triple system in our sample, gj569a-bab. interactions such as these may play an important role in thedynamical evolution of very low mass binaries. finally, we note that two of thebinaries with large differences in component vsini, lp 349-25ab and 2mass0746+20ab, are also known radio sources.

1501.03813	does the presence of planets affect the frequency and properties of  extrasolar kuiper belts? results from the herschel debris and dunes surveys	the study of the planet-debris disk connection can shed light on theformation and evolution of planetary systems, and may help predict the presenceof planets around stars with certain disk characteristics. in preliminaryanalyses of the herschel debris and dunes surveys, wyatt et al. (2012) andmarshall et al. (2014) identified a tentative correlation between debris andlow-mass planets. here we use the cleanest possible sample out these surveys toassess the presence of such a correlation, discarding stars without known ages,with ages &lt; 1 gyr and with binary companions &lt;100 au, to rule out possiblecorrelations due to effects other than planet presence. in our sample of 204fgk stars, we do not find evidence that debris disks are more common or moredusty around stars harboring high-mass or low-mass planets compared to acontrol sample without identified planets, nor that debris disks are more orless common (or more or less dusty) around stars harboring multiple planetscompared to single-planet systems. diverse dynamical histories may account forthe lack of correlations. the data show the correlation between the presence ofhigh-mass planets and stellar metallicity, but no correlation between thepresence of low-mass planets or debris and stellar metallicity. comparing theobserved cumulative distribution of fractional luminosity to those expectedfrom a gaussian distribution, we find that a distribution centered on the solarsystem's value fits well the data, while one centered at 10 times this valuecan be rejected. this is of interest in the context of future terrestrialplanet characterization because it indicates that there are good prospects forfinding a large number of debris disk systems (i.e. with evidence of harboringthe building blocks of planets) with exozodiacal emission low enough to beappropriate targets for an atlast-type mission to search for biosignatures.

1501.06210	probing stellar accretion with mid-infrared hydrogen lines	in this paper we investigate the origin of the mid-infrared (ir) hydrogenrecombination lines for a sample of 114 disks in different evolutionary stages(full, transitional and debris disks) collected from the {\it spitzer} archive.we focus on the two brighter {h~{\sc i}} lines observed in the {\it spitzer}spectra, the {h~{\sc i}}(7-6) at 12.37$\mu$m and the {h~{\sc i}}(9-7) at11.32$\mu$m. we detect the {h~{\sc i}}(7-6) line in 46 objects, and the {h~{\sci}}(9-7) in 11. we compare these lines with the other most common gas linedetected in {\it spitzer} spectra, the {[ne~{\sc iii}]} at 12.81$\mu$m. weargue that it is unlikely that the {h~{\sc i}} emission originates from thephotoevaporating upper surface layers of the disk, as has been found for the{[ne~{\sc iii}]} lines toward low-accreting stars. using the {h~{\sci}}(9-7)/{h~{\sc i}}(7-6) line ratios we find these gas lines are likelyprobing gas with hydrogen column densities of 10$^{10}$-10$^{11}$~cm$^{-3}$.the subsample of objects surrounded by full and transitional disks show apositive correlation between the accretion luminosity and the {h~{\sc i}} lineluminosity. these two results suggest that the observed mid-ir {h~{\sc i}}lines trace gas accreting onto the star in the same way as other hydrogenrecombination lines at shorter wavelengths. a pure chromospheric origin ofthese lines can be excluded for the vast majority of full and transitionaldisks.we report for the first time the detection of the {h~{\sc i}}(7-6) linein eight young (&lt; 20~myr) debris disks. a pure chromospheric origin cannot beruled out in these objects. if the {h~{\sc i}}(7-6) line traces accretion inthese older systems, as in the case of full and transitional disks, thestrength of the emission implies accretion rates lower than10$^{-10}$m$_{\odot}$/yr. we discuss some advantages of extending accretionindicators to longer wavelengths.

0808.0619	probing dust grain evolution in im lupi's circumstellar disc.  multi-wavelength observations and modelling of the dust disc	we present a panchromatic study, involving a multiple technique approach, ofthe circumstellar disc surrounding the t tauri star im lupi (sz 82). we haveundertaken a comprehensive observational study of im lupi using photometry,spectroscopy, millimetre interferometry and multi-wavelength imaging. for thefirst time, the disc is resolved from optical and near-infrared wavelengths inscattered light, to the millimetre regime in thermal emission. our data-set, inconjunction with existing photometric data, provides an extensive coverage ofthe spectral energy distribution, including a detailed spectrum of the silicateemission bands. we have performed a simultaneous modelling of the variousobservations, using the radiative transfer code mcfost, and analysed a grid ofmodels over a large fraction of the parameter space via bayesian inference. wehave constructed a model that can reproduce all of the observations of thedisc. our analysis illustrates the importance of combining a wide range ofobservations in order to fully constrain the disc model, with each observationproviding a strong constraint only on some aspects of the disc structure anddust content. quantitative evidence of dust evolution in the disc is obtained:grain growth up to millimetre-sized particles, vertical stratification of dustgrains with micrometric grains close to the disc surface and larger grainswhich have settled towards the disc midplane, and possibly the formation offluffy aggregates and/or ice mantles around grains.

astro-ph;0106493	the formation and evolution of binary systems. iii. low-mass binaries in  the praesepe cluster	with the aim of investigating the binary population of the 700 myr oldpraesepe cluster, we have observed 149 g and k-type cluster members usingadaptive optics. we detected 26 binary systems with an angular separationranging from less than 0.08 to 3.3 arcsec (15-600 au). after correcting fordetection biases, we derive a binary frequency (bf) in the logp (days) rangefrom 4.4 to 6.9 of 25.3 +/- 5.4%, which is similar to that of field g-typedwarfs (23.8%, duquennoy &amp; mayor 1991). this result, complemented by similarones obtained for the 2 myr old star forming cluster ic 348 (paper ii) and the120 myr old pleiades open cluster (paper i), indicates that the fraction oflong-period binaries does not significantly evolve over the lifetime ofgalactic open clusters. we compare the distribution of cluster binaries to thebinary populations of star forming regions, most notably orion and taurus, tocritically review current ideas regarding the binary formation process. weconclude that it is still unclear whether the lower binary fraction observed inyoung clusters compared to t associations is purely the result of the earlydynamical disruption of primordial binaries in dense clusters or whether itreflects intrinsically different modes of star formation in clusters andassociations. we also note that if taurus binaries result from the dynamicaldecay of small-n protostellar aggregates, one would predict the existence of ayet to be found dispersed population of mostly single substellar objects in thetaurus cloud.

astro-ph;0109327	visual binaries among high-mass stars - an adaptive optics survey of ob  stars in the ngc 6611 cluster	we have searched for visual binaries with projected separations in the range200-3000 au (0.1"-1.5") among a sample of 96 stars in the massive young ngc6611 cluster, 60 of them being subsequently identified as high probabilitycluster members of mainly ob spectral type. this is the first visual binarysurvey among such a large and homogeneous sample of high-mass stars. we find anuncorrected binary frequency of 18+/-6% over the surveyed separation range.considering only binaries with mass ratios q&gt;0.1, we find that ob stars in ngc6611 host more companions than solar-type field stars. we derive mass ratiosfor the detected binaries from their near-infrared flux ratios and concludethat about half of the detected binaries have q&lt;0.2, which does not contradictthe assumption that companion masses are randomly drawn from the initial massfunction. there is no evidence in our sample that wide-binary properties dependupon the mass of the primary star. the high frequency of massive binaries in acluster as rich as ngc 6611 and the lack of a strong mass dependence of theirproperties are difficult to reconcile with the scenario whereby massive starsform as the result of mergers of smaller stars. the canonical protostellaraccretion scenario together with cloud fragmentation, on the other hand, cannaturally explain most of the observed binary properties, although the veryhigh stellar density in the protocluster is likely to require significantmodification to that picture as well.

astro-ph;0112103	resolved near-infrared spectroscopy of the mysterious pre-main sequence  binary systems t tau s	we obtained new near-infrared images of the prototypical pre-main sequencetriple system t tau, as well as the first resolved medium-resolution spectra ofthe close pair t tau s. at the time of our observations, the tight binary had a13 au projected separation and showed significant motion since its discovery,three years before. the orbit cannot be strongly constrained yet, but theobserved motion of t tau sb with respect to t tau sa suggests that the systemis at least as massive as t tau n itself. this may indicate that t tau n is notthe most massive star in the system. the spectrum of t tau sa, which is totallyfeatureless except for a strong br gamma emission line, identifies thiscomponent with the ``infrared companion'', whose exact nature remains obscurebut may be the consequence of it being the most massive component of thesystem. contrasting sharply with t tau sa, the spectrum of t tau sb showsnumerous photospheric features consistent with an early-m spectral type. thepresence of a strong br gamma emission line and of a significant veilingcontinuum classifies this object as a deeply embedded t tauri star. from theseobservations, we conclude that both components of t tau s are embedded in theirown dense circumstellar cocoon of material, which are probably fed by a muchmore extended structure.

astro-ph;0204465	nicmos images of the gg tau circumbinary disk	we present deep, near-infrared images of the circumbinary disk surroundingthe pre-main-sequence binary star, gg tau a, obtained with nicmos aboard thehubble space telescope. the spatially resolved proto-planetary disk scattersroughly 1.5% of the stellar flux, with a near-to-far side flux ratio of ~1.4,independent of wavelength, and colors that are comparable to the centralsource; all of these properties are significantly different from the earlierground-based observations. new monte carlo scattering simulations of the diskemphasize that the general properties of the disk, such as disk flux, near sideto far side flux ratio and integrated colors, can be approximately reproducedusing ism-like dust grains, without the presence of either circumstellar disksor large dust grains, as had previously been suggested. a single parameterphase function is fitted to the observed azimuthal variation in disk flux,providing a lower limit on the median grain size of 0.23 micron. our analysis,in comparison to previous simulations, shows that the major limitation to thestudy of grain growth in t tauri disk systems through scattered light lies inthe uncertain ism dust grain properties. finally, we use the 9 year baseline ofastrometric measurements of the binary to solve the complete orbit, assumingthat the binary is coplanar with the circumbinary ring. we find that theestimated 1 sigma range on disk inner edge to semi-major axis ratio, 3.2 &lt;rin/a &lt; 6.7, is larger than that estimated by previous sph simulations ofbinary-disk interactions.

astro-ph;0212512	a layered edge-on circumstellar disk around hk tau b	we present the first high angular resolution 1.4mm and 2.7mm continuum mapsof the t tauri binary system hk tau obtained with the plateau de bureinterferometer. the contributions of both components are well disentangled at1.4mm and the star previously known to host an edge-on circumstellar disk, hktau b, is elongated along the disk's major axis. the optically bright primarydominates the thermal emission from the system at both wavelengths, confirmingthat it also has its own circumstellar disk. its non-detection in scatteredlight images indicates that the two disks in this binary system are notparallel. our data further indicate that the circumprimary disk is probablysignificantly smaller than the circumsecondary disk.  we model the millimeter thermal emission from the circumstellar disksurrounding hk tau b. we show that the disk mass derived from scattered lightimages cannot reproduce the 1.4mm emission using opacities of the samepopulation of submicron dust grains. however, grain growth alone cannot matchall the observed properties of this disk. we propose that this disk containsthree separate layers: two thin outer surfaces which contain dust grains thatare very similar to those of the ism, and a disk interior which is relativelymassive and/or has experienced limited grain growth with the largest grainssignificantly smaller than 1mm. such a structure could naturally result fromdust settling in a protoplanetary disk.

astro-ph;0302299	the first measurement of spectral lines in a short-period star bound to  the galaxy's central black hole: a paradox of youth	we have obtained the first detection of spectral absorption lines in one ofthe high-velocity stars in the vicinity of the galaxy's central supermassiveblack hole. both brgamma (2.1661 micron) and he i (2.1126 micron) are seen inabsorption in s0-2 with equivalent widths (2.8+-0.3 ang &amp; 1.7+-0.4 ang) and aninferred stellar rotational velocity (220+-40 km/s) that are consistent withthat of an o8-b0 dwarf, which suggests that it is a massive (~15 msun), young(&lt;10 myr) main sequence star. this presents a major challenge to star formationtheories, given the strong tidal forces that prevail over all distances reachedby s0-2 in its current orbit (130 - 1900 au) and the difficulty in migratingthis star inward during its lifetime from further out where tidal forces shouldno longer preclude star formation. the radial velocity measurements (-510+-40km/s) and our reported proper motions for s0-2 strongly constrain its orbit,providing a direct measure of the black hole mass of 4.1(+-0.6)x10^6(ro/8kpc)^3msun. the keplerian orbit parameters have uncertainities that are reduced by afactor of 2-3 compared to previously reported values and include, for the firsttime, an independent solution for the dynamical center; this location, whileconsistent with the nominal infrared position of sgr a*, is localized to afactor of 5 more precisely (+-2 milli-arcsec). furthermore, the ambiguity inthe inclination of the orbit is resolved with the addition of the radialvelocity measurement, indicating that the star is behind the black hole at thetime of closest approach and counter-revolving against the galaxy. with furtherradial velocity measurements in the next few years, the orbit of s0-2 willprovide the most robust estimate of the distance to the galactic center.

astro-ph;0303151	full three dimensional orbits for multiple stars on close approaches to  the central supermassive black hole	with the advent of adaptive optics on the w. m. keck 10 m telescope, twosignificant steps forward have been taken in building the case for asupermassive black hole at the center of the milky way and understanding theblack hole's effect on its environment. using adaptive optics and speckleimaging to study the motions of stars in the plane of sky with +-~2 masprecision over the past 7 years, we have obtained the first simultaneousorbital solution for multiple stars. among the included stars, three are newlyidentified (s0-16, s0-19, s0-20). the most dramatic orbit is that of the newlyidentified star s0-16, which passed a mere 60 au from the central dark mass ata velocity of 9,000 km/s in 1999. the orbital analysis results in a new centraldark mass estimate of 3.6(+-0.4)x10^6(d/8kpc)^3 mo. this dramaticallystrengthens the case for a black hole at the center of our galaxy, by confiningthe dark matter to within a radius of 0.0003 pc or 1,000 rsh and therebyincreasing the inferred dark mass density by four orders of magnitude comparedto earlier estimates.  with the introduction of an adaptive-optics-fed spectrometer, we haveobtained the spectra of these high-velocity stars, which suggest that they aremassive (~15 mo), young (&lt;10 myr) main sequence stars. this presents a majorchallenge to star formation theories, given the strong tidal forces thatprevail over all distances reached by these stars in their current orbits andthe difficulty in migrating these stars inward during their lifetime fromfurther out where tidal forces should no longer preclude star formation.

astro-ph;0306379	on the alignment of t tauri stars with the local magnetic field	magnetic field is believed to play an important role in the collapse of amolecular cloud. in particular, due to the properties of magnetic forces,collapse should be easier along magnetic field lines, as supported by thelarge-scale sheet-like structure of the taurus giant molecular cloud forinstance. here we investigate whether such a prefered orientation for collapseis present at a much smaller scale, that of individual objects. we use recenthigh-angular resolution images of t tauri stars located in the taurusstar-forming region to find the orientation of the symmetry axis of eachstar+jet+disk system and compare it to that of the local magnetic field. wefind that i) the orientations of the symmetry axis of t tauri stars are notrandom with respect to the magnetic field, and ii) that young stars that areassociated to a jet or an outflow are oriented very differently from thosewhich do not have a detected outflow. we present some implications of thispuzzling new result.

(abridged) the recent evidence obtained by briceno et al. that star-formationin taurus-auriga (ta) may be producing significantly fewer brown dwarfs (bds)per star than the onc is investigated by setting up a realistic model stellarplus bd population and explicitly taking into account a high binary proportionand dynamical evolution in the ta groups and the onc. the briceno result isreproduced almost exactly despite an identical imf in both systems because manybd-bd and star-bd binaries are disrupted in the onc thus freeing bds, while theta groups remain unevolved dynamically. however, the resulting populations donot have the correct star-star, star-bd and expecially bd-bd binary properties,even if a variable bd imf is allowed for. the conclusion is therefore that bdsneed to be added as a separate population which has its own binary properties.such an extra population can have various origins which are briefly discussedin this contribution but more fully in an associated paper.

astro-ph;0401560	a multi-wavelength scattered light analysis of the dust grain population  in the gg tau circumbinary ring	we present the first 3.8 micron image of the dusty ring surrounding the youngbinary system gg tau, obtained with the w. m. keck ii 10m telescope's adaptiveoptics system. this is the longest wavelength at which the ring has beendetected in scattered light so far, allowing a multi-wavelength analysis of thescattering properties of the dust grains present in this protoplanetary disk incombination with previous, shorter wavelengths, hst images. we find that thescattering phase function of the dust grains in the disk is only weaklydependent on the wavelength. this is inconsistent with dust models inferredfrom observations of the interstellar medium or dense molecular clouds. inparticular, the strongly forward-throwing scattering phase function observed at3.8 micron implies a significant increase in the population of large (&gt;~1micron) grains, which provides direct evidence for grain growth in the ring.however, the grain size distribution required to match the 3.8 micron image ofthe ring is incompatible with its published 1 micron polarization map, implyingthat the dust population is not uniform throughout the ring. we also show thatour 3.8 micron scattered light image probes a deeper layer of the ring thanprevious shorter wavelength images, as demonstrated by a shift in the locationof the inner edge of the disk's scattered light distribution between 1 and 3.8micron. we therefore propose a stratified structure for the ring in which thesurface layers, located ~50 au above the ring midplane, contain dust grainsthat are very similar to those found in dense molecular clouds, while theregion of the ring located ~25 au from the midplane contains significantlylarger grains. this stratified structure is likely the result of vertical dustsettling and/or preferred grain growth in the densest parts of the ring.

astro-ph;0503508	a contemporaneous infrared flash from a long gamma-ray burst: an echo  from the central engine	the explosion that results in a cosmic gamma-ray burst (grb) is thought toproduce emission from two physical processes -- the activity of the centralengine gives rise to the high-energy emission of the burst through internalshocking and the subsequent interaction of the flow with the externalenvironment produces long-wavelength afterglow. while afterglow observationscontinue to refine our understanding of grb progenitors and relativisticshocks, gamma-ray observations alone have not yielded a clear picture of theorigin of the prompt emission nor details of the central engine. only oneconcurrent visible-light transient has been found and was associated withemission from an external shock. here we report the discovery of infrared (ir)emission contemporaneous with a grb, beginning 7.2 minutes after the onset ofgrb 041219a. our robotic telescope acquired 21 images during the active phaseof the burst, yielding the earliest multi-colour observations of anylong-wavelength emission associated with a grb. analysis of an initial ir pulsesuggests an origin consistent with internal shocks. this opens a newpossibility to study the central engine of grbs with ground-based observationsat long wavelengths.

astro-ph;0504352	the circumstellar environment of t tau s at high spatial and spectral  resolution	we have obtained the first high spatial (0.05'') and spectral (r~35000)resolution 2 micron spectrum of the t tau s tight binary system using adaptiveoptics on the keck ii telescope. we have also obtained the first 3.8 and 4.7micron images that resolve the three components of the t tau multiple system,as well as new 1.6 and 2.2 micron images. together with its very rednear-infrared colors, the spectrum of t tau sb shows that this t tauri star isextincted by a roughly constant extinction of av~15 mag, which is probably the0.7''x0.5'' circumbinary structure recently observed in absorption in theultraviolet. t tau sa, which is also observed through this screen and isactively accreting, further possesses a small edge-on disk that is evidenced bywarm (390 k), narrow overtone co rovibrational absorption features in ourspectrum. we find that t tau sa is most likely an intermediate-mass starsurrounded by a semi-transparent 2-3 au-radius disk whose asymmetries and shortkeplerian rotation explain the large photometric variability of the source onrelatively short timescales. we also show that molecular hydrogen emissionexclusively arises from the gas that surrounds t tau s and that its spatial andkinematic structure, while providing suggestive evidence for a jet-likestructure, is highly complex.

astro-ph;0509728	investigating disk evolution: a high spatial resolution mid-infrared  survey of t tauri stars	we present a high spatial resolution, 10-20 micron survey of 65 t tauribinary stars in taurus, ophiuchus, and corona australis using the keck 10 mtelescopes. designed to probe the inner ~1 au region of the circumstellar disksaround the individual stellar components in these binary systems, this studyincreases the number of binaries with spatially resolved measurements at 10micron by a factor of ~5. combined with resolved near-infrared photometry andspectroscopic accretion diagnostics, we find that ~10% of stars with amid-infrared excess do not appear to be accreting. in contrast to an activelyaccreting disk system, these passive disks have significantly lowernear-infrared colors that are, in most cases, consistent with photosphericemission, suggesting the presence of an inner disk hole. in addition, thereappears to be a spectral type/mass dependence associated with the presence of apassive disk, with all passive disks occurring around m type stars. thepossibility that the passive disks are caused by the presence of an as yetundetected companion at a small separation (0.3-3 au) is possible for anyindividual system, however, it cannot account for the spectral type dependenceof the passive disk sample as a whole. we propose that these passive disksrepresent a subset of t tauri stars that are undergoing significant diskevolution. the fraction of observed passive disks and the observed spectraltype dependence can both be explained by models of disk evolution that includedisk photoevaporation from the central star.

astro-ph;0603004	new observational frontiers in the multiplicity of young stars	it has now been known for over a decade that low-mass stars located instar-forming regions are very frequently members of binary and multiplesystems, even more so than main sequence stars in the solar neighborhood. thishigh multiplicity rate has been interpreted as the consequence of thefragmentation of small molecular cores into a few seed objects that accrete totheir final mass from the remaining material and dynamically evolve into stablemultiple systems, possibly producing a few ejecta in the process. analyzing thestatistical properties of young multiple systems in a variety of environmentstherefore represents a powerful approach to place stringent constraints on starformation theories. in this contribution, we first review a number of recentresults related to the multiplicity of t tauri stars. we then present a seriesof studies focusing on the multiplicity and properties of optically-undetected,heavily embedded protostars. these objects are much younger than the previouslystudied pre-main sequence stars, and they therefore offer a closer look at theprimordial population of multiple systems. in addition to these observationalavenues, we present new results of a series of numerical simulations thatattempt to reproduce the fragmentation of small molecular cores into multiplesystems, and compare these results to the observations.

astro-ph;0608018	accurate stellar masses in the multiple system t tau	the goal of this study is to obtain accurate estimates for the individualmasses of the components of the tight binary system t tau s in order to settlethe ongoing debate on the nature of t tau sa, a so-called infrared companion.we take advantage of the fact that t tau s belongs to a triple system composedof two hierarchical orbits to simultaneously analyze the motion of t tau sb inthe rest frames of t tau sa and t tau n. with this method, it is possible topinpoint the location of the center of mass of t tau s and, thereby, todetermine individual masses for t tau sa and t tau sb with no prior assumptionabout the mass/flux ratio of the system. this improvement over previous studiesof the system results in much better constraints on orbital parameters. we findindividual masses of 2.73+/-0.31 msun for t tau sa and of 0.61+/-0.17 msun fort tau sb (in agreement with its early-m spectral type), including theuncertainty on the distance to the system. these are among the most preciseestimates of the mass of any pre-main sequence star, a remarkable result sincethis is the first system in which individual masses of t tauri stars can bedetermined from astrometry only. this model-independent analysis confirms thatt tau sa is an intermediate-mass star, presumably a very young herbig ae star,that may possess an almost edge-on disk.

astro-ph;0701551	measuring the mass of a pre-main sequence binary star through the orbit  of twa 5a	we present the results of a five year monitoring campaign of the close binarytwa 5aab in the tw hydrae association, using speckle and adaptive optics on thew.m. keck 10 m telescopes. these measurements were taken as part of our ongoingmonitoring of pre-main sequence (pms) binaries in an effort to increase thenumber of dynamically determined pms masses and thereby calibrate thetheoretical pms evolutionary tracks. our observations have allowed us to obtainthe first determination of this system's astrometric orbit. we find an orbitalperiod of 5.94 +- 0.09 years and a semi-major axis of 0.066" +- 0.005".combining these results with a kinematic distance, we calculate a total mass of0.71 +- 0.14 m_sun (d/44 pc)^3. for this system. this mass measurement, as wellas the estimated age of this system, are consistent to within 2$\sigma$ of alltheoretical models considered. in this analysis, we properly account forcorrelated uncertainties, and show that while these correlations are generallyignored, they increase the formal uncertainties by up to a factor of five andtherefore are important to incorporate. with only a few more years ofobservation, this type of measurement will allow the theoretical models to bedistinguished.

astro-ph;0703567	new very low mass binaries in the taurus star-forming region	we surveyed thirteen very low mass (vlm; m &lt; 0.2 m_sun) objects in the taurusstar-forming region using near-infrared diffraction-limited imaging techniqueson the w.m. keck i 10 m telescope. of these thirteen, five were found to bebinary, with separations ranging from 0.04" to 0.6" and flux ratios from 1.4 to3.7. in all cases, the companions are likely to be physically associated withthe primaries (probability &gt; 4-sigma). using the theoretical models of baraffeet al. (1998), we find that all five new companions, as well as one of theprimaries, are likely brown dwarfs. the discovery of these systems thereforeincreases the total number of known, young vlm binaries by ~50%. these newsystems, along with other young vlm binaries from the literature, haveproperties that differ significantly from older field vlm binaries in that theyoung systems have wider separations and lower mass ratios, supporting the ideathat vlm binaries undergo significant dynamical evolution ~5 - 10 myr aftertheir formation. the range of separations of these binaries, four of which areover 30 au, argues against the ejection scenario of brown dwarf formation.while several of the young, vlm binaries discovered in this study have lowerbinding energies than the previously suggested minimum for vlm binaries, theapparent minimum is still significantly higher than that found among highermass binaries. we suggest that this discrepancy may be due to the small mass ofa vlm binary relative to the average perturbing star, leading to moresubstantial changes in their binding energy over time.
