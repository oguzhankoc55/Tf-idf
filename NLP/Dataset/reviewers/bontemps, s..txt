0903.1369	atlasgal - the apex telescope large area survey of the galaxy at 870  microns	(abridged) studying continuum emission from interstellar dust is essential tolocating and characterizing the highest density regions in the interstellarmedium. in particular, the early stages of massive star formation remain poorlyunderstood. our goal is to produce a large-scale, systematic database ofmassive pre- and proto-stellar clumps in the galaxy, to understand how andunder what conditions star formation takes place. a well characterized sampleof star-forming sites will deliver an evolutionary sequence and a mass functionof high-mass, star-forming clumps. this systematic survey at submm wavelengthsalso represents a preparatory work for herschel and alma. the apex telescope isideally located to observe the inner milky way. the large apex bolometer camera(laboca) is a 295-element bolometer array observing at 870 microns, with a beamsize of 19". taking advantage of its large field of view (11.4') and excellentsensitivity, we started an unbiased survey of the galactic plane, with a noiselevel of 50-70 mjy/beam: the apex telescope large area survey of the galaxy(atlasgal). as a first step, we covered 95 sq. deg. these data reveal 6000compact sources brighter than 0.25 jy, as well as extended structures, many ofthem filamentary. about two thirds of the compact sources have no brightinfrared counterpart, and some of them are likely to correspond to theprecursors of (high-mass) proto-stars or proto-clusters. other compact sourcesharbor hot cores, compact hii regions or young embedded clusters. assuming atypical distance of 5 kpc, most sources are clumps smaller than 1 pc withmasses from a few 10 to a few 100 m_sun. in this introductory paper, we showpreliminary results from these ongoing observations, and discuss theperspectives of the survey.

0909.2315	fragmentation and mass segregation in the massive dense cores of cygnus  x	we present plateau de bure interferometer observations obtained in continuumat 1.3 and 3.5 mm towards the six most massive and young (ir-quiet) dense coresin cygnus x. located at only 1.7 kpc, the cygnus x region offers theopportunity of reaching small enough scales (of the order of 1700 au at 1.3 mm)to separate individual collapsing objects. the cores are sub-fragmented with atotal of 23 fragments inside 5 cores. only the most compact core, cygx-n63,could actually be a single massive protostar with an envelope mass as large as60 msun. the fragments in the other cores have sizes and separations similar tolow-mass pre-stellar and proto-stellar condensations in nearby protoclusters,and are probably of the same nature. a total of 9 out of these 23 protostellarobjects are found to be probable precursors of ob stars with envelope massesranging from 6 to 23 msun. the level of fragmentation is globally higher thanin the turbulence regulated, monolithic collapse scenario, but is not as highas expected in a pure gravo-turbulent scenario where the distribution of massis dominated by low-mass protostars/stars. here, the fractions of the totalcore masses in the high-mass fragments are reaching values as high as 28, 44,and 100 % in cygx-n12, cygx-n53, and cygx-n63, respectively, much higher thanwhat an imf-like mass distribution would predict. the increase of thefragmentation efficiency as a function of density in the cores is proposed tobe due to the increasing importance of self-gravity leading to gravitationalcollapse at the scale of the dense cores. at the same time, the cores tend tofragment into a few massive protostars within their central regions. we aretherefore probably witnessing here the primordial mass segregation of clustersin formation.

1001.0978	the mass distributions of starless and protostellar cores in gould belt  clouds	using data from the scuba legacy catalogue (850 um) and spitzer spacetelescope (3.6 - 70 um), we explore dense cores in the ophiuchus, taurus,perseus, serpens, and orion molecular clouds. we develop a new method todiscriminate submillimeter cores found by scuba as starless or protostellar,using point source photometry from spitzer wide field surveys. first, weidentify infrared sources with red colors associated with embedded youngstellar objects (ysos). second, we compare the positions of theseyso-candidates to our submillimeter cores. with these identifications, weconstruct new, self-consistent starless and protostellar core mass functions(cmfs) for the five clouds. we find best fit slopes to the high-mass end of thecmfs of -1.26 +/- 0.20, -1.22 +/- 0.06, -0.95 +/- 0.20, and -1.67 +/- 0.72 forophiuchus, taurus, perseus, and orion, respectively. broadly, these slopes areeach consistent with the -1.35 power-law slope of the salpeter imf at highermasses, but suggest some differences. we examine a variety of trends betweenthese cmf shapes and their parent cloud properties, potentially finding acorrelation between the high-mass slope and core temperature. we also find atrend between core mass and effective size, but we are very limited bysensitivity. we make similar comparisons between core mass and size with visualextinction (for a_v &gt;= 3) and find no obvious trends. we also predict thenumbers and mass distributions of cores that future surveys with scuba-2 maydetect in each of these clouds.

1001.2453	the link between molecular cloud structure and turbulence	we aim to better understand how the spatial structure of molecular clouds isgoverned by turbulence. for that, we study the large-scale spatial distributionof low density molecular gas and search for characteristic length scales. weemploy a 35 square degrees 13co 1-0 molecular line survey of cygnus x andvisual extinction (a_v) maps of 17 galactic clouds to analyse the spatialstructure using the delta-variance method. this sample contains a large varietyof different molecular cloud types with different star forming activity. thedelta-variance spectra obtained from the a_v maps show differences betweenlow-mass star-forming (sf) clouds and massive giant molecular clouds (gmc) interms of shape of the spectrum and its power-law exponent beta. low-mass sfclouds have a double-peak structure with characteristic size scales around 1 pc(though with a large scatter around this value) and 4 pc. gmcs show nocharacteristic scale in the a_v-maps, which can partly be ascribed to adistance effect due to a larger line-of-sight (los) confusion. thedelta-variance for cygnus, determined from the 13co survey, showscharacteristic scales at 4 pc and 40 pc, either reflecting the filamentstructure and large-scale turbulence forcing or - for the 4 pc scale - thescale below which the 13co 1-0 line becomes optically thick. though there aredifferent processes that can introduce characteristic scales, i.e. geometry,decaying turbulence the transition scale from supersonic to subsonic turbulence(the sonic scale), line-of-sight effects and energy injection due to expandingsupernova shells, outflows, hii-regions, and the relative contribution of theseeffects strongly varies from cloud to cloud, it is remarkable that theresulting turbulent structure of molecular clouds shows similarcharacteristics.

1003.3222	molecular and atomic gas in the local group galaxy m33	we present high resolution large scale observations of the molecular andatomic gas in the local group galaxy m33. the observations were carried outusing the hera at the 30m iram telescope in the co(2-1) line achieving aresolution of 12"x2.6 km/s, enabling individual gmcs to be resolved. theobserved region mainly along the major axis out to a radius of 8.5 kpc, andcovers the strip observed with hifi/pacs spectrometers as part of the herm33esherschel key program. the achieved sensitivity in main beam temperature is20-50 mk at 2.6 km/s velocity resolution. the co(2-1) luminosity of theobserved region is 1.7\pm0.1x10^7 kkm/s pc^2, corresponding to h2 masses of1.9x10^8 msun (including he), calculated with a nh2/ico twice the galacticvalue due to the half-solar metallicity of m33. hi 21 cm vla archiveobservations were reduced and the mosaic was imaged and cleaned using themulti-scale task in casa, yielding a series of datacubes with resolutionsranging from 5" to 25". the hi mass within a radius of 8.5 kpc is estimated tobe 1.4x10^9 msun. the azimuthally averaged co surface brightness decreasesexponentially with a scale length of 1.9\pm0.1 kpc whereas the atomic gassurface density is constant at sigma_hi=6\pm2 msun/pc^2 deprojected to face-on.the central kiloparsec h_2 surface density is sigma_h2=8.5\pm0.2 msun/pc^2. thestar formation rate per unit molecular gas (sf efficiency, the rate oftransformation of molecular gas into stars), as traced by the ratio of co tohalpha and fir brightness, is constant with radius. the sfe appears 2-4 timesgreater than of large spiral galaxies. a morphological comparison of molecularand atomic gas with tracers of star formation shows good agreement betweenthese maps both in terms of peaks and holes. a few exceptions are noted.several spectra, including those of a molecular cloud situated more than 8 kpcfrom the galaxy center, are presented.

1003.4198	dynamic star formation in the massive dr21 filament	the formation of massive stars is a highly complex process in which it is notclear whether the star-forming gas is in global gravitational collapse or in anequilibrium state, supported by turbulence. by studying one of the most massiveand dense star-forming regions in the galaxy at a distance of less than 3 kpc,the filament containing the well-known sources dr21 and dr21(oh), we expect tofind observational signatures that allow to discriminate between the two views.we use molecular line data from our 13co 1-0, cs 2-1, and n2h+ 1-0 survey ofthe cygnus x region obtained with the fcrao and high-angular resolutionobservations of co, cs, hco+, n2h+, and h2co, obtained with the iram 30mtelescope. we observe a complex velocity field and velocity dispersion in thedr21 filament in which regions of highest column-density, i.e. dense cores,have a lower velocity dispersion than the surrounding gas and velocitygradients that are not (only) due to rotation. infall signatures in opticallythick line profiles of hco+ and 12co are observed along and across the wholedr21 filament. from modelling the observed spectra, we obtain a typical infallspeed of 0.6 km/s and mass accretion rates of the order of a few 10^-3 msun/yrfor the two main clumps constituting the filament. these massive (4900 and 3300msun) clumps are both gravitationally contracting. all observed kinematicfeatures in the dr21 filament can be explained if it is formed by theconvergence of flows at large scales and is now in a state of globalgravitational collapse. whether this convergence of flows originated fromself-gravity at larger scales or from other processes can not be settled withthe present study. the observed velocity field and velocity dispersion areconsistent with results from (magneto)-hydrodynamic simulations where the coreslie at the stagnation points of convergent turbulent flows.

1005.1615	star formation triggered by the galactic hii region rcw 120: first  results from the herschel space observatory	by means of different physical mechanisms, the expansion of hii regions canpromote the formation of new stars of all masses. rcw 120 is a nearby galactichii region where triggered star formation occurs. this region is well-studied -there being a wealth of existing data - and is nearby. however, it issurrounded by dense regions for which far infrared data is essential to obtainan unbiased view of the star formation process and in particular to establishwhether very young protostars are present. we attempt to identify all youngstellar objects (ysos), especially those previously undetected at shorterwavelengths, to derive their physical properties and obtain insight into thestar formation history in this region. we use herschel-pacs and -spire imagesto determine the distribution of ysos observed in the field. we use a spectralenergy distribution fitting tool to derive the ysos physical properties.herschel-pacs and -spire images confirm the existence of a young source andallow us to determine its nature as a high-mass (8-10 msun) class 0 object(whose emission is dominated by a massive envelope) towards the massivecondensation 1 observed at (sub)-millimeter wavelengths. this source was notdetected at 24 micron and only barely seen in the mispgal 70 micron data.several other red sources are detected at herschel wavelengths and coincidewith the peaks of the millimeter condensations. sed fitting results for thebrightest herschel sources indicate that, apart from the massive class 0 thatforms in condensation 1, young low mass stars are forming around rcw 120. theysos observed on the borders of rcw 120 are younger than its ionizing star,which has an age of about 2.5 myr.

1005.2031	origin of the hot gas in low-mass protostars: herschel-pacs spectroscopy  of hh 46	'water in star-forming regions with herschel' (wish) is a herschel keyprogramme aimed at understanding the physical and chemical structure of youngstellar objects (ysos) with a focus on water and related species. the low-massprotostar hh 46 was observed with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs) on the herschel space observatory to measure emission inh2o, co, oh, [oi], and [cii] lines located between 63 and 186 um. theexcitation and spatial distribution of emission can disentangle the differentheating mechanisms of ysos, with better spatial resolution and sensitivity thanpreviously possible. far-ir line emission is detected at the position of theprotostar and along the outflow axis. the oh emission is concentrated at thecentral position, co emission is bright at the central position and along theoutflow, and h2o emission is concentrated in the outflow. in addition, [oi]emission is seen in low-velocity gas, assumed to be related to the envelope,and is also seen shifted up to 170 km/s in both the red- and blue-shifted jets.envelope models are constructed based on previous observational constraints.they indicate that passive heating of a spherical envelope by the protostellarluminosity cannot explain the high-excitation molecular gas detected with pacs,including co lines with upper levels at &gt;2500 k above the ground state.instead, warm co and h2o emission is probably produced in the walls of anoutflow-carved cavity in the envelope, which are heated by uv photons andnon-dissociative c-type shocks. the bright oh and [oi] emission is attributedto j-type shocks in dense gas close to the protostar. in the scenario describedhere, the combined cooling by far-ir lines within the central spatial pixel isestimated to be 2 \times 10-2 l_sun, with 60-80% attributed to j- and c-typeshocks produced by interactions between the jet and the envelope.

1005.2618	from filamentary clouds to prestellar cores to the stellar imf: initial  highlights from the herschel gould belt survey	we summarize the first results from the gould belt survey, obtained towardthe aquila rift and polaris flare regions during the 'science demonstrationphase' of herschel. our 70-500 micron images taken in parallel mode with thespire and pacs cameras reveal a wealth of filamentary structure, as well asnumerous dense cores embedded in the filaments. between ~ 350 and 500prestellar cores and ~ 45-60 class 0 protostars can be identified in the aquilafield, while ~ unbound starless cores and no protostars are observed in thepolaris field. the prestellar core mass function (cmf) derived for the aquilaregion bears a strong resemblance to the stellar initial mass function (imf),already confirming the close connection between the cmf and the imf with muchbetter statistics than earlier studies. comparing and contrasting our herschelresults in aquila and polaris, we propose an observationally-driven scenariofor core formation according to which complex networks of long, thin filamentsform first within molecular clouds, and then the densest filaments fragmentinto a number of prestellar cores via gravitational instability.

1005.3115	filamentary structures and compact objects in the aquila and polaris  clouds observed by herschel	our pacs and spire images of the aquila rift and part of the polaris flareregions, taken during the science demonstration phase of herschel discoveredfascinating, omnipresent filamentary structures that appear to be physicallyrelated to compact cores. we briefly describe a new multi-scale,multi-wavelength source extraction method used to detect objects and measuretheir parameters in our herschel images. all of the extracted starless cores(541 in aquila and 302 in polaris) appear to form in the long and very narrowfilaments. with its combination of the far-ir resolution and sensitivity,herschel directly reveals the filaments in which the dense cores are embedded;the filaments are resolved and have deconvolved widths of 35 arcsec in aquilaand 59 arcsec in polaris (9000 au in both regions). our first results ofobservations with herschel enable us to suggest that in general dense cores mayoriginate in a process of fragmentation of complex networks of long, thinfilaments, likely formed as a result of an interplay between gravity,interstellar turbulence, and magnetic fields. to unravel the roles of theprocesses, one has to obtain additional kinematic and polarization information;these follow-up observations are planned.

1005.3118	herschel observations of embedded protostellar clusters in the rosette  molecular cloud	the herschel ob young stellar objects survey (hobys) has observed the rosettemolecular cloud, providing an unprecedented view of its star formationactivity. these new far-infrared data reveal a population of compact youngstellar objects whose physical properties we aim to characterise. we compiled asample of protostars and their spectral energy distributions that covers thenear-infrared to submillimetre wavelength range. these were used to constrainkey properties in the protostellar evolution, bolometric luminosity, andenvelope mass and to build an evolutionary diagram. several clusters aredistinguished including the cloud centre, the embedded clusters in the vicinityof luminous infrared sources, and the interaction region. the analysedprotostellar population in rosette ranges from 0.1 to about 15 msun withluminosities between 1 and 150 lsun, which extends the evolutionary diagramfrom low-mass protostars into the high-mass regime. some sources lackcounterparts at near- to mid-infrared wavelengths, indicating extreme youth.the central cluster and the phelps &amp; lada 7 cluster appear less evolved thanthe remainder of the analysed protostellar population. for the central cluster,we find indications that about 25% of the protostars classified as class i fromnear- to mid-infrared data are actually candidate class 0 objects. as ashowcase for protostellar evolution, we analysed four protostars of low- tointermediate-mass in a single dense core, and they represent differentevolutionary stages from class 0 to class i. their mid- to far-infraredspectral slopes flatten towards the class i stage, and the 160 to 70um fluxratio is greatest for the presumed class 0 source. this shows that the herschelobservations characterise the earliest stages of protostellar evolution indetail.

1005.3924	the herschel view of star formation in the rosette molecular cloud under  the influence of ngc 2244	the rosette molecular cloud is promoted as the archetype of a triggeredstar-formation site. this is mainly due to its morphology, because the centralob cluster ngc 2244 has blown a circular-shaped cavity into the cloud and theexpanding hii-region now interacts with the cloud. studying the spatialdistribution of the different evolutionary states of all star-forming sites inrosette and investigating possible gradients of the dust temperature will helpto test the 'triggered star-formation' scenario in rosette. we use continuumdata obtained with the pacs (70 and 160 micron) and spire instruments (250,350, 500 micron) of the herschel telescope during the science demonstrationphase of hobys. three-color images of rosette impressively show how themolecular gas is heated by the radiative impact of the ngc 2244 cluster. aclear negative temperature gradient and a positive density gradient (runningfrom the hii-region/molecular cloud interface into the cloud) are detected.studying the spatial distribution of the most massive dense cores (size scale0.05 to 0.3 pc), we find an age-sequence (from more evolved to younger) withincreasing distance to the cluster ngc 2244. no clear gradient is found for theclump (size-scale up to 1 pc) distribution. the existence of temperature anddensity gradients and the observed age-sequence imply that star formation inrosette may indeed be influenced by the radiative impact of the central ngc2244 cluster. a more complete overview of the prestellar and protostellarpopulation in rosette is required to obtain a firmer result.

1005.4517	water cooling of shocks in protostellar outflows: herschel-pacs map of  l1157	in the framework of the water in star-forming regions with herschel (wish)key program, maps in water lines of several outflows from young stars are beingobtained, to study the water production in shocks and its role in the outflowcooling. this paper reports the first results of this program, presenting apacs map of the o-h2o 179 um transition obtained toward the young outflowl1157. the 179 um map is compared with those of other important shock tracers,and with previous single-pointing iso, swas, and odin water observations of thesame source that allow us to constrain the water abundance and total cooling.strong h2o peaks are localized on both shocked emission knots and the centralsource position. the h2o 179 um emission is spatially correlated with emissionfrom h2 rotational lines, excited in shocks leading to a significantenhancement of the water abundance. water emission peaks along the outflow alsocorrelate with peaks of other shock-produced molecular species, such as sio andnh3. a strong h2o peak is also observed at the location of the proto-star,where none of the other molecules have significant emission. the absolute 179um intensity and its intensity ratio to the h2o 557 ghz line previouslyobserved with odin/swas indicate that the water emission originates in warmcompact clumps, spatially unresolved by pacs, having a h2o abundance of theorder of 10^-4. this testifies that the clumps have been heated for a time longenough to allow the conversion of almost all the available gas-phase oxygeninto water. the total water cooling is ~10^-1 lo, about 40% of the cooling dueto h2 and 23% of the total energy released in shocks along the l1157 outflow.

1007.1248	water vapor toward starless cores: the herschel view	swas and odin provided stringent upper limits on the gas phase waterabundance of dark clouds (x(h2o) &lt; 7x10^-9). we investigate the chemistry ofwater vapor in starless cores beyond the previous upper limits using the highlyimproved angular resolution and sensitivity of herschel and measure theabundance of water vapor during evolutionary stages just preceding starformation. high spectral resolution observations of the fundamental ortho water(o-h2o) transition (557 ghz) were carried out with herschel hifi toward twostarless cores: b68, a bok globule, and l1544, a prestellar core embedded inthe taurus molecular cloud complex. the rms in the brightness temperaturemeasured for the b68 and l1544 spectra is 2.0 and 2.2 mk, respectively, in avelocity bin of 0.59 km s^-1. the continuum level is 3.5+/-0.2 mk in b68 and11.4+/-0.4 mk in l1544. no significant feature is detected in b68 and the 3sigma upper limit is consistent with a column density of o-h2o n(o-h2o) &lt;2.5x10^13 cm^-2, or a fractional abundance x(o-h2o) &lt; 1.3x10^-9, more than anorder of magnitude lower than the swas upper limit on this source. the l1544spectrum shows an absorption feature at a 5 sigma level from which we obtainthe first value of the o-h2o column density ever measured in dark clouds:n(o-h2o) = (8+/-4)x10^12 cm^-2. the corresponding fractional abundance isx(o-h2o) ~ 5x10^-9 at radii &gt; 7000 au and ~2x10^-10 toward the center. theradiative transfer analysis shows that this is consistent with a x(o-h2o)profile peaking at ~10^-8, 0.1 pc away from the core center, where bothfreeze-out and photodissociation are negligible. herschel has provided thefirst measurement of water vapor in dark regions. prestellar cores such asl1544 (with their high central densities, strong continuum, and largeenvelopes) are very promising tools to finally shed light on the solid/vaporbalance of water in molecular clouds.

1007.3408	herschel-hifi detections of hydrides towards afgl 2591 (envelope  emission versus tenuous cloud absorption)	the heterodyne instrument for the far infrared (hifi) onboard the herschelspace observatory allows the first observations of light diatomic molecules athigh spectral resolution and in multiple transitions. here, we report deepintegrations using hifi in different lines of hydrides towards the high-massstar forming region afgl 2591. detected are ch, ch+, nh, oh+, h2o+, while nh+and sh+ have not been detected. all molecules except for ch and ch+ are seen inabsorption with low excitation temperatures and at velocities different fromthe systemic velocity of the protostellar envelope. surprisingly, the ch(jf,p =3/2_2,- - 1/2_1,+) and ch+(j = 1 - 0, j = 2 - 1) lines are detected in emissionat the systemic velocity. we can assign the absorption features to a foregroundcloud and an outflow lobe, while the ch and ch+ emission stems from theenvelope. the observed abundance and excitation of ch and ch+ can be explainedin the scenario of fuv irradiated outflow walls, where a cavity etched out bythe outflow allows protostellar fuv photons to irradiate and heat the envelopeat larger distances driving the chemical reactions that produce thesemolecules.

1007.3986	water in massive star-forming regions: hifi observations of w3 irs5	we present herschel observations of the water molecule in the massivestar-forming region w3 irs5. the o-h17o 110-101, p-h18o 111-000, p-h2o 22202-111, p-h2o 111-000, o-h2o 221-212, and o-h2o 212-101 lines, covering afrequency range from 552 up to 1669 ghz, have been detected at high spectralresolution with hifi. the water lines in w3 irs5 show well-definedhigh-velocity wings that indicate a clear contribution by outflows. moreover,the systematically blue-shifted absorption in the h2o lines suggests expansion,presumably driven by the outflow. no infall signatures are detected. the p-h2o111-000 and o-h2o 212-101 lines show absorption from the cold material (t ~ 10k) in which the high-mass protostellar envelope is embedded. one-dimensionalradiative transfer models are used to estimate water abundances and to furtherstudy the kinematics of the region. we show that the emission in the rareisotopologues comes directly from the inner parts of the envelope (t &gt; 100 k)where water ices in the dust mantles evaporate and the gas-phase abundanceincreases. the resulting jump in the water abundance (with a constant innerabundance of 10^{-4}) is needed to reproduce the o-h17o 110-101 and p-h18o111-000 spectra in our models. we estimate water abundances of 10^{-8} to10^{-9} in the outer parts of the envelope (t &lt; 100 k). the possibility of twoprotostellar objects contributing to the emission is discussed.

0708.2774	the earliest phases of high-mass star formation: a 3 square degree  millimeter continuum mapping of cygnus x	we have made an extensive 1.2mm continuum mosaicing study of the cygnus xmolecular cloud complex using the mambo cameras at the iram 30 m telescope. wethen compared our mm maps with mid-ir images, and have made sio(2-1) follow-upobservations of the best candidate progenitors of high-mass stars. our completestudy of cygnus x provides, for the first time, an unbiased census of massiveyoung stellar objects. we discover 129 massive dense cores, among which 42 areprobable precursors of high-mass stars. our study qualifies 17 cores as goodcandidates for hosting massive ir-quiet protostars, while up to 25 corespotentially host high-luminosity ir protostars. we fail to discover thehigh-mass analogs of pre-stellar dense cores in cygnusx, but find severalmassive starless clumps that might be gravitationally bound. since our sampleis derived from a single molecular complex and covers every embedded phase ofhigh-mass star formation, it gives the first statistical estimates of theirlifetime. in contrast to what is found for low-mass class 0 and class i phases,the ir-quiet protostellar phase of high-mass stars may last as long as theirbetter-known high-luminosity ir phase. the statistical lifetimes of high-massprotostars and pre-stellar cores (~ 3 x 10^4 yr and &lt; 10^3 yr) in cygnus x areone and two order(s) of magnitude smaller, respectively, than what is found innearby, low-mass star-forming regions. we therefore propose that high-masspre-stellar and protostellar cores are in a highly dynamic state, as expectedin a molecular cloud where turbulent processes dominate.

1008.1254	herschel-hifi spectroscopy of the intermediate mass protostar ngc7129  firs 2	herschel-hifi observations of water from the intermediate mass protostarngc7129 firs 2 provide a powerful diagnostic of the physical conditions in thisstar formation environment. six spectral settings, covering four h216o and twoh218o lines, were observed and all but one h218o line were detected. the fourh2 16 o lines discussed here share a similar morphology: a narrower, \approx 6km/s, component centered slightly redward of the systemic velocity of ngc7129firs 2 and a much broader, \approx 25 km/s component centered blueward andlikely associated with powerful outflows. the narrower components areconsistent with emission from water arising in the envelope around theintermediate mass protostar, and the abundance of h2o is constrained to \approx10-7 for the outer envelope. additionally, the presence of a narrowself-absorption component for the lowest energy lines is likely due toself-absorption from colder water in the outer envelope. the broader component,where the h2o/co relative abundance is found to be \approx 0.2, appears to betracing the same energetic region that produces strong co emission at high j.

1009.0598	gas dynamics in massive dense cores in cygnus-x	we study the kinematic properties of dense gas surrounding massive protostarsrecognized by bontemps et a. (2010) in a sample of five massive dense cores incygnus-x. we investigate whether turbulent support plays a major role instabilizing the core against fragmentation into jeans-mass objects oralternatively, the observed kinematics could indicate a high level of dynamics.we present iram 30m single-dish (hco+ and h13co+) and iram pdbi highangular-resolution observations of dense gas tracers (h13co+ and h13cn) toreveal the kinematics of molecular gas at scales from 0.03 to 0.1 pc. radiativetransfer modeling shows that h13co+ is depleted within the envelopes of massiveprotostars and traces the bulk of material surrounding the protostars ratherthan their inner envelopes. h13cn shows a better correspondence with the peakof the continuum emission, possibly due to abundance anomalies and specificchemistry in the close vicinity of massive protostars. analyzing theline-widths we show that the observed line-dispersion of h13co+ at the scale ofmdcs is smaller than expected from the quasi-static, turbulent-core model. atlarge-scales, global organized bulk motions are identified for 3 of the mdcs.at small-scales, several spectral components are identified in all mdcs showingfilamentary structures and intrinsic velocity gradients towards the continuumpeaks. the dynamics of these flows show diversity among the sample and we linkthis to the specific fragmentation properties of the mdcs. no clear evidence isfound for a turbulence regulated, equilibrium scenario within the sample ofmdcs. we propose a picture in which mdcs are not in equilibrium and theirdynamics is governed by small-scale converging flows, which may initiatestar-formation via their shears.

1102.3460	w43: the closest molecular complex of the galactic bar?	we used a large database extracted from galaxy-wide surveys of h {\scriptsizei}, $^{13}$co 1-0, $8 \micron$ and $870 \micron$ continuum to trace diffuseatomic gas, low- to medium-density molecular gas, high-density molecular gas,and star formation activity which we complemented by dedicated $^{12}$co 2--1,3--2 observations of the w43 region. from the detailed 3d(space-space-velocity) analysis of the molecular and atomic cloud tracersthrough the region and despite its wide velocity range (\emph{fwhm}$\sim22.3\kms$ around $\vlsr\sim 95.9 \kms$), we identified w43 as a large (equivalentdiameter $\sim 140$ pc) and coherent complex of molecular clouds which issurrounded by an atomic gas envelope (equivalent diameter $\sim 290$ pc). wemeasured the total mass of this newly-identified molecular complex ($m_{{\tinytotal}}\sim 7.1 \times 10^6 \msun$), the mass contained in dense $870 \micron$clumps ($&lt;5$ pc dense cloud structures, $m_{{\tiny clumps}}\sim 8.4 \times 10^5\msun$) and conclude that w43 is particularly massive and concentrated. thedistance we assume for the w43 complex is 6 kpc from the sun, which may placeit at the meeting point of the scutum-centaurus (or scutum-crux) galactic armand the bar, a dynamically complex region where high-velocity streams couldeasily collide. the star formation rate of w43 is suggested not to be steadybut it is increasing from $\, \sim 0.01 \msun\, {yr}^{-1}$ (measured from its$8\,\mu$m luminosity) to $\sim 0.1 \msun\, {yr}^{-1}$ (measured from itsmolecular content). from the global properties of w43, we claim it is anextreme molecular complex in the milky way and it could even be formingstarburst clusters in the near future.

1103.0201	characterizing interstellar filaments with herschel in ic5146	we provide a first look at the results of the herschel gould belt surveytoward the ic5146 molecular cloud and present a preliminary analysis of thefilamentary structure in this region. the column density map, derived from our70-500 micron herschel data, reveals a complex network of filaments, andconfirms that these filaments are the main birth sites of prestellar cores. weanalyze the column density profiles of 27 filaments and show that theunderlying radial density profiles fall off as r^{-1.5} to r^{-2.5} at largeradii. our main result is that the filaments seem to be characterized by anarrow distribution of widths having a median value of 0.10 +- 0.03 pc, whichis in stark contrast to a much broader distribution of central jeans lengths.this characteristic width of ~0.1 pc corresponds to within a factor of ~2 tothe sonic scale below which interstellar turbulence becomes subsonic in diffusegas, supporting the argument that the filaments may form as a result of thedissipation of large-scale turbulence.

0710.0827	multiple protostellar systems. ii. a high resolution near-infrared  imaging survey in nearby star-forming regions	(abridged) our project endeavors to obtain a robust view of multiplicityamong embedded class i and flat spectrum protostars in a wide array of nearbymolecular clouds to disentangle ``universal'' from cloud-dependent processes.we have used near-infrared adaptive optics observations at the vlt through theh, ks and l' filters to search for tight companions to 45 class i and flatspectrum protostars located in 4 different molecular clouds (taurus-auriga,ophiuchus, serpens and l1641 in orion). we complemented these observations withpublished high-resolution surveys of 13 additional objects in taurus andophiuchus. we found multiplicity rates of 32+/-6% and 47+/-8% over the 45-1400au and 14-1400 au separation ranges, respectively. these rates are in excellentagreement with those previously found among t tauri stars in taurus andophiuchus, and represent an excess of a factor ~1.7 over the multiplicity rateof solar-type field stars. we found no non-hierarchical triple systems, nor anyquadruple or higher-order systems. no significant cloud-to-cloud difference hasbeen found, except for the fact that all companions to low-mass orionprotostars are found within 100 au of their primaries whereas companions foundin other clouds span the whole range probed here. based on this survey, weconclude that core fragmentation always yields a high initial multiplicityrate, even in giant molecular clouds such as the orion cloud or in clusteredstellar populations as in serpens, in contrast with predictions of numericalsimulations. the lower multiplicity rate observed in clustered class ii andclass iii populations can be accounted for by a universal set of properties foryoung systems and subsequent ejections through close encounters with unrelatedcluster members.

1203.5721	the dust properties of bubble hii regions as seen by herschel	because of their relatively simple morphology, "bubble" hii regions have beeninstrumental to our understanding of star formation triggered by hii regions.with the far-infrared (fir) spectral coverage of the herschel satellite, we canaccess the wavelengths where these regions emit the majority of their energythrough their dust emission. at herschel wavelengths 70 micron to 500 micron,the emission associated with hii regions is dominated by the cool dust in theirphotodissociation regions (pdrs). we find average dust temperatures of 26kalong the pdrs, with little variation between the hii regions in the sample,while local filaments and infrared dark clouds average 19k and 15krespectively. higher temperatures lead to higher values of the jeans mass,which may affect future star formation. the mass of the material in the pdr,collected through the expansion of the hii region, is between ~300 and ~10,000solar masses for the hii regions studied here. these masses are in roughagreement with the expected masses swept up during the expansion of the \hii\regions. approximately 20% of the total fir emission is from the direction ofthe bubble central regions. this suggests that we are detecting emission fromthe "near-side" and "far-side" pdrs along the line of sight and that bubblesare three-dimensional structures. we find only weak support for a relationshipbetween dust temperature and beta, of a form similar to that caused by noiseand calibration uncertainties alone.

1203.6472	cluster-formation in the rosette molecular cloud at the junctions of  filaments	for many years feedback processes generated by ob-stars in molecular clouds,including expanding ionization fronts, stellar winds, or uv-radiation, havebeen proposed to trigger subsequent star formation. however, hydrodynamicmodels including radiation and gravity show that uv-illumination has little orno impact on the global dynamical evolution of the cloud. the rosette molecularcloud, irradiated by the ngc2244 cluster, is a template region for triggeredstar-formation, and we investigated its spatial and density structure byapplying a curvelet analysis, a filament-tracing algorithm (disperse), andprobability density functions (pdfs) on herschel column density maps, obtainedwithin the hobys key program. the analysis reveals not only the filamentarystructure of the cloud but also that all known infrared clusters except one lieat junctions of filaments, as predicted by turbulence simulations. the pdfs ofsub-regions in the cloud show systematic differences. the two uv-exposedregions have a double-peaked pdf we interprete as caused by shock compression.the deviations of the pdf from the log-normal shape typically associated withlow- and high-mass star-forming regions at av~3-4m and 8-10m, respectively, arefound here within the very same cloud. this shows that there is no fundamentaldifference in the density structure of low- and high-mass star-forming regions.we conclude that star-formation in rosette - and probably in high-massstar-forming clouds in general - is not globally triggered by the impact ofuv-radiation. moreover, star formation takes place in filaments that arose fromthe primordial turbulent structure built up during the formation of the cloud.clusters form at filament mergers, but star formation can be locally induced inthe direct interaction zone between an expanding hii--region and the molecularcloud.

1206.1243	the spine of the swan: a herschel study of the dr21 ridge and filaments  in cygnus x	in order to characterise the cloud structures responsible for the formationof high-mass stars, we present herschel observations of the dr21 environment.maps of the column density and dust temperature unveil the structure of thedr21 ridge and several connected filaments. the ridge has column densitieslarger than 1e23/cm^2 over a region of 2.3 pc^2. it shows substructured columndensity profiles and branching into two major filaments in the north. themasses in the studied filaments range between 130 and 1400 msun whereas themass in the ridge is 15000 msun. the accretion of these filaments onto the dr21ridge, suggested by a previous molecular line study, could provide a continuousmass inflow to the ridge. in contrast to the striations seen in e.g., thetaurus region, these filaments are gravitationally unstable and form cores andprotostars. these cores formed in the filaments potentially fall into theridge. both inflow and collisions of cores could be important to drive theobserved high-mass star formation. the evolutionary gradient of star formationrunning from dr21 in the south to the northern branching is traced bydecreasing dust temperature. this evolution and the ridge structure can beexplained by two main filamentary components of the ridge that merged first inthe south.

1211.6360	herschel view of the taurus b211/3 filament and striations: evidence of  filamentary growth?	we present first results from the herschel gould belt survey for theb211/l1495 region in the taurus molecular cloud. thanks to their highsensitivity and dynamic range, the herschel images reveal the structure of thedense, star-forming filament b211 with unprecedented detail, along with thepresence of striations perpendicular to the filament and generally orientedalong the magnetic field direction as traced by optical polarization vectors.based on the column density and dust temperature maps derived from the herscheldata, we find that the radial density profile of the b211 filament approaches apower-law behavior {\rho} {\propto} r^(-2.0{\pm}0.4) at large radii and thatthe temperature profile exhibits a marked drop at small radii. the observeddensity and temperature profiles of the b211 filament are in good agreementwith a theoretical model of a cylindrical filament undergoing gravitationalcontraction with a polytropic equation of state: p {\propto} {\rho}^{\gamma}and t {\propto} {\rho}^({\gamma}-1), with {\gamma}=0.97{\pm}0.01&lt;1 (i.e. notstrictly isothermal). the morphology of the column density map, where some ofthe perpendicular striations are apparently connected to the b211 filament,further suggests that the material may be accreting along the striations ontothe main filament. the typical velocities expected for the infalling materialin this picture are ~0.5-1 km/s, which are consistent with the existingkinematical constraints from previous co observations.

1301.3805	herschel observations of the w3 gmc: clues to the formation of clusters  of high-mass stars	the w3 gmc is a prime target for the study of the early stages of high-massstar formation. we have used herschel data from the hobys key program toproduce and analyze column density and temperature maps. two preliminarycatalogs were produced by extracting sources from the column density map andfrom herschel maps convolved to the 500 micron resolution. herschel revealsthat among the compact sources (fwhm&lt;0.45 pc), w3 east, w3 west, and w3 (oh)are the most massive and luminous and have the highest column density.considering the unique properties of w3 east and w3 west, the only clumps withon-going high-mass star formation, we suggest a 'convergent constructivefeedback' scenario to account for the formation of a cluster with decreasingage and increasing system/source mass toward the innermost regions. thisprocess, which relies on feedback by high-mass stars to ensure the availabilityof material during cluster formation, could also lead to the creation of anenvironment suitable for the formation of trapezium-like systems. in commonwith other scenarios proposed in other hobys studies, our results indicate thatan active/dynamic process aiding in the accumulation, compression, andconfinement of material is a critical feature of the high-mass star/clusterformation, distinguishing it from classical low-mass star formation. theenvironmental conditions and availability of triggers determine the form inwhich this process occurs, implying that high-mass star/cluster formation couldarise from a range of scenarios: from large scale convergence of turbulentflows, to convergent constructive feedback or mergers of filaments.

1304.0327	what determines the density structure of molecular clouds ? a case study  of orion b with herschel	a key parameter to the description of all star formation processes is thedensity structure of the gas. in this letter, we make use of probabilitydistribution functions (pdfs) of herschel column density maps of orion b,aquila, and polaris, obtained with the herschel gould belt survey (hgbs). weaim to understand which physical processes influence the pdf shape, and withwhich signatures. the pdfs of orion b (aquila) show a lognormal distributionfor low column densities until av 3 (6), and a power-law tail for high columndensities, consistent with a rho r^-2 profile for the equivalent sphericaldensity distribution. the pdf of orion b is broadened by external compressiondue to the nearby ob stellar aggregates. the pdf of a quiescent subregion ofthe non-star-forming polaris cloud is nearly lognormal, indicating thatsupersonic turbulence governs the density distribution. but we also observe adeviation from the lognormal shape at av&gt;1 for a subregion in polaris thatincludes a prominent filament. we conclude that (i) the point where the pdfdeviates from the lognormal form does not trace a universal av-threshold forstar formation, (ii) statistical density fluctuations, intermittency andmagnetic fields can cause excess from the lognormal pdf at an early cloudformation stage, (iii) core formation and/or global collapse of filaments and anon-isothermal gas distribution lead to a power-law tail, and (iv) externalcompression broadens the column density pdf, consistent with numericalsimulations.

1304.4098	first results from the herschel gould belt survey in taurus	the whole of the taurus region (a total area of 52 sq. deg.) has beenobserved by the herschel spire and pacs instruments at wavelengths of 70, 160,250, 350 and 500 {\mu}m as part of the herschel gould belt survey. in thispaper we present the first results from the part of the taurus region thatincludes the barnard 18 and l1536 clouds. a new source-finding routine, thecardiff source-finding algorithm (csar), is introduced, which is loosely basedon clumpfind, but that also generates a structure tree, or dendrogram, whichcan be used to interpret hierarchical clump structure in a complex region.sources were extracted from the data using the hierarchical version of csar andplotted on a mass-size diagram. we found a hierarchy of objects with sizes inthe range 0.024-2.7 pc. previous studies showed that gravitationally boundprestellar cores and unbound starless clumps appeared in different places onthe mass-size diagram. however, it was unclear whether this was due to a lackof instrumental dynamic range or whether they were actually two distinctpopulations. the excellent sensitivity of herschel shows that our sources fillthe gap in the mass-size plane between starless and pre-stellar cores, andgives the first clear supporting observational evidence for the theory thatunbound clumps and (gravitationally bound) prestellar cores are all part of thesame population, and hence presumably part of the same evolutionary sequence(c.f. simpson et al. 2011).

1306.0547	low-velocity shocks traced by extended sio emission along the w43  ridges: witnessing the formation of young massive clusters	the formation of high-mass stars is tightly linked to that of their parentalclouds. we here focus on the high-density parts of w43, a molecular cloudundergoing an efficient event of formation. the cloud structure is studied witha column density image derived from herschel continuum maps obtained at 70,160, 250, 350, and 500 micron. we identify two high-column density filamentaryclouds, quoted as the w43-mm1 and w43-mm2 ridges, which both account for1.5x10^4 msun gas mass above 10^23 cm-2 and within areas of 5 and 14pc^2,respectively. we used the n_2h^+ 1--0 line to confirm that the w43-mm1 andw43-mm2 ridges are structures coherent in velocity and gravitationally bound,despite their large velocity dispersion and ~5 kms line widths. the mostintriguing result of the w43 large program is the bright wide-spread sio 2--1emission: 1--11 k kms$ stretching an area of ~28 pc^2. concentrated toward thew43-mm1 and w43-mm2 ridges and their immediate surroundings, it leads to atotal luminosity of l_sio 2-1 ~4 10^4 k kms kpc^2pc^2. we measured a steeprelation between the luminosity and velocity extent of the sio~2--1 lines andpropose to use it to distinguish the low-velocity shocks observed here from themore classical high-velocity ones associated with outflows of high-mass youngstellar objects. we used state-of-the-art shock models to demonstrate thatlow-velocity (&lt;10 kms^-1) shocks with a small amount (10%) of si atomsinitially in gas phase or in grain mantles can explain the observed sio columndensity in w43. the spatial and velocity overlaps between the ridgeshigh-density gas (n_h2&gt;10^4-10^5 cm^-3) and the shocked sio gas suggests thatridges could be forming via colliding flows driven by gravity and accompaniedby low-velocity shocks. this mechanism may be the initial conditions for theformation of young massive clusters in these ridges.

1307.2590	global collapse of molecular clouds as a formation mechanism for the  most massive stars	the relative importance of primordial molecular cloud fragmentation versuslarge-scale accretion still remains to be assessed in the context of massivecore/star formation. studying the kinematics of the dense gas surroundingmassive-star progenitors can tell us the extent to which large-scale flow ofmaterial impacts the growth in mass of star-forming cores. here we present acomprehensive dataset of the 5500(+/-800) msun infrared dark cloudsdc335.579-0.272 (hereafter sdc335) which exhibits a network of cold, dense,parsec-long filaments. atacama large millimeter array (alma) cycle 0observations reveal two massive star-forming cores, mm1 and mm2, sitting at thecentre of sdc335 where the filaments intersect. with a gas mass of545(+770,-385) msun contained within a source diameter of 0.05pc, mm1 is one ofthe most massive, compact protostellar cores ever observed in the galaxy. as awhole, sdc335 could potentially form an ob cluster similar to the trapeziumcluster in orion. alma and mopra single-dish observations of the sdc335 densegas furthermore reveal that the kinematics of this hub-filament system areconsistent with a global collapse of the cloud. these molecular-line data pointtowards an infall velocity v_{inf} =0.7(+/-0.2) km/s, and a total mass infallrate \dot{m}_{inf} = 2.5(+/-1.0) x 10^{-3} msun/yr towards the central pc-sizeregion of sdc335. this infall rate brings 750(+/-300) msun of gas to the centreof the cloud per free-fall time (t_{ff}=3x10^5 yr). this is enough to doublethe mass already present in the central pc-size region in 3.5(+2.2,-1.0) xt_{ff}. these values suggest that the global collapse of sdc335 over the pastmillion year resulted in the formation of an early o-type star progenitor atthe centre of the cloud's gravitational potential well.

1308.3854	probing the turbulent ambipolar diffusion scale in molecular clouds with  spectroscopy	we estimate the turbulent ambipolar diffusion length scale and magnetic fieldstrength in the massive dense cores cygx-n03 and cygx-n53, located in thecygnus-x star-forming region. the method we use requires comparing the velocitydispersions in the spectral line profiles of the coexistent ion and neutralpair h13cn and h13co+ (j=1-0) at different length scales. we fitkolmogorov-type power laws to the lower envelopes of the velocity dispersionspectra of the two species. this allows to calculate the turbulent ambipolardiffusion scale, which in turn determines the plane-of-the-sky magnetic fieldstrength. we find turbulent ambipolar diffusion length scales of 3.8+-0.1 mpcand 21.2+-0.4 mpc, and magnetic field strengths of 0.33 mg and 0.76 mg forcygx-n03 and cygx-n53, respectively. these magnetic field values haveuncertainties of a factor of a few. despite a lower signal-to-noise ratio ofthe data in cygx-n53 than in cygx-n03, and the caveat that its stronger fieldmight stem in part from projection effects, the difference in field strengthssuggests different fragmentation activities of the two cores. even though thequality of our data, obtained with the iram plateau de bure interferometer(pdbi), is somewhat inferior to previous single-dish data, we demonstrate thatthis method is suited also for observations at high spatial resolution.

1308.6112	large scale iram 30m co-observations in the giant molecular cloud  complex w43	we aim to give a full description of the distribution and location of densemolecular clouds in the giant molecular cloud complex w43. it has previouslybeen identified as one of the most massive star-forming regions in our galaxy.to trace the moderately dense molecular clouds in the w43 region, we initiatedan iram 30m large program, named w43-hero, covering a large dynamic range ofscales (from 0.3 to 140 pc). we obtained on-the-fly-maps in 13co (2-1) and c18o(2-1) with a high spectral resolution of 0.1 km/s and a spatial resolution of12". these maps cover an area of ~1.5 square degrees and include the two mainclouds of w43, as well as the lower density gas surrounding them. a comparisonwith galactic models and previous distance calculations confirms the locationof w43 near the tangential point of the scutum arm at a distance from the sunof approximately 6 kpc. the resulting intensity cubes of the observed regionare separated into sub-cubes, centered on single clouds which are then analyzedin detail. the optical depth, excitation temperature, and h2 column densitymaps are derived out of the 13co and c18o data. these results are then comparedwith those derived from herschel dust maps. the mass of a typical cloud isseveral 10^4 solar masses while the total mass in the dense molecular gas (&gt;100cm^-3) in w43 is found to be about 1.9e6 solar masses. probability distributionfunctions obtained from column density maps derived from molecular line dataand herschel imaging show a log-normal distribution for low column densitiesand a power-law tail for high densities. a flatter slope for the molecular linedata pdf may imply that those selectively show the gravitationally collapsinggas.

1308.6490	co outflows from high-mass class 0 protostars in cygnus-x	as natural consequences of the accretion process, outflows are one of the few(indirect) tracers of accretion. we used co(2-1) pdbi observations towards 6mdcs in cygnus-x, containing 9 high-mass cores, to investigate what theaccretion process and origin of the material feeding the precursors ofhigh-mass stars are. we compared our sample to low-mass objects from theliterature and developed simple evolutionary models to reproduce theobservables. we find that 8/9 high-mass cores drive clear individual outflowsas true equivalents of class 0 protostars in the high-mass regime. theremaining core has only a tentative outflow detection. it could be amongst thefirst examples of a true individual high-mass prestellar core. we find that themomentum flux of high-mass objects has a linear relation to the envelope mass,as a scale-up of the relations found for low-mass protostars. this suggests afundamental proportionality between accretion rates and mass reservoir,suggesting identical collapse timescales for all masses. we conclude that ifthe pre-collapse evolution is quasi-static, the fragmentation scale (which issimilar for all masses) would limit the size of the initial mass reservoirs,leading to shorter free-fall times for higher mass stars. however, as we findidentical collapse timescales for all masses, a significant turbulent/magneticsupport is needed to slow down the collapse of the more massive envelopes in aquasi-static view. with this support still to be discovered, and withindications of large dynamics in pre-collapse gas for high-mass star formation,we propose that such an identical collapse timescale implies that the initialdensities, which should set the duration of the collapse, should be similar forall masses. this suggests that the mass that incorporates massive stars has tohave been accreted in a dynamical way from larger scales than those of low-massstars.

1311.3664	pillars and globules at the edges of h ii regions, confronting herschel  observations and numerical simulations	pillars and globules are present in many high-mass star-forming regions, suchas the eagle nebula (m16) and the rosette molecular cloud, and understandingtheir origin will help characterize triggered star formation. the formationmechanisms of these structures are still being debated. recent numericalsimulations have shown how pillars can arise from the collapse of the shell inon itself and how globules can be formed from the interplay of the turbulentmolecular cloud and the ionization from massive stars. the goal here is to testthis scenario through recent observations of two massive star-forming regions,m16 and rosette. the column density structure of the interface betweenmolecular clouds and h ii regions was characterized using column density mapsobtained from far-infrared imaging of the herschel hobys key programme. then,the disperse algorithm was used on these maps to detect the compressed layersaround the ionized gas and pillars in different evolutionary states. finally,their velocity structure was investigated using co data, and all observationalsignatures were tested against some distinct diagnostics established fromsimulations. the column density profiles have revealed the importance ofcompression at the edge of the ionized gas. the velocity properties of thestructures, i.e. pillars and globules, are very close to what we predict fromthe numerical simulations. we have identified a good candidate of a nascentpillar in the rosette molecular cloud that presents the velocity pattern of theshell collapsing on itself, induced by a high local curvature. globules have abulk velocity dispersion that indicates the importance of the initialturbulence in their formation, as proposed from numerical simulations.altogether, this study re-enforces the picture of pillar formation by shellcollapse and globule formation by the ionization of highly turbulent clouds.

1312.0937	the atlasgal survey: a catalog of dust condensations in the galactic  plane	the formation processes and the evolutionary stages of high-mass stars arepoorly understood compared to low-mass stars. large-scale surveys are needed toprovide an unbiased census of high column density sites which can potentiallyhost precursors to high-mass stars. here we use the atlasgal survey covering420 sq. degree of the galactic plane at 870 $\mu$m; and use the mre-glc methodto identify the population of embedded sources throughout the inner galaxy. weidentify in total 10861 compact sub-millimeter sources with fluxes above 5sigma. completeness tests show that our catalogue is 97% complete above 5 sigmaand &gt;99% complete above 7$\sigma$. we correlate this sample with mid-infraredpoint source catalogues (msx at 21.3 $\mu$m and wise at 22 $\mu$m) anddetermine a lower limit of ~33% that are associated with embedded protostellarobjects. we note that the proportion of clumps associated with mid-infraredsources increases with increasing flux density, achieving a rather constantfraction of ~75% of all clumps with fluxes over 5 jy/beam being associated withstar-formation. examining the source counts as a function of galactic longitudewe are able to identify the most prominent star forming regions in the galaxy.from the fraction of the likely massive quiescent clumps (~25%) we estimate aformation time-scale of ~7.5+/-2.5 $\times$ 10$^4$yr for the deeply embeddedphase before the emergence of luminous ysos. such a short duration for theformation of high-mass stars in massive clumps clearly proves that the earliestphases have to be dynamic with supersonic motions.

1401.6998	first results from the calypso iram-pdbi survey. ii. resolving the hot  corino in the class 0 protostar ngc 1333-iras2a	we investigate the origin of complex organic molecules (coms) in the gasphase around the low-mass class~0 protostar ngc1333-iras2a, to determine if thecom emission lines trace an embedded disk, shocks from the protostellar jet, orthe warm inner parts of the protostellar envelope. in the framework of thecalypso (continuum and lines in young protostellar objects) iram plateau debure survey, we obtained large bandwidth spectra at sub-arcsecond resolutiontowards ngc 1333-iras2a. we identify the emission lines towards the centralprotostar and perform gaussian fits to constrain the size of the emittingregion for each of these lines, tracing various physical conditions and scales.the emission of numerous coms such as methanol, ethylene glycol, and methylformate is spatially resolved by our observations. this allows us to measure,for the first time, the size of the com emission inside the protostellarenvelope, finding that it originates from a region of radius 40-100 au,centered on the ngc 1333-iras2a protostellar object. our analysis shows nopreferential elongation of the com emission along the jet axis, and thereforedoes not support the hypothesis that com emission arises from shocked envelopematerial at the base of the jet. down to similar sizes, the dust continuumemission is well reproduced with a single envelope model, and therefore doesnot favor the hypothesis that com emission arises from the thermal sublimationof grains embedded in a circumstellar disk. finally, the typical scale $\sim$60au observed for com emission is consistent with the size of the inner envelopewhere $t_{\rm{dust}} &gt; 100$ k is expected. our data therefore strongly suggestthat the com emission traces the hot corino in iras2a, i.e., the warm innerenvelope material where the icy mantles of dust grains evaporate because theyare passively heated by the central protostellar object.

1401.7333	ionization compression impact on dense gas distribution and star  formation, probability density functions around h ii regions as seen by  herschel	ionization feedback should impact the probability distribution function (pdf)of the column density around the ionized gas. we aim to quantify this effectand discuss its potential link to the core and initial mass function (cmf/imf).we used in a systematic way herschel column density maps of several regionsobserved within the hobys key program: m16, the rosette and vela c molecularcloud, and the rcw 120 h ii region. we fitted the column density pdfs of allclouds with two lognormal distributions, since they present a double-peak orenlarged shape in the pdf. our interpretation is that the lowest part of thecolumn density distribution describes the turbulent molecular gas while thesecond peak corresponds to a compression zone induced by the expansion of theionized gas into the turbulent molecular cloud. the condensations at the edgeof the ionized gas have a steep compressed radial profile, sometimesrecognizable in the flattening of the power-law tail. this could lead to anunambiguous criterion able to disentangle triggered from pre-existing starformation. in the context of the gravo-turbulent scenario for the origin of thecmf/imf, the double peaked/enlarged shape of the pdf may impact the formationof objects at both the low-mass and the high-mass end of the cmf/imf. inparticular a broader pdf is required by the gravo-turbulent scenario to fitproperly the imf with a reasonable initial mach number for the molecular cloud.since other physical processes (e.g. the equation of state and the variationsamong the core properties) have already been suggested to broaden the pdf, therelative importance of the different effects remains an open question.

1401.7871	properties of starless and prestellar cores in taurus revealed by  herschel spire/pacs imaging	the density and temperature structures of dense cores in the l1495 cloud ofthe taurus star-forming region are investigated using herschel spire and pacsimages in the 70 $\mu$m, 160 $\mu$m, 250 $\mu$m, 350 $\mu$m and 500 $\mu$mcontinuum bands. a sample consisting of 20 cores, selected using spectral andspatial criteria, is analysed using a new maximum likelihood technique,corefit, which takes full account of the instrumental point spread functions.we obtain central dust temperatures, $t_0$, in the range 6-12 k and find that,in the majority of cases, the radial density falloff at large radial distancesis consistent with the $r^{-2}$ variation expected for bonnor-ebert spheres.two of our cores exhibit a significantly steeper falloff, however, and sinceboth appear to be gravitationally unstable, such behaviour may haveimplications for collapse models. we find a strong negative correlation between$t_0$ and peak column density, as expected if the dust is heated predominantlyby the interstellar radiation field. at the temperatures we estimate for thecore centres, carbon-bearing molecules freeze out as ice mantles on dustgrains, and this behaviour is supported here by the lack of correspondencebetween our estimated core locations and the previously-published positions ofh$^{13}$co$^+$ peaks. on this basis, our observations suggest asublimation-zone radius typically $\sim 10^4$ au. comparison withpreviously-published n$_2$h$^+$ data at 8400 au resolution, however, shows noevidence for n$_2$h$^+$ depletion at that resolution.

1401.8292	fragmentation of massive dense cores down to ~1000 au: relation between  fragmentation and density structure	in order to shed light on the main physical processes controllingfragmentation of massive dense cores, we present a uniform study of the densitystructure of 19 massive dense cores, selected to be at similar evolutionarystages, for which their relative fragmentation level was assessed in a previouswork. we inferred the density structure of the 19 cores through a simultaneousfit of the radial intensity profiles at 450 and 850 micron (or 1.2 mm in twocases) and the spectral energy distribution, assuming spherical symmetry andthat the density and temperature of the cores decrease with radius followingpower-laws. we find a weak (inverse) trend of fragmentation level and densitypower-law index, with steeper density profiles tending to show lowerfragmentation, and vice versa. in addition, we find a trend of fragmentationincreasing with density within a given radius, which arises from a combinationof flat density profile and high central density and is consistent with jeansfragmentation. we considered the effects of rotational-to-gravitational energyratio, non-thermal velocity dispersion, and turbulence mode on the densitystructure of the cores, and found that compressive turbulence seems to yieldhigher central densities. finally, a possible explanation for the origin ofcores with concentrated density profiles, which are the cores showing nofragmentation, could be related with a strong magnetic field, consistent withthe outcome of radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations.

1403.2996	understanding star formation in molecular clouds i. effects of  line-of-sight contamination on the column density structure	column-density maps of molecular clouds are one of the most importantobservables in the context of molecular cloud- and star-formation (sf) studies.with the herschel satellite it is now possible to determine the column densityfrom dust emission. we use observations and simulations to demonstrate how loscontamination affects the column density probability distribution function(pdf). we apply a first-order approximation (removing a constant level) to themolecular clouds of auriga, maddalena, carina and ngc3603. in perfect agreementwith the simulations, we find that the pdfs become broader, the peak shifts tolower column densities, and the power-law tail of the pdf flattens aftercorrection. all pdfs have a lognormal part for low column densities with a peakat av~2, a deviation point (dp) from the lognormal at av(dp)~4-5, and apower-law tail for higher column densities. assuming a density distributionrho~r^-alpha, the slopes of the power-law tails correspond to alpha(pdf)=1.8,1.75, and 2.5 for auriga, carina, and ngc3603 (alpha~1.5-2 is consistentgravitational collapse). we find that low-mass and high-mass sf clouds displaydifferences in the overall column density structure. massive clouds assemblemore gas in smaller cloud volumes than low-mass sf ones. however, for bothcloud types, the transition of the pdf from lognormal shape into power-law tailis found at the same column density (at av~4-5 mag). low-mass and high-mass sfclouds then have the same low column density distribution, most likelydominated by supersonic turbulence. at higher column densities, collapse andexternal pressure can form the power-law tail. the relative importance of thetwo processes can vary between clouds and thus lead to the observed differencesin pdf and column density structure.

1404.4404	the formation of the w43 complex: constraining its atomic-to-molecular  transition and searching for colliding clouds	numerical simulations have explored the possibility to form molecular cloudsthrough either a quasi-static, self-gravitating mechanism or the collision ofgas streams or lower-density clouds. they also quantitatively predict thedistribution of matter at the transition from atomic to molecular gases. we aimto observationally test these models by studying the environment of w43, amolecular cloud complex near the tip of the galactic long bar. usinggalaxy-wide hi and 12co surveys we searched for gas flowing toward the w43molecular cloud complex. we also estimated the hi and h2 mass surface densitiesto constrain the transition from atomic to molecular gas around and within w43.we found 3 cloud ensembles within the position-velocity diagrams of 12co and higases. they are separated by 20km/s along the line of sight and extend into the13co velocity structure of w43. since their velocity gradients are consistentwith free-fall, they could be nearby clouds attracted by, and streaming toward,the w43 10^7msun potential well. we show that the hi surface density,sigma_hi=45-85msun/pc2, does not reach any threshold level but increases whenentering the 130pc-wide molecular complex previously defined. this suggeststhat an equilibrium between h2 formation and photodissociation has not yet beenreached. the h2-to-hi ratio measured over the w43 region and its surroundings,r_h2~3.5, is high, indicating that most of the gas is already in molecular formin w43 and in structures several hundreds of parsecs downstream along thescutum-centaurus arm. the w43 molecular cloud complex may have formed, and infact may still be accreting mass from the agglomeration of clouds. already inthe molecular-dominated regime, most of these clouds are streaming from thescutum-centaurus arm. this is in clear disagreement with quasi-static andsteady-state models of molecular cloud formation.

1404.6526	herschel's view of the large-scale structure in the chamaeleon dark  clouds	the chamaeleon molecular cloud complex is one of the nearest star-formingsites encompassing three molecular clouds with a different star-formationhistory, from quiescent (cha iii) to actively forming stars (cha ii), andreaching the end of star-formation (cha i). to charactize its large-scalestructure, we derived column density and temperature maps using pacs and spireobservations from the herschel gould belt survey, and applied several tools,such as filament tracing, power-spectra, \delta-variance, and probabilitydistribution functions of column density (pdfs), to derive physical properties.the column density maps reveal a different morphological appearance for thethree clouds, with a ridge-like structure for cha i, a clump-dominated regimefor cha ii, and an intricate filamentary network for cha iii. the filamentwidth is measured to be around 0.12\pm0.04 pc in the three clouds, and thefilaments found to be gravitationally unstable in cha i and ii, but mostlysubcritical in cha iii. faint filaments (striations) are prominent in cha ishowing a preferred alignment with the large-scale magnetic field. the pdfs ofall regions show a lognormal distribution at low column densities. for higherdensities, the pdf of cha i shows a turnover indicative of an extended higherdensity component, culminating with a power-law tail. cha ii shows a power-lawtail with a slope characteristic of gravity. the pdf of cha iii can be best fitby a single lognormal. the turbulence properties of the three regions are foundto be similar, pointing towards a scenario where the clouds are impacted bylarge-scale processes. the magnetic field could possibly play an important rolefor the star-formation efficiency in the chamaeleon clouds if proven that itcan effectively channel material on cha i, and possibly cha ii, but probablyless efficiently on the quiescent cha iii cloud.

1404.7142	class 0 protostars in the perseus molecular cloud: a correlation between  the youngest protostars and the dense gas distribution	we use pacs and spire continuum data at 160 um, 250 um, 350 um, and 500 umfrom the herschel gould belt survey to sample seven clumps in perseus: b1,b1-e, b5, ic348, l1448, l1455, and ngc1333. additionally, we identify andcharacterize the embedded class 0 protostars using detections of compactherschel sources at 70 um as well as archival spitzer catalogues and scuba 850um photometric data. we identify 28 candidate class 0 protostars, four of whichare newly discovered sources not identified with spitzer. we find that the starformation efficiency of clumps, as traced by class 0 protostars, correlatesstrongly with the flatness of their respective column density distributions athigh values. this correlation suggests that the fraction of high column densitymaterial in a clump reflects only its youngest protostellar population ratherthan its entire source population. we propose that feedback from either theformation or evolution of protostars changes the local density structure ofclumps.

1406.3134	understanding star formation in molecular clouds ii. signatures of  gravitational collapse of irdcs	we analyse column density and temperature maps derived from herschel dustcontinuum observations of a sample of massive infrared dark clouds(g11.11-0.12, g18.82-0.28, g28.37+0.07, g28.53-0.25). we disentangle thevelocity structure of the clouds using 13co 1-0 and 12co 3-2 data, showing thatthese irdcs are the densest regions in massive giant molecular clouds and notisolated features. the probability distribution function (pdf) of columndensities for all clouds have a power-law distribution over all (high) columndensities, regardless of the evolutionary stage of the cloud: g11.11-0.12,g18.82-0.28, and g28.37+0.07 contain (proto)-stars, while g28.53-0.25 shows nosigns of star formation. this is in contrast to the purely log-normal pdfsreported for near/mid-ir extinction maps. we only find a log-normaldistribution for lower column densities, if we perform pdfs of the columndensity maps of the whole gmc in which the irdcs are embedded. by comparing thepdf slope and the radial column density profile, we attribute the power law tothe effect of large-scale gravitational collapse and to local free-fallcollapse of pre- and protostellar cores. independent from the pdf analysis, wefind infall signatures in the spectral profiles of 12co for g28.37+0.07 andg11.11-0.12, supporting the scenario of gravitational collapse. irdcs are thedensest regions within gmcs, which may be the progenitors of massive stars orclusters. at least some of the irdcs are probably the same features as ridges(high column density regions with n&gt;1e23 cm-2 over small areas), which weredefined for nearby ir-bright gmcs. because irdcs are only confined to thedensest (gravity dominated) cloud regions, the pdf constructed from this kindof a clipped image does not represent the (turbulence dominated) low columndensity regime of the cloud.

1407.6400	sio emission from low- and high-velocity shocks in cygnus-x massive  dense clumps	we used pdbi observations of sio (2-1) to investigate the morphology andprofile of the sio emission within several massive dense clumps (mdcs) incygnus-x. we find that most molecular outflows are detected in both sio and co,although there are some cases of co outflows with no sio counterpart. we find asignificant amount of narrow line sio emission that appears to be unrelated tooutflows. the fraction of the total sio luminosity that is not associated withoutflows is highly variable in the different mdcs (from 10% to 90%); this mightbe a problem when extrapolating outflow properties from sio luminositieswithout resolving individual outflows. the extent of the narrow sio emissionvaries from rather compact (~ 0.03 pc) to widespread (~0.2 pc), and itskinematics often differs from those found by other high-density tracers such ash13co+. we find that the least centrally concentrated clumps with the leastmassive protostellar cores have the most widespread narrow sio emission. inline with previous evidence of sio emission associated with low-velocityshocks, we propose an evolutionary picture to explain the existence anddistribution of narrow sio line profiles. in this scenario, the least centrallycondensed mdcs are at an early stage where the sio emission traces shocks fromthe large-scale collapse of material onto the mdc (e.g. cygx-n40). as the mdccollapses, the sio emission becomes more confined to the close surroundings ofcores, tracing the post-shock material from the infalling mdc against the densecores (e.g. cygx-n3, n12, and n48). at later stages, when single massiveprotostars are formed, the sio luminosity is largely dominated by powerfuloutflows, and the weaker narrow component shows perhaps the last remnants ofthe initial collapse (e.g. cygx-n53 and n63).

1501.05439	first detection of cf+ towards a high-mass protostar	we report the first detection of the j = 1 - 0 (102.6 ghz) rotational linesof cf+ (fluoromethylidynium ion) towards cygx-n63, a young and massiveprotostar of the cygnus x region. this detection occurred as part of anunbiased spectral survey of this object in the 0.8-3 mm range, performed withthe iram 30m telescope. the data were analyzed using a local thermodynamicalequilibrium model (lte model) and a population diagram in order to derive thecolumn density. the line velocity (-4 km s-1) and line width (1.6 km s-1)indicate an origin from the collapsing envelope of the protostar.  we obtain a cf+ column density of 4.10e11 cm-2. the cf+ ion is thought to bea good tracer for c+ and assuming a ratio of 10e-6 for cf+/c+, we derive atotal number of c+ of 1.2x10e53 within the beam. there is no evidence of carbonionization caused by an exterior source of uv photons suggesting that theprotostar itself is the source of ionization. ionization from the protostellarphotosphere is not efficient enough. in contrast, x-ray ionization from theaccretion shock(s) and uv ionization from outflow shocks could provide a largeenough ionizing power to explain our cf+ detection.  surprisingly, cf+ has been detected towards a cold, massive protostar with nosign of an external photon dissociation region (pdr), which means that the onlypossibility is the existence of a significant inner source of c+. this is animportant result that opens interesting perspectives to study the earlydevelopment of ionized regions and to approach the issue of the evolution ofthe inner regions of collapsing envelopes of massive protostars. the existenceof high energy radiations early in the evolution of massive protostars also hasimportant implications for chemical evolution of dense collapsing gas and couldtrigger peculiar chemistry and early formation of a hot core.

1507.02055	herschel observations of the w3 gmc (ii): clues to the formation of  clusters of high-mass stars	the w3 gmc is a prime target for investigating the formation of high-massstars and clusters. this second study of w3 within the hobys key programprovides a comparative analysis of subfields within w3 to further constrain theprocesses leading to the observed structures and stellar population.probability density functions (pdfs) and cumulative mass distributions (cmds)were created from dust column density maps, quantified as extinction av. theshape of the pdf, typically represented with a lognormal function at low av"breaking" to a power-law tail at high av, is influenced by various processesincluding turbulence and self-gravity. the breaks can also be identified, oftenmore readily, in the cmds. the pdf break from lognormal (av(sf)= 6-10 mag)appears to shift to higher av by stellar feedback, so that high-massstar-forming regions tend to have higher pdf breaks. a second break at av &gt; 50mag traces structures formed or influenced by a dynamic process. because such aprocess has been suggested to drive high-mass star formation in w3, this secondbreak might then identify regions with potential for hosting high-massstars/clusters. stellar feedback appears to be a major mechanism driving thelocal evolution and state of regions within w3. a high initial star formationefficiency in a dense medium could result in a self-enhancing process, leadingto more compression and favourable star-formation conditions (e.g., collidingflows), a richer stellar content, and massive stars. this scenario would becompatible with the "convergent constructive feedback" model introduced in ourprevious herschel study.

1507.08869	detection of two power-law tails in the probability distribution  functions of massive gmcs	we report the novel detection of complex high-column density tails in theprobability distribution functions (pdfs) for three high-mass star-formingregions (cepob3, monr2, ngc6334), obtained from dust emission observed withherschel. the low column density range can be fit with a lognormaldistribution. a first power-law tail starts above an extinction (av) of ~6-14.it has a slope of alpha=1.3-2 for the rho~r^-alpha profile for an equivalentdensity distribution (spherical or cylindrical geometry), and is thusconsistent with free-fall gravitational collapse. above av~40, 60, and 140, wedetect an excess that can be fitted by a flatter power law tail with alpha&gt;2.it correlates with the central regions of the cloud (ridges/hubs) of size ~1 pcand densities above 10^4 cm^-3. this excess may be caused by physical processesthat slow down collapse and reduce the flow of mass towards higher densities.possible are: 1. rotation, which introduces an angular momentum barrier, 2.increasing optical depth and weaker cooling, 3. magnetic fields, 4. geometricaleffects, and 5. protostellar feedback. the excess/second power-law tail isclosely linked to high-mass star-formation though it does not imply a universalcolumn density threshold for the formation of (high-mass) stars.

1510.09175	from forced collapse to h ii region expansion in mon r2: envelope  density structure and age determination with herschel	the surroundings of hii regions can have a profound influence on theirdevelopment, morphology, and evolution. this paper explores the effect of theenvironment on h ii regions in the monr2 molecular cloud. we aim to investigatethe density structure of envelopes surrounding hii regions and to determinetheir collapse and ionisation expansion ages. the mon r2 molecular cloud is anideal target since it hosts an h ii region association. column density andtemperature images derived from herschel data were used together to model thestructure of hii bubbles and their surrounding envelopes. the resultingobservational constraints were used to follow the development of the mon r2ionised regions with analytical calculations and numerical simulations. thefour hot bubbles associated with h ii regions are surrounded by dense, cold,and neutral gas envelopes. the radial density profiles are reminiscent of thoseof low-mass protostellar envelopes. the inner parts of envelopes of all fourhii regions could be free-falling because they display shallow densityprofiles. as for their outer parts, the two compact hii regions show a densityprofile, which is typical of the equilibrium structure of an isothermal sphere.in contrast, the central uchii region shows a steeper outer profile, that couldbe interpreted as material being forced to collapse. the size of the heatedbubbles, the spectral type of the irradiating stars, and the mean initialneutral gas density are used to estimate the ionisation expansion time, texp,0.1myr,for the dense uchii and compact hii regions and 0.35 myr for theextended hii region. the envelope transition radii between the shallow andsteeper density profiles are used to estimate the time elapsed since theformation of the first proto stellar embryo, tinf : 1myr, for theultra-compact, 1.5 / 3myr for the compact, and greater than 6myr for theextended hii regions.

1511.05138	atlasgal-selected massive clumps in the inner galaxy, ii:  characterisation of different evolutionary stages and their sio emission	the processes leading to the birth of high-mass stars are poorly understood.we characterise here a sample of 430 massive clumps from the atlasgal survey,which are representative of different evolutionary stages. to establish acensus of molecular tracers of their evolution we performed an unbiasedspectral line survey covering the 3-mm atmospheric window between 84-117 ghzwith the iram 30m. a smaller sample of 128 clumps has been observed in the sio(5-4) transition with the apex telescope to complement the sio (2-1) line andprobe the excitation conditions of the emitting gas, which is the main focus ofthe current study. we report a high detection rate of &gt;75% of the sio (2-1)line and a &gt;90% detection rate from the dedicated follow-ups in the (5-4)transition. the sio (2-1) line with broad line profiles and high detectionrates, is a powerful probe of star formation activity, while the ubiquitousdetection of sio in all evolutionary stages suggests a continuous starformation process in massive clumps. we find a large fraction of infrared-quietclumps to exhibit sio emission, the majority of them only showing alow-velocity component (fwhm~5-6 km/s) centred at the rest velocity of theclump. in the current picture, where this is attributed to low-velocity shocksfrom cloud-cloud collisions, this can be used to pinpoint the youngest, thus,likely prestellar massive structures. based on the line ratio of the (5-4) tothe (2-1) line, our study reveals a trend of changing excitation conditionsthat lead to brighter emission in the (5-4) line towards more evolved sources.our analysis delivers a more robust estimate of sio column density andabundance than previous studies and questions the decrease of jet activity inmassive clumps as a function of age.

1511.07145	the atlasgal survey: distribution of cold dust in the galactic plane.  combination with planck data	sensitive ground-based submillimeter surveys, such as atlasgal, provide aglobal view on the distribution of cold dense gas in the galactic plane. herewe use the 353 ghz maps from the planck/hfi instrument to complement theground-based apex/laboca observations with information on larger angularscales. the resulting maps reveal the distribution of cold dust in the innergalaxy with a larger spatial dynamic range. we find examples of elongatedstructures extending over angular scales of 0.5 degree. corresponding to &gt;30 pcstructures in projection at a distance of 3 kpc, these dust lanes are veryextended and show large aspect ratios. furthermore, we assess the fraction ofdense gas ($f_{\rm dg}$), and estimate 2-5% (above a$_{\rm{v}}&gt;$7 mag) onaverage in the galactic plane. pdfs of the column density reveal the typicallyobserved log-normal distribution for low- and exhibit an excess at high columndensities. as a reference for extragalactic studies, we show the line-of-sightintegrated n-pdf of the inner galaxy, and derive a contribution of this excessto the total column density of $\sim2.2$%, above $n_{\rm h_2} =2.92\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. taking the total flux density, we provide anindependent estimate of the mass of molecular gas in the inner galaxy of$\sim1\times10^9\,m_{\odot}$, which is consistent with previous estimates usingco emission. from the mass and $f_{\rm dg}$ we estimate a galactic sfr of $\dotm = 1.3\,m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. while the distribution of diffuse gas ishomogenous in the inner galaxy, the cmz stands out with a higher dense gasfraction. the low star formation efficiency of the milky way is well explainedby the low $f_{\rm dg}$ in the galactic ism, while the high $f_{\rm dg}$towards the cmz, despite its low star formation activity, suggests that, inthat particular region of our galaxy, high-density gas is not the bottleneckfor star formation.

astro-ph;0103373	isocam observations of the rho ophiuchi cloud: luminosity and mass  functions of the pre-main sequence embedded cluster	we present the results of the first extensive mid-infrared (ir) imagingsurvey of the rho ophiuchi embedded cluster, performed with the isocam cameraon board the iso satellite. the main molecular cloud l1688, as well as l1689nand l1689s, have been completely surveyed for point sources at 6.7 and 14.3micron. a total of 425 sources are detected including 16 class i, 123 class ii,and 77 class iii young stellar objects (ysos). essentially all of the mid-irsources coincide with near-ir sources, but a large proportion of them arerecognized for the first time as ysos. our dual-wavelength survey allows us toidentify essentially all the ysos with ir excess in the embedded cluster downto fnu ~ 10 - 15 mjy. it more than doubles the known population of class iiysos and represents the most complete census to date of newly formed stars inthe rho ophiuchi central region. the stellar luminosity function of thecomplete sample of class ii ysos is derived with a good accuracy down to l=0.03 lsun. a modeling of this lumino- sity function, using available pre-mainsequence tracks and plausible star for- mation histories, allows us to derivethe mass distribution of the class ii ysos which arguably reflects the imf ofthe embedded cluster. we estimate that the imf in rho ophiuchi is welldescribed by a two-component power law with a low- mass index of -0.35+/-0.25,a high-mass index of -1.7 (to be compared with the salpeter value of -1.35),and a break occurring at m = 0.55+/-0.25 msun. this imf is flat with noevidence for a low-mass cutoff down to at least 0.06 msun.

astro-ph;0310605	the giant pillars of the carina nebula	results are presented from a multi-wavelength study of the giant pillarswithin the carina nebula. using near-ir data from 2mass, mid-ir data from msx,843mhz radio continuum maps from the most, and molecular line and continuumobservations from the sest, we investigate the nature of the pillars and searchfor evidence of ongoing star formation within them. photodissociation regions(pdrs) exist across the whole nebula and trace the giant pillars, as well asmany ridges, filaments, and condensations (av &gt; 7 mag). morphologicalsimilarities between emission features at 21um and 843mhz adjacent to the pdrs,suggests that the molecular material has been carved by the intense stellarwinds and uv radiation from the nearby massive stars. in addition, star formingcores are found at the tips of several of the pillars. using a stellar densitydistribution, several candidate embedded clusters are also found. one isclearly seen in the 2mass images and is located within a dense core(g287.84-0.82). a search for massive young stellar objects and compact hiiregions using mid-ir colour criteria, reveal twelve candidates across thecomplex. grey-body fits to seds for four of these objects are suggestive ofob-stars. we find that massive star formation in the carina nebula is occurringacross the whole complex and confirm it has been continuous over the past 3myrs.

astro-ph;0312146	the carbon content in the galactic cygnusx/dr21 star forming region	observations of carbon bearing species are among the most importantdiagnostic probes of ongoing star formation. co is a surrogate for h$_2$ and isfound in the vicinity of star formation sites. there, [ci] emission is thoughtto outline the dense molecular cores and extend into the lower density regions,where the impinging interstellar uv radiation field plays a critical role forthe dissociation and ionization processes. emission of ionized carbon ([cii])is found to be even more extended than [ci] and is linking up with the ionizedmedium. these different tracers emphasize the importance of multi-wavelengthstudies to draw a coherent picture of the processes driving and driven by highmass star formation. until now, large scale surveys were only done with lowresolution, such as the cobe full sky survey, or were biased to a few selectedbright sources (e.g. yamamoto et al. 2001, schneider et al. 2003). a broaderbasis of unbiased, high-resolution observations of [ci], co, and [cii] may playa key role to probe the material processed by uv radiation.

astro-ph;0404439	the young stellar population in the serpens cloud core: an isocam survey	we present results from an isocam survey in the two broad band filters lw2(5-8.5 mu) and lw3 (12-18 mu) of a 0.13 square degree coverage of the serpensmain cloud core. a total of 392 sources were detected in the 6.7 mu band and139 in the 14.3 mu band to a limiting sensitivity of ~ 2 mjy. only about 50% ofthe mid-ir excess sources show excesses in the near-ir j-h/h-k diagram. in thecentral cloud core the class i/class ii number ratio is 19/18, i.e. about 10times larger than in other young embedded clusters such as rho ophiuchi orchamaeleon. the mid-ir fluxes of the class i and flat-spectrum sources arefound to be on the average larger than those of class ii sources. stellarluminosities are estimated for the class ii sample, and its luminosity functionis compatible with a coeval population of about 2 myr which follows a threesegment power-law imf. for this age about 20% of the class iis are found to beyoung brown dwarf candidates. the ysos are in general strongly clustered, theclass i sources more than the class ii sources, and there is an indication ofsub-clustering. the sub-clustering of the protostar candidates has a spatialscale of 0.12 pc. these sub-clusters are found along the nw-se oriented ridgeand in very good agreement with the location of dense cores traced bymillimeter data. the smallest clustering scale for the class ii sources isabout 0.25 pc, similar to what was found for rho ophiuchi. our data showevidence that star formation in serpens has proceeded in several phases, andthat a ``microburst'' of star formation has taken place very recently, probablywithin the last 10^5 yrs.

astro-ph;0405075	isocam observations of the l1551 star formation region	the results of a deep mid-ir isocam survey of the l1551 dark molecular cloudare presented. the aim of this survey is a search for new yso (young stellarobject) candidates, using two broad-band filters centred at 6.7 and 14.3micron. although two regions close to the centre of l1551 had to be avoided dueto saturation problems, 96 sources were detected in total (76 sources at 6.7micron and 44 sources at 14.3 micron). using the 24 sources detected in bothfilters, 14 were found to have intrinsic mid-ir excess at 14.3 micron and weretherefore classified as yso candidates. using additional observations in b, v,i, j, h and k obtained from the ground, most candidates detected at thesewavelengths were confirmed to have mid-ir excess at 6.7 micron as well, andthree additional yso candidates were found. prior to this survey only threeysos were known in the observed region (avoiding l1551 irs5/ne and hl/xz tau).this survey reveals 15 new yso candidates, although several of these areuncertain due to their extended nature either in the mid-ir or in theoptical/near-ir observations. two of the sources with mid-ir excess arepreviously known ysos, one is a brown dwarf mho 5 and the other is the wellknown t tauri star hh30, consisting of an outflow and an optically thick diskseen edge on.

astro-ph;0407482	multiple protostellar systems. i. a deep near infrared survey of taurus  and ophiuchus protostellar objects	(abridged) we performed a deep infrared imaging survey of 63 embedded youngstellar objects (ysos) located in the taurus and ophiuchus clouds to search forcompanions. the sample includes class i and flat infrared spectrum protostellarobjects. we find 17 companions physically bound to 15 ysos with angularseparations in the range 0.8-10" (110-1400 au) and derive a companion starfraction of 23+/-9 % and 29+/-7 % for embedded ysos in taurus and ophiuchus,respectively. in spite of different properties of the clouds and especially ofthe prestellar cores, the fraction of wide companions, 27+/-6 % for thecombined sample, is identical in the two star-forming regions. this suggeststhat the frequency and properties of wide multiple protostellar systems are notvery sensitive to specific initial conditions. comparing the companion starfraction of the youngest ysos still surrounded by extended envelopes to that ofmore evolved ysos, we find evidence for a possible evolution of the fraction ofwide multiple systems, which seems to decrease by a factor of about 2 on atimescale of about 10^5 yr. somewhat contrary to model predictions, we do notfind evidence for a sub-clustering of embedded sources at this stage on a scaleof a few 100 au that could be related to the formation of small-n protostellarclusters. possible interpretations for this discrepancy are discussed.

astro-ph;0603604	scuba observations of the horsehead nebula - what did the horse swallow?	we present observations taken with scuba on the jcmt of the horsehead nebulain orion (b33), at wavelengths of 450 and 850 \mum. we see bright emission fromthat part of the cloud associated with the photon-dominated region (pdr) at the`top' of the horse's head, which we label b33-smm1. we characterise thephysical parameters of the extended dust responsible for this emission, andfind that b33-smm1 contains a more dense core than was previously suspected. wecompare the scuba data with data from the infrared space observatory (iso) andfind that the emission at 6.75-\mum is offset towards the west, indicating thatthe mid-infrared emission is tracing the pdr while the submillimetre emissioncomes from the molecular cloud core behind the pdr. we calculate the virialbalance of this core and find that it is not gravitationally bound but is beingconfined by the external pressure from the hii region ic434, and that it willeither be destroyed by the ionising radiation, or else may undergo triggeredstar formation. furthermore we find evidence for a lozenge-shaped clump in the`throat' of the horse, which is not seen in emission at shorter wavelengths. welabel this source b33-smm2 and find that it is brighter at submillimetrewavelengths than b33-smm1. smm2 is seen in absorption in the 6.75-\mum isodata, from which we obtain an independent estimate of the column density inexcellent agreement with that calculated from the submillimetre emission. wecalculate the stability of this core against collapse and find that it is inapproximate gravitational virial equilibrium. this is consistent with it beinga pre-existing core in b33, possibly pre-stellar in nature, but that it mayalso eventually undergo collapse under the effects of the hii region.

astro-ph;0608709	a multi-wavelength census of star formation activity in the young  embedded cluster around serpens/g3-g6	aims. the aim of this paper is to characterise the star formation activity inthe poorly studied embedded cluster serpens/g3-g6, located ~ 45' (3 pc) to thesouth of the serpens cloud core, and to determine the luminosity and massfunctions of its population of young stellar objects (ysos).  methods. multi-wavelength broadband photometry was obtained to sample thenear and mid-ir spectral energy distributions to separate ysos from field starsand classify the yso evolutionary stage. isocam mapping in the two filters lw2(5-8.5 um) and lw3 (12-18 um) of a 19' x 16' field was combined with jhks datafrom 2mass, ks data from arnica/not, and l' data from sirca/not. continuumemission at 1.3 mm (iram) and 3.6 cm (vla) was mapped to study the cloudstructure and the coldest/youngest sources. deep narrow band imaging at the2.12 um s(1) line of h2 from notcam/not was obtained to search for signs ofbipolar outflows.  results. we have strong evidence for a stellar population of 31 class iisources, 5 flat-spectrum sources, 5 class i sources, and two class 0 sources.our method does not sample the class iii sources. the cloud is composed of twomain dense clumps aligned along a ridge over ~ 0.5 pc plus a starless corecoinciding with absorption features seen in the isocam maps. we find twos-shaped bipolar collimated flows embedded in the ne clump, and propose the twodriving sources to be a class 0 candidate (mms3) and a double class i (mms2).for the class ii population we find a best age of ~ 2 myr and compatibilitywith recent initial mass functions (imfs) by comparing the observed class iiluminosity function (lf), which is complete to 0.08 l_sun, to various model lfswith different star formation scenarios and input imfs.

astro-ph;0609559	the cooling of atomic and molecular gas in dr21	we present an overview of a high-mass star formation region through the major(sub-)mm, and far-infrared cooling lines to gain insight into the physicalconditions and the energy budget of the molecular cloud. we used the kosma 3mtelescope to map the core ($10'\times 14'$) of the galactic star forming regiondr 21/dr 21 (oh) in the cygnus x region in the two fine structure lines ofatomic carbon ci and four mid-$j$ transitions of co and $^{13}$co, and cs$j=7\to6$. these observations have been combined with fcrao $j=1\to0$observations of $^{13}$co and c$^{18}$o. five positions, including dr21, dr21(oh), and dr21 fir1, were observed with the iso/lws grating spectrometer in the\oi 63 and 145 $\mu$m lines, the \cii 158 $\mu$m line, and four high-$j$ colines. we discuss the intensities and line ratios at these positions and applylocal thermal equilibrium (lte) and non-lte analysis methods in order to derivephysical parameters such as masses, densities and temperatures. the co lineemission has been modeled up to j=20. from non-lte modeling of the low- tohigh-$j$ co lines we identify two gas components, a cold one at temperatures oft$_\rm{kin}\sim 30-40$ k, and one with t$_\rm{kin}\sim 80-150$ k at a localclump density of about n(h$_2$)$\sim 10^4-10^6$ cm$^{-3}$. while the coldquiescent component is massive containing typically more than 94 % of the mass,the warm, dense, and turbulent gas is dominated by mid- and high-$j$ co lineemission and its large line widths. the medium must be clumpy with avolume-filling of a few percent. the co lines are found to be important for thecooling of the cold molecular gas, e.g. at dr21 (oh). near the outflow of theuv-heated source dr21, the gas cooling is dominated by line emission of atomicoxygen and of co.

astro-ph;0611290	a vla search for young protostars embedded in dense cores	four dense cores, l1582a, l1689a, b133 and b68, classified as prestellar interms of the absence of detectable nir emission, are observed at radiowavelengths to investigate whether they nurture very young protostars. nodefinite young protostars were discovered in any of the four cores observed. afew radio sources were discovered close to the observed cores, but these aremost likely extragalactic sources or ysos unrelated to the cores observed. inl1582a we discovered a weak radio source near the centre of the core with radiocharacteristics and offset from the peak of the submillimeter emission similarto that of the newly discovered protostar in the core l1014, indicating apossible protostellar nature for this source. this needs to be confirmed withnear- and/or mid-infrared observations (e.g. with spitzer). hence based on thecurrent observations we are unable to confirm unequivocally that l1582a isstarless. in l1689a a possible 4.5-sigma radio source was discovered at thecentre of the core, but needs to be confirmed with future observations. in b133a weak radio source, possibly a protostar, was discovered at the edge of thecore on a local peak of the core submm emission, but no source was detected atthe centre of the core. thus, b133 is probably starless, but may have aprotostar at its edge. in b68 no radio sources were discovered inside or at theedge of the core, and thus b68 is indeed starless. four more radio sources withspectral indices characteristic of young protostars were discovered outside thecores but within the extended clouds in which these cores reside. conclusions:we conclude that the number of cores misclassified as prestellar is probablyvery small and does not significantly alter the estimated lifetime of theprestellar phase.

astro-ph;9701097	time-dependent accretion and ejection implied by pre-stellar density  profiles	recent observations suggest that mass ejection and mass accretion bothdecline significantly with time during early protostellar evolution (bontempset al. 1996). in the present paper, we propose that this rapid decay ofaccretion/ejection activity is a direct result of the non-singular densityprofiles characterizing pre-collapse clouds. the radial density profiles ofpre-stellar cores are indeed found to be much flatter than rho(r) ~ r(-2) atradii less than a few thousand au (ward-thompson et al. 1994). here we show,through lagrangian analytical calculations, that the supersonic gravitationalcollapse of pre-stellar cloud cores with centrally peaked, but flatteneddensity profiles leads to a transitory phase of energetic accretion immediatelyfollowing the formation of the central hydrostatic protostar. physically, theflat inner region collapses first nearly homologously to form a finite massstellar nucleus, and the remaining cloud core material then accretessupersonically onto a non-zero point mass. enhanced accretion persists as longas the gravitational pull of this initial point mass, which does not exist inthe shu singular solution, remains significant. we suggest that this epoch ofvigorous accretion coincides with class 0 protostars, which would explain theirunusually powerful jets compared to the more evolved class i objects. we alsouse a simple two-component power-law model to fit the diagrams of outflow powerversus envelope mass observed by bontemps et al. (1996), and suggest that rhoophiuchi and taurus young stellar objects follow different accretion historiesbecause of differing initial conditions.
