0704.1228	near- and far-infrared counterparts of millimeter dust cores in the vela  molecular ridge cloud d	the aim of this paper is to identify the young protostellar counterpartsassociated to dust millimeter cores of the vela molecular ridge cloud d throughnew ir observations (h_2 narrow-band at 2.12 micron and n broad band at 10.4micron) along with an investigation performed on the existing ir catalogues.the association of mm continuum emission with infrared sources from catalogues(iras, msx, 2mass), jhk data from the literature and new observations, has beenestablished according to spatial coincidence, infrared colours and spectralenergy distributions. only 7 out of 29 resolved mm cores (and 16 out of the 26unresolved ones) do not exhibit signposts of star formation activity. the otherones are clearly associated with: far-ir sources, h_2 jets or near-ir objectsshowing a high intrinsic colour excess. the distribution of the spectralindices pertaining to the associated sources is peaked at values typical ofclass i objects, while three objects are signalled as candidates class 0sources. we remark the high detection rate (30%) of h_2 jets driven by sourceslocated inside the mm-cores. they appear not driven by the most luminousobjects in the field, but rather by less luminous objects in young clusters,testifying the co-existence of both low- and intermediate-mass star formation.the presented results reliably describe the young population of vmr-d. however,the statistical evaluation of activity vs inactivity of the investigated cores,even in good agreement with results found for other star forming regions, seemsto reflect the limiting sensitivity of the available facilities rather than anyproperty intrinsic to the mm-condensations.

0906.0561	first detection of acceleration and deceleration in protostellar jets?  time variability in the cha ii outflows	we present a multi-epoch (20 years baseline) kinematical investigation ofhh52, 53, and 54 at optical and near-ir wavelengths, along with medium andhigh- resolution spectroscopic analyses, probing the kinematical and physicaltime variability conditions of the gas along the flows. by means of multi-epochand multi-wavelength narrow-band images, we derived proper motions, tangentialvelocities, velocity and flux variability of the knots. radial velocities andphysical parameters of the gas were derived from spectroscopy. finally, spatialvelocities and inclination of the flows were obtained by combining both imagingand spectroscopy. the p.m. analysis reveals three distinct, partiallyoverlapping outflows. in 20 years, about 60% of the knots show some degree offlux variability. our set of observations apparently indicates acceleration anddeceleration in a variety of knots along the jets. for about 20% of the knots,mostly coincident with working surfaces or interacting knots along the flows, arelevant variability in both flux and velocity is observed. we argue that bothvariabilities are related and that all or part of the kinetic energy lost bythe interacting knots is successively radiated. the analysis indicates thepresence of very light, ionised, and hot flows, impacting a denser medium.several knots are deflected. at least for a couple of them (hh54 g and g0), thedeflection originates from the collision of the two. for the more massive partsof the flow, the deflection is likely the result of the flow collision with adense cloud or with clumps.

0906.4060	pre-main sequence variables in the vmr-d : identification of t  tauri-like accreting protostars through spitzer-irac variability	we present a study of the infrared variability of young stellar objects bymeans of two spitzer-irac images of the vela molecular cloud d (vmr-d) obtainedin observations separated in time by about six months. by using the samespace-born ir instrumentation, this study eliminates all the unwanted effectsusually unavoidable when comparing catalogs obtained from differentinstruments. the vmr-d map covers about 1.5 square deg. of a site where starformation is actively ongoing. we are interested in accreting pre-main sequencevariables whose luminosity variations are due to intermittent events of diskaccretion (i.e. active t tauri stars and exor type objects). the variableobjects have been selected from a catalog of more than 170,000 sources detectedat a s/n ratio &gt; 5. we searched the sample of variables for ones whosephotometric properties are close to those of known exor's. these latter aremonitored in a more systematic way than t tauri stars and the mechanisms thatregulate the observed phenomenology are exactly the same. hence the modalitiesof the exor behavior is adopted as driving criterium for selecting variables ingeneral. we selected 19 bona fide candidates that constitute a well-definedsample of new variable targets for further investigation. out of these, 10sources present a spitzer mips 24 micron counterpart, and have been classifiedas 3 class i, 5 flat spectrum and 2 class ii objects, while the other 9 sourceshave spectral energy distribution compatible with phases older than class i.this is consistent with what is known about the small sample of known exor's,and suggests that the accretion flaring or exor stage might come as a classi/ii transition. we present also new prescriptions that can be useful in futuresearches for accretion variables in large ir databases.

1005.2031	origin of the hot gas in low-mass protostars: herschel-pacs spectroscopy  of hh 46	'water in star-forming regions with herschel' (wish) is a herschel keyprogramme aimed at understanding the physical and chemical structure of youngstellar objects (ysos) with a focus on water and related species. the low-massprotostar hh 46 was observed with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs) on the herschel space observatory to measure emission inh2o, co, oh, [oi], and [cii] lines located between 63 and 186 um. theexcitation and spatial distribution of emission can disentangle the differentheating mechanisms of ysos, with better spatial resolution and sensitivity thanpreviously possible. far-ir line emission is detected at the position of theprotostar and along the outflow axis. the oh emission is concentrated at thecentral position, co emission is bright at the central position and along theoutflow, and h2o emission is concentrated in the outflow. in addition, [oi]emission is seen in low-velocity gas, assumed to be related to the envelope,and is also seen shifted up to 170 km/s in both the red- and blue-shifted jets.envelope models are constructed based on previous observational constraints.they indicate that passive heating of a spherical envelope by the protostellarluminosity cannot explain the high-excitation molecular gas detected with pacs,including co lines with upper levels at &gt;2500 k above the ground state.instead, warm co and h2o emission is probably produced in the walls of anoutflow-carved cavity in the envelope, which are heated by uv photons andnon-dissociative c-type shocks. the bright oh and [oi] emission is attributedto j-type shocks in dense gas close to the protostar. in the scenario describedhere, the combined cooling by far-ir lines within the central spatial pixel isestimated to be 2 \times 10-2 l_sun, with 60-80% attributed to j- and c-typeshocks produced by interactions between the jet and the envelope.

1005.2521	detection of interstellar oxidaniumyl: abundant h2o+ towards the  star-forming regions dr21, sgr b2, and ngc6334	we identify a prominent absorption feature at 1115 ghz, detected in firsthifi spectra towards high-mass star-forming regions, and interpret itsastrophysical origin. the characteristic hyperfine pattern of the h2o+ground-state rotational transition, and the lack of other known low-energytransitions in this frequency range, identifies the feature as h2o+ absorptionagainst the dust continuum background and allows us to derive the velocityprofile of the absorbing gas. by comparing this velocity profile with velocityprofiles of other tracers in the dr21 star-forming region, we constrain thefrequency of the transition and the conditions for its formation. in dr21, thevelocity distribution of h2o+ matches that of the [cii] line at 158\mu\m and ofoh cm-wave absorption, both stemming from the hot and dense clump surfacesfacing the hii-region and dynamically affected by the blister outflow. diffuseforeground gas dominates the absorption towards sgr b2. the integratedintensity of the absorption line allows us to derive lower limits to the h2o+column density of 7.2e12 cm^-2 in ngc 6334, 2.3e13 cm^-2 in dr21, and 1.1e15cm^-2 in sgr b2.

1005.4517	water cooling of shocks in protostellar outflows: herschel-pacs map of  l1157	in the framework of the water in star-forming regions with herschel (wish)key program, maps in water lines of several outflows from young stars are beingobtained, to study the water production in shocks and its role in the outflowcooling. this paper reports the first results of this program, presenting apacs map of the o-h2o 179 um transition obtained toward the young outflowl1157. the 179 um map is compared with those of other important shock tracers,and with previous single-pointing iso, swas, and odin water observations of thesame source that allow us to constrain the water abundance and total cooling.strong h2o peaks are localized on both shocked emission knots and the centralsource position. the h2o 179 um emission is spatially correlated with emissionfrom h2 rotational lines, excited in shocks leading to a significantenhancement of the water abundance. water emission peaks along the outflow alsocorrelate with peaks of other shock-produced molecular species, such as sio andnh3. a strong h2o peak is also observed at the location of the proto-star,where none of the other molecules have significant emission. the absolute 179um intensity and its intensity ratio to the h2o 557 ghz line previouslyobserved with odin/swas indicate that the water emission originates in warmcompact clumps, spatially unresolved by pacs, having a h2o abundance of theorder of 10^-4. this testifies that the clumps have been heated for a time longenough to allow the conversion of almost all the available gas-phase oxygeninto water. the total water cooling is ~10^-1 lo, about 40% of the cooling dueto h2 and 23% of the total energy released in shocks along the l1157 outflow.

1007.1248	water vapor toward starless cores: the herschel view	swas and odin provided stringent upper limits on the gas phase waterabundance of dark clouds (x(h2o) &lt; 7x10^-9). we investigate the chemistry ofwater vapor in starless cores beyond the previous upper limits using the highlyimproved angular resolution and sensitivity of herschel and measure theabundance of water vapor during evolutionary stages just preceding starformation. high spectral resolution observations of the fundamental ortho water(o-h2o) transition (557 ghz) were carried out with herschel hifi toward twostarless cores: b68, a bok globule, and l1544, a prestellar core embedded inthe taurus molecular cloud complex. the rms in the brightness temperaturemeasured for the b68 and l1544 spectra is 2.0 and 2.2 mk, respectively, in avelocity bin of 0.59 km s^-1. the continuum level is 3.5+/-0.2 mk in b68 and11.4+/-0.4 mk in l1544. no significant feature is detected in b68 and the 3sigma upper limit is consistent with a column density of o-h2o n(o-h2o) &lt;2.5x10^13 cm^-2, or a fractional abundance x(o-h2o) &lt; 1.3x10^-9, more than anorder of magnitude lower than the swas upper limit on this source. the l1544spectrum shows an absorption feature at a 5 sigma level from which we obtainthe first value of the o-h2o column density ever measured in dark clouds:n(o-h2o) = (8+/-4)x10^12 cm^-2. the corresponding fractional abundance isx(o-h2o) ~ 5x10^-9 at radii &gt; 7000 au and ~2x10^-10 toward the center. theradiative transfer analysis shows that this is consistent with a x(o-h2o)profile peaking at ~10^-8, 0.1 pc away from the core center, where bothfreeze-out and photodissociation are negligible. herschel has provided thefirst measurement of water vapor in dark regions. prestellar cores such asl1544 (with their high central densities, strong continuum, and largeenvelopes) are very promising tools to finally shed light on the solid/vaporbalance of water in molecular clouds.

1008.2513	the methanol lines and hot core of omc2-fir4, an intermediate-mass  protostar, with herschel-hifi	in contrast with numerous studies on the physical and chemical structure oflow- and high-mass protostars, much less is known about their intermediate-masscounterparts, a class of objects that could help to elucidate the mechanisms ofstar formation on both ends of the mass range. we present the first resultsfrom a rich hifi spectral dataset on an intermediate-mass protostar, omc2-fir4,obtained in the chess (chemical herschel surveys of star forming regions) keyprogramme. the more than 100 methanol lines detected between 554 and 961 ghzcover a range in upper level energy of 40 to 540 k. our physical interpretationfocusses on the hot core, but likely the cold envelope and shocked regions alsoplay a role in reality, because an analysis of the line profiles suggests thepresence of multiple emission components. an upper limit of 10^-6 is placed onthe methanol abundance in the hot core, using a population diagram, large-scalesource model and other considerations. this value is consistent with abundancespreviously seen in low-mass hot cores. furthermore, the highest energy lines atthe highest frequencies display asymmetric profiles, which may arise frominfall around the hot core.

1009.3834	spitzer spectral line mapping of protostellar outflows: ii h2 emission  in l1157	we present an analysis of spitzer-irs spectroscopic maps of the l1157protostellar outflow in the h2 pure-rotational lines from s(0) to s(7). the aimof this work is to derive the physical conditions pertaining to the warmmolecular gas and study their variations within the flow. the mid-ir h2emission follows the morphology of the precessing flow, with peaks correlatedwith individual co clumps and h2 2.12{\mu}m ro-vibrational emission. morediffuse emission delineating the co cavities is detected only in the low-layingtransitions, with j(lower) less or equal to 2. the h2 line images have beenused to construct 2d maps of n(h2), h2 ortho-to-para ratio and temperaturespectral index beta, in the assumption of a gas temperature stratificationwhere the h2 column density varies as t^(beta). variations of these parametersare observed along the flow. in particular, the ortho-to-para ratio ranges from0.6 to 2.8, highlighting the presence of regions subject to recent shocks wherethe ortho-to-para ratio has not had time yet to reach the equilibrium value.near-ir spectroscopic data on ro-vibrational h2 emission have been combinedwith the mid-ir data and used to derive additional shock parameters in thebrightest blue- and red-shifted emission knots. a high abundance of atomichydrogen (h/h2 about 0.1-0.3) is implied by the observed h2 column densities,assuming n(h2) values as derived by independent sio observations. the presenceof a high fraction of atomic hydrogen, indicates that a partially-dissociativeshock component should be considered for the h2 excitation in these localizedregions. however, planar shock models, either of c- or j-type, are not able toconsistently reproduce all the physical parameters derived from our analysis ofthe h2 emission. globally, h2 emission contributes to about 50% of the totalshock radiated energy in the l1157 outflow.

1010.3989	heavy water around the l1448-mm protostar	context: l1448-mm is the prototype of a low-mass class 0 protostar driving ahigh-velocity jet. given its bright h2o spectra observed with iso, l1448-mm isan ideal laboratory to observe heavy water (hdo) emission. aims: our aim is toimage the hdo emission in the protostar surroundings, the possible occurrenceof hdo emission also investigating off l1448-mm, towards the molecular outflow.methods: we carried out observations of l1448-mm in the hdo(1_10-1_11) line at80.6 ghz, an excellent tracer of hdo column density, with the iram plateau debure interferometer. results: we image for the first time hdo emission aroundl1448-mm. the hdo structure reveals a main clump at velocities close to theambient one towards the the continuum peak that is caused by the dust heated bythe protostar. in addition, the hdo map shows tentative weaker emission atabout 2000 au from the protostar towards the south, which is possiblyassociated with the walls of the outflow cavity opened by the protostellarwind. conclusions: using an lvg code, modelling the density and temperatureprofile of the hot-corino, and adopting a gas temperature of 100 k and adensity of 1.5 10^8 cm^-3, we derive a beam diluted hdo column density of about7 10^13 cm^-2, corresponding to a hdo abundance of about 4 10^-7. in addition,the present map supports the scenario where hdo can be efficiently produced inshocked regions and not uniquely in hot corinos heated by the newly born star.

1012.0281	the outburst of an embedded low-mass yso in l1641	strong outbursts in very young and embedded protostars are rare and not yetfully understood. they are believed to originate from an increase of the massaccretion rate onto the source. we report the discovery of a strong outburst ina low-mass embedded young stellar object (yso), namely 2mass-j05424848-0816347or [ctf93]216-2, as well as its photometric and spectroscopic follow-up. usingnear- to mid-ir photometry and nir low-resolution spectroscopy, we monitor theoutburst, deriving its magnitude, duration, as well as the enhanced accretionluminosity and mass accretion rate. [ctf93]216-2 increased in brightness by~4.6, 4.0, 3.8, and 1.9 mag in the j, h, ks bands and at 24 um, respectively,corresponding to an l_bol increase of ~20 l_sun. its early spectrum, probablytaken soon after the outburst, displays a steep almost featureless continuum,with strong co band heads and h_2o broad-band absorption features, and br gammaline in emission. a later spectrum reveals more absorption features, allowingus to estimate t_eff~3200 k, m~0.25 m_sun, and mass accretion rate~1.2x10^{-6}m_sun yr^{-1}. this makes it one of the lowest mass ysos with a strong outburstso far discovered.

0709.1060	spitzer-mips survey of the young stellar content in the vela molecular  cloud-d	a new, unbiased spitzer-mips imaging survey (~1.8 square degs) of the youngstellar content of the vela molecular cloud-d is presented. the survey iscomplete down to 5mjy and 250mjy at 24micron (mu) and 70mu, respectively. 849sources are detected at 24mu and 52 of them also have a 70mu counterpart. thevmr-d region is one that we have already partially mapped in dust and gasmillimeter emission, and we discuss the correlation between the spitzer compactsources and the mm contours. about half of the 24mu sources are located insidethe region delimited by the 12co(1-0) contours (corresponding to only one thirdof the full area mapped with mips) with a consequent density increase of about100% of the 24mu sources [four times for 70mu ones] moving from outside toinside the co contours. about 400 sources have a 2mass counterpart. so we haveconstructed a ks vs. ks-[24] diagram and identified the protostellarpopulation. we find an excess of class i sources in vmr-d in comparison withother star forming regions. this result is reasonably biased by the sensitivitylimits, or, alternatively, may reflect a very short lifetime (&lt;=10^6yr) of theprotostellar content in this cloud. the mips images have identified embeddedcool objects in most of the previously identified starless cores; in addition,there are 6 very young, possibly class 0 objects identified. finally we reportfinding of the driving sources for a set of five out of six very compactprotostellar jets previously discovered in near-infrared images.

1103.0183	simultaneous monitoring of the photometric and polarimetric activity of  the young star pv cep in the optical/near-infrared bands	we present the results of a simultaneous monitoring, lasting more than 2years, of the optical and near-infrared photometric and polarimetric activityof the variable protostar pv cep. during the monitoring period, an outburst hasoccurred in all the photometric bands, whose declining phase ($\delta$j$\approx$ 3 mag) lasted about 120 days. a time lag of $\sim$ 30 days betweenoptical and infrared light curves has been measured and interpreted in theframework of an accretion event. this latter is directly recognizable in thesignificant variations of the near-infrared colors, that appear bluer in theoutburst phase, when the star dominates the emission, and redder in decliningphase, when the disk emission prevails. all the observational data have beencombined to derive a coherent picture of the complex morphology of the whole pvcep system, that, in addition to the star and the accretion disk, is composedalso by a variable biconical nebula. in particular, the mutual interactionbetween all these components is the cause of the high value of the polarization($\approx$ 20%) and of its fluctuations. the observational data concur toindicate that pv cep is not a genuine exor star, but rather a more complexobject; moreover the case of pv cep leads to argue about the classification ofother recently discovered young sources in outburst, that have been considered,maybe over-simplifying, as exor.

0704.2685	pdbi sub-arcsecond study of the sio microjet in hh212 - origin and  collimation of class 0 jets	the bipolar hh 212 outflow has been mapped in sio using the extendedconfiguration of the plateau de bure interferometer (pdbi), revealing a highlycollimated sio jet closely associated with the h2 jet component. we study atunprecedented resolution (0.34" across the jet axis) the properties of theinnermost sio ``microjet'' within 1000 au of this young class 0 source, tocompare it with atomic microjets from more evolved sources and to constrain itsorigin. the sio channel maps are used to investigate the microjet collimationand velocity structure. a large velocity gradient analysis is applied to sio(2-1), (5-4) and (8-7) data from the pdbi and the submillimeter array toconstrain the sio opacity and abundance. the hh212 class 0 microjet showsstriking similarities in collimation and energetic budget with atomic microjetsfrom t tauri sources. furthermore, the sio lines appear optically thick, unlikewhat is generally assumed. we infer t(kin) ~ 50-500 k and an sio/h2 abundancegreater than 4 10(-8)-6 10(-5) for n(h2) = 10(7)-10(5) cm(-3), i.e. 0.05-90% ofthe elemental silicon. this similar jet width, regardless of the presence of adense envelope, definitely rules out jet collimation by external pressure, andfavors a common mhd self-collimation (and possibly acceleration) process at allstages of star formation. we propose that the more abundant sio in class 0 jetscould mainly result from rapid (less than 25 yrs) molecular synthesis at highjet densities.

1106.2722	spitzer spectral line mapping of protostellar outflows: iii - h_2  emission in l1448, bhr71, and ngc2071	spitzer-irs maps of h_2 pure rotational lines from s(0) to s(7) in 3 outflowsfrom class 0 sources - l1448, bhr71, and ngc2071 - are presented. these linesare used, in conjunction with available rovibrational, near-ir h_2 lines, toprobe the physical conditions of the warm gas between hundreds and thousands ofkelvin. we have constructed maps of the molecular hydrogen column density,ortho-to-para ratio and volume density, together with the index beta of thepower law describing the distribution of gas temperature. in all threeoutflows, the present ortho-to-para ratio significantly deviates from the hightemperature equilibrium of 3, being on average between 2.0 and 2.3. these lowvalues, that reflect the young age of these flows, are found also in regions ofrelatively high temperature (~ 1000 k), likely indicating that shocks areoccurring in a time shorter than that needed for a complete para to orthoconversion. density maps indicate upper limits close to lte conditions, i.e.between 10^6-10^7 cm^-3; moreover we demonstrate, based on the detections of hdemission spots (r(3) and r(4) lines), that a density stratification does exist,with the low density components (10^4-10^5 cm^-3) associated with the coldestgas. the beta index is found in all flows to be above 3.8: this value isconsistent with predictions of multiple c-type bow shocks with a range ofvelocities, some of which insufficient to achieve the temperature at which h_2partially dissociates. the contribution of h_2 to the total cooling isquantitatively similar to that of other abundant molecules emitting in thefar-infrared, such as water and co; moreover, the luminosity radiated away iscomparable with the estimated kinetic energy of the swept-out outflow: thissupports the scenario in which the shock from which h_2 is emitted is alsocapable of accelerating the molecular outflow driven at the shock workingsurface.

1106.5440	herschel observations of the herbig-haro objects hh52-54	we are aiming at the observational estimation of the relative contribution tothe cooling by co and h2o, as this provides decisive information for theunderstanding of the oxygen chemistry behind interstellar shock waves. methods.the high sensitivity of hifi, in combination with its high spectral resolutioncapability, allows us to trace the h2o outflow wings at unprecedentedsignal-to-noise. from the observation of spectrally resolved h2o and co linesin the hh52-54 system, both from space and from ground, we arrive at thespatial and velocity distribution of the molecular outflow gas. solving thestatistical equilibrium and non-lte radiative transfer equations provides uswith estimates of the physical parameters of this gas, including the coolingrate ratios of the species. the radiative transfer is based on an ali code,where we use the fact that variable shock strengths, distributed along thefront, are naturally implied by a curved surface. based on observations of coand h2o spectral lines, we conclude that the emission is confined to the hh54region. the quantitative analysis of our observations favours a ratio of theco-to-h2o-cooling-rate &gt;&gt; 1. from the best-fit model to the co emission, wearrive at an h2o abundance close to 1e-5. the line profiles exhibit twocomponents, one of which is triangular and another, which is a superposed,additional feature. this additional feature likely originates from a regionsmaller than the beam where the ortho-water abundance is smaller than in thequiescent gas. comparison with recent shock models indicate that a planar shockcan not easily explain the observed line strengths and triangular lineprofiles.we conclude that the geometry can play an important role. althoughabundances support a scenario where j-type shocks are present, higher coolingrate ratios than predicted by these type of shocks are derived.

1108.2622	poisson project - i - emission lines as accretion tracers in young  stellar objects: results from observations of chamaeleon i and ii sources	we present the results of the analysis of lr optical-nir spectra (0.6-2.4 um)of a sample 47 ysos in the chai and ii star-forming clouds. these data are partof the poisson project (protostellar optical-infrared spectral survey on ntt).the aim is to determine the accretion luminosity (lacc) and mass accretion rate(macc) of the sources through the analysis of the detected emission features.we also aim at verifying the reliability and consistency of the existingempirical relationships connecting emission line luminosity and lacc. we employfive tracers (oi-6300a, ha, caii-8542a, pab, and brg) to derive the accretionluminosity. the tracers provide lacc values showing different scatters whenplotted as a function of l*. the brg seems to be the most reliable, because itgives the minimum lacc dispersion over the entire range of l*, whereas theother tracers provide much more scattered lacc values, which are not expectedfor our homogeneous sample. the comparison between lacc(brg) and lacc obtainedfrom the other tracers also shows systematic differences among the empiricalrelationships. these may probably be ascribed to different excitationmechanisms contributing to the line emission, which may vary between our sampleand those where the relationships were calibrated. adopting the lacc derivedfrom brg, we find lacc=0.1l*-1l* for all sources, and macc of the order of10^-7-10^-9 msun/yr. the macc derived in chai are proportional to m*^2, asfound in other low-mass star-forming regions. the discrepancies observed in thecase of lacc(brg) and lacc(pab) can be related to different intrinsic pab/brg,ratios. the derived ratios show the existence of two different emissionmodalities, one that agrees with predictions of both wind and accretion models,the other suggesting optically thick emission from relatively small regions(10^21-10^22 cm^-3) with gas at low temperatures (&lt;4000k).

0711.2596	tracing the origins of permitted emission lines in ru lupi down to au  scales	most of the observed emission lines and continuum excess from young accretinglow mass stars (classical t tauri stars -- cttss) take place in the star-diskor inner disk region. these regions have a complex emission topology stilllargely unknown. in this paper the magnetospheric accretion and inner windcontributions to the observed permitted he and h near infrared (nir) lines ofthe bright southern ctts ru lupi are investigated for the first time. previousoptical observations of ru lupi showed a large h-alpha profile, due to theemission from a wind in the line wings, and a micro-jet detected in forbiddenlines. we extend this analysis to nir lines through seeing-limited highspectral resolution spectra taken with vlt/isaac, and adaptive optics (ao)aided narrow-band imaging and low spectral resolution spectroscopy withvlt/naco. using spectro-astrometric analysis we investigate the presence ofextended emission down to very low spatial scales (a few au). the hei 10830line presents a p cygni profile whose absorption feature indicates the presenceof an inner stellar wind. moreover the spectro-astrometric analysis evidencesthe presence of an extended emission superimposed to the absorption feature andlikely coming from the micro-jet detected in the optical. on the contrary, theorigin of the hydrogen paschen and brackett lines is difficult to address. wetried tentatively to explain the observed line profiles and flux ratios withboth accretion and wind models showing the limits of both approaches. the lackof spectro-astrometric signal indicates that the hi emission is either compactor symmetric. our analysis confirms the sensitivity of the hei line to thepresence of faint extended emission regions in the close proximity of the star.

1208.4140	the chess survey of the l1157-b1 shock region: co spectral signatures of  jet-driven bowshocks	the unprecedented sensitivity of herschel coupled with the high resolution ofthe hifi spectrometer permits studies of the intensity-velocity relationshipi(v) in molecular outflows, over a higher excitation range than possible up tonow. in the course of the chess key program, we have observed toward the brightbowshock region l1157-b1 the co rotational transitions between j=5-4 andj=16-15 with hifi, and the j=1-0, 2-1 and 3-2 with the iram-30m and the csotelescopes. we find that all the line profiles i_{co}(v) are well fit by alinear combination of three exponential laws exp(-|v/v_0|) with v_0= 12.5, 4.4and 2.5km/s. the first component dominates the co emission at j_up &gt; 13, aswell as the high-excitation lines of sio and h2o. the second componentdominates for 3 &lt; j_up &lt; 10 and the third one for j_up &lt; 2. we show that theseexponentials are the signature of quasi-isothermal shocked gas components: theimpact of the jet against the l1157-b1 bowshock (t= 210k), the walls of theoutflow cavity associated with b1 (t= 64k) and the older cavity l1157-b2 (t=23k), respectively. analysis of the co line flux in the large-velocity gradientapproximation further shows that the emission arises from dense gas (n(h2) &gt;1e5-1e6 cm-3) close to lte up to j=20. we find that the co j=2-1intensity-velocity relation observed in various other molecular outflows issatisfactorily fit by similar exponential laws, which may hold an importantclue to their entrainment process.

1209.0294	h2o line mapping at high spatial and spectral resolution - herschel  observations of the vla1623 outflow	apart from being an important coolant, h2o is known to be a tracer ofhigh-velocity molecular gas. recent models predict relatively high abundancesbehind interstellar shockwaves. the dynamical and physical conditions of theh2o emitting gas, however, are not fully understood yet. we aim to determinethe abundance and distribution of h2o, its kinematics and the physicalconditions of the gas responsible for the h2o emission. the observed lineprofile shapes help us understand the dynamics in molecular outflows. we mappedthe vla1623 outflow, in the ground-state transitions of o-h2o, with the hifiand pacs instruments. we also present observations of higher energy transitionsof o-h2o and p-h2o obtained with hifi and pacs towards selected outflowpositions. from comparison with non-lte radiative transfer calculations, weestimate the physical parameters of the water emitting regions. the observedwater emission line profiles vary over the mapped area. spectral features andcomponents, tracing gas in different excitation conditions, allow us toconstrain the density and temperature of the gas. the h2o emission originatesin a region where temperatures are comparable to that of the warm h2 gas(t\gtrsim200k). thus, the h2o emission traces a gas component significantlywarmer than the gas responsible for the low-j co emission. the h2o columndensities at the co peak positions are low, i.e. n(h2o) \simeq (0.03-10)x10e14cm-2. the h2o abundance with respect to h2 in the extended outflow is estimatedat x(h2o)&lt;1x10e-6, significantly lower than what would be expected from mostrecent shock models. the h2o emission traces a gas component moving atrelatively high velocity compared to the low-j co emitting gas. however, otherdynamical quantities such as the momentum rate, energy and mechanicalluminosity are estimated to be the same, independent of the molecular tracerused, co or h2o.

1210.7178	mapping water in protostellar outflows with herschel: pacs and hifi  observations of l1448-c	we investigate on the spatial and velocity distribution of h2o along thel1448 outflow, its relationship with other tracers, and its abundancevariations, using maps of the o-h2o 1_{10}-1_{01} and 2_{12}-1_{01} transitionstaken with the herschel-hifi and pacs instruments, respectively. water emissionappears clumpy, with individual peaks corresponding to shock spots along theoutflow. the bulk of the 557 ghz line is confined to radial velocities in therange \pm 10-50 km/s but extended emission associated with the l1448-c extremehigh velocity (ehv) jet is also detected. the h2o 1_{10}-1_{01}/co(3-2) ratioshows strong variations as a function of velocity that likely reflect differentand changing physical conditions in the gas responsible for the emissions fromthe two species. in the ehv jet, a low h2o/sio abundance ratio is inferred,that could indicate molecular formation from dust free gas directly ejectedfrom the proto-stellar wind. we derive averaged tkin and n(h2) values of about300-500 k and 5 10^6 cm-3 respectively, while a water abundance with respect toh2 of the order of 0.5-1 10^{-6} along the outflow is estimated. the fairlyconstant conditions found all along the outflow implies that evolutionaryeffects on the timescales of outflow propagation do not play a major role inthe h2o chemistry. the results of our analysis show that the bulk of theobserved h2o lines comes from post-shocked regions where the gas, after beingheated to high temperatures, has been already cooled down to a few hundred k.the relatively low derived abundances, however, call for some mechanism todiminish the h2o gas in the post-shock region. among the possible scenarios, wefavor h2o photodissociation, which requires the superposition of a low velocitynon-dissociative shock with a fast dissociative shock able to produce a fuvfield of sufficient strength.

[oi] and some of the oh emission probe dissociative shocks in theinner envelope. the total far-infrared cooling is dominated by h2o and co, with[oi] increasing for class i sources.

1302.1410	water vapor in the protoplanetary disk of dg tau	water is key in the evolution of protoplanetary disks and the formation ofcomets and icy/water planets. while high excitation water lines originating inthe hot inner disk have been detected in several t tauri stars (ttss), watervapor from the outer disk, where most of water ice reservoir is stored, wasonly reported in the closeby tts tw hya. we present spectrally resolvedherschel/hifi observations of the young tts dg tau in the ortho- and para-water ground-state transitions at 557, 1113 ghz. the lines show a narrowdouble-peaked profile, consistent with an origin in the outer disk, and are~19-26 times brighter than in tw hya. in contrast, co and [c ii] lines aredominated by emission from the envelope/outflow, which makes h2o lines a uniquetracer of the disk of dg tau. disk modeling with the thermo-chemical codeprodimo indicates that the strong uv field, due to the young age and strongaccretion of dg tau, irradiates a disk upper layer at 10-90 au from the star,heating it up to temperatures of 600 k and producing the observed bright waterlines. the models suggest a disk mass of 0.015-0.1 msun, consistent with theestimated minimum mass of the solar nebula before planet formation, and a waterreservoir of ~1e2-1e3 earth oceans in vapour, and ~100 times larger in the formof ice. hence, this detection supports the scenario of ocean delivery onterrestrial planets by impact of icy bodies forming in the outer disk.

1302.3420	spitzer-irac survey of molecular jets in vela-d	we present a survey of h2 jets from young protostars in the vela-d molecularcloud (vmr-d), based on spitzer -irac data between 3.6 and 8.0 micron. oursearch has led to the identification of 15 jets and about 70 well aligned knotswithin 1.2 squared degree. we compare the irac maps with observations of the h21-0 s(1) line at 2.12 micron, with a spitzer-mips map at 24 and 70 micron, andwith a map of the dust continuum emission at 1.2 mm. we find a associationbetween molecular jets and dust peaks. the jet candidate exciting sources havebeen searched for in the published catalog of the young stellar objects ofvmr-d. we selected all the sources of class ii or earlier which are locatedclose to the jet center and aligned with it.the association between jet andexciting source was validated by estimating the differential extinction betweenthe jet opposite lobes. we are able to find a best-candidate exciting source inall but two jets. four exciting sources are not (or very barely) observed atwavelengths shorter than 24 micron, suggesting they are very young protostars.three of them are also associated with the most compact jets. the excitingsource spectral energy distributions have been modeled by means of thephotometric data between 1.2 micron and 1.2 mm. from seds fits we derive themain source parameters, which indicate that most of them are low-massprotostars. a significant correlation is found between the projected jet lengthand the [24] - [70] color, which is consistent with an evolutionary scenarioaccording to which shorter jets are associated with younger sources. a roughcorrelation is found between irac line cooling and exciting source bolometricluminosity, in agreement with the previous literature. the emerging trendsuggests that mass loss and mass accretion are tightly related phenomena andthat both decrease with time.

1309.5827	the diagnostic potential of fe lines applied to protostellar jets	we investigate the diagnostic capabilities of the iron lines for tracing thephysical conditions of the shock-excited gas in jets driven by pre-mainsequence stars. we have analyzed the 300-2500 nm x-shooter spectra of two jetsdriven by the pre-main sequence stars eso-halpha 574 and par-lup 3-4. bothspectra are very rich in [feii] lines over the whole spectral range; inaddition, lines from [feiii] are detected in the eso-h\alpha 574 spectrum. nltecodes along with codes for the ionization equilibrium are used to derive thegas excitation conditions of electron temperature and density, and fractionalionization. the iron gas-phase abundance is provided by comparing the ironlines emissivity with that of [oi] 630 nm. the [feii] lines indicate eso-halpha574 jet is, on average, colder (t_e = 9000 k), less dense (n_e = 2 10^4 cm^-3)and more ionized (x_e = 0.7) than the par-lup 3-4 jet (t_e = 13000 k, n_e = 610^4 cm^-3, x_e &lt; 0.4), even if the existence of a higher density component(n_e = 2 10^5 cm^-3) is probed by the [feiii] and [feii] ultra-violet lines.theoretical models suggest that the shock at work in eso-halpha 574 is fasterand likely more energetic than the par-lup 3-4 shock. this latter feature isconfirmed by the high percentage of gas-phase iron measured in eso-halpha 574(50-60% of its solar abundance in comparison with less than 30% in par-lup3-4), which testifies that the eso-halpha 574 shock is powerful enough topartially destroy the dust present inside the jet. this work demonstrates thata multiline fe analysis can be effectively used to probe the excitation andionization conditions of the gas in a jet without any assumption on ionicabundances. the main limitation on the diagnostics resides in the largeuncertainties of the atomic data, which, however, can be overcome through astatistical approach involving many lines.

1402.3553	jets and outflows from star to cloud: observations confront theory	in this review we focus on the role jets and outflows play in the star andplanet formation process. our essential question can be posed as follows: arejets/outflows merely an epiphenomenon associated with star formation or do theyplay an important role in mediating the physics of assembling stars bothindividually and globally? we address this question by reviewing the currentstate of observations and their key points of contact with theory. our reviewof jet/outflow phenomena is organized into three length-scale domains: sourceand disk scales ($0.1-10^2$ au) where the connection with protostellar and diskevolution theories is paramount; envelope scales ($10^2-10^5$ au) where thechemistry and propagation shed further light on the jet launching process, itsvariability and its impact on the infalling envelope; parent cloud scales($10^5-10^6$ au) where global momentum injection into cluster/cloudenvironments become relevant. issues of feedback are of particular importanceon the smallest scales where planet formation regions in a disk may be impactedby the presence of disk winds, irradiation by jet shocks or shielding by thewinds. feedback on envelope scales may determine the final stellar mass(core-to-star efficiency) and envelope dissipation. feedback also plays animportant role on the larger scales with outflows contributing to turbulentsupport within clusters including alteration of cluster star formationefficiencies (feedback on larger scales currently appears unlikely). aparticularly novel dimension of our review is that we consider results on jetdynamics from the emerging field of high energy density laboratory astrophysics(hedla). hedla is now providing direct insights into the 3-d dynamics of fullymagnetized, hypersonic, radiative outflows.

0803.2012	molecular jets driven by high-mass protostars: a detailed study of the  iras 20126+4104 jet	we present here an extensive analysis of the protostellar jet driven by iras20126+4104, deriving the kinematical, dynamical, and physical conditions of theh2 gas along the flow. the jet has been investigated by means of near-ir h2 and[feii] narrow-band imaging, high resolution spectroscopy of the 1-0s(1) line(2.12 um), nir (0.9-2.5 um) low resolution spectroscopy, along with iso-sws andlws spectra (from 2.4 to 200 um). the flow shows a complex morphology. inaddition to the large-scale jet precession presented in previous studies, wedetect a small-scale wiggling close to the source, that may indicate thepresence of a multiple system. the peak radial velocities of the h2 knots rangefrom -42 to -14 km s^-1 in the blue lobe, and from -8 to 47 km s^-1 in the redlobe. the low resolution spectra are rich in h_2 emission, and relatively faint[feii] (nir), [oi] and [cii] (fir) emission is observed in the region close tothe source. a warm h2 gas component has an average excitation temperature thatranges between 2000 k and 2500 k. additionally, the iso-sws spectrum revealsthe presence of a cold component (520 k), that strongly contributes to theradiative cooling of the flow and plays a major role in the dynamics of theflow. the estimated l(h2) of the jet is 8.2+/-0.7 l_sun, suggesting thatiras20126+4104 has an accretion rate significantly increased compared tolow-mass ysos. this is also supported by the derived mass flux rate from the h2lines (mflux(h2)~7.5x10^-4 m_sun yr^-1). the comparison between the h2 and theoutflow parameters strongly indicates that the jet is driving, at leastpartially, the outflow. as already found for low-mass protostellar jets, themeasured h2 outflow luminosity is tightly related to the source bolometricluminosity.

1407.6229	the alma view of the protostellar system hh212 - the wind, the cavity,  and the disk	context: because it is viewed simply edge-on, the hh212 protostellar systemis an ideal laboratory for studying the interplay of infall, outflow, androtation in the earliest stages of low-mass star formation. aims: we wish toexploit the unmatched combination of high angular resolution, high sensitivity,high-imaging fidelity, and spectral coverage provided by alma to shed light onthe complex kinematics of the innermost central regions of hh212. methods: wemapped the inner 10" (4500 au) of the hh212 system at about 0.5 arcsecresolution in several molecular tracers and in the 850 $\mu$m dust continuumusing the alma interferometer in band 7 in the extended configuration of theearly science cycle 0 operations. results: within a single alma spectralset-up, we simultaneously identify all the crucial ingredients known to beinvolved in the star formation recipe namely: (i) the fast, collimated bipolarsio jet driven by the protostar, (ii) the large-scale swept-up co outflow,(iii) the flattened rotating and infalling envelope, with bipolar cavitiescarved by the outflow (in c$^{17}$o(3--2)), and (iv) a rotating wide-angle flowthat fills the cavities and surrounding the axial jet (in c$^{34}$s(7--6)). inaddition, the compact high-velocity c$^{17}$o emission ($\pm$ 1.9--3.5 kms$^{-1}$ from systemic) shows a velocity gradient along the equatorial planeconsistent with a rotating disk of about 0.2 arcsec = 90 au around a $\simeq0.3 \pm 0.1 m_{\rm \odot}$ source. the rotating disk is possibly keplerian.conclusions: hh212 is the third class 0 protostar with possible signatures of akeplerian disk of radius $\geq 30 au$. the warped geometry in our cs datasuggests that this large keplerian disk might result from misaligned magneticand rotation axes during the collapse phase. the wide-angle cs flow suggeststhat disk winds may be present in this source.

1408.5011	accretion-ejection connection in the young brown dwarf candidate  iso-cha1 217	as the number of observed brown dwarf outflows is growing it is important toinvestigate how these outflows compare to the well studied jets from youngstellar objects. a key point of comparison is the relationship between outflowand accretion activity and in particular the ratio between the mass outflow andaccretion rates ($\dot{m}_{out}$/$\dot{m}_{acc}$). the brown dwarf candidateiso-chai 217 was discovered by our group, as part of a spectro-astrometricstudy of brown dwarfs, to be driving an asymmetric outflow with theblue-shifted lobe having a position angle of $\sim$ 20$^{\circ}$. the aim hereis to further investigate the properties of iso-chai 217, the morphology andkinematics of its outflow, and to better constrain($\dot{m}_{out}$/$\dot{m}_{acc}$). the outflow is spatially resolved in the$[sii]\lambda \lambda 6716,6731$ lines and is detected out to $\sim$ 1\farcs6in the blue-shifted lobe and ~ 1" in the red-shifted lobe. the asymmetrybetween the two lobes is confirmed although the velocity asymmetry is lesspronounced with respect to our previous study. using thirteen differentaccretion tracers we measure log($\dot{m}_{acc}$) [m$_{sun}$/yr]= -10.6 $\pm$0.4. as it was not possible to measure the effect of extinction on the iso-chai217 outflow $\dot{m}_{out}$ was derived for a range of values of a$_{v}$, up toa value of a$_{v}$ = 2.5 mag estimated for the source extinction. the logarithmof the mass outflow ($\dot{m}_{out}$) was estimated in the range -11.7 to -11.1for both jets combined. thus $\dot{m}_{out}$/$\dot{m}_{acc}$ [\msun/yr] liesbelow the maximum value predicted by magneto-centrifugal jet launching models.finally, both model fitting of the balmer decrements and spectro-astrometricanalysis of the h$\alpha$ line show that the bulk of the h i emission comesfrom the accretion flow.

1409.2779	first spectrally-resolved h$_2$ observations towards hh 54 / low h$_2$o  abundance in shocks	context: herschel observations suggest that the h$_2$o distribution inoutflows from low-mass stars resembles the h$_2$ emission. it is still unclearwhich of the different excitation components that characterise the mid- andnear-ir h$_2$ distribution is associated with h$_2$o. aim: the aim is tospectrally resolve the different excitation components observed in the h$_2$emission. this will allow us to identify the h$_2$ counterpart associated withh$_2$o and finally derive directly an h$_2$o abundance estimate with respect toh$_2$. methods: we present new high spectral resolution observations of h$_2$0-0 s(4), 0-0 s(9), and 1-0 s(1) towards hh 54, a bright nearby shock region inthe southern sky. in addition, new herschel-hifi h$_2$o (2$_{12}$$-$1$_{01}$)observations at 1670~ghz are presented. results: our observations show for thefirst time a clear separation in velocity of the different h$_2$ lines: the 0-0s(4) line at the lowest excitation peaks at $-$7~km~s$^{-1}$, while the moreexcited 0-0 s(9) and 1-0 s(1) lines peak at $-$15~km~s$^{-1}$. h$_2$o andhigh-$j$ co appear to be associated with the h$_2$ 0-0 s(4) emission, whichtraces a gas component with a temperature of 700$-$1000 k. the h$_2$o abundancewith respect to h$_2$ 0-0 s(4) is estimated to be$x$(h$_2$o)$&lt;$1.4$\times$10$^{-5}$ in the shocked gas over an area of13$^{\prime\prime}$. conclusions: we resolve two distinct gas componentsassociated with the hh 54 shock region at different velocities and excitations.this allows us to constrain the temperature of the h$_2$o emitting gas($\leq$1000 k) and to derive correct estimates of h$_2$o abundance in theshocked gas, which is lower than what is expected from shock model predictions.

1409.4658	shockingly low water abundances in herschel / pacs observations of  low-mass protostars in perseus	protostars interact with their surroundings through jets and winds impactingon the envelope and creating shocks, but the nature of these shocks is stillpoorly understood. our aim is to survey far-infrared molecular line emissionfrom a uniform and significant sample of deeply-embedded low-mass young stellarobjects in order to characterize shocks and the possible role of ultravioletradiation in the immediate protostellar environment. herschel/pacs spectralmaps of 22 objects in the perseus molecular cloud were obtained as part of the`william herschel line legacy' survey. line emission from h$_\mathrm{2}$o, co,and oh is tested against shock models from the literature.  observed line ratios are remarkably similar and do not show variations withsource physical parameters. observations show good agreement with the shockmodels when line ratios of the same species are compared. ratios of varioush$_\mathrm{2}$o lines provide a particularly good diagnostic of pre-shock gasdensities, $n_\mathrm{h}\sim10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$, in agreement with typicaldensities obtained from observations of the post-shock gas. the correspondingshock velocities, obtained from comparison with co line ratios, are above 20km\,s$^{-1}$. however, the observations consistently show one-to-two orders ofmagnitude lower h$_\mathrm{2}$o-to-co and h$_\mathrm{2}$o-to-oh line ratiosthan predicted by the existing shock models.  the overestimated model h$_\mathrm{2}$o fluxes are most likely caused by anoverabundance of h$_\mathrm{2}$o in the models since the excitation iswell-reproduced. illumination of the shocked material by ultraviolet photonsproduced either in the star-disk system or, more locally, in the shock, woulddecrease the h$_\mathrm{2}$o abundances and reconcile the models withobservations. detections of hot h$_\mathrm{2}$o and strong oh lines supportthis scenario.

1409.5704	water in star-forming regions with herschel (wish) v. the physical  conditions in low-mass protostellar outflows revealed by multi-transition  water observations	context: outflows are an important part of the star formation process as boththe result of ongoing active accretion and one of the main sources ofmechanical feedback on small scales. water is the ideal tracer of these effectsbecause it is present in high abundance in various parts of the protostar.method: we present \textit{herschel} hifi spectra of multiple water-transitionstowards 29 nearby class 0/i protostars as part of the wish survey. these aredecomposed into different gaussian components, with each related to one ofthree parts of the protostellar system; quiescent envelope, cavity shock andspot shocks in the jet and at the base of the outflow. we then constrain theexcitation conditions present in the two outflow-related components. results:water emission is optically thick but effectively thin, with line ratios thatdo not vary with velocity, in contrast to co. the physical conditions of thecavity and spot shocks are similar, with post-shock h$_{2}$ densities of order10$^{5}-$10$^{8}$\,cm$^{-3}$ and h$_{2}$o column densities of order10$^{16}-$10$^{18}$\,cm$^{-2}$. h$_{2}$o emission originates in compactemitting regions: for the spot shocks these correspond to point sources withradii of order 10-200\,au, while for the cavity shocks these come from a thinlayer along the outflow cavity wall with thickness of order 1-30\,au.conclusions: water emission at the source position traces two distinctkinematic components in the outflow; j shocks at the base of the outflow or inthe jet, and c shocks in a thin layer in the cavity wall. class i sources havesimilar excitation conditions to class 0 sources, but generally smallerline-widths and emitting region sizes. we suggest that it is the velocity ofthe wind driving the outflow, rather than the decrease in envelope density ormass, that is the cause of the decrease in h$_{2}$o intensity between class 0and i.

1409.8111	resolving the shocked gas in hh54 with herschel: co line mapping at high  spatial and spectral resolution	the hh54 shock is a herbig-haro object, located in the nearby chamaeleon iicloud. observed co line profiles are due to a complex distribution in density,temperature, velocity, and geometry. resolving the hh54 shock wave in thefar-infrared cooling lines of co constrain the kinematics, morphology, andphysical conditions of the shocked region. we used the pacs and spireinstruments on board the herschel space observatory to map the full firspectrum in a region covering the hh54 shock wave. complementary herschel-hifi,apex, and spitzer data are used in the analysis as well. the observed featuresin the line profiles are reproduced using a 3d radiative transfer model of abow-shock, constructed with the line modeling engine code (lime). the firemission is confined to the hh54 region and a coherent displacement of thelocation of the emission maximum of co with increasing j is observed. the peakpositions of the high-j co lines are shifted upstream from the lower j co linesand coincide with the position of the spectral feature identified previously inco(10-9) profiles with hifi. this indicates a hotter molecular component in theupstream gas with distinct dynamics. the coherent displacement with increasingj for co is consistent with a scenario where iras12500-7658 is the excitingsource of the flow, and the 180 k bow-shock is accompanied by a hot (800 k)molecular component located upstream from the apex of the shock and blueshiftedby -7 km s$^{-1}$. the spatial proximity of this knot to the peaks of theatomic fine-structure emission lines observed with spitzer and pacs ([oi]63,145 $\mu$m) suggests that it may be associated with the dissociative shock asthe jet impacts slower moving gas in the hh54 bow-shock.

1410.0181	poisson project - iii - investigating the evolution of the mass  accretion rate	as part of the poisson project (protostellar optical-infrared spectral surveyon ntt), we present the results of the analysis of low-resolution nir spectra0.9-2.4 um) of two samples of ysos in lupus and serpens (52 and 17 objects),with masses 0.1-2.0 msun and ages from 10^5 to a few 10^7 yr. after determiningthe accretion parameters of the lup and ser targets by analysing their hinear-ir emission features, we added the results to those from previous regions(investigated in poisson with the same methodology). we obtained a finalcatalogue (143 objects) of mass accretion rates (macc) derived in a homogeneousfashion and analysed how macc correlates with m* and how it evolves in time. wederived the accretion luminosity (lacc) and macc for lup and ser objects fromthe br_gamma line by using relevant empirical relationships from the literaturethat connect hi line luminosity and lacc. to minimise the biases and also forself-consistency, we re-derived mass and age for each source using the same setof evolutionary tracks. we observe a correlation maccm*^2.2, similarly to whathas previously been observed in several star-forming clouds. the time variationof macc is roughly consistent with the expected evolution in viscous disks,with an asymptotic decay that behaves as t^-1.6. however, macc values arecharacterised by a large scatter at similar ages and are on average higher thanthe predictions of viscous models. although part of the scattering may berelated to the employed empirical relationship and to uncertainties on thesingle measurements, the general distribution and decay trend of the maccpoints are real. these findings might be indicative of a large variation in theinitial mass of the disks, of fairly different viscous laws among disks, ofvarying accretion regimes, and of other mechanisms that add to the dissipationof the disks, such as photo-evaporation.

1410.8304	empirical determination of einstein a-coefficient ratios of bright [fe  ii] lines	the einstein spontaneous rates (a-coefficients) of fe^+ lines have beencomputed by several authors, with results that differ from each other up to40%. consequently, models for line emissivities suffer from uncertainties whichin turn affect the determination of the physical conditions at the base of lineexcitation. we provide an empirical determination of the a-coefficient ratiosof bright [fe ii] lines, which would represent both a valid benchmark fortheoretical computations and a reference for the physical interpretation of theobserved lines. with the eso-vlt x-shooter instrument between 3,000 a, and24,700 a, we obtained a spectrum of the bright herbig-haro object hh1. wedetect around 100 [fe ii] lines, some of which with a signal-to-noise ratio &gt;100. among these latter, we selected those emitted by the same level, whosede-reddened intensity ratio is a direct function of the einstein a-coefficientratios. from the same x-shooter spectrum, we got an accurate estimate of theextinction toward hh1 through intensity ratios of atomic species, hi,recombination lines and h_2 ro-vibrational transitions. we provide sevenreliable a-ooefficient ratios between bright [fe ii] lines, which are comparedwith the literature determinations. in particular, the a-coefficient ratiosinvolving the brightest near-infrared lines (12570a/16440a and 13209a/16440a)are better in agreement with the predictions by quinet et al. (1996)relativistic hartree-fock model. however, none of the theoretical modelspredicts a-coefficient ratios in agreement with all our determinations. we alsoshow that literature data of near-infrared intensity ratios better agree withour determinations than with theoretical expectations.

0807.1062	vsi: the vlti spectro-imager	the vlti spectro imager (vsi) was proposed as a second-generation instrumentof the very large telescope interferometer providing the eso community withspectrally-resolved, near-infrared images at angular resolutions down to 1.1milliarcsecond and spectral resolutions up to r=12000. targets as faint as k=13will be imaged without requiring a brighter nearby reference object. the uniquecombination of high-dynamic-range imaging at high angular resolution and highspectral resolution enables a scientific program which serves a broad usercommunity and at the same time provides the opportunity for breakthroughs inmany areas of astrophysic including: probing the initial conditions for planetformation in the au-scale environments of young stars; imaging convective cellsand other phenomena on the surfaces of stars; mapping the chemical and physicalenvironments of evolved stars, stellar remnants, and stellar winds; anddisentangling the central regions of active galactic nuclei and supermassiveblack holes. vsi will provide these new capabilities using technologies whichhave been extensively tested in the past and vsi requires little in terms ofnew infrastructure on the vlti. at the same time, vsi will be able to makemaximum use of new infrastructure as it becomes available; for example, bycombining 4, 6 and eventually 8 telescopes, enabling rapid imaging through themeasurement of up to 28 visibilities in every wavelength channel within a fewminutes. the current studies are focused on a 4-telescope version with anupgrade to a 6-telescope one. the instrument contains its own fringe trackerand tip-tilt control in order to reduce the constraints on the vltiinfrastructure and maximize the scientific return.

astro-ph;0003031	iso spectroscopy of the hh 7-11 flow and its red-shifted counterpart	we have used the two spectrometers on the infrared space observatory toobserve the hh 7-11 flow, its red-shifted counterpart, and the candidateexciting source svs 13, in the star formation region ngc 1333. we detect atomic([oi]63um and 145um, [siii]34.8um, [cii]158um) and molecular (h_2, co, h_2o)lines at various positions along the bipolar flow.  most of the observed lines can be explained in terms of shock-excitedemission. in particular, our analysis shows that dissociative (j-type) andnon-dissociative (c-type) shocks are simultaneously present everywhere alongboth lobes of the flow. we confirm the low-excitation nature of the herbig-haronebulosities, with shock velocities &lt;40-50 km/s. toward both lobes of theoutflow we find pre-shock densities of n_0~10^4 cm-3 for both the j and ccomponents, implying b_0~100ug. in the central region of the flow, close to theexciting source, the pre-shock density deduced for the c-shock component isn_0~10^5 cm-3, suggesting a magnetic field ~3 times stronger. we propose thatthe deficiency of gas-phase water in the post c-shock regions is due tofreezing onto warm grains processed through the j-shock front and travelingalong the magnetic field lines. the total observed cooling from thedissociative shock components is consistent with the power lost by a slowmolecular outflow accelerated by a fast neutral hi wind.  finally, the skin of the cloud seen in projection toward the flow appears tobe weakly photo-ionised by bd +30 549, the dominant illuminating source of thengc 1333 reflection nebula.

astro-ph;0007319	the iso-lws map of the serpens cloud core: i. the seds of the ir/smm  sources	iso-lws mapping observations of the serpens molecular cloud core arepresented. the spectral range is 50 - 200 micron and the map size is 8' x 8'.these observations suffer from severe source confusion at fir wavelengths andwe employ a maximum likelihood method for the spectro-spatial deconvolution.the strong and fairly isolated source smm1 firs1 presented a test case, whosemodelled spectral energy distribution (sed), within observational errors, isidentical to the observed one. the model results for the other infrared andsubmillimetre sources are therefore likely to represent their correct seds.simulations demonstrating the reliability and potential of the developed methodsupport this view. for the majority of sources the peak of the seds is foundwithin the spectral range of the lws and derived temperatures are generallyhigher (&gt;30k) than have been found by earlier deconvolution attempts using irasdata. smm sizes are found to be only a few arcsec in diameter. in addition, thesmms are generally optically thick even at lws wavelengths. self-consistentradiative transfer calculations indicates that the smms are optically thick outto even longer wavelengths. models were calculated for five sources, for whichsufficient data were available, viz. smm 1, 2, 3, 4 and 9. these models areoptically thick out to millimetre wavelengths (wavelength of unit optical depth900 to 1400 micron). envelope masses for these smms are in the range 2-6 msun,which is of course considerably more massive than estimates based on theoptically thin assumption. the luminosities are in the range 10-70 lsun,suggesting the formation of low-mass to intermediate mass stars, so that theexistence of such massive envelopes argues for extreme youth of the smms in theserpens cloud core.

astro-ph;0402395	on the excitation of the infrared knots along protostellar jets	the complete near infrared (0.9-2.5 micron) spectra in three different starforming regions (hh24-26, hh72 and bhr71) are presented and analyzed in theframework of shock excitation models. the spectra are dominated by h_2rovibrational emission (vibrational state nu up to 5, excitation energy t_ex upto 35000 k), while emission from ionized material, recognizable from [fe ii]and [s ii] lines, is significantly fainter. the analysis of the h_2 excitationdiagrams points to the existence of two different excitation regimes: whilstcondensations observed only in the infrared appear to have temperatures rarelyexceeding 3000 k and can be modelled in the framework of steady-state c-shockmodels, the infrared counterparts of herbig haro (hh) objects exhibit atemperature stratification with components up to more than 5000 k. the h_2emission from representative hh objects (hh26a, hh72a and hh320a) has beensuccessfully modelled by planar j-shocks with magnetic precursors, for whichthe main parameters (pre-shock density, speed) are derived. however, these samemodels are unable to reproduce the observed atomic and ionic emission, whichprobably arises from a distinct and perhaps more embedded region with respectto that traced by the h_2. some of the physical parameters of such regions(fractional ionization, density) have been estimated in hh72, on the basis ofthe observed ionic lines.

astro-ph;0408574	probing the embedded ysos of the r cra region through vlt-isaac  spectroscopy	near ir spectra obtained with isaac at vlt, have been used to poseconstraints on the evolutionary state and accretion properties of a sample offive embedded ysos located in the r cra core. this sample includes three classi sources (hh100 ir, irs2 and irs5), and two sources with nir excesses (irs6and irs3). absorption lines have been detected in the medium resolution spectraof all the observed targets, together with emission lines likely originating inthe disk-star-wind connected regions. we derived spectral types, veiling andstellar luminosity of the five observed sources, which in turn have been usedto infer their mass and age adopting pre-main sequence evolutionary tracks. wefind that in hh100 ir and irs2 most of the bolometric luminosity is due toaccretion, while the other three investigated sources, including the class iobject irs5a, present a low accretion activity (l_{acc}/l_{bol} &lt; 0.2). weobserve a general correlation between the accretion luminosity, the ir veilingand the emission line activity of the sources. a correlation between theaccretion activity and the spectral energy distribution slope is recognizablebut with the notable exception of irs5a. our analysis therefore shows how thedefinition of the evolutionary stage of deeply embedded ysos by means of ircolors needs to be more carefully refined.

astro-ph;0511427	ao assisted near-ir spectroscopy of svs 13 and its jet	we present long-slit h- and k-band spectroscopy of the low-mass outflowsource svs 13, obtained with the adaptive-optics assisted imager-spectrometernaco on the vlt. with a spatial resolution of &lt; 0.25 arcsec and a pixel scaleof 0.027 arcsec we precisely establish the relative offsets of h2, [feii], co,hi and nai components from the source continuum. the h2 and [feii] peaks areclearly associated with the jet, while the co, hi and nai peaks are spatiallyunresolved and coincident with the source, as is expected for emissionassociated with accretion processes. the h2 profile along the slit is resolvedinto multiple components, which increase in size though decrease in intensitywith distance from the source. this trend might be consistent with thermalexpansion of packets of gas ejected during periods of increased accretionactivity. indeed, for the brightest component nearest the source, proper motionmeasurements indicate a tangential velocity of 0.028 arcsec/year. it thereforeseems unlikely that this emission peak is associated with a stationary zone ofwarm gas at the base of the jet. however, the same can not be said for the[feii] peak, for which we see no evidence for motion downwind, even thoughradial velocity measurements indicate that the emission is associated withhigher jet velocities. we postulate that the [feii] could be associated with acollimation shock at the base of the jet.

astro-ph;0512098	h2 active jets in the near ir as a probe of protostellar evolution	we present a nir analysis of a sample of h2 outflows from young embeddedsources to compare the physical properties and cooling mechanisms of thedifferent flows. the sample comprises 23 outflows driven by class 0 and isources having low-intermediate luminosity. we have obtained narrow band imagesin h2 2.12um and feii 1.64um and spectroscopic observations in the range1-2.5um. h2 line ratios have been used to estimate the visual extinction andaverage temperature of the molecular gas. av values range from 2 to 15mag;average temperatures range between 2000 and 4000k. in several knots astratification of temperatures is found with maximum values up to 5000k. such astratification is more commonly observed in those knots which also show feiiemission, while a thermalized gas at a single temperature is generally found inknots emitting only in molecular lines. combining narrow band imaging with theparameters derived from the spectral analysis, we are able to measure the totalluminosity of the h2 and feii shocked regions in each flow. h2 is the major ircoolant with an average l(h2)/l(feii) ratio of 10^{-2}. 83% of the sources havea l(h2)/l(bol) ratio of 0.04, irrespective of the class of the driving source,while a smaller group of sources have l(h2)/l(bol) an order of magnitudesmaller.such a separation reveals the non-homogeneous behaviour of classi,where sources with very different outflow activity can be found. this isconsistent with other studies showing that among classi one can find objectswith different accretion properties and it demonstrates that the h2 power inthe jet can be a powerful tool to identify the most active sources of thisclass.

astro-ph;0603388	evidence for t tauri-like emission in the exor v1118 ori from near-ir  and x-ray data	we present a near-ir study of the exor variable v1118 ori, performed byfollowing a slightly declining phase after a recent outburst. in particular,the near-ir (0.8 - 2.3 micron) spectrum, obtained for the first time, shows alarge variety of emission features of the hi and hei recombination and coovertone. by comparing the observed spectrum with a wind model, a mass lossrate value is derived along with other parameters whose values are typical ofan accreting t tauri star. in addition, we have used x-ray data from the xmmarchive, taken in two different epochs during the declining phase monitored inir. x-ray emission (in the range 0.5 - 10 kev) permits to derive severalparameters which confirm the t tauri nature of the source. in the near-ir theobject maintains a low visual extinction during all the activity phases,confirming that variable extinction does not contribute to brightnessvariations. the lack of both a significant amount of circumstellar material andany evidence of ir cooling from collimated jet/outflow driven by the source,indicates that, at least this member of the exor class, is in a late stage ofthe pre-main sequence evolution. in the x-ray regime, an evident fading ispresent, detected in the post-outburst phase, that cannot be reconciled withthe presence of any absorbing material. this circumstance, combined with thepersistence (in the pre- and post-outburst phases) of a temperature componentat about 10 mk, suggests that accretion has some influence in regulating thecoronal activity.

astro-ph;0607375	molecular line emission in hh54: a coherent view from near to far  infrared	aims. we present a detailed study of the infrared line emission (1-200micron) in the herbig-haro object hh54. our database comprises: high- (r~9000)and low- (r~600) resolution spectroscopic data in the near-infrared band (1-2.5micron); mid-infrared spectrophotometric images (5-12 micron); and, far-ir(45-200 micron, r~200) spectra acquired with the iso satellite. as a result, weprovide the detection of and the absolute fluxes for more than 60 molecularfeatures (mainly from h2 in the near- and mid-infrared and from h2o, co and ohin the far-infrared) and 23 ionic lines. methods. the h2 lines, coming fromlevels from v=0 to v=4 have been interpreted in the context of a state-of-artshock code, whose output parameters are adopted as input to a large velocitygradient computation in order to interpret the fir emission of co, h2o and oh.results. the h2 emission can be interpreted as originating in eithersteady-state j-type shocks or in quasi-steady j-type shocks with magneticprecursor. however, our multi-species analysis shows that only a model of aj-type shock with magnetic precursor (v_shock=18 km/s, n_h=10^4 cm^-3, b=100microg, age=400 yr) can account for both the observed h2 emission and the coand h2o lines. such a model predicts a h2o abundance of ~ 7 10^-5, in agreementwith estimations from other shock models for outflows associated with low massprotostars. we can exclude the possibility that the observed atomic lines arisein the same shock as the molecular lines, and give arguments in favour of thepresence of a further high-velocity, fully dissociative shock component in theregion. finally, in view of the forthcoming spectroscopic facilities on boardof the herschel satellite, we provide predictions for h2o lines considered tobe the most suitable for diagnostic purposes.

astro-ph;0610037	warm sio gas in molecular bullets associated with protostellar outflows	in this paper we present the first sio multiline analysis (from j=2-1 toj=11-10) of the molecular bullets along the outflows of the class 0 sourcesl1448-mm and l1157-mm, obtained through observations with iram and jcmt. wehave computed the main physical parameters in each bullet and compared themwith other tracers of warm and dense gas and with models for the sio excitationin shocks. we find that the bullets close to l1448--mm, associated with highvelocity gas, have higher excitation conditions (n(h2) ~ 10^{6} cm^{-3}, t &gt;500 k) with respect to the l1157 bullets (n(h2) ~1-5 10^{5} cm^{-3}, t ~100-300 k). in both the sources, there is a clear evidence of the presence ofvelocity components having different excitation conditions, with the denserand/or warmer gas associated with the gas at the higher speed. in l1448 thebulk of the emission is due to the high-excitation and high velocity gas, whilein l1157 most of the emission comes from the low excitation gas at ambientvelocity. the observed velocity-averaged line ratios are well reproduced byshocks with speeds v_s larger than ~ 30 km/s and densities ~ 10^{5} - 10^{6}cm^{-3}. plane-parallel shock models, however, fail to predict all the observedline profiles and in particular the very similar profiles shown by both low andhigh excitation lines. the overall observations support the idea that the l1157clumps are shock interaction events older than the l1448 bullets close to thedriving source. in the latter objects, the velocity structure and thevariations of physical parameters with the velocity resemble very closely thosefound in optical/ir jets near the protostar, suggesting that similar launchingand excitation mechanisms are also at the origin of collimated jets seen atmillimetre wavelengths.

astro-ph;9909496	shock excited far-infrared molecular emission around t tau	the first complete far-infrared spectrum of t tau has been obtained with thelws spectrometer on-board the infrared space observatory, which detected strongemission from high-j (j=14-25) co, para- and ortho-h2o and oh transitions overthe wavelength range from 40 to 190 micron. most of the observed molecularemission can be explained by a single emission region at t~300-900 k andn(h_2)~10^(5-6) cm^(-3),with a diameter of about 2-3 arcsec. this correspondsto a very compact region of 300-400 au at the distance of 140 pc. an highertemperature component seems to be needed to explain the highest excitation coand water lines. we derive a water abundance of 1-7x10^(-5) and an oh abundanceof ~3x10^(-5) with respect to molecular hydrogen, implying water and ohenhancements by more than a factor of 10 with respect to the expected ambientgas abundance. the observed cooling in the various species amounts to 0.04l(sun),comparable to the mechanical luminosity of the outflow, indicating thatthe stellar winds could be responsible of the line excitation through shocks.in order to explain the observed molecular cooling in t tau in terms of c-typeshock models, we hypothesise that the strong far-ultraviolet radiation fieldphotodissociates water in favour of oh. this would explain the largeoverabundance of oh observed. the estimated relatively high density andcompactness of the observed emission suggest that it originates from the shockstaking place at the base of the molecular outflow emission, in the region wherethe action of the stellar winds from the two stars of the binary system isimportant.

0810.1651	atomic jets from class 0 sources detected by spitzer: the case of  l1448-c	we present spitzer-irs spectra obtained along the molecular jet from theclass 0 source l1448-c (or l1448-mm). atomic lines from the fundamentaltransitions of [feii], [siii] and [si] have been detected showing, for thefirst time, the presence of an embedded atomic jet at low excitation. purerotational h$_2$ lines are also detected, and a decrease of theatomic/molecular emission ratio is observed within 1 arcmin from the drivingsource. additional ground based spectra (ukirt/uist) were obtained to furtherconstrain the h$_2$ excitation along the jet axis and, combined with the 0--0lines, have been compared with bow-shock models. from the different lineratios, we find that the atomic gas is characterized by an electron density n_e~ 200-1000 cm^{-3}, a temperature t_e &lt; 2500 k and an ionization fraction &lt;~10^{-2}; the excitation conditions of the atomic jet are thus very differentfrom those found in more evolved class i and class ii jets. we also infer thatonly a fraction (0.05-0.2) of fe and si is in gaseous form, indicating thatdust still plays a major role in the depletion of refractory elements. acomparison with the sio abundance recently derived in the jet from an analysisof several sio sub-mm transitions, shows that the si/sio abundance ratio is~100, and thus that most of the silicon released from grains by sputtering andgrain-grain collisions remains in atomic form. finally, estimates of the atomicand molecular mass flux rates have been derived: values of the order of~10$^{-6}$ and ~10$^{-7}$ m$_{\sun}$ yr$^{-1}$ are inferred from the[si]25$\mu$m and h$_2$ line luminosities, respectively. a comparison with themomentum flux of the co molecular outflow suggests that the detected atomic jethas the power to drive the large scale outflow.

0811.1164	near infrared spectroscopic monitoring of exor variables: first results	we present low resolution (r approximately 250) spectroscopy in the near-ir(0.8 to 2.5um) of the exor variables. these are the initial results (obtainedduring the period 2007-2008) from a long term photometric and spectroscopicprogram aimed to study the variability in the accretion processes of pre-mainsequence (pms) stars, by correlating the continuum fluctuations with thespectroscopical properties. eight sources have been observed in differentepochs, for a total of 25 acquired spectra. exor spectra show a wide variety ofemission features dominated by hi recombination (paschen and brackett series).we have investigated whether line and continuum variability could be due to avariable extinction, but such hypothesis is applicable only to the peculiarsource pv cep. by comparing the observed spectra with a wind model, mass lossrates in the range (2-10)x10^(-8) m_sun} yr^(-1) are derived, along with otherwind parameters. consistent results are also obtained by assuming that hi linesare due to accretion. co overtone is also detected in the majority of thesources both in absorption and in emission. it appears to come from regionsmore compact than winds, likely the stellar photosphere (when in absorption)and the circumstellar disk (when in emission). nai and cai ir lines behave asthe co does, thus they are thought to arise in the same locations. for sometargets multiple spectra correspond to different activity stages of the source.those exhibiting the largest continuum variation at 2um (deltak &gt; 1 mag)present a significant line flux fading during the continuum declining phases.in particular, co absorption (emission) appears associated to inactive (active)stages, respectively.
