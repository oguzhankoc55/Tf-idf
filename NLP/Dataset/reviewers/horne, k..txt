0901.4705	discovery and characterization of wasp-6b, an inflated sub-jupiter mass  planet transiting a solar-type star	we report the discovery of wasp-6b, an inflated sub-jupiter mass planettransiting every 3.3610060 +0.0000022-0.0000035 days a mildly metal-poorsolar-type star of magnitude v=11.9. a combined analysis of the waspphotometry, high-precision followup transit photometry and radial velocitiesyield a planetary mass m_p = 0.503 +0.019-0.038 m_jup and radius r_p = 1.224+0.051-0.052 r_jup, resulting in a density rho_p = 0.27 +-0.05 rho_jup. themass and radius for the host star are m_s = 0.88 +0.05-0.08 m_sun and r_s =0.870 +0.025-0.036 r_sun. the non-zero orbital eccentricity e = 0.054+0.018-0.015 that we measure suggests that the planet underwent a massive tidalheating ~1 gyr ago that could have contributed to its inflated radius.high-precision radial velocities obtained during a transit allow us to measurea sky-projected angle between the stellar spin and orbital axis beta = 11+14-18 deg. in addition to similar published measurements, this result favors adominant migration mechanism based on tidal interactions with a protoplanetarydisk.

0904.0249	the extreme microlensing event ogle-2007-blg-224: terrestrial parallax  observation of a thick-disk brown dwarf	parallax is the most fundamental technique to measure distances toastronomical objects. although terrestrial parallax was pioneered over 2000years ago by hipparchus (ca. 140 bce) to measure the distance to the moon, thebaseline of the earth is so small that terrestrial parallax can generally onlybe applied to objects in the solar system. however, there exists a class ofextreme gravitational microlensing events in which the effects of terrestrialparallax can be readily detected and so permit the measurement of the distance,mass, and transverse velocity of the lens. here we report observations of thefirst such extreme microlensing event ogle-2007-blg-224, from which we inferthat the lens is a brown dwarf of mass m=0.056 +- 0.004 msun, with a distanceof 525 +- 40 pc and a transverse velocity of 113 +- 21 km/s. the velocityplaces the lens in the thick disk, making this the lowest-mass thick-disk browndwarf detected so far. follow-up observations may allow one to observe thelight from the brown dwarf itself, thus serving as an important constraint forevolutionary models of these objects and potentially opening a new window onsub-stellar objects. the low a priori probability of detecting a thick-diskbrown dwarf in this event, when combined with additional evidence from otherobservations, suggests that old substellar objects may be more common thanpreviously assumed.

0707.0417	efficient identification of exoplanetary transit candidates from  superwasp light curves	transiting extrasolar planets constitute only a small fraction of the rangeof stellar systems found to display periodic, shallow dimmings in wide-fieldsurveys employing small-aperture camera arrays. here we present an efficientselection strategy for follow-up observations, derived from analysis of thelight curves of a sample of 67 superwasp targets that passed the selectiontests we used in earlier papers, but which have subsequently been identifiedeither as planet hosts or as astrophysical false positives. we determine thesystem parameters using markov-chain monte carlo analysis of the superwasplight curves. we use a constrained optimisation of chi-squared combined with abayesian prior based on the main-sequence mass and radius expected from the2mass j-h colour. the bayesian nature of the analysis allows us to quantifyboth the departure of the host star from the main-sequence mass-radius relationand the probability that the companion radius is less than 1.5 jupiter radii.when augmented by direct light curve analyses that detect binaries with unequalprimary and secondary eclipses, and objects with aperture blends that areresolved by superwasp, we find that only 13 of the original 67 stars, includingthe three known planets in the sample, would qualify for follow-up. thissuggests that planet discovery "hit rates" better than one-in-five should beachievable. in addition, the stellar binaries that qualify are likely to haveastrophysically interesting stellar or sub-stellar secondaries.

0907.3471	mass measurement of a single unseen star and planetary detection  efficiency for ogle 2007-blg-050	we analyze ogle-2007-blg-050, a high magnification microlensing event (a ~432) whose peak occurred on 2 may, 2007, with pronounced finite-source andparallax effects. we compute planet detection efficiencies for this event inorder to determine its sensitivity to the presence of planets around the lensstar. both finite-source and parallax effects permit a measurement of theangular einstein radius \theta_e = 0.48 +/- 0.01 mas and the parallax \pi_e =0.12 +/- 0.03, leading to an estimate of the lens mass m = 0.50 +/- 0.14 m_sunand its distance to the observer d_l = 5.5 +/- 0.4 kpc. this is only the seconddetermination of a reasonably precise (&lt;30%) mass estimate for an isolatedunseen object, using any method. this allows us to calculate the planetarydetection efficiency in physical units (r_\perp, m_p), where r_\perp is theprojected planet-star separation and m_p is the planet mass. when computingplanet detection efficiency, we did not find any planetary signature and ourdetection efficiency results reveal significant sensitivity to neptune-massplanets, and to a lesser extent earth-mass planets in some configurations.indeed, jupiter and neptune-mass planets are excluded with a high confidencefor a large projected separation range between the planet and the lens star,respectively [0.6 - 10] and [1.4 - 4] au, and earth-mass planets are excludedwith a 10% confidence in the lensing zone, i.e. [1.8 - 3.1] au.

0908.1553	wasp-17b: an ultra-low density planet in a probable retrograde orbit	we report the discovery of the transiting giant planet wasp-17b, theleast-dense planet currently known. it is 1.6 saturn masses but 1.5-2 jupiterradii, giving a density of 6-14 per cent that of jupiter. wasp-17b is in a3.7-day orbit around a sub-solar metallicity, v = 11.6, f6 star. preliminarydetection of the rossiter-mclaughlin effect suggests that wasp-17b is in aretrograde orbit (lambda ~ -150 deg), indicative of a violent history involvingplanet-planet or star-planet scattering.  wasp-17b's bloated radius could be due to tidal heating resulting from recentor ongoing tidal circularisation of an eccentric orbit, such as the highlyeccentric orbits that typically result from scattering interactions. it willthus be important to determine more precisely the current orbital eccentricityby further high-precision radial velocity measurements or by timing thesecondary eclipse, both to reduce the uncertainty on the planet's radius and totest tidal-heating models. owing to its low surface gravity, wasp-17b'satmosphere has the largest scale height of any known planet, making it a goodtarget for transmission spectroscopy.

0911.5581	interpretation of strong short-term central perturbations in the light  curves of moderate-magnification microlensing events	to improve the planet detection efficiency, current planetary microlensingexperiments are focused on high-magnification events searching for planetarysignals near the peak of lensing light curves. however, it is known thatcentral perturbations can also be produced by binary companions and thus it isimportant to distinguish planetary signals from those induced by binarycompanions. in this paper, we analyze the light curves of microlensing eventsogle-2007-blg-137/moa-2007-blg-091, ogle-2007-blg-355/moa-2007-blg-278, andmoa-2007-blg-199/ogle-2007-blg-419, for all of which exhibit short-termperturbations near the peaks of the light curves. from detailed modeling of thelight curves, we find that the perturbations of the events are caused by binarycompanions rather than planets. from close examination of the light curvescombined with the underlying physical geometry of the lens system obtained frommodeling, we find that the short time-scale caustic-crossing feature occurringat a low or a moderate base magnification with an additional secondaryperturbation is a typical feature of binary-lens events and thus can be usedfor the discrimination between the binary and planetary interpretations.

1005.0966	ogle 2008--blg--290: an accurate measurement of the limb darkening of a  galactic bulge k giant spatially resolved by microlensing	gravitational microlensing is not only a successful tool for discoveringdistant exoplanets, but it also enables characterization of the lens and sourcestars involved in the lensing event. in high magnification events, the lenscaustic may cross over the source disk, which allows a determination of theangular size of the source and additionally a measurement of its limbdarkening. when such extended-source effects appear close to maximummagnification, the resulting light curve differs from the characteristicpaczynski point-source curve. the exact shape of the light curve close to thepeak depends on the limb darkening of the source. dense photometric coveragepermits measurement of the respective limb-darkening coefficients. in the caseof microlensing event ogle 2008-blg-290, the k giant source star reached a peakmagnification of about 100. thirteen different telescopes have covered thisevent in eight different photometric bands. subsequent light-curve analysisyielded measurements of linear limb-darkening coefficients of the source in sixphotometric bands. the best-measured coefficients lead to an estimate of thesource effective temperature of about 4700 +100-200 k. however, the photometricestimate from colour-magnitude diagrams favours a cooler temperature of 4200+-100 k. as the limb-darkening measurements, at least in the ctio/smarts2 v andi bands, are among the most accurate obtained, the above disagreement needs tobe understood. a solution is proposed, which may apply to previous events wheresuch a discrepancy also appeared.

1202.0903	one or more bound planets per milky way star from microlensing  observations	most known extrasolar planets (exoplanets) have been discovered using theradial velocity$^{\bf 1,2}$ or transit$^{\bf 3}$ methods. both are biasedtowards planets that are relatively close to their parent stars, and studiesfind that around 17--30% (refs 4, 5) of solar-like stars host a planet.gravitational microlensing$^{\bf 6\rm{\bf -}\bf 9}$, on the other hand, probesplanets that are further away from their stars. recently, a population ofplanets that are unbound or very far from their stars was discovered bymicrolensing$^{\bf 10}$. these planets are at least as numerous as the stars inthe milky way$^{\bf 10}$. here we report a statistical analysis of microlensingdata (gathered in 2002--07) that reveals the fraction of bound planets 0.5--10au (sun--earth distance) from their stars. we find that 17$_{\bf -9}^{\bf +6}$%of stars host jupiter-mass planets (0.3--10 $\mj$, where $\mj {\bf = 318}$$\mearth$ and $\mearth$ is earth's mass). cool neptunes (10--30 $\mearth$) andsuper-earths (5--10 $\mearth$) are even more common: their respectiveabundances per star are 52$_{\bf -29}^{\bf +22}$% and 62$_{\bf -37}^{\bf+35}$%. we conclude that stars are orbited by planets as a rule, rather thanthe exception.

1202.6199	factors affecting the radii of close-in transiting exoplanets	the radius of an exoplanet may be affected by various factors, includingirradiation, planet mass and heavy element content. a significant number oftransiting exoplanets have now been discovered for which the mass, radius,semi-major axis, host star metallicity and stellar effective temperature areknown. we use multivariate regression models to determine the dependence ofplanetary radius on planetary equilibrium temperature t_eq, planetary mass m_p,stellar metallicity [fe/h], orbital semi-major axis a, and tidal heating rateh_tidal, for 119 transiting planets in three distinct mass regimes. wedetermine that heating leads to larger planet radii, as expected, increasingmass leads to increased or decreased radii of low-mass (&lt;0.5r_j) and high-mass(&gt;2.0r_j) planets, respectively (with no mass effect on jupiter-mass planets),and increased host-star metallicity leads to smaller planetary radii,indicating a relationship between host-star metallicity and planet heavyelement content. for saturn-mass planets, a good fit to the radii may beobtained from log(r_p/r_j)=-0.077+0.450 log(m_p/m_j)-0.314[fe/h]+0.671log(a/au)+0.398 log(t_eq/k). the radii of jupiter-mass planets may be fit bylog(r_p/r_j)=-2.217+0.856 log(t_eq/k)+0.291 log(a/au). high-mass planets' radiiare best fit by log(r_p/r_j)=-1.067+0.380 log(t_eq/k)-0.093log(m_p/m_j)-0.057[fe/h]+0.019 log(h_tidal/1x10^{20}). these equations producea very good fit to the observed radii, with a mean absolute difference betweenfitted and observed radius of 0.11r_j. a clear distinction is seen between thecore-dominated saturn-mass (0.1-0.5m_j) planets, whose radii are determinedalmost exclusively by their mass and heavy element content, and the gaseousenvelope-dominated jupiter-mass (0.5-2.0m_j) planets, whose radii increasestrongly with irradiating flux, partially offset by a power-law dependence onorbital separation.

1203.1291	ogle-2008-blg-510: first automated real-time detection of a weak  microlensing anomaly - brown dwarf or stellar binary?	the microlensing event ogle-2008-blg-510 is characterised by an evidentasymmetric shape of the peak, promptly detected by the artemis system in realtime. the skewness of the light curve appears to be compatible both withbinary-lens and binary-source models, including the possibility that the lenssystem consists of an m dwarf orbited by a brown dwarf. the detection of thismicrolensing anomaly and our analysis demonstrates that: 1) automated real-timedetection of weak microlensing anomalies with immediate feedback is feasible,efficient, and sensitive, 2) rather common weak features intrinsically comewith ambiguities that are not easily resolved from photometric light curves, 3)a modelling approach that finds all features of parameter space rather thanjust the `favourite model' is required, and 4) the data quality is mostcrucial, where systematics can be confused with real features, in particularsmall higher-order effects such as orbital motion signatures. it moreoverbecomes apparent that events with weak signatures are a silver mine forstatistical studies, although not easy to exploit. clues about the apparentpaucity of both brown-dwarf companions and binary-source microlensing eventsmight hide here.

1204.2869	characterizing low-mass binaries from observation of long time-scale  caustic-crossing gravitational microlensing events	despite astrophysical importance of binary star systems, detections arelimited to those located in small ranges of separations, distances, and massesand thus it is necessary to use a variety of observational techniques for acomplete view of stellar multiplicity across a broad range of physicalparameters. in this paper, we report the detections and measurements of 2binaries discovered from observations of microlensing events moa-2011-blg-090and ogle-2011-blg-0417. determinations of the binary masses are possible bysimultaneously measuring the einstein radius and the lens parallax. themeasured masses of the binary components are 0.43 $m_{\odot}$ and 0.39$m_{\odot}$ for moa-2011-blg-090 and 0.57 $m_{\odot}$ and 0.17 $m_{\odot}$ forogle-2011-blg-0417 and thus both lens components of moa-2011-blg-090 and onecomponent of ogle-2011-blg-0417 are m dwarfs, demonstrating the usefulness ofmicrolensing in detecting binaries composed of low-mass components. frommodeling of the light curves considering full keplerian motion of the lens, wealso measure the orbital parameters of the binaries. the blended light ofogle-2011-blg-0417 comes very likely from the lens itself, making it possibleto check the microlensing orbital solution by follow-up radial-velocityobservation. for both events, the caustic-crossing parts of the light curves,which are critical for determining the physical lens parameters, were resolvedby high-cadence survey observations and thus it is expected that the number ofmicrolensing binaries with measured physical parameters will increase in thefuture.

1204.4789	a new type of ambiguity in the planet and binary interpretations of  central perturbations of high-magnification gravitational microlensing events	high-magnification microlensing events provide an important channel to detectplanets. perturbations near the peak of a high-magnification event can beproduced either by a planet or a binary companion. it is known that centralperturbations induced by both types of companions can be generallydistinguished due to the basically different magnification pattern aroundcaustics. in this paper, we present a case of central perturbations for whichit is difficult to distinguish the planetary and binary interpretations. thepeak of a lensing light curve affected by this perturbation appears to be bluntand flat. for a planetary case, this perturbation occurs when the sourcetrajectory passes the negative perturbation region behind the back end of anarrowhead-shaped central caustic. for a binary case, a similar perturbationoccurs for a source trajectory passing through the negative perturbation regionbetween two cusps of an astroid-shaped caustic. we demonstrate the degeneracyfor 2 high-magnification events of ogle-2011-blg-0526 andogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336. for ogle-2011-blg-0526, the $\chi^2$difference between the planetary and binary model is $\sim$ 3, implying thatthe degeneracy is very severe. for ogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336, thestellar binary model is formally excluded with $\delta \chi^2 \sim$ 105 and theplanetary model is preferred. however, it is difficult to claim a planetdiscovery because systematic residuals of data from the planetary model arelarger than the difference between the planetary and binary models. consideringthat 2 events observed during a single season suffer from such a degeneracy, itis expected that central perturbations experiencing this type of degeneracy iscommon.

1205.6323	moa-2010-blg-477lb: constraining the mass of a microlensing planet from  microlensing parallax, orbital motion and detection of blended light	microlensing detections of cool planets are important for the construction ofan unbiased sample to estimate the frequency of planets beyond the snow line,which is where giant planets are thought to form according to the coreaccretion theory of planet formation. in this paper, we report the discovery ofa giant planet detected from the analysis of the light curve of ahigh-magnification microlensing event moa-2010-blg-477. the measuredplanet-star mass ratio is $q=(2.181\pm0.004)\times 10^{-3}$ and the projectedseparation is $s=1.1228\pm0.0006$ in units of the einstein radius. the angulareinstein radius is unusually large $\theta_{\rm e}=1.38\pm 0.11$ mas. combiningthis measurement with constraints on the "microlens parallax" and the lensflux, we can only limit the host mass to the range $0.13&lt;m/m_\odot&lt;1.0$. inthis particular case, the strong degeneracy between microlensing parallax andplanet orbital motion prevents us from measuring more accurate host and planetmasses. however, we find that adding bayesian priors from two effects (galacticmodel and keplerian orbit) each independently favors the upper end of this massrange, yielding star and planet masses of $m_*=0.67^{+0.33}_{-0.13}\ m_\odot$and $m_p=1.5^{+0.8}_{-0.3}\ m_{\rm jup}$ at a distance of $d=2.3\pm0.6$ kpc,and with a semi-major axis of $a=2^{+3}_{-1}$ au. finally, we show that thelens mass can be determined from future high-resolution near-ir adaptive opticsobservations independently from two effects, photometric and astrometric.

1403.3092	candidate gravitational microlensing events for future direct lens  imaging	the mass of the lenses giving rise to galactic microlensing events can beconstrained by measuring the relative lens-source proper motion and lens flux.the flux of the lens can be separated from that of the source, companions tothe source, and unrelated nearby stars with high-resolution images taken whenthe lens and source are spatially resolved. for typical ground-based adaptiveoptics (ao) or space-based observations, this requires either inordinately longtime baselines or high relative proper motions. we provide a list ofmicrolensing events toward the galactic bulge with high relative lens-sourceproper motion that are therefore good candidates for constraining the lens masswith future high-resolution imaging. we investigate all events from 2004 --2013 that display detectable finite-source effects, a feature that allows us tomeasure the proper motion. in total, we present 20 events with mu &gt;~ 8 mas/yr.of these, 14 were culled from previous analyses while 6 are new, includingogle-2004-blg-368, moa-2005-blg-36, ogle-2012-blg-0211, ogle-2012-blg-0456,moa-2012-blg-532, and moa-2013-blg-029. in &lt;~12 years the lens and source ofeach event will be sufficiently separated for ground-based telescopes with aosystems or space telescopes to resolve each component and further characterizethe lens system. furthermore, for the most recent events, comparison of thelens flux estimates from images taken immediately to those estimated fromimages taken when the lens and source are resolved can be used to empiricallycheck the robustness of the single-epoch method currently being used toestimate lens masses for many events.

1502.06663	reanalyses of anomalous gravitational microlensing events in the  ogle-iii early warning system database with combined data	we reanalyze microlensing events in the published list of anomalous eventsthat were observed from the ogle lensing survey conducted during 2004-2008period. in order to check the existence of possible degenerate solutions andextract extra information, we conduct analyses based on combined data fromother survey and follow-up observation and consider higher-order effects. amongthe analyzed events, we present analyses of 8 events for which either newsolutions are identified or additional information is obtained. we find thatthe previous binary-source interpretations of 5 events are better interpretedby binary-lens models. these events include ogle-2006-blg-238,ogle-2007-blg-159, ogle-2007-blg-491, ogle-2008-blg-143, and ogle-2008-blg-210.with additional data covering caustic crossings, we detect finite-sourceeffects for 6 events including ogle-2006-blg-215, ogle-2006-blg-238,ogle-2006-blg-450, ogle-2008-blg-143, ogle-2008-blg-210, and ogle-2008-blg-513.among them, we are able to measure the einstein radii of 3 events for whichmulti-band data are available. these events are ogle-2006-blg-238,ogle-2008-blg-210, and ogle-2008-blg-513. for ogle-2008-blg-143, we detecthigher-order effect induced by the changes of the observer's position caused bythe orbital motion of the earth around the sun. in addition, we presentdegenerate solutions resulting from the known close/wide or eclipticdegeneracy. finally, we note that the masses of the binary companions of thelenses of ogle-2006-blg-450 and ogle-2008-blg-210 are in the brown-dwarfregime.

1502.07345	a census of variability in globular cluster m68 (ngc 4590)	we analyse 20 nights of ccd observations in the v and i bands of the globularcluster m68 (ngc 4590), using these to detect variable objects. we alsoobtained electron-multiplying ccd (emccd) observations for this cluster inorder to explore its core with unprecedented spatial resolution from theground.  we reduced our data using difference image analysis, in order to achieve thebest possible photometry in the crowded field of the cluster. in doing so, weshowed that when dealing with identical networked telescopes, a reference imagefrom any telescope may be used to reduce data from any other telescope, whichfacilitates the analysis significantly. we then used our light curves toestimate the properties of the rr lyrae (rrl) stars in m68 through fourierdecomposition and empirical relations. the variable star properties thenallowed us to derive the cluster's metallicity and distance.  we determine new periods for the variable stars, and search for newvariables, especially in the core of the cluster where our method performsparticularly well. we detect an additional 4 sx phe stars, and confirm thevariability of another star, bringing the total number of confirmed variablestars in this cluster to 50. we also used archival data stretching back to 1951in order to derive period changes for some of the single-mode rrl stars, andanalyse the significant number of double-mode rrl stars in m68. furthermore, wefind evidence for double-mode pulsation in one of the sx phe stars in thiscluster. using the different types of variables, we derived an estimate of themetallicity, [fe/h]=$-2.07 \pm 0.06$ on the zw scale, and 4 independentestimates of the distance modulus ($\mu_0 \sim$ 15.00 mag) for this cluster.thanks to the first use of difference image analysis on time-seriesobservations of m68, we are now confident that we have a complete census of therrl stars in this cluster.

0808.0004	inferring statistics of planet populations by means of automated  microlensing searches	(abridged) the study of other worlds is key to understanding our own, and notonly provides clues to the origin of our civilization, but also looks into itsfuture. rather than in identifying nearby systems and learning about theirindividual properties, the main value of the technique of gravitationalmicrolensing is in obtaining the statistics of planetary populations within themilky way and beyond. only the complementarity of different techniquescurrently employed promises to yield a complete picture of planet formationthat has sufficient predictive power to let us understand how habitable worldslike ours evolve, and how abundant such systems are in the universe. acooperative three-step strategy of survey, follow-up, and anomaly monitoring ofmicrolensing targets, realized by means of an automated expert system and anetwork of ground-based telescopes is ready right now to be used to obtain afirst census of cool planets with masses reaching even below that of earthorbiting k and m dwarfs in two distinct stellar populations, namely thegalactic bulge and disk. the hunt for extra-solar planets acts as a principalscience driver for time-domain astronomy with robotic-telescope networksadopting fully-automated strategies. several initiatives, both into facilitiesas well as into advanced software and strategies, are supposed to see thecapabilities of gravitational microlensing programmes step-wise increasing overthe next 10 years. new opportunities will show up with high-precisionastrometry becoming available and studying the abundance of planets aroundstars in neighbouring galaxies becoming possible. finally, we should not missout on sharing the vision with the general public, and make its realization toprofit not only the scientists but all the wider society.

astro-ph;0011489	emission line oscillations in the dwarf nova v2051 ophiuchi	we have detected coherent oscillations, at multiple frequencies, in the lineand continuum emission of the eclipsing dwarf nova v2051 ophiuchi using the 10mkeck ii telescope. our own novel data acquisition system allowed us to obtainvery fast spectroscopy using a continuous readout of the ccd on the lrisspectrograph. this is the first time that dwarf nova oscillations are detectedand resolved in the emission lines. the accretion disc is highly asymmetricwith a stronger contribution from the blue-shifted side of the disc during ourobservations. the disc extends from close to the white dwarf out to the outerregions of the primary roche lobe.  continuum oscillations at 56.12s and its first harmonic at 28.06 s are mostlikely to originate on the surface of a spinning white dwarf with thefundamental period corresponding to the spin period. balmer and helium emissionlines oscillate with a period of 29.77s at a mean amplitude of 1.9%. the linekinematics as well as the eclipse constraints indicate an origin in theaccretion disc at a radius of 12 r_wd. the amplitude of the emission lineoscillation modulates (0-4%) at a period of 488s, corresponding to the keplerperiod at r=12 r_wd. this modulation is due to the beating between the whitedwarf spin and the orbital motion in the disc.  the observed emission line oscillations cannot be explained by a truncateddisc as in the intermediate polars. the observations suggest a non-axisymmetricbulge in the disc, orbiting at 12r_wd, is required. the close correspondencebetween the location of the oscillations and the circularisation radius of thesystem suggests that stream overflow effects may be of relevance

astro-ph;0204018	echoes in x-ray binaries	we present a method of analysing the correlated x-ray and optical/uvvariability in x-ray binaries, using the observed time delays between the x-raydriving lightcurves and their reprocessed optical echoes. this allows us todetermine the distribution of reprocessing sites within the binary. we modelthe time-delay transfer functions by simulating the distribution ofreprocessing regions, using geometrical and binary parameters. we constructbest-fit time-delay transfer functions, showing the regions in the binaryresponsible for the reprocessing of x-rays. we have applied this model toobservations of the soft x-ray transient, gro j1655-40. we find the opticalvariability lags the x-ray variability with a mean time delay of 19.3$pm{2.2}$seconds. this means that the outer regions of the accretion disc are thedominant reprocessing site in this system. on fitting the data to a simplegeometric model, we derive a best-fit disk half-opening angle of13.5$^{+2.1}_{-2.8}$ degrees, which is similar to that observed after theprevious outburst by cite{orosz97}. this disk thickening has the effect ofalmost entirely shielding the companion star from irradiation at this stage ofthe outburst.

astro-ph;0208322	a dynamical study of the circumstellar gas in ux orionis	we present the results of a high spectral resolution study of thecircumstellar (cs) gas around the intermediate mass, pre-main sequence star uxori. the results are based on a set of 10 echelle spectra, monitoring the staron time scales of months, days and hours. a large number of transientblueshifted and redshifted absorption features are detected in the balmer andin many metallic lines. a multigaussian fit is applied to determine for eachtransient absorption the velocity, v, dispersion velocity, delta v, and theparameter r, which provides a measure of the absorption strength of the cs gas.the time evolution of those parameters is presented and discussed. a comparisonof intensity ratios among the transient absorptions suggests a solar-likecomposition of the cs gas. this confirms previous results and excludes a verymetal-rich environment as the cause of the transient features in ux ori. thefeatures can be grouped by their similar velocities into 24 groups, of which 17are redshifted and 7 blueshifted. an analysis of the velocity of the groupsallows us to identify them as signatures of the dynamical evolution of 7 clumpsof gas, of which 4 represent accretion events and 3 outflow events. most of theevents decelerate at a rate of tenths of ms-2, while 2 events accelerate atapproximately the same rate; one event is seen experiencing both anacceleration and a deceleration phase and lasts for a period of few days. thistime scale seems to be the typical duration of outflowing and infalling eventsin ux ori. the dispersion velocity and the relative aborption strength of thefeatures do not show drastic changes during the lifetime of the events, whichsuggests they are gaseous blobs preserving their geometrical and physicalidentity.

astro-ph;0404394	ogle-2003-blg-238: microlensing mass estimate of an isolated star	microlensing is the only known direct method to measure the masses of starsthat lack visible companions. in terms of microlensing observables, the mass isgiven by m=(c^2/4g)\tilde r_e \theta_e and so requires the measurement of boththe angular einstein radius, \theta_e, and the projected einstein radius,\tilde r_e. simultaneous measurement of these two parameters is extremely rare.here we analyze ogle-2003-blg-238, a spectacularly bright (i_min=10.3),high-magnification (a_max = 170) microlensing event. pronounced finite sourceeffects permit a measurement of \theta_e = 650 uas. although the timescale ofthe event is only t_e = 38 days, one can still obtain weak constraints on themicrolens parallax: 4.4 au &lt; \tilde r_e &lt; 18 au at the 1 \sigma level. togetherthese two parameter measurements yield a range for the lens mass of 0.36 m_sun&lt; m &lt; 1.48 m_sun. as was the case for macho-lmc-5, the only other single star(apart from the sun) whose mass has been determined from its gravitationaleffects, this estimate is rather crude. it does, however, demonstrate theviability of the technique. we also discuss future prospects for single-lensmass measurements.

astro-ph;0502072	hst/fos time-resolved spectral mapping of ip pegasi at the end of an  outburst	we report an eclipse mapping analysis of time-resolved ultravioletspectroscopy covering three eclipses of the dwarf nova ip pegasi on the latedecline of the 1993 may outburst. the eclipse maps of the first run showevidence of one spiral arm, suggesting that spiral structures may still bepresent in the accretion disc 9 days after the onset of the outburst. in thespatially resolved spectra the most prominent lines appear in emission at anyradius, being stronger in the inner disc regions. the spectrum of the gasstream is clearly distinct from the disc spectrum in the intermediate and outerdisc regions, suggesting the occurrence of gas stream overflow. the full widthhalf maximum of c iv is approximately constant with radius, in contrast to theexpected $v\propto{r^{-1/2}}$ law for a gas in keplerian orbits. this lineprobably originates in a vertically extended region (chromosphere + disc wind).the uneclipsed component contributes $\sim{4}$ % of the flux in c iv in thefirst run, and becomes negligible in the remaining runs. we fit stellaratmosphere models to the spatially resolved spectra. the radial run of the disccolor temperature for the three runs is flatter than the expected$t\propto{r^{-3/4}}$ law for steady-state optically thick discs models, with$t\simeq{20000}$ k in the inner regions and $t\simeq{9000}$ k in the outer discregions. the solid angles that result from the fits are smaller than expectedfrom the parameters of the system. the radial run of the solid angle suggeststhat the disc is flared in outburst, and decreases in thickness toward the endof the outburst.

astro-ph;0601563	discovery of a cool planet of 5.5 earth masses through gravitational  microlensing	in the favoured core-accretion model of formation of planetary systems, solidplanetesimals accumulate to build up planetary cores, which then accretenebular gas if they are sufficiently massive. around m-dwarf stars (the mostcommon stars in our galaxy), this model favours the formation of earth-mass toneptune-mass planets with orbital radii of 1 to 10 astronomical units (au),which is consistent with the small number of gas giant planets known to orbitm-dwarf host stars. more than 170 extrasolar planets have been discovered witha wide range of masses and orbital periods, but planets of neptune's mass orless have not hitherto been detected at separations of more than 0.15 au fromnormal stars. here we report the discovery of a 5.5 (+5.5/-2.7) m_earthplanetary companion at a separation of 2.6 (+1.5/-0.6) au from a 0.22(+0.21/-0.11) m_solar m-dwarf star. (we propose to name it ogle-2005-blg-390lb,indicating a planetary mass companion to the lens star of the microlensingevent.) the mass is lower than that of gj876d, although the error bars overlap.our detection suggests that such cool, sub-neptune-mass planets may be morecommon than gas giant planets, as predicted by the core accretion theory.

astro-ph;0605143	multiwavelength observations of exo 0748-676 - i. reprocessing of x-ray  bursts	we present the first high time-resolution simultaneous x-ray, ultraviolet,and optical observations of x-ray bursts in uy vol, the optical counterpart ofthe low mass x-ray binary exo 0748-676, obtained with rxte, hst, and gemini-s.strong reprocessed signals are present in the ultraviolet (a factor of 4) andoptical (a factor of 2.5). these signals are lagged with respect to the x-raysand appear significantly smeared as well. the addition of far-ultravioletcoverage for one burst, together with the high quality of the dataset, allowmuch tighter constraints upon the temperature and geometry of the reprocessingregion than previously possible. a single-zone black body reprocessing modelfor this burst suggests a rise in temperatures during the burst from 18,000 to35,000k and an emitting area comparable to that expected for the disk and/orirradiated companion star. the lags, a mean of 4.0s and range of 2.5s, areconsistent with those expected within the binary. the single-zone black bodymodel cannot reproduce the ratio of optical to ultraviolet flux during theburst, however. the discrepancy, corresponding to underpredicting the opticalby more than a factor of two, seems too large to explain with deviations from alocal black body spectrum and more likely indicates that a range ofreprocessing temperatures are required, as would be expected, with coolerregions not contributing to the uv. comparable results are derived from otherbursts, and in particular the lag and smearing both appear shorter when thecompanion star is on the near side of the disk as predicted. the burst observedby hst also yielded a spectrum of the reprocessed light.

astro-ph;0609418	a fast hybrid algorithm for exoplanetary transit searches	we present a fast and efficient hybrid algorithm for selecting exoplanetarycandidates from wide-field transit surveys. our method is based on thewidely-used sysrem and box least-squares (bls) algorithms. patterns ofsystematic error that are common to all stars on the frame are mapped andeliminated using the sysrem algorithm. the remaining systematic errors causedby spatially localised flat-fielding and other errors are quantified using aboxcar-smoothing method. we show that the dimensions of the search-parameterspace can be reduced greatly by carrying out an initial bls search on a coarsegrid of reduced dimensions, followed by newton-raphson refinement of thetransit parameters in the vicinity of the most significant solutions. weillustrate the method's operation by applying it to data from one field of thesuperwasp survey, comprising 2300 observations of 7840 stars brighter thanv=13.0. we identify 11 likely transit candidates. we reject stars that exhibitsignificant ellipsoidal variations indicative of a stellar-mass companion. weuse colours and proper motions from the 2mass and usno-b1.0 surveys to estimatethe stellar parameters and the companion radius. we find that two stars showingunambiguous transit signals pass all these tests, and so qualify for detailedhigh-resolution spectroscopic follow-up.

astro-ph;0609618	the impact of correlated noise on superwasp detection rates for  transiting extra-solar planets	we present a model of the stellar populations in the fields observed by oneof the superwasp-n cameras in the 2004 observing season. we use the besancongalactic model to define the range of stellar types and metallicities present,and populate these objects with transiting extra-solar planets using themetallicity relation of fischer &amp; valenti (2005).  we investigate the ability of superwasp to detect these planets in thepresence of realistic levels of correlated systematic noise (`red noise'). wefind that the number of planets that transit with a signal-to-noise ratio of 10or more increases linearly with the number of nights of observations. based ona simulation of detection rates across 20 fields observed by one camera, wepredict that a total of 18.6 \pm 8.0 planets should be detectable from thesuperwasp-n 2004 data alone. the best way to limit the impact of co-variantnoise and increase the number of detectable planets is to boost thesignal-to-noise ratio, by increasing the number of observed transits for eachcandidate transiting planet. this requires the observing baseline to beincreased, by spending a second observing season monitoring the same fields.

astro-ph;9801207	recovery of 29-s oscillations in hst/fos eclipse observations of the  cataclysmic variable ux ursae majoris	[abridged abstract]  low amplitude (~=0.5%) 29-s oscillations have been detected in hst/foseclipse observations of the nova-like cataclysmic variable ux uma. these arethe same dwarf nova-type oscillations that were originally discovered in thissystem by warner &amp; nather in 1972. the oscillations are sinusoidal to withinthe small observational errors and undergo an approximately -360 degree phaseshift during eclipses. their amplitudes are highest at pre-eclipse orbitalphases and exhibit a rather gradual eclipse whose shape is roughly similar toux~uma's overall light curve. oscillation spectra derived from pre-eclipse datasegments are extremely blue, whereas mid-eclipse oscillation spectra are muchredder.  we suggest that the ultimate source of the oscillations is a hot, compactregion near disk center, but that a significant fraction of the observed,modulated flux is due to reprocessing of the light emitted by this source inthe accretion disk atmosphere. the compact source is occulted at orbital phasesnear mid-eclipse, leaving only part of the more extended reprocessing region(s)to produce the weak oscillations that persist even at conjunction.  the highly sinusoidal oscillation pulse shape does not permit theidentification of the compact component in this model with emission produced bya rotating disturbance in the inner disk or in an equatorial boundary layer,and a standard intermediate polar model can also be ruled out. a model invokingmagnetically controlled accretion onto differentially rotating wd surfacelayers may be viable, but needs more theoretical work.

astro-ph;9803145	the 1996 outburst of gro j1655-40: the challenge of interpreting the  multi-wavelength spectra	we report on the results of a campaign to observe the sxt gro j1655-40 inoutburst using hst, xte and gro and aat. this outburst was qualitatively quitedifferent to other sxt outbursts and to previous outbursts of this source. theonset of hard x-ray activity occurred very slowly, over several months and wasdelayed relative to the soft x-ray rise. during this period, the optical fluxesdeclined steadily. this apparent anti-correlation is not consistent with thestandard disc instability model of sxt outbursts, nor is it expected if theoptical output is dominated by reprocessing. using our derived reddening wefind that our dereddened spectra are dominated by a component peaking in theoptical with the expected nu^1/3 disc spectrum seen only in the uv. we considerpossible interpretations of this spectrum in terms of thermal emission from theouter accretion disc and/or secondary star, both with and without x-rayirradiation, and also as non-thermal optical synchrotron emission from acompact self-absorbed central source. the x-ray spectra broadly resemble thehigh-soft state commonly seen in black hole candidates, but evolve through twosubstates. the outburst dataset cannot readily be interpreted by any standardmodel for sxt outbursts. many of the characteristics could be interpreted witha model combining x-ray irradiation with the disc instability, but with theadded ingredient of a very large disc in this long period system.
