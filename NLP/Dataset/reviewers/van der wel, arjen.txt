0903.4857	on the size and comoving mass density evolution of early-type galaxies	we present a simple, empirically motivated model that simultaneously predictsthe evolution of the mean size and the comoving mass density of massiveearly-type galaxies from z=2 to the present. first we demonstrate that somesize evolution of the population can be expected simply due to the continuousemergence of early-type galaxies. sdss data reveal that in the present-dayuniverse more compact early-type galaxies with a given dynamical mass haveolder stellar populations. in contrast, at a given stellar velocity dispersion,sdss data show that there is no relation between size and age, which impliesthat the velocity dispersion can be used to estimate the epoch at whichgalaxies stopped forming stars, turning into early-type galaxies. applying sucha 'formation' criterion to a large sample of nearby early-type galaxies, wepredict the redshift evolution in the size distribution and the comoving massdensity. the resulting evolution in the mean size is roughly half of theobserved evolution. then we include a prescription for the merger histories ofgalaxies between the 'formation' redshift and the present, based oncosmological simulations of the assembly of dark matter halos. such mergersafter the transformation into an early-type galaxy are presumablydissipationless ('dry'), where the increase in size is expected to beapproximately proportional to the increase in mass. this model successfullyreproduces the observed evolution since z~2 in the mean size and in thecomoving mass density of massive early-type galaxies. we conclude that therecently measured, substantial size evolution of early-type galaxies can beexplained by the combined effect of the continuous emergence of galaxies asearly types and their subsequent growth through dry merging.

0907.4766	on the dearth of compact, massive, red sequence galaxies in the local  universe	using data from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss; data release 7), we haveconducted a search for local analogs to the extremely compact, massive,quiescent galaxies that have been identified at z &gt; 2. we show thatincompleteness is a concern for such compact galaxies, particularly for lowredshifts (z &lt; ~0.05) as a result of the sdss spectroscopic target selectionalgorithm. we have identified 63 massive red sequence galaxies at 0.066 &lt; z &lt;0.12 that are smaller than the median size-mass relation by a factor of 2 ormore. consistent with expectations from the virial theorem, the median offsetfrom the mass-velocity dispersion relation for these galaxies is 0.12 dex. wedo not find any galaxies with sizes and masses comparable to those observed atz ~ 2, implying a decrease in the comoving number density (at fixed size andmass) by a factor of &gt; 5000. this result cannot be explained by incompleteness:at 0.066 &lt; z &lt;0.12, the sdss spectroscopic sample should typically be ~75%complete for galaxies with the sizes and masses seen at high redshift, althoughfor the very smallest galaxies it may be as low as ~20%. to confirm that theabsence of such compact massive galaxies in sdss is not a spectroscopicselection effect, we have also looked for such galaxies in the sdss photometriccatalog, using photometric redshifts. while we do find signs of a bias againstmassive, compact galaxies, this analysis suggests that the sdss spectroscopicsample is missing at most a few objects in the regime we consider. acceptingthe high redshift results, it is clear that massive galaxies must undergosignificant structural evolution over z&lt;2 in order to match the population seenin the local universe. our results suggest that a highly stochastic mechanismlike major mergers cannot be the primary driver of this strong size evolution.

1002.4193	the merger-driven evolution of massive galaxies	we explore the rate and impact of galaxy mergers on the massive galaxypopulation using the amplitude of the two-point correlation function on smallscales for m &gt; 5e10 m_sun galaxies from the cosmos and combo-17 surveys. usinga pair fraction derived from the sloan digital sky survey as a low-redshiftbenchmark, the large survey area at intermediate redshifts allows us todetermine the evolution of the close pair fraction with unprecedented accuracyfor a mass-selected sample: we find that the fraction of galaxies more massivethan 5e10m_sun in pairs separated by less than 30 kpc in 3d space evolves asf(z) = (0.0130+/-0.0019)x(1+z)^1.21+/-0.25 between z = 0 and z = 1.2. assuminga merger time scale of 0.5 gyrs, the inferred merger rate is such that galaxieswith mass in excess of 1e11 m_sun have undergone, on average, 0.5 (0.7) mergersinvolving progenitor galaxies both more massive than 5e10 m_sun since z = 0.6(1.2). we also study the number density evolution of massive red sequencegalaxies using published luminosity functions and constraints on the m/levolution from the fundamental plane. moreover, we demonstrate that themeasured merger rate of massive galaxies is sufficient to explain this observednumber density evolution in massive red sequence galaxies since z = 1.

1004.0319	the physical origins of the morphology-density relation: evidence for  gas stripping from the sdss	we provide a physical interpretation and explanation of themorphology-density relation for galaxies, drawing on stellar masses, starformation rates, axis ratios and group halo masses from the sloan digital skysurvey. we first re-cast the classical morphology-density relation in morequantitative terms, using low star formation rate (quiescence) as a proxy forearly-type morphology and dark matter halo mass from a group catalog as a proxyfor environmental density: for galaxies of a given stellar mass the quiescentfraction is found to increase with increasing dark matter halo mass. our novelresult is that - at a given stellar mass - quiescent galaxies are significantlyflatter in dense environments, implying a higher fraction of disk galaxies.supposing that the denser environments differ simply by a higher incidence ofquiescent disk galaxies that are structurally similar to star-forming diskgalaxies of similar mass, explains simultaneously and quantitatively thesequiescence -nvironment and shape-environment relations. our findings addconsiderable weight to the slow removal of gas as the main physical driver ofthe morphology-density relation, at the expense of other explanations.

1009.1620	on the masses of galaxies in the local universe	we compare estimates of stellar mass, mstar, and dynamical mass,mdyn,for asample of galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). we assumedynamical homology (i.e., mdyn = dispersion**2 * reff, and we find a tight butstrongly non-linear relation: the best fit relation is mstar = mdyn**0.73, withan observed scatter of 0.15 dex. we also find that, at fixed mstar, the ratiomstar/mdyn depends strongly on galaxy structure, as parameterized by sersicindex, n. the size of the differential effect is on the order of 0.6 dex across2 &lt; n &lt; 10. the apparent n-dependence of mstar/mdyn is similar to expectationsfrom simple models, indicating that assuming homology gives the wrong dynamicalmass. we have also derived dynamical mass estimates that explicitly account fordifferences in galaxies' profiles. using this `structure-corrected' dynamicalmass estimator, m(dyn,n), the best fit relation is mstar = m(dyn,n)**(0.92 +-0.08) with an observed scatter of 0.13 dex. while the data are thus consistentwith a linear relation, they do prefer a slightly shallower slope. further, wesee only a small residual trend in mstar/m(dyn,n) with n. we find nostatistically significant systematic trends in mstar/m(dyn,n) as a function ofobserved quantities (e.g, apparent magnitude, redshift), or as a function oftracers of stellar populations. the net differential bias in mstar/m(dyn,n)across a wide range of stellar populations and star formation activities is &lt;=0.12 dex. the very good agreement between stellar mass and structure-correcteddynamical mass strongly suggests that: 1.) galaxy non-homology has a majorimpact on dynamical mass estimates, and 2. there are not strong systematicbiases in the stellar mass-to-light ratios derived from broadband optical seds.further, these results suggest that that the central dark-to-luminous massratio has a relatively weak mass dependence.

1011.6370	the star formation history of mass-selected galaxies in the cosmos field	we explore the evolution of the specific star formation rate (ssfr) for3.6um-selected galaxies of different m_* in the cosmos field. the average sfrfor sub-sets of these galaxies is estimated with stacked 1.4ghz radio continuumemission. we separately consider the total sample and a subset of galaxies (sf)that shows evidence for substantive recent star formation in the rest-frameoptical sed. at 0.2&lt;z&lt;3 both populations show a strong and m_*-independentdecrease in their ssfr towards z=0.2, best described by a power- law (1+z)^n,where n~4.3 for all galaxies and n~3.5 for sf sources. the decrease appears tohave started at z&gt;2, at least above 4x10^10m_sun where our conclusions are mostrobust. we find a tight correlation with power-law dependence, ssfr (m_*)^beta,between ssfr and m_* at all z. it tends to flatten below ~10^10m_sun ifquiescent galaxies are included; if they are excluded a shallow index beta_sfg-0.4 fits the correlation. on average, higher m_* objects always have lowerssfrs, also among sf galaxies. at z&gt;1.5 there is tentative evidence for anupper ssfr-limit that an average galaxy cannot exceed. it is suggested by aflattening of the ssfr-m_* relation (also for sf sources), but affects massive(&gt;10^10m_sun) galaxies only at the highest z. below z=1.5 there thus is nodirect evidence that galaxies of higher m_* experience a more rapid waning oftheir ssfr than lower m_* sf systems. in this sense, the data rule out anystrong 'downsizing'. we combine our results with recent measurements of thegalaxy (stellar) mass function in order to determine the characteristic mass ofa sf galaxy (m_*=10^(10.6\pm0.4)m_sun). in this sense, too, there is no'downsizing'. our analysis constitutes the most extensive sfr densitydetermination with a single technique to z=3. recent herschel results areconsistent with our results, but rely on far smaller samples.

1101.2423	the majority of compact massive galaxies at z~2 are disk dominated	we investigate the stellar structure of massive, quiescent galaxies at z~2,based on hubble space telescope/wfc3 imaging from the early release scienceprogram. our sample of 14 galaxies has stellar masses of m* &gt; 10^{10.8} msoland photometric redshifts of 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5. in agreement with previous work,their half-light radii are &lt;2 kpc, much smaller than equally massive galaxiesin the present-day universe. a significant subset of the sample appears highlyflattened in projection, which implies, considering viewing angle statistics,that a significant fraction of the galaxies in our sample have pronounceddisks. this is corroborated by two-dimensional surface brightness profile fits.we estimate that 65% +/- 15% of the population of massive, quiescent z~2galaxies are disk-dominated. the median disk scale length is 1.5 kpc,substantially smaller than the disks of equally massive galaxies in thepresent-day universe. our results provide strong observational evidence thatthe much-discussed ultra-dense high-redshift galaxies should generally bethought of as disk-like stellar systems with the majority of stars formed fromgas that had time to settle into a disk.

1106.3328	cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash): an overview	the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash) is a 524-orbitmulti-cycle treasury program to use the gravitational lensing properties of 25galaxy clusters to accurately constrain their mass distributions. the survey,described in detail in this paper, will definitively establish the degree ofconcentration of dark matter in the cluster cores, a key prediction of cdm. theclash cluster sample is larger and less biased than current samples ofspace-based imaging studies of clusters to similar depth, as we have minimizedlensing-based selection that favors systems with overly dense cores.specifically, twenty clash clusters are solely x-ray selected. the x-rayselected clusters are massive (kt &gt; 5 kev; 5 - 30 x 10^14 m_solar) and, in mostcases, dynamically relaxed. five additional clusters are included for theirlensing strength (einstein radii &gt; 35 arcsec at z_source = 2) to furtherquantify the lensing bias on concentration, to yield high resolution darkmatter maps, and to optimize the likelihood of finding highly magnifiedhigh-redshift (z &gt; 7) galaxies. the high magnification, in some cases, providesangular resolutions unobtainable with any current uvoir facility and can yieldz &gt; 7 candidates bright enough for spectroscopic follow-up. a total of 16broadband filters, spanning the near-uv to near-ir, are employed for each20-orbit campaign on each cluster. these data are used to measure precise(sigma_phz &lt; 0.02(1+z)) photometric redshifts for dozens of newly discoveredmultiply-lensed images per cluster. observations of each cluster are spreadover 8 epochs to enable a search, primarily in the parallel fields, for type iasupernovae at z &gt; 1 to improve constraints on the time dependence of the darkenergy equation of state and the evolution of such supernovae in an epoch whenthe universe is matter dominated.

1107.0317	galaxy structure and mode of star formation in the sfr-mass plane from z  ~ 2.5 to z ~ 0.1	we analyze the dependence of galaxy structure (size and sersic index) andmode of star formation (\sigma_sfr and sfr_ir/sfr_uv) on the position ofgalaxies in the sfr versus mass diagram. our sample comprises roughly 640000galaxies at z~0.1, 130000 galaxies at z~1, and 36000 galaxies at z~2.structural measurements for all but the z~0.1 galaxies were based on hstimaging, and sfrs are derived using a herschel-calibrated ladder of sfrindicators. we find that a correlation between the structure and stellarpopulation of galaxies (i.e., a 'hubble sequence') is already in place since atleast z~2.5. at all epochs, typical star-forming galaxies on the main sequenceare well approximated by exponential disks, while the profiles of quiescentgalaxies are better described by de vaucouleurs profiles. in the upper envelopeof the main sequence, the relation between the sfr and sersic index reverses,suggesting a rapid build-up of the central mass concentration in thesestarbursting outliers. we observe quiescent, moderately and highly star-formingsystems to co-exist over an order of magnitude or more in stellar mass. at eachmass and redshift, galaxies on the main sequence have the largest size. therate of size growth correlates with specific sfr, and so does \sigma_sfr ateach redshift. a simple model using an empirically determined sf law andmetallicity scaling, in combination with an assumed geometry for dust and starsis able to relate the observed \sigma_sfr and sfr_ir/sfr_uv, provided a morepatchy dust geometry is assumed for high-redshift galaxies.

1107.3147	the uvj selection of quiescent and star forming galaxies: separating  early and late-type galaxies and isolating edge-on spirals	we utilize for the first time hst acs imaging to examine the structuralproperties of galaxies in the rest-frame u-v versus v-j diagram (i.e., the uvjdiagram) using a sample at 0.6&lt;z&lt;0.9 that reaches a low stellar mass limit (logm/msun&gt;10.25). the use of the uvj diagram as a tool to distinguish quiescentgalaxies from star forming galaxies (sfgs) is becoming more common due to itsability to separate red quiescent galaxies from reddened sfgs. quiescentgalaxies occupy a small and distinct region of uvj color space and we find mostof them to have concentrated profiles with high sersic indices (n&gt;2.5) andsmooth structure characteristic of early-type systems. sfgs populate a broad,but well-defined sequence of uvj colors and are comprised of objects with a mixof sersic indices. interestingly, most uvj-selected sfgs with high sersicindices also display structure due to dust and star formation typical of then&lt;2.5 sfgs and late-type systems. finally, we find that the position of a sfgon the sequence of uvj colors is determined to a large degree by the mass ofthe galaxy and its inclination. systems that are closer to edge-on generallydisplay redder colors and lower [oii]3727 luminosity per unit mass as aconsequence of the reddening due to dust within the disks. we conclude that thetwo main features seen in uvj color space correspond closely to the traditionalmorphological classes of early and late-type galaxies.

1108.6086	a constant limiting mass scale for flat early-type galaxies from z=1 to  z=0: density evolves but shapes do not	we measure the evolution in the intrinsic shape distribution of early-typegalaxies from z~1 to z~0 by analyzing their projected axis-ratio distributions.we extract a low-redshift sample (0.04 &lt; z &lt; 0.08) of early-type galaxies withvery low star-formation rates from the sdss, based on a color-color selectionscheme and verified through the absence of emission lines in the spectra. theinferred intrinsic shape distribution of these early-type galaxies is stronglymass dependent: the typical short-to-long intrinsic axis-ratio of high-massearly-type galaxies (&gt;1e11 m_sun) is 2:3, where as at masses below 1e11 m_sunthis ratio narrows to 1:3, or more flattened galaxies. in an entirely analogousmanner we select a high-redshift sample (0.6 &lt; z &lt; 0.8) from two deep-fieldsurveys: gems and cosmos. we find a seemingly universal mass of ~1e11 m_sun forhighly flatted early-type systems at all redshifts. this implies that theprocess that grows an early-type galaxy above this ceiling mass involvesforming round systems. using both parametric and non-parametric tests, we findno evolution in the projected axis-ratio distribution for galaxies with masses&gt;3e10 m_sun with redshift. at the same time, our samples imply an increase of2-3x in co-moving number density for early-type galaxies at masses &gt;3e10 m_sun,in agreement with previous studies. given the direct connection between theaxis-ratio distribution and the underlying bulge-to-disk ratio distribution,our findings imply that the number density evolution of early-type galaxies isnot exclusively driven by the emergence of either bulge- or disk-dominatedgalaxies, but rather by a balanced mix that depends only on the stellar mass ofthe galaxy. the challenge for galaxy formation models is to reproduce thisoverall non-evolving ratio of flattened to round early-type galaxies in thecontext of a continually growing population.

1109.2588	candels: constraining the agn-merger connection with host morphologies  at z~2	using hst/wfc3 imaging taken as part of the cosmic assembly near-infrareddeep extragalactic legacy survey (candels), we examine the role that majorgalaxy mergers play in triggering active galactic nuclei (agn) activity at z~2.our sample consists of 72 moderate-luminosity (lx ~ 1e42-1e44 erg/s) agn at1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5 that are selected using the 4 msec chandra observations in thechandra deep field south, the deepest x-ray observations to date. employingvisual classifications, we have analyzed the rest-frame optical morphologies ofthe agn host galaxies and compared them to a mass-matched control sample of 216non-active galaxies at the same redshift. we find that most of the agn residein disk galaxies (51.4%), while a smaller percentage are found in spheroids(27.8%). roughly 16.7% of the agn hosts have highly disturbed morphologies andappear to be involved in a major merger or interaction, while most of the hosts(55.6%) appear relatively relaxed and undisturbed. these fractions arestatistically consistent with the fraction of control galaxies that showsimilar morphological disturbances. these results suggest that the hosts ofmoderate-luminosity agn are no more likely to be involved in an ongoing mergeror interaction relative to non-active galaxies of similar mass at z~2. the highdisk fraction observed among the agn hosts also appears to be at odds withpredictions that merger-driven accretion should be the dominant agn fuelingmode at z~2, even at moderate x-ray luminosities. although we cannot rule outthat minor mergers are responsible for triggering these systems, the presenceof a large population of relatively undisturbed disk-like hosts suggests thatsecular processes play a greater role in fueling agn activity at z~2 thanpreviously thought.

1109.5352	the similar stellar populations of quiescent spiral and elliptical  galaxies	we compare the stellar population properties in the central regions ofvisually classified non-starforming spiral and elliptical galaxies from galaxyzoo and sdss dr7. the galaxies lie in the redshift range $0.04&lt;z&lt;0.1$ and havestellar masses larger than $logm_*=10.4$. we select only face-on spiralgalaxies in order to avoid contamination by light from the disk in the sdssfiber and enabling the robust visual identification of spiral structure.overall, we find that galaxies with larger central stellar velocitydispersions, regardless of morphological type, have older ages, highermetallicities, and an increased overabundance of alpha-elements. age andalpha-enhancement, at fixed velocity dispersion, do not depend on morphologicaltype. the only parameter that, at a given velocity dispersion, correlates withmorphological type is metallicity, where the metallicity of the bulges ofspiral galaxies is 0.07 dex higher than that of the ellipticals. however, forgalaxies with a given total stellar mass, this dependence on morphologydisappears. under the assumption that, for our sample, the velocity dispersiontraces the mass of the bulge alone, as opposed to the total mass (bulge+disk)of the galaxy, our results imply that the formation epoch of galaxy and theduration of its star-forming period are linked to the mass of the bulge. theextent to which metals are retained within the galaxy, and not removed as aresult of outflows, is determined by the total mass of the galaxy.

1110.3786	what turns galaxies off? the different morphologies of star-forming and  quiescent galaxies since z~2 from candels	we use hst/wfc3 imaging from the candels multicycle treasury survey, inconjunction with the sloan digital sky survey, to explore the evolution ofgalactic structure for galaxies with stellar masses &gt;3e10m_sun from z=2.2 tothe present epoch, a time span of 10gyr. we explore the relationship betweenrest-frame optical color, stellar mass, star formation activity and galaxystructure. we confirm the dramatic increase from z=2.2 to the present day inthe number density of non-star-forming galaxies above 3e10m_sun reported byothers. we further find that the vast majority of these quiescent systems haveconcentrated light profiles, as parametrized by the sersic index, and thepopulation of concentrated galaxies grows similarly rapidly. we examine thejoint distribution of star formation activity, sersic index, stellar mass,inferred velocity dispersion, and stellar surface density. quiescencecorrelates poorly with stellar mass at all z&lt;2.2. quiescence correlates wellwith sersic index at all redshifts. quiescence correlates well with `velocitydispersion' and stellar surface density at z&gt;1.3, and somewhat less well atlower redshifts. yet, there is significant scatter between quiescence andgalaxy structure: while the vast majority of quiescent galaxies have prominentbulges, many of them have significant disks, and a number of bulge-dominatedgalaxies have significant star formation. noting the rarity of quiescentgalaxies without prominent bulges, we argue that a prominent bulge (andperhaps, by association, a supermassive black hole) is an important conditionfor quenching star formation on galactic scales over the last 10gyr, inqualitative agreement with the agn feedback paradigm.

1110.3801	rest-frame uv--optically selected galaxies at 2.3&lt;z&lt;3.5: searching for  dusty star-forming and passively-evolving galaxies	a new set of color selection criteria (vjl) analogous with the bzk method isdesigned to select both star-forming galaxies (sfgs) and passively-evolvinggalaxies (pegs) at 2.3&lt;z&lt;3.5 by using rest-frame uv--optical (v-j vs. j-l)colors. the criteria are thoroughly tested with theoretical stellar populationsynthesis models and real galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts to evaluatetheir efficiency and contamination. we apply the well-tested vjl criteria tothe hst/wfc3 early release science field and study the physical properties ofselected galaxies. the redshift distribution of selected sfgs peaks at z~2.7,slightly lower than that of lyman break galaxies at z~3. comparing the observedmid-infrared fluxes of selected galaxies with the prediction of pure stellaremission, we find that our vjl method is effective at selecting massive dustysfgs that are missed by the lyman break technique. about half of the starformation in massive (m_{star}&gt;10^{10}m_{sun}) galaxies at 2.3&lt;z&lt;3.5 iscontributed by dusty (extinction e(b-v)&gt;0.4) sfgs, which however, only accountfor ~20% of the number density of massive sfgs. we also use the mid-infraredfluxes to clean our peg sample, and find that galaxy size can be used as asecondary criterion to effectively eliminate the contamination of dusty sfgs.the redshift distribution of the cleaned peg sample peaks at z~2.5. we find 6peg candidates at z&gt;3 and discuss possible methods to distinguish them fromdusty contamination. we conclude that at least part of our candidates are realpegs at z~3, implying that this type of galaxies began to form their stars atz&gt;5. we measure the integrated stellar mass density of pegs at z~2.5 and setconstraints on it at z&gt;3. we find that the integrated stellar mass densitygrows by at least about factor of 10 in 1 gyr at 3&lt;z&lt;5 and by another factor of10 in next 3.5 gyr (1&lt;z&lt;3).

1203.2611	smooth(er) stellar mass maps in candels: constraints on the longevity of  clumps in high-redshift star-forming galaxies	we perform a detailed analysis of the resolved colors and stellar populationsof a complete sample of 323 star-forming galaxies at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.5, and 326star-forming galaxies at 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5 in the ers and candels-deep region ofgoods-south. galaxies were selected to be more massive than 10^10 msun and havespecific star formation rates above 1/t_h. we model the 7-band optical acs +near-ir wfc3 spectral energy distributions of individual bins of pixels,accounting simultaneously for the galaxy-integrated photometric constraintsavailable over a longer wavelength range. we analyze variations in rest-framecolor, stellar surface mass density, age, and extinction as a function ofgalactocentric radius and local surface brightness/density, and measurestructural parameters on luminosity and stellar mass maps. we find evidence forredder colors, older stellar ages, and increased dust extinction in the nucleiof galaxies. big star-forming clumps seen in star formation tracers are lessprominent or even invisible on the inferred stellar mass distributions.off-center clumps contribute up to ~20% to the integrated sfr, but only 7% orless to the integrated mass of all massive star-forming galaxies at z ~ 1 and z~ 2, with the fractional contributions being a decreasing function ofwavelength used to select the clumps. the stellar mass profiles tend to havesmaller sizes and m20 coefficients, and higher concentration and ginicoefficients than the light distribution. our results are consistent with aninside-out disk growth scenario with brief (100 - 200 myr) episodic localenhancements in star formation superposed on the underlying disk.alternatively, the young ages of off-center clumps may signal inward clumpmigration, provided this happens efficiently on the order of an orbitaltimescale.

1204.2305	a highly magnified candidate for a young galaxy seen when the universe  was 500 myrs old	the early universe at redshift z\sim6-11 marks the reionization of theintergalactic medium, following the formation of the first generation of stars.however, those young galaxies at a cosmic age of \lesssim 500 million years(myr, at z \gtrsim 10) remain largely unexplored as they are at or beyond thesensitivity limits of current large telescopes. gravitational lensing by galaxyclusters enables the detection of high-redshift galaxies that are fainter thanwhat otherwise could be found in the deepest images of the sky. we report thediscovery of an object found in the multi-band observations of the clustermacs1149+22 that has a high probability of being a gravitationally magnifiedobject from the early universe. the object is firmly detected (12 sigma) in thetwo reddest bands of hst/wfc3, and not detected below 1.2 {\mu}m, matching thecharacteristics of z\sim9 objects. we derive a robust photometric redshift of z= 9.6 \pm 0.2, corresponding to a cosmic age of 490 \pm 15myr (i.e., 3.6% ofthe age of the universe). the large number of bands used to derive the redshiftestimate make it one of the most accurate estimates ever obtained for such adistant object. the significant magnification by cluster lensing (a factor of\sim15) allows us to analyze the object's ultra-violet and optical luminosityin its rest-frame, thus enabling us to constrain on its stellar mass,star-formation rate and age. if the galaxy is indeed at such a large redshift,then its age is less than 200 myr (at the 95% confidence level), implying aformation redshift of zf \lesssim 14. the object is the first z&gt;9 candidatethat is bright enough for detailed spectroscopic studies with jwst,demonstrating the unique potential of galaxy cluster fields for finding highlymagnified, intrinsically faint galaxies at the highest redshifts.

1206.5000	candels: the progenitors of compact quiescent galaxies at z~2	we combine high-resolution hst/wfc3 images with multi-wavelength photometryto track the evolution of structure and activity of massive (log(m*) &gt; 10)galaxies at redshifts z = 1.4 - 3 in two fields of the cosmic assemblynear-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey (candels). we detect compact,star-forming galaxies (csfgs) whose number densities, masses, sizes, and starformation rates qualify them as likely progenitors of compact, quiescent,massive galaxies (cqgs) at z = 1.5 - 3. at z &gt; 2 most csfgs have specificstar-formation rates (ssfr = 10^-9 yr^-1) half that of typical, massive sfgs atthe same epoch, and host x-ray luminous agn 30 times (~30%) more frequently.these properties suggest that csfgs are formed by gas-rich processes (mergersor disk-instabilities) that induce a compact starburst and feed an agn, which,in turn, quench the star formation on dynamical timescales (few 10^8 yr). thecsfgs are continuously being formed at z = 2 - 3 and fade to cqgs by z = 1.5.after this epoch, csfgs are rare, thereby truncating the formation of new cqgs.meanwhile, down to z = 1, existing cqgs continue to enlarge to match local qgsin size, while less-gas-rich mergers and other secular mechanisms shepherd(larger) sfgs as later arrivals to the red sequence. in summary, we propose twoevolutionary scenarios of qg formation: an early (z &gt; 2), fast-formation pathof rapidly-quenched csfgs that evolve into cqgs that later enlarge within thequiescent phase, and a slow, late-arrival (z &lt; 2) path for sfgs to form qgswithout passing through a compact state.

1207.3795	3d-hst grism spectroscopy of a gravitationally lensed, low-metallicity  starburst galaxy at z=1.847	we present hubble space telescope (hst) imaging and spectroscopy of thegravitational lens sl2sj02176-0513, a cusp arc at z=1.847. the uv continuum ofthe lensed galaxy is very blue, which is seemingly at odds with its redderoptical colors. the 3d-hst wfc3/g141 near-infrared spectrum of the lens revealsthe source of this discrepancy to be extremely strong [oiii]5007 and h-betaemission lines with rest-frame equivalent widths of 2000 +/- 100 and 520 +/- 40angstroms, respectively. the source has a stellar mass ~10^8 msun, ssfr \sim100/gyr, and detection of [oiii]4363 yields a metallicity of 12 + log(o/h) =7.5 +/- 0.2. we identify local blue compact dwarf analogs to sl2sj02176-0513,which are among the most metal-poor galaxies in the sdss. the local analogsresemble the lensed galaxy in many ways, including uv/optical sed, spatialmorphology and emission line equivalent widths and ratios. common tosl2sj02176-0513 and its local counterparts is an upturn at mid-ir wavelengthslikely arising from hot dust heated by starbursts. the emission lines ofsl2sj02176-0513 are spatially resolved owing to the combination of the lens andthe high spatial resolution of hst. the lensed galaxy is composed of two clumpswith combined size r_e \sim 300 pc, and we resolve significant differences inuv color and emission line equivalent width between them. though it hascharacteristics occasionally attributed to active galactic nuclei, we concludethat sl2sj02176-0513 is a low-metallicity star-bursting dwarf galaxy. suchgalaxies will be found in significant numbers in the full 3d-hst grism survey.

1211.2113	shape evolution of massive early-type galaxies: confirmation of  increased disk prevalence at z&gt;1	we use high-resolution k-band vlt/hawk-i imaging over 0.25 square degrees tostudy the structural evolution of massive early-type galaxies since z~1.mass-selected samples, complete down to log(m/m_sun)~10.7 such that `typical'l* galaxies are included at all redshifts, are drawn from pre-existingphotometric redshift surveys. we then separated the samples into differentredshift slices and classify them as late- or early-type galaxies on the basisof their specific star-formation rate. axis-ratio measurements for the ~400early-type galaxies in the redshift range 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.8 are accurate to 0.1 orbetter. the projected axis-ratio distributions are then compared with lowerredshift samples. we find strong evidence for evolution of the populationproperties: early-type galaxies at z&gt;1 are, on average, flatter than at z&lt;1 andthe median projected axis ratio at a fixed mass decreases with redshift.however, we also find that at all epochs z&lt;~2 the very most massive early-typegalaxies (log(m/m_sun)&gt;11.3) are the roundest, with a pronounced lack amongthem of galaxies that are flat in projection. merging is a plausible mechanismthat can explain both results: at all epochs merging is required for early-typegalaxies to grow beyond log(m/m_sun)~11.3, and all early types over timegradually and partially loose their disk-like characteristics.

1211.3663	clash: three strongly lensed images of a candidate z ~ 11 galaxy	we present a candidate for the most distant galaxy known to date with aphotometric redshift z = 10.7 +0.6 / -0.4 (95% confidence limits; with z &lt; 9.5galaxies of known types ruled out at 7.2-sigma). this j-dropout lyman breakgalaxy, named macs0647-jd, was discovered as part of the cluster lensing andsupernova survey with hubble (clash). we observe three magnified images of thisgalaxy due to strong gravitational lensing by the galaxy clustermacsj0647.7+7015 at z = 0.591. the images are magnified by factors of ~8, 7,and 2, with the brighter two observed at ~26th magnitude ab (~0.15 ujy) in thewfc3/ir f160w filter (~1.4 - 1.7 um) where they are detected at &gt;~ 12-sigma.all three images are also confidently detected at &gt;~ 6-sigma in f140w (~1.2 -1.6 um), dropping out of detection from 15 lower wavelength hst filters (~0.2 -1.4 um), and lacking bright detections in spitzer/irac 3.6um and 4.5um imaging(~3.2 - 5.0 um). we rule out a broad range of possible lower redshiftinterlopers, including some previously published as high redshift candidates.our high redshift conclusion is more conservative than if we had neglected abayesian photometric redshift prior. given clash observations of 17 high massclusters to date, our discoveries of macs0647-jd at z ~ 10.8 and macs1149-jd1at z ~ 9.6 are consistent with a lensed luminosity function extrapolated fromlower redshifts. this would suggest that low luminosity galaxies could havereionized the universe. however given the significant uncertainties based ononly two galaxies, we cannot yet rule out the sharp drop off in number countsat z &gt;~ 10 suggested by field searches.

1211.6429	an over-massive black hole in the compact lenticular galaxy ngc1277	all massive galaxies likely have supermassive black holes at their centers,and the masses of the black holes are known to correlate with properties of thehost galaxy bulge component. several explanations have been proposed for theexistence of these locally-established empirical relationships; they includethe non-causal, statistical process of galaxy-galaxy merging, direct feedbackbetween the black hole and its host galaxy, or galaxy-galaxy merging and thesubsequent violent relaxation and dissipation. the empirical scaling relationsare thus important for distinguishing between various theoretical models ofgalaxy evolution, and they further form the basis for all black hole massmeasurements at large distances. in particular, observations have shown thatthe mass of the black hole is typically 0.1% of the stellar bulge mass of thegalaxy. the small galaxy ngc4486b currently has the largest published fractionof its mass in a black hole at 11%. here we report observations of the stellarkinematics of ngc 1277, which is a compact, disky galaxy with a mass of 1.2 x10^11 msun. from the data, we determine that the mass of the central black holeis 1.7 x 10^10 msun, or 59% its bulge mass. five other compact galaxies haveproperties similar to ngc 1277 and therefore may also contain over-sized blackholes. it is not yet known if these galaxies represent a tail of adistribution, or if disk-dominated galaxies fail to follow the normal blackhole mass scaling relations.

1301.0320	the radial distribution of star formation in galaxies at z~1 from the  3d-hst survey	the assembly of galaxies can be described by the distribution of their starformation as a function of cosmic time. thanks to the wfc3 grism on hst it isnow possible to measure this beyond the local universe. here we present thespatial distribution of halpha emission for a sample of 54 stronglystar-forming galaxies at z~1 in the 3d-hst treasury survey. by stacking thehalpha emission we find that star formation occurred in approximatelyexponential distributions at z~1, with median sersic index of n=1.0+-0.2. thestacks are elongated with median axis ratios of b/a=0.58+-0.09 in halpha,consistent with (possibly thick) disks at random orientation angles. keckspectra obtained for a subset of eight of the galaxies show clear evidence forrotation, with inclination-corrected velocities of 90 to 330 km/s. the moststraightforward interpretation of our results is that star formation instrongly star-forming galaxies at z~1 generally occurred in disks. the disksappear to be "scaled-up" versions of nearby spiral galaxies: they haveew(halpha)~100 angstroms out to the solar orbit and they have star formationsurface densities above the threshold for driving galactic scale winds.

1303.3584	the spatial extent and distribution of star formation in 3d-hst mergers  at z~1.5	we present an analysis of the spatial distribution of star formation in asample of 60 visually identified galaxy merger candidates at z&gt;1. our sample,drawn from the 3d-hst survey, is flux-limited and was selected to have highstar formation rates based on fits of their broad-band, low spatial resolutionspectral energy distributions. it includes plausible pre-merger (close pairs)and post-merger (single objects with tidal features) systems, with totalstellar masses and star formation rates derived from multi-wavelengthphotometry. here we use near-infrared slitless spectra from 3d-hst whichproduce halpha or [oiii] emission line maps as proxies for star-formation maps.this provides a first comprehensive high-resolution, empirical picture of wherestar formation occurred in galaxy mergers at the epoch of peak cosmic starformation rate. we find that detectable star formation can occur in one or bothgalaxy centres, or in tidal tails. the most common case (58%) is that starformation is largely concentrated in a single, compact region, coincident withthe centre of (one of) the merger components. no correlations between starformation morphology and redshift, total stellar mass, or star formation rateare found. a restricted set of hydrodynamical merger simulations betweensimilarly massive and gas-rich objects implies that star formation should bedetectable in both merger components, when the gas fractions of the individualcomponents are the same. this suggests that z~1.5 mergers typically occurbetween galaxies whose gas fractions, masses, and/or star formation rates aredistinctly different from one another.

1304.2391	the assembly of milky way-like galaxies since z~2.5	galaxies with the mass of the milky way dominate the stellar mass density ofthe universe but it is uncertain how and when they were assembled. here westudy progenitors of these galaxies out to z=2.5, using data from the 3d-hstand candels treasury surveys. we find that galaxies with present-day stellarmasses of log(m)~10.7 built ~90% of their stellar mass since z=2.5, with mostof the star formation occurring before z=1. in marked contrast to the assemblyhistory of massive elliptical galaxies, mass growth is not limited to largeradii: the mass in the central 2 kpc of the galaxies increased by a factor of3.2+-0.8 between z=2.5 and z=1. we therefore rule out simple models in whichbulges were fully assembled at high redshift and disks gradually formed aroundthem. instead, bulges (and black holes) likely formed in lockstep with disks,through bar instabilities, migration, or other processes. we find that afterz=1 the growth in the central regions gradually stopped and the disk continuedto build, consistent with recent studies of the gas distributions in z~1galaxies and the properties of many spiral galaxies today.

0801.1995	the dependence of galaxy morphology and structure on environment and  stellar mass	from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release 5 (dr5), we extract asample of 4594 galaxies at redshifts 0.02&lt;z&lt;0.03, complete down to a stellarmass of m=10^10 msol. we quantify their structure (sersic index), morphology(sersic index + ``bumpiness''), and local environment. we show that morphologyand structure are intrinsically different galaxy properties, and we demonstratethat this is a physically relevant distinction by showing that these propertiesdepend differently on galaxy mass and environment. structure mainly depends ongalaxy mass whereas morphology mainly depends on environment. this is driven byvariations in star formation activity, as traced by color, which only weaklyaffects the structure of a galaxy but strongly affects its morphologicalappearance. the implication of our results is that the existence of themorphology-density relation is intrinsic and not just due to a combination ofmore fundamental, underlying relations. our findings have consequences forhigh-redshift studies, which often use some measure of structure as a proxy formorphology. a direct comparison with local samples selected through visuallyclassified morphologies may lead to biases in the inferred evolution of themorphological mix of the galaxy population, and misinterpretations in terms ofhow galaxy evolution depends on mass and environment.

1310.5702	a candels - 3d-hst synergy: resolved star formation patterns at 0.7 &lt; z  &lt; 1.5	we analyze the resolved stellar populations of 473 massive star-forminggalaxies at 0.7 &lt; z &lt; 1.5, with multi-wavelength broad-band imaging fromcandels and halpha surface brightness profiles at the same kiloparsecresolution from 3d-hst. together, this unique data set sheds light on how theassembled stellar mass is distributed within galaxies, and where new stars arebeing formed. we find the halpha morphologies to resemble more closely thoseobserved in the acs i band than in the wfc3 h band, especially for the largersystems. we next derive a novel prescription for halpha dust corrections, whichaccounts for extra extinction towards hii regions. the prescription leads toconsistent sfr estimates and reproduces the observed relation between thehalpha/uv luminosity ratio and visual extinction, both on a pixel-by-pixel andon a galaxy-integrated level. we find the surface density of star formation tocorrelate with the surface density of assembled stellar mass for spatiallyresolved regions within galaxies, akin to the so-called 'main sequence of starformation' established on a galaxy-integrated level. deviations from thisrelation towards lower equivalent widths are found in the inner regions ofgalaxies. clumps and spiral features, on the other hand, are associated withenhanced halpha equivalent widths, bluer colors, and higher specific starformation rates compared to the underlying disk. their halpha/uv luminosityratio is lower than that of the underlying disk, suggesting the acs clumpselection preferentially picks up those regions of elevated star formationactivity that are the least obscured by dust. our analysis emphasizes thatmonochromatic studies of galaxy structure can be severely limited bymass-to-light ratio variations due to dust and spatially inhomogeneous starformation histories.

1310.7020	exploring the chemical link between local ellipticals and their  high-redshift progenitors	we present keck/mosfire k-band spectroscopy of the first mass-selected sampleof galaxies at $z\sim2.3$. targets are selected from the 3d-hst treasurysurvey. the six detected galaxies have a mean [nii]$\lambda$6584/h$\alpha$ratio of $0.27\pm0.01$, with a small standard deviation of 0.05. this meanvalue is similar to that of uv-selected galaxies of the same mass. the meangas-phase oxygen abundance inferred from the [nii]/h$\alpha$ ratios depends onthe calibration method, and ranges from 12+log(o/h)$_{gas}=8.57$ for the{pettini} &amp; {pagel} (2004) calibration to 12+log(o/h)$_{gas}= 8.87$ for the{maiolino} {et~al.} (2008) calibration. measurements of the stellar oxygenabundance in nearby quiescent galaxies with the same number density indicate12+log(o/h)$_{stars}= 8.95$, similar to the gas-phase abundances of the$z\sim2.3$ galaxies if the {maiolino} {et~al.} (2008) calibration is used. thissuggests that these high-redshift star forming galaxies may be progenitors oftoday's massive early-type galaxies. the main uncertainties are the absolutecalibration of the gas-phase oxygen abundance and the incompleteness of the$z\sim2.3$ sample: the galaxies with detected h$\alpha$ tend to be larger andhave higher star formation rates than the galaxies without detected h$\alpha$,and we may still be missing the most dust-obscured progenitors.

1403.3689	3d-hst wfc3-selected photometric catalogs in the five candels/3d-hst  fields: photometry, photometric redshifts and stellar masses	the 3d-hst and candels programs have provided wfc3 and acs spectroscopy andphotometry over ~900 square arcminutes in five fields: aegis, cosmos,goods-north, goods-south, and the ukidss uds field. all these fields have awealth of publicly available imaging datasets in addition to the hst data,which makes it possible to construct the spectral energy distributions (seds)of objects over a wide wavelength range. in this paper we describe aphotometric analysis of the candels and 3d-hst hst imaging and the ancillaryimaging data at wavelengths 0.3um to 8um. objects were selected in the wfc3near-ir bands, and their seds were determined by carefully taking the effectsof the point spread function in each observation into account. a total of 147distinct imaging datasets were used in the analysis. the photometry is madeavailable in the form of six catalogs: one for each field, as well as a mastercatalog containing all objects in the entire survey. we also provide deriveddata products: photometric redshifts, determined with the eazy code, andstellar population parameters determined with the fast code. we make all theimaging data that were used in the analysis available, including our reductionsof the wfc3 imaging in all five fields. 3d-hst is a spectroscopic survey withthe wfc3 and acs grisms, and the photometric catalogs presented here constitutea necessary first step in the analysis of these grism data. all the datapresented in this paper are available through the 3d-hst website.

1404.4874	dense cores in galaxies out to z=2.5 in sdss, ultravista, and the five  3d-hst/candels fields	the dense interiors of massive galaxies are among the most intriguingenvironments in the universe. in this paper we ask when these dense cores wereformed and determine how galaxies gradually assembled around them. we selectgalaxies that have a stellar mass &gt;3x10^10 msun inside r=1 kpc out to z=2.5,using the 3d-hst survey and data at low redshift. remarkably, the numberdensity of galaxies with dense cores appears to have decreased from z=2.5 tothe present. this decrease is probably mostly due to stellar mass loss and theresulting adiabatic expansion, with some contribution from merging. we inferthat dense cores were mostly formed at z&gt;2.5, consistent with their largelyquiescent stellar populations. while the cores appear to form early, thegalaxies in which they reside show strong evolution: their total massesincrease by a factor of 2-3 from z=2.5 to z=0 and their effective radiiincrease by a factor of 5-6. as a result, the contribution of dense cores tothe total mass of the galaxies in which they reside decreases from ~50% atz=2.5 to ~15% at z=0. because of their early formation, the contribution ofdense cores to the total stellar mass budget of the universe is a strongfunction of redshift. the stars in cores with m_1kpc&gt;3x10^10 msun make up ~0.1%of the stellar mass density of the universe today but 10%-20% at z~2, dependingon their imf. the formation of these cores required the conversion of ~10^11msun of gas into stars within ~1 kpc, while preventing significant starformation at larger radii.

1405.7876	clash-x: a comparison of lensing and x-ray techniques for measuring the  mass profiles of galaxy clusters	we present profiles of temperature (tx), gas mass, and hydrostatic massestimated from new and archival x-ray observations of clash clusters. wecompare measurements derived from xmm and chandra observations with one anotherand compare both to gravitational lensing mass profiles derived with clash hstand ground-based lensing data. radial profiles of chandra and xmm electrondensity and enclosed gas mass are nearly identical, indicating that differencesin hydrostatic masses inferred from x-ray observations arise from differencesin tx measurements. encouragingly, cluster txs are consistent with one anotherat ~100-200 kpc radii but xmm tx systematically decline relative to chandra txat larger radii. the angular dependence of the discrepancy suggests additionalinvestigation on systematics such as the xmm point spread function correction,vignetting and off-axis responses. we present the clash-x mass-profilecomparisons in the form of cosmology-independent and redshift-independentcircular-velocity profiles. ratios of chandra hse mass profiles to clashlensing profiles show no obvious radial dependence in the 0.3-0.8 mpc range.however, the mean mass biases inferred from the wl and sawlens data aredifferent. e.g., the weighted-mean value at 0.5 mpc is &lt;b&gt; = 0.12 for the wlcomparison and &lt;b&gt; = -0.11 for the sawlens comparison. the ratios of xmm hsemass profiles to clash lensing profiles show a pronounced radial dependence inthe 0.3-1.0 mpc range, with a weighted mean mass bias of value rising to&lt;b&gt;~0.3 at ~1 mpc for the wl comparison and &lt;b&gt; of 0.25 for sawlens comparison.the enclosed gas mass profiles from both chandra and xmm rise to a value 1/8times the total-mass profiles inferred from lensing at 0.5 mpc and remainconstant outside of that radius, suggesting that [8xmgas] profiles may be anexcellent proxy for total-mass profiles at &gt;0.5 mpc in massive galaxy clusters.

1406.3350	a massive galaxy in its core formation phase three billion years after  the big bang	most massive galaxies are thought to have formed their dense stellar cores atearly cosmic epochs. however, cores in their formation phase have not yet beenobserved. previous studies have found galaxies with high gas velocitydispersions or small apparent sizes but so far no objects have been identifiedwith both the stellar structure and the gas dynamics of a forming core. here wepresent a candidate core in formation 11 billion years ago, at z=2.3.goods-n-774 has a stellar mass of 1.0x10^11 msun, a half-light radius of 1.0kpc, and a star formation rate of 90[+45-20]msun/yr. the star forming gas has avelocity dispersion 317+-30 km/s, amongst the highest ever measured. it issimilar to the stellar velocity dispersions of the putative descendants ofgoods-n-774, compact quiescent galaxies at z~2 and giant elliptical galaxies inthe nearby universe. galaxies such as goods-n-774 appear to be rare; however,from the star formation rate and size of the galaxy we infer that many starforming cores may be heavily obscured, and could be missed in optical andnear-infrared surveys.

1406.3351	the nature of extreme emission line galaxies at z=1-2: kinematics and  metallicities from near-infrared spectroscopy	we present near-infrared spectroscopy of a sample of 22 extreme emission linegalaxies at redshifts 1.3 &lt; z &lt; 2.3, confirming that these are low-mass (m* =10^8 - 10^9 m_sun) galaxies undergoing intense starburst episodes (m*/sfr ~10-100 myr). the sample is selected by [o iii] or h{\alpha} emission line fluxand equivalent width using near-infrared grism spectroscopy from the 3d-hstsurvey. high-resolution nir spectroscopy is obtained with lbt/luci andvlt/x-shooter. the [o iii]/h{\beta} line ratio is high (&gt; 5) and [nii]/h{\alpha} is always significantly below unity, which suggests a lowgas-phase metallicity. we are able to determine gas-phase metallicities for 7of our objects using various strong-line methods, with values in the range0.05-0.30 z_sun and with a median of 0.15 z_sun; for 3 of these objects wedetect [o iii]{\lambda}4363 which allows for a direct constraint on themetallicity. the velocity dispersion, as measured from the nebular emissionlines, is typically ~50 km/s. combined with the observed star-forming activity,the jeans and toomre stability criteria imply that the gas fraction must belarge (&gt; 2/3), consistent with the difference between our dynamical and stellarmass estimates. the implied gas depletion time scale (several hundred myr) issubstantially longer than the inferred mass-weighted ages (~50 myr), whichfurther supports the emerging picture that most stars in low-mass galaxies formin short, intense bursts of star formation.

1411.3339	deconstructing the galaxy stellar mass function with ukidss and candels:  the impact of colour, structure and environment	we combine photometry from the uds, and candels uds and candels goods-ssurveys to construct the galaxy stellar mass function probing both the low andhigh mass end accurately in the redshift range 0.3&lt;z&lt;3. the advantages of usinga homogeneous concatenation of these datasets include meaningful measures ofenvironment in the uds, due to its large area (0.88 deg^2), and the highresolution deep imaging in candels (h_160 &gt; 26.0), affording us robust measuresof structural parameters. we construct stellar mass functions for the entiresample as parameterised by the schechter function, and find that there is adecline in the values of phi and of alpha with higher redshifts, and a nearlyconstant m* up to z~3. we divide the galaxy stellar mass function by colour,structure, and environment and explore the links between environmentalover-density, morphology, and the quenching of star formation. we find that adouble schechter function describes galaxies with high sersic index (n&gt;2.5),similar to galaxies which are red or passive. the low-mass end of the n&gt;2.5stellar mass function is dominated by blue galaxies, whereas the high-mass endis dominated by red galaxies. this hints that possible links betweenmorphological evolution and star formation quenching are only present inhigh-mass galaxies. this is turn suggests that there are strong mass dependentquenching mechanisms. in addition, we find that the number density of high masssystems is elevated in dense environments, suggesting that an environmentalprocess is building up massive galaxies quicker in over densities than in lowerdensities.

1411.5689	on the importance of using appropriate spectral models to derive  physical properties of galaxies at 0.7&lt;z&lt;2.8	interpreting observations of distant galaxies in terms of constraints onphysical parameters - such as stellar mass, star-formation rate (sfr) and dustoptical depth - requires spectral synthesis modelling. we analyse thereliability of these physical parameters as determined under commonly adopted`classical' assumptions: star-formation histories assumed to be exponentiallydeclining functions of time, a simple dust law and no emission-linecontribution. improved modelling techniques and data quality now allow us touse a more sophisticated approach, including realistic star-formationhistories, combined with modern prescriptions for dust attenuation and nebularemission (pacifici et al. 2012). we present a bayesian analysis of the spectraand multi-wavelength photometry of 1048 galaxies from the 3d-hst survey in theredshift range 0.7&lt;z&lt;2.8 and in the stellar mass range 9&lt;log(m/mo)&lt;12. we findthat, using the classical spectral library, stellar masses are systematicallyoverestimated (~0.1 dex) and sfrs are systematically underestimated (~0.6 dex)relative to our more sophisticated approach. we also find that the simultaneousfit of photometric fluxes and emission-line equivalent widths helps break adegeneracy between sfr and optical depth of the dust, reducing theuncertainties on these parameters. finally, we show how the biases of classicalapproaches can affect the correlation between stellar mass and sfr forstar-forming galaxies (the `star-formation main sequence'). we conclude thatthe normalization, slope and scatter of this relation strongly depend on theadopted approach and demonstrate that the classical, oversimplified approachcannot recover the true distribution of stellar mass and sfr.

1412.7909	clash: extreme emission line galaxies and their implication on selection  of high-redshift galaxies	we utilize the clash (cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble)observations of 25 clusters to search for extreme emission-line galaxies(eelgs). the selections are carried out in two central bands: f105w (y105) andf125w (j125), as the flux of the central bands could be enhanced by thepresence of [o iii] 4959, 5007 at redshift of about 0.93-1.14 and 1.57-1.79,respectively. the multi-band observations help to constrain the equivalentwidths of emission lines. thanks to cluster lensing, we are able to identify 52candidates down to an intrinsic limiting magnitude of 28.5 and to a rest-frame[o iii] 4959,5007 equivalent width of about 3737 angstrom. our samples includea number of eelgs at lower luminosities that are missed in other surveys, andthe extremely high equivalent width can be only found in such faint galaxies.these eelgs can mimic the dropout feature similar to that of high redshiftgalaxies and contaminate the color-color selection of high redshift galaxieswhen the s/n ratio is limited or the band coverage is incomplete. we predictthat the fraction of eelgs in the future high redshift galaxy selections cannotbe neglected.

0804.4175	the detection of a red sequence of massive field galaxies at z~2.3 and  its evolution to z~0	the existence of massive galaxies with strongly suppressed star formation atz~2.3, identified in a previous paper, suggests that a red sequence may alreadybe in place beyond z=2. in order to test this hypothesis, we study therest-frame u-b color distribution of massive galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;3. the sample isdrawn from our near-infrared spectroscopic survey for massive galaxies. thecolor distribution shows a statistically significant (&gt;3 sigma) red sequence,which hosts ~60% of the stellar mass at the high-mass end. the red-sequencegalaxies have little or no ongoing star formation, as inferred from bothemission-line diagnostics and stellar continuum shapes. their strong balmerbreaks and their location in the rest-frame u-b, b-v plane indicate that theyare in a post-starburst phase, with typical ages of ~0.5-1.0 gyr. in order tostudy the evolution of the red sequence, we compare our sample withspectroscopic massive galaxy samples at 0.02&lt;z&lt;0.045 and 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.0. therest-frame u-b color reddens by ~0.25 mag from z~2.3 to the present at a givenmass. over the same redshift interval, the number and stellar mass density onthe high-mass end (&gt;10^11 msol) of the red sequence grow by factors of ~8 and~6, respectively. we explore simple models to explain the observed evolution.passive evolution models predict too strong d(u-b), and produce z~0 galaxiesthat are too red. more complicated models that include aging, galaxytransformations, and red mergers can explain both the number density and colorevolution of the massive end of the red sequence between z~2.3 and the present.

0804.4228	spatially resolved stellar kinematics of field early-type galaxies at  z=1: evolution of the rotation rate	we use the spatial information of our previously published vlt/fors2absorption line spectroscopy to measure mean stellar velocity and velocitydispersion profiles of 25 field early-type galaxies at a median redshift z=0.97(full range 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.2). this provides the first detailed study of early-typegalaxy rotation at these redshifts. from surface brightness profiles from hstimaging we calculate two-integral oblate axisymmetric jeans equation models forthe observed kinematics. fits to the data yield for each galaxy the degree ofrotational support and the mass-to-light ratio m/l_jeans. s0 and sa galaxiesare generally rotationally supported, whereas elliptical galaxies rotate lessrapidly or not at all. down to m(b)=-19.5 (corrected for luminosity evolution),we find no evidence for evolution in the fraction of rotating early-type (e+s0)galaxies between z=1 (63+/-11%) and the present (61+/-5%). we interpret this asevidence for little or no change in the field s0 fraction with redshift. wecompare m/l_jeans with m/l_vir inferred from the virial theorem and globallyaveraged quantities and assuming homologous evolution. there is good agreementfor non-rotating (mostly e) galaxies. however, for rotationally supportedgalaxies (mostly s0) m/l_jeans is on average ~40% higher than m/l_vir. wediscuss possible explanations and the implications for the evolution of m/lbetween z=1 and the present and its dependence on mass.

1506.03085	forming compact massive galaxies	in this paper we study a key phase in the formation of massive galaxies: thetransition of star forming galaxies into massive (m_stars~10^11 msun), compact(r_e~1 kpc) quiescent galaxies, which takes place from z~3 to z~1.5. we use hstgrism redshifts and extensive photometry in all five 3d-hst/candels fields,more than doubling the area used previously for such studies, and combine thesedata with keck mosfire and nirspec spectroscopy. we first confirm that apopulation of massive, compact, star forming galaxies exists at z~2, usingk-band spectroscopy of 25 of these objects at 2.0&lt;z&lt;2.5. they have a mediannii/halpha ratio of 0.6, are highly obscured with sfr(tot)/sfr(halpha)~10, andhave a large range of observed line widths. we infer from the kinematics andspatial distribution of halpha that the galaxies have rotating disks of ionizedgas that are a factor of ~2 more extended than the stellar distribution. bycombining measurements of individual galaxies, we find that the kinematics areconsistent with a nearly keplerian fall-off from v_rot~500 km/s at 1 kpc tov_rot~250 km/s at 7 kpc, and that the total mass out to this radius isdominated by the dense stellar component. next, we study the size and massevolution of the progenitors of compact massive galaxies. even thoughindividual galaxies may have had complex histories with periods of compactionand mergers, we show that the population of progenitors likely followed asimple inside-out growth track in the size-mass plane of d(log r_e) ~ 0.3 d(logm_stars). this mode of growth gradually increases the stellar mass within afixed physical radius, and galaxies quench when they reach a stellar density orvelocity dispersion threshold. as shown in other studies, the mode of growthchanges after quenching, as dry mergers take the galaxies on a relatively steeptrack in the size-mass plane.

1507.03999	where stars form: inside-out growth and coherent star formation from hst  halpha maps of 2676 galaxies across the main sequence at z~1	we present ha maps at 1kpc spatial resolution for star-forming galaxies atz~1, made possible by the wfc3 grism on hst. employing this capability over allfive 3d-hst/candels fields provides a sample of 2676 galaxies. by creating deepstacked halpha (ha) images, we reach surface brightness limits of1x10^-18\erg\s\cm^2\arcsec^2, allowing us to map the distribution of ionizedgas out to &gt;10kpc for typical l* galaxies at this epoch. we find that thespatial extent of the ha distribution increases with stellar mass asr(ha)[kpc]=1.5(mstars/10^10msun)^0.23. furthermore, the ha emission is moreextended than the stellar continuum emission, consistent with inside-outassembly of galactic disks. this effect, however, is mass dependent withr(ha)/r(stars)=1.1(m/10^10msun)^0.054, such that at low masses r(ha)~r(stars).we map the ha distribution as a function of sfr(ir+uv) and find evidence for`coherent star formation' across the sfr-m plane: above the main sequence, hais enhanced at all radii; below the main sequence, ha is depressed at allradii. this suggests that at all masses the physical processes driving theenhancement or suppression of star formation act throughout the disks ofgalaxies. it also confirms that the scatter in the star forming main sequenceis real and caused by variations in the star formation rate at fixed mass. athigh masses (10^10.5&lt;m/msun&lt;10^11), above the main sequence, ha is particularlyenhanced in the center, plausibly building bulges and/or supermassive blackholes. below the main sequence, the star forming disks are more compact and astrong central dip in the ew(ha), and the inferred specific star formationrate, appears. importantly though, across the entirety of the sfr-m plane, theabsolute star formation rate as traced by ha is always centrally peaked, evenin galaxies below the main sequence.

1508.04771	galaxy structure as a driver of the star formation sequence slope and  scatter	it is well established that (1) star-forming galaxies follow a relationbetween their star formation rate (sfr) and stellar mass (m$_{\star}$), the"star-formation sequence", and (2) the sfrs of galaxies correlate with theirstructure, where star-forming galaxies are less concentrated than quiescentgalaxies at fixed mass. here, we consider whether the scatter and slope of thestar-formation sequence is correlated with systematic variations in the sersicindices, $n$, of galaxies across the sfr-m$_{\star}$ plane. we use amass-complete sample of 23,848 galaxies at $0.5&lt;z&lt;2.5$ selected from the 3d-hstphotometric catalogs. galaxy light profiles parameterized by $n$ are based onhubble space telescope candels near-infrared imaging. we use a single sfrindicator empirically-calibrated from stacks of spitzer/mips 24$\mu$m imaging,adding the unobscured and obscured star formation. we find that the scatter ofthe star-formation sequence is related in part to galaxy structure; the scatterdue to variations in $n$ at fixed mass for star-forming galaxies ranges from0.14$\pm$0.02 dex at $z\sim2$ to 0.30$\pm$0.04 dex at $z&lt;1$. while the slope ofthe log(sfr)-log(m$_{\star}$) relation is of order unity for disk-likegalaxies, galaxies with $n&gt;2$ (implying more dominant bulges) havesignificantly lower sfr/m$_{\star}$ than the main ridgeline of thestar-formation sequence. these results suggest that bulges in massive $z\sim2$galaxies are actively building up, where the stars in the central concentrationare relatively young. at $z&lt;1$, the presence of older bulges withinstar-forming galaxies lowers global sfr/m$_{\star}$, decreasing the slope andcontributing significantly to the scatter of the star-formation sequence.

(2014)photometric catalogs. the 2d spectra and the multi-band photometry were fitsimultaneously to determine redshifts and emission line strengths, taking themorphology of the galaxies explicitly into account. the resulting catalog has98,663 measured redshifts and line strengths down to $jh_{ir}\leq 26$ and22,548 with $jh_{ir}\leq 24$, where we comfortably detect continuum emission.of this sample 5,459 galaxies are at $z&gt;1.5$ and 9,621 are at $0.7&lt;z&lt;1.5$,where h$\alpha$ falls in the g141 wavelength coverage. based on comparisonswith ground-based spectroscopic redshifts, and on analyses of paired galaxiesand repeat observations, the typical redshift error for $jh_{ir}\leq 24$galaxies in our catalog is $\sigma_z \approx 0.003 \times (1+z)$, i.e., onenative wfc3 pixel. the $3\sigma$ limit for emission line fluxes of pointsources is $1.5\times10^{-17}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$. we show variousrepresentations of the full dataset, as well as individual examples thathighlight the range of spectra that we find in the survey.

0808.0077	recent structural evolution of early-type galaxies: size growth from z=1  to z=0	strong size and internal density evolution of early-type galaxies between z~2and the present has been reported by several authors. here we analyze samplesof nearby and distant (z~1) galaxies with dynamically measured masses in orderto confirm the previous, model-dependent results and constrain theuncertainties that may play a role. velocity dispersion measurements are takenfrom the literature for 50 morphologically selected 0.8&lt;z&lt;1.2 field and clusterearly-type galaxies with typical masses 2e11 msol. sizes are determined withacs imaging. we compare the distant sample with a large sample of nearby(0.04&lt;z&lt;0.08) early-type galaxies extracted from the sdss for which wedetermine sizes, masses, and densities in a consistent manner, usingsimulations to quantify systematic differences between the size measurements ofnearby and distant galaxies. we find a highly significant structural differencebetween the nearby and distant samples, regardless of sample selection effects.the implied evolution in size at fixed mass between z=1 and the present is afactor of 1.97(0.15). this is in qualitative agreement with semianalyticmodels; however, the observed evolution is much faster than the predictedevolution. our results reinforce and are quantitatively consistent withprevious, photometric studies that found size evolution of up to a factor of 5since z~2. a combination of structural evolution of individual galaxies throughthe accretion of companions and the continuous formation of early-type galaxiesthrough increasingly gas-poor mergers is one plausible explanation of theobservations.

astro-ph;0303166	spectroscopic confirmation of a substantial population of luminous red  galaxies at redshifts z&gt;2	we confirm spectroscopically the existence of a population of galaxies atz&gt;~2 with rest-frame optical colors similar to normal nearby galaxies. thegalaxies were identified by their red near-infrared colors in deep imagesobtained with isaac on the very large telescope. redshifts of six galaxies withjs-ks&gt;2.3 were measured from optical spectra obtained with the keck telescope.five out of six are in the range 2.43&lt;=z&lt;=3.52, demonstrating that the js-kscolor selection is quite efficient. the rest-frame ultraviolet spectra ofconfirmed z&gt;2 galaxies display a range of properties, with two galaxies showingemission lines characteristic of agn, two having ly-alpha in emission, and oneshowing interstellar absorption lines only. their full spectral energydistributions are well described by constant star formation models with ages1.4-2.6 gyr, except for one galaxy whose colors indicate a dusty starburst. theconfirmed z&gt;2 galaxies are very luminous, with ks=19.2-19.9. assuming that ourbright spectroscopic sample is representative for the general population ofjs-ks selected objects, we find that the surface density of red z&gt;~2 galaxiesis ~0.9/arcmin^2 to ks=21. the surface density is comparable to that oflyman-break selected galaxies with ks&lt;21, when corrections are made for thedifferent redshift distributions of the two samples. although there will besome overlap between the two populations, most 'optical-break' galaxies are toofaint in the rest-frame ultraviolet to be selected as lyman-break galaxies. themost straightforward interpretation is that star formation in typicaloptical-break galaxies started earlier than in typical lyman-break galaxies.optical-break galaxies may be the oldest and most massive galaxies yetidentified at z&gt;2, and could evolve into early-type galaxies and bulges.

astro-ph;0404471	stellar populations and kinematics of red galaxies at z&gt;2: implications  for the formation of massive galaxies	we recently identified a substantial population of galaxies at z&gt;2 with redrest-frame optical colors. these distant red galaxies (drgs) are efficientlyselected by the simple observed color criterion j-k&gt;2.3. in this paper wepresent nir spectroscopy with keck/nirspec of six drgs at 2.4&lt;z&lt;3.2. we detectcontinuum emission and emission lines of all observed galaxies. equivalentwidths of h alpha are 20-30 ang, smaller than measured for lbgs and nearbylirgs, and comparable to normal nearby galaxies. the modest equivalent widthsimply that the galaxies either have a decreasing star formation rate, or thatthey are very dusty. fitting both the photometry and the h alpha lines, we findcontinuum extinction a_v=1-2 mag, ages 1-2.5 gyr, star formation rates 200-400solar masses/yr, and stellar masses 1-5x10^11 solar masses for models withconstant star formation rates. from [nii]/h alpha ratios we infer that themetallicities are high, 1-1.5 x solar. for four galaxies we can determine linewidths from the optical emission lines. the widths are high, ranging from130-240 km/s, and by combining data for lbgs and drgs we find significantcorrelations between linewidth and restframe u-v color, and between linewidthand stellar mass. the latter correlation has a similar slope and offset as the``baryonic tully-fisher relation'' for nearby galaxies. the median dynamicalmass is ~2x10^11 solar masses, supporting the high stellar masses inferred fromthe photometry. we find that the median m/l_v ~ 0.8, a factor of ~5 higher thanmeasured for lbgs. we infer from our small sample that drgs are dustier, moremetal rich, more massive, and have higher ages than z=3 lbgs of the samerest-frame v-band luminosity. their high m/l ratios imply that they contributesignificantly to the stellar mass density at z~2.5.

astro-ph;0504225	the size evolution of galaxies since z~3: combining sdss, gems and fires	we present the evolution of the luminosity-size and stellar mass-sizerelations of luminous (l_v&gt;3.4x10^10h_70^-2l_sun) and of massive(m_*&gt;3x10^10h_70^-2m_sun) galaxies in the last ~11 gyr. we use very deepnear-infrared images of the hubble deep field-south and the ms1054-03 field inthe j_s, h and k_s bands from fires to retrieve the sizes in the opticalrest-frame for galaxies with z&gt;1. we combine our results with those from gemsat 0.2&lt;z&lt;1 and sdss at z~0.1 to achieve a comprehensive picture of the opticalrest-frame size evolution from z=0 to z=3. galaxies are differentiatedaccording to their light concentration using the sersic index n. for lessconcentrated objects, the galaxies at a given luminosity were typically ~3+-0.5(+-2 sigma) times smaller at z~2.5 than those we see today. the stellarmass-size relation has evolved less: the mean size at a given stellar mass was\~2+-0.5 times smaller at z~2.5, evolving proportional to (1+z)^{-0.40+-0.06}.simple scaling relations between dark matter halos and baryons in ahierarchical cosmogony predict a stronger (although consistent within the errorbars) than observed evolution of the stellar mass-size relation. the observedluminosity-size evolution out to z~2.5 matches well recent infall modelpredictions for milky-way type objects. for low-n galaxies, the evolution ofthe stellar mass-size relation would follow naturally if the individualgalaxies grow inside-out. for highly concentrated objects, the situation is asfollows: at a given luminosity, these galaxies were ~2.7+-1.1 times smaller atz~2.5 (or put differently, were typically ~2.2+-0.7 mag brighter at a givensize than they are today), and at a given stellar mass the size has evolvedproportional to (1+z)^{-0.45+-0.10}.

astro-ph;0606536	measuring the average evolution of luminous galaxies at z&lt;3: the  rest-frame optical luminosity density, spectral energy distribution, and  stellar mass density	(abridged) we present the evolution of the volume averaged properties of therest-frame optically luminous galaxy population to z~3, determined from fourdisjoint deep fields with optical to near-infrared wavelength coverage. weselect galaxies above a rest-frame v-band luminosity of 3x10^10 lsol andcharacterize their rest-frame uv through optical properties via the meanspectral energy distribution (sed). to measure evolution we apply the sameselection criteria to a sample of galaxies from the sloan digital sky surveyand combo-17. the mean rest-frame 2200ang through v-band sed becomes steadilybluer with increasing redshift but at z&lt;3 the mean sed falls within the rangedefined by ``normal'' galaxies in the nearby universe. we measure stellarmass-to-light ratios (mstar/l) by fitting models to the rest-frame uv-opticalseds and derive the stellar mass density. the stellar mass density in luminousgalaxies has increased by a factor of 3.5-7.9 from z=3 to z=0.1, includingfield-to-field variance uncertainties. after correcting to total, the measuredmass densities at z&lt;2 lie below the integral of the star formation rate (sfr)density as a function of redshift as derived from uv selected samples. this mayindicate a systematic error in the mass densities or sfr(z) estimates. we findlarge discrepancies between recent model predictions for the evolution of themass density and our results, even when our observational selection is appliedto the models. finally we determine that distant red galaxies (selected to havej_s - k_s&gt;2.3) in our lv selected samples contribute 30% and 64% of the stellarmass budget at z~2 and z~ 2.8 respectively. these galaxies are largely absentfrom uv surveys and this result highlights the need for mass selection of highredshift galaxies.

astro-ph;0607649	comparing dynamical and photometric mass estimates of low- and  high-redshift galaxies: random and systematic uncertainties	we determine the importance of redshift-dependent systematic effects in thedetermination of stellar masses from broad band spectral energy distributions(seds), using high quality kinematic and photometric data of early-typegalaxies at z~1 and z~0. we find that photometric masses of z~1 galaxies can besystematically different, by up to a factor of 2, from photometric masses ofz~0 galaxies with the same dynamical mass. the magnitude of this bias dependson the choice of stellar population synthesis model and the rest-framewavelength range used in the fits. the best result, i.e., without significantbias, is obtained when rest-frame optical seds are fitted with models frombruzual&amp;charlot (2003). when the seds are extended to the rest-frame near-ir, abias is introduced: photometric masses of the z~1 galaxies increase by a factorof 2 relative to the photometric masses of the z~0 galaxies. when we use themaraston (2005) models, the photometric masses of the z~1 galaxies are lowrelative to the photometric masses of the z~0 galaxies by a factor of ~1.8.this offset occurs both for fits based on rest-frame optical seds, and fitsbased on rest-frame optical+near-ir seds. the results indicate that modeluncertainties produce uncertainties as high as a factor of 2.5 in massestimates from rest-frame near-ir photometry, independent of uncertainties dueto unknown star formation histories.

0810.1917	evolution of the color-magnitude relation in galaxy clusters at z ~1  from the acs intermediate redshift cluster survey	we apply detailed observations of the color-magnitude relation (cmr) with theacs/hst to study galaxy evolution in eight clusters at z~1. the early-type redsequence is well defined and elliptical and lenticular galaxies lie on similarcmrs. we analyze cmr parameters as a function of redshift, galaxy propertiesand cluster mass. for bright galaxies (m_b &lt; -21mag), the cmr scatter of theelliptical population in cluster cores is smaller than that of the s0population, although the two become similar at faint magnitudes. while thebright s0 population consistently shows larger scatter than the ellipticals,the scatter of the latter increases in the peripheral cluster regions. if weinterpret these results as due to age differences, bright elliptical galaxiesin cluster cores are on average older than s0 galaxies and peripheralelliptical galaxies (by about 0.5gyr). cmr zero point, slope, and scatter inthe (u-b)_z=0 rest-frame show no significant evolution out to redshift z~1.3nor significant dependence on cluster mass. two of our clusters display cmrzero points that are redder (by ~2sigma) than the average (u-b)_z=0 of oursample. we also analyze the fraction of morphological early-type and late-typegalaxies on the red sequence. we find that, while in the majority of theclusters most (80% to 90%) of the cmr population is composed of early-typegalaxies, in the highest redshift, low mass cluster of our sample, the cmrlate-type/early-type fractions are similar (~50%), with most of the late-typepopulation composed of galaxies classified as s0/a. this trend is notcorrelated with the cluster's x-ray luminosity, nor with its velocitydispersion, and could be a real evolution with redshift.

0812.2021	a wide-field study of the z~0.8 cluster rx j0152.7-1357: the role of  environment in the formation of the red-sequence	[abridged] we present the first results from the largest spectroscopic surveyto date of an intermediate redshift galaxy cluster, the z=0.834 cluster rxj0152.7-1357. we use the colors of galaxies, assembled from a d~12 mpc regioncentered on the cluster, to investigate the properties of the red-sequence as afunction of density and clustercentric radius. our wide-field multi-slit surveywith a low-dispersion prism in the imacs spectrograph at magellan allowed us toidentify 475 new members of the cluster and its surrounding large scalestructure with a redshift accuracy of dz/(1+z)~1% and a contamination rate of~2% for galaxies with i&lt;23.75 mag. we combine these new members with the 279previously known spectroscopic members to give a total of 754 galaxies fromwhich we obtain a mass-limited sample of 300 galaxies with stellar massesm&gt;4x10^{10} m_sun. we find that the red galaxy fraction is 93+/-3% in the twomerging cores of the cluster and declines to a level of 64+/-3% at projectedclustercentric radii r&gt;~3 mpc. at these large projected distances, thecorrelation between clustercentric radius and local density is nonexistent.this allows an assessment of the influence of the local environment on galaxyevolution, as opposed to mechanisms that operate on cluster scales. even beyondr&gt;3 mpc we find an increasing fraction of red galaxies with increasing localdensity. the red fraction at the highest local densities in two groups at r&gt;3mpc matches the red fraction found in the two cores. strikingly, galaxies atintermediate densities at r&gt;3 mpc, that are not group members, also show signsof an enhanced red fraction. our results point to such intermediate densityregions and the groups in the outskirts of the cluster, as sites where thelocal environment influences the transition of galaxies onto the red-sequence.
