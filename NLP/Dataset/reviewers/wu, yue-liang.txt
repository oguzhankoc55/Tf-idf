hep-th;0402175	conformal scaling gauge symmetry and inflationary universe	considering the conformal scaling gauge symmetry as a fundamental symmetry ofnature in the presence of gravity, a scalar field is required and used todescribe the scale behavior of universe. in order for the scalar field to be aphysical field, a gauge field is necessary to be introduced. a gauge invariantpotential action is constructed by adopting the scalar field and a realwilson-like line element of the gauge field. of particular, the conformalscaling gauge symmetry can be broken down explicitly via fixing gauge to matchthe einstein-hilbert action of gravity. as a nontrivial background fieldsolution of pure gauge has a minimal energy in gauge interactions, theevolution of universe is then dominated at earlier time by the potential energyof background field characterized by a scalar field. since the background fieldof pure gauge leads to an exponential potential model of a scalar field, theuniverse is driven by a power-law inflation with the scale factor $a(t) \simt^p$. the power-law index $p$ is determined by a basic gauge fixing parameter$g_f$ via $p = 16\pi g_f^2[1 + 3/(4\pi g_f^2) ]$. for the gauge fixing scalebeing the planck mass, we are led to a predictive model with $g_f=1$ and$p\simeq 62$.

1001.0307	exploration of decaying dark matter in a left-right symmetric model	$su(2)_l$ triplet scalars appear in models motivated for the left-rightsymmetry, neutrino masses and dark matter (dm), etc.. if the triplets are themain decay products of the dm particle, and carry nonzero lepton numbers, theymay decay dominantly into lepton pairs, which can naturally explain the currentexperimental results reported by pamela and fermi-lat or atic. we discuss thispossibility in an extended left-right symmetric model in which the decay of dmparticle is induced by tiny soft charge-conjugation ($c$) violatinginteractions, and calculate the spectra for cosmic-ray positrons, neutrinos andgamma-rays. we show that the dm signals in the flux of high energy neutrinoscan be significantly enhanced, as the triplets couple to both charged leptonsand neutrinos with the same strength. in this scenario, the predictedneutrino-induced muon flux can be several times larger than the case in whichdm particle only directly decays into charged leptons. in addition, the chargedcomponents of the triplet may give an extra contribution to the high energygamma-rays through internal bremsstrahlung process, which depends on the masshierarchy between the dm particle and the triplet scalars.

1108.3603	consistency and advantage of loop regularization method merging with  bjorken-drell's analogy between feynman diagrams and electrical circuits	the consistency of loop regularization (lore) method is explored in multiloopcalculations. a key concept of the lore method is the introduction ofirreducible loop integrals (ilis) which are evaluated from the feynman diagramsby adopting the feynman parametrization andultraviolet-divergence-preserving(uvdp) parametrization. it is then inevitablefor the ilis to encounter the divergences in the uvdp parameter space due tothe generic overlapping divergences in the 4-dimensional momentum space. bycomputing the so-called $\alpha\beta\gamma$ integrals arising from two loopfeynman diagrams, we show how to deal with the divergences in the parameterspace with the lore method. by identifying the divergences in the uvdpparameter space to those in the subdiagrams, we arrive at the bjorken-drell'sanalogy between feynman diagrams and electrical circuits. the uvdp parametersare shown to correspond to the conductance or resistance in the electricalcircuits, and the divergence in feynman diagrams is ascribed to the infiniteconductance or zero resistance. in particular, the sets of conditions requiredto eliminate the overlapping momentum integrals for obtaining the ilis arefound to be associated with the conservations of electric voltages, and themomentum conservations correspond to the conservations of electrical currents,which are known as the kirchhoff's laws in the electrical circuits analogy. asan application to the massive scalar $\phi^4$ theory, it enables us to obtainthe well-known logarithmic running of the coupling constant and the consistentpower-law running of the scalar mass at two loop level. especially, we presentan explicit demonstration on the general procedure of applying the lore methodto the multiloop calculations of feynman diagrams when merging with theadvantage of bjorken-drell's circuit analogy.

1205.0608	analysis on a general class of holographic type dark energy models	we present a detail analysis on a general class of holographic type darkenergy models characterized by the length scale $l=\frac1{a^n(t)}\int_0^t dt'a^m(t')$. we show that $n \geq 0$ is required by the recent cosmic acceleratedexpansion of universe. in the early universe dominated by the constituent withconstant equation of state $w_m$, we have $w_{de}\simeq -1-\frac{2n}{3}$ for $n\geq 0$ and $m&lt;0$, and $w_{de}\simeq-\frac23(n-m)+w_m$ for $n &gt; m \geq 0$. themodels with $n &gt; m \geq 0$ become single-parameter models like the $\lambda$cdmmodel due to the analytic feature $\omega_{de}\simeq\frac{d^2}4(2m+3w_m+3)^2a^{2(n-m)}$ at radiation- and matter-dominated epoch.whereas the cases $n=m\geq 0$ should be abandoned as the dark energy cannotdominate the universe forever and there might be too large fraction of darkenergy in early universe, and the cases $m&gt; n \geq 0$ are forbidden by theself-consistent requirement $\omega_{de}\ll1 $ in the early universe. thus adetailed study on the single-parameter models corresponding to cases $n &gt;m \geq0$ is carried out by using recent observations. the best-fit analysis indicatesthat the conformal-age-like models with $n=m+1$, i.e. $l\propto\frac1{ha}$ inearly universe, are more favored and also the models with smaller $n$ for thegiven $n-m$ are found to fit the observations better. the equation of state ofthe dark energy in models with $n=m+1 &gt;0$ transits from $w_{de}&lt;-1$ duringinflation to $w_{de}&gt;-1$ in radiation- and matter-dominated epoch, and thenback to $w_{de}&lt;-1$ eventually. the best-fit result of the case $(n=0, m=-1)$which is so-called $\eta$hde model proposed in \cite{huang:2012xm} is the mostfavorable model and compatible with the $\lambda$cdm model.

1305.0912	direct detection and solar capture of dark matter with momentum and  velocity dependent elastic scattering	we explore the momentum and velocity dependent elastic scattering between thedark matter (dm) particles and the nuclei in detectors and the sun. in terms ofthe non-relativistic effective theory, we phenomenologically discuss ten kindsof momentum and velocity dependent dm-nucleus interactions and recalculate thecorresponding upper limits on the spin-independent dm-nucleon scattering crosssection from the current direct detection experiments. the dm solar capturerate is calculated for each interaction. our numerical results show that themomentum and velocity dependent cases can give larger solar capture rate thanthe usual contact interaction case for almost the whole parameter space. on theother hand, we deduce the super-kamiokande's constraints on the solar capturerate for eight typical dm annihilation channels. in contrast to the usualcontact interaction, the super-kamiokande and icecube experiments can give morestringent limits on the dm-nucleon elastic scattering cross section than thecurrent direct detection experiments for several momentum and velocitydependent dm-nucleus interactions. in addition, we investigate the mediatormass's effect on the dm elastic scattering cross section and solar capturerate.

1305.5438	sommerfeld enhancements with vector, scalar and pseudoscalar  force-carriers	the first ams-02 measurement confirms the existence of an excess in thecosmic-ray positron fraction previously reported by the pamela and fermi-latexperiments. if interpreted in terms of thermal dark matter (dm) annihilation,the ams-02 result still suggests that the dm annihilation cross section in thepresent day should be significantly larger than that at freeze out. thesommerfeld enhancement of dm annihilation cross section as a possibleexplanation for the observed excesses is subject to constraint from the dmthermal relic density, mainly due to the annihilation of dm particles intoforce-carrier particles introduced by the mechanism. we show that the effect ofthe sommerfeld enhancement and the relic density constraint dependsignificantly on the nature of the force-carrier. three cases where theforce-carrier is a vector boson, scalar and pseudoscalar particle areinvestigated and compared with each other. the results show that for the vectorforce-carrier, the sommerfeld enhancement can marginally account for the ams-02data for $2\mu$ final states, while for scalar force-carrier the allowedsommerfeld enhancement can be larger by a factor of two. for the case with apesudoscalar force-carrier, the sommerfeld enhancement can be large enough toaccommodate the ams-02 and fermi-lat result for a variety of dm annihilationfinal states.

1312.1403	quantum structure of field theory and standard model based on  infinity-free loop regularization/renormalization	to understand better the quantum structure of field theory and standard modelin particle physics, it is necessary to investigate carefully the divergencestructure in quantum field theories (qfts) and work out a consistent frameworkto avoid infinities. the divergence has got us into trouble since developingquantum electrodynamics in 1930s, its treatment via the renormalization schemeis satisfied not by all physicists, like dirac and feynman who have madeserious criticisms. the renormalization group analysis reveals that qfts can ingeneral be defined fundamentally with the meaningful energy scale that has somephysical significance, which motivates us to develop a new symmetry-preservingand infinity-free regularization scheme called loop regularization (lore). asimple regularization prescription in lore is realized based on a manifestpostulation that a loop divergence with a power counting dimension larger thanor equal to the space-time dimension must vanish. the lore method is achievedwithout modifying original theory and leads the divergent feynman loopintegrals well-defined to maintain the divergence structure and meanwhilepreserve basic symmetries of original theory. the crucial point in lore is thepresence of two intrinsic energy scales which play the roles of ultravioletcut-off $m_c$ and infrared cut-off $\mu_s$ to avoid infinities. the key conceptin lore is the introduction of irreducible loop integrals (ilis) on which theregularization prescription acts, which leads to a set of gauge invarianceconsistency conditions between the regularized tensor-type and scalar-typeilis. the evaluation of ilis with ultraviolet-divergence-preserving (uvdp)parametrization naturally leads to bjorken-drell's analogy between feynmandiagrams and electric circuits. the lore method has been shown to be applicableto both underlying and effective qfts.

1403.2440	leptonic cp violation and wolfenstein parametrization for lepton mixing	we investigate a general structure of lepton mixing matrix resulting from thesu$_f$(3) gauge family model with an appropriate vacuum structure of su$_f$(3)symmetry breaking. it is shown that the lepton mixing matrix can beparametrized by using the wolfenstein parametrization method to characterizeits deviation from the tri-bimaximal mixing. a general analysis for the allowedleptonic cp-violating phase $\delta_e$ and the leptonic wolfenstein parameters$\lambda_e$, $a_e$, $\rho_e$ is carried out based on the observed lepton mixingangles. we demonstrate how the leptonic cp violation correlates to the leptonicwolfenstein parameters. it is found that the phase $\delta_e$ is stronglyconstrained and only a large or nearly maximal leptonic cp-violating phase$|\delta_e| \simeq 3\pi/4 \sim \pi/2$ is favorable when $\lambda_e &gt; 0.15 $. inparticular, when taking $\lambda_e$ to be the cabbibo angle $\gl_e\simeq\lambda \simeq 0.225$, a sensible result for leptonic wolfenstein parametersand cp violation is obtained with $ a_e=1.40$, $\rho_e=0.20$, $\delta_{e}\sim101.76\;^o$, which is compatible with the one in quark sector. an interestingcorrelation between leptons and quarks is observed, which indicates a possiblecommon origin of masses and mixing for the charged-leptons and quarks.

0705.1575	qcd approach to b-&gt;d \pi decays and cp violation	the branching ratios and cp violations of the $b\to d\pi$ decays, includingboth the color-allowed and the color-suppressed modes, are investigated indetail within qcd framework by considering all diagrams which lead to threeeffective currents of two quarks. an intrinsic mass scale as a dynamical gluonmass is introduced to treat the infrared divergence caused by the softcollinear approximation in the endpoint regions, and the cutkosky rule isadopted to deal with a physical-region singularity of the on mass-shell quarkpropagators. when the dynamical gluon mass $\mu_g$ is regarded as a universalscale, it is extracted to be around $\mu_g = 440$ mev from one of thewell-measured $b\to d\pi$ decay modes. the resulting predictions for allbranching ratios are in agreement with the current experimental measurements.as these decays have no penguin contributions, there are no direct $cp$asymmetries. due to interference between the cabibbo-suppressed and thecabibbo-favored amplitudes, mixing-induced cp violations are predicted in the$b\to d^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}$ decays to be consistent with the experimental data at1-$\sigma$ level. more precise measurements will be helpful to extract weakangle $2\beta+\gamma$.

1412.3562	quantum electroweak symmetry breaking through loop quadratic  contributions	based on two postulations that (i) the higgs boson has a large bare mass $m_h\gg m_h \simeq 125 $ gev at the characteristic energy scale $m_c$ which definesthe standard model (sm) in the ultraviolet region, and (ii) quadraticcontributions of feynman loop diagrams in quantum field theories are physicallymeaningful, we show that the sm electroweak symmetry breaking is induced by thequadratic contributions from loop effects. as the quadratic running of higgsmass parameter leads to an additive renormalization, which distinguishes fromthe logarithmic running with a multiplicative renormalization, the symmetrybreaking occurs once the sliding energy scale $\mu$ moves from $m_c$ down to atransition scale $\mu =\lambda_{ew}$ at which the additive renormalized higgsmass parameter $m^2_h(m_c/\mu)$ gets to change the sign. with the input ofcurrent experimental data, this symmetry breaking energy scale is found to be$\lambda_{ew}\simeq 760$ gev, which provides another basic energy scale for thesm besides $m_c$. studying such a symmetry breaking mechanism could play animportant role in understanding both the hierarchy problem and naturalnessproblem. it also provides a possible way to explore the experimentalimplications of the quadratic contributions as $\lambda_{ew}$ lies within theprobing reach of the lhc and the future great collider.

1510.04720	theory of quantum gravity beyond einstein and space-time dynamics with  quantum inflation	in this talk, i present a theory of quantum gravity beyond einstein. thetheory is established based on spinnic and scaling gauge symmetries by treatingthe gravitational force on the same footing as the electroweak and strongforces. a bi-frame space-time is initiated to describe the laws of nature. oneframe space-time is a globally flat coordinate minkowski space-time that actsas an inertial reference frame for the motions of fields, the other is alocally flat non-coordinate gravifield space-time that functions as aninteraction representation frame for the degrees of freedom of fields. thegravifield is sided on both the globally flat coordinate space-time and locallyflat non-coordinate space-time and characterizes the gravitational force.instead of the principle of general coordinate invariance in einstein theory ofgeneral relativity, some underlying principles with the postulates ofcoordinate independence and gauge invariance are motivated to establish thetheory of quantum gravity. when transmuting the gravifield basis into thecoordinate basis in minkowski space-time, it enables us to obtain equations ofmotion for all quantum fields and derive basic conservation laws for allsymmetries. when the spinnic and scaling gauge symmetries are broken down to abackground structure that possesses the global lorentz and scaling symmetries,we arrive at a lorentz invariant and conformally flat background gravifieldspace-time that is characterized by a cosmic vector with a non-zerocosmological mass scale. we also obtain the massless graviton and massivespinnon. we show a mechanism for quantum inflation caused by the quantum loopcontributions. the einstein theory of general relativity is expected to be aneffective low energy theory. two types of gravity equation are resulted.

hep-ph;0210367	isospin relation and su(3) breaking effects of strong phases in  charmless b decays	isospin and flavor su(3) relations in charmless hadronic b decays $b\to \pi\pi, \pi k$ are investigated in detail with paying attention to the su(3)symmetry breaking effects in both amplitudes and strong phases. in general, theisospin and the flavor su(3) structure of the effective hamiltonian provideseveral relations among the amplitudes and strong phases. whereas a global fitto the latest data shows that some relation seems not to be favorable for aconsistent explanation to the current data within the standard model (sm). byconsidering several patterns of su(3) breaking, the amplitudes and thecorresponding strong phases are extracted and compared with the theoreticalestimations. it is found that in the case of su(3) limits and also the casewith su(3) breaking only in amplitudes, the fitting results lead to anunexpected large ratio between two isospin amplitudes$a^{c}_{3/2}/a^{u}_{3/2}$, which is about an order of magnitude larger than thesm prediction. the results are found to be insensitive to the weak phase$\gamma$. by including su(3) breaking effects on the strong phases, one is ableto obtain a consistent fit to the current data within the sm, which impliesthat the su(3) breaking effect on strong phases may play an important role inunderstanding the observed charmless hadronic b decay modes $b\to \pi \pi$ and$\pi k$. it is possible to test those breaking effects in the near future frommore precise measurements of direct cp violation in b factories.

hep-ph;0403252	cp asymmetry in $b \to \phi k_s$ in a general two-higgs-doublet model  with fourth-generation quarks	we discuss the time-dependent cp asymmetry of decay $b \to \phi k_s$ in anextension of the standard model with both two higgs doublets and additionalfourth-generation quarks. we show that although the standard model withtwo-higgs-doublet and the standard model with fourth generation quarks aloneare not likely to largely change the effective $\sin 2 \beta$ from the decay of$b \to \phi k_s $, the model with both additional higgs doublet andfourth-generation quarks can easily account for the possible large negativevalue of $\sin 2 \beta$ without conflicting with other experimentalconstraints. in this model, additional large cp violating effects may arisefrom the flavor changing yukawa interactions between neutral higgs bosons andthe heavy fourth generation down type quark, which can modify the qcd penguincontributions. with the constraints obtained from $b \to s \bar{s} s$ processessuch as $b \to x_s \gamma$ and $\delta m_{b_s^0}$, this model can lead to theeffective $\sin 2 \beta$ to be as large as $- 0.4$ in the cp asymmetry of $b\to \phi k_s$.

hep-ph;0409221	implications of charmless b decays with large direct cp violation	based on the most recent data in charmless b decays including the veryrecently reported large direct cp violations, it is shown that the weak phasegamma can well be extracted without two-fold ambiguity even only from two decaymodes pi^+pi^- and pi^+k^-, and its value is remarkably consistent with theglobal standard model fit at a compatible accuracy. a fit to all the pi pi, pik data favor both large electroweak penguin and color-suppressed tree amplitudewith large strong phases. it is demonstrated that the inclusion of smallsu(3)symmetry breaking effects of strong phases and the inelastic rescatteringeffects can well improve the consistency of the data, while both effects maynot be sufficient to arrive at a small electroweak penguin amplitude in thestandard model. it is of interest to notice that large or small electroweakpenguin amplitude becomes a testable prediction as they lead to significantlydifferent predictions for the direct cp violations for pi^0 pi^0, pi^0 k^0modes. clearly, precise measurements on charmless b decays will provide awindow for probing new physics.

hep-ph;0509083	anomaly and anomaly-free treatment of qfts based on symmetry-preserving  loop regularization	the triangle anomaly in massless and massive qed is investigated by adoptingthe symmetry-preserving loop regularization method proposed recently in\cite{lr}. the method is realized in the initial dimension of theory withoutmodifying the original lagrangian, it preserves symmetries under non-abeliangauge and poincare transformations in spite of the existence of two intrinsicmass scales $m_c$ and $\mu_s$ which actually play the roles of uv- and ir-cutoff respectively. the axialvector-vector-vector (avv) triangle diagrams inmassless and massive qed are evaluated explicitly by using the loopregularization. it is shown that when the momentum $k$ of external state issoft with $k^2 \ll \mu_s^2, m^2 $ ($m$ is the mass of loop fermions) and $ m_c\to \infty$, both massless and massive qed become anomaly free. the triangleanomaly is found to appear as quantum corrections in the case that $ m^2,\mu_s^2 \ll k^2 $ and $m_c \to \infty$. especially, it is justified that in themassless qed with $\mu_s =0$ and $m_c\to \infty$, the triangle anomalynaturally exists as quantum effects in the axial-vector current when theambiguity caused by the trace of gamma matrices with $\gamma_5$ is eliminatedby simply using the definition of $\gamma_5$. it is explicitly demonstrated howthe ward identity anomaly of currents depends on the treatment for the trace ofgamma matrices, which enables us to make a clarification whether the ambiguityof triangle anomaly is caused by the regularization scheme in the perturbationcalculations or by the trace of gamma matrices with $\gamma_5$.

hep-ph;0606035	signal of new physics and test of isospin-su(3) relations and cp  violation in charmless b decays	a model-independent analytical analysis for charmless b decays is presented.it is demonstrated that the cp-averaging branching ratio difference $\delta r =r_c - r_n$ in $b\to \pi k$ decays with $r_c = 2br(\pi^0k^-)/br(\pi^-\bar{k}^0)$and $r_n =br(\pi^+k^-)/2br(\pi^0\bar{k}^0)$ defines a sensitive quantity forprobing new physics as $\delta r$ is dominated by the second order ofelectroweak penguin contributions. a large discrepancy between experimentaldata and standard model (sm) prediction $\delta r^{exp}/\delta r^{sm} &gt; 9.0\pm5.0$ strongly indicates a signal of new physics in the electroweak penguinsector. within the sm, the current $\pi k$ data favor a very largecolor-suppressed tree amplitude $|c'/t'|\sim 2$, large cp violations($a_{cp}(\pi^0\bar{k}^0)\sim 0.69$ and $a_{cp}(\pi^0\bar{k}^-)\sim 0.56$),which is connected to $\delta r$ and be solved simultaneously with extraelectroweak penguin contributions. more accurate measurements on the ratiodifference $\delta r$ and cp violation in $b\to \pi \pi, \pi k$ decays mayprovide a window for probing new physics and testing the isospin and su(3)symmetries.
