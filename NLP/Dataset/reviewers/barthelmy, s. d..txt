0904.0261	looking into the fireball: rotse-iii and swift observations of early grb  afterglows	we report on a complete set of early optical afterglows of gamma-ray bursts(grbs) obtained with the rotse-iii telescope network from march 2005 throughjune 2007. this set is comprised of 12 afterglows with early optical andswift/xrt observations, with a median rotse-iii response time of 45 s after thestart of gamma-ray emission (8 s after the gcn notice time). these afterglowsspan four orders of magnitude in optical luminosity, and the contemporaneousx-ray detections allow multi-wavelength spectral analysis. excluding x-rayflares, the broadband synchrotron spectra show that the optical and x-rayemission originate in a common region, consistent with predictions of theexternal forward shock in the fireball model. however, the fireball model isinadequate to predict the temporal decay indices of the early afterglows, evenafter accounting for possible long-duration continuous energy injection. wefind that the optical afterglow is a clean tracer of the forward shock, and weuse the peak time of the forward shock to estimate the initial bulk lorentzfactor of the grb outflow, and find 100&lt;gamma_0&lt;1000, consistent withexpectations.

0908.1335	testing the epeak - eiso relation for grbs detected by swift and  suzaku-wam	one of the most prominent, yet controversial associations derived from theensemble of prompt-phase observations of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) is theapparent correlation in the source frame between the peak energy epeak) of thenu-f(nu) spectrum and the isotropic radiated energy, eiso. since most gamma-raybursts (grbs) have epeak above the energy range (15-150 kev) of the burst alerttelescope (bat) on swift, determining accurate epeak values for large numbersof swift bursts has been difficult. however, by combining data from swift/batand the suzaku wide-band all-sky monitor (wam), which covers the energy rangefrom 50-5000 kev, for bursts which are simultaneously detected, one canaccurately fit epeak and eiso and test the relationship between them for theswift sample. between the launch of suzaku in july 2005 and the end of april2009, there were 48 gamma-ray bursts (grbs) which triggered both swift/bat andwam and an additional 48 bursts which triggered swift and were detected by wam,but did not trigger. a bat-wam team has cross-calibrated the two instrumentsusing grbs, and we are now able to perform joint fits on these bursts todetermine their spectral parameters. for those bursts with spectroscopicredshifts, we can also calculate the isotropic energy. here we present theresults of joint swift/bat-suzaku/wam spectral fits for 91 of the burstsdetected by the two instruments. we show that the distribution of spectral fitparameters is consistent with distributions from earlier missions and confirmthat swift bursts are consistent with earlier reported relationships betweenepeak and isotropic energy. we show through time-resolved spectroscopy thatindividual burst pulses are also consistent with this relationship.

0908.2370	spectral lags and the lag-luminosity relation: an investigation with  swift bat gamma-ray bursts	spectral lag, the time difference between the arrival of high-energy andlow-energy photons, is a common feature in gamma-ray bursts (grbs). norris etal. 2000 reported a correlation between the spectral lag and the isotropic peakluminosity of grbs based on a limited sample. more recently, a number ofauthors have provided further support for this correlation using arbitraryenergy bands of various instruments. in this paper we report on a systematicextraction of spectral lags based on the largest swift sample to date of 31grbs with measured redshifts. we extracted the spectral lags for allcombinations of the standard swift hard x-ray energy bands: 15-25 kev, 25-50kev, 50-100 kev and 100-200 kev and plotted the time dilation corrected lag asa function of isotropic peak luminosity. the mean value of the correlationcoefficient for various channel combinations is -0.68 with a chance probabilityof ~ 0.7 x 10^{-3}. in addition, the mean value of the power-law index is 1.4+/- 0.3. hence, our study lends support for the existence of a lag-luminositycorrelation, albeit with large scatter.

0908.2817	a relativistic type ibc supernova without a detected gamma-ray burst	long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) mark the explosive death of somemassive stars and are a rare sub-class of type ibc supernovae (sne ibc). theyare distinguished by the production of an energetic and collimated relativisticoutflow powered by a central engine (an accreting black hole or neutron star).observationally, this outflow is manifested in the pulse of gamma-rays and along-lived radio afterglow. to date, central engine-driven sne have beendiscovered exclusively through their gamma-ray emission, yet it is expectedthat a larger population goes undetected due to limited satellite sensitivityor beaming of the collimated emission away from our line-of-sight. in thisframework, the recovery of undetected grbs may be possible through radiosearches for sne ibc with relativistic outflows. here we report the discoveryof luminous radio emission from the seemingly ordinary type ibc sn 2009bb,which requires a substantial relativistic outflow powered by a central engine.the lack of a coincident grb makes sn 2009bb the first engine-driven sndiscovered without a detected gamma-ray signal. a comparison with our extensiveradio survey of sne ibc reveals that the fraction harboring central engines islow, ~1 percent, measured independently from, but consistent with, the inferredrate of nearby grbs. our study demonstrates that upcoming optical and radiosurveys will soon rival gamma-ray satellites in pinpointing the nearestengine-driven sne. a similar result for a different supernova is reportedindependently.

0908.2818	the high-metallicity explosion environment of the relativistic supernova  2009bb	we investigate the environment of the nearby (d ~ 40mpc) broad-lined type icsupernova sn 2009bb. this event was observed to produce a relativistic outflowlikely powered by a central accreting compact object. while such a phenomenonwas previously observed only in long-duration gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs), no lgrbwas detected in association with sn 2009bb. using an optical spectrum of the sn2009bb explosion site, we determine a variety of ism properties for the hostenvironment, including metallicity, young stellar population age, and starformation rate. we compare the sn explosion site properties to observations oflgrb and broad-lined sn ic host environments on optical emission line ratiodiagnostic diagrams. based on these analyses, we find that the sn 2009bbexplosion site has a very high metallicity of ~2x solar, in agreement withother broad-lined sn ic host environments and at odds with the low-redshiftlgrb host environments and recently proposed maximum metallicity limits forrelativistic explosions. we consider the implications of these findings and theimpact that sn 2009bb's unusual explosive properties and environment have onour understanding of the key physical ingredient that enables some sne toproduce a relativistic outflow.

0910.3166	grb081028 and its late-time afterglow re-brightening	swift captured for the first time a smoothly rising x-ray re-brightening ofclear non-flaring origin after the steep decay in a long gamma-ray burst (grb):grb081028. a rising phase is likely present in all grbs but is usually hiddenby the prompt tail emission and constitutes the first manifestation of what islater to give rise to the shallow decay phase. contemporaneous opticalobservations reveal a rapid evolution of the injection frequency of a fastcooling synchrotron spectrum through the optical band, which disfavours theafterglow onset (start of the forward shock emission along our line of sightwhen the outflow is decelerated) as the origin of the observed re-brightening.we investigate alternative scenarios and find that the observations areconsistent with the predictions for a narrow jet viewed off-axis. the highon-axis energy budget implied by this interpretation suggests differentphysical origins of the prompt and (late) afterglow emission. strong spectralsoftening takes place from the prompt to the steep decay phase: we track theevolution of the spectral peak energy from the gamma-rays to the x-rays andhighlight the problems of the high latitude and adiabatic coolinginterpretations. notably, a softening of both the high and low spectral slopeswith time is also observed. we discuss the low on-axis radiative efficiency ofgrb081028 comparing its properties against a sample of swift long grbs withsecure e_gamma,iso measurements.

0911.5544	discovery of a new soft gamma repeater: sgr j0418+5729	on 2009 june 5, the gamma-ray burst monitor (gbm) onboard the fermi gamma-rayspace telescope triggered on two short, and relatively dim bursts with spectralproperties similar to soft gamma repeater (sgr) bursts. independentlocalizations of the bursts by triangulation with the konus-rf and with theswift satellite, confirmed their origin from the same, previously unknown,source. the subsequent discovery of x-ray pulsations with the rossi x-raytiming explorer (rxte), confirmed the magnetar nature of the new source, sgrj0418+5729. we describe here the fermi/gbm observations, the discovery and thelocalization of this new sgr, and our infrared and chandra x-ray observations.we also present a detailed temporal and spectral study of the two gbm bursts.sgr j0418+5729 is the second source discovered in the same region of the sky inthe last year, the other one being sgr j0501+4516. both sources lie in thedirection of the galactic anti-center and presumably at the nearby distance of~2 kpc (assuming they reside in the perseus arm of our galaxy). thenear-threshold gbm detection of bursts from sgr j0418+5729 suggests that theremay be more such dim sgrs throughout our galaxy, possibly exceeding thepopulation of bright sgrs. finally, using sample statistics, we conclude thatthe implications of the new sgr discovery on the number of observable activemagnetars in our galaxy at any given time is &lt;10, in agreement with our earlierestimates.

0704.1609	grb 061121: broadband spectral evolution through the prompt and  afterglow phases of a bright burst	swift triggered on a precursor to the main burst of grb 061121 (z=1.314),allowing observations to be made from the optical to gamma-ray bands. manyother telescopes, including konus-wind, xmm-newton, rotse and the faulkestelescope north, also observed the burst. the gamma-ray, x-ray and uv/opticalemission all showed a peak ~75s after the trigger, although the optical andx-ray afterglow components also appear early on - before, or during, the mainpeak. spectral evolution was seen throughout the burst, with the promptemission showing a clear positive correlation between brightness and hardness.the spectral energy distribution (sed) of the prompt emission, stretching from1ev up to 1mev, is very flat, with a peak in the flux density at ~1kev. theoptical-to-x-ray spectra at this time are better fitted by a broken, ratherthan single, power-law, similar to previous results for x-ray flares. the sedshows spectral hardening as the afterglow evolves with time. this behaviourmight be a symptom of self-comptonisation, although circumstellar densitiessimilar to those found in the cores of molecular clouds would be required. theafterglow also decays too slowly to be accounted for by the standard models.although the precursor and main emission show different spectral lags, both areconsistent with the lag-luminosity correlation for long bursts. grb 061121 isthe instantaneously brightest long burst yet detected by swift. using acombination of swift and konus-wind data, we estimate an isotropic energy of2.8x10^53 erg over 1kev - 10mev in the grb rest frame. a probable jet break isdetected at ~2x10^5s, leading to an estimate of ~10^51 erg for thebeaming-corrected gamma-ray energy.

1002.0581	grb 081008: from burst to afterglow and the transition phase in between	we present a multi-wavelength study of grb 081008, at redshift 1.967, byswift, rotse-iii and grond. compared to other swift grbs, grb 081008 has atypical gamma-ray isotropic equivalent energy output (10^53 erg) during theprompt phase, and displayed two temporally separated clusters of pulses. theearly x-ray emission seen by the swift/xrt was dominated by the softening tailof the prompt emission, producing multiple flares during and after theswift/bat detections. optical observations that started shortly after the firstactive phase of gamma-ray emission showed two consecutive peaks. we interpretthe first optical peak as the onset of the afterglow associated with the earlyburst activities. a second optical peak, coincident with the later gamma-raypulses, imposes a small modification to the otherwise smooth lightcurve andthus suggests a minimal contribution from a probable internal component. wesuggest the early optical variability may be from continuous energy injectioninto the forward shock front by later shells producing the second epoch ofburst activities. these early observations thus provide a potential probe forthe transition from prompt to the afterglow phase. the later lightcurve of grb081008 displays a smooth steepening in all optical bands and x-ray. thetemporal break is consistent with being achromatic at the observed wavelengths.our broad energy coverage shortly after the break constrains a spectral breakwithin optical. however, the evolution of the break frequency is not observed.we discuss the plausible interpretations of this behavior.

1002.3889	imaging and burst location with the exist high-energy telescope	the primary instrument of the proposed exist mission is a coded mask highenergy telescope (the het), that must have a wide field of view and extremelygood sensitivity. it will be crucial to minimize systematic errors so that evenfor very long total integration times the imaging performance is close to thestatistical photon limit. there is also a requirement to be able to reconstructimages on-board in near real time in order to detect and localize gamma-raybursts. this must be done while the spacecraft is scanning the sky. thescanning provides all-sky coverage and is key to reducing systematic errors.the on-board computational problem is made even more challenging for exist bythe very large number of detector pixels. numerous alternative designs for thehet have been evaluated. the baseline concept adopted depends on a unique codedmask with two spatial scales. monte carlo simulations and analytic analysistechniques have been used to demonstrate the capabilities of the design and ofthe proposed two-step burst localization procedure.

0709.4333	bat x-ray survey - iii: x-ray spectra and statistical properties	in this concluding part of the series of three papers dedicated to theswift/bat hard x-ray survey (bxs), we focus on the x-ray spectral analysis andstatistical properties of the source sample. using a dedicated method toextract time-averaged spectra of bat sources we show that galactic sourceshave, generally, softer spectra than extragalactic objects and that seyfert 2galaxies are harder than seyfert 1s. the averaged spectrum of all seyfertgalaxies is consistent with a power-law with photon index of 2.00 (+/-0.07).the cumulative flux-number relation for the extragalactic sources in the 14-170kev band is best described by a power-law with a slope alpha=1.55 (+/-0.20) anda normalization of 9.6$\pm1.9 \times 10^{-3}$ agn deg$^{-2}$ (or 396(+/-80) agnall-sky) above a flux level of 2$\times 10^{-11}$erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ (~0.85mcrab). the integration of the cumulative flux per unit area indicates that batresolves 1-2% of the x-ray background emission in the 14-170 kev band. asub-sample of 24 extragalactic sources above the 4.5 sigma detection limit isused to study the statistical properties of agn. this sample comprises localseyfert galaxies (z=0.026, median value) and ~10% blazars. we find that 55% ofthe seyfert galaxies are absorbed by column densities of log(n_h)&gt;22, but thatnone is a bona fide compton-thick. this study shows the capabilities of bat toprobe the hard x-ray sky to the mcrab level.

1111.0283	panchromatic observations of the textbook grb 110205a: constraining  physical mechanisms of prompt emission and afterglow	we present a comprehensive analysis of a bright, long duration (t90 ~ 257 s)grb 110205a at redshift z= 2.22. the optical prompt emission was detected byswift/uvot, rotse-iiib and bootes telescopes when the grb was still radiatingin the gamma-ray band. nearly 200 s of observations were obtainedsimultaneously from optical, x-ray to gamma-ray, which makes it one of theexceptional cases to study the broadband spectral energy distribution across 6orders of magnitude in energy during the prompt emission phase. by fitting thetime resolved prompt spectra, we clearly identify, for the first time, aninteresting two-break energy spectrum, roughly consistent with the standard grbsynchrotron emission model in the fast cooling regime. although the promptoptical emission is brighter than the extrapolation of the best fit x/gamma-rayspectra, it traces the gamma-ray light curve shape, suggesting a relation tothe prompt high energy emission. the synchrotron + ssc scenario is disfavoredby the data, but the models invoking a pair of internal shocks or having twoemission regions can interpret the data well. shortly after prompt emission (~1100 s), a bright (r = 14.0) optical emission hump with very steep rise (alpha~ 5.5) was observed which we interpret as the emission from the reverse shock.it is the first time that the rising phase of a reverse shock component hasbeen closely observed. the full optical and x-ray afterglow lightcurves can beinterpreted within the standard reverse shock (rs) + forward shock (fs) model.in general, the high quality prompt emission and afterglow data allow us toapply the standard fireball shock model to extract valuable information aboutthe grb including the radiation mechanism, radius of prompt emission r, initiallorentz factor of the outflow, the composition of the ejecta, as well as thecollimation angle and the total energy budget.

0801.4319	global properties of x-ray flashes and x-ray-rich gamma-ray bursts  observed by swift	we describe and discuss the spectral and temporal characteristics of theprompt emission and x-ray afterglow emission of x-ray flashes (xrfs) andx-ray-rich gamma-ray bursts (xrrs) detected and observed by swift betweendecember 2004 and september 2006. we compare these characteristics to a sampleof conventional classical gamma-ray bursts (c-grbs) observed during the sameperiod. we confirm the correlation between epeak_obs and fluence noted byothers and find further evidence that xrfs, xrrs and c-grbs form a continuum.we also confirm that our known redshift sample is consistent with thecorrelation between the peak energy in the grb rest frame (epeak_src) and theisotropic radiated energy (eiso), so called the epeak_src-eiso relation. thespectral properties of x-ray afterglows of xrfs and c-grbs are similar, but thetemporal properties of xrfs and c-grbs are quite different. we found that thelight curves of c-grb afterglows show a break to steeper indices(shallow-to-steep break) at much earlier times than do xrf afterglows.moreover, the overall luminosity of xrf x-ray afterglows is systematicallysmaller by a factor of two or more compared to that of c-grbs. these distinctdifferences between the x-ray afterglows of xrfs and c-grbs may be the key tounderstanding not only the mysterious shallow-to-steep break in x-ray afterglowlight curves, but also the unique nature of xrfs.

1312.4955	the 100-month swift catalogue of supergiant fast x-ray transients i. bat  on-board and transient monitor flares	we investigate the characteristics of bright flares for a sample ofsupergiant fast x-ray transients and their relation to the orbital phase. wehave retrieved all swift/bat transient monitor light curves, and collected alldetections in excess of $5\sigma$ from both daily- and orbital-averaged lightcurves in the time range of 2005-feb-12 to 2013-may-31. we also considered allon-board detections as recorded in the same time span and selected those within4 arcmin of each source in our sample and in excess of $5\sigma$. we present acatalogue of over a thousand bat flares from 11 sfxts, down to 15-150kev fluxesof $\sim6\times10^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ (daily timescale) and$\sim1.5\times10^{-9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ (orbital timescale, averaging$\sim800$s) and spanning 100 months. the great majority of these flares areunpublished. this population is characterized by short (a few hundred seconds)and relatively bright (in excess of 100mcrab, 15-50kev) events. in the hardx-ray, these flares last in general much less than a day. clustering of hardx-ray flares can be used to indirectly measure the length of an outburst, evenwhen the low-level emission is not detected. we construct the distributions offlares, of their significance (in terms of sigma) and their flux as a functionof orbital phase, to infer the properties of these binary systems. inparticular, we observe a trend of clustering of flares at some phases as$p_{\rm orb}$ increases, as consistent with a progression from tight, circularor mildly eccentric orbits at short periods, to wider and more eccentric orbitsat longer orbital periods. finally, we estimate the expected number of flaresfor a given source for our limiting flux and provide the recipe for calculatingthem for the limiting flux of future hard x-ray observatories.

0808.3391	correlations of prompt and afterglow emission in swift long and short  gamma ray bursts	correlation studies of prompt and afterglow emissions from gamma-ray bursts(grbs) between different spectral bands has been difficult to do in the pastbecause few bursts had comprehensive and intercomparable afterglowmeasurements. in this paper we present a large and uniform data set forcorrelation analysis based on bursts detected by the swift mission. for thefirst time, short and long bursts can be analyzed and compared. it is found forboth classes that the optical, x-ray and gamma-ray emissions are linearlycorrelated, but with a large spread about the correlation line; stronger burststend to have brighter afterglows, and bursts with brighter x-ray afterglow tendto have brighter optical afterglow. short bursts are, on average, weaker inboth prompt and afterglow emissions. no short bursts are seen with extremelylow optical to x-ray ratio as occurs for "dark" long bursts. althoughstatistics are still poor for short bursts, there is no evidence yet for asubgroup of short bursts with high extinction as there is for long bursts. longbursts are detected in the dark category at the same fraction as for pre-swiftbursts. interesting cases are discovered of long bursts that are detected inthe optical, and yet have low enough optical to x-ray ratio to be classified asdark. for the prompt emission, short and long bursts have different averagetracks on flux vs fluence plots. in swift, grb detections tend to be fluencelimited for short bursts and flux limited for long events.

astro-ph;0503521	a link between prompt optical and prompt gamma-ray emission in gamma-ray  bursts	the prompt optical emission that arrives with gamma-rays from a cosmicgamma-ray burst (grb) is a signature of the engine powering the burst, theproperties of the ultra-relativistic ejecta of the explosion, and the ejecta'sinteractions with the surroundings. until now, only grb 990123 had beendetected at optical wavelengths during the burst phase. its prompt opticalemission was variable and uncorrelated with the prompt gamma-ray emission,suggesting that the optical emission was generated by a reverse shock arisingfrom the ejecta's collision with the surrounding material. here we reportprompt optical emission from grb 041219a. it is variable and correlated withthe prompt gamma-rays, indicating a common origin for the optical light and thegamma-rays. within the context of the standard fireball model of grbs, weattribute this new optical component to internal shocks driven into the burstejecta by variations of the inner engine. the correlated optical emission is adirect probe of the jet isolated from the medium. the timing of theuncorrelated optical emission is strongly dependent on the nature of themedium.

astro-ph;0505474	early-time chromatic variations in the wind-swept medium of grb 021211  and the faintness of its afterglow	we present follow-up network for gamma-ray bursts (fun grb) collaborationobservations of the optical afterglow of grb 021211 made between 143 secondsand 102 days after the burst. our unique data set includes the earliestfiltered detections and color information for an afterglow in the pre-swiftera. we find that the afterglow is best described by (1) propagation through awind-swept medium, (2) a cooling break that is blueward of the observed opticalfrequencies, and (3) a hard electron energy distribution. however, superimposedon this "standard model" behavior we find significant chromatic variationswithin the first few hours after the burst. we consider possible reasons forthese variations, including the possibility that they are due to a dust echo.finally, we constrain physical parameters that describe the afterglow andsurrounding medium for a variety of scenarios and find that grb 021211'safterglow is faint for a combination of 3-4 reasons: (1) a low fraction ofenergy in relativistic electrons, (2) a low density for the wind-swept medium,implying either a low mass-loss rate and/or a high wind velocity for theprogenitor, (3) a wide opening/viewing angle for the jet, and possibly (4)moderate source frame extinction. the jet appears to be significantly far fromequipartition and magnetically dominated. more extreme versions of this mightexplain the darkness of many afterglows in the swift era.

astro-ph;0507410	the burst alert telescope (bat) on the swift midex mission	the burst alert telescope (bat) is one of 3 instruments on the swift midexspacecraft to study gamma-ray bursts (grbs). the bat first detects the grb andlocalizes the burst direction to an accuracy of 1-4 arcmin within 20 sec afterthe start of the event. the grb trigger initiates an autonomous spacecraft slewto point the two narrow field-of-view (fov) instruments at the burst locationwithin 20-70 sec so to make follow-up x-ray and optical observations. the batis a wide-fov, coded-aperture instrument with a cdznte detector plane. thedetector plane is composed of 32,768 pieces of cdznte (4x4x2mm), and thecoded-aperture mask is composed of approximately 52,000 pieces of lead(5x5x1mm) with a 1-m separation between mask and detector plane. the batoperates over the 15-150 kev energy range with approximately 7 kev resolution,a sensitivity of approximately 10e-8 erg*cm^-2*s^-1, and a 1.4 sr (half-coded)fov. we expect to detect &gt;100 grbs/yr for a 2-year mission. the bat alsoperforms an all-sky hard x-ray survey with a sensitivity of approximately 2mcrab (systematic limit) and it serves as a hard x-ray transient monitor.

astro-ph;0509273	very early optical afterglows of gamma-ray bursts: evidence for relative  paucity of detection	very early observations with the swift satellite of gamma-ray burst (grb)afterglows reveal that the optical component is not detected in a large numberof cases. this is in contrast to the bright optical flashes previouslydiscovered in some grbs (e.g. grb 990123 and grb 021211). comparisons of thex-ray afterglow flux to the optical afterglow flux and prompt gamma-ray fluenceis used to quantify the seemingly deficient optical, and in some cases x-ray,light at these early epochs. this comparison reveals that some of these burstsappear to have higher than normal gamma-ray efficiencies. we discuss possiblemechanisms and their feasibility for explaining the apparent lack of earlyoptical emission. the mechanisms considered include: foreground extinction,circumburst absorption, ly-alpha blanketing and absorption due to highredshift, low density environments, rapid temporal decay, and intrinsicweakness of the reverse shock. of these, foreground extinction, circumburstabsorption, and high redshift provide the best explanations for most of thenon-detections in our sample. there is tentative evidence of suppression of thestrong reverse shock emission. this could be because of apoynting-flux-dominated flow or a pure non-relativistic hydrodynamical reverseshock.

astro-ph;0509860	the swift/bat high latitude survey: first results	we present preliminary results from the first 3 months of the swift bat highgalactic latitude survey in the 14--195 kev band. the survey reaches a flux of\~10^{-11} erg/cm^2/s and has ~2.7' (90% confidence) positional uncertaintiesfor the faintest sources. this represents the most sensitive survey to date inthis energy band. these data confirm the conjectures that a high energyselected agn sample would have very different properties from those selected inother bands and represent a `true' sample of the agn population. we haveidentified 86% of the 66 high-latitude sources. 12 are galactic type sourcesand 44 can be identified with previously known agn. all but 5 of the agn havearchival x-ray spectra, enabling the estimation of line of sight columndensities and other spectral properties. both of the z &gt; 0.11 objects areblazars. the median redshift of the others (excluding radio-loud objects) is0.012. we find that the column density distribution of these agn is bimodalwith 64% of the non-blazar sources having column densities n_h &gt;= 10^{22}cm$^{-2}$. none of the sources with log l_x &gt; 43.5 show high column densitiesand very few of the lower l_x sources have low column densities. based on thesedata, we expect the final bat catalog to have &gt;200 agn and reach fluxes of lessthan ~10^{-11} erg/cm^2/s over the entire sky.

astro-ph;0510566	swift and optical observations of grb 050401	we present the results of the analysis of gamma-ray and x-ray data of grb050401 taken with the swift satellite, together with a series of ground-basedfollow-up observations. the swift x-ray light curve shows a clear break atabout 4900 seconds after the grb. the decay indices before and after the breakare consistent with a scenario of continuous injection of radiation from the'central engine' of the grb to the fireball. alternatively, this behaviourcould result if ejecta are released with a range of lorentz factors with theslower shells catching up the faster at the afterglow shock position. the twoscenarios are observationally indistinguishable. the grb 050401 afterglow isquite bright in the x-ray band but weak in the optical, with an optical tox-ray flux ratio similar to those of 'dark bursts'. we detect a significantamount of absorption in the x-ray spectrum, with n_h = (1.7 +/- 0.2) x 10^22cm^-2 at a redshift of z=2.9, which is typical of a dense circumbust medium.such high column density implies an unrealistic optical extinction of 30magnitudes if we adopt the galactic extinction law, which would not consistentwith optical detection of the afterglow. this suggests that the extinction lawis different from the galactic one.

astro-ph;0510677	swift observations of the x-ray bright grb 050315	this paper discusses swift observations of the gamma-ray burst grb 050315(z=1.949) from 80 s to 10 days after the onset of the burst. the x-ray lightcurve displayed a steep early decay (t^-5) for ~200 s and several breaks.however, both the prompt hard x-ray/gamma-ray emission (observed by the bat)and the first ~ 300 s of x-ray emission (observed by the xrt) can be explainedby exponential decays, with similar decay constants. extrapolating the batlight curve into the xrt band suggests the rapidly decaying, early x-rayemission was simply a continuation of the fading prompt emission; this strongsimilarity between the prompt gamma-ray and early x-ray emission may be relatedto the simple temporal and spectral character of this x-ray rich grb. theprompt (bat) spectrum was a steep down to 15 kev, and appeared to continuethrough the xrt bandpass, implying a low peak energy, inconsistent with theamati relation. following the initial steep decline the x-ray afterglow did notfade for ~1.2*10^4 s, after which time it decayed with a temporal index ofalpha ~ 0.7, followed by a second break at ~2.5*10^5 s to a slope of alpha ~ 2.the apparent `plateau' in the x-ray light curve, after the early rapid decay,makes this one of the most extreme examples of the steep-flat-steep x-ray lightcurves revealed by swift. if the second afterglow break is identified with ajet break then the jet opening angle was theta_0 ~ 5 deg, and implying e_gamma&gt; 10^50 erg.

astro-ph;0511576	discovery of an afterglow extension of the prompt phase of two gamma ray  bursts observed by swift	bat and xrt observations of two recent well-covered grbs observed by swift,grb 050315 and grb 050319, show clearly a prompt component joining the onset ofthe afterglow emission. by fitting a power law form to the gamma-ray spectrum,we extrapolate the time dependent fluxes measured by the bat, in the energyband 15-350 kev, into the spectral regime observed by the xrt 0.2-10 kev, andexamine the functional form of the rate of decay of the two light curves. wefind that the bat and xrt light curves merge to form a unified curve. there isa period of steep decay up to ~300 s, followed by a flatter decay. the durationof the steep decay, ~100 s in the source frame after correcting forcosmological time dilation, agrees roughly with a theoretical estimate for thedeceleration time of the relativistic ejecta as it interacts with circumstellarmaterial. for grb 050315, the steep decay can be characterized by anexponential form, where one e-folding decay time t_e(bat) ~ 24+/-2 s, andt_e(xrt) ~ 35+/-2 s. for grb 050319, a power law decay -(d ln f/d ln t) = n,where n is about 3, provides a reasonable fit. the early time x-ray fluxes areconsistent with representing the lower energy tail of the prompt emission, andprovide our first quantitative measure of the decay of the prompt gamma-rayemission over a large dynamic range in flux. the initial steep decay isexpected due to the delayed high latitude photons from a curved shell ofrelativistic plasma illuminated only for a short interval. the overallconclusion is that the prompt phase of grbs remains observable for hundreds ofseconds longer than previously thought.

astro-ph;0511579	an origin for short g-ray bursts unassociated with current star  formation	two short (&lt;2 s) g-ray bursts (grbs) have recently been localized and fadingafterglow counterparts detected. the combination of these two results leftunclear the nature of the host galaxies of the bursts, because one was astar-forming dwarf, while the other was probably an elliptical galaxy. here wereport the x-ray localization of a short burst (grb 050724) with unusual g-rayand x-ray properties. the x-ray afterglow lies off the centre of an ellipticalgalaxy at a redshift of z=0.258, coincident with the position determined byground-based optical and radio observations. the low level of star formationtypical for elliptical galaxies makes it unlikely that the burst originated n asupernova explosion. a supernova origin was also ruled out for grb 050709, eventhough that burst took place in a galaxy with current star formation. theisotropic energy for the short bursts is 2-3 orders of magnitude lower han thatfor the long bursts. our results therefore suggest that an alternative sourceof bursts -- the of binary systems of neutron stars or a neutron star-blackhole pair -- are the progenitors of short bursts.

astro-ph;0610635	swift detects a remarkable gamma-ray burst, grb 060614, that introduces  a new classification scheme	gamma ray bursts (grbs) are known to come in two duration classes, separatedat ~2 s. long bursts originate from star forming regions in galaxies, haveaccompanying supernovae (sne) when near enough to observe and are likely causedby massive-star collapsars. recent observations show that short burstsoriginate in regions within their host galaxies with lower star formation ratesconsistent with binary neutron star (ns) or ns - black hole (bh) mergers.moreover, although their hosts are predominantly nearby galaxies, no sne havebeen so far associated with short grbs. we report here on the bright, nearbygrb 060614 that does not fit in either class. its ~102 s duration groups itwith long grbs, while its temporal lag and peak luminosity fall entirely withinthe short grb subclass. moreover, very deep optical observations exclude anaccompanying supernova, similar to short grbs. this combination of a longduration event without accompanying sn poses a challenge to both a collapsarand merging ns interpretation and opens the door on a new grb classificationscheme that straddles both long and short bursts.

astro-ph;0611148	swift discovery of gamma-ray bursts without jet break feature in their  x-ray afterglows	we analyze swift gamma-ray bursts (grbs) and x-ray afterglows for three grbswith spectroscopic redshift determinations -- grb 050401, xrf 050416a, and grb050525a. we find that the relation between spectral peak energy and isotropicenergy of prompt emissions (the amati relation) is consistent with that for thebursts observed in pre-swift era. however, we find that the x-ray afterglowlightcurves, which extend up to 10-70 days, show no sign of the jet break thatis expected in the standard framework of collimated outflows. we do so byshowing that none of the x-ray afterglow lightcurves in our sample satisfiesthe relation between the spectral and temporal indices that is predicted forthe phase after jet break. the jet break time can be predicted by inverting thetight empirical relation between the peak energy of the spectrum and thecollimation-corrected energy of the prompt emission (the ghirlanda relation).we find that there are no temporal breaks within the predicted time intervalsin x-ray band. this requires either that the ghirlanda relation has a largerscatter than previously thought, that the temporal break in x-rays is masked bysome additional source of x-ray emission, or that it does not happen because ofsome unknown reason.

astro-ph;0702603	grb 060714: no clear dividing line between prompt emission and x-ray  flares	the long gamma-ray burst grb 060714 was observed to exhibit a series of fivex-ray flares beginning ~70 s after the burst trigger t0 and continuing until t0+ ~200 s. the first two flares were detected by the burst alert telescope (bat)on the swift satellite, before swift had slewed to the burst location, whilethe last three flares were strongly detected by the x-ray telescope (xrt) butonly weakly detected by the bat. this burst provides an unusual opportunity totrack a complete sequence of flares over a wide energy range. the flares werevery similar in their light curve morphology, showing power-law rise and fallcomponents, and in most cases significant sub-structure. the flares also showedstrong evolution with time, both spectrally and temporally. the small timescale and large amplitude variability observed are incompatible with anexternal shock origin for the flares, and support instead late time sporadicactivity either of the central source or of localized dissipation events withinthe outflow. we show that the flares in grb 060714 cannot be the result ofinternal shocks in which the contrast in the lorentz factor of the collidingshells is very small, and that this mechanism faces serious difficulties inmost swift grbs. the morphological similarity of the flares and the promptemission and the gradual and continual evolution of the flares with time makesit difficult and arbitrary to draw a dividing line between the prompt emissionand the flares.

astro-ph;9708130	new constraints on simultaneous optical emission from grbs measured by  the lotis experiment	lotis is a gamma-ray burst optical counterpart search experiment located nearlawrence livermore national laboratory in california. since operations began inoctober 1996, lotis has responded to five triggers as of july 30, 1997, whichoccurred during good weather conditions.  grb970223 (batse trigger #6100) was an exceptionally strong burst lasting$\sim30$ s with a peak at $\sim8$ s. lotis began imaging the error box $\sim11$ s after the burst began, and achieved simultaneous optical coverage of 100%of the region enclosed by the batse $3\sigma$ error circle and the ipn annulus.no optical transients were observed brighter than the m$_v \sim 11$completeness limit of the resulting images providing a new upper limit on thesimultaneous optical to gamma-ray fluence ratio of $r_l &lt; 1.1 \times 10^{-4}$and on the simultaneous optical (at 700 nm) to gamma-ray (at 100 kev) fluxdensity ratio of $r_f &lt; 305$ for a b type spectrum and $r_f &lt; 475$ for an mtype spectrum.

astro-ph;9804074	gamma-ray limits on galactic 60fe nucleosynthesis and implications on  the origin of the 26al emission	the gamma ray imaging spectrometer (gris) recently observed the gamma-rayemission from the galactic center region. we have detected the 1809 kevgalactic 26al emission at a significance level of 6.8-sigma but have found noevidence for emission at 1173 kev and 1332 kev, expected from the decay chainof the nucleosynthetic 60fe. the isotopic abundances and fluxes are derived fordifferent source distribution models. the resulting abundances are between2.6+-0.4 and 4.5+-0.7 solar masses for 26al and a 2-sigma upper limit for 60febetween 1.7 and 3.1 solar masses. the measured 26al emission flux issignificantly higher than that derived from the cgro/comptel 1.8 mev sky map.this suggests that a fraction of the 26al emission may come from extendedsources with a low surface brightness that are invisible to comptel. we obtaina 60fe to 26al flux ratio 2-sigma upper limit of 0.14, which is slightly lowerthan the 0.16 predicted from current nucleosynthesis models assuming that sniiare the major contributors to the galactic 26al. since the uncertainties in thepredicted fluxes are large (up to a factor of 2), our measurement is stillcompatible with the theoretical expectations.

astro-ph;9902190	lotis search for early time optical afterglows: grb 971227	we report on the very early time search for an optical afterglow from grb971227 with the livermore optical transient imaging system (lotis). lotis beganimaging the `original' batse error box of grb 971227 approximately 14 s afterthe onset of gamma-ray emission. continuous monitoring of the positionthroughout the evening yielded a total of 499 images (10 s integration).analysis of these images revealed no steady optical afterglow brighter thanr=12.3 +- 0.2 in any single image. coaddition of different combinations of thelotis images also failed to uncover transient optical emission. in particular,assuming a constant early time flux, no optical afterglow brighter than r=14.2+- 0.2 was present within the first 1200 s and no optical afterglow brighterthan r=15.0 +- 0.2 was present in the first 6.0 h.  follow up observations by other groups revealed a likely x-ray afterglow anda possible optical afterglow. although subsequent deeper observations could notconfirm a fading source, we show that these transients are not inconsistentwith our present knowledge of the characteristics of grb afterglows. we alsodemonstrate that with the upgraded thermoelectrically cooled ccds, lotis iscapable of either detecting very early time optical afterglow or placingstringent constraints on the relationship between the gamma-ray emission andthe longer wavelength afterglow in relativistic blast wave models.

astro-ph;9912402	lotis upper limits and the prompt ot from grb 990123	grb 990123 established the existence of prompt optical emission fromgamma-ray bursts (grbs). the livermore optical transient imaging system (lotis)has been conducting a fully automated search for this kind of simultaneous lowenergy emission from grbs since october 1996. although lotis has obtainedsimultaneous, or near simultaneous, coverage of the error boxes obtained withbatse, ipn, xte, and bepposax for several grbs, image analysis resulted in onlyupper limits. the unique gamma-ray properties of grb 990123, such as very largefluence (top 0.4%) and hard spectrum, complicate comparisons with more typicalbursts. we scale and compare gamma-ray properties, and in some cases afterglowproperties, from the best lotis events to those of grb 990123 in an attempt todetermine whether the prompt optical emission of this event is representativeof all grbs. furthermore, using lotis upper limits in conjunction with therelativistic blast wave model, we weakly constrain the grb and afterglowparameters such as density of the circumburster medium and bulk lorentz factorof the ejecta.

0811.3401	epeak estimator for gamma-ray bursts observed by the swift burst alert  telescope	we report a correlation based on a spectral simulation study of the promptemission spectra of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) detected by the swift burst alerttelescope (bat). the correlation is between the epeak energy, which is the peakenergy in the \nu f_\nu spectrum, and the photon index (\gamma) derived from asimple power-law model. the epeak - \gamma relation, assuming the typicalsmoothly broken power-law spectrum of grbs, is \log epeak = 3.258 - 0.829\gamma(1.3 &lt; \gamma &lt; 2.3). we take into account not only a range of epeak energiesand fluences, but also distributions for both the low-energy photon index andthe high-energy photon index in the smoothly broken power-law model. thedistribution of burst durations in the bat grb sample is also included in thesimulation. our correlation is consistent with the index observed by bat andepeak measured by the bat, and by other grb instruments. since about 85% ofgrbs observed by the bat are acceptably fit with the simple power-law modelbecause of the relatively narrow energy range of the bat, this relationship canbe used to estimate epeak when it is located within the bat energy range.

0706.1257	detection of grb 060927 at z = 5.47: implications for the use of  gamma-ray bursts as probes of the end of the dark ages	we report on follow-up observations of the grb 060927 using the rotse-iiiatelescope and a suite of larger aperture ground-based telescopes. an opticalafterglow was detected 20 s after the burst, the earliest rest-frame detectionof optical emission from any grb. spectroscopy performed with the vlt about 13hours after the trigger shows a continuum break at lambda ~ 8070 a produced byneutral hydrogen absorption at z~5.6. we also detect an absorption line at 8158a which we interpret as siii at z=5.467. hence, grb 060927 is the second mostdistant grb with a spectroscopically measured redshift. the shape of the redwing of the spectral break can be fitted by a damped lyalpha profile with acolumn density with log(n_hi/cm^-2) ~ 22.5. we discuss the implications of thiswork for the use of grbs as probes of the end of the dark ages and draw threemain conclusions: i) grb afterglows originating from z&gt;6 should be relativelyeasy to detect from the ground, but rapid nir monitoring is necessary to ensurethat they are found; ii) the presence of large hi column densities in some grbshost galaxies at z&gt;5 makes the use of grbs to probe the reionization epoch viaspectroscopy of the red damping wing challenging; iii) grbs appear crucial tolocate typical star-forming galaxies at z&gt;5 and therefore the type of galaxiesresponsible for the reionization of the universe.
