0905.1592	early-type stars in the young open cluster ngc 2244 and in the mon ob2  association i. the multiplicity of o-type stars	aims. we present the results obtained from a long-term spectroscopic campaigndevoted to the multiplicity of o-type stars in the young open cluster ngc2244and in the mon ob2 association. methods. our spectroscopic monitoring wasperformed over several years, allowing us to probe different time-scales. foreach star, several spectral diagnostic tools are applied, in order to searchfor line shifts and profile variations. we also measure the projectedrotational velocity and revisit the spectral classification. results. in oursample, several stars were previously considered as spectroscopic binaries,though only a few scattered observations were available. our results now reveala more complex situation. our study identifies two new spectroscopic binaries(hd46149 in ngc2244 and hd46573 in monob2). the first object is a long-perioddouble-lined spectroscopic binary, though the exact value of its period remainsuncertain and the second object is classified as an sb1 system with a period ofabout 10.67 days but the time series of our observations do not enable us toderive a unique orbital solution for this system. we also classify another staras variable in radial velocity (hd46150) and we detect line profile variationsin two rapid rotators (hd46056 and hd46485). conclusions. this spectroscopicinvestigation places a firm lower limit (17%) on the binary fraction of o-starsin ngc2244 and reveals the lack of short-period o+ob systems in this cluster.in addition, a comparison of these new results with two other well-studiedclusters (ngc6231 and ic1805) puts forward possible hints of a relation betweenstellar density and binarity, which could provide constraints on the theoriesabout the formation and early evolution of hot stars.

0905.3981	spectroscopic study of the o-type runaway supergiant hd 195592	the scope of this paper is to perform a detailed spectroscopic study of thenorthern o-type supergiant hd 195592. we use a large sample of high qualityspectra in order to investigate its multiplicity, and to probe the line profilevariability. our analysis reveals a clear spectroscopic binary signature in theprofile of the he {\sc i} $\lambda$ 6678 line, pointing to a probable o + bsystem. we report on low amplitude radial velocity variations in every strongabsorption line in the blue spectrum of hd 195592. these variations are ruledby two time-scales respectively of 5.063 and about 20 days. the former isfirmly established, whilst the latter is poorly constrained. we report also ona very significant line profile variability of the h $\beta$ line, with timescales strongly related to those of the radial velocities. our results providesignificant evidence that hd 195592 is a binary system, with a period thatmight be the variability time-scale of about 5 days. the second time scale maybe the signature of an additional star moving along a wider orbit provided itsmass is low enough, even though direct evidence for the presence of a thirdstar is still lacking. alternatively, the second time-scale may be thesignature of a variability intrinsic to the stellar wind of the primary,potentially related to the stellar rotation.

0906.4629	decoding of the light changes in eclipsing wolf-rayet binaries i. a  non-classical approach to the solution of light curves	we present a technique to determine the orbital and physical parameters ofeclipsing eccentric wolf-rayet + o-star binaries, where one eclipse is producedby the absorption of the o-star light by the stellar wind of the w-r star. ourmethod is based on the use of the empirical moments of the light curve that areintegral transforms evaluated from the observed light curves. the optical depthalong the line of sight and the limb darkening of the w-r star are modelled bysimple mathematical functions, and we derive analytical expressions for themoments of the light curve as a function of the orbital parameters and the keyparameters of the transparency and limb-darkening functions. these analyticalexpressions are then inverted in order to derive the values of the orbitalinclination, the stellar radii, the fractional luminosities, and the parametersof the wind transparency and limb-darkening laws. the method is applied to thesmc w-r eclipsing binary hd 5980, a remarkable object that underwent anlbv-like event in august 1994. the analysis refers to the pre-outburstobservational data. a synthetic light curve based on the elements derived forthe system allows a quality assessment of the results obtained.

0909.0643	spectroscopic study of the variability of three northern of+ supergiants	the transition from early of stars to wn type objects is poorly understood.o-type supergiants with emission lines (oif+) are considered to be intermediatebetween these two classes. the scope of this paper is to investigate thespectral variability of three of+ supergiants. we constituted spectral timeseries of unprecedented quality for our targets (~ 200 spectra in total),essentially in the blue domain, covering time-scales from a few hours up to afew years. time variance spectrum (tvs) and fourier analyses were performed inorder to characterize their spectral variability. we report on a correlatedsignificant line profile variability in the prominent he ii \lambda 4686 andh\beta lines most likely related to the strong stellar winds. the variabilitypattern is similar for the three stars investigated (hd14947, hd15570 andhd16691), and the main differences are more quantitative than qualitative.however, the reported time-scales are somewhat different, and the most strikingvariability pattern is reported for hd16691. we did not find any clear evidencefor binarity, and we focus mainly on an interpretation based on a single starscenario. we show that the behaviour of the three stars investigated in thisstudy present strong similarities, pointing to a putative common scenario, eventhough a few differences should be noted. our preferred interpretation schemeis that of large scale corotating structures modulating the profile of thelines that are produced in the strong stellar wind.

1001.0696	a photometric and spectroscopic investigation of star formation in the  very young open cluster ngc6383	the very young open cluster ngc 6383 centered on the o-star binary hd 159176is an interesting place for studying the impact of early-type stars with strongradiation fields and powerful winds on the formation processes of low-massstars. to investigate this process, it is necessary to determine thecharacteristics (age, presence, or absence of circumstellar material) of thepopulation of low-mass pre-main-sequence (pms) stars in the cluster. weobtained deep u b v (r i)_c h-alpha photometric data of the entire cluster aswell as medium-resolution optical spectroscopy of a subsample of x-ray selectedobjects. our spectroscopic data reveal only very weak h-alpha emission lines ina few x-ray selected pms candidates. we photometrically identify a number ofh-alpha emission candidates but their cluster membership is uncertain. we findthat the fainter objects in the field of view have a wide range of extinction(up to a_v = 20), one x-ray selected ob star having a_v ~ 8. our investigationuncovers a population of pms stars in ngc 6383 that are probably coeval with hd159176. in addition, we detect a population of reddened objects that areprobably located at different depths within the natal molecular cloud of thecluster. finally, we identify a rather complex spatial distribution of h-alphaemitters, which is probably indicative of a severe contamination by foregroundand background stars.

1006.2054	new findings on the prototypical of?p stars	in recent years several in-depth investigations of the three galactic of?pstars were undertaken. these multiwavelength studies revealed the peculiarproperties of these objects (in the x-rays as well as in the optical): magneticfields, periodic line profile variations, recurrent photometric changes.however, many questions remain unsolved. to clarify some of the properties ofthe of?p stars, we have continued their monitoring. a new xmm observation andtwo new optical datasets were obtained. additional information for theprototypical of?p trio has been found. hd108 has now reached its quiescent,minimum-emission state, for the first time in 50--60yrs. the echelle spectra ofhd148937 confirm the presence of the 7d variations in the balmer lines andreveal similar periodic variations (though of lower amplitudes) in the hei5876and heii4686 lines, underlining its similarities with the other twoprototypical of?p stars. the new xmm observation of hd191612 was taken at thesame phase in the line modulation cycle but at a different orbital phase asprevious data. it clearly shows that the x-ray emission of hd191612 ismodulated by the 538d period and not the orbital period of 1542d - it is thusnot of colliding-wind origin and the phenomenon responsible for the opticalchanges appears also at work in the high-energy domain. there are howeverproblems: our mhd simulations of the wind magnetic confinement predict both aharder x-ray flux of a much larger strength than what is observed (the modeleddem peaks at 30-40mk, whereas the observed one peaks at 2mk) and narrow lines(hot gas moving with velocities of 100--200km/s, whereras the observed fwhm is~2000km/s).

1006.2917	first orbital solution for the non-thermal emitter cyg ob2 #9	after the first detection of its binary nature, the spectroscopic monitoringof the non-thermal radio emitter cyg ob2 #9 (p=2.4yrs) has continued, doublingthe number of available spectra of the star. since the discovery paper of 2008,a second periastron passage has occurred in february 2009. using a variety oftechniques, the radial velocities could be estimated and a first, preliminaryorbital solution was derived from the hei5876 line. the mass ratio appearsclose to unity and the eccentricity is large, 0.7--0.75. x-ray data from 2004and 2007 are also analyzed in quest of peculiarities linked to binarity. theobservations reveal no large overluminosity nor strong hardness, but it must benoted that the high-energy data were taken after the periastron passage, at atime where colliding wind emission may be low. some unusual x-ray variabilityis however detected, with a 10% flux decrease between 2004 and 2007. to clarifytheir origin and find a more obvious signature of the wind-wind collision,additional data, taken at periastron and close to it, are needed.

1006.3540	non-thermal radio emission from o-type stars. iv. cyg ob2 no. 8a	we study the non-thermal radio emission of the binary cyg ob2 no. 8a, to seeif it is variable and if that variability is locked to the orbital phase. weinvestigate if the synchrotron emission generated in the colliding-wind regionof this binary can explain the observations and we verify that our proposedmodel is compatible with the x-ray data. we use both new and archive radio datafrom the very large array (vla) to construct a light curve as a function oforbital phase. we also present new x-ray data that allow us to improve thex-ray light curve. we develop a numerical model for the colliding-wind regionand the synchrotron emission it generates. the model also includes free-freeabsorption and emission due to the stellar winds of both stars. in this way weconstruct artificial radio light curves and compare them with the observed one.the observed radio fluxes show phase-locked variability. our model can explainthis variability because the synchrotron emitting region is not completelyhidden by the free-free absorption. in order to obtain a better agreement forthe phases of minimum and maximum flux we need to use stellar wind parametersfor the binary components which are somewhat different from typical values forsingle stars. we verify that the change in stellar parameters does notinfluence the interpretation of the x-ray light curve. our model has troubleexplaining the observed radio spectral index. this could indicate the presenceof clumping or porosity in the stellar wind, which - through its influence onboth the razin effect and the free-free absorption - can considerably influencethe spectral index. non-thermal radio emitters could therefore open a valuablepathway to investigate the difficult issue of clumping in stellar winds.

1103.0101	global x-ray properties of the o and b stars in carina	the key empirical property of the x-ray emission from o stars is a strongcorrelation between the bolometric and x-ray luminosities. in the framework ofthe chandra carina complex project, 129 o and b stars have been detected asx-ray sources; 78 of those, all with spectral type earlier than b3, have enoughcounts for at least a rough x-ray spectral characterization. this leads to anestimate of the lx/lbol ratio for an exceptional number of 60 o stars belongingto the same region and triples the number of carina massive stars studiedspectroscopically in x-rays. the derived log(lx/lbol) is -7.26 for singleobjects, with a dispersion of only 0.21dex. using the properties of hot massivestars listed in the literature, we compare the x-ray luminosities of differenttypes of objects. in the case of o stars, the lx/lbol ratios are similar forbright and faint objects, as well as for stars of different luminosity classesor spectral types. binaries appear only slightly harder and slightly moreluminous in x-rays than single objects; the differences are not formallysignificant (at the 1% level), except for the lx/lbol ratio in the medium(1.0--2.5kev) energy band. weak-wind objects have similar x-ray luminositiesbut they display slightly softer spectra compared to "normal" o stars with thesame bolometric luminosity. discarding three overluminous objects, we find avery shallow trend of harder emission in brighter objects. the properties ofthe few b stars bright enough to yield some spectral information appear to bedifferent overall (constant x-ray luminosities, harder spectra), hinting thatanother mechanism for producing x-rays, besides wind shocks, might be at work.however, it must be stressed that the earliest and x-ray brightest amongstthese few detected objects are similar to the latest o stars, suggesting apossibly smooth transition between the two processes.

1209.6326	discovery of a magnetic field in the rapidly-rotating o-type secondary  of the colliding-wind binary hd 47129 (plaskett's star)	we report the detection of a strong, organized magnetic field in thesecondary component of the massive o8iii/i+o7.5v/iii double-lined spectroscopicbinary system hd 47129 (plaskett's star), in the context of the magnetism inmassive stars (mimes) survey. eight independent stokes $v$ observations wereacquired using the espadons spectropolarimeter at the canada-france-hawaiitelescope and the narval spectropolarimeter at the t\'elescope bernard lyot.using least-squares deconvolution we obtain definite detections of signal instokes $v$ in 3 observations. no significant signal is detected in thediagnostic null ($n$) spectra. the zeeman signatures are broad and track theradial velocity of the secondary component; we therefore conclude that therapidly-rotating secondary component is the magnetized star. correcting thepolarized spectra for the line and continuum of the (sharp-lined) primary, wemeasured the longitudinal magnetic field from each observation. thelongitudinal field of the secondary is variable and exhibits extreme values of$-810\pm 150$ g and $+680\pm 190$ g, implying a minimum surface dipole polarstrength of $2850\pm 500$ g. in contrast, we derive an upper limit ($3\sigma$)to the primary's surface magnetic field of 230 g. the combination of a strongmagnetic field and rapid rotation leads us to conclude that the secondary hostsa centrifugal magnetosphere fed through a magnetically confined wind. werevisit the properties of the optical line profiles and x-ray emission -previously interpreted as a consequence of colliding stellar winds - in thiscontext. we conclude that hd 47129 represents a heretofore unique stellarsystem - a close, massive binary with a rapidly rotating, magnetized component- that will be a rich target for further study.

1307.1970	spectral modelling of the alpha virginis (spica) binary system	context: the technique of matching synthetic spectra computed withtheoretical stellar atmosphere models to the observations is widely used inderiving fundamental parameters of massive stars. when applied to binaries,however, these models generally neglect the interaction effects present inthese systems aims: the aim of this paper is to explore the uncertainties inbinary stellar parameters that are derived from single-star models methods:synthetic spectra that include the tidal perturbations and irradiation effectsare computed for the binary system alpha virginis (spica) using ourrecently-developed combispec model. the synthetic spectra are compared tos/n~2000 observations and optimum values of teff and log(g) are derived.results: the binary interactions have only a small effect on the strength ofthe photospheric absorption lines in spica (&lt;2% for the primary and &lt;4% for thesecondary). these differences are comparable to the uncertainties inherent tothe process of matching synthetic spectra to the observations and thus thederived values of teff and log(g) are unaffected by the binary perturbations.on the other hand, the interactions do produce significant phase-dependent lineprofile variations in the primary star, leading to systematic distortions inthe shape of its radial velocity curve. migrating sub-features ("bumps") arepredicted by our model to be present in the same photospheric lines asobserved, and their appearance does not require any a priori assumptionsregarding non-radial pulsation modes. matching the strength of lines in whichthe most prominent "bumps" occur requires synthetic spectra computed withlarger "microturbulence" than that required by other lines.

1310.3929	wr 138: new results from x-ray and optical spectroscopy	context. massive-binary evolution models predict that some systems will gothrough an evolutionary phase where the original primary has become a supernovaand left a compact object behind that then orbits a wolf-rayet (hereafter, wr)star. wr 138 is an x-ray bright wr star that has been described as a triplesystem, including a compact companion in a short-period orbit. aims. our goalis to search for spectroscopic evidence of a compact companion around wr 138.methods. we used optical and x-ray spectra to search for signatures of acompact companion, which can be revealed by systematic variations in wr opticalspectral lines induced by orbital motion of the compact companion or by hard,luminous x-rays from accretion onto this companion. results. the opticalspectra display emission-line profile variations that are most probably causedby clumps inside the stellar winds. the radial velocities do not vary on ashort time-scale compatible with the suggested orbital period of a putativecompact companion. the x-ray spectra are found to be normal for a wn5-6+obsystem with no indication of accretion by a compact companion. conclusions.there is no evidence for the presence of a compact companion, and we thereforeconclude that wr 138 is a normal long-period (p~1521 d) eccentric wr+ob system.

1405.2245	phase resolved x-ray spectroscopy of hde228766: probing the wind of an  extreme of+/wnlha star	hde228766 is a very massive binary system hosting a secondary component,which is probably in an intermediate evolutionary stage between an ofsupergiant and an wn star. the wind of this star collides with the wind of itso8 ii companion, leading to relatively strong x-ray emission. measuring theorbital variations of the line-of-sight absorption toward the x-ray emissionfrom the wind-wind interaction zone yields information on the wind densities ofboth stars. x-ray spectra have been collected at three key orbital phases toprobe the winds of both stars. optical photometry has been gathered to setconstraints on the orbital inclination of the system. the x-ray spectra revealprominent variations of the intervening column density toward the x-rayemission zone, which are in line with the expectations for a wind-windcollision. we use a toy model to set constraints on the stellar wind parametersby attempting to reproduce the observed variations of the relative fluxes andwind optical depths at 1 kev. the lack of strong optical eclipses sets an upperlimit of about 68 degrees on the orbital inclination. the analysis of thevariations of the x-ray spectra suggests an inclination in the range 54 - 61degrees and indicates that the secondary wind momentum ratio exceeds that ofthe primary by at least a factor 5. our models further suggest that the bulk ofthe x-ray emission arises from the innermost region of the wind interactionzone, which is from a region whose outer radius, as measured from the secondarystar, lies between 0.5 and 1.5 times the orbital separation.

astro-ph;0402412	a phase-resolved xmm-newton campaign on the colliding wind binary hd  152248	we report the first results of an xmm-newton monitoring campaign of the ngc6231 open cluster in the sco ob1 association. this first paper focuses on themassive colliding wind binary hd 152248, which is the brightest x-ray source ofthe cluster. the campaign, with a total duration of 180 ksec, was split intosix separate observations, following the orbital motion of hd 152248. the x-rayflux from this system presents a clear, asymmetric modulation with the phaseand ranges from 0.73 to 1.18 10-12 erg s-1 cm-2 in the [0.5-10.0 kev] energyband. the maximum of the emission is reached slightly after apastron. the epicspectra are quite soft and peak around 0.8-0.9 kev. we characterize their shapeusing several combinations of mekal models and power-law spectra and we detectsignificant spectral variability in the [0.5-2.5 kev] energy band. we alsoperform 2-d hydrodynamical simulations using different sets of parameters thatclosely reproduce the physical and orbital configuration of the hd 152248system at the time of the six xmm-newton pointings. this allows a directconfrontation of the model predictions with the constraints deduced from thex-ray observations of the system. we show that the observed variation of theflux can be explained by a variation of the x-ray emission from the collidingwind zone, diluted by the softer x-ray contribution of the two o-type stars ofthe system. our simulations also reveal that the interaction region of hd152248 should be highly unstable, giving rise to shells of dense gas that areseparated by low density regions. finally, we perform a search for short-termvariability in the light curves of the system and we show that trends arepresent within several of the 30 ksec exposures of our campaign. further, mostof these trends are in good .

astro-ph;0402480	hd108: the mystery deepens with xmm-newton observations	in 2001, using a large spectroscopic dataset from an extensive monitoringcampaign, we discovered that the peculiar of star hd108 displayed spectacularline variations. this strange behaviour could be attributed to a variety ofmodels, and an investigation of the high energy properties of hd108 wascrucially needed to test the predictions from these models. our dedicatedxmm-newton observation of hd108 shows that its spectrum is well represented bya two temperature thermal plasma model with kt_1\sim0.2 kev and kt_2sim1.4 kev.in addition, we find that the star does not display any significant short-termchanges during the xmm-newton exposure. compared to previous einstein and rosatdetections, it also appears that hd108 does not present long-term fluxvariations either. while the dramatic line variations continue to modifyhd108's spectrum in the optical domain, the x-ray emission of the star appearsthus surprisingly stable: no simple model is for the moment able to explainsuch an unexpected behaviour.  thanks to its high sensitivity, the xmm-newton observatory has also enabledthe serendipitous discovery of 57 new x-ray sources in the field of hd108.their properties are also discussed in this paper.

astro-ph;0402663	an xmm-newton observation of the massive binary hd159176	we report the analysis of an xmm-newton observation of the close binaryhd159176 (o7v + o7v). the observed l_x/l_bol ratio reveals an x-ray luminosityexceeding by a factor ~ 7 the expected value for x-ray emission from singleo-stars, therefore suggesting a wind-wind interaction scenario. epic and rgsspectra are fitted consistently with a two temperature mekal optically thinthermal plasma model, with temperatures ranging from ~ 2 to 6 10^6 k. at firstsight, these rather low temperatures are consistent with the expectations for aclose binary system where the winds collide well before reaching their terminalvelocities. we also investigate the variability of the x-ray light curve ofhd159176 on various short time scales. no significant variability is found andwe conclude that if hydrodynamical instabilities exist in the wind interactionregion of hd159176, they are not sufficient to produce an observable signaturein the x-ray emission. hydrodynamic simulations using wind parameters from theliterature reveal some puzzling discrepancies. the most striking one concernsthe predicted x-ray luminosity which is one or more orders of magnitude largerthan the observed one. a significant reduction of the mass loss rate of thecomponents compared to the values quoted in the literature alleviates thediscrepancy but is not sufficient to fully account for the observed luminosity.because hydrodynamical models are best for the adiabatic case whereas thecolliding winds in hd159176 are most likely highly radiative, a totally newapproach has been envisaged...

astro-ph;0502456	non-thermal radio emission from o-type stars. i. hd 168112	we present a radio lightcurve of the o5.5 iii(f+) star hd 168112, based onarchive data from the very large array (vla) and the australia telescopecompact array (atca). the fluxes show considerable variability and a negativespectral index, thereby confirming that hd 168112 is a non-thermal radioemitter. the non-thermal radio emission is believed to be due to synchrotronradiation from relativistic electrons that have been fermi accelerated inshocks. for hd 168112, it is not known whether these shocks are due to awind-wind collision in a binary system or to the intrinsic instability of thestellar wind driving mechanism. assuming hd 168112 to be a single star, oursynchrotron model shows that the velocity jump of the shocks should be veryhigh, or there should be a very large number of shocks in the wind. neither ofthese is compatible with time-dependent hydrodynamical calculations of o starwinds. if, on the other hand, we assume that hd 168112 is a binary, the highvelocity jump is easily explained by ascribing it to the wind-wind collision.by further assuming the star to be an eccentric binary, we can explain theobserved radio variability by the colliding-wind region moving in and out ofthe region where free-free absorption is important. the radio data presentedhere show that the binary has a period between one and two years. by combiningthe radio data with x-ray data, we find that the most likely period is about1.4 yr.

astro-ph;0503471	an xmm-newton observation of the multiple system hd167971 (o5-8v + o5-8v  + (o8i)) and the young open cluster ngc6604	we discuss the results of two xmm-newton observations of the open clusterngc6604 obtained in april and september 2002. we concentrate mainly on themultiple system hd167971 (o5-8v + o5-8v + (o8i)). the soft part of the epicspectrum of this system is thermal with typical temperatures of about 2 10^6 to9 10^6 k. the nature (thermal vs non-thermal) of the hard part of the spectrumis not unambiguously revealed by our data. if the emission is thermal, the hightemperature of the plasma (~ 2.3 10^7 to 4.6 10^7 k) would be typical of whatshould be expected from a wind-wind interaction zone within a long periodbinary system. this emission could arise from an interaction between thecombined winds of the o5-8v + o5-8v close binary system and that of the moredistant o8i companion. assuming instead that the hard part of the spectrum isnon-thermal, the photon index would be rather steep (~3). moreover, a marginalvariability between our two xmm-newton pointings could be attributed to aneclipse of the o5-8v + o5-8v system. the overall x-ray luminosity points to asignificant x-ray luminosity excess of about a factor 4 possibly due tocolliding winds. considering hd167971 along with several recent x-ray and radioobservations, we propose that the simultaneous observation of non-thermalradiation in the x-ray (below 10.0 kev) and radio domains appears ratherunlikely. our investigation of our xmm-newton data of ngc6604 reveals a rathersparse distribution of x-ray emitters. including the two bright non-thermalradio emitters hd168112 and hd167971, we present a list of 31 x-ray sources...(see paper for full abstract)

astro-ph;9706052	the lmc transition star r84 and the core of the lh 39 ob association	on the basis of sub-arcsecond optical imaging we resolve and study the corecomponents of the lmc ob association lh 39. the central star of theassociation, the rare transition object r84, is also investigated using caspecechelle spectroscopy. a new, powerful image restoration code that conserves thefluxes allows us to obtain the magnitudes and colors of the components. webring out some 30 stars in a ~16"x16", area centered on r84. at a resolution of0.19", the closest components to r84 are shown to lie at 1.1" nw and 1.7" nwrespectively of the transition star. one of these stars is the reddest star ofthe field after r84 but turns out to be too faint to correspond to the red m2supergiant previously reported to contaminate the spectrum of r84. if thelate-type spectrum is due to a line-of-sight supergiant with a luminositycomparable to r84, it should lie closer than 0.12" to r84. the transition starshows spectral variability between 1982 and 1991. we also note some slightradial velocity variations of the of emission lines over timescales of severalyears. furthermore, we discuss the apparent absence of o type stars in thisassociation.

0812.3749	a multiwavelength investigation of the massive eclipsing binary cyg ob2  #5	the properties of the early-type binary cyg ob2 #5 have been debated for manyyears and spectroscopic and photometric investigations yielded conflictingresults. we have attempted to constrain the physical properties of the binaryby collecting new optical and x-ray observations. we find that the orbitalperiod of the system slowly changes though we are unable to discriminatebetween several possible explanations of this trend. the best fit solution ofthe continuum light curve reveals a contact configuration with the secondarystar being significantly brighter and hotter on its leading side facing theprimary. the mean temperature of the secondary star turns out to be onlyslightly lower than that of the primary, whilst the bolometric luminosity ratiois found to be 3.1. the solution of the light curve yields a distance of 925+/- 25 pc much lower than the usually assumed distance of the cyg ob2association. whilst we confirm the existence of episodes of higher x-rayfluxes, the data reveal no phase-locked modulation with the 6.6 day period ofthe eclipsing binary nor any clear relation between the x-ray flux and the 6.7yr radio cycle. the bright region of the secondary star is probably heated byenergy transfer in a common envelope in this contact binary system as well asby the collision with the primary's wind. the existence of a common photosphereprobably also explains the odd mass-luminosity relation of the stars in thissystem. most of the x-ray, non-thermal radio, and possibly gamma-ray emissionof cyg ob2 #5 is likely to arise from the interaction of the combined wind ofthe eclipsing binary with at least one additional star of this multiple system.
