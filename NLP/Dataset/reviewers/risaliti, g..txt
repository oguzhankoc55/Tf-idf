0901.0297	imaging the circumnuclear region of ngc 1365 with chandra	we present the first chandra/acis imaging study of the circumnuclear regionof the nearby seyfert galaxy ngc 1365. the x-ray emission is resolved intopoint-like sources and complex, extended emission. the x-ray morphology of theextended emission shows a biconical soft x-ray emission region extending ~5 kpcin projection from the nucleus, coincident with the high excitation outflowcones seen in optical emission lines particularly to the northwest. harderx-ray emission is detected from a kpc-diameter circumnuclear ring, coincidentwith the star-forming ring prominent in the spitzer mid-infrared images; thisx-ray emission is partially obscured by the central dust lane of ngc 1365.spectral fitting of spatially separated components indicates a thermal plasmaorigin for the soft extended x-ray emission (kt=0.57 kev). only a small amountof this emission can be due to photoionization by the nuclear source. detailedcomparison with [oiii]5007 observations shows the hot interstellar medium (ism)is spatially anticorrelated with the [oiii] emitting clouds and has thermalpressures comparable to those of the [oiii] medium, suggesting that the hot ismacts as a confining medium for the cooler photoionized clouds. the abundanceratios of the hot ism are fully consistent with the theoretical values forenrichment from type ii supernovae, suggesting that the hot ism is a wind fromthe starburst circumnuclear ring. x-ray emission from a ~450 pc long nuclearradio jet is also detected to the southeast.

0901.4809	variable partial covering and a relativistic iron line in ngc 1365	we present a complete analysis of the hard x-ray (2-10 kev) properties of theseyfert galaxy ngc 1365, based on a 60 ks xmm-newton observation performed injanuary 2004. the two main results are: 1) we detect an obscuring cloud withn_h~3.5x10^23 cm^(-2) crossing the line of sight in ~25 ks. this implies adimension of the x-ray source not larger than a few 10^13 cm and a distance ofthe obscuring cloud of the order of 10^16 cm. adopting the black hole massm(bh) estimated from the m(bh)-velocity dispersion relation, the source size isd_s&lt;20 r_g and the distance and density of the obscuring clouds arer~3000-10000 r_g and n~10^(10) cm^(-3), i.e. typical values for broad lineregion clouds. 2) an iron emission line with a relativistic profile is detectedwith high statistical significance. a time integrated fit of the line+continuumreflection components suggests a high iron abundance (~3 times solar) and anorigin of these components in the inner part (~10 r_g) of the accretion disk,in agreement with the small source size inferred from the analysis of theabsorption variability.

0902.2398	lsd: lyman-break galaxies stellar populations and dynamics. i: mass,  metallicity and gas at z~3.1	we present the first results of a project, lsd, aimed at obtainingspatially-resolved, near-infrared spectroscopy of a complete sample oflyman-break galaxies at z~3. deep observations with adaptive optics resulted inthe detection of the main optical lines, such as [oii], hbeta and [oiii], whichare used to study sizes, sfrs, morphologies, gas-phase metallicities, gasfractions and effective yields. optical, near-ir and spitzer/irac photometry isused to measure stellar mass. we obtain that morphologies are usually complex,with the presence of several peaks of emissions and companions that are notdetected in broad-band images. typical metallicities are 10-50% solar, with astrong evolution of the mass-metallicity relation from lower redshifts. stellarmasses, gas fraction, and evolutionary stages vary significantly among thegalaxies, with less massive galaxies showing larger fractions of gas. incontrast with observations in the local universe, effective yields decreasewith stellar mass and reach solar values at the low-mass end of the sample.this effect can be reproduced by gas infall with rates of the order of thesfrs. outflows are present but are not needed to explain the mass-metallicityrelation. we conclude that a large fraction of these galaxies are activelycreating stars after major episodes of gas infall or merging.

0905.0496	the fifth data release sloan digital sky survey/xmm-newton quasar survey	we present a catalog of 792 dr5 sdss quasars with optical spectra that havebeen observed serendipitously in the x-rays with the \emph{xmm-newton}. thesequasars cover a redshift range of z = 0.11 - 5.41 and a magnitude range of i =15.3-20.7. substantial numbers of radio-loud (70) and broad absorption line(51) quasars exist within this sample. significant x-ray detections at &gt;2sigmaaccount for 87% of the sample (685 quasars), and 473 quasars are detected at&gt;6sigma, sufficient to allow x-ray spectral fits. for detected sources, ~ 60%have x-ray fluxes between f(2-10 kev) = 1 - 10 x 10^-14 ergs cm^-2 s^-1. we fita single power-law, a fixed power-law with intrinsic absorption left free tovary, and an absorbed power-law model to all quasars with x-ray s/n &gt; 6,resulting in a weighted mean photon index gamma = 1.91 +/- 0.08, with anintrinsic dispersion sigma_gamma = 0.38. for the 55 sources (11.6%) that preferintrinsic absorption, we find a weighted mean n_h = 1.5 +/- 0.3 x 10^21 cm^-2.we find that gamma correlates significantly with optical color, delta(g-i), theoptical-to-x-ray spectral index (alpha_ox) and the x-ray luminosity. while thefirst two correlations can be explained as artefacts of undetected intrinsicabsorption, the correlation between gamma and x-ray luminosity appears to be areal physical correlation, indicating a pivot in the x-ray slope.

0905.0539	on the observed distributions of black hole masses and eddington ratios  from radiation pressure corrected virial indicators	the application of the virial theorem to the broad line region of activegalactic nuclei allows black hole mass estimates for large samples of objectsat all redshifts. in a recent paper we showed that ionizing radiation pressureonto blr clouds affects virial bh mass estimates and we provided empiricallycalibrated corrections. more recently, a new test of the importance ofradiation forces has been proposed: the mbh-sigma relation has been used toestimate mbh for a sample of type-2 agn and virial relations (with and withoutradiation pressure) for a sample of type-1 agn extracted from the same parentpopulation. the observed l/ledd distribution based on virial bh masses is ingood agreement with that based on mbh-sigma only if radiation pressure effectsare negligible, otherwise significant discrepancies are observed. in this paperwe investigate the effects of intrinsic dispersions associated to the virialrelations providing mbh, and we show that they explain the discrepanciesbetween the observed l/ledd distributions of type-1 and type-2 agn. thesediscrepancies in the l/ledd distributions are present regardless of the generalimportance of radiation forces, which must be negligible only for a smallfraction of sources with large l/ledd. average radiation pressure correctionsshould then be applied in virial mbh estimators until their dependence onobserved source physical properties has been fully calibrated. finally, thecomparison between mbh and l/ledd distributions derived from sigma-based andvirial estimators can constrain the variance of blr physical properties in agn.

0905.1041	a suzaku observation of the ulirg iras19254-7245: disclosing the agn  component	we discuss here a long suzaku observation of iras 19254-7245 (also known asthe superantennae), one of the brightest and well studied ultra luminousinfrared galaxies in the local universe. this long observation provided thefirst detection of iras 19254-7245 above 10 kev, and measured a 15-30 kev fluxof ~5x10^(-12) erg cm^-2 s^-1. the detection above 10 kev has allowed us tounveil, for the first time, the intrinsic luminosity of the agn hosted in iras19254-7245, which is strongly absorbed (nh ~ 3x10^(24) cm^-2) and has anintrinsic luminosity in the qso regime (l(2-10 kev) ~ 3 x 10^(44) erg s^-1).the 2-10 kev spectrum of iras 19254-7245 is remarkably hard (gamma~1.2), andpresents a strong iron line (ew ~0.7 kev), clearly suggesting that below 10 kevwe are seeing only reprocessed radiation. since the energy of the fe k emissionis found to be at ~6.7 kev, consistent with he-like fe, and its ew is too highto be explained in a starburst dominated scenario, we suggest that the 2--10kev emission of iras 19254-7245 is dominated by reflection/scattering fromhighly ionized matter. indeed, within this latter scenario we found that thephoton index of the illuminating source is gamma=1.87 (+0.11,-0.28), inexcellent agreement with the mean value found for radio quiet unobscured agn.

0906.1983	the sdss/xmm-newton quasar survey: correlation between x-ray spectral  slope and eddington ratio	we present a correlation between the 2-10 kev spectral slope gamma and theeddington ratio l/l_{edd} in a sample of ~400 sloan digital sky survey quasarswith available hard x-ray spectra from xmm-newton serendipitous observations.we find that the gamma-l/l_{edd} correlation is strongest in objects with blackhole (bh) masses determined from the hbeta line, and weaker (but still present)for those based on mg ii. an empirical non-linear correction of the mg ii-basedmasses, obtained by comparing the mass estimates in sdss quasars having bothhbeta and mg ii measurements, significantly increases the strength of thecorrelation. no correlation is found among objects with bh masses derived fromc iv, confirming that this line is not a reliable indicator of the bh mass. nosignificant correlation is found with the bolometric luminosity, while agamma-m_bh relation is present, though with a lower statistical significancethan between gamma and l/l_{edd}. our results imply a physical link between theaccretion efficiency in the (cold) accretion disc of agns and the physicalstatus of the (hot) corona responsible for the x-ray emission.

0907.1236	exploring the active galactic nucleus and starburst content of local  ultraluminous infrared galaxies through 5-8 micron spectroscopy	we present a 5-8 micron analysis of the spitzer-irs spectra of 71ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) with redshift z &lt; 0.15, devoted to thestudy of the role of active galactic nuclei (agn) and starbursts (sb) as thepower source of the extreme infrared emission. around 5 micron an agn is muchbrighter (by a factor 30) than a starburst of equal bolometric luminosity. thisallows us to detect the presence of even faint accretion-driven cores insideulirgs: signatures of agn activity are found in 70 per cent of our sample(50/71 sources). through a simple analytical model we are also able to obtain aquantitative estimate of the agn/sb contribution to the overall energy outputof each source. although the main fraction of ulirg luminosity is confirmed toarise from star formation events, the agn contribution is non-negligible (23per cent) and is shown to increase with luminosity. the existence of a ratherheterogeneous pattern in the composition and geometrical structure of the dustamong ulirgs is newly supported by the comparison between individual absorptionfeatures and continuum extinction.

0908.0268	agn/starburst connection in action: the half million second rgs spectrum  of ngc1365	we present a deep (~5.8 days) 0.3-2 kev high-resolution spectrum of ngc1365,collected with the reflection grating spectrometer (rgs) on board xmm-newton.the spectrum is dominated by strong recombination lines of he- and h-liketransitions from carbon to silicon, as well as by l transitions from fexvii.the continuum is strong, especially in the 10 to 20 angstrom, range. formalfits require two optically thin, collisionally ionised plasma components, withtemperatures ~300 and ~640 ev. however, they leave the bulk of the forbiddencomponents of the he-alpha ovii and nvi triplets unaccounted for. thesefeatures can be explained as being produced by photoionised gas. ngc1365 istherefore the first obscured agn, whose high-resolution x-ray spectrum requiresboth collisional ionisation and photoionisation. the relative weakness ofphotoionisation does not stem from the intrinsic weakness of its agn, whosex-ray luminosity is ~10^{42} erg/s. we suggest that it may instead come fromthe line-of-sight from the active nucleus to the nlr being blocked by opticallythick matter in the broad line region, at the same time responsible for thelarge observed variation of the column density obscuring the x-ray activenucleus. alternatively, ngc1365 could host a remarkably luminous nuclearstarburst when compared to the agn accretion power [abriged].

0908.0280	enhanced star formation in narrow line seyfert 1 agn revealed by spitzer	we present new low resolution spitzer mid-infrared spectroscopy of a sampleof 20 rosat selected local narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies (nls1s). we detectstrong agn continuum in all and clear pah emission in 70% of the sources. the6.2 micron pah luminosity spans three orders of magnitudes, from ~10^(39) erg/sto ~10^(42) erg/s providing strong evidence for intense ongoing star formationin the circumnuclear regions of these sources. using the irs/spitzer archive wegather a large number of additional nls1s and their broad line counterparts(bls1s) and constructed nls1 and bls1 sub-samples to compare them in variousways. the comparison shows a clear separation according to fwhm(h_beta) suchthat objects with narrower broad h_beta lines are the strongest pah emitters.we test this division in various ways trying to remove biases due to luminosityand aperture size. specifically, we find that star formation activity aroundnls1 agn is larger than around bls1 of the same agn luminosity. the aboveresult seems to hold over the entire range of distance and luminosity. moreoverthe star formation rate is higher in low black hole mass and high l/l_eddsystems indicating that black hole growth and star formation are occurringsimultaneously.

0909.5444	the highest resolution chandra view of photoionization and jet-cloud  interaction in the nuclear region of ngc 4151	we report high resolution imaging of the nucleus of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc4151 obtained with a 50 ks chandra hrc observation. the hrc image resolves theemission on spatial scales of 0.5", ~30 pc, showing an extended x-raymorphology overall consistent with the narrow line region (nlr) seen in opticalline emission. removal of the bright point-like nuclear source and imagedeconvolution techniques both reveal x-ray enhancements that closely match thesubstructures seen in the hubble space telescope [oiii] image and prominentknots in the radio jet. we find that most of the nlr clouds in ngc 4151 have[oiii] to soft x-ray ratio ~10, despite the distance of the clouds from thenucleus. this ratio is consistent with the values observed in nlrs of someseyfert 2 galaxies, which indicates a uniform ionization parameter even atlarge radii and a density decreasing as $r^{-2}$ as expected for a nuclear windscenario. the [oiii]/x-ray ratios at the location of radio knots show an excessof x-ray emission, suggesting shock heating in addition to photoionization. weexamine various mechanisms for the x-ray emission and find that, in contrast tojet-related x-ray emission in more powerful agn, the observed jet parameters inngc 4151 are inconsistent with synchrotron emission, synchrotron self-compton,inverse compton of cmb photons or galaxy optical light. instead, our resultsfavor thermal emission from the interaction between radio outflow and nlr gasclouds as the origin for the x-ray emission associated with the jet. thissupports previous claims that frequent jet-ism interaction may explain why jetsin seyfert galaxies appear small, slow, and thermally dominated, distinct fromthose kpc scale jets in the radio galaxies.

0911.0474	the x-ray energy dependence of the relation between optical and x-ray  emission in quasars	we develop a new approach to the well-studied anti-correlation between theoptical-to-x-ray spectral index, alpha_ox, and the monochromatic opticalluminosity, l_opt. by cross-correlating the sdss dr5 quasar catalog with thexmm-newton archive, we create a sample of 327 quasars with x-ray s/n &gt; 6, whereboth optical and x-ray spectra are available. this allows alpha_ox to bedefined at arbitrary frequencies, rather than the standard 2500 angstroms and 2kev. we find that while the choice of optical wavelength does not stronglyinfluence the alpha_ox-l_opt relation, the slope of the relation does depend onthe choice of x-ray energy. the slope of the relation becomes steeper whenalpha_ox is defined at low (~ 1 kev) x-ray energies. this change is significantwhen compared to the slope predicted by a decrease in the baseline over whichalpha_ox is defined. the slopes are also marginally flatter than predicted athigh (~ 10 kev) x-ray energies. partial correlation tests show that while theprimary driver of alpha_ox is l_opt, the eddington ratio correlates stronglywith alpha_ox when l_opt is taken into account, so accretion rate may helpexplain these results. we combine the alpha_ox-l_opt and gamma -l_bol/l_eddrelations to naturally explain two results: 1) the existence of the gamma-l_xrelation as reported in young et al. (2009) and 2) the lack of a gamma-l_optrelation. the consistency of the optical/x-ray correlations establishes a morecomplete framework for understanding the relation between quasar emissionmechanisms. we also discuss two correlations with the hard x-ray bolometriccorrection, which we show correlates with both alpha_ox and eddington ratio.this confirms that an increase in accretion rate correlates with a decrease inthe fraction of up-scattered disk photons.

1003.0858	the role of nuclear activity as the power source of ultraluminous  infrared galaxies	we present the results of a 5-8 micron spectral analysis performed on thelargest sample of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) selected sofar, consisting of 164 objects up to a redshift of ~0.35. the unprecedentedsensitivity of the infrared spectrograph onboard spitzer allowed us to developan effective diagnostic method to disentangle the active galactic nucleus (agn)and starburst (sb) contribution to this class of objects. the intrinsicbolometric corrections are estimated for both the components, in order toobtain the relative agn/sb contribution to the total luminosity of each source.our main results are the following: 1) the agn detection rate among localulirgs amounts up to 70 per cent, with 113/164 convincing detections within oursample, while the global agn/sb power balance is ~1/3. 2) a general agreementis found with optical classification; however, among the objects with nospectral signatures of nuclear activity, our ir diagnostics find a subclass ofelusive, highly obscured agn. 3) we analyse the correlation between nuclearactivity and ir luminosity, recovering the well-known trend of growing agnsignificance as a function of the overall energy output of the system: theaverage agn contribution rises from ~10 to ~60 per cent across the ulirgluminosity range. 4) we confirm that the agn content is larger in compactsystems, but the link between activity and evolutionary stage is rather loose.5) by analysing a control sample of ir-luminous galaxies around z ~ 1, we findevidence for only minor changes with redshift of the large-scale spectralproperties of the agn and sb components. this underlines the potential of ourmethod as a straightforward and quantitative agn/sb diagnostic tool forulirg-like systems at high redshift as well.

1003.6133	revisit short term x-ray spectral variability of ngc 4151 with chandra	we present new x-ray spectral data for the seyfert 1 nucleus in ngc 4151observed with chandra for 200 ks. a significant acis pileup is present,resulting in a non-linear count rate variation during the observation. withpileup corrected spectral fitting, we are able to recover the spectralparameters and find consistency with those derived from unpiled events in theacis readout streak and outer region from the bright nucleus. the absorptioncorrected 2-10 kev flux of the nucleus varied between 6e-11 and 1e-10 ergs^{-1} cm^{-2}. similar to earlier chandra studies of ngc 4151 at a historicallow state, the photon indices derived from the same absorbed power-law modelare \gamma~0.7-0.9. however, we show that \gamma is highly dependent on theadopted spectral models. fitting the power-law continuum with a comptonreflection component gives \gamma~1.1. by including passage of non-uniformx-ray obscuring clouds, we can reproduce the apparent flat spectral states with\gamma~1.7, typical for seyfert 1 agns. the same model also fits the hardspectra from previous asca "long look" observation of ngc 4151 in the lowestflux state. the spectral variability during our observation can be interpretedas variations in intrinsic soft continuum flux relative to a compton reflectioncomponent that is from distant cold material and constant on short time scale,or variations of partially covering absorber in the line of sight towards thenucleus. an ionized absorber model with ionization parameter \log\xi ~ 0.8-1.1can also fit the low-resolution acis spectra. if the partial covering model iscorrect, adopting a black hole mass m_{bh} ~ 4.6e+7 msun we constrain thedistance of the obscuring cloud from the central black hole to be r&lt;~9light-days, consistent with the size of broad emission line region of ngc 4151from optical reverberation mapping.

1004.1442	the final verdict by xmm-newton: the x-ray obscured seyfert galaxy  ngc5506 has a broad fe k-alpha line	we present the first unambiguous evidence of a broad (gaussian width ~330 ev)component of the iron k-alpha fluorescent emission line in the x-ray obscurednarrow line seyfert 1 galaxy ngc5506. this is the main results of aspectroscopic monitoring campaign on this source performed with the xmm-newtonobservatory between february 2001 and january 2009. the broad line lacksextreme redwards skewness. if modelled with a relativistic component, theprofile of the line is consistent with a flat emissivity radial dependence(alpha~1.9). the disk inclination (~40 degrees) is nominally larger thentypically observed in unobscured agn, in agreement with most measurements ofbroadened iron lines in seyfert 2 galaxies. the quality of the data allows usto decompose the full iron emission line complex, and to study its long-term(timescales of weeks to years) variability pattern. the intensity of theneutral and narrow iron k-alpha core remains constant during the monitoringcampaign. this indicates that the optically thick gas responsible for thenon-relativistic reprocessing of the primary agn continuum in ngc5506 isprobably located in the torus rather than in the optical broad line region.

1005.3365	"comets" orbiting a black hole	we use a long (300 ksec), continuous suzaku x-ray observation of the activenucleus in ngc1365 to investigate the structure of the circumnuclear blr cloudsthrough their occultation of the x-ray source. the variations of the absorbingcolumn density and of the covering factor indicate that the clouds surroundingthe black hole are far from having a spherical geometry (as sometimes assumed),instead they have a strongly elongated and cometary shape, with a dense head(n=10^11 cm^-3) and an expanding, dissolving tail. we infer that the cometarytails must be longer than a few times 10^13 cm and their opening angle must besmaller than a few degrees. we suggest that the cometary shape may be a commonfeature of blr clouds in general, but which has been difficult to recognizeobservationally so far. the cometary shape may originate from shocks andhydrodynamical instabilities generated by the supersonic motion of the blrclouds into the intracloud medium. as a consequence of the mass loss into theirtail, we infer that the blr clouds probably have a lifetime of only a fewmonths, implying that they must be continuously replenished. we also find alarge, puzzling discrepancy (two orders of magnitude) between the mass of theblr inferred from the properties of the absorbing clouds and the mass of theblr inferred from photoionization models; we discuss the possible solutions tothis discrepancy.

1008.5067	x-ray absorption by broad line region clouds in mrk 766	we present a new analysis of a 9-day long xmm-newton monitoring of the narrowline seyfert 1 galaxy mrk 766. we show that the strong changes in spectralshape which occurred during this observation can be interpreted as due to broadline region clouds crossing the line of sight to the x-ray source. within theoccultation scenario, the spectral and temporal analysis of the eclipsesprovides precise estimates of the geometrical structure, location and physicalproperties of the absorbing clouds. in particular, we show that these cloudshave cores with column densities of at least a few 10^23 cm^-2 and velocitiesin the plane of the sky of the order of thousands km/s. the three differenteclipses monitored by xmm-newton suggest a broad range in cloud velocities (bya factor ~4-5). moreover, two iron absorption lines clearly associated witheach eclipse suggest the presence of highly ionized gas around the obscuringclouds, and an outflow component of the velocity spanning from 3,000 to 15,000km/s

1010.2037	[o iii] equivalent width and orientation effects in quasars	the flux of the [oiii] line is considered to be a good indicator of thebolometric emission of quasars. the observed continuum emission from theaccretion disc should instead be strongly dependent on the inclination angletheta between the disc axis and the line of sight. based on this, theequivalent width (ew) of [oiii] should provide a direct measure of theta. herewe analyze the distribution of ew([oiii]) in a sample of ~6,000 sdss quasars,and find that it can be accurately reproduced assuming a relatively smallintrinsic scatter and a random distribution of inclination angles. this resulthas several implications: 1) it is a direct proof of the disc-like emission ofthe optical continuum of quasars; 2) the value of ew([oiii]) can be used as aproxy of the inclination, to correct the measured continuum emission and thenestimate the bolometric luminosity of quasars; 3) the presence of almostedge-on discs among broad line quasars implies that the accretion disc is notaligned with the circumnuclear absorber, and/or that the covering fraction ofthe latter is rather small. finally, we show that a similar analysis of ewdistributions of broad lines (hbeta, mg ii, c iv) provides no evidence ofinclination effects, suggesting a disc-like geometry of the broad emission lineregion.

1012.3073	the spitzer/irac view of black hole - bulge scaling relations	we present a mid-ir investigation of the scaling relations betweensupermassive black hole masses (mbh) and the structural parameters of the hostspheroids in local galaxies. the work is based on two-dimensional bulge-diskdecompositions of spitzer/irac 3.6 um images of 57 galaxies with mbh estimates.our estimates of effective radii (re) and surface brightnesses, combined withvelocity dispersions (sigma) from the literature, define a fp relationconsistent with previous determinations but doubling the observed range in re.none of our galaxies is an outlier of the fp, demonstrating the accuracy of ourbulge-disk decomposition which also allows us to independently identifypseudobulges in our sample. we calibrate m/l at 3.6 um by using the tightmdyn-lbul relation (~0.1 dex of rms) and find that no color corrections arerequired to estimate the stellar mass. the 3.6 um luminosity is thus the besttracer of mstar yet studied. we then explore the connection between mbh andbulge structural parameters (luminosity, mass, effective radius). we find tightcorrelations of mbh with both 3.6 um bulge luminosity and dynamical mass(mbh/mdyn~1/1000), with rms of ~0.35 dex, similar to the mbh-sigma relation.our results are consistent with previous determinations at shorter wavelengths.by using our calibrated m/l, we rescale mbh-lbul to obtain the mbh-mstarrelation, which can be used as the local reference for high-z studies whichprobe the cosmic evolution of mbh-galaxy relations and where the stellar massis inferred directly from luminosity measurements. the analysis of pseudobulgesshows that 4 out of 9 lie on the scaling relations within the observed scatter,while those with small mbh are significantly displaced. we explore thedifferent origins for such behavior, while considering the possibility ofnuclear morphological components not reproduced by our two-dimensionaldecomposition.

1103.3212	compton-thick active galactic nuclei inside local ultraluminous infrared  galaxies	we present the x-ray analysis of the most luminous obscured active galacticnuclei (agn) inside local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs). our sampleconsists of ten sources, harbouring agn components with estimated luminosity inexcess of ~10^12 l_sun and yet unidentified at optical wavelengths because oftheir large obscuration. according to the chandra and xmm-newton spectra, onlyin two cases out of ten clear agn signatures are detected at 2-10 kev in theshape of reflected emission. the x-ray flux from the starburst (sb) components,instead, is always broadly consistent with the expectations based on their iremission. the most convincing explanation for the missing agn detections istherefore the compton-thickness of the x-ray absorber. in general, thecombination of our mid-ir and x-ray spectral analysis suggests that theenvironment surrounding the agn component in ulirgs is much richer in gas anddust than in ordinary active galaxies, and the degree of agn absorption can betentatively related to the sb intensity, indicating a strong interactionbetween the two processes and supporting the ulirg/quasar evolutionary scheme.

1105.2318	probing general relativistic effects during agn x-ray eclipses	long x-ray observations of bright active galactic nuclei show that x-rayeclipses, with durations from a few hours to a few days, are rather common.this opens up a new window of opportunity in the search for signatures ofrelativistic effects in agns: an obscuring cloud covers/uncovers differentparts of the accretion disc at different times, allowing a direct check of theexpected pattern of disc emission. in particular, the combination ofgravitational redshift and relativistic doppler boosting should imply strongdifferences between the receding and approaching parts of an inclined thindisc. at present, these effects may be already detectable with a "lucky"xmm-newton or suzaku observation of a complete eclipse by a compton-thick cloud(a rare, but not impossible-to-see event). in the future, higher sensitivityobservatories will be able to perform these tests easily on tens of agns. thiswill provide a powerful and direct way to test extreme gravity, and to probethe structure of agns in the close vicinity of the central black holes.

1109.0483	a close nuclear black hole pair in the spiral galaxy ngc 3393	the current picture of galaxy evolution advocates co-evolution of galaxiesand their nuclear massive black holes (mbhs), through accretion and merging.quasar pairs (6,000-300,000 light-years separation) exemplify the first stagesof this gravitational interaction. the final stages, through binary mbhs andfinal collapse with gravitational wave emission, are consistent with thesub-light-year separation mbhs inferred from optical spectra andlight-variability of two quasars. the double active nuclei of few nearbygalaxies with disrupted morphology and intense star formation (e.g., ngc 6240and mkn 463; ~2,400 and ~12,000 light-years separation respectively)demonstrate the importance of major mergers of equal mass spirals in thisevolution, leading to an elliptical galaxy, as in the case of the double radionucleus (~15 light-years separation) elliptical 0402+379. minor mergers ofgalaxies with a smaller companion should be a more common occurrence, evolvinginto spiral galaxies with active mbh pairs, but have hitherto not been seen.here we report the presence of two active mbhs, separated by ~430 light-years,in the seyfert galaxy ngc 3393. the regular spiral morphology and predominantlyold circum-nuclear stellar population of this galaxy, and the closeness of thembhs embedded in the bulge, suggest the result of minor merger evolution.

1202.1279	the x-ray reflector in ngc 4945: a time and space resolved portrait	we present a time, spectral and imaging analysis of the x-ray reflector inngc 4945, which reveals its geometrical and physical structure withunprecedented detail. ngc 4945 hosts one of the brightest agn in the sky above10 kev, but it is only visible through its reflected/scattered emission below10 kev, due to absorption by a column density of ~4\times10^24 cm-2. a newsuzaku campaign of 5 observations spanning ~6 months, together with pastxmm-newton and chandra observations, show a remarkable constancy (within &lt;10%)of the reflected component. instead, swift-bat reveals strong intrinsicvariability on time scales longer than one year. modeling the circumnuclear gasas a thin cylinder with the axis on the plane of the sky, we show that thereflector is at a distance &gt;30-50 pc, well within the imaging capabilities ofchandra at the distance of ngc 4945 (1"~18 pc). accordingly, the chandraimaging reveals a resolved, flattened, ~150 pc-long clumpy structure, whosespectrum is fully due to cold reflection of the primary agn emission. theclumpiness may explain the small covering factor derived from the spectral andvariability properties.

0710.5220	the x-ray emission of the most luminous 3cr radio sources	we investigate the x-ray properties of the most luminous radio sources in the3cr catalogue, in order to assess if they are similar to the most luminousradio quiet quasars, for instance in the x-ray normalization with respect tothe optical luminosity, or in the distribution of the absorption columndensity. we have selected the (optically identified) 3cr radio sources whose178-mhz monochromatic luminosity lies in the highest factor-of-three bin. the 4most luminous objects had already been observed in x rays. of the remaining 16,we observed with xmm-newton 4 randomly chosen, optical type 1s, and 4 type 2s.all targets have been detected. the optical-to-xray spectral index, alphaox,can be computed only for the type 1s and, in agreement with previous studies,is found to be flatter than in radio quiet quasars of similar luminosity.however, the compton thin type 2s have an absorption corrected x-ray luminositysystematically lower than the type 1s, by a factor which makes them consistentwith the radio quiet alphaox. within the limited statistics, the compton thickobjects seem to have a reflected component more luminous than the compton thinones. the extra x-ray component observed in type 1 radio loud quasars is beamedfor intrinsic causes, and is not collimated by the absorbing torus as is thecase for the (intrinsically isotropic) disk emission. the extra component canbe associated with a relativistic outflow, provided that the flow opening angleand the doppler beaming factor are 1/5 - 1/7 radians.

1210.5949	decoupling absorption and continuum variability in the seyfert 2 ngc  4507	we present the results of the suzaku observation of the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc4507. this source is one of the x-ray brightest compton-thin seyfert 2s and acandidate for a variable absorber. suzaku caught ngc 4507 in a highly absorbedstate characterised by a high column density (nh \sim8 x10^23 cm^-2), a strongreflected component (r\sim 1.9) and a high equivalent width fe k alpha emissionline (ew\sim 500 ev). the fe k alpha emission line is unresolved at theresolution of the suzaku ccds (sigma &lt; 30 ev or fwhm &lt; 3000 km s^-1) and mostlikely originates in a distant absorber. the fe k beta emission line is alsoclearly detected and its intensity is marginally higher than the theoreticalvalue for low ionisation fe. a comparison with previous observations performedwith xmm-newton and bepposax reveals that the x-ray spectral curvature changeson a timescale of a few months. we analysed all these historical observations,with standard models as well as with a most recent model for a toroidalreprocessor and found that the main driver of the observed 2-10 kev spectralvariability is a change of the line-of-sight obscuration, varying from\sim4x10^23 cm^-2 to \sim9 x 10^23 cm^-2. the primary continuum is alsovariable, although its photon index does not appear to vary, while the fe kalpha line and reflection component are consistent with being constant acrossthe observations. this suggests the presence of a rather constant reprocessorand that the observed line of sight nh variability is either due to a certaindegree of clumpiness of the putative torus or due to the presence of a secondclumpy absorber.

1212.0772	an examination of the spectral variability in ngc 1365 with suzaku	we present jointly analyzed data from three deep suzaku observations of ngc1365. these high signal-to-noise spectra enable us to examine the nature ofthis variable, obscured agn in unprecedented detail on timescales ranging fromhours to years. we find that, in addition to the power-law continuum andabsorption from ionized gas seen in most agn, inner disk reflection andvariable absorption from neutral gas within the broad emission line region areboth necessary components in all three observations. we confirm the clumpynature of the cold absorbing gas, though we note that occultations of the innerdisk and corona are much more pronounced in the high-flux state (2008) than inthe low-flux state (2010) of the source. the onset and duration of the "dips"in the x-ray light curve in 2010 are both significantly longer than in 2008,however, indicating that either the distance to the gas from the black hole islarger, or that the nature of the gas has changed between epochs. we also notesignificant variations in the power-law flux over timescales similar to thecold absorber, both within and between the three observations. the warmabsorber does not vary significantly within observations, but does showvariations in column density of a factor of more than 10 on timescales lessthan 2 weeks that seem unrelated to the changes in the continuum, reflection orcold absorber. by assuming a uniform iron abundance for the reflection andabsorption, we have also established that an iron abundance of roughly 3.5times the solar value is sufficient to model the broad-band spectrum withoutinvoking an additional partial-covering absorber. such a measurement isconsistent with previous published constraints from the 2008 suzaku observationalone, and with results from other seyfert agn in the literature.

1302.7002	a rapidly spinning supermassive black hole at the centre of ngc 1365	broad x-ray emission lines from neutral and partially ionized iron observedin active galaxies have been interpreted as fluorescence produced by thereflection of hard x-rays off the inner edge of an accretion disk. in thismodel, line broadening and distortion result from rapid rotation andrelativistic effects near the black hole, the line shape being sensitive to itsspin. alternative models in which the distortions result from absorption byintervening structures provide an equally good description of the data, andthere has been no general agreement on which is correct. recent claims that theblack hole (2e6 solar masses) at the centre of the galaxy ngc 1365 is rotatingat close to its maximum possible speed rest on the assumption of relativisticreflection. here we report x-ray observations of ngc 1365 that reveal therelativistic disk features through broadened fe line emission and an associatedcompton scattering excess of 10-30 kev. using temporal and spectral analyses,we disentangle continuum changes due to time-variable absorption fromreflection, which we find arises from a region within 2.5 gravitational radiiof the rapidly spinning black hole. absorption-dominated models that do notinclude relativistic disk reflection can be ruled out both statistically and onphysical grounds.

1306.2330	the hot and energetic universe: astrophysics of feedback in local agn	understanding the astrophysics of feedback in active galactic nuclei (agn) iskey to understanding the growth and co-evolution of supermassive black holesand galaxies. agn-driven winds/outflows are potentially the most effective wayof transporting energy and momentum from the nuclear scales to the host galaxy,quenching star formation by sweeping away the gas reservoir. key questions inthis field are: 1) how do accretion disks around black holes launchwinds/outflows, and how much energy do these carry? 2) how are the energy andmetals accelerated in winds/outflows transferred and deposited into thecircumgalactic medium? x-ray observations are a unique way to address thesequestions because they probe the phase of the outflows which carries most ofthe kinetic energy. we show how a high throughput, high spectral resolutioninstrument like the x-ray integral field unit (x-ifu) on athena+ will allow usto address these questions by determining the physical parameters (ionizationstate, density, temperature, abundances, velocities, geometry, etc.) of theoutflows on a dynamical time-scale, in a broad sample of nearby bright agn. thex-ifu will also allow direct spectral imaging of the impact of these winds onthe host galaxy for local agn, forming a template for understanding agn athigher redshifts where wind shocks cannot be resolved.

1306.3500	weak hard x-ray emission from two broad absorption line quasars observed  with nustar: compton-thick absorption or intrinsic x-ray weakness?	we present nustar hard x-ray observations of two x-ray weak broad absorptionline (bal) quasars, pg 1004+130 (radio loud) and pg 1700+518 (radio quiet).many bal quasars appear x-ray weak, probably due to absorption by the shieldinggas between the nucleus and the accretion-disk wind. the two targets are amongthe optically brightest bal quasars, yet they are known to be significantlyx-ray weak at rest-frame 2-10 kev (16-120 times fainter than typical quasars).we would expect to obtain ~400-600 hard x-ray (&gt;10 kev) photons with nustar,provided that these photons are not significantly absorbed (nh&lt;1e24 cm^{-2}).however, both bal quasars are only detected in the softer nustar bands (e.g.,4-20 kev) but not in its harder bands (e.g., 20-30 kev), suggesting that eitherthe shielding gas is highly compton-thick or the two targets are intrinsicallyx-ray weak. we constrain the column densities for both to be nh~7e24 cm^{-2} ifthe weak hard x-ray emission is caused by obscuration from the shielding gas.we discuss a few possibilities for how pg 1004+130 could have compton-thickshielding gas without strong fe k? line emission; dilution from jet-linkedx-ray emission is one likely explanation. we also discuss the intrinsic x-rayweakness scenario based on a coronal-quenching model relevant to the shieldinggas and disk wind of bal quasars. motivated by our nustar results, we perform achandra stacking analysis with the large bright quasar survey bal quasar sampleand place statistical constraints upon the fraction of intrinsically x-ray weakbal quasars; this fraction is likely 17-40%.

1402.4811	{\it nustar} reveals an intrinsically x-ray weak broad absorption line  quasar in the ultraluminous infrared galaxy markarian 231	we present high-energy (3--30 kev) {\it nustar} observations of the nearestquasar, the ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ulirg) markarian 231 (mrk 231),supplemented with new and simultaneous low-energy (0.5--8 kev) data from {\itchandra}. the source was detected, though at much fainter levels thanpreviously reported, likely due to contamination in the large apertures ofprevious non-focusing hard x-ray telescopes. the full band (0.5--30 kev) x-rayspectrum suggests the active galactic nucleus (agn) in mrk 231 is absorbed by apatchy and compton-thin (n$_{\rm h} \sim1.2^{+0.3}_{-0.3}\times10^{23}$cm$^{-2}$) column. the intrinsic x-ray luminosity (l$_{\rm 0.5-30kev}\sim1.0\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{1}$) is extremely weak relative to thebolometric luminosity where the 2--10 kev to bolometric luminosity ratio is$\sim$0.03% compared to the typical values of 2--15%. additionally, mrk 231 hasa low x-ray-to-optical power law slope ($\alpha_{\rm ox}\sim-1.7$). it is alocal example of a low-ionization broad absorption line (lobal) quasar that isintrinsically x-ray weak. the weak ionizing continuum may explain the lack ofmid-infrared [o iv], [ne v], and [ne vi] fine-structure emission lines whichare present in sources with otherwise similar agn properties. we argue that theintrinsic x-ray weakness may be a result of the super-eddington accretionoccurring in the nucleus of this ulirg, and may also be naturally related tothe powerful wind event seen in mrk 231, a merger remnant escaping from itsdusty cocoon.

1404.3561	the broad band spectral variability of mcg-6-30-15 observed by nustar  and xmm-newton	mcg-6-30-15, at a distance of 37 mpc (z=0.008), is the archetypical seyfert 1galaxy showing very broad fe k$\alpha$ emission. we present results from ajoint nustar and xmm-newton observational campaign that, for the first time,allows a sensitive, time-resolved spectral analysis from 0.35 kev up to 80 kev.the strong variability of the source is best explained in terms of intrinsicx-ray flux variations and in the context of the light bending model: theprimary, variable emission is reprocessed by the accretion disk, which producessecondary, less variable, reflected emission. the broad fe k$\alpha$ profileis, as usual for this source, well explained by relativistic effects occurringin the innermost regions of the accretion disk around a rapidly rotating blackhole. we also discuss the alternative model in which the broadening of the fek$\alpha$ is due to the complex nature of the circumnuclear absorbingstructure. even if this model cannot be ruled out, it is disfavored onstatistical grounds. we also detected an occultation event likely caused by blrclouds crossing the line of sight.

1404.5620	nustar and xmm-newton observations of ngc 1365: extreme absorption  variability and a constant inner accretion disk	we present a spectral analysis of four coordinated nustar+xmm-newtonobservations of the seyfert galaxy ngc 1365. these exhibit an extreme level ofspectral variability, which is primarily due to variable line-of-sightabsorption, revealing relatively unobscured states in this source for the firsttime. despite the diverse range of absorption states, each of the observationsdisplays the same characteristic signatures of relativistic reflection from theinner accretion disk. through time-resolved spectroscopy we find that thestrength of the relativistic iron line and the compton reflection hump relativeto the intrinsic continuum are well correlated, as expected if they are twoaspects of the same broadband reflection spectrum. we apply self-consistentdisk reflection models to these time-resolved spectra in order to constrain theinner disk parameters, allowing for variable, partially covering absorption toaccount for the vastly different absorption states observed. each of the fourobservations is treated independently to test the consistency of the resultsobtained for the black hole spin and the disk inclination, which should notvary on observable timescales. we find both the spin and the inclinationdetermined from the reflection spectrum to be consistent, confirming ngc 1365hosts a rapidly rotating black hole; in all cases the dimensionless spinparameter is constrained to be a* &gt; 0.97 (at 90% statistical confidence orbetter).

1405.4660	search for x-ray occultations in active galactic nuclei	recent time-resolved spectral studies of a few active galactic nuclei in hardx-rays revealed occultations of the x-ray primary source probably by broad lineregion (blr) clouds. an important open question on the structure of thecircumnuclear medium of agn is whether this phenomenon is common, i.e. whethera significant fraction of the x-ray absorption in agn is due to blr clouds.here we present the first attempt to perform this kind of analysis in ahomogeneous way, on a statistically representative sample of agn, consisting ofthe ~40 brightest sources with long xmm-newton and/or suzaku observations. wedescribe our method, based on a simple analysis of hardness-ratio light curves,and its validation through a complete spectroscopic analysis of a few cases. wefind that x-ray eclipses, most probably due to clouds at the distance of theblr, are common in sources where the expected occultation time is compatiblewith the observation time, while they are not found in sources with longerestimated occultation times. overall, our results show that occultations by blrclouds may be responsible for most of the observed x-ray spectral variabilityat energies higher than 2 kev, on time scales longer than a few ks.

1506.03096	ionised outflows in z $\sim$ 2.4 quasar host galaxies	agn-driven outflows are invoked by galaxy evolutionary models to quench starformation and to explain the origin of the relations observed locally betweensuper massive black holes and their host galaxies. this work aims to detect thepresence of extended ionised outflows in luminous quasars where we expect themaximum activity both in star formation and in black hole accretion. currently,there are only a few studies based on spatially resolved observations ofoutflows at high redshift, $z&gt;2$. we analyse a sample of six luminous (${\rml&gt;10^{47} \ erg/s}$) quasars at $z\sim2.4$, observed in h-band using thenear-ir integral field spectrometer sinfoni at vlt. we perform a kinematicanalysis of the [oiii] emission line at $\lambda = 5007\aa$. [oiii] has acomplex gas kinematic, with blue-shifted velocities of a few hundreds of km/sand line widths up to 1500 km/s. using the spectroastrometric method we infersize of the ionised outflows of up to $\sim$2 kpc. the properties of theionised outflows, mass outflow rate, momentum rate and kinetic power, arecorrelated with the agn luminosity. the increase in outflow rate withincreasing agn luminosity is consistent with the idea that a luminous agnpushes away the surrounding gas through fast outflows driven by radiationpressure, which depends on the emitted luminosity. we derive mass outflow ratesof about 6-700 m$_{\odot}$/yr for our sample, which are lower than thoseobserved in molecular outflows. indeed physical properties of ionised outflowsshow dependences on agn luminosity which are similar to those of molecularoutflows but indicating that the mass of ionised gas is smaller than that ofthe molecular one. alternatively, this discrepancy between ionised andmolecular outflows could be explained with different acceleration mechanisms.

1508.01198	the chandra/hetg view of ngc 1365 in a compton-thick state	we present the analysis of a chandra high-energy transmission grating (hetg)observation of the local seyfert galaxy ngc 1365. the source, well known forits dramatic x-ray spectral variability, was caught in a reflection-dominated,compton-thick state. the high spatial resolution afforded by chandra allowed usto isolate the soft x-ray emission from the active nucleus, neglecting most ofthe contribution from the kpc-scale starburst ring. the hetg spectra thusrevealed a wealth of he- and h-like lines from photoionized gas, whereas inlarger aperture observations these are almost exclusively produced throughcollisional ionization in the circumnuclear environment. once the residualthermal component is accounted for, the emission-line properties of thephotoionized region close to the hard x-ray continuum source indicate that ngc1365 has some similarities to the local population of obscured active galaxies.in spite of the limited overall data quality, several soft x-ray lines seem tohave fairly broad profiles (~800-1300 km/s full-width at half maximum), and arange of outflow velocities (up to ~1600 km/s, but possibly reaching a fewthousands km/s) appears to be involved. at higher energies, the k$\alpha$fluorescence line from neutral iron is resolved with &gt; 99 per cent confidence,and its width of ~3000 km/s points to an origin from the same broad-line regionclouds responsible for eclipsing the x-ray source and likely shielding thenarrow-line region.

1508.04464	the magnum survey: positive feedback in the nuclear region of ngc 5643  suggested by muse	we study the ionization and kinematics of the ionized gas in the nuclearregion of the barred seyfert 2 galaxy ngc~5643 using muse integral fieldobservations in the framework of the magnum (measuring active galactic nucleiunder muse microscope) survey. the data were used to identify regions withdifferent ionization conditions and to map the gas density and the dustextinction. we find evidence for a double sided ionization cone, possiblycollimated by a dusty structure surrounding the nucleus. at the center of theionization cone, outflowing ionized gas is revealed as a blueshifted,asymmetric wing of the [oiii] emission line, up to projected velocityv(10)~-450 km/s. the outflow is also seen as a diffuse, low luminosity radioand x-ray jet, with similar extension. the outflowing material points in thedirection of two clumps characterized by prominent line emission with spectratypical of hii regions, located at the edge of the dust lane of the bar. wepropose that the star formation in the clumps is due to `positive feedback'induced by gas compression by the nuclear outflow, providing the firstcandidate for outflow induced star formation in a seyfert-like radio quiet agn.this suggests that positive feedback may be a relevant mechanism in shaping theblack hole-host galaxy coevolution.

0806.2410	amaze. i. the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation at z&gt;3	we present initial results of an eso-vlt large programme (amaze) aimed atdetermining the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation at z&gt;3 by means ofdeep near-ir spectroscopy. gas metallicities are measured, for an initialsample of nine star forming galaxies at z~3.5, by means of optical nebularlines redshifted into the near-ir. stellar masses are accurately determined byusing spitzer-irac data, which sample the rest-frame near-ir stellar light inthese distant galaxies. when compared with previous surveys, themass-metallicity relation inferred at z~3.5 shows an evolution much strongerthan observed at lower redshifts. the evolution is prominent even in massivegalaxies, indicating that z~3 is an epoch of major action in terms of starformation and metal enrichment also for massive systems. there are alsoindications that the metallicity evolution of low mass galaxies is strongerrelative to high mass systems, an effect which can be considered the chemicalversion of the galaxy downsizing. the mass-metallicity relation observed atz~3.5 is difficult to reconcile with the predictions of some hierarchicalevolutionary models. such discrepancies suggest that at z&gt;3 galaxies areassembled mostly with relatively un-evolved sub-units, i.e. small galaxies withlow star formation efficiency. the bulk of the star formation and metallicityevolution probably occurs once small galaxies are already assembled into biggersystems.

astro-ph;0001107	the variability of the seyfert galaxy ngc 2992: the case for a revived  agn	we report the transition to an active state of the nucleus in the seyfert 1.9galaxy ngc 2992, discovered by means of new hard x-ray data. while the 2-10 kevflux declined by a factor of ~ 20 from 1978 to 1994, two recent bepposaxobservations in 1997 and in 1998 caught the nuclear emission raising back tothe same level of activity observed in 1978.  in both bepposax observations the x-ray spectrum of the source is wellrepresented by a power law with spectral index gamma ~ 1.7, absorbed by acolumn density of n_h ~ 10^{22} cm^{-2} and characterized by a prominent ironk\alpha line. while in the second bepposax data set the line properties appearto be consistent with those expected from accretion disc models, in the firstbepposax data set the iron feature is rather peculiar. the broadening is notsignificant and the line energy is e_{k\alpha}=6.62 +/- 0.07 kev, indicatingemission from highly ionized iron. the line has too high equivalent width (~700 ev) to be produced by a hot scattering medium. by comparing these data withdata previously in the literature, we interpret the spectral and flux changesin terms of different phases of rebuilding an accretion disc. the timescale forthe disc rebuilding is estimated to range between 1 and 5 years.  the x-ray data are complemented with optical and near-infrared followupspectra taken 1.5 months after the discovery of the x-ray burst. the spectraare characterized by prominent broad emission lines. there is also evidence forhot dust emission in the h and k bands that, however, is probably still in theprocess of increasing.

astro-ph;0002447	optically dim counterparts of hard x-ray selected agns	we present near-ir photometry and imaging observations of a small sample ofsources identified in the bepposax 5-10 kev survey (hellas) which resolves ~20-30% of the x-ray background at these energies. the near-ir data are combinedwith optical spectra and photometry. only 40% of the sources in our sample havethe blue, power law continuum typical of color-selected qsos. the remaining 60%are dominated by a galactic component which, on the basis of the continuumcolors and shape, have ages ranging from 10^9 to 10^10 years. the images showthat the blue qsos are pointlike at our angular resolution, while all the othersources are extended, consistent with their spectral appearance and lowredshift. since down to r=20 only about two thirds of the hellas sources have acounterpart, the preliminary hellas census comprises in roughly equal parts: i)blue qsos (mostly at high redshifts); ii) optically dim, galaxy-dominatedactive nuclei (mostly at modest redshifts); and iii) empty fields (possiblyhighly absorbed qsos at high redshifts).

astro-ph;0002460	the hard x-ray emission of luminous infrared galaxies	we present a study of the hard x-ray properties of a sample that includes allthe luminous infrared galaxies (ligs, l_ir &gt; 10^11 l_sun) observed in the 2-10kev energy band (new and archival data). we find that a significant fraction ofthe sources optically classified as agns do not show any indication of nuclearactivity in the x rays, thus suggesting heavy absorption along our line ofsight. the absence of strong emission in the 20-200 kev band in a subsample ofligs observed with bepposax suggests that in many cases these sources arecompletely compton thick (n_h &gt; 10^25 cm^(-2)). from a comparison between theinfrared and the x-ray emission we deduce that the mid-ir emission is absorbedby a lower column density than the x-ray emission or, alternatively, that thedust-to-gas ratio is lower than galactic. we describe a simple model thatreproduces the ir-x correlation by means of mixed agn and starburstcontributions and we compare the predictions of this model with theobservational data at x-ray and optical wavelengths. finally, we discuss thebiases that affect the currently available samples of ligs and briefly analyzea small unbiased sample, finding that at least 50% of the sources host a (weak)agn.

astro-ph;0006233	sub-mm and x-ray background: two unrelated phenomena?	obscured agns are thought to contribute a large fraction of the hard x-raybackground (2-10 kev), and have also been proposed as the powerhouse of afraction of the scuba sources which make most of the background at 850um, thusproviding a link between the two spectral windows. we have tackled this issueby comparing data at 2-10 kev and at 850um for a sample of 34 sources at fluxes(or limiting fluxes) which resolve most of the background in the two bands. wepresent here new scuba observations, and new correlations between separate datasets retrieved from the literature. similar correlations presented by othersare added for completeness. none of the 11 hard x-ray (2-10 kev) sources has acounterpart at 850um, with the exception of a chandra source in the ssa13field, which is a candidate type 2, heavily absorbed qso at high redshift. theratios f(850um)/f(5kev) (mostly upper limits) of the x-ray sources aresignificantly lower than the value observed for the cosmic background. inparticular, we obtain that 2-10 kev sources brighter than 10^-15 erg s^-1cm^-2, which make at least 75% of the background in this band, contribute forless than 7% to the submillimeter background. out of the 24 scuba sources, 23are undetected by chandra. the ratios f(850um)/f(5kev) (mostly lower limits) ofthese scuba sources indicate that most of them must be powered either bystarburst activity, or by an agn which is obscured by a column nh &gt; 10^25cm^-2, with a reflection efficiency in the hard x rays significantly lower than1% in most cases. however, agns of this type could not contribute significantlyto the 2-10 kev background.

astro-ph;0010009	dust in active nuclei. i. evidence for "anomalous" properties	we present observational evidences that dust in the circumnuclear region ofagns has different properties than in the galactic diffuse interstellar medium.by comparing the reddening of optical and infrared broad lines and the x-rayabsorbing column density we find that the e(b-v)/n_h ratio is nearly alwayslower than galactic by a factor ranging from ~3 up to ~100. other observationalresults indicate that the av/n_h ratio is significantly lower than galactic invarious classes of agns including intermediate type 1.8-1.9 seyferts, hardx-ray selected and radio selected quasars, broad absorption line qsos and grismselected qsos. the lack of prominent absorption features at 9.7um (silicates)and at 2175a (carbon dip) in the spectra of seyfert 2s and of reddened seyfert1s, respectively, add further evidence for dust in the circumnuclear region ofagns being different from galactic.  these observational results indicate that the dust composition in thecircumnuclear region of agns could be dominated by large grains, which make theextinction curve flatter, featureless and are responsible for the reduction ofthe e(b-v)/n_h and av/n_h ratios.  regardless of the physical origin of these phenomena, the reduced dustabsorption with respect to what expected from the gaseous column density shouldwarn about a mismatch between the optical and the x-ray classification of theactive galactic nuclei in terms of their obscuration.

astro-ph;0107510	ubiquitous variability of x-ray absorbing column densities in seyfert 2  galaxies	we present a study of the variations in the absorbing column density of 25x-ray defined seyfert 2 galaxies, as inferred from hard x-ray observations, ontimescales from months to several years. we show that a significant variationof n$_h$ (from 20% to 80%) is observed in almost all (22/25) the sources withmultiple x-ray observations, although x-ray absorption never vanishes. for asubsample of 11 sources observed at least five times the typical variationtime, as defined by a structure function, is less than one year for bothheavily absorbed (nh ~ 10^23 cm^(-2)) and moderately absorbed (nh ~ 10^22cm^(-2)) sources. these variations rule out the simplest version of the unifiedmodels, based on a homogeneous obscuring torus, and suggest the presence ofclumpy circumnuclear material on a scale well below a parsec. we propose amodification of the torus model in which an overabundance of slightly dustybelr clouds obscures the belr. the belr needs, like the torus, to have anaxisymmetric structure. this model is closely related to that of elvis (2000)for type 1 agn. for lightly obscured agn (nh ~ 10^22 cm^(-2)) the structurefunction shows an increase at a timescale of $\sim$5 yr, indicating a secondabsorber, most probably on a 5-10 pc scale associated with the host galaxy.

(2) the high-energy exponential cut-off at e~100-300kev is not an ubiquitous property of seyfert galaxies: in ~30% of the objectsthe continuum power-law does not drop up to energies of 300 kev or more. (3) areflected component is present in almost all the sources (17 out of 21). thesmall variations of this component with respect to the intrinsic continuum, inobjects with multiple observations, suggests that the reflector is not theaccretion disk, but must be located much farther from the nucleus. (4) therange of ratios between the reflected and intrinsic components suggests thatthe circumnuclear medium is not homogeneous, and a significant fraction of thesolid angle is covered by a gas thicker than that along the line of sight. (5)the iron kalpha line is present is all but one the sources. the equivalentwidth is in the typical range of seyfert 1s (ew=100-300 ev) in sources with lowabsorption (n_h &lt; 3x10^23 cm^(-2)), and increases in more absorbed objects, asexpected according to unified models. (6) the energy resolution of bepposax isin general too low to measure the iron line width. however, in 6 cases wemeasured a significant line broadening.

astro-ph;0301522	the nature of the absorbing torus in compact radio galaxies	we present bepposax observations of the two radio galaxies pks 1934-63 and s51946+708. strong iron kalpha lines are detected in both objects indicating thatthe two sources are absorbed by column densities higher than 10^24 cm^(-2).  combining radio continuum, hi absorption and x-ray data we can constrain thephysical state and the dimensions of the absorber. we find that the putativeobscuring torus is molecular and located at a distance higher than 20 pc fromthe center in s5 1946+70. in pks 1934-63 no radio nucleus has been observed. ifthis is due to free-free absorption a radius of only a few pc is inferred.since the kalpha lines have been detected only at 90% confidence, we alsodiscuss the implications if they would be not as strong as found from our data.  from our results it appears that the combination of hard x-ray data andspatially resolved hi absorption measurements provides a powerful diagnosticfor conditions in the absorbing ``torus''.

0705.3977	new flaring of an ultraluminous x-ray source in ngc 1365	we have studied a highly variable ultraluminous x-ray source (ulx) in thefornax galaxy ngc 1365, with a series of 12 chandra and xmm-newton observationsbetween 2002 and 2006. in 2006 april, the source peaked at a luminosity ~ 3 x10^{40} erg/s in the 0.3-10 kev band (similar to the maximum luminosity foundby asca in 1995), and declined on an e-folding timescale ~ 3 days. the x-rayspectrum is always dominated by a broad power-law-like component. when thesource is seen at x-ray luminosities ~ 10^{40} erg/s, an additional softthermal component (which we interpret as emission from the accretion disk)contributes ~ 1/4 of the x-ray flux; when the luminosity is higher, ~ 3 x10^{40} erg/s, the thermal component is not detected and must contribute &lt; 10%of the flux. at the beginning of the decline, ionized absorption is detectedaround 0.5-2 kev; it is a possible signature of a massive outflow. thepower-law is always hard, with a photon index gamma ~ 1.7 (and even flatter attimes), as is generally the case with bright ulxs. we speculate that thissource and perhaps most other bright ulxs are in a high/hard state: as theaccretion rate increases well above the eddington limit, more and more power isextracted from the inner region of the inflow through non-radiative channels,and is used to power a comptonizing corona, jet or wind. the observed thermalcomponent comes from the standard outer disk; the transition radius betweenouter standard disk and comptonizing inner region moves further out and tolower disk temperatures as the accretion rate increases. this produces theobserved appearance of a large, cool disk. based on x-ray luminosity andspectral arguments, we suggest that this accreting black hole has a likely mass~ 50-150 msun (even without accounting for possible beaming).

astro-ph;0304529	an xmm-newton hard x-ray survey of ulirgs	xmm-newton observations of 10 ulirgs are reported. the aim is to investigatein hard x-rays a complete ulirg sample selected from the bright iras 60$\mu$mcatalogue. all sources are detected in x-rays, 5 of which for the first time.these observations confirm that ulirgs are intrinsically faint x-rays sources,their observed x-ray luminosities being typically l(2-10 kev)&lt;1e42-43 erg/s,whereas their bolometric luminosities are l&gt;1e45 erg/s. in all sources we findevidence for thermal emission from hot plasma with kt~0.7kev, dominating thex-ray spectra below 1kev, and likely associated with a nuclear or circumnuclearstarburst. this thermal emission appears uncorrelated with the fir luminosity,suggesting that,in addition to the ongoing rate of star formation, otherparameters may also affect it. the soft x-ray emission appears to be extendedon a scale of ~30kpc for mkn231 and iras19254-7245, possible evidence ofgalactic superwinds. in these 2 sources, in iras20551-4250 and iras23128-5919we find evidence for the presence of hidden agns, while a minor agncontribution may be suspected also in iras20100-4156. in particular, we havedetected a strong fe line at 6.4kev in the spectrum of iras19254-7245 and aweaker one in mkn231, suggestive of deeply buried agns. for the other sources,the x-ray luminosities and spectral shapes are consistent with hot thermalplasma and x-ray binary emissions of mainly starburst origin. we find that the2-10kev luminosities in these sources, most likely due to high-mass x-raybinaries, are correlated with l_fir: both luminosities are good indicators ofthe current global sfr in the galaxy. the composite nature of ulirgs is thenconfirmed, with hints for a predominance of the starburst over the agnphenomenon in these objects.

astro-ph;0311619	local supermassive black holes, relics of active galactic nuclei and the  x-ray background	we quantify the importance of mass accretion during agn phases in the growthof supermassive black holes (bh) by comparing the mass function of black holesin the local universe with that expected from agn relics, which are black holesgrown entirely with mass accretion during agn phases. the local bh massfunction (bhmf) is estimated by applying the well-known correlations between bhmass, bulge luminosity and stellar velocity dispersion to galaxy luminosity andvelocity functions. the density of bh's in the local universe is 4.6 (-1.4;+1.9) (h/0.7)^2 10^5 msun mpc^-3. the relic bhmf is derived from the continuityequation with the only assumption that agn activity is due to accretion ontomassive bh's and that merging is not important. we find that the relic bhmf atz=0 is generated mainly at z&lt;3. moreover, the bh growth is anti-hierarchical inthe sense that smaller bh's (mbh&lt; 10^7 msun) grow at lower redshifts (z&lt;1) withrespect to more massive one's (z~1-3). unlike previous work, we find that thebhmf of agn relics is perfectly consistent with the local bhmf indicating thelocal bh's were mainly grown during agn activity. this agreement is obtainedwhile satisfying, at the same time, the constraints imposed from the x-raybackground. the comparison with the local bhmf also suggests that the mergingprocess is not important in shaping the relic bhmf, at least at low redshifts(z&lt;3). our analysis thus suggests the following scenario: local black holesgrew during agn phases in which accreting matter was converted into radiationwith efficiencies epsilon = 0.04-0.16 and emitted at a fraction lambda =0.1-1.7 of the eddington luminosity. the average total lifetime of these activephases ranges from ~4.5 10^8 yr for mbh&lt; 10^8 msun to ~1.5 10^8 yr for mbh&gt;10^9 msun.

astro-ph;0409542	local supermassive black holes and relics of active galactic nuclei	we summarize a study where we test the hypothesis that local black holes (bh)are relics of agn activity. we compare the mass function of bhs in the localuniverse with that expected from agn relics, which are bhs grown entirely withmass accretion during agn phases. the local bh mass function (bhmf) isestimated by applying the well-known correlations between bh mass, bulgeluminosity and stellar velocity dispersion to galaxy luminosity and velocityfunctions. the density of bhs in the local universe is 4.6 (-1.4;+1.9) 10^5msun mpc-3. the relic bhmf is derived from the continuity equation with theonly assumption that agn activity is due to accretion onto massive bhs and thatmerging is not important. we find that the relic bhmf at z=0 is generatedmainly at z&lt;3. moreover, the bh growth is anti-hierarchical in the sense thatsmaller bhs (mbh&lt;10^7 msun) grow at lower redshifts (z&lt;1) with respect to moremassive ones (z~1-3). unlike previous work, we find that the bhmf of agn relicsis perfectly consistent with the local bhmf indicating the local bhs weremainly grown during agn activity. this agreement is obtained while satisfying,at the same time, the constraints imposed by the x-ray background. thecomparison with the local bhmf also suggests that the merging process is notimportant in shaping the relic bhmf, at least at low redshifts (z&lt;3). ouranalysis thus suggests the following scenario: local bhs grew during agn phasesin which accreting matter was converted into radiation with efficiencieseff=0.04-0.16 and emitted at a fraction lambda=0.1-1.7 of the eddingtonluminosity. the average total lifetime of these active phases ranges from ~4.510^8 yr for mbh&lt;10^7 msun to ~1.5 10^8 yr for mbh&gt;10^9 msun.

astro-ph;0612021	rapid n_h changes in ngc 4151	we have analyzed the two longest (elapsed time &gt; 3 days) bepposaxobservations of the x-ray brightest seyfert galaxy, ngc 4151, to search forspectral variability on time-scales from a few tens of ksec to years. we foundin both cases highly significant spectral variability below ~ 6 kev down to theshortest time-scales investigated. these variations can be naturally explainedin terms of variations in the low energy cut-off due to obscuring matter alongthe line of sight. if the cut-off is modeled by two neutral absorptioncomponents, one fully covering the source and the second covering only afraction of the source, the shortest time-scale of variability of a few daysconstrains the location of the obscuring matter to within 3.4 x 10^4schwarzschild radii from the central x-ray source. this is consistent with thedistance of the broad emission line region, as inferred from reverberationmapping, and difficult to reconcile with the parsec scale dusty molecular torusof krolik &amp; begelman (1988). we have also explored a more complex absorptionstructure, namely the presence of an ionized absorber. although the behaviourof the ionization parameter is nicely consistent with the expectations, theresults are not completely satisfactory from the statistical point of view.  the overall absorption during the 2001 december observation is lower than inall other historical observations with similar 2-10 kev flux. this suggeststhat absorption variability plays a crucial role in the observed fluxvariability of this source.

astro-ph;9811074	a 3 dimensional diagnostic diagram for seyfert 2s: probing x-ray  absorption and compton thickness	we present and discuss a "3-dimensional" diagnostic diagram for seyfert2galaxies obtained by means of x-ray and [oiii] data on a large sample ofobjects (reported in the appendix). the diagram shows the kalpha iron lineequivalent width as a function of both the column density derived from thephotoelectric cutoff and the 2-10 kev flux normalized to the [oiii] opticalline flux (the latter corrected for extinction and assumed to be a trueindicator of the source intrinsic luminosity). we find that the hard x-rayproperties of type 2 objects depend on a single parameter, the absorbing columndensity along the line of sight,in accordance with the unified model. thediagram can be used to identify compton thick sources and to isolate and studypeculiar objects. from this analysis we have obtained a column densitydistribution of seyfert 2 galaxies which is thought to be a good approximationof the real distribution. a large population of heavily absorbed objects isdiscovered, including many compton thick candidates. our results indicate thatthe mean log nh/cm^(-2)in type 2 seyferts is 23.5 and that as much as 23-30% ofsources have nh &gt; 10^24 cm^(-2).

astro-ph;9904422	beyond the standard model for the cosmic x-ray background	the synthesis model for the cosmic x-ray background (xrb) -based on theintegrated emission of active galactic nuclei (agns)- is complemented with newobservational results. we adopt the most recent estimates of the agn x-rayluminosity function and evolution. we adopt the column density distribution oftype 2 agns observed in the local universe, instead of describing it as a setof free parameters. we maintain the standard assumptions that type 2 agns havethe same luminosity function -apart from a constant factor- and the sameevolution of type 1s, and that the spectral shapes of both types areindependent of redshift. we explore various parametrizations of the data, andin all cases we find that the xrb can be fitted, but the number density ratioof type 2s to type 1s must be higher than the local value, and/or the hardx-ray counts in the 2-10 kev band and the preliminary bepposax counts in the5-10 kev band are underestimated at a level of a few sigma. these resultsconsistently suggest that type 2 agns could undergo a faster evolution thantype 1s, or other sources with hard x-ray spectra might contribute to the xrbat intermediate or high redshifts.
