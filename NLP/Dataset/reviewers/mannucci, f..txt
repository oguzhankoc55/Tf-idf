0902.2398	lsd: lyman-break galaxies stellar populations and dynamics. i: mass,  metallicity and gas at z~3.1	we present the first results of a project, lsd, aimed at obtainingspatially-resolved, near-infrared spectroscopy of a complete sample oflyman-break galaxies at z~3. deep observations with adaptive optics resulted inthe detection of the main optical lines, such as [oii], hbeta and [oiii], whichare used to study sizes, sfrs, morphologies, gas-phase metallicities, gasfractions and effective yields. optical, near-ir and spitzer/irac photometry isused to measure stellar mass. we obtain that morphologies are usually complex,with the presence of several peaks of emissions and companions that are notdetected in broad-band images. typical metallicities are 10-50% solar, with astrong evolution of the mass-metallicity relation from lower redshifts. stellarmasses, gas fraction, and evolutionary stages vary significantly among thegalaxies, with less massive galaxies showing larger fractions of gas. incontrast with observations in the local universe, effective yields decreasewith stellar mass and reach solar values at the low-mass end of the sample.this effect can be reproduced by gas infall with rates of the order of thesfrs. outflows are present but are not needed to explain the mass-metallicityrelation. we conclude that a large fraction of these galaxies are activelycreating stars after major episodes of gas infall or merging.

0904.3463	five supernova survey galaxies in the southern hemisphere. i. optical  and near-infrared database	the determination of the supernova (sn) rate is based not only on the numberof detected events, but also on the properties of the parent galaxy population.this is the first paper of a series aimed at obtaining new, refined, sn ratesfrom a set of five sn surveys, by making use of a joint analysis ofnear-infrared (nir) data. we describe the properties of the 3838 galaxies thatwere monitored for sne events, including newly determined morphologies andtheir denis and poss-ii/ukst i, 2mass and denis j and ks and 2mass hmagnitudes. we have compared 2mass, denis and poss-ii/ukst ijk magnitudes inorder to find possible systematic photometric shifts in the measurements. thedenis and poss-ii/ukst i band magnitudes show large discrepancies (meanabsolute difference of 0.4 mag), mostly due to different spectral responses ofthe two instruments, with an important contribution (0.33 mag rms) from thelarge uncertainties in the photometric calibration of the poss-ii and ukstphotographic plates. in the other wavebands, the limiting near infraredmagnitude, morphology and inclination of the galaxies are the most influentialfactors which affect the determination of photometry of the galaxies.nevertheless, no significant systematic differences have been found between ofany pair of nir magnitude measurements, except for a few percent of galaxiesshowing large discrepancies. this allows us to combine denis and 2mass data forthe j and ks filters.

0909.2853	evidence for a fast evolution of the uv luminosity function beyond  redshift 6 from a deep hawk-i survey of the goods-s field	we perform a deep search for galaxies in the redshift range 6.5&lt;z&lt;7.5, tomeasure the evolution of the number density of luminous galaxies in thisredshift range and derive useful constraints on the evolution of theirluminosity function. we present here the first results of an eso large program,that exploits the unique combination of area and sensitivity provided in thenear-ir by the camera hawk-i at the vlt. we have obtained two hawk-i pointingson the goods south field for a total of 32 observing hours, covering ~90arcmin2. the images reach y=26.7 mags for the two fields. we have used publicacs images in the z band to select z-dropout galaxies with the colour criteriaz-y&gt;1, y-j&lt;1.5 and y-k&lt;2. the other public data in the ubvrijhk bands are usedto reject possible low redshift interlopers. the output has been compared withextensive monte carlo simulations to quantify the observational effects of ourselection criteria as well as the effects of photometric errors. we detect 7high quality candidates in the magnitude range y=25.5-26.7. this intervalsamples the critical range for m* at z&gt;6 (m_1500 ~- 19.5 to -21.5). afteraccounting for the expected incompleteness, we rule out at a 99% confidencelevel a luminosity function constant from z=6 to z=7, even including theeffects of cosmic variance. for galaxies brighter than m_1500=-19.0 we derive aluminosity density rho_uv=1.5^{+2.0}_{-0.9} 10^25 erg/s/hz/mpc3, implying adecrease by a factor 3.5 from z=6 to z~6.8. on the basis of our findings, wemake predictions for the surface densities expected in future surveys surveys,based on ultra-vista, hst-wfc3 or jwst-nircam, evaluating the bestobservational strategy to maximise their impact.

1005.0006	a fundamental relation between mass, sfr and metallicity in local and  high redshift galaxies	we show that the mass-metallicity relation observed in the local universe isdue to a more general relation between stellar mass m*, gas-phase metallicityand sfr. local galaxies define a tight surface in this 3d space, thefundamental metallicity relation (fmr), with a small residual dispersion of~0.05 dex in metallicity, i.e, ~12%. at low stellar mass, metallicity decreasessharply with increasing sfr, while at high stellar mass, metallicity does notdepend on sfr. high redshift galaxies, up to z~2.5 are found to follow the samefmr defined by local sdss galaxies, with no indication of evolution. theevolution of the mass-metallicity relation observed up to z=2.5 is due to thefact that galaxies with progressively higher sfrs, and therefore lowermetallicities, are selected at increasing redshifts, sampling different partsof the same fmr. by introducing the new quantity mu_alpha=log(m*)-alphalog(sfr), with alpha=0.32, we define a projection of the fmr that minimizes themetallicity scatter of local galaxies. the same quantity also cancels out anyredshift evolution up to z~2.5, i.e, all galaxies have the same range of valuesof mu_0.32. at z&gt;2.5, evolution of about 0.6 dex off the fmr is observed, withhigh-redshift galaxies showing lower metallicities. the existence of the fmrcan be explained by the interplay of infall of pristine gas and outflow ofenriched material. the former effect is responsible for the dependence ofmetallicity with sfr and is the dominant effect at high-redshift, while thelatter introduces the dependence on stellar mass and dominates at low redshift.the combination of these two effects, together with the schmidt-kennicutt law,explains the shape of the fmr and the role of mu_0.32. the small metallicityscatter around the fmr supports the smooth infall scenario of gas accretion inthe local universe.

1006.4463	the extinction law at high redshift and its implications	we analyze the optical-near infrared spectra of 33 quasars with redshifts3.9&lt;z&lt;6.4 to investigate the properties of dust extinction at these cosmicepochs. the smc extinction curve has been shown to reproduce the dust reddeningof most quasars at z&lt;2.2; we investigate whether this curve also provides agood description of dust extinction at higher redshifts. we fit the observedspectra with synthetic absorbed quasar templates obtained by varying theintrinsic slope (alpha), the absolute extinction (a3000), and by using a gridof empirical and theoretical extinction curves. we find that seven quasars inour sample are affected by substantial extinction (a3000 &gt;0.8), andcharacterized by very steep intrinsic slopes (alpha&lt;-2.3). all of theindividual quasars require extinction curve deviating from that of the smc,with a tendency to flatten at lambda&lt;2000 a (in the rest frame of the source).we obtain a mean extinction curve at z&gt;4, both by performing a simultaneous fitof all quasars and by averaging the extinction curves inferred for individualquasars. in the case of broad absorption line quasars the mean extinction curvedeviates from the smc at a confidence level &gt;95%. the difference betweenextinction curves in quasars at z&gt;4 and in quasars at lower redshift isindicative of either a different dust production mechanism at high redshift, ora different mechanism for processing dust into the ism. we suggest that thesame transitions may also apply to normal, star-forming galaxies at z&gt;4. inparticular, the observed change in the average spectral slope of galaxies atz&gt;4 may be partially ascribed to a variation in the extinction curve, ratherthan a lower dust content at high redshift. in this scenario, the extinctioncurve inferred at z&gt;4 would imply a cosmic star-formation corrected for dustattenuation a factor of ~2 higher than estimated in the past.

1007.4180	dynamical properties of amaze and lsd galaxies from gas kinematics and  the tully-fisher relation at z~3	we present a sinfoni integral field kinematical study of 33 galaxies at z~3from the amaze and lsd projects which are aimed at studying metallicity anddynamics of high-redshift galaxies. the number of galaxies analyzed in thispaper constitutes a significant improvement compared to existing data in theliterature and this is the first time that a dynamical analysis is obtained fora relatively large sample of galaxies at z~3. 11 galaxies show orderedrotational motions (~30% of the sample), in these cases we estimate dynamicalmasses by modeling the gas kinematics with rotating disks and exponential massdistributions. we find dynamical masses in the range 2 \times 10^9 m\odot - 2\times 10^11 m\odot with a mean value of ~ 2 \times 10^10 m\odot. by comparingobserved gas velocity dispersion with that expected from models, we find thatmost rotating objects are dynamically "hot", with intrinsic velocitydispersions of the order of ~90 km s-1. the median value of the ratio betweenthe maximum disk rotational velocity and the intrinsic velocity dispersion forthe rotating objects is 1.6, much lower than observed in local galaxies value(~10) and slightly lower than the z~2 value (2 - 4). finally we use the maximumrotational velocity from our modeling to build a baryonic tully-fisher relationat z~3. our measurements indicate that z~3 galaxies have lower stellar masses(by a factor of ten on average) compared to local galaxies with the samedynamical mass. however, the large observed scatter suggests that thetully-fisher relation is not yet "in place" at these early cosmic ages,possibly due to the young age of galaxies. a smaller dispersion of thetuly-fisher relation is obtained by taking into account the velocity dispersionwith the use of the s_0.5 indicator, suggesting that turbulent motions mighthave an important dynamical role.

1010.2534	gas accretion as the origin of chemical abundance gradients in distant  galaxies	it has recently been suggested that galaxies in the early universe can growthrough the accretion of cold gas, and that this may have been the main driverof star formation and stellar mass growth. because the cold gas is essentiallyprimordial, it has a very low abundance of elements heavier than helium(metallicity). as it is funneled to the centre of a galaxy, it will lead thecentral gas having an overall lower metallicity than gas further from thecentre, because the gas further out has been enriched by supernovae and stellarwinds, and not diluted by the primordial gas. here we report chemicalabundances across three rotationally-supported star-forming galaxies at z~3,only 2 gyr after the big bang. we find an 'inverse' gradient, with the central,star forming regions having a lower metallicity than less active ones, oppositeto what is seen in local galaxies. we conclude that the central gas has beendiluted by the accretion of primordial gas, as predicted by 'cold flow' models.

1011.0264	galaxy metallicity near and far	metallicity appears to be one the most important tool to study formation andevolution of galaxies. recently, we have shown that metallicity of localgalaxies is tightly related not only to stellar mass, but also to starformation rate (sfr). at low stellar mass, metallicity decreases sharply withincreasing sfr, while at high stellar mass, metallicity does not depend on sfr.the residual metallicity dispersion across this fundamental metallicityrelation (fmr) is very small, about 0.05dex. high redshift galaxies, up toz~2.5, are found to follow the same fmr defined by local sdss galaxies, with noindication of evolution. at z&gt;2.5, evolution of about 0.6dex off the fmr isobserved, with high-redshift galaxies showing lower metallicities. this resultcan be combined with our recent discover of metallicity gradients in three highredshift galaxies showing disk dynamics. in these galaxies, the regions withhigher sfr also show lower metallicities. both these evidences can be explainedby the effect of smooth infall of gas into previously enriched galaxies, withthe star-formation activity triggered by the infalling gas.

1011.4506	the metallicity of the long grb hosts and the fundamental metallicity  relation of low-mass galaxies	we investigate the metallicity properties of host galaxies of long gamma-raybursts (grbs) in the light of the fundamental metallicity relation (fmr), thetight dependence of metallicity on mass and sfr recently discovered for sdssgalaxies with stellar masses above 10^9.2 msun. as most of the grb hosts havemasses below this limit, the fmr can only be used after an extension towardslower masses. at this aim, we study the fmr for galaxies with masses down to~10^8.3 msun, finding that the fmr does extend smoothly at lower masses, albeitwith a much larger scatter. we then compare the resulting fmr with themetallicity properties of 18 host galaxies of long grbs. while the grb hostsshow a systematic offset with respect to the mass-metallicity relation, theyare fully consistent with the fmr. this shows that the difference with themass-metallicity relation is due to higher than average sfrs, and that grbswith optical afterglows do not preferentially select low-metallicity hostsamong the star-forming galaxies. the apparent low metallicity is therefore aconsequence of the occurrence of long grb in low mass, actively star-forminggalaxies, known to dominate the current cosmic sfr.

1104.0300	five supernova survey galaxies in the southern hemisphere. ii. the  supernova rates	based on the database compiled in the first article of this series, with 56sn events discovered in 3838 galaxies of the southern hemisphere, we computethe rate of supernovae (sne) of different types along the hubble sequencenormalized to the optical and near-infrared luminosities as well as to thestellar mass of the galaxies. we find that the rates of all sn types show adependence on both morphology and colors of the galaxies, and therefore, on thestar-formation activity. the rate of core-collapse (cc) sne is confirmed to beclosely related to the star formation rate (sfr) and only indirectly to thetotal mass of the galaxies. the rate of sne ia can be explained by assumingthat at least 15% of ia events in spiral galaxies originates in relativelyyoung stellar populations. we find that the rates show no modulation withnuclear activity or environment. the ratio of sn rates between types ib/c andii shows no trend with spiral type.

1105.1378	the metallicity properties of simulated long-grb galaxy hosts and the  fundamental metallicity relation	we study the implication of the collapsar model for long gamma-ray bursts(lgrbs) on the metallicity properties of the host galaxies, by combininghigh-resolution n-body simulations with semi-analytic models of galaxyformation. the cosmological model that we use reproduces the fundamentalmetallicity relation recently discovered for the sdss galaxies, whereby themetallicity decreases with increasing star formation rate for galaxies of agiven stellar mass. we select host galaxies housing pockets of gas-particles,young and with different thresholds in metallicities, that can be sites of lrgbevents, according to the collapsar model. the simulated samples are comparedwith 18 observed lgrb hosts in the aim at discriminating whether themetallicity is a primary parameter. we find that a threshold in metallicity forthe lgrb progenitors, within the model galaxies, is not necessary in order toreproduce the observed distribution of host metallicities. the lowmetallicities of observed lgrb hosts is a consequence of the high starformation environment. the star formation rate appears to be the primaryparameter to generate a burst event. finally, we show that only a few lgrbs areobserved in massive, highly extincted galaxies, while these galaxies areexpected to produce many such events. we identify these missing events with thefraction of dark lgrbs.

1108.1057	a dynamical mass estimator for high z galaxies based on  spectroastrometry	galaxy dynamical masses are important physical quantities to constrain galaxyevolutionary models, especially at high redshifts. however, at z~2 the limitedsignal to noise ratio and spatial resolution of the data usually do not allowspatially resolved kinematical modeling and very often only virial masses canbe estimated from line widths. but even such estimates require a good knowledgeof galaxy size, which may be smaller than the spatial resolution.spectroastrometry is a technique which combines spatial and spectral resolutionto probe spatial scales significantly smaller than the spatial resolution ofthe observations. here we apply it to the case of high-z galaxies and present amethod based on spectroastrometry to estimate dynamical masses of high zgalaxies, which overcomes the problem of size determination with poor spatialresolution. we construct and calibrate a "spectroastrometric" virial massestimator, modifying the "classical" virial mass formula. we apply our methodto the [o iii] or h{\alpha} emission line detected in z~2-3 galaxies fromamaze, lsd and sins samples and we compare the spectroastrometric estimatorwith dynamical mass values resulting from full spatially resolved kinematicalmodeling. the spectroastrometric estimator is found to be a good approximationof dynamical masses, presenting a linear relation with a residual dispersion ofonly 0.15 dex. this is a big improvement compared to the "classical" virialmass estimator which has a non linear relation and much larger dispersion (0.47dex) compared to dynamical masses. by applying our calibrated estimator to 16galaxies from the amaze and lsd samples, we obtain masses in the ~10^7-10^10m\odot range extending the mass range attainable with dynamical modeling.

0710.1094	the supernova rate in local galaxy clusters	we report a measurement of the supernova (sn) rates (ia and core-collapse) ingalaxy clusters based on the 136 sne of the sample described in cappellaro etal. (1999) and mannucci et al. (2005).  early-type cluster galaxies show a type ia sn rate (0.066 snum) similar tothat obtained by sharon et al. (2007) and more than 3 times larger than that infield early-type galaxies (0.019 snum). this difference has a 98% statisticalconfidence level. we examine many possible observational biases which couldaffect the rate determination, and conclude that none of them is likely tosignificantly alter the results. we investigate how the rate is related toseveral properties of the parent galaxies, and find that cluster membership,morphology and radio power all affect the sn rate, while galaxy mass has nomeasurable effect. the increased rate may be due to galaxy interactions inclusters, inducing either the formation of young stars or a different evolutionof the progenitor binary systems.  we present the first measurement of the core-collapse sn rate in clusterlate-type galaxies, which turns out to be comparable to the rate in fieldgalaxies. this suggests that no large systematic difference in the initial massfunction exists between the two environments.

1304.4940	a fundamental relation between the metallicity, gas content, and stellar  mass of local galaxies	recent results have suggested that the well known mass-metallicity relationhas a strong dependence on the star formation rate, to the extent that a threedimensional `fundamental metallicity relation' exists which links the threeparameters with minimal scatter. in this work, we use a sample of 4253 localgalaxies observed in atomic hydrogen from the alfalfa survey to demonstrate,for the first time, that a similar fundamental relation (the hi-fmr) alsoexists between stellar mass, gas-phase metallicity, and hi mass. this latterrelation is likely more fundamental, driving the relation between metallicity,sfr and mass. at intermediate masses, the behaviour of the gas fundamentalmetallicity relation is very similar to that expressed via the star formationrate. however, we find that the dependence of metallicity on hi contentpersists to the highest stellar masses, in contrast to the `saturation' ofmetallicity with sfr. it is interesting to note that the dispersion of therelation is very low at intermediate stellar masses (9&lt; log(m*/msun) &lt;11),suggesting that in this range galaxies evolve smoothy, in an equilibriumbetween gas inflow, outflow and star formation. at high and low stellar masses,the scatter of the relation is significantly higher, suggesting that mergingevents and/or stochastic accretion and star formation may drive galaxiesoutside the relation. we also assemble a sample of galaxies observed in co.however, due to a small sample size, strong selection bias, and the influenceof a metallicity-dependent co/h2 conversion factor, the data are insufficientto test any influence of molecular gas on metallicity.

1308.5113	strongly star-forming rotating disks in a complex merging system at z =  4,7 as revealed by alma	we performed a kinematical analysis of the [cii] line emission of the br1202-0725 system at z~4,7 using alma observations. the most prominent sourcesof this system are a quasar and a submillimeter galaxy, separated by aprojected distance of about 24 kpc and characterized by very high sfr, higherthan 1000 msun/yr. however, the alma observations reveal that these galaxiesapparently have undisturbed rotating disks, which is at variance with thecommonly accepted scenario in which strong star formation activity is inducedby a major merger. we also detected faint components which, after spectraldeblending, were spatially resolved from the main qso and smg emissions. therelative velocities and positions of these components are compatible withorbital motions within the gravitational potentials generated by the qso hostgalaxy and the smg, suggesting that they are smaller galaxies in interaction orgas clouds in accretion flows of tidal streams. we did not find any clearspectral evidence for outflows caused by agn or stellar feedback. this suggeststhat the high star formation rates might be induced by interactions or minormergers with these companions, which do not affect the large-scale kinematicsof the disks, however. our kinematical analysis also indicates that the qso andthe smg have similar mdyn, mostly in the form of molecular gas, and that theqso host galaxy and the smg are seen close to face-on with slightly differentdisk inclinations: the qso host galaxy is seen almost face-on (i~15), while thesmg is seen at higher inclinations (i~25). finally, the ratio between the blackhole mass of the qso, obtained from xshooter spectroscopy, and the mdyn of thehost galaxy is similar to value found in very massive local galaxies,suggesting that the evolution of black hole galaxy relations is probably betterstudied with dynamical than with stellar host galaxy masses.

1311.3670	the evolution of the dust and gas content in galaxies	we use deep herschel pacs and spire observations in goodss, goodsn and cosmosto estimate the average dust mass (mdust) of galaxies on a redshift-stellarmass (mstar)-sfr grid. we study the scaling relations between mdust, mstar andsfr at z&lt;=2.5. no clear evolution of mdust is observed at fixed sfr and mstar.we find a tight correlation between sfr and mdust, likely a consequence of theschmidt-kennicutt (s-k) law. the mstar-mdust correlation observed by previousworks flattens or sometimes disappears when fixing the sfr. most of it likelyderives from the combination of the mdust-sfr and mstar-sfr correlations. wethen investigate the gas content as inferred by converting mdust by assumingthat the dust/gas ratio scales linearly with the gas metallicity. all galaxiesin the sample follow, within uncertainties, the same sfr-mgas relation(integrated s-k law), which broadly agrees with co-based results for the bulkof the population, despite the completely different approaches. the majority ofgalaxies at z~2 form stars with an efficiency (sfe=sfr/mgas) ~5 times higherthan at z~0. it is not clear what fraction of such variation is an intrinsicredshift evolution and what fraction arises from selection effects. the gasfraction (fgas) decreases with mstar and increases with sfr, and does notevolve with z at fixed mstar and sfr. we explain these trends by introducing auniversal relation between fgas, mstar and sfr, non-evolving out to z~2.5.galaxies move across this relation as their gas content evolves in time. we usethe 3d fundamental fgas-mstar-sfr relation and the redshift evolution of themain sequence to estimate the evolution of fgas in the average population ofgalaxies as a function of z and mstar, and we find evidence a downsizingscenario.

1405.3664	dynamics and metallicity of far-ir selected galaxies	we present near-infrared integral field spectroscopy of ten herschel selectedgalaxies at z~1.5. from detailed mapping of the h$\alpha$ and [nii] emissionlines we trace the dynamics, star formation rates, metallicities and alsoinvestigate gas fractions for these galaxies. for a few galaxies thedistribution of star formation as traced by h$\alpha$ only traces a smallfraction of the stellar disc, which could be tracing recent minor mergingevents. the rest-frame ultraviolet (uv) continuum emission often has adistribution completely different from h$\alpha$, which warns about the use ofuv-sed based star formation tracers in these systems. our analysis of galaxydynamics shows that minor dynamical disruptions (e.g. minor merging) aregenerally not enough to cause a deviation from the established 'main sequence'relation. most galaxies are found to follow the fundamental metallicityrelation (fmr), although with large scatter. one galaxy, (a small satellitegalaxy of a massive companion) is found to deviate strongly from the fmr. thisdeviation is in nice agreement with the correlation recently discovered inlocal galaxies between gas metallicity and environment, which has been ascribedto enriched inter-galactic medium (igm) in dense environments, and thereforesuggests that here the igm was already significantly enriched by z~1.5.

1409.7064	are lgrbs biased tracers of star formation? clues from the host galaxies  of the swift/bat6 complete sample of lgrbs. i: stellar mass at z&lt;1	lgrbs are associated with massive stars and are therefore linked to starformation. the conditions necessary to produce lgrbs can affect the relationbetween the lgrb rate and star formation. by using the power of a complete lgrbsample, our aim is to understand whether such a bias exists and, if it does,what is its origin. in this first paper, we build the sed of the z&lt;1 hostgalaxies of the bat6 lgrb sample, and determine their stellar masses from sedfitting. we compare the resulting stellar mass distribution (i) withstar-forming galaxies observed in deep surveys (ultravista); (ii) withsemi-analitical models of the z&lt;1 star forming galaxy population and (iii) withnumerical simulations of lgrb hosts having different metallicity thresholds forthe progenitor star environment. we find that at z&lt;1 lgrbs tend to avoidmassive galaxies and are powerful in selecting faint low-mass star-forminggalaxies. the stellar mass distribution of the hosts is not consistent withthat of the ultravista star-forming galaxies weighted for their sfr. thisimplies that, at least at z&lt;1, lgrbs are not unbiased tracers of starformation. to make the two distributions consistent, a much steeper faint-endof the mass function would be required, or a very shallow sfr-mass relation forthe low mass galaxy population. grb host galaxy simulations indicates that, toreproduce the stellar mass distribution, a metallicity threshold of the orderof z_th=0.3-0.5z_sun is necessary. models without a metallicity threshold orwith an extreme threshold of z_th = 0.1z_sun are excluded at z&lt;1. the use ofthe bat6 complete sample makes this result not affected by possible biaseswhich could have influenced past results based on incomplete samples. thepreference for low metallicities (z&lt;~0.5z_sun) can be a consequence of theparticular conditions needed for the progenitor star to produce a grb.(abridged)

1411.4208	blowin' in the wind: both `negative' and `positive' feedback in an  obscured high-z quasar	quasar feedback in the form of powerful outflows is invoked as a keymechanism to quench star formation in galaxies, preventing massive galaxies toover-grow and producing the red colors of ellipticals. on the other hand, somemodels are also requiring `positive' agn feedback, inducing star formation inthe host galaxy through enhanced gas pressure in the interstellar medium.however, finding observational evidence of the effects of both types offeedback is still one of the main challenges of extragalactic astronomy, as fewobservations of energetic and extended radiatively-driven winds are available.here we present sinfoni near infrared integral field spectroscopy of xid2028,an obscured, radio-quiet z=1.59 qso detected in the xmm-cosmos survey, in whichwe clearly resolve a fast (1500 km/s) and extended (up to 13 kpc from the blackhole) outflow in the [oiii] lines emitting gas, whose large velocity andoutflow rate are not sustainable by star formation only. the narrow componentof ha emission and the rest frame u band flux from hst-acs imaging enable tomap the current star formation in the host galaxy: both tracers independentlyshow that the outflow position lies in the center of an empty cavity surroundedby star forming regions on its edge. the outflow is therefore removing the gasfrom the host galaxy (`negative feedback'), but also triggering star formationby outflow induced pressure at the edges (`positive feedback'). xid2028represents the first example of a host galaxy showing both types of feedbacksimultaneously at work.

1506.03096	ionised outflows in z $\sim$ 2.4 quasar host galaxies	agn-driven outflows are invoked by galaxy evolutionary models to quench starformation and to explain the origin of the relations observed locally betweensuper massive black holes and their host galaxies. this work aims to detect thepresence of extended ionised outflows in luminous quasars where we expect themaximum activity both in star formation and in black hole accretion. currently,there are only a few studies based on spatially resolved observations ofoutflows at high redshift, $z&gt;2$. we analyse a sample of six luminous (${\rml&gt;10^{47} \ erg/s}$) quasars at $z\sim2.4$, observed in h-band using thenear-ir integral field spectrometer sinfoni at vlt. we perform a kinematicanalysis of the [oiii] emission line at $\lambda = 5007\aa$. [oiii] has acomplex gas kinematic, with blue-shifted velocities of a few hundreds of km/sand line widths up to 1500 km/s. using the spectroastrometric method we infersize of the ionised outflows of up to $\sim$2 kpc. the properties of theionised outflows, mass outflow rate, momentum rate and kinetic power, arecorrelated with the agn luminosity. the increase in outflow rate withincreasing agn luminosity is consistent with the idea that a luminous agnpushes away the surrounding gas through fast outflows driven by radiationpressure, which depends on the emitted luminosity. we derive mass outflow ratesof about 6-700 m$_{\odot}$/yr for our sample, which are lower than thoseobserved in molecular outflows. indeed physical properties of ionised outflowsshow dependences on agn luminosity which are similar to those of molecularoutflows but indicating that the mass of ionised gas is smaller than that ofthe molecular one. alternatively, this discrepancy between ionised andmolecular outflows could be explained with different acceleration mechanisms.

(j band), while dusty galaxies showa smoother spectral energy distributions and therefore redder j-k colours. wediscuss this difference in detail both in the framework of the stellarpopulation synthesis models and by using observed spectra. the selectioncriterion is also compared with the properties of ergs of known nature. we alsoshow that this colour selection criterion is also useful to separate the ergsfrom brown dwarf stars showing similar optical-to-ir colours.

astro-ph;0409577	a supernova origin for dust in a high-redshift quasar	interstellar dust plays a crucial role in the evolution of the universe byassisting the formation of molecules, by triggering the formation of the firstlow-mass stars, and by absorbing stellar ultraviolet-optical light andsubsequently re-emitting it at infrared/millimetre wavelengths. dust is thoughtto be produced predominantly in the envelopes of evolved (age &gt;1 gyr), low-massstars. this picture has, however, recently been brought into question by thediscovery of large masses of dust in the host galaxies of quasars at redshiftz&gt;6, when the age of the universe was less than 1 gyr. theoretical studies,corroborated by observations of nearby supernova remnants, have suggested thatsupernovae provide a fast and efficient dust formation environment in the earlyuniverse. here we report infrared observations of a quasar at redshift 6.2,which are used to obtain directly its dust extinction curve. we then show thatsuch a curve is in excellent agreement with supernova dust models. this resultdemonstrates a supernova origin for dust in this high-redshift quasar, fromwhich we infer that most of the dust at high redshifts has probably the sameorigin.

astro-ph;0410434	looking for obscured qsos in the x-ray emitting ero population	we present xmm-newton data centered on one of the munics near infraredcluster survey fields (s2f1) and we discuss the x-ray properties of the 6 x-rayemitting eros found. for one of them we have already obtained the redshiftusing near-infrared spectroscopic data, while for the remaining 5 eros theanalysis is based on photometric redshifts. we find evidence for the presenceof an x-ray obscured qso in at least 5 out of the 6 x-ray emitting eros. forthese 5 objects we derive intrinsic (2-10 kev) luminosities in excess of 10^44erg/s and intrinsic column densities higher than 10^22 cm^-2. these values havebeen obtained through a basic x-ray spectral analysis for the three brightestsources and through the analysis of the hardness ratios for the remaining two.all of these 5 x-ray emitting eros appear extended in the optical/near-infraredbands indicating that the host galaxy emission dominates at these wavelengths.this suggests that the hosted agns are likely to be absorbed also in theoptical/near-infrared bands: i.e. they are likely x-ray obscured possible type2 qsos. for the remaining ero the presence of an agn is suggested both by itshigh 0.5-2 kev luminosity (l(0.5-2 kev)~10^43 erg/s) and by itsx-ray-to-optical flux ratio. in this case the quality of the present dataprevents us from placing firm constraints on the agn type hosted. finally, thenear-ir spectrum obtained for one of the 6 eros classifies the host galaxy asan elliptical at z~1.7 with a stellar mass well in excess of 10^11 m_\odot.this result corroborates the possible link between the qso activity and theformation of massive spheroids.

astro-ph;0412020	the density of very massive evolved galaxies to z~1.7	we spectroscopically identified 7 massive evolved galaxies with magnitudes17.8&lt;k&lt;18.4 at 1.3&lt;z&lt;1.7 over an area of ~160 arcmin^2 of the munics survey.their rest-frame k-band absolute magnitudes are -26.8&lt;m$_k&lt;-26.1 (5l*&lt;l_k&lt;10l*)and the resulting stellar masses are in the range 3-6.5x10^{11} m_sun. theanalysis we performed unambiguously shows the early-type nature of theirspectra. the 7 massive evolved galaxies account for a comoving density of\~5.5(+-2) x 10^{-5} mpc^{-3} at &lt;z&gt;~1.5, a factor 1.5 lower than the density(8.4(+-1) x 10^{-5} mpc^{-3}) of early-types with comparable masses at z=0. theincompleteness (30%) of our spectroscopic observations accounts for thisdiscrepancy. thus, our data do not support a decrease of the comoving densityof early-type galaxies with masses comparable to the most massive ones in thelocal universe up to z~1.7. this suggests that massive evolved galaxies do notplay an important role in the evolution of the mass density outlined by recentsurveys in this redshift range, evolution which instead has to be ascribed tothe accretion of the stellar mass in late-type galaxies. finally, the presenceof such massive evolved galaxies at these redshifts suggests that the assemblyof massive spheroids has taken place at z&gt;2 supporting a high efficiency in theaccretion of the stellar mass in massive halos in the early universe.

astro-ph;0504087	why are radio-galaxies prolific producers of type ia supernovae?	an analysis of snia events in early type galaxies from the cappellaro et al(1999) database provides conclusive evidence that the rate of type iasupernovae (sne) in radio-loud galaxies is about 4 times higher than the ratemeasured in radio-quiet galaxies, i.e. snia-rate$(radio-loud galaxies) =0.43^{+0.19}_{-0.14}h^2_{75}$ snu as compared to snia-rate$(radio-quietgalaxies) = 0.11^{+0.06}_{-0.03}h^2_{75}$ snu. the actual value of theenhancement is likely to be in the range $\sim 2-7$ (p$\sim 10^{-4}$). thisfinding puts on robust empirical grounds the results obtained by della valle &amp;panagia (2003) on the basis of a smaller sample of sne. we analyse the possiblecauses of this result and conclude that the enhancement of snia explosion ratein radio-loud galaxies has the same origin as their being strong radio sources,but there is no causality link between the two phenomena. we argue thatrepeated episodes of interaction and/or mergers of early type galaxies withdwarf companions, on times-scale of about 1 gyr, are responsible for inducingboth strong radio activity observed in $\sim$14% of early type galaxies and tosupply an adequate number of snia progenitors to the stellar population ofellipticals.

astro-ph;0505467	dating the stellar population in massive early-type galaxies at  $z\sim$1.5	we present the analysis of 10 massive early-type galaxies at $z\sim1.5$. theyhave been identified by means of a near-ir low resolution spectroscopicfollow-up of a complete sample of 36 bright (k' $&lt;$ 18.5) extremely red objects(eros, r-k'$&gt;$ 5) selected from the munich near-ir clustersurvey (munics; droryet al. 2001). the low resolution near-ir spectra constrain their redshift at$1.2&lt;z&lt;1.7$, implying absolute magnitudes m$_{k'}&lt;-26.0$ and stellar masseswell in excess of 10$^{11}$ m$_\odot$. under the hypothesis of pure passiveevolution from $z\sim1.5$ to $z=0$, in the local universe they would haveluminosities l$_k\ge2.5$l$^*$. thus, they are the high-z counterparts of thelocal old massive (10$^{11}-10^{12}$ m$_\odot$) early-type galaxies populatingthe bright end of the local luminosity function of galaxies. the comparison oftheir spectro-photometric properties with a grid of synthetic models suggeststhat the stellar populations in more than half of the sample are about$\sim$3-5 gyr old and 1-2 gyr old in the remaining part. these ages implyformation redshift $z_{f} &gt; 2$ for all the galaxies and $z_{f} \geq 4$ for theoldest ones. the comparison of the 4000\aa break and of the overall spectralshape of the average spectrum of the 10 galaxies at $z\sim1.5$ with those oftheir local counterpartsconfirms that field massive early-type galaxies formedthe bulk of their stellar mass at $2&lt;z&lt;4$, most likely over a short ($&lt;$ 1 gyr)star formation time scale, consistently with the results derived from theanalysis of their individual spectro-photometric properties.

astro-ph;0510315	two populations of progenitors for type ia sne?	we use recent observations of type ia supernova (sn ia) rates to derive, onrobust empirical grounds, the distribution of the delay time (dtd) between theformation of the progenitor star and its explosion as a sn. our analysis finds:i) delay times as long as 3-4 gyr, derived from observations of sne ia at highredshift, cannot reproduce the dependence of the sn ia rate on the colors andon the radio-luminosity of the parent galaxies, as observed in the localuniverse; ii) the comparison between observed sn rates and a grid oftheoretical "single-population" dtds shows that only a few of them are possiblyconsistent with observations. the most successful models are all predicting apeak of sn explosions soon after star formation and an extended tail in thedtd, and can reproduce the data but only at a modest statistical confidencelevel; iii) present data are best matched by a bimodal dtd, in which about 50%of type ia sne (dubbed "prompt" sn ia) explode soon after their stellar birth,in a time of the order of 10^8 years, while the remaining 50% ("tardy" sn ia)have a much wider distribution, well described by an exponential function witha decay time of about 3 gyr. this fact, coupled with the well establishedbimodal distribution of the decay rate, suggests the existence of two classesof progenitors. we discuss the cosmological implications of this result andmake simple predictions.

astro-ph;0607143	evidence for strong evolution of the cosmic star formation density at  high redshift	deep hst/acs and vlt/isaac data of the goods-south field were used to lookfor high-redshift galaxies in the rest-frame uv wavelength range and to studythe evolution of the cosmic star-formation density at z~7. the goods-south areawas surveyed down to a limiting magnitude of about (j+ks)=25.5 looking fordrop-out objects in the z acs filter. the large sampled area would allow forthe detection of galaxies which are 20 times less numerous and 1-2 magnitudesbrighter than similar studies using hst/nicmos near-ir data. two objects wereinitially selected as promising candidates of galaxies at z~7, but havesubsequently been dismissed and identified as galactic brown dwarfs through adetailed analysis of their morphology and spitzer colors, as well as throughspectroscopic information. as a consequence, we conclude that there are nogalaxies at z~7 down to our limiting magnitude in the field we investigated.our non detection of galaxies at z~7 provides clear evidence for a strongevolution of the luminosity function between z=6 and z=7, i.e. over a timeinterval of only ~170 myr. our constraints also provide evidence for asignificant decline of the total star formation rate at z=7, which must be lessthan 40% of that at z=3 and 40-80% of that at z=6. we also derive an upperlimit to the ionizing flux at z=7, which is only marginally consistent withthat required to completely ionize the universe.

astro-ph;0607221	galaxy morphology and evolution from swan adaptive optics imaging	we present the results from adaptive optics (ao) assisted imaging in the ksband of an area of 15 arcmin^2 for swan (survey of a wide area with naco). wederive the high resolution near-ir morphology of ~400 galaxies up to ks~23.5 inthe first 21 swan fields around bright guide stars, carefully taking intoaccount the survey selection effects and using an accurate treatment of theanisoplanatic ao psf. the detected galaxies are sorted into two morphologicalclasses according to their sersic index. the extracted morphological propertiesand number counts of the galaxies are compared with the predictions ofdifferent galaxy formation and evolution models, both for the whole galaxypopulation and separately for late-type and early-type galaxies. this is one ofthe first times such a comparison has been done in the near-ir, as aoobservations and accurate psf modeling are needed to obtain reliablemorphological classification of faint field galaxies at these wavelengths. forearly-type galaxies we find that a pure luminosity evolution model, withoutevidence for relevant number and size evolution, better reproduces the observedproperties of our ks-selected sample than current semi-analytic models based onthe hierarchical picture of galaxy formation. in particular, we find that theobserved flattening of elliptical galaxy counts at ks~20 is quantitatively ingood agreement with the prediction of the pure luminosity evolution model thatwas calculated prior to the observation. for late-type galaxies, while bothmodels are able to reproduce the number counts, we find some hints of apossible size growth. these results demonstrate the unique power of aoobservations to derive high resolution details of faint galaxies' morphology inthe near-ir and drive studies of galaxy evolution.

astro-ph;0607504	a new formulation of the type ia sn rate and its consequences on  galactic chemical evolution	in recent papers mannucci et al. (2005, 2006) suggested, on the basis ofobservational arguments, that there is a bimodal distribution of delay timesfor the explosion of type ia sne. in this paper, we test this hypothesis inmodels of chemical evolution of galaxies of different morphological type:ellipticals, spirals and irregulars. we show that this proposed scenario iscompatible also with the main chemical properties of galaxies. when the newrate is introduced in the two-infall model for the milky way, the derived typeia sn rate as a function of cosmic time shows a high and broad peak at veryearly epochs thus influencing the chemical evolution of the galactic halo morethan in the previous widely adopted formulations for the snia rate. as aconsequence of this, the [o/fe] ratio decreases faster for [fe/h] &gt; -2.0 dex,relative to the old models. for a typical elliptical of 10^11 m_sun of luminousmass, the new rate produces average [alpha/ fe] ratios in the dominant stellarpopulation still in agreement with observations. the type ia sn rate also inthis case shows an earlier peak and a subsequent faster decline relative to theprevious results, but the differences are smaller than in the case of ourgalaxy. we have also checked the effects of the new type ia sn rate on theevolution of the fe content in the icm, as a consequence of its production fromcluster ellipticals and we found that less fe in the icm is produced with thenew rate, due to the higher fraction of fe synthesized at early times andremaining locked into the stars in ellipticals. for dwarf irregular galaxiessuffering few bursts of star formation we obtain [o/fe] ratios larger by 0.2dex relative to the previous models.

astro-ph;0610241	the kormendy relation of massive elliptical galaxies at z~1.5. evidence  for size evolution ?	we present the morphological analysis based on hst-nic2 (0.075 arcsec/pixel)images in the f160w filter of a sample of 9 massive field (&gt; 10^{11} m_\odot)galaxies spectroscopically classified as early-types at 1.2&lt;z&lt;1.7. our analysisshows that all of them are bulge dominated systems. in particular, 6 of themare well fitted by a de vaucouleurs profile (n=4) suggesting that they can beconsidered pure elliptical galaxies. the remaining 3 galaxies are better fittedby a sersic profile with index 1.9&lt;n&lt;2.3 suggesting that a disk-like componentcould contribute up to 30% to the total light of these galaxies. we derived theeffective radius r_e and the mean surface brightness &lt;mu_e&gt; within r_e of ourgalaxies and we compared them with those of early-types at lower redshifts. wefind that the surface brightness &lt;mu_e&gt; of our galaxies should get fainter by2.5 mag from z~1.5 to z~0 to match the surface brightness of the localellipticals with comparable r_e, i.e. the local kormendy relation. luminosityevolution without morphological changes can only explain half of this effect,as the maximum dimming expected for an elliptical galaxy is ~1.6 mag in thisredshift range. thus, other parameters, possibly structural, may undergoevolution and play an important role in reconciling models and observations.hypothesizing an evolution of the effective radius of galaxies we find that r_eshould increase by a factor 1.5 from z~1.5 to z~0.

astro-ph;0610783	a nicmos search for obscured supernovae in starburst galaxies	the detection of obscured supernovae (sne) in near-infrared monitoringcampaigns of starburst galaxies has shown that a significant fraction of sne ismissed by optical surveys. however, the number of sne detected in ground-basednear-ir observations is still significantly lower than the number of sneextrapolated from the fir luminosity of the hosts. a possibility is that mostsne occur within the nuclear regions, where the limited angular resolution ofground-based observations prevents their detection. this issue prompted us toexploit the superior angular resolution of nicmos-hst to search for obscuredsne within the first kpc from the nucleus of strong starbursting galaxies. atotal of 17 galaxies were observed in snapshot mode. based on their firluminosity, we expected to detect not less than ~12 sne. however, no confirmedsn event was found. from our data we derive an observed nuclear sn rate &lt;0.5sn/yr per galaxy. the shortage of sn detections can be explained by acombination of several effects. the most important are: i) the existence of astrong extinction, a_v&gt;11; ii) most sne occur within the first 0.5" (whichcorresponds in our sample to about 500pc) where even nicmos is unable to detectsn events.

astro-ph;0702355	how many supernovae are we missing at high redshift?	near-infrared and radio searches for core-collapse supernovae (cc sne) in thelocal universe have shown that the vast majority of the events occurring inmassive starburst are missed by the current optical searches as they explode invery dusty environments. recent infrared observations have shown that thefraction of star-formation activity that takes place in very luminous dustystarbursts sharply increases with redshift and becomes the dominant starformation component at z&gt;0.5. as a consequence, an increasing fraction of sneare expected to be missed by high-redshift optical searches. we estimate that5-10% of the local cc sne are out of reach of the optical searches. thefraction of missing events rises sharply toward z=1, when about 30% of the ccsne will be undetected. at z=2 the missing fraction will be about 60%.correspondingly, for type ia sne, our computations provide missing fractions of15% at z=1 and 35% at z=2. such large corrections are crucially important tocompare the observed sn rate with the expectations from the evolution of thecosmic star formation history, and to design the future sn searches at highredshifts.

astro-ph;9610135	a narrowband imaging survey for high redshift galaxies in the near  infrared	a narrowband imaging survey of 276 square minutes of arc was carried out atnear infrared wavelengths to search for emission line objects at highredshifts. most of the fields contained a known quasar or radio galaxy at aredshift that placed one of the strong, restframe optical emission lines(h-alpha, [o iii], h-beta, or [o ii]) in the bandpass of the narrowband filter.the area weighted line flux limit over the entire survey was 3.4x10e-16erg/cm2/s (3-sigma), while the most sensitive limits reached 1.4x10e-16erg/cm2/s. integrating the volume covered by all four optical emission lines ineach image yields a total comoving volume surveyed of 1.4x10e5 cubicmegaparsecs. considering only h-alpha emission in the k band (2.05 &lt; z &lt; 2.65),where the survey is most sensitive, the survey covered a comoving volume of3.0x10e4 cubic megaparsecs to a volume-weighted average star formation rate of112 m-solar/yr (for ho = 50 km/s/mpc, omega = 1). this is the most extensivenear-infrared survey which is deep enough to have a reasonable chance atdetecting strong line emission from an actively star-forming population ofgalaxies, when d against simple models of galaxy formation. one emission linecandidate was identified in this survey, and subsequently confirmedspectroscopically.
