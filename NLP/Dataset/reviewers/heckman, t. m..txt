0902.0384	evidence for a non-uniform initial mass function in the local universe	many results in modern astrophysics rest on the notion that the initial massfunction (imf) is universal. our observations of hi selected galaxies in thelight of h-alpha and the far-ultraviolet (fuv) challenge this notion. the fluxratio h-alpha/fuv from these two star formation tracers shows strongcorrelations with the surface-brightness in h-alpha and the r band: low surfacebrightness (lsb) galaxies have lower ratios compared to high surface brightnessgalaxies and to expectations from equilibrium star formation models usingcommonly favored imf parameters. weaker but significant correlations ofh-alpha/fuv with luminosity, rotational velocity and dynamical mass are foundas well as a systematic trend with morphology. the correlated variations ofh-alpha/fuv with other global parameters are thus part of the larger family ofgalaxy scaling relations. the h-alpha/fuv correlations can not be due to dustcorrection errors, while systematic variations in the star formation historycan not explain the trends with both h-alpha and r surface brightness. lsbgalaxies are unlikely to have a higher escape fraction of ionizing photonsconsidering their high gas fraction, and color-magnitude diagrams. the mostplausible explanation for the correlations are systematic variations of theupper mass limit and/or slope of the imf at the upper end. we outline ascenario of pressure driving the correlations by setting the efficiency of theformation of the dense star clusters where the highest mass stars form. ourresults imply that the star formation rate measured in a galaxy is highlysensitive to the tracer used in the measurement. a non-universal imf also callsinto question the interpretation of metal abundance patterns in dwarf galaxiesand star formation histories derived from color magnitude diagrams. abridged.

0910.1352	local lyman break galaxy analogs: the impact of massive star-forming  clumps on the interstellar medium and the global structure of young, forming  galaxies	we present hst uv/optical imaging, spitzer mid-ir photometry, and opticalspectroscopy of a sample of 30 low-redshift (z=0.1-0.3) galaxies chosen fromsdss/galex to be accurate local analogs of the high-z lyman break galaxies. thelyman break analogs (lbas) are similar in mass, metallicity, dust, sfr, sizeand gas velocity dispersion, thus enabling a detailed investigation ofprocesses that are important at high-z. the optical emission line properties oflbas are also similar to those of lbgs, indicating comparable conditions intheir ism. in the uv, lbas are characterized by complexes of massivestar-forming "clumps", while in the optical they most often show evidence for(post-)mergers/interactions. in 6 cases, we find an extremely massive (&gt;10^9msun) compact (r~100 pc) dominant central object (dco). the dcos arepreferentially found in lbas with the highest mid-ir luminosities andcorrespondingly high sfrs (15-100 msun/yr). we show that the massive sf clumps(including the dcos) have masses much larger than the nuclear super starclusters seen in normal late type galaxies. however, the dcos have masses,sizes, and densities similar to the excess-light/central-cusps seen in typicalelliptical galaxies with masses similar to the lba galaxies. we suggest thatthe dcos form in present-day examples of the dissipative mergers at highredshift that are believed to have produced the central-cusps in localellipticals. more generally, the properties of the lbas are consistent with theidea that instabilities in a gas-rich disk lead to very massive star-formingclumps that eventually coalesce to form a spheroid. we speculate that the dcosare too young at present to be growing a supermassive black hole because theyare still in a supernova-dominated outflow phase.

0911.1279	morphologies of local lyman break galaxy analogs ii: a comparison with  galaxies at z=2-4 in acs and wfc3 images of the hubble ultra deep field	lyman break galaxies (lbgs) display a range in structures (fromsingle/compact to clumpy/extended) that is different from typical localstar-forming galaxies. recently, we have introduced a sample of rare, nearby(z&lt;0.3) starbursts that appear to be good analogs of lbgs. these "lyman breakanalogs" (lbas) provide an excellent training set for understanding starburstsat different redshifts. we present an application of this by comparing therest-frame uv/optical morphologies of 30 lbas with those of sbzk galaxies atz~2, and lbgs at z~3-4 in the hudf. the uv/optical colors and sizes of lbas andlbgs are very similar, while the bzk galaxies are somewhat redder and larger.there is significant overlap between the morphologies (g, c, a and m_20) of thelocal and high-z samples, although the latter are somewhat less concentratedand clumpier. we find that in the majority of lbas the starbursts appear to betriggered by interactions/mergers. when the images of the lbas are degraded tothe same sensitivity and resolution as the images of lbgs and bzk galaxies,these relatively faint asymmetric features are no longer detectable. thiseffect is particularly severe in the rest-frame uv. it has been suggested thathigh-z galaxies experience intense bursts unlike anything seen locally,possibly due to cold flows and instabilities. in part, this is based on thefact that the majority (~70%) of lbgs do not show morphological signatures ofmergers. our results suggest that this evidence is insufficient, since a largefraction of such signatures would likely have been missed in currentobservations of z&gt;2 galaxies. this leaves open the possibility that clumpyaccretion and mergers remain important in driving the evolution of thesestarbursts, together with rapid gas accretion through other means.

0911.1791	outlying hii regions in hi-selected galaxies	we present results from the first systematic search for outlying hii regions,as part of a sample of 96 emission-line point sources (referred to as eldots -emission-line dots) derived from the noao survey for ionization in neutral gasgalaxies (singg). our automated eldot-finder searches singg narrow-band andcontinuum images for high equivalent width point sources outside the opticalradius of the target galaxy (&gt; 2 x r25 in the r-band). follow-up longslitspectroscopy and deep galex images (exposure time &gt; 1000 s) distinguishoutlying hii regions from background galaxies whose strong emission lines([oiii], hbeta or [oii]) have been redshifted into the singg bandpass. we findthat these deep galex images can serve as a substitute for spectroscopicfollow-up because outlying hii regions separate cleanly from backgroundgalaxies in color-color space. we identify seven singg systems with outlyingmassive star formation that span a large range in halpha luminositiescorresponding to a few o stars in the most nearby cases, and unresolved dwarfsatellite companion galaxies in the most distant cases. six of these sevensystems feature galaxies with nearby companions or interacting galaxies.furthermore, our results indicate that some outlying hii regions are linked tothe extended-uv disks discovered by galex, representing emission from the mostmassive o stars among a more abundant population of lower mass (or older) starclusters. the overall frequency of outlying hii regions in this sample ofgas-rich galaxies is 8 - 11% when we correct for background emission-linegalaxy contamination (~75% of eldots).

0707.3415	uv to ir seds of uv selected galaxies in the elais fields: evolution of  dust attenuation and star formation activity from z=0.7 to z=0.2	we study the ultraviolet to far-infrared (hereafter uv-to-ir) seds of asample of intermediate redshift (0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.7) uv-selected galaxies from theelais-n1 and elais-n2 fields by fitting a multi-wavelength dataset to a libraryof grasil templates. star formation related properties of the galaxies arederived from the library of models by using the bayesian statistics. we find adecreasing presence of galaxies with low attenuation and low total luminosityas redshift decreases, which does not hold for high total luminosity galaxies.in addition the dust attenuation of low mass galaxies increases as redshiftdecreases, and this trend seems to disappear for galaxies with m* &gt; 10^11m_sun. this result is consistent with a mass dependent evolution of the dust togas ratio, which could be driven by a mass dependent efficiency of starformation in star forming galaxies. the specific star formation rates (ssfr)decrease with increasing stellar mass at all redshifts, and for a given stellarmass the ssfr decreases with decreasing redshift. the differences in the slopeof the m*--ssfr relation found between this work and others at similar redshiftcould be explained by the adopted selection criteria of the samples which, fora uv selected sample, favours blue, star forming galaxies.

1101.0853	uncovering obscured active galactic nuclei in homogeneously selected  samples of seyfert 2 galaxies	we have analyzed archival \textit{chandra} and \textit{xmm-newton} data fortwo nearly complete homogeneously selected samples of type 2 seyfert galaxies(sy2s). these samples were selected based on intrinsic active galactic nuclei(agn) flux proxies: a mid-infrared (mir) sample from the original iras 12$\mu$msurvey and an optical ([oiii]$\lambda$ 5007 \aa\ flux limited) sample from thesloan digital sky survey (sdss), providing a total of 45 sy2s. as the mir and[oiii] fluxes are largely unaffected by agn obscuration, these samples canpresent an unbiased estimate of the compton-thick (column density n$_h &gt;10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) subpopulation. we find that the majority of this combinedsample is likely heavily obscured, as evidenced by the 2-10 kev x-rayattenuation (normalized by intrinsic flux diagnostics) and the large fek$\alpha$ equivalent widths (several hundred ev to over 1 kev). a wide range ofthese obscuration diagnostics is present, showing a continuum of columndensities, rather than a clear segregation into compton-thick and compton-thinsub-populations. we find that in several instances, the fitted column densitiesseverely under-represent the attenuation implied by these obscurationdiagnostics, indicating that simple x-ray models may not always recover theintrinsic absorption. we compared agn and host galaxy properties, such asintrinsic luminosity, central black hole mass, accretion rate, and starformation rate with obscuration diagnostics. no convincing evidence exists tolink obscured sources with unique host galaxy populations from their lessabsorbed counterparts. finally, we estimate that a majority of these seyfert 2swill be detectable in the 10-40 kev range by the future nustar mission, whichwould confirm whether these heavily absorbed sources are indeed compton-thick.

1104.0414	alfalfa hi data stacking ii. hi content of the host galaxies of agn	we use a stacking technique to measure the average hi content of avolume-limited sample of 1871 agn host galaxies from a parent sample ofgalaxies selected from the sdss and galex imaging surveys with stellar massesgreater than 10^10 m_sun and redshifts in the range 0.025&lt;z&lt;0.05. hi data areavailable from the arecibo legacy fast alfa (alfalfa) survey. in previous work,we found that the hi gas fraction in galaxies correlates most strongly with thecombination of optical/uv colour and stellar surface mass density. we thereforebuild a control sample of non-agn matched to the agn hosts in these twoproperties. we study trends in hi gas mass fraction (m(hi)/m_*), where m_* isthe stellar mass) as a function of black hole accretion rate indicatorl[oiii]/m(bh). we find no significant difference in hi content between agn andcontrol samples at all values of black hole accretion rate probed by thegalaxies in our sample. this indicates that agn do not influence thelarge-scale gaseous properties of galaxies in the local universe. we havestudied the variation in hi mass fraction with black hole accretion rate in theblue and red galaxy populations. in the blue population, the hi gas fraction isindependent of accretion rate, indicating that accretion is not sensitive tothe properties of the interstellar medium of the galaxy on large scales.however, in the red population accretion rate and gas fraction do correlate.the measured gas fractions in this population are not too different from theones expected from a stellar mass loss origin, implying that the fuel supply inthe red agn population could be a mixture of mass loss from stars and gaspresent in disks.

1201.2397	on the fundamental dichotomy in the local radio-agn population:  accretion, evolution, and host galaxy properties	a sample of 18286 radio-loud agn is presented, constructed by combining thesdss dr7 with the nvss and first radio surveys. using this sample, thedifferences between `high-excitation' (or `quasar-mode'; herg) and`low-excitation' (`radio-mode'; lerg) radio galaxies are investigated. aprimary difference is the distinct nature of the eddington-scaled accretionrate onto their central black holes: hergs typically have accretion ratesbetween 1 and 10% of eddington, whereas lergs predominatly accrete at a ratebelow 1% eddington. this is consistent with models where the populationdichotomy is caused by a switch between radiatively efficient and inefficientaccretion modes at low accretion rates. local radio luminosity functions arederived separately for the two populations, showing that although lergsdominate at low luminosity and hergs above 1e26 w/hz, examples of both classesare found at all radio luminosities. using the v/vmax test it is shown that thepopulations show differential cosmic evolution at fixed radio luminosity: hergsevolve strongly at all luminosities, while lergs show weak or no evolution.this suggests that the luminosity-dependent evolution of the radio luminosityfunction is driven, at least in part, by the changing relative contributions ofthese two populations with luminosity. the host galaxies of the sources arealso distinct: hergs are typically of lower stellar mass, with lower black holemasses, bluer colours and weaker 4000-ang breaks indicating younger stellarpopulations. these results offer strong support to the picture in which hergsare fuelled at high rates through radiative accretion disks by cold gas,perhaps from mergers and interactions, while lergs are fuelled via radiativelyinefficient flows at low accretion rates, often by gas associated with the hotx-ray haloes of their host galaxy/cluster, as part of a radio-agn feedback loop(abridged).

1206.5830	exploring the connection between star formation and agn activity in the  local universe	we study a combined sample of 264 star-forming, 51 composite, and 73 activegalaxies using optical spectra from sdss and mid-infrared (mid-ir) spectra fromthe spitzer infrared spectrograph. we examine optical and mid-ir spectroscopicdiagnostics that probe the amount of star formation and relative energeticcontributions from star formation and an active galactic nucleus (agn). overallwe find good agreement between optical and mid-ir diagnostics.misclassifications of galaxies based on the sdss spectra are rare despite thepresence of dust obscuration. the luminosity of the [neii] 12.8 \mu memission-line is well correlated with the star formation rate (sfr) measuredfrom the sdss spectra, and this holds for the star forming, composite, andagn-dominated systems. agn show a clear excess of [neiii] 15.6 \mu m emissionrelative to star forming and composite systems. we find good qualitativeagreement between various parameters that probe the relative contributions ofthe agn and star formation, including: the mid-ir spectral slope, the ratio ofthe [nev] 14.3 \mu m to [neii] \mu m 12.8 fluxes, the equivalent widths of the7.7, 11.3, and 17 $\mu m$ pah features, and the optical "d" parameter whichmeasures the distance a source lies from the locus of star forming galaxies inthe optical bpt emission-line diagnostic diagram. we also consider the behaviorof the three individual pah features by examining how their flux ratios dependupon the degree of agn-dominance. we find that the pah 11.3 \mu m feature issignificantly suppressed in the most agn-dominated systems.

1208.6233	disentangling agn and star formation in soft x-rays	we have explored the interplay of star formation and agn activity in softx-rays (0.5-2 kev) in two samples of seyfert 2 galaxies (sy2s). using acombination of low resolution ccd spectra from chandra and xmm-newton, wemodeled the soft emission of 34 sy2s using power law and thermal models. forthe 11 sources with high signal-to-noise chandra imaging of the diffuse hostgalaxy emission, we estimate the luminosity due to star formation by removingthe agn, fitting the residual emission. the agn and star formationcontributions to the soft x-ray luminosity (i.e. l$_{x,agn}$ and l$_{x,sf}$)for the remaining 24 sy2s were estimated from the power law and thermalluminosities derived from spectral fitting. these luminosities were scaledbased on a template derived from xsings analysis of normal star forminggalaxies. to account for errors in the luminosities derived from spectralfitting and the spread in the scaling factor, we estimated l$_{x,agn}$ andl$_{x,sf}$ from monte carlo simulations. these simulated luminosities agreewith l$_{x,agn}$ and l$_{x,sf}$ derived from chandra imaging analysis within a3\sigma\ confidence level. using the infrared [neii]12.8\mu m and [oiv]26\mu mlines as a proxy of star formation and agn activity, respectively, weindependently disentangle the contributions of these two processes to the totalsoft x-ray emission. this decomposition generally agrees with l$_{x,sf}$ andl$_{x,agn}$ at the 3\sigma\ level. in the absence of resolvable nuclearemission, our decomposition method provides a reasonable estimate of emissiondue to star formation in galaxies hosting type 2 agn.

1209.0476	the impact of interactions, bars, bulges, and agn on star formation  efficiency in local massive galaxies	using observations from the gass and cold gass surveys and complementary datafrom sdss and galex, we investigate the nature of variations in gas depletiontime observed across the local massive galaxy population. the large andunbiased cold gass sample allows us to assess the relative importance of galaxyinteractions, bar instabilities, morphologies and the presence of agn inregulating star formation efficiency. both the h2 mass fraction and depletiontime vary as a function of the distance of a galaxy from the main sequence inthe sfr-m* plane. the longest gas depletion times are found in below-mainsequence bulge-dominated galaxies that are either gas-poor, or else on averageless efficient than disk-dominated galaxy at converting into stars any cold gasthey may have. we find no link between agn and these long depletion times. thegalaxies undergoing mergers or showing signs of morphological disruptions havethe shortest molecular gas depletion times, while those hosting strong stellarbars have only marginally higher global star formation efficiencies as comparedto matched control samples. our interpretation is that depletion timevariations are caused by changes in the ratio between the gas mass traced bythe co(1-0) observations, and the gas mass in high density star-forming cores,with interactions, mergers and bar instabilities able to locally increasepressure and raise the ratio of efficiently star-forming gas to co-detectedgas. building a sample representative of the local massive galaxy population,we derive a global kennicutt-schmidt relation of slope 1.18+/-0.24, and observestructure within the scatter around this relation, with galaxies having low(high) stellar mass surface densities lying systematically above (below) themean relation, suggesting that gas surface density is not the only parameterdriving the global star formation ability of a galaxy.

1406.5563	theoretical modeling of emission-line galaxies: new classification  parameters for mid-infrared and optical spectroscopy	we have carried out extensive and detailed photoionization modeling tosuccessfully constrain the locations of different emission-line galaxies inoptical and mid-infrared diagnostic diagrams. our model grids cover a widerange in parameter space for the active galaxy continuum and starburst galaxieswith different stellar population laws and metallicities. we compare thepredicted agn and star-formation mid-infrared line ratios [ne iii]15.56mm/[neii]12.81mm and [o iv]25.89mm/[ne iii]15.56mm to the observed values, and findthat the best fit for the agn is via a two-zone approximation. this two-zoneapproximation is a combination of a matter-bounded component, where [ne iii]and [o iv] are emitted efficiently, and a radiation-bounded component thatmaximizes [ne ii] emission. we overlay the predictions from this two-zoneapproximation onto the optical [o iii]l5007/hbeta and [n ii]l6583/halphadiagnostic diagram derived from the sloan digital sky survey, to find that thehigh-density and low-ionization radiation-bounded component in our two-zone agnapproximation model provides a good lower limit for [n ii] emission. thisestablishes a new theoretical demarcation line for the minimum agn contributionin this diagram. this new classification results by a factor of ~1.4 in ahigher agn population than predictions derived from previous divisions ofstar-forming galaxies. similarly, we define a maximum agn contribution in the[o iii]/hbeta and [n ii]/halpha diagram by using a two-zone approximationwithin a parameter range typical of the narrow-line region.

astro-ph;0003020	ambiguities in fits to the complex x-ray spectra of starburst galaxies	spectral fits to x-ray data from both ngc 253 and m 82 provide ambiguousresults. the so-called ``best fit'' results depend on the instrument with whichthe data were obtained and obviously on the choice of spectral modelcomposition. we show that different spectral models can be fit equally well tobepposax data of both galaxies. metallicities are unreliable in general, with astrong dependence on the choice of model. preference to one particular spectralmodel can only be given by combining spectroscopic and imaging x-ray data fromall available satellites (rosat, asca, and bepposax). based on spectra of ngc253, we demonstrate that a model consisting of two or more thermal plasmacomponents plus a hard power law continuum and fe k alpha line emission canexplain all observations. these model components represent the integralspectrum of thermal gas and compact sources in starburst galaxies that are mostlikely supernova remnants and x-ray binaries. the same model can fit the x-raydata of m 82, but there the evidence, from rosat imaging, of the existence ofcompact sources which might represent high-mass x-ray binaries is weaker. thisimplies that its hard x-ray emission, which is extended in rosat images, might- if truly diffuse - be dominated by a very hot (several kev energy) thermalgas component.

astro-ph;0012036	the seyfert-starburst connection in x-rays. ii. results and implications	we present the results of x-ray imaging and spectroscopic analysis of asample of seyfert 2 galaxies that contain starbursts, based on their opticaland uv characteristics. these composite galaxies exhibit extended, soft,thermal x-ray emission, which we attribute to their starburst components.comparing their x-ray and far-infrared properties with ordinary seyfert andstarburst galaxies, we identify the spectral characteristics of their variousintrinsic emission sources. the observed far-infrared emission of the compositegalaxies may be associated almost exclusively with star formation, rather thanthe active nucleus. the ratio of the hard x-ray luminosity to the far-infraredand [o iii] 5007 luminosity distinguishes most of these composite galaxies from``pure'' seyfert 2 galaxies, while their total observed hard x-ray luminositydistinguishes them from ``pure'' starbursts. the hard nuclear x-ray source isgenerally heavily absorbed (n_h &gt; 10^{23} cm^{-2}) in the composite galaxies.based on these results, we suggest that the interstellar medium of the nuclearstarburst is a significant source of absorption. the majority of the sample arelocated in groups or are interacting with other galaxies, which may trigger thestarburst or allow rapid mass infall to the central black hole, or both. weconclude that starbursts are energetically important in a significant fractionof active galaxies, and starbursts and active galactic nuclei may be part of acommon evolutionary sequence.

astro-ph;0102283	fuse observations of outflowing ovi in the dwarf starburst galaxy  ngc1705	we report fuse far-uv spectroscopy of the prototypical dwarf starburst galaxyngc 1705. these data allow us for the first time to probe the coronal-phase gas(t = 10e5 to 10e6 k) that may dominate the radiative cooling of thesupernova-heated ism and thereby determine the dynamical evolution ofstarburst-driven outflows. we detect a broad (100 km/s) and blueshifted (by 80km/s) ovi absorption-line arising in the previously-known galactic outflow. theproperties of the ovi absorption are inconsistent with the standard superbubblemodel in which this gas arises in a conductive interface inside the outershell. we show that the superbubble in ngc 1705 is blowing out of the galaxyism. during blow-out, coronal-phase gas can be created by hydrodynamical mixingas hot gas rushes out through fissures in the fragmenting shell of cool gas. asthe coronal gas cools radiatively, it can naturally produce the observed ovicolumn density and outflow speed. the ovi data show that the cooling rate inthe coronal-phase gas is less than about 10% of the supernova heating rate.since the x-ray luminosity from hotter gas is even smaller, we conclude thatradiative losses are insignificant. the outflow should be able to vent itsmetals and kinetic energy out of the galaxy. this process has potentiallyimportant implications for the evolution of dwarf galaxies and the igm.

astro-ph;0104316	the obscuring starburst of ngc 6221 and implications for the hard x-ray  background	we present ngc 6221 as a case study of ``x-ray loud composite galaxies,''which appear similar to starbursts at optical wavelengths and resembletraditional active galactic nuclei in x-rays. the net optical spectrum of ngc6221 is properly characterized as a starburst galaxy, but in x-rays, ngc 6221is similar to seyfert 1 galaxies, exhibiting a power-law continuum spectrum, abroad fe k alpha line, and continuum variability on timescales of days andyears. high-resolution images reveal that the detected active nucleus isrelatively weak, not only at optical, but also at near-infrared wavelengths. anobscuring starburst, in which the interstellar gas and dust associated with thestarburst conceal the active nucleus, accounts for these peculiar features. wedemonstrate quantitatively that obscuration by column density n_h = 10^{22}cm^{-2} combined with relatively weak intrinsic nuclear activity can produce anoptical spectrum characteristic of the surrounding starburst alone. whileoptical surveys would not identify the active nuclei that make these galaxiessignificant x-ray sources, such galaxies may in fact be important contributorsto the x-ray background.

astro-ph;0107115	another intermediate mass black hole in a starburst galaxy?: the  luminous x-ray source in ngc 3628 reappears	in a 52 ks-long chandra acis-s observation of the nearby starburst galaxy ngc3628, obtained to study the starburst-driven outflow from this galaxy, we havedetected a very luminous (l_x = 1.1e40 erg/s in the 0.3-8.0 kev energy band)point source located at least 20 arcsec (~970 pc) from the nucleus of thegalaxy. no radio, optical or near-ir counterpart to this source has been found.  this is most probably the reappearance of the strongly-variablex-ray-luminous source discovered by dahlem et al (1995), which faded by afactor &gt;27 between december 1991 and march 1994 (at which point it had fadedbelow the detection limit in a rosat hri observation). this source is clearly amember of an enigmatic class of x-ray sources that are considerably moreluminous than conventional x-ray binaries but less luminous than agn, and whichare not found at the dynamical center of the host galaxy.  the chandra spectrum is best-fit by an absorbed power law model with a photonindex of gamma = 1.8+/-0.2, similar to that seen in galactic bh binarycandidates in their hard state. bremsstrahlung models or multi-color diskmodels (the favored spectral model for objects in this class based on ascaobservations) can provide statistically acceptable fits only if the data atenergies e &gt; 5 kev is ignored. this is one of the first x-ray spectra of suchan object that is unambiguously that of the source alone, free from thespectral contamination by x-ray emission from the rest of the galaxy thataffects previous spectral studies of these objects using asca.

astro-ph;0111511	chandra observations of ngc 253. ii: on the origin of diffuse x-ray  emission in the halos of starburst galaxies	we present a detailed case study of the diffuse x-ray and h-alpha emission inthe halo of ngc 253, a nearby edge-on starburst galaxy driving a galacticsuperwind. the arcsecond spatial resolution of the chandra acis instrumentallows us to study the spatial and spectral properties of the diffuse x-rayemitting plasma with greatly superior spatial and spectral resolution comparedto previous x-ray instruments. we find statistically significant structurewithin the x-ray diffuse emission on angular scales down to ~10 arcsec (~130pc). there is no statistically significant evidence for any spatial variationin the spectral properties of the diffuse emission, over scales from ~400 pc to\~3 kpc. we show that the x-shaped soft x-ray morphology of the superwind,previously revealed by rosat, is matched by very similar x-shaped h-alphaemission, extending at least 8 kpc above the plane of the galaxy. in thenorthern halo the x-ray emission appears to lie slightly interior to theboundary marked by the h-alpha emission. the total 0.3-2.0 kev energy bandx-ray luminosity of the northern halo, l_x ~ 5e38 erg/s, is very similar to thehalo h-alpha luminosity of l_ha ~ 4e38 erg/s, both of which are a smallfraction of the estimated wind energy injection rate of ~1e42 erg/s fromsupernovae in the starburst. we show that there are a variety of models thatcan simultaneously explain spatially-correlated x-ray and h-alpha emission inthe halos of starburst galaxies. these findings indicate that the physicalorigin of the x-ray-emitting million-degree plasma in superwinds is closelylinked to the presence of much cooler and denser t ~ 1e4 k gas, not only withinthe central kpc regions of starbursts, but also on ~10 kpc-scales within thehalos of these galaxies.

astro-ph;0301622	no x-ray bright type ii quasars among the lyman-alpha emitters	the lyman-alpha emitters found at z=4.5 and 5.7 by the large area lyman alpha(lala) survey have high equivalent widths in the lyman-alpha line. such linescan be produced by narrow-lined active galactic nuclei (agns) or by stellarpopulations with a very high proportion of young, massive stars. to check fortype-ii (i.e., narrow-lined) quasars, we obtained a deep x-ray image of 49lyman-alpha sources in a single field of the acis instrument on the chandrax-ray observatory. none of these sources were detected with a 3-sigma limitingx-ray luminosity of 2.9x10^{43} ergs/s. for comparison, the two known highredshift type-ii quasars have luminosities of 4x10^{43} ergs/s beforeextinction correction. the sources remain undetected in stacked images of the49 lyman-alpha sources (with 6.5 mega-seconds effective chandra on-axisexposure) at 3-sigma limits of 4.9x10^{42} ergs/s. the resulting x-ray tolyman-alpha ratio is about 4-24 times lower than the ratio for known type-iiquasars, while the average lyman-alpha luminosity of the lala sample is inbetween the two type-ii's. the cumulative x-ray to lyman-alpha ratio limit isalso below that of 90% of low-redshift seyfert galaxies.

astro-ph;0306592	a high spatial resolution x-ray and h-alpha study of hot gas in the  halos of star-forming disk galaxies. i. spatial and spectral properties of  the diffuse x-ray emission	we present arcsecond resolution chandra x-ray and ground-based opticalh-alpha imaging of a sample of ten edge-on star-forming disk galaxies (sevenstarburst and three ``normal'' spiral galaxies), a sample which covers the fullrange of star-formation intensity found in disk galaxies. we use theunprecedented spatial resolution of the chandra x-ray observatory to robustlyremove point sources, and hence obtain the x-ray properties of the diffusethermal emission alone. the x-ray observations are combined withcomparable-resolution h-alpha and r-band imaging, and presented as a mini-atlasof images on a common spatial and surface brightness scale. the verticaldistribution of the halo-region x-ray surface brightness is best described asan exponential, with the observed scale heights lying in the range h_eff = 2 --4 kpc. the acis x-ray spectra of extra-planar emission from all these galaxiescan be fit with a common two-temperature spectral model with an enhancedalpha-to-iron element ratio. this is consistent with the origin of the x-rayemitting gas being either metal-enriched merged sn ejecta or shock-heatedambient halo or disk material with moderate levels of metal depletion ontodust. the thermal x-ray emission observed in the halos of the starburstgalaxies is either this pre-existing halo medium, which has been swept-up andshock heated by the starburst-driven wind, or wind material compressed near thewalls of the outflow by reverse shocks within the wind. in either case thex-ray emission provides us with a powerful probe of the properties of gaseoushalos around star-forming disk galaxies.

astro-ph;0306598	a high spatial resolution x-ray and h-alpha study of hot gas in the  halos of star-forming disk galaxies. ii. quantifying supernova feedback	we investigate how the empirical properties of hot x-ray-emitting gas in asample of seven starburst and three normal edge-on spiral galaxies (a samplewhich covers the full range of star-formation intensity found in disk galaxies)correlate with the size, mass, star formation rate and star formation intensityin the host galaxies. intriguingly, the diffuse x-ray properties of the normalspirals (both in their disks and halos) fall where extrapolation of the trendsfrom the starburst galaxies with superwinds would predict. we demonstrate thatthe luminosity of diffuse x-ray emission in both disk and halo is directlyproportional to the rate of mechanical energy feedback from massive stars.nevertheless, with only three non-starburst normal spiral galaxies it is hardto exclude an accretion-based origin for extra-planar diffuse x-ray emissionaround normal star-forming galaxies. larger galaxies have more extendedx-ray-emitting halos, but galaxy mass appears to play no role in determiningthe properties of the disk or extra-planar x-ray emitting plasma. thecombination of these luminosity and size correlations leads to a correlationbetween the surface brightness of the diffuse x-ray emission and the mean starformation rate per unit area in the disk (l_fir/d_25^2). we argue that thecrucial spatial region around a galaxy that controls whether gas instarburst-driven superwinds will escape into the igm is not the outer halo ~100kpc from the host galaxy, but the inner few halo scale heights, within ~20 kpcof the galaxy plane. given the properties of the gaseous halos we observe,superwind outflows from disk galaxies of mass m ~ 10^10 -- 10^11 msun shouldstill eject some fraction of their material into the igm.

astro-ph;0406378	far ultraviolet observations of molecular hydrogen in the diffuse  interstellar medium of starburst galaxies	(abridged) we have used the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer (fuse) tosearch for h_2 absorption in five starburst galaxies: ngc 1705, ngc 3310, ngc4214, m83 (ngc 5236), and ngc 5253. we tentatively detect weak absorption byh_2 in m83 and ngc 5253, and set upper limits on the h_2 column density in theother galaxies. conservative upper limits on the mass of molecular gas detectedwith fuse are many orders of magnitude lower than the h_2 mass inferred from coemission. this indicates that almost all of the h_2 is in the form of cloudswith n(h_2)&gt;10^20 cm^-2 that are opaque to far-uv light and therefore cannot beprobed with far-uv absorption measurements. the far-uv continuum visible in thefuse spectra passes between the dense clouds, which have a covering factor &lt;1.the complex observational biases related to varying extinction across theextended uv emission in the fuse apertures prevent an unambiguouscharacterization of the diffuse h_2 in these starbursts. however, the evidenceis suggestive that there is less h_2 in the diffuse interstellar medium betweenthe dense clouds compared to similarly reddened sight lines in the milky way.this holds with the expectation that the destructive uv radiation field isstronger in starbursts. however, previous uv observations of these starburstshave shown that there is reddening caused by the diffuse interstellar medium.this suggests that while diffuse h_2 may be destroyed in the starburst, duststill exists.

astro-ph;0411336	a comparative study of the spatial distribution of ultraviolet and  far-infrared fluxes from m 101	the total ultraviolet (uv) flux (from 1412 to 2718 aa) of m 101 is comparedon a pixel-to-pixel basis with the total far-infrared (fir) flux (from 60 to170 micron), using the maps of the galaxy taken by galex in the near-uv andfar-uv and by isophot at 60, 100 and 170 micron. the main result of thisinvestigation is the discovery of a tight dependence of the fir/uv ratio onradius, with values monotonically decreasing from around 4 in the nuclearregion to nearly zero towards the edge of the optical disk.  although the tightness of this dependence is in part attributable toresolution effects, the result is consistent with the presence of a large-scaledistribution of diffuse dust having a face-on optical depth which decreaseswith radius and which dominates over the more localized variations in opacitybetween the arm and interarm regions. we also find a trend for the fir/uv ratioto take on higher values in the regions of diffuse interarm emission than inthe spiral-arm regions, at a given radius. this is interpreted quantitativelyin terms of the escape probability of uv photons from spiral arms and theirsubsequent scattering in the interarm regions, and in terms of the largerrelative contribution of optical photons to the heating of the dust in theinterarm regions.

astro-ph;0411343	dust attenuation in the nearby universe: comparison between galaxies  selected in the ultraviolet or in the infrared	we compare the dust attenuation properties of two samples of galaxies purelyselected in the near-ultraviolet (nuv) band (1750-2750 a, lambda_m = 2310 a)and in the far-infrared (fir) at 60micron. these samples are built using thegalex and iras sky surveys over ~600 square degrees. the nuv selected samplecontains 95 galaxies detected down to nuv=16mag (ab system). 83 galaxies inthis sample are spirals or irregulars and only two of them are not detected at60micron. the fir selected sample is built from the iras pscz catalog completedown to 0.6jy. among the 163 sources, we select 118 star forming galaxies wellmeasured by iras, all but 1 are detected in nuv and 14 galaxies are notdetected in the far-ultraviolet (fuv) band (1350-1750 a, lambda_m = 1530 a).the dust to ultraviolet (nuv and fuv) flux ratio is calibrated to estimate thedust attenuation at both wavelengths. the median value of the attenuation innuv is found to be ~1 mag for the nuv selected sample versus ~2 mag for the firselected one. within both samples, the dust attenuation is found to correlatewith the luminosity of the galaxies. almost all the nuv selected galaxies and2/3 of the fir selected sample exhibit a lower dust attenuation than thatexpected from the tight relation found previously for starburst galaxiesbetween the dust attenuation and the slope of the ultraviolet continuum. thesituation is inverse for one third of the fir selected galaxies: theirextinction is higher than that deduced from their fuv-nuv color and therelation valid for starbursts.

astro-ph;0411372	uv emission from stellar populations within tidal tails: catching the  youngest galaxies in formation?	new galex observations have detected significant fuv (1530 angstroms) and nuv(2310 angstroms) emission from stellar substructures within the tidal tails offour ongoing galaxy mergers. the uv-bright regions are optically faint and arecoincident with hi density enhancements. fuv emission is detected at anylocation where the hi surface density exceeds ~2 m_sun pc^{-2}, and is oftendetected in the absence of visible wavelength emission. uv luminosities of thebrighter regions of the tidal tails imply masses of 10^6 m_sun to ~10^9 m_sunin young stars in the tails, and hi luminosities imply similar hi masses.uv-optical colors of the tidal tails indicate stellar populations as young as afew myr, and in all cases ages &lt; 400myr. most of the young stars in the tailsformed in single bursts rather than resulting from continuous star formation,and they formed *in situ* as the tails evolved. star formation appears to beolder near the parent galaxies and younger at increasing distances from theparent galaxy. this could be because the star formation occurs progressivelyalong the tails, or because the star formation has been inhibited near thegalaxy/tail interface. the youngest stellar concentrations, usually near theends of long tidal tails, have masses comparable to confirmed tidal dwarfgalaxies and may be newly forming galaxies undergoing their first burst of starformation.

astro-ph;0411390	galex uv spectroscopy and deep imaging of lirgs in the elais s1 field	the elais s1 field was observed by galex in both its wide spectroscopic anddeep imaging survey modes. this field was previously observed by the infraredspace observatory and we made use of the catalogue of multi-wavelength datapublished by the elais consortium to select galaxies common to the two samples.among the 959 objects with galex spectroscopy, 88 are present in the elaiscatalog and 19 are galaxies with an optical spectroscopic redshift. thedistribution of redshifts covers the range $0&lt;z&lt;1.6$. the selected galaxieshave bolometric ir luminosities $10&lt;log(l_{ir})&lt;13$ (deduced from the $15 \mum$ flux using isocam) which means that we cover a wide range of galaxies fromnormal to ultra luminous ir galaxies. the mean ($\sigma$) uv luminosity (notcorrected for extinction) amounts to $log(\lambda.l_{1530}) = 9.8 (0.6)$$l_\sun$ for the low-z ($z \le 0.35$) sample. the uv slope $\beta$ (assuming$f_\lambda \propto \lambda^\beta$) correlates with the galex fuv-nuv color ifthe sample is restricted to galaxies below $z &lt; 0.1$. taking advantage of theuv and ir data, we estimate the dust attenuation from the ir/uv ratio andcompare it to the uv slope $\beta$. we find that it is not possible to uniquelyestimate the dust attenuation from $\beta$ for our sample of galaxies. thesegalaxies are highly extinguished with a median value $a_{fuv} = 2.7 \pm 0.8$.once the dust correction applied, the uv- and ir-based sfrs correlate. for theclosest galaxy with the best quality spectrum, we see a feature consistent withbeing produced by a bump near 220nm in the attenuation curve.

astro-ph;0411644	deconstructing ngc 7130	observations of the seyfert 2 and starburst galaxy ngc 7130 with the chandrax-ray observatory illustrate that both of these phenomena contributesignificantly to the galaxy's detectable x-ray emission. the active galacticnucleus (agn) is strongly obscured, buried beneath column density n_h &gt; 10^{24}cm^{-2}, and it is most evident in a prominent fe k alpha emission line withequivalent width greater than 1 kev. the agn accounts for most (60%) of theobserved x-rays at energy e &gt; 2 kev, with the remainder due to spatiallyextended star formation. the soft x-ray emission is strong and predominantlythermal, on both small and large scales. we attribute the thermal emission tostellar processes. in total, the agn is responsible for only one-third of theobserved 0.5--10 kev luminosity of 3 x 10^{41} erg/s of this galaxy, and lessthan half of its bolometric luminosity. starburst/agn composite galaxies likengc 7130 are truly common, and similar examples may contribute significantly tothe high-energy cosmic x-ray background while remaining hidden at lowerenergies, especially if they are distant.

astro-ph;0506268	a sample of radio-loud agn in the sloan digital sky survey	a sample of 2712 radio-luminous galaxies is defined from the second datarelease of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) by cross-comparing the mainspectroscopic galaxy sample with two radio surveys: the nrao vla sky survey(nvss) and the faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimetres (first)survey. the comparison is carried out in a multi-stage process and makesoptimal use of both radio surveys by exploiting the sensitivity of the nvss toextended and multi-component radio sources in addition to the high angularresolution of the first images. a radio source sample with 95% completeness and98.9% reliability is achieved, far better than would be possible for thissample if only one of the surveys was used. the radio source sample is thendivided into two classes: radio-loud agn and galaxies in which the radioemission is dominated by star formation. the division is based on the locationof a galaxy in the plane of 4000ang break strength versus radio luminosity perunit stellar mass and provides a sample of 2215 radio-loud agn and 497 starforming galaxies brighter than 5mjy at 1.4ghz. a full catalogue of positionsand radio properties is provided for these sources. the local radio luminosityfunction is then derived both for radio-loud agn and for star-forming galaxiesand is found to be in agreement with previous studies. by using the radio tofar-ir correlation, the radio luminosity function of star forming galaxies isalso compared to the luminosity function derived in the far-infrared. it isfound to agree well at high luminosities but less so at lower luminosities,confirming that the linearity of the radio to far-ir correlation breaks downbelow about 10^22 w/hz at 1.4ghz.

astro-ph;0506269	the host galaxies of radio-loud agn: mass dependencies, gas cooling and  agn feedback	the properties of the host galaxies of a well-defined sample of 2215radio-loud agn with redshifts 0.03 &lt; z &lt; 0.3, defined from the sdss, areinvestigated. these are predominantly low radio luminosity sources, with 1.4ghzluminosities of 10^23 to 10^25 w/hz. the fraction of galaxies that hostradio-loud agn with l(1.4ghz) &gt; 10^23 w/hz is a strong function of stellarmass, rising from nearly zero below a stellar mass of 10^10 msun to more than30% at 5x10^11 msun. the integral radio luminosity function is derived in sixranges of stellar and black hole mass. its shape is very similar in all ofthese ranges and can be well fitted by a broken power-law. its normalisationvaries strongly with mass, as m_*^2.5 or m_bh^1.6; this scaling only begins tobreak down when the predicted radio-loud fraction exceeds 20-30%. there is nocorrelation between radio and emission line luminosities for the radio-loud agnin the sample and the probability that a galaxy of given mass is radio-loud isindependent of whether it is optically classified as an agn. the host galaxiesof the radio-loud agn have properties similar to those of ordinary galaxies ofthe same mass.  all of these findings support the conclusion that the optical agn and lowradio luminosity agn phenomena are independent and are triggered by differentphysical mechanisms. intriguingly, the dependence on black hole mass of theradio-loud agn fraction mirrors that of the rate at which gas cools from thehot atmospheres of elliptical galaxies. it is speculated that gas coolingprovides a natural explanation for the origin of the radio-loud agn activity,and it is argued that agn heating could plausibly balance the cooling of thegas over time.

astro-ph;0506383	the excess far-infrared emission of agn in the local universe	we have cross-correlated the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) second datarelease spectroscopic galaxy sample with the iras faint-source catalogue (fsc).optical emission line ratios are used to classify the galaxies with reliableiras 60 and 100 microns detections into agn and normal star-forming galaxies.we then create subsamples of normal galaxies and agn that are very closelymatched in terms of key physical properties such as stellar mass, redshift,size, concentration and mean stellar age (as measured by absorption lineindicators in the sdss spectra). we then quantify whether there are systematicdifferences between the ir luminosities of the galaxies and the agn in thematched subsamples. we find that the agn exhibit a significant excess in far-iremission relative to the star-forming galaxies in our sample. the excesses at60 and 100 microns are 0.21 +/- 0.03 dex and 0.12 +/- 0.035 dex inlog[l(60)/m*] and log[l(100)/m*], respectively. we then discuss whether thefar-ir excess is produced by radiation from the active nucleus that is absorbedby dust or alternatively, by an extra population of young stars that is notdetectable at optical wavelengths.

astro-ph;0506645	the dynamics and high-energy emission of conductive gas clouds in  supernova-driven galactic superwinds	in this paper we present high-resolution hydrodynamical models of warmionized clouds embedded in a superwind, and compare the ovi and soft x-rayproperties to the existing observational data. these models include thermalconduction, which we show plays an important role in shaping both the dynamicsand radiative properties of the resulting wind/cloud interaction. heatconduction stabilizes the cloud by inhibiting the growth of k-h and r-tinstabilities, and also generates a shock wave at the cloud's surface thatcompresses the cloud. this dynamical behaviour influences the observableproperties. we find that while ovi emission and absorption always arises incloud material at the periphery of the cloud, most of the soft x-ray arises inthe region between the wind bow shock and the cloud surface, and probes eitherwind or cloud material depending on the strength of conduction and the relativeabundances of the wind with respect to the cloud. in general only a smallfraction (&lt;1%) of the wind mechanical energy intersecting a cloud is radiatedaway at uv and x-ray wavelengths, with more wind energy going into acceleratingthe cloud. models with heat conduction at spitzer-levels are found to produceobservational properties closer to those observed in superwinds than modelswith no thermal conduction, in particular in terms of the ovi-to-x-rayluminosity ratio, but cloud life times are uncomfortably short (&lt;1myr) comparedto the dynamical ages of real winds. we experimented with reducing the thermalconductivity and found that even when we reduced conduction by a factor of 25that the simulations retained the beneficial hydrodynamical stability and lowo{\sc vi}-to-x-ray luminosity ratio found in the spitzer-level conductivemodels, while also having reduced evaporation rates.

astro-ph;0507674	the relationship of hard x-ray and optical line emission in low redshift  active galactic nuclei	in this paper we assess the relationship of the population of active galacticnuclei (agn) selected by hard x-rays to the traditional population of agn withstrong optical emission lines. first, we study the emission-line properties ofa new hard x-ray selected sample of 47 local agn (classified optically as bothtype 1 and type 2 agn). we find that the hard x- ray (3-20 kev) and[oiii]$\lambda$5007 optical emission-line luminosities are well-correlated overa range of about four orders-of-magnitude in luminosity (mean luminosity ratio2.15 dex with a standard deviation of $\sigma$ = 0.51 dex). second, we studythe hard x-ray properties of a sample of 55 local agn selected from theliterature on the basis of the flux in the [oiii] line. the correlation betweenthe hard x-ray (2-10 kev) and [oiii] luminosity for the type 1 agn isconsistent with what is seen in the hard x-ray selected sample. however, thetype 2 agn have a much larger range in the luminosity ratio, and many are veryweak in hard x-rays (as expected for heavily absorbed agn). we then compare thehard x-ray (3-20 kev) and [oiii] luminosity functions of agn in the localuniverse. these have similar faint-end slopes with a luminosity ratio of 1.60dex (0.55 dex smaller than the mean value for individual hard x-ray selectedagn). we conclude that at low redshift, selection by narrow optical emission-lines will recover most agn selected by hard x-rays (with the exception of bllac objects). however, selection by hard x-rays misses a significant fractionof the local agn population with strong emission lines.

astro-ph;0602171	agn-controlled cooling in elliptical galaxies	a long-standing problem for models of galaxy formation has been the mismatchbetween the predicted shape of the mass function of dark matter halos and theobserved shape of the luminosity function of galaxies. the number of massivehalos is predicted to decrease as a power law (n proportional to m^-2) out tovery large masses, while the galaxy luminosity function cuts off exponentiallyat luminosities above l*. this implies that the efficiency with which gas coolsonto massive systems is lower than expected. this letter investigates the roleof radio-loud active galactic nuclei (agn) in continually re-heating thecooling gas. by combining two observational results, the time-averaged energyoutput associated with recurrent radio source activity is determined, as afunction of the black hole mass of the host galaxy: h = 10^21.4 (m_bh /m_sun)^1.6 w. it is shown that for massive elliptical galaxies thisradio-source heating balances the radiative energy losses from the hot gassurrounding the galaxy. the recurrent radio-loud agn activity may thereforeprovide a self-regulating feedback mechanism capable of controlling the rate ofgrowth of galaxies.

astro-ph;0604442	the survey for ionization in neutral gas galaxies- ii. the star  formation rate density of the local universe	we derive observed halpha and r band luminosity densities of an hi-selectedsample of nearby galaxies using the singg sample to be l_halpha' = (9.4 +/-1.8)e38 h_70 erg s^-1 mpc^-3 for halpha and l_r' = (4.4 +/- 0.7)e37 h_70 ergs^-1 a^-1 mpc^-3 in the r band. this r band luminosity density is approximately70% of that found by the sloan digital sky survey. this leads to a local starformation rate density of log(sfrd) = -1.80 +0.13/-0.07(random) +/-0.03(systematic) + log(h_70) after applying a mean internal extinctioncorrection of 0.82 magnitudes. the gas cycling time of this sample is found tobe t_gas = 7.5 +1.3/-2.1 gyr, and the volume-averaged equivalent width of thesingg galaxies is ew(halpha) = 28.8 +7.2/-4.7 a (21.2 +4.2/-3.5 a withoutinternal dust correction). as with similar surveys, these results imply thatsfrd(z) decreases drastically from z ~ 1.5 to the present. a comparison of thedynamical masses of the singg galaxies evaluated at their optical limits withtheir stellar and hi masses shows significant evidence of downsizing: the mostmassive galaxies have a larger fraction of their mass locked up in starscompared with hi, while the opposite is true for less massive galaxies. we showthat the application of the kennicutt star formation law to a galaxy having themedian orbital time at the optical limit of this sample results in a starformation rate decay with cosmic time similar to that given by the sfrd(z)evolution. this implies that the sfrd(z) evolution is primarily due to thesecular evolution of galaxies, rather than interactions or mergers. this isconsistent with the morphologies predominantly seen in the singg sample.

astro-ph;0604444	the survey for ionization in neutral gas galaxies: i. description and  initial results	we introduce the survey for ionization in neutral gas galaxies (singg), acensus of star formation in hi-selected galaxies. the survey consists ofh-alpha and r-band imaging of a sample of 468 galaxies selected from the hiparkes all sky survey (hipass). the sample spans three decades in hi mass andis free of many of the biases that affect other star forming galaxy samples. wepresent the criteria for sample selection, list the entire sample, discuss ourobservational techniques, and describe the data reduction and calibrationmethods. this paper focuses on 93 singg targets whose observations have beenfully reduced and analyzed to date. the majority of these show a singleemission line galaxy (elg). we see multiple elgs in 13 fields, with up to fourelgs in a single field. all of the targets in this sample are detected inh-alpha indicating that dormant (non-star forming) galaxies with m(hi) &gt; ~3e7m_sun are very rare. a database of the measured global properties of the elgsis presented. the elg sample spans four orders of magnitude in luminosity(h-alpha and r-band), and h-alpha surface brightness, nearly three orders ofmagnitude in r surface brightness and nearly two orders of magnitude in h-alphaequivalent width (ew). the surface brightness distribution of our sample isbroader than that of the sloan digital sky survey spectroscopic sample, the(ew) distribution is broader than prism-selected samples, and the morphologiesfound include all common types of star forming galaxies (e.g. irregular,spiral, blue compact dwarf, starbursts, merging and colliding systems, and evenresidual star formation in s0 and sa spirals).

astro-ph;0605215	kinematics of interstellar gas in nearby uv-selected galaxies measured  with hst/stis spectroscopy	we measure doppler shifts of interstellar absorption lines in hst/stisspectra of individual star clusters in nearby uv-selected galaxies. values forsystemic velocities, which are needed to quantify outflow speeds, are takenfrom the literature, and verified with stellar lines. we detect outflowing gasin eight of 17 galaxies via low-ionization lines (e.g., cii, siii, alii), whichtrace cold and/or warm gas. the starbursts in our sample are intermediate inluminosity (and mass) to dwarf galaxies and luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs),and we confirm that their outflow speeds (ranging from -100 km/s to nearly -520km/s with an accuracy of ~80 km/s) are intermediate to those previouslymeasured in dwarf starbursts and lirgs. we do not detect the outflow inhigh-ionization lines (such as civ or siiv); higher quality data will be neededto empirically establish how velocities vary with the ionization state of theoutflow. we do verify that the low-ionization uv lines and optical nai doubletgive roughly consistent outflow velocities solidifying an important linkbetween studies of galactic winds at low and high redshift. to obtain highersignal-to-noise, we create a local average composite spectrum, and compare itto the high-z lyman break composite spectrum. surprisingly, the low-ionizationlines show similar outflow velocities in the two samples. we attribute this toa combination of weighting towards higher luminosities in the local composite,as well as both samples being on average brighter than the ``turnover''luminosity in the v-sfr relation.

astro-ph;0605438	penetrating the deep cover of compton thick active galactic nuclei	we analyze observations obtained with the chandra x-ray observatory of brightcompton thick active galactic nuclei (agns), those with column densities inexcess of 1.5 x 10^{24} cm^{-2} along the lines of sight. we therefore view thepowerful central engines only indirectly, even at x-ray energies. using highspatial resolution and considering only galaxies that do not containcircumnuclear starbursts, we reveal the variety of emission agns alone mayproduce. approximately 1% of the continuum's intrinsic flux is detected inreflection in each case. the only hard x-ray feature is the prominent fe kalpha fluorescence line, with equivalent width greater than 1 kev in allsources. the fe line luminosity provides the best x-ray indicator of the unseenintrinsic agn luminosity. in detail, the morphologies of the extended softx-ray emission and optical line emission are similar, and line emissiondominates the soft x-ray spectra. thus, we attribute the soft x-ray emission tomaterial that the central engines photoionize. because the resulting spectraare complex and do not reveal the agns directly, crude analysis techniques suchas hardness ratios would mis-classify these galaxies as hosts of intrinsicallyweak, unabsorbed agns and would fail to identify the luminous, absorbed nucleithat are present. we demonstrate that a three-band x-ray diagnostic cancorrectly classify compton thick agns, even when significant soft x-ray lineemission is present. the active nuclei produce most of the galaxies' totalobserved emission over a broad spectral range, and much of their light emergesat far-infrared wavelengths. stellar contamination of the infrared emission canbe severe, however, making long-wavelength data alone unreliable indicators ofthe buried agn luminosity.

astro-ph;0606355	the rest-frame optical colors of 99,000 sdss galaxies	we synthesize the rest-frame stroemgren colors using sdss spectra for 99,088galaxies selected from data release 1. this narrow-band ~200 aa photometricsystem (uz, vz, bz, yz), first designed for the determination of effectivetemperature, metallicity and gravity of stars, measures the continuum spectralslope of galaxies in the rest-frame 3200-5800 aa wavelength range. galaxiesform a remarkably narrow locus (~0.03 mag) in the resulting color-colordiagram. the bruzual &amp; charlot population synthesis models suggest that theposition of a galaxy along this locus is controlled by a degenerate combinationof metallicity and age of the dominant stellar population. galaxy distributionalong the locus is bimodal, with the local minimum corresponding to an ~1 gyrold single stellar population. the position perpendicular to the locus isindependent of metallicity and age, and reflects the galaxy's dust content, asimplied by both the models and the statistics of iras detections. a comparisonof this locus with the galaxy locus in the h_delta-d_n(4000) diagram, utilizedby kauffmann et al. (2003) to estimate stellar masses, reveals a tightcorrelation, although the two analyzed spectral ranges barely overlap. overall,the galaxy spectral energy distribution in the entire uv to near-ir range canbe described as a single-parameter family with an accuracy of 0.1 mag, orbetter. this nearly one-dimensional distribution of galaxies in themulti-dimensional space of measured parameters strongly supports the conclusionof yip et al. (2004), based on a principal component analysis, that sdss galaxyspectra can be described by a small number of eigenspectra. apparently, thecontributions of stellar populations that dominate the optical emission fromgalaxies are combined in a simple and well-defined way.

(...) this data set has been complemented with archival optical,near-infrared, and far-infrared fluxes and colors. we find that the integrated(fuv-k) color provides robust discrimination between elliptical andspiral/irregular galaxies and also among spiral galaxies of differentsub-types. elliptical galaxies with brighter k-band luminosities (i.e. moremassive) are redder in (nuv-k) color but bluer in (fuv-nuv) than less massiveellipticals. in the case of the spiral/irregular galaxies our analysis showsthe presence of a relatively tight correlation between the (fuv-nuv) color andthe total infrared-to-uv ratio. the correlation found between (fuv-nuv) colorand k-band luminosity (with lower luminosity objects being bluer than moreluminous ones) can be explained as due to an increase in the dust content withgalaxy luminosity.  the images in this atlas along with the profiles and integrated propertiesare publicly available through a dedicated web page athttp://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/galex_atlas/

astro-ph;0609738	the local universe as seen in far-infrared and in far-ultraviolet: a  global point of view on the local recent star formation	we select far-infrared (fir-60 microns) and far-ultraviolet (fuv-1530 a)samples of nearby galaxies in order to discuss the biases encountered bymonochromatic surveys (fir or fuv). very different volumes are sampled by eachselection and much care is taken to apply volume corrections to all theanalyses. the distributions of the bolometric luminosity of young stars arecompared for both samples: they are found to be consistent with each other forgalaxies of intermediate luminosities but some differences are found for high(&gt;5 10^{10} l_sun) luminosities. the shallowness of the iras survey prevents usfrom securing comparison at low luminosities (&lt;2 10^9 l_sun). the ratio of thetotal infrared (tir) luminosity to the fuv luminosity is found to increase withthe bolometric luminosity in a similar way for both samples up to 5 10^{10}l_sun. brighter galaxies are found to have a different behavior according totheir selection: the l_tir/l_fuv ratio of the fuv-selected galaxies brighterthan 5 10^{10} l_sun reaches a plateau whereas l_tir/l_fuv continues toincrease with the luminosity of bright galaxies selected in fir. thevolume-averaged specific star formation rate (sfr per unit galaxy stellar mass,ssfr) is found to decrease toward massive galaxies within each selection. thessfr is found to be larger than that measured for optical and nir-selectedsample over the whole mass range for the fir selection, and for masses largerthan 10^{10} m_sun for the fuv selection. luminous and massive galaxiesselected in fir appear as active as galaxies with similar characteristicsdetected at z ~ 0.7.

astro-ph;0611197	on the prevalence of radio-loud agn in brightest cluster galaxies:  implications for agn heating of cooling flows	(abridged) the prevalence of radio-loud agn activity in present-day massivehalos is determined using a sample of 625 nearby groups and clusters from thesdss. brightest group and cluster galaxies (bcgs) are more likely to host aradio-loud agn than other galaxies of the same stellar mass (by less than afactor of two at a stellar mass of 5e11 m_sun, but over an order of magnitudebelow 1e11 m_sun). the distribution of radio luminosities for bcgs does notdepend on stellar mass, however, and is similar to that of field galaxies ofthe same mass. neither the radio-loud fraction nor the radio luminositydistribution of bcgs depends strongly on the cluster velocity dispersion. theradio-agn fraction is also studied as a function of clustercentric distance:only within 0.2 r_200 do cluster galaxies exhibit an enhanced likelihood ofradio-loud agn activity, approaching that of the bcgs. the radio-loud agnproperties of both bcgs and non-bcgs can naturally be explained if thisactivity is fuelled by cooling from hot gas surrounding the galaxy. usingobservational estimates of the mechanical output of the radio jets, thetime-averaged energy output associated with recurrent radio source activity isestimated for all group/cluster galaxies. within the cooling radius of thecluster, the radio-mode heating from the bcg dominates over that of all othergalaxies combined. the scaling between total radio-agn energy output andcluster velocity dispersion is considerably shallower than the sigma^4 scalingof the radiative cooling rate. thus, unless either the mechanical-to-radioluminosity ratio or the efficiency of converting agn mechanical energy intoheating increases by 2-3 orders of magnitude between groups and rich clusters,radio-mode heating will not balance cooling in systems of all masses.

astro-ph;0611859	iron line and diffuse hard x-ray emission from the starburst galaxy m82	we examine the properties of the diffuse hard x-ray emission in the classicstarburst galaxy m82. we use new chandra acis-s observations in combinationwith reprocessed archival chandra acis-i and xmm-newton observations. we finde~6.7 kev fe he-alpha emission is present in the central |r| &lt; 200 pc, |z| &lt;100 pc of m82 in all datasets at high statistical significance, in addition toa possibly non-thermal x-ray continuum and marginally significant e=6.4 kev fek-alpha line emission. no statistically significant fe emission is found in thesummed x-ray spectra of the point-like x-ray sources or the ulx in the twoepochs of chandra observation. the total nuclear region iron line fluxes in the2004 april 21 xmm-newton observation are consistent with those of thechandra-derived diffuse component, but in the 2001 may 6 xmm-newton observationthey are significantly higher and also both e=6.4 and e=6.9 kev iron lines aredetected. we attribute the excess iron line emission to the ultra-luminousx-ray source in its high state. in general the iron k-shell luminosity of m82is dominated by the diffuse component. the total x-ray luminosity of thediffuse hard x-ray emission (corrected for emission by unresolved lowluminosity compact objects) is l_x ~ 4.4 x 10^39 erg/s in the e=2-8 kev energyband, and the 6.7 kev iron line luminosity is l_x ~ (1.1 -- 1.7) x 10^38 erg/s.the 6.7 kev iron line luminosity is consistent with that expected from thepreviously unobserved metal-enriched merged supernova ejecta that is thought todrive the larger-scale galactic superwind. the iron line luminosity implies athermal pressure within the starburst region of p/k ~ 2 x 10^7 k/cm^3, which isconsistent with independent observational estimates of the starburst regionpressure [abstract abridged].

astro-ph;9811099	the evolution of dust opacity in galaxies	(abridged) we investigate the evolution of the opacity of galaxies as afunction of redshift, using simple assumptions about the metal and dustenrichment of the gas and the distribution of dust in galaxies. we use aniterative procedure to reconstruct the intrinsic star formation rate (sfr)density of galaxies with redshift, by applying dust obscuration corrections tothe observed uv emission. the iterative procedure converges to multiplesolutions for the intrinsic sfr density, divided into two basic classes. thefirst class of solutions predicts relatively large uv attenuation at highredshift, with a(1500 a)=1.9 mag at z~3, and smaller attenuations at z&lt;1, witha(2800 a)=1.25 mag. the sfr density of this set of solutions is constant forz&gt;~1.2 and declines for z&lt;1.2; it resembles in shape the ``monolithiccollapse'' scenario for star formation. the second class of solutions predictsrelatively low uv attenuations at high redshift, with a(1500 a)=0.75 mag atz~3, and larger attenuations at z&lt;1, with a(2800 a)=1.50 mag. the sfr densityin this case has a peak at z~1.2. the advantages and shortcomings of bothclasses are analyzed in the light of available observational constraints,including the opacity of galaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;1 and the intensity and spectralenergy distribution of the cosmic infrared background from the cobe dirbe andfiras data. we conclude that both classes of models are acceptable within thecurrent uncertainties, but the ``monolithic collapse'' class matches theavailable observations better than the other one. we also investigate thedependence of our solutions on the different model assumptions.
