0903.2139	high-precision photometry by telescope defocussing. i. the transiting  planetary system wasp-5	we present high-precision photometry of two transit events of the extrasolarplanetary system wasp-5, obtained with the danish 1.54m telescope at eso lasilla. in order to minimise both random and flat-fielding errors, we defocussedthe telescope so its point spread function approximated an annulus of diameter40 pixels (16 arcsec). data reduction was undertaken using standard aperturephotometry plus an algorithm for optimally combining the ensemble of comparisonstars. the resulting light curves have point-to-point scatters of 0.50 mmag forthe first transit and 0.59 mmag for the second. we construct detailed signal tonoise calculations for defocussed photometry, and apply them to ourobservations. we model the light curves with the jktebop code and combine theresults with tabulated predictions from theoretical stellar evolutionary modelsto derive the physical properties of the wasp-5 system. we find that the planethas a mass of m_b = 1.637 +/- 0.075 +/- 0.033 mjup, a radius of r_b = 1.171 +/-0.056 +/- 0.012 rjup, a large surface gravity of g_b = 29.6 +/- 2.8 m/s2 and adensity of rho_b = 1.02 +/- 0.14 +/- 0.01 rhojup (statistical and systematicuncertainties). the planet's high equilibrium temperature of t_eq = 1732 +/- 80k makes it a good candidate for detecting secondary eclipses.

0907.3356	high-precision photometry by telescope defocussing. ii. the transiting  planetary system wasp-4	we present and analyse light curves of four transits of the southernhemisphere extrasolar planetary system wasp-4, obtained with a telescopedefocussed so the radius of each point spread function was 17 arcsec (44pixels). this approach minimises both random and systematic errors, allowing usto achieve scatters of between 0.60 and 0.88 mmag per observation over completetransit events. the light curves are augmented by published observations andanalysed using the jktebop code. the results of this process are combined withtheoretical stellar model predictions to derive the physical properties of thewasp-4 system. we find that the mass and radius of the planet are m_b = 1.289{+0.090 -0.090} {+0.039 -0.000} mjup and r_b = 1.371 {+0.032 -0.035} {+0.021-0.000} rjup, respectively (statistical and systematic uncertainties). thesequantities give a surface gravity and density of g_b = 17.03 +0.97 -0.54 m/s2and rho_b = 0.500 {+0.032 -0.021} {+0.000 -0.008} rhojup, and fit the trendsfor short-period extrasolar planets to have relatively high masses and surfacegravities. wasp-4 is now one of the best-quantified transiting extrasolarplanetary systems, and significant further progress requires improvements toour understanding of the physical properties of low-mass stars.

0910.4875	physical properties of the 0.94-day period transiting planetary system  wasp-18	we present high-precision photometry of five consecutive transits of wasp-18,an extrasolar planetary system with one of the shortest orbital periods known.through the use of telescope defocussing we achieve a photometric precision of0.47 to 0.83 mmag per observation over complete transit events. the data areanalysed using the jktebop code and three different sets of stellarevolutionary models. we find the mass and radius of the planet to be m_b =10.43 +/- 0.30 +/- 0.24 mjup r_b = 1.165 +/- 0.055 +/- 0.014 rjup (statisticaland systematic errors) respectively. the systematic errors in the orbitalseparation and the stellar and planetary masses, arising from the use oftheoretical predictions, are of a similar size to the statistical errors andset a limit on our understanding of the wasp-18 system. we point out that sevenof the nine known massive transiting planets (m_b &gt; 3 mjup) have eccentricorbits, whereas significant orbital eccentricity has been detected for onlyfour of the 46 less massive planets. this may indicate that there are twodifferent populations of transiting planets, but could also be explained byobservational biases. further radial velocity observations of low-mass planetswill make it possible to choose between these two scenarios.

1005.0966	ogle 2008--blg--290: an accurate measurement of the limb darkening of a  galactic bulge k giant spatially resolved by microlensing	gravitational microlensing is not only a successful tool for discoveringdistant exoplanets, but it also enables characterization of the lens and sourcestars involved in the lensing event. in high magnification events, the lenscaustic may cross over the source disk, which allows a determination of theangular size of the source and additionally a measurement of its limbdarkening. when such extended-source effects appear close to maximummagnification, the resulting light curve differs from the characteristicpaczynski point-source curve. the exact shape of the light curve close to thepeak depends on the limb darkening of the source. dense photometric coveragepermits measurement of the respective limb-darkening coefficients. in the caseof microlensing event ogle 2008-blg-290, the k giant source star reached a peakmagnification of about 100. thirteen different telescopes have covered thisevent in eight different photometric bands. subsequent light-curve analysisyielded measurements of linear limb-darkening coefficients of the source in sixphotometric bands. the best-measured coefficients lead to an estimate of thesource effective temperature of about 4700 +100-200 k. however, the photometricestimate from colour-magnitude diagrams favours a cooler temperature of 4200+-100 k. as the limb-darkening measurements, at least in the ctio/smarts2 v andi bands, are among the most accurate obtained, the above disagreement needs tobe understood. a solution is proposed, which may apply to previous events wheresuch a discrepancy also appeared.

1010.6195	the xmm-lss survey: optical assessment and properties of different x-ray  selected cluster classes	xmm and chandra opened a new area for the study of clusters of galaxies. notonly for cluster physics but also, for the detection of faint and distantclusters that were inaccessible with previous missions. this article presents66 spectroscopically confirmed clusters (0.05&lt;z&lt;1.5) within an area of 6 deg2enclosed in the xmm-lss survey. almost two thirds have been confirmed withdedicated spectroscopy only and 10% have been confirmed with dedicatedspectroscopy supplemented by literature redshifts. sub-samples, or classes, ofextended-sources are defined in a two-dimensional x-ray parameter spaceallowing for various degrees of completeness and contamination. we describe theprocedure developed to assess the reality of these cluster candidates using thecfhtls photometric data and spectroscopic information from our own follow-upcampaigns. most of these objects are low mass clusters, hence constituting astill poorly studied population. in a second step, we quantify correlationsbetween the optical properties such as richness or velocity dispersion and thecluster x-ray luminosities. we examine the relation of the clusters to thecosmic web. finally, we review peculiar structures in the surveyed area likevery distant clusters and fossil groups.

1111.5982	angular correlation functions of x-ray point-like sources in the full  exposure xmm-lss field	our aim is to study the large-scale structure of different types of agn usingthe medium-deep xmm-lss survey. we measure the two-point angular correlationfunction of ~ 5700 and 2500 x-ray point-like sources over the ~ 11 sq. deg.xmm-lss field in the soft (0.5-2 kev) and hard (2-10 kev) bands. for theconversion from the angular to the spatial correlation function we used thelimber integral equation and the luminosity-dependent density evolution modelof the agn x-ray luminosity function. we have found significant angularcorrelations with the power-law parameters gamma = 1.81 +/- 0.02, theta_0 =1.3" +/- 0.2" for the soft, and gamma = 2.00 +/- 0.04, theta_0 = 7.3" +/- 1.0"for the hard bands. the amplitude of the correlation function w(theta) ishigher in the hard than in the soft band for f_x &lt; 10^-14 erg s^-1 cm^-2 andlower above this flux limit. we confirm that the clustering strength theta_0grows with the flux limit of the sample, a trend which is also present in theamplitude of the spatial correlation function, but only for the soft band. inthe hard band, it remains almost constant with r_0 = 10h^-1$ mpc, irrespectiveof the flux limit. our analysis of agn subsamples with different hardnessratios shows that the sources with a hard-spectrum are more clustered thansoft-spectrum ones. this result may be a hint that the two main types of agnpopulate different environments. finally, we find that our clustering resultscorrespond to an x-ray selected agn bias factor of ~ 2.5 for the soft-bandsources (at a median z = 1.1) and ~ 3.3 for the hard-band sources (at a medianz = 1), which translates into a host dark matter halo mass of ~ 10^13 h^-1 m_oand ~ 10^13.7 h^-1 m_o for the soft and hard bands, respectively.

1204.2869	characterizing low-mass binaries from observation of long time-scale  caustic-crossing gravitational microlensing events	despite astrophysical importance of binary star systems, detections arelimited to those located in small ranges of separations, distances, and massesand thus it is necessary to use a variety of observational techniques for acomplete view of stellar multiplicity across a broad range of physicalparameters. in this paper, we report the detections and measurements of 2binaries discovered from observations of microlensing events moa-2011-blg-090and ogle-2011-blg-0417. determinations of the binary masses are possible bysimultaneously measuring the einstein radius and the lens parallax. themeasured masses of the binary components are 0.43 $m_{\odot}$ and 0.39$m_{\odot}$ for moa-2011-blg-090 and 0.57 $m_{\odot}$ and 0.17 $m_{\odot}$ forogle-2011-blg-0417 and thus both lens components of moa-2011-blg-090 and onecomponent of ogle-2011-blg-0417 are m dwarfs, demonstrating the usefulness ofmicrolensing in detecting binaries composed of low-mass components. frommodeling of the light curves considering full keplerian motion of the lens, wealso measure the orbital parameters of the binaries. the blended light ofogle-2011-blg-0417 comes very likely from the lens itself, making it possibleto check the microlensing orbital solution by follow-up radial-velocityobservation. for both events, the caustic-crossing parts of the light curves,which are critical for determining the physical lens parameters, were resolvedby high-cadence survey observations and thus it is expected that the number ofmicrolensing binaries with measured physical parameters will increase in thefuture.

1204.4789	a new type of ambiguity in the planet and binary interpretations of  central perturbations of high-magnification gravitational microlensing events	high-magnification microlensing events provide an important channel to detectplanets. perturbations near the peak of a high-magnification event can beproduced either by a planet or a binary companion. it is known that centralperturbations induced by both types of companions can be generallydistinguished due to the basically different magnification pattern aroundcaustics. in this paper, we present a case of central perturbations for whichit is difficult to distinguish the planetary and binary interpretations. thepeak of a lensing light curve affected by this perturbation appears to be bluntand flat. for a planetary case, this perturbation occurs when the sourcetrajectory passes the negative perturbation region behind the back end of anarrowhead-shaped central caustic. for a binary case, a similar perturbationoccurs for a source trajectory passing through the negative perturbation regionbetween two cusps of an astroid-shaped caustic. we demonstrate the degeneracyfor 2 high-magnification events of ogle-2011-blg-0526 andogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336. for ogle-2011-blg-0526, the $\chi^2$difference between the planetary and binary model is $\sim$ 3, implying thatthe degeneracy is very severe. for ogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336, thestellar binary model is formally excluded with $\delta \chi^2 \sim$ 105 and theplanetary model is preferred. however, it is difficult to claim a planetdiscovery because systematic residuals of data from the planetary model arelarger than the difference between the planetary and binary models. consideringthat 2 events observed during a single season suffer from such a degeneracy, itis expected that central perturbations experiencing this type of degeneracy iscommon.

1205.6323	moa-2010-blg-477lb: constraining the mass of a microlensing planet from  microlensing parallax, orbital motion and detection of blended light	microlensing detections of cool planets are important for the construction ofan unbiased sample to estimate the frequency of planets beyond the snow line,which is where giant planets are thought to form according to the coreaccretion theory of planet formation. in this paper, we report the discovery ofa giant planet detected from the analysis of the light curve of ahigh-magnification microlensing event moa-2010-blg-477. the measuredplanet-star mass ratio is $q=(2.181\pm0.004)\times 10^{-3}$ and the projectedseparation is $s=1.1228\pm0.0006$ in units of the einstein radius. the angulareinstein radius is unusually large $\theta_{\rm e}=1.38\pm 0.11$ mas. combiningthis measurement with constraints on the "microlens parallax" and the lensflux, we can only limit the host mass to the range $0.13&lt;m/m_\odot&lt;1.0$. inthis particular case, the strong degeneracy between microlensing parallax andplanet orbital motion prevents us from measuring more accurate host and planetmasses. however, we find that adding bayesian priors from two effects (galacticmodel and keplerian orbit) each independently favors the upper end of this massrange, yielding star and planet masses of $m_*=0.67^{+0.33}_{-0.13}\ m_\odot$and $m_p=1.5^{+0.8}_{-0.3}\ m_{\rm jup}$ at a distance of $d=2.3\pm0.6$ kpc,and with a semi-major axis of $a=2^{+3}_{-1}$ au. finally, we show that thelens mass can be determined from future high-resolution near-ir adaptive opticsobservations independently from two effects, photometric and astrometric.

1211.3782	moa-2010-blg-073l: an m-dwarf with a substellar companion at the  planet/brown dwarf boundary	we present an analysis of the anomalous microlensing event, moa-2010-blg-073,announced by the microlensing observations in astrophysics survey on2010-03-18.  this event was remarkable because the source was previously known to bephotometrically variable. analyzing the pre-event source lightcurve, wedemonstrate that it is an irregular variable over time scales &gt;200d. itsdereddened color, $(v-i)_{s,0}$, is 1.221$\pm$0.051mag and from our lens modelwe derive a source radius of 14.7$\pm$1.3 $r_{\odot}$, suggesting that it is ared giant star.  we initially explored a number of purely microlensing models for the eventbut found a residual gradient in the data taken prior to and after the event.this is likely to be due to the variability of the source rather than part ofthe lensing event, so we incorporated a slope parameter in our model in orderto derive the true parameters of the lensing system.  we find that the lensing system has a mass ratio of q=0.0654$\pm$0.0006. theeinstein crossing time of the event, $t_{\rm{e}}=44.3$\pm$0.1d, wassufficiently long that the lightcurve exhibited parallax effects. in addition,the source trajectory relative to the large caustic structure allowed theorbital motion of the lens system to be detected. combining the parallax withthe einstein radius, we were able to derive the distance to the lens,$d_l$=2.8$\pm$0.4kpc, and the masses of the lensing objects. the primary of thelens is an m-dwarf with $m_{l,p}$=0.16$\pm0.03m_{\odot}$ while the companionhas $m_{l,s}$=11.0$\pm2.0m_{\rm{j}}$ putting it in the boundary zone betweenplanets and brown dwarfs.

1303.1184	a giant planet beyond the snow line in microlensing event  ogle-2011-blg-0251	we present the analysis of the gravitational microlensing eventogle-2011-blg-0251. this anomalous event was observed by several survey andfollow-up collaborations conducting microlensing observations towards thegalactic bulge. based on detailed modelling of the observed light curve, wefind that the lens is composed of two masses with a mass ratio q=1.9 x 10^-3.thanks to our detection of higher-order effects on the light curve due to theearth's orbital motion and the finite size of source, we are able to measurethe mass and distance to the lens unambiguously. we find that the lens is madeup of a planet of mass 0.53 +- 0.21,m_jup orbiting an m dwarf host star with amass of 0.26 +- 0.11 m_sun. the planetary system is located at a distance of2.57 +- 0.61 kpc towards the galactic centre. the projected separation of theplanet from its host star is d=1.408 +- 0.019, in units of the einstein radius,which corresponds to 2.72 +- 0.75 au in physical units. we also identified acompetitive model with similar planet and host star masses, but with a smallerorbital radius of 1.50 +- 0.50 au. the planet is therefore located beyond thesnow line of its host star, which we estimate to be around 1-1.5 au.

1306.3206	a detailed census of variable stars in the globular cluster ngc 6333  (m9) from ccd differential photometry	we report ccd $v$ and $i$ time-series photometry of the globular cluster ngc6333 (m9). the technique of difference image analysis has been used, whichenables photometric precision better than 0.05 mag for stars brighter than $v\sim 19.0$ mag, even in the crowded central regions of the cluster. the highphotometric precision has resulted in the discovery of two new rrc stars, threeeclipsing binaries, seven long-term variables and one field rrab star behindthe cluster. a detailed identification chart and equatorial coordinates aregiven for all the variable stars in the field of our images of the cluster. ourdata together with literature $v$-data obtained in 1994 and 1995 allowed us torefine considerably the periods for all rr lyrae stars. the nature of the newvariables is discussed. we argue that variable v12 is a cluster member and ananomalous cepheid. secular period variations, double mode pulsations and/or theblazhko-like modulations in some rrc variables are addressed. through the lightcurve fourier decomposition of 12 rr lyrae stars we have calculated a meanmetallicity of [fe/h]$_{\rm zw}$=$-1.70 \pm 0.01{\rm(statistical)} \pm0.14{\rm(systematic)}$ or [fe/h]$_{uves}=-1.67 \pm 0.01{\rm(statistical)} \pm0.19{\rm(systematic)}$.absolute magnitudes, radii and masses are also estimatedfor the rr lyrae stars.  a detailed search for sx phe stars in the blue straggler region was conductedbut none were discovered. if sx phe exist in the cluster then their amplitudesmust be smaller than the detection limit of our photometry.  the cmd has been corrected for heavy differential reddening using thedetailed extinction map of the cluster of alonso-garc\'ia et al. (2012). thishas allowed us to set the mean cluster distance from two independent estimates;from the rrab and rrc absolute magnitudes, we find $8.04\pm 0.19$ kpc and$7.88\pm0.30$ kpc respectively.

1306.6384	physical properties, transmission and emission spectra of the wasp-19  planetary system from multi-colour photometry	we present new ground-based, multi-colour, broad-band photometricmeasurements of the physical parameters, transmission and emission spectra ofthe transiting extrasolar planet wasp-19b. the measurements are based onobservations of 8 transits and four occultations using the 1.5m danishtelescope, 14 transits at the pest observatory, and 1 transit observedsimultaneously through four optical and three near-infrared filters, using thegrond instrument on the eso 2.2m telescope. we use these new data to measurerefined physical parameters for the system. we find the planet to be morebloated and the system to be twice as old as initially thought. we also usedpublished and archived datasets to study the transit timings, which do notdepart from a linear ephemeris. we detected an anomaly in the grond transitlight curve which is compatible with a spot on the photosphere of the parentstar. the starspot position, size, spot contrast and temperature wereestablished. using our new and published measurements, we assembled theplanet's transmission spectrum over the 370-2350 nm wavelength range and itsemission spectrum over the 750-8000 nm range. by comparing these data totheoretical models we investigated the theoretically-predicted variation of theapparent radius of wasp-19b as a function of wavelength and studied thecomposition and thermal structure of its atmosphere. we conclude that: there isno evidence for strong optical absorbers at low pressure, supporting the commonidea that the planet's atmosphere lacks a dayside inversion; the temperature ofthe planet is not homogenized, because the high warming of its dayside causesthe planet to be more efficient in re-radiating than redistributing energy tothe night side; the planet seems to be outside of any current classificationscheme.

1402.4136	x-ray agn in the xmm-lss galaxy clusters: no evidence of agn suppression	we present a study of the overdensity of x-ray selected agn in 33 galaxyclusters in the xmm-lss field, up to redhift z=1.05. previous studies haveshown that the presence of x-ray selected agn in rich galaxy clusters issuppressed. in the current study we investigate the occurrence of x-rayselected agn in low and moderate x-ray luminosity galaxy clusters. due to thewide contiguous xmm-lss survey area we are able to extend the study to thecluster outskirts. we therefore determine the projected overdensity of x-raypoint-like sources out to 6r_{500} radius. to provide robust statisticalresults we also use a stacking analysis of the cluster projected overdensities.we investigate whether the observed x-ray overdensities are to be expected byestimating also the corresponding optical galaxy overdensities. we find apositive x-ray projected overdensity at the first radial bin, which is howeverof the same amplitude as that of optical galaxies. therefore, no suppression ofx-ray agn activity with respect to the field is found, implying that themechanisms responsible for the suppression are not so effective in lowerdensity environments. after a drop to roughly the background level between 2and 3r_{500}, the x-ray overdensity exhibits a rise at larger radii,significantly larger than the corresponding optical overdensity. finally, usingredshift information of all optical counterparts, we derive the spatialoverdensity profile of the clusters. we find that the agreement between x-rayand optical overdensities in the first radial bin is also suggested in the3-dimensional analysis. however, we argue that the x-ray overdensity "bump" atlarger radial distance is probably a result of flux boosting by gravitationallensing of background qsos. for high redshift clusters an enhancement of x-rayagn activity in their outskirts is still possible.

1410.8252	ogle-2011-blg-0265lb: a jovian microlensing planet orbiting an m dwarf	we report the discovery of a jupiter-mass planet orbiting an m-dwarf starthat gave rise to the microlensing event ogle-2011-blg-0265. such a system isvery rare among known planetary systems and thus the discovery is important fortheoretical studies of planetary formation and evolution. high-cadence temporalcoverage of the planetary signal combined with extended observations throughoutthe event allows us to accurately model the observed light curve. the finalmicrolensing solution remains, however, degenerate yielding two possibleconfigurations of the planet and the host star. in the case of the preferredsolution, the mass of the planet is $m_{\rm p} = 0.9\pm 0.3\ m_{\rm j}$, andthe planet is orbiting a star with a mass $m = 0.22\pm 0.06\ m_\odot$. thesecond possible configuration (2$\sigma$ away) consists of a planet with$m_{\rm p}=0.6\pm 0.3\ m_{\rm j}$ and host star with $m=0.14\pm 0.06\ m_\odot$.the system is located in the galactic disk 3 -- 4 kpc towards the galacticbulge. in both cases, with an orbit size of 1.5 -- 2.0 au, the planet is a"cold jupiter" -- located well beyond the "snow line" of the host star.currently available data make the secure selection of the correct solutiondifficult, but there are prospects for lifting the degeneracy with additionalfollow-up observations in the future, when the lens and source star separate.

astro-ph;0601167	the butcher--oemler effect at z~0.35: a change in perspective	the present paper focuses on the much debated butcher-oemler effect: theincrease with redshift of the fraction of blue galaxies in clusters.considering a representative cluster sample made of seven group/clusters atz~0.35, we have measured the blue fraction from the cluster core to the clusteroutskirts and the field mainly using wide field ctio images. this samplerepresents a random selection of a volume complete x-ray selected clustersample, selected so that there is no physical connection with the studiedquantity (blue fraction), to minimize observational biases. in order tostatistically assess the significance of the butcher-oemler effect, weintroduce the tools of bayesian inference. furthermore, we modified the bluefraction definition in order to take into account the reduced age of theuniverse at higher redshifts, because we should no longer attempt to reject anunphysical universe in which the age of the universe does depend on redshift,whereas the age of its content does not. we measured the blue fraction from thecluster center to the field and we find that the cluster affects the propertiesof the galaxies up to two virial radii at z~0.35. data suggest that during thelast 3 gyrs no evolution of the blue fraction, from the cluster core to thefield value, is seen beyond the one needed to account for the varying age withredshift of the universe and of its content. the agreement of the radialprofiles of the blue fraction at z=0 and z~0.35 implies that the pattern infalldid not change over the last 3 gyr, or, at least, its variation has noobservational effect on the studied quantity.

astro-ph;9810218	redshift estimate of a gravitational lens from the observed reddening of  a multiply imaged quasar	light rays from a multiply imaged quasar usually sample different pathlengths across the deflector. extinction in the lensing galaxy may thus lead toa differential obscuration and reddening between the observed macro-lensed qsoimages. these effects naturally depend on the precise shape of the extinctionlaw and on the redshift of the lens. by means of numerical monte-carlosimulations, using a least-squares fitting method and assuming an extinctionlaw similar to that observed in the galaxy, we show how accurate photometricobservations of multiply imaged quasars obtained in several spectral bandscould lead to the estimate of the lens redshift, irrespective of the visibilityof the deflector. observational requirements necessary to apply this method toreal cases are thoroughly discussed. if extinction laws turn out to be toodifferent from galaxy to galaxy, we find out that more promising observationsshould consist in getting high signal-to-noise low resolution spectra of atleast three distinct images of a lensed quasar, over a spectral range as wideas possible, from which it should be straightforward to extract the preciseshape of the redshifted extinction law. very high signal-to-noise, low spectralresolution, vlt observations of h1413+117 and mg 0414+0534 should enable one toderive such a redshifted extinction law.
