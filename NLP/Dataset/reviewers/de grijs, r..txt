0812.4888	near-ir spectroscopic ages of massive star clusters in m82	like other starburst galaxies, m82 hosts compact, massive young star clustersthat are interesting both in their own right and as benchmarks for populationsynthesis models. can spectral synthesis models at resolutions around 1000adequately reproduce the near-ir spectral features and the energy distributionof these clusters between 0.8 and 2.4 microns? how do the derived clusterproperties compare with previous results from optical studies?  we analyse the spectra of 5 massive clusters in m82, using data acquired withthe spectrograph spex on the infrared telescope facility (nasa/irtf) and a newpopulation synthesis tool with a highly improved near-ir extension, based on arecent collection of empirical and theoretical spectra of red supergiant stars.we obtain excellent fits across the near-ir with models at quasi-solarmetallicity and a solar neighbourhood extinction law. spectroscopy breaks astrong degeneracy between age and extinction in the near-ir colours in the redsupergiant-dominated phase of evolution. the estimated near-ir ages clusterbetween 9 and 30 myr, i.e. the ages at which the molecular bands due toluminous red supergiants are strongest in the current models. they do notalways agree with optical spectroscopic ages. adding optical data sometimesleads to the rejection of the solar neighbourhood extinction law. this is notsurprising considering small-scale structure around the clusters, but it has nosignificant effect on the near-ir based spectroscopic ages.

0706.2723	mass segregation in very young open clusters -- a case study of ngc 2244  and ngc 6530	we derive the proper motions, membership probabilities, and velocitydispersions of stars in the regions of the young (about 2-4 myr-old) openclusters ngc 2244 (the central cluster in the monoceros r2 association) and ngc6530 (the dominant cluster in the sgr ob1 association) from photographic platematerial obtained at shanghai astronomical observatory, with time baselines of34 and 87 years, respectively. both clusters show clear evidence of masssegregation, but they do not exhibit any significant velocity-mass (or,equivalently, a velocity-luminosity) dependence. this provides strong supportfor the suggestion that the observed mass segregation is -- at least partially-- due to the way in which star formation has proceeded in these complexstar-forming regions (``primordial'' mass segregation). based on argumentsrelated to the clusters' published initial mass functions, in conjunction withour new measurements of their internal velocity dispersions (35 and 8 km/s forngc 2244 and ngc 6530, respectively), we provide strong arguments in favor ofthe dissolution of ngc 2244 on very short time-scales, while we speculate thatngc 6530 may be more stable against the effects of internal two-bodyrelaxation. however, this latter object may well be destroyed by the strongtidal field prevalent at its location in the galactic plane in the direction ofthe galactic center.

0903.4787	the initial mass function of the rich young cluster ngc 1818 in the  large magellanic cloud	we use deep hubble space telescope photometry of the rich, young (~20-45myr-old) star cluster ngc 1818 in the large magellanic cloud to derive itsstellar mass function (mf) down to ~0.15 msun. this represents the deepestrobust mf thus far obtained for a stellar system in an extragalactic,low-metallicity ([fe/h]~-0.4 dex) environment. combining our results with thepublished mf for masses above 1.0 msun, we obtain a complete present-day mf.this is a good representation of the cluster's initial mf (imf), particularlyat low masses, because our observations are centred on the cluster's uncrowdedhalf-mass radius. therefore, stellar and dynamical evolution of the clusterwill not have affected the low-mass stars significantly. the ngc 1818 imf iswell described by both a lognormal and a broken power-law distribution withslopes of gamma=0.46+/-0.10 and gamma~-1.35 (salpeter-like) for masses in therange from 0.15 to 0.8 msun and greater than 0.8 msun, respectively. within theuncertainties, the ngc 1818 imf is fully consistent with both the kroupasolar-neighbourhood and the chabrier lognormal mass distributions.

0708.3311	hst/stis spectroscopy of the environment in the starburst core of m82	[abridged] we present high-resolution optical hst/stis observations made withtwo slits crossing four of the brightest starburst clumps in the vicinity ofthe nucleus of m82. these provide h_alpha kinematics, extinction, electrondensity and emission measures. from the radial velocity curves we confirm thepresence of a stellar bar, and find that the super star cluster m82-a1 has aposition and radial velocity consistent with it being at the end of one of theunique x2 bar orbits formed by an inner lindblad resonance. we derive a newmodel for the orientation of the bar and disc with respect to the mainstarburst clumps, and propose that clump a has formed within the bar region asa result of gas interactions between the bar orbits, whereas region c lies atthe edge of the bar and regions d and e are located further out from thenucleus but heavily obscured. we derive extremely high interstellar densities,corresponding to ism pressures of p/k ~ 0.5-1.0 x 10^7 cm^-3 k, and discuss theimplications of the measured gas properties surrounding the nuclear starclusters on the production and evolution of the galactic wind. despite varyingpressures, the ionization parameter is uniform down to parsec-scales, and wediscuss why this might be so. where the s/n of our spectra are high enough, weidentify multiple emission-line components. through detailed gaussianline-fitting, we identify a ubiquitous broad (200-300 km/s) underlyingcomponent to the bright h_alpha line, and discuss the physical mechanism(s)that could be responsible for such widths. we conclude that the evaporationand/or ablation of material from interstellar gas clouds caused by the impactof the high-energy photons and fast-flowing cluster winds produces a highlyturbulent layer on the surface of the clouds from which the emission arises.

1012.5193	the vmc survey - i. strategy and first data	the new visual and infrared telescope for astronomy (vista) has startedoperations. over its first five years it will be collecting data for six publicsurveys, one of these is the near-infrared yjksvista survey of the magellanicclouds system (vmc). this survey comprises the lmc, the smc, the bridgeconnecting the two galaxies and two fields in the stream. this paper providesan overview of the vmc survey strategy and presents first science results. themain goals of the vmc survey are the determination of the spatially resolvedsfh and 3d structure of the magellanic system. therefore, the vmc survey isdesigned to reach stars as faint as the oldest main sequence turn-off point andto constrain the mean magnitude of pulsating variable stars such as rr lyraestars and cepheids. this paper focuses on observations of vmc fields in the lmcobtained between november 2009 and march 2010. these observations correspond toa 7% completeness of the lmc fields. the vmc observations consist ofmulti-epoch measurements organised following a specific structure. the datawere reduced using the vista data flow system pipeline whose source catalogueswere produced and made available via the vista science archive. the analysis ofthe data shows that the sensitivity in each wave band agrees with expectations.uncertainties and completeness of the data are also derived. the first scienceresults, aimed at assessing the science quality of the vmc data, include anoverview of the distribution of stars in colour-magnitude and colour-colourdiagrams, the detection of planetary nebulae and of stellar clusters, and theks band light-curve of variable stars. the vmc survey represents a tremendousimprovement, in spatial resolution and sensitivity, on previous panoramicobservations of the magellanic system in the near-infrared and complementsnicely the deep observations at other wavelengths.

1110.5852	the vmc survey iv. the lmc star formation history and disk geometry from  four vmc tiles	we derive the star formation history for several regions of the lmc, usingdeep near-infrared data from the vista near-infrared yjks survey of themagellanic system (vmc). the regions include three almost-complete 1.4 sqdegtiles located 3.5 deg away from the lmc centre in distinct directions. to thisdataset, we add two 0.036 sqdeg subregions inside the 30 doradus tile. the sfhis derived from the simultaneous reconstruction of two different cmds, usingthe minimization code starfish. the distance modulus (m-m)_0 and extinction avis varied within intervals 0.2 and 0.5 mag wide, respectively, within which weidentify the best-fitting star formation rate sfr(t), age-metallicity relation(amr), (m-m)_0 and av. our results demonstrate that vmc data, due to thecombination of depth and little sensitivity to differential reddening, allowthe derivation of the space-resolved sfh of the lmc with unprecedented qualitycompared to previous wide-area surveys. in particular, the data clearly revealthe presence of peaks in the sfr(t) at ages log(t/yr)=9.3 and 9.7, which appearin most of the subregions. the most recent sfr is found to vary greatly fromsubregion to subregion, with the general trend of being more intense in theinnermost lmc, except for the tile next to the n11 complex. in the bar region,the sfr seems remarkably constant over the time interval from 8.4 to 9.7. theamrs, instead, turn out to be remarkably similar across the lmc. the fieldsstudied so far are fit extremely well by a single disk of inclination 26.2+-2.0deg, position angle of the line of nodes 129.1+-13.0 deg, and distance modulusof 18.470+-0.006 mag (random errors only) up to the lmc centre.

1205.4310	systematic differences in simple stellar population model results:  application to the m31 globular-like cluster system	simple stellar population (ssp) synthesis models are useful tools forstudying the nature of unresolved star clusters in external galaxies. however,the plethora of currently available ssp models gives rise to significant andpoorly documented systematic differences. here we consider the outputs of thecommonly used bruzual &amp; charlot and galev models, as well as a recently updatedssp model suite which attempts to include the contributions of binary mergerproducts in the form of blue straggler stars (bs-ssp). we rederive the ages,metallicities, extinction values and masses of 445 previously observedglobular-like clusters in m31 based on chi-square minimisation of theirspectral energy distributions with respect to these three different ssp modelsand adopting a chabrier-like stellar initial mass function. a comparisonbetween our new results and previous estimates of the same parameters showsthat the bruzual &amp; charlot models yield the youngest ages and lowest masses,while adoption of the bs-ssp models results in the oldest ages and highest massestimates. similarly, the galev ssp models produce the lowest metallicities,with the highest values resulting from the bs-ssp model suite. these trends arecaused by intrinsic differences associated with the models, and are notsignificantly affected by the well-known age-metallicity degeneracy. finally,we note that the mass function of the massive m31 star clusters is similar tothat of the milky way's globular clusters, which implies that the two starcluster systems likely formed under similar environmental conditions.

0711.2156	simple stellar population models as probed by the large magellanic cloud  star cluster eso 121-sc03	the presence of blue straggler stars (bss) in star clusters has proven achallenge to conventional simple stellar population (ssp) models. conventionalssp models are based on the evolution theory of single stars. meanwhile, thetypical locations of bss in the colour-magnitude diagram of a cluster arebrighter and bluer than the main sequence turn-off point. such loci cannot bepredicted by single-star evolution theory. however, stars with such propertiescontribute significantly to the integrated light of the cluster. in this paper,we reconstruct the integrated properties of the large magellanic cloud clustereso 121-sc03, based on a detailed exploration of the individual cluster stars,and with particular emphasis on the cluster's bss. we find that the integratedlight properties of eso 121-sc03 are dramatically modified by its bs component.the integrated spectral energy distribution (ised) flux level is significantlyenhanced toward shorter wavelengths, and all broad-band colours become bluer.when fitting the fully integrated ised of this cluster based on conventionalssp models, the best-fitting values of age and metallicity are significantlyunderestimated compared to the true cluster parameters. the age underestimateis $\sim40$ per cent if we only include the bss within the cluster's half-lightradius and $\sim60$ per cent if all bss are included. the correspondingunderestimates of the cluster's metallicity are $\sim30$ and $\sim60$ per cent,respectively. the populous star clusters in the magellanic clouds are idealobjects to explore the potential importance of bss for the integrated lightproperties of more distant unresolved star clusters in a statistically robustmanner, since they cover a large range in age and metallicity.

0712.1748	the effect of binaries on the dynamical mass determination of star  clusters	the total mass of distant star clusters is often derived from the virialtheorem, using line-of-sight velocity dispersion measurements and half-lightradii. although most stars form in binary systems, this is mostly ignored wheninterpreting the observations. the components of binary stars exhibit orbitalmotion, which may increase the measured velocity dispersion, and may thereforeresult in a dynamical mass overestimation. in this paper we quantify the effectof neglecting the binary population on the derivation of the dynamical mass ofa star cluster. we simulate star clusters numerically, and study the dependenceof the derived dynamical mass on the properties of the binary population. wefind that the presence of binaries plays a crucial role for very sparseclusters with a stellar density comparable to that of the field star population(~0.1 stars/pc3), as the velocity dispersion is fully dominated by the binaryorbital motion. for such clusters, the dynamical mass may overestimate the truemass by up to an order of magnitude. for very dense clusters (&gt;10^7 stars/pc3),binaries do not affect the dynamical mass estimation significantly. forclusters of intermediate density (0.1-10^7 stars/pc3), the dynamical mass canbe overestimated by 10-100%, depending on the properties of the binarypopulation.

1310.5967	the vmc survey. viii. first results for anomalous cepheids	the vista near-infrared $yjk_\mathrm{s}$ survey of the magellanic cloudssystem (vmc, pi m.-r. l. cioni) is collecting deep $k_\mathrm{s}$-bandtime-series photometry of the pulsating variable stars hosted in the systemformed by the two magellanic clouds and the bridge connecting them. in thispaper we present for the first time $k_\mathrm{s}$-band light curves foranomalous cepheid (ac) variables. in particular, we have analysed a sample of48 large magellanic cloud acs, for which identification and optical magnitudeswere obtained from the ogle iii and iv catalogues. the vmc $k_\mathrm{s}$-bandlight curves for acs are well sampled, with the number of epochs ranging from 8to 16, and allowing us to obtain very precise mean $k_\mathrm{s}$ magnitudeswith errors on average of the order of 0.01 mag. the $\langle k_\mathrm{s}\rangle$ values were used to build the first period-luminosity andperiod-wesenheit relations in the near-infrared for fundamental-mode and firstovertone acs. at the same time we exploited the optical ($v,i$) ogle data tobuild accurate period-luminosity, period-luminosity-colour and period-wesenheitrelations both for fundamental-mode and first overtone acs. for the first timethese relations were derived from a sample of pulsators which uniformly coverthe whole ac instability strip. the application of the optical period-wesenheitrelation to a sample of dwarf galaxies hosting a significant population of acsrevealed that this relation is a valuable tool for deriving distances withinthe local group. due to its lower dispersion, we expect the $k_\mathrm{s}$period-wesenheit relations first derived in this paper to represent a valuabletool for measuring accurate distances to galaxies hosting acs when more data innear-infrared filters become available.

0803.1991	open cluster stability and the effects of binary stars	the diagnostic age versus mass-to-light ratio diagram is often used inattempts to constrain the shape of the stellar initial mass function (imf), andthe potential longevity of extragalactic young to intermediate-age massive starclusters. here, we explore its potential for galactic open clusters. on thebasis of a small, homogenised cluster sample we provide useful constraints onthe presence of significant binary fractions. using the massive young galacticcluster westerlund 1 as a key example, we caution that stochasticity in the imfintroduces significant additional uncertainties. we conclude that for an opencluster to survive for any significant length of time, and in the absence ofsubstantial external perturbations, it is a necessary but not a sufficientcondition to be located close to or (in the presence of a significant binarypopulation) somewhat below the predicted photometric evolutionary sequences for"normal" simple stellar populations (although such a location may be dominatedby a remaining "bound" cluster core and thus not adequately reflect the overallcluster dynamics).

1410.7817	the vmc survey. xiii. type ii cepheids in the large magellanic cloud	the vista survey of the magellanic clouds system (vmc) is collecting deep$k_\mathrm{s}$--band time--series photometry of the pulsating variable starshosted in the system formed by the two magellanic clouds and the bridgeconnecting them. in this paper we have analysed a sample of 130 largemagellanic cloud (lmc) type ii cepheids (t2ceps) found in tiles with completeor near complete vmc observations for which identification and opticalmagnitudes were obtained from the ogle iii survey. we present $j$ and$k_\mathrm{s}$ light curves for all 130 pulsators, including 41 bl her, 62 wvir (12 pw vir) and 27 rv tau variables. we complement our near-infraredphotometry with the $v$ magnitudes from the ogle iii survey, allowing us tobuild a variety of period-luminosity ($pl$), period-luminosity-colour ($plc$)and period-wesenheit ($pw$) relationships, including any combination of the $v,j, k_\mathrm{s}$ filters and valid for bl her and w vir classes. theserelationships were calibrated in terms of the lmc distance modulus, while anindependent absolute calibration of the $pl(k_\mathrm{s})$ and the$pw(k_\mathrm{s},v)$ was derived on the basis of distances obtained from$hubble space telescope$ parallaxes and baade-wesselink technique. when appliedto the lmc and to the galactic globular clusters hosting t2ceps, theserelations seem to show that: 1) the two population ii standard candles rr lyraeand t2ceps give results in excellent agreement with each other; 2) there is adiscrepancy of $\sim$0.1 mag between population ii standard candles andclassical cepheids when the distances are gauged in a similar way for all thequoted pulsators. however, given the uncertainties, this discrepancy is withinthe formal 1$\sigma$ uncertainties.

1503.06656	the vmc survey - xv. the small magellanic cloud--bridge connection  history as traced by their star cluster populations	we present results based on yjks photometry of star clusters located in theoutermost, eastern region of the small magellanic cloud (smc). we analysed atotal of 51 catalogued clusters whose colour--magnitude diagrams (cmds), havingbeen cleaned from field-star contamination, were used to assess the clusters'reality and estimate ages of the genuine systems. based on cmd analysis, 15catalogued clusters were found to be possible non-genuine aggregates. weinvestigated the properties of 80% of the catalogued clusters in this part ofthe smc by enlarging our sample with previously obtained cluster ages, adoptinga homogeneous scale for all. their spatial distribution suggests that theoldest clusters, log(t yr-1) &gt;= 9.6, are in general located at greaterdistances to the galaxy's centre than their younger counterparts -- 9.0 &lt;=log(t yr-1) &lt;= 9.4 -- while two excesses of clusters are seen at log(t yr-1) ~9.2 and log(t yr-1) ~ 9.7. we found a trail of younger clusters which followthe wing/bridge components. this long spatial sequence does not only harbourvery young clusters, log(t yr-1) ~ 7.3, but it also hosts some of intermediateages, log(t yr-1) ~ 9.1. the derived cluster and field-star formationfrequencies as a function of age are different. the most surprising feature isan observed excess of clusters with ages of log(t yr-1) &lt; 9.0, which could havebeen induced by interactions with the lmc.

astro-ph;0111311	mass segregation in young compact star clusters in the large magellanic  cloud: i. data and luminosity functions	we have undertaken a detailed analysis of hst/wfpc2 and stis imagingobservations, and of supplementary wide-field ground-based observationsobtained with the ntt of two young ~10-25 myr) compact star clusters in thelmc, ngc 1805 and ngc 1818. the ultimate goal of our work is to improve ourunderstanding of the degree of primordial mass segregation in star clusters.this is crucial for the interpretation of observational luminosity functions(lfs) in terms of the initial mass function (imf), and for constraining theuniversality of the imf.  we present evidence for strong luminosity segregation in both clusters. thelf slopes steepen with cluster radius; in both ngc 1805 and ngc 1818 the lfslopes reach a stable level well beyond the clusters' core or half-light radii.in addition, the brightest cluster stars are strongly concentrated within theinner ~4 r_hl.  the global cluster lf, although strongly nonlinear, is fairly wellapproximated by the core or half-light lf; the (annular) lfs at these radii aredominated by the segregated high-luminosity stars, however.  we present tentative evidence for the presence of an excess number of brightstars surrounding ngc 1818, for which we argue that they are most likelymassive stars that have been collisionally ejected from the cluster core. wetherefore suggest that the cores of massive young stars clusters undergosignificant dynamical evolution, even on time-scales as short as ~25 myr.

astro-ph;0111312	mass segregation in young compact star clusters in the large magellanic  cloud: ii. mass functions	we review the complications involved in the conversion of stellarluminosities into masses and apply a range of mass-to-luminosity relations toour hubble space telescope observations of the young lmc star clusters ngc 1805and ngc 1818.  both the radial dependence of the mass function (mf) and the dependence ofthe cluster core radii on mass indicate clear mass segregation in both clustersat radii r &lt;= 20-30'', for masses in excess of ~1.6-2.5 msun. this result doesnot depend on the mass range used to fit the slopes or the metallicity assumed.it is clear that the cluster mfs, at any radius, are not simple power laws.  the global and the annular mfs near the core radii appear to be characterisedby similar slopes in the mass range (-0.15 &lt;= log m/msun &lt;= 0.85), the mfsbeyond r &gt;= 30'' have significantly steeper slopes.  we estimate that while the ngc 1818 cluster core is between ~5 and ~30crossing times old, the core of ngc 1805 is likely $\lesssim 3-4$ crossingtimes old. however, since strong mass segregation is observed out to ~6 rcoreand ~3 rcore in ngc 1805 and ngc 1818, respectively, it is most likely thatsignificant primordial mass segregation was present in both clusters,particularly in ngc 1805.

astro-ph;0204398	an hst survey of the mid-uv morphology of nearby galaxies	(abbreviated) we present an imaging survey of 37 nearby galaxies observedwith hst/wfpc2 in the mid-uv f300w filter and in f814w. 11 galaxies were alsoimaged in f255w. these galaxies were selected to be detectable with wfpc2 inone orbit, and cover a wide range of hubble types and inclinations. the mid-uvspans the gap between our groundbased optical/nir images and far-uv imagesavailable from the astro/uit missions. our first qualitative results are:  (1) early-type galaxies show a significant decrease in surface brightnessgoing from the red to the mid-uv, and in some cases the presence of dust lanes.some galaxies would be classified different when viewed in the mid-uv, somebecome dominated by a blue nuclear feature or point source.  (2) half of the mid-type spiral and star-forming galaxies appear as a latermorphological type in the mid-uv, as astro/uit also found in the far-uv. some-times these differences are dramatic. the mid-uv images show a considerablerange in the scale and surface brightness of individual star-forming regions.almost all mid-type spirals have their small bulges bi-sected by a dust-lane.  (3) most of the heterogeneous subset of late-type, irregular, peculiar, andmerging galaxies display f300w morphologies that are similar to those seen inf814w, but with differences due to recognizable dust features absorbing thebluer light, and due to uv-bright hot stars, star-clusters, and star-formingridges.  in the rest-frame mid-uv, early- to mid-type galaxies are more likely to bemisclassified as later types than vice versa. this morphological k-correctionexplains only part of the excess faint blue galaxies seen in deep hst fields.

astro-ph;0207172	on the nature of a secondary main sequence turn-off in the rich lmc  cluster ngc 1868	evidence for a second main-sequence turn-off in a deep colour-magnitudediagram of ngc 1868 is presented. the data were obtained with hst/wfpc2 andreach down to m_{555} ~ 25. besides the usual t ~ 0.8 gyr turn-off found inprevious analyses, another possible turn-off is seen at m_{555} ~ 21 (m_v ~2.5), which is consistent with an age of t ~ 3 gyrs. this cmd feature standsout clearly especially when contaminating field lmc stars are statisticallyremoved. the background subtracted cmd also visibly displays a red subgiantbranch extending about 1.5 mag below the younger turn-off and the clump of redgiants. the significance of the secondary turn-off in ngc 1868 was confirmedwith monte-carlo simulations and bootstrapping techniques. star-counts inselected regions in the cluster cmd indicate a mass ratio of oldpopulation/young population in the range 5% &lt;= m_{old} / m_{young} &lt;= 12%,depending on the mass function slope. the existence of such a subpopulation inngc 1868 is significant even in the presence of uncertainties in backgroundsubtraction. the possibility that the secondary turn-off is associated with thefield star population was examined by searching for similar features in cmds offield stars. statistically significant excesses of stars redwards of themain-sequence were found in all such fields in the range 20 &lt;= m_{555} &lt;= 22.these however are much broader features that do not resemble the main-sequencetermination of a single population. we also discuss other alternativeexplanations for the feature at m_{555} ~ 21, such as unresolved binarism,peculiar stars or cmd discontinuities associated with the bohm-vitense gap.

astro-ph;0208150	mass segregation in rich clusters in the large magellanic cloud - iii.  implications for the initial mass function	the distribution of core radii of rich clusters in the large magellanic cloud(lmc) systematically increases in both upper limit and spread with increasingcluster age. cluster-to-cluster variations in the stellar initial mass function(imf) have been suggested as an explanation. we discuss the implications of theobserved degree of mass segregation in our sample clusters for the shape of theinitial mass function.  our results are based on hubble space telescope/wfpc2 observations of sixrich star clusters in the lmc, selected to include three pairs of clusters ofsimilar age, metallicity, and distance from the lmc centre, and exhibiting alarge spread in core radii between the clusters in each pair.  all clusters show clear evidence of mass segregation: (i) their luminosityfunction slopes steepen with increasing cluster radius, and (ii) the brighterstars are characterized by smaller core radii. for all sample clusters, boththe slope of the luminosity function in the cluster centres and the degree ofmass segregation are similar to each other, within observational errors of afew tenths of power-law slope fits to the data. this implies that their initialmass functions must have been very similar, down to ~0.8 - 1.0 m(sun).  we therefore rule out variations in the imf of the individual sample clustersas the main driver of the increasing spread of cluster core radii with clusterage.

astro-ph;0302286	star cluster formation and evolution in nearby starburst galaxies: i.  systematic uncertainties	(abbreviated:) the large majority of extragalactic star cluster studies doneto date have essentially used two or three-passband aperture photometry,combined with theoretical stellar population synthesis models, to obtain age,mass and extinction estimates, and sometimes also metallicities. the accuracyto which this can be done depends on the choice of passband combination and,crucially, also on the wavelength range covered. understanding the systematicuncertainties is of the utmost importance for a well-balanced interpretation ofthe properties of extragalactic star cluster systems. we simultaneously obtainages, metallicities and extinction values for ~300 clusters in the nearbystarburst galaxy ngc 3310, based on archival hubble space telescopeobservations from the ultraviolet (uv) to the near-infrared (nir). we showthat, for ages 6 &lt;= log(age/yr) &lt;= 9, and if one can only obtain partialcoverage of the spectral energy distribution (sed), an optical passbandcombination of at least four filters including both blue and red passbandsresults in the most representative age distribution. we find that whileblue-selected passband combinations lead to age distributions that are slightlybiased towards younger ages due to the age-metallicity degeneracy,red-dominated passband combinations should be avoided. ngc 3310 underwent aglobal burst of cluster formation ~3x10^7 yr ago. this coincides closely withthe last tidal interaction or merger with a low-metallicity galaxy that likelyinduced the formation of the large fraction of clusters with (significantly)subsolar metallicities. the observed cluster system has a median mass of&lt;log(m/msun)&gt; = 5.25 +- 0.1, obtained from scaling the appropriate model sedsfor known masses to the observed cluster seds.

astro-ph;0305184	star cluster formation and evolution in nearby starburst galaxies: ii.  initial conditions	we use the ages, masses and metallicities of the rich young star clustersystems in the nearby starburst galaxies ngc 3310 and ngc 6745 to derive theircluster formation histories and subsequent evolution. we further expand ouranalysis of the systematic uncertainties involved in the use of broad-bandobservations to derive these parameters by examining the effects of a prioriassumptions on the individual cluster metallicities. the age (and metallicity)distributions of both the clusters in the circumnuclear ring in ngc 3310 and ofthose outside the ring are statistically indistinguishable, but there is aclear and significant excess of higher-mass clusters in the ring compared tothe non-ring cluster sample; it is likely that the physical conditions in thestarburst ring may be conducive for the formation of higher-mass star clusters,on average, than in the relatively more quiescent environment of the maingalactic disc. for the ngc 6745 cluster system we derive a median age of ~10myr. ngc 6745 contains a significant population of high-mass "super starclusters", with masses in the range 6.5 &lt;= log(m_cl/m_sun) &lt;= 8.0. thisdetection supports the scenario that such objects form preferentially in theextreme environments of interacting galaxies. the age of the clusterpopulations in both ngc 3310 and ngc 6745 is significantly lower than theirrespective characteristic cluster disruption time-scales. this allows us toobtain an independent estimate of the initial cluster mass function slope,alpha = 2.04(+- 0.23)(+0.13)(-0.43) for ngc 3310, and 1.96(+- 0.15)(+- 0.19)for ngc 6745, respectively, for masses m_cl &gt;= 10^5 m_sun and m_cl &gt;= 4 x 10^5m_sun. these mass function slopes are consistent with those of other young starcluster systems in interacting and starburst galaxies.

astro-ph;0306446	on the formation of star clusters in the merger ngc 6240	we identified star clusters in archived hst/wfpc2 images of the merger andultra-luminous infrared galaxy ngc 6240, with the aim of investigating whetherstar cluster properties (luminosity, age and mass) in such an extremeenvironment differ from those of clusters in less luminous starburst galaxies.we found 54 star clusters in all of the f450w, f547m and f814w exposures, ofwhich 41 are located in the main body of ngc 6240 and 13 in the galactic tails.given that only two colours are available to derive two independent variables(cluster reddening and age), we adopted an ad hoc procedure to statisticallyderive cluster parameters under the assumption that the cluster metallicity islmc-like. the colours of each cluster are fitted to starburst99 models of fixedmass and variable ages and reddenings. all cluster reddening and age solutionswith chi squared &lt; 1 are considered to be consistent with the data. masses arederived by scaling the luminosity of the models with best-fit chi squared &lt; 1by the observed v luminosity, after correction for reddening and distance. weinfer that the most probable age of the observed clusters is (5 - 13) myr andtheir most probable mass is about (1 - 2)e05 solar masses. comparison with starclusters in starburst galaxies seems to point to more massive clusters beingformed in more massive galaxies and gas-rich mergers, while the overall clustermass distribution might be relatively independent of the details of theassociated starburst where dense, massive clusters preferentially form.

astro-ph;0308163	nucler star formation in ngc 6240	we have made use of archival hst bvijh photometry to constrain the nature ofthe three discrete sources, a1, a2 and b1, identified in the double nucleus ofngc 6240. starburst99 models have been fitted to the observed colours, underthe assumption, first, that these sources can be treated as star clusters (i.e.single, instantaneous episodes of star formation), and subsequently asstar-forming regions (i.e. characterised by continuous star formation). forboth scenarios, we estimate ages as young as 4 million years, integrated massesranging between 7x10^6 msun (b1) and 10^9 msun (a1) and a rate of 1 supernovaper year, which, together with the stellar winds, sustains a galactic wind of44 msun/yr. in the case of continuous star formation, a star-formation rate hasbeen derived for a1 as high as 270 msun/yr, similar to what is observed forwarm ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) with a double nucleus. the a1source is characterised by a mass density of about 1200 msun/pc^3 whichresembles the co molecular mass density measured in cold ulirgs and the stellardensity determined in ``elliptical core'' galaxies. this, together with therecent discovery of a supermassive binary black hole in the double nucleus ofngc 6240, might indicate that the ongoing merger could shape the galaxy into acore elliptical.

astro-ph;0309156	young star clusters: progenitors of globular clusters!?	star cluster formation is a major mode of star formation in the extremeconditions of interacting galaxies and violent starbursts. young clusters areobserved to form in a variety of such galaxies, a substantial number resemblingthe progenitors of globular clusters in mass and size, but with significantlyenhanced metallicity. from studies of the metal-poor and metal-rich starcluster populations of galaxies, we can therefore learn about the violent starformation history of these galaxies, and eventually about galaxy formation andevolution. we present a new set of evolutionary synthesis models of our galevcode, with special emphasis on the gaseous emission of presently forming starclusters, and a new tool to compare extensive model grids with multi-colorbroad-band observations to determine individual cluster masses, metallicities,ages and extinction values independently. first results for young star clustersin the dwarf starburst galaxy ngc 1569 are presented. the mass distributionsdetermined for the young clusters give valuable input to dynamical star clustersystem evolution models, regarding survival and destruction of clusters. weplan to investigate an age sequence of galaxy mergers to see dynamicaldestruction effects in process.

astro-ph;0403452	optical imaging and spectroscopy of the edge-on sbc galaxy ugc10043:  evidence for a galactic wind and a peculiar triaxial bulge	we present new optical imaging and spectroscopy of the peculiar, edge-on sbcgalaxy ugc10043. b &amp; r imaging reveals that the inner bulge of ugc10043 iselongated perpendicular to the major axis. at larger r, the bulge isophotestwist to become oblate and nearly circular, suggesting the bulge is triaxial.based on stellar and ionized gas kinematics, the bulge shows no clear evidencefor rotation about either its major or minor axis. the southwestern quadrant ofthe bulge is girdled by a narrow dust lane parallel to the minor axis that maybe part of an inner polar ring. the stellar disk of ugc10043 has a low opticalsurface brightness, a small scale height, a mild integral sign warp, and adusty, inner region that appears tilted relative to the outlying disk. the haand [nii] emission lines in ugc10043 resolve into multiple velocity components,indicating the presence of a large-scale galactic wind with an outflow velocityof ~104 km/s. ha+[nii] imaging reaffirms this picture by revealing ionized gasextended to |z|~3.5kpc in a biconical structure. the [nii]/ha line intensityratio increases with increasing distance from the plane, reaching values ashigh as 1.7. unlike most galaxies with large-scale winds, ugc10043 has only amodest global star formation rate (~1m_sun/yr), implying the wind is powered bya rather feeble central starburst. we discuss evolutionary scenarios that couldaccount for both the structural complexities of ugc10043 and its large-scalewind.

astro-ph;0404422	cirpass near-infrared integral-field spectroscopy of massive star  clusters in the starburst galaxy ngc 1140	[abridged] we analyse near-infrared integral field spectroscopy of thecentral starburst region of ngc 1140, obtained at the gemini-south telescopeequipped with cirpass. our ~1.45-1.67 um wavelength coverage includes thebright [fe ii] emission line, as well as high-order brackett (hydrogen) lines.while strong [fe ii] emission, thought to originate in the thermal shocksassociated with supernova remnants, is found throughout the galaxy, both br12-4 and br 14-4 emission, and weak co(6,3) absorption, is predominantlyassociated with the northern starburst region. the brackett lines originatefrom recombination processes occurring on smaller scales in (young) hiiregions. the time-scale associated with strong [fe ii] emission implies thatmost of the recent star-formation activity in ngc 1140 was induced in the past35-55 myr. based on the spatial distributions of the [fe ii] versus brackettline emission, we conclude that a galaxy-wide starburst was induced severaltens of myr ago, with more recent starburst activity concentrated around thenorthern starburst region. this scenario is (provisionally) confirmed by ouranalysis of the spectral energy distributions of the compact, young massivestar clusters (ymcs) detected in new and archival broad-band hst images. theymc ages in ngc 1140 are all &lt;= 20 myr, consistent with independentlydetermined estimates of the galaxy's starburst age, while there appears to bean age difference between the northern and southern ymc complexes in the senseexpected from our cirpass analysis. our photometric mass estimates of the ngc1140 ymcs, likely upper limits, are comparable to those of the highest-massgalactic globular clusters and to spectroscopically confirmed masses of(compact) ymcs in other starburst galaxies.

astro-ph;0502289	systematic uncertainties in the analysis of star cluster parameters  based on broad-band imaging observations	(abridged) we assess the systematic uncertainties in (young) cluster age,mass, and - to a lesser extent - extinction and metallicity determinations,based on broad-band imaging observations with the hubble space telescope. ouraim here is to intercompare the results obtained using a variety of commonlyused modelling techniques, specifically with respect to our own extensivelytested multi-dimensional approach. any significant differences among theresulting parameters are due to the details of the various, independentlydeveloped modelling techniques used, rather than to the stellar populationmodels themselves. despite the model uncertainties and the selection effectsinherent to most methods used, we find that the peaks in the relative age andmass distributions of a given young (&lt;= 10^9 yr) cluster system can be derivedrelatively robustly and consistently, to accuracies of sigma_t = delta &lt;log(age/ yr)&gt; &lt;= 0.35 and sigma_m = delta &lt;log(m_cl / msun)&gt; &lt;= 0.14, respectively,assuming gaussian distributions in cluster ages and masses for reasons ofsimplicity. the peaks in the relative mass distributions can be obtained with ahigher degree of confidence than those in the relative age distributions, asexemplified by the smaller spread among the peak values of the massdistributions derived. this implies that mass determinations are mostlyinsensitive to the approach adopted. we reiterate that as extensive awavelength coverage as possible is required to obtain robust and internallyconsistent age and mass estimates for the individual objects, with reasonableuncertainties. finally, we conclude that the actual filter systems used for theobservations should be used for constructing model colours, instead of usingconversion equations, to achieve more accurate derivations of ages and masses.

astro-ph;0504496	from young massive star cluster to old globular: the l_v-sigma_0  relationship as a diagnostic tool	we present a new analysis of the properties of the young massive starclusters, which demonstrates that these objects are plausible progenitors ofold globular clusters (gcs). the method is based on the tight relationship forold gcs between their v-band luminosities and (central) velocity dispersions,sigma_0. we improve the significance of the relationship and find that itsfunctional form, l_v/lsun \propto sigma_0^(1.57 +- 0.10) (km/s), is fullyconsistent with previous determinations for smaller galactic and m31 gcsamples. the tightness of the relationship for a gc sample drawn fromenvironments as diverse as those found in the local group implies that itsorigin must be sought in intrinsic properties of the gc formation processitself. we evolve the luminosities of the young massive star clusters (ymcs) inthe local universe to an age of 12 gyr and find that most ymcs will evolve toloci close to, or to slightly fainter luminosities than the improved gcrelationship. in the absence of significant external disturbances, this impliesthat these objects may potentially survive to become old gc-type objects over ahubble time. the main advantage of our new method is its simplicity; the onlyobservables required here are the system's velocity dispersion and luminosity.the most important factor affecting the robustness of our conclusions is theadopted form of the initial mass function. we use n-body simulations to confirmthat dynamical evolution of the clusters does not significantly alter ourconclusions.

astro-ph;0507276	nearby star cluster formation: probes of cosmological galaxy evolution	(abridged) the old star cluster (sc) systems surrounding any sofarinvestigated galaxy represent a powerful tool for the understanding of thecosmological evolution of their host galaxies. phases of enhanced clusterformation can be identified by reliably age dating the clusters. these aresymptoms of violent star formation, results of intense starbursts as commonlyseen in merging nearby galaxies and high-z forming galaxies. however, the youngsc systems of nearby merging galaxies and the old sc systems of nearby passivegalaxies (most likely resulting from high-z starburst events of these galaxies)appear to be significantly different in terms of their mass functions. whetherthis difference originates in differences in the formation physics/environmentor is only due to dynamical evolution of the cluster systems is currently a hotissue. a main diagnostic for the survival probability of a newly formed clusteris most likely its compactness, since less compact, fluffy clusters are morevulnerable to destructive interactions with the galactic environment of thecluster. for these reasons, we developed  1) a tool to significantly improve photometry of nearby scs (which appearresolved on high-resolution images, provided e.g. by hst), by accuratelymeasuring and taking the cluster size into account, and  2) a tool to effectively determine ages and masses (plus metallicities andextinctions) of scs from multi-wavelength photometry, ranging from the uv tothe nir.

astro-ph;0702012	structural parameters of mayall ii = g1 in m31	mayall ii = g1 is one of the most luminous globular clusters (gcs) known inm31. new deep, high-resolution observations with the advanced camera forsurveys on the {\sl hubble space telescope} are used to provide accuratephotometric data to the smallest radii yet. in particular, we present theprecise variation of ellipticity and position angle, and of surface brightnessfor the core of the object. based on these accurate photometric data, weredetermine the structural parameters of g1 by fitting a single-mass isotropicking model. we derive a core radius, $r_c=0.21\pm0.01\arcsec (=0.78\pm0.04\rm{pc})$, a tidal radius, $r_t=21.8\pm1.1\arcsec (=80.7\pm3.9 \rm{pc})$, and aconcentration index $c=\log (r_t/r_c)=2.01\pm0.02$. the central surfacebrightness is 13.510 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. we also calculate the half-lightradius, at $r_h=1.73\pm0.07\arcsec(=6.5\pm0.3 \rm{pc})$. the results show that,within 10 core radii, a king model fits the surface brightness distributionwell. we find that this object falls in the same region of the $m_v$ vs. $\logr_h$ diagram as $\omega$ centauri, m54 and ngc 2419 in the milky way. all threeof these objects have been claimed to be the stripped cores of now defunctdwarf galaxies. we discuss in detail whether gcs, stripped cores of dwarfspheroidals and normal dwarf galaxies form a continuous distribution in the$m_v$ versus $\log r_h$ plane, or if gcs and dwarf spheroidals constitutedistinct classes of objects; we present arguments in favour of this latterview.

astro-ph;0702413	the young star cluster system in the antennae: evidence for a turnover  in the luminosity function	the luminosity functions (lfs) of star cluster systems (i.e. the number ofclusters per luminosity interval) are vital diagnostics to probe the conditionsof star cluster formation. early studies have revealed a clear dichotomybetween old globular clusters and young clusters, with the former characterisedby gaussian-shaped lfs, and the latter following a power law. recently, thisview was challenged by studies of galaxy merger remnants and post-starburstgalaxies. in this paper we re-evaluate the young ($\lta$ few hundreds of myrs,with the majority $\lta$ few tens of myrs) star cluster system in the ongoingspiral-spiral major merger system ngc 4038/39, the "antennae" galaxies. theantennae galaxies represent a very active and complex star-forming environment,which hampers cluster selection and photometry as well as the determination ofobservational completeness fractions. a main issue of concern is the largenumber of bright young stars contained in most earlier studies, which wecarefully exclude from our cluster sample by accurately determining the sourcesizes. the resulting lfs are fitted both with gaussian and with power-lawdistributions, taking into account both the observational completenessfractions and photometric errors, and compared using a likelihood ratio test.the likelihood ratio results are rigidly evaluated using monte carlosimulations. we perform a number of additional tests, e.g. with subsets of thetotal sample, all confirming our main result: that a gaussian distribution fitsthe observed lfs of clusters in this preferentially very young cluster systemsignificantly better than a power-law distribution, at a (statistical) errorprobability of less than 0.5 per cent.

astro-ph;9707074	the z-structure of disk galaxies towards the galaxy planes	we present a detailed study of a statistically complete sample of highlyinclined disk galaxies in the near-infrared k' band. since the k'-band light isrelatively insensitive to contamination by galactic dust, we have been able tofollow the vertical light distributions all the way down to the galaxy planes.the mean levels for the sharpness of the k'-band luminosity peaks indicate thatthe vertical luminosity distributions are more peaked than expected for theintermediate sech(z) distribution, but rounder than exponential. sinceprojection of not completely edge-on galaxies onto the plane of the sky causesvertical luminosity profiles to become rounder, we have performed simulationsthat show that it is possible that all our galaxies can have intrinsicallyexponential vertical surface brightness distributions. we find that the profileshape is independent of galaxy type, and varies little with position along themajor axis. the fact that we observe this in all our sample galaxies indicatesthat the formation process of the galaxy disks perpendicular to the galaxyplanes is a process intrinsic to the disks themselves.

astro-ph;9910288	on the axis ratio of the stellar velocity ellipsoid in disks of spiral  galaxies	the spatial distribution of stars in a disk of a galaxy can be described by aradial scale length and a vertical scale height. the ratio of these two scaleparameters contains information on the axis ratio of the velocity ellipsoid,i.e. the ratio of the vertical to radial stellar velocity dispersions of thestars, at least at some fiducial distance from the center. the radial velocitydispersion correlates well with the amplitude of the rotation curve and withthe disk integrated magnitude, as was found by bottema (1993). these relationscan be understood as the result of the stellar disk being (marginally) stableagainst local instabilities at all length scales. this is expressed by toomre'swell-known criterion, which relates the sheer in the rotation to a minimumvalue that the radial stellar velocity dispersion should have for stability fora given surface density. via the tully-fisher (1977) relation, the velocitydispersion then becomes related to the integrated magnitude and hence to thescale length. the vertical velocity dispersion relates directly to the scaleheight through hydrostatic equilibrium. it can be shown that the ratio of thetwo length scales relates to the axis ratio of the velocity ellipsoid onlythrough the toomre parameter q and in particular does not require a choice ofthe mass-to-light ratio or a distance scale.  we have applied this to the statistically complete sample of edge-ongalaxies, for which de grijs (1997) has performed surface photometry and hasdetermined the length scales in the stellar light distribution.
