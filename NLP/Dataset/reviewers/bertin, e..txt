1003.0005	optical redshift and richness estimates for galaxy clusters selected  with the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect from 2008 south pole telescope  observations	we present redshifts and optical richness properties of 21 galaxy clustersuniformly selected by their sunyaev-zel'dovich signature. these clusters, plusan additional, unconfirmed candidate, were detected in a 178 square-degree areasurveyed by the south pole telescope in 2008. using griz imaging from theblanco cosmology survey and from pointed magellan telescope observations, aswell as spectroscopy using magellan facilities, we confirm the existence ofclustered red-sequence galaxies, report red-sequence photometric redshifts,present spectroscopic redshifts for a subsample, and derive r_200 radii andm_200 masses from optical richness. the clusters span redshifts from 0.15 togreater than 1, with a median redshift of 0.74; three clusters are estimated tobe at z &gt; 1. redshifts inferred from mean red-sequence colors exhibit 2% rmsscatter in sigma_z/(1+z) with respect to the spectroscopic subsample for z &lt; 1.we show that m_200 cluster masses derived from optical richness correlate withmasses derived from south pole telescope data and agree with previously derivedscaling relations to within the uncertainties. optical and infrared imaging isan efficient means of cluster identification and redshift estimation in largesunyaev-zel'dovich surveys, and exploiting the same data for richnessmeasurements, as we have done, will be useful for constraining cluster massesand radii for large samples in cosmological analysis.

1004.3876	extending the canada-france brown dwarfs survey to the near-infrared:  first ultracool brown dwarfs from cfbdsir	we present the first results of the ongoing canada-france brown dwarfssurvey-infrared, hereafter cfbdsir, a near infrared extension to the opticalwide-field survey cfbds. our final objectives are to constrain ultracoolatmosphere physics by finding a statistically significant sample of objectscooler than 650k and to explore the ultracool brown dwarf mass functionbuilding on a well defined sample of such objects. candidates are identified incfht/wircam j and cfht/megacam z' images using optimised psf-fitting, and wefollow them up with pointed near infrared imaging with sofi at ntt. we finallyobtain low resolution spectroscopy of the coolest candidates to characterisetheir atmospheric physics. we have so far analysed and followed up allcandidates on the first 66 square degrees of the 335 square degrees survey. weidentified 55 t-dwarfs candidates with z'-j &gt; 3:5 and have confirmed six ofthem as t-dwarfs, including 3 that are strong later-than-t8 candidates, basedon their far-red and nir colours. we also present here the nir spectra of oneof these ultracool dwarfs, cfbdsir1458+1013 which confirms it as one of thecoolest brown dwarf known, possibly in the 550-600k temperature range. from thecompleted survey we expect to discover 10 to 15 dwarfs later than t8, more thandoubling the known number of such objects. this will enable detailed studies oftheir extreme atmospheric properties and provide a stronger statistical basefor studies of their luminosity function.

1005.3295	the clusters abell~222 and abell~223: a multi-wavelength view	(abstract abridged) the abell 222 and 223 clusters are located at an averageredshift z ~ 0.21 and are separated by 0.26 deg. signatures of mergers havebeen previously found in these clusters, both in x-rays and atopticalwavelengths, thus motivating our study. in x-rays, they are relativelybright, and abell 223 shows a double structure. a filament has also beendetected between the clusters both at optical and x-ray wavelengths. we analysethe optical properties of these two clusters based on deep imaging in twobands, derive their galaxy minosity functions (glfs) and correlate theseproperties with x-ray characteristics derived from xmm-newton data. the glfs ofabell 222 in the g' and r' bands are well fit by a schechter function; the glfis steeper in r' than in g'. for abell 223, the glfs in both bands require asecond component at bright magnitudes, added to a schechter function; they aresimilar in both bands. the serna &amp; gerbal method allows to separate well thetwo clusters. no obvious filamentary structures are detected at very largescales around the clusters, but a third cluster at the same redshift, abell209, is located at a projected distance of 19.2 mpc. x-ray temperature andmetallicity maps reveal that the temperature and metallicity of the x-ray gasare quite homogeneous in abell 222, while they are very perturbed in abell 223.the abell 222/abell 223 system is complex. the two clusters that form thisstructure present very different dynamical states. signs of recent interactionsare also detected in the optical data where this cluster shows a ``perturbed''glf. in summary, the multiwavelength analyses of abell 222 and abell 223 areused to investigate the connection between the icm and the cluster galaxyproperties in an interacting system.

1101.1290	an sz-selected sample of the most massive galaxy clusters in the  2500-square-degree south pole telescope survey	the south pole telescope (spt) is currently surveying 2500 deg^2 of thesouthern sky to detect massive galaxy clusters out to the epoch of theirformation using the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect. this paper presents acatalog of the 26 most significant sz cluster detections in the full surveyregion. the catalog includes 14 clusters which have been previously identifiedand 12 that are new discoveries. these clusters were identified in fieldsobserved to two differing noise depths: 1500 deg^2 at the final spt surveydepth of 18 uk-arcmin at 150 ghz, and 1000 deg^2 at a depth of 54 uk-arcmin.clusters were selected on the basis of their sz signal-to-noise ratio (s/n) inspt maps, a quantity which has been demonstrated to correlate tightly withcluster mass. the s/n thresholds were chosen to achieve a comparable massselection across survey fields of both depths. cluster redshifts were obtainedwith optical and infrared imaging and spectroscopy from a variety of ground-and space-based facilities. the redshifts range from 0.098 \leq z \leq 1.132with a median of z_med = 0.40. the measured sz s/n and redshifts lead tounbiased mass estimates ranging from 9.8 \times 10^14 m_sun/h_70 \leqm_200(rho_mean) \leq 3.1 \times 10^15 m_sun/h_70. based on the sz massestimates, we find that none of the clusters are individually in significanttension with the lambdacdm cosmological model. we also test for evidence ofnon-gaussianity based on the cluster sample and find the data show nopreference for non-gaussian perturbations.

1103.4612	a multiband study of the galaxy populations of the first four  sunyaev--zeldovich effect selected galaxy clusters	we present first results of an examination of the optical properties of thegalaxy populations in sze selected galaxy clusters. using clusters selected bythe south pole telescope survey and deep multiband optical data from the blancocosmology survey, we measure the radial profile, the luminosity function, theblue fraction and the halo occupation number of the galaxy populations of thesefour clusters with redshifts ranging from 0.3 to 1. our goal is to understandwhether there are differences among the galaxy populations of these szeselected clusters and previously studied clusters selected in the optical andthe x-ray. the radial distributions of galaxies in the four systems areconsistent with nfw profiles with a galaxy concentration of 3 to 6. we showthat the characteristic luminosities in $griz$ bands are consistent withpassively evolving populations emerging from a single burst at redshift $z=3$.the faint end power law slope of the luminosity function is found to be onaverage $\alpha \approx -1.2$ in griz. halo occupation numbers (to $m^*+2$) forthese systems appear to be consistent with those based on x-ray selectedclusters. the blue fraction estimated to $0.36l^*$, for the three lowerredshift systems, suggests an increase with redshift, although with the currentsample the uncertainties are still large. overall, this pilot study of thefirst four clusters provides no evidence that the galaxy populations in thesesystems differ significantly from those in previously studied clusterpopulations selected in the x-ray or the optical.

1108.4681	the serendipitous observation of a gravitationally lensed galaxy at z =  0.9057 from the blanco cosmology survey: the elliot arc	we report on the serendipitous discovery in the blanco cosmology survey (bcs)imaging data of a z = 0.9057 galaxy that is being strongly lensed by a massivegalaxy cluster at a redshift of z=0.3838. the lens (bcs j2352-5452) wasdiscovered while examining i- and z-band images being acquired in october 2006during a bcs observing run. follow-up spectroscopic observations with the gmosinstrument on the gemini south 8m telescope confirmed the lensing nature ofthis system. using weak plus strong lensing, velocity dispersion, clusterrichness n_200, and fitting to an nfw cluster mass density profile, we havemade three independent estimates of the mass m_200 which are all veryconsistent with each other. the combination of the results from the threemethods gives m_200 = (5.1 +- 1.3) x 10^14 m_sun, which is fully consistentwith the individual measurements. the final nfw concentration c_200 from thecombined fit is c_200 = 5.4(+1.4 -1.1). we have compared our measurements ofm_200 and c_200 with predictions for (a) clusters from lambda_cdm simulations,(b) lensing selected clusters from simulations, and (c) a real sample ofcluster lenses. we find that we are most compatible with the predictions forlambda_cdm simulations for lensing clusters, and we see no evidence based onthis one system for an increased concentration compared to lambda_cdm. finally,using the flux measured from the [oii]3727 line we have determined the starformation rate (sfr) of the source galaxy and find it to be rather modest giventhe assumed lens magnification.

1204.1210	the blanco cosmology survey: data acquisition, processing, calibration,  quality diagnostics and data release	the blanco cosmology survey (bcs) is a 60 night imaging survey of $\sim$80deg$^2$ of the southern sky located in two fields: ($\alpha$,$\delta$)= (5 hr,$-55^{\circ}$) and (23 hr, $-55^{\circ}$). the survey was carried out between2005 and 2008 in $griz$ bands with the mosaic2 imager on the blanco 4mtelescope. the primary aim of the bcs survey is to provide the data required tooptically confirm and measure photometric redshifts for sunyaev-zel'dovicheffect selected galaxy clusters from the south pole telescope and the atacamacosmology telescope. we process and calibrate the bcs data, carrying out psfcorrected model fitting photometry for all detected objects. the median10$\sigma$ galaxy (point source) depths over the survey in $griz$ areapproximately 23.3 (23.9), 23.4 (24.0), 23.0 (23.6) and 21.3 (22.1),respectively. the astrometric accuracy relative to the usno-b survey is$\sim45$ milli-arcsec. we calibrate our absolute photometry using the stellarlocus in $grizj$ bands, and thus our absolute photometric scale derives from2mass which has $\sim2$% accuracy. the scatter of stars about the stellar locusindicates a systematics floor in the relative stellar photometric scatter in$griz$ that is $\sim$1.9%, $\sim$2.2%, $\sim$2.7% and$\sim$2.7%, respectively.a simple cut in the astromatic star-galaxy classifier {\tt spread\_model}produces a star sample with good spatial uniformity. we use the resultingphotometric catalogs to calibrate photometric redshifts for the survey anddemonstrate scatter $\delta z/(1+z)=0.054$ with an outlier fraction $\eta&lt;5$%to $z\sim1$. we highlight some selected science results to date and provide afull description of the released data products.

1205.6323	moa-2010-blg-477lb: constraining the mass of a microlensing planet from  microlensing parallax, orbital motion and detection of blended light	microlensing detections of cool planets are important for the construction ofan unbiased sample to estimate the frequency of planets beyond the snow line,which is where giant planets are thought to form according to the coreaccretion theory of planet formation. in this paper, we report the discovery ofa giant planet detected from the analysis of the light curve of ahigh-magnification microlensing event moa-2010-blg-477. the measuredplanet-star mass ratio is $q=(2.181\pm0.004)\times 10^{-3}$ and the projectedseparation is $s=1.1228\pm0.0006$ in units of the einstein radius. the angulareinstein radius is unusually large $\theta_{\rm e}=1.38\pm 0.11$ mas. combiningthis measurement with constraints on the "microlens parallax" and the lensflux, we can only limit the host mass to the range $0.13&lt;m/m_\odot&lt;1.0$. inthis particular case, the strong degeneracy between microlensing parallax andplanet orbital motion prevents us from measuring more accurate host and planetmasses. however, we find that adding bayesian priors from two effects (galacticmodel and keplerian orbit) each independently favors the upper end of this massrange, yielding star and planet masses of $m_*=0.67^{+0.33}_{-0.13}\ m_\odot$and $m_p=1.5^{+0.8}_{-0.3}\ m_{\rm jup}$ at a distance of $d=2.3\pm0.6$ kpc,and with a semi-major axis of $a=2^{+3}_{-1}$ au. finally, we show that thelens mass can be determined from future high-resolution near-ir adaptive opticsobservations independently from two effects, photometric and astrometric.

1206.6923	the millennium run observatory: first light	simulations of galaxy evolution aim to capture our current understanding aswell as to make predictions for testing by future experiments. simulations andobservations are often compared in an indirect fashion: physical quantities areestimated from the data and compared to models. however, many applications canbenefit from a more direct approach, where the observing process is alsosimulated and the models are seen fully from the observer's perspective. tofacilitate this, we have developed the millennium run observatory (mrobs), atheoretical virtual observatory which uses virtual telescopes to `observe'semi-analytic galaxy formation models based on the suite of millennium run darkmatter simulations. the mrobs produces data that can be processed and analyzedusing the standard software packages developed for real observations. atpresent, we produce images in forty filters from the rest-frame uv to ir fortwo stellar population synthesis models, three different models of igmabsorption, and two cosmologies (wmap1/7). galaxy distributions for a largenumber of mock lightcones can be `observed' using models of major ground- andspace-based telescopes. the data include lightcone catalogues linked tostructural properties of galaxies, pre-observation model images, mock telescopeimages, and source extractor products that can all be traced back to the higherlevel dark matter, semi-analytic galaxy, and lightcone catalogues available inthe millennium database. here, we describe our methods and announce a firstpublic release of simulated surveys (e.g., sdss, cfht-ls, goods, goods/ers,candels, and hudf). the mrobs browser, an online tool, further facilitatesexploration of the simulated data. we demonstrate the benefits of a directapproach through a number of example applications (galaxy number counts incandels, clusters, morphologies, and dropout selections).

0711.4204	clustering properties of a type-selected volume-limited sample of  galaxies in the cfhtls	(abridged) we present an investigation of the clustering of i'ab&lt;24.5galaxies in the redshift interval 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.2. using 100,000 precise photometricredshifts in the four ultra-deep fields of the canada-france legacy survey, weconstruct a set of volume-limited galaxy catalogues. we study the dependence ofthe amplitude and slope of the galaxy correlation function on absolute b-bandrest-frame luminosity, redshift and best-fitting spectral type. we find: 1. thecomoving correlation length for all galaxies decreases steadily from z~0.3 toz~1. 2. at all redshifts and luminosities, galaxies with redder rest-framecolours have clustering amplitudes between two and three times higher thanbluer ones. 3. for bright red and blue galaxies, the clustering amplitude isinvariant with redshift. 4. at z~0.5, less luminous galaxies have higherclustering amplitudes of around 6 h-1 mpc. 5. the relative bias betweengalaxies with red and blue rest-frame colours increases gradually towardsfainter absolute magnitudes. one of the principal implications of these resultsis that although the full galaxy population traces the underlying dark matterdistribution quite well (and is therefore quite weakly biased), redder, oldergalaxies have clustering lengths which are almost invariant with redshift, andby z~1 are quite strongly biased.

0712.0884	very weak lensing in the cfhtls wide: cosmology from cosmic shear in the  linear regime	we present an exploration of weak lensing by large-scale structure in thelinear regime, using the third-year (t0003) cfhtls wide data release. ourresults place tight constraints on the scaling of the amplitude of the matterpower spectrum sigma_8 with the matter density omega_m. spanning 57 squaredegrees to i'_ab = 24.5 over three independent fields, the unprecedentedcontiguous area of this survey permits high signal-to-noise measurements oftwo-point shear statistics from 1 arcmin to 4 degrees. understanding systematicerrors in our analysis is vital in interpreting the results. we thereforedemonstrate the percent-level accuracy of our method using step simulations, ane/b-mode decomposition of the data, and the star-galaxy cross correlationfunction. we also present a thorough analysis of the galaxy redshiftdistribution using redshift data from the cfhtls t0003 deep fields that probethe same spatial regions as the wide fields. we find sigma_8(omega_m/0.25)^0.64= 0.785+-0.043 using the aperture-mass statistic for the full range of angularscales for an assumed flat cosmology, in excellent agreement with wmap3constraints. the largest physical scale probed by our analysis is 85 mpc,assuming a mean redshift of lenses of 0.5 and a lcdm cosmology. this allows forthe first time to constrain cosmology using only cosmic shear measurements inthe linear regime. using only angular scales theta&gt; 85 arcmin, we findsigma_8(omega_m/0.25)_lin^0.53 = 0.837+-0.084, which agree with the resultsfrom our full analysis. combining our results with data from wmap3, we findomega_m=0.248+-0.019 and sigma_8 = 0.771+-0.029.

0801.0670	brown dwarfs and very low mass stars in the hyades cluster : a  dynamically evolved mass function	we conducted a search for brown dwarfs (bds) and very low mass (vlm) stars inthe 625 myr-old hyades cluster in order to derive the cluster's mass functionacross the stellar-substellar boundary. we performed a deep (i=23, z=22.5)photometric survey over 16 sq.deg. around the cluster center, followed up withk-band photometry to measure the proper motion of candidate members, andoptical and near-ir spectroscopy of probable bd and vlm members. we report thediscovery of the first 2 brown dwarfs in the hyades cluster. the 2 objects havea spectral type early-t and their optical and near-ir photometry as well astheir proper motion are consistent with them being cluster members. accordingto models, their mass is 50 jupiter masses at an age of 625 myr. we also reportthe discovery of 3 new very low mass stellar members of the cluster, andconfirm the membership of 16 others. we combine these results with a list ofpreviously known cluster members to build the present-day mass function (pdmf)of the hyades cluster from 50 jupiter masses to 3mo. we find the hyades pdmf tobe strongly deficient in very low mass objects and brown dwarfs compared to theimf of younger open clusters such as the pleiades. we interpret this deficiencyas the result of dynamical evolution over the past few 100 myr, i.e., thepreferential evaporation of low mass cluster members due to weak gravitationalencounters. we thus estimate that the hyades cluster currently hosts about10-15 brown dwarfs, while its initial substellar population may have amountedup to 150-200 members.

1306.5236	star/galaxy separation at faint magnitudes: application to a simulated  dark energy survey	we address the problem of separating stars from galaxies in future largephotometric surveys. we focus our analysis on simulations of the dark energysurvey (des). in the first part of the paper, we derive the sciencerequirements on star/galaxy separation, for measurement of the cosmologicalparameters with the gravitational weak lensing and large scale structureprobes. these requirements are dictated by the need to control both thestatistical and systematic errors on the cosmological parameters, and by pointspread function calibration. we formulate the requirements in terms of thecompleteness and purity provided by a given star/galaxy classifier. in order toachieve these requirements at faint magnitudes, we propose a new method forstar/galaxy separation in the second part of the paper. we first use principalcomponent analysis to outline the correlations between the objects parametersand extract from it the most relevant information. we then use the reduced setof parameters as input to an artificial neural network. this multi-parameterapproach improves upon purely morphometric classifiers (such as the classifierimplemented in sextractor), especially at faint magnitudes: it increases thepurity by up to 20% for stars and by up to 12% for galaxies, at i-magnitudefainter than 23.

1402.1034	orion revisited. ii. the foreground population to orion a	following the recent discovery of a large population of young stars in frontof the orion nebula, we carried out an observational campaign with the decamwide-field camera covering ~10~deg^2 centered on ngc 1980 to confirm, probe theextent of, and characterize this foreground population of pre-main-sequencestars. we confirm the presence of a large foreground population towards theorion a cloud. this population contains several distinct subgroups, includingngc1980 and ngc1981, and stretches across several degrees in front of the oriona cloud. by comparing the location of their sequence in various color-magnitudediagrams with other clusters, we found a distance and an age of 380pc and5~10myr, in good agreement with previous estimates. our final sample includes2123 candidate members and is complete from below the hydrogen-burning limit toabout 0.3msun, where the data start to be limited by saturation. extrapolatingthe mass function to the high masses, we estimate a total number of ~2600members in the surveyed region. we confirm the presence of a rich, contiguous,and essentially coeval population of about 2600 foreground stars in front ofthe orion a cloud, loosely clustered around ngc1980, ngc1981, and a new groupin the foreground of the omc-2/3. for the area of the cloud surveyed, thisresult implies that there are more young stars in the foreground populationthan young stars inside the cloud. assuming a normal initial mass function, weestimate that between one to a few supernovae must have exploded in theforeground population in the past few million years, close to the surface oforion a, which might be responsible, together with stellar winds, for thestructure and star formation activity in these clouds. this long-overlookedforeground stellar population is of great significance, calling for a revisionof the star formation history in this region of the galaxy.

1407.3801	combining dark energy survey science verification data with near  infrared data from the eso vista hemisphere survey	we present the combination of optical data from the science verificationphase of the dark energy survey (des) with near infrared data from the esovista hemisphere survey (vhs). the deep optical detections from des are used toextract fluxes and associated errors from the shallower vhs data. joint 7-band($grizyjk$) photometric catalogues are produced in a single 3 sq-deg decamfield centred at 02h26m$-$04d36m where the availability of ancillarymulti-wavelength photometry and spectroscopy allows us to test the dataquality. dual photometry increases the number of des galaxies with measured vhsfluxes by a factor of $\sim$4.5 relative to a simple catalogue level matchingand results in a $\sim$1.5 mag increase in the 80\% completeness limit of thenir data. almost 70\% of des sources have useful nir flux measurements in thisinitial catalogue. photometric redshifts are estimated for a subset of galaxieswith spectroscopic redshifts and initial results, although currently limited bysmall number statistics, indicate that the vhs data can help reduce thephotometric redshift scatter at both $z&lt;0.5$ and $z&gt;1$. we present exampledes+vhs colour selection criteria for high redshift luminous red galaxies(lrgs) at $z\sim0.7$ as well as luminous quasars. using spectroscopicobservations in this field we show that the additional vhs fluxes enable acleaner selection of both populations with $&lt;$10\% contamination from galacticstars in the case of spectroscopically confirmed quasars and $&lt;0.5\%$contamination from galactic stars in the case of spectroscopically confirmedlrgs. the combined des+vhs dataset, which will eventually cover almost 5000sq-deg, will therefore enable a range of new science and be ideally suited fortarget selection for future wide-field spectroscopic surveys.

1407.6896	supernovae and their host galaxies - ii. the relative frequencies of  supernovae types in spirals	we present an analysis of the relative frequencies of different supernova(sn) types in spirals with various morphologies and in barred or unbarredgalaxies. we use a well-defined and homogeneous sample of spiral host galaxiesof 692 sne from the sloan digital sky survey in different stages ofgalaxy-galaxy interaction and activity classes of nucleus. we propose that theunderlying mechanisms shaping the number ratios of sne types can be interpretedwithin the framework of interaction-induced star formation, in addition to theknown relations between morphologies and stellar populations. we find a strongtrend in behaviour of the nia/ncc ratio depending on host morphology, such thatearly spirals include more type ia sne. the nibc/nii ratio is higher in a broadbin of early-type hosts. the nia/ncc ratio is nearly constant when changingfrom normal, perturbed to interacting galaxies, then declines in merginggalaxies, whereas it jumps to the highest value in post-merging/remnantgalaxies. in contrast, the nibc/nii ratio jumps to the highest value in merginggalaxies and slightly declines in post-merging/remnant subsample. theinterpretation is that the star formation rates and morphologies of galaxies,which are strongly affected in the final stages of interaction, have an impacton the number ratios of sne types. the nia/ncc (nibc/nii) ratio increases(decreases) from star-forming to active galactic nuclei (agn) classes ofgalaxies. these variations are consistent with the scenario of aninteraction-triggered starburst evolving into agn during the later stages ofinteraction, accompanied with the change of star formation and transformationof the galaxy morphology into an earlier type.

1504.03002	wide-field lensing mass maps from des science verification data:  methodology and detailed analysis	weak gravitational lensing allows one to reconstruct the spatial distributionof the projected mass density across the sky. these "mass maps" provide apowerful tool for studying cosmology as they probe both luminous and darkmatter. in this paper, we present a weak lensing mass map reconstructed fromshear measurements in a 139 sq. deg area from the dark energy survey (des)science verification (sv) data. we compare the distribution of mass with thatof the foreground distribution of galaxies and clusters. the overdensities inthe reconstructed map correlate well with the distribution of opticallydetected clusters. we demonstrate that candidate superclusters and voids alongthe line of sight can be identified, exploiting the tight scatter of thecluster photometric redshifts. we cross-correlate the mass map with aforeground magnitude-limited galaxy sample from the same data. our measurementgives results consistent with mock catalogs from n-body simulations thatinclude the primary sources of statistical uncertainties in the galaxy,lensing, and photo-z catalogs. the statistical significance of thecross-correlation is at the 6.8-sigma level with 20 arcminute smoothing. amajor goal of this study is to investigate systematic effects arising from avariety of sources, including psf and photo-z uncertainties. we make mapsderived from twenty variables that may characterize systematics and find theprincipal components. we find that the contribution of systematics to thelensing mass maps is generally within measurement uncertainties. in this work,we analyze less than 3% of the final area that will be mapped by the des; thetools and analysis techniques developed in this paper can be applied toforthcoming larger datasets from the survey.

1508.02381	digging deeper into the southern skies: a compact milky-way companion  discovered in first-year dark energy survey data	the dark energy survey (des) is a 5000 sq. degree survey in the southernhemisphere, which is rapidly reducing the existing north-south asymmetry in thecensus of mw satellites and other stellar substructure. we use the first-yeardes data down to previously unprobed photometric depths to search for stellarsystems in the galactic halo, therefore complementing the previous analysis ofthe same data carried out by our group earlier this year. our search is basedon a matched filter algorithm that produces stellar density maps consistentwith stellar population models of various ages, metallicities, and distancesover the survey area. the most conspicuous density peaks in these maps havebeen identified automatically and ranked according to their significance andrecurrence for different input models. we report the discovery of oneadditional stellar system besides those previously found by several authorsusing the same first-year des data. the object is compact, and consistent withbeing dominated by an old and metal-poor population. des j0034-4902 is found athigh significance and appears in the des images as a compact concentration offaint blue point sources at ~ 87 {kpc}. its half-light radius of r_h = 9.88 +/-4.31 {pc} and total luminosity of m_v ~ -3.05_{-0.42}^{+0.69} are consistentwith it being a low mass halo cluster. it is also found to have a veryelongated shape. in addition, our deeper probe of des 1st year data confirmsthe recently reported satellite galaxy candidate horologium ii as a significantstellar overdensity. we also infer its structural properties and compare themto those reported in the literature.

1508.03622	eight ultra-faint galaxy candidates discovered in year two of the dark  energy survey	we report the discovery of eight new ultra-faint dwarf galaxy candidates inthe second year of optical imaging data from the dark energy survey (des). sixof these candidates are detected at high confidence, while two lower-confidencecandidates are identified in regions of non-uniform survey coverage. the newstellar systems are found by three independent automated search techniques andare identified as overdensities of stars, consistent with the isochrone andluminosity function of an old and metal-poor simple stellar population. the newsystems are faint (mv &gt; -4.7 mag) and span a range of physical sizes (17 pc &lt;$r_{1/2}$ &lt; 181 pc) and heliocentric distances (25 kpc &lt; d &lt; 214 kpc). all ofthe new systems have central surface brightnesses consistent with knownultra-faint dwarf galaxies (\mu &lt; 27.5 mag arcsec$^{-2}$). roughly half of thedes candidates are more distant, less luminous, and/or have lower surfacebrightnesses than previously known milky way satellite galaxies. most of thecandidates are found in the southern part of the des footprint close to themagellanic clouds. we find that the des data alone exclude (p &lt; 0.001) aspatially isotropic distribution of milky way satellites and that the observeddistribution can be well, though not uniquely, described by an associationbetween several of the des satellites and the magellanic system. our modelpredicts that the full sky may hold ~100 ultra-faint galaxies with physicalproperties comparable to the des satellites and that 20-30% of these would bespatially associated with the magellanic clouds.

1509.07121	photometric redshifts and clustering of emission line galaxies selected  jointly by des and eboss	we present the results of the first test plates of the extended baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey. this paper focuses on the emission linegalaxies (elg) population targetted from the dark energy survey (des)photometry. we analyse the success rate, efficiency, redshift distribution, andclustering properties of the targets. from the 9000 spectroscopic redshiftstargetted, 4600 have been selected from the des photometry. the total successrate for redshifts between 0.6 and 1.2 is 71\% and 68\% respectively for abright and faint, on average more distant, samples including redshifts measuredfrom a single strong emission line. we find a mean redshift of 0.8 and 0.87,with 15 and 13\% of unknown redshifts respectively for the bright and faintsamples. in the redshift range 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.2, for the most secure spectroscopicredshifts, the mean redshift for the bright and faint sample is 0.85 and 0.9respectively. star contamination is lower than 2\%. we measure a galaxy biasaveraged on scales of 1 and 10~mpc/h of 1.72 \pm 0.1 for the bright sample andof 1.78 \pm 0.12 for the faint sample. the error on the galaxy bias have beenobtained propagating the errors in the correlation function to the fittedparameters. this redshift evolution for the galaxy bias is in agreement withtheoretical expectations for a galaxy population with mb-5\log h &lt; -21.0. wenote that biasing is derived from the galaxy clustering relative to a model forthe mass fluctuations. we investigate the quality of the des photometricredshifts and find that the outlier fraction can be reduced using a comparisonbetween template fitting and neural network, or using a random forestalgorithm.

astro-ph;0002500	detection of correlated galaxy ellipticities on cfht data: first  evidence for gravitational lensing by large-scale structures	we report the detection of a significant (5.5 sigma) excess of correlationsbetween galaxy ellipticities at scales ranging from 0.5 to 3.5 arc-minutes.this detection of a gravitational lensing signal by large-scale structure wasmade using a composite high quality imaging survey of 6300 arcmin^2 obtained atthe canada france hawaii telescope (cfht) with the uh8k and cfh12k panoramicccd cameras. the amplitude of the excess correlation is 2.2\pm 0.2 % at 1arcmin scale, in agreement with theoretical predictions of the lensing effectinduced by large-scale structure.we provide a quantitative analysis ofsystematics which could contribute to the signal and show that the net effectis small and can be corrected for. we show that the measured ellipticitycorrelations behave as expected for a gravitational shear signal. therelatively small size of our survey precludes tight constraints on cosmologicalmodels. however the data are in favor of cluster normalized cosmologicalmodels, and marginally reject cold dark matter models with (omega=0.3,sigma_8&lt;0.6) or (omega=1, sigma_8=1). the detection of cosmic sheardemonstrates the technical feasibility of using weak lensing surveys to measuredark matter clustering and the potential for cosmological parametermeasurements, in particular with upcoming wide field ccd cameras.

astro-ph;0101511	cosmic shear statistics and cosmology	we report a measurement of cosmic shear correlations using an effective areaof 6.5 sq. deg. of the virmos deep imaging survey in progress at thecanada-france-hawaii telescope. we measured various shear correlationfunctions, the aperture mass statistic and the top-hat smoothed variance of theshear with a detection significance exceeding 12 sigma for each of them. wepresent results on angular scales from 3 arc-seconds to half a degree. theconsistency of different statistical measures is demonstrated and confirms thelensing origin of the signal through tests that rely on the scalar nature ofthe gravitational potential. for cold dark matter models we find $\sigma_8\omega_0^{0.6}=0.43^{+0.04}_{-0.05}$ at the 95% confidence level. themeasurement over almost three decades of scale allows to discuss the effect ofthe shape of the power spectrum on the cosmological parameter estimation. thedegeneracy on sigma_8-omega_0 can be broken if priors on the shape of thelinear power spectrum (that can be parameterized by gamma) are assumed. forinstance, with gamma=0.21 and at the 95% confidence level, we obtain0.6&lt;sigma_8&lt;1.1 and 0.2&lt;omega_0&lt;0.5 for open models, and sigma_8&gt;0.65 andomega_0&lt;0.4 for flat (lambda-cdm) models. from the tangential/radial modesdecomposition we can set an upper limit on the intrinsic shape alignment, whichwas recently suggested as a possible contribution to the lensing signal. withinthe error bars, there is no detection of intrinsic shape alignment for scaleslarger than 1'.

astro-ph;0306254	the virmos deep imaging survey ii: cfh12k bvri optical data for the  0226-04 deep field	(abridged) in this paper we describe in detail the reduction, preparation andreliability of the photometric catalogues which comprise the 1.2 deg^2cfh12k-virmos deep field. the survey reaches a limiting magnitude of bab~26.5,vab~26.2, rab~25.9 iab~25.0 and contains 90,729 extended sources in themagnitude range 18.0&lt;iab&lt;24.0. we demonstrate our catalogues are free fromsystematic biases and are complete and reliable down these limits. we estimatethat the upper limit on bin-to-bin systematic photometric errors for the i-limited sample is ~10% in this magnitude range. we estimate that 68% of thecatalogues sources have absolute per co-ordinate astrometric uncertainties lessthan ~0.38" and ~0.32" (alpha,delta). our internal (filter-to-filter) perco-ordinate astrometric uncertainties are 0.08" and 0.08" (alpha,delta). wequantify the completeness of our survey in the joint space defined by objecttotal magnitude and peak surface brightness. finally, we present numerouscomparisons between our catalogues and published literature data: galaxy andstar counts, galaxy and stellar colours, and the clustering of both point-likeand extended populations. in all cases our measurements are in excellentagreement with literature data to iab&lt;24.0. this combination of depth and arealcoverage makes this multi-colour catalogue a solid foundation to selectgalaxies for follow-up spectroscopy with vimos on the eso-vlt and a uniquedatabase to study the formation and evolution of the faint galaxy population toz~1 and beyond.

astro-ph;0309305	momaf : the mock map facility	we present the mock map facility, a powerful tool to generate mock cataloguesor images from semi-analytically post-processed snapshots of cosmologicaln-body simulations. the paper describes in detail an efficient technique tocreate such mocks from the galics semi-analytic model, providing the readerwith an accurate quantification of the artifacts it introduces at every step.we show that replication effects introduce a negative bias on the clusteringsignal -- typically peaking at less than 10 percent around the correlationlength. we also thoroughly discuss how the clustering signal is affected byfinite volume effects, and show that it vanishes at scales larger than about atenth of the simulation box size. for the purpose of analysing our method, weshow that number counts and redshift distributions obtained with galics andmomaf compare well to k-band observations and to the 2dfgrs. given finitevolume effects, we also show that the model can reproduce the apm angularcorrelation function. the momaf results discussed here are made publiclyavailable to the astronomical community through a public database. moreover, auser-friendly web interface (http://galics.iap.fr) allows any user to recoverher/his own favourite galaxy samples through simple sql queries. theflexibility of this tool should permit a variety of uses ranging from extensivecomparisons between real observations and those predicted by hierarchicalmodels of galaxy formation, to the preparation of observing strategies for deepsurveys and tests of data processing pipelines.

astro-ph;0504394	spectral and morphological properties of quasar hosts in sph simulations  of agn feeding by mergers	we present a method for generating virtual observations fromsmoothed-particle-hydrodynamics (sph) simulations. this method includes stellarpopulation synthesis models and the reprocessing of starlight by dust toproduce realistic galaxy images. we apply this method and simulate the mergingof two identical giant sa galaxies. the merger remnant is an elliptical galaxy.the merger concentrates the gas content of the two galaxies into the nuclearregion. the gas that flows into the nuclear region refuels the central blackholes of the merging galaxies. we follow the refuelling of the black holesduring the merger semi-analytically.  in the simulation presented in this article, the black holes grow from 3 x10^7 to 1.8x 10^8 solar masses, with a peak agn luminosity of m_b ~ -23.7. westudy how the morphological and spectral properties of the system evolve duringthe merger and work out the predictions of this scenario for the properties ofhost galaxies during the active phase. the peak of agn activity coincides withthe merging of the two galactic nuclei and occurs at a stage when the remnantlooks like a lenticular galaxy. the simulation predicts the formation of acircumnuclear starburst ring/dusty torus with an opening angle of 30-40 degreesand made of clouds with n_h=10^24 cm^-2. the average optical depth of the torusis quite high, but the obscuring medium is patchy, so that there still existlines of sight where the agn is visible in a nearly edge-on view. for the samereason, there are lines of sight where the agn is completely obscured in theface-on view.

cond-mat;0408484	dynamic phase diagram of the number partitioning problem	we study the dynamic phase diagram of a spin model associated with the numberpartitioning problem, as a function of temperature and of the fraction $k/n$ ofspins allowed to flip simultaneously. the case k=1 reproduces the activatedbehavior of bouchaud's trap model, whereas the opposite limit $k=n$ can bemapped onto the entropic trap model proposed by barrat and m\'ezard. in theintermediate case $1 \ll k \ll n$, the dynamics corresponds to a modifiedversion of the barrat and m\'ezard model, which includes a slow (rather thaninstantaneous) decorrelation at each step. a transition from an activatedregime to an entropic one is observed at temperature $t_g/2$ in agreement withrecent work on this model. ergodicity breaking occurs for $t&lt;t_g/2$ in thethermodynamic limit, if $k/n \to 0$. in this temperature range, the modelexhibits a non trivial fluctuation-dissipation relation leading for $k \ll n$to a single effective temperature equal to $t_g/2$. these results give newinsights on the relevance and limitations of the picture proposed by simpletrap models.

0811.3326	photometric redshifts for the cfhtls t0004 deep and wide fields	we compute photometric redshifts based on the template-fitting method in thefourth public release of the canada-france-hawaii telescope legacy survey. thisunique multi-colour catalogue comprises u*,g',r',i',z' photometry in four deepfields of 1 deg2 each and 35 deg2 distributed over three wide fields. ourphotometric redshifts are calibrated with and compared to 16,983 high-qualityspectroscopic redshifts from several surveys. we find a dispersion of 0.028 andan outlier rate of 3.5% in the deep field at i'ab &lt; 24 and a dispersion of0.036 and an outlier rate of 2.8% in the wide field at i'ab &lt; 22.5. beyond i'ab= 22.5 in the wide field the number of outliers rises from 5% to 10% at i'ab&lt;23and i'ab&lt;24 respectively. for the wide sample, we find the systematic redshiftbias keeps below 1% to i'ab &lt; 22.5, whereas we find no significant bias in thedeep field. we investigated the effect of tile-to-tile photometric variationsand demonstrate that the accuracy of our photometric redshifts is reduced by atmost 21%. we separate stars from galaxies using both the size and colourinformation, reducing the contamination by stars in our catalogues from 50% to8% at i'ab &lt; 22.5 in fields with the highest stellar density while keeping acomplete galaxy sample. our cfhtls t0004 photometric redshifts are distributedto the community. our release include 592,891 (i'ab &lt; 22.5) and 244,701 (i'ab &lt;24) reliable galaxy photometric redshifts in the wide and deep fields,respectively.
