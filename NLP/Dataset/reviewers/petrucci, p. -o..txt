1004.2124	first detection of vhe gamma-rays from sn 1006 by h.e.s.s	recent theoretical predictions of the lowest very high energy (vhe)luminosity of sn 1006 are only a factor 5 below the previously publishedh.e.s.s. upper limit, thus motivating further in-depth observations of thissource. deep observations at vhe energies (above 100 gev) were carried out withthe high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) of cherenkov telescopes from2003 to 2008. more than 100 hours of data have been collected and subjected toan improved analysis procedure. observations resulted in the detection of vhegamma-rays from sn 1006. the measured gamma-ray spectrum is compatible with apower-law, the flux is of the order of 1% of that detected from the crabnebula, and is thus consistent with the previously established h.e.s.s. upperlimit. the source exhibits a bipolar morphology, which is strongly correlatedwith non-thermal x-rays. because the thickness of the vhe-shell is compatiblewith emission from a thin rim, particle acceleration in shock waves is likelyto be the origin of the gamma-ray signal. the measured flux level can beaccounted for by inverse compton emission, but a mixed scenario that includesleptonic and hadronic components and takes into account the ambient matterdensity inferred from observations also leads to a satisfactory description ofthe multi-wavelength spectrum.

(j2000) = -64d30m00s with a 2' statistical error in each coordinate,namely hess j1356-645. the source is extended, with an intrinsic gaussian widthof (0.20 +/- 0.02)deg. its integrated energy flux between 1 and 10 tev of 8e-12erg cm-2 s-1 represents ~ 11% of the crab nebula flux in the same energy band.the energy spectrum between 1 and 20 tev is well described by a power law dn/de~ e-gamma with photon index gamma = 2.2 +/- 0.2stat +/- 0.2sys. the inspectionof archival radio images at three frequencies and the analysis of x-ray datafrom rosat/pspc and xmm-newton/mos reveal the presence of faint non-thermaldiffuse emission coincident with hess j1356-645. hess j1356-645 is most likelyassociated with the young and energetic pulsar psr j1357-6429 (abridged)

1111.3331	simultaneous multi-wavelength campaign on pks 2005-489 in a high state	the high-frequency peaked bl lac object pks 2005-489 was the target of amulti-wavelength campaign with simultaneous observations in the tev gamma-ray(h.e.s.s.), gev gamma-ray (fermi/lat), x-ray (rxte, swift), uv (swift) andoptical (atom, swift) bands. this campaign was carried out during a high fluxstate in the synchrotron regime. the flux in the optical and x-ray bandsreached the level of the historical maxima. the hard gev spectrum observed withfermi/lat connects well to the very high energy (vhe, e&gt;100gev) spectrummeasured with h.e.s.s. with a peak energy between ~5 and 500 gev. compared toobservations with contemporaneous coverage in the vhe and x-ray bands in 2004,the x-ray flux was ~50 times higher during the 2009 campaign while the tevgamma-ray flux shows marginal variation over the years. the spectral energydistribution during this multi-wavelength campaign was fit by a one zonesynchrotron self-compton model with a well determined cutoff in x-rays. theparameters of a one zone ssc model are inconsistent with variability timescales. the variability behaviour over years with the large changes insynchrotron emission and small changes in the inverse compton emission does notwarrant an interpretation within a one-zone ssc model despite an apparentlysatisfying fit to the broadband data in 2009.

1201.4135	a multiwavelength view of the flaring state of pks 2155-304 in 2006	multiwavelength (mwl) observations of the blazar pks 2155-304 during twoweeks in july and august 2006, the period when two exceptional flares at veryhigh energies (vhe, e&gt;= 100 gev) occurred, provide a detailed picture of theevolution of its emission. the complete data set from this campaign ispresented, including observations in vhe gamma-rays (h.e.s.s.), x-rays (rxte,chandra, swift xrt), optical (swift uvot, bronberg, watcher, rotse), and in theradio band (nrt, hartrao, atca). optical and radio light curves from 2004 to2008 are compared to the available vhe data from this period, to put the 2006campaign into the context of the long-term evolution of the source. the x-rayand vhe gamma-ray emission are correlated during the observed high state of thesource, but show no direct connection with longer wavelengths. the long-termflux evolution in the optical and radio bands is found to be correlated andshows that the source reaches a high state at long wavelengths after theoccurrence of the vhe flares. spectral hardening is seen in the swift xrt data.the nightly averaged high-energy spectra of the non-flaring nights can bereproduced by a stationary one-zone ssc model, with only small variations inthe parameters. the spectral and flux evolution in the high-energy band duringthe night of the second vhe flare is modelled with multi-zone ssc models, whichcan provide relatively simple interpretations for the hour time-scale evolutionof the high-energy emission, even for such a complex data set. for the firsttime in this type of source, a clear indication is found for a relation betweenhigh activity at high energies and a long-term increase in the low frequencyfluxes.

1204.1964	discovery of vhe \gamma-ray emission and multi-wavelength observations  of the bl lac object 1rxs j101015.9-311909	1rxs j101015.9-311909 is a galaxy located at a redshift of z=0.14 hosting anactive nucleus belonging to the class of bright bl lac objects. observations athigh (he, e &gt; 100 mev) and very high (vhe, e &gt; 100 gev) energies provideinsights into the origin of very energetic particles present in such sourcesand the radiation processes at work. we report on results from vhe observationsperformed between 2006-10 with h.e.s.s. h.e.s.s. data have been analysed withenhanced analysis methods, making the detection of faint sources moresignificant. vhe emission at a position coincident with 1rxs j101015.9-311909is detected with h.e.s.s. for the first time. in a total good-quality livetimeof about 49 h, we measure 263 excess counts, corresponding to a significance of7.1\sigma. the photon spectrum above 0.2 tev can be described by a power-lawwith a photon index of \gamma\ = 3.08\pm0.42_{stat}\pm0.20_{sys}. the integralflux above 0.2 tev is about 0.8% of the flux of the crab nebula and shows nosignificant variability over the time reported. in addition, public fermi/latdata are analysed to search for high energy emission from the source. thefermi/lat he emission is significant at 8.3\sigma\ in the chosen 25-monthdataset. uv and x-ray contemporaneous observations with the swift satellite inmay 2007 are also reported, together with optical observations performed withthe atom telescope located at the h.e.s.s. site. swift observations reveal anabsorbed x-ray flux of f_{0.3-7 kev} = 1.04^{+0.04}_{-0.05} \times 10^{-11}erg.cm^{-2}.s^{-1} in the 0.3-7 kev range. finally, all the available data areused to study the source's multi-wavelength properties. the sed can bereproduced using a simple one-zone ssc model with emission from a region with adoppler factor of 30 and a magnetic field between 0.025 and 0.16 g. theseparameters are similar to those obtained for other sources of this type.

1204.5690	h.e.s.s. observations of the carina nebula and its enigmatic colliding  wind binary eta carinae	the massive binary system eta carinae and the surrounding hii complex, thecarina nebula, are potential particle acceleration sites from whichvery-high-energy (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) \gamma-ray emission could be expected. thispaper presents data collected during vhe \gamma-ray observations with theh.e.s.s. telescope array from 2004 to 2010, which cover a full orbit of etacarinae. in the 33.1-hour data set no hint of significant \gamma-ray emissionfrom eta carinae has been found and an upper limit on the \gamma-ray flux of7.7 x 10-13 ph cm-2 s-1 (99% confidence level) is derived above the energythreshold of 470 gev. together with the detection of high-energy (he; 0.1 gev &gt;e &gt; 100 gev) \gamma-ray emission by the fermi-lat up to 100 gev, and assuming acontinuation of the average he spectral index into the vhe domain, theseresults imply a cut-off in the \gamma-ray spectrum between the he and vhe\gamma-ray range. this could be caused either by a cut-off in the acceleratedparticle distribution or by severe \gamma-\gamma\ absorption losses in the windcollision region. furthermore, the search for extended \gamma-ray emission fromthe carina nebula resulted in an upper limit on the \gamma-ray flux of 4.2 x10-12 ph cm-2 s-1 (99% confidence level). the derived upper limit of ~23 on thecosmic-ray enhancement factor is compared with results found for the old-agemixed-morphology supernova remnant w 28.

1205.5485	spectral analysis and interpretation of the \gamma-ray emission from the  starburst galaxy ngc 253	very-high-energy (vhe; e &gt;100 gev) and high-energy (he; 100 mev &lt; e &lt; 100gev) data from \gamma-ray observations performed with the h.e.s.s. telescopearray and the fermi-lat instrument, respectively, are analysed in order toinvestigate the non-thermal processes in the starburst galaxy ngc 253. the vhe\gamma-ray data can be described by a power law in energy with differentialphoton index \gamma=2.14 \pm 0.18_stat \pm 0.30_sys and differential fluxnormalisation at 1 tev of f_0 = (9.6 \pm 1.5_stat (+5.7,-2.9)_sys) x 10^{-14}tev^{-1} cm^{-2} s^{-1}. a power-law fit to the differential he \gamma-rayspectrum reveals a photon index of \gamma=2.24 \pm 0.14_stat \pm 0.03_sys andan integral flux between 200 mev and 200 gev of f(0.2-200 gev) = (4.9 \pm1.0_stat \pm 0.3_sys) x 10^{-9} cm^{-2} s^{-1}. no evidence for a spectralbreak or turnover is found over the dynamic range of both the lat instrumentand the h.e.s.s. experiment: a combined fit of a power law to the he and vhe\gamma-ray data results in a differential photon index \gamma=2.34 \pm 0.03with a p-value of 30%. the \gamma-ray observations indicate that at least about20% of the energy of the cosmic rays capable of producing hadronic interactionsis channeled into pion production. the smooth alignment between the spectra inthe he and vhe \gamma-ray domain suggests that the same transport processesdominate in the entire energy range. advection is most likely responsible forcharged particle removal from the starburst nucleus from gev to multiple tevenergies. in a hadronic scenario for the \gamma-ray production, the singleoverall power-law spectrum observed would therefore correspond to the meanenergy spectrum produced by the ensemble of cosmic-ray sources in the starburstregion.

1208.1370	constraints on the gamma-ray emission from the cluster-scale agn  outburst in the hydra a galaxy cluster	in some galaxy clusters powerful agn have blown bubbles with cluster scaleextent into the ambient medium. the main pressure support of these bubbles isnot known to date, but cosmic rays are a viable possibility. for such ascenario copious gamma-ray emission is expected as a tracer of cosmic rays fromthese systems. hydra a, the closest galaxy cluster hosting a cluster scale agnoutburst, located at a redshift of 0.0538, is investigated for being agamma-ray emitter with the high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) array andthe fermi large area telescope (fermi-lat). data obtained in 20.2 hours ofdedicated h.e.s.s. observations and 38 months of fermi-lat data, gathered byits usual all-sky scanning mode, have been analyzed to search for a gamma-raysignal. no signal has been found in either data set. upper limits on thegamma-ray flux are derived and are compared to models. these are the firstlimits on gamma-ray emission ever presented for galaxy clusters hosting clusterscale agn outbursts. the non-detection of hydra a in gamma-rays has importantimplications on the particle populations and physical conditions inside thebubbles in this system. for the case of bubbles mainly supported by hadroniccosmic rays, the most favorable scenario, that involves full mixing betweencosmic rays and embedding medium, can be excluded. however, hadronic cosmicrays still remain a viable pressure support agent to sustain the bubblesagainst the thermal pressure of the ambient medium. the largest population ofhighly-energetic electrons which are relevant for inverse-compton gamma-rayproduction is found in the youngest inner lobes of hydra a. the limit on theinverse-compton gamma-ray flux excludes a magnetic field below half of theequipartition value of 16 mug in the inner lobes.

1210.1359	probing the extent of the non-thermal emission from the vela x region at  tev energies with h.e.s.s	vela x is a region of extended radio emission in the western part of the velaconstellation: one of the nearest pulsar wind nebulae (pwne), and associatedwith the energetic vela pulsar (psr b0833-45). extended very-high-energy (vhe)$\gamma$-ray emission (hess $\mathrm{j0835\mhyphen 455}$) was discovered usingthe h.e.s.s. experiment in 2004. the vhe $\gamma$-ray emission was found to becoincident with a region of x-ray emission discovered with ${\it rosat}$ above1.5 kev (the so-called \textit{vela x cocoon}): a filamentary structureextending southwest from the pulsar to the centre of vela x. a deeperobservation of the entire vela x nebula region, also including larger offsetsfrom the cocoon, has been performed with h.e.s.s. this re-observation wascarried out in order to probe the extent of the non-thermal emission from thevela x region at tev energies and to investigate its spectral properties. inorder to increase the sensitivity to the faint $\gamma$-ray emission from thevery extended vela x region, a multivariate analysis method combining threecomplementary reconstruction techniques of cherenkov-shower images is appliedfor the selection of $\gamma$-ray events. the analysis is performed with theon/off background method, which estimates the background from separateobservations pointing away from vela x; towards regions free of $\gamma$-raysources but with comparable observation conditions. the $\gamma$-ray surfacebrightness over the large vela x region reveals that the detection ofnon-thermal vhe $\gamma$-ray emission from the pwn hess $\mathrm{j0835\mhyphen455}$ is statistically significant over a region of radius 1.2$^{\circ}$ aroundthe position $\alpha$ = 08$^{\mathrm{h}}$ 35$^{\mathrm{m}}$ 00$^{\mathrm{s}}$,$\delta$ = -45$^{\circ}$ 36$^{\mathrm{\prime}}$00$^{\mathrm{\prime}\mathrm{\prime}}$ (j2000).

1301.1678	search for very-high-energy \gamma-ray emission from galactic globular  clusters with h.e.s.s	globular clusters (gcs) are established emitters of high-energy (he, 100mev&lt;e&lt;100 gev) \gamma-ray radiation which could originate from the cumulativeemission of the numerous millisecond pulsars (mspsrs) in the clusters' cores orfrom inverse compton (ic) scattering of relativistic leptons accelerated in thegc environment. these stellar clusters could also constitute a new class ofsources in the very-high-energy (vhe, e&gt;100 gev) \gamma-ray regime, judgingfrom the recent detection of a signal from the direction of terzan 5 with theh.e.s.s. telescope array.  we searched for point-like and extended vhe \gamma-ray emission from 15 gcsserendipitously covered by h.e.s.s observations and also performed a stackinganalysis combining the data from all gcs to investigate the hypothesis of apopulation of faint emitters. assuming ic emission as the origin of the vhe\gamma-ray signal from the direction of terzan 5, we calculated the expected\gamma-ray flux from each of the 15 gcs, based on their number of millisecondpulsars, their optical brightness and the energy density of background photonfields.  we did not detect significant vhe \gamma-ray emission from any of the 15 gcsin either of the two analyses. given the uncertainties related to the parameterdeterminations, the obtained flux upper limits allow to rule out the simpleic/mspsr scaling model for ngc 6388 and ngc 7078. the upper limits derived fromthe stacking analyses are factors between 2 and 50 below the flux predicted bythe simple leptonic scaling model, depending on the assumed source extent andthe dominant target photon fields. therefore, terzan 5 still remainsexceptional among all gcs, as the vhe \gamma-ray emission either arises fromextra-ordinarily efficient leptonic processes, or from a recent catastrophicevent, or is even unrelated to the gc itself.

1404.3863	multiwavelength campaign on mrk 509. xiii. testing ionized-reflection  models on mrk 509	active galactic nuclei (agn) are the most luminous persistent objects in theuniverse. an excess of x-ray emission below about 2 kev, called soft-excess, isvery common in type 1 agn spectra. the origin of this feature remains debated.originally modeled with a blackbody, there are now several possibilities tomodel the soft-excess, including warm comptonization and blurred ionizedreflection. in this paper, we test ionized-reflection models on mrk 509, abright seyfert 1 galaxy for which we have a unique data set, in order todetermine whether it can be responsible for the strong soft-excess. we use tensimultaneous xmm-newton and integral observations performed every four days. wepresent here the results of the spectral analysis, the evolution of theparameters and the variability properties of the x-ray emission. theapplication of blurred ionized-reflection models leads to a very strongreflection and an extreme geometry, but fails to reproduce the broad-bandspectrum of mrk 509. two different scenarios for blurred ionized reflection arediscussed: stable geometry and lamp-post configuration. in both cases we findthat the model parameters do not follow the expected relations, indicating thatthe model is fine-tuned to fit the data without physical justification. alarge, slow variation of the soft-excess without counterpart in the hard x-rayscould be explained by a change in ionization of the reflector. however, such achange does not naturally follow from the assumed geometrical configuration.warm comptonization remains the most probable origin of the soft-excess in thisobject. nevertheless, it is possible that both ionized reflection and warmcomptonization mechanisms can explain the soft-excess in all objects, onedominating the other one, depending on the physical conditions of the disk andthe corona.

1409.0253	long-term monitoring of pks 2155$-$304 with atom and h.e.s.s.:  investigation of optical/$\gamma$-ray correlations in different spectral  states	in this paper we report on the analysis of all the available optical and veryhigh-energy $\gamma$-ray ($&gt;$200 gev) data for the bl lac object pks2155$-$304, collected simultaneously with the atom and h.e.s.s. telescopes from2007 until 2009. this study also includes x-ray (rxte, swift) and high-energy$\gamma$-ray (fermi-lat) data. during the period analysed, the source wastransitioning from its flaring to quiescent optical states,and wascharacterized by only moderate flux changes at different wavelengths on thetimescales of days and months. a flattening of the optical continuum with anincreasing optical flux can be noted in the collected dataset, but onlyoccasionally and only at higher flux levels. we did not find any universalrelation between the very high-energy $\gamma$-ray and optical flux changes onthe timescales from days and weeks up to several years. on the other hand, wenoted that at higher flux levels the source can follow two distinct tracks inthe optical flux-colour diagrams, which seem to be related to distinct$\gamma$-ray states of the blazar. the obtained results therefore indicate acomplex scaling between the optical and $\gamma$-ray emission of pks2155$-$304, with different correlation patterns holding at different epochs,and a $\gamma$-ray flux depending on the combination of an optical flux andcolour rather than a flux alone.

1409.2021	multiwavelength campaign on mrk 509 xiv. chandra hetgs spectra	we present in this paper the results of a 270 ks chandra hetgs observation inthe context of a large multiwavelength campaign on the seyfert galaxy mrk 509.the hetgs spectrum allows us to study the high ionisation warm absorber and thefe-k complex in mrk 509. we search for variability in the spectral propertiesof the source with respect to previous observations in this campaign, as wellas for evidence of ultra-fast outflow signatures. the chandra hetgs x-rayspectrum of mrk 509 was analysed using the spex fitting package. we confirm thebasic structure of the warm absorber found in the 600 ks xmm-newton rgsobservation observed three years earlier, consisting of five distinctionisation components in a multikinematic regime. we find little or novariability in the physical properties of the different warm absorber phaseswith respect to previous observations in this campaign, except for component d2which has a higher column density at the expense of component c2 at the sameoutflow velocity (-240 km/s). contrary to prior reports we find no -700 km/soutflow component. the o viii absorption line profiles show an average coveringfactor of 0.81 +/- 0.08 for outflow velocities faster than -100 km/s, similarto those measured in the uv. this supports the idea of a patchy wind. therelative metal abundances in the outflow are close to proto-solar. the narrowcomponent of the fe kalpha emission line shows no changes with respect toprevious observations which confirms its origin in distant matter. the narrowline has a red wing that can be interpreted to be a weak relativistic emissionline. we find no significant evidence of ultra-fast outflows in our newspectrum down to the sensitivity limit of our data.

1411.0572	discovery of the vhe gamma-ray source hess j1832-093 in the vicinity of  snr g22.7-0.2	the region around the supernova remnant (snr) w41 contains several tevsources and has prompted the h.e.s.s. collaboration to perform deepobservations of this field of view. this resulted in the discovery of the newvery high energy (vhe) source hess j1832-093, at the position $\rm ra=18^h 32^m50^s \pm 3^s_{stat} \pm 2^s_{syst}, \rm dec=-9^\circ 22' 36'' \pm 32''_{stat}\pm 20''_{syst} (j2000)$, spatially coincident with a part of the radio shellof the neighboring remnant g22.7-0.2. the photon spectrum is well described bya power-law of index $\gamma = 2.6 \pm 0.3_{\rm stat} \pm 0.1_{\rm syst}$ and anormalization at 1 tev of $\phi_0=(4.8 \pm 0.8_{\rm stat}\pm 1.0_{\rmsyst})\,\times\,10^{-13}\,\rm{cm} ^{-2}\,s^{-1}\,tev^{-1}$. the location of thegamma-ray emission on the edge of the snr rim first suggested a signature ofescaping cosmic-rays illuminating a nearby molecular cloud. then a dedicatedxmm-newton observation led to the discovery of a new x-ray point sourcespatially coincident with the tev excess. two other scenarios were henceproposed to identify the nature of hess j1832-093. gamma-rays from inversecompton radiation in the framework of a pulsar wind nebula scenario or thepossibility of gamma-ray production within a binary system are therefore alsoconsidered. deeper multi-wavelength observations will help to shed new light onthis intriguing vhe source.

1411.7568	diffuse galactic gamma-ray emission with h.e.s.s	diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission is the most prominent observable signature ofcelestial cosmic-ray interactions at high energies. while already beinginvestigated at gev energies over several decades, assessments of diffuse$\gamma$-ray emission at tev energies remain sparse. after completion of thesystematic survey of the inner galaxy, the h.e.s.s. experiment is in a primeposition to observe large-scale diffuse emission at tev energies. data of theh.e.s.s. galactic plane survey are investigated in regions off known$\gamma$-ray sources. corresponding $\gamma$-ray flux measurements were madeover an extensive grid of celestial locations. longitudinal and latitudinalprofiles of the observed $\gamma$-ray fluxes show characteristic excessemission not attributable to known $\gamma$-ray sources. for the first timelarge-scale $\gamma$-ray emission along the galactic plane using imagingatmospheric cherenkov telescopes has been observed. while the backgroundsubtraction technique limits the ability to recover modest variation on thescale of the h.e.s.s. field of view or larger, which is characteristic of theinverse compton scatter-induced galactic diffuse emission, contributions ofneutral pion decay as well as emission from unresolved $\gamma$-ray sources canbe recovered in the observed signal to a large fraction. calculations show thatthe minimum $\gamma$-ray emission from $\pi^0$-decay represents a significantcontribution to the total signal. this detection is interpreted as a mix ofdiffuse galactic $\gamma$-ray emission and unresolved sources.

1412.2251	h.e.s.s. detection of tev emission from the interaction region between  the supernova remnant g349.7+0.2 and a molecular cloud	g349.7+0.2 is a young galactic supernova remnant (snr) located at thedistance of 11.5 kpc and observed across the entire electromagnetic spectrumfrom radio to high energy (he) gamma-rays. radio and infrared observationsindicate that the remnant is interacting with a molecular cloud. in this paper,the detection of very high energy (vhe) gamma-ray emission coincident with thissnr with the high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) is reported. anintegral flux f(e&gt;400gev)=(6.5 +-1.1stat +-1.3syst) x 10^{-13} ph/cm/scorresponding to 0.7% of that of the crab nebula and to a luminosity of 10^34erg/s above the same energy threshold, and a steep photon index gamma_vhe = 2.8+-0.27stat +-0.20syst are measured. the analysis of more than 5 yr of fermi-latdata towards this source shows a power-law like spectrum with a best-fit photonindex gamma_he = 2.2 +-0.04stat +0.13-0.31syst. the combined gamma-ray spectrumof g349.7+0.2 can be described by either a broken power-law (bpl) or apower-law with exponential (or sub-exponential) cutoff (plc). in the formercase, the photon break energy is found at e_br,gamma = 55 +70-30 gev, slightlyhigher than what is usually observed in the he/vhe gamma-ray emittingmiddle-aged snrs known to be interacting with molecular clouds. in the lattercase, the exponential (respectively sub-exponential) cutoff energy is measuredat e_cut,gamma = 1.4 +1.6-0.55 (respectively 0.35 +0.75-0.21) tev. a pion-decayprocess resulting from the interaction of the accelerated protons and nucleiwith the dense surrounding medium is clearly the preferred scenario to explainthe gamma-ray emission. the bpl with a spectral steepening of 0.5-1 and the plcprovide equally good fits to the data. the product of the average gas densityand the total energy content of accelerated protons and nuclei amounts to nh wp~ 5 x 10^51 erg/cm3.

1412.6997	h.e.s.s. reveals a lack of tev emission from the supernova remnant  puppis a	puppis a is an interesting ~4 kyr-old supernova remnant (snr) that showsstrong evidence of interaction between the forward shock and a molecular cloud.it has been studied in detail from radio frequencies to high-energy (he,0.1-100 gev) gamma-rays. an analysis of the fermi-lat data has shown anextended he gamma-ray emission with a 0.2-100 gev spectrum exhibiting nosignificant deviation from a power law, unlike most of the gev-emitting snrsknown to be interacting with molecular clouds. this makes it a promising targetfor imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes (iacts) to probe the gamma-rayemission above 100 gev. very-high-energy (vhe, e &gt;= 0.1 tev) gamma-ray emissionfrom puppis a is for the first time searched for with the high energystereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.). the analysis of the h.e.s.s. data does notreveal any significant emission towards puppis a. the derived upper limits onthe differential photon flux imply that its broadband gamma-ray spectrum mustexhibit a spectral break or cutoff. by combining fermi-lat and h.e.s.s.measurements, the 99% confidence level upper limits on such a cutoff are foundto be 450 and 280 gev, assuming a power law with a simple exponential and asub-exponential cutoff, respectively. it is concluded that none of the standardlimitations (age, size, radiative losses) on the particle accelerationmechanism, assumed to be still on-going at present, can explain the lack of vhesignal. the scenario in which particle acceleration has ceased some time ago isconsidered as an alternative explanation. the he/vhe spectrum of puppis a couldthen exhibit a break of non-radiative origin, (as observed in several otherinteracting snrs, albeit at somewhat higher energies) owing to the interactionwith dense and neutral material in particular towards the northeastern region.

1501.01188	anatomy of the agn in ngc 5548: i. a global model for the broadband  spectral energy distribution	an extensive multi-satellite campaign on ngc 5548 has revealed thisarchetypal seyfert-1 galaxy to be in an exceptional state of persistent heavyabsorption. our observations taken in 2013-2014 with xmm-newton, swift, nustar,integral, chandra, hst and two ground-based observatories have together enabledus to establish that this unexpected phenomenon is caused by an outflowingstream of weakly ionised gas (called the obscurer), extending from the vicinityof the accretion disk to the broad-line region. in this work we present thedetails of our campaign and the data obtained by all the observatories. wedetermine the spectral energy distribution of ngc 5548 from near-infrared tohard x-rays by establishing the contribution of various emission and absorptionprocesses taking place along our line of sight towards the central engine. wethus uncover the intrinsic emission and produce a broadband continuum model forboth obscured (average summer 2013 data) and unobscured ($&lt;$ 2011) epochs ofngc 5548. our results suggest that the intrinsic nir/optical/uv continuum is asingle comptonised component with its higher energy tail creating the 'softx-ray excess'. this component is compatible with emission from a warm,optically-thick corona as part of the inner accretion disk. we then investigatethe effects of the continuum on the ionisation balance and thermal stability ofphotoionised gas for unobscured and obscured epochs.

1504.03160	the existence of warm and optically thick dissipative coronae above  accretion disks	in the past years, several observations of agn and x-ray binaries havesuggested the existence of a warm t around 0.5-1 kev and optically thick, \tau~ 10-20, corona covering the inner parts of the accretion disk. theseproperties are directly derived from spectral fitting in uv to soft-x-raysusing comptonization models. however, whether such a medium can be both inradiative and hydrostatic equilibrium with an accretion disk is stilluncertain. we investigate the properties of such warm, optically thick coronaeand put constraints on their existence. we solve the radiative transferequation for grey atmosphere analytically in a pure scattering medium,including local dissipation as an additional heating term in the warm corona.the temperature profile of the warm corona is calculated assuming it is cooledby compton scattering, with the underlying dissipative disk providing photonsto the corona. our analytic calculations show that a dissipative thick,(\tau_{cor} ~ 10-12) corona on the top of a standard accretion disk can reachtemperatures of the order of 0.5-1 kev in its upper layers provided that thedisk is passive. but, in absence of strong magnetic fields, the requirement ofa compton cooled corona in hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical directionsets an upper limit on the thomson optical depth \tau_{cor} &lt; 5 . we show thisvalue cannot be exceeded independently of the accretion disk parameters.however, magnetic pressure can extend this result to larger optical depths.namely, a dissipative corona might have an optical depth up to ~ 20 when themagnetic pressure is 100 times higher that the gas pressure. the observation ofwarm coronae with thomson depth larger than ~ 5 puts tights constraints on thephysics of the accretion disk/corona systems and requires either strongmagnetic fields or vertical outflows to stabilize the system.

astro-ph;0406553	integral and xmm-newton spectral studies of ngc 4388	we present first integral and xmm-newton observations of a seyfert galaxy,the type 2 agn ngc 4388. several integral observations performed in 2003 allowus to study the spectrum in the 20 - 300 kev range. in addition two xmm-newtonobservations give detailed insight into the 0.2 - 10 kev emission. themeasurements presented here and comparison with previous observations bybepposax, sigma and cgro/osse show that the overall spectrum from soft x-raysup to the gamma-rays can be described by a highly absorbed (n_h = 2.7e231/cm^2) and variable non-thermal component in addition to constant non-absorbedthermal emission (t = 0.8 kev) of low abundance (7% solar), plus a constant fek-alpha and k-beta line. the hard x-ray component is well described by a simplepower law with a mean photon index of 1.7. during the integral observations the20 - 100 kev flux increased by a factor of 1.4. the analysis of xmm-newton dataimplies that the emission below 3 kev is decoupled from the agn and probablydue to extended emission as seen in chandra observations. the constant ironline emission is apparently also decoupled from the direct emission of thecentral engine and likely to be generated in the obscuring material, e.g. inthe molecular torus.

0810.3774	the efficient low-mass seyfert mcg-05-23-016	the seyfert 1.9 galaxy mcg-05-23-016 has been shown to exhibit a complexx-ray spectrum. this source has moderate x-ray luminosity, hosts a comparablylow-mass black hole, but accretes at a high eddington rate, and allows us tostudy a super massive black hole in an early stage. three observations of theintegral satellite simultaneous with pointed swift/xrt observations performedfrom december 2006 to june 2007 are used in combination with public data fromthe integral archive to study the variability of the hard x-ray components andto generate a high-quality spectrum from 1 to 150 kev. the agn shows littlevariability in the hard x-ray spectrum, with some indication of a variation inthe high-energy cut-off energy ranging from 50 kev to &gt;&gt;100 kev, with anelectron plasma temperature in the 10 - 90 kev range. the reflection componentis not evident and, if present, the reflected fraction can be constrained to r&lt; 0.3 for the combined data set. comparison to previous observations shows thatthe reflection component has to be variable. no variability in the uv andoptical range is observed on a time scale of 1.5 years. the hard x-ray spectrumof mcg-05-23-016 appears to be stable with the luminosity and underlying powerlaw varying moderately and the optical/uv flux staying constant. the spectralenergy distribution appears to be similar to that of galactic black holesystems, e.g. xte 1118+480 in the low state. the agn exhibits a remarkably higheddington ratio of l(bol)/l(edd)&gt; 0.8 (or l(bol)/l(edd) &gt; 0.1, if we consider ahigher mass of the central engine) and, at the same time, a low cut-off energyaround 70 kev. objects like mcg-05-23-016 might indicate the early stages ofsuper massive black holes, in which a strong accretion flow feeds the centralengine.
