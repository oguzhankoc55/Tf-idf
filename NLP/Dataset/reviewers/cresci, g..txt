0902.2398	lsd: lyman-break galaxies stellar populations and dynamics. i: mass,  metallicity and gas at z~3.1	we present the first results of a project, lsd, aimed at obtainingspatially-resolved, near-infrared spectroscopy of a complete sample oflyman-break galaxies at z~3. deep observations with adaptive optics resulted inthe detection of the main optical lines, such as [oii], hbeta and [oiii], whichare used to study sizes, sfrs, morphologies, gas-phase metallicities, gasfractions and effective yields. optical, near-ir and spitzer/irac photometry isused to measure stellar mass. we obtain that morphologies are usually complex,with the presence of several peaks of emissions and companions that are notdetected in broad-band images. typical metallicities are 10-50% solar, with astrong evolution of the mass-metallicity relation from lower redshifts. stellarmasses, gas fraction, and evolutionary stages vary significantly among thegalaxies, with less massive galaxies showing larger fractions of gas. incontrast with observations in the local universe, effective yields decreasewith stellar mass and reach solar values at the low-mass end of the sample.this effect can be reproduced by gas infall with rates of the order of thesfrs. outflows are present but are not needed to explain the mass-metallicityrelation. we conclude that a large fraction of these galaxies are activelycreating stars after major episodes of gas infall or merging.

0902.4701	the sins survey: modeling the dynamics of z~2 galaxies and the high-z  tully-fisher relation	we present the modeling of sinfoni integral field dynamics of 18 star forminggalaxies at z ~ 2 from halpha line emission. the galaxies are selected from thelarger sample of the sins survey, based on the prominence of ordered rotationalmotions with respect to more complex merger induced dynamics. the quality ofthe data allows us to carefully select systems with kinematics dominated byrotation, and to model the gas dynamics across the whole galaxy using suitableexponential disk models. we obtain a good correlation between the dynamicalmass and the stellar mass, finding that large gas fractions mgas~m*) arerequired to explain the difference between the two quantities. we use thederived stellar mass and maximum rotational velocity vmax from the modeling toconstruct for the first time the stellar mass tully-fisher relation at z ~ 2.2.the relation obtained shows a slope similar to what is observed at lowerredshift, but we detect an evolution of the zero point. we find that at z ~ 2.2there is an offset in log(m*) for a given rotational velocity of 0.41+-0.11with respect to the local universe. this result is consistent with thepredictions of the latest n-body/hydrodynamical simulations of disk formationand evolution, which invoke gas accretion onto the forming disk in filamentsand cooling flows. this scenario is in agreement with other dynamical evidencefrom sins, where gas accretion from the halo is required to reproduce theobserved properties of a large fraction of the z ~ 2 galaxies.

0903.1872	the sins survey: sinfoni integral field spectroscopy of z ~ 2  star-forming galaxies	we present the sins survey with sinfoni of high redshift galaxies. with 80objects observed and 63 detected, sins is the largest survey of spatiallyresolved gas kinematics, morphologies, and physical properties of star-forminggalaxies at z~1-3. we describe the selection of the targets, the observations,and the data reduction. we then focus on the "sins halpha sample" of 62rest-uv/optically-selected sources at 1.3&lt;z&lt;2.6 for which we targeted primarilythe halpha and [nii] emission lines. only 30% of this sample had previousnear-ir spectroscopic observations. as a whole, the sins halpha sample covers areasonable representation of massive log(m*/msun)&gt;~10 star-forming galaxies atz~1.5-2.5, with some bias towards bluer systems compared to pure k-selectedsamples due to the requirement of secure optical redshift. the sample spans twoorders of magnitude in stellar mass and in absolute and specific star formationrates, with median values of approximately log(m*/msun) = 10.5, 70 msun/yr, and3/gyr. the ionized gas distribution and kinematics are spatially resolved onscales ranging from 1.5 kpc for adaptive optics assisted observations totypically 4-5 kpc for seeing-limited data. the halpha morphologies tend to beirregular and/or clumpy. about one-third are rotation-dominated yet turbulentdisks, another third comprises compact and velocity dispersion-dominatedobjects, and the remaining galaxies are clear interacting/merging systems; thefraction of rotation-dominated systems increases among the more massive part ofthe sample. the halpha luminosities and equivalent widths suggest on averageroughly twice higher dust attenuation towards the hii regions relative to thebulk of the stars, and comparable current and past-averaged star formationrates.

0706.2656	dynamical properties of z~2 star forming galaxies and a universal star  formation relation	we present the first comparison of the dynamical properties of differentsamples of z~1.4-3.4 star forming galaxies from spatially resolved imagingspectroscopy from sinfoni/vlt integral field spectroscopy and iram comillimeter interferometry. our samples include 16 rest-frame uv-selected, 16rest-frame optically-selected and 13 submillimeter galaxies (smgs). we findthat restframe uv- and optically bright (k&lt;20) z~2 star forming galaxies aredynamically similar, and follow the same velocity-size relation as diskgalaxies at z~0. in the theoretical framework of rotating disks forming fromdissipative collapse in dark matter halos, the two samples require a spinparameter ranging from 0.06 to 0.2. in contrast bright smgs have largervelocity widths and are much more compact. hence, smgs have lower angularmomenta and higher matter densities than either of the uv- or opticallyselected populations. this indicates that dissipative major mergers maydominate the smgs population, resulting in early spheroids, and that themajority of uv/optically bright galaxies have evolved less violently [...].these early disks may later evolve into spheroids via disk instabilities ormergers. because of their small sizes and large densities, smgs lie at the highsurface density end of a universal (out to z=2.5) "schmidt-kennicutt" relationbetween gas surface density and star formation rate surface density with aslope of ~1.7.

0907.4777	high-redshift star-forming galaxies: angular momentum and baryon  fraction, turbulent pressure effects and the origin of turbulence	the structure of a sample of high-redshift (z=2), rotating galaxies with highstar formation rates and turbulent gas velocities of sigma=40-80 km/s isinvestigated. fitting the observed disk rotational velocities and radii with amo, mao, white (1998) (mmw) model requires unusually large disk spin parameterslambda_d&gt;0.1 and disk-to-dark halo mass fraction m_d=0.2, close to the cosmicbaryon fraction. the galaxies segregate into dispersion-dominated systems with1&lt;vmax/sigma&lt;3, maximum rotational velocities vmax&lt;200 km/s and disk half-lightradii rd=1-3 kpc and rotation-dominated systems with vmax&gt;200 km/s,vmax/sigma&gt;3 and rd=4-8 kpc. for the dispersion-dominated sample, radialpressure gradients partly compensate the gravitational force, reducing therotational velocities. including this pressure effect in the mmw model,dispersion-dominated galaxies can be fitted well with spin parameters lflambda_d=0.03-0.05 for high disk mass fractions of m_d=0.2 and withlambda_d=0.01-0.03 for m_d=0.05. these values are in good agreement withcosmological expectations. for the rotation-dominated sample however pressureeffects are small and better agreement with theoretically expected disk spinparameters can only be achieved if the dark halo mass contribution in thevisible disk regime (2-3*rd) is smaller than predicted by the mmw model. weargue that these galaxies can still be embedded in standard cold dark matterhalos if the halos did not contract adiabatically in response to diskformation. it is shown that the observed high turbulent gas motions of thegalaxies are consistent with a toomre instability parameter q=1 which is equalto the critical value, expected for gravitational disk instability to be themajor driver of turbulence. the dominant energy source of turbulence is thenthe potential energy of the gas in the disk.

0912.1858	the impact of cold gas accretion above a mass floor on galaxy scaling  relations	using the cosmological baryonic accretion rate and normal star formationefficiencies, we present a very simple model for star-forming galaxies (sfgs)that accounts for the mass and redshift dependencies of the sfr-mass andtully-fisher relations from z=2 to the present. the time evolution follows fromthe fact that each modelled galaxy approaches a steady state where the sfrfollows the (net) cold gas accretion rate. the key feature of the model is ahalo mass floor m_{min}~10^{11} below which accretion is quenched in order tosimultaneously account for the observed slopes of the sfr-mass andtully-fischer relations. the same successes cannot be achieved via astar-formation threshold (or delay) nor by varying the sf efficiency or thefeedback efficiency. combined with the mass ceiling for cold accretion due tovirial shock heating, the mass floor m_{min} explains galaxy "downsizing",where more massive galaxies formed earlier and over a shorter period of time.it turns out that the model also accounts for the observed galactic baryon andgas fractions as a function of mass and time, and the cosmic sfr density fromz~6 to z=0, which are all resulting from the mass floor m_{min}. the modelhelps to understand that it is the cosmological decline of accretion rate thatdrives the decrease of cosmic sfr density between z~2 and z=0 and the rise ofthe cosmic sfr density allows us to put a constraint on our main parameterm_{min}~10^{11} solar masses. among the physical mechanisms that could beresponsible for the mass floor, we view that photo-ionization feedback (fromfirst in-situ hot stars) lowering the cooling efficiency is likely to play alarge role.

1005.0006	a fundamental relation between mass, sfr and metallicity in local and  high redshift galaxies	we show that the mass-metallicity relation observed in the local universe isdue to a more general relation between stellar mass m*, gas-phase metallicityand sfr. local galaxies define a tight surface in this 3d space, thefundamental metallicity relation (fmr), with a small residual dispersion of~0.05 dex in metallicity, i.e, ~12%. at low stellar mass, metallicity decreasessharply with increasing sfr, while at high stellar mass, metallicity does notdepend on sfr. high redshift galaxies, up to z~2.5 are found to follow the samefmr defined by local sdss galaxies, with no indication of evolution. theevolution of the mass-metallicity relation observed up to z=2.5 is due to thefact that galaxies with progressively higher sfrs, and therefore lowermetallicities, are selected at increasing redshifts, sampling different partsof the same fmr. by introducing the new quantity mu_alpha=log(m*)-alphalog(sfr), with alpha=0.32, we define a projection of the fmr that minimizes themetallicity scatter of local galaxies. the same quantity also cancels out anyredshift evolution up to z~2.5, i.e, all galaxies have the same range of valuesof mu_0.32. at z&gt;2.5, evolution of about 0.6 dex off the fmr is observed, withhigh-redshift galaxies showing lower metallicities. the existence of the fmrcan be explained by the interplay of infall of pristine gas and outflow ofenriched material. the former effect is responsible for the dependence ofmetallicity with sfr and is the dominant effect at high-redshift, while thelatter introduces the dependence on stellar mass and dominates at low redshift.the combination of these two effects, together with the schmidt-kennicutt law,explains the shape of the fmr and the role of mu_0.32. the small metallicityscatter around the fmr supports the smooth infall scenario of gas accretion inthe local universe.

1007.4180	dynamical properties of amaze and lsd galaxies from gas kinematics and  the tully-fisher relation at z~3	we present a sinfoni integral field kinematical study of 33 galaxies at z~3from the amaze and lsd projects which are aimed at studying metallicity anddynamics of high-redshift galaxies. the number of galaxies analyzed in thispaper constitutes a significant improvement compared to existing data in theliterature and this is the first time that a dynamical analysis is obtained fora relatively large sample of galaxies at z~3. 11 galaxies show orderedrotational motions (~30% of the sample), in these cases we estimate dynamicalmasses by modeling the gas kinematics with rotating disks and exponential massdistributions. we find dynamical masses in the range 2 \times 10^9 m\odot - 2\times 10^11 m\odot with a mean value of ~ 2 \times 10^10 m\odot. by comparingobserved gas velocity dispersion with that expected from models, we find thatmost rotating objects are dynamically "hot", with intrinsic velocitydispersions of the order of ~90 km s-1. the median value of the ratio betweenthe maximum disk rotational velocity and the intrinsic velocity dispersion forthe rotating objects is 1.6, much lower than observed in local galaxies value(~10) and slightly lower than the z~2 value (2 - 4). finally we use the maximumrotational velocity from our modeling to build a baryonic tully-fisher relationat z~3. our measurements indicate that z~3 galaxies have lower stellar masses(by a factor of ten on average) compared to local galaxies with the samedynamical mass. however, the large observed scatter suggests that thetully-fisher relation is not yet "in place" at these early cosmic ages,possibly due to the young age of galaxies. a smaller dispersion of thetuly-fisher relation is obtained by taking into account the velocity dispersionwith the use of the s_0.5 indicator, suggesting that turbulent motions mighthave an important dynamical role.

1010.2534	gas accretion as the origin of chemical abundance gradients in distant  galaxies	it has recently been suggested that galaxies in the early universe can growthrough the accretion of cold gas, and that this may have been the main driverof star formation and stellar mass growth. because the cold gas is essentiallyprimordial, it has a very low abundance of elements heavier than helium(metallicity). as it is funneled to the centre of a galaxy, it will lead thecentral gas having an overall lower metallicity than gas further from thecentre, because the gas further out has been enriched by supernovae and stellarwinds, and not diluted by the primordial gas. here we report chemicalabundances across three rotationally-supported star-forming galaxies at z~3,only 2 gyr after the big bang. we find an 'inverse' gradient, with the central,star forming regions having a lower metallicity than less active ones, oppositeto what is seen in local galaxies. we conclude that the central gas has beendiluted by the accretion of primordial gas, as predicted by 'cold flow' models.

1011.0264	galaxy metallicity near and far	metallicity appears to be one the most important tool to study formation andevolution of galaxies. recently, we have shown that metallicity of localgalaxies is tightly related not only to stellar mass, but also to starformation rate (sfr). at low stellar mass, metallicity decreases sharply withincreasing sfr, while at high stellar mass, metallicity does not depend on sfr.the residual metallicity dispersion across this fundamental metallicityrelation (fmr) is very small, about 0.05dex. high redshift galaxies, up toz~2.5, are found to follow the same fmr defined by local sdss galaxies, with noindication of evolution. at z&gt;2.5, evolution of about 0.6dex off the fmr isobserved, with high-redshift galaxies showing lower metallicities. this resultcan be combined with our recent discover of metallicity gradients in three highredshift galaxies showing disk dynamics. in these galaxies, the regions withhigher sfr also show lower metallicities. both these evidences can be explainedby the effect of smooth infall of gas into previously enriched galaxies, withthe star-formation activity triggered by the infalling gas.

1011.5360	the sins survey of z~2 galaxy kinematics: properties of the giant star  forming clumps	we have studied the properties of giant star forming clumps in five z~2star-forming disks with deep sinfoni ao spectroscopy at the eso vlt. the clumpsreside in disk regions where the toomre q-parameter is below unity, consistentwith their being bound and having formed from gravitational instability. broadh{\alpha}/[nii] line wings demonstrate that the clumps are launching sites ofpowerful outflows. the inferred outflow rates are comparable to or exceed thestar formation rates, in one case by a factor of eight. typical clumps may losea fraction of their original gas by feedback in a few hundred million years,allowing them to migrate into the center. the most active clumps may lose muchof their mass and disrupt in the disk. the clumps leave a modest imprint on thegas kinematics. velocity gradients across the clumps are 10-40 km/s/kpc,similar to the galactic rotation gradients. given beam smearing and clumpsizes, these gradients may be consistent with significant rotational support intypical clumps. extreme clumps may not be rotationally supported; either theyare not virialized, or they are predominantly pressure supported. the velocitydispersion is spatially rather constant and increases only weakly with starformation surface density. the large velocity dispersions may be driven by therelease of gravitational energy, either at the outer disk/accreting streamsinterface, and/or by the clump migration within the disk. spatial variations inthe inferred gas phase oxygen abundance are broadly consistent with inside-outgrowing disks, and/or with inward migration of the clumps.

1104.0248	constraints on the assembly and dynamics of galaxies. ii. properties of  kiloparsec-scale clumps in rest-frame optical emission of z ~ 2 star-forming  galaxies	we study the properties of luminous stellar clumps identified in deep, highresolution hst/nic2 f160w imaging at 1.6um of six z~2 star-forming galaxieswith existing near-ir integral field spectroscopy from sinfoni at the vlt.individual clumps contribute ~0.5%-15% of the galaxy-integrated rest-frame~5000a emission, with median of about 2%; the total contribution of clump lightranges from 10%-25%. the median intrinsic clump size and stellar mass are ~1kpcand log(mstar[msun])~9, in the ranges for clumps identified in rest-uv or lineemission in other studies. the clump sizes and masses in the subset of disksare broadly consistent with expectations for clump formation via gravitationalinstabilities in gas-rich, turbulent disks given the host galaxies' globalproperties. by combining the nic2 data with acs/f814w imaging available for onesource, and ao-assisted sinfoni halpha data for another, we infer modest color,m/l, and stellar age variations within each galaxy. in these two objects, setsof clumps identified at different wavelengths do not fully overlap;nic2-identified clumps tend to be redder/older than acs- or halpha-identifiedclumps without rest-frame optical counterparts. there is evidence for asystematic trend of older ages at smaller galactocentric radii among theclumps, consistent with scenarios where inward migration of clumps transportsmaterial towards the central regions. from constraints on a bulge-likecomponent at radii &lt;1-3kpc, none of the five disks in our sample appears tocontain a compact massive stellar core, and we do not discern a trend of bulgestellar mass fraction with stellar age of the galaxy. further observations arenecessary to probe the build-up of stellar bulges and the role of clumps inthis process.

1108.0285	how well can we measure the intrinsic velocity dispersion of distant  disk galaxies?	the kinematics of distant galaxies, from z=0.1 to z&gt;2, play a key role in ourunderstanding of galaxy evolution from early times to the present. one of theimportant parameters is the intrinsic, or local, velocity dispersion of agalaxy, which allows one to quantify the degree of non-circular motions such aspressure support. however, this is difficult to measure because the observeddispersion includes the effects of (often severe) beam smearing on the velocitygradient. here we investigate four methods of measuring the dispersion thathave been used in the literature, to assess their effectiveness at recoveringthe intrinsic dispersion. we discuss the biasses inherent in each method, andapply them to model disk galaxies in order to determine which methods yieldmeaningful quantities, and under what conditions. all the mean weighteddispersion estimators are affected by (residual) beam smearing. in contrast,the dispersion recovered by fitting a spatially and spectrally convolved diskmodel to the data is unbiassed by the beam smearing it is trying to compensate.because of this, and because the bias it does exhibit depends only on thesignal-to-noise, it can be considered reliable. however, at very lowsignal-to-noise, all methods should be used with caution.

1108.1057	a dynamical mass estimator for high z galaxies based on  spectroastrometry	galaxy dynamical masses are important physical quantities to constrain galaxyevolutionary models, especially at high redshifts. however, at z~2 the limitedsignal to noise ratio and spatial resolution of the data usually do not allowspatially resolved kinematical modeling and very often only virial masses canbe estimated from line widths. but even such estimates require a good knowledgeof galaxy size, which may be smaller than the spatial resolution.spectroastrometry is a technique which combines spatial and spectral resolutionto probe spatial scales significantly smaller than the spatial resolution ofthe observations. here we apply it to the case of high-z galaxies and present amethod based on spectroastrometry to estimate dynamical masses of high zgalaxies, which overcomes the problem of size determination with poor spatialresolution. we construct and calibrate a "spectroastrometric" virial massestimator, modifying the "classical" virial mass formula. we apply our methodto the [o iii] or h{\alpha} emission line detected in z~2-3 galaxies fromamaze, lsd and sins samples and we compare the spectroastrometric estimatorwith dynamical mass values resulting from full spatially resolved kinematicalmodeling. the spectroastrometric estimator is found to be a good approximationof dynamical masses, presenting a linear relation with a residual dispersion ofonly 0.15 dex. this is a big improvement compared to the "classical" virialmass estimator which has a non linear relation and much larger dispersion (0.47dex) compared to dynamical masses. by applying our calibrated estimator to 16galaxies from the amaze and lsd samples, we obtain masses in the ~10^7-10^10m\odot range extending the mass range attainable with dynamical modeling.

1112.3071	observational evidence of quasar feedback quenching star formation at  high redshift	most galaxy evolutionary models require quasar feedback to regulate starformation in their host galaxies. in particular, at high redshift, modelsexpect that feedback associated with quasar-driven outflows is so efficientthat the gas in the host galaxy is largely swept away or heated up, hencesuppressing star formation in massive galaxies. we observationally investigatethis phenomenon by using vlt-sinfoni integral field spectroscopy of theluminous quasar 2qzj002830.4-281706 at z=2.4. the spectra sample the opticalemission lines redshifted into the near-ir. the [oiii]5007 emission-linekinematics map reveals a massive outflow on scales of several kpc. thedetection of narrow halpha emission reveals star formation in the quasar hostgalaxy, with sfr=100 msun/yr. however, the star formation is not distributeduniformly, but is strongly suppressed in the region with the highest outflowvelocity and highest velocity dispersion. this result indicates that starformation in this region is strongly quenched by the quasar outflow, which iscleaning the galaxy disk of its molecular gas. this is one of the first directobservational proofs of quasar feedback quenching the star formation at highredshift.

1304.4940	a fundamental relation between the metallicity, gas content, and stellar  mass of local galaxies	recent results have suggested that the well known mass-metallicity relationhas a strong dependence on the star formation rate, to the extent that a threedimensional `fundamental metallicity relation' exists which links the threeparameters with minimal scatter. in this work, we use a sample of 4253 localgalaxies observed in atomic hydrogen from the alfalfa survey to demonstrate,for the first time, that a similar fundamental relation (the hi-fmr) alsoexists between stellar mass, gas-phase metallicity, and hi mass. this latterrelation is likely more fundamental, driving the relation between metallicity,sfr and mass. at intermediate masses, the behaviour of the gas fundamentalmetallicity relation is very similar to that expressed via the star formationrate. however, we find that the dependence of metallicity on hi contentpersists to the highest stellar masses, in contrast to the `saturation' ofmetallicity with sfr. it is interesting to note that the dispersion of therelation is very low at intermediate stellar masses (9&lt; log(m*/msun) &lt;11),suggesting that in this range galaxies evolve smoothy, in an equilibriumbetween gas inflow, outflow and star formation. at high and low stellar masses,the scatter of the relation is significantly higher, suggesting that mergingevents and/or stochastic accretion and star formation may drive galaxiesoutside the relation. we also assemble a sample of galaxies observed in co.however, due to a small sample size, strong selection bias, and the influenceof a metallicity-dependent co/h2 conversion factor, the data are insufficientto test any influence of molecular gas on metallicity.

1308.5113	strongly star-forming rotating disks in a complex merging system at z =  4,7 as revealed by alma	we performed a kinematical analysis of the [cii] line emission of the br1202-0725 system at z~4,7 using alma observations. the most prominent sourcesof this system are a quasar and a submillimeter galaxy, separated by aprojected distance of about 24 kpc and characterized by very high sfr, higherthan 1000 msun/yr. however, the alma observations reveal that these galaxiesapparently have undisturbed rotating disks, which is at variance with thecommonly accepted scenario in which strong star formation activity is inducedby a major merger. we also detected faint components which, after spectraldeblending, were spatially resolved from the main qso and smg emissions. therelative velocities and positions of these components are compatible withorbital motions within the gravitational potentials generated by the qso hostgalaxy and the smg, suggesting that they are smaller galaxies in interaction orgas clouds in accretion flows of tidal streams. we did not find any clearspectral evidence for outflows caused by agn or stellar feedback. this suggeststhat the high star formation rates might be induced by interactions or minormergers with these companions, which do not affect the large-scale kinematicsof the disks, however. our kinematical analysis also indicates that the qso andthe smg have similar mdyn, mostly in the form of molecular gas, and that theqso host galaxy and the smg are seen close to face-on with slightly differentdisk inclinations: the qso host galaxy is seen almost face-on (i~15), while thesmg is seen at higher inclinations (i~25). finally, the ratio between the blackhole mass of the qso, obtained from xshooter spectroscopy, and the mdyn of thehost galaxy is similar to value found in very massive local galaxies,suggesting that the evolution of black hole galaxy relations is probably betterstudied with dynamical than with stellar host galaxy masses.

1310.3838	the sins/zc-sinf survey of z~2 galaxy kinematics: evidence for  gravitational quenching	as part of the sins/zc-sinf surveys of high-z galaxy kinematics, we derivethe radial distributions of h-alpha surface brightness, stellar mass surfacedensity, and dynamical mass at ~2 kpc resolution in 19 z~2 star-forming diskswith deep sinfoni ao spectroscopy at the eso vlt. from these data we infer theradial distribution of the toomre q-parameter for these main-sequence starforming galaxies (sfgs), covering almost two decades of stellar mass (10^9.6 to10^11.5 solar masses). in more than half of our sfgs, the h-alpha distributionscannot be fit by a centrally peaked distribution, such as an exponential, butare better described by a ring, or the combination of a ring and anexponential. at the same time the kinematic data indicate the presence of amass distribution more centrally concentrated than a single exponentialdistribution for 5 of the 19 galaxies. the resulting q-distributions arecentrally peaked for all, and significantly exceed unity there for threequarters of the sfgs. the occurrence of h-alpha rings and of large nuclearq-values is strongly correlated, and is more common for the more massive sfgs.while our sample is small and there remain substantial uncertainties andcaveats, our observations are consistent with a scenario in which cloudfragmentation and global star formation are secularly suppressed in gas richhigh-z disks from the inside out, as the central stellar mass density of thedisks grows.

1311.2596	the sins/zc-sinf survey of z~2 galaxy kinematics: evidence for powerful  agn-driven nuclear outflows in massive star-forming galaxies	we report the detection of ubiquitous powerful nuclear outflows in massive (&gt;10^11 msun) z~2 star-forming galaxies (sfgs), which are plausibly driven by anactive galactic nucleus (agn). the sample consists of the eight most massivesfgs from our sins/zc-sinf survey of galaxy kinematics with the imagingspectrometer sinfoni, six of which have sensitive high-resolution adaptiveoptics (ao) assisted observations. all of the objects are disks hosting asignificant stellar bulge. the spectra in their central regions exhibit a broadcomponent in halpha and forbidden [nii] and [sii] line emission, with typicalvelocity fwhm ~ 1500 km/s, [nii]/halpha ratio ~ 0.6, and intrinsic extent of 2- 3 kpc. these properties are consistent with warm ionized gas outflowsassociated with type 2 agn, the presence of which is confirmed via independentdiagnostics in half the galaxies. the data imply a median ionized gas massoutflow rate of ~ 60 msun/yr and mass loading of ~ 3. at larger radii, a weakerbroad component is detected but with lower fwhm ~ 485 km/s and [nii]/halpha ~0.35, characteristic for star formation-driven outflows as found in thelower-mass sins/zc-sinf galaxies. the high inferred mass outflow rates andfrequent occurrence suggest the nuclear outflows efficiently expel gas out ofthe centers of the galaxies with high duty cycles, and may thus contribute tothe process of star formation quenching in massive galaxies. larger samples athigh masses will be crucial to confirm the importance and energetics of thenuclear outflow phenomenon, and its connection to agn activity and bulgegrowth.

1311.3670	the evolution of the dust and gas content in galaxies	we use deep herschel pacs and spire observations in goodss, goodsn and cosmosto estimate the average dust mass (mdust) of galaxies on a redshift-stellarmass (mstar)-sfr grid. we study the scaling relations between mdust, mstar andsfr at z&lt;=2.5. no clear evolution of mdust is observed at fixed sfr and mstar.we find a tight correlation between sfr and mdust, likely a consequence of theschmidt-kennicutt (s-k) law. the mstar-mdust correlation observed by previousworks flattens or sometimes disappears when fixing the sfr. most of it likelyderives from the combination of the mdust-sfr and mstar-sfr correlations. wethen investigate the gas content as inferred by converting mdust by assumingthat the dust/gas ratio scales linearly with the gas metallicity. all galaxiesin the sample follow, within uncertainties, the same sfr-mgas relation(integrated s-k law), which broadly agrees with co-based results for the bulkof the population, despite the completely different approaches. the majority ofgalaxies at z~2 form stars with an efficiency (sfe=sfr/mgas) ~5 times higherthan at z~0. it is not clear what fraction of such variation is an intrinsicredshift evolution and what fraction arises from selection effects. the gasfraction (fgas) decreases with mstar and increases with sfr, and does notevolve with z at fixed mstar and sfr. we explain these trends by introducing auniversal relation between fgas, mstar and sfr, non-evolving out to z~2.5.galaxies move across this relation as their gas content evolves in time. we usethe 3d fundamental fgas-mstar-sfr relation and the redshift evolution of themain sequence to estimate the evolution of fgas in the average population ofgalaxies as a function of z and mstar, and we find evidence a downsizingscenario.

1311.4576	metallicity evolution, metallicity gradients and gas fractions at z~3.4	we used near-infrared integral field spectroscopic observations from theamaze and lsd programs to constrain the metallicity in a sample of 40 starforming galaxies at 3&lt;z&lt;5 (most of which at z~3.4). we measure metallicities byexploiting strong emission line diagnostics. we found that a significantfraction of star-forming galaxies at z~3.4 deviate from the fundamentalmetallicity relation (fmr), with a metallicity up to a factor of ten lower thanexpected according to the fmr. this deviation does not correlate with thedynamical properties of the galaxy or with the presence of interactions. toinvestigate the origin of the metallicity deviations in more detail, we alsoinfer information on the gas content, by inverting the schmidt-kennicuttrelation. in agreement with recent co observational data, we found that, incontrast with the steeply rising trend at 0&lt;z&lt;2, the gas fraction in massivegalaxies remains constant, with indication of a marginal decline, at 2&lt;z&lt;3.5.when combined with the metallicity information, we infer that to explain boththe low metallicity and gas content in z~3.4 galaxies, both prominent outflowsand massive pristine gas inflows are needed. in ten galaxies we can alsospatially resolve the metallicity distribution. we found that the metallicitygenerally anticorrelates with the distribution of star formation and with thegas surface density. we discuss these findings in terms of pristine gas inflowstowards the center, and outflows of metal rich gas from the center toward theexternal regions.

0802.0879	kinemetry of sins high-redshift star-forming galaxies: distinguishing  rotating disks from major mergers	we present a simple set of kinematic criteria that can distinguish betweengalaxies dominated by ordered rotational motion and those involved in majormerger events. our criteria are based on the dynamics of the warm ionized gas(as traced by h-alpha) within galaxies, making this analysis accessible tohigh-redshift systems, whose kinematics are primarily traceable throughemission features. using the method of kinemetry (developed by krajnovic andco-workers), we quantify asymmetries in both the velocity and velocitydispersion maps of the warm gas, and the resulting criteria enable us toempirically differentiate between non-merging and merging systems at highredshift. we apply these criteria to 11 of our best-studied rest-frameuv/optical-selected z~2 galaxies for which we have near infrared integral fieldspectroscopic data from sinfoni on the vlt. of these 11 systems, we find that&gt;50% have kinematics consistent with a single rotating disk interpretation,while the remaining systems are more likely undergoing major mergers. thisresult, combined with the short formation timescales of these systems, providesevidence that rapid, smooth accretion of gas plays a significant role in galaxyformation at high redshift.

1312.1248	alma reveals a warm and compact starburst around a heavily obscured  supermassive black hole at z=4.75	we report alma cycle 0 observations at 1.3mm of less j033229.4-275619(xid403), an ultraluminous infrared galaxy at $z=4.75$ in the chandra deepfield south hosting a compton-thick qso. the source is not resolved in our dataat a resolution of $\sim$0.75 arcsec, placing an upper-limit of 2.5 kpc to thehalf-light radius of the continuum emission from heated-dust. afterdeconvolving for the beam size, however, we found a $\sim3\sigma$ indication ofan intrinsic source size of $0.27\pm0.08$ arcsec (gaussian fwhm), which wouldcorrespond to $r_{half}\sim0.9\pm0.3$ kpc. we build the far-ir sed of xid403 bycombining datapoints from both alma and herschel and fit it with a modifiedblackbody spectrum. for the first time, we measure the dust temperature$t_d=58.5\pm5.3$ k in this system, which is comparable to what has beenobserved in other high-z submillimeter galaxies. the measured star formationrate is sfr=$1020\pm150$ $m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, in agreement with previousestimates at lower s/n. based on the measured sfr and source size, we constrainthe sfr surface density to be $\sigma_{sfr}&gt;26\;m_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$($\sim200\;m_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$ for $r_{half}\sim0.9$ kpc). thecompactness of this starburst is comparable to what has been observed in otherlocal and high-z starburst galaxies. if the gas mass measured from previous[cii] and co(2-1) observations at low resolution is confined within the samedust region, assuming $r_{half}\sim0.9\pm0.3$ kpc, this would produce a columndensity of $n_h\sim0.3-1.1\times10^{24}$cm$^{-2}$ towards the central smbh,similar to the column density of $\approx1.4\times10^{24}$cm$^{-2}$ measuredfrom the x-rays. then, in principle, if both gas and dust were confined onsub-kpc scales, this would be sufficient to produce the observed x-ray columndensity without any need of a pc-scale absorber [abridged].

1401.4503	tracing the cosmic growth of super massive black holes to z ~ 3 with  herschel	we study a sample of herschel-pacs selected galaxies within the goods-southand the cosmos fields in the framework of the pacs evolutionary probe (pep)project. starting from the rich multi-wavelength photometric data-setsavailable in both fields, we perform a broad-band spectral energy distribution(sed) decomposition to disentangle the possible active galactic nucleus (agn)contribution from that related to the host galaxy. we find that 37 per cent ofthe herschel-selected sample shows signatures of nuclear activity at the 99 percent confidence level. the probability to reveal agn activity increases forbright ($l_{\rm 1-1000} &gt; 10^{11} \rm l_{\odot}$) star-forming galaxies at$z&gt;0.3$, becoming about 80 per cent for the brightest ($l_{\rm 1-1000} &gt;10^{12} \rm l_{\odot}$) infrared (ir) galaxies at $z \geq 1$. finally, wereconstruct the agn bolometric luminosity function and the super-massive blackhole growth rate across cosmic time up to $z \sim 3$ from a far-infrared (fir)perspective. this work shows general agreement with most of the panchromaticestimates from the literature, with the global black hole growth peaking at $z\sim 2$ and reproducing the observed local black hole mass density withconsistent values of the radiative efficiency $\epsilon_{\rm rad}$($\sim$0.07).

1405.3664	dynamics and metallicity of far-ir selected galaxies	we present near-infrared integral field spectroscopy of ten herschel selectedgalaxies at z~1.5. from detailed mapping of the h$\alpha$ and [nii] emissionlines we trace the dynamics, star formation rates, metallicities and alsoinvestigate gas fractions for these galaxies. for a few galaxies thedistribution of star formation as traced by h$\alpha$ only traces a smallfraction of the stellar disc, which could be tracing recent minor mergingevents. the rest-frame ultraviolet (uv) continuum emission often has adistribution completely different from h$\alpha$, which warns about the use ofuv-sed based star formation tracers in these systems. our analysis of galaxydynamics shows that minor dynamical disruptions (e.g. minor merging) aregenerally not enough to cause a deviation from the established 'main sequence'relation. most galaxies are found to follow the fundamental metallicityrelation (fmr), although with large scatter. one galaxy, (a small satellitegalaxy of a massive companion) is found to deviate strongly from the fmr. thisdeviation is in nice agreement with the correlation recently discovered inlocal galaxies between gas metallicity and environment, which has been ascribedto enriched inter-galactic medium (igm) in dense environments, and thereforesuggests that here the igm was already significantly enriched by z~1.5.

1406.1189	a multiwavelength consensus on the main sequence of star-forming  galaxies at z~2	we compare various star formation rate (sfr) indicators for star-forminggalaxies at $1.4&lt;z&lt;2.5$ in the cosmos field. the main focus is on the sfrs fromthe far-ir (pacs-herschel data) with those from the ultraviolet, for galaxiesselected according to the bzk criterion. fir-selected samples lead to a vastlydifferent slope of the sfr-stellar mass ($m_*$) relation, compared to that ofthe dominant main sequence population as measured from the uv, since the firselection picks predominantly only a minority of outliers. however, there isoverall agreement between the main sequences derived with the two sfrindicators, when stacking on the pacs maps the bzk-selected galaxies. theresulting logarithmic slope of the sfr-{$m_*$} relation is $\sim0.8-0.9$, inagreement with that derived from the dust-corrected uv-luminosity. exploitingdeeper 24$\mu$m-spitzer data we have characterized a sub-sample of galaxieswith reddening and sfrs poorly constrained, as they are very faint in the $b$band. the combination of herschel with spitzer data have allowed us to largelybreak the age/reddening degeneracy for these intriguing sources, bydistinguishing whether a galaxy is very red in b-z because of being heavilydust reddened, or whether because star formation has been (or is being)quenched. finally, we have compared our sfr(uv) to the sfrs derived by stackingthe radio data and to those derived from the h$\alpha$ luminosity of a sampleof star-forming galaxies at $1.4&lt;z&lt;1.7$. the two sets of sfrs are broadlyconsistent as they are with the sfrs derived from the uv and by stacking thecorresponding pacs data in various mass bins.

1407.3047	trade-off study for high resolution spectroscopy in the near infrared  with elt telescopes: seeing-limited vs. diffraction limited instruments	hires, a high resolution spectrometer, is one of the first five instrumentsforeseen in the eso roadmap for the e-elt. this spectrograph should ideallyprovide full spectral coverage from the uv limit to 2.5 microns, with aresolving power from r$\sim$10,000 to r$\sim$100,000. at visual/bluewavelengths, where the adaptive optics (ao) cannot provide an efficientlight-concentration, hires will necessarily be a bulky, seeing-limitedinstrument. the fundamental question, which we address in this paper, iswhether the same approach should be adopted in the near-infrared range, orhires should only be equipped with compact infrared module(s) with a muchsmaller aperture, taking advantage of an ao-correction. the main drawbacks of aseeing-limited instrument at all wavelengths are: \textit{i)} lowersensitivities at wavelengths dominated by thermal background (red part of thek-band). \textit{ii)} much higher volumes and costs for the ir spectrographmodule(s). the main drawbacks of using smaller, ao-fed ir module(s) are:\textit{i)} performances rapidly degrading towards shorter wavelengths(especially j e y bands). \textit{ii)} different spatial sampling of extendedobjects (the optical module see a much larger area on the sky). in this paperwe perform a trade-off analysis and quantify the various effects thatcontribute to improve or deteriorate the signal to noise ratio. in particular,we evaluate the position of the cross-over wavelength at which ao-fedinstruments starts to outperform seeing-limited instruments. this parameter isof paramount importance for the design of the part of hires covering thek-band.

1410.5468	galaxy-wide outflows in z$\sim$1.5 luminous obscured qsos revealed  through nir slit-resolved spectroscopy	aims. the co-evolution of galaxies and super massive black holes (smbhs)requires that some sort of feedback mechanism is operating during the activegalactic nuclei (agn) phases. agn driven winds are the most likely candidatesfor such feedback mechanism, but direct observational evidence of theirexistence and of their effects on the host galaxies are still scarce and theirphysical origin is still hotly debated.  methods. x-shooter observations of a sample of x-ray selected, obscuredquasars at z$\sim$1.5, selected on the basis of their observed red colors andx-ray-to-optical flux ratio, have shown the presence of outflowing ionized gasidentified by broad [oiii] emission lines in 6 out of 8 objects, confirming theefficiency of the selection criteria. here we present slit-resolvedspectroscopy for the two brightest sources, xid2028 and xid5321, to study thecomplex emission and absorption line kinematics.  results. we detect outflow extended out to $\sim$ 10 kpc from the centralblack hole (bh), both as blueshifted and redshifted emission. interestingly, wealso detect kpc scale outflows in the [oii] emission lines and in the neutralgas component, traced by the sodium d and magnesium absorption lines,confirming that a substantial amount of the outflowing mass is in the form ofneutral gas.  conclusions. the measured gas velocities and the outflow kinetic powers,inferred under reasonable assumptions on the geometry and physical propertiesof these two systems, favor an agn origin for the observed winds.

1411.4208	blowin' in the wind: both `negative' and `positive' feedback in an  obscured high-z quasar	quasar feedback in the form of powerful outflows is invoked as a keymechanism to quench star formation in galaxies, preventing massive galaxies toover-grow and producing the red colors of ellipticals. on the other hand, somemodels are also requiring `positive' agn feedback, inducing star formation inthe host galaxy through enhanced gas pressure in the interstellar medium.however, finding observational evidence of the effects of both types offeedback is still one of the main challenges of extragalactic astronomy, as fewobservations of energetic and extended radiatively-driven winds are available.here we present sinfoni near infrared integral field spectroscopy of xid2028,an obscured, radio-quiet z=1.59 qso detected in the xmm-cosmos survey, in whichwe clearly resolve a fast (1500 km/s) and extended (up to 13 kpc from the blackhole) outflow in the [oiii] lines emitting gas, whose large velocity andoutflow rate are not sustainable by star formation only. the narrow componentof ha emission and the rest frame u band flux from hst-acs imaging enable tomap the current star formation in the host galaxy: both tracers independentlyshow that the outflow position lies in the center of an empty cavity surroundedby star forming regions on its edge. the outflow is therefore removing the gasfrom the host galaxy (`negative feedback'), but also triggering star formationby outflow induced pressure at the edges (`positive feedback'). xid2028represents the first example of a host galaxy showing both types of feedbacksimultaneously at work.

1503.01783	evidence for feedback in action from the molecular gas content in the  z~1.6 outflowing qso xid2028	gas outflows are believed to play a pivotal role in shaping galaxies, as theyregulate both star formation and black hole growth. despite their ubiquitouspresence, the origin and the acceleration mechanism of such powerful andextended winds is not yet understood. direct observations of the cold gascomponent in objects with detected outflows at other wavelengths are needed toassess the impact of the outflow on the host galaxy interstellar medium (ism).we observed with the plateau de bure interferometer an obscured quasar atz~1.5, xid2028, for which the presence of an ionised outflow has beenunambiguously signalled by nir spectroscopy. the detection of co(3-2) emissionin this source allows us to infer the molecular gas content and compare it tothe ism mass derived from the dust emission. we then analyze the results in thecontext of recent insights on scaling relations, which describe the gas contentof the overall population of star-forming galaxies at a similar redshifts. thestar formation efficiency (~100) and gas mass (m_gas=2.1-9.5x10^{10} m_sun)inferred from the co(3-2) line depend on the underlying assumptions on theexcitation of the transition and the co-to-h2 conversion factor. however, thecombination of this information and the ism mass estimated from the dust masssuggests that the ism/gas content of xid2028 is significantly lower thanexpected for its observed m$_\star$, ssfr and redshift, based on the mostup-to-date calibrations (with gas fraction &lt;20% and depletion time scale &lt;340myr). overall, the constraints we obtain from the far infrared and millimeterdata suggest that we are observing qso feedback able to remove the gas from thehost

1506.03096	ionised outflows in z $\sim$ 2.4 quasar host galaxies	agn-driven outflows are invoked by galaxy evolutionary models to quench starformation and to explain the origin of the relations observed locally betweensuper massive black holes and their host galaxies. this work aims to detect thepresence of extended ionised outflows in luminous quasars where we expect themaximum activity both in star formation and in black hole accretion. currently,there are only a few studies based on spatially resolved observations ofoutflows at high redshift, $z&gt;2$. we analyse a sample of six luminous (${\rml&gt;10^{47} \ erg/s}$) quasars at $z\sim2.4$, observed in h-band using thenear-ir integral field spectrometer sinfoni at vlt. we perform a kinematicanalysis of the [oiii] emission line at $\lambda = 5007\aa$. [oiii] has acomplex gas kinematic, with blue-shifted velocities of a few hundreds of km/sand line widths up to 1500 km/s. using the spectroastrometric method we infersize of the ionised outflows of up to $\sim$2 kpc. the properties of theionised outflows, mass outflow rate, momentum rate and kinetic power, arecorrelated with the agn luminosity. the increase in outflow rate withincreasing agn luminosity is consistent with the idea that a luminous agnpushes away the surrounding gas through fast outflows driven by radiationpressure, which depends on the emitted luminosity. we derive mass outflow ratesof about 6-700 m$_{\odot}$/yr for our sample, which are lower than thoseobserved in molecular outflows. indeed physical properties of ionised outflowsshow dependences on agn luminosity which are similar to those of molecularoutflows but indicating that the mass of ionised gas is smaller than that ofthe molecular one. alternatively, this discrepancy between ionised andmolecular outflows could be explained with different acceleration mechanisms.

1508.04464	the magnum survey: positive feedback in the nuclear region of ngc 5643  suggested by muse	we study the ionization and kinematics of the ionized gas in the nuclearregion of the barred seyfert 2 galaxy ngc~5643 using muse integral fieldobservations in the framework of the magnum (measuring active galactic nucleiunder muse microscope) survey. the data were used to identify regions withdifferent ionization conditions and to map the gas density and the dustextinction. we find evidence for a double sided ionization cone, possiblycollimated by a dusty structure surrounding the nucleus. at the center of theionization cone, outflowing ionized gas is revealed as a blueshifted,asymmetric wing of the [oiii] emission line, up to projected velocityv(10)~-450 km/s. the outflow is also seen as a diffuse, low luminosity radioand x-ray jet, with similar extension. the outflowing material points in thedirection of two clumps characterized by prominent line emission with spectratypical of hii regions, located at the edge of the dust lane of the bar. wepropose that the star formation in the clumps is due to `positive feedback'induced by gas compression by the nuclear outflow, providing the firstcandidate for outflow induced star formation in a seyfert-like radio quiet agn.this suggests that positive feedback may be a relevant mechanism in shaping theblack hole-host galaxy coevolution.

1508.07884	sinfoni spectra of heavily obscured agns in cosmos: evidence of outflows  in a mir/o target at z$\sim2.5$	we present new data for four candidate obscured compton-thick (ct) quasars atz $\sim$1-2.5 observed with sinfoni vlt spectrograph in ao mode. these sourceswere selected from a 24$\mu$m spitzer mips survey of the cosmos field, on thebasis of red mid-infrared-to-optical and optical-to-near-infrared colours, withthe intention of identifying active galactic nuclei (agns) in dust enshroudedenvironments, where most of the black hole mass is assembled in dust enshroudedenvironments. near infrared spectra were analyzed in order to check foremission line features and to search for broad components in the[oiii]-h$\beta$ and h$\alpha$-[nii] regions. x-ray spectral analysis, radio andmir diagnostics, and sed fitting have also been employed to study the nature ofthe sources. we successfully identified three objects for which we had only aphotometric redshift estimate. based on their emission line diagnostics and onancillary multi-wavelength constraints, we find that all four targets harborobscured agns. broad profiles that could be attributed to the effects ofoutflows are revealed in only one target, miro20581. in particular, we clearlyresolved a fast ($\sim$1600 km/s) and extended ($\sim$5 kpc) outflow in the[oiii]5007 emission line. this feature, the commonly used indicator for ionisedoutflowing gas, was sampled and detected only for this target; hence, we cannot exclude the presence of outflows in the other sources. overall, theconstraints we obtain from our targets and from other comparative samples fromthe literature suggest that these optically faint luminous infrared galaxies,hosting obscured agns, may represent a brief evolutionary phase between thepost-merger starburst and the unobscured qso phases.

0807.1184	from rings to bulges: evidence for rapid secular galaxy evolution at z~2  from integral field spectroscopy in the sins survey	we present ha integral field spectroscopy of well resolved, uv/opticallyselected z~2 star-forming galaxies as part of the sins survey with sinfoni onthe eso vlt. our laser guide star adaptive optics and good seeing data show thepresence of turbulent rotating star forming rings/disks, plus centralbulge/inner disk components, whose mass fractions relative to total dynamicalmass appears to scale with [nii]/ha flux ratio and star formation age. wepropose that the buildup of the central disks and bulges of massive galaxies atz~2 can be driven by the early secular evolution of gas-rich proto-disks. highredshift disks exhibit large random motions. this turbulence may in part bestirred up by the release of gravitational energy in the rapid cold accretionflows along the filaments of the cosmic web. as a result dynamical friction andviscous processes proceed on a time scale of &lt;1 gyr, at least an order ofmagnitude faster than in z~0 disk galaxies. early secular evolution thus drivesgas and stars into the central regions and can build up exponential disks andmassive bulges, even without major mergers. secular evolution along withincreased efficiency of star formation at high surface densities may also helpto account for the short time scales of the stellar buildup observed in massivegalaxies at z~2.

0808.0194	mergers and mass accretion rates in galaxy assembly: the millennium  simulation compared to observations of z~2 galaxies	recent observations of uv-/optically selected, massive star forming galaxiesat z~2 indicate that the baryonic mass assembly and star formation history isdominated by continuous rapid accretion of gas and internal secular evolution,rather than by major mergers. we use the millennium simulation to build newhalo merger trees, and extract halo merger fractions and mass accretion rates.we find that even for halos not undergoing major mergers the mass accretionrates are plausibly sufficient to account for the high star formation ratesobserved in z~2 disks. on the other hand, the fraction of major mergers in themillennium simulation is sufficient to account for the number counts ofsubmillimeter galaxies (smgs), in support of observational evidence that theseare major mergers. when following the fate of these two populations in themillennium simulation to z=0, we find that subsequent mergers are not frequentenough to convert all z~2 turbulent disks into elliptical galaxies at z=0.similarly, mergers cannot transform the compact smgs/red sequence galaxies atz~2 into observed massive cluster ellipticals at z=0. we argue therefore, thatsecular and internal evolution must play an important role in the evolution ofa significant fraction of z~2 uv-/optically and submillimeter selected galaxypopulations.

astro-ph;0302323	the infrared supernova rate in starburst galaxies	we report the results of our ongoing search for extincted supernovae (sne) atnear-infrared wavelengths. we have monitored at 2.2 micron a sample of 46luminous infrared galaxies and detected 4 sne. the number of detections isstill small but sufficient to provide the first estimate of supernova rate atnear-infrared wavelengths. we measure a sn rate ofv 7.6+/-3.8 snu which is anorder of magnitude larger than observed in quiescent galaxies. on the otherhand, the observed near-infrared rate is still a factor 3-10 smaller than thatestimated from the far-infrared luminosity of the galaxies. among variouspossibilities, the most likely scenario is that dust extinction is so high(av&gt;30) to obscure most sne even in the near-ir.  the role of type ia sne is also discussed within this context. we derive thetype ia sn rate as a function of the stellar mass of the galaxy and find asharp increase toward galaxies with higher activity of star formation. thissuggests that a significant fraction of type ia sne are associated with youngstellar populations.  finally, as a by-product, we give the average k-band light curve ofcore-collapse sne based on all the existing data, and review the relationbetween sn rate and far-infrared luminosity.

astro-ph;0411486	the star cluster population of ngc 5253	we present a detailed analysis of the star cluster population in thestarburst galaxy ngc 5253. our work is based on hst optical and vlt ks images.we detect more than 300 clusters, and for all of them we derive the photometryin the v, i and ks bands and built a color-color v-i/v-ks diagram. aftercorrection for star contamination, we matched 115 sources in all the threebands v, i and ks. comparison of the data points with models shows how most ofthe sources are affected by a red excess. the ages of the younger clusters areobtained from a hst halpha image which allows to partially remove thedegeneracy between age and extinction and to calculate the screen optical depthtoward the clusters. the v and ks luminosity functions show a marked turnoverat m(v)=-7.3 and m(k)=-10.2, with a shape roughly similar to the gaussiandistribution of old globular clusters. we convert the luminosity function intoa mass function, and find that the clusters younger than 10 myr show a powerlaw distribution with slope -1.6, while the distribution of the older clustershas a maximum at about 4x10^4 msun.

astro-ph;0504467	accounting for anisoplanatic point spread function in deep wide-field  adaptive optics images	in this paper we present the approach we have used to determine and accountfor the anisoplanatic point spread function (psf) in deep adaptive optics (ao)images for the survey of a wide area with naco (swan) at the eso vlt. thesurvey comprises adaptive optics observations in the ks band totaling ~ 30arcmin^2, assembled from 42 discrete fields centered on different bright starssuitable for ao guiding. we develop a parametric model of the psf variationsacross the field of view in order to build an accurate model psf for everygalaxy detected in each of the fields. we show that this approach isparticularly convenient, as it uses only easily available data and makes nouncertain assumptions about the stability of the isoplanatic angle during anygiven night. the model was tested using simulated galaxy profiles to check itsperformance in terms of recovering the correct morphological parameters; wefind that the results are reliable up to ks ~ 20.5 (k_ab ~ 22.3) in a typicalswan field. finally, the model obtained was used to derive the first resultsfrom five swan fields, and to obtain the ao morphology of 55 galaxies brighterthan ks = 20. these preliminary results demonstrate the unique power of aoobservations to derive the details of faint galaxy morphologies and to studygalaxy evolution.

astro-ph;0607221	galaxy morphology and evolution from swan adaptive optics imaging	we present the results from adaptive optics (ao) assisted imaging in the ksband of an area of 15 arcmin^2 for swan (survey of a wide area with naco). wederive the high resolution near-ir morphology of ~400 galaxies up to ks~23.5 inthe first 21 swan fields around bright guide stars, carefully taking intoaccount the survey selection effects and using an accurate treatment of theanisoplanatic ao psf. the detected galaxies are sorted into two morphologicalclasses according to their sersic index. the extracted morphological propertiesand number counts of the galaxies are compared with the predictions ofdifferent galaxy formation and evolution models, both for the whole galaxypopulation and separately for late-type and early-type galaxies. this is one ofthe first times such a comparison has been done in the near-ir, as aoobservations and accurate psf modeling are needed to obtain reliablemorphological classification of faint field galaxies at these wavelengths. forearly-type galaxies we find that a pure luminosity evolution model, withoutevidence for relevant number and size evolution, better reproduces the observedproperties of our ks-selected sample than current semi-analytic models based onthe hierarchical picture of galaxy formation. in particular, we find that theobserved flattening of elliptical galaxy counts at ks~20 is quantitatively ingood agreement with the prediction of the pure luminosity evolution model thatwas calculated prior to the observation. for late-type galaxies, while bothmodels are able to reproduce the number counts, we find some hints of apossible size growth. these results demonstrate the unique power of aoobservations to derive high resolution details of faint galaxies' morphology inthe near-ir and drive studies of galaxy evolution.

astro-ph;0610783	a nicmos search for obscured supernovae in starburst galaxies	the detection of obscured supernovae (sne) in near-infrared monitoringcampaigns of starburst galaxies has shown that a significant fraction of sne ismissed by optical surveys. however, the number of sne detected in ground-basednear-ir observations is still significantly lower than the number of sneextrapolated from the fir luminosity of the hosts. a possibility is that mostsne occur within the nuclear regions, where the limited angular resolution ofground-based observations prevents their detection. this issue prompted us toexploit the superior angular resolution of nicmos-hst to search for obscuredsne within the first kpc from the nucleus of strong starbursting galaxies. atotal of 17 galaxies were observed in snapshot mode. based on their firluminosity, we expected to detect not less than ~12 sne. however, no confirmedsn event was found. from our data we derive an observed nuclear sn rate &lt;0.5sn/yr per galaxy. the shortage of sn detections can be explained by acombination of several effects. the most important are: i) the existence of astrong extinction, a_v&gt;11; ii) most sne occur within the first 0.5" (whichcorresponds in our sample to about 500pc) where even nicmos is unable to detectsn events.
