0706.1510	aromatic emission from the ionised mane of the horsehead nebula	we study the evolution of the aromatic infrared bands (aibs) emitters acrossthe illuminated edge of the horsehead nebula and especially their survival andproperties in the hii region. we present spectral mapping observations takenwith the infrared spectrograph (irs) at wavelengths 5.2-38 microns. a strongaib at 11.3 microns is detected in the hii region, relative to the other aibsat 6.2, 7.7 and 8.6 microns. the intensity of this band appears to becorrelated with the intensity of the [neii] at 12.8 microns and of halpha,which shows that the emitters of the 11.3 microns band are located in theionised gas. the survival of pahs in the hii region could be due to themoderate intensity of the radiation field (g0 about 100) and the lack ofphotons with energy above about 25ev. the enhancement of the intensity of the11.3 microns band in the hii region, relative to the other aibs can beexplained by the presence of neutral pahs. our observations highlight atransition region between ionised and neutral pahs observed with idealconditions in our galaxy. a scenario where pahs can survive in hii regions andbe significantly neutral could explain the detection of a prominent 11.3microns band in other spitzer observations.

0901.1699	dust formation observed in young supernova remnants with spitzer	we present dust features and masses observed in young supernova remnants(snrs) with spitzer irs mapping and staring observations of four youngestsupernova remnants: snr 1e102.2-7219 (e0102) in the smc, cas a and g11.2-0.3 inour galaxy, and n132d in the lmc. the spectral mapping data revealed a numberof dust features which include 21 micron-peak dust and featureless dust in casa and 18-micron peak dust in e0102 and n132d. the 18 micron-peak feature isfitted by a mix of mgsio$_3$ and solid si dust grains, while the 21-micron peakdust is by a mix of silicates and feo; we also explore dust fitting usingcontinuous distribution of ellipsoid grain models. we report detection of cofundamental band from cas a in near-infrared. we review dust features observedand identified in other snrs. the dust emission is spatially correlated withthe ejecta emission, showing dust is formed in sn ejecta. the spectra of e0102show rich gas lines from ejecta including strong ejecta lines of ne and o,including two [ne iii] lines and two [ne v] lines which allow us to diagnosticdensity and temperature of the ejecta and measure the ejecta masses. e0102 andn132d show weak or lacking ar, si, and fe ejecta, whereas the young galacticsnr cas a show strong ar, si, and s and weak fe. we discuss compositions andmasses of dust and association with those of ejecta and finally, dustcontribution from sne to early universe.

0905.0497	dust formation in the young core-collapse supernova remnant e0102	we present spitzer irs and irac observations of the young supernova remnante0102 (snr 1e0102.2-7219) in the small magellanic cloud. the infrared spectrashow strong ejecta lines of ne and o, with the [ne ii] line at 12.8 micronshaving a large velocity dispersion of 2,000-4,500 km/s indicative offast-moving ejecta. unlike the young galactic snr cas a, e0102 lacks emissionfrom ar and fe. diagnostics of the observed [ne iii] line pairs imply that [neiii] emitting ejecta have a low temperature of 650 k, while [ne v] line pairsimply that the infrared [ne v] emitting ejecta have a high density of~10^4/cm3. we have calculated radiative shock models for various velocityranges including the effects of photoionization. the shock model indicates thatthe [ne v] lines come mainly from the cooling zone, which is hot and dense,whereas [ne ii] and [ne iii] come mainly from the photoinization zone, whichhas a low temperature of 400-1000 k. we estimate an infrared emitting ne ejectamass of 0.04 msun from the infrared observations, and discuss implications forthe progenitor mass. the spectra also have a dust continuum feature peaking at18 microns that coincides spatially with the ejecta, providing evidence thatdust formed in the expanding ejecta. the 18-micron-peak dust feature is fittedby a mixture of mgsio3 and si dust grains, while the rest of the continuumrequires either carbon or al2o3 grains. we measure the total dust mass formedwithin the ejecta of e0102 to be ~0.014 msun. the dust mass in e0102 is thus afactor of a few smaller than that in cas a. the composition of the dust is alsodifferent, showing relatively less silicate and likely no fe-bearing dust, asis suggested by the absence of fe-emitting ejecta.

0906.4733	spitzer space telescope observations of the nucleus of comet  103p/hartley 2	we have used the spitzer 22-um peakup array to observe thermal emission fromthe nucleus and trail of comet 103p/hartley 2, the target of nasa's deep impactextended mission. the comet was observed on ut 2008 august 12 and 13, while thecomet was 5.5 au from the sun. we obtained two 200-frame sets of photometricimaging over a 2.7-hour period. to within the errors of the measurement, wefind no detection of any temporal variation between the two images. the cometshowed extended emission beyond a point source in the form of a faint traildirected along the comet's anti-velocity vector. after modeling and removingthe trail emission, a neatm model for the nuclear emission with beamingparameter of 0.95 +/- 0.20 indicates a small effective radius for the nucleusof 0.57 +/- 0.08 km and low geometric albedo 0.028 +/- 0.009 (1 sigma). withthis nucleus size and a water production rate of 3 x 10^28 molecules s-1 atperihelion (a'hearn et al. 1995) we estimate that ~100% of the surface area isactively emitting volatile material at perihelion. reports of emission activityout to ~5 au (lowry et al. 2001, snodgrass et al. 2008) support our finding ofa highly active nuclear surface. compared to deep impact's first target, comet9p/tempel 1, hartley 2's nucleus is one-fifth as wide (and about one-hundredththe mass) while producing a similar amount of outgassing at perihelion withabout 13 times the active surface fraction. unlike tempel 1, it should behighly susceptible to jet driven spin-up torques, and so could be rotating at amuch higher frequency. barring a catastrophic breakup or major fragmentationevent, the comet should be able to survive up to another 100 apparitions (~700yrs) at its current rate of mass loss.

(1995), kraemer et al. (2005) and reach et al. (2007).conclusions. the albedo of 4015 wilson-harrington is low, consistent with thoseof comet nuclei and primitive c-, p-, d-type asteorids. we establish a roughlower limit for the thermal inertia of w-h of 60 jm^-2s^(-0.5)k^-1 when it isat r=1au, which is slightly over the limit of 30 jm^-2s^(-0.5)k-1 derived bygroussin et al.

0911.1492	exclusion of tiny interstellar dust grains from the heliosphere	the distribution of interstellar dust grains (isdg) observed in the solarsystem depends on the nature of the interstellar medium-solar wind interaction.the charge of the grains couples them to the interstellar magnetic field (ismf)resulting in some fraction of grains being excluded from the heliosphere whilegrains on the larger end of the size distribution, with gyroradii comparable tothe size of the heliosphere, penetrate the termination shock. this results in askewing the size distribution detected in the solar system.  we present new calculations of grain trajectories and the resultant graindensity distribution for small isdgs propagating through the heliosphere. wemake use of detailed heliosphere model results, using three-dimensional (3-d)magnetohydrodynamic/kinetic models designed to match data on the shape of thetermination shock and the relative deflection of interstellar neutral h and heflowing into the heliosphere. we find that the necessary inclination of theismf relative to the inflow direction results in an asymmetry in thedistribution of the larger grains (0.1 micron) that penetrate the heliopause.smaller grains (0.01 micron) are completely excluded from the solar system atthe heliopause.

0912.0282	powerful h$_2$ line-cooling in stephan's quintet : i - mapping the  significant cooling pathways in group-wide shocks	we present results from the mid-infrared spectral mapping of stephan'squintet using the spitzer space telescope. a 1000 km/s collision has produced agroup-wide shock and for the first time the large-scale distribution of warmmolecular hydrogen emission is revealed, as well as its close association withknown shock structures. in the main shock region alone we find 5.0$\times10^{8}$ m$_{\odot}$ of warm h$_2$ spread over $\sim$ 480 kpc$^2$ andadditionally report the discovery of a second major shock-excited h$_2$feature. this brings the total h$_2$ line luminosity of the group in excess of10$^42$ erg/s. in the main shock, the h$_2$ line luminosity exceeds, by afactor of three, the x-ray luminosity from the hot shocked gas, confirming thatthe h$_2$-cooling pathway dominates over the x-ray. [si ii]34.82$\mu$memission, detected at a luminosity of 1/10th of that of the h$_2$, appears totrace the group-wide shock closely and in addition, we detect weak[feii]25.99$\mu$m emission from the most x-ray luminous part of the shock.comparison with shock models reveals that this emission is consistent withregions of fast shocks (100 &lt; $v_{s}$ &lt; 300 km/s) experiencing depletion ofiron and silicon onto dust grains. star formation in the shock (as traced viaionic lines, pah and dust emission) appears in the intruder galaxy, but moststrikingly at either end of the radio shock. the shock ridge itself showslittle star formation, consistent with a model in which the tremendous h$_{2}$power is driven by turbulent energy transfer from motions in a post-shockedlayer. the significance of the molecular hydrogen lines over other measuredsources of cooling in fast galaxy-scale shocks may have crucial implicationsfor the cooling of gas in the assembly of the first galaxies.

1004.2094	physical properties of giant molecular clouds in the large magellanic  cloud	the magellanic mopra assessment (magma) is a high angular resolution comapping survey of giant molecular clouds (gmcs) in the large and smallmagellanic clouds using the mopra telescope. here we report on the basicphysical properties of 125 gmcs in the lmc that have been surveyed to date. theobserved clouds exhibit scaling relations that are similar to those determinedfor galactic gmcs, although lmc clouds have narrower linewidths and lower columinosities than galactic clouds of a similar size. the average mass surfacedensity of the lmc clouds is 50 msol/pc2, approximately half that of gmcs inthe inner milky way. we compare the properties of gmcs with and without signsof massive star formation, finding that non-star-forming gmcs have lower peakco brightness than star-forming gmcs. we compare the properties of gmcs withestimates for local interstellar conditions: specifically, we investigate thehi column density, radiation field, stellar mass surface density and theexternal pressure. very few cloud properties demonstrate a clear dependence onthe environment; the exceptions are significant positive correlations betweeni) the hi column density and the gmc velocity dispersion, ii) the stellar masssurface density and the average peak co brightness, and iii) the stellar masssurface density and the co surface brightness. the molecular mass surfacedensity of gmcs without signs of massive star formation shows no dependence onthe local radiation field, which is inconsistent with thephotoionization-regulated star formation theory proposed by mckee (1989). wefind some evidence that the mass surface density of the magma clouds increaseswith the interstellar pressure, as proposed by elmegreen (1989), but thedetailed predictions of this model are not fulfilled once estimates for thelocal radiation field, metallicity and gmc envelope mass are taken intoaccount.

1005.2497	determining dust temperatures and masses in the herschel era: the  importance of observations longward of 200 micron	the properties of the dust grains (e.g., temperature and mass) can be derivedfrom fitting far-ir seds (&gt;100 micron). only with spire on herschel has it beenpossible to get high spatial resolution at 200 to 500 micron that is beyond thepeak (~160 micron) of dust emission in most galaxies. we investigate thedifferences in the fitted dust temperatures and masses determined using only&lt;200 micron data and then also including &gt;200 micron data (new spireobservations) to determine how important having &gt;200 micron data is forderiving these dust properties. we fit the 100 to 350 micron observations ofthe large magellanic cloud (lmc) point-by-point with a model that consists of asingle temperature and fixed emissivity law. the data used are existingobservations at 100 and 160 micron (from iras and spitzer) and new spireobservations of 1/4 of the lmc observed for the heritage key project as part ofthe herschel science demonstration phase. the dust temperatures and massescomputed using only 100 and 160 micron data can differ by up to 10% and 36%,respectively, from those that also include the spire 250 &amp; 350 micron data. wefind that an emissivity law proportional to lambda^-1.5 minimizes the 100-350micron fractional residuals. we find that the emission at 500 micron is ~10%higher than expected from extrapolating the fits made at shorter wavelengths.we find the fractional 500 micron excess is weakly anti-correlated with mips 24micron flux and the total gas surface density. this argues against a fluxcalibration error as the origin of the 500 micron excess. our results do notallow us to distinguish between a systematic variation in the wavelengthdependent emissivity law or a population of very cold dust only detectable atlambda &gt; 500 micron for the origin of the 500 micron excess.

1005.2787	dust in the bright supernova remnant n49 in the lmc	we investigate the dust associated with the supernova remnant (snr) n49 inthe large magellanic cloud (lmc) as observed with the herschel spaceobservatory. n49 is unusually bright because of an interaction with a molecularcloud along its eastern edge. we have used pacs and spire to measure the far irflux densities of the entire snr and of a bright region on the eastern edge ofthe snr where the snr shock is encountering the molecular cloud. using thesefluxes supplemented with archival data at shorter wavelengths, we estimate thedust mass associated with n49 to be about 10 msun. the bulk of the dust in oursimple two-component model has a temperature of 20-30 k, similar to that ofnearby molecular clouds. unfortunately, as a result of the limited angularresolution of herschel at the wavelengths sampled with spire, the uncertaintiesare fairly large. assuming this estimate of the dust mass associated with thesnr is approximately correct, it is probable that most of the dust in the snrarises from regions where the shock speed is too low to produce significantx-ray emission. the total amount of warm 50-60 k dust is ~0.1 or 0.4 msun,depending on whether the dust is modeled in terms of carbonaceous or silicategrains. this provides a firm lower limit to the amount of shock heated dust inn49.

1010.3134	statistical study of dust properties in lmc molecular clouds	the objective of this paper is to construct a catalog providing the dustproperties and the star formation efficiency (sfe) of the molecular clouds inthe large magellanic cloud (lmc). we use the infrared (ir) data obtained withthe spitzer telescope as part of the ``surveying the agents of a galaxy'sevolution'' (sage) legacy survey as well as the iras data. we also work withextinction (av) maps of the lmc. a total of 272 molecular clouds have beendetected in the lmc in a previous molecular survey, accounting for 230 giantmolecular clouds and 42 smaller clouds. we perform correlations between the iremission/extinction, and atomic and molecular gas tracers. we compare theatomic gas that surrounds the molecular cloud with the molecular gas in thecloud. using a dust emission model, we derive the physical properties of dustin and outside the clouds: equilibrium temperature, emissivity and extinction.we also determine the luminosity of the interstellar radiation fieldintercepted by the cloud, and the total ir luminosity. statistically, we do notfind any significant difference in the dust properties between the atomic andthe molecular phases. in particular we do not find evidence for a systematicdecrease of the dust temperature in the molecular phase, with respect to thesurrounding, presumably atomic gas. this is probably because giant molecularclouds are the sites of star formation, which heat the dust, while the smallestclouds are unresolved. the ratio between the ir luminosity and the cloud mass(ldust/mgas) does not seem to correlate with mgas. the highest value of theratio we derived is 18.1 lsol/msol in the 30 doradus region, which is known tobe the most prominent star formation region of the lmc, while the most likelyvalue is 0.5 and is representative of quiescent clouds. we provide aprescription to associate the various stages of star formation with itsldust/mgas.

1101.1089	variation of the extinction law in the trifid nebula	in the past few years, the extinction law has been measured in the infraredwavelengths for various molecular clouds and different laws have been obtained.in this paper we seek variations of the extinction law within the trifid nebularegion. such variations would demonstrate a local dust evolution linked tovariation of the environment parameters such as the density or the interstellarradiation field. the extinction values, a_lambda/a_v, are obtained using the2mass, ukidss and spitzer/glimpse surveys. the technique is to inter-calibratecolor-excess maps from different wavelengths to derive the extinction law andto map the extinction in the trifid region. we measured the extinction law at3.6, 4.5, and 5.8 um and we found a transition at a_v ~ 20 mag. below thisthreshold the extinction law is as expected from models for r_v=5.5 whereasabove 20 mag of visual extinction, it is flatter. using these results thecolor-excess maps are converted into a composite extinction map of the trifidnebula at a spatial resolution of 1 arcmin. a tridimensional analysis along theline-of-sight allowed us to estimate a distance of 2.7 kpc for the trifid. thecomparison of the extinction with the 1.25 mm emission suggests the millimeteremissivity is enhanced in the dense condensations of the cloud. our resultssuggest a dust transition at large extinction which has not been reported sofar and dust emissivity variations.

1101.2028	planck early results xviii: the power spectrum of cosmic infrared  background anisotropies	using planck maps of six regions of low galactic dust emission with a totalarea of about 140 square degrees, we determine the angular power spectra ofcosmic infrared background (cib) anisotropies from multipole l = 200 to l =2000 at 217, 353, 545 and 857 ghz. we use 21-cm observations of hi as a tracerof thermal dust emission to reduce the already low level of galactic dustemission and use the 143 ghz planck maps in these fields to clean out cosmicmicrowave background anisotropies. both of these cleaning processes arenecessary to avoid significant contamination of the cib signal. we measurecorrelated cib structure across frequencies. as expected, the correlationdecreases with increasing frequency separation, because the contribution ofhigh-redshift galaxies to cib anisotropies increases with wavelengths. we findno significant difference between the frequency spectrum of the cibanisotropies and the cib mean, with delta i/i=15% from 217 to 857 ghz. in termsof clustering properties, the planck data alone rule out the linear scale- andredshift-independent bias model. non-linear corrections are significant.consequently, we develop an alternative model that couples a dusty galaxy,parametric evolution model with a simple halo-model approach. it provides anexcellent fit to the measured anisotropy angular power spectra and suggeststhat a different halo occupation distribution is required at each frequency,which is consistent with our expectation that each frequency is dominated bycontributions from different redshifts. in our best-fit model, half of theanisotropy power at l=2000 comes from redshifts z&lt;0.8 at 857 ghz and z&lt;1.5 at545 ghz, while about 90% come from redshifts z&gt;2 at 353 and 217 ghz,respectively.

1101.2031	planck early results. xx. new light on anomalous microwave emission from  spinning dust grains	anomalous microwave emission (ame) has been observed by numerous experimentsin the frequency range ~10-60 ghz. using planck maps and multi-frequencyancillary data, we have constructed spectra for two known ame regions: theperseus and rho ophiuchi molecular clouds. the spectra are well fitted by acombination of free-free radiation, cosmic microwave background, thermal dust,and electric dipole radiation from small spinning dust grains. the spinningdust spectra are the most precisely measured to date, and show the highfrequency side clearly for the first time. the spectra have a peak in the range20-40 ghz and are detected at high significances of 17.1 sigma for perseus and8.4 sigma for rho ophiuchi. in perseus, spinning dust in the dense moleculargas can account for most of the ame; the low density atomic gas appears to playa minor role. in rho ophiuchi, the ~30 ghz peak is dominated by dense moleculargas, but there is an indication of an extended tail at frequencies 50-100 ghz,which can be accounted for by irradiated low density atomic gas. the dustparameters are consistent with those derived from other measurements. we havealso searched the planck map at 28.5 ghz for candidate ame regions, bysubtracting a simple model of the synchrotron, free-free, and thermal dust. wepresent spectra for two of the candidates; s140 and s235 are bright hii regionsthat show evidence for ame, and are well fitted by spinning dust models.

1101.2032	planck early results. xxi. properties of the interstellar medium in the  galactic plane	(abridged) planck has observed the entire sky from 30 ghz to 857ghz. theobserved foreground emission contains contributions from different phases ofthe interstellar medium (ism). we have separated the observed galactic emissioninto the different gaseous components (atomic, molecular and ionised) in eachof a number of galactocentric rings. templates are created for variousgalactocentric radii using velocity information from atomic (neutral hydrogen)and molecular (12co) observations. the ionised template is assumed to be tracedby free-free emission as observed by wmap, while 408 mhz emission is used totrace the synchrotron component. gas emission not traced by the abovetemplates, namely "ark gas", as evidenced using planck data, is included as anadditional template, the first time such a component has been used in this way.these templates are then correlated with each of the planck frequency bands, aswell as other ancillary data. the emission per column density of the gastemplates allows us to create distinct spectral energy distributions (seds) pergalactocentric ring and in each of the gaseous tracers from 1.4 ghz to 25 thz(12\mu m). apart from the thermal dust and free-free emission, we have probedthe galaxy for anomalous (e.g., spinning) dust as well as synchrotron emission.we show that anomalous dust emission is present in the atomic, molecular anddark gas phases throughout the galactic disk. the derived dust propetiesassociated with the dark gas phase are derived but do not allow us to revealthe nature of this phase. for all environments, the anomalous emission isconsistent with rotation from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) and,according to our simple model, accounts for $(25\pm5)%$ (statistical) of thetotal emission at 30 ghz.

1101.2035	planck early results: the galactic cold core population revealed by the  first all-sky survey	we present the statistical properties of the first version of the cold corecatalogue of planck objects (c3po), in terms of their spatial distribution,temperature, distance, mass, and morphology. we also describe the statistics ofthe early cold core catalogue (ecc, delivered with the early release compactsource catalogue, ercsc) that is the subset of the 915 most reliable detectionsof the complete catalogue. we have used the cococodet algorithm to extract10783 cold sources. temperature and dust emission spectral index {\beta} valuesare derived using the fluxes in the iras 100 \mum band and the three highestfrequency planck bands. temperature spans from 7k to 17k, and peaks around 13k.data are not consistent with a constant value of {\beta} over the alltemperature range. {\beta} ranges from 1.4 to 2.8 with a mean value around 2.1,and several possible scenarios are possible, including {\beta}(t) and theeffect of multiple t components folded into the measurements. for one third ofthe objects the distances are obtained. most of the detections are within 2 kpcin the solar neighbourhood, but a few are at distances greater than 4 kpc. thecores are distributed from the deep galactic plane, despite the confusion, tohigh latitudes (&gt;30$^{\circle}$). the associated mass estimates range from 1 to$10^5$ solar masses. using their physical properties these cold sources areshown to be cold clumps, defined as the intermediate cold sub-structuresbetween clouds and cores. these cold clumps are not isolated but mostlyorganized in filaments associated with molecular clouds. the cold corecatalogue of planck objects (c3po) is the first unbiased all-sky catalogue ofcold objects. it gives an unprecedented statistical view to the properties ofthese potential pre-stellar clumps and offers a unique possibility for theirclassification in terms of their intrinsic properties and environment.

1101.2036	planck early results xxiv: dust in the diffuse interstellar medium and  the galactic halo	this paper presents the first results of comparison of planck along with irasdata with green bank telescope 21-cm observations in 14 fields covering morethan 800 square degrees at high galactic latitude. galactic dust emission forfields with average hi column density lower than 2 x 10^20 cm^-2 is wellcorrelated with 21-cm emission. the residual emission in these fields, once thehi-correlated emission is removed, is consistent with the expected statisticalproperties of the cosmic infrared background fluctuations. fields with largercolumn densities show significant excess dust emission compared to the hicolumn density. regions of excess lie in organized structures that suggest thepresence of hydrogen in molecular form, though they are not always correlatedwith co emission. dust emission from intermediate-velocity clouds is detectedwith high significance. its spectral properties are consistent with, comparedto the local ism values, significantly hotter dust (t~20 k), lowersub-millimeter dust opacity, and a relative abundance of very small grains tolarge grains about four times higher. these results are compatible withexpectations for clouds that are part of the galactic fountain in which thereis dust shattering and fragmentation. correlated dust emission in hvcs is notdetected; the average of the 99.9% confidence upper limits to the emissivity is0.15 times the local ism value at 857 and 3000 ghz, in accordance with gasphase evidence for lower metallicity and depletion in these clouds. unexpectedanti-correlated variations of the dust temperature and emission cross-sectionper h atom are identified in the local ism and ivcs, a trend that continuesinto molecular environments. this suggests that dust growth throughaggregation, seen in molecular clouds, is active much earlier in the cloudcondensation and star formation processes.

1101.2037	planck early results: thermal dust in nearby molecular clouds	planck allows unbiased mapping of galactic sub-millimetre and millimetreemission from the most diffuse regions to the densest parts of molecularclouds. we present an early analysis of the taurus molecular complex, online-of-sight-averaged data and without component separation. the emissionspectrum measured by planck and iras can be fitted pixel by pixel using asingle modified blackbody. some systematic residuals are detected at 353 ghzand 143 ghz, with amplitudes around -7 % and +13 %, respectively, indicatingthat the measured spectra are likely more complex than a simple modifiedblackbody. significant positive residuals are also detected in the molecularregions and in the 217 ghz and 100 ghz bands, mainly caused by to thecontribution of the j=2-1 and j=1-0 12co and 13co emission lines. we derivemaps of the dust temperature t, the dust spectral emissivity index beta, andthe dust optical depth at 250 microns tau. the temperature map illustrates thecooling of the dust particles in thermal equilibrium with the incidentradiation field, from 16-17 k in the diffuse regions to 13-14 k in the denseparts. the distribution of spectral indices is centred at 1.78, with a standarddeviation of 0.08 and a systematic error of 0.07. we detect a significantt-beta anti-correlation. the dust optical depth map reveals the spatialdistribution of the column density of the molecular complex from the densestmolecular regions to the faint diffuse regions. we use near-infrared extinctionand hi data at 21-cm to perform a quantitative analysis of the spatialvariations of the measured dust optical depth at 250 microns per hydrogen atomtau/nh. we report an increase of tau/nh by a factor of about 2 between theatomic phase and the molecular phase, which has a strong impact on theequilibrium temperature of the dust particles.

1101.2039	planck early results: first assessment of the high frequency instrument  in-flight performance	the planck high frequency instrument (hfi) is designed to measure thetemperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave backgroundand galactic foregrounds in six wide bands centered at 100, 143, 217, 353, 545and 857 ghz at an angular resolution of 10' (100 ghz), 7' (143 ghz), and 5'(217 ghz and higher). hfi has been operating flawlessly since launch on 14 may2009. the bolometers cooled to 100 mk as planned. the settings of the readoutelectronics, such as the bolometer bias current, that optimize hfi's noiseperformance on orbit are nearly the same as the ones chosen during groundtesting. observations of mars, jupiter, and saturn verified both the opticalsystem and the time response of the detection chains. the optical beams areclose to predictions from physical optics modeling. the time response of thedetection chains is close to pre-launch measurements. the detectors suffer froman unexpected high flux of cosmic rays related to low solar activity. due tothe redundancy of planck's observations strategy, the removal of a few percentof data contaminated by glitches does not affect significantly the sensitivity.the cosmic rays heat up significantly the bolometer plate and the modulation onperiods of days to months of the heat load creates a common drift of allbolometer signals which do not affect the scientific capabilities. only thehigh energy cosmic rays showers induce inhomogeneous heating which is aprobable source of low frequency noise.

1101.2041	planck early results. vii. the early release compact source catalog	(abridged) a brief description of the methodology of construction, contentsand usage of the planck early release compact source catalogue (ercsc),including the early cold cores (ecc) and the early sunyaev-zeldovich (esz)cluster catalogue is provided. the catalogue is based on data that consist ofmapping the entire sky once and 60% of the sky a second time by planck, therebycomprising the first high sensitivity radio/submillimetre observations of theentire sky. a monte-carlo algorithm based on the injection and extraction ofartificial sources into the planck maps was implemented to select reliablesources among all extracted candidates such that the cumulative reliability ofthe catalogue is &gt;=90%. the 10sigma photometric flux density limit of thecatalogue at |b|&gt;30 deg is 0.49, 1.0, 0.67, 0.5, 0.33, 0.28, 0.25, 0.47 and0.82 jy at each of the nine frequencies between 30 and 857 ghz. sources whichare up to a factor of ~2 fainter than this limit, and which are present in"clean" regions of the galaxy where the sky background due to emission from theinterstellar medium is low, are included in the ercsc if they meet the highreliability criterion. the planck ercsc sources have known associations tostars with dust shells, stellar cores, radio galaxies, blazars, infraredluminous galaxies and galactic interstellar medium features. a significantfraction of unclassified sources are also present in the catalogs. in addition,two early release catalogs that contain 915 cold molecular cloud corecandidates and 189 sz cluster candidates that have been generated usingmulti-frequency algorithms are presented. the entire source list, with morethan 15000 unique sources, is ripe for follow-up characterisation withherschel, atca, vla, sofia, alma and other ground-based observing facilities.

1101.2045	planck early results: the planck view of nearby galaxies	the all-sky coverage of the planck early release compact source catalogue(ercsc) provides an unsurpassed survey of galaxies at submillimetre (submm)wavelengths, representing a major improvement in the numbers of galaxiesdetected, as well as the range of far-ir/submm wavelengths over which they havebeen observed. we here present the first results on the properties of nearbygalaxies using these data. we match the ercsc catalogue to iras-detectedgalaxies in the imperial iras faint source redshift catalogue (iifscz), so thatwe can measure the spectral energy distributions (seds) of these objects from60 to 850 microns. this produces a list of 1717 galaxies with reliableassociations between planck and iras, from which we select a subset of 468 forsed studies, namely those with strong detections in the three highest frequencyplanck bands and no evidence of cirrus contamination. the seds are fitted usingparametric dust models to determine the range of dust temperatures andemissivities. we find evidence for colder dust than has previously been foundin external galaxies, with t&lt;20k. such cold temperatures are found using boththe standard single temperature dust model with variable emissivity beta, or atwo dust temperature model with beta fixed at 2. we also compare our results tostudies of distant submm galaxies (smgs) which have been claimed to containcooler dust than their local counterparts. we find that including our sample of468 galaxies significantly reduces the distinction between the two populations.fits to seds of selected objects using more sophisticated templates derivedfrom radiative transfer models confirm the presence of the colder dust foundthrough parameteric fitting. we thus conclude that cold (t&lt;20k) dust is asignificant and largely unexplored component of many nearby galaxies.

1101.2046	planck early results: origin of the submm excess dust emission in the  magellanic clouds	the integrated spectral energy distributions of the large and smallmagellanic cloud appear significantly flatter than expected from dust modelsbased on their fir and radio emission. the origin of this millimetre excess isstill unexplained, and is here investigated using the planck data. thebackground cmb contribution is subtracted using an ilc method performed locallyaround the galaxies. the foreground emission from the milky way is subtracted.after subtraction, the emission of both galaxies correlates closely with thegas emission of the lmc and smc. the millimetre excess in the lmc can beexplained by cmb fluctuations, but a significant excess is still present in thesmc sed. the planck and iris data at 100 micron are combined to produce thermaldust temperature and optical depth maps of the two galaxies. the lmctemperature map shows the presence of a warm inner arm already found with thespitzer data, but also shows the existence of a previously unidentified coldouter arm. several cold regions are found along this arm, some of which areassociated with known molecular clouds. the average emissivity spectral indexis found to be consistent with beta=1.5 and beta=1.2 below 500 microns for thelmc and smc respectively, significantly flatter than the values observed in themilky way. furthermore, there is evidence in the smc for a further flatteningof the sed in the sub-mm. the spatial distribution of the millimetre dustexcess in the smc follows the gas and thermal dust distribution. differentmodels are explored in order to fit the dust emission in the smc. it isconcluded that the millimetre excess is unlikely to be caused by very cold dustemission and that it could be due to a combination of spinning dust. emissionand thermal dust emission by more amorphous dust grains than those present inour galaxy.

1101.2047	planck early results. xv. spectral energy distributions and radio  continuum spectra of northern extragalactic radio sources	spectral energy distributions (seds) and radio continuum spectra arepresented for a northern sample of 104 extragalactic radio sources, based onthe planck early release compact source catalogue (ercsc) and simultaneousmultifrequency data. the nine planck frequencies, from 30 to 857 ghz, arecomplemented by a set of simultaneous observations ranging from radio togamma-rays. this is the first extensive frequency coverage in the radio andmillimetre domains for an essentially complete sample of extragalactic radiosources, and it shows how the individual shocks, each in their own phase ofdevelopment, shape the radio spectra as they move in the relativistic jet. theseds presented in this paper were fitted with second and third degreepolynomials to estimate the frequencies of the synchrotron and inverse compton(ic) peaks, and the spectral indices of low and high frequency radio data,including the planck ercsc data, were calculated. sed modelling methods arediscussed, with an emphasis on proper, physical modelling of the synchrotronbump using multiplecomponents. planck ercsc data also suggest that the originalaccelerated electron energy spectrum could be much harder than commonlythought, with power-law index around 1.5 instead of the canonical 2.5. theimplications of this are discussed for the acceleration mechanisms effective inblazar shock. furthermore in many cases the planck data indicate that gamma-rayemission must originate in the same shocks that produce the radio emission.

1101.2048	planck early results. vi. the high frequency instrument data processing	we describe the processing of the 336 billion raw data samples from the highfrequency instrument (hfi) which we performed to produce six temperature mapsfrom the first 295 days of planck-hfi survey data. these maps provide anaccurate rendition of the sky emission at 100, 143, 217, 353, 545 and 857 ghzwith an angular resolution ranging from 9.9 to 4.4^2. the white noise level isaround 1.5 {\mu}k degree or less in the 3 main cmb channels (100--217ghz). thephotometric accuracy is better than 2% at frequencies between 100 and 353 ghzand around 7% at the two highest frequencies. the maps created by the hfi dataprocessing centre reach our goals in terms of sensitivity, resolution, andphotometric accuracy. they are already sufficiently accurate andwell-characterised to allow scientific analyses which are presented in anaccompanying series of early papers. at this stage, hfi data appears to be ofhigh quality and we expect that with further refinements of the data processingwe should be able to achieve, or exceed, the science goals of the planckproject.

1103.2170	dust emission from evolved and unevolved hii regions in the large  magellanic cloud	we present a study of the dust properties of 12 classical and superbubble hiiregions in the large magellanic cloud. we use infrared photometry from spitzer(8, 24, 70, and 160 \mum bands), obtained as part of the surveying the agentsof a galaxy's evolution (sage) program, along with archival spectroscopicclassifications of the ionizing stars to examine the role of stellar sources ondust heating and processing. our infrared observations show surprisingly littlecorrelation between the emission properties of the dust and the effectivetemperatures or bolometric magnitudes of stars in the hii regions, suggestingthat the hii region evolutionary timescale is not on the order of the dustprocessing timescale. we find that the infrared emission of superbubbles andclassical hii regions shows little differentiation between the two classes,despite the significant differences in age and morphology. we do detect acorrelation of the 24 \mum emission from hot dust with the ratio of 70 to 160\mum flux. this correlation can be modeled as a trend in the temperature of aminority hot dust component, while a majority of the dust remains significantlycooler.

0709.2880	freshly formed dust in the cassiopeia a supernova remnant as revealed by  the spitzer space telescope	we performed spitzer infrared spectrograph mapping observations coveringnearly the entire extent of the cassiopeia a supernova remnant (snr), producingmid-infrared (5.5-35 micron) spectra every 5-10". gas lines of ar, ne, o, si, sand fe, and dust continua were strong for most positions. we identify threedistinct ejecta dust populations based on their continuum shapes. the dominantdust continuum shape exhibits a strong peak at 21 micron. a line-free map of 21micron-peak dust made from the 19-23 micron range closely resembles the [arii], [o iv], and [ne ii] ejecta-line maps implying that dust is freshly formedin the ejecta. spectral fitting implies the presence of sio2, mgprotosilicates, and feo grains in these regions. the second dust type exhibitsa rising continuum up to 21 micron and then flattens thereafter. this ``weak 21micron'' dust is likely composed of al2o3 and c grains. the third dustcontinuum shape is featureless with a gently rising spectrum and is likelycomposed of mgsio3 and either al2o3 or fe grains. using the least massivecomposition for each of the three dust classes yields a total mass of 0.02msun. using the most-massive composition yields a total mass of 0.054 msun. theprimary uncertainty in the total dust mass stems from the selection of the dustcomposition necessary for fitting the featureless dust as well as 70 micronflux. the freshly formed dust mass derived from cas a is sufficient from sne toexplain the lower limit on the dust masses in high redshift galaxies.

1110.1260	non-standard grain properties, dark gas reservoir, and extended  submillimeter excess, probed by herschel in the large magellanic cloud	aims: in this paper, we perform detailed modelling of the spitzer andherschel observations of the lmc, in order to: (i) systematically study theuncertainties and biases affecting dust mass estimates; and to (ii) explore thepeculiar ism properties of the lmc.  methods: to achieve these goals, we have modelled the spatially resolved sedswith two alternate grain compositions, to study the impact of differentsubmillimetre opacities on the dust mass. we have rigorously propagated theobservational errors (noise and calibration) through the entire fittingprocess, in order to derive consistent parameter uncertainties.  results: first, we show that using the integrated sed leads tounderestimating the dust mass by ~50 % compared to the value obtained withsufficient spatial resolution, for the region we studied. this might be thecase, in general, for unresolved galaxies. second, we show that milky way typegrains produce higher gas-to-dust mass ratios than what seems possibleaccording to the element abundances in the lmc. a spatial analysis shows thatthis dilemma is the result of an exceptional property: the grains of the lmchave on average a larger intrinsic submm opacity (emissivity index beta~1.7 andopacity kappa_abs(160 microns)=1.6 m2/kg) than those of the galaxy. by studyingthe spatial distribution of the gas-to-dust mass ratio, we are able toconstrain the fraction of unseen gas mass between ~10, and ~100 % and show thatit is not sufficient to explain the gas-to-dust mass ratio obtained with milkyway type grains. finally, we confirm the detection of a 500 microns extendedemission excess with an average relative amplitude of ~15 %, varying up to 40%. this excess anticorrelates well with the dust mass surface density. althoughwe do not know the origin of this excess, we show that it is unlikely theresult of very cold dust, or cmb fluctuations.

1110.4224	dust processing in supernova remnants: spitzer mips sed and irs  observations	we present spitzer mips sed and irs observations of 14 galactic supernovaremnants previously identified in the glimpse survey. we find evidence forsnr/molecular cloud interaction through detection of [oi] emission, ioniclines, and emission from molecular hydrogen. through black-body fitting of themips seds we find the large grains to be warm, 29-66 k. the dust emission ismodeled using the dustem code and a three component dust model composed ofpopulations of big grains, very small grains, and polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons. we find the dust to be moderately heated, typically by 30-100times the interstellar radiation field. the source of the radiation is likelyhydrogen recombination, where the excitation of hydrogen occurred in the shockfront. the ratio of very small grains to big grains is found for most of themolecular interacting snrs to be higher than that found in the plane of themilky way, typically by a factor of 2--3. we suggest that dust shattering isresponsible for the relative over-abundance of small grains, in agreement withprediction from dust destruction models. however, two of the snrs are best fitwith a very low abundance of carbon grains to silicate grains and with a veryhigh radiation field. a likely reason for the low abundance of small carbongrains is sputtering. we find evidence for silicate emission at 20 $\mu$m intheir seds, indicating that they are young snrs based on the strong radiationfield necessary to reproduce the observed seds.

1207.4061	planck intermediate results. v. pressure profiles of galaxy clusters  from the sunyaev-zeldovich effect	taking advantage of the all-sky coverage and broad frequency range of theplanck satellite, we study the sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) and pressure profiles of62 nearby massive clusters detected at high significance in the 14-monthnominal survey. careful reconstruction of the sz signal indicates that mostclusters are individually detected at least out to r500. by stacking the radialprofiles, we have statistically detected the radial sz signal out to 3 x r500,i.e., at a density contrast of about 50-100, though the dispersion about themean profile dominates the statistical errors across the whole radial range.our measurement is fully consistent with previous planck results on integratedsz fluxes, further strengthening the agreement between sz and x-raymeasurements inside r500. correcting for the effects of the planck beam, wehave calculated the corresponding pressure profiles. this new constraint fromsz measurements is consistent with the x-ray constraints from xmm-newton in theregion in which the profiles overlap (i.e., [0.1-1]r500), and is in fairly goodagreement with theoretical predictions within the expected dispersion. atlarger radii the average pressure profile is slightly flatter than mostpredictions from numerical simulations. combining the sz and x-ray observedprofiles into a joint fit to a generalised pressure profile gives best-fitparameters [p0, c500, gamma, alpha, beta] = [6.41, 1.81, 0.31, 1.33, 4.13].using a reasonable hypothesis for the gas temperature in the cluster outskirtswe reconstruct from our stacked pressure profile the gas mass fraction profileout to 3 x r500. within the temperature driven uncertainties, our planckconstraints are compatible with the cosmic baryon fraction and expected gasfraction in halos.

1207.4706	planck intermediate results. vii. statistical properties of infrared and  radio extragalactic sources from the planck early release compact source  catalogue at frequencies between 100 and 857 ghz	(abridged for arxiv) we make use of the planck all-sky survey to derivenumber counts and spectral indices of extragalactic sources -- infrared andradio sources -- from the planck early catalogue (ercsc) at 100 to 857ghz. oursample contains, after the 80% completeness cut, between 122 and 452 andsources, with flux densities above 0.3 and 1.9jy at 100 and 857ghz, over about31 to 40% of the sky. using planck hfi, all the sources have been classified aseither dust-dominated or synchrotron-dominated on the basis of their spectralenergy distributions (sed). our sample is thus complete, flux-limited andcolor-selected to differentiate between the two populations. we find anapproximately equal number of synchrotron and dusty sources between 217 and353ghz; at 353ghz or higher (or 217ghz and lower) frequencies, the number isdominated by dusty (synchrotron) sources, as expected. for most of the sources,the spectral indices are also derived. we provide for the first time counts ofbright sources from 353 to 857ghz and the contributions from dusty andsynchrotron sources at all hfi frequencies in the key spectral range wherethese spectra are crossing. the observed counts are in the euclidean regime.the number counts are compared to previously published data (earlier planck,herschel, blast, scuba, laboca, spt, and act) and models taking into accountboth radio or infrared galaxies. we derive the multi-frequency euclidean leveland compare it to wmap, spitzer and iras results. the submillimetre numbercounts are not well reproduced by current evolution models of dusty galaxies,whereas the millimetre part appears reasonably well fitted by the most recentmodel for synchrotron-dominated sources. finally we provide estimates of thelocal luminosity density of dusty galaxies, providing the first suchmeasurements at 545 and 857ghz.

1301.5839	planck intermediate results. xii: diffuse galactic components in the  gould belt system	we perform an analysis of the diffuse low-frequency galactic components inthe southern part of the gould belt system (130^\circ\leq l\leq 230^\circ and-50^\circ\leq b\leq -10^\circ). strong ultra-violet (uv) flux coming from thegould belt super-association is responsible for bright diffuse foregrounds thatwe observe from our position inside the system and that can help us improve ourknowledge of the galactic emission. free-free emission and anomalous microwaveemission (ame) are the dominant components at low frequencies (\nu &lt; 40 ghz),while synchrotron emission is very smooth and faint. we separate diffusefree-free emission and ame from synchrotron emission and thermal dust emissionby using planck data, complemented by ancillary data, using the "correlatedcomponent analysis" (cca) component separation method and we compare with theresults of cross-correlation of foreground templates with the frequency maps.we estimate the electron temperature t_e from h$\alpha$ and free-free emissionusing two methods (temperature-temperature plot and cross-correlation) and weobtain t_e ranging from 3100 to 5200 k, for an effective fraction of absorbingdust along the line of sight of 30% (f_d=0.3). we estimate the frequencyspectrum of the diffuse ame and we recover a peak frequency (in flux densityunits) of 25.5 \pm 1.5 ghz. we verify the reliability of this result withrealistic simulations that include the presence of biases in the spectral modelfor the ame and in the free-free template. by combining physical models forvibrational and rotational dust emission and adding the constraints from thethermal dust spectrum from planck and iras we are able to get a gooddescription of the frequency spectrum of the ame for plausible values of thelocal density and radiation field.

1303.5062	planck 2013 results. i. overview of products and scientific results	the esa's planck satellite, dedicated to studying the early universe and itssubsequent evolution, was launched 14 may 2009 and has been scanning themicrowave and submillimetre sky continuously since 12 august 2009. this papergives an overview of the mission and its performance, the processing, analysis,and characteristics of the data, the scientific results, and the science dataproducts and papers in the release. the science products include maps of thecmb and diffuse extragalactic foregrounds, a catalogue of compact galactic andextragalactic sources, and a list of sources detected through the sz effect.the likelihood code used to assess cosmological models against the planck dataand a lensing likelihood are described. scientific results include robustsupport for the standard six-parameter lcdm model of cosmology and improvedmeasurements of its parameters, including a highly significant deviation fromscale invariance of the primordial power spectrum. the planck values for theseparameters and others derived from them are significantly different from thosepreviously determined. several large-scale anomalies in the temperaturedistribution of the cmb, first detected by wmap, are confirmed with higherconfidence. planck sets new limits on the number and mass of neutrinos, and hasmeasured gravitational lensing of cmb anisotropies at greater than 25 sigma.planck finds no evidence for non-gaussianity in the cmb. planck's results agreewell with results from the measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. planckfinds a lower hubble constant than found in some more local measures. sometension is also present between the amplitude of matter fluctuations derivedfrom cmb data and that derived from sz data. the planck and wmap power spectraare offset from each other by an average level of about 2% around the firstacoustic peak.

1303.5063	planck 2013 results. ii. low frequency instrument data processing	we describe the data processing pipeline of the planck low frequencyinstrument (lfi) data processing centre (dpc) to create and characterizefull-sky maps based on the first 15.5 months of operations at 30, 44 and 70ghz. in particular, we discuss the various steps involved in reducing the data,starting from telemetry packets through to the production of cleaned,calibrated timelines and calibrated frequency maps. data are continuouslycalibrated using the modulation induced on the mean temperature of the cosmicmicrowave background radiation by the proper motion of the spacecraft. skysignals other than the dipole are removed by an iterative procedure based onsimultaneous fitting of calibration parameters and sky maps. noise propertiesare estimated from time-ordered data after the sky signal has been removed,using a generalized least square map-making algorithm. a destriping code(madam) is employed to combine radiometric data and pointing information intosky maps, minimizing the variance of correlated noise. noise covariancematrices, required to compute statistical uncertainties on lfi and planckproducts, are also produced. main beams are estimated down to the -20 db levelusing jupiter transits, which are also used for the geometrical calibration ofthe focal plane.

1303.5072	planck 2013 results. xii. component separation	planck has produced detailed all-sky observations over nine frequency bandsbetween 30 and 857 ghz. these observations allow robust reconstruction of theprimordial cosmic microwave background (cmb) temperature fluctuations overnearly the full sky, as well as new constraints on galactic foregrounds. thispaper describes the component separation framework adopted by planck. we testfour foreground-cleaned cmb maps derived using qualitatively differentcomponent separation algorithms. the quality of our reconstructions isevaluated through detailed simulations and internal comparisons, and shownthrough various tests to be internally consistent and robust for cmb powerspectrum and cosmological parameter estimation up to l = 2000. the parameterconstraints on lambdacdm cosmologies derived from these maps are consistentwith those presented in the cross-spectrum based planck likelihood analysis. wechoose two of the cmb maps for specific scientific goals. we also present mapsand frequency spectra of the galactic low-frequency, co, and thermal dustemission. the component maps are found to provide a faithful representation ofthe sky, as evaluated by simulations. for the low-frequency component, thespectral index varies widely over the sky, ranging from about beta = -4 to -2.considering both morphology and prior knowledge of the low frequencycomponents, the index map allows us to associate a steep spectral index (beta &lt;-3.2) with strong anomalous microwave emission, corresponding to a spinningdust spectrum peaking below 20 ghz, a flat index of beta &gt; -2.3 with strongfree-free emission, and intermediate values with synchrotron emission.

1303.5073	planck 2013 results. xiii. galactic co emission	rotational transition lines of co play a major role in molecular radioastronomy and in particular in the study of star formation and the galacticstructure. although a wealth of data exists in the galactic plane and somewell-known molecular clouds, there is no available co high sensitivity all-skysurvey to date.  such all-sky surveys can be constructed using the \planck\ hfi data becausethe three lowest co rotational transition lines at 115, 230 and 345 ghzsignificantly contribute to the signal of the 100, 217 and 353 ghz hfi channelsrespectively. two different component separation methods are used to extractthe co maps from planck hfi data. the maps obtained are then compared to oneanother and to existing external co surveys. from these quality checks the bestco maps in terms of signal to noise and/or residual foreground contaminationare selected. three sets of velocity-integrated co emission maps are produced:type 1 maps of the co (1-0), (2-1), and (3-2) rotational transitions with lowforeground contamination but moderate signal-to-noise ratio; type 2 maps forthe (1-0) and (2-1) transitions with a better signal-to-noise ratio; and onetype 3 map, a line composite map with the best signal-to-noise ratio in orderto locate the faintest molecular regions. the maps are described in detail.they are shown to be fully compatible with previous surveys of parts of thegalactic plane and also of fainter regions out of the galactic plane. theplanck hfi velocity-integrated co maps for the (1-0), (2-1), and (3-2)rotational transitions provide an unprecedented all-sky co view of the galaxy.these maps are also of great interest to monitor potential co contamination oncmb \planck\ studies.

1303.5074	planck 2013 results. xiv. zodiacal emission	the planck satellite provides a set of all-sky maps at nine frequencies from30 ghz to 857 ghz. planets, minor bodies, and diffuse interplanetary dustemission (ipd) are all observed. the ipd can be separated from galactic andother emissions because planck views a given point on the celestial spheremultiple times, through different columns of ipd. we use the planck data toinvestigate the behaviour of zodiacal emission over the whole sky atsub-millimetre and millimetre wavelengths. we fit the planck data to find theemissivities of the various components of the cobe zodiacal model -- a diffusecloud, three asteroidal dust bands, a circumsolar ring, and an earth-trailingfeature. the emissivity of the diffuse cloud decreases with increasingwavelength, as expected from earlier analyses. the emissivities of the dustbands, however, decrease less rapidly, indicating that the properties of thegrains in the bands are different from those in the diffuse cloud. we fit thesmall amount of galactic emission seen through the telescope's far sidelobes,and place limits on possible contamination of the cmb results from bothzodiacal and far-sidelobe emission. when necessary, the results are used in theplanck pipeline to make maps with zodiacal emission and far sidelobes removed.we show that the zodiacal correction to the cmb maps is small compared to theplanck cmb temperature power spectrum and give a list of flux densities forsmall solar system bodies.

1303.5076	planck 2013 results. xvi. cosmological parameters	we present the first results based on planck measurements of the cmbtemperature and lensing-potential power spectra. the planck spectra at highmultipoles are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flatsix-parameter lcdm cosmology. in this model planck data determine thecosmological parameters to high precision. we find a low value of the hubbleconstant, h0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/mpc and a high value of the matter densityparameter, omega_m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreementwith constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) surveys. includingcurvature, we find that the universe is consistent with spatial flatness topercent-level precision using planck cmb data alone. we present results from ananalysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data setsin addition to planck and high-resolution cmb data. none of these models arefavoured significantly over standard lcdm. the deviation of the scalar spectralindex from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changesin the matter content of the universe. we find a 95% upper limit of r&lt;0.11 onthe tensor-to-scalar ratio. there is no evidence for additional neutrino-likerelativistic particles. using bao and cmb data, we find n_eff=3.30+/-0.27 forthe effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of0.23 ev for the summed neutrino mass. our results are in excellent agreementwith big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of n_eff=3.046. we find noevidence for dynamical dark energy. despite the success of the standard lcdmmodel, this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the cmb power spectrum atlow multipoles, as noted previously by the wmap team. while not of decisivesignificance, this is an anomaly in an otherwise self-consistent analysis ofthe planck temperature data.

1303.5087	planck 2013 results. xxvii. doppler boosting of the cmb: eppur si muove	our velocity relative to the rest frame of the cosmic microwave background(cmb) generates a dipole temperature anisotropy on the sky which has been wellmeasured for more than 30 years, and has an accepted amplitude of v/c =0.00123, or v = 369km/s. in addition to this signal generated by dopplerboosting of the cmb monopole, our motion also modulates and aberrates the cmbtemperature fluctuations (as well as every other source of radiation atcosmological distances). this is an order 0.1% effect applied to fluctuationswhich are already one part in roughly one hundred thousand, so it is quitesmall. nevertheless, it becomes detectable with the all-sky coverage, highangular resolution, and low noise levels of the planck satellite. here wereport a first measurement of this velocity signature using the aberration andmodulation effects on the cmb temperature anisotropies, finding a component inthe known dipole direction, (l,b)=(264, 48) [deg], of 384km/s +- 78km/s (stat.)+- 115km/s (syst.). this is a significant confirmation of the expectedvelocity.

1307.6191	thermal properties, sizes, and size distribution of jupiter-family  cometary nuclei	we present results from seppcon, an on-going survey of the ensemble physicalproperties of cometary nuclei. in this report we discuss mid-infraredmeasurements of the thermal emission from 89 nuclei of jupiter-family comets(jfcs). all data were obtained in 2006 and 2007 with the spitzer spacetelescope. for all 89 comets, we present new effective radii, and for 57 cometswe present beaming parameters. thus our survey provides the largest compilationof radiometrically-derived physical properties of nuclei to date. we concludethe following. (a) the average beaming parameter of the jfc population is1.03+/-0.11, consistent with unity, and indicating low thermal inertia. (b) theknown jfc population is not complete even at 3 km radius, and even for cometswith perihelia near ~2 au. (c) we find that the jfc nuclear cumulative sizedistribution (csd) has a power-law slope of around -1.9. (d) this power-law isclose to that derived from visible-wavelength observations, suggesting thatthere is no strong dependence of geometric albedo with radius. (e) the observedcsd shows a hint of structure with an excess of comets with radii 3 to 6 km.(f) our csd is consistent with an intrinsic distribution that lacks manysub-kilometer objects.

1307.6815	planck intermediate results. xiv. dust emission at millimetre  wavelengths in the galactic plane	we use planck hfi data combined with ancillary radio data to study theemissivity index of the interstellar dust emission in the frequency range 10 -353 ghz, or 3 - 0.8 mm, in the galactic plane. we analyse the region l=20 degr- 44 degr and |b| \leq 4 degr where the free-free emission can be estimatedfrom radio recombination line data. we fit the spectra at each sky pixel with amodified blackbody model and two spectral indices, beta_mm and beta_fir, belowand above 353 ghz respectively. we find that beta_mm is smaller than beta_firand we detect a correlation between this low frequency power-law index and thedust optical depth at 353 ghz, tau_353. the opacity spectral index beta_mmincreases from about 1.54 in the more diffuse regions of the galactic disk, |b|= 3 degr - 4 degr and tau_353 ~ 5 x 10^{-5}, to about 1.66 in the densestregions with an optical depth of more than one order of magnitude higher. weassociate this correlation with an evolution of the dust emissivity related tothe fraction of molecular gas along the line of sight. this translates intobeta_mm ~ 1.54 for a medium that is mostly atomic and beta_mm ~ 1.66 when themedium is dominated by molecular gas. we find that both the two-level systemmodel and the emission by ferromagnetic particles can explain the results. theresults improve our understanding of the physics of interstellar dust and leadtowards a complete model of the dust spectrum of the milky way fromfar-infrared to millimetre wavelengths.

1309.0382	planck 2013 results. xxx. cosmic infrared background measurements and  implications for star formation	we present new measurements of cib anisotropies using planck. combining hfidata with iras, the angular auto- and cross frequency power spectrum ismeasured from 143 to 3000 ghz, and the auto-bispectrum from 217 to 545 ghz. thetotal areas used to compute the cib power spectrum and bispectrum are about2240 and 4400 deg^2, respectively. after careful removal of the contaminants,and a complete study of systematics, the cib power spectrum and bispectrum aremeasured with unprecedented signal to noise ratio from angular multipolesell~150 to 2500, and ell~130 to 1100, respectively. two approaches aredeveloped for modelling cib power spectrum anisotropies. the first approachtakes advantage of the unique measurements by planck at large angular scales,and models only the linear part of the power spectrum, with a mean bias of darkmatter halos hosting dusty galaxies at a given redshift weighted by theircontribution to the emissivities. the second approach is based on a model thatassociates star-forming galaxies with dark matter halos and their subhalos,using a parametrized relation between the dust-processed infrared luminosityand (sub-)halo mass. the two approaches simultaneously fit all auto- and cross-power spectra very well. we find that the star formation history is wellconstrained up to z~2. however, at higher redshift, the accuracy of the starformation history measurement is strongly degraded by the uncertainty in thespectral energy distribution of cib galaxies. we also find that cib galaxieshave warmer temperatures as redshift increases. the cib bispectrum is steeperthan that expected from the power spectrum, although well fitted by a powerlaw; this gives some information about the contribution of massive halos to thecib bispectrum.

1312.1300	planck 2013 results. xi. all-sky model of thermal dust emission	this paper presents an all-sky model of dust emission from the planck 857,545 and 353 ghz, and iras 100 micron data. using a modified black-body fit tothe data we present all-sky maps of the dust optical depth, temperature, andspectral index over the 353-3000 ghz range. this model is a tightrepresentation of the data at 5 arc min. it shows variations of the order of 30% compared with the widely-used model of finkbeiner, davis, and schlegel. theplanck data allow us to estimate the dust temperature uniformly over the wholesky, providing an improved estimate of the dust optical depth compared toprevious all-sky dust model, especially in high-contrast molecular regions. anincrease of the dust opacity at 353 ghz, tau_353/n_h, from the diffuse to thedenser interstellar medium (ism) is reported. it is associated with a decreasein the observed dust temperature, t_obs, that could be due at least in part tothe increased dust opacity. we also report an excess of dust emission at hicolumn densities lower than 10^20 cm^-2 that could be the signature of dust inthe warm ionized medium. in the diffuse ism at high galactic latitude, wereport an anti-correlation between tau_353/n_h and t_obs while the dustspecific luminosity, i.e., the total dust emission integrated over frequency(the radiance) per hydrogen atom, stays about constant. the implication is thatin the diffuse high-latitude ism tau_353 is not as reliable a tracer of dustcolumn density as we conclude it is in molecular clouds where the correlationof tau_353 with dust extinction estimated using colour excess measurements onstars is strong. to estimate galactic e(b-v) in extragalactic fields at highlatitude we develop a new method based on the thermal dust radiance, instead ofthe dust optical depth, calibrated to e(b-v) using reddening measurements ofquasars deduced from sloan digital sky survey data.

1312.5446	planck intermediate results. xvii. emission of dust in the diffuse  interstellar medium from the far-infrared to microwave frequencies	the dust-hi correlation is used to characterize the emission properties ofdust in the diffuse interstellar medium. we cross-correlate sky maps fromplanck, wmap, and dirbe, at 17 frequencies from 23 to 3000 ghz, with the parkessurvey of the 21-cm line emission of neutral atomic hydrogen, over a contiguousarea of 7500 deg$^2$ centred on the southern galactic pole. our analysis yieldsfour specific results. (1) the dust temperature is observed to beanti-correlated with the dust emissivity and opacity. we interpret this resultas evidence for dust evolution within the diffuse ism. the mean dust opacity ismeasured to be $(7.1 \pm 0.6) 10^{-27} cm^2/h \times (\nu/353\,ghz)^{1.53\pm0.03}$ for $100 &lt; \nu &lt;353$ghz. (2) we map the spectral index ofdust emission at millimetre wavelengths, which is remarkably constant at$\beta_{mm} = 1.51\pm 0.13$. we compare it with the far infrared spectral indexbeta_fir derived from greybody fits at higher frequencies, and find asystematic difference, $\beta_{mm}-\beta_{fir} = -0.15$, which suggests thatthe dust sed flattens at $\nu &lt; 353\,$ghz. (3) we present spectral fits of themicrowave emission correlated with hi from 23 to 353 ghz, which separate dustand anomalous microwave emission. the flattening of the dust sed can beaccounted for with an additional component with a blackbody spectrum, whichaccounts for $(26 \pm 6)$% of the dust emission at 100 ghz and could representmagnetic dipole emission. alternatively, it could account for an increasingcontribution of carbon dust, or a flattening of the emissivity of amorphoussilicates, at millimetre wavelengths. these interpretations make differentpredictions for the dust polarization sed. (4) we identify a galacticcontribution to the residuals of the dust-hi correlation, which we model withvariations of the dust emissivity on angular scales smaller than that of ourcorrelation analysis.

1405.0871	planck intermediate results. xix. an overview of the polarized thermal  emission from galactic dust	this paper presents the large-scale polarized sky as seen by planck hfi at353 ghz, which is the most sensitive planck channel for dust polarization. weconstruct and analyse large-scale maps of dust polarization fraction andpolarization direction, while taking account of noise bias and possiblesystematic effects. we find that the maximum observed dust polarizationfraction is high (pmax &gt; 18%), in particular in some of the intermediate dustcolumn density (av &lt; 1mag) regions. there is a systematic decrease in the dustpolarization fraction with increasing dust column density, and we interpret thefeatures of this correlation in light of both radiative grain alignmentpredictions and fluctuations in the magnetic field orientation. we alsocharacterize the spatial structure of the polarization angle using the angledispersion function and find that, in nearby fields at intermediate latitudes,the polarization angle is ordered over extended areas that are separated byfilamentary structures, which appear as interfaces where the magnetic field skyprojection rotates abruptly without apparent variations in the dust columndensity. the polarization fraction is found to be anti-correlated with thedispersion of the polarization angle, implying that the variations are likelydue to fluctuations in the 3d magnetic field orientation along the line ofsight sampling the diffuse interstellar medium.we also compare the dustemission with the polarized synchrotron emission measured with the planck lfi,with low-frequency radio data, and with faraday rotation measurements ofextragalactic sources. the two polarized components are globally similar instructure along the plane and notably in the fan and north polar spur regions.a detailed comparison of these three tracers shows, however, that dust andcosmic rays generally sample different parts of the line of sight and confirmsthat much of the variation observed in the planck data is due to the 3dstructure of the magnetic field.

1405.0873	planck intermediate results. xxi. comparison of polarized thermal  emission from galactic dust at 353 ghz with interstellar polarization in the  visible	the planck survey provides unprecedented full-sky coverage of thesubmillimetre polarized emission from galactic dust, bringing new constraintson the properties of dust. the dust grains that emit the radiation seen byplanck in the submillimetre also extinguish and polarize starlight in thevisible. comparison of the polarization of the emission and of the interstellarpolarization on selected lines of sight probed by stars provides unique newdiagnostics of the emission and light scattering properties of dust. usingancillary catalogues of interstellar polarization and extinction of starlight,we obtain the degree of polarization, $p_v$ , and the optical depth in the vband to the star, $\tau_v$. toward these stars we measure the submillimetrepolarized intensity, $p_s$, and total intensity, $i_s$, in the planck 353 ghzchannel. for those lines of sight through the diffuse interstellar medium withcomparable values of the estimated column density and polarization directionsclose to orthogonal, we correlate properties in the submillimetre and visibleto find two ratios, $r_{s/v} = (p_s/i_s)/(p_v/\tau_v)$ and $r_{p/p} = p_s/p_v$, the latter focusing directly on the polarization properties of the alignedgrain population alone. we find $r_{s/v}$ = 4.2, with statistical andsystematic uncertainties 0.2 and 0.3, respectively, and $r_{p/p}$ = 5.4 mjysr$^{-1}$, with uncertainties 0.2 and 0.3 mjy sr$^{-1}$, respectively. ourestimate of $r_{s/v}$ is compatible with predictions based on a range ofpolarizing dust models that have been developed for the diffuse interstellarmedium. however, our estimate of $r_{p/p}$ is not compatible with predictions,which are too low by a factor of about 2.5. this more discriminatingdiagnostic, $r_{p/p}$, indicates that changes to the optical properties in themodels of the aligned grain population are required.

1405.0874	planck intermediate results. xxii. frequency dependence of thermal  emission from galactic dust in intensity and polarization	planck has mapped the intensity and polarization of the sky at microwavefrequencies with unprecedented sensitivity. we make use of the planck 353 ghzi, q, and u stokes maps as dust templates, and cross-correlate them with theplanck and wmap data at 12 frequencies from 23 to 353 ghz, over circularpatches with 10 degree radius. the cross-correlation analysis is performed forboth intensity and polarization data in a consistent manner. we use a mask thatfocuses our analysis on the diffuse interstellar medium at intermediategalactic latitudes. we determine the spectral indices of dust emission inintensity and polarization between 100 and 353 ghz, for each sky-patch. themean values, $1.59\pm0.02$ for polarization and $1.51\pm0.01$ for intensity,for a mean dust temperature of 19.6 k, are close, but significantly different($3.6\,\sigma$). we determine the mean spectral energy distribution (sed) ofthe microwave emission, correlated with the 353 ghz dust templates, byaveraging the results of the correlation over all sky-patches. we find that themean sed increases for decreasing frequencies at $\nu &lt; 60$ ghz, for bothintensity and polarization. the rise of the polarization sed towards lowfrequencies may be accounted for by a synchrotron component correlated withdust, with no need for any polarization of the anomalous microwave emission. weuse a spectral model to separate the synchrotron and dust polarization and tocharacterize the spectral dependence of the dust polarization fraction. thepolarization fraction ($p$) of the dust emission decreases by $(21\pm6)$ % from353 to 70 ghz. the decrease of $p$ could indicate differences in polarizationefficiency among components of interstellar dust (e.g., carbon versus silicategrains). our observational results provide inputs to quantify and optimize theseparation between galactic and cosmological polarization.

1406.5093	planck intermediate results. xxiii. galactic plane emission components  derived from planck with ancillary data	planck data when combined with ancillary data provide a unique opportunity toseparate the diffuse emission components of the inner galaxy. the purpose ofthe paper is to elucidate the morphology of the various emission components inthe strong star-formation region lying inside the solar radius and to clarifythe relationship between the various components. the region of the galacticplane covered is l=300-0-60deg where star-formation is highest and the emissionis strong enough to make meaningful component separation. the latitude widthsin this longitude range lie between 1deg and 2deg, which correspond to fwhmz-widths of 100-200pc at a typical distance of 6kpc. the four emissioncomponents studied here are synchrotron, free-free, anomalous microwaveemission (ame), and thermal (vibrational) dust emission. these components areidentified by constructing spectral energy distributions (seds) at positionsalong the galactic plane using the wide frequency coverage of planck(28.4-857ghz) in combination with low-frequency radio data at 0.408-2.3ghz pluswmap data at 23-94ghz, along with far-infrared (fir) data from dirbe and iras.the free-free component is determined from radio recombination line (rrl) data.ame is found to be comparable in brightness to the free-free emission on thegalactic plane in the frequency range 20-40ghz with a width in latitude similarto that of the thermal dust; it comprises 45+/-1% of the total 28.4ghz emissionin the longitude range l=300-0-60deg. the free-free component is the narrowest,reflecting the fact that it is produced by current star-formation as traced bythe narrow distribution of ob stars. it is the dominant emission on the planebetween 60 and 100ghz. rrls from this ionized gas are used to assess itsdistance, leading to a free-free z-width of fwhm ~100pc...(abridged)

1409.5738	planck intermediate results. xxx. the angular power spectrum of  polarized dust emission at intermediate and high galactic latitudes	the polarized thermal emission from galactic dust is the main foregroundpresent in measurements of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background(cmb) at frequencies above 100ghz. we exploit the planck hfi polarization datafrom 100 to 353ghz to measure the dust angular power spectra $c_\ell^{ee,bb}$over the range $40&lt;\ell&lt;600$ well away from the galactic plane. these willbring new insights into interstellar dust physics and a precise determinationof the level of contamination for cmb polarization experiments. we show thatstatistical properties of the emission can be characterized over largefractions of the sky using $c_\ell$. for the dust, they are well described bypower laws in $\ell$ with exponents $\alpha^{ee,bb}=-2.42\pm0.02$. theamplitudes of the polarization $c_\ell$ vary with the average brightness in away similar to the intensity ones. the dust polarization frequency dependenceis consistent with modified blackbody emission with $\beta_d=1.59$ and$t_d=19.6$k. we find a systematic ratio between the amplitudes of the galactic$b$- and $e$-modes of 0.5. we show that even in the faintest dust-emittingregions there are no "clean" windows where primordial cmb $b$-mode polarizationcould be measured without subtraction of dust emission. finally, we investigatethe level of dust polarization in the bicep2 experiment field. extrapolation ofthe planck 353ghz data to 150ghz gives a dust power$\ell(\ell+1)c_\ell^{bb}/(2\pi)$ of $1.32\times10^{-2}\mu$k$_{cmb}^2$ over the$40&lt;\ell&lt;120$ range; the statistical uncertainty is $\pm0.29$ and there is anadditional uncertainty (+0.28,-0.24) from the extrapolation, both in the sameunits. this is the same magnitude as reported by bicep2 over this $\ell$ range,which highlights the need for assessment of the polarized dust signal even inthe cleanest windows of the sky.

1409.6728	planck intermediate results. xxxii. the relative orientation between the  magnetic field and structures traced by interstellar dust	the role of the magnetic field in the formation of the filamentary structuresobserved in the interstellar medium (ism) is a debated topic. the planckall-sky maps of linearly polarized emission from dust at 353ghz provide therequired combination of imaging and statistics to study the correlation betweenthe structures of the galactic magnetic field and of interstellar matter, bothin the diffuse ism and in molecular clouds. the data reveal structures, orridges, in the intensity map with counterparts in the stokes q and/or u maps.we focus on structures at intermediate and high galactic latitudes with columndensity from $10^{20}$ to $10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. we measure the magnetic fieldorientation on the plane of the sky from the polarization data, and present analgorithm to estimate the orientation of the ridges from the dust intensitymap. we use analytical models to account for projection effects. comparingpolarization angles on and off the structures, we estimate the mean ratiobetween the strengths of the turbulent and mean components of the magneticfield to be between 0.6 and 1.0, with a preferred value of 0.8. we find thatthe ridges are preferentially aligned with the magnetic field measured on thestructures. this trend becomes more striking for increasing polarizationfraction and decreasing column density. we interpret the increase of alignmentwith polarization fraction as a consequence of projections effects. thedecrease of alignment for high column density is not due to a loss ofcorrelation between the structures and the geometry of the magnetic field. inmolecular complexes, we observe structures perpendicular to the magnetic field,which cannot be accounted for by projection effects. we discuss our results inthe context of models and mhd simulations, which describe the formation ofstructures in the magnetized ism.

1411.7381	a stubbornly large mass of cold dust in the ejecta of supernova 1987a	we present new herschel photometric and spectroscopic observations ofsupernova 1987a, carried out in 2012. our dedicated photometric measurementsprovide new 70 micron data and improved imaging quality at 100 and 160 microncompared to previous observations in 2010. our herschel spectra show only weakco line emission, and provide an upper limit for the 63 micron [o i] line flux,eliminating the possibility that line contaminations distort the previouslyestimated dust mass. the far-infrared spectral energy distribution (sed) iswell fitted by thermal emission from cold dust. the newly measured 70 micronflux constrains the dust temperature, limiting it to nearly a singletemperature. the far-infrared emission can be fitted by 0.5+-0.1 msun ofamorphous carbon, about a factor of two larger than the current nucleosyntheticmass prediction for carbon. the observation of sio molecules at early and latephases suggests that silicates may also have formed and we could fit the sedwith a combination of 0.3 msun of amorphous carbon and 0.5 msun of silicates,totalling 0.8 msun of dust. our analysis thus supports the presence of a largedust reservoir in the ejecta of sn 1987a. the inferred dust mass suggests thatsupernovae can be an important source of dust in the interstellar medium, fromlocal to high-redshift galaxies.

1502.00612	a joint analysis of bicep2/keck array and planck data	we report the results of a joint analysis of data from bicep2/keck array andplanck. bicep2 and keck array have observed the same approximately 400 deg$^2$patch of sky centered on ra 0h, dec. $-57.5\deg$. the combined maps reach adepth of 57 nk deg in stokes $q$ and $u$ in a band centered at 150 ghz. planckhas observed the full sky in polarization at seven frequencies from 30 to 353ghz, but much less deeply in any given region (1.2 $\mu$k deg in $q$ and $u$ at143 ghz). we detect 150$\times$353 cross-correlation in $b$-modes at highsignificance. we fit the single- and cross-frequency power spectra atfrequencies $\geq 150$ ghz to a lensed-$\lambda$cdm model that includes dustand a possible contribution from inflationary gravitational waves (asparameterized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$), using a prior on thefrequency spectral behavior of polarized dust emission from previous \planck\analysis of other regions of the sky. we find strong evidence for dust and nostatistically significant evidence for tensor modes. we probe various modelvariations and extensions, including adding a synchrotron component incombination with lower frequency data, and find that these make littledifference to the $r$ constraint. finally we present an alternative analysiswhich is similar to a map-based cleaning of the dust contribution, and showthat this gives similar constraints. the final result is expressed as alikelihood curve for $r$, and yields an upper limit $r_{0.05}&lt;0.12$ at 95%confidence. marginalizing over dust and $r$, lensing $b$-modes are detected at$7.0\,\sigma$ significance.

1502.01582	planck 2015 results. i. overview of products and scientific results	the european space agency's planck satellite, dedicated to studying the earlyuniverse and its subsequent evolution, was launched 14~may 2009 and scanned themicrowave and submillimetre sky continuously between 12~august 2009 and23~october 2013. in february~2015, esa and the planck collaboration releasedthe second set of cosmology products based on data from the entire planckmission, including both temperature and polarization, along with a set ofscientific and technical papers and a web-based explanatory supplement. thispaper gives an overview of the main characteristics of the data and the dataproducts in the release, as well as the associated cosmological andastrophysical science results and papers. the science products include maps ofthe cosmic microwave background (cmb), the thermal sunyaev-zeldovich effect,and diffuse foregrounds in temperature and polarization, catalogues of compactgalactic and extragalactic sources (including separate catalogues ofsunyaev-zeldovich clusters and galactic cold clumps), and extensive simulationsof signals and noise used in assessing the performance of the analysis methodsand assessment of uncertainties. the likelihood code used to assesscosmological models against the planck data are described, as well as a cmblensing likelihood. scientific results include cosmological parameters derivingfrom cmb power spectra, gravitational lensing, and cluster counts, as well asconstraints on inflation, non-gaussianity, primordial magnetic fields, darkenergy, and modified gravity.

1502.01588	planck 2015 results. x. diffuse component separation: foreground maps	planck has mapped the microwave sky in nine frequency bands between 30 and857 ghz in temperature and seven bands between 30 and 353 ghz in polarization.in this paper we consider the problem of diffuse astrophysical componentseparation, and process these maps within a bayesian framework to derive aconsistent set of full-sky astrophysical component maps. for the temperatureanalysis, we combine the planck observations with the 9-year wmap sky maps andthe haslam et al. 408 mhz map to derive a joint model of cmb, synchrotron,free-free, spinning dust, co, line emission in the 94 and 100 ghz channels, andthermal dust emission. full-sky maps are provided with angular resolutionsvarying between 7.5 arcmin and 1 deg. global parameters (monopoles, dipoles,relative calibration, and bandpass errors) are fitted jointly with the skymodel, and best-fit values are tabulated. for polarization, the model includescmb, synchrotron, and thermal dust emission. these models provide excellentfits to the observed data, with rms temperature residuals smaller than 4 ukover 93% of the sky for all planck frequencies up to 353 ghz, and fractionalerrors smaller than 1% in the remaining 7% of the sky. the main limitations ofthe temperature model at the lower frequencies are degeneracies among thespinning dust, free-free, and synchrotron components; additional observationsfrom external low-frequency experiments will be essential to break these. themain limitations of the temperature model at the higher frequencies areuncertainties in the 545 and 857 ghz calibration and zero-points. forpolarization, the main outstanding issues are instrumental systematics in the100-353 ghz bands on large angular scales in the form oftemperature-to-polarization leakage, uncertainties in the analog-to-digitalconversion, and very long time constant corrections, all of which are expectedto improve in the near future.

1502.01595	planck 2015 results. xxi. the integrated sachs-wolfe effect	this paper presents a study of the isw effect from the planck 2015temperature and polarization data release. the cmb is cross-correlated withdifferent lss tracers: the nvss, sdss and wise catalogues, and the planck 2015convergence lensing map. this cross-correlation yields a detection at$4\,\sigma$, where most of the signal-to-noise is due to the planck lensing andnvss. in fact, the isw effect is detected only from the planck data (throughthe isw-lensing bispectrum) at $\approx 3\,\sigma$, which is similar to thedetection level achieved by combining the cross-correlation signal coming fromall the catalogues. this cross-correlation analysis is performed only with theplanck temperature data, since the polarization scales available in the 2015release do not permit significant improvement of the cmb-lss cross-correlationdetectability. nevertheless, polarization data is used to study the anomalouslylarge isw signal previously reported through the aperture photometry on stackedcmb features at the locations of known superstructures, which is in conflictwith $\lambda$cdm expectations. we find that the current planck polarizationdata do not reject that this signal could be caused by the isw effect. inaddition, the stacking of the planck lensing map on the superstructures'locations exhibits a positive cross-correlation with these large-scalestructures. finally, we have improved our previous reconstruction of the iswtemperature fluctuations by combining the information encoded in all thepreviously mentioned lss tracers. in particular, we construct a map of the iswsecondary anisotropies and the corresponding uncertainties map, obtained fromsimulations. we also explore the reconstruction of the isw anisotropies causedby the lss traced by the 2mpz survey, by directly inverting the density fieldinto the gravitational potential field.

1502.01599	planck 2015 results. xxviii. the planck catalogue of galactic cold  clumps	we present the planck catalogue of galactic cold clumps (pgcc), an all-skycatalogue of galactic cold clump candidates detected by planck. this catalogueis the full version of the early cold core (ecc) catalogue, which was madeavailable in 2011 with the early release compact source catalogue (ercsc) andcontained 915 high s/n sources. it is based on the planck 48 months missiondata that are currently being released to the astronomical community. the pgcccatalogue is an observational catalogue consisting exclusively of galactic coldsources. the three highest planck bands (857, 545, 353 ghz) have been combinedwith iras data at 3 thz to perform a multi-frequency detection of sourcescolder than their local environment. after rejection of possible extragalacticcontaminants, the pgcc catalogue contains 13188 galactic sources spread acrossthe whole sky, i.e., from the galactic plane to high latitudes, following thespatial distribution of the main molecular cloud complexes. the mediantemperature of pgcc sources lies between 13 and 14.5 k, depending on thequality of the flux density measurements, with a temperature ranging from 5.8to 20 k after removing sources with the 1% largest temperature estimates. usingseven independent methods, reliable distance estimates have been obtained for5574 sources, which allows us to derive their physical properties such as theirmass, physical size, mean density and luminosity. the pgcc sources are locatedmainly in the solar neighbourhood, up to a distance of 10.5 kpc towards thegalactic centre, and range from low-mass cores to large molecular clouds.because of this diversity and because the pgcc catalogue contains sources invery different environments, the catalogue is useful to investigate theevolution from molecular clouds to cores. finally, the catalogue also includes54 additional sources located in the smc and lmc.

1502.02114	planck 2015 results. xx. constraints on inflation	we present the implications for cosmic inflation of the planck measurementsof the cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropies in both temperature andpolarization based on the full planck survey. the planck full missiontemperature data and a first release of polarization data on large angularscales measure the spectral index of curvature perturbations to be$n_\mathrm{s} = 0.968 \pm 0.006$ and tightly constrain its scale dependence to$d n_s/d \ln k =-0.003 \pm 0.007$ when combined with the planck lensinglikelihood. when the high-$\ell$ polarization data is included, the results areconsistent and uncertainties are reduced. the upper bound on thetensor-to-scalar ratio is $r_{0.002} &lt; 0.11$ (95% cl), consistent with theb-mode polarization constraint $r&lt; 0.12$ (95% cl) obtained from a jointbicep2/keck array and planck analysis. these results imply that $v(\phi)\propto \phi^2$ and natural inflation are now disfavoured compared to modelspredicting a smaller tensor-to-scalar ratio, such as $r^2$ inflation. threeindependent methods reconstructing the primordial power spectrum areinvestigated. the planck data are consistent with adiabatic primordialperturbations. we investigate inflationary models producing an anisotropicmodulation of the primordial curvature power spectrum as well as generalizedmodels of inflation not governed by a scalar field with a canonical kineticterm. the 2015 results are consistent with the 2013 analysis based on thenominal mission data.

1502.05956	planck 2015 results. ix. diffuse component separation: cmb maps	we present foreground-reduced cmb maps derived from the full planck data setin both temperature and polarization. compared to the corresponding planck 2013temperature sky maps, the total data volume is larger by a factor of 3.2 forfrequencies between 30 and 70 ghz, and by 1.9 for frequencies between 100 and857 ghz. in addition, systematic errors in the forms oftemperature-to-polarization leakage, analogue-to-digital conversionuncertainties, and very long time constant errors have been dramaticallyreduced, to the extent that the cosmological polarization signal may now berobustly recovered on angular scales $\ell\gtrsim40$. on the very largestscales, instrumental systematic residuals are still non-negligible compared tothe expected cosmological signal, and modes with $\ell &lt; 20$ are accordinglysuppressed in the current polarization maps by high-pass filtering. as in 2013,four different cmb component separation algorithms are applied to theseobservations, providing a measure of stability with respect to algorithmic andmodelling choices. the resulting polarization maps have rms instrumental noiseranging between 0.21 and 0.27$\,\mu\textrm{k}$ averaged over 55 arcmin pixels,and between 4.5 and 6.1$\,\mu\textrm{k}$ averaged over 3.4 arcmin pixels. thecosmological parameters derived from the analysis of temperature power spectraare in agreement at the $1\sigma$ level with the planck 2015 likelihood.unresolved mismatches between the noise properties of the data and simulationsprevent a satisfactory description of the higher-order statistical propertiesof the polarization maps. thus, the primary applications of these polarizationmaps are those that do not require massive simulations for accurate estimationof uncertainties, for instance estimation of cross-spectra andcross-correlations, or stacking analyses.

1503.08773	planck intermediate results. xxvii. high-redshift infrared galaxy  overdensity candidates and lensed sources discovered by planck and confirmed  by herschel-spire	[abridged] we use the planck all-sky submm and mm maps to search for raresources distinguished by extreme brightness, a few hundreds of mjy, and theirpotential for being situated at high redshift. these "cold" planck sources,selected using the high frequency instrument (hfi) directly from the maps andfrom the planck catalogue of compact sources (pccs), all satisfy the criterionof having their rest-frame far-infrared peak redshifted to the frequency range353 and 857 ghz. this colour-selection favours galaxies in the redshift rangez=2-4, which we consider as cold peaks in the cosmic infrared background (cib).we perform a dedicated herschel-spire follow-up of 234 such planck targets,finding a significant excess of red 350 and 500um sources, in comparison toreference spire fields. about 94% of the spire sources in the planck fields areconsistent with being overdensities of galaxies peaking at 350um. about 3% arecandidate lensed systems, all 12 of which have secure spectroscopicconfirmations, placing them at redshifts z&gt;2.2. the galaxy overdensities aredetected with high significance, half of the sample showing statisticalsignificance above 10sigma. the spire photometric redshifts of galaxies inoverdensities suggest a peak at z~2. under the td=35k assumption, we derive aninfrared (ir) luminosity for each spire source of about 4x10^12 lsun, yieldingstar formation rates of typically 700 msun.yr^-1. if the observed overdensitiesare actual gravitationally-bound structures, the total total star formationrates reaches 7x10^3 msun.yr^-1. taken together, these sources show thesignatures of high-z (z&gt;$) protoclusters of intensively star-forming galaxies.all these observations confirm the uniqueness of our sample and demonstrate theability of the all-sky planck-hfi cold sources to select populations ofcosmological and astrophysical interest for structure formation studies.

1504.03339	planck intermediate results. xxxvii. evidence of unbound gas from the  kinetic sunyaev-zeldovich effect	by looking at the kinetic sunyaev-zeldovich effect (ksz) in planck nominalmission data, we present a significant detection of baryons participating inlarge-scale bulk flows around central galaxies (cgs) at redshift $z\approx0.1$. we estimate the pairwise momentum of the ksz temperature fluctuations atthe positions of the cgc (central galaxy catalogue) samples extracted fromsloan digital sky survey (dr7) data. for the foreground-cleaned maps, we find$1.8$-$2.5\sigma$ detections of the ksz signal, which are consistent with theksz evidence found in individual planck raw frequency maps, although lower thanfound in the wmap-9yr w band ($3.3\sigma$). we further reconstruct the peculiarvelocity field from the cg density field, and compute for the first time thecross-correlation function between ksz temperature fluctuations and estimatesof cg radial peculiar velocities. this correlation function yields a$3.0$-$3.7$$\sigma$ detection of the peculiar motion of extended gas on mpcscales, in flows correlated up to distances of 80-100 $h^{-1}$ mpc. both thepairwise momentum estimates and ksz temperature-velocity field correlation findevidence for ksz signatures out to apertures of 8 arcmin and beyond,corresponding to a physical radius of $&gt; 1$ mpc, more than twice the meanvirial radius of halos. this is consistent with the predictions from hydrosimulations that most of the baryons are outside the virialized halos. we fit asimple model, in which the temperature-velocity cross-correlation isproportional to the signal seen in a semi-analytic model built upon n-bodysimulations, and interpret the proportionality constant as an "effective"optical depth to thomson scattering. we find $\tau_t=(1.4\pm0.5)\times10^{-4}$; the simplest interpretation of this measurement is that much of thegas is in a diffuse phase, which contributes little signal to x-ray or thermalsz observations.

1505.02779	planck intermediate results. xxxviii. e- and b-modes of dust  polarization from the magnetized filamentary structure of the interstellar  medium	the quest for a b-mode imprint from primordial gravity waves on thepolarization of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) requires thecharacterization of foreground polarization from galactic dust. we present astatistical study of the filamentary structure of the 353 ghz planck stokesmaps at high galactic latitude, relevant to the study of dust emission as apolarized foreground to the cmb. we filter the intensity and polarization mapsto isolate filaments in the range of angular scales where the power asymmetrybetween e-modes and b-modes is observed. using the smoothed hessian major axisfilament finder, we identify 259 filaments at high galactic latitude, withlengths larger or equal to 2\deg\ (corresponding to 3.5 pc in length for atypical distance of 100 pc). these filaments show a preferred orientationparallel to the magnetic field projected onto the plane of the sky, derivedfrom their polarization angles. we present mean maps of the filaments in stokesi, q, u, e, and b, computed by stacking individual images rotated to align theorientations of the filaments. combining the stacked images and the histogramof relative orientations, we estimate the mean polarization fraction of thefilaments to be 11 %. furthermore, we show that the correlation between thefilaments and the magnetic field orientations may account for the e and basymmetry and the $c_{\ell}^{te}/c_{\ell}^{ee}$ ratio, reported in the powerspectra analysis of the planck 353 ghz polarization maps. future models of thedust foreground for cmb polarization studies will need to take into account theobserved correlation between the dust polarization and the structure ofinterstellar matter.

astro-ph;0002284	the extragalactic background and its fluctuations in the far-infrared  wavelengths	a cosmic far-infrared background (cfirb) has long been predicted that wouldtraces the intial phases of galaxy formation. it has been first detected bypuget et al.(1996) using cobe data and has been later confirmed by severalrecent studies (fixsen et al. 1998, hauser et al. 1998, lagache et al. 1999).we will present a new determination of the cfirb that uses for the first time,in addition to cobe data, two independent gas tracers: the hi survey ofleiden/dwingeloo (hartmann, 1998) and the wham h$_{\alpha}$ survey (reynolds etal 1998). we will see that the cfirb above 100 micron is now very wellconstrained. the next step is to see if we can detect its fluctuations. tosearch for the cfirb fluctuations, we have used the firback observations.firback is a deep cosmological survey conducted at 170 micron with isophot(dole et al., 2000). we show that the emission of unresolved extra-galacticsources clearly dominates, at arcminute scales, the background fluctuations inthe lowest galactic emission regions. this is the first detection of the cfirbfluctuations.

astro-ph;0010551	near-infrared imaging and [o~i] spectroscopy of ic 443 using 2mass and  iso	we present near-infrared j (1.25um), h (1.65um), and ks (2.17um) imaging ofthe entire supernova remnant ic 443 from the two micron all sky survey (2mass),and infrared space observatory (iso) lws observations of [o i]. near-infraredemission from ic 443 was detected in all three bands from most of the opticallybright parts of the remnant, revealing a shell-like morphology, with bright ksband emission along the southern ridge and bright j and h along thenortheastern rim. the color and morphological structure are very differentbetween the northeastern and southern parts. j and h band emission from thenortheast rim is comparably bright and can be explained mostly by [fe~ii] lineemission. the southern ridge is dominated by ks band light exhibiting a clumpedand knotty structure. molecular hydrogen lines can explain most of k$_s$ bandand at least half of j and h band emission in the south. hence, the prominentbroad-band color differences arise from physically different mechanisms: atomicfine structure lines along the northeastern rim and molecular ro-vibrationallines along the southern ridge. shock models imply a fast j-shock with vs~100km/s and 10&lt;n&lt;10^3 cm^-3 for the northeastern rim and a slow c-shock with vs\~30 km/s and n~10^{4} cm^{-3} for the southern ridge, respectively.

astro-ph;0103434	firback: iii. catalog, source counts, and cosmological implications of  the 170 micron iso deep survey	the firback (far infrared background) survey is one of the deepest imagingsurveys carried out at 170 microns with isophot onboard iso, and is aimed atthe study of the structure of the cosmic far infrared background. this paperprovides the analysis of resolved sources. after a validated process of datareduction and calibration, we perform intensive simulations to optimize thesource extraction, measure the confusion noise (sigma_c = 45 mjy), and give thephotometric and astrometric accuracies. 196 galaxies with flux s &gt; 3 sigma_care detected in the area of 3.89 square degrees. counts of sources with flux s&gt; 4 sigma_c present a steep slope of 3.3 +/- 0.6 on a differential "logn-logs"plot between 180 and 500 mjy. as a consequence, the confusion level is high andwill impact dramatically on future ir deep surveys. this strong evolution,compared with a slope of 2.5 from euclidian geometry, is in line with modelsimplying a strongly evolving luminous infrared galaxy population. the resolvedsources account for less than 10% of the cosmic infrared background at 170microns, which is expected to be resolved into sources in the 1 to 10 mjyrange.

astro-ph;0508154	first detection of dust emission in a high-velocity cloud	by comparing sensitive spitzer space telescope (sst) infrared and green banktelescope 21 cm observations, we are able to report the first detection of dustemission in complex c, the largest high velocity cloud in the sky. dust in theregion of complex c studied here has a colder temperature($t=10.7^{+0.9}_{-0.8}$ k - 1$\sigma$) than the local interstellar medium($t=17.5$ k), in accordance with its great distance from the galactic plane.based on the metallicity measurements and assuming diffuse galacticinterstellar medium dust properties and dust/metals ratio, this detection couldimply gas column densities more than 5 times higher than observed in hi. wesuggest that the dust emission detected here comes from small molecular clumps,spatially correlated with the hi but with a low surface filling factor. ourfindings imply that the hvcs' mass would be much larger than inferred from hiobservations and that most of the gas falling on the milky way would be in coldand dense clumps rather than in a diffuse phase.

astro-ph;0601633	spectacular spitzer images of the trifid nebula: protostars in a young,  massive-star-forming region	spitzer irac and mips images of the trifid nebula (m20) reveal itsspectacular appearance in infrared light, highlighting the nebula's specialevolutionary stage. the images feature recently-formed massive protostars andnumerous young stellar objects, and a single o star that illuminates thesurrounding molecular cloud from which it formed, and unveil large-scale,filamentary dark clouds. the hot dust grains show contrasting infrared colorsin shells, arcs, bow-shocks and dark cores. multiple protostars are detected inthe infrared, within the cold dust cores of tc3 and tc4, which were previouslydefined as class 0. the cold dust continuum cores of tc1 and tc2 contain onlyone protostar each. the spitzer color-color diagram allowed us to identify ~160young stellar objects and classify them into different evolutionary stages. thediagram also revealed a unique group of ysos which are bright at 24 micron buthave the spectral energy distribution peaking at 5-8 micron. despiteexpectation that class 0 sources would be "starless" cores, the spitzer images,with unprecedented sensitivity, uncover mid-infrared emission from these class0 protostars. the mid-infrared detections of class 0 protostars show that theemission escapes the dense, cold envelope of young protostars. the mid-infraredemission of the protostars can be fit by two temperatures of 150 and 400 k; thehot core region is probably optically thin in the mid-infrared regime, and thesize of hot core is much smaller than that of the cold envelope. the presenceof multiple protostars within the cold cores of class 0 objects implies thatclustering occurs at this early stage of star formation. the tc3 cluster showsthat the most massive star is located at the center of the cluster and at thebottom of the gravitational-potential well.

astro-ph;0604238	spitzer/irac and isocam/cvf insights on the origin of the near to mid-ir  galactic diffuse emission	we measure irac colors of extended emission in several fields covering arange of galactic latitudes and longitudes outside of star forming regions. wedetermine the nature of the galactic diffuse emission in spitzer/irac images bycombining them with spectroscopic data. we show that pah features make theemission in the irac 5.8 and 8.0 $\mu$m channels, whereas the 3.3 $\mu$mfeature represents only 20 to 50% of the irac 3.6 $\mu$m channel. a nircontinuum is necessary to account for irac 4.5 $\mu$m emission and theremaining fraction of the irac 3.6 $\mu$m emission. this continuum cannot beaccounted by scattered light. it represents 9% of the total power absorbed bypahs and 120% of the interstellar uv photon flux. the 3.3 $\mu$m feature isobserved to vary from field-to-field with respect to the irac 8.0 $\mu$mchannel. the continuum and 3.3 $\mu$m feature intensities are not correlated.we present model calculations which relate our measurements of the pahsspectral energy distribution to the particles size and ionization state. cationand neutral pahs emission properties are inferred empirically from\object{ngc7023} observations. pahs caracteristics are best constrained in aline of sight towards the inner galaxy, dominated by the cold neutral mediumphase : we find that the pah cation fraction is about 50% and that their meansize is about 60 carbon atoms. a significant field-to-field dispersion in thepah mean size, from 40 to 80 carbon atoms, is necessary to account for theobserved variations in the 3.3 $\mu$m feature intensity relative to the irac8.0 $\mu$m flux. however, one cannot be secure about the feature interpretationas long as the continuum origin remains unclear.

astro-ph;0608655	dust in high-velocity clouds : relevance for planck	the recent detection of dust emission in complex c, the largest high-velocitycloud (hvc) on the sky, opens a very interesting perspective for planck. thehvc dust temperature determined using iras and spitzer observations is low(t~10.7 k) in accordance with its great distance from the galaxy (&gt; 5 kpc).peak column density in 30 arcmin beam is nh ~10^20 cm-2 which is typical ofhvcs and similar to cirrus column density in diffuse regions. on the other handhvcs appear to be very clumpy at smaller angular scales; several observationsat the arcminute scale resolution show significant structure and higherbrightness contrasts than in typical cirrus emission. in this contribution weshow that, even with their moderate column density, the cold temperature, highemissivity and high column density contrast of hvcs should lead to significantand detectable emission in the planck-hfi frequency range. in order to separatethe hvc emission from the galactic cirrus emission, the use of 21 cmobservations will be mandatory.

astro-ph;0609133	shock processing of interstellar dust and polycyclic aromatic  hydrocarbons in the supernova remnant n132d	we observed the oxygen-rich large magellanic cloud (lmc) supernova remnantn132d (snr 0525-69.6), using all instruments onboard the spitzer spacetelescope, irs, irac, and mips (infrared spectrograph, infrared array camera,multiband imaging photometer for spitzer). the 5-40 micron irs spectra towardthe southeastern shell of the remnant show a steeply rising continuum with[neiii] and [oiv] as well as pah emission. we also present the spectrum of afast moving ejecta knot, previously detected at optical wavelengths, which isdominated by strong [neiii] and [oiv] emission lines. we interpret thecontinuum as thermal emission from swept-up, shock-heated dust grains in theexpanding shell of n132d, which is clearly visible in the mips 24 micron image.a 15-20 micron emission hump appears superposed on the dust continuum, and weattribute this to pah c-c-c bending modes. we also detect the well-known 11.3micron pah c-h bending feature, and find the integrated strength of the 15-20micron hump about a factor of seven stronger than the 11.3 micron band in theshell of the remnant. irac 3-9 micron images do not show clear evidence oflarge-scale, shell-like emission from the remnant, partly due to confusion withthe ambient ism material. however, we identified several knots of shockedinterstellar gas based on their distinct infrared colors. we discuss the brightinfrared continuum and the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon features withrespect to dust processing in young supernova remnants.

astro-ph;0610562	the spitzer spirals, bridges, and tails interacting galaxy survey:  interaction-induced star formation in the mid-infrared	we present spitzer mid-infrared imaging of a sample of 35 tidally-distortedpre-merger interacting galaxy pairs selected from the arp atlas. we comparetheir global mid-infrared properties with those of normal galaxies from thesings spitzer legacy survey, and separate the disk emission from that of thetidal features. the [8.0 micron] - [24 micron], [3.6 micron] - [24 micron], and[5.8 micron] - [8.0 micron] colors of these optically-selected interactinggalaxies are redder on average than those of spirals, implying enhancements tothe mass-normalized star formation rates (sfrs) of a factor of ~2. furthermore,the 24 micron emission in the arp galaxies is more centrally concentrated thanthat in the spirals, suggesting that gas is being concentrated into the innerregions and fueling central star formation. no significant differences can bediscerned in the shorter wavelength spitzer colors of the arp galaxies comparedto the spirals, thus these quantities are less sensitive to star formationenhancements. no strong trend of spitzer color with pair separation is visiblein our sample; this may be because our sample was selected to be tidallydisturbed. the tidal features contribute &lt;10% of the total spitzer fluxes onaverage. the sfrs implied for the arp galaxies by the spitzer 24 micronluminosities are relatively modest, ~1 m(sun)/yr on average.

astro-ph;0610838	spitzer irac images and sample spectra of cassiopeia a's explosion	we present spitzer irac images, along with representative 5.27 to 38.5 micronirs spectra of the cassiopeia a supernova remnant. we find that various iracchannels are each most sensitive to a different spectral and physicalcomponent. channel 1 (3.6 micron) matches radio synchrotron images. wherechannel 1 is strong with respect to the other channels, the longer-wavelengthspectra show a broad continuum gently peaking around 26 micron, with weak or nolines. we suggest that this is due to un-enriched progenitor circumstellar dustbehind the outer shock, processed by shock photons and electrons. where channel4 (8 micron) is bright relative to the other irac channels, the long-wavelengthspectra show a strong, 2-3 micron-wide peak at 21 micron, likely due tosilicates and proto-silicates, as well as strong ionic lines of [ar ii], [ariii], [s iv] and [ne ii]. in these locations, the dust and ionic emissionoriginate from the explosion's o-burning layers. the regions where channels 2(4.5 micron) and 3 (5.6 micron) are strongest relative to channel 4 show aspectrum that rises gradually to 21 micron, and then flattens or rises moreslowly to longer wavelengths, along with higher ratios of [ne ii] to [ar ii].dust and ionic emission in these locations arise primarily from the c- and ne-burning layers. these findings are consistent with asymmetries in the explosionproducing variations in the velocity structure in different directions, butpreserving the nucleosynthetic layers. at each location, the dust and ioniclines in the mid-infrared, and the hotter and more highly ionized optical andx-ray emission are then dominated by the layer currently encountering thereverse shock in that direction.

astro-ph;0702240	first space-based microlens parallax measurement: spitzer observations  of ogle-2005-smc-001	we combine spitzer and ground-based observations to measure the microlensparallax of ogle-2005-smc-001, the first such space-based determination sinces. refsdal proposed the idea in 1966. the parallax measurement yields aprojected velocity \tilde v ~ 230 km/s, the typical value expected for halolenses, but an order of magnitude smaller than would be expected for lenseslying in the small magellanic cloud (smc) itself. the lens is a weak (i.e.,non-caustic-crossing) binary, which complicates the analysis considerably butultimately contributes additional constraints. using a test proposed by assefet al. (2006), which makes use only of kinematic information about differentpopulations but does not make any assumptions about their respective massfunctions, we find that the likelihood ratio is l_halo/l_smc = 20. hence, halolenses are strongly favored but smc lenses are not definitively ruled out.similar spitzer observations of additional lenses toward the magellanic cloudswould clarify the nature of the lens population. the space interferometrymission could make even more constraining measurements.

astro-ph;9504056	far-infrared spectral observations of the galaxy by cobe	we derive galactic continuum spectra from 5-96/cm from cobe/firasobservations. the spectra are dominated by warm dust emission, which may be fitwith a single temperature in the range 16-21 k (for nu^2 emissivity) along eachline of sight. dust heated by the attenuated radiation field in molecularclouds gives rise to intermediate temperature (10-14 k) emission in the innergalaxy only. a widespread, very cold component (4-7 k) with optical depth thatis spatially correlated with the warm component is also detected. the coldcomponent is unlikely to be due to very cold dust shielded from starlight,because it is present at high latitude. we consider hypotheses that the coldcomponent is due to enhanced submillimeter emissivity of the dust that givesrise to the warm component, or that it may be due to very small, large, orfractal particles. lack of substantial power above the emission from warm dustplaces strong constraints on the amount of cold gas in the galaxy. themicrowave sky brightness due to interstellar dust is dominated by the coldcomponent, and its angular variation could limit our ability to discernprimordial fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation.

astro-ph;9509151	high-latitude galactic emission in the cobe dmr two-year sky maps	we cross-correlate the cobe-dmr 2-year sky maps with spatial templates fromlong-wavelength radio surveys and the far-infrared cobe dirbe maps. we place anupper limit on the spectral index of synchrotron radiation beta_{synch} &lt; -2.9between 408 mhz and 31.5 ghz. we obtain a statistically significantcross-correlation with the dirbe maps whose dependence on the dmr frequenciesindicates a superposition of dust and free-free emission. the high-latitudedust emission (|b| &gt; 30 deg) is well fitted by a single dust component withtemperature t = 18 (+3, -7) k and emissivity epsilon ~ nu^beta with beta = 1.9(+3.0, -0.5). the free-free emission is spatially correlated with the dust onangular scales larger than the 7 degree dmr beam, with rms variations 5.3 +/-1.8 uk at 53 ghz and angular power spectrum p ~ ell^{-3}. if this correlationpersists to smaller angular scales, free-free emission should not be asignificant contaminant to measurements of the cosmic microwave anisotropy atdegree angular scales for frequencies above 20 ghz.

astro-ph;9805323	the cobe diffuse infrared background experiment search for the cosmic  infrared background: iii. separation of galactic emission from the infrared  sky brightness	the cosmic infrared background (cib) is hidden behind veils of foregroundemission from our own solar system and galaxy. this paper describes proceduresfor removing the galactic ir emission from the 1.25 - 240 micron cobe dirbemaps as steps toward the ultimate goal of detecting the cib. the galacticemission models are carefully chosen and constructed so that the isotropic cibis completely retained in the residual sky maps. we start with dirbe data fromwhich the scattered light and thermal emission of the interplanetary dust (ipd)cloud have already been removed. locations affected by the emission from brightcompact and stellar sources are excluded from the analysis. the unresolvedemission of faint stars at near- and mid-ir wavelengths is represented by amodel based on galactic source counts. the 100 micron dirbe observations areused as the spatial template for the interstellar medium (ism) emission at highlatitudes. correlation of the 100 micron data with h i column density allows usto isolate the component of the observed emission that is associated with theism. limits are established on the far-ir emissivity of the diffuse ionizedmedium, which indicate a lower emissivity per h nucleus than in the neutralmedium. at 240 micron, we find that adding a second spatial template to the ismmodel can greatly improve the accuracy of the model at low latitudes. thecrucial product of this analysis is a set of all-sky ir maps from which thegalactic (and ipd) emission has been removed. we discuss systematicuncertainties and potential errors in the foreground subtraction process thatmay have an impact on studies seeking to detect the cib in the residual maps.

astro-ph;9806167	the cobe diffuse infrared background experiment search for the cosmic  infrared background: i. limits and detections	the dirbe on the cobe spacecraft was designed primarily to conduct systematicsearch for an isotropic cib in ten photometric bands from 1.25 to 240 microns.the results of that search are presented here. conservative limits on the cibare obtained from the minimum observed brightness in all-sky maps at eachwavelength, with the faintest limits in the dirbe spectral range being at 3.5microns (\nu i_\nu &lt; 64 nw/m^2/sr, 95% cl) and at 240 microns (\nu i_\nu &lt; 28nw/m^2/sr, 95% cl). the bright foregrounds from interplanetary dust scatteringand emission, stars, and interstellar dust emission are the principalimpediments to the dirbe measurements of the cib. these foregrounds have beenmodeled and removed from the sky maps. assessment of the random and systematicuncertainties in the residuals and tests for isotropy show that only the 140and 240 microns data provide candidate detections of the cib. the residuals andtheir uncertainties provide cib upper limits more restrictive than the dark skylimits at wavelengths from 1.25 to 100 microns. no plausible solar system orgalactic source of the observed 140 and 240 microns residuals can beidentified, leading to the conclusion that the cib has been detected at levelsof \nu i_\nu = 25+-7 and 14+-3 nw/m^2/sr at 140 and 240 microns respectively.the integrated energy from 140 to 240 microns, 10.3 nw/m^2/sr, is about twicethe integrated optical light from the galaxies in the hubble deep field,suggesting that star formation might have been heavily enshrouded by dust athigh redshift. the detections and upper limits reported here provide newconstraints on models of the history of energy-releasing processes and dustproduction since the decoupling of the cosmic microwave background from matter.

astro-ph;9806250	the cobe diffuse infrared background experiment search for the cosmic  infrared background: ii. model of the interplanetary dust cloud	the cobe diffuse infrared background experiment (dirbe) was designed tosearch for the cosmic infrared background (cib) radiation. scattered light andthermal emission from the interplanetary dust (ipd) are major contributors tothe diffuse sky brightness at most infrared wavelengths. accurate removal ofthis zodiacal light foreground is a necessary step toward a direct measurementof the cib. the zodiacal light foreground contribution in each of the 10 dirbewavelength bands ranging from 1.25 to 240 microns is distinguished by itsapparent seasonal variation over the whole sky. this contribution has beenextracted by fitting the brightness calculated from a parameterized physicalmodel to the time variation of the all-sky dirbe measurements over 10 months ofobservations. the model brightness is evaluated as the integral along the lineof sight of the product of a source function and a three-dimensional dustdensity distribution function. the dust density distribution is composed ofmultiple components: a smooth cloud, three asteroidal dust bands, and acircumsolar ring near 1 a.u. by using a directly measurable quantity whichrelates only to the ipd cloud, we exclude other contributors to the skybrightness from the ipd model. using the ipd model described here, high-qualitymaps of the infrared sky with the zodiacal foreground removed have beengenerated. imperfections in the model reveal themselves as low-level systematicartifacts in the residual maps which correlate with components of the ipd. themost evident of these artifacts are located near the ecliptic plane in themid-infrared, and are less than 2% of the zodiacal foreground brightness.uncertainties associated with the model are discussed, including implicationsfor the cib search.

astro-ph;9812039	firback: i. a deep survey at 175 $\mu$m with iso, preliminary results	firback is a deep survey conducted with the isophot instrument aboard theinfrared space observatory (iso) at an effective wavelength of 175 $\mu$m. wepresent here results we have obtained on the first field, the so-called marano1which covers around 0.25 square degree. we find that the source density forobjects with a flux above 200 mjy exceeds the counts expected for sources foundin the iras deep surveys with a similar flux by about an order of magnitude.such an excess was expected on the basis of the high far infrared backgrounddetected with the firas and dirbe instruments aboard the cosmic backgroundexplorer (cobe). these sources are likely to be redshifted infrared galaxies.the steep number counts indicate strong cosmological evolution in thispopulation. the detected sources account for only 10 % of the cosmic irbackground. an extrapolation of the counts down to about 10 mjy would beneedeed to account for the whole background at this wavelength.

astro-ph;9901267	a deep 12 micron survey with iso	we present the first results of a study of faint 12 micron sources detectedwith the infrared space observatory (iso) in four deep, high galactic latitudefields. the sample includes 50 such sources in an area of 0.1 square degreesdown to a 5 sigma flux limit of about 500 microjy. from optical identificationsbased on the us naval observatory (usno) catalogue and analysis of theoptical/ir colours and digital sky survey (dss) images, we conclude that 37 ofthese objects are galaxies and 13 are stars. we derive galaxy number counts andcompare them with existing iras counts at 12 microns, and with models of the 12micron source population. in particular, we find evidence for significantevolution in the galaxy population, with the no-evolution case excluded at the3.5 sigma level. the stellar population is well matched by existing models. twoof the objects detected at 12 micron are associated with known galaxies. one ofthese is an iras galaxy at z=0.11 with a luminosity of 10^11 l_sun.

astro-ph;9905108	dust in the local interstellar wind	the gas-to-dust mass ratios found for interstellar dust within the solarsystem, versus values determined astronomically for the cloud around the solarsystem, suggest that large and small interstellar grains have separatehistories, and that large interstellar grains preferentially detected byspacecraft are not formed exclusively by mass exchange with nearby interstellargas. observations by the ulysses and galileo satellites of the mass spectrumand flux rate of interstellar dust within the heliosphere are combined withinformation about the density, composition, and relative flow speed anddirection of interstellar gas in the cloud surrounding the solar system toderive an in situ value for the gas-to-dust mass ratio, $r_{g/d} =94^{+46}_{-38}$. hubble observations of the cloud surrounding the solar systemyield a gas-to-dust mass ratio of rg/d=551+61-251 when b-star referenceabundances are assumed. the exclusion of small dust grains from the heliosheathand heliosphere regions are modeled, increasing the discrepancy betweeninterstellar and in situ observations. the shock destruction of interstellargrains is considered, and comparisons are made with interplanetary and presolardust grains.
