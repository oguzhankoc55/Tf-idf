0902.0983	short versus long gamma-ray bursts: spectra, energetics, and  luminosities	we compare the spectral properties of 79 short and 79 long gamma-ray bursts(grbs) detected by batse and selected with the same limiting peak flux. shortgrbs have a low-energy spectral component harder and a peak energy slightlyhigher than long grbs, but no difference is found when comparing short grbspectra with those of the first 1-2 sec emission of long grbs. these resultsconfirm earlier findings for brighter grbs. the bolometric peak flux of shortgrbs correlates with their peak energy in a similar way to long bursts. shortand long grbs populate different regions of the bolometric fluence-peak energyplane, short bursts being less energetic by a factor similar to the ratio oftheir durations. if short and long grbs had similar redshift distributions,they would have similar luminosities yet different energies, which correlatewith the peak energy e_peak for the population of long grbs. we also testwhether short grbs are consistent with the e_peak-e_iso and e_peak-l_isocorrelations for the available sample of short (6 events) and long (92 events)grbs with measured redshifts and e_peak,obs: while short grbs are inconsistentwith the e_peak-e_iso correlation of long grbs, they could follow thee_peak-l_iso correlation of long bursts. all the above indications point toshort grbs being similar to the first phases of long bursts. this suggests thata similar central engine (except for its duration) operates in grbs ofdifferent durations.

0907.1527	probing variability patterns of the fe k line complex in bright nearby  agns	the unprecedented sensitivity of current x-ray telescopes allows for thefirst time to address the issue of the fe k line complex variability patternsin bright, nearby agns. we examine xmm-newton observations of the brightestsources of the fero sample of radio-quiet type 1 agns with the aim ofcharacterizing the temporal behaviour of fe k complex features. a systematicmapping of residual flux above and below the continuum in the 4-9 kev range isperformed in the time vs energy domain, with the purpose of identifyinginteresting spectral features in the three energy bands: 5.4-6.1 kev, 6.1-6.8kev and 6.8-7.2 kev, corresponding respectively to the redshifted, rest frameand blueshifted or highly ionized fe kalpha line bands. the variabilitysignificance is assessed by extracting light curves and comparing them withmontecarlo simulations. the time-averaged profile of the fe k complex revealedspectral complexity in several observations. red- and blue-shifted components(either in emission or absorption) were observed in 30 out of 72 observations,with an average &lt;ew&gt;~90 ev for emission and &lt;ew&gt;~ -30 ev for absorptionfeatures. we detected significant line variability (with confidence levelsranging between 90% and 99.7%) within at least one of the above energy bands in26 out of 72 observations on time scales of ~6-30 ks. reliability of thesefeatures has been carefully calculated using this sample and has been assessedat ~3sigma confidence level. this work increases the currently scanty number ofdetections of variable, energy shifted, fe lines and confirms the reliabilityof the claimed detections. we found that the distribution of detected featuresis peaked at high variability significances in the red- and blue-shifted energybands, suggesting an origin in a relativistically modified accretion flow.

0907.4157	testing a new view of gamma ray burst afterglows	the optical and x-ray light-curves of long gamma ray bursts (grbs) often showa complex evolution and in most cases do not track each other. this behaviourcan not be easily explained by the simplest standard afterglow models. apossible interpretation is to consider the observed optical and x-raylight-curves as the sum of two separate components. this scenario requires thepresence of a spectral break between these bands. one of the aims of this workis to test whether such a break is present within the observed swift xrt energyrange. we analyse the x-ray afterglow spectra of a sample of 33 long grbs withknown redshift, good optical photometry and published estimate of the hostgalaxy dust absorption a_v(host). we find that indeed in 7 bright events abroken power-law provides a fit to the data that is better than a singlepower-law model. for 8 events, instead, the x-ray spectrum is better fitted bya single power-law. we discuss the role of these breaks in connection to therelation between the host hydrogen column density n_h(host) and a_v(host) andcheck the consistency of the x-ray spectral breaks with the optical bandsphotometry. we analyse the optical to x-ray spectral energy distributions atdifferent times and find again consistency with two components interpretation.

0907.5203	time resolved spectral behavior of bright batse precursors	aims: gamma ray bursts (grbs) are sometimes preceded by dimmer emissionepisodes, called "precursors", whose nature is still a puzzle: they couldeither have the same origin as the main emission episode or they could be dueto another mechanism. we investigate if precursors have some spectraldistinctive feature with respect to the main grb episodes. methods: to this aimwe compare the spectral evolution of the precursor with that of the main grbevent. we also study if and how the spectral parameters, and in particular thepeak of the vfv spectrum of time resolved spectra, correlates with the flux.this allows us to test if the spectra of the precursor and of the main eventbelong to the same correlation (if any). we searched grbs with precursoractivity in the complete sample of 2704 bursts detected by batse finding that12% of grbs have one or more precursors. among these we considered the burstswith time resolved spectral analysis performed by kaneko et al. 2006, selectingthose having at least two time resolved spectra for the precursor. results: wefind that precursors and main events have very similar spectral properties. thespectral evolution within precursors has similar trends as the spectralevolution observed in the subsequent peaks. also the typical spectralparameters of the precursors are similar to those of the main grb events.moreover, in several cases we find that within the precursors the peak energyof the spectrum is correlated with the flux similarly to what happens in themain grb event. this strongly favors models in which the precursor is due tothe same fireball physics of the main emission episodes.

0909.0932	general physical properties of bright fermi blazars	we studied all blazars of known redshift detected by the fermi satelliteduring its first three months survey. for the majority of them, pointed swiftobservations ensures a good multiwavelength coverage, enabling us to toreliably construct their spectral energy distributions (sed). we model the sedsusing a one-zone leptonic model and study the distributions of the derivedinteresting physical parameters as a function of the observed gamma-rayluminosity. we confirm previous findings concerning the relation of thephysical parameters with source luminosity which are at the origin of theblazar sequence. the seds allow to estimate the luminosity of the accretiondisk for the majority of broad emitting line blazars, while for the line-lessbl lac objects in the sample upper limits can be derived. we find a positivecorrelation between the jet power and the luminosity of the accretion disk inbroad line blazars. in these objects we argue that the jet must beproton-dominated, and that the total jet power is of the same order of (orslightly larger than) the disk luminosity. we discuss two alternative scenariosto explain this result.

0910.2459	gev emission from gamma ray bursts: a radiative fireball?	we study the emission observed at energies greater than 100 mev of 11 gammaray bursts (grbs) detected by the fermi/large area telescope (lat) untiloctober 2009. the gev emission has three main properties: (i) its duration isoften longer than the duration of the softer emission detected by the gammaburst monitor (gbm) onboard fermi [this confirms earlier results from theenergetic gamma-ray experiment telescope (egret)]; (ii) its spectrum isconsistent with f(v) propto v^(-1) and does not show strong spectral evolution;(iii) for the brightest bursts, the flux detected by the lat decays as a powerlaw with a typical slope: t^(-1.5). we argue that the observed &gt;0.1 gev fluxcan be interpreted as afterglow emission shortly following the start of theprompt phase emission as seen at smaller frequencies. the decay slope is whatexpected if the fireball emission is produced in the radiative regime, i.e. alldissipated energy is radiated away. we also argue that the detectability in thegev energy range depends on the bulk lorentz factor gamma of the bursts, beingstrongly favoured in the case of large gamma. this implies that the fraction ofbursts detected at high energies corresponds to the fraction of bursts havingthe largest gamma. the radiative interpretation can help to explain why theobserved x-ray and optical afterglow energetics are much smaller than theenergetics emitted during the prompt phase, despite the fact that the collisionwith the external medium should be more efficient than internal shocks inproducing the radiation we see.

1004.1410	spectral properties of long and short gamma-ray bursts: comparison  between batse and fermi bursts	we compare the spectral properties of 227 gamma ray bursts (grbs) detected bythe fermi gamma ray burst monitor (gbm) up to february 2010 with those ofbursts detected by the cgro/batse instrument. out of 227 fermi grbs, 166 have ameasured peak energy e_peak_obs of their \nuf(\nu) spectrum: of these 146 and20 belong the long and short class, respectively. fermi long bursts follow thecorrelations defined by batse bursts between their e_peak_obs vs fluence andpeak flux: as already shown for the latter ones, these correlations and theirslopes do not originate from instrumental selection effects. fermi/gbm burstsextend such correlations toward lower fluence/peak energy values with respectto batse ones whereas no gbm long burst with e_peak_obs exceeding a few mev isfound, despite the possibility of detecting them. again as for batse, $\sim$ 5%of long and almost all short grbs detected by fermi/gbm are outliers of thee_peak-isotropic equivalent energy ("amati") correlation while no outlier(neither long nor short) of the e_peak-isotropic equivalent luminosity("yonetoku") correlation is found. fermi long bursts have similar typicalvalues of e_peak_obs but a harder low energy spectral index with respect to allbatse events, exacerbating the inconsistency with the limiting slopes of thesimplest synchrotron emission models. although the short grbs detected by fermiare still only a few, we confirm that their e_peak_obs is greater and the lowenergy spectrum is harder than those of long ones. we discuss the robustness ofthese results with respect to observational biases induced by the differencesbetween the gbm and batse instruments.

1004.2352	gamma-ray spectral evolution of ngc1275 observed with fermi-lat	we report on a detailed investigation of the high-energy gamma-ray emissionfrom ngc\,1275, a well-known radio galaxy hosted by a giant elliptical locatedat the center of the nearby perseus cluster. with the increased photonstatistics, the center of the gamma-ray emitting region is now measured to beseparated by only 0.46' from the nucleus of ngc1275, well within the 95%confidence error circle with radius ~1.5'. early fermi-lat observationsrevealed a significant decade-timescale brightening of ngc1275 at gev photonenergies, with a flux about seven times higher than the one implied by theupper limit from previous egret observations. with the accumulation of one-yearof fermi-lat all-sky-survey exposure, we now detect flux and spectralvariations of this source on month timescales, as reported in this paper. theaverage &gt;100 mev gamma-ray spectrum of ngc1275 shows a possible deviation froma simple power-law shape, indicating a spectral cut-off around an observedphoton energy of e = 42.2+-19.6 gev, with an average flux of f = (2.31+-0.13) x10^{-7} ph/cm^2/s and a power-law photon index, gamma = 2.13+-0.02. the largestgamma-ray flaring event was observed in april--may 2009 and was accompanied bysignificant spectral variability above e &gt; 1-2 gev. the gamma-ray activity ofngc1275 during this flare can be described by a hysteresis behavior in the fluxversus photon index plane. the highest energy photon associated with thegamma-ray source was detected at the very end of the observation, with theobserved energy of e = 67.4gev and an angular separation of about 2.4' from thenucleus. in this paper we present the details of the fermi-lat data analysis,and briefly discuss the implications of the observed gamma-ray spectralevolution of ngc1275 in the context of gamma-ray blazar sources in general.

1107.3370	broad line radio galaxies observed with fermi-lat: the origin of the gev  gamma-ray emission	we report on a detailed investigation of the gamma-ray emission from 18 broadline radio galaxies (blrgs) based on two years of fermi large area telescope(lat) data. we confirm the previously reported detections of 3c 120 and 3c 111in the gev photon energy range; a detailed look at the temporal characteristicsof the observed gamma-ray emission reveals in addition possible fluxvariability in both sources. no statistically significant gamma-ray detectionof the other blrgs was however found in the considered dataset. though thesample size studied is small, what appears to differentiate 3c 111 and 3c 120from the blrgs not yet detected in gamma-rays is the particularly strongnuclear radio flux. this finding, together with the indications of thegamma-ray flux variability and a number of other arguments presented, indicatethat the gev emission of blrgs is most likely dominated by the beamed radiationof relativistic jets observed at intermediate viewing angles. in this paper wealso analyzed a comparison sample of high accretion-rate seyfert 1 galaxies,which can be considered radio-quiet counterparts of blrgs, and found none weredetected in gamma-rays. a simple phenomenological hybrid model applied for thebroad-band emission of the discussed radio-loud and radio-quiet type 1 activegalaxies suggests that the relative contribution of the nuclear jets to theaccreting matter is &gt; 1 percent on average for blrgs, whilst &lt;0.1 percent forseyfert 1 galaxies.

1107.4302	implications for the structure of the relativistic jet from  multiwavelength observations of ngc 6251	ngc 6251 is a luminous radio galaxy ~104 mpc away that was detectedsignificantly with the fermi gamma-ray space telescope, and before that withegret (onboard the compton gamma-ray observatory). different observationalconstraints favor a nuclear origin for the gamma-ray emission. here we presenta study of the spectral energy distribution (sed) of the core of ngc 6251, andgive results of modeling in the one-zone synchrotron/ssc framework. the sscmodel provides a good description of the radio to gamma-ray emission but, asfor other misaligned sources, predicts a lower lorentz factor (\gamma~2.4) thantypically found when modeling blazars. if the blazar unification scenario iscorrect, this seems to point to the presence of at least two emitting regionsin these objects, one with a higher and one with a lower lorentz factor. thesolution of a structured jet, with a fast moving spine surrounded by a slowlayer, is explored and the consequences of the two models for the jetenergetics and evolution are discussed.

1209.5867	radio-to-gamma-ray monitoring of the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy pmn  j0948+0022 from 2008 to 2011	we present more than three years of observations at different frequencies,from radio to high-energy gamma-rays, of the narrow-line seyfert 1 (nls1)galaxy pmn j0948+0022 (z=0.585). this source is the first nls1 detected atenergies above 100 mev and therefore can be considered the prototype of thisemerging new class of gamma-ray emitting active galactic nuclei (agn). theobservations performed from 2008 august 1 to 2011 december 31 confirmed thatpmn j0948+0022 generates a powerful relativistic jet, able to develop anisotropic luminosity at gamma-rays of the order of 10^48 erg s^-1, at the levelof powerful quasars. the evolution of the radiation emission of this source in2009 and 2010 followed the canonical expectations of relativistic jets, withcorrelated multiwavelength variability (gamma-rays followed by radio emissionafter a few months), but it was difficult to retrieve a similar pattern in thelight curves of 2011. the comparison of gamma-ray spectra before and including2011 data suggested that there was a softening of the high-energy spectralslope. we selected five specific epochs to be studied by modelling thebroad-band spectrum, characterised by an outburst at gamma-rays or verylow/high flux at other wavelengths. the observed variability can largely beexplained either by changes in the injected power, the bulk lorentz factor ofthe jet or the electron spectrum. the characteristic time scale ofdoubling/halving flux ranges from a few days to a few months, depending on thefrequency and the sampling rate. the shortest doubling time scale at gamma-raysis 2.3+-0.5 days. these small values underline the need of highly-sampledmultiwavelength campaigns to better understand the physics of these sources.

1211.2806	afterglow emission in gamma-ray bursts: i. pair-enriched ambient medium  and radiative blast waves	forward shocks caused by the interaction between a relativistic blast waveand the circum-burst medium are thought to be responsible for the afterglowemission in gamma-ray bursts (grbs). we consider the hydrodynamics of aspherical relativistic blast wave expanding into the surrounding medium and wegeneralize the standard theory in order to account for several effects that aregenerally ignored. in particular, we consider the role of adiabatic andradiative losses on the hydrodynamical evolution of the shock, under theassumption that the cooling losses are fast. our model can describe adiabatic,fully radiative and semi-radiative blast waves, and can describe the effects ofa time-varying radiative efficiency. the equations we present are valid forarbitrary density profiles, and also for a circum-burst medium enriched withelectron-positron pairs. the presence of pairs enhances the fraction of shockenergy gained by the leptons, thus increasing the importance of radiativelosses. our model allows to study whether the high-energy (&gt;0.1 gev) emissionin grbs may originate from afterglow radiation. in particular, it is suitableto test whether the fast decay of the high-energy light curve observed inseveral fermi lat grbs can be ascribed to an initial radiative phase, followedby the standard adiabatic evolution.

1308.5442	a hint to the origin of the extended emission in lat grbs: the relation  between lat luminosity and prompt energetics	we consider the 0.1-10 gev rest frame light curves of 10 grbs detected by latand with known redshift. in all cases the emission persists after the prompthas faded away. this extended emission decays in time as a power-law. the decayslope is similar among different bursts, while the normalization spans morethan 2 decades. however, when the lat luminosity is normalized to the 1 kev-10mev energetics of the prompt emission e_iso all light curves become consistentwith having the same normalization, i.e. they cluster. at each given time theratio between the lat luminosity and the prompt energetics is narrowlydistributed. we argue that this result is expected in the external shockscenario and it strengthens the interpretation of the gev emission in terms ofradiation from external shocks. in this context, we derive limits on thedistribution of epsilon_e (the fraction of the shock energy that goes intoelectrons) and eta (the efficiency of the mechanism producing the prompt).

0802.0787	long gamma-ray bursts and their host galaxies at high redshift	motivated by the recent observational and theoretical evidence that longgamma-ray bursts (grbs) are likely associated with low metallicity, rapidlyrotating massive stars, we examine the cosmological star formation rate (sfr)below a critical metallicity z_crit z_sun/10 - z_sun/5, to estimate the eventrate of high-redshift long grb progenitors. to this purpose, we exploit agalaxy formation scenario already successfully tested on a wealth ofobservational data on (proto)spheroids, lyman break galaxies, lyman alphaemitters, submm galaxies, quasars, and local early-type galaxies. we find thatthe predicted rate of long grbs amounts to about 300 events/yr/sr, of whichabout 30 per cent occur at z&gt;~6. correspondingly, the grb number counts wellagree with the bright swift data, without the need for an intrinsic luminosityevolution. moreover, the above framework enables us to predict properties ofthe grb host galaxies. most grbs are associated with low mass galaxy halosm_h&lt;~10^11 m_sun, and effectively trace the formation of small galaxies in suchhalos. the hosts are young, with age smaller than 5*10^7 yr, gas rich, butpoorly extincted (a_v&lt;~0.1) because of their chemical immaturity; this alsoimplies high specific sfr and quite extreme alpha-enhancement. only theminority of hosts residing in large halos with m_h&gt;~10^12 m_sun have largerextinction (a_v~0.7-1), sfrs exceeding 100 m_sun/yr and can be detected atsubmm wavelengths. most of the hosts have uv magnitudes in the range -20&lt;~m_1350&lt;~ -16, and lyman alpha luminosity in the range 2*10^40&lt;~l_lya&lt;~2*10^42 erg/s. grb hosts are thus tracing the faint end of theluminosity function of lyman break galaxies and lyman alpha emitters.

1311.7147	radio-loud agns at high redshifts and the cosmic microwave background	we discuss how the interaction between the electrons in a relativistic jetand the cosmic microwave background (cmb) affects the observable properties ofradio-loud agn at early epochs. at high z the magnetic energy density in theradio lobes of powerful radio-loud quasars can be exceeded by the energydensity of the cmb (because of its (1+z)^4 dependance). in this case,relativistic electrons cool preferentially by scattering off cmb photons,rather than by synchrotron. thus, sources sharing the same intrinsic propertieshave different extended radio and x-ray luminosities when located at differentz: more distant sources are less luminous in radio and more luminous in x-raysthan their closer counterparts. instead, in compact regions where the localmagnetic field still exceeds the cmb in terms of energy density, synchrotronradiation would be unaffected by the presence of the cmb. such regions includethe compact inner jet and the so-called hot spots in the radio lobes. thedecrease in radio luminosity is larger in misaligned sources, whose radio fluxis dominated by the extended isotropic component. these sources can faildetection in current flux limited radio surveys, and therefore they arepossibly under-represented in the associated samples. as the cooling time islonger for lower energy electrons, the radio luminosity deficit due to the cmbphotons is less important at low radio frequencies. therefore objects notdetected so far in current surveys at a few ghz could be picked up by lowfrequency deep surveys, such as lofar and ska. until then, we can estimate thenumber of high redshift radio-loud agns through the census of their alignedproxies, i.e., blazars. indeed, their observed radio emission arises in theinner and strongly magnetized compact core of the relativistic jet, and notaffected by inverse compton scattering off cmb photons.

1312.3751	the coevolution of supermassive black holes and massive galaxies at high  redshift	we exploit the recent, wide samples of far-infrared (fir) selected galaxiesfollowed-up in x rays and of x-ray/optically selected active galactic nuclei(agns) followed-up in the fir band, along with the classic data on agn andstellar luminosity functions at high redshift z&gt;1.5, to probe different stagesin the coevolution of supermassive black holes (bhs) and host galaxies. theresults of our analysis indicate the following scenario: (i) the star formationin the host galaxy proceeds within a heavily dust-enshrouded medium at analmost constant rate over a timescale ~0.5-1 gyr, and then abruptly declinesdue to quasar feedback; over the same timescale, (ii) part of the interstellarmedium loses angular momentum, reaches the circum-nuclear regions at a rateproportional to the star formation and is temporarily stored into a massivereservoir/proto-torus wherefrom it can be promptly accreted; (iii) the bh growsby accretion in a self-regulated regime with radiative power that can slightlyexceed the eddington limit l/l_edd&lt; 4, particularly at the highest redshifts;(iv) for massive bhs the ensuing energy feedback at its maximum exceeds thestellar one and removes the interstellar gas, thus stopping the star formationand the fueling of the reservoir; (v) afterwards, if the latter has retainedenough gas, a phase of supply-limited accretion follows exponentially decliningwith a timescale of about 2 e-folding times. we show that the ratio of the firluminosity of the host galaxy to the bolometric luminosity of the agn maps thevarious stages of the above sequence. finally, we discuss how the detailedproperties and the specific evolution of the reservoir can be investigated viacoordinated, high-resolution observations of starforming, strongly-lensedgalaxies in the (sub-)mm band with alma and in the x-ray band with chandra andthe next generation x-ray instruments.

1404.7367	do high redshift quasars have powerful jets?	double-lobed radio galaxies a few 100s of kpc in extent, like cygnus a, arecommon at redshifts of 1 to 2, arising from some 10 per cent of the mostpowerful active galactic nuclei (agn). at higher redshifts they are rare, withnone larger than a few 10s of kpc known above redshift z~4. recent studies ofthe redshift evolution of powerful-jetted objects indicate that they mayconstitute a larger fraction of the agn population above redshift 2 thanappears from a simple consideration of detected ghz radio sources. the radioband is misleading as the dramatic (1+z)^4 boost in the energy density of thecosmic microwave background (cmb) causes inverse compton scattering to dominatethe energy losses of relativistic electrons in the extended lobes produced byjets, making them strong x-ray, rather than radio, sources. here we investigatelimits to x-ray lobes around two distant quasars, ulasj112001.48+064124.3 at z= 7.1 and sdssj1030+0524 at z=6.3, and find that powerful jets could beoperating yet be currently undetectable. jets may be instrumental in the rapidbuild-up of billion msun black hole at a rate that violates the eddingtonlimit.

1406.6693	clustering of lat light curves: a clue to the origin of high-energy  emission in gamma-ray bursts	the physical origin of the &gt;0.1 gev emission detected from gamma-ray bursts(grbs) by the fermi satellite has not yet been completely understood. in thiswork we consider the gev light curves of ten grbs with measured redshiftdetected by the fermi-lat. these light curves are characterised by a long-lived($\gtrsim10^2$ seconds) emission, whose luminosity decays in time as apower-law. while the decay rate is similar for all grbs (i.e. $l_{lat}\proptot^{-1.2}$), the normalisation spans about two orders of magnitude inluminosity. however, after re-normalising the luminosities to the promptenergetics $e_{iso}$ the light curves overlap. we consider the scenario inwhich the temporally extended lat emission is dominated by synchrotronradiation from electrons accelerated at the forward external shock. accordingto this model, at high-energies (i.e. above the typical synchrotronfrequencies) a small dispersion of the $e_{iso}$-normalised light curves isexpected. the fact that the lat temporally extended emission follows thisbehaviour reinforces its interpretation in terms of afterglow radiation fromexternal shocks. assuming this scenario, we argue that the parameters$\epsilon_e$ and $\eta_\gamma$ (i.e., the fraction of shock-dissipated energygained by the electrons, and the efficiency of the mechanism producing theprompt radiation, respectively) must be narrowly distributed.

1411.5368	the power of relativistic jets is larger than the luminosity of their  accretion disks	theoretical models for the production of relativistic jets from activegalactic nuclei predict that jet power arises from the spin and mass of thecentral black hole, as well as the magnetic field near the event horizon. thephysical mechanism mechanism underlying the contribution from the magneticfield is the torque exerted on the rotating black hole by the field amplifiedby the accreting material. if the squared magnetic field is proportional to theaccretion rate, then there will be a correlation between jet power andaccretion luminosity. there is evidence for such a correlation, but inadequateknowledge of the accretion luminosity of the limited and inhomogeneous usedsamples prevented a firm conclusion. here we report an analysis of archivalobservations of a sample of blazars (quasars whose jets point towards earth)that overcomes previous limitations. we find a clear correlation between jetpower as measured through the gamma-ray luminosity, and accretion luminosity asmeasured by the broad emission lines, with the jet power dominating over thedisk luminosity, in agreement with numerical simulations. this implies that themagnetic field threading the black hole horizon reaches the maximum valuesustainable by the accreting matter.

1505.05512	cmb quenching of high-redshift radio-loud agns	the very existence of more than a dozen of high-redshift (z&gt;4) blazarsindicates that a much larger population of misaligned powerful jetted agn wasalready in place when the universe was &lt;1.5 gyr old. such parent populationproved to be very elusive, and escaped direct detection in radio surveys sofar. high redshift blazars themselves seem to be failing in producing extendedradio-lobes, raising questions about the connection between such class and thevaster population of radio-galaxies. we show that the interaction of the jetelectrons with the intense cosmic microwave background (cmb) radiation explainsthe lack of extended radio emission in high redshift blazars and in theirparent population, helping to explain the apparently missing misalignedcounterparts of high redshift blazars. on the other hand, the emission from themore compact and more magnetised hot spots are less affected by the enhancedcmb energy density. by modelling the spectral energy distribution of blazarlobes and hot spots we find that most of them should be detectable by lowfrequency deep radio observations, e.g., by low-frequency array for radioastronomy (lofar) and by relatively deep x-ray observations with good angularresolution, e.g., by the chandra satellite. at high redshifts, the emission ofa misaligned relativistic jet, being de-beamed, is missed by current large skyarea surveys. the isotropic flux produced in the hot spots can be below ~1 mjyand the isotropic lobe radio emission is quenched by the cmb cooling.consequently, even sources with very powerful jets can go undetected in currentradio surveys, and misclassified as radio-quiet agns.

0806.3076	precursors in swift gamma ray bursts with redshift	we study a sample of gamma-ray bursts detected by the swift satellite withknown redshift which show a precursor in the swift-bat light curve. we analyzethe spectra of the precursors and compare them with the time integrated spectraof the prompt emission. we find neither a correlation between the two slopesnor a tendency for the precursors spectra to be systematically harder or softerthan the prompt ones. the energetics of the precursors are large: on average,they are just a factor of a few less energetic (in the source rest frame energyrange 15-150 kev) than the entire bursts. these properties do not depend uponthe quiescent time between the end of the precursor and the start of the mainevent. these results suggest that what has been called a "precursor" is not aphenomenon distinct from the main event, but is tightly connected with it, evenif, in some case, the quiescent time intervals can be longer than 100 seconds.

astro-ph;0106570	the dividing line between fr i and fr ii radio--galaxies	in the radio - host galaxy optical luminosity plane fr i and fr iiradio-galaxies are clearly divided. since the optical luminosity of anelliptical galaxy is an indication of the mass of its central black hole, wepropose that the fr i - fr ii dividing luminosity is a function of the mass ofthe black hole powering the active nucleus. furthermore, as the radio powergives an estimate of the total kinetic power carried by the jet, the fr i - frii separation can be re-interpreted as occurring at a constant ratio betweenthe jet power and the black hole mass. there is also convincing evidence of acorrelation between the radio power and the luminosity in narrow emissionlines. as the latter results from photoionization by the radiation produced byaccretion, we can estimate the ionizing luminosity and find that the separationluminosity can be also re-expressed as a constant accretion rate between\~0.01-0.001 of the eddington one. this possibly regulates the accretion modeand the consequent presence and characteristics of nuclear outflows.

astro-ph;0110251	radio properties of first radio sources at 1 mjy	this paper presents a detailed analysis of the radio properties for thesample of faint radio sources introduced in magliocchetti et al.

astro-ph;0111418	the properties of the x-ray holes in the intracluster medium of the  perseus cluster	high resolution x-ray and low frequency radio imaging now allow us to examinein detail the interaction and physical properties of the radio source 3c84 andthe surrounding thermal gas. the radiative and dynamical properties of theinner x-ray holes, which coincide with the radio lobes, indicate that the ratioof the energy factor k and filling factor f is in the range 180&lt;k/f&lt;500. wedefine k to be the ratio of the total particle energy to that of the electronsradiating above a fiducial frequency of 10mhz. the relativistic plasma andmagnetic field are not in equipartition, since the field must be a factor of 4or more lower than required for pressure balance. unexpected steep-spectrumspurs in the low-frequency radio maps point to outer x-ray holes, which areplausibly buoyant old radio lobes. the evidence that the inner lobes arecurrently expanding subsonically, yet have not detached due to buoyancy, andthe requirement that the synchrotron cooling time must exceed the age of thehole, enable us to constrain the jet power of the nucleus to between 10^44 and10^45 ergps, depending on the filling factor of the relativistic plasma.

astro-ph;0112432	a fireworks model for gamma-ray bursts	the energetics of the long duration grb phenomenon is compared with models ofa rotating black hole (bh) in a strong magnetic field generated by an accretingtorus. a rough estimate of the energy extracted from a rotating bh with theblandford-znajek mechanism is obtained with a very simple assumption: aninelastic collision between the rotating bh and the torus. the grb energyemission is attributed to an high magnetic field that breaks down the vacuumaround the bh and gives origin to a e+- fireball. its subsequent evolution ishypothesized, in analogy with the in-flight decay of an elementary particle, toevolve in two distinct phases. the first one occurs close to the engine and isresponsible of energizing and collimating the shells. the second one consistsof a radiation dominated expansion, which correspondingly accelerates therelativistic photon--particle fluid and ends at the transparency time. thismechanism simply predicts that the observed lorentz factor is determined by theproduct of the lorentz factor of the shell close to the engine and the lorentzfactor derived by the expansion. an anisotropy in the fireball propagation isthus naturally produced, whose degree depends on the bulk lorentz factor at theend of the collimation phase.

astro-ph;0202367	low power bl lacertae objects and the blazar sequence: clues on the  particle acceleration process	the spectral properties of blazars seem to follow a phenomenological sequenceaccording to the source luminosity. by inferring the source physical parametersthrough (necessarily) modeling the blazar spectra, we have previously proposedthat the sequence arises because the particles responsible for most of theemission suffer increasing radiative losses as the luminosity increases. herewe extend those results by considering the widest possible range of blazarspectral properties. we find a new important ingredient for shaping the spectraof the lowest power objects, namely the role of a finite timescale for theinjection of relativistic particles. only high energy particles radiativelycool in such timescale leading to a break in the particle distribution:particles with this break energy are those emitting most of the power, and thisgives raise to a link between blazar spectra and total energy density insidethe source, which controls the cooling timescale. the emerging picture requirestwo phases for the particle acceleration: a first pre-heating phase in whichparticles reach a characteristic energy as the result of balancing heating andradiative cooling, and a more rapid acceleration phase which further acceleratethese particles to form a power law distribution. while in agreement withstandard shock theory, this scenario also agrees with the idea that theluminosity of blazars is produced through internal shocks, which naturally leadto shocks lasting for a finite time.

astro-ph;0303161	clumps in large scale relativistic jets	the relatively intense x-ray emission from large scale (tens to hundreds kpc)jets discovered with chandra likely implies that jets (at least in powerfulquasars) are still relativistic at that distances from the active nucleus. inthis case the emission is due to compton scattering off seed photons providedby the cosmic microwave background, and this on one hand permits to havemagnetic fields close to equipartition with the emitting particles, and on theother hand minimizes the requirements about the total power carried by the jet.the emission comes from compact (kpc scale) knots, and we here investigate whatwe can predict about the possible emission between the bright knots. this ismotivated by the fact that bulk relativistic motion makes compton scatteringoff the cmb photons efficient even when electrons are cold or mildlyrelativistic in the comoving frame. this implies relatively long cooling times,dominated by adiabatic losses. therefore the relativistically moving plasma canemit, by compton scattering the microwave seed photons, for a long time. wediscuss how the existing radio--to--x-ray observations of large scale jetsalready pose strong constraints on the structure and dynamics of knots and wepresent a scenario that can satisfactorily reproduce the observed phenomenologyof the jet in 3c273. in this scenario the kiloparsec-scale knots visible withhst, chandra and vla are composed of several smaller sub--units, accounting forthe fast decrease of the flux outside the large knot. substructure in thex-ray- emitting knots can also explain the month--year variability timescalereported for the large scale jet in m87.

astro-ph;0306415	is there a dichotomy in the radio loudness distribution of quasars?	we present a new approach to tackle the issue of radio loudness in quasars.we constrain a (simple) prescription for the intrinsic distribution ofradio-to-optical ratios by comparing properties of monte carlo simulatedsamples with those of observed optically selected quasars. we find strongevidence for a dependence of the radio luminosity on the optical one, eventhough with a large scatter. the dependence of the fraction of radio loudquasars on apparent and absolute optical magnitudes results in a selectioneffect related to the radio and optical limits of current surveys. theintrinsic distribution of the radio-to-optical ratios shows a peak at$r^*_{1.4} \sim 0.3$, with only $\simlt 5$ per cent of objects being includedin a high $r^*_{1.4}$ tail which identifies the radio loud regime. no lack ordeficit of sources -- but only a steep transition region -- is present betweenthe radio loud and radio quiet populations at any $r^*_{1.4}$. we brieflydiscuss possible origins for this behaviour (e.g. absence of jets in radioquiet sources, large range of radiative radio efficiency, different life-timesfor the accretion and jet ejection phenomena, ...).

astro-ph;0309318	extended x-ray emission in the high redshift quasar gb 1508+5714 at  z=4.3	we report the discovery of extended x-ray emission around the powerfulhigh-redshift quasar gb 1508+5714 at z=4.3, revealed in a long chandra acisobservation. the emission feature is 3-4 arcsec away from the quasar core,which corresponds to a projected distance of about 25 kpc. the x-ray spectrumis best fitted with a power law of photon index 1.92+-0.35 (90 per cent c.l.).the x-ray flux and luminosity reach 9.2x10^-15 ergs (0.5-8 kev) and 1.6x10^45erg s^-1 (2.7-42.4 kev rest frame, omega_lambda=0.73, omega_m=0.27, h_0=71 kms^-1 mpc^-1), which is about 2 percent of the total x-ray emission of thequasar. we interpret the x-ray emission as inverse compton scattering of cosmicmicrowave background photons. the scattering relativistic electron populationcould either be a quasi-static diffuse cloud fed by the jet, or an outerextension of the jet with a high bulk lorentz factor. we argue that the lack ofan obvious detection of radio emission from the extended component could be aconsequence of compton losses on the electron population, or of a low magneticfield. extended x-ray emission produced by inverse compton scattering may becommon around high redshift radio galaxies and quasars, demonstrating thatsignificant power is injected into their surrounding by powerful jets.

astro-ph;0310861	the spectra of short gamma-ray bursts	we present the results of the spectral analysis of a sample of short bright$\gamma$--ray bursts (grb) detected by batse and compare them with the averageand time resolved spectral properties of long bright bursts. while the spectralparameters of short grbs confirm, as expected from previous works based on thehardness ratio, that they are harder than long events, we find that thisdifference is mainly due to a harder low energy spectral component present inshort bursts, rather than to a (marginally) different peak energy. intriguinglyour analysis also reveals that the emission properties of short grbs aresimilar to the first 2 s of long events. this might suggest that the centralengine of long and short grbs is the same, just working for a longer time forlong grbs. we find that short bursts do not obey the correlation between peakfrequency and isotropic emitted energy for any assumed redshift, while they canobey the similar correlation between the peak frequency and isotropic emittedluminosity. this is consistent with (although not a proof of) the idea thatshort grbs emit a $\gamma$--ray luminosity similar to long grbs. if they indeedobey the peak frequency -- isotropic luminosity relation, we can estimate theredshift distribution of short bursts, which turns out to be consistent withthat of long bursts just with a slightly smaller average redshift.

astro-ph;0401287	the effects of periodically gapped time series on cross-correlation lag  determinations	the three bright tev blazars mrk 421, mrk 501 and pks 2155-404 are highlyvariable in synchrotron x-ray emission. in particular, these sources mayexhibit variable time lags between flux variations at different x-ray energybands. however, there are a number of issues that may significantly bias lagdeterminations. edelson et al. (2001) recently proposed that the lags ontimescales of hours, discovered by asca and bepposax, could be an artifact ofperiodic gaps in the light curves introduced by the earth occultation every\~1.6 hr. using monte carlo simulations, in this paper we show that the lagsover timescales of hours can not be the spurious result of periodic gaps, whileperiodic gaps indeed introduces uncertainty larger than what present in theevenly sampled data. the results also show that time lag estimates can besubstantially improved by using evenly sampled light curves with large lag tobin-size ratio. furthermore, we consider an xmm-newton observation withoutinterruptions and re-sample the light curves using the bepposax observingwindows, and then repeat the same cross correlation function (ccf) analysis onboth the real and fake data. the results also show that periodic gaps in thelight curves do not significantly distort the ccf characters, and indeed theccf peak ranges of the real and fake data overlap. therefore, the lagsdiscovered by asca and bepposax are not due to periodic gaps in the lightcurves.

astro-ph;0412131	faint radio-loud quasars: clues to their evolution	the quasar sample selected by cross-correlating the first and the 2df quasarredshift surveys allows us to explore, for the first time, the faint end of theradio and optical luminosity functions up to z = 2.2. we find indications (~3\sigma) of a negative evolution for these faint sources at z &gt; 1.8, both inradio and optical bands. this corresponds to a decrement in the space densityof faint quasars of about a factor 2 at z=2.2 and confirms the presence of adifferential evolution for the population of radio-active quasars. the faintend of both luminosity functions flattens and the comparison with the (optical)number density of the whole quasar population supports a dependence of thefraction of radio detected quasars on the optical luminosity. a progressivedecrease in the fraction of quasars in the whole radio source population can beconsistently accounted for within the `receding torus' scenario. the populationof low luminosity quasars, which the first-2df detects, appears to depart fromthe `classical' scheme for radio-loud quasars.

astro-ph;9608163	dense, thin clouds and reprocessed radiation in the central regions of  active galactic nuclei	the primary radiation generated in the central continuum-forming region ofactive galactic nuclei can be reprocessed by very dense, small-scale cloudsthat are optically-thin to thomson scattering. in spite of the extremeconditions expected to prevail in this innermost, central environment, theradiative clouds can survive and maintain cool temperatures relative to theambient emitting region by means of magnetic confinement. motivated by theseideas, we present a detailed quantitative study of such clouds, explicitlydescribing the physical properties they can attain under thermal and radiativeequilibrium conditions. we also discuss the thermal stability of the gas incomparison to that of other reprocessing material thought to reside at largerdistances from the central source. we construct a model to predict the emergentspectra from a source region containing dense clouds which absorb and reemitthe primary radiation generated therein. our predicted spectra show thefollowing two important results: (i) the reprocessed flux emitted at optical/uvenergies is insufficient to account for the blue bump component in the observedspectra; and (ii) the amount of line radiation that is emitted is at leastcomparable to (and in many cases dominates) the continuum radiation. the linesare extremely broad and tend to accumulate in the extreme ultraviolet, wherethey form a peak much more prominent than that which is observed in theoptical/uv. this result is supported by current observations, which indicatethat the spectral energy distribution of radio-quiet agn may indeed reach amaximum in the euv band.

astro-ph;9704113	unifying models for x-ray selected and radio selected bl lac objects	we discuss alternative interpretations of the differences in the spectralenergy distributions (seds) of bl lacs found in complete radio or x-raysurveys. a large body of observations in different bands suggests that the sedsof bl lac objects appearing in x-ray surveys differ from those appearing inradio surveys mainly in having a (synchrotron) spectral cut-off (or break) atmuch higher frequency. in order to explain the different properties of radioand x-ray selected bl lacs giommi and padovani proposed a model based on acommon radio luminosity function. at each radio luminosity, objects with highfrequency spectral cut-offs are assumed to be a minority. nevertheless theydominate the x-ray selected population due to the larger x-ray-to-radio-fluxratio. an alternative model explored here (reminiscent of the orientationmodels previously proposed) is that the x-ray luminosity function is "primary"and that at each x-ray luminosity a minority of objects has largerradio-to-x-ray flux ratio. the predictions of the two scenarios, computed via amontecarlo technique, are compared with the observed properties of bl lacs inthe two samples extracted respectively from the 1 jy radio survey and theeinstein slew survey. we show that both models can explain a number but not allthe observed features. we then propose a completely new approach, based on theidea that the physical parameter which governs the shape of the seds, is (or isassociated with) the bolometric luminosity. assuming an empirical relationbetween spectral shape and luminosity we show that the observational propertiesof the two surveys can be reproduced at least with the same accuracy as the twoprevious models.

astro-ph;9807317	a theoretical unifying scheme for gamma-ray bright blazars	the phenomenology of gamma-ray bright blazars can be accounted for by asequence in the source power and intensity of the diffuse radiation fieldsurrounding the relativistic jet. correspondingly, the equilibrium particledistribution peaks at different energies. this leads to a trend in the observedproperties: an increase of the observed power corresponds to: 1) a decrease inthe frequencies of the synchrotron and inverse compton peaks; 2) an increase inthe ratio of the powers of the high and low energy spectral components. objectsalong this sequence would be observationally classified respectively as highfrequency bl lac objects, low frequency bl lac objects, highly polarizedquasars and lowly polarized quasars. the proposed scheme is based on thecorrelations among the physical parameters derived in the present paper byapplying to 51 gamma ray loud blazars two of the most accepted scenarios forthe broad band emission of blazars, namely the synchrotron self--compton andexternal compton models, and explains the observational trends presented byfossati et al.

(1999), focusing on theflare of april 1998, which was simultaneously observed also at tev energies.the detailed study of the flare in different energy bands reveals a few veryimportant new results: (a) hard photons lag the soft ones by 2-3 ks *a behavioropposite to what is normally found in high energy peak bl lacs x-ray spectra*;(b) the flux decay of the flare can be intrinsically achromatic if a stationaryunderlying emission component is present. moreover the spectral evolutionduring the flare has been followed by extracting x-ray spectra on few ksintervals, allowing to detect for the first time the peak of the synchrotroncomponent shifting to higher energies during the rising phase, and thenreceding. the spectral analysis confirms the delay in the flare at the higherenergies, as above a few kev the spectrum changes only after the peak of theoutburst has occurred. the spectral and temporal information obtained challengethe simplest models currently adopted for the (synchrotron) emission and mostimportantly provide clues on the particle acceleration process. a theoreticalpicture accounting for all the observational constraints is discussed, whereelectrons are injected at low energies and then progressively acceleratedduring the development of the flare.

astro-ph;9912055	the concave x-ray spectrum of the blazar on 231: the signature of  intermediate bl lac objects	on 231 was observed with bepposax in may and june 1998, following anexceptional optical outburst which occured in april--may. we measured the x-rayspectrum from 0.1 up to 100 kev. in both occasions the spectrum had a concaveshape, with a break detected at about 4 and 2.5 kev, respectively. we interpretthe steeper component at energies below the break as due to synchrotronemission and the extremely flat component at energies above the break as due toinverse compton emission. this is so far the best example in which both thesynchrotron and the inverse compton component are detected simultaneously andwith the same instruments in the x-ray spectrum of a blazar. we detect adecrease of the x-ray flux of about 30% below the break between the first andthe second observation, and smaller variability amplitude between 4 and 10 kev.during the may observation we also detected a fast variability event with theflux below 4 kev increasing by about a factor of three in 5 hours. above 4 kevno variability was detected. we discuss these results in the framework ofsynchrotron self-compton models.

0810.5555	tev variability in blazars: how fast can it be?	recent cerenkov observations of the two bl lac objects pks 2155-304 and mkn501 revealed tev flux variability by a factor ~2 in just 3-5 minutes. evenaccounting for the effects of relativistic beaming, such short timescales arechallenging simple and conventional emitting models, and call for alternativeideas. we explore the possibility that extremely fast variable emission mightbe produced by particles streaming at ultra-relativistic speeds along magneticfield lines and inverse compton scattering any radiation field already present.this would produce extremely collimated beams of tev photons. while theprobability for the line of sight to be within such a narrow cone of emissionwould be negligibly small, one would expect that the process is not confined toa single site, but can take place in many very localised regions, along almoststraight magnetic lines. a possible astrophysical setting realising theseconditions is magneto-centrifugal acceleration of beams of particles. in thisscenario, the variability timescale would not be related to the physicaldimension of the emitting volume, but might be determined by either the typicalduration of the process responsible for the production of these high energyparticle beams or by the coherence length of the magnetic field. it ispredicted that even faster tev variability - with no x-ray counterpart - shouldbe observed by the foreseen more sensitive cerenkov telescopes.

0811.1038	a unifying view of gamma ray burst afterglows	we selected a sample of 33 gamma ray bursts (grbs) detected by swift, withknown redshift and optical extinction at the host frame. for these, weconstructed the de-absorbed and k-corrected x-ray and optical rest frame lightcurves. these are modelled as the sum of two components: emission from theforward shock due to the interaction of a fireball with the circum-burst mediumand an additional component, treated in a completely phenomenological way. thelatter can be identified, among other possibilities, as "late prompt" emissionproduced by a long lived central engine with mechanisms similar to thoseresponsible for the production of the "standard" early prompt radiation. apartfrom flares or re-brightenings, that we do not model, we find a good agreementwith the data, despite of their complexity and diversity. although based inpart on a phenomenological model with a relatively large number of freeparameters, we believe that our findings are a first step towards theconstruction of a more physical scenario. our approach allows us to interpretthe behaviour of the optical and x-ray afterglows in a coherent way, by arelatively simple scenario. within this context it is possible to explain whysometimes no jet break is observed; why, even if a jet break is observed, it isoften chromatic; why the steepening after the jet break time is often shallowerthan predicted. finally, the decay slope of the late prompt emission after theshallow phase is found to be remarkably similar to the time profile expected bythe accretion rate of fall-back material (i.e. proportional to t^{-5/3}),suggesting that this can be the reason why the central engine can be active fora long time.
