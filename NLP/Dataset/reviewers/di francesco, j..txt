0903.0690	the initial conditions of clustered star formation i: nh3 observations  of dense cores in ophiuchus	we present combined interferometer and single dish telescope data of nh3(j,k) = (1,1) and (2,2) emission towards the clustered star forming ophiuchusb, c and f cores at high spatial resolution (~1200 au) using the australiatelescope compact array, the very large array, and the green bank telescope.while the large scale features of the nh3 (1,1) integrated intensity appearsimilar to 850 micron continuum emission maps of the cores, on 15" (1800 au)scales we find significant discrepancies between the dense gas tracers in ophb, but good correspondence in oph c and f. using the clumpfind structureidentifying algorithm, we identify 15 nh3 clumps in oph b, and 3 each in oph cand f. only five of the oph b nh3 clumps are coincident within 30" (3600 au) ofa submillimeter clump. we find v_lsr varies little across any of the cores, andadditionally varies by only ~1.5 km/s between them. the observed nh3 linewidths within the oph b and f cores are generally large and often mildlysupersonic, while oph c is characterized by narrow line widths which decreaseto nearly thermal values. we find several regions of localized narrow lineemission (\delta v &lt; 0.4 km/s), some of which are associated with nh3 clumps.we derive the kinetic temperatures of the gas, and find they are remarkablyconstant across oph b and f, with a warmer mean value (t_k = 15 k) thantypically found in isolated regions and consistent with previous results inclustered regions. oph c, however, has a mean t_k = 12 k, decreasing to aminimum t_k = 9.4 k towards the submillimeter continuum peak, similar toprevious studies of isolated starless cores. there is no significant differencein temperature towards protostars embedded in the cores.

0904.0013	submillimeter observations of the quiescent core - ophiuchus a-n6	we have observed the oph a-n6 prestellar core in the following transitions:n2d+ j=3 to 2, dco+ j=3 to 2 and j=5 to 4, hco+ j=3 to 2, cs j=5 to 4 and j=7to 6, and h13co+ j=3 to 2 and j=4 to 3, using the james clerk maxwelltelescope. we also observed the nh3 (1,1) and (2,2) inversion transitionstowards the oph a-n6 peak with the green bank telescope. we have found that then6 core is composed of shells of different chemical composition due to thefreezing out of chemical species at different densities. the undepleted speciesn2d+ appears to trace the high-density interior of the core, dco+ and h13co+trace an intermediate region, and cs traces the outermost edges of the core. adistinct blue-red spectral asymmetry, indicative of infall motion, is clearlydetected in the hco+ spectra, suggesting that n6 is undergoing gravitationalcollapse. this collapse was possibly initiated by a decrease in turbulentsupport suggested by the fact that the non-thermal contribution to the linewidths is smaller for the molecular species closer to the center of the core.we also present a temperature profile for the core. these observations supportthe claim that the oph a-n6 core is an extremely young prestellar core, whichmay have been recently cut off from mhd support and begun to collapse.

0707.0169	the james clerk maxwell telescope legacy survey of nearby star-forming  regions in the gould belt	this paper describes a james clerk maxwell telescope (jcmt) legacy surveythat has been awarded roughly 500 hrs of observing time to be carried out from2007 to 2009. in this survey we will map with scuba-2 (submillimetre commonuser bolometer array 2) almost all of the well-known low-mass andintermediate-mass star-forming regions within 0.5 kpc that are accessible fromthe jcmt. most of these locations are associated with the gould belt. fromthese observations we will produce a flux-limited snapshot of star formationnear the sun, providing a legacy of images, as well as point-source andextended-source catalogues, over almost 700 square degrees of sky. theresulting images will yield the first catalogue of prestellar and protostellarsources selected by submillimetre continuum emission, and should increase thenumber of known sources by more than an order of magnitude. we will also obtainco maps with the array receiver harp (heterodyne array receiver programme), inthree co isotopologues, of a large typical sample of prestellar andprotostellar sources. we will then map the brightest hundred sources with thescuba-2 polarimeter (pol-2), producing the first statistically significant setof polarization maps in the submillimetre. the images and source catalogueswill be a powerful reference set for astronomers, providing a detailed legacyarchive for future telescopes, including alma, herschel and jwst.

0707.0489	an unbiased survey of 500 nearby stars for debris disks: a jcmt legacy  program	we present the scientific motivation and observing plan for an upcomingdetection survey for debris disks using the james clerk maxwell telescope. thescuba-2 unbiased nearby stars (suns) survey will observe 500 nearby mainsequence and sub-giant stars (100 of each of the a, f, g, k and m spectralclasses) to the 850 micron extragalactic confusion limit to search for evidenceof submillimeter excess, an indication of circumstellar material. the surveydistance boundaries are 8.6, 16.5, 22, 25 and 45 pc for m, k, g, f and a stars,respectively, and all targets lie between the declinations of -40 deg to 80deg. in this survey, no star will be rejected based on its inherent properties:binarity, presence of planetary companions, spectral type or age. this will bethe first unbiased survey for debris disks since iras. we expect to detect ~125debris disks, including ~50 cold disks not detectable in current shorterwavelength surveys. a substantial amount of complementary data will be requiredto constrain the temperatures and masses of discovered disks. high resolutionstudies will likely be required to resolve many of the disks. therefore, thesesystems will be the focus of future observational studies using a variety ofobservatories to characterize their physical properties. for non-detectedsystems, this survey will set constraints (upper limits) on the amount ofcircumstellar dust, of typically 200 times the kuiper belt mass, but as low as10 times the kuiper belt mass for the nearest stars in the sample(approximately 2 pc).

0908.4162	the jcmt legacy survey of the gould belt: a first look at orion b with  harp	the gould belt legacy survey will survey nearby star-forming regions (within500 pc), using harp (heterodyne array receiver programme), scuba-2(submillimetre common- user bolometer array 2) and pol-2 (polarimeter 2) on thejames clerk maxwell telescope (jcmt). this paper describes the initial dataobtained using harp to observe 12co, 13co and c18o j = 3 - 2 towards tworegions in orion b, ngc 2024 and ngc 2071. we describe the physicalcharacteristics of the two clouds, calculating temperatures and opacitiesutilizing all three isotopologues. we find good agreement between temperaturescalculated from co and from dust emission in the dense, energetic regions. wedetermine the mass and energetics of the clouds, and of the high-velocitymaterial seen in 12co emission, and compare the relative energetics of thehigh- and low-velocity material in the two clouds. we present a clumpfindanalysis of the 13co condensations. the slope of the condensation massfunctions, at the high-mass ends, is similar to the slope of the initial massfunction.

0910.1609	the science case for building a band 1 receiver suite for alma	we present a set of compelling science cases for the alma band 1 receiversuite. for these cases, we assume in tandem the updated nominal band 1frequency range of 35-50 ghz with a likely extension up to 52 ghz; togetherthese frequencies optimize the band 1 science return. the scope of the sciencecases ranges from nearby stars to the re-ionization edge of the universe. twocases provide additional leverage on the present alma level one science goalsand are seen as particularly powerful motivations for building the band 1receiver suite: (1) detailing the evolution of grains in protoplanetary disks,as a complement to the gas kinematics, requires continuum observations out to~35 ghz (~9mm); and (2) detecting co 3-2 line emission from galaxies like themilky way during the epoch of re-ionization, i.e., 6 &lt; z &lt; 10, also requiresband 1 receiver coverage. the range of band 1 science is wide, however, andincludes studies of very small dust grains in the ism, pulsar wind nebulae,radio supernovae, x-ray binaries, the galactic center (i.e., sgr a*), densecloud cores, complex carbon-chain molecules, masers, magnetic fields in thedense ism, jets and outflows from young stars, distant galaxies, and galaxyclusters (i.e., the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect). a comparison of alma and thejansky vla (jvla) at the same frequencies of band 1 finds similar sensitivityperformance at 40-50 ghz, with a slight edge for alma at higher frequencies(e.g., within a factor of 2 for continuum observations). with its larger numberof instantaneous baselines, however, alma band 1data will have greater fidelitythan those from the jvla at similar frequencies.

0911.3922	the initial conditions of clustered star formation. ii. n2h+  observations of the ophiuchus b core	we present a nobeyama 45 m radio telescope map and australia telescopecompact array pointed observations of n2h+ 1-0 emission towards the clustered,low mass star forming oph b core within the ophiuchus molecular cloud. wecompare these data with previously published results of high resolution nh3(1,1) and (2,2) observations in oph b. we use 3d clumpfind to identify emissionfeatures in the single-dish n2h+ map, and find that the n2h+ `clumps' matchwell similar features previously identified in nh3 (1,1) emission, but arefrequently offset to clumps identified at similar resolution in 850 microncontinuum emission. wide line widths in the oph b2 sub-core indicatenon-thermal motions dominate the core kinematics, and remain transonic atdensities n ~ 3 x 10^5 cm^-3 with large scatter and no trend with n(h2).non-thermal motions in oph b1 and b3 are subsonic with little variation, butalso show no trend with h2 column density. over all oph b, non-thermal n2h+line widths are substantially narrower than those traced by nh3, making itunlikely nh3 and n2h+ trace the same material, but the v_lsr of both speciesagree well. we find evidence for accretion in oph b1 from the surroundingambient gas. the nh3/n2h+ abundance ratio is larger towards starless oph b1than towards protostellar oph b2, similar to recent observational results inother star-forming regions. small-scale structure is found in the atca n2h+ 1-0emission, where emission peaks are again offset from continuum emission. inparticular, the ~1 m_sun b2-mm8 clump is associated with a n2h+ emissionminimum and surrounded by a broken ring-like n2h+ emission structure,suggestive of n2h+ depletion. we find a strong general trend of decreasing n2h+abundance with increasing n(h2) in oph b which matches that found for nh3.

1001.0978	the mass distributions of starless and protostellar cores in gould belt  clouds	using data from the scuba legacy catalogue (850 um) and spitzer spacetelescope (3.6 - 70 um), we explore dense cores in the ophiuchus, taurus,perseus, serpens, and orion molecular clouds. we develop a new method todiscriminate submillimeter cores found by scuba as starless or protostellar,using point source photometry from spitzer wide field surveys. first, weidentify infrared sources with red colors associated with embedded youngstellar objects (ysos). second, we compare the positions of theseyso-candidates to our submillimeter cores. with these identifications, weconstruct new, self-consistent starless and protostellar core mass functions(cmfs) for the five clouds. we find best fit slopes to the high-mass end of thecmfs of -1.26 +/- 0.20, -1.22 +/- 0.06, -0.95 +/- 0.20, and -1.67 +/- 0.72 forophiuchus, taurus, perseus, and orion, respectively. broadly, these slopes areeach consistent with the -1.35 power-law slope of the salpeter imf at highermasses, but suggest some differences. we examine a variety of trends betweenthese cmf shapes and their parent cloud properties, potentially finding acorrelation between the high-mass slope and core temperature. we also find atrend between core mass and effective size, but we are very limited bysensitivity. we make similar comparisons between core mass and size with visualextinction (for a_v &gt;= 3) and find no obvious trends. we also predict thenumbers and mass distributions of cores that future surveys with scuba-2 maydetect in each of these clouds.

1002.2020	the jcmt legacy survey of the gould belt: a first look at taurus with  harp	as part of a jcmt legacy survey of star formation in the gould belt, wepresent early science results for taurus. co j=3-2 maps have been secured alongthe north-west ridge and bowl, collectively known as l 1495, along with deep13co and c18o j=3-2 maps in two sub-regions. with these data we search formolecular outflows, and use the distribution of flows, hh objects and shockedh2 line emission features, together with the population of young stars,protostellar cores and starless condensations to map star formation across thisextensive region. in total 21 outflows are identified. it is clear that thebowl is more evolved than the ridge, harbouring a greater population of t tauristars and a more diffuse, more turbulent ambient medium. by comparison, theridge contains a much younger, less widely distributed population of protostarswhich, in turn, is associated with a greater number of molecular outflows. weestimate the ratio of the numbers of prestellar to protostellar cores in l 1495to be ~ 1.3-2.3, and of gravitationally unbound starless cores to(gravitationally bound) prestellar cores to be ~ 1. if we take previousestimates of the protostellar lifetime of ~ 5 x 10^5 yrs, this indicates aprestellar lifetime of 9(+/-3) x 10^5 yrs. from the number of outflows we alsocrudely estimate the star formation efficiency in l 1495, finding it to becompatible with a canonical value of 10-15 %. we note that molecularoutflow-driving sources have redder near-ir colours than their hh jet-drivingcounterparts. we also find that the smaller, denser cores are associated withthe more massive outflows, as one might expect if mass build-up in the flowincreases with the collapse and contraction of the protostellar envelope.

1005.2183	herschel/pacs imaging of protostars in the hh 1-2 outflow complex	we present 70 and 160 micron herschel science demonstration images of a fieldin the orion a molecular cloud that contains the prototypical herbig-haroobjects hh 1 and 2, obtained with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs). these observations demonstrate herschel's unprecedentedability to study the rich population of protostars in the orion molecularclouds at the wavelengths where they emit most of their luminosity. the fourprotostars previously identified by spitzer 3.6-40 micron imaging andspectroscopy are detected in the 70 micron band, and three are clearly detectedat 160 microns. we measure photometry of the protostars in the pacs bands andassemble their spectral energy distributions (seds) from 1 to 870 microns withthese data, spitzer spectra and photometry, 2mass data, and apex sub-mm data.the seds are fit to models generated with radiative transfer codes. from thesefits we can constrain the fundamental properties of the protostars. we findluminosities in the range 12-84 l_sun and envelope densities spanning over twoorders of magnitude. this implies that the four protostars have a wide range ofenvelope infall rates and evolutionary states: two have dense, infallingenvelopes, while the other two have only residual envelopes. we also show thehighly irregular and filamentary structure of the cold dust and gas surroundingthe protostars as traced at 160 microns.

1005.2202	hier ist wahrhaftig ein loch im himmel - the ngc 1999 dark globule is  not a globule	the ngc 1999 reflection nebula features a dark patch with a size of ~10,000au, which has been interpreted as a small, dense foreground globule andpossible site of imminent star formation. we present herschel pacs far-infrared70 and 160mum maps, which reveal a flux deficit at the location of the globule.we estimate the globule mass needed to produce such an absorption feature to bea few tenths to a few msun. inspired by this herschel observation, we obtainedapex laboca and saboca submillimeter continuum maps, and magellan panicnear-infrared images of the region. we do not detect a submillimer source atthe location of the herschel flux decrement; furthermore our observations placean upper limit on the mass of the globule of ~2.4x10^-2 msun. indeed, thesubmillimeter maps appear to show a flux depression as well. furthermore, thenear-infrared images detect faint background stars that are less affected byextinction inside the dark patch than in its surroundings. we suggest that thedark patch is in fact a hole or cavity in the material producing the ngc 1999reflection nebula, excavated by protostellar jets from the v 380 ori multiplesystem.

1005.2618	from filamentary clouds to prestellar cores to the stellar imf: initial  highlights from the herschel gould belt survey	we summarize the first results from the gould belt survey, obtained towardthe aquila rift and polaris flare regions during the 'science demonstrationphase' of herschel. our 70-500 micron images taken in parallel mode with thespire and pacs cameras reveal a wealth of filamentary structure, as well asnumerous dense cores embedded in the filaments. between ~ 350 and 500prestellar cores and ~ 45-60 class 0 protostars can be identified in the aquilafield, while ~ unbound starless cores and no protostars are observed in thepolaris field. the prestellar core mass function (cmf) derived for the aquilaregion bears a strong resemblance to the stellar initial mass function (imf),already confirming the close connection between the cmf and the imf with muchbetter statistics than earlier studies. comparing and contrasting our herschelresults in aquila and polaris, we propose an observationally-driven scenariofor core formation according to which complex networks of long, thin filamentsform first within molecular clouds, and then the densest filaments fragmentinto a number of prestellar cores via gravitational instability.

1005.2634	the herschel first look at protostars in the aquila rift	as part of the science demonstration phase of the herschel mission of thegould belt key program, the aquila rift molecular complex has been observed.the complete ~ 3.3deg x 3.3deg imaging with spire 250/350/500 micron and pacs70/160 micron allows a deep investigation of embedded protostellar phases,probing of the dust emission from warm inner regions at 70 and 160 micron tothe bulk of the cold envelopes between 250 and 500 micron. we used a systematicdetection technique operating simultaneously on all herschel bands to build asample of protostars. spectral energy distributions are derived to measureluminosities and envelope masses, and to place the protostars in an m_env -l_bol evolutionary diagram. the spatial distribution of protostars indicatesthree star-forming sites in aquila, with w40/sh2-64 hii region by far therichest. most of the detected protostars are newly discovered. for a reducedarea around the serpens south cluster, we could compare the herschel census ofprotostars with spitzer results. the herschel protostars are younger than inspitzer with 7 class 0 ysos newly revealed by herschel. for the entire aquilafield, we find a total of ~ 45-60 class 0 ysos discovered by herschel. thisconfirms the global statistics of several hundred class~0 ysos that should befound in the whole gould belt survey.

1005.3115	filamentary structures and compact objects in the aquila and polaris  clouds observed by herschel	our pacs and spire images of the aquila rift and part of the polaris flareregions, taken during the science demonstration phase of herschel discoveredfascinating, omnipresent filamentary structures that appear to be physicallyrelated to compact cores. we briefly describe a new multi-scale,multi-wavelength source extraction method used to detect objects and measuretheir parameters in our herschel images. all of the extracted starless cores(541 in aquila and 302 in polaris) appear to form in the long and very narrowfilaments. with its combination of the far-ir resolution and sensitivity,herschel directly reveals the filaments in which the dense cores are embedded;the filaments are resolved and have deconvolved widths of 35 arcsec in aquilaand 59 arcsec in polaris (9000 au in both regions). our first results ofobservations with herschel enable us to suggest that in general dense cores mayoriginate in a process of fragmentation of complex networks of long, thinfilaments, likely formed as a result of an interplay between gravity,interstellar turbulence, and magnetic fields. to unravel the roles of theprocesses, one has to obtain additional kinematic and polarization information;these follow-up observations are planned.

1005.3118	herschel observations of embedded protostellar clusters in the rosette  molecular cloud	the herschel ob young stellar objects survey (hobys) has observed the rosettemolecular cloud, providing an unprecedented view of its star formationactivity. these new far-infrared data reveal a population of compact youngstellar objects whose physical properties we aim to characterise. we compiled asample of protostars and their spectral energy distributions that covers thenear-infrared to submillimetre wavelength range. these were used to constrainkey properties in the protostellar evolution, bolometric luminosity, andenvelope mass and to build an evolutionary diagram. several clusters aredistinguished including the cloud centre, the embedded clusters in the vicinityof luminous infrared sources, and the interaction region. the analysedprotostellar population in rosette ranges from 0.1 to about 15 msun withluminosities between 1 and 150 lsun, which extends the evolutionary diagramfrom low-mass protostars into the high-mass regime. some sources lackcounterparts at near- to mid-infrared wavelengths, indicating extreme youth.the central cluster and the phelps &amp; lada 7 cluster appear less evolved thanthe remainder of the analysed protostellar population. for the central cluster,we find indications that about 25% of the protostars classified as class i fromnear- to mid-infrared data are actually candidate class 0 objects. as ashowcase for protostellar evolution, we analysed four protostars of low- tointermediate-mass in a single dense core, and they represent differentevolutionary stages from class 0 to class i. their mid- to far-infraredspectral slopes flatten towards the class i stage, and the 160 to 70um fluxratio is greatest for the presumed class 0 source. this shows that the herschelobservations characterise the earliest stages of protostellar evolution indetail.

1005.3915	the {\beta} pictoris disk imaged by herschel pacs and spire	we obtained herschel pacs and spire images of the thermal emission of thedebris disk around the a5v star {\beta} pic. the disk is well resolved in thepacs filters at 70, 100, and 160 {\mu}m. the surface brightness profilesbetween 70 and 160 {\mu}m show no significant asymmetries along the disk, andare compatible with 90% of the emission between 70 and 160 {\mu}m originatingin a region closer than 200 au to the star. although only marginally resolvingthe debris disk, the maps obtained in the spire 250 - 500 {\mu}m filtersprovide full-disk photometry, completing the sed over a few octaves inwavelength that had been previously inaccessible. the small far-infraredspectral index ({\beta} = 0.34) indicates that the grain size distribution inthe inner disk (&lt;200au) is inconsistent with a local collisional equilibrium.the size distribution is either modified by non-equilibrium effects, orexhibits a wavy pattern, caused by an under-abundance of impactors which havebeen removed by radiation pressure.

1103.0201	characterizing interstellar filaments with herschel in ic5146	we provide a first look at the results of the herschel gould belt surveytoward the ic5146 molecular cloud and present a preliminary analysis of thefilamentary structure in this region. the column density map, derived from our70-500 micron herschel data, reveals a complex network of filaments, andconfirms that these filaments are the main birth sites of prestellar cores. weanalyze the column density profiles of 27 filaments and show that theunderlying radial density profiles fall off as r^{-1.5} to r^{-2.5} at largeradii. our main result is that the filaments seem to be characterized by anarrow distribution of widths having a median value of 0.10 +- 0.03 pc, whichis in stark contrast to a much broader distribution of central jeans lengths.this characteristic width of ~0.1 pc corresponds to within a factor of ~2 tothe sonic scale below which interstellar turbulence becomes subsonic in diffusegas, supporting the argument that the filaments may form as a result of thedissipation of large-scale turbulence.

1111.7021	herschel observations of a potential core forming clump: perseus b1-e	we present continuum observations of the perseus b1-e region from theherschel gould belt survey. these herschel data reveal a loose grouping ofsubstructures at 160 - 500 micron not seen in previous submillimetreobservations. we measure temperature and column density from these data andselect the nine densest and coolest substructures for follow-up spectral lineobservations with the green bank telescope. we find that the b1-e clump has amass of ~ 100 solar masses and appears to be gravitationally bound.furthermore, of the nine substructures examined here, one substructure (b1-e2)appears to be itself bound. the substructures are typically less than a jeanslength from their nearest neighbour and thus, may interact on a timescale of ~1 myr. we propose that b1-e may be forming a first generation of dense cores,which could provide important constraints on the initial conditions ofprestellar core formation. our results suggest that b1-e may be influenced by astrong, localized magnetic field, but further observations are still required.

1202.1413	the herschel view of the on-going star formation in the vela-c molecular  cloud	as part of the herschel guaranteed time key program 'hobys', we present thephotometric survey of the star forming region vela-c, one of the nearest sitesof low-to-high-mass star formation in the galactic plane. vela-c has beenobserved with pacs and spire in parallel mode between 70 um and 500 um over anarea of about 3 square degrees. a photometric catalogue has been extracted fromthe detections in each band, using a threshold of 5 sigma over the localbackground. out of this catalogue we have selected a robust sub-sample of 268sources, of which 75% are cloud clumps and 25% are cores. their spectral energydistributions (seds) have been fitted with a modified black body function. weclassify 48 sources as protostellar and 218 as starless. for two furthersources, we do not provide a secure classification, but suggest they are class0 protostars.  from sed fitting we have derived key physical parameters. protostellarsources are in general warmer and more compact than starless sources. boththese evidences can be ascribed to the presence of an internal source(s) ofmoderate heating, which also causes a temperature gradient and hence a morepeaked intensity distribution. moreover, the reduced dimensions of protostellarsources may indicate that they will not fragment further. a virial analysis ofthe starless sources gives an upper limit of 90% for the sourcesgravitationally bound and therefore prestellar. we fit a power law n(logm) propm^-1.1 to the linear portion of the mass distribution of prestellar sources.this is in between that typical of co clumps and those of cores in nearbystar-forming regions. we interpret this as a result of the inhomogeneity of oursample, which is composed of comparable fractions of clumps and cores.

1203.3403	the pipe nebula as seen with herschel: formation of filamentary  structures by large-scale compression ?	a growing body of evidence indicates that the formation of filaments ininterstellar clouds is a key component of the star formation process. in thispaper, we present new herschel pacs and spire observations of the b59 and stemregions in the pipe nebula complex, revealing a rich, organized network offilaments. the asymmetric column density profiles observed for severalfilaments, along with the bow-like edge of b59, indicates that the pipe nebulais being compressed from its western side, most likely by the winds from thenearby sco ob2 association. we suggest that this compressive flow hascontributed to the formation of some of the observed filamentary structures. inb59, the only region of the entire pipe complex showing star formationactivity, the same compressive flow has likely enhanced the initial columndensity of the clump, allowing it to become globally gravitationally unstable.although more speculative, we propose that gravity has also been responsiblefor shaping the converging filamentary pattern observed in b59. while thequestion of the relative impact of large-scale compression and gravity remainsopen in b59, large-scale compression appears to be a plausible mechanism forthe initial formation of filamentary structures in the rest of the complex

1203.6472	cluster-formation in the rosette molecular cloud at the junctions of  filaments	for many years feedback processes generated by ob-stars in molecular clouds,including expanding ionization fronts, stellar winds, or uv-radiation, havebeen proposed to trigger subsequent star formation. however, hydrodynamicmodels including radiation and gravity show that uv-illumination has little orno impact on the global dynamical evolution of the cloud. the rosette molecularcloud, irradiated by the ngc2244 cluster, is a template region for triggeredstar-formation, and we investigated its spatial and density structure byapplying a curvelet analysis, a filament-tracing algorithm (disperse), andprobability density functions (pdfs) on herschel column density maps, obtainedwithin the hobys key program. the analysis reveals not only the filamentarystructure of the cloud but also that all known infrared clusters except one lieat junctions of filaments, as predicted by turbulence simulations. the pdfs ofsub-regions in the cloud show systematic differences. the two uv-exposedregions have a double-peaked pdf we interprete as caused by shock compression.the deviations of the pdf from the log-normal shape typically associated withlow- and high-mass star-forming regions at av~3-4m and 8-10m, respectively, arefound here within the very same cloud. this shows that there is no fundamentaldifference in the density structure of low- and high-mass star-forming regions.we conclude that star-formation in rosette - and probably in high-massstar-forming clouds in general - is not globally triggered by the impact ofuv-radiation. moreover, star formation takes place in filaments that arose fromthe primordial turbulent structure built up during the formation of the cloud.clusters form at filament mergers, but star formation can be locally induced inthe direct interaction zone between an expanding hii--region and the molecularcloud.

1204.5037	herschel images of fomalhaut. an extrasolar kuiper belt at the height of  its dynamical activity	fomalhaut is a young, nearby star that is suspected to harbor an infantplanetary system, interspersed with one or more belts of dusty debris. wepresent far-infrared images obtained with the herschel space observatory withan angular resolution between 5.7 and 36.7 arcsec at wavelengths between 70 and500 micrometer. the images show the main debris belt in great detail. even athigh spatial resolution, the belt appears smooth. the region in between thebelt and the central star is not devoid of material; thermal emission isobserved here as well. also at the location of the star, excess emission isdetected.  we use a dynamical model together with radiative-transfer tools to derive theparameters of the debris disk. we include detailed models of the interaction ofthe dust grains with radiation, for both the radiation pressure and thetemperature determination. comparing these models to the spatially resolvedtemperature information contained in the images allows us to place strongconstraints on the presence of grains that will be blown out of the system byradiation pressure. we use this to derive the dynamical parameters of thesystem.  the appearance of the belt points towards a remarkably active system in whichdust grains are produced at a very high rate by a collisional cascade in anarrow region filled with dynamically excited planetesimals. dust particleswith sizes below the blow-out size are abundantly present. the equivalent of2000 one-km-sized comets are destroyed every day, out of a cometary reservoiramounting to 110 earth masses. from comparison of their scattering and thermalproperties, we find evidence that the dust grains are fluffy aggregates, whichindicates a cometary origin. the excess emission at the location of the starmay be produced by hot dust with a range of temperatures, but may also be dueto gaseous free-free emission from a stellar wind.

1204.6180	molecular line contamination in the scuba-2 450 {\mu}m and 850 {\mu}m  continuum data	observations of the dust emission using millimetre/submillimetre bolometerarrays can be contaminated by molecular line flux, such as flux from 12co. asthe brightest molecular line in the submillimetre, it is important to quantifythe contribution of co flux to the dust continuum bands. conversion factorswere used to convert molecular line integrated intensities to flux detected bybolometer arrays in mjy per beam. these factors were calculated for 12co lineintegrated intensities to the scuba-2 850 {\mu}m and 450 {\mu}m bands. theconversion factors were then applied to harp 12co 3-2 maps of ngc 1333 in theperseus complex and ngc 2071 and ngc 2024 in the orion b molecular cloudcomplex to quantify the respective 12co flux contribution to the 850 {\mu}mdust continuum emission. sources with high molecular line contamination wereanalysed in further detail for molecular outflows and heating by nearby starsto determine the cause of the 12co contribution. the majority of sources had a12co 3-2 flux contribution under 20 per cent. however, in regions of molecularoutflows, the 12co can dominate the source dust continuum (up to 79 per centcontamination) with 12co fluxes reaching \sim 68 mjy per beam.

1206.1243	the spine of the swan: a herschel study of the dr21 ridge and filaments  in cygnus x	in order to characterise the cloud structures responsible for the formationof high-mass stars, we present herschel observations of the dr21 environment.maps of the column density and dust temperature unveil the structure of thedr21 ridge and several connected filaments. the ridge has column densitieslarger than 1e23/cm^2 over a region of 2.3 pc^2. it shows substructured columndensity profiles and branching into two major filaments in the north. themasses in the studied filaments range between 130 and 1400 msun whereas themass in the ridge is 15000 msun. the accretion of these filaments onto the dr21ridge, suggested by a previous molecular line study, could provide a continuousmass inflow to the ridge. in contrast to the striations seen in e.g., thetaurus region, these filaments are gravitationally unstable and form cores andprotostars. these cores formed in the filaments potentially fall into theridge. both inflow and collisions of cores could be important to drive theobserved high-mass star formation. the evolutionary gradient of star formationrunning from dr21 in the south to the northern branching is traced bydecreasing dust temperature. this evolution and the ridge structure can beexplained by two main filamentary components of the ridge that merged first inthe south.

1211.2234	herschel/pacs spectroscopic survey of protostars in orion: the origin of  far-infrared co emission	we present far-ir (57-196 mu) spectra of 21 protostars in the orion molecularclouds, obtained with the photodetector array camera and spectrometer (pacs)onboard the herschel space observatory, as part of the herschel orion protostarsurvey (hops) program. we analyzed the co emission lines (j_up = 14-46) in thepacs spectra, extracted within a projected distance of &lt;= 2000 au centered onthe protostar. the total luminosity of the co lines observed with pacs (l(co))is found to increase with increasing l_bol. the co rotational temperatureimplied by the line ratios increases with j, and at least 3-4 rotationaltemperature components are required to fit the observed rotational diagram. therotational temperature components are remarkably invariant between protostarsand show no dependence on l_bol, t_bol or envelope density, implying that ifthe emitting gas is in lte, the co emission must arise in multiple temperaturecomponents that remain independent of l_bol over two orders of magnitudes. theobserved co emission can also be modeled as arising from a single temperaturegas component or from a medium with a power-law temperature distribution; bothof these require sub-thermally excited molecular gas at low densities (n(h_2)&lt;= 10^6 cm^-3) and high temperatures (t &gt;= 2000 k). our results suggest thatthe contribution from pdrs along the envelope cavity walls is unlikely to bethe dominant component of the co emission observed with pacs. instead, the"universality" of the rotational temperatures and the observed correlationbetween l(co) and l_bol can most easily be explained if the observed coemission originates in shock-heated, hot (t &gt;= 2000 k), sub-thermally excited(n(h_2) &lt;= 10^6 cm^-3) molecular gas. post-shock gas at these densities is morelikely to be found within the outflow cavities along the molecular outflow oralong the cavity walls at radii &gt;= several 100-1000 au.

1211.2626	comet-like mineralogy of olivine crystals in an extrasolar proto-kuiper  belt	some planetary systems harbour debris disks containing planetesimals such asasteroids and comets. collisions between such bodies produce small dustparticles, the spectral features of which reveal their composition and, hence,that of their parent bodies. a measurement of the composition of olivinecrystals has been done for the protoplanetary disk hd100546 and for olivinecrystals in the warm inner parts of planetary systems. the latter compares wellwith the iron-rich olivine in asteroids (x&lt;0.29). in the cold outskirts of thebeta pictoris system, an analogue to the young solar system, olivine crystalswere detected but their composition remained undetermined, leaving unknown howthe composition of the bulk of solar system cometary olivine grains compareswith that of extrasolar comets. here we report the detection of the69-micrometre-wavelength band of olivine crystals in the spectrum of betapictoris. because the disk is optically thin, we can associate the crystalswith an extrasolar proto-kuiper belt a distance of 15-45 astronomical unitsfrom the star (one astronomical unit is the sun-earth distance), determinetheir magnesium-rich composition (x=0.01+/-0.001) and show that they make up3.6+/-1.0 per cent of the total dust mass. these values are strikingly similarto those for the dust emitted by the most primitive comets in the solar system,even though beta pictoris is more massive and more luminous and has a differentplanetary system architecture.

1211.6360	herschel view of the taurus b211/3 filament and striations: evidence of  filamentary growth?	we present first results from the herschel gould belt survey for theb211/l1495 region in the taurus molecular cloud. thanks to their highsensitivity and dynamic range, the herschel images reveal the structure of thedense, star-forming filament b211 with unprecedented detail, along with thepresence of striations perpendicular to the filament and generally orientedalong the magnetic field direction as traced by optical polarization vectors.based on the column density and dust temperature maps derived from the herscheldata, we find that the radial density profile of the b211 filament approaches apower-law behavior {\rho} {\propto} r^(-2.0{\pm}0.4) at large radii and thatthe temperature profile exhibits a marked drop at small radii. the observeddensity and temperature profiles of the b211 filament are in good agreementwith a theoretical model of a cylindrical filament undergoing gravitationalcontraction with a polytropic equation of state: p {\propto} {\rho}^{\gamma}and t {\propto} {\rho}^({\gamma}-1), with {\gamma}=0.97{\pm}0.01&lt;1 (i.e. notstrictly isothermal). the morphology of the column density map, where some ofthe perpendicular striations are apparently connected to the b211 filament,further suggests that the material may be accreting along the striations ontothe main filament. the typical velocities expected for the infalling materialin this picture are ~0.5-1 km/s, which are consistent with the existingkinematical constraints from previous co observations.

1301.3805	herschel observations of the w3 gmc: clues to the formation of clusters  of high-mass stars	the w3 gmc is a prime target for the study of the early stages of high-massstar formation. we have used herschel data from the hobys key program toproduce and analyze column density and temperature maps. two preliminarycatalogs were produced by extracting sources from the column density map andfrom herschel maps convolved to the 500 micron resolution. herschel revealsthat among the compact sources (fwhm&lt;0.45 pc), w3 east, w3 west, and w3 (oh)are the most massive and luminous and have the highest column density.considering the unique properties of w3 east and w3 west, the only clumps withon-going high-mass star formation, we suggest a 'convergent constructivefeedback' scenario to account for the formation of a cluster with decreasingage and increasing system/source mass toward the innermost regions. thisprocess, which relies on feedback by high-mass stars to ensure the availabilityof material during cluster formation, could also lead to the creation of anenvironment suitable for the formation of trapezium-like systems. in commonwith other scenarios proposed in other hobys studies, our results indicate thatan active/dynamic process aiding in the accumulation, compression, andconfinement of material is a critical feature of the high-mass star/clusterformation, distinguishing it from classical low-mass star formation. theenvironmental conditions and availability of triggers determine the form inwhich this process occurs, implying that high-mass star/cluster formation couldarise from a range of scenarios: from large scale convergence of turbulentflows, to convergent constructive feedback or mergers of filaments.

1311.3664	pillars and globules at the edges of h ii regions, confronting herschel  observations and numerical simulations	pillars and globules are present in many high-mass star-forming regions, suchas the eagle nebula (m16) and the rosette molecular cloud, and understandingtheir origin will help characterize triggered star formation. the formationmechanisms of these structures are still being debated. recent numericalsimulations have shown how pillars can arise from the collapse of the shell inon itself and how globules can be formed from the interplay of the turbulentmolecular cloud and the ionization from massive stars. the goal here is to testthis scenario through recent observations of two massive star-forming regions,m16 and rosette. the column density structure of the interface betweenmolecular clouds and h ii regions was characterized using column density mapsobtained from far-infrared imaging of the herschel hobys key programme. then,the disperse algorithm was used on these maps to detect the compressed layersaround the ionized gas and pillars in different evolutionary states. finally,their velocity structure was investigated using co data, and all observationalsignatures were tested against some distinct diagnostics established fromsimulations. the column density profiles have revealed the importance ofcompression at the edge of the ionized gas. the velocity properties of thestructures, i.e. pillars and globules, are very close to what we predict fromthe numerical simulations. we have identified a good candidate of a nascentpillar in the rosette molecular cloud that presents the velocity pattern of theshell collapsing on itself, induced by a high local curvature. globules have abulk velocity dispersion that indicates the importance of the initialturbulence in their formation, as proposed from numerical simulations.altogether, this study re-enforces the picture of pillar formation by shellcollapse and globule formation by the ionization of highly turbulent clouds.

1401.7333	ionization compression impact on dense gas distribution and star  formation, probability density functions around h ii regions as seen by  herschel	ionization feedback should impact the probability distribution function (pdf)of the column density around the ionized gas. we aim to quantify this effectand discuss its potential link to the core and initial mass function (cmf/imf).we used in a systematic way herschel column density maps of several regionsobserved within the hobys key program: m16, the rosette and vela c molecularcloud, and the rcw 120 h ii region. we fitted the column density pdfs of allclouds with two lognormal distributions, since they present a double-peak orenlarged shape in the pdf. our interpretation is that the lowest part of thecolumn density distribution describes the turbulent molecular gas while thesecond peak corresponds to a compression zone induced by the expansion of theionized gas into the turbulent molecular cloud. the condensations at the edgeof the ionized gas have a steep compressed radial profile, sometimesrecognizable in the flattening of the power-law tail. this could lead to anunambiguous criterion able to disentangle triggered from pre-existing starformation. in the context of the gravo-turbulent scenario for the origin of thecmf/imf, the double peaked/enlarged shape of the pdf may impact the formationof objects at both the low-mass and the high-mass end of the cmf/imf. inparticular a broader pdf is required by the gravo-turbulent scenario to fitproperly the imf with a reasonable initial mach number for the molecular cloud.since other physical processes (e.g. the equation of state and the variationsamong the core properties) have already been suggested to broaden the pdf, therelative importance of the different effects remains an open question.

1401.7871	properties of starless and prestellar cores in taurus revealed by  herschel spire/pacs imaging	the density and temperature structures of dense cores in the l1495 cloud ofthe taurus star-forming region are investigated using herschel spire and pacsimages in the 70 $\mu$m, 160 $\mu$m, 250 $\mu$m, 350 $\mu$m and 500 $\mu$mcontinuum bands. a sample consisting of 20 cores, selected using spectral andspatial criteria, is analysed using a new maximum likelihood technique,corefit, which takes full account of the instrumental point spread functions.we obtain central dust temperatures, $t_0$, in the range 6-12 k and find that,in the majority of cases, the radial density falloff at large radial distancesis consistent with the $r^{-2}$ variation expected for bonnor-ebert spheres.two of our cores exhibit a significantly steeper falloff, however, and sinceboth appear to be gravitationally unstable, such behaviour may haveimplications for collapse models. we find a strong negative correlation between$t_0$ and peak column density, as expected if the dust is heated predominantlyby the interstellar radiation field. at the temperatures we estimate for thecore centres, carbon-bearing molecules freeze out as ice mantles on dustgrains, and this behaviour is supported here by the lack of correspondencebetween our estimated core locations and the previously-published positions ofh$^{13}$co$^+$ peaks. on this basis, our observations suggest asublimation-zone radius typically $\sim 10^4$ au. comparison withpreviously-published n$_2$h$^+$ data at 8400 au resolution, however, shows noevidence for n$_2$h$^+$ depletion at that resolution.

1401.8292	fragmentation of massive dense cores down to ~1000 au: relation between  fragmentation and density structure	in order to shed light on the main physical processes controllingfragmentation of massive dense cores, we present a uniform study of the densitystructure of 19 massive dense cores, selected to be at similar evolutionarystages, for which their relative fragmentation level was assessed in a previouswork. we inferred the density structure of the 19 cores through a simultaneousfit of the radial intensity profiles at 450 and 850 micron (or 1.2 mm in twocases) and the spectral energy distribution, assuming spherical symmetry andthat the density and temperature of the cores decrease with radius followingpower-laws. we find a weak (inverse) trend of fragmentation level and densitypower-law index, with steeper density profiles tending to show lowerfragmentation, and vice versa. in addition, we find a trend of fragmentationincreasing with density within a given radius, which arises from a combinationof flat density profile and high central density and is consistent with jeansfragmentation. we considered the effects of rotational-to-gravitational energyratio, non-thermal velocity dispersion, and turbulence mode on the densitystructure of the cores, and found that compressive turbulence seems to yieldhigher central densities. finally, a possible explanation for the origin ofcores with concentrated density profiles, which are the cores showing nofragmentation, could be related with a strong magnetic field, consistent withthe outcome of radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations.

1404.7142	class 0 protostars in the perseus molecular cloud: a correlation between  the youngest protostars and the dense gas distribution	we use pacs and spire continuum data at 160 um, 250 um, 350 um, and 500 umfrom the herschel gould belt survey to sample seven clumps in perseus: b1,b1-e, b5, ic348, l1448, l1455, and ngc1333. additionally, we identify andcharacterize the embedded class 0 protostars using detections of compactherschel sources at 70 um as well as archival spitzer catalogues and scuba 850um photometric data. we identify 28 candidate class 0 protostars, four of whichare newly discovered sources not identified with spitzer. we find that the starformation efficiency of clumps, as traced by class 0 protostars, correlatesstrongly with the flatness of their respective column density distributions athigh values. this correlation suggests that the fraction of high column densitymaterial in a clump reflects only its youngest protostellar population ratherthan its entire source population. we propose that feedback from either theformation or evolution of protostars changes the local density structure ofclumps.

1408.5432	signatures of warm carbon monoxide in protoplanetary discs observed with  herschel spire	molecular gas constitutes the dominant mass component of protoplanetarydiscs. to date, these sources have not been studied comprehensively at thelongest far-infrared and shortest submillimetre wavelengths. this paperpresents herschel spire fts spectroscopic observations toward 18 protoplanetarydiscs, covering the entire 450-1540 ghz (666-195 $\mu$m) range at r~400-1300.the spectra reveal clear detections of the dust continuum and, in six targets,a significant amount of spectral line emission primarily attributable to$^{12}$co rotational lines. other targets exhibit little to no detectablespectral lines. low signal-to-noise detections also include signatures from$^{13}$co, [ci] and hcn. for completeness, we present upper limits ofnon-detected lines in all targets, including low-energy transitions of h2o andch$^+$ molecules. the ten $^{12}$co lines that fall within the spire fts bandstrace energy levels of ~50-500 k. combined with lower and higher energy linesfrom the literature, we compare the co rotational line energy distribution withdetailed physical-chemical models, for sources where these are available andpublished. our 13co line detections in the disc around herbig be star hd 100546exceed, by factors of ~10-30, the values predicted by a model that matches awealth of other observational constraints, including the spire $^{12}$coladder. to explain the observed $^{12}$co/$^{13}$co ratio, it may be necessaryto consider the combined effects of optical depth and isotope selective(photo)chemical processes. considering the full sample of 18 objects, we findthat the strongest line emission is observed in discs around herbig ae/bestars, although not all show line emission. in addition, two of the six t tauriobjects exhibit detectable $^{12}$co lines in the spire range.

1410.3706	revealing h2d+ depletion and compact structure in starless and  protostellar cores with alma	we present atacama large millimeter/submillimeter array (alma) observationsof the submillimeter dust continuum and h2d+ 1_{10}-1_{11} emission toward twoevolved, potentially protostellar cores within the ophiuchus molecular cloud,oph a sm1 and sm1n. the data reveal small-scale condensations within bothcores, with mass upper limits of m &lt;~ 0.02m_sun (~ 20 m_jup). the sm1condensation is consistent with a nearly-symmetric gaussian source with a widthof only 37 au. the sm1n condensation is elongated, and extends 500 au along itsmajor axis. no evidence for substructure is seen in either source. a jeansanalysis indicates these sources are unlikely to fragment, suggesting that bothwill form single stars. h2d+ is only detected toward sm1n, offset from thecontinuum peak by ~150-200 au. this offset may be due to either heating from anundetected, young, low luminosity protostellar source or first hydrostaticcore, or hd (and consequently h2d+) depletion in the cold centre of thecondensation. we propose that sm1 is protostellar, and that the condensationdetected by alma is a warm (t ~ 30-50 k) accretion disk. the less concentratedemission of the sm1n condensation suggests that it is still starless, but wecannot rule out the presence of a low-luminosity source, perhaps surrounded bya pseudodisk. these data reveal observationally the earliest stages of theformation of circumstellar accretion regions, and agree with theoreticalpredictions that disk formation can occur very early in the star formationprocess, coeval with or just after the formation of a first hydrostatic core orprotostar.

1412.5965	the jcmt gould belt survey: evidence for radiative heating in serpens  mwc 297 and its influence on local star formation	we present scuba-2 450micron and 850micron observations of the serpens mwc297 region, part of the jcmt gould belt survey of nearby star-forming regions.simulations suggest that radiative feedback influences the star-formationprocess and we investigate observational evidence for this by constructingtemperature maps. maps are derived from the ratio of scuba-2 fluxes and a twocomponent model of the jcmt beam for a fixed dust opacity spectral index ofbeta = 1.8. within 40 of the b1.5ve herbig star mwc 297, the submillimetrefluxes are contaminated by free-free emission with a spectral index of1.03+-0.02, consistent with an ultra-compact hii region and polar winds/jets.contamination accounts for 73+-5 per cent and 82+-4 per cent of peak flux at450micron and 850micron respectively. the residual thermal disk of the star isalmost undetectable at these wavelengths. young stellar objects are confirmedwhere scuba-2 850micron clumps identified by the fellwalker algorithm coincidewith spitzer gould belt survey detections. we identify 23 objects and use tbolto classify nine ysos with masses 0.09 to 5.1 msun. we find two class 0, oneclass 0/i, three class i and three class ii sources. the mean temperature is15+-2k for the nine ysos and 32+-4k for the 14 starless clumps. we observe astarless clump with an abnormally high mean temperature of 46+-2k and concludethat it is radiatively heated by the star mwc 297. jeans stability providesevidence that radiative heating by the star mwc 297 may be suppressing clumpcollapse.

1507.02055	herschel observations of the w3 gmc (ii): clues to the formation of  clusters of high-mass stars	the w3 gmc is a prime target for investigating the formation of high-massstars and clusters. this second study of w3 within the hobys key programprovides a comparative analysis of subfields within w3 to further constrain theprocesses leading to the observed structures and stellar population.probability density functions (pdfs) and cumulative mass distributions (cmds)were created from dust column density maps, quantified as extinction av. theshape of the pdf, typically represented with a lognormal function at low av"breaking" to a power-law tail at high av, is influenced by various processesincluding turbulence and self-gravity. the breaks can also be identified, oftenmore readily, in the cmds. the pdf break from lognormal (av(sf)= 6-10 mag)appears to shift to higher av by stellar feedback, so that high-massstar-forming regions tend to have higher pdf breaks. a second break at av &gt; 50mag traces structures formed or influenced by a dynamic process. because such aprocess has been suggested to drive high-mass star formation in w3, this secondbreak might then identify regions with potential for hosting high-massstars/clusters. stellar feedback appears to be a major mechanism driving thelocal evolution and state of regions within w3. a high initial star formationefficiency in a dense medium could result in a self-enhancing process, leadingto more compression and favourable star-formation conditions (e.g., collidingflows), a richer stellar content, and massive stars. this scenario would becompatible with the "convergent constructive feedback" model introduced in ourprevious herschel study.

1507.05926	a census of dense cores in the aquila cloud complex: spire/pacs  observations from the herschel gould belt survey	we present and discuss the results of the herschel gould belt surveyobservations in a ~11 deg^2 area of the aquila molecular cloud complex at d~260pc, imaged with the spire/pacs cameras from 70 to 500 micron. we identify acomplete sample of starless dense cores and embedded protostars in this region,and analyze their global properties and spatial distributions. we find a totalof 651 starless cores, ~60% of which are gravitationally bound prestellarcores, and they will likely form stars in the future. we also detect 58protostellar cores. the core mass function (cmf) derived for the prestellarcores is very similar in shape to the stellar initial mass function (imf),supporting the earlier view that there is a close physical link between the imfand the cmf. the global shift in mass scale observed between the cmf and theimf is consistent with a typical star formation efficiency of ~40%. bycomparing the numbers of starless cores to the number of young stellar objects,we estimate that the lifetime of prestellar cores is ~1 myr. we find a strongcorrelation between the spatial distribution of prestellar cores and thedensest filaments. about 90% of the herschel-identified prestellar cores arelocated above a background column density corresponding to a_v~7, and ~75% ofthem lie within filamentary structures with supercritical masses per unitlength &gt;~16 m_sun/pc. these findings support a picture wherein the cores makingup the peak of the cmf (and probably responsible for the base of the imf)result primarily from the gravitational fragmentation of marginallysupercritical filaments. given that filaments appear to dominate the massbudget of dense gas at a_v&gt;7, our findings also suggest that the physics ofprestellar core formation within filaments is responsible for a characteristic"efficiency" sfr/m_dense ~5+-2 x 10^-8 yr^-1 for the star formation process indense gas.

1509.01819	a possible link between the power spectrum of interstellar filaments and  the origin of the prestellar core mass function	two major features of the prestellar cmf are: 1) a broad peak below 1 msun,presumably corresponding to a mean gravitational fragmentation scale, and 2) acharacteristic power-law slope, very similar to the salpeter slope of thestellar initial mass function (imf) at the high-mass end. while recent herschelobservations have shown that the peak of the prestellar cmf is close to thethermal jeans mass in marginally supercritical filaments, the origin of thepower-law tail of the cmf/imf at the high-mass end is less clear. inutsuka(2001) proposed a theoretical scenario in which the origin of the power-lawtail can be understood as resulting from the growth of an initial spectrum ofdensity perturbations seeded along the long axis of filaments by interstellarturbulence. here, we report the statistical properties of the line-massfluctuations of filaments in nearby molecular clouds observed with herschelusing a 1-d power spectrum analysis. the observed filament power spectra werefitted by a power-law function $(p_{true}(s) \propto s^{\alpha})$ afterremoving the effect of beam convolution at small scales. a gaussian-likedistribution of power-spectrum slopes was found centered at -1.6, close to thatof the one-dimensional velocity power spectrum generated by subsonickolomogorov turbulence (-1.67). an empirical correlation, $p^{0.5}(s_0) \propto&lt;n_{\rm h_2}&gt;^{1.4 \pm 0.1} $, was also found between the amplitude of eachfilament power spectrum $p(s_0)$ and the mean column density along the filament$&lt;n_{\rm h_2}&gt;$. finally, the dispersion of line-mass fluctuations along eachfilament $\sigma_{\rm m_{line}}$ was found to scale with the physical length$l$ of the filament, roughly as $\sigma_{m_{line}} \propto l^{0.7}$. overall,our results are consistent with the suggestion that the bulk of the cmf/imfresults from the gravitational fragmentation of filaments.

1510.09175	from forced collapse to h ii region expansion in mon r2: envelope  density structure and age determination with herschel	the surroundings of hii regions can have a profound influence on theirdevelopment, morphology, and evolution. this paper explores the effect of theenvironment on h ii regions in the monr2 molecular cloud. we aim to investigatethe density structure of envelopes surrounding hii regions and to determinetheir collapse and ionisation expansion ages. the mon r2 molecular cloud is anideal target since it hosts an h ii region association. column density andtemperature images derived from herschel data were used together to model thestructure of hii bubbles and their surrounding envelopes. the resultingobservational constraints were used to follow the development of the mon r2ionised regions with analytical calculations and numerical simulations. thefour hot bubbles associated with h ii regions are surrounded by dense, cold,and neutral gas envelopes. the radial density profiles are reminiscent of thoseof low-mass protostellar envelopes. the inner parts of envelopes of all fourhii regions could be free-falling because they display shallow densityprofiles. as for their outer parts, the two compact hii regions show a densityprofile, which is typical of the equilibrium structure of an isothermal sphere.in contrast, the central uchii region shows a steeper outer profile, that couldbe interpreted as material being forced to collapse. the size of the heatedbubbles, the spectral type of the irradiating stars, and the mean initialneutral gas density are used to estimate the ionisation expansion time, texp,0.1myr,for the dense uchii and compact hii regions and 0.35 myr for theextended hii region. the envelope transition radii between the shallow andsteeper density profiles are used to estimate the time elapsed since theformation of the first proto stellar embryo, tinf : 1myr, for theultra-compact, 1.5 / 3myr for the compact, and greater than 6myr for theextended hii regions.

1512.00893	the jcmt gould belt survey: a first look at dense cores in orion b	we present a first look at the scuba-2 observations of three sub-regions ofthe orion b molecular cloud: ldn 1622, ngc 2023/2024, and ngc 2068/2071, fromthe jcmt gould belt legacy survey. we identify 29, 564, and 322 dense cores inl1622, ngc 2023/2024, and ngc 2068/2071 respectively, using the scuba-2 850micron map, and present their basic properties, including their peak fluxes,total fluxes, and sizes, and an estimate of the corresponding 450 micron peakfluxes and total fluxes, using the fellwalker source extraction algorithm.assuming a constant temperature of 20 k, the starless dense cores have a massfunction similar to that found in previous dense core analyses, with asalpeter-like slope at the high-mass end. the majority of cores appear stableto gravitational collapse when considering only thermal pressure; indeed, mostof the cores which have masses above the thermal jeans mass are alreadyassociated with at least one protostar. at higher cloud column densities, above1-2 x 10^23 cm^-2, most of the mass is found within dense cores, while at lowercloud column densities, below 1 x 10^23 cm^-2, this fraction drops to 10% orlower. overall, the fraction of dense cores associated with a protostar isquite small (&lt;8%), but becomes larger for the densest and most centrallyconcentrated cores. ngc 2023 / 2024 and ngc 2068/2071 appear to be on the pathto forming a significant number of stars in the future, while l1622 has littleadditional mass in dense cores to form many new stars.

astro-ph;0202490	limits on radio continuum emission from a sample of candidate  contracting starless cores	we used the nrao very large array to search for 3.6 cm continuum emissionfrom embedded protostars in a sample of 8 nearby ``starless'' cores that showspectroscopic evidence for infalling motions in molecular emission lines. wedetect a total of 13 compact sources in the eight observed fields to 5 sigmalimiting flux levels of typically 0.09 mjy. none of these sources lie within 1'of the central positions of the cores, and they are all likely backgroundobjects. based on an extrapolation of the empirical correlation between thebolometric luminosity and 3.6 cm luminosity for the youngest protostars, thesenull-detections place upper limits of ~0.1 l_sun (d/140pc)^2 on theluminosities of protostellar sources embedded within these cores. these limits,together with the extended nature of the inward motions inferred from molecularline mapping (lee et al. 2001), are inconsistent with the inside-out collapsemodel of singular isothermal spheres and suggest a less centrally condensedphase of core evolution during the earliest stages of star formation.

astro-ph;0411157	a pre-protostellar core in l1551	large field surveys of nh3, c2s, 13co and c18o in the l1551 dark cloud haverevealed a prolate, pre-protostellar molecular core (l1551-mc) in a relativelyquiescent region to the northwest of the well-known irs 5 source. the kinetictemperature is measured to be 9k, the total mass is ~2msun, and the averageparticle density is 10^4-10^5 cm^(-3). l1551-mc is 2.25' x 1.11' in projectionoriented at a position angle of 133deg. the turbulent motions are on the orderof the sound speed in the medium and contain 4% of the gravitational energy,e_{grav}, of the core. the angular momentum vector is projected along the majoraxis of l1551-mc corresponding to a rotational energy of 2.5e-3(sini)^(-2)|e_{grav}|. the thermal energy constitutes about a third of |e_{grav}|and the virial mass is approximately equal to the total mass. l1551-mc isgravitationally bound and in the absence of strong, ~160 microgauss, magneticfields will likely contract on a ~0.3 myr time scale. the line profiles of manymolecular species suggest that the cold quiescent interior is surrounded by adynamic, perhaps infalling envelope which is embedded within the ambientmolecular gas of l1551.

astro-ph;0509817	a pre-protostellar core in l1551. ii. state of dynamical and chemical  evolution	both analytic and numerical radiative transfer models applied to highspectral resolution cs and n2h+ data give insight into the evolutionary stateof l1551 mc. this recently discovered pre-protostellar core in l1551 appears tobe in the early stages of dynamical evolution. line-of-sight infall velocitiesof &gt;0.1km/s are needed in the outer regions of l1551 mc to adequately fit thedata. this translates to an accretion rate of ~ 1e-6 msun/yr, uncertain towithin a factor of 5 owing to unknown geometry. the observed dynamics are notdue to spherically symmetric gravitational collapse and are not consistent withthe standard model of low-mass star formation. the widespread, fairly uniformcs line asymmetries are more consistent with planar infall. there is modestevidence for chemical depletion in the radial profiles of cs and c18osuggesting that l1551 mc is also chemically young. the models are not verysensitive to chemical evolution. l1551 mc lies within a quiescent region ofl1551 and is evidence for continued star formation in this evolved cloud.
