0901.2255	discovery of a broad iron line in the black-hole candidate swift  j1753.5-0127, and the disk emission in the low/hard state revisited	we analyzed simultaneous archival xmm-newton and rxte observations of thex-ray binary and black hole candidate swift j1753.5-0127. in a previousanalysis of the same data a soft thermal component was found in the x-rayspectrum, and the presence of an accretion disk extending close to theinnermost stable circular orbit was proposed. this is in contrast with thestandard picture in which the accretion disk is truncated at large radii in thelow/hard state. we tested a number of spectral models and we found that severalof them fit the observed spectra without the need of a soft disk-likecomponent. this result implies that the classical paradigm of a truncatedaccretion disk in the low/hard state can not be ruled out by these data. wefurther discovered a broad iron emission line between 6 and 7 kev in thesedata. from fits to the line profile we found an inner disk radius that rangesbetween ~6-16 gravitational radii, which can be in fact much larger, up to ~250gravitational radii, depending on the model used to fit the continuum and theline. we discuss the implications of these results in the context of a fully orpartially truncated accretion disk.

1001.5410	unveiling the hard x-ray spectrum from the "burst-only" source sax  j1753.5-2349 in outburst	discovered in 1996 by bepposax during a single type-i burst event, saxj1753.5-2349 was classified as "burst-only" source. its persistent emission,either in outburst or in quiescence, had never been observed before october2008, when sax j1753.5-2349 was observed for the first time in outburst. basedon integral observations,we present here the first high-energy emission study(above 10 kev) of a so-called "burst-only". during the outburst the saxj1753.5-2349 flux decreased from 10 to 4 mcrab in 18-40 kev, while it was foundbeing in a constant low/hard spectral state. the broad-band (0.3-100 kev)averaged spectrum obtained by combining integral/ibis and swift/xrt data hasbeen fitted with a thermal comptonisation model and an electron temperature &gt;24kev inferred. however, the observed high column density does not allow thedetection of the emission from the neutron star surface. based on the whole setof observations of sax j1753.5-2349, we are able to provide a rough estimate ofthe duty cycle of the system and the time-averaged mass-accretion rate. weconclude that the low to very low luminosity of sax j1753.5-2349 duringoutburst may make it a good candidate to harbor a very compact binary system.

1003.3460	rapid cooling of the neutron star in the quiescent super-eddington  transient xte j1701-462	we present rossi x-ray timing explorer and swift observations made during thefinal three weeks of the 2006-2007 outburst of the super-eddington neutron star(ns) transient xte j1701-462, as well as chandra and xmm-newton observationscovering the first ~800 days of the subsequent quiescent phase. the sourcetransitioned quickly from active accretion to quiescence, with the luminositydropping by over 3 orders of magnitude in ~13 days. the spectra obtained duringquiescence exhibit both a thermal component, presumed to originate in emissionfrom the ns surface, and a non-thermal component of uncertain origin, which hasshown large and irregular variability. we interpret the observed decay of theinferred effective surface temperature of the ns in quiescence as the coolingof the ns crust after having been heated and brought out of thermal equilibriumwith the core during the outburst. the interpretation of the data iscomplicated by an apparent temporary increase in temperature ~220 days intoquiescence, possibly due to an additional spurt of accretion. we derive anexponential decay timescale of ~120 (+30/-20) days for the inferred temperature(excluding observations affected by the temporary increase). this shorttimescale indicates a highly conductive ns crust. further observations areneeded to confirm whether the crust is still slowly cooling or has alreadyreached thermal equilibrium with the core at a surface temperature of ~125 ev.the latter would imply a high equilibrium bolometric thermal luminosity of~5x10^{33} erg/s for an assumed distance of 8.8 kpc.

0708.0211	the long-term evolution of the spin, pulse shape, and orbit of the  accretion-powered millisecond pulsar sax j1808.4-3658	we present a 7 yr timing study of the 2.5 ms x-ray pulsar sax j1808.4-3658,an x-ray transient with a recurrence time of ~2 yr, using data from the rossix-ray timing explorer covering 4 transient outbursts (1998-2005). we verifythat the 401 hz pulsation traces the spin frequency fundamental and not aharmonic. substantial pulse shape variability, both stochastic and systematic,was observed during each outburst. analysis of the systematic pulse shapechanges suggests that, as an outburst dims, the x-ray "hot spot" on the pulsarsurface drifts longitudinally and a second hot spot may appear. the overallpulse shape variability limits the ability to measure spin frequency evolutionwithin a given x-ray outburst (and calls previous nudot measurements of thissource into question), with typical upper limits of |nudot| &lt; 2.5x10^{-14} hz/s(2 sigma). however, combining data from all the outbursts shows with high (6sigma) significance that the pulsar is undergoing long-term spin down at a ratenudot = (-5.6+/-2.0)x10^{-16} hz/s, with most of the spin evolution occurringduring x-ray quiescence. we discuss the possible contributions of magneticpropeller torques, magnetic dipole radiation, and gravitational radiation tothe measured spin down, setting an upper limit of b &lt; 1.5x10^8 g for thepulsar's surface dipole magnetic field and and q/i &lt; 5x10^{-9} for thefractional mass quadrupole moment. we also measured an orbital periodderivative of pdot = (3.5+/-0.2)x10^{-12} s/s. this surprising large pdot isreminiscent of the large and quasi-cyclic orbital period variation observed inthe so-called "black widow" millisecond radio pulsars, supporting speculationthat sax j1808.4-3658 may turn on as a radio pulsar during quiescence. in anappendix we derive an improved (0.15 arcsec) source position from optical data.

1005.3210	xte j1701-462 and its implications for the nature of subclasses in  low-magnetic-field neutron star low-mass x-ray binaries	we report on an analysis of rxte data of the transient neutron star low-massx-ray binary (ns-lmxb) xte j1701-462, obtained during its 2006-2007 outburst.the x-ray properties of the source changed between those of various types ofns-lmxb subclasses. at high luminosities the source switched between two typesof z source behavior and at low luminosities we observed a transition from zsource to atoll source behavior. these transitions between subclasses primarilymanifest themselves as changes in the shapes of the tracks in x-ray color-colorand hardness-intensity diagrams, but they are accompanied by changes in the khzquasi-periodic oscillations, broad-band variability, burst behavior, and/orx-ray spectra. we find that the low-energy x-ray flux is a good parameter totrack the gradual evolution of the tracks in color-color and hardness-intensitydiagrams, allowing us to resolve the evolution of the source in greater detailthan before and relate the observed properties to other ns-lmxbs. we furtherfind that during the transition from z to atoll, characteristic behavior knownas the atoll upper banana can equivalently be described as the final stage of aweakening z source flaring branch, thereby blurring the line between the twosubclasses. our findings strongly suggest that the wide variety in behaviorobserved in ns-lxmbs with different luminosities can be linked through changesin a single variable parameter, namely the mass accretion rate, without theneed for additional differences in the neutron star parameters or viewingangle. we briefly discuss the implications of our findings for the spectralchanges observed in ns lmxbs and suggest that, contrary to what is oftenassumed, the position along the color-color tracks of z sources is notdetermined by the instantaneous mass accretion rate.

1007.2823	quiescent x-ray emission from cen x-4: a variable thermal component	the nearby neutron star low-mass x-ray binary, cen x-4, has been in aquiescent state since its last outburst in 1979. typically, quiescent emissionfrom these objects consists of thermal emission (presumably from the neutronstar surface) with an additional hard power-law tail of unknown nature.variability has been observed during quiescence in cen x-4 on both timescalesas short as hundreds of seconds and as long as years. however, the nature ofthis variability is still unknown. early observations seemed to show it was alldue to a variable hard x-ray tail. here, we present new and archivalobservations that contradict this. the most recent suzaku observation of cenx-4 finds it in a historically low state, a factor of 4.4 fainter than thebrightest quiescent observation. as the spectrum during the brightestobservation was comprised of approximately 60% from the thermal component and40% from the power-law component, such a large change cannot be explained byjust power-law variability. spectral fits with a variable thermal component fitthe data well, while spectral fits allowing both the column density and thepower-law to vary do not, leading to the conclusion that the thermal componentmust be variable. interestingly, we also find that the thermal fraction remainsconsistent between all epochs, implying that the thermal and power-law fluxesvary by approximately the same amount. if the emitting area remains unchangedbetween observations, then the effective surface temperature must change.alternatively, if the temperature remains constant, then the emitting area mustchange. the nature of this thermal variability is unclear, but may be explainedby variable low-level accretion.

1008.4727	continued cooling of the crust in the neutron star low-mass x-ray binary  ks 1731-260	some neutron star low-mass x-ray binaries have very long outbursts (lastingseveral years) which can generate a significant amount of heat in the neutronstar crust. after the system has returned to quiescence, the crust thenthermally relaxes. this provides a rare opportunity to study the thermalproperties of neutron star crusts, putting constraints on the thermalconductivity and hence the structure and composition of the crust. ks 1731-260is one of only four systems where this crustal cooling has been observed. here,we present a new chandra observation of this source approximately 8 years afterthe end of the last outburst, and 4 years since the last observation. we findthat the source has continued to cool, with the cooling curve displaying asimple power-law decay. this suggests that the crust has not fully thermallyrelaxed yet, and may continue to cool further. a simple power law decay is incontrast to theoretical cooling models of the crust, which predict that thecrust should now have cooled to the same temperature as the neutron star core.

0709.0061	grb060602b = swift j1749.4-2807: an unusual transiently accreting  neutron-star x-ray binary	we present an analysis of the swift bat and xrt data of grb060602b, which ismost likely an accreting neutron star in a binary system and not a gamma-rayburst. our analysis shows that the bat burst spectrum is consistent with athermonuclear flash (type-i x-ray burst) from the surface of an accretingneutron star in a binary system. the x-ray binary nature is further confirmedby the report of a detection of a faint point source at the position of the xrtcounterpart of the burst in archival xmm-newton data approximately 6 yearsbefore the burst and in more recent xmm-newton data obtained at the end ofseptember 2006 (nearly 4 months after the burst). since the source is verylikely not a gamma-ray burst, we rename the source swift j1749.4-2807, based onthe swift/bat discovery coordinates. using the bat data of the type-i x-rayburst we determined that the source is at most at a distance of 6.7+-1.3 kpc.for a transiently accreting x-ray binary its soft x-ray behaviour is atypical:its 2-10 kev x-ray luminosity (as measured using the swift/xrt data) decreasedby nearly 3 orders of magnitude in about 1 day, much faster than what isusually seen for x-ray transients. if the earlier phases of the outburst alsoevolved this rapidly, then many similar systems might remain undiscoveredbecause the x-rays are difficult to detect and the type-i x-ray bursts might bemissed by all sky surveying instruments. this source might be part of a classof very-fast transient low-mass x-ray binary systems of which there may be asignificant population in our galaxy.

1101.0081	the variable quiescent x-ray emission of the neutron star transient xte  j1701-462	we present the results of continued monitoring of the quiescent neutron starlow-mass x-ray binary xte j1701-462 with chandra and swift. a new chandraobservation from 2010 october extends our tracking of the neutron star surfacetemperature from ~800 days to ~1160 days since the end of an exceptionallyluminous 19 month outburst. this observation indicates that the neutron starcrust may still be slowly cooling toward thermal equilibrium with the core;another observation further into quiescence is needed to verify this. the shapeof the overall cooling curve is consistent with that of a broken power law,although an exponential decay to a constant level cannot be excluded with thepresent data. to investigate possible low-level activity, we conducted amonitoring campaign of xte j1701-462 with swift during 2010 april-october.short-term flares - presumably arising from episodic low-level accretion - wereobserved up to a luminosity of ~1e35 erg/s, ~20 times higher than the normalquiescent level. we conclude that flares of this magnitude are not likely tohave significantly affected the equilibrium temperature of the neutron star andare probably not able to have a measurable impact on the cooling curve.however, it is possible that brighter and longer periods of low-level activityhave had an appreciable effect on the equilibrium temperature.

0806.1166	cooling of the crust in the neutron star low-mass x-ray binary mxb  1659-29	in quasi-persistent neutron star transients, long outbursts cause the neutronstar crust to be heated out of thermal equilibrium with the rest of the star.during quiescence, the crust then cools back down. such crustal cooling hasbeen observed in two quasi-persistent sources: ks 1731-260 and mxb 1659-29.here we present an additional chandra observation of mxb 1659-29 in quiescence,which extends the baseline of monitoring to 6.6 yr after the end of theoutburst. this new observation strongly suggests that the crust has thermallyrelaxed, with the temperature remaining consistent over 1000 days. fitting thetemperature cooling curve with an exponential plus constant model we determinean e-folding timescale of 465 +/- 25 days, with the crust cooling to a constantsurface temperature of kt = 54 +/- 2 ev (assuming d=10 kpc). from this, weinfer a core temperature in the range 3.5e7-8.3e7 k (assuming d=10 kpc), withthe uncertainty due to the surface composition. importantly, we tested twoneutron star atmosphere models as well as a blackbody model, and found that thethermal relaxation time of the crust is independent of the chosen model and theassumed distance.

astro-ph;0001163	correlated x-ray spectral and timing behavior of the black hole  candidate xte j1550-564: a new interpretation of black hole states	we present an analysis of rxte data of the x-ray transient xte j1550-564. thesource went through several states, which were divided into spectrally soft andhard states. these states showed up as distinct branches in the color-colordiagram, forming a structure with a comb-like topology; the soft state branchforming the spine and the hard state branches forming the teeth. variabilitywas strongly correlated with the position on the branches. the broad band noisebecame stronger, and changed from power law like to band limited, as thespectrum became harder. three types of qpos were found: 1-18 hz and 102-284 hzqpos on the hard branches, and 16-18 hz qpos on and near the soft branch. thefrequencies of the high and low frequency qpos on the hard branches werecorrelated with each other, and anti-correlated with spectral hardness. thechanges in qpo frequency suggest that the inner disc radius only increases by afactor of 3-4 as the source changes from a soft to a hard state. our results onxte j1550-564 strongly favor a 2-dimensional description of black holebehavior, where the regions near the spine of the comb in the color-colordiagram can be identified with the high state, and the teeth with transitionsfrom the high state, via the intermediate state (which includes the very highstate) to the low state, and back. the two physical parameters underlying thisbehavior vary to a large extent independently and could for example be the massaccretion rate through the disk and the size of a comptonizing region.

astro-ph;0002074	simultaneous measurements of x-ray luminosity and kilohertz  quasi-periodic oscillations in low-mass x-ray binaries	we measure simultaneously the properties of the energy spectra and thefrequencies of the kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations (qpos) in fifteen lowmass x-ray binaries covering a wide range of x-ray luminosities. in each sourcethe qpo frequencies cover the same range of approximately 300 hz to 1300 hz,though the sources differ by two orders of magnitude in their x-rayluminosities (as measured from the unabsorbed 2-50 kev flux). so the x-rayluminosity does not uniquely determine the qpo frequency. this is difficult tounderstand since the evidence from individual sources indicates that thefrequency and luminosity are very well correlated at least over shorttimescales. perhaps beaming effects or bolometric corrections change theobserved luminosities, or perhaps part of the energy in mass accretion is usedto power outflows reducing the energy emitted in x-rays. it is also possiblethat the parameters of a qpo model are tuned in such a way that the same rangeof frequencies appears in all sources. different modes of accretion may beinvolved for example (disk and radial) or multiple parameters may conspire toyield the same frequencies.

astro-ph;0008526	discovery of nearly coherent oscillations with a frequency of ~567 hz  during type-i x-ray bursts of the x-ray transient and eclipsing binary x  1658-298	we report the discovery of nearly coherent oscillations with a frequency of567 hz during type-i x-ray bursts from the x-ray transient and eclipsing binaryx 1658-298. if these oscillations are directly related to the neutron starrotation then the spin period of the neutron star in x 1658-298 is 1.8 ms. theoscillations can be present during the rise or decay phase of the bursts.oscillations during the decay phase of the bursts show an increase in thefrequency of 0.5 to 1 hz. however, in one particular burst the oscillationsreappear at the end of the decay phase at about 571.5 hz. this represents anincrease in oscillation frequency of about 5 hz which is the largest frequencychange seen so far in a burst oscillation. it is unclear if such a large changecan be accommodated by present models used to explain the frequency evolutionof the oscillations. the oscillations at 571.5 hz are unusually soft comparedto the oscillations found at 567 hz. we also observed several bursts duringwhich the oscillations are detected at much lower significance or not at all.most of these bursts happen during periods of x-ray dipping behavior,suggesting that the x-ray dipping might decrease the amplitude of theoscillations (although several complications exist with this simple picture).we discuss our discovery in the framework of the neutron star spininterpretation.

astro-ph;0010166	normal-branch quasi-periodic oscillations during the high intensity  state of cygnus x-2	using data obtained with the rossi x-ray timing explorer, we report thedetection of a 5 hz quasi-periodic oscillation (qpo) in the bright low-massx-ray binary and z source cygnus x-2 during high overall intensities (the highintensity state). this qpo was detected on the so-called normal branch and canbe identified with the normal branch qpo or nbo. our detection of the nbo isthe first one during times when cygnus x-2 was in the high intensity state. therms amplitude of this qpo decreased from 2.8% between 2-3.1 kev to &lt;1.9%between 5.0-6.5 kev. above 6.5 kev, its amplitude rapidly increased to ~12% rmsabove 16 kev. the time lags of the qpo were consistent with being zero below 5kev (compared to the 2-3.1 kev band), but they rapidly increased to ~70 msaround 10 kev, above which the time lags remained approximately constant near70 ms. the photon energy dependencies of the rms amplitude and the time lagsare very similar to those observed for the nbo with other satellites (ginga,exosat) at different (i.e. lower) intensity states.

astro-ph;0104421	a detailed study of the 5 hz quasi-periodic oscillations in the bright  x-ray transient and black-hole candidate grs 1739-278	we present a detailed study of the 5 hz quasi-periodic oscillation (qpo)recently discovered in the bright x-ray transient and black-hole candidate grs1739-278 (borozdin &amp; trudolyubov 2000) during a rossi x-ray timing explorerobservation taken on 1996 march 31. in total 6.6 ksec of on-source data wereobtained, divided in two data sets of 3.4 and 3.2 ksec which were separated by2.6 ksec. the 5 hz qpo was only present during the second data set. the qpoincreased in strength from below 2% rms amplitude for photon energies below 4kev to ~5% rms amplitude for energies above 10 kev. the soft qpo photons (below5 kev) lagged the hard ones (above 10 kev) by almost 1.5 radian. besides theqpo fundamental, its first overtone was detected. the strength of the overtoneincreased with photon energy (from &lt;2% rms below 5 kev to ~8% rms above 10kev). although the limited statistics did not allow for an accuratedetermination of the lags of the first overtone, indications are that also forthis qpo the soft photons lagged the hard ones. when the 5 hz qpo was notdetected (i.e., during the first part of the observation), a broad noisecomponent was found for photon energies below 10 kev but it became almost atrue qpo (with a q value of ~1.9) above that energy, with a frequency of ~3 hz.its hard photons preceded the soft ones in a way reminiscent of the 5 hz qpo,strongly suggesting that both features are physically related. we discuss ourfinding in the frame work of low-frequency qpos and their properties in bhcs.

astro-ph;0105182	the new x-ray transient sax j1711.6-3808: decoupling between its 3-20  kev luminosity and its state transitions	we present a study of the correlated spectral and timing behavior of the newx-ray transient sax j1711.6-3808 during its 2001 outburst using data obtainedwith the rxte. we also investigate the correlations between those sourceproperties and the 3-20 kev x-ray luminosity. the behavior of the source duringthe observations can be divided into two distinct state types. during the hardstate, the energy spectra are relatively hard and can be described by only apower-law component, and the characteristic frequencies (i.e., the frequency ofthe 1-7 hz qpos observed for the first time in this source) in the powerspectra are low. however, during the ``soft'' state, the spectra areconsiderably softer (in addition to the power-law component, a soft componentis necessary to fit the spectra) and the frequencies are the highest observed.remarkably, this distinction into two separate states cannot be extrapolated toalso include the 3-20 kev x-ray luminosity. except for one observation, thisluminosity steadily decreased but the hard state was observed both at thehighest and lowest observed luminosities. in contrast, the soft state occurredonly at intermediate luminosities. this clearly demonstrates that the statebehavior of sax j1711.6-3808 is decoupled from its x-ray luminosity and that ifthe x-ray luminosity traces the accretion rate in sax j1711.6-3808, then thestate transitions are not good accretion rate indicators, or vice versa. thedata of sax j1711.6-3808 does not allow us to conclusively determine its exactnature. the source resembles both neutron star and black hole systems when theyhave low luminosities. we discuss our results with respect to the correlatedtiming and spectral behavior observed in other lmxbs and the implications ofour results on the modeling of the outburst light curves of x-ray transients.

astro-ph;0105421	very low luminosities from the accretion-driven millisecond x-ray pulsar  sax j1808.4-3658 during quiescence	we have observed the millisecond x-ray pulsar sax j1808.4-3658 on threeoccasions during its 2000 outburst with the bepposax satellite. the source washighly variable and erratic during this outburst, and by coincidence weobtained data only during times when the source had very low luminosities.during our observations, we detected four faint sources. the source closest tothe position of sax j1808.4-3658 is still ~1.6' away. this source can only beidentified with sax j1808.4-3658 if we assume that the bepposax positionalreconstruction is not completely understood. we also reanalyzed a bepposaxobservation taken in march 1999 when the source was in quiescence and duringwhich the source was thought to have been detected (stella et al. 2000). basedon the similarities (position and luminosity) of this source with the abovementioned source ~1.6' away from sax j1808.4-3658, it is possible that they arethe same source. if this source is not the millisecond pulsar, then during allbepposax observations of sax j1808.4-3658 (the 2000 outburst ones and the 1999quiescent one), the millisecond pulsar was not detected. a reanalysis of theasca quiescent data of sax j1808.4-3658 (dotani, asai, &amp; wijnands 2000)confirms that during this observation the source was securely detected inquiescence. we discuss our results for sax j1808.4-3658 in the context of thequiescent properties of low-mass x-ray binary transients.

astro-ph;0105446	the erratic luminosity behavior of sax j1808.4-3658 during its 2000  outburst	we report on the highly variable and erratic long-term x-ray luminositybehavior of the only known accretion-driven millisecond x-ray pulsar saxj1808.4-3658 during its 2000 outburst, as observed with rxte. the maximumobserved luminosity is ~2.5 x 10^35 erg s^-1 (3-25 kev; for a distance of 2.5kpc), which is a factor of ~10 lower than that observed during the 1996 and1998 outbursts. due to solar constraints, the source could not be observed forseveral months with rxte before 21 jan. 2000. therefore, the exact moment ofthe outburst onset is unknown and the peak luminosity could have beensignificantly higher. on some occasions sax j1808.4-3658 was observed withluminosities of ~10^35 erg s^-1, but on other occasions it could not bedetected with rxte resulting in upper limits of a few times 10^33 erg s^-1(3-25 kev). the non-detections of the source during its 2000 outburst obtainedwith bepposax demonstrate that its luminosity was at times &lt;10^32 erg s^-1(0.5-10 kev). however, only a few days after these bepposax observations, wedetected the source again with rxte at high luminosities, giving a factor of&gt;1000 of luminosity swings in this system on time scales of days. the lastdetection of sax j1808.4-3658 with rxte was on 2000 may 13, almost 4 monthsafter the first detection. due to the lack of sensitivity and observationsduring the 1996 and 1998 outbursts, it cannot be excluded that after thoseoutbursts the source remained active for months and that the source behaviorduring the 2000 outburst is not unique. long duration activity at lowluminosities has been observed in other transients (both neutron stars andblack holes), although not with such extreme variability which might point to adifferent origin for this behavior for the pulsar.

astro-ph;0307029	nuclear-powered millisecond pulsars and the maximum spin frequency of  neutron stars	millisecond pulsars are neutron stars (nss) that are thought to have beenspun-up by mass accretion from a stellar companion. it is unknown whether thereis a natural brake for this process, or if it continues until the centrifugalbreakup limit is reached at submillisecond periods. many nss that are accretingfrom a companion exhibit thermonuclear x-ray bursts that last tens of seconds,caused by unstable nuclear burning on their surfaces. millisecond brightnessoscillations during bursts from ten nss (as distinct from other rapid x-rayvariability that is also observed) are thought to measure the stellar spin, butdirect proof of a rotational origin has been lacking. here, we report thedetection of burst oscillations at the known spin frequency of an accretingmillisecond pulsar, and we show that these oscillations always have the samerotational phase. this firmly establishes burst oscillations as nuclear-poweredpulsations tracing the spin of accreting nss, corroborating earlier evidence.the distribution of spin frequencies of the 11 nuclear-powered pulsars cuts offwell below the breakup frequency for most ns models, supporting theoreticalpredictions that gravitational radiation losses can limit accretion torques inspinning up millisecond pulsars.

astro-ph;0309741	chandra detections of two quiescent black hole x-ray transients	using the chandra x-ray observatory, we have detected the black holetransients v4641 sgr and xte j1859+226 in their low luminosity, quiescentstates. the 0.3-8 kev luminosities are (4.0^(+3.3)_(-2.4))e31 (d/7 kpc)^2 erg/sand (4.2^(+4.8)_(-2.2))e31 (d/11 kpc)^2 erg/s for v4641 sgr and xte j1859+226,respectively. with the addition of these 2 systems, 14 out of the 15 transientswith confirmed black holes (via compact object mass measurements) now havemeasured quiescent luminosities or sensitive upper limits. the only exceptionis grs 1915+105, which has not been in quiescence since its discovery in 1992.the luminosities for v4641 sgr and xte j1859+226 are consistent with the medianluminosity of 2e31 erg/s for the systems with previous detections. our analysissuggests that the quiescent x-ray spectrum of v4641 sgr is harder than for theother systems in this group, but, due to the low statistical quality of thespectrum, it is not clear if v4641 sgr is intrinsically hard or if the columndensity is higher than the interstellar value. focusing on v4641 sgr, wecompare our results to theoretical models for x-ray emission from black holesin quiescence. also, we obtain precise x-ray positions for v4641 sgr and xtej1859+226 via cross-correlation of the x-ray sources detected near our targetswith ir sources in the 2 micron all-sky survey catalog.

astro-ph;0310144	the hard quiescent spectrum of the neutron-star x-ray transient exo  1745-248 in the globular cluster terzan 5	we present a chandra observation of the globular cluster terzan 5 duringtimes when the neutron-star x-ray transient exo 1745-248 located in thiscluster was in its quiescent state. we detected the quiescent system with a(0.5-10 kev) luminosity of ~2 x 10^{33} ergs/s. this is similar to severalother neutron-star transients observed in their quiescent states. however, thequiescent x-ray spectrum of exo 1745--48 was dominated by a hard power-lawcomponent instead of the soft component that usually dominates the quiescentemission of other neutron-star x-ray transients. this soft component could notconclusively be detected in exo 1745-248 and we conclude that it contributed atmost 10% of the quiescent flux in the energy range 0.5-10 kev. exo 1745-248 isonly the second neutron-star transient whose quiescent spectrum is dominated bythe hard component (sax j1808.4-3658 is the other one). we discuss possibleexplanations for this unusual behavior of exo 1745-248, its relationship toother quiescent neutron-star systems, and the impact of our results onunderstanding quiescent x-ray binaries. we also discuss the implications of ourresults on the way the low-luminosity x-ray sources in globular clusters areclassified.

astro-ph;0310271	xmm-newton light curves of the low-mass x-ray binary exo 0748--676:  dips, eclipses, and bursts	we present an analysis of xmm-newton light curves of the dipping, bursting,and eclipsing low-mass x-ray binary exo 0748-676, focusing on the variabilityon time scales of seconds to hours. the observed variability can be roughlydivided in three types: dips, eclipses and bursts. we find that the appearanceof the latter two, depends strongly on the strength of the first. we show thatthe absorption dips change from spectrally hard to spectrally soft as theybecome deeper, which supports suggestions that the source is composed of aspectrally hard compact source and a spectrally soft extended source. the fastvariability in the soft light curve indicates that the large structures causingthe dips are made up of smaller absorption cores. we present the first cleardetection with xmm-newton of eclipses below 2 kev in this source, and show thatdipping activity is apparently unrelated to the source luminosity. we also testseveral proposed models for the spectral evolution during dips and confirm thepresence of a scatter/reflection component in the eclipse spectrum.

astro-ph;0310612	monitoring chandra observations of the quasi-persistent neutron-star  x-ray transient mxb 1659-29 in quiescence: the cooling curve of the heated  neutron-star crust	we have observed the quasi-persistent neutron-star x-ray transient andeclipsing binary mxb 1659-29 in quiescence on three occasions with chandra. thepurpose of our observations was to monitor the quiescent behavior of the sourceafter its last prolonged (~2.5 years) outburst which ended in september 2001.the x-ray spectra of the source are consistent with thermal radiation from theneutron-star surface. we found that the bolometric flux of the source decreasedby a factor of 7-9 over the time-span of 1.5 years between our first and lastchandra observations. the effective temperature also decreased, by a factor of1.6-1.7. the decrease in time of the bolometric flux and effective temperaturecan be described using exponential decay functions, with e-folding times of 0.7and ~3 years, respectively. our results are consistent with the hypothesis thatwe observed a cooling neutron-star crust which was heated considerably duringthe prolonged accretion event and which is still out of thermal equilibriumwith the neutron-star core. we could only determine upper-limits for anyluminosity contribution due to the thermal state of the neutron-star core. therapid cooling of the neutron-star crust implies that it has a large thermalconductivity. our results also suggest that enhanced cooling processes arepresent in the neutron-star core.

astro-ph;0405089	crust cooling curves of accretion-heated neutron stars	we discuss the recent efforts to use a sub-class of neutron-star x-raytransients (the quasi-persistent transients) to probe the properties ofneutron-star crusts and cores. quasi-persistent x-ray transients experienceaccretion episodes lasting years to decades, instead of the usual weeks tomonths of ordinary, short-duration transients. these prolonged accretionepisodes should significantly heat the crusts of the neutron stars in thesesystems, bringing the crusts out of thermal equilibrium with their neutron-starcores. when these systems are back in quiescence, i.e. when no more accretiononto the neutron-star surfaces occurs, then the crusts should thermally radiatein x-rays, cooling them down until they are again in thermal equilibrium withthe cores. in this chapter we discuss the recent x-ray monitoring campaigns weperformed (using the x-ray satellites chandra and xmm-newton) to study severalquasi-persistent neutron-star x-ray transients in their quiescent states. theseobservations gave us, for the first time, a detailed look into the coolingcurves of accretion heated neutron-star crusts. in this chapter, we discuss howthese crust cooling curves can provide insight into the structure of neutronstars.

astro-ph;0406057	chandra observations of the accretion-driven millisecond x-ray pulsars  xte j0929-314 and xte j1751-305 in quiescence	(abridge) we observed the accreting millisecond x-ray pulsars xte j0929-314and xte j1751-305 in their quiescent states using chandra. from xte j0929-314we detected 22 photons (0.3-8 kev) in 24.4 ksec, resulting in a count rate of 9x 10^{-4} c/s. the small number of photons detected did not allow for adetailed spectral analysis, but we can demonstrate that the spectrum is harderthan simple thermal emission which is what is usually presumed to arise from acooling neutron star that has been heated during the outbursts. assuming apower-law model for the spectrum, we obtain a power-law index of ~1.8 and anunabsorbed flux of 6 x 10^{-15} ergs/s/cm^2 (0.5-10 kev), resulting in aluminosity of 7 x 10^{31} (d/10 kpc)^2 ergs/s, with d in kpc. no thermalcomponent could be detected; such a component contributed at most 30% to the0.5-10 kev flux. variability in the count rate of xte j0929-314 was observed atthe 95% confidence level. we did not conclusively detect xte j1751-305 in our43 ksec observation, with 0.5-10 kev flux upper limits between 0.2 and 2.7 x10^{-14} ergs/s/cm^2 depending on assumed spectral shape, resulting inluminosity upper limits of 0.2 - 2 x 10^{32} (d/8 kpc)^2 ergs/s. we compare ourresults with those obtained for other neutron-star x-ray transients in theirquiescent state. using simple accretion disk physics in combination with ourmeasured quiescent luminosity of xte j0929-314 and the luminosity upper limitsof xte j1751-305, and the known spin frequency of the neutron stars, we couldconstrain the magnetic field of the neutron stars in xte j0929-314 and xtej1751-305 to be less than 3 x 10^9 (d/10 kpc) and 3 - 7 x 10^8 (d/8 kpc) gauss(depending on assumed spectral shape of the quiescent spectrum), respectively.

astro-ph;0406334	high- and low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations in the x-ray light  curves of the black hole transient h1743-322	we present a variability study of the black hole candidate and x-raytransient h1743-322 during its 2003/2004 outburst. we analyzed five rossi x-raytiming explorer observations that were performed as part of a multi-wavelengthcampaign, as well as six observations from the early rise of the outburst. thesource was observed in several black hole states and showed various types ofx-ray variability, including high frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (qpos)at 240 hz and 160 hz (i.e. with a 3:2 frequency ratio), several types of lowfrequency qpos, and strong variations on a time scale of a few hundred seconds.the discovery of high frequency qpos in h1743-322 supports predictions thatthese qpos should be more easily observed in high inclination systems. in oneof our observations we observed a transition in count rate and color, duringwhich we were able to follow the smooth evolution of the low-frequency qposfrom type-b to type-a. we classify the x-ray observations and qpos, and brieflydiscuss the qpos in terms of recently proposed models.

astro-ph;0407448	x-ray variability during the quiescent state of the neutron-star x-ray  transient in the globular cluster ngc 6440	the globular cluster ngc 6440 is known to harbor a bright neutron-star x-raytransient. we observed the globular cluster with chandra on two occasions whenthe bright transient was in its quiescent state in july 2000 and june 2003(both observations were made nearly 2 years after the end of their precedingoutbursts). the quiescent spectrum during the first observation is wellrepresented by a two component model (a neutron-star atmosphere model plus apower-law component which dominates at energies above 2 kev). during the secondobservation (which was roughly of equal duration to the first observation) wefound that the power-law component could no longer be detected. our spectralfits indicate that the effective temperature of the neutron-star surface wasconsistent between the two observations. we conclude that the effect of thechange in power-law component caused the 0.5-10 kev flux to be a factor of ~2lower during the second observation compared to the first observation. wediscuss plausible explanations for the variations, including variable residualaccretion onto the neutron star magnetosphere or some variation in theinteraction of the pulsar wind with the matter still outflowing from thecompanion star.

astro-ph;0511486	the faintest accretors	recent x-ray observations have detected a class of very faint x-raytransients in the galaxy which probably reveal a previously unrecognised typeof accretion on to neutron stars or black holes. we show that these systemscannot have descended from binaries with stellar-mass components of normalcomposition. accretion of hydrogen-depleted matter on to stellar-mass blackholes can account for individual systems, but requires that these transientsshould be observed to repeat within a few years, and does not explain why theclass is distinctly faint.  two other explanations appear to be quite natural. one invokes accretion byneutron stars or stellar-mass black holes from companions which were alreadybrown dwarfs or planets when the systems formed, i.e. which did not descendfrom low-mass stars. the other possibility is that these systems are theendpoints of primordial (zero-metallicity) binaries in which the primary wasextremely massive, and collapsed to a black hole of mass &gt; 1000 solar masses.the (primordial) companion must by now have reached an extremely low mass (&lt;0.01 solar mass) and be transferring mass at a very low rate to the black hole.this picture avoids the main difficulty encountered by models invokingintermediate-mass black hole formation at non-primordial metallicities, and isa natural consequence of some current ideas about population iii starformation.

astro-ph;0603708	xmm-newton discovery of the x-ray transient xmmu j181227.8-181234 in the  galactic plane	we report the discovery of an x-ray transient, observed in outburst withxmm-newton on march 20, 2003, and with position 18h12m27.8s, -18 12 34 (j2000,approximate positional error 2"). no known source is present at this positionand the source was not detected during published rosat or asca observations ofthat region. however, the source may be associated with 1h1812-182 detected byheao 1, although the error bars on the heao 1 position are very large and thetwo sources could also be unrelated. therefore, we name the source xmmuj181227.8-181234. initially, the source was not detected using the all-skymonitor (asm) on-board the rossi x-ray timing explorer, however, reprocessingof the asm data shows that the source was in fact detected and it was activefor about 50 days. the x-ray spectrum of this transient is fitted equally wellby an absorbed power-law (with a spectral index of 2.5) or multi-colour diskblackbody model (with kt ~ 2 kev), where we find that the source is highlyabsorbed. we detect an unabsorbed 0.5-10 kev flux in the range (2-5)e-9 ergscm^{-2} s^{-1}, which at a distance of 8 kpc corresponds to a 0.5-10 kevluminosity of (1-4)e37 ergs s^{-1}. no pulsations were detected by timinganalysis. a colour-colour diagram from asm data of different accreting objectssuggests that the transient is a high-mass x-ray binary, as is also suggestedby the high absorption compared to the average interstellar value in thedirection of the source. however, the power-law spectral index is far moretypical of a low-mass x-ray binary. thus, we are unable to conclusivelyidentify the nature of the transient. we also report on three sources firstdetected by the asca galactic plane survey that are close to this transient.

astro-ph;0610803	rxte observations of the first transient z source xte j1701-462:  shedding new light on mass accretion in luminous neutron star lmxbs	(abridged) we report on ten weeks of rxte observations of the x-ray transientxte j1701-462. comparisons with other sources suggest it had all thecharacteristics of the neutron star z sources (the brightest persistent neutronstar lmxbs). these include z tracks in x-ray color diagrams and typicalvariability components detected in the power spectra. xte j1701-462 is thefirst transient z source and provides unique insights into mass accretion rate(mdot) and luminosity dependencies in neutron star lmxbs. as its overallluminosity decreased, we observed a switch between two types of z-sourcebehavior, with most of the branches of the z-track changing their shape and/ororientation. we interpret this switch as an extreme case of the longtermchanges seen in the persistent z sources and suggest that these result fromchanges in mdot. we also suggest that the cyg-like z sources (cyg x-2, gx 5-1,and gx 340+0) might be more luminous (&gt; 50%) than the sco-like z sources (scox-1, gx 17+2, and gx 349+2). adopting a possible explanation for the behaviorof khz qpos, which involves a prompt as well as a filtered response to changesin mdot, we propose that changes in mdot can explain both movement along the ztrack and changes in the shape of the z track. we discuss some consequences ofthis and consider the possibility that the branches of the z will evolve intothe branches observed in the x-ray color diagrams of the less luminous atollsources, but not in a way that was previously suggested.

astro-ph;9801018	discovery of kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations in 4u 1735-44	we discovered a single khz quasi-periodic oscillation (qpo) near 1150 hz inthe rossi x-ray timing explorer x-ray light curve of the low mass x-ray binaryand atoll source 4u 1735-44. the rms amplitude of this peak was 2-3%, and thefwhm 6-40 hz. there are indications that the khz qpo frequency decreased from1160 hz to 1145 hz when the count rate increased, which would be quitedifferent from what is observed in other atoll sources for which khz qpos havebeen discovered. in the x-ray color-color diagram and hardness-intensitydiagram the source traced out the curved branch (the so-called banana branch)which has been found by previous instruments. the khz qpo was only detectedwhen the source was at the lowest count rates during our observations, i.e. onthe lower part of the banana branch. when 4u 1735-44 was at higher count rates,i.e. on the upper part of the banana branch and at higher inferred massaccretion rate with respect to that on the lower part of the banana branch, theqpo was not detected.  besides the khz qpo we discovered a low frequency qpo with a frequency near67 hz, together with a complex broad peaked noise component below 30 hz. this67 hz qpo may be related to the magnetospheric beat-frequency qpo, which isobserved on the horizontal branch of z sources. this idea is supported by the(peaked) noise found in both 4u 1735-44 and z sources at frequencies just belowthe qpo frequency.

astro-ph;9804216	discovery of the first accretion-powered millisecond x-ray pulsar	the precise origins of the millisecond radio pulsars, discovered in the early1980s, remain uncertain until this day. they plausibly evolve from accretinglow magnetic-field neutron stars in x-ray binary systems. if so, these starsshould spin at millisecond rates. in accordance with this idea, quasi-periodicoscillations discovered in x-ray binaries around 50 hz and 1 khz, and driftingoscillations at several 100 hz in x-ray bursts have all been interpreted interms of millisecond spins of weakly magnetized neutron stars. however, in 15years of searching, the expected coherent millisecond signals from x-raybinaries remained elusive. in this letter, we report the discovery of the firstexample of such a signal. using the rossi x-ray timing explorer we findpersistent 2.49 millisecond x-ray pulsations in an x-ray binary, which weinterpret to come from an accretion-powered millisecond x-ray pulsar in thesystem. this is the first known object of its kind. it is likely to switch onas a millisecond radio pulsar when the accretion turns off completely. thesource is positionally coincident with the known transient x-ray burster saxj1808.4-3658, which also makes this the first x-ray pulsar which exhibitsthermonuclear x-ray bursts.

astro-ph;9807281	kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillation peak separation is not constant in  the atoll source 4u 1608-52	we present new rossi x-ray timing explorer observations of the low-mass x-raybinary 4u 1608-52 during the decay of its 1998 outburst. we detect by a directfft method the existence of a second kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillation (khzqpo) in its power density spectrum, previously only seen by means of thesensitivity-enhancing `shift and add' technique. this result confirms that 4u1608-52 is a twin khz qpo source. the frequency separation between these twoqpo decreased significantly, from 325.5 +/- 3.4 hz to 225.3 +/- 12.0 hz, as thefrequency of the lower khz qpo increased from 470 hz to 865 hz, incontradiction with a simple beat-frequency interpretation. this change in thepeak separation of the khz qpos is closely similar to that previously seen insco x-1, but takes place at a ten times lower average luminosity. we discussthis result within the framework of models that have been proposed for khz qpo.beat frequency models where the peak separation is identified with the neutronstar spin rate, as well as the explanations previously proposed to account forthe similar behavior of the qpos in sco x-1, are strongly challenged by thisresult.

astro-ph;9808303	the broad-band power spectrum of sax j1808.4-3658	we analyzed the rapid aperiodic x-ray variability of the recently discoveredmillisecond x-ray pulsar sax j1808.4-3658. the power density spectrum isdominated by a strong band-limited noise component, which follows a power-lawwith index 1.0-1.3 at high frequencies with a break that varies between 0.25and 1.6 hz, below which the spectrum is relatively flat. superimposed on this,a broad bump is present with a centroid frequency that varies well correlatedwith the break frequency between 2.4 and 12.0 hz. these characteristics arevery similar to what is commonly seen in other low-luminosity low-mass x-raybinaries. between 100 and 400 hz a third broad noise component is presentsimilar to that recently reported in the low-luminosity low-mass x-ray binary4u 1728-34 (ford &amp; van der klis 1998). we find a similar high-frequency noisecomponent also in other low-luminosity neutron star systems. we conclude thatat any given epoch the rapid aperiodic x-ray variability of the millisecondx-ray pulsar is indistinguishable from that of other low-luminosity neutronstar systems.  however, contrary to what has been found in those sources the break frequencyof the band-limited noise does not have a strict correlation with massaccretion rate. with decreasing mass accretion rate, the break frequency firstdecreased, then increased again. this previously unobserved behavior could betypical for the very low mass accretion rates we observe near the end of theoutburst of sax j1808.4-3658, or it could be related to it being a pulsar.

astro-ph;9810342	the broad-band power spectra of x-ray binaries	we analyzed the rapid aperiodic x-ray variability of different types of x-raybinaries (black hole candidates, atoll sources, the recently discoveredmillisecond x-ray pulsar, and z sources) at their lowest inferred massaccretion rates. at these accretion rates, the power spectra of all sources aredominated by a strong band-limited noise component, which follows a power lawwith an index roughly 1 at high frequencies and breaks at a frequency between0.02 and 32 hz below which the spectrum is relatively flat. superimposed onthis, a broad bump (sometimes a quasi-periodic oscillation) is present with a0.2-67 hz centroid frequency that varies in good correlation with the frequencyof the break. the black hole candidates and the low-luminosity neutron starsystems (including the millisecond x-ray pulsar) have the same relation betweenthe frequency of the bump and the frequency of the break. these similarcharacteristics strongly suggest that in all those different types of sourcesthe band-limited noise and the bump are produced by the same physicalmechanism. this mechanism cannot then depend on the presence or absence ofeither a small magnetosphere or a solid surface, so that it is most likelyrelated to an instability in the flow in the accretion disk that modulates theaccretion rate.  the z sources, which are more luminous than the other sources discussed here,follow a similar, but slightly shifted correlation between the break frequencyand the frequency of the bump. the data suggest that the band-limited noise inz sources is more complex than that in the other sources.

astro-ph;9811261	dependence of the frequency of the kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations  on x-ray count rate and colors in 4u 1608-52	we present new results based on observations carried out with the rossi x-raytiming explorer during the decay of an outburst of the low-mass x-ray binary(lmxb) and atoll source 4u 1608-52. our results appear to resolve, at least in4u 1608-52, one of the long-standing issues about the phenomenology of thekilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations (khz qpos), namely, the lack of a uniquerelation between the frequency of the khz qpos and the x-ray flux. we show thatdespite its complex dependence on the x-ray flux, the frequency of the khz qposis monotonically related to the position of the source in the color-colordiagram. our findings strengthen the idea that, as in the case of z sources, inthe atoll sources the x-ray flux is not a good indicator of $\dot m$, and thatthe observed changes in the frequency of the khz qpos in lmxbs are driven bychanges in $\dot m$. these results raise some concern about the recentlyreported detection of the orbital frequency at the innermost stable orbit in 4u1820-30.

astro-ph;9811404	a persistent ~1 hz quasi-periodic oscillation in the dipping low-mass  x-ray binary 4u 1323-62	we have discovered a ~1 hz quasi-periodic oscillation (qpo) in thepersistent-emission, the dips, and the type i x-ray bursts of the low-massx-ray binary 4u 1323-62. the rms amplitude of the qpo is approximately 9%, onlyweakly depending on photon energy. the amplitude is consistent with beingconstant throughout the persistent-emission, the dips and the bursts in all butone observation, where it is much weaker during one dip. these propertiessuggest that we have observed a new type of qpo, which is caused byquasi-periodic obscuration of the central x-ray source by a structure in theaccretion disk. this can only occur when the binary inclination is high,consistent with the fact that 4u 1323-62 is a dipping source. thequasi-periodic obscuration could take place by partial covering of an extendedcentral x-ray source by a near-opaque medium, or by covering of a point sourceby a medium of suitable characteristics to produce the relativelyenergy-independent oscillations.

astro-ph;9812244	discovery of a ~7 hz quasi-periodic oscillation in the low-luminosity  low-mass x-ray binary 4u 1820-30	we have discovered a 7.06+-0.08 hz quasi-periodic oscillation (qpo) in thex-ray flux of the low-luminosity low-mass x-ray binary (lmxb) and atoll source4u 1820-30. this qpo was only observable at the highest observed mass accretionrate, when the source was in the uppermost part of the banana branch, at a 2-25kev luminosity of 5.4x10^37 erg/s (for a distance of 6.4 kpc). the qpo had afwhm of only 0.5+-0.2 hz during small time intervals (32-s of data), and showederratic shifts in the centroid frequency between 5.5 and 8 hz. the rmsamplitude over the energy range 2-60 kev was 5.6%+-0.2%. the amplitudeincreased with photon energy from 3.7%+-0.5% between 2.8 and 5.3 kev to7.3%+-0.6% between 6.8 and 9.3 kev, above which it remained approximatelyconstant at ~7%. the time lag of the qpo between 2.8-6.8 and 6.8-18.2 kev wasconsistent with being zero (-1.2+-3.4 ms).  the properties of the qpo (i.e., its frequency and its presence only at thehighest observed mass accretion rate) are similar to those of the 5-20 hz qpoobserved in the highest luminosity lmxbs (the z sources) when they areaccreting near the eddington mass accretion limit. if this is indeed the samephenomenon, then models explaining the 5-20 hz qpo in the z sources, whichrequire the near-eddington accretion rates, will not hold. assuming isotropicemission, the 2-25 kev luminosity of 4u 1820-30 at the time of the 7 hz qpos isat maximum only 40% (for a companion star with cosmic abundances), but mostlikely ~20% (for a helium companion star) of the eddington accretion limit.

astro-ph;9902383	the discovery of a 7-14 hz quasi-periodic oscillation in the x-ray  transient xte j1806-246	we have studied the correlated x-ray spectral and x-ray timing behavior ofthe x-ray transient xte j1806-246 using data obtained with the proportionalcounter array onboard the rossi x-ray timing explorer. in the x-ray color-colordiagram two distinct patterns are traced out. the first pattern is a curvedbranch, which is observed during the rise and the decay of the outburst. thispattern resembles the so-called banana branch of those low-luminosity neutronstar low-mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs) which are referred to as atoll sources.the power spectrum of xte j1806-246 on this curved branch consisted of a powerlaw and a cutoff power law component. the presence of these components andtheir dependence on position of the source on the branch is also identical tothe behavior of atoll sources on the banana branch. near the end of it outburstxte j1806-246 formed patches in the color-color diagram, the spectrum washarder, and the power spectrum showed strong band limited noise, characteristicof the atoll sources in the island state. a second pattern was traced outduring the only observation at the peak of the outburst. it consists of astructure which we interpret as formed by two distinct branches. this patternresembles the normal-flaring branches of the high-luminosity neutron star lmxbs(the z sources). the discovery of a 7-14 hz qpo during this observationstrengthens this similarity. we conclude that if xte j1806-246 is a neutronstar, it is most likely an atoll source that only at the peak of its outburstreached a luminosity level sufficiently high to show the type of qpo that zsources who on their normal and flaring branches.

astro-ph;9903105	on the magnetospheric beat-frequency and lense-thirring interpretations  of the horizontal branch oscillation in the z sources	we study the horizontal branch oscillations (hbo) and the two simultaneouskilohertz qpos comparing their properties in five z sources with thepredictions of the magnetospheric beat-frequency and lense-thirring precessionmodels. we find that the variation of the hbo frequency with accretion ratepredicted by the magnetospheric beat-frequency model for a purely dipolarstellar magnetic field and a radiation-pressure-dominated inner accretion diskagrees well with the observed variation. this model implies that the neutronstars in the z sources are near magnetic spin equilibrium, that their magneticfield strengths are ~10^9-10^10 g, and that the critical fastness parameter forthese sources is &gt;0.8. if the frequency of the upper kilohertz qpo is anorbital frequency in the accretion disk, the magnetospheric beat-frequencymodel requires that a small fraction of the gas in the disk does not couplestrongly to the stellar magnetic field at 3-4 stellar radii but instead driftsslowly inward in nearly circular orbits until it is within a few kilometers ofthe neutron star surface. the lense-thirring precession model is consistentwith the observed magnitudes of the hbo frequencies only if the moments ofinertia of the neutron stars in the z sources are 4-5 times larger than thelargest values predicted by realistic neutron-star equations of state. thetrend of the correlation between the hbo and upper khz qpo frequencies is notconsistent with this model. we argue that the change in the slope of thecorrelation between the frequency of the horizontal branch oscillation and thefrequency of the upper kilohertz qpo, when the latter is greater than 850 hz,is directly related to the varying frequency separation of the kilohertz qpos.

(1999) in 4u 1323-62. although the exactmechanism is not clear, it is most likely related to the high inclination ofboth systems. an orbiting structure in the accretion disc that modulates theradiation from the central source seems the most promising mechanism.
