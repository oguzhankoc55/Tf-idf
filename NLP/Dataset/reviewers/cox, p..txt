0812.3956	a sensitive search for [nii] emission in a z=6.4 quasar host galaxy	we present a sensitive search for the ^3p_1-&gt;^3p_0 ground state finestructure line at 205 microns of ionized nitrogen ([nii]) in one of the highestredshift quasars (j1148+5251 at z=6.42) using the iram 30m telescope. the lineis not detected at a (3 sigma) depth of 0.47 jy km s^-1, corresponding to a[nii] luminosity limit of l_[nii] &lt; 4.0x10^8 l_sun and a l_[nii]/l$_fir ratioof &lt;2x10^-5. in parallel, we have observed the co(j=6-5) line in j1148+5251,which is detected at a flux level consistent with earlier interferometricobservations. using our earlier measurements of the [cii] 158 micron linestrength, we derive an upper limit for the [nii]/[cii] line luminosity ratio of~1/10 in j1148+5251. our upper limit for the [cii]/[nii] ratio is similar tothe value found for our galaxy and m82 (the only extragalactic system where the[nii] line has been detected to date). given the non-detection of the [nii]line we can only speculate whether or not high-z detections are within reach ofcurrently operating observatories. however, [nii] and other fine strucure lineswill play a critical role in characterizing the interstellar medium at thehighest redshifts (z&gt;7) using the atacama large millimeter/submillimeter array(alma), for which the highly excited rotational transitions of co will beshifted outside the accessible (sub-)millimeter bands.

0902.0662	a kiloparsec-scale hyper-starburst in a quasar host less than 1 gigayear  after the big bang	the host galaxy of the quasar sdss j114816.64+525150.3 (at redshift z=6.42,when the universe was &lt;1 billion years old) has an infrared luminosity of2.2x10^13 l_sun, presumably significantly powered by a massive burst of starformation. in local examples of extremely luminous galaxies such as arp220, theburst of star formation is concentrated in the relatively small central regionof &lt;100pc radius. it is unknown on which scales stars are forming in activegalaxies in the early universe, which are likely undergoing their initial burstof star formation. we do know that at some early point structures comparable tothe spheroidal bulge of the milky way must have formed. here we report aspatially resolved image of [cii] emission of the host galaxy ofj114816.64+525150.3 that demonstrates that its star forming gas is distributedover a radius of ~750pc around the centre. the surface density of the starformation rate averaged over this region is ~1000 m_sun/yr/kpc^2. this surfacedensity is comparable to the peak in arp220, though ~2 orders of magnitudeslarger in area. this vigorous star forming event will likely give rise to amassive spheroidal component in this system.

0910.2821	the laboca survey of the extended chandra deep field south	we present a sensitive 870 micron survey of the extended chandra deep fieldsouth (ecdfs) using laboca on the apex telescope. the laboca ecdfssubmillimetre survey (less) covers the full 30' x 30' field size of the ecdfsand has a uniform noise level of 1.2 mjy/beam. less is thus the largestcontiguous deep submillimetre survey undertaken to date. the noise propertiesof our map show clear evidence that we are beginning to be affected byconfusion noise. we present a catalog of 126 smgs detected with a significancelevel above 3.7 sigma. the ecdfs exhibits a deficit of bright smgs relative topreviously studied blank fields but not of normal star-forming galaxies thatdominate the extragalactic background light (ebl). this is in line with theunderdensities observed for optically defined high redshift source populationsin the ecdfs (bzks, drgs,optically bright agn and massive k-band selectedgalaxies). the differential source counts in the full field are well describedby a power law with a slope of alpha=-3.2, comparable to the results from otherfields. we show that the shape of the source counts is not uniform across thefield. the integrated 870 micron flux densities of our source-count modelsaccount for &gt;65% of the estimated ebl from cobe measurements. we haveinvestigated the clustering of smgs in the ecdfs by means of a two-pointcorrelation function and find evidence for strong clustering on angular scales&lt;1'. assuming a power law dependence for the correlation function and a typicalredshift distribution for the smgs we derive a spatial correlation length ofr_0=13+/-6 h^-1 mpc.

0910.5756	molecular gas in submillimetre-faint, star-forming ultraluminous  galaxies at z&gt;1	[abridged] we present interferometric co observations of twelve z~2submillimetre-faint, star-forming radio galaxies (sfrgs) which are thought tobe ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) possibly dominated by warmer dust(t_dust ~&gt; 40 k) than submillimetre galaxies (smgs) of similar luminosities.four other co-observed sfrgs are included from the literature, and allobservations are taken at the plateau de bure interferometer (pdbi) in thecompact configuration. ten of the sixteen sfrgs observed in co (63%) aredetected at &gt;4sigma with a mean inferred molecular gas mass of ~2*10^10 m_sun.sfrgs trend slightly above the local ulirg l_fir-l'_co relation. since sfrgsare about two times fainter in radio luminosity but exhibit similar columinosities to smgs, this suggests sfrgs are slightly more efficient starformers than smgs at the same redshifts. sfrgs also have a narrow mean co linewidth, 320+-80km/s. sfrgs bridge the gap between properties of very luminous&gt;5*10^12 l_sun smgs and those of local ulirgs and are consistent withintermediate stage major mergers. we suspect that more moderate-luminositysmgs, not yet surveyed in co, would show similar molecular gas properties tosfrgs. the agn fraction of sfrgs is consistent with smgs and is estimated to be0.3+-0.1, suggesting that sfrgs are observed near the peak phase of starformation activity and not in a later, post-smg enhanced agn phase. this cosurvey of sfrgs serves as a pilot project for the much more extensive survey ofherschel and scuba-2 selected sources which only partially overlap with smgs.better constraints on co properties of a diverse high-z ulirg population areneeded from alma to determine the evolutionary origin of extreme starbursts,and what role ulirgs serve in catalyzing the formation of massive stellarsystems in the early universe.

0912.1598	high-resolution co and radio imaging of z~2 ulirgs: extended co  structures, and implications for the universal star formation law	we present high spatial resolution (0.4", ~3.5 kpc) pdbi interferometric dataon three ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) at z~2: two submillimetregalaxies and one submillimetre faint star forming radio galaxy. the threegalaxies have been ro- bustly detected in co rotational transitions, either12co(j=4-3) or 12co(j=3-2), allowing their sizes and gas masses to beaccurately constrained. these are the highest spatial resolution observationsobserved to date (by a factor of ~2) for intermediate-excitation co emission inz~2 ulirgs. the galaxies appear extended over several resolution elements,having a mean radius of 3.7 kpc. high-resolution (0.3") combined merlin-vlaobservations of their radio continua allow an analysis of the star formationbehaviour of these galaxies, on comparable spatial scales to that of the coobservations. this 'matched beam' approach sheds light on the spatialdistribution of both molecular gas and star formation, and we can thereforecalculate accurate star formation rates and gas surface densities: this allowsus to place the three systems in the context of a kennicutt-schmidt (ks)-stylestar formation law. we find a difference in size between the co and radioemission regions, and as such we suggest that using the spatial extent of theco emission region to estimate the surface density of star formation may leadto error. this size difference also causes the star formation efficiencieswithin systems to vary by up to a factor of 5. we also find, with our newaccurate sizes, that smgs lie significantly above the ks relation, indicatingthat stars are formed more efficiently in these extreme systems than in otherhigh-z star forming galaxies.

0707.3335	molecular gas in qso host galaxies at z&gt;5	we present observations with the iram plateau de bure interferometer of threeqsos at z&gt;5 aimed at detecting molecular gas in their host galaxies as tracedby co transitions. co (5-4) is detected in sdssj033829.31+002156.3 at z=5.0267,placing it amongst the most distant sources detected in co. the co emission isunresolved with a beam size of ~1", implying that the molecular gas iscontained within a compact region, less than ~3kpc in radius. we infer an upperlimit on the dynamical mass of the co emitting region of ~3x10^10msun/sin(i)^2. the comparison with the black hole mass inferred from near-irdata suggests that the bh-to-bulge mass ratio in this galaxy is significantlyhigher than in local galaxies. from the co luminosity we infer a mass reservoirof molecular gas as high as m(h2)=2.4x10^10 msun, implying that the moleculargas accounts for a significant fraction of the dynamical mass. when compared tothe star formation rate derived from the far-ir luminosity, we infer a veryshort gas exhaustion timescale (~10^7 yrs), comparable to the dynamicaltimescale. co is not detected in the other two qsos (sdssj083643.85+005453.3and sdssj163033.90+401209.6) and upper limits are given for their molecular gascontent. when combined with co observations of other type 1 agns, spanning awide redshift range (0&lt;z&lt;6.4), we find that the host galaxy co luminosity(hence molecular gas content) and the agn optical luminosity (hence bhaccretion rate) are correlated, but the relation is not linear: l(co) ~[lambda*l_lambda(4400a)]^0.72. moreover, at high redshifts (and especially atz&gt;5) the co luminosity appears to saturate. we discuss the implications ofthese findings in terms of black hole-galaxy co-evolution.

1002.2149	high molecular gas fractions in normal massive star forming galaxies in  the young universe	stars form from cold molecular interstellar gas. since this is relativelyrare in the local universe, galaxies like the milky way form only a few newstars per year. typical massive galaxies in the distant universe formed starsan order of magnitude more rapidly. unless star formation was significantlymore efficient, this difference suggests that young galaxies were much more gasrich. molecular gas observations in the distant universe have so far beenlargely restricted to very luminous, rare objects, including mergers andquasars. here we report the results of a systematic survey of molecular gas insamples of typical massive star forming galaxies at &lt;z&gt;~1.2 and 2.3, when theuniverse was 40% and 24% of its current age. our measurements provide empiricalevidence that distant star forming galaxies indeed were gas rich, and that thestar formation efficiency is not strongly dependent on cosmic epoch. theaverage fraction of cold gas relative to total galaxy baryonic mass at z= 2.3and z=1.2 is ~44% and 34%, three to ten times higher than in today's massivespiral galaxies. the slow decrease between z~2 and 1 probably requires amechanism of semi-continuous replenishment of fresh gas to the young galaxies.

1003.0016	ionization near-zones associated with quasars at z ~ 6	we analyze the size evolution of hii regions around 27 quasars between z=5.7to 6.4 ('quasar near-zones' or nz). we include more sources than previousstudies, and we use more accurate redshifts for the host galaxies, with 8 comolecular line redshifts and 9 mgii redshifts. we confirm the trend for anincrease in nz size with decreasing redshift, with the luminosity normalizedproper size evolving as: r_{nz,corrected} = (7.4 \pm 0.3) - (8.0 \pm 1.1)\times (z-6) mpc. while derivation of the absolute neutral fraction remainsdifficult with this technique, the evolution of the nz sizes suggests adecrease in the neutral fraction of intergalactic hydrogen by a factor ~ 9.4from z=6.4 to 5.7, in its simplest interpretation. alternatively, recentnumerical simulations suggest that this rapid increase in near-zone size fromz=6.4 to 5.7 is due to the rapid increase in the background photo-ionizationrate at the end of the percolation or overlap phase, when the average mean freepath of ionizing photons increases dramatically. in either case, the resultsare consistent with the idea that z ~ 6 to 7 corresponds to the tail end ofcosmic reionization. the scatter in the normalized nz sizes is larger thanexpected simply from measurement errors, and likely reflects intrinsicdifferences in the quasars or their environments. we find that the near-zonesizes increase with quasar uv luminosity, as expected for photo-ionizationdominated by quasar radiation.

1003.5180	a study of the gas-star formation relation over cosmic time	we use the first systematic data sets of co molecular line emission in z~1-3normal star forming galaxies for a comparison of the dependence ofgalaxy-averaged star formation rates on molecular gas masses at low and highredshifts, and in different galactic environments. although the current high-zsamples are still small and biased toward the luminous and massive tail of theactively star-forming 'main-sequence', a fairly clear picture is emerging.independent of whether galaxy integrated quantities or surface densities areconsidered, low- and high-z sfg galaxy populations appear to follow similarmolecular gas-star formation relations with slopes 1.1 to 1.2. thegas-depletion time scale in these sfgs grows from 0.5 gyrs at z~2 to 1.5 gyrsat z~0. because star formation depletion times are significantly smaller thanthe hubble time at all redshifts sampled, star formation rates and gasfractions are set by the balance between gas accretion from the halo andstellar feedback. in contrast, very luminous gas rich major mergers at bothlow-z and high-z produce on average 4 to10 times more far-infrared luminosityper unit gas mass. only some fraction of this difference can be explained byuncertainties in gas-mass or luminosity estimators; much of it must beintrinsic. the most likely interpretation is that the star formation relationis driven by global dynamical effects. for a given mass, the more compactmerger systems produce stars more rapidly because their gas clouds are morecompressed with shorter dynamical times, so that they churn more quicklythrough the available gas reservoir than the typical normal disk galaxies. whenthe dependence on galactic dynamical time scale is explicitly included, diskgalaxies and mergers appear to follow similar gas to star-formation relations.the mergers may be forming stars at slightly higher efficiencies than thedisks.

1005.3118	herschel observations of embedded protostellar clusters in the rosette  molecular cloud	the herschel ob young stellar objects survey (hobys) has observed the rosettemolecular cloud, providing an unprecedented view of its star formationactivity. these new far-infrared data reveal a population of compact youngstellar objects whose physical properties we aim to characterise. we compiled asample of protostars and their spectral energy distributions that covers thenear-infrared to submillimetre wavelength range. these were used to constrainkey properties in the protostellar evolution, bolometric luminosity, andenvelope mass and to build an evolutionary diagram. several clusters aredistinguished including the cloud centre, the embedded clusters in the vicinityof luminous infrared sources, and the interaction region. the analysedprotostellar population in rosette ranges from 0.1 to about 15 msun withluminosities between 1 and 150 lsun, which extends the evolutionary diagramfrom low-mass protostars into the high-mass regime. some sources lackcounterparts at near- to mid-infrared wavelengths, indicating extreme youth.the central cluster and the phelps &amp; lada 7 cluster appear less evolved thanthe remainder of the analysed protostellar population. for the central cluster,we find indications that about 25% of the protostars classified as class i fromnear- to mid-infrared data are actually candidate class 0 objects. as ashowcase for protostellar evolution, we analysed four protostars of low- tointermediate-mass in a single dense core, and they represent differentevolutionary stages from class 0 to class i. their mid- to far-infraredspectral slopes flatten towards the class i stage, and the 160 to 70um fluxratio is greatest for the presumed class 0 source. this shows that the herschelobservations characterise the earliest stages of protostellar evolution indetail.

1005.3924	the herschel view of star formation in the rosette molecular cloud under  the influence of ngc 2244	the rosette molecular cloud is promoted as the archetype of a triggeredstar-formation site. this is mainly due to its morphology, because the centralob cluster ngc 2244 has blown a circular-shaped cavity into the cloud and theexpanding hii-region now interacts with the cloud. studying the spatialdistribution of the different evolutionary states of all star-forming sites inrosette and investigating possible gradients of the dust temperature will helpto test the 'triggered star-formation' scenario in rosette. we use continuumdata obtained with the pacs (70 and 160 micron) and spire instruments (250,350, 500 micron) of the herschel telescope during the science demonstrationphase of hobys. three-color images of rosette impressively show how themolecular gas is heated by the radiative impact of the ngc 2244 cluster. aclear negative temperature gradient and a positive density gradient (runningfrom the hii-region/molecular cloud interface into the cloud) are detected.studying the spatial distribution of the most massive dense cores (size scale0.05 to 0.3 pc), we find an age-sequence (from more evolved to younger) withincreasing distance to the cluster ngc 2244. no clear gradient is found for theclump (size-scale up to 1 pc) distribution. the existence of temperature anddensity gradients and the observed age-sequence imply that star formation inrosette may indeed be influenced by the radiative impact of the central ngc2244 cluster. a more complete overview of the prestellar and protostellarpopulation in rosette is required to obtain a firmer result.

1005.5123	the herschel-spire instrument and its in-flight performance	the spectral and photometric imaging receiver (spire), is the herschel spaceobservatory`s submillimetre camera and spectrometer. it contains a three-bandimaging photometer operating at 250, 350 and 500 microns, and an imagingfourier transform spectrometer (fts) which covers simultaneously its wholeoperating range of 194-671 microns (447-1550 ghz). the spire detectors arearrays of feedhorn-coupled bolometers cooled to 0.3 k. the photometer has afield of view of 4' x 8', observed simultaneously in the three spectral bands.its main operating mode is scan-mapping, whereby the field of view is scannedacross the sky to achieve full spatial sampling and to cover large areas ifdesired. the spectrometer has an approximately circular field of view with adiameter of 2.6'. the spectral resolution can be adjusted between 1.2 and 25ghz by changing the stroke length of the fts scan mirror. its main operatingmode involves a fixed telescope pointing with multiple scans of the fts mirrorto acquire spectral data. for extended source measurements, multiple positionoffsets are implemented by means of an internal beam steering mirror to achievethe desired spatial sampling and by rastering of the telescope pointing to mapareas larger than the field of view. the spire instrument consists of a coldfocal plane unit located inside the herschel cryostat and warm electronicsunits, located on the spacecraft service module, for instrument control anddata handling. science data are transmitted to earth with no on-board datacompression, and processed by automatic pipelines to produce calibrated scienceproducts. the in-flight performance of the instrument matches or exceedspredictions based on pre-launch testing and modelling: the photometersensitivity is comparable to or slightly better than estimated pre-launch, andthe spectrometer sensitivity is also better by a factor of 1.5-2.

1008.3183	the properties of the interstellar medium within a star-forming galaxy  at z=2.3	we present an analysis of the molecular and atomic gas emission in therest-frame far-infrared and sub-millimetre, from the lensed z=2.3sub-millimetre galaxy smm j2135-0102. we obtain very high signal-to-noisedetections of 11 transitions from 3 species and limits on a further 20transitions from 9 species. we use the 12co, [ci] and hcn line strengths toinvestigate the gas mass, kinematic structure and interstellar medium (ism)chemistry, and find strong evidence for a two-phase medium comprising a hot,dense, luminous component and an underlying extended cool, low-excitationmassive component. employing photo-dissociation region models we show that onaverage the molecular gas is exposed to a uv radiation field that is ~1000 xmore intense than the milky way, with star-forming regions having acharacteristic density of n~10^4 /cm^3. these conditions are similar to thosefound in local ulirgs and in the central regions of typical starburst galaxies,even though the star formation rate is far higher in this system. the 12cospectral line energy distribution and line profiles give strong evidence thatthe system comprises multiple kinematic components with different conditions,including temperature, and line ratios suggestive of high cosmic ray fluxwithin clouds. we show that, when integrated over the galaxy, the gas andstar-formation surface densities appear to follow the kennicutt-schmidtrelation, although when compared to high-resolution sub-mm imaging, our datasuggest that this relation breaks down on scales of &lt;100pc. by virtue of thelens amplification, these observations uncover a wealth of information on thestar formation and ism at z~2.3 at a level of detail that has only recentlybecome possible at z&lt;0.1, and show the potential physical properties that willbe studied in unlensed galaxies when alma is in full operation.

1104.4115	redshift determination and co line excitation modeling for the  multiply-lensed galaxy hlsw-01	we report on the redshift measurement and co line excitation of hermesj105751.1+573027 (hlsw-01), a strongly lensed submillimeter galaxy discoveredin herschel/spire observations as part of the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey (hermes). hlsw-01 is an ultra-luminous galaxy with anintrinsic far-infrared luminosity of 1.4x10^(13) solar luminosities, and islensed by a massive group of galaxies into at least four images with a totalmagnification of 10.9+/-0.7. with the 100 ghz instantaneous bandwidth of thez-spec instrument on the caltech submillimeter observatory, we robustlyidentify a redshift of z=2.958+/-0.007 for this source, using the simultaneousdetection of four co emission lines (j = 7-6, j = 8-7, j = 9-8, and j = 10-9).combining the measured line fluxes for these high-j transitions with the j =1-0, j = 3-2 and j = 5-4 line fluxes measured with the green bank telescope,the combined array for research in millimeter astronomy, and the plateau debure interferometer, respectively, we model the physical properties of themolecular gas in this galaxy. we find that the full co spectral line energydistribution is well described by warm, moderate-density gas with tkin = 86-235k and n(h2) = (1.1-3.5)x10^3 cm^(-3). however, it is possible that thehighest-j transitions are tracing a small fraction of very dense gas inmolecular cloud cores, and two-component models that include a warm/densemolecular gas phase with tkin ~ 200 k, n(h2) ~ 10^5 cm^(-3) are also consistentwith these data. higher signal-to-noise measurements of the j(upper) &gt; 7transitions with high spectral resolution, combined with high spatialresolution co maps, are needed to improve our understanding of the gasexcitation, morphology, and dynamics of this interesting high-redshift galaxy.

1104.4116	dynamical structure of the molecular interstellar medium in an extremely  bright, multiply lensed z~3 submillimeter galaxy discovered with herschel	we report the detection of co 5-4, 3-2, and 1-0 emission in the stronglylensed, herschel/spire-selected submillimeter galaxy (smg) hlsw-01 atz=2.9574+/-0.0001, using the plateau de bure interferometer, the combined arrayfor research in millimeter-wave astronomy, and the green bank telescope. theobservations spatially resolve the molecular gas into four lensed images with amaximum separation of ~9", and reveal the internal gas dynamics in this system.we derive lensing-corrected co line luminosities of l'(co 1-0) = (4.17+/-0.41),l'(co 3-2) = (3.96+/-0.20) and l'(co 5-4) = (3.45+/-0.20) x 10^10(mu_l/10.9)^-1 kkm/s pc^2, corresponding to luminosity ratios of r_31 =0.95+/-0.10, r_53 = 0.87+/-0.06, and r_51 = 0.83+/-0.09. this suggests a totalmolecular gas mass of mgas = 3.3 x 10^10 (alpha_co/0.8) (mu_l/10.9)^-1 msun.the gas mass, gas mass fraction, gas depletion timescale, star formationefficiency, and specific star formation rate are typical for an smg. thevelocity structure of the gas reservoir suggests that the brightest two lensedimages are dynamically resolved projections of the same dust-obscured region inthe galaxy that are kinematically offset from the unresolved fainter images.the resolved kinematics appear consistent with the complex velocity structureobserved in major, `wet' (i.e., gas-rich) mergers. major mergers are commonlyobserved in smgs, and are likely to be responsible for fueling their intensestarbursts at high gas consumption rates. this study demonstrates the level ofdetail to which galaxies in the early universe can be studied by utilizing theincrease in effective spatial resolution and sensitivity provided bygravitational lensing.

1104.4119	modeling of the hermes j105751.1+573027 submillimeter source lensed by a  dark matter dominated foreground group of galaxies	we present the results of a gravitational lensing analysis of the bright$\zs=2.957$ sub-millimeter galaxy (smg), hermes j105751.1+573027 found in {\itherschel}/spire science demonstration phase data from the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey (hermes) project. the high resolution imaging available inoptical and near-ir channels, along with co emission obtained with the plateaude bure interferometer, allow us to precisely estimate the intrinsic sourceextension and hence estimate the total lensing magnification to be $\mu=10.9\pm0.7$. we measure the half-light radius $r_{\rm eff}$ of the source in therest-frame near-uv and $v$ bands that characterize the unobscured light comingfrom stars and find $r_{\rm eff,*}= [2.0 \pm 0.1]$ kpc, in good agreement withrecent studies on the submillimeter galaxy population. this lens model is alsoused to estimate the size of the gas distribution ($r_{\rm eff,gas}=[1.1\pm0.5]$) kpc by mapping back in the source plane the co (j=5-4) transitionline emission. the lens modeling yields a relatively large einstein radius$r_{\rm ein}= 4\farcs10 \pm 0\farcs02$, corresponding to a deflector velocitydispersion of [$483\pm 16] \,\kms$. this shows that hermes j105751.1+573027 islensed by a {\it galaxy group-size} dark matter halo at redshift $\zl\sim 0.6$.the projected dark matter contribution largely dominates the mass budget withinthe einstein radius with $f_{\rm dm}(&lt;r_{\rm ein})\sim 80%$. this fractionreduces to $f_{\rm dm}(&lt;r_{\rm eff,g1}\simeq 4.5\kpc)\sim 47%$ within theeffective radius of the main deflecting galaxy of stellar mass $m_{\rm*,g1}=[8.5\pm 1.6] \times 10^{11}\msun$. at this smaller scale the dark matterfraction is consistent with results already found for massive lensingellipticals at $z\sim0.2$ from the slacs survey.

1106.2098	the metallicity dependence of the co {\rightarrow} h_2 conversion factor  in z&gt;1 star forming galaxies	we use the first systematic samples of co millimeter emission in z&gt;1'main-sequence' star forming galaxies (sfgs) to study the metallicitydependence of the conversion factor {\alpha}co, from co line luminosity tomolecular gas mass. the molecular gas depletion rate inferred from the ratio ofthe star formation rate (sfr) to co luminosity, is ~1 gyr-1 for near-solarmetallicity galaxies with stellar masses above m_s~1e11 m_sun. in this regimethe depletion rate does not vary more than a factor of two to three as afunction of molecular gas surface density, or redshift between z~0 and 2. belowm_s the depletion rate increases rapidly with decreasing metallicity. we arguethat this trend is not caused by starburst events, by changes in the physicalparameters of the molecular clouds, or by the impact of the fundamentalmetallicity-sfr-stellar mass relation. a more probable explanation is that theconversion factor is metallicity dependent and that star formation can occur in'co-dark' gas. the trend is also expected theoretically from the effect ofenhanced photodissociation of co by ultraviolet radiation at low metallicity.from the available z~0 and z~1-3 samples we constrain the slope of thelog({\alpha}co) -log (metallicity) relation to range between -1 and -2, fairlyinsensitive to the assumed slope of the gas-star formation rate relation.because of the lower metallicities near the peak of the galaxy formationactivity at z~1-2 compared to z~0, we suggest that molecular gas massesestimated from co luminosities have to be substantially corrected upward forgalaxies below m_s.

1107.4979	observation of h2o in a strongly lensed herschel-atlas source at z=2.3	the herschel survey, h-atlas, with its large areal coverage, has recentlydiscovered a number of bright, strongly lensed high-z submillimeter galaxies.the strong magnification makes it possible to study molecular species otherthan co, which are otherwise difficult to observe in high-z galaxies. among thelensed galaxies already identified by h-atlas, the source j090302.9-014127b(sdp.17b) at z = 2.305 is remarkable due to its excitation conditions and atentative detection of the h2o 202-111 emission line (lupu et al. 2010). wereport observations of this line in sdp.17b using the iram interferometerequipped with its new 277- 371ghz receivers. the h2o line is detected at aredshift of z = 2.3049+/-0.0006, with a flux of 7.8+/-0.5 jy km s-1 and a fwhmof 250+/-60 km s-1. the new flux is 2.4 times weaker than the previoustentative detection, although both remain marginally consistent within1.6-sigma. the intrinsic line luminosity and ratio of h2o(202-111)/co8-7 seemcomparable with those of the nearby starburst/enshrouded-agn mrk 231,suggesting that sdp.17b could also host a luminous agn. the detection of astrong h2o 202-111 line in sdp.17b implies an efficient excitation mechanism ofthe water levels that must occur in very dense and warm interstellar gas.

1202.6490	molecular gas in infrared ultraluminous qso hosts	we report co detections in 17 out of 19 infrared ultraluminous qso (ir qso)hosts observed with the iram 30m telescope. the cold molecular gas reservoir inthese objects is in a range of 0.2--2.1$\times 10^{10}m_\odot$ (adopting aco-to-${\rm h_2}$ conversion factor $\alpha_{\rm co}=0.8 m_\odot {\rm (k kms^{-1} pc^2)^{-1}}$). we find that the molecular gas properties of ir qsos,such as the molecular gas mass, star formation efficiency ($l_{\rmfir}/l^\prime_{\rm co}$) and the co (1-0) line widths, are indistinguishablefrom those of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs). a comparison oflow- and high-redshift co detected qsos reveals a tight correlation betweenl$_{\rm fir}$ and $l^\prime_{\rm co(1-0)}$ for all qsos. this suggests that,similar to ulirgs, the far-infrared emissions of all qsos are mainly from dustheated by star formation rather than by active galactic nuclei (agns),confirming similar findings from mid-infrared spectroscopic observations by{\it spitzer}. a correlation between the agn-associated bolometric luminositiesand the co line luminosities suggests that star formation and agns draw fromthe same reservoir of gas and there is a link between star formation on $\sim$kpc scale and the central black hole accretion process on much smaller scales.

1205.3778	hermes: candidate gravitationally lensed galaxies and lensing statistics  at submillimeter wavelengths	we present a list of 13 candidate gravitationally lensed submillimetergalaxies (smgs) from 95 square degrees of the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey, a surface density of 0.14\pm0.04deg^{-2}. the selectedsources have 500um flux densities (s_500) greater than 100mjy. gravitationallensing is confirmed by follow-up observations in 9 of the 13 systems (70%),and the lensing status of the four remaining sources is undetermined. we alsopresent a supplementary sample of 29 (0.31\pm0.06deg^{-2}) gravitationallylensed smg candidates with s_500=80--100mjy, which are expected to contain ahigher fraction of interlopers than the primary candidates. the number countsof the candidate lensed galaxies are consistent with a simple statistical modelof the lensing rate, which uses a foreground matter distribution, the intrinsicsmg number counts, and an assumed smg redshift distribution. the model predictsthat 32--74% of our s_500&gt;100mjy candidates are strongly gravitationally lensed(mu&gt;2), with the brightest sources being the most robust; this is consistentwith the observational data. our statistical model also predicts that, onaverage, lensed galaxies with s_500=100mjy are magnified by factors of ~9, withapparently brighter galaxies having progressively higher average magnification,due to the shape of the intrinsic number counts. 65% of the sources areexpected to have intrinsic 500micron flux densities less than 30mjy. thus,samples of strongly gravitationally lensed smgs, such as those presented here,probe below the nominal herschel detection limit at 500 micron. they are goodtargets for the detailed study of the physical conditions in distant dusty,star-forming galaxies, due to the lensing magnification, which can lead tospatial resolutions of ~0.01" in the source plane.

1206.2641	the intense starburst hdf850.1 in a galaxy overdensity at z=5.2 in the  hubble deep field	the hubble deep field (hdf) is a region in the sky that provides one of thedeepest multi-wavelength views of the distant universe and has led to thedetection of thousands of galaxies seen throughout cosmic time. an early map ofthe hdf at a wavelength of 850 microns that is sensitive to dust emissionpowered by star formation revealed the brightest source in the field, dubbedhdf850.1. for more than a decade, this source remained elusive and, despitesignificant efforts, no counterpart at shorter wavelengths, and thus noredshift, size or mass, could be identified. here we report, using a millimeterwave molecular line scan, an unambiguous redshift determination for hdf850.1 ofz=5.183. this places hdf850.1 in a galaxy overdensity at z~5.2 in the hdf,corresponding to a cosmic age of only 1.1 gyr after the big bang. this redshiftis significantly higher than earlier estimates and higher than most of the &gt;100sub-millimeter bright galaxies identified to date. the source has a starformation rate of 850 m_sun/yr and is spatially resolved on scales of 5 kpc,with an implied dynamical mass of ~1.3x10^11 m_sun, a significant fraction ofwhich is present in the form of molecular gas. despite our accurate redshiftand position, a counterpart arising from starlight remains elusive.

1207.6722	br1202-0725: an extreme multiple merger at z = 4.7	the radio-quiet quasar br1202-0725 (z=4.695) is a remarkable source with abright northwest (nw) companion detected at submm and radio wavelengths butinvisible in the optical. in the absence of amplification by gravitationallensing, br1202-0725 would be the most luminous binary co and fir source in theuniverse. in this paper, we report observations with the iram plateau de bureinterferometer of br1202-0725 in the redshifted emission of the co(5-4) and(7-6) lines, the [c i](3p2-3p1) line, a high angular resolution (0.3 x 0.8arcsec) 1.3 mm map of the rest-frame, far-ir dust continuum, and a search forthe co(11-10) line. we compare these results with recent alma data in the [cii] line. both the quasar host galaxy and its nw companion are spatiallyresolved in the molecular line emission and the dust continuum. the co profileof the nw companion is very broad with a full width at half maximum of 1000 +/-130 km/s, compared to 360 +/- 40 km/s for the quasar host galaxy to thesoutheast (se). the difference in linewidths and center velocities, and theabsence of any lens candidate or arc-like structure in the field, at anywavelength, show that the obscured nw galaxy and the se quasar host galaxycannot be lensed images of the same object. instead, we find morphological andkinematic evidence for sub-structures in both the nw and se sources. weinterpret these results as strong indications that the br1202-0725 complex is agroup of young, interacting, and highly active starburst galaxies.

1301.0628	towards a resolved kennicutt-schmidt law at high redshift	massive galaxies in the distant universe form stars at much higher rates thantoday. although direct resolution of the star forming regions of these galaxiesis still a challenge, recent molecular gas observations at the iram plateau debure interferometer enable us to study the star formation efficiency onsubgalactic scales around redshift z = 1.2. we present a method for obtainingthe gas and star formation rate (sfr) surface densities of ensembles of clumpscomposing galaxies at this redshift, even though the corresponding scales arenot resolved. this method is based on identifying these structures inposition-velocity diagrams corresponding to slices within the galaxies. we useunique iram observations of the co(3-2) rotational line and deep2 spectra offour massive star forming distant galaxies - egs13003805, egs13004291,egs12007881, and egs13019128 in the aegis terminology - to determine the gasand sfr surface densities of the identifiable ensembles of clumps thatconstitute them. the integrated co line luminosity is assumed to be directlyproportional to the total gas mass, and the sfr is deduced from the [oii] line.we identify the ensembles of clumps with the angular resolution available inboth co and [oii] spectroscopy; i.e., 1-1.5". sfr and gas surface densities areaveraged in areas of this size, which is also the thickness of the deep2 slitsand of the extracted iram slices, and we derive a spatially resolvedkennicutt-schmidt (ks) relation on a scale of ~8 kpc. the data generallyindicates an average depletion time of 1.9 gyr, but with significant variationsfrom point to point within the galaxies.

1301.6618	h2o emission in high-z ultra-luminous infrared galaxies	using iram pdbi we report the detection of h2o in six new lensedultra-luminous starburst galaxies at high redshift, discovered in the herschelh-atlas survey. the sources are detected either in the 2_{02}-1_{11} or2_{11}-2_{02} h_2o emission lines with integrated line fluxes ranging from 1.8to 14 jy.km/s. the corresponding apparent luminosities are mu x l_h2o ~ 3-12 x10^8 lo, where mu is the lensing magnification factor (3 &lt; mu &lt; 12). theseresults confirm that h2o lines are among the strongest molecular lines in suchgalaxies, with intensities almost comparable to those of the high-j co lines,and same profiles and line widths (200-900 km/s) as the latter. with thecurrent sensitivity of pdbi, h2o can therefore easily be detected in high-zlensed galaxies (with f(500um) &gt; 100 mjy) discovered in the herschel surveys.correcting the luminosities for lensing amplification, l_h2o is found to have astrong dependence on the ir luminosity, varying as ~l_ir^{1.2}. this relationwhich needs to be confirmed with better statistics, may indicate a role ofradiative (ir) excitation of the h2o lines, and implies that high-z galaxieswith l_ir &gt;~ 10^13 lo tend to be very strong emitters in h2o, that have noequivalent in the local universe.

1305.4930	the rapid assembly of an elliptical galaxy of 400 billion solar masses  at a redshift of 2.3	stellar archeology shows that massive elliptical galaxies today formedrapidly about ten billion years ago with star formation rates above severalhundreds solar masses per year (m_sun/yr). their progenitors are likely thesub-millimeter-bright galaxies (smgs) at redshifts (z) greater than 2. whilesmgs' mean molecular gas mass of 5x10^10 m_sun can explain the formation oftypical elliptical galaxies, it is inadequate to form ellipticals that alreadyhave stellar masses above 2x10^11 m_sun at z ~ 2. here we reportmulti-wavelength high-resolution observations of a rare merger of two massivesmgs at z = 2.3. the system is currently forming stars at a tremendous rate of2,000 m_sun/yr. with a star formation efficiency an order-of-magnitude greaterthan that of normal galaxies, it will quench the star formation by exhaustingthe gas reservoir in only ~200 million years. at a projected separation of 19kiloparsecs, the two massive starbursts are about to merge and form a passiveelliptical galaxy with a stellar mass of ~4x10^11 m_sun. our observations showthat gas-rich major galaxy mergers, concurrent with intense star formation, canform the most massive elliptical galaxies by z ~ 1.5.

1401.5076	varying [cii]/[nii] line ratios in the interacting system br1202-0725 at  z=4.7	we study the properties of the interstellar medium in the interacting systembr1202-0725 at z=4.7 via its [nii] and [cii] fine-structure line emission. thissystem consists of a qso, a sub-mm galaxy (smg), and two ly-alpha emitters(laes). such a diversity in galaxy properties makes br1202-0725 a uniquelaboratory of star formation and galaxy evolution at high redshift. we presentionized nitrogen ([nii] 205 micron) observations of this system, obtained withthe iram plateau de bure interferometer. we find no [nii] emission at thequasar location, but tentative [nii] line detections associated with the smgand one of the laes. together with available ionized carbon ([cii] 158 micron)alma observations of this system, we find the following: the [cii]/[nii]luminosity ratio is &gt;5.5 for the qso and the smg, but it is as low as ~2 in thelae, suggesting that, in this source, most of the [cii] emission is associatedwith the ionized medium (hii regions) rather than the neutral one (pdrs). thisstudy demonstrates the importance of combined studies of multiplefine--structure lines in order to pin down the physical properties of theinterstellar medium in distant galaxies.

1409.1171	combined co &amp; dust scaling relations of depletion time and molecular gas  fractions with cosmic time, specific star formation rate and stellar mass	we combine molecular gas masses inferred from co emission in 500 star forminggalaxies (sfgs) between z=0 and 3, from the iram-coldgass, phibss1/2 and othersurveys, with gas masses derived from herschel far-ir dust measurements in 512galaxy stacks over the same stellar mass/redshift range. we constrain thescaling relations of molecular gas depletion time scale (tdepl) and gas tostellar mass ratio (mmolgas/m*) of sfgs near the star formation main-sequencewith redshift, specific star formation rate (ssfr) and stellar mass (m*). theco- and dust-based scaling relations agree remarkably well. this suggests thatthe co-h2 mass conversion factor varies little within 0.6dex of the mainsequence (ssfr(ms,z,m*)), and less than 0.3dex throughout this redshift range.this study builds on and strengthens the results of earlier work. we find thattdepl scales as (1+z)^-0.3 *(ssfr/ssfr(ms,z,m*))^-0.5, with little dependenceon m*. the resulting steep redshift dependence of mmolgas/m* ~(1+z)^3 mirrorsthat of the ssfr and probably reflects the gas supply rate. the decreasing gasfractions at high m* are driven by the flattening of the sfr-m* relation.throughout the redshift range probed a larger ssfr at constant m* is due to acombination of an increasing gas fraction and a decreasing depletion timescale. as a result galaxy integrated samples of the mmolgas-sfr rate relationexhibit a super-linear slope, which increases with the range of ssfr. withthese new relations it is now possible to determine mmolgas with an accuracy of0.1dex in relative terms, and 0.2dex including systematic uncertainties.

0705.1721	a detailed study of gas and star formation in a highly magnified lyman  break galaxy at z=3.07	we report the detection of co(3-2) emission from a bright, gravitationallylensed lyman break galaxy, lbgj213512.73-010143 (the 'cosmic eye'), at z=3.07using the plateau de bure interferometer. this is only the second detection ofmolecular gas emission from an lbg and yields an intrinsic molecular gas massof (2.4+/-0.4)x10^9 mo. the lens reconstruction of the uv morphology of the lbgindicates that it comprises two components separated by ~2 kpc. the co emissionis unresolved, and appears to be centered on the intrinsically fainter (andalso less highly magnified) of the two uv components. the width of the co lineindicates a dynamical mass of (8+/-2)x10^9csc(i)^2 mo within the central 2 kpc.employing mid-infrared observations from spitzer we derive a stellar mass of~(6+/-2)x10^9 mo and a star-formation rate of ~60 mo/yr, indicating that themolecular gas will be consumed in ~40 myr. the gas fractions, star-formationefficiencies and line widths suggests that lbgj213512 is a high-redshift,gas-rich analog of a local luminous infrared galaxy. this galaxy has a similargas-to-dynamical mass fraction as observed in the submillimeter-selectedpopulation, although the gas surface density and star-formation efficiency is afactor of 3x less, suggesting less vigorous activity. we discuss theuncertainties in our conclusions arising from adopting a co-to-h2 conversionfactor appropriate for either the milky way or local luminous infraredgalaxies. these observations demonstrate that current facilities, when aided byfortuitous gravitational magnification, can study 'ordinary' galaxies athigh-redshift and so act as pathfinders for alma.

0806.3022	thermal emission from warm dust in the most distant quasars	we report new continuum observations of fourteen z~6 quasars at 250 ghz andfourteen quasars at 1.4 ghz. we summarize all recent millimeter and radioobservations of the sample of the thirty-three quasars known with5.71&lt;=z&lt;=6.43, and present a study of the rest frame far-infrared (fir)properties of this sample. these quasars were observed with the max plankmillimeter bolometer array (mambo) at 250 ghz with mjy sensitivity, and 30% ofthem were detected. we also recover the average 250 ghz flux density of themambo undetected sources at 4 sigma, by stacking the on-source measurements.the derived mean radio-to-uv spectral energy distributions (seds) of the fullsample and the 250 ghz non-detections show no significant difference from thatof lower-redshift optical quasars. obvious fir excesses are seen in theindividual seds of the strong 250 ghz detections, with fir-to-radio emissionratios consistent with that of typical star forming galaxies. most 250ghz-detected sources follow the l_{fir}--l_{bol} relationship derived from asample of local ir luminous quasars (l_{ir}&gt;10^{12}l_{\odot}), while theaverage l_{fir}/l_{bol} ratio of the non-detections is consistent with that ofthe optically-selected pg quasars. the mambo detections also tend to haveweaker ly\alpha emission than the non-detected sources. we discuss possible firdust heating sources, and critically assess the possibility of active starformation in the host galaxies of the z~6 quasars. the average star formationrate of the mambo non-detections is likely to be less than a few hundredm_{\odot} yr^{-1}, but in the strong detections, the host galaxy star formationis probably at a rate of \gtrsim10^{3} m_{\odot} yr^{-1}, which dominates thefir dust heating.

0807.3674	interferometric co observations of submillimeter-faint, radio-selected  starburst galaxies at z~2	high-redshift, dust-obscured galaxies -- selected to be luminous in the radiobut relatively faint at 850um -- appear to represent a different populationfrom the ultra-luminous submillimeter- (submm-) bright population. they may bestar-forming galaxies with hotter dust temperatures or they may have lowerfar-infrared luminosities and larger contributions from obscured activegalactic nuclei (agn). here we present observations of three z~2 examples ofthis population, which we term submm-faint radio galaxies (sfrgs) in co(3-2)using the iram plateau de bure interferometer to study their gas and dynamicalproperties. we estimate the molecular gas mass in each of the three sfrgs(8.3x10^{9} m_odot, &lt;5.6x10^{9} m_odot and 15.4x10^{9} m_odot, respectively)and, in the case of rg163655, a dynamical mass by measurement of the width ofthe co(3-2) line (8x10^{10} csc^2i m_odot). while these gas masses aresubstantial, on average they are 4x lower than submm-selected galaxies (smgs).radio-inferred star formation rates (&lt;sfr_radio&gt;=970 m_odot\yr) suggest muchhigher star-formation efficiencies than are found for smgs, and shorter gasdepletion time scales (~11 myr), much shorter than the time required to formtheir current stellar masses (~160 myr; ~10^{11} m_odot). by contrast, sfrs maybe overestimated by factors of a few, bringing the efficiencies in line withthose typically measured for other ultraluminous star-forming galaxies andsuggesting sfrgs are more like ultraviolet- (uv-)selected star-forming galaxieswith enhanced radio emission. a tentative detection of \rga at 350um suggestshotter dust temperatures -- and thus similar gas-to-dust mass fractions -- asthe smgs. we conclude that sfrgs' radio luminosities are larger than wouldnaturally scale from local ulirgs given their gas masses or gas fractions.

astro-ph;0002024	iso-lws spectroscopy of centaurus a: extended star formation	we present the first full fir spectrum of centaurus a (ngc 5128) from 43 -196.7 um. the data was obtained with the iso long wavelength spectrometer(lws). we conclude that the fir emission in a 70 arcsec beam centred on thenucleus is dominated by star formation rather than agn activity. the flux inthe far-infrared lines is ~ 1 % of the total fir: the [cii] line flux is ~ 0.4% fir and the [oi] line is ~ 0.2 %, with the remainder arising from [oiii],[nii] and [niii] lines. these are typical values for starburst galaxies.  the ratio of the [niii]/[nii] line intensities from the hii regions in thedust lane can be modelled as a ~ 6 million year old starburst. this suggeststhat the galaxy underwent either a recent merger or a merger which triggered aseries of bursts.  we estimate that &lt; 5 % of the observed [cii] arises in the cold neutralmedium (cnm) and that ~ 10 % arises in the warm ionized medium (wim). the maincontributors to the [cii] emission are the pdrs, which are located throughoutthe dust lane and in regions beyond where the bulk of the molecular materiallies. on scales of ~ 1 kpc the average physical properties of the pdrs aremodelled with a gas density, n ~ 1000 cm^-3, an incident far-uv field, g ~ 100times the local galactic field, and a gas temperature of ~ 250 k.

(2001). we detect seven sources at 1.4 ghz with flux densities, s_{1.4} &gt;50 microjy. these centimeter (cm) wavelength observations imply that themillimeter (mm) emission is most likely thermal dust emission. theradio-through-optical spectral energy distributions for these sources arewithin the broad range defined by lower redshift, lower optical luminosityqsos. for two sources the radio continuum luminosities and morphologiesindicate steep spectrum, radio loud emission from a jet-driven radio source.for the remaining 10 sources the 1.4 ghz flux densities, or limits, areconsistent with those expected for active star forming galaxies. if the radioemission is powered by star formation in these systems, then the implied starformation rates are of order 1e3 m_solar/year. we discuss the angular sizes andspatial distributions of the radio emitting regions, and we consider brieflythese results in the context of co-eval black hole and stellar bulge formationin galaxies.

(2003), a comparison of the line flux ratios withpredictions from a large velocity gradient model suggests that the gas islikely of high excitation, at densities ~10^5 cm^-3 and a temperature ~100 k.since in this case the co lines appear to have moderate optical depths, the gasmust be extended over a few kpc. the gas mass detected in j1148+5251 can fuelstar formation at the rate implied by the far-infrared luminosity for less than10 million years, a time comparable to the dynamical time of the region. thegas must therefore be replenished quickly, and metal and dust enrichment mustoccur fast. the strong dust emission and massive, dense gas reservoir at z~6.4provide further evidence that vigorous star formation is co-eval with the rapidgrowth of massive black holes at these early epochs of the universe.

astro-ph;0410229	resolved molecular gas in a quasar host galaxy at redshift z=6.42	we present high-resolution vla observations of the molecular gas in the hostgalaxy of the highest redshift quasar currently known, sdss j1148+5251(z=6.42). our vla data of the co(3-2) emission have a maximum resolution of0.17'' x 0.13'' (~1 kpc), and enable us to resolve the molecular gas emissionboth spatially and in velocity. the molecular gas in j1148+5251 is extended toa radius of 2.5 kpc, and the central region shows 2 peaks, separated by 0.3''(1.7 kpc). these peaks account for about half of the total emission, while theremainder is more extended. each of these unresolved peaks contains a moleculargas mass of ~5 x 10^9 m_sun (similar to the total mass found in nearby ulirgs)and has an intrinsic brightness temperature of ~35 k (averaged over the 1kpc-sized beam), comparable to what is found in nearby starburst centers.assuming that the molecular gas is gravitationally bound, we estimate adynamical mass of ~4.5 x 10^10 m_sun within a radius of 2.5 kpc (~5.5 x 10^10m_sun if corrected for a derived inclination of i~65 deg.). this dynamical massestimate leaves little room for matter other than the detected molecular gas,and in particular the data are inconsistent with a ~10^12 m_sun stellar bulgewhich would be predicted based on the m_bh-sigma_bulge relation. this findingmay indicate that black holes form prior to the assembly of the stellar bulgesand that the dark matter halos are less massive than predicted based on theblack hole/bulge mass relationship.

astro-ph;0503055	an interferometric co survey of luminous submm galaxies	in this paper we present results from an iram plateau de bure millimetre-waveinterferometer (pdbi) survey for co emission towards radio-detectedsubmillimetre galaxies (smgs) with known optical and near-infraredspectroscopic redshifts. five sources in the redshift range z~1-3.5 weredetected, nearly doubling the number of smgs detected in co. we summarise theproperties of all 12 co-detected smgs, as well as 6 sources not detected in coby our survey, and use this sample to explore the bulk physical properties ofthe smg population as a whole. the median co line luminosity of the smgs is&lt;l_co&gt; = (3.8 +- 2.0) x 10^10 k km/s pc^2. using a co-to-h_2 conversion factorappropriate for starburst galaxies, this corresponds to a molecular gas mass&lt;m(h_2)&gt; = (3.0 +- 1.6) x 10^10 msun within a ~2kpc radius, about four timesgreater than the most luminous local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs)but comparable to that of the most extreme high-redshift radio galaxies andqsos. the median co fwhm linewidth is broad, &lt;fwhm&gt; = 780 +- 320 km/s, and thesmgs often have double peaked line profiles, indicative of either a merger or adisk. from their median gas reservoirs (~3 x 10^10 msun) and star-formationrates (&gt;700 msun/yr) we estimate a lower limit on the typical gas-depletiontime scale of &gt;40myr in smgs. this is marginally below the typical age expectedfor the starbursts in smgs, and suggests that negative feedback processes mayplay an important role in prolonging the gas consumption time scale. we find astatistically-significant correlation between the far-infrared and columinosities of the smgs which extends the observed correlation for localulirgs to higher luminosities and higher redshifts.

astro-ph;0506090	a co survey of young planetary nebulae	we report the results of a sensitive survey of young planetary nebulae in theco j=2-1 line that significantly increases the available data on warm, dense,molecular gas in the early phases of planetary nebula formation. theobservations were made using the iram 30 m telescope with the 3 by 3 pixelheterodyne receiver array (hera). the array provides an effective means ofdiscriminating the co emission of planetary nebulae in the galactic plane fromcontaminating emission of interstellar clouds along the line of sight. 110planetary nebulae were observed in the survey and 40 were detected. the resultsincrease the number of young planetary nebulae with known co emission byapproximately a factor of two. the co spectra yield radial velocities for thedetected nebulae, about half of which have uncertain or no velocitymeasurements at optical wavelengths. the co profiles range from parabolic todouble-peaked, tracing the evolution of structure in the molecular gas. theline widths are significantly larger than on the asymptotic giant branch, andmany of the lines show extended wings, which probably result from the effectson the envelopes of high velocity jets.

astro-ph;0508064	first detection of [cii]158um at high redshift: vigorous star formation  in the early universe	we report the detection of the 2p_3/2 -&gt; 2p_1/2 fine-structure line of c+ at157.74 micron in sdssj114816.64+525150.3 (hereafter j1148+5251), the mostdistant known quasar, at z=6.42, using the iram 30-meter telescope. this is thefirst detection of the [cii] line at high redshift, and also the firstdetection in a hyperluminous infrared galaxy (l_fir &gt; 10^13 lsun). the [cii]line is detected at a significance level of 8 sigma and has a luminosity of 4.4x 10^9 lsun. the l_[cii]/l_fir ratio is 2 x 10^-4, about an order of magnitudesmaller than observed in local normal galaxies and similar to the ratioobserved in local ultraluminous infrared galaxies. the [cii] line luminosityindicates that the host galaxy of this quasar is undergoing an intense burst ofstar formation with an estimated rate of ~3000 msun/yr. the detection of c+ insdss j1148+5251 suggests a significant enrichment of metals at z ~ 6 (age ofthe universe ~870 myr), although the data are consistent with a reduced carbonto oxygen ratio as expected from chemical evolutionary models of the earlyphases of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0511319	high-resolution millimeter imaging of submillimeter galaxies	we present sub-arcsecond resolution iram pdbi interferometry of eightsubmillimeter galaxies at redshifts from 2 to 3.4, where we detect continuum at1mm and/or co lines at 3 and 1 mm. the co 3-2/4-3 line profiles in five of thesources are double-peaked, indicative of orbital motion either in a singlerotating disk or of a merger of two galaxies. the millimeter line and continuumemission is compact; we marginally resolve the sources or obtain tight upperlimits to their intrinsic sizes in all cases. the median fwhm diameter forthese sources and the previously resolved sources, smmj023952-0136 andsmmj140104+0252 is less than or equal to 0.5" (4 kpc). the compactness of thesources does not support a scenario where the far-ir/submm emission comes froma cold, very extended dust distribution. these measurements clearly show thatthe submillimeter galaxies we have observed resemble scaled-up and more gasrich versions of the local universe, ultra-luminous galaxy (ulirg) population.their central densities and potential well depths are much greater than inother redshift 2-3 galaxy samples studied so far. they are comparable to thoseof elliptical galaxies or massive bulges. the smg properties fulfill thecriteria of 'maximal' starbursts, in which most of the available initial gasreservoir of 10^10-10^11 solar masses is converted to stars on a few dynamicaltimescales.

astro-ph;0603121	350 micron dust emission from high redshift quasars	we report detections of six high-redshift (1.8 &lt; z &lt; 6.4), opticallyluminous, radio-quiet quasars at 350 micron, using the sharc ii bolometercamera at the caltech submillimeter observatory. our observations double thenumber of high-redshift quasars for which 350 micron photometry is available.by combining the 350 micron measurements with observations at othersubmillimeter/millimeter wavelengths, for each source we have determined thetemperature of the emitting dust (ranging from 40 to 60 k) and the far-infraredluminosity (0.6 to 2.2 x 10(13) lo). the combined mean spectral energydistribution (sed) of all high-redshift quasars with two or more rest framefar-infrared photometric measurements is best fit with a greybody withtemperature of 47 +- 3 k and a dust emissivity power-law spectral index of beta= 1.6 +- 0.1. this warm dust component is a good tracer of the starburstactivity of the quasar host galaxy. the ratio of the far-infrared to radioluminosities of infrared luminous, radio-quiet high-redshift quasars isconsistent with that found for local star-forming galaxies.

astro-ph;0603261	metals and dust in high redshift agns	we summarize some recent results on the metallicity and dust properties ofactive galactic nuclei (agn) at high redshift (1&lt;z&lt;6.4). by using the spectraof more than 5000 qsos from the sdss we find no evidence for any metallicityevolution in the redshift range 2&lt;z&lt;4.5, while there is a significantluminosity-metallicity dependence. these results are confirmed by the spectraof a smaller sample of narrow line agns at high-z (qso2s and radio galaxies).the lack of metallicity evolution is interpreted both as a consequence of thecosmic downsizing and as a selection effect resulting from the joint qso-galaxyevolution. the luminosity-metallicity relation is interpreted as a consequenceof the mass-metallicity relation in the host galaxies of qsos, but arelationship with the accretion rate is also possible. the lack of metallicityevolution is observed even in the spectra of the most distant qsos known (z~6).this result is particularly surprising for elements such as fe, c and si, whichare subject to a delayed enrichment, and requires that the hosts of these qsosformed in short bursts and at very high redshift (z&gt;10). the properties of dustin high-z qsos are discussed within the context of the dust productionmechanisms in the early universe. the dust extinction curve is observed toevolve beyond z&gt;4, and by z~6 it is well described by the properties expectedfor dust produced by sne, suggesting that the latter is the main mechanism ofdust production in the early universe. we also show that the huge dust massesobserved in distant qsos can be accounted for by sn dust within theobservational constraints currently available. finally, we show that qso winds,which have been proposed as an alternative mechanism of dust production, mayalso contribute significantly to the total dust budget at high redshift.

astro-ph;0605077	radio and millimeter observations of z~2 luminous qsos	we present very large array observations at 1.4 and 5 ghz of a sample of 16quasi-stellar objects (qsos) at z = 1.78 to 2.71. half of the chosen quasarsare bright at mm wavelengths (250 or 350 ghz) while the other half were notdetected at mm wavelengths; the former qsos were detected at 1.4 ghz, in mostcases at high significance (s/n &gt; ~7), but only three of the latter sourceswere detected at radio frequencies, and only at lower significance (s/n ~ 3).the data are consistent with a correlation between the mm and radio fluxesindicating a physical connection between the mechanisms responsible for theradio and mm emission. however, this conclusion is based on data which includesmany upper limits, and deeper observations are clearly needed to verify thiscorrelation.  all eight mm detected qsos are detected in the radio continuum, with radioflux densities consistent with the radio-to-fir correlation for low z starforming galaxies. however, four of these have flatter spectral indices than istypical for star forming galaxies (i.e. greater than -0.5) suggesting thatradiation from the central agn dominates the observed radio emission. all thesources detected at 1.4 ghz are spatially unresolved, with the size limitstypically &lt; 1'' = 6 kpc. high star formation rate galaxies at low redshift aretypically nuclear starbursts, with sizes &lt; 1 kpc. hence, the current radio sizelimits are insufficient to constrain the emission model (agn or starburst).

astro-ph;0605656	a new probe of dense gas at high redshift: detection of hco+(5-4) line  emission in apm 08279+5255	we report the detection of hco+(5-4) emission from the broad absorption line(bal) quasar apm08279+5255 at z=3.911 based on observations conducted at theiram plateau de bure interferometer. this represents the first detection ofthis molecular ion at such a high redshift. the inferred line luminosity,uncorrected for lensing, is l'(hco+)=(3.5+-0.6)x10^10 kkms^-1pc^2. the hco+j=5-4 source position coincides within the errors with that reported fromprevious hcn j=5-4 and high-j co line observations of this quasar. the hco+line profile central velocity and width are consistent with those derived fromhcn. this result suggests that hco+(5-4) emission comes roughly from the samecircumnuclear region probed by hcn. however, the hcn(5-4)/hco+(5-4) intensityratio measured in apm08279+5255 is significantly larger than that predicted bysimple radiative transfer models, which assume collisional excitation and equalmolecular abundances. this could imply that the [hcn]/[hco^+] abundance ratiois particularly large in this source, or that the j=5 rotational levels arepredominantly excited by ir fluorescent radiation.

astro-ph;0612345	detection of hnc and tentative detection of cn at z=3.9	molecular line emission from high-redshift galaxies holds great promise forthe study of galaxy formation and evolution. the weak signals can only bedetected with the largest mm-wave telescopes, such as the iram interferometer.we report the detection of the j = 5-4 line of hnc and the tentative detectionof the n= 4-3 line of cn in the quasar apm08279+5255 at z=3.9. these are the4th and 5th molecular species detected at such a high redshift. the derived hncand cn line intensities are 0.6 and 0.4 times that of hcn j= 5-4. if hnc andhcn are co-spatial and if their j= 5-4 lines are collisionally excited, the[hnc]/[hcn] abundance ratio must be equal to 0.6 within a factor of 2, similarto its value in the cold galactic clouds and much larger than in the hotmolecular gas associated with galactic hii regions. it is possible, however,that fluorescent infrared radiation plays an important role in the excitationof hnc and hcn.

0810.1293	mambo 1.2mm observations of luminous starbursts at z~2 in the swire  fields	we report on--off pointed mambo observations at 1.2 mm of 61 spitzer-selectedstar-forming galaxies from the swire survey. the sources are selected on thebasis of bright 24um fluxes (f_24um&gt;0.4mjy) and of stellar dominatednear-infrared spectral energy distributions in order to favor z~2 starburstgalaxies. the average 1.2mm flux for the whole sample is 1.5+/-0.2 mjy. ouranalysis focuses on 29 sources in the lockman hole field where the average1.2mm flux (1.9+/-0.3 mjy) is higher than in other fields (1.1+/-0.2 mjy). theanalysis of the sources multi-wavelength spectral energy distributionsindicates that they are starburst galaxies with far-infrared luminosities~10^12-10^13.3 lsun, and stellar masses of ~0.2-6 x10^11 m_sun. compared tosub-millimeter selected galaxies (smgs), the swire-mambo sources are amongthose with the largest 24um/millimeter flux ratios. the origin of such largeratios is investigated by comparing the average mid-infrared spectra and thestacked far-infrared spectral energy distributions of the swire-mambo sourcesand of smgs. the mid-infrared spectra exhibit strong pah features, and a warmdust continuum. the warm dust continuum contributes to ~34% of the mid-infraredemission, and is likely associated with an agn component. this constribution isconsistent with what is found in smgs. the large 24um/1.2mm flux ratios arethus not due to agn emission, but rather to enhanced pah emission compared tosmgs. the analysis of the stacked far-infrared fluxes yields warmer dusttemperatures than typically observed in smgs. our selection favors warmultra-luminous infrared sources at high-z, a class of objects that is rarelyfound in smg samples. our sample is the largest spitzer-selected sampledetected at millimeter wavelengths currently available.
