0901.2898	the fraction of quiescent massive galaxies in the early universe	aims: the aim of this work is to collect a complete, mass--selected sample ofgalaxies with very low specific star formation rate, for a comparison with theprediction of recent theoretical models. method: we use the 24/k flux ratio,complemented by the sed fitting to the full 0.35-8.0 mum spectral distribution,to select quiescent galaxies from z~0.4 to z~4 in the goods--music sample. ourobservational selection can be translated into thresholds on the specific starformation rate sfr/m_*, that can be used to compare with the theoreticalpredictions. results: we find that, in the framework of the well known globaldecline of the quiescent fraction with redshift, a non-negligible fraction~15-20% of massive galaxies with very low specific star formation rate existsup to z~4, including a tail of "red&amp;dead" galaxies with sfr/m_*&lt;10^{-11}/yr.recent theoretical models vary to a large extent in the prediction of thefraction of galaxies with very low specific star formation rates, and areunable to provide a global match to our data.

0901.4364	spectroscopic observations of lyman-break galaxies at redshift ~ 4, 5  and 6 in the goods-south field	we report on observations of lyman-break galaxies (lbgs) selected from thegreat observatories origins deep survey at mean redshift z~4, 5 and 6, obtainedwith fors2 spectrograph at the eso-vlt.this program has yielded spectroscopicidentifications for 114 galaxies of which 51 are at z~4, 31 at z~5, and 32 atz~6. the adopted selection criteria are effective, identifying galaxies at theexpected redshift with minimal foreground contamination. once selection effectsare properly accounted for, the rest-frame uv spectra of the higher-redshiftlbgs appear to be similar to their counterparts at z~3. as at z~3, lbgs at z~4and z~5 show lya both in emission and in absorption; when in absorption, stronginterstellar lines and red uv spectra are observed, a fact also measured at z~2and 3. at z~6, sensitivity issues bias our sample towards galaxies with lya inemission; nevertheless, these spectra appear to be similar to theirlower-redshift counterparts. as in other studies at similar redshifts, we findclear evidence that brighter lbgs tend to have weaker lya emission lines. atfixed rest-frame uv luminosity, the equivalent width of the lya emission lineis larger at higher redshifts. at all redshifts where the measurements can bereliably made, the redshift of the lya emission line turns out to be largerthan that of the interstellar absorption lines,with a median velocitydifference deltav~400 km/s at z~4 and 5, consistent with results at lowerredshifts. this shows that powerful, large-scale winds are common at highredshift.in general,there is no strong correlation between the morphology ofthe uv light and the spectroscopic properties. however, galaxies with deepinterstellar absorption lines and strong lya absorption appear to be morediffuse than galaxies with lya in emission.(abridged)

0903.0504	the evolution of spiral, s0 and elliptical galaxies in clusters	we quantify the evolution of the spiral, s0 and elliptical fractions ingalaxy clusters as a function of cluster velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) andx-ray luminosity ($l_x$) using a new database of 72 nearby clusters from thewide-field nearby galaxy-cluster survey (wings) combined with literature dataat $z=0.5-1.2$. most wings clusters have $\sigma$ between 500 and 1100 $\rm kms^{-1}$, and $l_x$ between 0.2 and $5 \times 10^{44} \rm erg/s$. the s0fraction in clusters is known to increase with time at the expense of thespiral population. we find that the spiral and s0 fractions have evolved morestrongly in lower $\sigma$, less massive clusters, while we confirm that theproportion of ellipticals has remained unchanged. our results demonstrate thatmorphological evolution since $z=1$ is not confined to massive clusters, but isactually more pronounced in low mass clusters, and therefore must originateeither from secular (intrinsic) evolution and/or from environmental mechanismsthat act preferentially in low-mass environments, or both in low- and high-masssystems. we also find that the evolution of the spiral fraction perfectlymirrors the evolution of the fraction of star-forming galaxies. interestingly,at low-z the spiral fraction anticorrelates with $l_x$. conversely, nocorrelation is observed with $\sigma$. given that both $\sigma$ and $l_x$ aretracers of the cluster mass, these results pose a challenge for currentscenarios of morphological evolution in clusters.

0903.3952	a comprehensive study of large scale structures in the goods-south field  up to z \sim 2.5	the aim of this paper is to identify and study the properties and galacticcontent of groups and clusters in the goods-south field up to z\sim2.5, and toanalyse the physical properties of galaxies as a continuous function ofenvironmental density up to high redshift. we use the deep (z850\sim26),multi-wavelength goods-music catalogue, which has a 15% of spectroscopicredshifts and accurate photometric redshifts for the remaining fraction. onthese data, we apply a (2+1)d algorithm, previously developed by our group,that provides an adaptive estimate of the 3d density field. we support ouranalysis with simulations to evaluate the purity and the completeness of thecluster catalogue produced by our algorithm. we find several high density peaksembedded in larger structures in the redshift range 0.4-2.5. from the analysisof their physical properties (mass profile, m200, \sigmav, lx, u-b vs. bdiagram), we derive that most of them are groups of galaxies, while two arepoor clusters with masses of few times 10^14 mo. for these two clusters wefind, from the chandra 2ms data, an x-ray emission significantly lower thanexpected from their optical properties, suggesting that the two clusters areeither not virialised or gas poor. we also analyse the dependance onenvironment of galaxy colours, luminosities, stellar masses, ages and starformations. we find that galaxies in high density regions are, on average, moreluminous and massive than field galaxies up to z\sim 2. the fraction of redgalaxies increases with luminosity and with density up to z\sim 1.2. at higherz this dependance on density disappears. the variation of galaxy properties asa function of redshift and density suggests that a significant change occurs atz\sim 1.5-2.

0905.0683	star formation and mass assembly in high redshift galaxies	we study the star formation and the mass assembly process of 0.3&lt;=z&lt;2.5galaxies using their ir emission from mips 24um band. we used an updatedversion of the goods-music catalog, extended by the addition of mid-ir fluxes.we compared two different estimators of the star formation rate: the totalinfrared emission derived from 24um, estimated using both synthetic andempirical ir templates, and the multiwavelength fit to the full galaxy sed. forboth estimates, we computed the sfr density and the specific sfr. the two sfrtracers are roughly consistent, given the uncertainties involved. however, theyshow a systematic trend, ir-based estimates exceeding the fit-based ones as thesfr increases. we show that: a) at z&gt;0.3, the sfr is well correlated withstellar mass, and this relationship seems to steepen with redshift (usingir-based sfrs); b) the contribution to the global sfrd by massive galaxiesincreases with redshift up to ~2.5, more rapidly than for galaxies of lowermass, but appears to flatten at higher z; c) despite this increase, the mostimportant contributors to the sfrd at any z are galaxies of about, orimmediately lower than, the characteristic stellar mass; d) at z~2, massivegalaxies are actively star-forming, with a median sfr 300 msun/yr. during thisepoch, they assemble a substantial part of their final stellar mass; e) thessfr shows a clear bimodal distribution. the analysis of the sfrd and the ssfrseems to support the downsizing scenario, according to which high mass galaxieshave formed their stars earlier and faster than their low mass counterparts. acomparison with theoretical models indicates that they follow the globalincrease in the ssfr with redshift and predict the existence of quiescentgalaxies even at z&gt;1.5, but they systematically underpredict the average ssfr.

0907.2392	superdense massive galaxies in wings local clusters	massive quiescent galaxies at z&gt;1 have been found to have small physicalsizes, hence to be superdense. several mechanisms, including minor mergers,have been proposed for increasing galaxy sizes from high- to low-z. we searchfor superdense massive galaxies in the wide-field nearby galaxy-cluster survey(wings) of x-ray selected galaxy clusters at 0.04&lt;z&lt;0.07. we discover asignificant population of superdense massive galaxies with masses and sizescomparable to those observed at high redshift. they approximately represent 22%of all cluster galaxies more massive than 3x10^10msol, are mostly s0 galaxies,have a median effective radius &lt;re&gt; =1.61+/-0.29kpc, a median sersic index &lt;n&gt;= 3.0+/-0.6, and very old stellar populations with a median mass-weighted ageof 12.1+/-1.3gyr. we calculate a number density of 2.9x10^-2mpc^-3 forsuperdense galaxies in local clusters, and a hard lower limit of1.3x10^-5mpc^-3 in the whole comoving volume between z = 0.04 and z = 0.07. wefind a relation between mass, effective radius and luminosity-weighted age inour cluster galaxies, which can mimic the claimed evolution of the radius withredshift, if not properly taken into account. we compare our data withspectroscopic high-z surveys and find that -when stellar masses are considered-there is consistency with the local wings galaxy sizes out to z~2, while adiscrepancy of a factor of 3 exists with the only spectroscopic z&gt;2 study. incontrast, there is strong evidence for a large evolution in radius for the mostmassive galaxies with m*&gt;4x10^11msol compared to similarly massive galaxies inwings, i.e. the bcgs.

0909.2853	evidence for a fast evolution of the uv luminosity function beyond  redshift 6 from a deep hawk-i survey of the goods-s field	we perform a deep search for galaxies in the redshift range 6.5&lt;z&lt;7.5, tomeasure the evolution of the number density of luminous galaxies in thisredshift range and derive useful constraints on the evolution of theirluminosity function. we present here the first results of an eso large program,that exploits the unique combination of area and sensitivity provided in thenear-ir by the camera hawk-i at the vlt. we have obtained two hawk-i pointingson the goods south field for a total of 32 observing hours, covering ~90arcmin2. the images reach y=26.7 mags for the two fields. we have used publicacs images in the z band to select z-dropout galaxies with the colour criteriaz-y&gt;1, y-j&lt;1.5 and y-k&lt;2. the other public data in the ubvrijhk bands are usedto reject possible low redshift interlopers. the output has been compared withextensive monte carlo simulations to quantify the observational effects of ourselection criteria as well as the effects of photometric errors. we detect 7high quality candidates in the magnitude range y=25.5-26.7. this intervalsamples the critical range for m* at z&gt;6 (m_1500 ~- 19.5 to -21.5). afteraccounting for the expected incompleteness, we rule out at a 99% confidencelevel a luminosity function constant from z=6 to z=7, even including theeffects of cosmic variance. for galaxies brighter than m_1500=-19.0 we derive aluminosity density rho_uv=1.5^{+2.0}_{-0.9} 10^25 erg/s/hz/mpc3, implying adecrease by a factor 3.5 from z=6 to z~6.8. on the basis of our findings, wemake predictions for the surface densities expected in future surveys surveys,based on ultra-vista, hst-wfc3 or jwst-nircam, evaluating the bestobservational strategy to maximise their impact.

0707.1783	a photometrically detected forming cluster of galaxies at redshift 1.6  in the goods field	we report the discovery of a localized overdensity at z~1.6 in thegoods-south field, presumably a poor cluster in the process of formation. thethree-dimensional galaxy density has been estimated on the basis of wellcalibrated photometric redshifts from the multiband photometric goods-musiccatalog using the (2+1)d technique. the density peak is embedded in the largerscale overdensity of galaxies known to exist at z=1.61 in the area. theproperties of the member galaxies are compared to those of the surroundingfield and we found that the two populations are significantly differentsupporting the reality of the structure. the reddest galaxies, once evolvedaccording to their best fit models, have colors consistent with the redsequence of lower redshift clusters. the estimated m_200 total mass of thecluster is in the range 1.3 x 10^14 - 5.7x 10^14 msun, depending on the assumedbias factor b. an upper limit for the 2-10 kev x-ray luminosity, based on the1ms chandra observations, is l_x=0.5 x 10^43 erg s^-1, suggesting that thecluster has not yet reached the virial equilibrium.

0912.3007	the unusual niv]-emitter galaxy gds j033218.92-275302.7: star formation  or agn-driven winds from a massive galaxy at z=5.56	aims: we investigate the nature of the source gds j033218.92-275302.7atredshift ~ 5.56. methods: the sed of the source is well sampled by 16 bandsphotometry, from uv-optical, near infrared and mid-infrared (mid-ir).thedetection of signal in the mid-ir spitzer/irac bands 5.8, 8.0 um -- where thenebular emission contribution is less effective -- suggests the presence of abalmer break, signature of an underlying stellar population formed at earlierepochs. the optical spectrum shows a clear lya emission line together withsemi-forbidden niv] 1483.3-1486.5 also in emission. results: from the sedfitting and the lya modelling it turns out that the source seems to have anevolved component with stellar mass of ~5 x10^(10) msolar and age ~ 0.4 gyrs,and a young component with an age of ~ 0.01 gyrs and sfr in the range of 30-200msolar yr^(-1). the limits on the effective radius derived from the acs/z850and vlt/ks bands indicate that this galaxy is denser than the local ones withsimilar mass. a relatively high nebular gas column density is favored from thelya line modelling (nhi&gt;=10^(21) cm^(-2)). a vigorous outflow (~ 450 km/s) hasbeen measured from the optical spectrum,consistent with the lya modelling. fromacs observations it turns out that the region emitting lya photons is spatiallycompact and of the same order of the effective radius estimated at the ~1400arest-frame wavelength, whose emission is dominated by the stellar continuumand/or agn. the gas is blown out from the central region,but given the mass ofthe galaxy it is uncertain whether it will pollute the igm to large distances.we argue that a burst of star formation in a dense gas environment is active(possibly containing hot and massive stars and/or a low luminosity agn),superimposed to an already formed fraction of stellar mass (abridged).

1001.3891	contamination on lyman continuum emission at z &gt;= 3: implication on the  ionising radiation evolution	we investigate the possibility of contamination by lower-redshift interlopersin the measure of the ionising radiation escaping from high redshift galaxies.taking advantage of the new ultra-deep vlt/vimos u-band number counts in thegoods-s field,we calculate the expected probability of contamination by low-zinterlopers as a function of the u-mag and the image spatial resolution (psf).assuming that ground-based observations can not resolve objects lying within a0.5" radius of each other, then each z&gt;=3 galaxy has a 2.1 and 3.2% chance offoreground contamination, adopting surface density u-band number counts down to27.5 and 28.5,respectively. those probabilities increase to 8.5 and 12.6%,assuming 1.0" radius. if applied to the estimates reported in the literature atz~3 for which a lyman continuum has been observed directly,the probability thatat least 1/3 of them are affected by foreground contamination is larger than50%.from a monte-carlo simulation we estimate the median integratedcontribution of foreground sources to the lyman continuum flux (f900). currentestimations from stacked data are &gt;2 sigma of the median integrated pollutionby foreground sources.the spatial cross-correlation between the u-band catalogand a sample of galaxies at z&gt;=3.4 in the goods-s field,produces a number ofu-band detected systems fully consistent with the expected superpositionstatistics. indeed, each of them shows the presence of at least one offsetcontaminant in the acs images. an exemplary case of a foreground contaminationin the hudf at redshift 3.797 by a foreground blue compact source (u=28.63 +/-0.2) is reported; if observed with a seeing larger than 0.5" the pollutingsource would mimic an observed (f1500/f900)_obs ~ 38, erroneously ascribed tothe source at higher redshift.

1002.2068	physical and morphological properties of z~3 lbgs: dependence on lyalpha  line emission	we investigate the physical and morphological properties of lbgs at z ~2.5 to~3.5, to determine if and how they depend on the nature and strength of thelyalpha emission. we selected u-dropout galaxies from the z-detected goodsmusic catalog, by adapting the classical lyman break criteria on the goodsfilter set. we kept only those galaxies with spectroscopic confirmation, mainlyfrom vimos and fors public observations. using the full multi-wavelength14-bands photometry, we determined the physical properties of the galaxies,through a standard spectral energy distribution fitting with the updatedcharlot &amp; bruzual (2009) templates. we also added other relevant observations,i.e. the 24mu m observations from spitzer/mips and the 2 msec chandra x-rayobservations. finally, using non parametric diagnostics (gini, concentration,asymmetry, m_20 and ellipticity), we characterized the rest-frame uv morphologyof the galaxies. we then analyzed how these physical and morphologicalproperties correlate with the presence of the lyalpha line in the opticalspectra. we find that, unlike at higher redshift, the dependence of physicalproperties on the lyalpha line is milder: galaxies without lyalpha in emissiontend to be more massive and dustier than the rest of the sample, but all otherparameters, ages, sfrs, x-ray emission as well as uv morphology do not dependstrongly on the presence of the line emission. a simple scenario where all lbgshave intrinsically high lyalpha emission, but where dust and neutral hydrogencontent (which shape the final appearance of the lyalpha) depend on the mass ofthe galaxies, is able to reproduce the majority of the observed properties atz~3. some modification might be needed to account for the observed evolution ofthese properties with cosmic epoch, which is also discussed.

0708.2796	the spatial clustering of mid-ir selected star forming galaxies at z ~ 1  in the goods fields	we present the first spatial clustering measurements of z~1, 24um-selected,star forming galaxies in the great observatories origins deep survey (goods).the sample under investigation includes 495 objects in goods-south and 811objects in goods-north selected down to flux densities of f_24&gt;20 ujy andz_ab&lt;23.5 mag, for which spectroscopic redshifts are available. the medianredshift, ir luminosity and star formation rate (sfr) of the samples are z~0.8,l_ir~4.4 x 10^10 l_sun, and sfr~7.6 m_sun/yr, respectively. we measure theprojected correlation function w(r_p) on scales of r_p=0.06-10 h^-1 mpc, fromwhich we derive a best fit comoving correlation length of r_0 = 4.0 +- 0.4 h^-1mpc and slope of gamma=1.5 +- 0.1 for the whole f_24&gt;20ujy sample aftercombining the two fields. we find indications of a larger correlation lengthfor objects of higher luminosity, with luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs,l_ir&gt;10^11 l_sun) reaching r_0~5.1 h^-1 mpc. this would imply that galaxieswith larger sfrs are hosted in progressively more massive halos, reachingminimum halo masses of ~3 x 10^12 m_sun for lirgs. we compare our measurementswith the predictions from semi-analytic models based on the millenniumsimulation. the variance in the models is used to estimate the errors in ourgoods clustering measurements, which are dominated by cosmic variance. themeasurements from the two goods fields are found to be consistent within theerrors. on scales of the goods fields, the real sources appear more stronglyclustered than objects in the millennium-simulation based catalogs, if theselection function is applied consistently. this suggests that star formationat z~0.5-1 is being hosted in more massive halos and denser environments thancurrently predicted by galaxy formation models.[truncated]

1009.1140	the great observatories origins deep survey: constraints on the lyman  continuum escape fraction distribution of lyman--break galaxies at 3.4&lt;z&lt;4.5	we use ultra-deep ultraviolet vlt/vimos intermediate-band and vlt/fors1narrow-band imaging in the goods southern field to derive limits on thedistribution of the escape fraction (f_esc) of ionizing radiation for l &gt;~l*(z=3) lyman break galaxies (lbgs) at redshift 3.4--4.5. only one lbg, atredshift z=3.795, is detected in its lyman continuum (lyc; s/n~5.5), thehighest redshift galaxy currently known with a direct detection. itsultraviolet morphology is quite compact (r_eff=0.8, kpc physical). three out ofseven agn are also detected in their lyc, including one at redshift z=3.951 andz850 = 26.1. from stacked data (lbgs) we set an upper limit to the averagef_esc in the range 5%--20%, depending on the how the data are selected (e.g.,by magnitude and/or redshift). we undertake extensive monte carlo simulationsthat take into account intergalactic attenuation, stellar population synthesismodels, dust extinction and photometric noise in order to explore the momentsof the distribution of the escaping radiation. various distributions(exponential, log-normal and gaussian) are explored. we find that the medianf_esc is lower than ~6% with an 84% percentile limit not larger than 20%. ifthis result remains valid for fainter lbgs down to current observationallimits, then the lbg population might be not sufficient to account for theentire photoionization budget at the redshifts considered here, with the exactdetails dependent upon the assumed ionizing background and qso contributionthereto. it is possible that f_esc depends on the uv luminosity of thegalaxies, with fainter galaxies having higher f_esc, and estimates of f_escfrom a sample of faint lbg from the hudf (i775&lt;28.5) are in broad quantitativeagreement with such a scenario.

1011.5500	spectroscopic confirmation of two lyman break galaxies at redshift  beyond 7	we report the spectroscopic confirmation of two lyman break galaxies atredshift &gt; 7. the galaxies were observed as part of an ultra-deep spectroscopiccampaign with fors2 at the eso/vlt for the confirmation of z~7 ``z--banddropout'' candidates selected from our vlt/hawk-i imaging survey. both galaxiesshow a prominent emission line at 9735a and 9858a respectively: the lines havefluxes of ~ 1.6-1.2 x 10^(-17) erg/s/cm2 and exhibit a sharp decline on theblue side and a tail on the red side. the asymmetry is quantitativelycomparable to the observed asymmetry in z ~ 6 ly-alpha lines, where absorptionby neutral hydrogen in the igm truncates the blue side of the emission lineprofile. we carefully evaluate the possibility that the galaxies are instead atlower redshift and we are observing either [oii], [oiii] or h-alpha emission:however from the spectroscopic and the photometric data we conclude that thereare no other plausible identifications, except for ly-alpha at redshift &gt;7,implying that these are two of the most robust redshift determination forgalaxies in the reionization epoch. based on their redshifts and broad--bandphotometry, we derive limits on the star formation rate and on the ultravioletspectral slopes of the two galaxies. we argue that these two galaxies alone areunlikely to have ionized the igm in their surroundings.

1104.5237	a low escape fraction of ionizing photons of l&gt;l* lyman break galaxies  at z=3.3	we present an upper limit for the relative escape fraction (f_{esc}^{rel}) ofionizing radiation at z~3.3 using a sample of 11 lyman break galaxies (lbgs)with deep imaging in the u band obtained with the large binocular camera,mounted on the prime focus of the large binocular telescope. we selected 11lbgs with secure redshift in the range 3.27&lt;z&lt;3.35, from 3 independent fields.we stacked the images of our sources in the r and u band, which correspond toan effective rest-frame wavelength of 1500\aa and 900\aa respectively,obtaining a limit in the u band image of &gt;=30.7(ab)mag at 1 sigma. we derive a1 sigma upper limit of f_{esc}^{rel}~5%, which is one of the lowest valuesfound in the literature so far at z~3.3. assuming that the upper limit for theescape fraction that we derived from our sample holds for all galaxies at thisredshift, the hydrogen ionization rate that we obtain (gamma_{-12}&lt;0.3 s^{-1})is not enough to keep the igm ionized and a substantial contribution to the uvbackground by faint agns is required. since our sample is clearly still limitedin size, larger z~3 lbg samples, at similar or even greater depths arenecessary to confirm these results on a more firm statistical basis.

1107.1376	spectroscopic confirmation of z~7 lbgs: probing the earliest galaxies  and the epoch of reionization	we present the final results from our ultra-deep spectroscopic campaign withfors2 at the eso/vlt for the confirmation of z~7 "z--band dropout" candidatesselected from our vlt/hawk-i imaging survey over three independent fields. inparticular we report on two newly discovered galaxies at redshift ~6.7 in thentt deep field: both galaxies show a ly-alpha emission line with rest-frame ewsof the order 15-20 a and luminosities of 2-4 x 10^{42} erg/s. we also presentthe results of ultra-deep observations of a sample of i-dropout galaxies, fromwhich we set a solid upper limit on the fraction of interlopers. out of the 20z-dropouts observed we confirm 5 galaxies at 6.7 &lt; z &lt; 7.1. this issystematically below the expectations drawn on the basis of lower redshiftobservations: in particular there is a significant lack of objects withintermediate ly-alpha ews (between 20 and 55 a). we conclude that the trend forthe fraction of ly-alpha emission in lbgs that is constantly increasing fromz~3 to z~6 is most probably reversed from z~6 to z~7.  explaining the observed rapid change in the lae fraction among the drop-outpopulation with reionization requires a fast evolution of the neutral fractionof hydrogen in the universe. assuming that the universe is completely ionizedat z=6 and adopting the semi-analytical models of dijkstra et al.

1109.1757	the blue uv slopes of z~4 lyman break galaxies: implications for the  corrected star formation rate density	we plan to analyse dust extinction in lyman break galaxies (lbgs) byintroducing a new and more reliable approach to their selection and to thecharacterization of their distribution of uv slopes beta, using deep ir imagesfrom hst. we exploit deep wfc3 ir observations of the ers and hudf fields overgoods-south, combined with hst-acs optical data, to select z~4 lbgs through anew (b-v) vs. (v-h) colour diagram. the uv slope of the selected galaxies isrobustly determined by a linear fit over their observed i, z, y, j magnitudes,coherently with the original definition of beta. the same fit is used todetermine their rest-frame uv magnitudes m1600 through a simple interpolation.we estimate the effect of observational uncertainties with detailed simulationsthat we also exploit, under a parametric maximum-likelihood approach, toconstrain the probability density function of uv slopes pdf(beta) as a functionof rest-frame magnitude. we find 142 and 25 robust lbgs in the ers and hudffields respectively, limiting our sample to s/n(h)&gt;10 objects. our newlydefined criteria improve the selection of z~4 lbgs and allow us to exclude redinterlopers at lower redshift, especially z~3-3.5 objects. we find that z~4lbgs are characterized by blue uv slopes, suggesting a low dust extinction: alll&lt;l* galaxies have an average uv slope &lt;beta&gt;\simeq-2.1, while brighter objectsonly are slightly redder (&lt;beta&gt; -1.9). we find an intrinsic dispersion ~ 0.3for pdf(beta) at all magnitudes. the sfrd at z~4 corrected according to theseestimates turns out to be lower than previously found: log(sfrd)\simeq-1.09m_sun/yr/mpc^3. finally, we discuss how the uv slope of z~4 galaxies changes asa function of the dust-corrected uv magnitude (i.e. sfr) showing that mostgalaxies with a high sfr (&gt; 80 m_sun/yr) are highly extincted objects.[abridged]

1109.2026	morphology of galaxies in the wings clusters	we present the morphological catalog of galaxies in nearby clusters of thewings survey (fasano et al. 2006). the catalog contains a total number of 39923galaxies, for which we provide the automatic estimates of the morphologicaltype applying the purposely devised tool morphot to the v-band wings imaging.for ~3000 galaxies we also provide visual estimates of the morphological types.a substantial part of the paper is devoted to the description of the morphottool, whose application is limited, at least for the moment, to the wingsimaging only. the approach of the tool to the automation of morphologicalclassification is a non parametric and fully empiri- cal one. in particular,morphot exploits 21 morphological diagnostics, directly and easily computablefrom the galaxy image, to provide two independent classifications: one based ona maximum likelihood (ml), semi-analytical technique, the other one on a neuralnetwork (nn) machine. a suitably selected sample of ~1000 visually clas- sifiedwings galaxies is used to calibrate the diagnostics for the ml estimator and asa training set in the nn machine. the final morphological estimator combinesthe two techniques and proves to be effective both when applied to anadditional test sample of ~1000 visually classified wings galaxies and whencompared with small samples of sdss galaxies visually classified by fukugita etal. (2007) and nair et al. (2010). finally, besides the galaxy morphologydistribution (corrected for field contamination) in the wings clusters, wepresent the ellipticity ({\epsilon}), color (b-v) and sersic index (n)distributions for different morphological types, as well as the morphologicalfractions as a function of the clustercentric distance (in units of r200).

0710.3704	the red and blue galaxy populations in the goods field: evidence for an  excess of red dwarfs	we study the evolution of the galaxy population up to z\sim3 as a function ofits colour properties. in particular, luminosity functions and luminositydensities have been derived as a function of redshift for the blue/late andred/early populations. we use data from the goods-music catalogue which havetypical magnitude limits z&lt;26 and ks&lt;23.5 for most of the sample. about 8% ofthe galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts; the remaining have well calibratedphotometric redshifts derived from the extremely wide multi-wavelength coveragein 14 bands (from the u band to the spitzer 8 \mu m band). we have derived acatalogue of galaxies complete in rest-frame b-band, which has been divided intwo subsamples according to their rest-frame u-v colour (or derived specificstar formation rate, ssfr) properties. we confirm a bimodality in the u-vcolour and ssfr of the galaxy sample up to z\sim 3. this bimodality is used tocompute the lfs of the blue/late and red/early subsamples. the lfs of theblue/late and total samples are well represented by steep schechter functionsevolving in luminosity with increasing redshifts. the volume density of the lfsof the red/early populations decreases with increasing redshift. the shape ofthe red/early lfs shows an excess of faint red dwarfs with respect to theextrapolation of a flat schechter function and can be represented by the sum oftwo schechter functions. our model for galaxy formation in the hierarchicalclustering scenario, which also includes external feedback due to a diffuse uvbackground, shows a general broad agreement with the lfs of both populations,the larger discrepancies being present at the faint end for the red population.hints on the nature of the red dwarf population are given on the basis of theirstellar mass and spatial distributions.

1207.2727	the ages, masses and star-formation rates of spectroscopically confirmed  z~6 galaxies in candels	we report the results of a study exploring the stellar populations of 13luminous (l&gt;l*), spectroscopically confirmed, galaxies in the redshift interval5.5&lt;z&lt;6.5, all with wfc3/ir and irac imaging from the hst/candels andspitzer/seds surveys. based on fitting the observed photometry with sedtemplates covering a wide range of different star-formation histories, and aself consistent treatment of lyman-alpha emission, we find that the derivedstellar masses lie within the range 10^9 msun &lt; m*&lt; 10^10 msun and are robustto within a factor of two. in contrast, we confirm previous reports that theages of the stellar populations are poorly constrained. although thebest-fitting models for three objects have ages &gt;= 300 myr, the degeneraciesintroduced by dust extinction mean that only two of these objects actuallyrequire a &gt;300 myr old stellar population to reproduce the observed photometry.moreover, when considering only smoothly-varying star-formation histories, weobserve a clear tension between the data and models such that a galaxy sedtemplate with an old age is often chosen in order to try and fit objects withblue uv-slopes but red uv-to-optical colours. to break this tension we exploresed fitting with two-component models (burst plus on-going star-formation) andallow for nebular emission. on average, the inclusion of nebular emission leadsto lower stellar-mass estimates (median offset 0.18 dex), moderately higherspecific star-formation rates, and allows for a wider range of plausiblestellar ages. however, based on our sed modelling, we find no strong evidencefor extremely young ages in our sample (&lt;50 myr). finally, considering all ofthe different star-formation histories explored, we find that the medianbest-fitting ages are of the order 200-300 myr and that the objects with thetightest constraints indicate ages in the range 50-200 myr (abridged).

1208.0506	the size-luminosity relation at z=7 in candels and its implication on  reionization	the exploration of the relation between galaxy sizes and other physicalparameters has provided important clues for understanding galaxy formation. weuse the candels deep+wide surveys in the goods-south, uds and egs fields,complemented by data from the hudf09 program, to address the relation betweensize and luminosity at z\sim7. we select 153 z-band drop-out galaxies in sixdifferent fields characterized by a wide combination of depth and arealcoverage, ideally suited to sample without biases the observed size-magnitudeplane. detailed simulations allow us to derive the completeness as a functionof size and magnitude and to quantify measurements errors/biases. we find thatthe half light radius distribution function of z\sim7 galaxies fainter thanj=26.6 is peaked at &lt;0.1 arcsec (or equivalently 0.5 kpc proper), while atbrighter magnitudes high-z galaxies are typically larger than ~0.15 arcsec. wealso find a well defined size-luminosity relation, rh\siml^1/2. we compute theluminosity function in the hudf and p12hudf fields, finding large spatialvariation on the number density of faint galaxies. adopting the sizedistribution and the size-luminosity relation found for faint galaxies at z=7,we derive a mean slope of -1.7\pm0.1 for the luminosity function of lbgs atthis redshift. using this lf, we find that the amount of ionizing photonscannot keep the universe re-ionized if the igm is clumpy (c_hii&gt;3) and thelyman continuum escape fraction of high-z lbgs is relatively low (f_esc&lt;0.3).with future candels data, we can put severe limits to the role of galaxies inthe reionization of the universe.

1309.1593	clash-vlt: spectroscopic confirmation of a z=6.11 quintuply lensed  galaxy in the frontier fields cluster rxc j2248.7-4431	we present visible multi-object spectrograph (vimos) observations of a z 6galaxy quintuply imaged by the frontier fields galaxy cluster rxc j2248.7-4431(z=0.348). this sub-l^*, high-z galaxy has been recently discovered by monna etal. (2013) using dropout techniques with the 16-band hst photometry acquired aspart of the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash). obtainedas part of the clash-vlt survey, the vimos medium-resolution spectra of thissource show a very faint continuum between ~8700a and ~9300a and a prominentemission line at 8643a, which can be readily identified with lyman-alpha atz=6.110. the emission line exhibits an asymmetric profile, with a morepronounced red wing. the rest-frame equivalent width of the line is ew=79+-10a.after correcting for magnification, the star-formation rate (sfr) estimatedfrom the lya line is sfr(lya)=11 m_{sol}/yr and that estimated from the uv datais sfr(uv)=3 m_{sol}/yr. we estimate that the effective radius of the source isr_e&lt;~0.4 kpc, which implies a star formation surface mass density sigma_{sfr}&gt;6m_{sol}/yr/kpc^2 and, using the kennicutt-schmidt relation, a gas surface massdensity sigma_{gas}&gt;10^3 m_{sol}/pc^2. our results support the idea that thismagnified, distant galaxy is a young and compact object with 0.4 l^* at z=6,with comparable amount of mass in gas and stars. future follow-up observationswith alma will provide valuable insight into the sfr and molecular gas contentof this source. in the spirit of the frontier fields initiative, we alsopublish the redshifts of several multiply imaged sources and other backgroundobjects which will help improving the strong lensing model of this galaxycluster.

1312.1248	alma reveals a warm and compact starburst around a heavily obscured  supermassive black hole at z=4.75	we report alma cycle 0 observations at 1.3mm of less j033229.4-275619(xid403), an ultraluminous infrared galaxy at $z=4.75$ in the chandra deepfield south hosting a compton-thick qso. the source is not resolved in our dataat a resolution of $\sim$0.75 arcsec, placing an upper-limit of 2.5 kpc to thehalf-light radius of the continuum emission from heated-dust. afterdeconvolving for the beam size, however, we found a $\sim3\sigma$ indication ofan intrinsic source size of $0.27\pm0.08$ arcsec (gaussian fwhm), which wouldcorrespond to $r_{half}\sim0.9\pm0.3$ kpc. we build the far-ir sed of xid403 bycombining datapoints from both alma and herschel and fit it with a modifiedblackbody spectrum. for the first time, we measure the dust temperature$t_d=58.5\pm5.3$ k in this system, which is comparable to what has beenobserved in other high-z submillimeter galaxies. the measured star formationrate is sfr=$1020\pm150$ $m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, in agreement with previousestimates at lower s/n. based on the measured sfr and source size, we constrainthe sfr surface density to be $\sigma_{sfr}&gt;26\;m_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$($\sim200\;m_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$ for $r_{half}\sim0.9$ kpc). thecompactness of this starburst is comparable to what has been observed in otherlocal and high-z starburst galaxies. if the gas mass measured from previous[cii] and co(2-1) observations at low resolution is confined within the samedust region, assuming $r_{half}\sim0.9\pm0.3$ kpc, this would produce a columndensity of $n_h\sim0.3-1.1\times10^{24}$cm$^{-2}$ towards the central smbh,similar to the column density of $\approx1.4\times10^{24}$cm$^{-2}$ measuredfrom the x-rays. then, in principle, if both gas and dust were confined onsub-kpc scales, this would be sufficient to produce the observed x-ray columndensity without any need of a pc-scale absorber [abridged].

1312.6299	characterizing faint galaxies in the reionization epoch: lbt confirms  two l&lt;0.2l* sources at z=6.4 behind the clash/frontier fields cluster  macs0717.5+3745	we report the lbt/mods1 spectroscopic confirmation of two images of faintlyman alpha emitters at $z=6.4$ behind the frontier fields galaxy clustermacsj0717.5+3745. a wide range of lens models suggests that the two images arehighly magnified, with a strong lower limit of mu&gt;5. these are the faintest z&gt;6candidates spectroscopically confirmed to date. these may be also multipleimages of the same z=6.4 source as supported by their similar intrinsicproperties, but the lens models are inconclusive regarding this interpretation.to be cautious, we derive the physical properties of each image individually.thanks to the high magnification, the observed near-infrared (restframeultraviolet) part of the spectral energy distributions and ly-alpha lines arewell detected with s/n(m_1500)&gt;~10 and s/n(ly-alpha)~10-15. adopting mu&gt;5, theabsolute magnitudes, m_1500, and ly-alpha fluxes, are fainter than -18.7 and2.8x10^(-18)erg/s/cm2, respectively. we find a very steep ultraviolet spectralslope beta=-3.0+/-0.5 (f_lambda=lambda^(beta)), implying that these are veryyoung, dust-free and low metallicity objects, made of standard stellarpopulations or even extremely metal poor stars (age&lt;~30myr, e(b-v)=0 andmetallicity 0.0-0.2 z/zsolar). the objects are compact (&lt; 1 kpc^(2)), and witha stellar mass m* &lt; 10^(8) m_solar. the very steep beta, the presence of thely-alpha line and the intrinsic fwhm (&lt;300 km/s) of these newborn objects donot exclude a possible leakage of ionizing radiation. we discuss thepossibility that such faint galaxies may resemble those responsible for cosmicreionization.

0802.1532	cosmic dynamics in the era of extremely large telescopes	the redshifts of all cosmologically distant sources are expected toexperience a small, systematic drift as a function of time due to the evolutionof the universe's expansion rate. a measurement of this effect would representa direct and entirely model-independent determination of the expansion historyof the universe over a redshift range that is inaccessible to other methods.here we investigate the impact of the next generation of extremely largetelescopes on the feasibility of detecting and characterising the cosmologicalredshift drift. we consider the lyman alpha forest in the redshift range 2 &lt; z&lt; 5 and other absorption lines in the spectra of high redshift qsos as the mostsuitable targets for a redshift drift experiment. assuming photon-noise limitedobservations and using extensive monte carlo simulations we determine theaccuracy to which the redshift drift can be measured from the ly alpha forestas a function of signal-to-noise and redshift. based on this relation and usingthe brightness and redshift distributions of known qsos we find that a 42-mtelescope is capable of unambiguously detecting the redshift drift over aperiod of ~20 yr using 4000 h of observing time. such an experiment wouldprovide independent evidence for the existence of dark energy without assumingspatial flatness, using any other cosmological constraints or making any otherastrophysical assumption.

1403.0743	constraints on the star-formation rate of z~3 lbgs with measured  metallicity in the candels goods-south field	we analyse 14 lbgs at z~2.8-3.8 constituting the only sample where both aspectroscopic measurement of their metallicity and deep ir observations(candels+hugs survey) are available. fixing the metallicity of populationsynthesis models to the observed values, we determine best-fit physicalparameters under different assumptions about the star-formation history andalso consider the effect of nebular emission. for comparison we determine theuv slope of the objects, and use it to estimate their sfr_uv99 by correctingthe uv luminosity following meurer et al. (1999). a comparison between sfrobtained through sed-fitting (sfr_fit) and the sfr_uv99 shows that the latterare underestimated by a factor 2-10, regardless of the assumed sfh. other sfrindicators (radio, far-ir, x-ray, recombination lines) coherently indicate sfrsa factor of 2-4 larger than sfr_uv99 and in closer agreement with sfr_fit. thisdiscrepancy is due to the solar metallicity implied by the usual beta-a1600conversion factor. we propose a refined relation, appropriate for sub-solarmetallicity lbgs: a1600 = 5.32+1.99beta. this relation reconciles thedust-corrected uv with the sed-fitting and the other sfr indicators. we showthat the fact that z~3 galaxies have sub-solar metallicity implies an upwardrevision by a factor of ~1.5-2 of the global sfrd, depending on the assumptionsabout the age of the stellar populations. we find very young best-fit ages(10-500 myrs) for all our objects. from a careful examination of theuncertainties in the fit and the amplitude of the balmer break we conclude thatthere is little evidence of the presence of old stellar population in at leasthalf of the lbgs in our sample, suggesting that these objects are probablycaught during a huge star-formation burst, rather than being the result of asmooth evolution.

1403.3691	discovery of a rich proto-cluster at z=2.9 and associated diffuse cold  gas in the vimos ultra-deep survey (vuds)	[abridged] we characterise a massive proto-cluster at z=2.895 that we foundin the cosmos field using the spectroscopic sample of the vimos ultra-deepsurvey (vuds). this is one of the rare structures at z~3 not identified aroundagns or radio galaxies, so it is an ideal laboratory to study galaxy formationin dense environments. the structure comprises 12 galaxies with securespectroscopic redshift in an area of 7'x8', in a z bin of dz=0.016. themeasured galaxy number overdensity is delta_g=12+/-2. this overdensity hastotal mass of m~8.1x10^(14)m_sun in a volume of 13x15x17 mpc^3. simulationsindicate that such an overdensity at z~2.9 is a proto-cluster that willcollapse in a cluster of total mass m~2.5x10^(15)m_sun at z=0. we compare theproperties of the galaxies within the overdensity with a control sample at thesame z but outside the overdensity. we did not find any statisticallysignificant difference between the properties (stellar mass, sfr, ssfr, nuv-r,r-k) of the galaxies inside and outside the overdensity. the stacked spectrumof galaxies in the overdensity background shows a significant absorptionfeature at the wavelength of lya redshifted at z=2.895 (lambda=4736 a), with arest frame ew = 4+/- 1.4 a. stacking only background galaxies withoutintervening sources at z~2.9 along their line of sight, we find that thisabsorption feature has a rest frame ew of 10.8+/-3.7 a, with a detection s/n of~4. these ew values imply a high column density (n(hi)~3-20x10^(19)cm^(-2)),consistent with a scenario where such absorption is due to intervening cold gasstreams, falling into the halo potential wells of the proto-cluster galaxies.however, we cannot exclude the hypothesis that this absorption is due to thediffuse gas within the overdensity.

1406.3961	the primordial environment of super massive black holes: large scale  galaxy overdensities around $z\sim6$ qsos with lbt	we investigated the presence of galaxy overdensities around four $z\sim6$qsos, namely sdss j1030+0524 (z = 6.28), sdss j1148+5251 (z = 6.41), sdssj1048+4637 (z = 6.20) and sdss j1411+1217 (z = 5.95), through deep $r$-, $i$-and $z$- band imaging obtained with the wide-field ($\sim23'\times25'$) largebinocular camera (lbc) at the large binocular telescope (lbt). we adoptedcolor-color selections within the $i-z$ vs $r-z$ plane to identify samples of$i$-band dropouts at the qso redshift and measure their relative abundance andspatial distribution in the four lbc fields, each covering $\sim8\times8$physical mpc at $z\sim6$. the same selection criteria were then applied to$z$-band selected sources in the $\sim$1 deg$^2$ subaru-xmm newton deep surveyto derive the expected number of dropouts over a blank lbc-sized field($\sim$0.14 deg$^2$). the four observed qso fields host a number of candidateslarger than what is expected in a blank field. by defining as $i$-band dropoutsobjects with $z_{ab}&lt;25$, $i-z&gt;1.4$ and undetected in the $r$-band, we found16, 10, 9, 12 dropouts in sdss j1030+0524, sdss j1148+5251, sdss j1048+4637,and sdss j1411+1217, respectively, whereas only 4.3 such objects are expectedover a 0.14 deg$^2$ blank field. this corresponds to overdensity significancesof 3.3, 1.9, 1.7, 2.5$\sigma$, respectively. by considering the total number ofdropouts in the four lbc fields and comparing it with what is expected in fourblank fields of 0.14 deg$^2$ each, we find that high-z qsos reside in overdenseenvironments at the $3.7\sigma$ level. this is the first direct and unambiguousmeasurement of the large scale structures around $z\sim6$ qsos.

0803.3831	observations and modelling of a clumpy galaxy at z=1.6: spectroscopic  clues to the origin and evolution of chain galaxies	we investigate the properties of a clump-cluster galaxy at redshift 1.57. themorphology of this galaxy is dominated by eight star-forming clumps in opticalobservations, and has photometric properties typical of most clump-cluster andchain galaxies. its complex asymmetrical morphology has led to the suggestionthat this system is a group merger of several initially separateproto-galaxies. we performed h_alpha integral field spectroscopy of this systemusing sinfoni on vlt ut4. these observations reveal a large-scale velocitygradient throughout the system, but with large local kinematic disturbances.using a numerical model of gas-rich disk fragmentation, we find that clumpinteractions and migration can account for the observed disturbed rotation. onthe other hand, the global rotation would not be expected for a multiplymerging system. we further find that this system follows the stellar mass vs.metallicity, star formation rate and size relations expected for a disk at thisredshift, and exhibits a disk-like radial metallicity gradient, so that thescenario of internal disk fragmentation is the most likely one. a red andmetallic central concentration appears to be a bulge in this proto-spiralclumpy galaxy. a chain galaxy at redshift 2.07 in the same field also showsdisk-like rotation. such systems are likely progenitors of the present-daybright spiral galaxies, forming their exponential disks through clump migrationand disruption and fueling their bulges. our present results show thatdisturbed morphologies and kinematics are not necessarily signs of galaxymergers and interactions, and can instead result from the internal evolution ofprimordial disks.

1411.5688	the evolution of clustering length, large-scale bias and host halo mass  at 2&lt;z&lt;5 in the vimos ultra deep survey (vuds)	we investigate the evolution of galaxy clustering for galaxies in theredshift range 2.0&lt;$z$&lt;5.0 using the vimos ultra deep survey (vuds). we presentthe projected (real-space) two-point correlation function $w_p(r_p)$ measuredby using 3022 galaxies with robust spectroscopic redshifts in two independentfields (cosmos and vvds-02h) covering in total 0.8 deg$^2$. we quantify how thescale dependent clustering amplitude $r_0$ changes with redshift making use ofmock samples to evaluate and correct the survey selection function. using apower-law model $\xi(r) = (r/r_0)^{-\gamma}$ we find that the correlationfunction for the general population is best fit by a model with a clusteringlength $r_0$=3.95$^{+0.48}_{-0.54}$ h$^{-1}$mpc and slope$\gamma$=1.8$^{+0.02}_{-0.06}$ at $z$~2.5, $r_0$=4.35$\pm$0.60 h$^{-1}$mpc and$\gamma$=1.6$^{+0.12}_{-0.13}$ at $z$~3.5. we use these clustering parametersto derive the large-scale linear galaxy bias $b_l^{pl}$, between galaxies anddark matter. we find $b_l^{pl}$ = 2.68$\pm$0.22 at redshift $z$~3 (assuming$\sigma_8$ = 0.8), significantly higher than found at intermediate and lowredshifts. we fit an hod model to the data and we obtain that the average halomass at redshift $z$~3 is $m_h$=10$^{11.75\pm0.23}$ h$^{-1}$m$_{\odot}$. fromthis fit we confirm that the large-scale linear galaxy bias is relatively highat $b_l^{hod}$ = 2.82$\pm$0.27. comparing these measurements with similarmeasurements at lower redshifts we infer that the star-forming population ofgalaxies at $z$~3 should evolve into the massive and bright ($m_r$&lt;-21.5)galaxy population which typically occupy haloes of mass $\langle m_h\rangle$ =10$^{13.9}$ h$^{-1}$ $m_{\odot}$ at redshift $z$=0.

1412.0532	the galaxy stellar mass function at 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5 in the candels/uds,  goods-south, and hudf fields	the galaxy stellar mass function (gsmf) at high-z provides key information onstar-formation history and mass assembly in the young universe. we aimed to usethe unique combination of deep optical/nir/mir imaging provided by hst, spitzerand the vlt in the candels-uds, goods-south, and hudf fields to determine thegsmf over the redshift range 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5. we utilised the hst wfc3/ir nir imagingfrom candels and hudf09, reaching h~27-28.5 over a total area of 369 arcmin2,in combination with associated deep hst acs optical data, deep spitzer iracimaging from the seds programme, and deep y and k-band vlt hawk-i images fromthe hugs programme, to select a galaxy sample with high-quality photometricredshifts. these have been calibrated with more than 150 spectroscopicredshifts in the range 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5, resulting in an overall precision ofsigma_z/(1+z)~0.037. we have determined the low-mass end of the high-z gsmfwith unprecedented precision, reaching down to masses as low as m*~10^9 msun atz=4 and ~6x10^9 msun at z=7. we find that the gsmf at 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5 depends onlyslightly on the recipes adopted to measure the stellar masses, namely thephoto-z, the sfhs, the nebular contribution or the presence of agn on theparent sample. the low-mass end of the gsmf is steeper than has been found atlower redshifts, but appears to be unchanged over the redshift range probedhere. our results are very different from previous gsmf estimates based onconverting uv galaxy luminosity functions into mass functions via tight m/lrelations. integrating our evolving gsmf over mass, we find that the growth ofstellar mass density is barely consistent with the time-integral of the sfrdensity over cosmic time at z&gt;4. these results confirm the unique synergy ofthe candels+hudf, hugs, and seds surveys for the discovery and study ofmoderate/low-mass galaxies at high redshifts.

1412.5584	the stellar mass - halo mass relation from galaxy clustering in vuds: a  high star formation efficiency at z~3	the relation between the galaxy stellar mass m_star and the dark matter halomass m_h gives important information on the efficiency in forming stars andassembling stellar mass in galaxies. we present the stellar mass to halo massratio (smhr) measurements at redshifts 2&lt;z&lt;5, obtained from the vimos ultradeep survey. we use halo occupation distribution (hod) modelling of clusteringmeasurements on ~3000 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts to derive the darkmatter halo mass m_h, and sed fitting over a large set of multi-wavelength datato derive the stellar mass m_star and compute the smhr=m_star/m_h. we find thatthe smhr ranges from 1% to 2.5% for galaxies with m_star=1.3x10^9 m_sun tom_star=7.4x10^9 m_sun in dm halos with m_h=1.3x10^{11} m_sun} to m_h=3x10^{11}m_sun. we derive the integrated star formation efficiency (isfe) of thesegalaxies and find that the star formation efficiency is a moderate 6-9% forlower mass galaxies while it is relatively high at 16% for galaxies with themedian stellar mass of the sample ~7x10^9 m_sun. the lower isfe at lower massesmay indicate that some efficient means of suppressing star formation is at work(like sne feedback), while the high isfe for the average galaxy at z~3 isindicating that these galaxies are efficiently building-up their stellar massat a key epoch in the mass assembly process. we further infer that the averagemass galaxy at z~3 will start experiencing star formation quenching within afew hundred millions years.

1502.04708	peering through the holes: the far uv color of star-forming galaxies at  z~3-4 and the escaping fraction of ionizing radiation	we aim to investigate the effect of the escaping ionizing radiation on thecolor selection of high redshift galaxies and identify candidate lymancontinuum (lyc) emitters. the intergalactic medium prescription of inoue etal.(2014) and galaxy synthesis models of bruzual&amp;charlot (2003) have been usedto properly treat the ultraviolet stellar emission, the stochasticity of theintergalactic transmission and mean free path in the ionizing regime. colortracks are computed by turning on/off the escape fraction of ionizingradiation. at variance with recent studies, a careful treatment of igmtransmission leads to no significant effects on the high-redshift broad-bandcolor selection. the decreasing mean free path of ionizing photons withincreasing redshift further diminishes the contribution of the lyc tobroad-band colors. we also demonstrate that prominent lyc sources can beselected under suitable conditions by calculating the probability of a nullescaping ionizing radiation. the method is applied to a sample of galaxiesextracted from the goods-s field. a known lyc source at z=3.795 is successfullyrecovered as a lyc emitter candidate and another convincing candidate atz=3.212 is reported. a detailed analysis of the two sources (including theirvariability and morphology) suggests a possible mixture of stellar andnon-stellar (agn) contribution in the ultraviolet. conclusions: classicalbroad-band color selection of 2.5&lt;z&lt;4.5 galaxies does not prevent the inclusionof lyc emitters in the selected samples. large fesc in relatively brightgalaxies (l&gt;0.1l*) could be favored by the presence of a faint agn not easilydetected at any wavelength. a hybrid stellar and non-stellar (agn) ionizingemission could coexist in these systems and explain the tensions found amongthe uv excess and the stellar population synthesis models reported inliterature.

astro-ph;0109453	measuring the redshift evolution of clustering: the hubble deep field  south	we present an analysis of the evolution of galaxy clustering in the redshiftinterval 0&lt;z&lt;4.5 in the hdf-s. the hst optical data are combined with infraredisaac/vlt observations, and photometric redshifts are used for all the galaxiesbrighter than i_ab&lt;27.5. the clustering signal is obtained in differentredshift bins using two different approaches: a standard one, which uses thebest redshift estimate of each object, and a second one, which takes intoaccount the redshift probability function of each object. this second methodmakes it possible to improve the information in the redshift intervals wherecontamination from objects with insecure redshifts is important. with bothmethods, we find that the clustering strength up to z~3.5 in the hdf-s isconsistent with the previous results in the hdf-n. while at redshift lower thanz~1 the hdf galaxy population is un/anti-biased (b&lt;1) with respect to theunderlying dark matter, at high redshift the bias increases up to b~2-3,depending on the cosmological model. these results support previous claimsthat, at high redshift, galaxies are preferentially located in massive haloes,as predicted by the biased galaxy formation scenario. the impact of cosmicerrors on our analyses has been quantified, showing that errors in theclustering measurements in the hdf surveys are indeed dominated by shot-noisein most regimes. future observations with instruments like the acs on hst willimprove the s/n by at least a factor of two and more detailed analyses of theerrors will be required. in fact, pure shot-noise will give a smallercontribution with respect to other sources of errors, such as finite volumeeffects or non-poissonian discreteness effects.

astro-ph;0603094	the goods-music sample: a multicolour catalog of near-ir selected  galaxies in the goods-south field	we present a high quality multiwavelength (from 0.3 to 8.0 micron) catalog ofthe large and deep area in the goods southern field covered by the deep near-irobservations obtained with the eso vlt. the catalog is entirely based on publicdata: in our analysis, we have included the f435w, f606w, f775w and f850lp acsimages, the jhks vlt data, the spitzer data provided by irac instrument (3.6,4.5, 5.8 and 8.0 micron), and publicly available u-band data from the 2.2esoand vlt-vimos. we describe in detail the procedures adopted to obtain thismultiwavelength catalog. in particular, we developed a specific software forthe accurate "psf-matching" of space and ground-based images of differentresolution and depth (convphot), of which we analyse performances andlimitations. we have included both z-selected, as well as ks-selected objects,yielding a unique, self-consistent catalog. the largest fraction of the sampleis 90% complete at z~26 or ks~23.8 (ab scale). finally, we cross-correlated ourdata with all the spectroscopic catalogs available to date, assigning aspectroscopic redshift to more than 1000 sources. the final catalog is made upof 14847 objects, at least 72 of which are known stars, 68 are agns, and 928galaxies with spectroscopic redshift (668 galaxies with reliable redshiftdetermination). we applied our photometric redshift code to this data set, andthe comparison with the spectroscopic sample shows that the quality of theresulting photometric redshifts is excellent, with an average scatter of only0.06. the full catalog, which we named goods-music (multiwavelength southerninfrared catalog), including the spectroscopic information, is made publiclyavailable, together with the software specifically designed to this end.

astro-ph;0603095	the clustering evolution of distant red galaxies in the goods-music  sample	we use the goods-music sample, a catalog of ~3000 ks-selected galaxies basedon vlt and hst observation of the goods-south field with extendedmulti-wavelength coverage (from 0.3 to 8 micron) and accurate estimates of thephotometric redshifts to select 179 drgs with j-ks&gt;1.3 in an area of 135 sq.arcmin. we first show that the j-ks&gt;1.3 criterion selects a ratherheterogeneous sample of galaxies, going from the targeted high-redshiftluminous evolved systems, to a significant fraction of lower redshift (1&lt;z&lt;2)and less luminous dusty starbursts. these low-redshift drgs are significantlyless clustered than higher-z drgs. with the aid of extreme and simplifiedtheoretical models of clustering evolution we show that it is unlikely that thetwo samples are drawn from the same population observed at two different stagesof evolution. high-z drgs likely represent the progenitors of the more massiveand more luminous galaxies in the local universe and might mark the regionsthat will later evolve into structures of intermediate mass, like groups orsmall galaxy clusters. low-z drgs, on the other hand, will likely evolve intoslightly less massive field galaxies.

astro-ph;0608664	the luminosity function of high-redshift qsos - a combined analysis of  goods and sdss	aims: in this work the luminosity function of qsos is measured in theredshift range 3.5&lt;z&lt;5.2 for the absolute magnitude interval -21&lt;m_{145}&lt;-28.the determination of the faint end of the luminosity function at theseredshifts provides important constraints on models of joint evolution ofgalaxies and agns. methods: we have defined suitable criteria to select faintqsos in the goods fields, checking in detail their effectiveness andcompleteness. spectroscopic follow-up of the resulting qso candidates has beencarried out. the confirmed sample of faint qsos is compared with a brighter onederived from the sdss. we have used a monte-carlo technique to estimate theproperties of the luminosity function, checking various parameterizations forits shape and evolution. results: models based on pure density evolution showbetter agreement with observation than models based on pure luminosityevolution. however a different break magnitude with respect to z~2.1 isrequired at 3.5&lt;z&lt;5.2. models with a steeper faint end score a higherprobability. we do not find any evidence for a flattening of the bright end atredshift z&gt;3.5. conclusions: the estimated space density evolution of qsosindicates a suppression of the formation and/or feeding of supermassive blackholes at these redshifts. the qso contribution to the uv background isinsufficient to ionize the igm at 3.5&lt;z&lt;5.2.

astro-ph;0609068	the galaxy mass function up to z=4 in the goods-music sample: into the  epoch of formation of massive galaxies	the goal of this work is to measure the evolution of the galaxy stellar massfunction and of the resulting stellar mass density up to redshift ~4, in orderto study the assembly of massive galaxies in the high redshift universe. wehave used the goods-music catalog, containing ~3000 ks-selected galaxies withmulti-wavelength coverage extending from the u band to the spitzer 8 micronband, of which 27% have spectroscopic redshifts and the remaining fraction haveaccurate photometric redshifts. on this sample we have applied a standardfitting procedure to measure stellar masses. we compute the galaxy stellar massfunction and the resulting stellar mass density up to redshift ~4, taking intoproper account the biases and incompleteness effects. within the well knowntrend of global decline of the stellar mass density with redshift, we show thatthe decline of the more massive galaxies may be described by an exponentialtimescale of ~6 gyrs up to z~1.5, and proceeds much faster thereafter, with anexponential timescale of ~0.6 gyrs. we also show that there is some evidencefor a differential evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function, with low massgalaxies evolving faster than more massive ones up to z~1-1.5 and that thegalaxy stellar mass function remains remarkably flat (i.e. with a slope closeto the local one) up to z~1-1.3. the observed behaviour of the galaxy stellarmass function is consistent with a scenario where about 50% of present-daymassive galaxies formed at a vigorous rate in the epoch between redshift 4 and1.5, followed by a milder evolution until the present-day epoch.

astro-ph;0612182	lyman break galaxies in the vlt/fors2 spectroscopic campaign in the  goods-s field	we present initial results from our ongoing campaign of spectroscopicidentifications of lyman--break galaxies (lbgs) at z ~ 4, 5 and 6 with fors2 atthe eso vlt. the sample of lbgs is selected from the hst/acs images in thegoods southern field (cdf--s), and here we discuss the spectroscopic propertiesof 103 lbgs that we have cofirmed in the redshift interval 3.5 &lt; z &lt; 6.3, ofwhich 34 at z&gt;5 and 27 between 5.5 and 6.3. as for lbgs at lower redshifts, wefind that lbgs with lya in emission are characterized by weaker intestellarabsorption lines and bluer uv continua than galaxies whose lya is observed inabsorption. no correlation between the lya properties and the apparentelongation of the uv morphology of the galaxies is observed, suggesting thatgeometrical effects are not the cause of the spectral differences. a trend ofincreasing lya equivalent width with decreasing luminosity is also observed. wealso present new measures of the uv luinosity function of lbgs.

astro-ph;0703653	the reversal of the star formation-density relation in the distant  universe	we study the relationship between the local environment of galaxies and theirstar formation rate (sfr) in the great observatories origins deep survey,goods, at z~1, from ultradeep imaging at 24 microns with the mips cameraonboard spitzer. we show that the star formation-density relation observedlocally was reversed at z~1: the average sfr of an individual galaxy increasedwith local galaxy density when the universe was less than half its present age.hierarchical galaxy formation models (simulated lightcones from the millenniummodel) predicted such a reversal to occur only at only at earlier epochs (z&gt;2)and at a lower level. we present a remarkable structure at z~1.016, containingx-ray traced galaxy concentrations, which will eventually merge into avirgo-like cluster. this structure illustrates how the individual sfr ofgalaxies increases with density at the ~1-2 mpc scale. the sfr of z~1 galaxiesis found to correlate with stellar mass suggesting that mass plays a role inthe observed star formation-density trend. however the specific sfr (=sfr/m*)decreases with stellar mass while it increases with galaxy density, whichimplies that the environment does directly affect the star formation activityof galaxies. major mergers do not appear to be the unique or even major causefor this effect since nearly half (46%) of the luminous infrared galaxies(lirgs) at z~1 present the hst-acs morphology of spirals, while only a thirdpresent a clear signature of major mergers. the remaining galaxies are dividedinto compact (9%) and irregular (14%) galaxies. moreover, the specific sfr ofmajor mergers is only marginally stronger than that of spirals. reproducing thesfr-density relation at z ~ 1 is a new challenge for models, requiring acorrect balance between mergers and in-situ star formation at early epochs.
