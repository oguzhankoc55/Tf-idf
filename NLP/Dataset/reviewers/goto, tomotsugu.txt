0903.2922	the mid-infrared view of red sequence galaxies in abell 2218 with akari	we present the {\it akari} infrared camera (irc) imaging observation ofearly-type galaxies in a2218 at z $\simeq$ 0.175. mid-infrared (mir) emissionfrom early-type galaxies traces circumstellar dust emission from agb starsor/and residual star formation. including the unique imaging capability at 11and 15 $\mu$m, our {\it akari} data provide an effective way to investigate mirproperties of early-type galaxies in the cluster environment. among ourflux-limited sample of 22 red sequence early-type galaxies with precisedynamical and line strength measurements ($&lt;$ 18 mag at 3 $\mu m$), we findthat at least 41% have mir-excess emission. the $n3-s11$ versus $n3$ (3 and 11$\mu$m) color-magnitude relation shows the expected blue sequence, but themir-excess galaxies add a red wing to the relation especially at the fainterend. a sed analysis reveals that the dust emission from agb stars is the mostlikely cause for the mir-excess, with low level of star formation being thenext possible explanation. the mir-excess galaxies show a wide spread of$n3-s11$ colors, implying a significant spread (2--11 gyr) in the estimatedmean ages of stellar populations. we study the environmental dependence ofmir-excess early-type galaxies over an area out to a half virial radius($\sim$1 mpc). we find that the mir-excess early-type galaxies arepreferentially located in the outer region. from these evidences, we suggestthat the fainter, mir-excess early-type galaxies have just joined the redsequence, possibly due to the infall and subsequent morphological/spectraltransformation induced by the cluster environment.

0904.1209	the fundamental planes of e+a galaxies and galex uv-excess early-type  galaxies: revealing their intimate connection	strong balmer absorption lines and the lack of ha and [oii] emission linessignify that e+as are post-starburst systems. recent studies suggest that e+asmay undergo the transition from the `blue cloud' to the `red sequence' andeventually migrate to red sequence etgs. an observational validation of thisscenario is to identify the intervening galaxy population between e+as and thered-sequence. motivated by recent findings with galex that a large fraction ofetgs exhibit uv-excess as a sign of rsf, we investigate the possible connectionof the uv-excess galaxies to e+as. in particular, we examine the fp scalingrelations of the largest sample of ~1,000 e+as selected from the sdss and~20,000 morphologically-selected sdss etgs with galex uv data. the fpparameters, combined with stellar population indicators, reveal a certain groupof uv-excess etgs that bridges between e+as and quiescent red galaxies. thenewly identified galaxies are the post-starburst systems characterized byuv-excess but no ha emission. this is a conceptual generalisation of "e+a", inthat the balmer absorption line in the "e+a" definition is replaced withuv-optical colours that are far more sensitive to rsf than the balmer lines. werefer to these uv-excess galaxies as "e+a" galaxies, which stands forelliptical ("e") galaxies with a minority of a-type ("a") young stars. thespecies are either (1) galaxies that experienced starbursts weaker than thoseobserved in e+as (1~10% of e+as, "mild e+as") or (2) the products of passivelyevolved e+as after quenching star formation quite a while ago (~1 gyr, "olde+as"). we suggest that the latter type of e+a galaxies represents the mostrecent arrival to the red sequence in the final phase of the "e+a" to "redearly-type" transition.

0908.4079	a qso host galaxy and its lyalpha emission at z=6.43	we report an optical detection of an extended structure around a qso atz=6.43 (cfhqsj2329-0301, the highest redshift qso currently known) in deep z'and z_r-band images of the subaru/suprime-cam. after a careful psf (qso)subtraction, a structure in the z'-band extends more than 4'' on the sky(r_e=11 kpc), and thus, is well-resolved (16sigma detection). thepsf-subtracted z_r-band structure is in a similar shape to that in the z'-band,but less significant with a 3 sigma detection. in the z'-band, a radial profileof the qso+host shows a clear excess over that of the averaged psf in 0.8-3''radius.  since the z'-band includes a lya emission at z=6.43, the z' flux is perhaps amixture of the host (continuum light) and its lya emission, whereas thez_r-band flux is from the host. through a sed modeling, we estimate 40% of thepsf-subtracted z'-band light is from the host (continuum) and 60% is from lyaemission. the absolute magnitude of the host is m_{1450}=-23.9 (c.f.m_{1450}=-26.4 for the qso). a lower limit of the sfr(lya) is 1.6 msun yr^{-1}with stellar mass ranging 6.2 x 10^8 to 1.1 x 10^10 msun when 100 myrs of ageis assumed. the detection shows that a luminous qso is already harbored by alarge, star-forming galaxy in the early universe only after ~840 myr after thebig bang. the host may be a forming giant galaxy, co-evolving with a supermassive black hole.

1001.0005	environmental dependence of 8um luminosity functions of galaxies at  z~0.8: comparison between rxj1716.4+6708 and the akari nep deep field	we aim to reveal environmental dependence of infrared luminosity functions(ir lfs) of galaxies at z~0.8 using the akari satellite. we construct restframe8um ir lfs in the cluster region rxj1716.4+6708 at z=0.81, and compare themwith a blank field using the akari north ecliptic pole deep field data at thesame redshift. akari's wide field of view (10'x10') is suitable to investigatewide range of galaxy environments. akari's 15um filter is advantageous heresince it directly probes restframe 8um at z~0.8, without relying on a largeextrapolation based on a sed fit, which was the largest uncertainty in previouswork. we have found that cluster ir lfs at restframe 8um have a factor of 2.4smaller l^* and a steeper faint-end slope than that of the field. confirmingthis trend, we also found that faint-end slopes of the cluster lfs becomesflatter and flatter with decreasing local galaxy density. these changes in lfscannot be explained by a simple infall of field galaxy population into acluster. physics that can preferentially suppress ir luminous galaxies in highdensity regions is required to explain the observed results.

1008.0859	luminosity functions of local infrared galaxies with akari: implications  to the cosmic star formation history and agn evolution	infrared (ir) luminosity is fundamental to understanding the cosmic starformation history and agn evolution. the akari ir space telescope performed allsky survey in 6 ir bands (9, 18, 65, 90, 140, and 160um) with 3-10 times bettersensitivity than iras, covering the crucial far-ir wavelengths across the peakof the dust emission. combined with a better spatial resolution, akari can muchmore precisely measure the total infrared luminosity (l_tir) of individualgalaxies, and thus, the total infrared luminosity density in the localuniverse. by fitting ir sed models, we have re-measured l_tir of the irasrevised bright galaxy sample. we present mid-ir monochromatic luminosity tol_tir conversions for spitzer 8,24um, akari 9,18um, iras 12um, wise 12,22um,and iso 15um filters, with scatter ranging 13-44%. the resulting akari irluminosity function (lf) agrees well with that from the iras. we integrate thelf weighted by l_tir to obtain a cosmic ir luminosity density of omega_tir=(8.5^{+1.5}_{-2.3})x 10^7 l mpc^-3, of which 7+-1% is produced by lirgs, andonly 0.4+-0.1% is from ulirgs in the local universe. once ir contributions fromagn and star-forming galaxies (sfg) are separated, sfg ir lf shows a steepdecline at the bright-end. compared with high-redshift results from the akarinep deep survey, these data show a strong evolution of omega_tirsf propto(1+z)^4.0+-0.5, and omega_tiragn propto (1+z)^4.4+-0.4. for omega_tiragn, theulirg contribution exceeds that from lirg already by z~1. a rapid evolution inboth omega_tiragn and omega_tirsfg suggests the correlation between starformation and black hole accretion rate continues up to higher redshifts. wecompare the evolution of omega_tiragn to that of x-ray luminosity density. theomega_tiragn/omega_x-rayagn ratio shows a possible increase at z&gt;1, suggestingan increase of obscured agn at z&gt;1.

0708.3004	the far-infrared surveyor (fis) for akari	the far-infrared surveyor (fis) is one of two focal plane instruments on theakari satellite. fis has four photometric bands at 65, 90, 140, and 160 um, anduses two kinds of array detectors. the fis arrays and optics are designed tosweep the sky with high spatial resolution and redundancy. the actual scanwidth is more than eight arcmin, and the pixel pitch is matches the diffractionlimit of the telescope. derived point spread functions (psfs) from observationsof asteroids are similar to the optical model. significant excesses, however,are clearly seen around tails of the psfs, whose contributions are about 30% ofthe total power. all fis functions are operating well in orbit, and itsperformance meets the laboratory characterizations, except for the two longerwavelength bands, which are not performing as well as characterized.furthermore, the fis has a spectroscopic capability using a fourier transformspectrometer (fts). because the fts takes advantage of the optics and detectorsof the photometer, it can simultaneously make a spectral map. this papersummarizes the in-flight technical and operational performance of the fis.

1011.6408	merging galaxy cluster abell 2255 in mid-infrared	we present the mid-infrared (mir) observation of a nearby galaxy cluster,abell 2255 by the akari space telescope. using the akari's continuouswavelength coverage between 3-24 micron and the wide field of view, weinvestigate the properties of cluster member galaxies to see how the infall ofthe galaxies, the cluster substructures, and the cluster-cluster mergerinfluence their evolution. we show that the excess of mir (11 micron) flux is agood indicator to discriminate galaxies at different evolutionary stages, anddivide galaxies into three classes accordingly : strong mir-excess (n3-s11&gt;0.2)galaxies that include both unobscured and obscured star-forming galaxies, weakmir-excess (-2.0&lt;n3-s11&lt;-1.2) galaxies that are quiescent, old (&gt;5 gyr)galaxies where the mir emission arises mainly from the circumstellar dustaround agb stars, and intermediate mir-excess (-1.2&lt;n3-s11&lt;0.2) galaxies inbetween the two classes that are less than a few gyrs old past the prime starformation activity. with the mir-excess diagnostics, we investigate how localand cluster-scale environments affect the individual galaxies. we derive thetotal star formation rate of ~130 msun/yr for a2255 using the strong mir-excessgalaxies, which is consistent with other clusters of galaxies at similarredshifts and with similar masses. we find no strong evidence that supportsenhanced star formation neither inside the cluster nor in the substructureregion. the intermediate mir-excess galaxies, representing galaxies intransition from star-forming galaxies to quiescent galaxies, are locatedpreferentially at the medium density region or cluster substructures. ourfindings suggest that galaxies are being transformed from star-forming galaxiesinto red, quiescent galaxies from the infall region through near the core,which can be well-explained by the ram-pressure stripping as previoussimulation suggests.

1102.3430	infrared luminosity functions of akari-sdss galaxies	by cross-correlating akari infrared (ir) sources with the sdss galaxies, weidentified 2357 infrared galaxies with a spectroscopic redshift. this is notjust one of the largest samples of local ir galaxies, but akari providescrucial fir bands (9, 18, 65, 90, 140, and 160um) in accurately measuringgalaxy sed across the peak of the dust emission at ~100um. by fitting modern irsed models to the akari photometry, we measured the total infrared luminosity(l_ir) of individual galaxies more accurately. using this l_ir, we constructedluminosity functions of infrared galaxies at a median redshift of z=0.031, with4 times larger sample than previous work. the lf agrees well with that atz=0.0082 (rbgs), showing smooth and continuous evolution toward higher redshiftlfs measured in the akari nep deep field. the derived local cosmic irluminosity density is omega_ir=3.8x10^8 lsunmpc^-3. we separate galaxies intoagn, star-forming, and composite by using the [nii]/ha vs [oiii]/hb lineratios. the fraction of agn shows a continuous increase with increasing l_irfrom 25% to 90% at 9&lt;log l_ir&lt;12.5. the sfr_ha and l_[oiii] show goodcorrelations with l_ir for sfg (star-forming galaxies) and agn, respectively.the self-absorption corrected ha/hb ratio shows a weak increase with l_ir witha substantial scatter. when we separate ir lfs into contributions from agn andsfg, the agn contribution becomes dominant at l_ir&gt;10^11lsun, coinciding thebreak of the both sfg and agn ir lfs. at l_ir&lt;10^11lsun, sfg dominates ir lfs.only 1.1% of omega_ir is produced by lirg, and only 0.03% is by ulirg in thelocal universe. this work also provides the most accurate infrared luminositydensity of the local universe to date. compared with high redshift results fromthe akari nep deep survey, we observed a strong evolution of omega_ir^sfg~(1+z)^4.1+-0.4 and omega_ir^agn ~(1+z)^4.1+-0.5 (abridged).

1106.0757	the current star formation rate of k+a galaxies	we derive the stacked 1.4 ghz flux from first (faint images of the radio skyat twenty centimeters) survey for 811 k+a galaxies selected from the sdss dr7.for these objects we find a mean flux density of $56\pm 9$ $\mu$jy. a similarstack of radio-quiet white dwarfs yields an upper limit of 43 $\mu$jy at a5$\sigma$ significance to the flux in blank regions of the sky. this implies anaverage star formation rate of 1.6 $\pm$ 0.3 m$_{\odot}$ year$^{-1}$ for k+agalaxies. however the majority of the signal comes from $\sim$4% of k+a fieldsthat have aperture fluxes above the $5\sigma$ noise level of the first survey.a stack of the remaining galaxies shows little residual flux consistent with anupper limit on star formation of 1.3 m$_{\odot}$ year$^{-1}$. even for a subsetof 456 `young' (spectral ages $&lt;$ 250 myr) k+a galaxies we find that thestacked 1.4 ghz flux is consistent with no current star formation. our datasuggest that the original starburst has been terminated in the majority of k+agalaxies, but that this may represent part of a duty cycle where a fraction ofthese galaxies may be active at a given moment with dusty starbursts and agnsbeing present.

0801.1108	spatially resolved spectroscopy of passive spiral galaxies	passive spiral galaxies, despite their spiral morphological appearance, donot have any emission lines indicative of ongoing star formation in theiroptical spectra. previous studies have suggested that passive spiral galaxiespreferentially exist in infall regions of galaxy clusters, suggesting that thecluster environment is likely to be responsible for creating these galaxies. bycarrying out spatially resolved long-slit spectroscopy on four nearby passivespiral galaxies with the apache point observatory 3.5-m telescope, weinvestigated the stellar populations of passive spiral galaxies separately fortheir inner and outer regions. in the two unambiguously passive spiral galaxiesamong the four observed galaxies, h$\delta$ absorption lines are more prominentin the outer regions of the galaxies, whereas the 4000-{\aa} breaks(d$_{4000}$) are strongest in the inner regions of the galaxies. a comparisonwith a simple stellar population model for the two passive spiral galaxiesindicates that the outer regions of the galaxies tend to harbour youngerpopulations of stars. the strong h$\delta$ absorption observed in the outerregions of the sample galaxies is consistent with that of galaxies whose starformation ceased a few gyrs ago. because of the large uncertainty in theabsorption indices in our samples, further observations are needed in order toplace constraints on the mechanisms that quench star formation in passivespiral galaxies.

1308.5129	a study of selection methods for h alpha emitting galaxies at z~1.3 for  the subaru/fmos galaxy redshift survey for cosmology (fastsound)	the efficient selection of high-redshift emission galaxies is important forfuture large galaxy redshift surveys for cosmology. here we describe the targetselection methods for the fastsound project, a redshift survey for h alphaemitting galaxies at z=1.2-1.5 using subaru/fmos to measure the linear growthrate f\sigma 8 via redshift space distortion (rsd) and constrain the theory ofgravity. to select ~400 target galaxies in the 0.2 deg^2 fmos field-of-viewfrom photometric data of cfhtls-wide (u*g'r'i'z'), we test several differentmethods based on color-color diagrams or photometric redshift estimates fromspectral energy distribution (sed) fitting. we also test the improvement inselection efficiency that can be achieved by adding near-infrared data from theukidss dxs (j). the success rates of h alpha detection with fmos averaged overtwo observed fields using these methods are 11.3% (color-color, optical), 13.6%(color-color, optical+nir), 17.3% (photo-z, optical), and 15.1% (photo-z,optical+nir). selection from photometric redshifts tends to give a betterefficiency than color-based methods, although there is no significantimprovement by adding j band data within the statistical scatter. we alsoinvestigate the main limiting factors for the success rate, by using the sampleof the hizels h alpha emitters that were selected by narrow-band imaging.although the number density of total h alpha emitters having higher h alphafluxes than the fmos sensitivity is comparable with the fmos fiber density, thelimited accuracy of photometric redshift and h alpha flux estimations havecomparable effects on the success rate of &lt;~20% obtained from sed fitting.

astro-ph;0112482	the cut &amp; enhance method : selecting clusters of galaxies from the sdss  commissioning data	we describe an automated method, the cut &amp; enhance method (ce) for detectingclusters of galaxies in multi-color optical imaging surveys. this method usessimple color cuts, combined with a density enhancement algorithm, to up-weightpairs of galaxies that are close in both angular separation and color. themethod is semi-parametric since it uses minimal assumptions about clusterproperties in order to minimize possible biases. no assumptions are made aboutthe shape of clusters, their radial profile or their luminosity function. themethod is successful in finding systems ranging from poor to rich clusters ofgalaxies, of both regular and irregular shape. we determine the selectionfunction of the ce method via extensive monte carlo simulations which use boththe real, observed background of galaxies and a randomized background ofgalaxies. we use position shuffled and color shuffled data to perform the falsepositive test. we have also visually checked all the clusters detected by thece method. we apply the ce method to the 350 deg^2 of the sdss (sloan digitalsky survey) commissioning data and construct a sdss ce galaxy cluster catalogwith an estimated redshift and richness for each cluster. the ce method iscompared with other cluster selection methods used on sdss data such as thematched filter (postman et al. 1996, kim et al. 2001), maxbcg technique (anniset al. 2001) and voronoi tessellation (kim et al. 2001). the ce method can beadopted for cluster selection in any multi-color imaging surveys.

astro-ph;0210193	galaxy star-formation as a function of environment in the early data  release of the sloan digital sky survey	(abridged) we present in this paper a detailed analysis of the effect ofenvironment on the star-formation activity of galaxies within the edr of thesdss. we have used the halpha emission line to derive the star-formation rate(sfr) for each galaxy within a volume-limited sample of 8598 galaxies with 0.05&lt; z &lt; 0.095 and m(r)&lt;= -20.45. we find that the sfr of galaxies is stronglycorrelated with the local (projected) galaxy density and thus we present herethe density-sfr relation that is analogous to the density-morphology relation.the effect of density on the sfr of galaxies is seen in three ways. first, theoverall distribution of sfrs is shifted to lower values in dense environmentscompared with the field population. second, the effect is most noticeable forthe strongly star-forming galaxies in the 75th percentile of the sfrdistribution. third, there is a ``break'' (or characteristic density) in thedensity-sfr relation at a local galaxy density of 1h-2 mpc-2. to understandthis break further, we have studied the sfr of galaxies as a function ofclustercentric radius from 17 clusters and groups objectively selected from thesdss edr data. the distribution of sfrs of cluster galaxies begins to change,compared with the field population, at a clustercentric radius of 3-4 virialradii, which is consistent with the characteristic break in density that weobserve in the density-sfr relation. our tests suggest that thedensity-morphology relation alone is unlikely to explain the density-sfrrelation we observe. taken all together, these works demonstrate that thedecrease in sfr of galaxies in dense environments is a universal phenomenonover a wide range in density (from 0.08 to 10h-2 mpc-2) and redshift (out to z= 0.5).

astro-ph;0301302	the morphological butcher-oemler effect in the sdss cut&amp;enhance galaxy  cluster catalog	we investigate the evolution of the fractions of late type cluster galaxiesas a function of redshift, using one of the largest, most uniform clustersamples available. the sample consists of 514 clusters of galaxies in the range0.02&lt;z&lt;0.3 from the sloan digital sky survey cut &amp; enhance galaxy clustercatalog. this catalog was created using a single automated cluster findingalgorithm on uniform data from a single telescope, with accurate ccdphotometry, thus, minimizing selection biases. we use four independent methodsto analyze the evolution of the late type galaxy fraction. specifically, weselect late type galaxies based on: restframe g-r color, u-r color, galaxyprofile fitting and concentration index. the first criterion corresponds to theone used in the classical butcher-oemler analyses. the last three criteria aremore sensitive to the morphological type of the galaxies. in all four cases, wefind an increase in the fraction of late type galaxies with increasingredshift, significant at the 99.9% level. the results confirm that clustergalaxies do change colors with redshift (the butcher-oemler effect) and, inaddition, they change their morphology to later-type toward higher redshift --indicating a morphological equivalent of the butcher-oemler effect. we alsofind a tendency of richer clusters to have lower fractions of late typegalaxies. the trend is consistent with a ram pressure stripping model, wherericher clusters have more effective ram pressure due to their highertemperature.

astro-ph;0301303	the environment of passive spiral galaxies in the sdss	in previous work on galaxy clusters, several authors reported a discovery ofan unusual population of galaxies, which have spiral morphologies, but do notshow any star formation activity. these galaxies are called ``passivespirals'', and have been interesting since it has been difficult to understandthe existence of such galaxies. using a volume limited sample (0.05&lt;z&lt;0.1 andmr&lt;-20.5; 25813 galaxies) of the sloan digital sky survey data, we have found73 (0.28$\pm$0.03%) passive spiral galaxies and studied their environments. itis found that passive spiral galaxies live in local galaxy density 1-2mpc$^{-2}$ and 1-10 cluster-centric virial radius. thus the origins of passivespiral galaxies are likely to be cluster related. these characteristicenvironments coincide with the previously reported environment where galaxystar formation rate suddenly declines and the so-called morphology-densityrelation turns. it is likely that the same physical mechanism is responsiblefor all of these observational results. the existence of passive spiralgalaxies suggests that a physical mechanism that works calmly is preferred todynamical origins such as major merger/interaction since such a mechanism candestroy spiral arm structures. compared with observed cluster galaxy evolutionsuch as the butcher-oemler effect and the morphological butcher-oemler effect,passive spiral galaxies are likely to be a galaxy population in transitionbetween red, elliptical/s0 galaxies in low redshift clusters and blue, spiralgalaxies more numerous in higher redshift clusters.

astro-ph;0301305	hdelta-selected galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey i: the catalog	[abridged] we present here a new and homogeneous sample of 3340 galaxiesselected from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) based solely on the observedstrength of their hdelta absorption line. these galaxies are commonly known as``post-starburst'' or ``e+a'' galaxies, and the study of these galaxies hasbeen severely hampered by the lack of a large, statistical sample of suchgalaxies. in this paper, we rectify this problem by selecting a sample ofgalaxies which possess an absorption hdelta equivalent width of ew(hdelta_max)- delta ew(hdelta_max) &gt; 4a from 106682 galaxies in the sdss. we have performedextensive tests on our catalog including comparing different methodologies ofmeasuring the hdelta absorption and studying the effects of stellar absorption,dust extinction, emission-filling and measurement error. the measured abundanceof our hdelta-selected (hds) galaxies is 2.6 +/- 0.1% of all galaxies within avolume-limited sample of 0.05&lt;z&lt;0.1 and m(r*)&lt;-20.5, which is consistent withprevious studies of such galaxies in the literature. we find that only 25 ofour hds galaxies in this volume-limited sample (3.5+/-0.7%) show no evidencefor oii and halpha emission, thus indicating that true e+a (or k+a) galaxiesare extremely rare objects at low redshift, i.e., only 0.09+/-0.02% of allgalaxies in this volume-limited sample are true e+a galaxies. in contrast,89+/-5% of our hds galaxies in the volume-limited sample have significantdetections of the oii and halpha emission lines. we find 27 galaxies in ourvolume-limited hds sample that possess no detectable oii emission, but dohowever possess detectable halpha emission. these galaxies may be dustystar-forming galaxies. we provide the community with this new catalog ofhdelta-selected galaxies to aid in the understanding of these galaxies.

astro-ph;0301306	the interplay of cluster and galaxy evolution	we review here the interplay of cluster and galaxy evolution. as a casestudy, we consider the butcher-oemler effect and propose that it is the resultof the changing rate of cluster merger events in a hierarchical universe. thiscase study highlights the need for new catalogs of clusters and groups thatpossess quantified morphologies. we present such a sample here, namely thesloan digital sky survey (sdss) c4 catalog, which has been objectively-selectedfrom the sdss spectroscopic galaxy sample. we outline here the c4 algorithm andpresent first results based on the sdss early data release, including an x-rayluminosity-velocity dispersion (l_x-sigma) scaling relationship (as a functionof cluster morphology), and the density-sfr relation of galaxies within c4clusters (gomez et al. 2003). we also discuss the merger of coma and thengc4839 group, and its effect on the galaxy populations in these systems. wefinish with a brief discussion of a new sample of hdelta-selected galaxies(i.e., k+a, post--starburst galaxies) obtained from the sdss spectroscopicsurvey.

astro-ph;0307074	selection and photometric properties of k+a galaxies	two different simple measurements of galaxy star formation rate withdifferent timescales are compared empirically on $156,395$ fiber spectra ofgalaxies with $r&lt;17.77$ mag taken from the sloan digital sky survey in theredshift range $0.05&lt;z&lt;0.20$: a ratio $\aamp / \kamp$ found by fitting a linearsum of an average old stellar poplulation spectrum (\kamp) and average a-starspectrum (\aamp) to the galaxy spectrum, and the equivalent width (ew) of the$\halpha$ emission line. the two measures are strongly correlated, but there isa small clearly separated population of outliers from the median correlationthat display excess $\aamp /\kamp$ relative to \halpha ew. these ``k+a'' (or``e+a'') galaxies must have dramatically decreased their star-formation ratesover the last $\sim 1$ gyr. the k+a luminosity distribution is very similar tothat of the total galaxy population. the k+a population appears to bebulge-dominated, but bluer and higher surface-brightness than normalbulge-dominated galaxies; it appears that k+a galaxies will fade with time intonormal bulge-dominated galaxies. the inferred rate density for k+a galaxyformation is $\sim 10^{-4} h^3 mpc^{-3} gyr^{-1}$ at redshift $z\sim 0.1$.these events are taking place in the field; k+a galaxies don't primarily lie inthe high-density environments or clusters typical of bulge-dominatedpopulations.

astro-ph;0312040	evolution of the colour--radius relation and the morphology--radius  relation in the sdss galaxy clusters	we have investigated the redshift evolution of thecolour--cluster-centric-radius relation and themorphology--cluster-centric-radius relation in three redshift bins,  $0.02\leq z\leq 0.14$, $0.14&lt; z\leq 0.20$, and $0.20&lt; z\leq 0.30$ using ahomogeneous sample of 736 galaxy clusters selected from the sloan  digital sky survey. both the relations are well-defined in all the redshiftbins; the fraction of blue/late-type galaxies increases toward outside ofclusters.blue/late-type galaxy fractions are found to decrease with decreasingredshift at any cluster-centric radius. the trend is consistent with thebutcher-oemler effect and the morphological butcher-oemlereffect. in addition,we find that colour (spectral) evolution is almost completed by $z\sim0.2$,whereas morphological evolution continues to the present day. the colour-radiusrelation is smooth inall the redshift bins, while the morphology--radiusrelation has a break only in the highest redshift bin. it is also foundthatfractions of blue-late type galaxies decreases mostly between the highestand the intermediate redshift bins, while fractions of red-late type galaxiescontinuously decreases with decreasing redshift through all the redshift bins.  these results are consistent with the interpretation that the timescale ofthe colour (spectral) evolution is shorter than that of the morphologicalevolution. it is suggested that red-late type galaxies in the middle of thetransformation are observed as passive spiral galaxies.

astro-ph;0312043	the morphology-density relation in the sloan digital sky survey	we have studied the morphology-density relation andmorphology--cluster-centric-radius relation using a volume limited sample(0.05$&lt;z&lt;$0.1, $mr^*&lt;-$20.5) of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) data.  we found there are two characteristic changes in both the morphology-densityand the morphology-radius relations, suggesting two different mechanisms areresponsible for the relations.  in the sparsest regions (below 1 mpc$^{-2}$ or outside of 1 virial radius),both relations become less noticeable, suggesting the responsible physicalmechanisms for galaxy morphological change require denser environment.  in the intermediate density regions (density between 1 and 6 mpc$^{-2}$ orvirial radius between 0.3 and 1), intermediate-type fractions increase towarddenser regions, whereas late-disc fractions decrease.  in the densest regions (above 6 mpc$^{-2}$ or inside of 0.3 virial radius),intermediate-type fractions decrease radically and early-type fractionsincrease in turn. this is a contrasting result to that in intermediate regionsand it suggests that yet another mechanism is more responsible for themorphological change in these regions.  we also compared the morphology-density relation from the sdss(0.01$&lt;z&lt;$0.054) with that of the morphs data ($z\sim$0.5). two relations lieon top of each other, suggesting that the morphology-density relation wasalready established at $z\sim$0.5 as is in the present universe.

astro-ph;0405562	are passive spiral galaxies truly "passive" and "spiral"? :  near-infrared perspective	passive spiral galaxies -- unusual galaxies with spiral morphology withoutany sign of on-going star formation -- have recently been discovered to existpreferentially in cluster infalling regions (at about the virial radius, or ata local galaxy density of $\sim 1$ mpc$^{-2}$). the discovery directly connectsthe passive spiral galaxies to the cluster galaxy evolution studies such as thebutcher-oemler effect or the morphology-density relation, i.e., passive spiralgalaxies are likely to be transition objects between high-z blue, spiralgalaxies and low-z red, cluster early-type galaxies. thus, detailed study ofpassive spiral galaxies potentially could bring a new insight on the underlyingphysical mechanisms governing cluster galaxy evolution. however, in previouswork, passive spiral galaxies are selected from the low resolution opticalimages with $\sim 1.5$ arcsec of seeing. therefore, passive spirals could be amis-identification of s0 galaxies; or dusty-starburst galaxies which are notpassive at all. to answer these questions, we performed a deep,high-resolution, near-infrared imaging of 32 passive spiral galaxies. our highresolution $k$ band images show clear spiral arm structures. thus, passivespirals are not s0s. optical-infrared colour does not show any signs ofdusty-starburst at all. therefore, it is likely that they are truly ``passive''and ``spiral'' galaxies in the midst of cluster galaxy evolution.

astro-ph;0411132	the environmental dependence of galaxy properties in the local universe:  dependence on luminosity, local density, and system richness	we investigate the environmental dependence of star formation and themorphology of galaxies in the local universe based on a volume-limited sample(0.030&lt;z&lt;0.065 and m_r&lt;m_r^*+2) constructed from the data of the sloan digitalsky survey. first, we focus on how galaxy properties change with local density.the star formation and morphology show a 'break' at the critical local densityof log sigma_crit~0.4 galaxies h_75^2 mpc^-2, which is in agreement withprevious studies. however, the break can be seen only for faint galaxies(m^*_r+1 &lt; m_r &lt; m^*_r+2), and bright galaxies (m_r &lt; m^*_r+1) show no break.thus, galaxies of different luminosities are found to show differentenvironmental dependencies. next, we examine dependencies on richness of galaxysystems. star formation activities of galaxies are different from those offield galaxies even in systems as poor as sigma~100 km/s. this result suggeststhat environmental mechanisms that are effective only in rich systems, such asram-pressure stripping of cold gas and harassment, have not played a major rolein transforming galaxies into red early-type galaxies. strangulation andinteractions between galaxies, however, remain candidates of the driver of theenvironmental dependence. in the dense environments in the local universe, theslow transformation of faint galaxies occurs to some extent, but thetransformation of bright galaxies is not clearly visible. we suggest that theevolution of bright galaxies is not strongly related to galaxy system, such asgroups and clusters, while the evolution of faint galaxies is likely to beclosely connected to galaxy system.

astro-ph;0411516	the luminosity functions of the galaxy cluster ms1054-0321 at z=0.83  based on acs photometry	we present new measurements of the galaxy luminosity function (lf) and itsdependence on local galaxy density, color, morphology, and clustocentric radiusfor the massive z=0.83 cluster ms1054-0321. our analyses are based on imagingperformed with the acs onboard the hst in the f606w, f775w and f850lp passbandsand extensive spectroscopic data obtained with the keck lris. our main resultsare based on a spectroscopically selected sample of 143 cluster members withmorphological classifications derived from the acs observations. our threeprimary findings are (1) the faint-end slope of the lf is steepest in thebluest filter, (2) the lf in the inner part of the cluster (or highest densityregions) has a flatter faint-end slope, and (3) the fraction of early-typegalaxies is higher at the bright end of the lf, and gradually decreases towardfainter magnitudes. these characteristics are consistent with those in localgalaxy clusters, indicating that, at least in massive clusters, the commoncharacteristics of cluster lfs are established at z=0.83. we also find a 2sigmadeficit of intrinsically faint, red galaxies (i-z&gt;0.5, mi&gt;-19) in this cluster.this trend may suggest that faint, red galaxies (which are common in z&lt;0.1 richclusters) have not yet been created in this cluster at z=0.83. thegiant-to-dwarf ratio in ms1054-0321 starts to increase inwards of the virialradius or when sigma&gt;30 mpc^-2, coinciding with the environment where thegalaxy star formation rate and the morphology-density relation start to appear.(abridged)

astro-ph;0411517	do star formation rates of galaxy clusters depend on mass?:  blue/late-type fractions, total star formation rates of 115 galaxy clusters  as a function of cluster virial mass	there has been plenty of observational evidence of cluster galaxy evolutionsuch as the butcher-oemler effect and the decrease in s0 fraction withincreasing redshift. as a modern version, the redshift evolution of total starformation rate (sfr) in clusters has been actively debated recently. however,these studies of redshift trend have been always hampered by the possible massdependence; due to the observational selection effects, clusters found athigher redshift inevitably tend to be more massive and luminous than localcounterparts. consequently, one has to correct for the mass trend beforeinterpreting the redshift trend.  as an attempt to break this degeneracy, we investigate the mass dependence ofblue/late-type fractions and total sfr of 115 clusters at $z\leq 0.09$ selectedfrom the sloan digital sky survey. we find that none of blue/late-typefractions, total sfr and total sfr normalized by cluster mass shows significantdependence on cluster virial mass. the scatter is much larger at each clustermass than a possible trend. our results indicates that physical mechanisms thatdepend on cluster mass (such as the ram-pressure stripping) are not likely tobe solely responsible for cluster galaxy evolution. our results also provide anexcellent low redshift comparison sample for future high redshift cluster sfrstudies.

astro-ph;0411518	are e+a galaxies dusty-starbursts?: vla 20cm radio continuum observation	e+a galaxies are characterized as a galaxy with strong balmer absorptionlines but without any [oii] or halpha emission lines. strong balmer absorptionlines indicate that e+a galaxies have experienced a starburst within the last&lt;1-1.5 gyr. however, the lack of emission lines indicates that e+a galaxies donot have any on-going star formation. therefore, e+a galaxies are interpretedas a post-starburst galaxy. however, it has been a mystery why e+a galaxiesunderwent a starburst then stopped abruptly.  one possible explanation to e+a galaxies is the dusty starburst scenario,where e+a galaxies have on-going star formation, but optical emission lines areinvisible due to the heavy obscuration by dust. to test this dusty starburstscenario, we have observed 36 e+a galaxies carefully selected from the sdss dr1in 20cm radio continuum using the vla. since the radio emission is not affectedby the dust extinction, the sfr in dusty galaxies can be revealed by the 20 cmcontinuum. all of our 36 target e+a galaxies are selected to have h\delta ewgreater than 6a and no detection of [oii] or halpha emission lines within 1sigma. these selection criteria are much stronger than previous e+a selectionsin our attempt to select galaxies in the pure post-starburst phase without anyremaining star formation. except for the two galaxies with a nearby radiosource, none of our 34 e+a galaxies are detected in 20 cm continuum to thelimits reported in table 1. the obtained upper limits on the radio estimatedsfr suggest that e+a galaxies do not possess strong starburst (&gt; 100 msunyr^-1) hidden by dust extinction for the whole sample while 15 (z&lt;0.08) e+ashave lower sfr upper limits of ~15 msun yr^-1.

astro-ph;0503088	266 e+a galaxies selected from the sloan digital sky survey data release  2: the origin of e+a galaxies	e+a galaxies are characterized as a galaxy with strong balmer absorptionlines but without any [oii] nor h$\alpha$ emission lines. the existence ofstrong balmer absorption lines indicates that e+a galaxies have experiencedstarburst within recent one gyr. however, the lack of [oii] and h$\alpha$emission lines indicates that e+a galaxies do not have any on-going starformation. therefore, e+a galaxies are interpreted as a post-starburst galaxy.for many years, however, it has been a mystery why e+a galaxies startedstarburst and why they quenched the star formation abruptly.  using one of the largest samples of 266 e+a galaxies carefully selected fromthe sloan digital sky survey data release 2, we have investigated theenvironment of e+a galaxies from 50 kpc to 8 mpc scale, i.e., from a typicaldistance to satellite galaxies to the scale of large scale structures. we foundthat e+a galaxies have excess of local galaxy density only at a scale of $&lt;100$kpc (with a two $\sigma$ significance), but not at the cluster scale ($\sim$1.5mpc) nor in the scale of large scale structure ($\sim$8 mpc). these resultsindicate that e+a galaxies are not created by the physical mechanismsassociated with galaxy clusters or the large scale structure, but are likely tobe created by the dynamical interaction with closely accompanying galaxies at a$&lt;$100 kpc scale. the claim is also supported by the morphology of e+agalaxies. we have found that almost all e+a galaxies have a bright compactcore, and that $\sim$30% of e+a galaxies have dynamically disturbed signaturesor the tidal tails, being quite suggestive of morphological appearance ofmerger/interaction remnants.

astro-ph;0503089	velocity dispersion of 335 galaxy clusters selected from the sloan  digital sky survey: statistical evidence for dynamical interaction, and  against ram-pressure stripping	there has been plenty of observational evidence of cluster galaxy evolution.however, it has been difficult to identify the origin of the cluster galaxyevolution. here we show that gravitational interaction/friction betweengalaxies is the statistically dominant physical mechanism responsible for thecluster galaxy evolution, and that the well-favored ram-pressure stripping bythe cluster gas is not statistically driving the cluster galaxy evolution.  we have constructed the largest composite cluster with 14548 member galaxiesout of 335 clusters with ~&gt;300 km/s carefully selected from the sdss. bymeasuring velocity dispersions of various subsamples of galaxies in thiscomposite cluster, we found that bright cluster galaxies (mz&lt;-23) havesignificantly smaller velocity dispersion than faint galaxies (mz&gt;-23). weinterpret this as direct evidence of the dynamical interaction/friction betweencluster galaxies, where massive galaxies lose their velocity through the energyequipartition during the dynamical interaction/friction with less massivegalaxies. we also found that star-forming late-type galaxies have a largervelocity dispersion than passive late-type galaxies. this is inconsistent withthe ram-pressure stripping model; since the ram-pressure is proportional tosigma v^2 (i.e., stronger for galaxies with high velocity), the ram-pressurestripping cannot explain the observed trends of passive (evolved) galaxieshaving low velocity rather than high velocity. on the other hand, the result isagain consistent with the dynamical galaxy-galaxy interaction/friction, wheremore evolved (passive) galaxies lose their velocity through dynamicalinteraction/friction.

(v) more ir luminous galaxies haveslightly larger halpha/hbeta ratio; (vi) more ir luminous galaxies have morecentrally-concentrated morphology, being consistent with the morphologicalappearance of galaxy-galaxy merger remnants. optical image of ultra/veryluminous infrared galaxies also show frequent signs of merger/interaction.(vii) comparison with the sed synthesis models indicate that majority ofluminous infrared galaxies (l &gt; 10^11lsun) may be in a post-starburst phase,sharing a similar (but not the same) merger/interaction origin with e+agalaxies.

astro-ph;0504287	total galaxy magnitudes and effective radii from petrosian magnitudes  and radii	petrosian magnitudes were designed to help with the difficult task ofdetermining a galaxy's total light. although these magnitudes (taken here asthe flux within 2r_p, with the inverted petrosian index 1/eta(r_p)=0.2) canrepresent most of an object's flux, they do of course miss the light outside ofthe petrosian aperture (2r_p). the size of this flux deficit variesmonotonically with the shape of a galaxy's light-profile, i.e., itsconcentration. in the case of a de vaucouleurs r^{1/4} profile, the deficit is0.20 mag; for an r^{1/8} profile this figure rises to 0.50 mag. here we providea simple method for recovering total (sersic) magnitudes from petrosianmagnitudes using only the galaxy concentration (r_90/r_50 or r_80/r_20) withinthe petrosian aperture. the corrections hold to the extent that sersic's modelprovides a good description of a galaxy's luminosity profile. we show how theconcentration can also be used to convert petrosian radii into effectivehalf-light radii, enabling a robust measure of the mean effective surfacebrightness. our technique is applied to the sdss dr2 petrosian parameters,yielding good agreement with the total magnitudes, effective radii, and meaneffective surface brightnesses obtained from the nyu--vagc sersic r^{1/n} fitsby blanton et al. (2005). although the corrective procedure described here isspecifically applicable to the sdss dr2 and dr3, it is generally applicable toall imaging data where any petrosian index and concentration can beconstructed.
