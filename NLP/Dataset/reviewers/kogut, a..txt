0901.0555	arcade 2 measurement of the extra-galactic sky temperature at 3-90 ghz	the arcade 2 instrument has measured the absolute temperature of the sky atfrequencies 3, 8, 10, 30, and 90 ghz, using an open-aperture cryogenicinstrument observing at balloon altitudes with no emissive windows between thebeam-forming optics and the sky. an external blackbody calibrator provides an{\it in situ} reference. systematic errors were greatly reduced by usingdifferential radiometers and cooling all critical components to physicaltemperatures approximating the cmb temperature. a linear model is used tocompare the output of each radiometer to a set of thermometers on theinstrument. small corrections are made for the residual emission from theflight train, balloon, atmosphere, and foreground galactic emission. the arcade2 data alone show an extragalactic rise of $50\pm7$ mk at 3.3 ghz in additionto a cmb temperature of $2.730\pm .004$ k. combining the arcade 2 data withdata from the literature shows a background power law spectrum of $t=1.26\pm0.09$ [k] $(\nu/\nu_0)^{-2.60\pm 0.04}$ from 22 mhz to 10 ghz ($\nu_0=1$ ghz)in addition to a cmb temperature of $2.725\pm .001$ k.

1001.4758	seven-year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) observations: are  there cosmic microwave background anomalies?	(abridged) a simple six-parameter lcdm model provides a successful fit towmap data, both when the data are analyzed alone and in combination with othercosmological data. even so, it is appropriate to search for any hints ofdeviations from the now standard model of cosmology, which includes inflation,dark energy, dark matter, baryons, and neutrinos. the cosmological communityhas subjected the wmap data to extensive and varied analyses. while there iswidespread agreement as to the overall success of the six-parameter lcdm model,various "anomalies" have been reported relative to that model. in this paper weexamine potential anomalies and present analyses and assessments of theirsignificance. in most cases we find that claimed anomalies depend on posteriorselection of some aspect or subset of the data. compared with sky simulationsbased on the best fit model, one can select for low probability features of thewmap data. low probability features are expected, but it is not usuallystraightforward to determine whether any particular low probability feature isthe result of the a posteriori selection or of non-standard cosmology. weexamine in detail the properties of the power spectrum with respect to the lcdmmodel. we examine several potential or previously claimed anomalies in the skymaps and power spectra, including cold spots, low quadrupole power,quadropole-octupole alignment, hemispherical or dipole power asymmetry, andquadrupole power asymmetry. we conclude that there is no compelling evidencefor deviations from the lcdm model, which is generally an acceptablestatistical fit to wmap and other cosmological data.

astro-ph;9401012	cosmic temperature fluctuations from two years of cobe dmr observations	the first two years of cobe dmr observations of the cmb anisotropy areanalyzed and compared with our previously published first year results. theresults are consistent, but the addition of the second year of data increasesthe precision and accuracy of the detected cmb temperature fluctuations. thetwo-year 53 ghz data are characterized by rms temperature fluctuations ofdt=44+/-7 uk at 7 degrees and dt=30.5+/-2.7 uk at 10 degrees angularresolution. the 53x90 ghz cross-correlation amplitude at zero lag isc(0)^{1/2}=36+/-5 uk (68%cl) for the unsmoothed 7 degree dmr data. a likelihoodanalysis of the cross correlation function, including the quadrupoleanisotropy, gives a most likely quadrupole-normalized amplitudeq_{rms-ps}=12.4^{+5.2}_{-3.3} uk (68% cl) and a spectral indexn=1.59^{+0.49}_{-0.55} for a power law model of initial density fluctuations,p(k)~k^n. with n fixed to 1.0 the most likely amplitude is 17.4 +/-1.5 uk (68%cl). excluding the quadrupole anisotropy we find q_{rms-ps}= 16.0^{+7.5}_{-5.2}uk (68% cl), n=1.21^{+0.60}_{-0.55}, and, with n fixed to 1.0 the most likelyamplitude is 18.2+/-1.6 uk (68% cl). monte carlo simulations indicate thatthese derived estimates of n may be biased by ~+0.3 (with the observed lowvalue of the quadrupole included in the analysis) and {}~+0.1 (with thequadrupole excluded). thus the most likely bias-corrected estimate of n isbetween 1.1 and 1.3. our best estimate of the dipole from the two-year dmr datais 3.363+/-0.024 mk towards galactic coordinates (l,b)= (264.4+/-0.2 degrees,+48.1+/-0.4 degrees), and our best estimate of the rms quadrupole amplitude inour sky is 6+/-3 uk.

astro-ph;9403021	correlated errors in the cobe dmr sky maps	the {\it cobe} dmr sky maps contain low-level correlated noise. we obtainestimates of the amplitude and pattern of the correlated noise from threetechniques: angular averages of the covariance matrix, monte carlo simulationsof two-point correlation functions, and direct analysis of the dmr maps. theresults from the three methods are mutually consistent. the noise covariancematrix of a dmr sky map is diagonal to an accuracy of better than 1\%. for agiven sky pixel, the dominant noise covariance occurs with the ring of pixelsat an angular separation of $60 \deg$ due to the $60 \deg$ separation of thedmr horns. the mean covariance at $60 \deg$ is $0.45\% ^{+0.18}_{-0.14}$ of themean variance. additionally, the variance in a given pixel is $0.7\%$ greaterthan would be expected from a single beam experiment with the same noiseproperties. auto-correlation functions suffer from a $\sim 1.5\; \sigma$positive bias at $60 \deg$ while cross-correlations have no bias. published{\it cobe} dmr results are not significantly affected by correlated noise. cobepre-print 94-

astro-ph;9408097	on the rms anisotropy at 7 degrees and 10 degrees observed in the  cobe-dmr two year sky maps	the frequency-independent rms temperature fluctuations determined from thecobe-dmr two year sky maps are used to infer the parameter q_{rms-ps}, whichcharacterizes the normalization of power law models of primordial cosmologicaltemperature anisotropy. in particular, a 'cross'-rms statistic is used todetermine q_{rms-ps} for a forced fit to a scale-invariant harrison-zel'dovich(n = 1) spectral model. using a joint analysis of the 7 degree and 10 degreerms temperature derived from both the 53 and 90 ghz sky maps, we findq_{rms-ps} = 17.0^{+2.5}_{-2.1} uk when the low quadrupole is included, andq_{rms-ps} = 19.4^{+2.3}_{-2.1} uk excluding the quadrupole. these results areconsistent with the n = 1 fits from more sensitive methods (e.g. powerspectrum, correlation function). the effect of the low quadrupole derived fromthe cobe-dmr data on the inferred q_{rms-ps} normalization is investigated. abias to lower q_{rms-ps} is found when the quadrupole is included. the highernormalization for a forced n = 1 fit is then favored by the cross-rmstechnique. as initially pointed out in wright et al. (1994a) and furtherdiscussed here, analytic formulae for the rms sky temperature fluctuations willnot provide the correct normalization amplitude.

astro-ph;9601058	band power spectra in the cobe dmr 4-year anisotropy maps	we employ a pixel-based likelihood technique to estimate the angular powerspectrum of the cobe differential microwave radiometer (dmr) 4-year sky maps.the spectrum is consistent with a scale-invariant power-law form with anormalization, expressed in terms of the expected quadrupole anisotropy, ofq_{rms-ps|n=1} = 18 +/- 1.4 uk, and a best-fit spectral index of 1.2 +/- 0.3.the normalization is somewhat smaller than we concluded from the 2-year data,mainly due to additional galactic modeling. we extend the analysis toinvestigate the extent to which the ``small" quadrupole observed in our sky isstatistically consistent with a power-law spectrum. the most likely quadrupoleamplitude is somewhat dependent on the details of galactic foregroundsubtraction and data selection, ranging between 7 and 10 uk, but in no case isthere compelling evidence that the quadrupole is too small to be consistentwith a power-law spectrum. we conclude with a likelihood analysis of the bandpower amplitude in each of four spectral bands between l = 2 and 40, and findno evidence for deviations from a simple power-law spectrum.

astro-ph;9601067	4-year cobe dmr cosmic microwave background observations: maps and basic  results	the cosmic microwave background radiation provides unique constraints oncosmological models. in this letter we present a summary of the spatialproperties of the cosmic microwave background radiation based on the full 4years of cobe dmr observations, as detailed in a set of companion letters. theanisotropy is consistent with a scale-invariant power law model and gaussianstatistics. with full use of the multi-frequency 4-year dmr data, including ourestimate of the effects of galactic emission, we find a power-law spectralindex of $n=1.2\pm 0.3$ and a quadrupole normalization$q_{rms-ps}=15.3^{+3.8}_{-2.8}$ $\mu$k. for $n=1$ the best-fit normalization is$q_{rms-ps}\vert_{n=1}=18\pm 1.6$ $\mu$k. these values are consistent with bothour previous 1-year and 2-year results. the results include use of the $\ell=2$quadrupole term; exclusion of this term gives consistent results, but withlarger uncertainties. the 4-year sky maps, presented in this letter, portray anaccurate overall visual impression of the anisotropy since the signal-to-noiseratio is ~2 per 10 degree sky map patch. the improved signal-to-noise ratio ofthe 4-year maps also allows for improvements in galactic modeling and limits onnon-gaussian statistics.

astro-ph;9707252	a determination of the spectral index of galactic synchrotron emission  in the 1-10 ghz range	we present an analysis of simultaneous multifrequency measurements of thegalactic emission in the 1-10 ghz range with 18 degrees, angular resolutiontaken from a high altitude site. our data yield a determination of thesynchrotron spectral index between 1.4 ghz and 7.5 ghz of 2.81 +/- 0.16.combining our data with the maps from haslam et al. (1982) and reich &amp; reich(1986) we find 2.76 +/- 0.11 in the 0.4 - 7.5 ghz range. these results are inagreement with the few previously published measurements. the variation ofspectral index with frequency based on our results and compared with other datafound in the literature suggests a steepening of the synchrotron spectrumtowards high frequencies as expected from theory, because of the steepening ofthe parent cosmic ray electron energy spectrum. comparison between the haslamdata and the 19 ghz map (cottingham 1987) also indicates a significant spectralindex variation on large angular scale. addition quality data are necessary toprovide a serious study of these effects.

0811.3915	cmbpol mission concept study: prospects for polarized foreground removal	in this report we discuss the impact of polarized foregrounds on a futurecmbpol satellite mission. we review our current knowledge of galactic polarizedemission at microwave frequencies, including synchrotron and thermal dustemission. we use existing data and our understanding of the physical behaviorof the sources of foreground emission to generate sky templates, and start toassess how well primordial gravitational wave signals can be separated fromforeground contaminants for a cmbpol mission. at the estimated foregroundminimum of ~100 ghz, the polarized foregrounds are expected to be lower than aprimordial polarization signal with tensor-to-scalar ratio r=0.01, in a smallpatch (~1%) of the sky known to have low galactic emission. over 75% of the skywe expect the foreground amplitude to exceed the primordial signal by about afactor of eight at the foreground minimum and on scales of two degrees. only onthe largest scales does the polarized foreground amplitude exceed theprimordial signal by a larger factor of about 20. the prospects for detectingan r=0.01 signal including degree-scale measurements appear promising, with 5sigma_r ~0.003 forecast from multiple methods. a mission that observes a rangeof scales offers better prospects from the foregrounds perspective than onetargeting only the lowest few multipoles. we begin to explore how optimizingthe composition of frequency channels in the focal plane can maximize ourability to perform component separation, with a range of typically 40 &lt; nu &lt;300 ghz preferred for ten channels. foreground cleaning methods are already inplace to tackle a cmbpol mission data set, and further investigation of theoptimization and detectability of the primordial signal will be useful formission design.

0811.4280	five-year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) observations:  bayesian estimation of cmb polarization maps	we describe a sampling method to estimate the polarized cmb signal fromobserved maps of the sky. we use a metropolis-within-gibbs algorithm toestimate the polarized cmb map, containing q and u stokes parameters at eachpixel, and its covariance matrix. these can be used as inputs for cosmologicalanalyses. the polarized sky signal is parameterized as the sum of threecomponents: cmb, synchrotron emission, and thermal dust emission. the polarizedgalactic components are modeled with spatially varying power law spectralindices for the synchrotron, and a fixed power law for the dust, and theircomponent maps are estimated as by-products. we apply the method to simulatedlow resolution maps with pixels of side 7.2 degrees, using diagonal and fullnoise realizations drawn from the wmap noise matrices. the cmb maps arerecovered with goodness of fit consistent with errors. computing the likelihoodof the e-mode power in the maps as a function of optical depth to reionization,tau, for fixed temperature anisotropy power, we recover tau=0.091+-0.019 for asimulation with input tau=0.1, and mean tau=0.098 averaged over 10 simulations.a `null' simulation with no polarized cmb signal has maximum likelihoodconsistent with tau=0. the method is applied to the five-year wmap data, usingthe k, ka, q and v channels. we find tau=0.090+-0.019, compared totau=0.086+-0.016 from the template-cleaned maps used in the primary wmapanalysis. the synchrotron spectral index, beta, averaged over highsignal-to-noise pixels with standard deviation sigma(beta)&lt;0.25, but excluding~6% of the sky masked in the galactic plane, is -3.03+-0.04. this estimate doesnot vary significantly with galactic latitude, although includes an informativeprior.
