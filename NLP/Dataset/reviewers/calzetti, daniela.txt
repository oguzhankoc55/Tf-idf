0902.2973	the history of star formation in galaxies	if we are to develop a comprehensive and predictive theory of galaxyformation and evolution, it is essential that we obtain an accurate assessmentof how and when galaxies assemble their stellar populations, and how thisassembly varies with environment. there is strong observational support for thehierarchical assembly of galaxies, but by definition the dwarf galaxies we seetoday are not the same as the dwarf galaxies and proto-galaxies that weredisrupted during the assembly. our only insight into those disrupted buildingblocks comes from sifting through the resolved field populations of thesurviving giant galaxies to reconstruct the star formation history, chemicalevolution, and kinematics of their various structures. to obtain the detaileddistribution of stellar ages and metallicities over the entire life of agalaxy, one needs multi-band photometry reaching solar-luminosity main sequencestars. the hubble space telescope can obtain such data in the outskirts oflocal group galaxies. to perform these essential studies for a fair sample ofthe local universe will require observational capabilities that allow us toextend the study of resolved stellar populations to much larger galaxy samplesthat span the full range of galaxy morphologies, while also enabling the studyof the more crowded regions of relatively nearby galaxies. with suchcapabilities in hand, we will reveal the detailed history of star formation andchemical evolution in the universe.

0903.2062	the chandra cosmos survey, i: overview and point source catalog	the chandra cosmos survey (c-cosmos) is a large, 1.8 ms, chandra} programthat has imaged the central 0.5 sq.deg of the cosmos field (centered at 10h,+02deg) with an effective exposure of ~160ksec, and an outer 0.4sq.deg. areawith an effective exposure of ~80ksec. the limiting source detection depths are1.9e-16 erg cm(-2) s(-1) in the soft (0.5-2 kev) band, 7.3e(-16) erg cm^-2 s^-1in the hard (2-10 kev) band, and 5.7e(-16) erg cm(-2) s(-1) in the full (0.5-10kev) band. here we describe the strategy, design and execution of the c-cosmossurvey, and present the catalog of 1761 point sources detected at a probabilityof being spurious of &lt;2e(-5) (1655 in the full, 1340 in the soft, and 1017 inthe hard bands). by using a grid of 36 heavily (~50%) overlapping pointingpositions with the acis-i imager, a remarkably uniform (to 12%) exposure acrossthe inner 0.5 sq.deg field was obtained, leading to a sharply defined lowerflux limit. the widely different psfs obtained in each exposure at each pointin the field required a novel source detection method, because of theoverlapping tiling strategy, which is described in a companion paper. (puccettiet al. paper ii). this method produced reliable sources down to a 7-12 counts,as verified by the resulting logn-logs curve, with sub-arcsecond positions,enabling optical and infrared identifications of virtually all sources, asreported in a second companion paper (civano et al. paper iii). the fullcatalog is described here in detail, and is available on-line.

0904.2002	understanding global galactic star formation	we propose to the community a comprehensive uv/optical/nir imaging survey ofgalactic star formation regions to probe all aspects of the star formationprocess. the primary goal of such a study is to understand the evolution ofcircumstellar protoplanetary disks and other detailed aspects of star formationin a wide variety of different environments. this requires a comprehensiveemission-line survey of nearby star-forming regions in the milky way, where ahigh spatial resolution telescope+camera will be capable of resolvingcircumstellar material and shock structures. in addition to resolvingcircumstellar disks themselves, such observations will study shocks in the jetsand outflows from young stars, which are probes of accretion in the youngestprotoplanetary disks still embedded in their surrounding molecular clouds.these data will allow the measurement of proper motions for a large sample ofstars and jets/shocks in massive star-forming regions for the first time,opening a new window to study the dynamics of these environments. it willrequire better than 30 mas resolution and a stable psf to conduct precisionastrometry and photometry of stars and nebulae. such data will allow productionof precise color-color and color magnitude diagrams for millions of young starsto study their evolutionary states. one can also determine stellar rotation,multiplicity, and clustering statistics as functions of environment andlocation in the galaxy. for the first time we can systematically map thedetailed excitation structure of hii regions, stellar winds, supernovaremnants, and supershells/superbubbles. this survey will provide the basic datarequired to understand star formation as a fundamental astrophysical processthat controls the evolution of the baryonic contents of the universe.

0904.2021	a systematic study of the stellar populations and ism in galaxies out to  the virgo cluster	we present a compelling case for a systematic and comprehensive study of theresolved and unresolved stellar populations, ism, and immediate environments ofgalaxies throughout the local volume, defined here as d &lt; 20 mpc. this volumeis our cosmic backyard and the smallest volume that encompasses environments asdifferent as the virgo, ursa major, fornax and (perhaps) eridanus clusters ofgalaxies, a large number and variety of galaxy groups, and several cosmic voidregions. in each galaxy, through a pan-chromatic (160--1100nm) set ofbroad-band and diagnostic narrow-band filters, ism structures and individualluminous stars to &gt;~1 mag below the trgb should be resolved on scales of &lt;5 pc(at d &lt;~ 20 mpc, lambda ~ 800nm, for mu_i &gt;~ 24 mag/arcsec^2 and m_{i,trgb} &lt;~27.5 mag). resolved and unresolved stellar populations would be analyzedthrough color-magnitude and color-color diagram fitting and populationsynthesis modeling of multi-band colors and would yield physical propertiessuch as spatially resolved star formation histories. the ism within and aroundeach galaxy would be analyzed using key narrow-band filters that distinguishphotospheric from shock heating and provide information on the metallicity ofthe gas. such a study would finally allow unraveling the global and spatiallyresolved star formation histories of galaxies, their assembly, satellitesystems, and the dependences thereof on local and global environment within atruly representative cosmic volume. the proposed study is not feasible withcurrent instrumentation but argues for a wide-field (&gt;~250 arcmin^2),high-resolution (&lt;~0.020"--0.065" [300--1000nm]), ultraviolet--near-infraredimaging facility on a 4m-class space-based observatory.

0706.3501	the incidence of highly-obscured star-forming regions in sings galaxies	using the new capabilities of the spitzer space telescope and extensivemultiwavelength data from the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings),it is now possible to study the infrared properties of star formation in nearbygalaxies down to scales equivalent to large hii regions. we are therefore ableto determine what fraction of large, infrared-selected star-forming regions innormal galaxies are highly obscured and address how much of the star formationwe miss by relying solely on the optical portion of the spectrum. employing anew empirical method for deriving attenuations of infrared-selectedstar-forming regions we investigate the statistics of obscured star formationon 500pc scales in a sample of 38 nearby galaxies. we find that the medianattenuation is 1.4 magnitudes in h-alpha and that there is no evidence for asubstantial sub-population of uniformly highly-obscured star-forming regions.the regions in the highly-obscured tail of the attenuation distribution(a_h-alpha &gt; 3) make up only ~4% of the sample of nearly 1800 regions, thoughvery embedded infrared sources on the much smaller scales and lowerluminosities of compact and ultracompact hii regions are almost certainlypresent in greater numbers. the highly-obscured cases in our sample aregenerally the bright, central regions of galaxies with high overall attenuationbut are not otherwise remarkable. we also find that a majority of the galaxiesshow decreasing radial trends in h-alpha attenuation. the small fraction ofhighly-obscured regions seen in this sample of normal, star-forming galaxiessuggests that on 500pc scales the timescale for significant dispersal or breakup of nearby, optically-thick dust clouds is short relative to the lifetime ofa typical star-forming region.

0908.0203	dust-corrected star formation rates of galaxies. i. combinations of  h-alpha and infrared tracers	we combine h-alpha emission-line and infrared continuum measurements of twosamples of nearby galaxies to derive dust attenuation-corrected star formationrates (sfrs). we use a simple energy balance based method that has been appliedpreviously to hii regions in the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey(sings), and extend the methodology to integrated measurements of galaxies. wefind that our composite h-alpha+ir based sfrs are in excellent agreement withattenuation-corrected sfrs derived from integrated spectrophotometry, over thefull range of sfrs (0.01 -- 80 solar mass per year) and attenuations (0 -- 2.5mag) studied. we find that the combination of h-alpha and total infraredluminosities provides the most robust sfr measurements, but combinations ofh-alpha measurements with monochromatic luminosities at 24 micron and 8 micronperform nearly as well. the calibrations differ significantly from thoseobtained for hii regions (calzetti et al. 2007), with the differenceattributable to a more evolved population of stars heating the dust. ourresults are consistent with a significant component of diffuse dust (the `ircirrus' component) that is heated by a non-star-forming population. the samemethodology can be applied to [oii]$\lambda$3727 emission-line measurements,and the radio continuum fluxes of galaxies can be applied in place of ir fluxeswhen the latter are not available. we assess the precision and systematicreliability of all of these composite methods.

0909.5205	comparison of h-alpha and uv star formation rates in the local volume:  systematic discrepancies for dwarf galaxies	(abridged) using a complete sample of ~300 star-forming galaxies within 11mpc, we evaluate the consistency between star formation rates (sfrs) inferredfrom the far ultraviolet (fuv) non-ionizing continuum and h-alpha nebularemission, assuming standard conversion recipes in which the sfr scales linearlywith luminosity at a given wavelength. our analysis probes sfrs over 5 ordersof magnitude, down to ultra-low activities on the order of ~0.0001 m_sun/yr.the data are drawn from the 11 mpc h-alpha and ultraviolet galaxy survey(11hugs), which has obtained h-alpha fluxes from ground-based narrowbandimaging, and uv fluxes from imaging with galex. for normal spiral galaxies(sfr~1 m_sun/yr), our results are consistent with previous work which has shownthat fuv sfrs tend to be lower than h-alpha sfrs before accounting for internaldust attenuation, but that there is relative consistency between the twotracers after proper corrections are applied. however, a puzzle is encounteredat the faint end of the luminosity function. as lower luminosity dwarfgalaxies, roughly less active than the small magellanic cloud, are examined,h-alpha tends to increasingly under-predict the sfr relative to the fuv.although past studies have suggested similar trends, this is the first timethis effect is probed with a statistical sample for galaxies with sfr~&lt;0.1m_sun/yr. a range of standard explanations does not appear to be able toaccount for the magnitude of the systematic. some recent work has argued for animf which is deficient in high mass stars in dwarf and low surface brightnessgalaxies, and we also consider this scenario.

0708.0922	star formation in ngc 5194 (m51a). ii. the spatially-resolved star  formation law	we have studied the relationship between the star formation rate (sfr)surface density and gas surface density in the spiral galaxy m51a (ngc 5194),using multi-wavelength data obtained as part of the spitzer infrared nearbygalaxies survey (sings). we introduce a new sfr index based on a linearcombination of h-alpha emission-line and 24 micron continuum luminosities, thatprovides reliable extinction-corrected ionizing fluxes and sfr densities over awide range of dust attenuations. the combination of these extinction-correctedsfr densities with aperture synthesis hi and co maps has allowed us to probethe form of the spatially-resolved star formation law on scales of 0.5 to 2kpc. we find that the resolved sfr vs gas surface density relation is wellrepresented by a schmidt power law, which is similar in form and dispersion tothe disk-averaged schmidt law. we observe a comparably strong correlation ofthe sfr surface density with the molecular gas surface density, but nosignificant correlation with the surface density of atomic gas. thebest-fitting slope of the schmidt law varies from n = 1.37 to 1.56, withzeropoint and slope that change systematically with the spatial sampling scale.we tentatively attribute these variations to the effects of areal sampling andaveraging of a nonlinear intrinsic star formation law. our data can also befitted by an alternative parametrization of the sfr surface density in terms ofthe ratio of gas surface density to local dynamical time, but with aconsiderable dispersion.

1007.5237	the luminosity, mass, and age distributions of compact star clusters in  m83 based on hst/wfc3 observations	the newly installed wide field camera 3 (wfc3) on the hubble space telescopehas been used to obtain multi-band images of the nearby spiral galaxy m83.these new observations are the deepest and highest resolution images ever takenof a grand-design spiral, particularly in the near ultraviolet, and allow us tobetter differentiate compact star clusters from individual stars and to measurethe luminosities of even faint clusters in the u band. we find that theluminosity function for clusters outside of the very crowded starburst nucleuscan be approximated by a power law, dn/dl \propto l^{alpha}, with alpha = -2.04+/- 0.08, down to m_v ~ -5.5. we test the sensitivity of the luminosityfunction to different selection techniques, filters, binning, and aperturecorrection determinations, and find that none of these contribute significantlyto uncertainties in alpha. we estimate ages and masses for the clusters bycomparing their measured ubvi,halpha colors with predictions from singlestellar population models. the age distribution of the clusters can beapproximated by a power-law, dn/dt propto t^{gamma}, with gamma=-0.9 +/- 0.2,for m &gt; few x 10^3 msun and t &lt; 4x10^8 yr. this indicates that clusters aredisrupted quickly, with ~80-90% disrupted each decade in age over this time.the mass function of clusters over the same m-t range is a power law, dn/dmpropto m^{beta}, with beta=-1.94 +/- 0.16, and does not have bends or showcurvature at either high or low masses. therefore, we do not find evidence fora physical upper mass limit, m_c, or for the earlier disruption of lower massclusters when compared with higher mass clusters, i.e. mass-dependentdisruption. we briefly discuss these implications for the formation anddisruption of the clusters.

1010.4996	polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as star formation rate indicators	as images and spectra from iso and spitzer have provided increasinglyhigher-fidelity representations of the mid-infrared (mir) and polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbon (pah) emission from galaxies and galactic andextra-galactic regions, more systematic efforts have been devoted toestablishing whether the emission in this wavelength region can be used as areliable star formation rate indicator. this has also been in response to theextensive surveys of distant galaxies that have accumulated during the coldphase of the spitzer space telescope. results so far have been somewhatcontradictory, reflecting the complex nature of the pahs and of themid-infrared-emitting dust in general. the two main problems faced whenattempting to define a star formation rate indicator based on the mid-infraredemission from galaxies and star-forming regions are: (1) the strong dependenceof the pah emission on metallicity; (2) the heating of the pah dust by evolvedstellar populations unrelated to the current star formation. i review thestatus of the field, with a specific focus on these two problems, and will tryto quantify the impact of each on calibrations of the mid-infrared emission asa star formation rate indicator.

1011.5504	anatomy of a post-starburst minor merger: a multi-wavelength wfc3 study  of ngc 4150	(abridged) we present a spatially-resolved near-uv/optical study of ngc 4150,using the wide field camera 3 (wfc3) on board the hubble space telescope.previous studies of this early-type galaxy (etg) indicate that it has a largereservoir of molecular gas, exhibits a kinematically decoupled core (likelyindication of recent merging) and strong, central h_b absorption (indicative ofyoung stars). the core of ngc 4150 shows ubiquitous near-uv emission andremarkable dusty substructure. our analysis shows this galaxy to lie in thenear-uv green valley, and its pixel-by-pixel photometry exhibits a narrow rangeof near-uv/optical colours that are similar to those of nearby e+a(post-starburst) galaxies. we parametrise the properties of the recent starformation (age, mass fraction, metallicity and internal dust content) in thengc 4150 pixels by comparing the observed near-uv/optical photometry to stellarmodels. the typical age of the recent star formation (rsf) is around 0.9 gyrs,consistent with the similarity of the near-uv colours to post-starburstsystems, while the morphological structure of the young component supports theproposed merger scenario. the rsf metallicity, representative of themetallicity of the gas fuelling star formation, is around 0.3 - 0.5 zsun.assuming that this galaxy is a merger and that the gas is sourced mainly fromthe infalling companion, these metallicities plausibly indicate the gas-phasemetallicity (gpm) of the accreted satellite. comparison to the local mass-gpmrelation suggests (crudely) that the mass of the accreted system is around3x10^8 msun, making ngc 4150 a 1:20 minor merger. a summation of the pixel rsfmass fractions indicates that the rsf contributes about 2-3 percent of thestellar mass. this work reaffirms our hypothesis that minor mergers play asignificant role in the evolution of etgs at late epochs.

1101.4521	detection of brown dwarf-like objects in the core of ngc3603	we use near-infrared data obtained with the wide field camera 3 (wfc3) on thehubble space telescope to identify objects having the colors of brown dwarfs(bds) in the field of the massive galactic cluster ngc 3603. these areidentified through use of a combination of narrow and medium band filtersspanning the j and h bands, and which are particularly sensitive to thepresence of the 1.3-1.5{\mu}m h2o molecular band - unique to bds. we provide acalibration of the relationship between effective temperature and color forboth field stars and for bds. this photometric method provides effectivetemperatures for bds to an accuracy of {\pm}350k relative to spectroscopictechniques. this accuracy is shown to be not significantly affected by eitherstellar surface gravity or uncertainties in the interstellar extinction. weidentify nine objects having effective temperature between 1700 and 2200 k,typical of bds, observed j-band magnitudes in the range 19.5-21.5, and that arestrongly clustered towards the luminous core of ngc 3603. however, if these arelocated at the distance of the cluster, they are far too luminous to be normalbds. we argue that it is unlikely that these objects are either artifacts ofour dataset, normal field bds/m-type giants or extra-galactic contaminants and,therefore, might represent a new class of stars having the effectivetemperatures of bds but with luminosities of more massive stars. we explore theinteresting scenario in which these objects would be normal stars that haverecently tidally ingested a hot jupiter, the remnants of which are providing ashort-lived extended photosphere to the central star. in this case, we wouldexpect them to show the signature of fast rotation.

1102.2444	large-scale shock-ionized and photo-ionized gas in m83: the impact of  star formation	we investigate the ionization structure of the nebular gas in m83 using theline diagnostic diagram, [o iii](5007 \dega)/h{\beta} vs. [s ii](6716 \dega+6731 \deg a)/h{\alpha} with the newly available narrowband images from thewide field camera 3 (wfc3) of the hubble space telescope (hst). we produce thediagnostic diagram on a pixel-by-pixel (0.2" x 0.2") basis and compare it withseveral photo- and shock-ionization models. for the photo-ionized gas, weobserve a gradual increase of the log([o iii]/h{\beta}) ratios from the centerto the spiral arm, consistent with the metallicity gradient, as the h iiregions go from super solar abundance to roughly solar abundance from thecenter out. using the diagnostic diagram, we separate the photo-ionized fromthe shock-ionized component of the gas. we find that the shock-ionizedh{\alpha} emission ranges from ~2% to about 15-33% of the total, depending onthe separation criteria used. an interesting feature in the diagnostic diagramis an horizontal distribution around log([o iii]/h{\beta}) ~ 0. this feature iswell fit by a shock-ionization model with 2.0 z\odot metallicity and shockvelocities in the range of 250 km/s to 350 km/s. a low velocity shockcomponent, &lt; 200 km/s, is also detected, and is spatially located at theboundary between the outer ring and the spiral arm. the low velocity shockcomponent can be due to : 1) supernova remnants located nearby, 2) dynamicalinteraction between the outer ring and the spiral arm, 3) abnormal line ratiosfrom extreme local dust extinction. the current data do not enable us todistinguish among those three possible interpretations. our main conclusion isthat, even at the hst resolution, the shocked gas represents a small fractionof the total ionized gas emission at less than 33% of the total. however, itaccounts for virtually all of the mechanical energy produced by the centralstarburst in m83.

1102.2893	the evolution of stellar populations in the outer disks of spiral  galaxies	we investigate recent star formation in the extended ultraviolet (xuv) disksof five nearby galaxies (ngc 0628, ngc 2090, ngc 2841, ngc 3621, and ngc 5055)using a long wavelength baseline comprised of ultraviolet and mid-infraredimaging from the galaxy evolution explorer and the spitzer infrared arraycamera. we identify 229 unresolved stellar complexes across targeted portionsof their xuv disks and utilize spectral energy distribution fitting to measuretheir stellar ages and masses through comparison with starburst99 populationsynthesis models of instantaneous burst populations. we find that the medianage of outer disk associations in our sample is ~100 myr with a largedispersion that spans the entire range of our models (1 myr-1 gyr). thisrelatively evolved state for most associations addresses the observed dearth ofhalpha emission in some outer disks, as halpha can only be observed in starforming regions younger than ~10 myr. the large age dispersion is robustagainst variations in extinction (in the range e(b-v)=0-0.3 mag) and variationsin the upper end of the stellar initial mass function (imf). in particular, wedemonstrate that the age dispersion is insensitive to steepening of the imf, upto extreme slopes.

1103.4026	using h-alpha morphology and surface brightness fluctuations to age-date  star clusters in m83	we use new wfc3 observations of the nearby grand design spiral galaxy m83 todevelop two independent methods for estimating the ages of young star clusters.the first method uses the physical extent and morphology of halpha emission toestimate the ages of clusters younger than tau ~10 myr. it is based on thesimple premise that the gas in very young (tau &lt; few myr) clusters is largelycoincident with the cluster stars, is in a small, ring-like structuresurrounding the stars in slightly older clusters (e.g., tau ~5 myr), and is ina larger ring-like bubble for still older clusters (i.e., ~5-10 myr). thesecond method is based on an observed relation between pixel-to-pixel fluxvariations within clusters and their ages. this method relies on the fact thatthe brightest individual stars in a cluster are most prominent at ages around10 myr, and fall below the detection limit (i.e., m_v &lt; -3.5) for ages olderthan about 100 myr. these two methods are the basis for a new morphologicalclassification system which can be used to estimate the ages of star clustersbased on their appearance. we compare previous age estimates of clusters in m83determined from fitting ubvi halpha measurements using predictions from stellarevolutionary models with our new morphological categories and find goodagreement at the ~95% level. the scatter within categories is ~0.1 dex in logtau for young clusters (&lt;10 myr) and ~0.5 dex for older (&gt;10 myr) clusters. aby-product of this study is the identification of 22 "single-star" hii regionsin m83, with central stars having ages ~4 myr.

1104.4122	the super-linear slope of the spatially-resolved star formation law in  ngc 3521 and ngc 5194 (m51a)	we have conducted interferometric observations with carma and an otf mappingwith the 45-m telescope at nro in the co (j=1-0) emission line of ngc 3521.combining these new data, together with carma+nro45 data for m51a and archivalsings h$\alpha$, 24$\mu$m, things h i and galex fuv data for both galaxies, weinvestigate the empirical scaling law that connects the surface density of sfrand cold gas (the schmidt-kennicutt law) on a spatially-resolved basis. weargue that plausibly deriving sfr maps of nearby galaxies requires the diffusestellar/dust background emission to be carefully subtracted. an approach tocomplete this task is presented and applied in our pixel-by-pixel analysis onboth galaxies, showing that the controversial results whether the molecular s-klaw is super-linear or basically linear is a result of removing or preservingthe local background. in both galaxies, the power index of the molecular s-klaw is 1.5-1.9 at the highest available resolution (230 pc), and decreasesmonotonically for decreasing resolution; while the scatter (mainly intrinsic)increases as the resolution becomes higher, indicating a trend for which thes-k law breaks down below some scale. both quantities are systematically largerin m51a than in ngc 3521, but when plotted against the de-projected scale(\delta_{dp}), they become highly consistent between the two galaxies,tentatively suggesting that the sub-kpc molecular s-k law in spiral galaxiesdepends only on the considered scale, without varying amongst spiral galaxies.a logarithmic function \gamma_{h_2}=-1.1 log[\delta_{dp}/kpc]+1.4 and a linearrelation \sigma_{h_2}=-0.2 [\delta_{dp}/kpc]+0.7 are obtained through fittingto the m51a data, which describes both galaxies impressively well on sub-kpcscales. a larger sample of galaxies with better quality data are required totest the general applicability of these relations.

1106.4022	the emission by dust and stars of nearby galaxies in the herschel  kingfish survey	using new far-infrared imaging from the herschel space observatory withancillary data from ultraviolet to submillimeter wavelengths, we estimate thetotal emission from dust and stars of 62 nearby galaxies in the kingfish surveyin a way that is as empirical and model-independent as possible. we collect andexploit these data in order to measure from the spectral energy distributions(seds) precisely how much stellar radiation is intercepted and re-radiated bydust, and how this quantity varies with galaxy properties. by including spiredata, we are more sensitive to emission from cold dust grains than previousanalyses at shorter wavelengths, allowing for more accurate estimates of dusttemperatures and masses.  the dust/stellar flux ratio, which we measure by integrating the seds, has arange of nearly three decades. the inclusion of spire data shows that estimatesbased on data not reaching these far-ir wavelengths are biased low. we findthat the dust/stellar flux ratio varies with morphology and total irluminosity. we also find that dust/stellar flux ratios are related to gas-phasemetallicity, while the dust/stellar mass ratios are less so. the substantialscatter between dust/stellar flux and dust/stellar mass indicates that theformer is a poor proxy of the latter. comparing the dust/stellar flux ratiosand dust temperatures, we show that early-types tend to have slightly warmertemperatures than spiral galaxies, which may be due to more intenseinterstellar radiation fields, or to different dust grain compositions.finally, we show that early-types and early-type spirals have a strongcorrelation between the dust/stellar flux ratio and specific star formationrate, which suggests that the relatively bright far-ir emission of some ofthese galaxies is due to ongoing star formation and the radiation field fromolder stars.

1108.2837	dust-corrected star formation rates of galaxies. ii. combinations of  ultraviolet and infrared tracers	we present new calibrations of far-ultraviolet (fuv) attenuation as derivedfrom the total infrared to fuv luminosity ratio (irx) and the fuv-nuv color. wefind that the irx-corrected fuv luminosities are tightly and linearlycorrelated with the attenuation-corrected h\alpha\ luminosities (as measuredfrom the balmer decrement), with a rms scatter of $\pm 0.09$ dex. the ratios ofthese attenuation-corrected fuv to h\alpha\ luminosities are consistent withevolutionary synthesis model predictions, assuming a constant star formationrate over 100 myr, solar metallicity and either a salpeter or a kroupa imf withlower and upper mass limits of 0.1 and 100\msun. the irx-corrected fuv tobalmer-corrected h\alpha\ luminosity ratios do not show any trend with othergalactic properties over the ranges covered by our sample objects. in contrast,fuv attenuation derived from the fuv-nuv color (uv spectral slope) show muchlarger random and systematic uncertainties. when compared to eitherbalmer-corrected h\alpha\ luminosities or irx-corrected fuv luminosities thecolor-corrected fuv luminosities show $\sim 2.5$ times larger rms scatter, andsystematic nonlinear deviations as functions of luminosity and otherparameters. linear combinations of 25um and 1.4ghz radio continuum luminositieswith the observed fuv luminosities are also well correlated with thebalmer-corrected h\alpha\ luminosities. these results provide usefulprescriptions for deriving attenuation-corrected star formation rates ofgalaxies based on linear combinations of uv and ir or radio luminosities, whichare presented in convenient tabular form. comparisons of our calibrations withattenuation corrections in the literature and with dust attenuation laws arealso made.

1109.2905	modeling the effects of star formation histories on halpha and  ultra-violet fluxes in nearby dwarf galaxies	we consider the effects of non-constant star formation histories (sfhs) onhalpha and galex far ultra-violet (fuv) star formation rate (sfr) indicators.under the assumption of a fully populated chabrier imf, we compare thedistribution of halpha-to-fuv flux ratios from ~ 1500 simple, periodic modelsfhs with observations of 185 galaxies from the spitzer local volume legacysurvey. we find a set of sfh models that are well matched to the data, suchthat more massive galaxies are best characterized by nearly constant sfhs,while low mass systems experience bursts amplitudes of ~ 30 (i.e., an increasein the sfr by a factor of 30 over the sfr during the inter-burst period), burstdurations of tens of myr, and periods of ~ 250 myr; these sfhs are broadlyconsistent with the increased stochastic star formation expected in systemswith lower sfrs. we analyze the predicted temporal evolution of galaxy stellarmass, r-band surface brightness, halpha-derived sfr, and blue luminosity, andfind that they provide a reasonable match to observed flux distributions. wefind that our model sfhs are generally able to reproduce both the observedsystematic decline and increased scatter in halpha-to-fuv ratios toward lowmass systems, without invoking other physical mechanisms. we also compare ourpredictions with those from the integrated galactic imf theory with a constantsfr. we find that while both predict a systematic decline in the observedratios, only the time variable sfh models are capable of producing the observedpopulation of low mass galaxies ($m_{*}$ &lt; 10$^{7}$ msun) with normalhalpha-to-fuv ratios. these results demonstrate that a variable imf alone hasdifficulty explaining the observed scatter in the halpha-to-fuv ratios. weconclude by considering the limitations of the model sfhs, and discuss the useof additional empirical constraints to improve future sfh modeling efforts.

1204.5659	star formation laws: the effects of gas cloud sampling	recent observational results indicate that the functional shape of thespatially-resolved star formation-molecular gas density relation depends on thespatial scale considered. these results may indicate a fundamental role ofsampling effects on scales that are typically only a few times larger thanthose of the largest molecular clouds. to investigate the impact of thiseffect, we construct simple models for the distribution of molecular clouds ina typical star-forming spiral galaxy, and, assuming a power-law relationbetween sfr and cloud mass, explore a range of input parameters. we confirmthat the slope and the scatter of the simulated sfr-molecular gas surfacedensity relation depend on the size of the sub-galactic region considered, dueto stochastic sampling of the molecular cloud mass function, and the effect islarger for steeper relations between sfr and molecular gas. there is a generaltrend for all slope values to tend to ~unity for region sizes larger than 1-2kpc, irrespective of the input sfr-cloud relation. the region size of 1-2 kpccorresponds to the area where the cloud mass function becomes fully sampled. wequantify the effects of selection biases in data tracing the sfr, either asthresholds (i.e., clouds smaller than a given mass value do not form stars) orbackgrounds (e.g., diffuse emission unrelated to current star formation iscounted towards the sfr). apparently discordant observational results arebrought into agreement via this simple model, and the comparison of oursimulations with data for a few galaxies supports a steep (&gt;1) power law indexbetween sfr and molecular gas.

1204.6045	the resolved stellar population in 50 regions of m83 from hst/wfc3 early  release science observations	we present a multi-wavelength photometric study of ~15,000 resolved stars inthe nearby spiral galaxy m83 (ngc5236, d=4.61mpc) based on hubble spacetelescope wide field camera 3 observations using four filters: f336w, f438w,f555w, and f814w. we select 50 regions (an average size of 260 pc by 280 pc) inthe spiral arm and inter-arm areas of m83, and determine the age distributionof the luminous stellar populations in each region. this is accomplished bycorrecting for extinction towards each individual star by comparing its colorswith predictions from stellar isochrones. we compare the resulting luminosityweighted mean ages of the luminous stars in the 50 regions with thosedetermined from several independent methods, including the number ratio ofred-to-blue supergiants, morphological appearance of the regions, surfacebrightness fluctuations, and the ages of clusters in the regions. we findreasonably good agreement between these methods. we also find that young starsare much more likely to be found in concentrated aggregates along spiral arms,while older stars are more dispersed. these results are consistent with thescenario that star formation is associated with the spiral arms, and stars formprimarily in star clusters and then disperse on short timescales to form thefield population. the locations of wolf-rayet stars are found to correlate withthe positions of many of the youngest regions, providing additional support forour ability to accurately estimate ages. we address the effects of spatialresolution on the measured colors, magnitudes, and age estimates. whileindividual stars can occasionally show measurable differences in the colors andmagnitudes, the age estimates for entire regions are only slightly affected.

1205.6782	direct oxygen abundances for low luminosity lvl galaxies	we present mmt spectroscopic observations of hii regions in 42 low luminositygalaxies in the lvl. for 31 galaxies, we measured the temperature sensitive [oiii] line at a strength of 4 sigma or greater, and thus determine direct oxygenabundances. our results provide the first direct estimates of oxygen abundancefor 19 galaxies. oxygen abundances were compared to b-band and 4.5 micronluminosities and stellar masses in order to characterize theluminosity-metallicity (l-z) and mass-metallicity (m-z) relationships atlow-luminosity.  we present and analyze a "combined select" sample composed of 38 objects(drawn from our parent sample and the literature) with direct oxygen abundancesand reliable distance determinations (trgb or ceph). consistent with previousstudies, the b-band and 4.5 micron l-z relationships were found to be12+log(o/h)=(6.27+/-0.21)+(-0.11+/-0.01)m_b and12+log(o/h)=(6.10+/-0.21)+(-0.10+/-0.01)m_[4.5] (sigma=0.15 and 0.14). for thissample, we derive a m-z relationship of12+log(o/h)=(5.61+/-0.24)+(0.29+/-0.03)log(m*), which agrees with previousstudies; however, the dispersion (sigma=0.15) is not significantly lower thanthat of the l-z relationships. because of the low dispersions in theserelationships, if an accurate distance is available, the luminosity of alow-luminosity galaxy is often a better indicator of metallicity than thatderived using certain strong-line methods, so significant departures from thel-z relationships may indicate that caution is prudent in such cases. we alsorevisit the 70/160 micron color metallicity relationship.  additionally, we examine n/o abundance trends with respect to oxygenabundance and b-v color. we find a positive correlation between n/o ratio andb-v color for 0.05\lesssimb-v\lesssim0.75:log(n/o)=(1.18+/-0.9)x(b-v)+(-1.92+/-0.08), with a dispersion of sigma=0.14,that is in agreement with previous studies.

1209.4141	the history of star formation in galaxies	if we are to develop a comprehensive and predictive theory of galaxyformation and evolution, it is essential that we obtain an accurate assessmentof how and when galaxies assemble their stellar populations, and how thisassembly varies with environment. there is strong observational support for thehierarchical assembly of galaxies, but our insight into this assembly comesfrom sifting through the resolved field populations of the surviving galaxieswe see today, in order to reconstruct their star formation histories, chemicalevolution, and kinematics. to obtain the detailed distribution of stellar agesand metallicities over the entire life of a galaxy, one needs multi-bandphotometry reaching solar-luminosity main sequence stars. the hubble spacetelescope can obtain such data in the low-density regions of local groupgalaxies. to perform these essential studies for a fair sample of the localuniverse, we will require observational capabilities that allow us to extendthe study of resolved stellar populations to much larger galaxy samples thatspan the full range of galaxy morphologies, while also enabling the study ofthe more crowded regions of relatively nearby galaxies. with such capabilitiesin hand, we will reveal the detailed history of star formation and chemicalevolution in the universe.

1211.3332	quantifying non-star formation associated 8um dust emission in ngc 628	combining ha and irac images of the nearby spiral galaxy ngc 628, we findthat between 30-43% of its 8um dust emission is not related to recent starformation. contributions from dust heated by young stars are separated byidentifying hii regions in the ha map and using these areas as a mask todetermine the 8um dust emission that must be due to heating by older stars.corrections are made for sub-detection-threshold hii regions, photons escapingfrom hii regions and for young stars not directly associated to hii regions(i.e. 10-100 myr old stars). a simple model confirms this amount of 8umemission can be expected given dust and pah absorption cross-sections, arealistic star-formation history, and the observed optical extinction values. afourier power spectrum analysis indicates that the 8um dust emission is morediffuse than the ha emission (and similar to observed hi), supporting ouranalysis that much of the 8um-emitting dust is heated by older stars. the 8umdust-to-ha emission ratio declines with galactocentric radius both within andoutside of hii regions, probably due to a radial increase in disk transparency.in the course of this work, we have also found that intrinsic diffuse hafractions may be lower than previously thought in galaxies, if the differentialextinction between hii regions and diffuse regions is taken into account.

1305.6317	the pa{\alpha} luminosity function of hii regions in nearby galaxies  from hst/nicmos	the hii region luminosity function (lf) is an important tool for deriving thebirthrates and mass distribution of ob associations, and is an excellent tracerof the newly formed massive stars and associations. to date, extensive work(predominantly in h{\alpha}) has been done from the ground, which is hinderedby dust extinction and the severe blending of adjacent (spatially or inprojection) hii regions. reliably measuring the properties of hii regionsrequires a linear resolution &lt;40 pc, but analyses satisfying this requirementhave been done only in a handful of galaxies, so far. as the first space-basedwork using a galaxy sample, we have selected 12 galaxies from our hst nicmospa{\alpha} survey and studied the luminosity function and size distribution ofhii regions both in individual galaxies and cumulatively, using a virtuallyextinction-free tracer of the ionizing photon rate. the high angular resolutionand low sensitivity to diffuse emission of nicmos also offer an advantage overground-based imaging by enabling a higher degree of de-blending of the hiiregions. we do not confirm the broken power-law lfs found in ground-basedstudies. instead, we find that the lfs, both individual and co-added, follow asingle power law dn(l)/dlnl ~ l^-1, consistent with the mass function of starclusters in nearby galaxies, and in agreement with the results of the existinganalyses with hst data. the individual and co-added size distribution of hiiregions are both roughly consistent with dn(d)/dlnd ~ d^-3, but the power-lawscaling is probably contaminated by blended regions or complexes.

1307.1680	the nature of the second parameter in the irx-beta relation for local  galaxies	we present an analysis of 98 galaxies of low-dust content, selected from thespitzer local volume legacy survey, aimed at examining the relation between theultraviolet (uv) color, beta, and dust attenuation in normal star-forminggalaxies. the irx-beta diagram relates the total dust attenuation in a galaxy,traced by the far-ir (fir) to uv ratio, to the observed uv color, indicated bybeta. previous research has indicated that while starburst galaxies exhibit arelatively tight irx-beta relation, normal star-forming galaxies do not, andhave a much larger spread in the total-ir to far-uv (fuv) luminosity for afixed uv color. we examine the role that the age of the stellar populationplays as the "second parameter" responsible for the observed deviation andspread of star-forming galaxies from the starburst relation. we model the fuvto fir spectral energy distribution (sed) of each galaxy according to two broadbins of star formation history (sfh): constant and instantaneous burst. we findclear trends between stellar population mean age estimators(extinction-corrected fuv/nir, u-b, and ew(h-alpha)) and the uv color, beta;the trends are mostly driven by the galaxies best-described by instantaneousburst populations. we also find a significant correlation between beta and themean age directly determined from the best-fit instantaneous models. as alreadyindicated by other authors, the uv attenuation in star-forming galaxies may notbe recovered with the uv color alone and is highly influenced by the stellarpopulation's mean age and sfh. overall, the scatter in the irx-beta diagram isbetter correlated with beta than with the perpendicular distance.

1309.0520	constraining stellar feedback: shock-ionized gas in nearby starburst  galaxies	(abridged) we investigate the properties of feedback-driven shocks in 8nearby starburst galaxies using narrow-band imaging data from the hubble spacetelescope (hst). we identify the shock--ionized component via the linediagnostic diagram \oiii/\hb vs. \sii (or \nii)/\ha, applied to resolvedregions 3--15 pc in size. we divide our sample into three sub-samples:sub-solar (holmberg ii, ngc 1569, ngc 4214, ngc 4449, and ngc 5253), solar (he2-10, ngc 3077) and super-solar (ngc 5236) for consistent shock measurements.for the sub-solar sub-sample, we derive three scaling relations: (1) $l_{shock}\propto {sfr}^{~0.62}$, (2) $l_{shock} \propto {\sigma_{sfr,hl}}^{~0.92}$, and(3) $l_{shock}/l_{tot} \propto {(l_h/l_{\odot,h})}^{-0.65}$, where $l_{shock}$is the \ha luminosity from shock--ionized gas, ${\sigma_{sfr,hl}}$ the sfr perunit half-light area, $l_{tot}$ the total \ha luminosity, and $l_h/l_{\odot,h}$the absolute h-band luminosity from 2mass normalized to solar luminosity. theother two sub--samples do not have enough number statistics, but appear tofollow the first scaling relation. the energy recovered indicates that theshocks from stellar feedback in our sample galaxies are fully radiative. if thescaling relations are applicable in general to stellar feedback, our resultsare similar to those by hopkins et al. (2012) for galactic super winds. thissimilarity should, however, be taken with caution at this point, as theunderlying physics that enables the transition from radiative shocks to gasoutflows in galaxies is still poorly understood.

1310.0456	investigating the presence of 500 um submillimeter excess emission in  local star forming galaxies	submillimeter excess emission has been reported at 500 microns in a handfulof local galaxies, and previous studies suggest that it could be correlatedwith metal abundance. we investigate the presence of an excess submillimeteremission at 500 microns for a sample of 20 galaxies from the key insights onnearby galaxies: a far infrared survey with herschel (kingfish) that span arange of morphologies and metallicities (12+log(o/h)=7.8-8.7). we probe thefar-infrared (ir) emission using images from the spitzer space telescope andherschel space observatory in the wavelength range 24-500 microns. we model thefar-ir peak of the dust emission with a two-temperature modified blackbody andmeasure excess of the 500 micron photometry relative to that predicted by ourmodel. we compare the submillimeter excess, where present, with global galaxymetallicity and, where available, resolved metallicity measurements. we do notfind any correlation between the 500 micron excess and metallicity. a fewindividual sources do show excess (10-20%) at 500 microns; conversely, forother sources, the model overpredicts the measured 500 micron flux density byas much as 20%, creating a 500 micron "deficit". none of our sources has anexcess larger than the calculated 1-sigma uncertainty, leading us to concludethat there is no substantial excess at submillimeter wavelengths at or shorterthan 500 microns in our sample. our results differ from previous studiesdetecting 500 micron excess in kingfish galaxies largely due to new, improvedphotometry used in this study.

1311.0871	extinction and dust geometry in m83 hii regions: a hubble space  telescope/wfc3 study	we present hst/wfc3 narrow-band imaging of the starburst galaxy m83 targetingthe hydrogen recombination lines (h$\beta$, h$\alpha$ and pa$\beta$), which weuse to investigate the dust extinction in the hii regions. we derive extinctionmaps with 6 parsec spatial resolution from two combinations of hydrogen lines(h$\alpha$/h$\beta$ and h$\alpha$/pa$\beta$), and show that the longerwavelengths probe larger optical depths, with $a_v$ values larger by $\gtrsim$1mag than those derived from the shorter wavelengths. this difference leads to afactor $\gtrsim$2 discrepancy in the extinction-corrected h$\alpha$ luminosity,a significant effect when studying extragalactic hii regions. by comparingthese observations to a series of simple models, we conclude that a largediversity of absorber/emitter geometric configurations can account for thedata, implying a more complex physical structure than the classical foreground"dust screen" assumption. however, most data points are bracketed by theforeground screen and a model where dust and emitters are uniformly mixed. whenaveraged over large ($\gtrsim$100--200 pc) scales, the extinction becomesconsistent with a "dust screen", suggesting that other geometries tend to berestricted to more local scales. moreover, the extinction in any region can bedescribed by a combination of the foreground screen and the uniform mixturemodel with weights of 1/3 and 2/3 in the center ($\lesssim$2 kpc),respectively, and 2/3 and 1/3 for the rest of the disk. this simpleprescription significantly improves the accuracy of the dust extinctioncorrections and can be especially useful for pixel-based analyses of galaxiessimilar to m83.

1311.3665	quantitative method for the optimal subtraction of continuum emission  from narrow-band images : skewness transition analysis	we present an objective method to remove the stellar continuum emission fromnarrow-band images to derive emission-line images. the method is based on theskewness of the pixel histogram of the residual images. specifically, weexploit a transition in the skewness of the signal in the continuum-subtractedimage, which appears when the image changes from being under-subtracted toover-subtracted. tests on one-dimensional artificial images demonstrate thatthe transition identifies the optimal scaling factor {\mu} to be used on thebroad-band image ib in order to produce the optimal line-emission image ie,i.e., ie =in - {\mu} ib, with in the original (un-subtracted) narrow-bandimage. the advantage of this method is that it uses all information-bearingpixels in the final image, and not just a sub-set of those pixels (the latterbeing common in many traditional approaches to stellar continuum removal fromnarrow-band images). we apply our method to actual images, both fromground-based and space facilities, in particular to wfpc2 and acs images fromthe hubble space telescope, and we show that it is successful irrespective ofthe nature of the sources (point-like or extended). we also discuss the impacton the accuracy of the method of non-optimal images, such as those containingsaturated sources or non-uniform background, and present `workarounds' forthose problems.

1404.6001	hierarchical star formation in nearby legus galaxies	hierarchical structure in ultraviolet images of 12 late-type legus galaxiesis studied by determining the numbers and fluxes of nested regions as afunction of size from ~1 to ~200 pc, and the number as a function of flux. twostarburst dwarfs, ngc 1705 and ngc 5253, have steeper number-size and flux-sizedistributions than the others, indicating high fractions of the projected areasfilled with star formation. nine subregions in 7 galaxies have similarly steepnumber-size slopes, even when the whole galaxies have shallower slopes. theresults suggest that hierarchically structured star-forming regions severalhundred parsecs or larger represent common unit structures. small galaxiesdominated by only a few of these units tend to be starbursts. theself-similarity of young stellar structures down to parsec scales suggests thatstar clusters form in the densest parts of a turbulent medium that also formsloose stellar groupings on larger scales. the presence of super star clustersin two of our starburst dwarfs would follow from the observed structure ifcloud and stellar subregions more readily coalesce when self-gravity in theunit cell contributes more to the total gravitational potential.

1405.4872	untangling the nature of spatial variations of cold dust properties in  star forming galaxies	we investigate the far-infrared (ir) dust emission for 20 local star forminggalaxies from the key insights on nearby galaxies: a far-ir survey withherschel (kingfish) sample. we model the far-ir/submillimeter spectral energydistribution (sed) using images from spitzer space telescope and herschel spaceobservatory. we calculate the cold dust temperature (t(cold)) and emissivity(beta) on a pixel by pixel basis (where each pixel ranges from 0.1-3 kpc^2)using a two temperature modified blackbody fitting routine. our fitting methodallows us to investigate the resolved nature of temperature and emissivityvariations by modeling from the galaxy centers to the outskirts (physicalscales of ~15-50 kpc, depending on the size of the galaxy). we fit each sed intwo ways: (1) fit t(cold) and beta simultaneously, (2) hold beta constant andfit t(cold). we compare t(cold) and beta with star formation rates (calculatedfrom l(halpha) and l(24)), the luminosity of the old stellar population (tracedthrough l(3.6), and the dust mass surface density (traced by 500 micronluminosity, l(500)). we find a significant trend between sfr/l(500) andt(cold), implying that the flux of hard uv photons relative to the amount ofdust is significantly contributing to the heating of the cold, or diffuse, dustcomponent. we also see a trend between l(3.6)/l(500) and beta, indicating thatthe old stellar population contributes to the heating at far-ir/submillimeterwavelengths. finally, we find that when beta is held constant, t(cold) exhibitsa strongly decreasing radial trend, illustrating that the shape of the far-irsed is changing radially through a galaxy, thus confirming on a sample almostdouble in size the trends observed in galametz et al. (2012).

1406.1157	star cluster mass and age distributions of two fields in m83 based on  hst/wfc3 observations	we study star clusters in two fields in the nearby spiral galaxy m83 usingbroad and narrow band optical imaging taken with the wfc3 on-board hst. wepresent results based on several different catalogs of star clusters in aninner and outer field, and conclude that different methods of selection do notstrongly impact the results, particularly for clusters older than $\approx$10myr. the age distributions can be described by a power law, $dn/d\tau\propto\tau^{\gamma}$, with $\gamma\approx -$0.84$\pm$0.12 in the inner field,and $\gamma\approx -$0.48$\pm$0.12 in the outer field for $\tau\gtrsim$10 myr.we bracket the difference, $\delta \gamma$, between the two fields to be in therange 0.18$-$0.36, based on estimates of the relative star formation histories.the mass functions can also be described by a power law, $dn/dm\proptom^{\beta}$, with $\beta\approx -$1.98$\pm$0.14 and $\beta\approx $2.34$\pm$0.26in the inner and outer fields, respectively. we conclude that the shapes of themass and age distributions of the clusters in the two fields are similar, aspredicted by the "quasi-universal" model. any differences between the twofields are at the $\approx$2$-$3$\sigma (\approx$1$-$2$\sigma)$ level for theage (mass) distributions. therefore any dependence of these distributions onthe local environment is probably weak. we compare the shapes of thedistributions with those predicted by two popular cluster disruption models,and find that both show evidence that the clusters are disrupted at a rate thatis approximately independent of their mass, but that the observational resultsdo not support the earlier disruption of lower mass clusters relative to theirhigher mass counterparts.

1411.1065	early science with the large millimeter telescope: exploring the effect  of agn activity on the relationships between molecular gas, dust, and star  formation	the molecular gas, h$_2$, that fuels star formation in galaxies is difficultto observe directly. as such, the ratio of $l_{\rm ir}$ to $l^\prime_{\rm co}$is an observational estimation of the star formation rate compared with theamount of molecular gas available to form stars, which is related to the starformation efficiency and the inverse of the gas consumption timescale. we testwhat effect an ir luminous agn has on the ratio $l_{\rm ir}/l^\prime_{\rm co}$in a sample of 24 intermediate redshift galaxies from the 5 mjy unbiasedspitzer extragalactic survey (5muses). we obtain new co(1-0) observations withthe redshift search receiver on the large millimeter telescope. we diagnose thepresence and strength of an agn using spitzer irs spectroscopy. we find thatremoving the agn contribution to $l_{\rm ir}^{\rm tot}$ results in a mean$l_{\rm ir}^{\rm sf}/l^\prime_{\rm co}$ for our entire sample consistent withthe mean $l_{\rm ir}/l^\prime_{\rm co}$ derived for a large sample of starforming galaxies from $z\sim0-3$. we also include in our comparison therelative amount of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission for our sample anda literature sample of local and high redshift ultra luminous infrared galaxiesand find a consistent trend between $l_{6.2}/l_{\rm ir}^{\rm sf}$ and $l_{\rmir}^{\rm sf}/l^\prime_{\rm co}$, such that small dust grain emission decreaseswith increasing $l_{\rm ir}^{\rm sf}/l^\prime_{\rm co}$ for both local and highredshift dusty galaxies.

1411.2975	dust continuum emission as a tracer of gas mass in galaxies	we use a sample of 36 galaxies from the kingfish (herschel ir), heracles(iram co), and things (vla hi) surveys to study empirical relations betweenherschel infrared (ir) luminosities and the total mass of the interstellar gas(h2+hi). such a comparison provides a simple empirical relationship withoutintroducing the uncertainty of dust model fitting. we find tight correlations,and provide fits to these relations, between herschel luminosities and thetotal gas mass integrated over entire galaxies, with the tightest, almostlinear, correlation found for the longest wavelength data (spire500). however,we find that accounting for the gas-phase metallicity (affecting thedust-to-gas ratio) is crucial when applying these relations to low-mass, andpresumably high-redshift, galaxies. the molecular (h2) gas mass is found to bebetter correlated with the peak of the ir emission (e.g. pacs160), drivenmostly by the correlation of stellar mass and mean dust temperature. whenexamining these relations as a function of galactocentric radius we find thesame correlations, albeit with a larger scatter, up to a radius of 0.7 r_25(within which most of the galaxy's baryonic mass resides). however, beyond thisradius the same correlations no longer hold, with the gas mass (predominantlyhi) increasing relative to the infrared emission. the tight relations found forthe bulk of the galaxy's baryonic content suggest that the total gas masses ofdisk-like (non-merging) galaxies can be inferred from far-infrared continuummeasurements in situations where only the latter are available, e.g. in almacontinuum observations of high-redshift galaxies.

1510.02447	resolving ionisation and metallicity on parsec scales across mrk 71 with  hst-wfc3	blue compact dwarf (bcd) galaxies in the nearby universe provide a means forstudying feedback mechanisms and star-formation processes in low-metallicityenvironments in great detail. due to their vicinity, these local analogues toyoung galaxies are well suited for high-resolution studies that would beunfeasible for primordial galaxies in the high-redshift universe. here wepresent hst-wfc3 observations of one such bcd, mrk 71, one of the most powerfullocal starbursts known, in the light of [o ii], he ii, hb, [o iii], ha, and [sii]. at d=3.44 mpc, this extensive suite of emission line images enables us toexplore the chemical and physical conditions of mrk 71 on ~2 pc scales. usingthese high spatial-resolution observations, we use emission line diagnostics todistinguish ionisation mechanisms on a pixel-by-pixel basis and show thatdespite the previously reported hypersonic gas and super-bubble blow out, thegas in mrk 71 is photoionised, with no sign of shock-excited emission. usingstrong-line metallicity diagnostics, we present the first 'metallicity image'of a galaxy, revealing chemically inhomogeneity on scales of &lt;50 pc. weadditionally demonstrate that while chemical structure can be lost at largespatial scales, metallicity-diagnostics can break down on spatial scalessmaller than a hii region. heii emission line images are used to identify up tosix wolf-rayet stars in mrk 71, three of which lie on the edge of blow-outregion. this study not only demonstrates the benefits of high-resolutionspatially-resolved observations in assessing the effects of feedbackmechanisms, but also the limitations of fine spatial scales when employingemission-line diagnostics. both aspects are especially relevant as we enter theera of extremely large telescopes, when observing structure on ~10 pc scaleswill no longer be limited to the local universe.

astro-ph;0312385	the ionized gas in local starburst galaxies: global and small--scale  feedback from star formation	abridged: the small-- and intermediate--scale structure and the fraction ofthe ism ionized by non--radiative processes is investigated in a small sampleof four local starburst galaxies, imaged with the hst wfpc2. the samplecomprises three dwarf galaxies, ngc3077, ngc4214, and ngc5253, and one giantspiral, ngc5236 (m83). the galaxies span a range in metallicity, luminosity,and environment, enabling the investigation of non--radiative ionizationprocesses in a variety of galactic conditions. for this purpose, the fourgalaxies were imaged in the lines of h-beta(4861 a), [oiii](5007 a),h-alpha(6563 a), and [sii](6717,6731 a). the non--photoionized gas in thesegalaxies has been traced on scales ranging from a few tens of pc to a fewhundred pc, providing a full budget for this ionized gas component. using the`maximum starburst line' of kewley et al. (2001) to discriminate betweenphotoionized and non--photoionized gas, we find that in all four galaxiesnon--photoionization processes are responsible for a small fraction of thetotal h-alpha emission, at the level of 3%--4%. the starbursts in the threedwarf galaxies deposit a significant fraction, 70%-100%, of their mechanicalenergy into the surrounding interstellar medium and require time--extended (afew x 10^7 yr to ~10^8 yr) star formation, in order to account for the observedluminosity of the non--photoionized gas. in the massive spiral, thenon--photoionized gas is concentrated in localized areas surrounded by activestar--formation, with no evidence for extended structures (as those in thedwarfs). this confirms the picture that starbursts remain confined events inmassive galaxies, likely due to the deep potential well.

astro-ph;0508025	spitzer observations of the supergiant shell region in ic 2574	we present spatially resolved spitzer imaging of the supergiant shell regionof the m81 group dwarf galaxy ic 2574 obtained as part of the spitzer infrarednearby galaxies survey. this region harbors one of the best nearby examples ofa kinematically distinct hi shell, with an associated remnant stellar cluster;the shell is initiating sequential star formation as it interacts with thesurrounding interstellar medium. this region dominates the infrared luminosityof ic 2574 and is spatially resolved in all spitzer imaging bands. we study thedifferences in dust temperature as a function of local environment and comparelocal star formation rates as inferred from h alpha and total infraredluminosities. we find that the strong h alpha sources are associated withregions of warm dust; however, the most luminous infrared and h alpha sourcesare not necessarilyco-spatial. the coolest dust is found in the regionsfarthest from the rim of the shell; these regions show the best agreementbetween star formation rates derived from h alpha and from total infraredluminosities (although discrepancies at the factor of 3-4 level still exist).there is considerable variation in the radio-far infrared correlation indifferent regions surrounding the shell. the low dust content of the region mayinfluence the scatter seen in these relations; these data demonstrate that theexpanding shell is dramatically affecting its surroundings by triggering starformation and altering the dust temperature.

astro-ph;0604604	warm dust and spatially variable pah emission in the dwarf starburst  galaxy ngc 1705	we present spitzer observations of the dwarf starburst galaxy ngc 1705obtained as part of sings. the galaxy morphology is very different shortwardand longward of ~5 microns: short-wavelength imaging shows an underlying redstellar population, with the central super star cluster (ssc) dominating theluminosity; longer-wavelength data reveals warm dust emission arising from twooff-nuclear regions offset by ~250 pc from the ssc. these regions show littleextinction at optical wavelengths. the galaxy has a relatively low global dustmass (~2e5 solar masses, implying a global dust-to-gas mass ratio ~2--4 timeslower than the milky way average). the off-nuclear dust emission appears to bepowered by photons from the same stellar population responsible for theexcitation of the observed h alpha emission; these photons are unassociatedwith the ssc (though a contribution from embedded sources to the ir luminosityof the off-nuclear regions cannot be ruled out). low-resolution irsspectroscopy shows moderate-strength pah emission in the 11.3 micron band inthe eastern peak; no pah emission is detected in the ssc or the western dustemission complex. there is significant diffuse 8 micron emission after scalingand subtracting shorter wavelength data; the spatially variable pah emissionstrengths revealed by the irs data suggest caution in the interpretation ofdiffuse 8 micron emission as arising from pah carriers alone. the metallicityof ngc 1705 falls at the transition level of 35% solar found by engelbracht andcollaborators; the fact that a system at this metallicity shows spatiallyvariable pah emission demonstrates the complexity of interpreting diffuse 8micron emission. a radio continuum non-detection, ngc 1705 deviatessignificantly from the canonical far-ir vs. radio correlation.

astro-ph;0605605	ultraviolet through far-infrared spatially resolved analysis of the  recent star formation in m81 (ngc3031)	the recent star formation (sf) in the early-type spiral galaxy m81 ischaracterized using imaging observations from the far-ultraviolet (uv) to thefar-infrared (ir). we compare these data with models of the stellar, gas, anddust emission for sub-galactic regions. our results suggest the existence of adiffuse dust emission not directly linked to the recent sf. we find a radialdecrease of the dust temperature and dust mass density, and in the attenuationof the stellar light. the ir emission in m81 can be modeled with threecomponents: 1) cold dust with a temperature &lt;t_c&gt;=18+-2 k, concentrated nearthe hii regions but also presenting a diffuse distribution; 2) warm dust witht_w=53+-7 k, directly linked with the hii regions; and 3) aromatic molecules,with diffuse morphology peaking around the hii regions. we derive severalrelationships to obtain total ir luminosities from ir monochromatic fluxes, andwe compare five different star formation rate (sfr) estimators for hii regionsin m81 and m51: the uv, halpha, and three estimators based on spitzer data. wefind that the halpha luminosity absorbed by dust correlates tightly with the 24microns emission. the correlation with the total ir luminosity is not as good.important variations from galaxy to galaxy are found when estimating the totalsfr with the 24 microns or the total ir emission alone. the most reliableestimations of the total sfrs are obtained by combining the halpha emission (orthe uv) and an ir luminosity (especially the 24 microns emission), which probethe unobscured and obscured sf, respectively. for the entire m81 galaxy, about50% of the total sf is obscured by dust. the percentage of obscured sf rangesfrom 60% in the inner regions of the galaxy to 30% in the outer zones.

astro-ph;0607669	the spectral energy distribution of dust emission in the edge-on spiral  galaxy ngc 4631 as seen with spitzer and jcmt	we explore the nature of variations in dust emission within an individualgalaxy using 3.6 - 160 micron spitzer space telescope observations and 450 and850 micron james clerk maxwell telescope observations of the edge-on sd spiralgalaxy ngc 4631 with the goals of understanding the relation between polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbons (pah) and dust emission, studying the variations in thecolors of the dust emission, and searching for possible excess submillimeteremission compared to what is anticipated based on dust models applied to themid- and far-infrared data. pah emission at 8 micron is found to correlate bestwith hot dust emission at 24 micron on kiloparsec scales, although the relationbreaks down on scales equal to hundreds of parsecs, possibly because ofdifferences in the mean free paths between the photons that excite the pahs andheat the dust and possibly because the pahs are destroyed by the hard radiationfields in the centers of some star formation regions. the ratio of 8 micron pahemission to 160 micron cool dust emission appears to be a function of radius.the 70/160 and 160/450 micron flux density ratios are remarkably constant eventhough the surface brightness varies by a factor of 25 in each wave band, whichsuggests that the emission is from dust heated by a nearly-uniform radiationfield. globally, we find an excess of 850 micron emission relative to whatwould be predicted by dust models. the 850 micron excess is highest in regionswith low 160 micron surface brightness, although the strength and statisticalsignificance of this result depends on the model fit to the data. we rule outvariable emissivity functions or ~4 k dust as the possible origins of this 850micron emission, but we do discuss the other possible mechanisms that couldproduce the emission.

astro-ph;0608249	the nature of infrared emission in the local group dwarf galaxy ngc 6822  as revealed by spitzer	we present spitzer imaging of the metal-deficient (z ~30% z_sun) local groupdwarf galaxy ngc 6822. on spatial scales of ~130 pc, we study the nature of ir,h alpha, hi, and radio continuum emission. nebular emission strength correlateswith ir surface brightness; however, roughly half of the ir emission isassociated with diffuse regions not luminous at h alpha (as found in previousstudies). the global ratio of dust to hi gas in the ism, while uncertain at thefactor of ~2 level, is ~25 times lower than the global values derived forspiral galaxies using similar modeling techniques; localized ratios of dust tohi gas are about a factor of five higher than the global value in ngc 6822.there are strong variations (factors of ~10) in the relative ratios of h alphaand ir flux throughout the central disk; the low dust content of ngc 6822 islikely responsible for the different h alpha/ir ratios compared to those foundin more metal-rich environments. the h alpha and ir emission is associated withhigh-column density (&gt; ~1e21 cm^-2) neutral gas. increases in ir surfacebrightness appear to be affected by both increased radiation field strength andincreased local gas density. individual regions and the galaxy as a whole fallwithin the observed scatter of recent high-resolution studies of the radio-farir correlation in nearby spiral galaxies; this is likely the result of depletedradio and far-ir emission strengths in the ism of this dwarf galaxy.

astro-ph;0610798	catching dissolving clusters: a new approach	traditional studies of stellar clusters in external galaxies use surfacephotometry and therefore focus on systems that are still bright and compactenough to be separated from the stellar background. consequently, the latterstages of unbound cluster evolution are still poorly understood. thisdramatically constrains our knowledge of the dissolution processes of stellarclusters in various physical environments.  we present the first results of a new approach to directly detect andquantify the characteristics of evolved stellar clusters. using the exceptionalspatial resolution and sensitivity of hst/acs images to resolve the stellarcontent nearby galaxies, we construct colour-magnitude diagrams for theobserved fields. this enable us to separate the younger population likelypresent in young clusters from the older stellar content of the star fieldbackground. we utilize a clustering algorithm to assign each star to a groupbased on its local spatial density. this novel approach makes use of algorithmstypically applied in n-body and cosmological studies. we test the method andshow that it successfully detects less compact clusters that would normally belost in the star field background. we also detect b-type stars well spread inthe galaxy disk of ngc 1313, probably the result of infant mortality of stellarclusters.

astro-ph;0702547	stellar clusters in ngc 1313: evidence for infant mortality	we present evidence that infant mortality of stellar clusters is likely to bea major and very efficient process for the dissolution of young clusters in thespiral galaxy ngc 1313. performing stellar psf photometry on archival hst/acsimages of the galaxy, we find that a large fraction of early b-type stars areseen outside of star clusters and well spread within the galactic disk,consistent with the scenario of infant mortality. we also calculate the uv fluxproduced by the stars in and out the clusters and find that 75 to 90% of the uvflux in ngc 1313 is produced by stars outside the clusters. these resultssuggest that the infant mortality of star clusters is probably the underlyingcause of the diffuse uv emission in starburst galaxies. infant mortality wouldalso explain the numerous b-type stars observed in the background field of ourgalaxy as well. we exclude the possibility that unresolved low-mass starclusters and scaled ob associations might be the main source for the diffuse uvemission.

astro-ph;9610184	reddening and star formation in starburst galaxies	the reddening properties and the star formation history of a sample of 19starburst galaxies are investigated using multiwavelength spectroscopy andinfrared broad band photometry. the difference in reddening between the ionizedgas and the stars is explained as difference in the covering factors of thedust in front of the gas and of the stars. a ``template starburst spectrum'',derived by combining the reddening-corrected uv, optical, and infrared data ofall the galaxies in the sample, is used to investigate the star formationhistory. spectral synthesis models indicate that the observed uv emission canbe attributed to a stellar population which is undergoing active star formationat a constant rate since ~ 20 myr, in agreement with the supernova ratesderived from the [feii] emission line in the infrared. at least two, andprobably more, intermediate age populations (age &lt; 2 gyr) contribute to theoptical and infrared emission, while populations older than 2 gyr do notcontribute significantly to the template. episodic star formation over the lastgyr is suggested, with star formation rates as large as or larger than thepresent rates. the synthetic stellar populations are generated according to aninitial mass function (imf) with salpeter slope (alpha=2.35) in the mass range0.1--100 solar masses, and reproduce a number of observational constraints,such as the spectral energy distribution of the template spectrum, theequivalent width of the atomic hydrogen emission lines, and the mass-to-lightratios; the data, then, do not provide indication for a high-mass-startruncated or a low-mass-star deficient imf in starburst galaxies.

astro-ph;9711302	chemical abundance calibrations for the narrow-line-region of active  galaxies	we investigate two chemical abundance calibrations for the narrow-line-region(nlr) of active galaxies in terms of three easily observable opticalemission-line ratios, namely, [oiii]$\lambda\lambda$4959,5007/h$\beta$,[nii]$\lambda\lambda$6548,84/h$\alpha$ and[oii]$\lambda3727/$[oiii]$\lambda\lambda$4959,5007. the calibrations areobtained from a grid of models on the assumption that the main processresponsible for the production of these lines is photoionization by a``typical'' active galactic nucleus continuum. the chemical elements vary theirabundance together with oxygen, except nitrogen, which is assumed to be aproduct of secondary nucleosynthesis. the calibrations are calculated for therange $8.4 \le 12+log(o/h) \le 9.4$, and tested using nlr data for a sample ofseyfert's and liner's having hii regions in the vicinity of the nucleus. thegaseous abundances of these hii regions have been determined in previous works,and the nlr abundances are obtained on the assumption that they can beextrapolated from those of the hii regions. the calibrations work very well forthe seyfert's, giving abundance values which agree with those obtained from thehii regions, and can thus be used for quick estimates of the chemicalabundances of the nlr's. for the liner's, the calibrations give lower valuesthan those derived from the corresponding hii regions, suggesting that theassumptions of the models do not apply for them, and that there are differentphysical processes at work in the nlr of the liner's.

astro-ph;9806001	the opacity of nearby galaxies from colors and counts of background  galaxies: i. the synthetic field method and its application to ngc 4536 and  ngc 3664	we describe a new, direct method for determining the opacity of foregroundgalaxies which does not require any a priori assumptions about the spatialdistribution or the reddening law of the obscuring material. the method is tomeasure the colors and counts of background galaxies which can be identifiedthrough the foreground system. the method is calibrated, and the effects ofconfusion and obscuration are decoupled by adding various versions of asuitable deep reference frame containing only field galaxies with knownproperties into the image of the foreground galaxy, and analyzing these``synthetic field'' images in the same way as the real images. we test themethod on hst wfpc2 archived images of two galaxies which are quite different:ngc 4536 is a large sc spiral, and ngc 3664 is a small magellanic irregular.the reference frames are taken from the hubble deep field.  from the background galaxy counts, ngc 4536 shows an extinction a_i ~ 1 magin the northwestern arm region, and lower than 0.5 mag in the correspondinginterarm region (no correction for inclination has been attempted). however,from the galaxy colors, the same reddening of e(v - i) ~ 0.2 is observed inboth the arm and the interarm regions. in the interarm region, the combinationof extinction and reddening can be explained by a diffuse component with agalactic reddening law (r_v ~ 3). in the spiral arm, however, the same diffuse,low opacity component seems to coexist with regions of much higher opacity.since the exposures are shorter the results for ngc 3664 are less clear, butalso appear to be consistent with a two component distribution.

astro-ph;9903054	dust absorption and the ultraviolet luminosity density at z \approx 3 as  calibrated by local starburst galaxies	we refine a technique to measure the absorption corrected ultraviolet (uv)luminosity of starburst galaxies using rest frame uv quantities alone, andapply it to u-dropouts at z ~ 3 found in the hubble deep field. the method isbased on an observed correlation between the ratio of far infrared (fir) to uvfluxes with spectral slope \beta (a uv color). a simple fit to this relationallows the uv flux absorbed by dust to be calculated, and hence the dust-freeuv luminosity to be determined. iue spectra and iras fluxes of local starburstsare used to calibrate the ratio in terms of 1600 angstrom absorption a_{1600},and the transformation from broad band color to \beta. we show that the recentmarginal and non-detections of hdf u-dropouts in the radio and sub-mm areconsistent with our calculated a_{1600}. this is also true of observations ofthe ratio of optical emission line flux to uv flux density in the brightestu-dropouts. this latter ratio turns out not to be a good indicator of dustextinction. in u-dropouts, absolute magnitude correlates with \beta: brightergalaxies are redder, as is observed in local starburst galaxies. this suggeststhat a mass-metallicity relationship is in place by z ~ 3. the uv luminosityfunction of u-dropouts extends up to m_{1600,0} ~ -24 abmag corresponding to astar formation rate ~ 200 \msun/yr (h_0 = 50 km/s/mpc, q_0 = 0.5). theabsorption-corrected uv luminosity density at z ~ 3 is \rho_{1600,0} =&gt;1.4x10^{27} erg/s/hz/mpc^3; still a lower limit since completeness correctionshave not been done and because only galaxies with a_{1600} &lt; ~3.6 mag are blueenough to be selected as u-dropouts. the luminosity weighted mean dustabsorption factor of our sample is 5.4 +/- 0.9$ at 1600\aa (abridged).
