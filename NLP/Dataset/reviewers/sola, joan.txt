hep-ph;9502317	the quantum correlation r_b-r_c in the mssm: more hints of  supersymmetry?	we study the correlation of quantum effects on the ratios r_b and r_c withinthe framework of the mssm. while in the sm the quantity r_b is in discrepancywith experiment at the 2 \sigma level from below, and r_c differs from theexperimental result at the 1.5 \sigma level from above, the theoreticalprediction for both observables could simultaneously improve in the mssm,provided that \tan\beta is large enough (\tan\beta\sim m_t/m_b) and thereexists a light supersymmetric pseudoscalar higgs, and also a light stop and alight chargino, all of them in the 50 gev ballpark. in view of the massespredicted for these susy particles, persistence of the `r_b-r_c crisis' in thenext run of experiments would not only suggest indirect evidence of susy, butshould also encourage direct finding of susy at lep 200. we also point out theconsistency of this picture with other observables and the intriguingpossibility that this z-physics scenario might allow getting a hint of susy attevatron through the simple observation of t\to h^{+}b.

hep-ph;9607485	quantum effects on $t\to h^{+} b$ in the mssm: a window to ``virtual''  supersymmetry?	we analyze the one-loop effects (strong and electroweak) on theunconventional top quark decay mode $t\rightarrow h^{+}  b$ within the mssm.the results are presented in the on-shell renormalization scheme with aphysically well motivated definition of $\tan\beta$. the study of this processat the quantum level is useful to unravel the potential supersymmetric natureof the charged higgs emerging from that decay. as compared with the standardmode $t\rightarrow w^{+} b$, the corrections to $t\rightarrow h^{+}  b$ arelarge, slowly decoupling and persist at a sizeable level even for all sparticlemasses well above the lep 200 discovery range. as a matter of fact, thepotential size of the susy effects, which amount to corrections of several tenpercent, could counterbalance the standard qcd corrections and even make themto appear with the ``wrong'' sign. therefore, if the charged higgs decay of thetop quark is kinematically allowed -a possibility which is not excluded by therecent measurements of the branching ratio $br(t\rightarrow w^{+} b)$ at thetevatron - it could be an invaluable laboratory to search for ``virtual''supersymmetry. while a first significant test of these effects could possiblybe performed at the upgraded tevatron, a more precise verification would mostlikely be carried out in future experiments at the lhc.

hep-ph;9702390	top and higgs decays: looking for quantum susy signatures in hadron  colliders	i present an updated discussion of the one-loop corrections to the standardtop quark decay, t-&gt; w^+ b, and to the charged higgs mode, t-&gt; h^+ b, withinthe framework of the mssm. these higher order contributions to the top widthare compared with the direct top decays into 2 and 3 real susy particles. itturns out that whereas the susy effects on t-&gt; w^+ b add up to those fromstandard qcd, they tend most likely to erase the conventional qcd correctionsto t-&gt; h+ b. however, in the latter case the full (strong plus electroweak)susy quantum effects are generally so large that the qcd correctionseffectively come out with the ``wrong sign''. a qualitatively distinct, andquantitatively significant, ``quantum signature'' of that type might constitutea most sought-after imprint of ``virtual'' supersymmetry, which remainssizeable enough even in the absence of any direct top decay into susyparticles. similar considerations are made for the hadronic partial widths ofthe higgs bosons of the mssm. while a first valuable test of these effectscould possibly be performed at the upgraded tevatron, a more preciseverification would most probably be carried out in future experiments at thelhc.

hep-ph;9910462	on the scaling behavior of the cosmological constant and the possible  existence of new forces and new light degrees of freedom	a large value of the cosmological constant (cc) is induced in the standardmodel (sm) of elementary particle physics because of spontaneous symmetrybreaking. to provide a small value of the observable cc one has to introducethe vacuum term which cancels the induced one at some point in the very farinfrared cosmic scale. starting from this point we investigate whether thecancellation is preserved at different energy scales. we find that the runningof the higgs mass, couplings and the vacuum term inevitably result in a scalingdependence of the observable cc value. as a consequence one meets a nonzero ccat an energy scale comparable to the typical electron neutrino mass suggestedby some experiments, and the order of magnitude of this constant is roughly theone derived from recent supernovae observations. however the sign of it isnegative -- opposite to what is suggested by these observations. thisdiscrepancy may be a hint of the existence of an extra very light scalar,perhaps a cosmon-like dilaton, which should essentially decouple from the smlagrangian, but that it nevertheless could mediate new macroscopic forces inthe submillimeter range.

0902.2215	relaxing a large cosmological constant	the cosmological constant (cc) problem is the biggest enigma of theoreticalphysics ever. in recent times, it has been rephrased as the dark energy problemin order to encompass a wider spectrum of possibilities. it is, in any case, apolyhedric puzzle with many faces, including the cosmic coincidence problem,i.e. why the density of matter is presently so close to the cc density.however, the oldest, toughest and most intriguing face of this polyhedron isthe big cc problem, namely why the measured value of the cc at present is sosmall as compared to any typical density scale existing in high energy physics,especially taking into account the many phase transitions that our universe hasundergone since the early times, including inflation. in this letter, wepropose to extend the field equations of general relativity by including aclass of invariant terms that automatically relax the value of the ccirrespective of the initial size of the vacuum energy in the early epochs. weshow that, at late times, the universe enters an eternal de sitter stagemimicking a tiny positive cosmological constant. thus, these models could solvethe big cc problem and have also a bearing on the cosmic coincidence problem.remarkably, they mimic the lcdm model to a large extent, but they still leavesome characteristic imprints that should be testable in the next generation ofexperiments.

0903.4978	single higgs-boson production through gamma-gamma scattering within the  general 2hdm	the production of a single neutral higgs boson h through (loop-induced)gamma-gamma collisions is explored in the context of the linear colliderswithin the general two-higgs-doublet model (2hdm). two different mechanisms areanalyzed: on the one hand, the scattering gamma gamma-&gt; h of two real photonsin a gamma-gamma collider; on the other, the more traditional mechanism ofvirtual photon fusion, e+e- --&gt;e+e- + h. owing to the peculiar properties ofthe higgs boson self-interactions within the general 2hdm, we find that theoverall production rates can be boosted up significantly, provided the chargedhiggs mass is not too heavy. for example, if the latter is slightly above 100gev and, in addition, the lightest cp-even higgs boson falls in the ballpark ofthe lep bound on the sm higgs mass up to a few hundred gev, the cross-sectionsmay typically render \sigma(gamma gamma-&gt; h)= 0.1-1 pb and \sigma(e+e- --&gt; e+e-+ h)\sim 0.01 pb -- in both cases well above the sm prediction. although forcharged higgs masses above 300 gev the rates become virtually insensitive tothe higgs boson self-couplings, a significant tail of non-sm effects producedby the combined contribution of the yukawa couplings and gauge bosons couldstill reveal a smoking gun.

0910.4925	on the possible running of the cosmological "constant"	despite the many outstanding cosmological observations leading to a strongevidence for a nonvanishing cosmological constant (cc) term in thegravitational field equations, the theoretical status of this quantity seems tobe lagging well behind the observational successes. it thus seems timely torevisit some fundamental aspects of the cc term in quantum field theory (qft).we emphasize that, in curved space-time, nothing a priori prevents this termfrom potentially having a mild running behavior associated to quantum effects.remarkably, this could be the very origin of the dynamical nature of the darkenergy, in contrast to many other popular options considered in the literature.in discussing this possibility, we also address some recent criticismsconcerning the possibility of such running. our conclusion is that, while thereis no comprehensive proof of the cc running, there is no proof of thenon-running either. the problem can be solved only through a deeperunderstanding of the vacuum contributions of massive quantum fields on a curvedspacetime background. we suggest that such investigations are at the heart ofone of the most important endeavors of fundamental theoretical cosmology in theyears to come.

0912.0677	the relaxed universe: towards solving the cosmological constant problem  dynamically from an effective action functional of gravity	we present an unconventional approach for addressing the old cosmologicalconstant (cc) problem in a class of f(r,g) models of modified gravity. for a ccof arbitrary size and sign the corresponding cosmological evolution follows anexpansion history which strikingly resembles that of our real universe. theeffects of the large cc are relaxed dynamically and there is no fine-tuning atany stage. in addition, the relaxation mechanism alleviates the coincidenceproblem. the upshot is that a large cosmological constant and the observedcosmic expansion history coexist peacefully in the relaxed universe. this modeluniverse can be thought of as an interesting preliminary solution of thecosmological constant problem, in the sense that it provides a successfuldynamical mechanism able to completely avoid the fine-tuning problem (thetoughest aspect of the cc problem). however, since the relaxed universe isformulated within the context of modified gravity, it may still suffer of someof the known issues associated with these theories, and therefore it can beviewed only as a toy-model proposal towards a final solution of the cc problem.

0707.3162	triple higgs boson production in the linear collider	triple higgs boson production (3h) may provide essential information toreconstruct the higgs potential. we consider 3h-production in the internationallinear collider (ilc) both in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (mssm)and in the general two-higgs-doublet model (2hdm). we compute the totalcross-section for the various 3h final states, such as h^+ h^- h^0, h^0 a^0h^0, etc. and compare with the more traditional double higgs (2h) bosonproduction processes. while the cross-sections for the 2h final states liewithin the same order of magnitude in both the mssm and 2hdm, we find that forthe 3h states the maximum 2hdm cross-sections, being of order 0.1 pb, are muchlarger than the mssm ones which in most cases are of order 10^{-6} pb or less.actually, the 3h processes could be the dominant mechanism for higgs bosonproduction in the 2hdm. ultimately the origin of the remarkable enhancement ofthe 3h channels in the 2hdm case (for both type i and type ii models)originates in the structure of the trilinear higgs boson couplings. theextremely clean environment of the ilc should allow a relatively comfortabletagging of the three higgs boson events. in view of the fact that the mssmcontribution is negligible, these events should manifest themselves mainly inthe form of 6 heavy-quark jet final states. some of these signatures could bespectacular, and in case of being detected would constitute strong evidence ofan extended higgs sector of non-supersymmetric origin.

1006.3944	dynamically avoiding fine-tuning the cosmological constant: the "relaxed  universe"	we demonstrate that there exists a large class of action functionals of thescalar curvature and of the gauss-bonnet invariant which are able to relaxdynamically a large cosmological constant (cc), whatever it be its startingvalue in the early universe. hence, it is possible to understand, withoutfine-tuning, the very small current value of the cc as compared to itstheoretically expected large value in quantum field theory and string theory.in our framework, this relaxation appears as a pure gravitational effect, whereno ad hoc scalar fields are needed. the action involves a positive power of acharacteristic mass parameter, m, whose value can be, interestingly enough, ofthe order of a typical particle physics mass of the standard model of thestrong and electroweak interactions or extensions thereof, including theneutrino mass. the model universe emerging from this scenario (the "relaxeduniverse") falls within the class of the so-called lxcdm models of the cosmicevolution. therefore, there is a "cosmon" entity x (represented by an effectiveobject, not a field), which in this case is generated by the effectivefunctional and is responsible for the dynamical adjustment of the cosmologicalconstant. this model universe successfully mimics the essential past epochs ofthe standard (or "concordance") cosmological model (lcdm). furthermore, itprovides interesting clues to the coincidence problem and it may even connectnaturally with primordial inflation.

0709.2130	effective growth of matter density fluctuations in the running lcdm and  lxcdm models	we investigate the matter density fluctuations \delta\rho/\rho for two darkenergy (de) models in the literature in which the cosmological term \lambda isa running parameter. in the first model, the running lcdm model, matter and deexchange energy, whereas in the second model, the lxcdm model, the total de andmatter components are conserved separately. the lxcdm model was proposed as aninteresting solution to the cosmic coincidence problem. it includes an extradynamical component, the "cosmon" x, which interacts with the running \lambda,but not with matter. in our analysis we make use of the current value of thelinear bias parameter, b^2(0)= p_{gg}/p_{mm}, where p_{mm} ~(\delta\rho/\rho)^2 is the present matter power spectrum and p_{gg} is thegalaxy fluctuation power spectrum. the former can be computed within a givenmodel, and the latter is found from the observed lss data (at small z) obtainedby the 2df galaxy redshift survey. it is found that b^2(0)=1 within a 10%accuracy for the standard lcdm model. adopting this limit for any de model andusing a method based on the effective equation of state for the de, we can seta limit on the growth of matter density perturbations for the running lcdmmodel, the solution of which is known. this provides a good test of theprocedure, which we then apply to the lxcdm model in order to determine thephysical region of parameter space, compatible with the lss data. in thisregion, the lxcdm model is consistent with known observations and provides atthe same time a viable solution to the cosmic coincidence problem.

1102.1815	cosmologies with a time dependent vacuum	the idea that the cosmological term, lambda, should be a time dependentquantity in cosmology is a most natural one. it is difficult to conceive anexpanding universe with a strictly constant vacuum energy density, namely onethat has remained immutable since the origin of time. a smoothly evolvingvacuum energy density that inherits its time-dependence from cosmologicalfunctions, such as the hubble rate or the scale factor, is not only aqualitatively more plausible and intuitive idea, but is also suggested byfundamental physics, in particular by quantum field theory (qft) in curvedspace-time. to implement this notion, is not strictly necessary to resort to adhoc scalar fields, as usually done in the literature (e.g. in quintessenceformulations and the like). a "running" lambda term can be expected on verysimilar grounds as one expects (and observes) the running of couplings andmasses with a physical energy scale in qft. furthermore, the experimentalevidence that the equation of state of the dark energy could be evolving withtime/redshift (including the possibility that it might currently behavephantom-like) suggests that a time-variable lambda term (possibly accompaniedby a variable newton's gravitational coupling g=g(t)) could account in anatural way for all these features. remarkably enough, a class of these models(the "new cosmon") could even be the clue for solving the old cosmologicalconstant problem, including the coincidence problem.

1103.4632	hubble expansion and structure formation in the "running flrw model" of  the cosmic evolution	a new class of flrw cosmological models with time-evolving fundamentalparameters should emerge naturally from a description of the expansion of theuniverse based on the first principles of quantum field theory and stringtheory. within this general paradigm, one expects that both the gravitationalnewton's coupling, g, and the cosmological term, lambda, should not be strictlyconstant but appear rather as smooth functions of the hubble rate. thisscenario ("running flrw model") predicts, in a natural way, the existence ofdynamical dark energy without invoking the participation of extraneous scalarfields. in this paper, we perform a detailed study of these models in the lightof the latest cosmological data, which serves to illustrate thephenomenological viability of the new dark energy paradigm as a seriousalternative to the traditional scalar field approaches. by performing a jointlikelihood analysis of the recent snia data, the cmb shift parameter, and thebaos traced by the sloan digital sky survey, we put tight constraints on themain cosmological parameters. furthermore, we derive the theoreticallypredicted dark-matter halo mass function and the corresponding redshiftdistribution of cluster-size halos for the "running" models studied. despitethe fact that these models closely reproduce the standard lcdm hubbleexpansion, their normalization of the perturbation's power-spectrum varies,imposing, in many cases, a significantly different cluster-size halo redshiftdistribution. this fact indicates that it should be relatively easy todistinguish between the "running" models and the lcdm cosmology using realisticfuture x-ray and sunyaev-zeldovich cluster surveys.

1109.4739	confronting the relaxation mechanism for a large cosmological constant  with observations	in order to deal with a large cosmological constant a relaxation mechanismbased on modified gravity has been proposed recently. by virtue of thismechanism the effect of the vacuum energy density of a given quantumfield/string theory (no matter how big is its initial value in the earlyuniverse) can be neutralized dynamically, i.e. without fine tuning, and hence abig bang-like evolution of the cosmos becomes possible. remarkably, a largeclass f^n_m of models of this kind, namely capable of dynamically adjusting thevacuum energy irrespective of its value and size, has been identified. in thispaper, we carefully put them to the experimental test. by performing a jointlikelihood analysis we confront these models with the most recent observationaldata on type ia supernovae (snia), the cosmic microwave background (cmb), thebaryonic acoustic oscillations (bao) and the high redshift data on theexpansion rate, so as to determine which ones are the most favored byobservations. we compare the optimal relaxation models f^n_m found by thismethod with the standard or concordance lambdacdm model, and find that some ofthese models may appear as almost indistinguishable from it. interestinglyenough, this shows that it is possible to construct viable solutions to thetough cosmological fine tuning problem with models that display the same basicphenomenological features as the concordance model.

0710.4151	dark energy: a quantum fossil from the inflationary universe?	the discovery of dark energy (de) as the physical cause for the acceleratedexpansion of the universe is the most remarkable experimental finding of moderncosmology. however, it leads to insurmountable theoretical difficulties fromthe point of view of fundamental physics. inflation, on the other hand,constitutes another crucial ingredient, which seems necessary to solve othercosmological conundrums and provides the primeval quantum seeds for structureformation. one may wonder if there is any deep relationship between these twoparadigms. in this work, we suggest that the existence of the de in the presentuniverse could be linked to the quantum field theoretical mechanism that mayhave triggered primordial inflation in the early universe. this mechanism,based on quantum conformal symmetry, induces a logarithmic,asymptotically-free, running of the gravitational coupling. if this evolutionpersists in the present universe, and if matter is conserved, the generalcovariance of einstein's equations demands the existence of dynamical de in theform of a running cosmological term whose variation follows a power law of theredshift.

1202.5097	matter non-conservation in the universe and dynamical dark energy	in an expanding universe the vacuum energy density \rho_{\lambda} is expectedto be a dynamical quantity. in quantum field theory in curved space-time\rho_{\lambda} should exhibit a slow evolution, determined by the expansionrate of the universe h. recent measurements on the time variation of the finestructure constant and of the proton-electron mass ratio suggest that basicquantities of the standard model, such as the qcd scale parameter\lambda_{qcd}, may not be conserved in the course of the cosmologicalevolution. the masses of the nucleons m_n and of the atomic nuclei would alsobe affected. matter is not conserved in such a universe. these measurements canbe interpreted as a leakage of matter into vacuum or vice versa. we point outthat the amount of leakage necessary to explain the measured value of\dot{m}_n/m_n could be of the same order of magnitude as the observationallyallowed value of \dot{\rho}_{\lambda}/\rho_{\lambda}, with a possiblecontribution from the dark matter particles. the dark energy in our universecould be the dynamical vacuum energy in interaction with ordinary baryonicmatter as well as with dark matter.

1204.4806	generalizing the running vacuum energy model and comparing with the  entropic-force models	we generalize the previously proposed running vacuum energy model byincluding a term proportional to \dot{h}, in addition to the existing h^2 term.we show that the added degree of freedom is very constrained if both lowredshift and high redshift data are taken into account. best-fit models areundistinguishable from lcdm at the present time, but could be distinguished inthe future with very accurate data at both low and high redshifts. we stressthe formal analogy at the phenomenological level of the running vacuum modelswith recently proposed dark energy models based on the holographic or entropicpoint of view, where a combination of \dot{h} and h^2 term is also present.however those particular entropic formulations which do not have a constantterm in the friedmann equations are not viable. the presence of this term isnecessary in order to allow for a transition from a decelerated to anaccelerated expansion. in contrast, the running vacuum models, both theoriginal and the generalized one introduced here contain this constant term ina more natural way. finally, important conceptual issues common to all thesemodels are emphasized.

1211.0311	delta r in the two-higgs-doublet model at full one loop level -- and  beyond	after the recent discovery of a higgs-like boson particle at the cernlhc-collider, it becomes more necessary than ever to prepare ourselves foridentifying its standard or non-standard nature. the electroweak parameterdelta r relating the values of the gauge boson masses [mw,mz] and the fermiconstant [g_f] is the traditional observable encoding high precisioninformation of the electroweak physics at the quantum level. in this work wepresent a complete quantitative study of delta r in the framework of thegeneral (unconstrained) two-higgs-doublet model (2hdm). first of all we reporton a systematic analysis of delta r at the full one loop level in the general2hdm, which to our knowledge was missing in the literature. thereby we extracta theoretical prediction for the mass of the w-boson in this model, taking mz,\alpha_{em} and g_f as experimental inputs. we find typical corrections leadingto mass shifts $\delta mw \sim 20-40 mev$ which help to improve the agreementwith the experimentally measured value, in a degree no less significant than inthe mssm case. in the second part of our study we extend our calculation beyondthe mere one-loop order. we devise an effective lagrangian approach thatcaptures the dominant higher order quantum effects on delta rho (viz. that partof delta r describing the breaking of the approximate su(2) custodial symmetry)in the limit of large higgs boson self-interactions. this limit constitutes atelltale property of the general 2hdm which is unmatched by e.g. the mssm. ourconclusion is that the electroweak precision program to be conducted at thelhc, and maybe at a future linear collider, can nicely complement the directsearches. should these distinctive loop effects be eventually found they wouldsignal a smoking gun hinting at non-standard higgs physics.

1306.0591	complete cosmic history with a dynamical lambda(h) term	in the present mainstream cosmology, matter and spacetime emerged from asingularity and evolved through four distinct periods: early inflation,radiation, dark matter and late-time inflation (driven by dark energy). duringthe radiation and dark matter dominated stages, the universe is deceleratingwhile the early and late-time inflations are accelerating stages. a possibleconnection between the accelerating periods remains unknown, and, even moreintriguing, the best dark energy candidate powering the present acceleratingstage (lambda-vacuum) is plagued with the cosmological constant and coincidencepuzzles. here we propose an alternative solution for such problems based on alarge class of time-dependent vacuum energy density models in the form of powerseries of the hubble rate, lambda=lambda(h). the proposed class oflambda(h)-decaying vacuum model provides: i) a new mechanism for inflation(different from the usual inflaton models), (ii) a natural mechanism for agraceful exit, which is universal for the whole class of models; iii) thecurrently accelerated expansion of the universe, iv) a mild dynamical darkenergy at present; and v) a final de sitter stage. remarkably, the late-timecosmic expansion history of our class of models is very close to theconcordance lambdacdm model, but above all it furnishes the necessary smoothlink between the initial and final de sitter stages through the radiation- andmatter-dominated epochs.

1306.1527	cosmological constant and vacuum energy: old and new ideas	the cosmological constant (cc) term in einstein's equations, lambda, wasfirst associated to the idea of vacuum energy density. notwithstanding, it iswell-known that there is a huge, in fact appalling, discrepancy between thetheoretical prediction and the observed value picked from the moderncosmological data. this is the famous, and extremely difficult, "cc problem".paradoxically, the recent observation at the cern large hadron collider of ahiggs-like particle, should actually be considered ambivalent: on the one handit appears as a likely great triumph of particle physics, but on the other handit wide opens pandora's box of the cosmological uproar, for it may provide(alas!) the experimental certification of the existence of the electroweak (ew)vacuum energy, and thus of the intriguing reality of the cc problem. even ifonly counting on this contribution to the inventory of vacuum energies in theuniverse, the discrepancy with the cosmologically observed value is already of55 orders of magnitude. this is the (hitherto) "real" magnitude of the ccproblem, rather than the (too often) brandished 123 ones from the upper (butfully unexplored!) ultrahigh energy scales. such is the baffling situationafter 96 years of introducing the lambda-term by einstein. in the following iwill briefly (and hopefully pedagogically) fly over some of the old and newideas on the cc problem. since, however, the higgs boson just knocked our doorand recalled us that the vacuum energy may be a fully tangible concept in realphenomenology, i will exclusively address the cc problem from the originalnotion of vacuum energy, and its possible "running" with the expansion of theuniverse, rather than venturing into the numberless attempts to replace the ccby the multifarious concept of dark energy.

1307.4748	effective equation of state for running vacuum: "mirage" quintessence  and phantom dark energy	past analyses of the equation of state (eos) of the dark energy (de) were notincompatible with a phantom phase near our time. this has been the case in theyears of wmap observations, in combination with the remaining cosmologicalobservables. such situation did not completely disappear from the datacollected from the planck satellite mission. in it the eos analysis may stillbe interpreted as suggesting w&lt;-1, and so a mildly evolving de cannot bediscarded. in our opinion the usual ansatzs made on the structure of the eosfor dynamical de models (e.g. quintessence and the like) are too simplified. inthis work we examine in detail some of these issues and suggest that a generalclass of models with a dynamical vacuum energy density could explain thepersistent phantom anomaly, despite there is no trace of real phantom behaviorin them. the spurious or "mirage" effect is caused by an attempt to describethem as if the de would be caused by fundamental phantom scalar fields.remarkably, the effective de behavior can also appear as quintessence intransit to phantom, or vice versa.

1402.7049	vacuum energy and cosmological evolution	an expanding universe is not expected to have a static vacuum energy density.the so-called cosmological constant $\lambda$ should be an approximation,certainly a good one for a fraction of a hubble time, but it is most likely atemporary description of a true dynamical vacuum energy variable that isevolving from the inflationary epoch to the present day. we can compare theevolving vacuum energy with a casimir device where the parallel plates slowlymove apart ("expand"). the total vacuum energy density cannot be measured, onlythe effect associated to the presence of the plates, and then also theirincreasing separation with time. in the universe there is a nonvanishingspacetime curvature $r$ as compared to minkowskian spacetime that is changingwith the expansion. the vacuum energy density must change accordingly, and wenaturally expect $\delta\lambda\sim r\sim h^2$. a class of dynamical vacuummodels that trace such rate of change can be constructed. they are compatiblewith the current cosmological data, and conveniently extended can account forthe complete cosmic evolution from the inflationary epoch till the presentdays. these models are very close to the $\lambda$cdm model for the lateuniverse, but very different from it at the early times. traces of the inherentvacuum dynamics could be detectable in our recent past.

1408.4427	dark matter, dark energy and the time evolution of masses in the  universe	the traditional "explanation" for the observed acceleration of the universeis the existence of a positive cosmological constant. however, this can hardlybe a truly convincing explanation, as an expanding universe is not expected tohave a static vacuum energy density. so, it must be an approximation. thisreminds us of the so-called fundamental "constants" of nature. recent and pastmeasurements of the fine structure constant and of the proton-electron massratio suggest that basic quantities of the standard model, such as the qcdscale parameter $\lambda_{qcd}$, might not be conserved in the course of thecosmological evolution. the masses of the nucleons and of the atomic nucleiwould be time-evolving. this can be consistent with general relativity providedthe vacuum energy itself is a dynamical quantity. another framework realizingthis possibility is qhd (quantum haplodynamics), a fundamental theory of boundstates. if one assumes that its running couplings unify at the planck scale andthat such scale changes slowly with cosmic time, the masses of the nucleons andof the dm particles, including the cosmological term, will evolve with time.this could explain the dark energy of the universe.

1409.7048	dynamical vacuum energy in the expanding universe confronted with  observations: a dedicated study	despite the many efforts, our theoretical understanding of the ultimatenature of the dark energy component of the universe still lags well behind theastounding experimental evidence achieved from the increasingly sophisticatedobservational tools at our disposal. while the canonical possibility is astrict cosmological constant, or rigid vacuum energy density$\rho_{\lambda}=$const., the exceeding simplicity of this possibility lies alsoat the root of its unconvincing theoretical status, as there is no explanationfor the existence of such constant for the entire cosmic history. herein weexplore general models of the vacuum energy density slowly evolving with thehubble function $h$ and/or its time derivative, $\rho_{\lambda}(h,\dot{h})$.some of these models are actually well-motivated from the theoretical point ofview and may provide a rich phenomenology that could be explored in futureobservations, whereas some others have more limitations. in this work, we putthem to the test and elucidate which ones are still compatible with the presentobservations and which ones are already ruled out. we consider theirimplications on structure formation, in combination with data on type iasupernovae, the cosmic microwave background, the baryonic acousticoscillations, and the predicted redshift distribution of cluster-size collapsedstructures. the relation of these vacuum models on possible evidence ofdynamical dark energy recently pointed out in the literature is also brieflyaddressed.

1412.3785	vacuum models with a linear and a quadratic term in h: structure  formation and number counts analysis	we focus on the class of cosmological models with a time-evolving vacuumenergy density of the form $\rho_\lambda=c_0+c_1 h+c_2 h^2$, where $h$ is thehubble rate. higher powers of $h$ could be important for the early inflationaryepoch, but are irrelevant afterwards. we study these models at the backgroundlevel and at the perturbations level, both at the linear and at the nonlinearregime. we find that those with $c_0=0$ are seriously hampered, as they areunable to fit simultaneously the current observational data on hubble expansionand the linear growth rate of clustering. this is in contrast to the $c_0\neq0$ models, including the concordance $\lambda$cdm model. we also compute theredshift distribution of clusters predicted by all these models, in which theanalysis of the nonlinear perturbations becomes crucial. the outcome is thatthe models with $c_0=0$ predict a number of counts with respect to theconcordance model which is much larger, or much smaller, than the $\lambda$cdmand the dynamical models with $c_0\neq 0$. the particular case$\rho_\lambda\propto h$ (the pure lineal model), which in the past wasrepeatedly motivated by several authors from qcd arguments applied tocosmology, is also addressed and we assess in detail its phenomenologicalstatus. we conclude that the most favored models are those with $c_0\neq 0$,and we show how to discriminate them from the $\lambda$cdm.

1501.03832	the $\bar{\lambda}cdm$ cosmology: from inflation to dark energy through  running $\lambda$	perhaps the deepest mystery of our accelerating universe in expansion is theexistence of a tiny and rigid cosmological constant, $\lambda$. its size ismany orders of magnitude below the expected one in the standard model ofparticle physics. however, an expanding universe is not expected to have astatic vacuum energy density. we should rather observe a mildly dynamicalbehavior $\delta\lambda(t)\sim r\sim h^2(t)$ with the expansion rate $h$. atthe same time, it is natural to think that the huge value of the primevalvacuum energy (presumably connected to some grand unified theory) wasresponsible for the initial inflationary phase. in the traditional inflatonmodels such phase is inserted by hand in the early epoch of the cosmicevolution, and it is assumed to match the concordance $\lambda$cdm regimeduring the radiation epoch. here, instead, we consider a class of dynamicalvacuum models which incorporate into a single vacuum structure$\bar{\lambda}(h)$ the rapid stage of inflation, followed by the radiation andcold matter epochs, until achieving our dark energy universe. the earlybehavior of the model bares resemblance with starobinsky's inflation andptovides a solution to the large entropy problem. it is compatible with thelatest cosmological data on hubble expansion and structure formation, andpresents distinctive observational features that can be tested in the nearfuture.

1502.01411	fundamental constants and cosmic vacuum: the micro and macro connection	the idea that the vacuum energy density $\rho_{\lambda}$ could be timedependent is a most reasonable one in the expanding universe; in fact, muchmore reasonable than just a rigid cosmological constant for the entire cosmichistory. being $\rho_{\lambda}=\rho_{\lambda}(t)$ dynamical, it offers apossibility to tackle the cosmological constant problem in its various facets.furthermore, for a long time (most prominently since dirac's first proposal ona time variable gravitational coupling) the possibility that the fundamental"constants" of nature are slowly drifting with the cosmic expansion has beencontinuously investigated. in the last two decades, and specially in recenttimes, mounting experimental evidence attests that this could be the case. inthis paper, we consider the possibility that these two groups of facts might beintimately connected, namely that the observed acceleration of the universe andthe possible time variation of the fundamental constants are two manifestationsof the same underlying dynamics. we call it: the "micro and macro connection",and on its basis we expect that the cosmological term in einstein's equations,newton's coupling and the masses of all the particles in the universe, both thedark matter particles and the ordinary baryons and leptons, should all driftwith the cosmic expansion. here we discuss specific cosmological modelsrealizing such possibility in a way that preserves the principle of covarianceof general relativity.

1509.03298	background history and cosmic perturbations for a general system of  self-conserved dynamical dark energy and matter	we determine the hubble expansion and the general cosmic perturbationsequations for a general system consisting of self-conserved matter andself-conserved dark energy (de). while at the background level the twocomponents are non-interacting, they do interact at the perturbations level. weshow that the coupled system of matter and de perturbations can be transformedinto a single, third order, matter perturbation equation, which reduces to the(derivative of the) standard one in the case that the de is just a cosmologicalconstant. as a nontrivial application we analyze a class of dynamical modelswhose de density $\rho_d$ consists of a constant term, $c_0$, and a series ofpowers of the hubble rate. these models were previously analyzed from the pointof view of dynamical vacuum models, but here we treat them as self-conserved demodels with a dynamical equation of state. we fit them to the wealth ofexpansion history and linear structure formation data and compare the obtainedfit quality with that of the concordance $\lambda$cdm model. those with $c_0=0$include the so-called "entropic-force" and "qcd-ghost" de models, as well asthe pure linear model $\rho_d\sim h$, all of which appear strongly disfavored.the models with $c_0\neq 0$, in contrast, emerge as promising dynamical decandidates whose phenomenological performance is highly competitive with therigid $\lambda$-term inherent to the $\lambda$cdm.

0808.0315	can the cosmological "constant" run? - it may run	using standard quantum field theory, we discuss several theoretical aspectsof the possible running of the cosmological constant (cc) term in einstein'sequations. the basic motivation for the present work is to emphasize that thispossibility should also be taken into account when considering dynamical modelsfor the dark energy (de), which are nowadays mainly focused on identifying thede with the energy density associated to one or more ad hoc scalar fields. atthe same time, we address some recent criticisms that have been published (orprivately communicated to us) attempting to cast doubts on the fundamentalpossibility of such running. in this work, we argue that while there is nocomprehensive proof of the cc running, there is no rigorous proof of thenon-running either. in particular, some purported "non-running theorem"recently adduced in the literature is, in our opinion, completely insubstantialand formally incorrect. the way to the cc running is, therefore, still open andwe take here the opportunity to present a pedagogical review of the presentstate of the art in this field, including a a brief historical account.

astro-ph;0505133	effective equation of state for dark energy: mimicking quintessence and  phantom energy through a variable lambda	while there is mounting evidence in all fronts of experimental cosmology fora non-vanishing dark energy component in the universe, we are still far awayfrom understanding its ultimate nature. a fundamental cosmological constant,lambda, is the most natural candidate, but many dynamical mechanisms togenerate an effective lambda have been devised which postulate the existence ofa peculiar scalar field (so-called quintessence, and generalizations thereof).these models are essentially ad hoc, but they lead to the attractivepossibility of a time-evolving dark energy with a non-trivial equation of state(eos). most, if not all, future experimental studies on precision cosmology(e.g. the snap and planck projects) address very carefully the determination ofan eos parametrized ``a la quintessence''. here we show that by fittingcosmological data to an eos of that kind can also be interpreted as a hint of afundamental, but time-evolving, cosmological term: lambda=lambda(t). weexemplify this possibility by studying the effective eos associated to arenormalization group (rg) model for lambda. we find that the effective eos cancorrespond to both normal quintessence and phantom dark energy, depending onthe value of a single parameter of the rg model. we conclude that behind anon-trivial eos of a purported quintessence or phantom scalar field there canactually be a running cosmological term of a fundamental quantum field theory.

astro-ph;0507110	dynamical dark energy or variable cosmological parameters?	one of the main aims in the next generation of precision cosmologyexperiments will be an accurate determination of the equation of state (eos)for the dark energy (de). if the latter is dynamical, the resulting barotropicindex \omega should exhibit a non-trivial evolution with the redshift. usuallythis is interpreted as a sign that the mechanism responsible for the de isrelated to some dynamical scalar field, and in some cases this field may behavenon-canonically (phantom field). present observations seem to favor an evolvingde with a potential phantom phase near our time. in the literature there is aplethora of dynamical models trying to describe this behavior. here we showthat the simplest option, namely a model with a variable cosmological term,\lambda=\lambda(t), leads in general to a non-trivial effective eos, with index\omega_e, which may naturally account for these data features. we prove that inthis case there is always a ``crossing'' of the \omega_e=-1 barrier near ourtime. we also show how this effect is modulated (or even completely controled)by a variable newton's constant g=g(t).

0809.3462	dark energy perturbations and cosmic coincidence	while there is plentiful evidence in all fronts of experimental cosmology forthe existence of a non-vanishing dark energy (de) density \rho_d in theuniverse, we are still far away from having a fundamental understanding of itsultimate nature and of its current value, not even of the puzzling fact that\rho_d is so close to the matter energy density \rho_m at the present time(i.e. the so-called "cosmic coincidence" problem). the resolution of some ofthese cosmic conundrums suggests that the de must have some (mild) dynamicalbehavior at the present time. in this paper, we examine some general propertiesof the simultaneous set of matter and de perturbations (\delta\rho_m,\delta\rho_d) for a multicomponent de fluid. next we put these properties tothe test within the context of a non-trivial model of dynamical de (the lxcdmmodel) which has been previously studied in the literature. by requiring thatthe coupled system of perturbation equations for \delta\rho_m and \delta\rho_dhas a smooth solution throughout the entire cosmological evolution, that thematter power spectrum is consistent with the data on structure formation andthat the "coincidence ratio" r=\rho_d/\rho_m stays bounded and not unnaturallyhigh, we are able to determine a well-defined region of the parameter spacewhere the model can solve the cosmic coincidence problem in full compatibilitywith all known cosmological data.

gr-qc;0604057	lxcdm: a cosmon model solution to the cosmological coincidence problem?	we consider the possibility that the total dark energy (de) of the universeis made out of two dynamical components of different nature: a variablecosmological term, lambda, and a dynamical ``cosmon'', x, possibly interactingwith lambda but not with matter -- which remains conserved. we call thisscenario the lxcdm model. one possibility for x would be a scalar field, but itis not the only one. the overall equation of state (eos) of the lxcdm model caneffectively appear as quintessence or phantom energy depending on the mixtureof the two components. both the dynamics of lambda and of x could be linked tohigh energy effects near the planck scale. in the case of lambda it may berelated to the running of this parameter under quantum effects, whereas x mightbe identified with some fundamental field (say, a dilaton) left over as alow-energy ``relic'' by e.g. string theory. we find that the dynamics of thelxcdm model can trigger a future stopping of the universe expansion and cankeep the ratio rho_d/rho_m (de density to matter-radiation density) bounded andof order 1. therefore, the model could explain the so-called ``cosmologicalcoincidence problem''. this is in part related to the possibility that thepresent value of the cosmological term can be lambda&lt;0 in this framework (thecurrent total de density nevertheless being positive). however, a cosmic haltcould occur even if lambda&gt;0 because of the peculiar behavior of x as ``phantommatter''. we describe various cosmological scenarios made possible by thecomposite and dynamical nature of lxcdm, and discuss in detail their impact onthe cosmological coincidence problem.

gr-qc;0609017	density perturbations for running cosmological constant	the dynamics of density and metric perturbations is investigated for thepreviously developed model where the decay of the vacuum energy into matter (orvice versa) is due to the renormalization group (rg) running of thecosmological constant (cc) term. the evolution of the cc depends on the singleparameter \nu, which characterizes the running of the cc produced by thequantum effects of matter fields of the unknown high energy theory below theplanck scale. the sign of \nu indicates whether bosons or fermions dominate inthe running. the spectrum of perturbations is computed assuming an adiabaticregime and an isotropic stress tensor. moreover, the perturbations of the ccterm are generated from the simplest covariant form suggested by the rg modelunder consideration. the corresponding numerical analysis shows that for \nu&gt;0there is a depletion of the matter power spectrum at low scales (large wavenumbers) as compared to the standard lcdm model, whereas for \nu&lt;0 there is anexcess of power at low scales. we find that the lss data rule out the range|\nu|&gt; 10^{-4} while the values |\nu|&lt; 10^{-6} look perfectly acceptable. for\nu&lt;0 the excess of power at low scales grows rapidly and the bound is moresevere. from the particle physics viewpoint, the values |\nu|\sim 10^{-6}correspond to the ``desert'' in the mass spectrum above the gut scale m_x\sim10^{16} gev. our results are consistent with those obtained in other dynamicalmodels admitting an interaction between dark matter and dark energy. we findthat the matter power spectrum analysis is a highly efficient method todiscover a possible scale dependence of the vacuum energy.

hep-ph;0011091	loop induced flavor changing neutral decays of the top quark in a  general two-higgs-doublet model	decays of the top quark induced by flavor changing neutral currents (fcnc)are known to be extremely rare events within the standard model. this is so notonly for the decay modes into gauge bosons, but most notably in the case of thehiggs channels, e.g. t-&gt; h_{sm}+c, with a branching fraction of 10^{-13} atmost. therefore, detection of fcnc top quark decays in a future high-energy,and high-luminosity, machine like the lhc or the lc would be an indisputablesignal of new physics. in this paper we show that within the simplest extensionof the sm, namely the general two-higgs-doublet model, the fcnc top quarkdecays into higgs bosons, t-&gt;(h^{0},h^{0},a^{0})+c, can be the most favoredfcnc modes -- comparable or even more efficient than the gluon channel t-&gt; g+c.in both cases the optimal results are obtained for type ii models. however,only the higgs channels can have rates reaching the detectable level (10^{-5}),with a maximum of order 10^{-4} which is compatible with the charged higgsbounds from radiative b-meson decays. we compare with the previous resultsobtained in the higgs sector of the mssm.

hep-ph;0311171	testing the running of the cosmological constant with type ia supernovae  at high z	within the quantum field theory context the idea of a "cosmological constant"(cc) evolving with time looks quite natural as it just reflects the change ofthe vacuum energy with the typical energy of the universe. in the particularframe of ref.[30], a "running cc" at low energies may arise from genericquantum effects near the planck scale, m_p, provided there is a smoothdecoupling of all massive particles below m_p. in this work we further developthe cosmological consequences of a "running cc" by addressing the acceleratedevolution of the universe within that model. the rate of change of the cc staysslow, without fine-tuning, and is comparable to h^2 m_p^2. it can be describedby a single parameter, \nu, that can be determined from already plannedexperiments using sne ia at high z. the range of allowed values for \nu followmainly from nucleosynthesis restrictions. present samples of sne ia can not yetdistinguish between a "constant" cc or a "running" one. the numericalsimulations presented in this work show that snap can probe the predictedvariation of the cc either ruling out this idea or confirming the evolutionhereafter expected.

hep-ph;0402188	higgs boson flavor-changing neutral decays into bottom quarks in  supersymmetry	we analyze the maximum branching ratios for the flavor changing neutralcurrent (fcnc) decays of the neutral higgs bosons of the minimal supersymmetricstandard model (mssm) into bottom quarks, h -&gt; b\bar{s} (h=h^0,h^0,a^0). weconsistently correlate these decays with the radiative b-meson decays (b-&gt;s\gamma). a full-fledged combined numerical analysis is performed of thesehigh-energy and low-energy fcnc decay modes in the mssm parameter space. ourcalculation shows that the available data on b(b-&gt;s \gamma) severely restrictsthe allowed values of b(h-&gt;b\bar{s}). while the latter could reach a fewpercent level in fine-tuned scenarios, the requirement of naturalness reducesthese fcnc rates into the modest range b(h-&gt;b\bar{s}) ~ 10^{-4}-10^{-3}. wefind that the bulk of the mssm contribution to b(h-&gt;b\bar{s}) could originatefrom the strong supersymmetric sector. the maximum value of the fcnc ratesobtained in this paper disagree significantly with recent (over-)estimatesexisting in the literature. our results are still encouraging because they showthat the fcnc modes h-&gt;b\bar{s} can be competitive with other higgs bosonsignatures and could play a helpful complementary role to identify thesupersymmetric higgs bosons, particularly the lightest cp-even state in thecritical lhc mass region m_{h^0} ~= 90-130 gev.

hep-ph;0410095	running g and \lambda at low energies from physics at m_x: possible  cosmological and astrophysical implications	the renormalization group (rg) approach to cosmology is an efficient methodto study the possible evolution of the cosmological parameters from the pointof view of quantum field theory in curved space-time. in this work we continueour previous investigations of the rg method based on potential low-energyeffects induced from physics at very high energy scales m_x near m_p. in thepresent instance we assume that both the newton constant, g, and thecosmological term, \lambda, can be functions of a scale parameter \mu. it turnsout that g(\mu) evolves according to a logarithmic law which may lead toasymptotic freedom of gravity, similar to the gauge coupling in qcd. at thesame time \lambda(\mu) evolves quadratically with \mu. we study the consistencyand cosmological consequences of these laws when \mu=h. furthermore, we proposeto extend this method to the astrophysical domain after identifying the localrg scale at the galactic level. it turns out that kepler's third law ofcelestial mechanics receives quantum corrections that may help to explain theflat rotation curves of the galaxies without introducing the dark matterhypothesis. the origin of these effects (cosmological and astrophysical) couldbe linked, in our framework, to physics at m_x= 10^{16-17} gev.

hep-ph;0508043	production and fcnc decay of supersymmetric higgs bosons into heavy  quarks in the lhc	we analyze the production and subsequent decay of the neutral mssm higgsbosons (h = h^0, h^0, a^0) mediated by flavor changing neutral currents (fcnc)in the lhc collider. we have computed the h-production cross-section times thefcnc branching ratio, \sigma(pp -&gt; h -&gt; qq') = \sigma(pp -&gt; h) b(h -&gt; qq'), inthe lhc focusing on the strongly-interacting fcnc sector. here qq' is anelectrically neutral pair of quarks of different flavors, the dominant modesbeing those containing a heavy quark: tc or bs. we determine the maximumproduction rates for each of these modes and identify the relevant regions ofthe mssm parameter space, after taking into account the severe restrictionsimposed by low energy fcnc processes. the analysis of \sigma(pp -&gt; h -&gt; qq')singles out regions of the mssm parameter space different from those obtainedby maximizing only the branching ratio, due to non-trivial correlations betweenthe parameters that maximize/minimize each isolated factor. the productionrates for the bs channel can be huge for a fcnc process (0.1-1 pb), but itsdetection can be problematic. the production rates for the tc channel are moremodest (10^{-3}-10^{-2} pb), but its detection should be easier due to theclear-cut top quark signature. a few thousand tc events could be collected inthe highest luminosity phase of the lhc, with no counterpart in the sm.
