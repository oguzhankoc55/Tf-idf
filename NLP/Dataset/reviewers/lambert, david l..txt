0706.2029	the chemical compositions of the type ii cepheids -- the bl her and w  vir variables	abundance analyses from high-resolution optical spectra are presented for 19type ii cepheids in the galactic field. the sample includes both short-period(bl her) and long-period (w vir) stars. this is the first extensive abundanceanalysis of these variables. the c, n, and o abundances with similar spreadsfor the bl her and w vir show evidence for an atmosphere contaminated with$3\alpha$-process and cn-cycling products. a notable anomaly of the bl herstars is an overabundance of na by a factor of about five relative to theirpresumed initial abundances. this overabundance is not seen in the w vir stars.the abundance anomalies running from mild to extreme in w vir stars but notseen in the bl her stars are attributed to dust-gas separation that provides anatmosphere deficient in elements of high condensation temperature, notably al,ca, sc, ti, and $s$-process elements. such anomalies have previously been seenamong rv tau stars which represent a long-period extension of the variabilityenjoyed by the type ii cepheids. comments are offered on how the contrastingabundance anomalies of bl her and w vir stars may be explained in terms of thestars' evolution from the blue horizontal branch.

0704.1237	infrared high-resolution spectroscopy of post-agb circumstellar disks.  i. hr 4049 - the winnowing flow observed?	high-resolution infrared spectroscopy in the 2.3-4.6 micron region isreported for the peculiar a supergiant, single-lined spectroscopic binary hr4049. lines from the co fundamental and first overtone, oh fundamental, andseveral h2o vibration-rotation transitions have been observed in thenear-infrared spectrum. the spectrum of hr 4049 appears principally in emissionthrough the 3 and 4.6 micron region and in absorption in the 2 micron region.the 4.6 micron spectrum shows a rich 'forest' of emission lines. all thespectral lines observed in the 2.3-4.6 micron spectrum are shown to becircumbinary in origin. the presence of oh and h2o lines confirm theoxygen-rich nature of the circumbinary gas which is in contrast to thepreviously detected carbon-rich material. the emission and absorption lineprofiles show that the circumbinary gas is located in a thin, rotating layernear the dust disk. the properties of the dust and gas circumbinary disk andthe spectroscopic orbit yield masses for the individual stars, m_ai~0.58 msolarand m_mv~0.34 msolar. gas in the disk also has an outward flow with a velocityof $\gtrsim$ 1 km/s. the severe depletion of refractory elements but near-solarabundances of volatile elements observed in hr 4049 results from abundancewinnowing. the separation of the volatiles from the grains in the disk and thesubsequent accretion by the star are discussed. contrary to prior reports, thehr 4049 carbon and oxygen isotopic abundances are typical agb values:12c/13c=6^{+9}_{-4} and 16o/17o&gt;200.

0910.2288	rubidium in the interstellar medium	we present observations of interstellar rubidium toward o per, zeta per, aeaur, hd 147889, chi oph, zeta oph, and 20 aql. theory suggests that stable 85rband long-lived 87rb are produced predominantly by high-mass stars, through acombination of the weak s- and r-processes. the 85rb/87rb ratio was determinedfrom measurements of the rb i line at 7800 angstroms and was compared to thesolar system meteoritic ratio of 2.59. within 1-sigma uncertainties alldirections except hd 147889 have rb isotope ratios consistent with the solarsystem value. the ratio toward hd 147889 is much lower than the meteoriticvalue and similar to that toward rho oph a (federman et al. 2004); both linesof sight probe the rho ophiuchus molecular cloud. the earlier result wasattributed to a deficit of r-processed 85rb. our larger sample suggests insteadthat 87rb is enhanced in these two lines of sight. when the total elementalabundance of rb is compared to the k elemental abundance, the interstellar rb/kratio is significantly lower than the meteoritic ratio for all the sight linesin this study. available interstellar samples for other s- and r- processelements are used to help interpret these results.

0911.1335	accurate fundamental parameters or a, f, and g-type supergiants in the  solar neighbourhood	the following parameters are determined for 63 galactic supergiants in thesolar neighbourhood: effective temperature teff, surface gravity log g, ironabundance log e(fe), microturbulent parameter vt, mass m/msun, age t anddistance d. a significant improvement in the accuracy of the determination oflog g and, all parameters dependent on it, is obtained through application ofvan leeuwens (2007) re-reduction of the hipparcos parallaxes. the typical errorin the log g values is now +-0.06 dex for supergiants with distances d &lt; 300 pcand +-0.12 dex for supergiants with d between 300 and 700 pc; the mean error inteff for these stars is +-120 k. for supergiants with d &gt; 700 pc parallaxes areuncertain or unmeasurable, so typical errors in their log g values are 0.2-0.3dex.  a new teff scale for a5-g5 stars of luminosity classes ib-ii is presented.spectral subtypes and luminosity classes of several stars are corrected.combining the teff and log g with evolutionary tracks, stellar masses and agesare determined; a majority of the sample has masses between 4 msun and 15 msunand, hence, their progenitors were early to middle b-type main sequence stars.  using fe ii lines, which are insensitive to departures from lte, themicroturbulent parameter vt and the iron abundance log e(fe) are determinedfrom high-resolution spectra. the parameter vt is correlated with gravity: vtincreases with decreasing log g. the mean iron abundance for the 48 supergiantswith distances d &lt; 700 pc is log e(fe)=7.48+-0.09, a value close to the solarvalue of 7.45+-0.05, and thus the local supergiants and the sun have the samemetallicity.

1003.2901	oxygen isotopic ratios in cool r coronae borealis stars	we investigate the relationship between r coronae borealis (rcb) stars andhydrogen-deficient carbon (hdc) stars by measuring precise 16o/18o ratios forfive cool rcb stars. the 16o/18o ratios are derived by spectrum synthesis fromhigh-resolution (r=50,000) k-band spectra. lower limits to the 16o/17o and14n/15}n ratios as well as na and s abundances (when possible) are also given.rcb stars in our sample generally display less 18o than hdc stars - the derived16o/18o ratios range from 3 to 20. the only exception is the rcb star wx cra,which seems to be a hdc-like star with 16o/18o=0.3. our result of a higher16o/18o ratio for the rcb stars must be accounted for by a theory of theformation and evolution of hdc and rcb stars. we speculate that a latedredge-up of products of he-burning, principally 12c and 16o, may convert a18o-rich hdc star into a 18o-poor rcb star as the h-deficient star begins itsfinal evolution from a cool supergiant to the top of the white dwarf coolingtrack.

1008.0358	high resolution optical spectroscopy of the f supergiant proto-planetary  nebula v887 her=iras 18095+2704	an abundance analysis is presented for iras 18095+2704 (v887 her), a post-agbstar and proto-planetary nebula. the analysis is based on high-resolutionoptical spectra from the mcdonald observatory and the special astrophysicalobservatory. standard analysis using a classical kurucz model atmosphere andthe line analysis program moog provides the atmospheric parameters: teff = 6500k, log g = +0.5, and a microturbulent velocity vt = 4.7 km/s and [fe/h] = -0.9.extraction of these parameters is based on excitation of fei lines, ionizationequilibrium between neutral and ions of mg, ca, ti, cr, and fe, and the wingsof hydrogen paschen lines. elemental abundances are obtained for 22 elementsand upper limits for an additional four elements. these results show that thestar's atmosphere has not experienced a significant number of c- and s-processenriching thermal pulses. abundance anomalies as judged relative to thecompositions of unevolved and less-evolved normal stars of a similarmetallicity include al, y, and zr deficiencies with respect to fe of about 0.5dex. judged by composition, the star resembles a rv tauri variable that hasbeen mildly affected by dust-gas separation reducing the abundances of theelements of highest condensation temperature. this separation may occur in thestellar wind. there are indications that the standard 1d lte analysis is notentirely appropriate for iras 18095+2704. these include a supersonicmacroturbulent velocity of 23 km/s, emission in h-alpha and the failure ofpredicted profiles to fit observed profiles of h-beta and h-gamma.

1009.0054	nitrogen enrichment in atmospheres of a- and f- type supergiants	using new accurate fundamental parameters of 30 galactic a and f supergiants,namely their effective temperatures teff and surface gravities log g, weimplemented a non-lte analysis of the nitrogen abundance in their atmospheres.it is shown that the non-lte corrections to the n abundances increase withteff. the nitrogen overabundance as a general feature of this type of stars isconfirmed. a majority of the stars has a nitrogen excess [n/fe] between 0.2 and0.9 dex with the maximum position of the star's distribution on [n/fe] between0.4 and 0.7 dex. the n excesses are discussed in light of predictions forb-type main sequence (ms) stars with rotationally induced mixing and for theirnext evolutionary phase, i.e. a- and f-type supergiants that have experiencedthe first dredge-up. rotationally induced mixing in the ms progenitors of thesupergiants may be a significant cause of the nitrogen excesses. when comparingour results with predictions of the theory developed for stars with the mixing,we find that the bulk of the supergiants (28 of 30) show the n enrichment thatcan be expected (i) either after the ms phase for stars with the initialrotational velocities v0 = 200-400 km s-1, (ii) or after the first dredge-upfor stars with v0 = 50-400 km s-1. the latter possibility is preferred onaccount of the longer lifetime for stars on red-blue loops following the firstdredge-up. two supergiants without a discernible n enrichment, namely hr 825and hr 7876, may be post-ms objects with the relatively low initial rotationalvelocity of about 100 km s-1. the suggested range for v0 is approximatelyconsistent with inferences from the observed projected rotational velocities ofb-type ms stars, progenitors of a and f supergiants.

1102.2299	origin of lithium enrichment in k giants	in this letter, we report on a low-resolution spectroscopic survey forli-rich k giants among 2000 low mass (m &lt;= 3 msun) giants spanning theluminosity range from below to above the luminosity of the clump. fifteen newli-rich giants including four super li-rich k giants (a(li) &gt;= 3.2) werediscovered. a significant finding is that there is a concentration of li-rich kgiants at the luminosity of the clump or red horizontal branch. this newfinding is partly a consequence of the fact that our low-resolution survey isthe first large survey to include giants well below and above the rgb bump andclump locations in the hr diagram. origin of the lithium enrichment may beplausibly attributed to the conversion of 3he via 7be to 7li by thecameron-fowler mechanism but the location for onset of the conversion isuncertain. two possible opportunities to effect this conversion are discussed:the bump in the first ascent of the red giant branch (rgb) and the he-coreflash at the tip of the rgb. the finite luminosity spread of the li-rich giantsserves to reject the idea that li enhancement is, in general, a consequence ofa giant swallowing a large planet.

1107.1185	dust around r coronae borealis stars: i. spitzer/irs observations	spitzer/irs spectra from 5 to 37 um for a complete sample of 31 r coronaeborealis stars (rcbs) are presented. these spectra are combined with opticaland near-infrared photometry of each rcb at maximum light to compile a spectralenergy distribution (sed). the seds are fitted with blackbody fluxdistributions and estimates made of the ratio of the infrared flux fromcircumstellar dust to the flux emitted by the star. comparisons for 29 of the31 stars are made with the iras fluxes from three decades earlier: spitzer andiras fluxes at 12 um and 25 um are essentially equal for all but a minority ofthe sample. for this minority, the iras to spitzer flux ratio exceeds a factorof three. the outliers are suggested to be stars where formation of a dustcloud or dust puff is a rare event. a single puff ejected prior to the irasobservations may have been reobserved by spitzer as a cooler puff at a greaterdistance from the rcb. rcbs which experience more frequent optical declineshave, in general, a circumstellar environment containing puffs subtending alarger solid angle at the star and a quasi-constant infrared flux. yet, theestimated subtended solid angles and the blackbody temperatures of the dustshow a systematic evolution to lower solid angles and cooler temperatures inthe interval between iras and spitzer. dust emission by these rcbs and those inthe lmc is similar in terms of total 24 um luminosity and [8.0]-[24.0] colorindex.

1107.1316	is the post-agb star sao 40039 mildly h-deficient?	we have conducted an lte abundance analysis for sao 40039 a warm post-agbstar whose spectrum is known to show surprisingly strong he i lines for itseffective temperature and has been suspected of being h-deficient and he-rich.high-resolution optical spectra are analyzed using a family of modelatmospheres with different he/h ratios. atmospheric parameters are estimatedfrom the ionization equilibrium set by neutral and singly ionized species of feand mg, the excitation of fe i and fe ii lines and the wings of the paschenlines. on the assumption that the he i lines are of photospheric and notchromospheric in origin, a he/h ratio of approximately unity is found byimposing the condition that the adopted he/h ratio of the model atmosphere mustequal the ratio derived from the observed he i triplet lines at 5876, 4471 and4713 angstrom, and singlet lines at 4922 and 5015 angstrom. using the modelwith the best-fitting atmospheric parameters for this he/h ratio, sao 40039 isconfirmed to exhibit mild dust-gas depletion, i.e., the star has an atmospheredeficient in elements of high condensation temperature. the star appears to bemoderately metal-deficient with [fe/h]=-0.4 dex. but the star's intrinsicmetallicty as estimated from na, s and zn, elements of a low condensationtemperature, is [fe/h]_o {[fe/h]_o refers to the star's intrinsic metallicity}~ -0.2. the star is enriched in n and perhaps o too, changes reflecting thestar's agb past and the event that led to he enrichment.

1108.1947	the distribution of the elements in the galactic disk iii. a  reconsideration of cepheids from l = 30 to 250 degrees	this paper reports on the spectroscopic investigation of 238 cepheids in thenorthern sky. of these stars, about 150 are new to the study of the galacticabundance gradient. these new cepheids bring the total number of cepheidsinvolved in abundance distribution studies to over 400. in this work we alsoconsider systematics between various studies and also those which result fromthe choice of models. we find systematic variations exist at the 0.06 dex levelboth between studies and model atmospheres. in order to control the systematiceffects our final gradients depend only on abundances derived herein. a simplelinear fit to the cepheid data from 398 stars yields a gradient d[fe/h]/drg =-0.062 \pm 0.002 dex/kpc which is in good agreement with previously determinedvalues. we have also reexamined the region of the "metallicity island" of lucket al.

1303.4853	spectroscopic followup of three bright halo stars selected from sdss and  galex photometry	we aim to reveal the nature of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) stars:sdssj100921.40+375233.9, sdssj015717.04+135535.9, and sdssj171422.43+283657.2,showing apparently high nuv excesses for their g-z colors, as expected forextremely low-metallicity stars. high resolution (r=60 000) spectra of thestars with a wide wavelength coverage were obtained to determine their chemicalcompositions with the tull echelle spectrograph on the 2.7 m telescope at themcdonald observatory. we derived the spectroscopic parameters teff =5820+-125k, log g =3.9+-0.2, and vt =1.1+-0.5 km/s for sdssj100921.40+375233.9,teff=6250+-125 k, log g =3.7+-0.2, and vt =4.0+-0.5 km/s forsdssj015717.04+135535.9, and teff=6320+-125 k, log g =4.1+-0.3, and vt=1.5+-0.5 km/s for sdss j171422.43+283657.2, and elemental abundances werecomputed for 21 elements for j100921 and j171422 and for 19 elements forj015717 for the first time. we find metallicities of [fe/h]= -1.30, -0.94, and-0.80 for sdssj100921.40+375233.9, j015717.04+135535.9, andj171422.43+283657.2, respectively. on the basis of calculated abundance ratiosfor j171422.43+283657.2 and j015717.04+135535.9, we also report that these twoprogram stars have the expected composition of main-sequence halo turnoffstars, but with low-alpha abundances, i.e., the [alpha/fe] ratio is ~0.0 forj171422.43+283657.2 and ~0.1 for j015717.04+135535.9. the latter one showstypical halo or thick-disk alpha-element abundances, but has a substantialrotational line broadening and vsini=40 +- 0.5 km/s.

1407.1449	searching for dust around hyper metal-poor stars	we examine the mid-infrared fluxes and spectral energy distributions formetal-poor stars with iron abundances [fe/h] $\lesssim-5$, as well as twocemp-no stars, to eliminate the possibility that their low metallicities arerelated to the depletion of elements onto dust grains in the formation of adebris disk. six out of seven stars examined here show no mid-ir excess. thesenon-detections rule out many types of circumstellar disks, e.g. a warm debrisdisk ($t\!\le\!290$ k), or debris disks with inner radii $\le1$ au, such asthose associated with the chemically peculiar post-agb spectroscopic binariesand rv tau variables. however, we cannot rule out cooler debris disks, northose with lower flux ratios to their host stars due to, e.g. a smaller diskmass, a larger inner disk radius, an absence of small grains, or even amulticomponent structure, as often found with the chemically peculiar lambdabootis stars. the only exception is he0107-5240, for which a small mid-irexcess near 10 microns is detected at the 2-$\sigma$ level; if the excess isreal and associated with this star, it may indicate the presence of (recent)dust-gas winnowing or a binary system.

1408.3798	on the binary helium star dy centauri: chemical composition and  evolutionary state	dy cen has shown a steady fading of its visual light by about 1 magnitude inthe last 40 years suggesting a secular increase in its effective temperature.we have conducted non-lte and lte abundance analyses to determine the star'seffective temperature, surface gravity, and chemical composition usinghigh-resolution spectra obtained over two decades. the derived stellarparameters for three epochs suggest that dy cen has evolved at a constantluminosity and has become hotter by about 5000 k in 23 years. we show that thederived abundances remain unchanged for the three epochs. the derivedabundances of the key elements, including f and ne, are as observed for theextreme helium stars resulting from a merger of an he white dwarf with a c-owhite dwarf. thus, dy cen by chemical composition appears to be also a productof a merger of two white dwarfs. this appearance seems to be at odds with therecent suggestion that dy cen is a single-lined spectroscopic binary.

1411.2722	carbon abundance and the n/c ratio in atmospheres of a-, f- and g-type  supergiants and bright giants	based on our prior accurate determination of fundamental parameters for 36galactic a-, f- and g-type supergiants and bright giants (luminosity classes iand ii), we undertook a non-lte analysis of the carbon abundance in theiratmospheres. it is shown that the non-lte corrections to the c abundancesderived from c i lines are negative and increase with the effective temperatureteff; the corrections are especially significant for the infrared c i lineswith wavelengths 9060-9660 \aa. the carbon underabundance as a general propertyof the stars in question is confirmed; a majority of the stars studied has thecarbon deficiency [c/fe] between -0.1 and -0.5 dex, with a minimum at -0.7 dex.when comparing the derived c deficiency with the n excess found by us for thesame stars earlier, we obtain a pronounced n vs. c anti-correlation, whichcould be expected from predictions of the theory.we found that the ratio [n/c]spans mostly the range from 0.3 to 1.7 dex. both these enhanced [n/c] valuesand the c and n anomalies themselves are an obvious evidence of the presence ona star's surface of mixed material from stellar interiors; so, a majority ofprogramme stars passed through the deep mixing during the main sequence (ms)and/or the first dredge-up (fd) phase. comparison with theoretical predictionsincluding rotationally-induced mixing shows that the stars are either post-msobjects with the initial rotational velocities v0 = 200-300 km/s or post-fdobjects with v0 = 0-300 km/s. the observed n vs. c anti-correlation reflects adependence of the c and n anomalies on the v0 value: on average the higher v0the greater the anomalies. it is shown that an absence of detectable lithium inthe atmospheres of the stars, which is accompanied with the observed n excessand c deficiency, is quite explainable.

1503.08221	the c$^{14}$n/c$^{15}$n ratio in diffuse molecular clouds	we report the first detection of c$^{15}$n in diffuse molecular gas from adetailed examination of cn absorption lines in archival vlt/uves spectra ofstars probing local diffuse clouds. absorption from the c$^{15}$n isotopologueis confidently detected (at $\gtrsim4\sigma$) in three out of the fourdirections studied and appears as a very weak feature between the main$^{12}$cn and $^{13}$cn absorption components. column densities for each cnisotopologue are determined through profile fitting, after accounting for weakadditional line-of-sight components of $^{12}$cn, which are seen in theabsorption profiles of ch and ch$^+$ as well. the weighted mean value ofc$^{14}$n/c$^{15}$n for the three sight lines with detections of c$^{15}$n is$274\pm18$. since the diffuse molecular clouds toward our target stars haverelatively high gas kinetic temperatures and relatively low visual extinctions,their c$^{14}$n/c$^{15}$n ratios should not be affected by chemicalfractionation. the mean c$^{14}$n/c$^{15}$n ratio that we obtain shouldtherefore be representative of the ambient $^{14}$n/$^{15}$n ratio in the localinterstellar medium. indeed, our mean value agrees well with that derived frommillimeter-wave observations of cn, hcn, and hnc in local molecular clouds.

1506.01348	early-type stars observed in the eso uves paranal observatory project -  v. time-variable interstellar absorption	the structure and properties of the diffuse interstellar medium (ism) onsmall scales, sub-au to 1 pc, are poorly understood. we compare interstellarabsorption-lines, observed towards a selection of o- and b-type stars at two ormore epochs, to search for variations over time caused by the transverse motionof each star combined with changes in the structure in the foreground ism. twosets of data were used: 83 vlt- uves spectra with approximately 6 yr betweenepochs and 21 mcdonald observatory 2.7m telescope echelle spectra with 6 - 20yr between epochs, over a range of scales from 0 - 360 au. the interstellarabsorption-lines observed at the two epochs were subtracted and searched forany residuals due to changes in the foreground ism. of the 104 sightlinesinvestigated with typically five or more components in na i d, possibletemporal variation was identified in five uves spectra (six components), in caii, ca i and/or na i absorption-lines. the variations detected range from 7\%to a factor of 3.6 in column density. no variation was found in any otherinterstellar species. most sightlines show no variation, with 3{\sigma} upperlimits to changes of the order 0.1 - 0.3 dex in ca ii and na i. thesevariations observed imply that fine-scale structure is present in the ism, butat the resolution available in this study, is not very common at visiblewavelengths. a determination of the electron densities and lower limits to thetotal number density of a sample of the sightlines implies that there is nostriking difference between these parameters in sightlines with, and sightlineswithout, varying components.

1508.02815	local associations and the barium puzzle	we have observed high-dispersion echelle spectra of main-sequence stars infive nearby young associations -- argus, carina-near, hercules-lyra, orion andsubgroup b4 -- and derived abundances for elements ranging from na to eu. theseare the first chemical abundance measurements for two of the five associations,while the remaining three associations are analysed more extensively in ourstudy. our results support the presence of chemical homogeneity amongassociation members with a typical star-to-star abundance scatter of about 0.06dex or less over many elements. the five associations show log$\epsilon$(li)consistent with their age and share a solar chemical composition for allelements with the exception of ba. we find that all the heavy elements (y, zr,la, ce, nd, sm and eu) exhibit solar ratios, i.e., [x/fe] $\simeq$ 0, while bais overabundant by about 0.2-0.3 dex. the origin of the overabundance of ba isa puzzle. within the formulation of the s-process, it is difficult to create ahigher ba abundance without a similar increase in the s-process contributionsto other heavy elements (la-sm). given that ba is represented by strong linesof ba ii and la-sm are represented by rather weak ionized lines, thesuggestion, as previously made by other studies, is that the ba abundance maybe systematically overestimated by standard methods of abundance analysisperhaps because the upper reaches of the stellar atmospheres are poorlyrepresented by standard model atmospheres. a novel attempt to analyse the ba iline at 5535 \aa\ gives a solar ba abundance for stars with effectivetemperatures hotter than about 5800 k but increasingly subsolar ba abundancesfor cooler stars with apparent ba deficiencies of 0.5 dex at 5100 k. this trendwith temperature may signal a serious non-lte effect on the ba i line.

astro-ph;0001508	the near-ultraviolet continuum of late-type stars	analyses of the near-ultraviolet continuum of late-type stars have led tocontroversial results regarding the performance of state-of-the-art modelatmospheres. the release of the homogeneous iue final archive and theavailability of the high-accuracy hipparcos parallaxes provide an opportunityto revisit this issue, as accurate stellar distances make it possible tocompare observed absolute fluxes with the predictions of model atmospheres.  the near-uv continuum is highly sensitive to teff and [fe/h], and once thegravity is constrained from the parallax, these parameters may be derived fromthe analysis of low-dispersion "long-wavelength" (2000-3000 a) iue spectra forstars previously studied by alonso et al. (1996; a&amp;as 117, 227) using theinfrared flux method (irfm). a second comparison is carried out against thestars spectroscopically investigated by gratton et al. (1996; a&amp;a 314, 191). itis shown that there is a good agreement between teffs obtained from the irfmand from the near-uv continuum, and a remarkable correspondence betweenobserved and synthetic fluxes for stars with 4000 &lt;= teff &lt;= 6000 k of anymetallicity and gravity. these facts suggest that model atmospheres provide anadequate description of the near-uv continuum forming region and that theopacities involved are essentially understood. for cooler stars, the results ofthe irfm are no longer reliable, as shown by alonso et al., but the discrepancynoticed for stars hotter than 6000 k may reflect problems in the modelatmospheres and/or the opacities at these higher temperatures.

astro-ph;0004315	evidence for newly synthesized lithium in interstellar space	as a part of a study on the variation in the 7li/6li ratio, high signal tonoise, high resolution spectroscopy of li i (6708 angstroms) and k i (4044angstroms) were obtained toward zeta and o per. the lithium isotope shift isapproximately the same as its fine structure splitting (0.158 angstroms),resulting in a blend of the 7li and 6li lines. use of the k i line as avelocity template allowed a straightforward determination of the lithiumisotopic ratio.  our high resolution observations show remarkably disparate isotope ratios:7li/6li = 1 0.6 +/- 2.9 toward zeta per and 3.6 +/- 0.6 and 1.7 +/- 0.3 towardo per. while the results toward zeta per are consistent with the meteoriticvalue, the ratio toward o per's clouds suggest recent galactic cosmic rayspallation. this is the first clear and unambiguous evidence for aninterstellar 7li/6li ratio that differs dramatically from the solar systemvalue. the low ratio indicates a higher cosmic ray flux toward o per thantoward zeta per. a higher flux of cosmic rays toward o per was suggestedearlier in a study of oh and hd chemistry (federman, weber, &amp; lambert 1996, apj463, 181).  the total lithium abundances and the k/li ratio are useful in placing the7li/6li ratio into context. we obtained total lithium abundances of (12.2 +/-2.2) x 10^(-10) toward zeta per and (9.8 +/- 3.5) x 10^(-10) toward o per. thecolumns of k i and li i yielded k/li ratios that revealed no discernable trend.since a li isotope ratio ~2 toward o per suggests newly processed lithium, thecomparable total li abundances and k/li ratios are unexpected.

astro-ph;0106360	the 'forbidden' abundance of oxygen in the sun	we reexamine closely the solar photospheric line at 6300 a, which isattributed to a forbidden line of neutral oxygen, and is widely used inanalyses of other late-type stars.  we use a three-dimensional time-dependent hydrodynamical model solaratmosphere which has been tested successfully against observed granulationpatterns and an array of absorption lines. we show that the solar line is ablend with a ni i line, as previously suggested but oftentimes neglected.thanks to accurate atomic data on the [o i] and ni i lines we are able toderive an accurate oxygen abundance for the sun: log epsilon (o) = 8.69 +/-0.05 dex, a value at the lower end of the distribution of previously publishedabundances, but in good agreement with estimates for the local interstellarmedium and hot stars in the solar neighborhood. we conclude by discussing theimplication of the ni i blend on oxygen abundances derived from the [o i] 6300a line in disk and halo stars.

astro-ph;0212233	an ultra-high-resolution survey of the interstellar ^7li-to-^6li isotope  ratio in the solar neighborhood	in an effort to probe the extent of variations in the interstellar ^7li/^6liratio seen previously, ultra-high-resolution (r ~ 360,000), highsignal-to-noise spectra of stars in the perseus ob2 and scorpius ob2associations were obtained. these measurements confirm our earlier findings ofan interstellar ^7li/^6li ratio of about 2 toward o per, the value predictedfrom models of galactic cosmic ray spallation reactions. observations of othernearby stars yield limits consistent with the isotopic ratio ~ 12 seen incarbonaceous chondrite meteorites. if this ratio originally represented the gastoward o per, then to decrease the original isotope ratio to its current valuean order of magnitude increase in the li abundance is expected, but is notseen. the elemental k/li ratio is not unusual, although li and k are formed viadifferent nucleosynthetic pathways. several proposals to account for the low^7li/^6li ratio were considered, but none seems satisfactory.  analysis of the li and k abundances from our survey highlighted two sightlines where depletion effects are prevalent. there is evidence for enhanceddepletion toward x per, since both abundances are lower by a factor of 4 whencompared to other sight lines. moreover, a smaller li/h abundance is observedtoward 20 aql, but the k/h abundance is normal, suggesting enhanced lidepletion (relative to k) in this direction. our results suggest that the^7li/^6li ratio has not changed significantly during the last 4.5 billion yearsand that a ratio ~ 12 represents most gas in the solar neighborhood. inaddition, there appears to be a constant stellar contribution of ^7li,indicating that one or two processes dominate its production in the galaxy.

(2001), the abundance variations exist even inmain sequence stars. this strongly suggests that the star-to-star abundancevariations are a result of varying degrees of pollution with intermediate massagb stars being likely polluters. even for the least polluted stars, theabundances of 25mg and 26mg relative to 24mg are considerably higher thanpredicted for ejecta from z=0 supernovae. zero metallicity agb stars may beresponsible for these higher abundances. our measured mg isotopic ratios revealanother layer to the globular cluster star-to-star abundance variations thatdemands extensions of our present theoretical knowledge of stellarnucleosynthesis by giant stars.

astro-ph;0304170	further evidence for chemical fractionation from ultraviolet  observations of carbon monoxide	ultraviolet absorption from interstellar 12co and 13co was detected towardrho oph a and chi oph. the measurements were obtained at medium resolution withthe goddard high resolution spectrograph on the hubble space telescope. columndensity ratios, n(12co)/n(13co), of 125 \pm 23 and 117 \pm 35 were derived forthe sight lines toward rho oph a and chi oph, respectively. a value of 1100 \pm600 for the ratio n(12c16o)/n(12c18o) toward rho oph a was also obtained.absorption from vibrationally excited h_2 (v" = 3) was clearly seen toward thisstar as well.  the ratios are larger than the isotopic ratios for carbon and oxygenappropriate for ambient interstellar material. since for both carbon and oxygenthe more abundant isotopomer is enhanced, selective isotopic photodissociationplays the key role in the fractionation process for these directions. theenhancement arises because the more abundant isotopomer has lines that are moreoptically thick, resulting in more self shielding from dissociating radiation.a simple argument involving the amount of self shielding [from n(12co)] and thestrength of the ultraviolet radiation field premeating the gas (from the amountof vibrationally excited h_2) shows that selective isotopic photodissociationcontrols the fractionation seen in these two sight lines, as well as the sightline to zeta oph.

(2000).  although the observed strength of a c i line is constant from cool to hot rcbstars, the strength is weaker than predicted by an amount equivalent to afactor of four reduction of a line's gf-value. asplund et al. dubbed this 'thecarbon problem' and discussed possible solutions.  the [c i] 9850 a line seen clearly in r crb and su tau confirms the magnitudeof the carbon problem revealed by the c i lines. the [c i] 8727 a line measuredin five stars shows an enhanced carbon problem. the gf-value required to fitthe observed [c i] 8727 a line is a factor of 15 less than the well-determinedtheoretical gf-value. we suggest that the carbon problem for all lines may bealleviated to some extent by a chromospheric-like temperature rise in thesestars. the rise far exceeds that predicted by our non-lte calculations, andrequires a substantial deposition of mechanical energy.

astro-ph;0410418	lithium in very metal-poor dwarf stars - problems for standard big bang  nucleosynthesis?	the standard model of primordial nucleosynthesis by the big bang as selectedby the wmap-based estimate of the baryon density ($\omega_bh^2$) predicts anabundance of $^7$li that is a factor of three greater than the generallyreported abundance for stars on the spite plateau, and an abundance of $^6$lithat is about a thousand times less than is found for some stars on theplateau. this review discusses and examines these two discrepancies. they canlikely be resolved without major surgery on the standard model of the big bang.in particular, stars on the spite plateau may have depleted their surfacelithium abundance over their long lifetime from the wmap-based predictedabundances down to presently observed abundances, and synthesis of $^6$li (and$^7$li) via $\alpha + \alpha$ fusion reactions may have occurred in the earlygalaxy. yet, there remain fascinating ways in which to remove the twodiscrepancies involving aspects of a new cosmology, particularly through theintroduction of exotic particles.

astro-ph;9508001	the abundance of boron in evolved a- and b-type stars	boron abundances in a- and b-type stars may be a successful way to trackevolutionary effects in these hot stars. the light elements -- li, be, and b --are tracers of exposure to temperatures more moderate than those in which theh-burning cn-cycle operates. thus, any exposure of surface stellar layers todeeper layers will affect these light element abundances. li and be are used inthis role in investigations of evolutionary processes in cool stars, but arenot observable in hotter stars. an investigation of boron, however, is possiblethrough the b ii 1362=c5 resonance line.  we have gathered high resolution spectra from the iue database of a- andb-type stars near 10~m$_\odot$ for which nitrogen abundances have beendetermined (by gies &amp; lambert, 1992, and venn 1995). the b ii 1362=c5 line isblended throughout the temperature range of this program, requiring spectrumsyntheses to recover the boron abundances. for no star could we synthesize the1362=c5 region using the meteoritic/solar boron abundance of log(b) =3d 2.88(anders &amp; grevesse 1989); a lower boron abundance was necessary which mayreflect evolutionary effects (e.g., mass loss or mixing near themain-sequence), the natal composition of the star forming regions, or asystematic error in the analyses (e.g., non-lte effects). regardless of theinitial boron abundance, and despite the possibility of non-lte effects, itseems clear that boron is severely depleted in some stars. it may be that thenitrogen and boron abundances are anticorrelated, as would be expected frommixing between the h-burning and outer stellar layers. if, as we suspect, aresidue of boron is present in the a-type supergiants, we may exclude ascenario in which mixing occurs continuously between the surface and the deep

astro-ph;9907099	the 1995-1996 decline of r coronae borealis - high resolution optical  spectroscopy	a set of high-resolution optical spectra of rcrb acquired before, during, andafter its 1995-1996 decline is discussed. all of the components reported fromearlier declines are seen. this novel dataset provides new information on thesecomponents including several aspects not previously seen in declines of rcrband other rcbs. in the latter category is the discovery that the decline'sonset is marked by distortions of absorption lines of high-excitation lines,and quickly followed by emission in these and in low excitation lines. this'photospheric trigger' implies that dust causing the decline is formed close tothe star. these emission lines fade quickly. after 1995 november 2, lowexcitation narrow (fwhm ~12 km s-1) emission lines remain. these appear to be apermanent feature, slightly blue-shifted from the systemic velocity, andunaffected by the decline except for a late and slight decrease of flux atminimum light. the location of the warm, dense gas providing these lines isuncertain. absorption lines unaffected by overlying sharp emission are greatlybroadened, weakened, and red-shifted at the faintest magnitudes when scatteredlight from the star is a greater contributor than direct light transmittedthrough the fresh soot cloud. a few broad lines are seen at and near minimumlight with approxiamately constant flux: prominent among these are the he itriplet series, na i d, and [n ii] lines. these lines are blue-shifted by about30 km s(-1) relative to the systemic velocity with no change in velocity overthe several months for whicht he lines were seen. it is suggested that theselines, especially the he i lines, arise from an accretion disk around an unseencompact companion, which may be a low-mass white dwarf. if so, r crb is similarto the unusual post-agb star 89 her.

astro-ph;9907155	a consistency test of spectroscopic gravities for late-type stars	chemical analyses of late-type stars are usually carried out following theclassical recipe: lte line formation and homogeneous, plane-parallel,flux-constant, and lte model atmospheres. we review different results in theliterature that have suggested significant inconsistencies in the spectroscopicanalyses, pointing out the difficulties in deriving independent estimates ofthe stellar fundamental parameters and hence,detecting systematic errors.  the trigonometric parallaxes measured by the hipparcos mission provideaccurate appraisals of the stellar surface gravity for nearby stars, which areused here to check the gravities obtained from the photospheric iron ionizationbalance. we find an approximate agreement for stars in the metallicity range -1&lt;= [fe/h] &lt;= 0, but the comparison shows that the differences between thespectroscopic and trigonometric gravities decrease towards lower metallicitiesfor more metal-deficient dwarfs (-2.5 &lt;= [fe/h] &lt;= -1.0), which casts a shadowupon the abundance analyses for extreme metal-poor stars that make use of theionization equilibrium to constrain the gravity. the comparison with thestrong-line gravities derived by edvardsson (1988) and fuhrmann (1998a)confirms that this method provides systematically larger gravities than theionization balance. the strong-line gravities get closer to the physical onesfor the stars analyzed by fuhrmann, but they are even further away than theiron ionization gravities for the stars of lower gravities in edvardsson'ssample. the confrontation of the deviations of the iron ionization gravities inmetal-poor stars reported here with departures from the excitation balancefound in the literature, show that they are likely to be induced by the samephysical mechanism(s).

astro-ph;9907368	model photospheres for late-type stars from the inversion of  high-resolution spectroscopic observations. groombridge 1830 and epsilon  eridani	an inversion technique to recover lte one-dimensional model photospheres forlate-type stars, which was previously applied to the sun (allende prieto et al.1998), is now employed to reconstruct, semi-empirically, the photospheres ofcooler dwarfs: the metal-poor gmb1830 and the active star of solar-metallicityeps eri. the model atmospheres we find reproduce satisfactorily all theconsidered weak-to-moderate neutral lines of metals, satisfying in detail theexcitation equilibrium of iron, the wings of strong lines, and the slope of theoptical continuum. the retrieved models show a slightly steeper temperaturegradient than flux-constant model atmospheres in the layers where log tau &lt;=-0.5. we argue that these differences should reflect missing ingredients in theflux-constant models and point to granular-like inhomogeneities as the bestcandidate.  the iron ionization equilibrium is well satisfied by the model for gmb1830,but not for eps eri, for which a discrepancy of 0.2 dex between the logarithmiciron abundance derived from neutral and singly ionized lines may signaldepartures from lte. the chemical abundances of calcium, titanium, chromium,and iron derived with the empirical models from neutral lines do not differmuch from previous analyses based on flux-constant atmospheric structures.

astro-ph;9909081	abundance analyses of field rv stars, v: ds aquarii, uy arae, tw  camelopardis, bt librae, u moncerotis, tt ophiuchi, and rv tauri	abundance analyses are presented and discussed for eight rv tauri variables.the rv b star uy ara shows the abundance anomalies seen in other rv b stars,namely elements that condense into grains at high temperature are underabundantbut elements of low condensation temperature are much less underabundant. thispattern is ascribed to a separation of dust from gas with accretion of gas butnot dust by the atmosphere. abundances for two rv c stars with earlier resultsfor other rv c stars show that these intrinsically metal-poor stars do not showeffects of dust-gas separation. analyses of five rv a stars show that thesecooler stars are very largely unaffected by dust-gas separation. it is proposedthat the deeper convective envelope of cooler stars dilutes anomalies resultingfrom dust-gas separation - the dusty wind off the rv tauri variable or a dustycircumbinary disk - are reviewed and observational tests are suggested.

astro-ph;9911002	fundamental parameters of nearby stars from the comparison with  evolutionary calculations: masses, radii and effective temperatures	the hipparcos mission has made it possible to constrain the positions ofnearby field stars in the colour-magnitude diagram with very high accuracy.these positions can be compared with the predictions of stellar evolutionarycalculations to provide information on the basic parameters of the stars:masses, radii, effective temperatures, ages, and chemical composition.  the degeneracy between mass, age, and metallicity is not so large as toprevent a reliable estimate of masses, radii and effective temperatures, atleast for stars of solar metallicity. the evolutionary models of bertelli etal. (1994) predict those parameters finely, and furthermore, the appliedtransformation from the theoretical (log g-teff) to the observational (mv-b-v)plane is precise enough to derive radii with an uncertainty of ~ 6%, masseswithin ~ 8%, and teffs within ~ 2% for a certain range of the stellarparameters. this is demonstrated by means of comparison with the measurementsin eclipsing binaries and the infrared flux method.  the application of the interpolation procedure in the theoretical isochronesto the stars within 100 pc from the sun observed with hipparcos providesestimates for 17,219 stars
