0706.2566	an anomaly detector with immediate feedback to hunt for planets of earth  mass and below by microlensing	(abridged) the discovery of ogle 2005-blg-390lb, the first cool rocky/icyexoplanet, impressively demonstrated the sensitivity of the microlensingtechnique to extra-solar planets below 10 m_earth. a planet of 1 m_earth in thesame spot would have provided a detectable deviation with an amplitude of ~ 3 %and a duration of ~ 12 h. an early detection of a deviation could triggerhigher-cadence sampling which would have allowed the discovery of an earth-massplanet in this case. here, we describe the implementation of an automatedanomaly detector, embedded into the estar system, that profits from immediatefeedback provided by the robotic telescopes that form the robonet-1.0 network.it went into operation for the 2007 microlensing observing season. as part ofour discussion about an optimal strategy for planet detection, we shed some newlight on whether concentrating on highly-magnified events is promising andplanets in the 'resonant' angular separation equal to the angular einsteinradius are revealed most easily. given that sub-neptune mass planets can beconsidered being common around the host stars probed by microlensing(preferentially m- and k-dwarfs), the higher number of events that can bemonitored with a network of 2m telescopes and the increased detectionefficiency for planets below 5 m_earth arising from an optimized strategy givesa common effort of current microlensing campaigns a fair chance to detect anearth-mass planet (from the ground) ahead of the corot or kepler missions. thedetection limit of gravitational microlensing extends even below 0.1 m_earth,but such planets are not very likely to be detected from current campaigns.however, these will be within the reach of high-cadence monitoring with anetwork of wide-field telescopes or a space-based telescope.

0903.4559	effects of dark matter substructures on gravitational lensing: results  from the aquarius simulations	we use high-resolution aquarius simulations of milky way-sized haloes in thelcdm cosmology to study the effects of dark matter substructures ongravitational lensing. each halo is resolved with ~ 10^8 particles (at a massresolution ~ 10^3-4 m_sun/h) within its virial radius. subhaloes with masseslarger than 10^5 m_sun/h are well resolved, an improvement of at least twoorders of magnitude over previous lensing studies. we incorporate a baryoniccomponent modelled as a hernquist profile and account for the response of thedark matter via adiabatic contraction. we focus on the "anomalous" flux ratioproblem, in particular on the violation of the cusp-caustic relation due tosubstructures. we find that subhaloes with masses less than ~ 10^8 m_sun/h playan important role in causing flux anomalies; such low mass subhaloes have beenunresolved in previous studies. there is large scatter in the predicted fluxratios between different haloes and between different projections of the samehalo. in some cases, the frequency of predicted anomalous flux ratios iscomparable to that observed for the radio lenses, although in most cases it isnot. the probability for the simulations to reproduce the observed violationsof the cusp lenses is about 0.001. we therefore conclude that the amount ofsubstructure in the central regions of the aquarius haloes is insufficient toexplain the observed frequency of violations of the cusp-caustic relation.these conclusions are based purely on our dark matter simulations which ignorethe effect of baryons on subhalo survivability.

0908.2427	properties of long gamma-ray burst host galaxies in cosmological  simulation	we use galaxy catalogues constructed by combining high-resolution n-bodysimulations with semi-analytic models of galaxy formation to study theproperties of long gamma-ray burst (lgrb) host galaxies. we assume that lgrbsoriginate from the death of massive young stars and analyse how results areaffected by different metallicity constraints on the progenitor stars. asexpected, the host sample with no metallicity restriction on the progenitorstars provides a perfect tracer of the cosmic star formation history. whenlgrbs are required to be generated by low-metallicity stars, they trace adecreasing fraction of the cosmic star formation rate at lower redshift, as aconsequence of the global increase in metallicity. we study the properties ofhost galaxies up to high redshift (~9), finding that they typically havelow-metallicity (z&lt;0.5 z_sun) and that they are small (m&lt;10^9 m_sun), bluer andyounger than the average galaxy population, in agreement with observationaldata. they are also less clustered than typical l_* galaxies in the universe,and their descendents are massive, red and reside in groups of galaxies withhalo mass between 10^{13} m_sun to 10^{14} m_sun.

0910.4013	impacts of source properties on strong lensing by rich galaxy clusters	we use a high-resolution $n$-body simulation to investigate the influence ofbackground galaxy properties, including redshift, size, shape and clustering,on the efficiency of forming giant arcs by gravitational lensing of rich galaxyclusters. two large sets of ray-tracing simulations are carried out for 10massive clusters at two redshifts, i.e. $z_{\rm l} \sim 0.2$ and 0.3. thevirial mass ($m_{\rm vir}$) of the simulated lens clusters at $z\sim0.2$ rangesfrom $6.8\times10^{14} h^{-1} {m_{\odot}}$ to $1.1\times 10^{15} h^{-1}m_{\odot}$. the information of background galaxies brighter than 25 magnitudein the $i$-band is taken from cosmological evolution survey (cosmos) imagingdata. around $1.7\times 10^5$ strong lensing realizations with these images asbackground galaxies have been performed for each set. we find that theefficiency for forming giant arcs for $z_{\rm l}=0.2$ clusters is broadlyconsistent with observations. the efficiency of producing giant arcs by richclusters is weakly dependent on the source size and clustering. our principalfinding is that a small proportion ($\sim 1/3$) of galaxies with elongatedshapes (e.g. ellipticity $\epsilon=1-b/a&gt;0.5$) can boost the number of giantarcs substantially. compared with recent studies where a uniform ellipticitydistribution from 0 to 0.5 is used for the sources, the adoption of directlyobserved shape distribution increases the number of giant arcs by a factor of$\sim2$. our results indicate that it is necessary to account for sourceinformation and survey parameters (such as point-spread-function, seeing) tomake correct predictions of giant arcs and further to constrain thecosmological parameters.(abridged)

0912.0614	satellites in the field and lens galaxies: sdss/cosmos vs. slacs/class	the incidence of sub-galactic level substructures is an important quantity,as it is a generic prediction of high-resolution cold dark matter (cdm) modelswhich is susceptible to observational test. confrontation of theory withobservations is currently in an uncertain state. in particular, gravitationallens systems appear to show evidence for flux ratio anomalies, which areexpected from cdm substructures although not necessarily in the same range ofradius as observed. however, the current small samples of lenses suggest thatthe lens galaxies in these systems are unusually often accompanied by luminousgalaxies. here we investigate a large sample of unlensed elliptical galaxiesfrom the cosmos survey, and determine the fraction of objects with satellites,in excess of background counts, as a function of satellite brightness andseparation from the primary object. we find that the incidence of luminoussatellites within 20 kpc is typically a few tenths of one percent forsatellites of a few tenths of the primary flux, comparable to what is observedfor the wider but shallower sdss survey. although the environments of lenses inthe slacs survey are compatible with this observation, the class radio surveylenses are significantly in excess of this.

1001.3349	euclid : dark universe probe and microlensing planet hunter	there is a remarkable synergy between requirements for dark energy probes bycosmic shear measurements and planet hunting by microlensing. employing weakand strong gravitational lensing to trace and detect the distribution of matteron cosmic and galactic scales, but as well as to the very small scales ofexoplanets is a unique meeting point from cosmology to exoplanets. it will usegravity as the tool to explore the full range of masses not accessible by anyother means. euclid is a 1.2m telescope with optical and ir wide field imagersand slitless spectroscopy, proposed to esa cosmic vision to probe for darkenergy, baryonic acoustic oscillation, galaxy evolution, and an exoplanet huntvia microlensing. a 3 months microlensing program will already efficientlyprobe for planets down to the mass of mars at the snow line, for free floatingterrestrial or gaseous planets and habitable super earth. a 12+ months surveywould give a census on habitable earth planets around solar like stars. this isthe perfect complement to the statistics that will be provided by the keplersatellite, and these missions combined will provide a full census of extrasolarplanets from hot, warm, habitable, frozen to free floating.

1004.3094	substructure lensing: effects of galaxies, globular clusters &amp; satellite  streams	lensing flux-ratio anomalies have been frequently observed and taken asevidence for the presence of abundant dark matter substructures in lensinggalaxies, as predicted by the cold dark matter (cdm) model of cosmogony. inprevious work, we examined the cusp-caustic relations of the multiple images ofbackground quasars lensed by galaxy-scale dark matter haloes, using a suite ofhigh-resolution n-body simulations (the aquarius simulations). in this work, weextend our previous calculations to incorporate both the baryonic and diffusedark components in lensing haloes. we include in each lensing simulation: (1) asatellite galaxy population derived from a semi-analytic model applied to theaquarius haloes, (2) an empirical milky-way globular cluster population and (3)satellite streams (diffuse dark component) identified in the simulations.accounting for these extra components, we confirm our earlier conclusion thatthe abundance of intrinsic substructures (dark or bright, bound or diffuse) isnot sufficient to explain the observed frequency of cusp-caustic violations inthe class survey. we conclude that the observed effect could be the result ofthe small number statistics of class, or intergalactic haloes along the line ofsight acting as additional sources of lensing flux anomalies. anotherpossibility is that this discrepancy signals a failure of the cdm model.

1109.4612	influence of baryons on the orbital structure of dark matter haloes	we explore the dynamical signatures imprinted by baryons on dark matterhaloes during the formation process using the overwhelmingly large simulations(owls), a set of state-of-the-art high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamicalsimulations. we present a detailed study of the effects of the implementedfeedback prescriptions on the orbits of dark matter particles, stellarparticles and subhaloes, analysing runs with no feedback, with stellar feedbackand with feedback from supermassive black holes. we focus on the centralregions (0.25 r_{200}) of haloes with virial masses ~ 6 x 10^{13} (~ 7 x10^{11}) msun/h at z = 0(2). we also investigate how the orbital content(relative fractions of the different orbital types) of these haloes depends onseveral key parameters such as their mass, redshift and dynamical state. theresults of spectral analyses of the orbital content of these simulations arecompared, and the change in fraction of box, tube and irregular orbits isquantified. box orbits are found to dominate the orbital structure of darkmatter haloes in cosmological simulations. there is a strong anticorrelationbetween the fraction of box orbits and the central baryon fraction. whileradiative cooling acts to reduce the fraction of box orbits, strong feedbackimplementations result in a similar orbital distribution to that of the darkmatter only case. the orbital content described by the stellar particles isfound to be remarkably similar to that drawn from the orbits of dark matterparticles, suggesting that either they have forgotten their dynamical history,or that subhaloes bringing in stars are not biased significantly with respectto the main distribution. the orbital content of the subhaloes is in broadagreement with that seen in the outer regions of the particle distributions.

1202.6490	molecular gas in infrared ultraluminous qso hosts	we report co detections in 17 out of 19 infrared ultraluminous qso (ir qso)hosts observed with the iram 30m telescope. the cold molecular gas reservoir inthese objects is in a range of 0.2--2.1$\times 10^{10}m_\odot$ (adopting aco-to-${\rm h_2}$ conversion factor $\alpha_{\rm co}=0.8 m_\odot {\rm (k kms^{-1} pc^2)^{-1}}$). we find that the molecular gas properties of ir qsos,such as the molecular gas mass, star formation efficiency ($l_{\rmfir}/l^\prime_{\rm co}$) and the co (1-0) line widths, are indistinguishablefrom those of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs). a comparison oflow- and high-redshift co detected qsos reveals a tight correlation betweenl$_{\rm fir}$ and $l^\prime_{\rm co(1-0)}$ for all qsos. this suggests that,similar to ulirgs, the far-infrared emissions of all qsos are mainly from dustheated by star formation rather than by active galactic nuclei (agns),confirming similar findings from mid-infrared spectroscopic observations by{\it spitzer}. a correlation between the agn-associated bolometric luminositiesand the co line luminosities suggests that star formation and agns draw fromthe same reservoir of gas and there is a link between star formation on $\sim$kpc scale and the central black hole accretion process on much smaller scales.

1206.5296	exels: an exoplanet legacy science proposal for the esa euclid mission  i. cold exoplanets	euclid is the second m-class mission of the esa cosmic vision programme, withthe principal science goal of studying dark energy. euclid is also expected toundertake additional legacy science programmes. one proposal is the exoplaneteuclid legacy survey (exels) which will be the first survey able to measure theabundance of exoplanets down to earth mass for host separations from ~1au outto the free-floating (unbound) regime. the cold and free-floating exoplanetregimes represent a crucial discovery space for testing planet formationtheories. exels will use the gravitational microlensing technique and willdetect 1000 microlensing events per month over 1.6 deg^2 of the galactic bulge.we assess how many of these events will have detectable planetary signaturesusing a detailed multi-wavelength microlensing simulator (mabuls) whichincorporates the besancon galactic model with 3d extinction. mabuls is thefirst theoretical simulation of microlensing to treat the effects of pointspread function (psf) blending self-consistently with the underlying galacticmodel. we use mabuls, together with current numerical models for the euclidpsfs, to explore a number of designs and de-scope options for exels, includingthe exoplanet yield as a function of filter choice and slewing time, and theeffect of systematic photometry errors. using conservative extrapolations ofcurrent empirical exoplanet mass functions determined from ground-basedmicrolensing and radial velocity surveys, exels can expect to detect a fewhundred cold exoplanets around mainly g, k and m-type stellar hosts, including~45 earth-mass planets and ~6 mars-mass planets for an observing programmetotalling 10 months. exels will be capable of measuring the cold exoplanet massfunction down to earth mass or below, with orbital separations from ~1au to thefree-floating regime.

1305.0337	photometric properties and luminosity function of nearby massive  early-type galaxies	we perform photometric analyses for a bright early-type galaxy (etg) samplewith 2949 galaxies ($m_{\rm r}&lt;-22.5$ mag) in the redshift range of 0.05 to0.15, drawn from the sdss dr7 with morphological classification from galaxy zoo1. we measure the petrosian and isophotal magnitudes, as well as thecorresponding half-light radius for each galaxy. we find that for brightestgalaxies ($m_{\rm r}&lt;-23$ mag), our petrosian magnitudes, and isophotalmagnitudes to 25 ${\rm mag/arcsec^2}$ and 1\% of the sky brightness are onaverage 0.16 mag, 0.20 mag, and 0.26 mag brighter than the sdss petrosianvalues, respectively. in the first case the underestimations are caused byoverestimations in the sky background by the sdss photo algorithm, while thelatter two are also due to deeper photometry. similarly, the typical half-lightradii ($r_{50}$) measured by the sdss algorithm are smaller than ourmeasurements. as a result, the bright-end of the $r$-band luminosity functionis found to decline more slowly than previous works. our measured luminositydensities at the bright end are more than one order of magnitude higher thanthose of blanton et al. (2003), and the stellar mass densities at $m_{\ast}\sim5\times10^{11} m_{\odot}$ and $m_{\ast}\sim 10^{12} m_{\odot}$ are a few tenthsand a factor of few higher than those of bernardi et al. (2010). these resultsmay significantly alleviate the tension in the assembly of massive galaxiesbetween observations and predictions of the hierarchical structure formationmodel.

1410.0363	exels: an exoplanet legacy science proposal for the esa euclid mission.  ii. hot exoplanets and sub-stellar systems	the exoplanet euclid legacy survey (exels) proposes to determine thefrequency of cold exoplanets down to earth mass from host separations of ~1 auout to the free-floating regime by detecting microlensing events in galacticbulge. we show that exels can also detect large numbers of hot, transitingexoplanets in the same population. the combined microlensing+transit surveywould allow the first self-consistent estimate of the relative frequencies ofhot and cold sub-stellar companions, reducing biases in comparing "near-field"radial velocity and transiting exoplanets with "far-field" microlensingexoplanets. the age of the bulge and its spread in metallicity further allowsexels to better constrain both the variation of companion frequency withmetallicity and statistically explore the strength of star-planet tides.  we conservatively estimate that exels will detect ~4100 sub-stellar objects,with sensitivity typically reaching down to neptune-mass planets. of these,~600 will be detectable in both euclid's vis (optical) channel and nisp h-bandimager, with ~90% of detections being hot jupiters. likely scenarios predict arange of 2900-7000 for vis and 400-1600 for h-band. twice as many can beexpected in vis if the cadence can be increased to match the 20-minute h-bandcadence. the separation of planets from brown dwarfs via doppler boosting orellipsoidal variability will be possible in a handful of cases. radial velocityconfirmation should be possible in some cases, using 30-metre-class telescopes.we expect secondary eclipses, and reflection and emission from planets to bedetectable in up to ~100 systems in both vis and nisp-h. transits of ~500planetary-radius companions will be characterised with two-colour photometryand ~40 with four-colour photometry (vis,yjh), and the albedo of (and emissionfrom) a large sample of hot jupiters in the h-band can be exploredstatistically.

astro-ph;0004069	analytic time delays and h_0 estimates for gravitational lenses	we study gravitational lens time delays for a general family of lensingpotentials, which includes the popular singular isothermal elliptical potentialand singular isothermal elliptical density distribution but allows generalangular structure. using a novel approach, we show that the time delay can becast in a very simple form, depending only on the observed image positions.including an external shear changes the time delay proportional to the shearstrength, and varying the radial profile of the potential changes the timedelay approximately linearly. these analytic results can be used to obtainsimple estimates of the time delay and the hubble constant in observedgravitational lenses. the naive estimates for four of five time delay lensesshow surprising agreement with each other and with local measurements of h_0;the complicated q 0957+561 system is the only outlier. the agreement suggeststhat it is reasonable to use simple isothermal lens models to infer h_0,although it is still important to check this conclusion by examining detailedmodels and by measuring more lensing time delays.

astro-ph;0007011	the influence of central black holes on gravitational lenses	recent observations indicate that many if not all galaxies host massivecentral black holes. in this paper we explore the influence of black holes onthe lensing properties. we model the lens as an isothermal ellipsoid with afinite core radius plus a central black hole. we show that the presence of theblack hole substantially changes the critical curves and caustics. if the blackhole mass is above a critical value, then it will completely suppress thecentral images for all source positions. realistic central black holes likelyhave masses below this critical value. even in such sub-critical cases, theblack hole can suppress the central image when the source is inside a zone ofinfluence, which depends on the core radius and black hole mass. in thesub-critical cases, an additional image may be created by the black hole insome regions, which for some radio lenses may be detectable withhigh-resolution and large dynamic-range vlbi maps. the presence of centralblack holes should also be taken into account when one constrains the coreradius from the lack of central images in gravitational lenses.

astro-ph;0108214	parallax microlensing events in the ogle ii database toward the galactic  bulge	we present a systematic search for parallax microlensing events among a totalof 512 microlensing candidates in the ogle ii database for the 1997-1999seasons. we fit each microlensing candidate with both the standard microlensingmodel and also a parallax model that accounts for the earth's motion around thesun. we then search for the parallax signature by comparing the chi^2 of thestandard and parallax models. for the events which show a significantimprovement, we further use the `duration' of the event and the signal-to-noiseratio as criteria to separate true parallax events from other noisymicrolensing events. we have discovered one convincing new candidate,sc33_4505, and seven other marginal cases. the convincing candidate (sc33_4505)is caused by a slow-moving, and likely low-mass, object, similar to other knownparallax events. we found that irregular sampling and gaps between observingseasons hamper the recovery of parallax events. we have also searched forlong-duration events that do not show parallax signatures. the lack of parallaxeffects in a microlensing event puts a lower-limit on the einstein radiusprojected onto the observer plane, which in turn imposes a lower limit on thelens mass divided by the relative lens-source parallax. most of the constraintsare however quite weak.

astro-ph;0112108	galaxy formation in preheated intergalactic media	we outline a scenario of galaxy formation in which the gas in galaxy-formingregions was preheated to high entropy by vigorous energy feedback associatedwith the formation of stars in old ellipticals and bulges and with agnactivity. such preheating likely occurred at redshifts z ~ 2-3, and can producethe entropy excess observed today in low-mass clusters of galaxies withoutdestroying the bulk of the lyman alpha forest. subsequent galaxy formation isaffected by the preheating, because the gas no longer follows the dark matteron galaxy scales. the hot gas around galaxy haloes has very shallow profilesand emits only weakly in the x-ray. cooling in a preheated halo is notinside-out, because the cooling efficiency does not change significantly withradius. only part of the gas in a protogalaxy region can cool and be accretedinto the final galaxy halo. the accreted gas is likely in diffuse clouds and sodoes not lose angular momentum to the dark matter. cluster ellipticals areproduced by mergers of stellar systems formed prior to the preheating, whilelarge galaxy disks form in low-density environments where gas accretion cancontinue to the present time.

astro-ph;0206503	optical gravitational lensing experiment. ogle-1999-bul-19: the first  multi-peak parallax event	we describe a highly unusual microlensing event, ogle-1999-bul-19, whichexhibits multiple peaks in its light curve. the einstein radius crossing timefor this event is approximately one year, which is unusually long. we show thatthe motion of the earth induces these multiple peaks in the light curve, sincethe relative transverse velocity of the lens projected into the observer planeis very small (v = 12.5 km/s). this is the lowest velocity so far published andwe believe that this is the first multiple-peak parallax event ever observed.we also believe that this event may be exhibiting slight binary-sourcesignatures in addition to these parallax-induced multiple peaks. withspectroscopic observations it is possible to test this `parallax plusbinary-source' hypothesis and (if this hypothesis turns out to be correct) tosimultaneously fit both models and obtain a measurement of the lens mass.furthermore, spectroscopic observations could also supply information regardingthe lens properties, possibly providing another avenue for determining the lensmass. we found that most of the i-band blending is probably caused by lightfrom the lens or a binary companion to the source. however, in the v-band,there appears to be a second blended source 0.35" away from the lensed source.hst observations will be very useful for understanding the nature of theblends. we also suggest that a radial velocity survey of all parallax eventswill be very useful for further constraining the lensing kinematics andunderstanding the origins of these events and the excess of long events towardthe bulge.

astro-ph;0210370	acceleration and parallax effects in gravitational microlensing	to generate the standard microlensing light curve one assumes that therelative motion of the source, the lens, and the observer is linear. inreality, the relative motion is likely to be more complicated due toaccelerations of the observer, the lens and the source. the simplestapproximation beyond the linear-motion assumption is to add a constantacceleration. microlensing light curves due to accelerations can be symmetricor asymmetric depending on the angle between the acceleration and the velocity.we show that it is possible that some of the previously reported shortermarginal parallax events can be reproduced with constant-acceleration models,while the longer, multi-year parallax events are ill-fitted by such models. wefind that there is a generic degeneracy inherent in constant-accelerationmicrolensing models. we also find that there is an equivalent degeneracy inparallax models, which manifests itself in short-duration events. theimportance of this new parallax degeneracy is illustrated with an example,using one of these marginal parallax events. our new analysis suggests thatanother of these previously suspected parallax candidate events may beexhibiting some weak binary-source signatures. if this turns out to be true,spectroscopic observations of the source could determine some parameters in themodel and may also constrain or even determine the lens mass. we also point outthat symmetric light curves with constant accelerations can mimic blended lightcurves, producing misleading einstein-radius crossing time-scales when fittedby the standard `blended' microlensing model; this may have some effect on theestimation of optical depth.

astro-ph;0301322	a brown dwarf microlens candidate in the ogle-ii database	we describe a unique mass determination for a microlensing event from thesecond phase of the optical gravitational microlensing experiment (ogle-ii).the event, sc26_2218, which is very bright (baseline magnitude i=15.10),appears to exhibit both parallax and finite source effects. the parallax effectallows us to determine the projected einstein radius on the observer plane(approx. 3.8 au), while the finite source effect allows us to determine theratio of the angular source size and the angular einstein radius. as theangular size of the star can be estimated using its color and magnitude, we canhence determine the angular einstein radius (approx. 0.1 mas). by combiningboth the projected and angular einstein radius we can determine the lens mass m= 0.050^{+0.016}_{-0.011} solar masses, independent of the source distance. thelens is therefore a brown dwarf candidate. however, the `parallax' signature isweak and so we cannot completely discount the possibility that these signaturesoriginate from binary rotation of the source (which would prevent any estimateof the lens mass), rather than parallax. however, this can be tested by futurespectroscopic observations. this event highlights the scientific returns forintense monitoring of bright microlensing events, since the parallax and finitesource effects can be more easily identified due to their high signal-to-noiseratios.

astro-ph;0302189	extrinsic radio variability of jvas/class gravitational lenses	we present flux-ratio curves of the fold and cusp (i.e. close multiple)images of six jvas/class gravitational lens systems. the data were obtainedover a period of 8.5 months in 2001 with the multi-element radio-linkedinterferometer network (merlin) at 5-ghz with 50 mas resolution, as part of amerlin key-project. even though the time delays between the fold and cuspimages are small (&lt;~1 day) compared to the time-scale of intrinsic sourcevariability, all six lens systems show evidence that suggests the presence ofextrinsic variability. in particular, the cusp images of b2045+265 -- regardedas the strongest case of the violation of the cusp relation (i.e. the sum ofthe magnifications of the three cusp images add to zero) -- show extrinsicvariations in their flux-ratios up to ~40 percent peak-to-peak on time scalesof several months. its low galactic latitude of b=-10 degree and aline-of-sight toward the cygnus superbubble region suggest that galacticscintillation is the most likely cause. the cusp images of b1422+231 at b=+69degree do not show strong extrinsic variability. galactic scintillation cantherefore cause significant scatter in the cusp and fold relations of someradio lens systems (up to 10 percent rms), even though these relations remainviolated when averaged over a &lt;~1 year time baseline.

astro-ph;0503172	is the number of giant arcs in lcdm consistent with observations?	we use high-resolution n-body simulations to study the galaxy-clustercross-sections and the abundance of giant arcs in the $\lambda$cdm model.clusters are selected from the simulations using the friends-of-friends method,and their cross-sections for forming giant arcs are analyzed. the backgroundsources are assumed to follow a uniform ellipticity distribution from 0 to 0.5and to have an area identical to a circular source with diameter $1\arcsec$. wefind that the optical depth scales as the source redshift approximately as$\tau_{1''} = 2.25 \times 10^{-6}/[1+(\zs/3.14)^{-3.42}]$ ($0.6&lt;\zs&lt;7$). theamplitude is about 50% higher for an effective source diameter of $0.5\arcsec$.the optimal lens redshift for giant arcs with the length-to-width ratio ($l/w$)larger than 10 increases from 0.3 for $\zs=1$, to 0.5 for $\zs=2$, and to0.7-0.8 for $\zs&gt;3$. the optical depth is sensitive to the source redshift, inqualitative agreement with wambsganss et al. (2004). however, our overalloptical depth appears to be only $\sim$ 10% to 70% of those from previousstudies. the differences can be mostly explained by different power spectrumnormalizations ($\sigma_8$) used and different ways of determining the $l/w$ratio. finite source size and ellipticity have modest effects on the opticaldepth. we also found that the number of highly magnified (with magnification$|\mu|&gt;10$) and ``undistorted'' images (with $l/w&lt;3$) is comparable to thenumber of giant arcs with $|\mu|&gt;10$ and $l/w&gt;10$. we conclude that ourpredicted rate of giant arcs may be lower than the observed rate, although theprecise `discrepancy' is still unclear due to uncertainties both in theory andobservations.

astro-ph;0504536	the nature of parallax microlensing events towards the galactic bulge	perhaps as many as 30 parallax microlensing events are known, thanks to theefforts of the macho, ogle, eros and moa experiments monitoring the bulge.using galactic models, we construct mock catalogues of microlensing lightcurves towards the bulge, allowing for the uneven sampling and observationalerror bars of the ogle-ii experiment. the fraction of parallax events withdelta chi^2 &gt; 50 in the ogle-ii database is around ~1%, though higher fractionsare reported by some other surveys. this is in accord with expectations fromstandard galactic models. the fraction of parallax events depends strongly onthe einstein crossing time (t_e), being less than 5% at t_e = 50 days butrising to 50% at t_e &gt; 1 yr. we find that the existence of parallax signaturesis essentially controlled by the acceleration of the observer normalised to theprojected einstein radius on the observer plane divided by t_e^2. theproperties of the parallax events - time-scales, projected velocities, sourceand lens locations - in our mock catalogues are analysed. typically, ~38% ofparallax events are caused by a disk star microlensing a bulge source, while\~33% are caused by a disk star microlensing a disk source (of these disksources, one sixth are at a distance of 5 kpc or less). there is a significantshift in mean time-scale from 32 d for all events to ~130d for our parallaxevents. there are corresponding shifts for other parameters, such as thelens-source velocity projected onto the observer plane (~1110 km/s for allevents versus ~80 km/s for parallax events) and the lens distance (6.7 kpcversus 3.7 kpc). we also assess the performance of parallax mass estimators andinvestigate whether our mock catalogue can reproduce events with featuressimilar to a number of conjectured `black hole' lens candidates.

astro-ph;0510179	interferometric visibility and closure phase of microlensing events with  finite source size	interferometers from the ground and space will be able to resolve the twoimages in a microlensing event. this will at least partially lift the inherentdegeneracy between physical parameters in microlensing events. to increase thesignal-to-noise ratio, intrinsically bright events with large magnificationswill be preferentially selected as targets. these events may be influenced byfinite source size effects both photometrically and astrometrically. usingobserved finite source size events as examples, we show that the fringevisibility can be affected by 5% - 10%, and the closure phase by a few degrees:readily detectable by ground and space interferometers. such detections willoffer unique information about the lens-source trajectory relative to thebaseline of the interferometers. combined with photometric finite source sizeeffects, interferometry offers a way to measure the angular sizes of the sourceand the einstein radius accurately.  limb-darkening changes the visibility by a small amount compared with asource with uniform surface brightness, marginally detectable with ground-basedinstruments.  we discuss the implications of our results for the plans to makeinterferometric observations of future microlensing events.

astro-ph;0603557	smoothing algorithms and high-order singularities in gravitational  lensing	we propose a new smoothing method for obtaining surface densities fromdiscrete particle positions from numerical simulations. this is an essentialstep for many applications in gravitational lensing. this method is based onthe ``scatter'' interpretation of the discrete density field in the smoothedparticle hydrodynamics. we use monte carlo simulations of uniform densityfields and one isothermal ellipsoid to empirically derive the noise properties,and best smoothing parameters (such as the number of nearest neighbors used). acluster from high-resolution simulations is then used to assess the reality ofhigh-order singularities such as swallowtails and butterflies in caustics,which are important for the interpretation of substructures in gravitationallenses. we also compare our method with the delaunay tesselation fieldestimator using the galaxy studied by bradac et al. (2004), and find goodagreements. we show that higher order singularities are not only connected withbound subhaloes but also with the satellite streams. however, the presence ofhigh-order singularities are sensitive to not only the fluctuation amplitude ofthe surface density, but also the detailed form of the underlying smoothlensing potential (such as ellipticity and external shear).

astro-ph;0607555	the influence of baryons on the mass distribution of dark matter halos	using a set of high-resolution n-body/sph cosmological simulations withidentical initial conditions but run with different numerical setups, weinvestigate the influence of baryonic matter on the mass distribution of darkhalos when radiative cooling is not included. we compare the concentrationparameters of about 400 massive halos with virial mass from $10^{13}$ \msun to$7.1 \times 10^{14}$ \msun. we find that the concentration parameters for thetotal mass and dark matter distributions in non radiative simulations are onaverage larger by ~3% and 10% than those in a pure dark matter simulation. ourresults indicate that the total mass density profile is little affected by ahot gas component in the simulations. after carefully excluding the effects ofresolutions and spurious two-body heating between dark matter and gasparticles, we conclude that the increase of the dark matter concentrationparameters is due to interactions between baryons and dark matter. wedemonstrate this with the aid of idealized simulations of two-body mergers. theresults of individual halos simulated with different mass resolutions show thatthe gas profiles of densities, temperature and entropy are subjects of massresolution of sph particles. in particular, we find that in the inner parts ofhalos, as the sph resolution increases the gas density becomes higher but boththe entropy and temperature decrease.

astro-ph;9707344	on the physical connections between galaxies of different types	galaxies can be classified in two broad sequences which are likely to reflecttheir formation mechanism. the `main sequence', consisting of spirals,irregulars and all dwarf galaxies, is probably produced by gas settling withindark matter haloes. we show that the sizes and surface densities along thissequence are primarily determined by the distributions of the angular momentumand formation time of dark haloes. they are well reproduced by currentcosmogonies provided that galaxies form late, at $z \la 2$. in this scenario,dwarf ellipticals were small `disks' at $z\sim 1$ and become `ellipticals'after they fall into cluster environments. the strong clustering of dwarfellipticals is then a natural by-product of the merging and transformationprocess. the number of dwarf galaxies predicted in a cluster such as virgo isin good agreement with the observed number. on the other hand, the `giantbranch', consisting of giant ellipticals and bulges, is probably produced bythe merging of disk galaxies. based on the observed phase-space densities ofgalaxies, we show that the main bodies of all giant ellipticals can be producedby dissipationless mergers of high-redshift disks. however, high-redshiftdisks, although denser than present-day ones, are still not compact enough toproduce the high central phase space density of some low-luminosityellipticals. dissipation must have occurred in the central parts of thesegalaxies during the merger which formed them.

0809.3134	luminous satellite galaxies in gravitational lenses	substructures, expected in cold dark matter haloes, have been proposed toexplain the anomalous flux ratios in gravitational lenses. about 25% of lensesin the cosmic lens all-sky survey (class) appear to have luminous satelliteswithin ~ 5 kpc/h of the main lensing galaxies, which are usually at redshift z~ 0.2-1. in this work we use the millennium simulation combined with galaxycatalogues from semi-analytical techniques to study the predicted frequency ofsuch satellites in simulated haloes. the fraction of haloes that host brightsatellites within the (projected) central regions is similar for red and bluehosts and is found to increase as a function of host halo mass and redshift.specifically, at z = 1, about 11% of galaxy-sized haloes (with masses between10^{12} m_sun/h and 10^{13} m_sun/h) host bright satellite galaxies within aprojected radius of 5 kpc/h. this fraction increases to about 17% (25%) if weconsider bright (all) satellites of only group-sized haloes (with massesbetween 10^{13} m_sun/h and 10^{14} m_sun/h). these results are roughlyconsistent with the fraction (~ 25%) of class lensing galaxies observed to hostluminous satellites. at z = 0, only ~ 3% of galaxy-sized haloes host brightsatellite galaxies. the fraction rises to ~ 6%, (10%) if we consider bright(all) satellites of only group-sized haloes at z = 0. however, most of thesatellites found in the inner regions are `orphan' galaxies where the darkmatter haloes have been completely stripped. thus the agreement cruciallydepends on the true survival rate of these `orphan' galaxies. we also discussthe effects of numerical resolution and cosmologies on our results.

astro-ph;9806231	detecting luminous gravitational microlenses using spectroscopy	we propose a new method to detect the gravitational lenses in the ongoingmicrolensing experiments using medium and high resolution spectroscopy(resolution &gt; 6000). since the radial velocity of the lens and lensed sourcetypically differs by ~100km/s, the spectral lines from the lens and source willbe shifted relative to each other by (1-2)a in the optical. we simulaterealistic composite spectra assuming different spectral types for the lens andsource and study the lens detectability as a function of the signal-to-noiseratio, spectral resolution and lens-to-source light ratio. we show that it ispossible to measure the difference in radial velocity from an unequivocalsignature in the difference of cross- and auto-correlation functions calculatedfrom two spectra obtained at different magnifications. if the lens is brighterthan 10% of the unmagnified source we find that a spectral resolution of ~6000and a signal-to-noise of 50 (at magnification maximum) are sufficient todetermine the relative radial velocity of the lens. at resolution ~40000, thespectral resolution of high resolution spectrographs of 8-10m class telescopes,the lens could even be detected at a brightness of ~3% of the source. radialvelocities higher than 50km/s can be measured with an accuracy of a few km/s.practical difficulties and observation strategies are also discussed.

astro-ph;9902182	the host galaxy of grb 990123	we present deep images of the field of gamma-ray burst (grb) 990123 obtainedin a broad-band uv/visible bandpass with the hubble space telescope, and deepnear-infrared images obtained with the keck-i 10-m telescope. both the hst andkeck images show that the optical transient (ot) is clearly offset by 0.6arcsec from an extended object, presumably the host galaxy. this galaxy is themost likely source of the metallic-line absorption at z = 1.6004 seen in thespectrum of the ot. with magnitudes v_{c} ~ 24.6 +/- 0.2 and k = 21.65 +/- 0.30mag this corresponds to an l ~ 0.7 l_* galaxy, assuming that it is located at z= 1.6. the estimated unobscured star formation rate is sfr ~ 6 m_sun/yr, whichis not unusually high for normal galaxies at comparable redshifts. the strengthof the observed metallic absorption lines is suggestive of a relatively highmetallicity of the gas, and thus of a chemically evolved system which may beassociated with a massive galaxy. it is also indicative of a high columndensity of the gas, typical of damped ly-alpha systems at high redshifts. weconclude that this is the host galaxy of grb 990123. no other obvious galaxiesare detected within the same projected radius from the ot. there is thus noevidence for strong gravitational lensing magnification of this burst, and somealternative explanation for its remarkable energetics may be required. theobserved offset of the ot from the center of its apparent host galaxy, 5.5 +/-0.9 proper kpc (projected) in the galaxy's rest-frame, both refutes thepossibility that grbs are related to galactic nuclear activity and supportsmodels of grbs which involve the death and/or merger of massive stars. further,the hst image suggests an intimate connection of grb 990123 and a star-formingregion.

astro-ph;9902339	an hst surface photometric study of ultraluminous infrared galaxies	we study the surface photometry for 13 single-nucleus ultraluminous irasgalaxies (ulirgs), selected from a parent sample of 58 galaxies obtained in ahubble space telescope snapshot survey. we find that these galaxies can beclassified into three classes according to their surface photometry. thesurface brightness profiles of the four objects in the first class are wellfitted by the r^{1/4} law. the isophotes are all disky at r &lt; 1 h^{-1}kpc,consistent with the molecular disks/rings found in nearby ulirgs from coobservations. each of the four galaxies in the second class has an innerr^{1/4} component plus an outer extension. remarkably all these four galaxiesare seyfert 1 galaxies with luminosities in the quasar regime and withrelatively narrow permitted and strong feii emission lines. the remaining fivegalaxies fall into the third class; these objects have surface brightnessprofiles that deviate to various degrees from the r^{1/4} law; indeed, one isfitted perfectly by an exponential law. we also present new spectroscopicobservations for some of these galaxies. we establish the redshift ofir09427+1929 to be 0.284, instead of 0.149 as adopted in the literature. theseobservations firmly support the idea that merging of disk galaxies produceellipticals. our data also strongly suggest that the formation of qsos may bean integral part of elliptical galaxy formation (at low redshifts).

astro-ph;9905202	the nature of the diffuse clumps and the x-ray companion of mrk 273	we present an optical spectrum for mrk 273x, the x-ray source 1.3' to thenortheast of mrk 273. the new spectrum indicates that the object is at a muchhigher redshift (0.458) than the value (0.0376) previously reported. all thedetected emission lines show properties of seyfert 2 galaxies. mrk 273x has oneof the highest x-ray and radio luminosities l_x ~ 1.1 x 10^{44} erg/s, l_{1.37ghz} ~ 2.0 x 10^{40} erg/s among seyfert 2 galaxies, yet it has a low neutralhydrogen column density, n_h ~ 4.4 x 10^{20}/cm^2. these properties seemdifficult to explain in the unified scheme of active galactic nuclei.  the spectrum previously used to identify the redshift for mrk 273x turns outto be for diffuse clumps in the northeast tail/plume about 20'' (~20 kpc inprojected distance) from the nuclear region of mrk 273. a new spectrum for thisregion was obtained; this spectrum is essentially the same as the previous one.these observations indicate that these clumps have the same redshift as mrk 273and are physically associated with the merger. the spectrum is dominated bystrong emission from the [o iii] doublet with seyfert 2-like line ratios, whichindicate that these northeast clumps are probably excited by the shock plusprecursor mechanism during the merging process. this mechanism may be operatingin other ultraluminous iras galaxies as well.

0811.2687	repeating microlensing events in the ogle data	microlensing events are usually selected among single-peaked non-repeatinglight curves in order to avoid confusion with variable stars. however, amicrolensing event may exhibit a second microlensing brightening episode whenthe source or/and the lens is a binary system. a careful analysis of theserepeating events provides an independent way to study the statistics of widebinary stars and to detect extrasolar planets. previous theoretical studiespredicted that 0.5 - 2 % of events should repeat due to wide binary lenses. wepresent a systematic search for such events in about 4000 light curves ofmicrolensing candidates detected by the optical gravitational lensingexperiment (ogle) towards the galactic bulge from 1992 to 2007. the searchreveals a total of 19 repeating candidates, with 6 clearly due to a wide binarylens. as a by-product we find that 64 events (~2% of the total ogle-iii sample)have been miss-classified as microlensing; these miss-classified events aremostly nova or other types of eruptive stars. the number and importance ofrepeating events will increase considerably when the next-generation wide-fieldmicrolensing experiments become fully operational in the future.
