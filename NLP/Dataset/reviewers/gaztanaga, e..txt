0901.2570	cosmological parameter constraints from sdss luminous red galaxies: a  new treatment of large-scale clustering	we apply a new model for the spherically averaged correlation function atlarge pair separations to the measurement of the clustering of luminous redgalaxies (lrgs) made from the sdss by cabre and gaztanaga(2009). our modeltakes into account the form of the bao peak and the large scale shape of thecorrelation function. we perform a monte carlo markov chain analysis fordifferent combinations of datasets and for different parameter sets. when usedin combination with a compilation of the latest cmb measurements, the lrgclustering and the latest supernovae results give constraints on cosmologicalparameters which are comparable and in remarkably good agreement, resolving thetension reported in some studies. the best fitting model in the context of aflat, lambda-cdm cosmology is specified by omega_m=0.261+-0.013,omega_b=0.044+-0.001, n_s=0.96+-0.01, h_0=71.6+-1.2 km/s/mpc andsigma_8=0.80+-0.02. if we allow the time-independent dark energy equation ofstate parameter to vary, we find results consistent with a cosmologicalconstant at the 5% level using all data sets: w_de=-0.97+-0.05. the large scalestructure measurements by themselves can constrain the dark energy equation ofstate parameter to w_de=-1.05+-0.15, independently of cmb or supernovae data.we do not find convincing evidence for an evolving equation of state. weprovide a set of "extended distance priors" that contain the most relevantinformation from the cmb power spectrum and the shape of the lrg correlationfunction which can be used to constrain dark energy models and spatialcurvature. our model should provide an accurate description of the clusteringeven in much larger, forthcoming surveys, such as those planned with nasa'sjdem or esa's euclid mission.

1006.3226	tracing the sound horizon scale with photometric redshift surveys	we propose a new method for cosmological parameters extraction using thebaryon acoustic oscillation scale as a standard ruler in deep galaxy surveyswith photometric determination of redshifts. the method consists in a simpleempirical parametric fit to the angular 2-point correlation function w(theta).it is parametrized as a power law to describe the continuum plus a gaussian todescribe the bao bump. the location of the gaussian is used as the basis forthe measurement of the sound horizon scale. this method, although simple,actually provides a robust estimation, since the inclusion of the power law andthe use of the gaussian removes the shifts which affect the local maximum. wediscuss the effects of projection bias, non-linearities, redshift spacedistortions and photo-z precision, and apply our method to a mock catalog ofthe dark energy survey, built upon a large n-body simulation provided by themice collaboration. we discuss the main systematic errors associated to ourmethod and show that they are dominated by the photo-z uncertainty.

1104.5426	clustering of photometric luminous red galaxies ii: cosmological  implications from the baryon acoustic scale	a new determination of the sound horizon scale in angular coordinates ispresented. it makes use of ~ 0.6 x 10^6 luminous red galaxies, selected fromthe sloan digital sky survey imaging data, with photometric redshifts. theanalysis covers a redshift interval that goes from z=0.5 to z=0.6. we findevidence of the baryon acoustic oscillations (bao) signal at the ~ 2.3 sigmaconfidence level, with a value of theta_{bao} (z=0.55) = (3.90 \pm 0.38)degrees, including systematic errors. to our understanding, this is the firstdirect measurement of the angular bao scale in the galaxy distribution, and itis in agreement with previous bao measurements. we also show how radialdeterminations of the bao scale can break the degeneracy in the measurement ofcosmological parameters when they are combined with bao angular measurements.the result is also in good agreement with the wmap7 best-fit cosmology. weobtain a value of w_0 = -1.03 \pm 0.16 for the equation of state parameter ofthe dark energy, omega_m = 0.26 \pm 0.04 for the matter density, when the otherparameters are fixed. we have also tested the sensitivity of current baomeasurements to a time varying dark energy equation of state, finding w_a =0.06 \pm 0.22 if we fix all the other parameters to the wmap7 best-fitcosmology.

1109.4852	cross-correlation of spectroscopic and photometric galaxy surveys:  cosmology from lensing and redshift distortions	cosmological galaxy surveys aim at mapping the largest volumes to test modelswith techniques such as cluster abundance, cosmic shear correlations or baryonacoustic oscillations (bao), which are designed to be independent of galaxybias. here we explore an alternative route to constrain cosmology: samplingmore moderate volumes with the cross-correlation of photometric andspectroscopic surveys. we consider the angular galaxy-galaxy autocorrelation innarrow redshift bins and its combination with different probes of weakgravitational lensing (wl) and redshift space distortions (rsd). including thecross-correlation of these surveys improves by factors of a few the constraintson both the dark energy equation of state w(z) and the cosmic growth history,parametrized by \gamma. the additional information comes from using many narrowredshift bins and from galaxy bias, which is measured both with wl probes andrsd, breaking degeneracies that are present when using each method separately.we show forecasts for a joint w(z) and \gamma figure of merit using linearscales over a deep (i&lt;24) photometric survey and a brighter (i&lt;22.5)spectroscopic or very accurate (0.3%) photometric redshift survey.magnification or shear in the photometric sample produce fom that are of thesame order of magnitude of those of rsd or bao over the spectroscopic sample.however, the cross-correlation of these probes over the same area yields a fomthat is up to a factor 100 times larger. magnification alone, without shapemeasurements, can also be used for these cross-correlations and can producebetter results than using shear alone. for a spectroscopic follow-up surveystrategy, measuring the spectra of the foreground lenses to perform thiscross-correlation provides 5 times better fom than targeting the higherredshift tail of the galaxy distribution to study bao over a 2.5 times largervolume.

0711.1540	the onion universe: all sky lightcone simulations in spherical shells	galaxy surveys provide a large-scale view of the universe that typically hasa limited line-of-sight or redshift resolution. the lack of radial accuracy inthese surveys can be modelled by picturing the universe as a set of concentricradial shells of finite width around the observer, i.e, an onion-likestructure. we present a new n-body simulation with 2048^3 particles developedat the marenostrum supercomputer with the gadget-2 code. using the lightconeoutput we build a set of angular maps that mimic this onion-like representationof the universe. the onion maps are a highly compressed version of the raw data(i.e. a factor &gt;1000 smaller size for arcminute resolution maps) and theyprovide a new and powerful tool to exploit large scale structure observations.we introduce two basic applications of these maps that are especially usefulfor constraning dark energy properties: the baryon acoustic oscillations (bao)in the galaxy power spectrum and all-sky maps of the weak lensing distortion.using the weak lensing maps, we measure the convergence power spectra andcompare it to halo fit predictions. as a further application, we compute thevariance and higher-order moments of the maps. we show that sampling varianceon scales of few degrees is quite large, resulting in a significant (25% at 10arminute scales) bias in the variance. we caution that current lensing surveyssuch as the cosmos hst should take into account this bias and extra samplingerror in their clustering analyses and inferred cosmological parameterconstraints. finally, we test the importance of projection effects in the weaklensing mass reconstruction. on the mean, the mass calibration works well butit exhibits a large non-gaussian scatter what could induce a large bias in therecovered mass function.

1306.5236	star/galaxy separation at faint magnitudes: application to a simulated  dark energy survey	we address the problem of separating stars from galaxies in future largephotometric surveys. we focus our analysis on simulations of the dark energysurvey (des). in the first part of the paper, we derive the sciencerequirements on star/galaxy separation, for measurement of the cosmologicalparameters with the gravitational weak lensing and large scale structureprobes. these requirements are dictated by the need to control both thestatistical and systematic errors on the cosmological parameters, and by pointspread function calibration. we formulate the requirements in terms of thecompleteness and purity provided by a given star/galaxy classifier. in order toachieve these requirements at faint magnitudes, we propose a new method forstar/galaxy separation in the second part of the paper. we first use principalcomponent analysis to outline the correlations between the objects parametersand extract from it the most relevant information. we then use the reduced setof parameters as input to an artificial neural network. this multi-parameterapproach improves upon purely morphometric classifiers (such as the classifierimplemented in sextractor), especially at faint magnitudes: it increases thepurity by up to 20% for stars and by up to 12% for galaxies, at i-magnitudefainter than 23.

1312.2013	the mice grand challenge lightcone simulation ii: halo and galaxy  catalogues	this is the second in a series of three papers in which we present anend-to-end simulation from the mice collaboration, the mice grand challenge(mice-gc) run. the n-body contains about 70 billion dark-matter particles in a$(3 \, h^{-1} \, {\rm gpc})^3$ comoving volume spanning 5 orders of magnitudein dynamical range. here we introduce the halo and galaxy catalogues built uponit, both in a wide ($5000 \,{\rm deg}^2$) and deep ($z&lt;1.4$) light-cone and inseveral comoving snapshots. halos were resolved down to few $10^{11}\,h^{-1}\,{\rm m_{\odot}}$. this allowed us to model galaxies down to absolutemagnitude m$_r&lt;-18.9$. we used a new hybrid halo occupation distribution andabundance matching technique for galaxy assignment. the catalogue includes thespectral energy distributions of all galaxies. we describe a variety of haloand galaxy clustering applications. we discuss how mass resolution effects canbias the large scale $2$-pt clustering amplitude of poorly resolved halos atthe $\lesssim 5\%$ level, and their $3$-pt correlation function. we find acharacteristic scale dependent bias of $\lesssim 6\%$ across the bao featurefor halos well above $m_{\star}\sim 10^{12}\,h^{-1}\,{\rm m_{\odot}}$ and forlrg like galaxies. for halos well below $m_{\star}$ the scale dependence at$100\,{\rm mpc} h^{-1}$ is $\lesssim 2\%$. lastly we discuss the validity ofthe large-scale kaiser limit across redshift and departures from it towardsnonlinear scales. we make the current version of the light-cone halo and galaxycatalogue (micecatv1.0) publicly available through a dedicated web portal,http://cosmohub.pic.es, to help develop and exploit the new generation ofastronomical surveys.

1312.2947	the mice grand challenge lightcone simulation iii: galaxy lensing mocks  from all-sky lensing maps	in paper i of this series (fosalba et al. 2013), we presented a new n-bodylightcone simulation from the mice collaboration, the mice grand challenge(mice-gc), containing about 70 billion dark-matter particles in a (3 gpc)^3comoving volume, from which we built halo and galaxy catalogues using a halooccupation distribution and halo abundance matching technique, as presented inthe companion paper ii (crocce et al. 2013). given its large volume and finemass resolution, the mice-gc simulation also allows an accurate modeling of thelensing observables from upcoming wide and deep galaxy surveys. in the lastpaper of this series (paper iii), we describe the construction of all-skylensing maps, following the "onion universe" approach (fosalba et al. 2008),and discuss their properties in the lightcone up to z=1.4 with sub-arcminspatial resolution. by comparing the convergence power spectrum in the mice-gcto lower mass-resolution (i.e., particle mass ~ 10^11 msun) simulations, wefind that resolution effects are at the 5 % level for multipoles l ~ 10^3 and20 % for l ~ 10^4. resolution effects have a much lower impact on oursimulation, as shown by comparing the mice-gc to recent numerical fits bytakahashi et al 2012. we use the all-sky lensing maps to model galaxy lensingproperties, such as the convergence, shear, and lensed magnitudes andpositions, and validate them thoroughly using galaxy shear auto andcross-correlations in harmonic and configuration space. our results show thatthe galaxy lensing mocks here presented can be used to accurately model lensingobservables down to arcminute scales.

1405.4285	mass and galaxy distributions of four massive galaxy clusters from dark  energy survey science verification data	we measure the weak-lensing masses and galaxy distributions of four massivegalaxy clusters observed during the science verification phase of the darkenergy survey. this pathfinder study is meant to 1) validate the decam imagerfor the task of measuring weak-lensing shapes, and 2) utilize decam's largefield of view to map out the clusters and their environments over 90 arcmin. weconduct a series of rigorous tests on astrometry, photometry, image quality,psf modeling, and shear measurement accuracy to single out flaws in the dataand also to identify the optimal data processing steps and parameters. we findscience verification data from decam to be suitable for the lensing analysisdescribed in this paper. the psf is generally well-behaved, but the modeling isrendered difficult by a flux-dependent psf width and ellipticity. we employphotometric redshifts to distinguish between foreground and backgroundgalaxies, and a red-sequence cluster finder to provide cluster richnessestimates and cluster-galaxy distributions. by fitting nfw profiles to theclusters in this study, we determine weak-lensing masses that are in agreementwith previous work. for abell 3261, we provide the first estimates of redshift,weak-lensing mass, and richness. in addition, the cluster-galaxy distributionsindicate the presence of filamentary structures attached to 1e 0657-56 and rxcj2248.7-4431, stretching out as far as 1 degree (approximately 20 mpc),showcasing the potential of decam and des for detailed studies of degree-scalefeatures on the sky.

1405.5521	a prescription for galaxy biasing evolution as a nuisance parameter	there is currently no consistent approach to modelling galaxy bias evolutionin cosmological inference. this lack of a common standard makes the rigorouscomparison or combination of probes difficult. we show that the choice ofbiasing model has a significant impact on cosmological parameter constraintsfor a survey such as the dark energy survey (des), considering the 2-pointcorrelations of galaxies in five tomographic redshift bins. we find thatmodelling galaxy bias with a free biasing parameter per redshift bin gives afigure of merit (fom) for dark energy equation of state parameters w_0, w_asmaller by a factor of 10 than if a constant bias is assumed. an incorrect biasmodel will also cause a shift in measured values of cosmological parameters.motivated by these points and focusing on the redshift evolution of linearbias, we propose the use of a generalised galaxy bias which encompasses a rangeof bias models from theory, observations and simulations, b(z) = c + (b_0 -c)/d(z)^alpha, where parameters c, b_0 and alpha depend on galaxy propertiessuch as halo mass. for a des-like galaxy survey we find that this model givesan unbiased estimate of w_0, w_a with the same number or fewer nuisanceparameters and a higher fom than a simple b(z) model allowed to vary in z-bins.we show how the parameters of this model are correlated with cosmologicalparameters. we fit a range of bias models to two recent datasets, and concludethat this generalised parameterisation is a sensible benchmark expression ofgalaxy bias on large scales.

1406.4407	photometric redshift analysis in the dark energy survey science  verification data	we present results from a study of the photometric redshift performance ofthe dark energy survey (des), using the early data from a science verification(sv) period of observations in late 2012 and early 2013 that providedscience-quality images for almost 200 sq.~deg.~at the nominal depth of thesurvey. we assess the photometric redshift performance using about 15000galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts available from other surveys. thesegalaxies are used, in different configurations, as a calibration sample, andphoto-$z$'s are obtained and studied using most of the existing photo-$z$codes. a weighting method in a multi-dimensional color-magnitude space isapplied to the spectroscopic sample in order to evaluate the photo-$z$performance with sets that mimic the full des photometric sample, which is onaverage significantly deeper than the calibration sample due to the limiteddepth of spectroscopic surveys. empirical photo-$z$ methods using, forinstance, artificial neural networks or random forests, yield the bestperformance in the tests, achieving core photo-$z$ resolutions $\sigma_{68}\sim 0.08$. moreover, the results from most of the codes, including templatefitting methods, comfortably meet the des requirements on photo-$z$performance, therefore, providing an excellent precedent for future des datasets.

1407.3801	combining dark energy survey science verification data with near  infrared data from the eso vista hemisphere survey	we present the combination of optical data from the science verificationphase of the dark energy survey (des) with near infrared data from the esovista hemisphere survey (vhs). the deep optical detections from des are used toextract fluxes and associated errors from the shallower vhs data. joint 7-band($grizyjk$) photometric catalogues are produced in a single 3 sq-deg decamfield centred at 02h26m$-$04d36m where the availability of ancillarymulti-wavelength photometry and spectroscopy allows us to test the dataquality. dual photometry increases the number of des galaxies with measured vhsfluxes by a factor of $\sim$4.5 relative to a simple catalogue level matchingand results in a $\sim$1.5 mag increase in the 80\% completeness limit of thenir data. almost 70\% of des sources have useful nir flux measurements in thisinitial catalogue. photometric redshifts are estimated for a subset of galaxieswith spectroscopic redshifts and initial results, although currently limited bysmall number statistics, indicate that the vhs data can help reduce thephotometric redshift scatter at both $z&lt;0.5$ and $z&gt;1$. we present exampledes+vhs colour selection criteria for high redshift luminous red galaxies(lrgs) at $z\sim0.7$ as well as luminous quasars. using spectroscopicobservations in this field we show that the additional vhs fluxes enable acleaner selection of both populations with $&lt;$10\% contamination from galacticstars in the case of spectroscopically confirmed quasars and $&lt;0.5\%$contamination from galactic stars in the case of spectroscopically confirmedlrgs. the combined des+vhs dataset, which will eventually cover almost 5000sq-deg, will therefore enable a range of new science and be ideally suited fortarget selection for future wide-field spectroscopic surveys.

1411.3286	an algorithm to build mock galaxy catalogues using mice simulations	we present a method to build mock galaxy catalogues starting from a halocatalogue that uses halo occupation distribution (hod) recipes as well as thesubhalo abundance matching (sham) technique. combining both prescriptions weare able to push the absolute magnitude of the resulting catalogue to fainterluminosities than using just the sham technique and can interpret our resultsin terms of the hod modelling. we optimize the method by populating withgalaxies friends-of-friends dark matter haloes extracted from the marenostruminstitut de ci\`{e}ncies de l'espai (mice) dark matter simulations andcomparing them to observational constraints. our resulting mock galaxycatalogues manage to reproduce the observed local galaxy luminosity functionand the colour-magnitude distribution as observed by the sloan digital skysurvey. they also reproduce the observed galaxy clustering properties as afunction of luminosity and colour. in order to achieve that, the algorithm alsoincludes scatter in the halo mass - galaxy luminosity relation derived fromdirect sham and a modified nfw mass density profile to place satellite galaxiesin their host dark matter haloes. improving on general usage of the hod thatfits the clustering for given magnitude limited samples, our catalogues areconstructed to fit observations at all luminosities considered and thereforefor any luminosity subsample. overall, our algorithm is an economic procedureof obtaining galaxy mock catalogues down to faint magnitudes that are necessaryto understand and interpret galaxy surveys.

1507.05360	galaxy clustering, photometric redshifts and diagnosis of systematics in  the des science verification data	we study the clustering of galaxies detected at $i&lt;22.5$ in the scienceverification observations of the dark energy survey (des). two-pointcorrelation functions are measured using $2.3\times 10^6$ galaxies over acontiguous 116 deg$^2$ region in five bins of photometric redshift width$\delta z = 0.2$ in the range $0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.2.$ the impact of photometricredshift errors are assessed by comparing results using a template-basedphoto-$z$ algorithm (bpz) to a machine-learning algorithm (tpz). a companionpaper (leistedt et al 2015) presents maps of several observational variables(e.g. seeing, sky brightness) which could modulate the galaxy density. here wecharacterize and mitigate systematic errors on the measured clustering whicharise from these observational variables, in addition to others such asgalactic dust and stellar contamination. after correcting for systematiceffects we measure galaxy bias over a broad range of linear scales relative tomass clustering predicted from the planck $\lambda$cdm model, finding agreementwith cfhtls measurements with $\chi^2$ of 4.0 (8.7) with 5 degrees of freedomfor the tpz (bpz) redshifts. we test a "linear bias" model, in which the galaxyclustering is a fixed multiple of the predicted non-linear dark-matterclustering. the precision of the data allow us to determine that the linearbias model describes the observed galaxy clustering to $2.5\%$ accuracy down toscales at least $4$ to $10$ times smaller than those on which linear theory isexpected to be sufficient.

1507.05647	mapping and simulating systematics due to spatially-varying observing  conditions in des science verification data	spatially-varying depth and characteristics of observing conditions, such asseeing, airmass, or sky background, are major sources of systematicuncertainties in modern galaxy survey analyses, in particular in deepmulti-epoch surveys. we present a framework to extract and project thesesources of systematics onto the sky, and apply it to the dark energy survey(des) to map the observing conditions of the science verification (sv) data.the resulting distributions and maps of sources of systematics are used inseveral analyses of des sv to perform detailed null tests with the data, andalso to incorporate systematics in survey simulations. we illustrate thecomplementarity of these two approaches by comparing the sv data with thebcc-ufig, a synthetic sky catalogue generated by forward-modelling of the dessv images. we analyse the bcc-ufig simulation to construct galaxy samplesmimicking those used in sv galaxy clustering studies. we show that thespatially-varying survey depth imprinted in the observed galaxy densities andthe redshift distributions of the sv data are successfully reproduced by thesimulation and well-captured by the maps of observing conditions. the combineduse of the maps, the sv data and the bcc-ufig simulation allows us to quantifythe impact of spatial systematics on $n(z)$, the redshift distributionsinferred using photometric redshifts. we conclude that spatial systematics inthe sv data are mainly due to seeing fluctuations and are under control incurrent clustering and weak lensing analyses. the framework presented here isrelevant to all multi-epoch surveys, and will be essential for exploitingfuture surveys such as the large synoptic survey telescope (lsst), which willrequire detailed null-tests and realistic end-to-end image simulations tocorrectly interpret the deep, high-cadence observations of the sky.

1507.05909	redshift distributions of galaxies in the des science verification shear  catalogue and implications for weak lensing	we present photometric redshift estimates for galaxies used in the weaklensing analysis of the dark energy survey science verification (des sv) data.four model- or machine learning-based photometric redshift methods -- annz2,bpz calibrated against bcc-ufig simulations, skynet, and tpz -- are analysed.for training, calibration, and testing of these methods, we construct acatalogue of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies matched against des sv data.the performance of the methods is evaluated against the matched spectroscopiccatalogue, focusing on metrics relevant for weak lensing analyses, withadditional validation against cosmos photo-zs. from the galaxies in the des svshear catalogue, which have mean redshift $0.72\pm0.01$ over the range$0.3&lt;z&lt;1.3$, we construct three tomographic bins with means of $z=\{0.45, 0.67,1.00\}$. these bins each have systematic uncertainties $\delta z \lesssim 0.05$in the mean of the fiducial skynet photo-z $n(z)$. we propagate the errors inthe redshift distributions through to their impact on cosmological parametersestimated with cosmic shear, and find that they cause shifts in the value of$\sigma_8$ of approx. 3%. this shift is within the one sigma statistical errorson $\sigma_8$ for the des sv shear catalog. we further study the potentialimpact of systematic differences on the critical surface density,$\sigma_{\mathrm{crit}}$, finding levels of bias safely less than thestatistical power of des sv data. we recommend a final gaussian prior for thephoto-z bias in the mean of $n(z)$ of width $0.05$ for each of the threetomographic bins, and show that this is a sufficient bias model for thecorresponding cosmology analysis.

1508.03622	eight ultra-faint galaxy candidates discovered in year two of the dark  energy survey	we report the discovery of eight new ultra-faint dwarf galaxy candidates inthe second year of optical imaging data from the dark energy survey (des). sixof these candidates are detected at high confidence, while two lower-confidencecandidates are identified in regions of non-uniform survey coverage. the newstellar systems are found by three independent automated search techniques andare identified as overdensities of stars, consistent with the isochrone andluminosity function of an old and metal-poor simple stellar population. the newsystems are faint (mv &gt; -4.7 mag) and span a range of physical sizes (17 pc &lt;$r_{1/2}$ &lt; 181 pc) and heliocentric distances (25 kpc &lt; d &lt; 214 kpc). all ofthe new systems have central surface brightnesses consistent with knownultra-faint dwarf galaxies (\mu &lt; 27.5 mag arcsec$^{-2}$). roughly half of thedes candidates are more distant, less luminous, and/or have lower surfacebrightnesses than previously known milky way satellite galaxies. most of thecandidates are found in the southern part of the des footprint close to themagellanic clouds. we find that the des data alone exclude (p &lt; 0.001) aspatially isotropic distribution of milky way satellites and that the observeddistribution can be well, though not uniquely, described by an associationbetween several of the des satellites and the magellanic system. our modelpredicts that the full sky may hold ~100 ultra-faint galaxies with physicalproperties comparable to the des satellites and that 20-30% of these would bespatially associated with the magellanic clouds.

0807.0535	measuring baryon acoustic oscillations along the line of sight with  photometric redshifs: the pau survey	baryon acoustic oscillations (bao) provide a standard ruler of known physicallength, making it a promising probe of the nature of dark energy. the detectionof bao requires measuring galaxy positions and redshifts. "transversal"(angular distance) bao measure the angular size of this scale, while"line-of-sight" (or "radial") bao require precise redshifts, but provide adirect measurement of the hubble parameter at different redshifts, a moresensitive probe of dark energy. the main goal of this paper is to show that aprecision of sigma_z ~0.003(1 + z) is sufficient to measure bao in the radialdirection. this precision can be achieved for bright, red galaxies, by using afilter system comprising about 40 filters, each with a width of ~100 a, from ~4000 a to ~ 8000 a, supplemented by two broad-band filters. we describe apractical implementation, a new galaxy survey, pau, to be carried out with atelescope/camera combination with an etendue of about 20 m^2deg^2, and covering8000 sq. deg. in the sky in four years. we expect to measure positions andredshifts for over 14 million red, early-type galaxies with l &gt; l* and i_ab &lt;22.5 in the interval 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.9, with sigma_z &lt; 0.003(1 + z). thispopulation has a number density n &gt; 10^-3 mpc^-3 h^3 within the 9 (gpc/h)^3volume of the survey, ensuring that the error in the determination of the baoscale is not limited by shot-noise. by itself, such a survey will deliverprecisions of order 5% in the dark-energy equation of state parameter w, ifassumed constant, and can determine its time derivative when combined withfuture cmb measurements. in addition, pau will yield high-quality redshift andlow-resolution spectroscopy for hundreds of millions of other galaxies.

astro-ph;0305327	3-point temperature anisotropies in wmap: limits on cmb  non-gaussianities and non-linearities	we present a study of the 3-pt angular correlation function w_3= &lt;delta_1delta_2 delta_3&gt; of (adimensional) temperature anisotropies measured by thewilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap). results can be normalized to the2-point function w_2 = &lt;delta_1 delta_2&gt; in terms of the hierarchical: q_3 ~w_3/w_2^2 or dimensionless: d_3 ~ w_2/w_2^{3/2}$ amplitudes. stronglynon-gaussian models are generically expected to show d_3 &gt; 1 or q_3 &gt; 10^3 d_3.unfortunately, this is comparable to the cosmic variance on large angularscales. for gaussian primordial models, q_3 gives a direct measure of thenon-linear corrections to temperature anisotropies in the sky: delta = delta_l+ f_{nlt} (delta_l^2 - &lt;delta_l^2&gt;) with f_{nlt} = q_3/2 for the leading orderterm in w_2^2. we find good agreement with the gaussian hypothesis d_3 ~ 0within the cosmic variance of lcdm simulations (with or without a lowquadrupole). the strongest constraints on q_3 come from scales smaller than 1degree. we find q_3 =19 +/-141 for (pseudo) collapsed configurations and anaverage of q_3 = 336 +/-218 for non-collapsed triangles. the correspondingnon-linear coupling parameter, f_{nl}, for curvature perturbations phi, in thesachs-wolfe (sw) regime is: f_{nl}^{sw} = q_3/6, while on degree scales, theextra power in acoustic oscillations produces f_{nl} ~ q_3/30 in the lcm model.errors are dominated by cosmic variance, but for the first time they begin tobe small enough to constrain the leading order non-linear effects with couplingof order unity.

astro-ph;0401405	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: hierarchical galaxy clustering	we use the two-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) to test thehierarchical scaling hypothesis: namely, that the $p$-point galaxy correlationfunctions can be written in terms of the two point correlation function orvariance. this scaling is expected if an initially gaussian distribution ofdensity fluctuations evolves under the action of gravitational instability. wemeasure the volume averaged $p$-point correlation functions using a counts incells technique applied to a volume limited sample of 44,931 $l_*$ galaxies. wedemonstrate that $l_{*}$ galaxies display hierarchical clustering up to order$p=6$ in redshift space. the variance measured for $l_{*}$ galaxies is inexcellent agreement with the predictions from a $\lambda$-cold dark mattern-body simulation. this applies to all cell radii considered,$0.3&lt;(r/h^{-1}{\rm mpc})&lt;30$. however, the higher order correlation functionsof $l_*$ galaxies have a significantly smaller amplitude than is predicted forthe dark matter for $r&lt;10h^{-1}$mpc. this disagreement implies that anon-linear bias exists between the dark matter and $l_*$ galaxies on thesescales. we also show that the presence of two rare, massive superclusters inthe 2dfgrs has an impact on the higher-order clustering moments measured onlarge scales.

astro-ph;0407022	new light on dark cosmos	recent studies by a number of independent collaborations, have correlated thecmb temperatures measured by the wmap satellite with different galaxy surveysthat trace the matter distribution with light from the whole range of theelectromagnetic spectrum: radio, far-infrared, optical and x-ray surveys. thenew data systematically finds positive correlations, indicating a rapid slowdown in the growth of structure in the universe. individual cross-correlationmeasurements are of low significance, but we show that combining data atdifferent redshifts introduces important new constraints. contrary to whathappens at low redshifts, for a fixed $\omm$, the higher the dark energycontend, $\ol$, the lower the isw cross-correlation amplitude. at 68%confidence level, the data finds new independent evidence of dark energy: $\ol=0.42-1.22$ . it also confirms, to higher significance, the presence of a largedark matter component: $\omm =0.18-0.34$, exceeding the density of baryonicmatter, but far from the critical value. combining these new constraints withthe prior of a flat universe, or the prior of an accelerating universe providesstrong new evidence for a dark cosmos. combination with supernova data yields$\ol = 0.71 \pm 0.13$, $\omm = 0.29 \pm 0.04$. if we also assume a flatuniverse, we find $\ol = 0.70 \pm 0.05$ and $w = -1.02 \pm 0.17$ for a constantdark energy equation of state.

astro-ph;0501637	the 3-point function in large scale structure: redshift distortions and  galaxy bias	we study the behavior of the three-point correlation function xi_3 of darkmatter and mock galaxies, concentrating on the effects of redshift-spacedistortions and the determination of galaxy bias parameters in current redshiftgalaxy surveys. on large scales, redshift space distortions tend to wash outslightly the configuration dependence of the reduced 3-point function q3 ~xi_3/xi_2^2. on smaller scales (&lt; 10 mpc/h), q3 develops a characteristicu-shape anisotropy between elongated and open triangles due to the effects ofvelocity dispersion. we show that this shape is quite universal, very weaklydependent on scale, initial spectral index or cosmological parameters andshould be detectable in current galaxy surveys even if affected by shot-noiseor galaxy bias. we present a detailed method for obtaining constraints ongalaxy bias parameters from measurements of q3 in current galaxy redshiftsurveys, based on the eigenmode analysis similar to the one developed for thebispectrum. we show that our method recovers the bias parameters introducedinto mock galaxies by a hod prescription and is also able to handle potentialsystematics in the case when a smaller number than ideal of mock catalogs isused to estimate the covariance matrix. we find that current redshift surveys(e.g. sdss or 2dfgrs) are just about large enough to get interesting newconstraints on bias.

astro-ph;9407079	bias and high-order galaxy correlation functions in the apm galaxy  survey	on large scales, the higher order moments of the mass distribution,$s_j=\xibar_j/\xibar_2^{j-1}$, e.g., the skewness $s_3$ and kurtosis $s_4$, canbe predicted using non-linear perturbation theory. comparison of thesepredictions with moments of the observed galaxy distribution probes the biasbetween galaxies and mass. applying this method to models with initiallygaussian fluctuations and power spectra $p(k)$ similar to that of galaxies inthe apm survey, we find that the predicted higher order moments $s_j(r)$ are ingood agreement with those directly inferred from the apm survey {\it in theabsence of bias}. we use this result to place limits on the linear andnon-linear bias parameters. models in which the extra power observed on largescales (with respect to standard cdm) is produced by scale-dependent bias matchthe apm higher order amplitudes only if non-linear bias (rather than non-lineargravity) generates the observed higher order moments. when normalized to cobedmr, these models are significantly ruled out by the $s_3$ observations. thecold plus hot dark matter model normalized to cobe can reproduce the apm higherorder correlations if one introduces non-linear bias terms, while thelow-density cdm model with a cosmological constant does not require any bias tofit the large-scale amplitudes.

astro-ph;9512008	large scale clustering from non-gaussian texture models	a basic ingredient to understand large scale fluctuations in our present dayuniverse is the initial conditions. using n-body simulations, we compare theclustering that arises from gaussian and non-gaussian initial conditions. thelatter is motivated by a global texture model which has initial $j$-ordercorrelations $\xibar_j$ close to the strongly non-gaussian regime $\xibar_j\simeq \xibar_2^{j/2}$. the final amplitudes $s_j \equiv\xibar_j/\xibar_2^{j-1}$ in the non-gaussian (texture) model evolves slowlytowards the (gaussian) gravitational predictions but, even at $\sigma_8=1$, arestill significantly larger, showing a characteristic minimum with a sharpincrease in $s_j$ with increasing scales. this minimum, which is between $10$and $15 \mpc$, depending on the normalization, separates the regime wheregravity starts dominating the evolution from the one in which the initialconditions are the dominant effect. in comparing this results with galaxyclustering observations, one has to take into account {\it biasing}, i.e. howgalaxy fluctuations trace matter fluctuations. although biasing could changethe amplitudes, we show that the possible distortions to the shape of $s_j$ aretypically small. in contrast to the non-gaussian (texture) predictions, we findno significant minimum or rise in $s_j$ obtained from the apm galaxy survey.

astro-ph;9601085	testing ansatze for quasi-nonlinear clustering: the linear apm power  spectrum	we compare the accuracy of published formulae that transform the linearperturbation theory power spectrum into the nonlinear regime against theresults of an ensemble of large n-body simulations. we find that the modifiedtransformation given by jain, mo and white (1995) performs well for initialfluctuations that have a power law power spectrum, but is less succesful forscale dependent spectra. the inverse transformation to obtain the linear powerspectrum is applied to the apm galaxy survey power spectrum measured by baugh\&amp; efstathiou (1993). the resulting linear spectrum is used to generate theinitial density fluctuations in an n-body simulation, which is evolved to matchthe measured apm amplitude on large scales. we find very good agreement betweenthe final power spectrum of the simulation and the measured apm power spectrum.however, the higher moments for the particle distribution only match the onesrecovered from the apm survey on large scales, $r \simgt 10 \mpc$. on smallscales, $r \simlt 10 \mpc$, the apm estimations give smaller amplitudes,indicating that non-gravitational effects, such as biasing, are important onthose scales. our approach can be used to constrain a model of how light fromgalaxies traces the underlying mass distribution.

astro-ph;9704246	testing deprojection algorithms on mock angular catalogues: evidence for  a break in the power spectrum	we produce mock angular catalogues from simulations with different initialpower spectra to test methods that recover measures of clustering in threedimensions, such as the power spectrum, variance and higher order cumulants. wefind that the statistical properties derived from the angular mock cataloguesare in good agreement with the intrinsic clustering in the simulations. inparticular, we concentrate on the detailed predictions for the shape of thepower spectrum, $p(k)$. we find that there is good evidence for a break in thegalaxy $p(k)$ at scales between $ 0.02 &lt; k &lt; 0.06 ~\impc$ using an inversiontechnique applied to the angular correlation function measured from the apmgalaxy survey. for variants on the standard cold dark matter model, a fit atthe location of the break implies $\omega h= 0.45 \pm 0.10$, where $\omega$ isthe ratio of the total matter density to the critical density and hubble'sconstant is parameterised as $h_{0}= 100~hkm ~s^{-1}mpc^{-1}$. on slightlysmaller, though still quasi-linear scales, there is a feature in the apm powerspectrum where the local slope changes appreciably, with the best match to cdmmodels obtained for $\omega h \simeq 0.2$. hence the location and narrowness ofthe break in the apm power spectrum combined with the rapid change in its slopeon quasi-linear scales cannot be matched by any variant of cdm, includingmodels that have a non-zero cosmological constant or a tilt to the slope of theprimordial $p(k)$. these results are independent of the overall normalizationof the cdm models or any simple bias that exists between the galaxy and massdistributions.

astro-ph;9712095	cosmological perturbation theory and the spherical collapse model - i.  gaussian initial conditions	we present a simple and intuitive approximation for solving perturbationtheory (pt) of small cosmic fluctuations. we consider only the sphericallysymmetric or monopole contribution to the pt integrals, which yields the exactresult for tree-graphs (i.e. at leading order). we find that the non-linearevolution in lagrangian space is then given by a simple {\it local}transformation over the initial conditions, although it is not local in eulerspace. this transformation is found to be described the spherical collapse (sc)dynamics, as it is the exact solution in the shearless (and therefore local)approximation in lagrangian space. taking advantage of this property, it isstraightforward to derive the one-point cumulants, $\xi_j$, for both theunsmoothed and smoothed density fields to {\it arbitrary} order in theperturbative regime. to leading order this reproduces, and provides with asimple explanation for, the exact results obtained by bernardeau (1992, 1994).we then show that the sc model leads to accurate estimates for the nextcorrective terms when compared to the results derived in the exact perturbationtheory making use of the loop calculations (scoccimarro &amp; frieman 1996). theagreement is within a few per cent for the hierarchical ratios $s_j=\xi_j/\xi_2^{j-1}$. we compare our analytic results to n-body simulations,which turn out to be in very good agreement up to scales where $\sigma \approx1$. a similar treatment is presented to estimate higher order corrections inthe zel'dovich approximation. these results represent a powerful and readilyusable tool to produce analytical predictions to describe the gravitationalclustering of large scale structure in the weakly non-linear regime.

astro-ph;9906296	gravitational evolution of the large-scale probability density  distribution: the edgeworth &amp; gamma expansions	the gravitational evolution of the cosmic one-point probability distributionfunction (pdf) has been estimated using an analytic approximation that combinesgravitational perturbation theory with the edgeworth expansion around agaussian pdf. despite the remarkable success of the edgeworth expansion inmodeling the weakly non-linear growth of fluctuations around the peak of thecosmic pdf, it fails to reproduce the expected behaviour in the tails of thedistribution. besides, this expansion is ill-defined as it predicts negativedensities and negative probabilities for the cosmic fields. this is a naturalconsequence of using an expansion around the gaussian distribution, which isnot rigorously well-defined when describing a positive variate, such as thedensity field. here we present an alternative to the edgeworth series based onan expansion around the gamma pdf. the gamma expansion is designed to convergewhen the pdf exhibits exponential tails. the proposed expansion is bettersuited for describing a real pdf as it always yields positive densities and thepdf is effectively positive-definite. we compare the performance of theedgeworth and the gamma expansions for a wide dynamical range making use ofcosmological n-body simulations and assess their range of validity. in general,the gamma expansion provides an interesting and simple alternative to theedgeworth series and it should be useful for modeling non-gaussian pdfs inother contexts, such as in the cosmic microwave background.

astro-ph;9907440	on the evolution of cosmological type ia supernovae and the  gravitational constant	there are at least three ways in which a varying gravitational constant $g$could affect the interpretation of the recent high-redhisft type ia supernovaeresults. if the local value of $g$ at the space-time location of distantsupernovae is different, it would change both the thermonuclear energy releaseand the time scale of the supernova outburst. in both cases the effect isrelated to a change in the chandrasekhar mass $m_{\rm ch}\propto g^{-3/2}$.moreover the integrated variation of $g$ with time would also affect cosmicevolution and therefore the luminosity distance relation. here we investigatein a consistent way how these different effects of a varying $g$ could changethe current interpretation of the hubble diagram of type ia supernovae. weparametrize the variation of $g$ using scalar-tensor theories of gravity, suchas the jordan-brans-dicke theory or its extensions. it is remarkable thatdirac's hypothesis that $g$ should decrease with time can qualitatively explainthe observed $\delta m \simeq 0.2$ mag decrease at $z\simeq 0.5$ (with respectto a decelerating universe) and, at the same time, reduce the duration of therisetimes of distant type ia supernovae as recently reported.

astro-ph;9908289	data processing and compression of cosmic microwave background  anisotropies on board the planck satellite	we present a simple way of coding and compressing the data on board theplanck instruments (hfi and lfi) to address the problem of the on board datareduction. this is a critical issue in the planck mission. the totalinformation that can be downloaded to earth is severely limited by thetelemetry allocation. this limitation could reduce the amount of diagnosticssent on the stability of the radiometers and, as a consequence, curb the finalsensitivity of the cmb anisotropy maps. our proposal to address this problemconsists in taking differences of consecutive circles at a given sky pointing.to a good approximation, these differences are independent of the externalsignal, and are dominated by thermal (white) instrumental noise. usingsimulations and analytical predictions we show that high compression rates,$c_r \simeq 10$, can be obtained with minor or zero loss of cmb sensitivity.possible effects of digital distortion are also analized. the proposed schemeallows for flexibility to optimize the relation with other critical aspects ofthe mission. thus, this study constitutes an important step towards a morerealistic modeling of the final sensitivity of the cmb temperature anisotropymaps.
