0812.4218	discovery of non-radial pulsations in the spectroscopic binary herbig ae  star rs cha	in this article we present a first discovery of non radial pulsations in bothcomponents of the herbig ae spectroscopic binary star rs cha. the binary wasmonitored in quasi-continuous observations during 14 observing nights (jan2006) at the 1m mt john (new zealand) telescope with the herculeshigh-resolution echelle spectrograph. the cumulated exposure time on the starwas 44 hrs, corresponding to 255 individual high-resolution echelle spectrawith $r = 45000$. least square deconvolved spectra (lsd) were obtained for eachspectrum representing the effective photospheric absorption profile modified bypulsations. difference spectra were calculated by subtracting rotationallybroadened artificial profiles; these residual spectra were analysed andnon-radial pulsations were detected. a subsequent analysis with twocomplementary methods, namely fourier parameter fit (fpf) and fourier 2d (f2d)has been performed and first constraints on the pulsation modes have beenderived. in fact, both components of the spectroscopic binary are herbig aestars and both show nrps. the fpf method identified 2 modes for the primarycomponent with (degree l, azimuthal number m) couples ordered by decreasingprobability: f_1 = 21.11 c/d with (l,m) = (11,11), (11,9) or (10,6) and f_2 =30.38 c/d with (l,m) = (10,6) or (9,5). the f2d analysis indicates for f_1 adegree l = 8-10. for the secondary component, the fpf method identified 3 modeswith (l,m) ordered by decreasing probability: f_1 = 12.81 c/d with (l,m) =(2,1) or (2,2), f_2b = 19.11 c/d with (l,m) = (13,5) or (10,5) and f_3 = 24.56c/d with (l,m) = (6,3) or (6,5). the f2d analysis indicates for f_1 a degree l= 2 or 3, but proposes a contradictory identification of f_2 as a radialpulsation (l = 0).

0812.4605	search for the magnetic field of the o7.5 iii star xi persei	cyclical wind variability is an ubiquitous but as yet unexplained featureamong ob stars. the o7.5 iii(n)((f)) star xi persei is the brightestrepresentative of this class on the northern hemisphere. as its prominentcyclical wind properties vary on a rotational time scale (2 or 4 days) the starhas been already for a long time a serious magnetic candidate. as the cause ofthis enigmatic behavior non-radial pulsations and/or a surface magnetic fieldare suggested. we present a preliminary report on our attempts to detect amagnetic field in this star with high-resolution measurements obtained with thespectropolarimeter narval at tbl, france during 2 observing runs of 5 nights in2006 and 5 nights in 2007. only upper limits could be obtained, even with thelongest possible exposure times. if the star hosts a magnetic field, itssurface strength should be less than about 300 g. this would still be enough todisturb the stellar wind significantly. from our new data it seems that theamplitude of the known non-radial pulsations has changed within less than ayear, which needs further investigation.

0901.0347	magnetism of herbig ae/be stars	observations of magnetic fields of stars at the pre-main sequence phase canprovide important new insights into the complex physics of the late stages ofstar formation. this is especially true at intermediate stellar masses, wheremagnetic fields are strong and globally organised, and therefore most amenableto direct study. recent circularly-polarised spectroscopic observations ofpre-main sequence herbig ae/be stars have revealed the presence of organisedmagnetic fields in the photospheres of a small fraction of these objects. todate, 9 magnetic haebe stars have been detected, and those detections confirmedby repeated observations. the morphology and variability of their stokes vsignatures indicates that their magnetic fields have important dipolecomponents of kg strength, and that the dipole is stable on timescales ofatleast years. these magnetic stars exhibit a large range of stellar mass, fromabout 2-13 solar masses, and diverse rotational properties, with vsini from afew km/s to 200 km/s. most magnetic haebe stars show approximately solarabundances; they clearly do not generally exhibit the strong and systematicpeculiarities of the magnetic main sequence a and b type stars (the ap/bpstars). the observed fractional bulk incidence of magnetic haebe stars is about7%, a value compatible with the incidence of magnetic intermediate-mass starson the main sequence. this low incidence is at odds with formation scenariosgenerally involving magnetically-mediated accretion. the similarily between themagnetic properties of the pre-main sequence and main sequenceintermediate-mass stars appears compatible with the hypothesis of a fossilorigin of magnetism in these objects.

0906.2628	hd 50844: the new look of delta sct stars from corot space photometry	it has also been suggested that the detection of a wealth of very lowamplitude modes in delta sct stars was only a matter of signal--to--noiseratio. access to this treasure, impossible from the ground, is one of thescientific aims of the space mission corot, a space mission developed andoperated by cnes. this work presents the results obtained on hd 50844: the140,016 datapoints were analysed using independent approaches and severalchecks performed. a level of 10^{-5} mag was reached in the amplitude spectraof the corot timeseries. the frequency analysis of the corot timeseriesrevealed hundreds of terms in the frequency range 0--30 d^{-1}. all thecross--checks confirmed this new result. the initial guess that delta sct starshave a very rich frequency content is confirmed. the spectroscopic modeidentification gives theoretical support since very high--degree modes (up toell=14) are identified. we also prove that cancellation effects are notsufficient in removing the flux variations associated to these modes at thenoise level of the corot measurements. the ground--based observations indicatethat hd 50844 is an evolved star that is slightly underabundant in heavyelements, located on the terminal age main sequence. probably due to thisunfavourable evolutionary status, no clear regular distribution is observed inthe frequency set. the predominant term (f_1=6.92 d^{-1}) has been identifiedas the fundamental radial mode combining ground-based photometric andspectroscopic data. this work is also based on observations made with esotelescopes under the eso large programme lp178.d-0361 and on data collected atthe observatorio de sierra nevada, at the observatorio astronomico nacional sanpedro martir, and at the piszkesteto mountain station of konkoly observatory.

0907.1423	discovery of a weak magnetic field in the photosphere of the single  giant pollux	aims: we observe the nearby, weakly-active single giant, pollux, in order todirectly study and infer the nature of its magnetic field. methods: we used thenew generation spectropolarimeters espadons and narval to observe and detectcircular polarization within the photospheric absorption lines of pollux. ourobservations span 18 months from 2007-2009. we treated the spectropolarimetricdata using the least-squares deconvolution method to create highsignal-to-noise ratio mean stokes v profiles. we also measured the classicalactivity indicator s-index for the ca h&amp;k lines, and the stellar radialvelocity (rv). results: we have unambiguously detected a weak stokes v signalin the spectral lines of pollux, and measured the related surface-averagedlongitudinal magnetic field bl. the longitudinal field averaged over the spanof the observations is below one gauss. our data suggest variations of thelongitudinal magnetic field, but no significant variation of the s-index. weobserve variations of rv which are qualitatively consistent with the publishedephemeris for a proposed exoplanet orbiting pollux. the observed variations ofbl appear to mimic those of rv, but additional data for this relationship to beestablished. using evolutionary models including the effects of rotation, wederive the mass of pollux and we discuss its evolutionary status and the originof its magnetic field. conclusions: this work presents the first directdetection of the magnetic field of pollux, and demonstrates that espadons andnarval are capable of obtaining sub-g measurements of the surface-averagedlongitudinal magnetic field of giant stars, and of directly studying therelationships between magnetic activity, stellar evolution and planet hostingof these stars.

0907.5113	magnetism and binarity of the herbig ae star v380 ori	in this paper we report the results of high-resolution circularspectropolarimetric monitoring of the herbig ae star v380 ori, in which wediscovered a magnetic field in 2005. a careful study of the intensity spectrumreveals the presence of a cool spectroscopic companion. by modelling the binaryspectrum we infer the effective temperature of both stars: $10500\pm 500$ k forthe primary, and $5500\pm500$ k for the secondary, and we argue that the highmetallicity ($[m/h] = 0.5$), required to fit the lines may imply that theprimary is a chemically peculiar star. we observe that the radial velocity ofthe secondary's lines varies with time, while that of the the primary does not.by fitting these variations we derive the orbital parameters of the system. wefind an orbital period of $104\pm5$ d, and a mass ratio ($m_{\rm p}/m_{\rm s}$)larger than 2.9. the intensity spectrum is heavily contaminated with strong,broad and variable emission. a simple analysis of these lines reveals that adisk might surround the binary, and that a wind occurs in the environment ofthe system. finally, we performed a magnetic analysis using the least-squaresdeconvolved (lsd) profiles of the stokes $v$ spectra of both stars, andadopting the oblique rotator model. from rotational modulation of the primary'sstokes $v$ signatures, we infer its rotation period $p=4.31276\pm0.00042$ d,and find that it hosts a centred dipole magnetic field of polar strength$2.12\pm0.15$ kg, with a magnetic obliquity $\beta = 66\pm5^{\circ}$, and arotation axis inclination $i=32\pm5^{\circ}$. however, no magnetic field isdetected in the secondary, and if it hosts a dipolar magnetic field, itsstrength must be below about 500 g, to be consistent with our observations.

0910.3513	hd 174884: a strongly eccentric, short-period early-type binary system  discovered by corot	accurate photometric corot space observations of a secondary seismologicaltarget, hd 174884, led to the discovery that this star is an astrophysicallyimportant double-lined eclipsing spectroscopic binary in an eccentric orbit (eof about 0.3), unusual for its short (3.65705d) orbital period. the higheccentricity, coupled with the orientation of the binary orbit in space,explains the very unusual observed light curve with strongly unequal primaryand secondary eclipses having the depth ratio of 1-to-100 in the corot 'seismo'passband. without the high accuracy of the corot photometry, the secondaryeclipse, 1.5 mmag deep, would have gone unnoticed. a spectroscopic follow-upprogram provided 45 high dispersion spectra. the analysis of the corot lightcurve was performed with an adapted version of phoebe that supports corotpassbands. the final solution was obtained by simultaneous fitting of the lightand the radial velocity curves. individual star spectra were derived byspectrum disentangling. the uncertainties of the fit were derived by bootstrapresampling and the solution uniqueness was tested by heuristic scanning. theresults provide a consistent picture of the system composed of two late bstars. the fourier analysis of the light curve fit residuals yields twocomponents, with orbital frequency multiples and an amplitude of about 0.1mmag, which are tentatively interpreted as tidally induced pulsations. anextensive comparison with theoretical models is carried out by means of thelevenberg-marquardt minimization technique and the discrepancy between modelsand the derived parameters is discussed. the best fitting models yield a youngsystem age of 125 million years which is consistent with the eccentric orbitand synchronous component rotation at periastron.

1009.2589	exploring the magnetic topologies of cool stars	magnetic fields of cool stars can be directly investigated through the studyof the zeeman effect on photospheric spectral lines using several approaches.with spectroscopic measurement in unpolarised light, the total magnetic fluxaveraged over the stellar disc can be derived but very little information onthe field geometry is available. spectropolarimetry provides a complementaryinformation on the large-scale component of the magnetic topology. withzeeman-doppler imaging (zdi), this information can be retrieved to produce amap of the vector magnetic field at the surface of the star, and in particularto assess the relative importance of the poloidal and toroidal components aswell as the degree of axisymmetry of the field distribution. the development ofhigh-performance spectropolarimeters associated with multi-lines techniques andzdi allows us to explore magnetic topologies throughout the hertzsprung-russeldiagram, on stars spanning a wide range of mass, age and rotation period. theseobservations bring novel constraints on magnetic field generation by dynamoeffect in cool stars. in particular, the study of solar twins brings newinsight on the impact of rotation on the solar dynamo, whereas the detection ofstrong and stable dipolar magnetic fields on fully convective stars questionsthe precise role of the tachocline in this process.

1010.4959	plaskett's star: analysis of the corot photometric data	the sra02 of the corot space mission for asteroseismology was partly devotedto stars belonging to the mon ob2 association. an intense monitoring wasperformed on plaskett's star (hd47129) and the unprecedented quality of thelight curve allows us to shed new light on this very massive, non-eclipsingbinary system. we particularly aimed at detecting periodic variability whichmight be associated with pulsations or interactions between both components. wealso searched for variations related to the orbital cycle which could help toconstrain the inclination and the morphology of the binary system. afourier-based prewhitening and a multiperiodic fitting procedure were appliedto analyse the time series and extract the frequencies of variations. wedescribe the noise properties to tentatively define an appropriate significancecriterion, to only point out the peaks at a certain significance level. we alsodetect the variations related to the orbital motion and study them by using thenightfall program. the periodogram exhibits a majority of peaks at lowfrequencies. among these peaks, we highlight a list of about 43 values,including notably two different sets of harmonic frequencies whose fundamentalpeaks are located at about 0.07 and 0.82d-1. the former represents the orbitalfrequency of the binary system whilst the latter could probably be associatedwith non-radial pulsations. the study of the 0.07d-1 variations reveals thepresence of a hot spot most probably situated on the primary star and facingthe secondary. the investigation of this unique dataset constitutes a furtherstep in the understanding of plaskett's star. these results provide a firstbasis for future seismic modelling. the existence of a hot region between bothcomponents renders the determination of the inclination ambiguous.

1011.2690	possible detection of phase changes from the non-transiting planet hd  46375b by corot	the present work deals with the detection of phase changes in an exoplanetarysystem. hd 46375 is a solar analog known to host a non-transiting saturn-massexoplanet with a 3.0236 day period. it was observed by the corot satellite for34 days during the fall of 2008. we attempt to identify at optical wavelengths,the changing phases of the planet as it orbits its star. we then try to improvethe star model by means of a seismic analysis of the same light curve and theuse of ground-based spectropolarimetric observations. the data analysis relieson the fourier spectrum and the folding of the time series. we find evidence ofa sinusoidal signal compatible in terms of both amplitude and phase with lightreflected by the planet. its relative amplitude is delta fp/f* = [13.0, 26.8]ppm, implying an albedo a=[0.16, 0.33] or a dayside visible brightnesstemperature tb ~ [1880,2030] k by assuming a radius r=1.1 r_jup and aninclination i=45 deg. its orbital phase differs from that of theradial-velocity signal by at most 2 sigma_rv. however, the tiny planetarysignal is strongly blended by another signal, which we attribute to a telluricsignal with a 1 day period. we show that this signal is suppressed, but noteliminated, when using the time series for hd 46179 from the same corot run asa reference. this detection of reflected light from a non-transiting planetshould be confirmable with a longer corot observation of the same field. in anycase, it demonstrates that non-transiting planets can be characterized usingultra-precise photometric lightcurves with present-day observations by corotand kepler. the combined detection of solar-type oscillations on the sametargets (gaulme et al. 2010a) highlights the overlap between exoplanetaryscience and asteroseismology and shows the high potential of a mission such asplato.

1101.3162	an asteroseismic study of the o9v star hd 46202 from corot space-based  photometry	the o9v star hd 46202, which is a member of the young open cluster ngc 2244,was observed by the corot satellite in october/november 2008 during a short runof 34 days. from the very high-precision light curve, we clearly detect betacep-like pulsation frequencies with amplitudes of ~0.1 mmag and below. acomparison with stellar models was performed using a chi^2 as a measure for thegoodness-of-fit between the observed and theoretically computed frequencies.the physical parameters of our best-fitting models are compatible with the onesdeduced spectroscopically. a core overshooting parameter alpha_ov = 0.10 +-0.05 pressure scale height is required. none of the observed frequencies aretheoretically excited with the input physics used in our study. moretheoretical work is thus needed to overcome this shortcoming in how weunderstand the excitation mechanism of pulsation modes in such a massive star.a similar excitation problem has also been encountered for certain pulsationmodes in beta cep stars recently modelled asteroseismically.

1101.3428	corot high-precision photometry of the b0.5 iv star hd 51756	ob stars are important constituents for the ecology of the universe, andthere are only a few studies on their pulsational properties detailed enough toprovide important feedback on current evolutionary models. our goal is toanalyse and interpret the behaviour present in the corot light curve of theb0.5 iv star hd 51756 observed during the second long run of the space mission,and to determine the fundamental stellar parameters from ground-basedspectroscopy gathered with the coralie and harps instruments after checking forsigns of variability and binarity, thus making a step further in mapping thetop of the beta cep instability strip. we compare the newly obtainedhigh-resolution spectra with synthetic spectra of late o-type and early b-typestars computed on a grid of stellar parameters. we match the results withevolutionary tracks to estimate stellar parameters. we use various time seriesanalysis tools to explore the nature of the variations present in the lightcurve. additional calculations are carried out based on distance and historicalposition measurements of the components to impose constraints on the binaryorbit. we find that hd 51756 is a wide binary with both a slow (v sin i \approx28 km s^-1) and a fast (v sin i \approx 170 km s^-1) early-b rotator whoseatmospheric parameters are similar (t_eff \approx 30000 k and log g \approx3.75). we are unable to detect pulsation in any of the components, and weinterpret the harmonic structure in the frequency spectrum as sign ofrotational modulation, which is compatible with the observed and deducedstellar parameters of both components. the non-detection of pulsation modesprovides a feedback on the theoretical treatment, given that non-adiabaticcomputations applied to appropriate stellar models predict the excitation ofboth pressure and gravity modes for the fundamental parameters of this star.

1105.6113	mixed modes in red-giant stars observed with corot	the corot mission has provided thousands of red-giant light curves. theanalysis of their solar-like oscillations allows us to characterize theirstellar properties. up to now, the global seismic parameters of the pressuremodes remain unable to distinguish red-clump giants from members of thered-giant branch. as recently done with kepler red giants, we intend to analyzeand use the so-called mixed modes to determine the evolutionary status of thered giants observed with corot. we also aim at deriving different seismiccharacteristics depending on evolution. the complete identification of thepressure eigenmodes provided by the red-giant universal oscillation patternallows us to aim at the mixed modes surrounding the l=1 expectedeigenfrequencies. a dedicated method based on the envelope autocorrelationfunction is proposed to analyze their period separation. we have identified themixed-mode signature separation thanks to their pattern compatible with theasymptotic law of gravity modes. we have shown that, independent of anymodelling, the g-mode spacings help to distinguish the evolutionary status of ared-giant star. we then report different seismic and fundamental properties ofthe stars, depending on their evolutionary status. in particular, we show thathigh-mass stars of the secondary clump present very specific seismicproperties. we emphasize that stars belonging to the clump were affected bysignificant mass loss. we also note significant population and/or evolutiondifferences in the different fields observed by corot.

1106.0418	corot\,102699796, the first metal-poor herbig ae pulsator: a hybrid  $\delta$ sct-$\gamma$ dor variable?	we present the analysis of the time series observations of corot\,102699796obtained by the corot satellite that show the presence of five independentoscillation frequencies in the range 3.6-5 c/d. using spectra acquired withflames@vlt, we derive the following stellar parameters: spectral type f1v,t$_{\rm eff}$=7000$\pm$200 k, log(g)=$3.8\pm0.4$, [m/h]=$-1.1\pm0.2$,$v$sin$i$=$50\pm5$ km/s, l/l$_{\odot}$=21$^{+21}_{-11}$. thus, for the firsttime we report the existence of a metal poor, intermediate-mass pms pulsatingstar. ground-based and satellite data are used to derive the spectral energydistribution of corot\,102699796 extending from the optical to mid-infraredwavelengths. the sed shows a significant ir excess at wavelengths greater than$\sim5 \mu$. we conclude that corot\,102699796 is a young herbig ae (f1ve) starwith a transitional disk, likely associated to the hii region [ft96]213.1-2.2.  the pulsation frequencies have been interpreted in the light of thenon-radial pulsation theory, using the losc code in conjunction with static androtational evolutionary tracks. a minimization algorithm was used to find thebest-fit model with m=1.84 m$_{\odot}$, t$_{\rm eff}$=6900 k which imply anisochronal age of t$\sim$2.5 myr. this result is based on the interpretation ofthe detected frequencies as $g$-modes of low-moderate $n$-value. to ourknowledge, this is the first time that such modes are identified in aintermediate-mass pms pulsating star. since corot\,102699796 lies in the regionof the hr diagram where the $\delta$ sct and $\gamma$ dor instability stripsintersect, we argue that the observed pulsation characteristics areintermediate between these classes of variables, i.e. corot\,102699796 islikely the first pms hybrid $\gamma$ dor-$\delta$ sct pulsator ever studied.

0710.1780	magnetism and rotation in herbig ae/be stars	among the main sequence intermediate mass a and b stars, around 5% hostlarge-scale organized magnetic fields. most of these stars are very slowrotators compared to their non-magnetic counterparts, and show photosphericabundance anomalies. they are referred to as the ap/bp stars. one of thegreatest challenges, today is to understand the origin of their magnetic fieldand their slow rotation. the favoured hypothesis is a fossil origin of themagnetic field, in which the magnetic fields of ap/bp stars are relics of thosewhich existed in the parental molecular clouds during the formation. thisimplies that the magnetic field must survive all the initial phases of thestellar evolution and especially the pre-main sequence (pms) phase. this isconsistent with the general belief that magnetic braking occurs during the pmsphase, which sheds angular momentum and slows the rotation of these stars. inthis context, we proceeded with a survey of a sample of around 50 pms herbigae/be stars, using the new spectropolarimeter espadons at the cfht, in order tostudy the magnetic field and the rotation velocity of these stars. this talkreviews the results of our survey, as well as their consequences for the originof the magnetic fields and the evolution of the rotation of intermediate massstars during the pms phase.

0712.0199	magnetism in pre-ms intermediate-mass stars and the fossil field  hypothesis	today, one of the greatest challenges concerning the ap/bp stars is tounderstand the origin of their slow rotation and their magnetic fields. thefavoured hypothesis for the latter is the fossil field, which implies that themagnetic fields subsist throughout the different evolutionary phases, and inparticular during the pre-main sequence phase. the existence of magnetic fieldsat the pre-main sequence phase is also required to explain the slow rotation ofap/bp stars. however, until recently, essentially no information was availableabout the magnetic properties of intermediate-mass pre-main sequence stars, theso-called herbig ae/be stars. the new high-resolution spectropolarimeterespadons, installed in 2005 at the canada-france-hawaii telescope, provided thecapability necessary to perform surveys of the herbig ae/be stars in order toinvestigate their magnetism and rotation. these investigations have resulted inthe detection and/or confirmation of magnetic fields in 8 herbig ae/be stars,ranging in mass from 2 to nearly 15 solar masses. in this contribution i willpresent the results of our survey, as well as their implications for the originand evolution of the magnetic fields and rotation.

1211.2907	a high-resolution spectropolarimetric survey of herbig ae/be stars - i.  observations and measurements	this is the first in a series of papers in which we describe and report theanalysis of a large survey of herbig ae/be stars in circularspectropolarimetry. using the espadons and narval high-resolutionspectropolarimeters at the canada-france-hawaii and bernard lyot telescopes,respectively, we have acquired 132 circularly-polarised spectra of 70 herbigae/be stars and herbig candidates. the large majority of these spectra arecharacterised by a resolving power of about 65,000, and a spectral coveragefrom about 3700 ang to 1 micron. the peak snr per ccd pixel ranges from below100 (for the faintest targets) to over 1000 (for the brightest). theobservations were acquired with the primary aim of searching for magneticfields in these objects. however, our spectra are suitable for a variety ofother important measurements, including rotational properties, variability,binarity, chemical abundances, circumstellar environment conditions andstructure, etc. in this first paper, we describe the sample selection, theobservations and their reduction, and the measurements that will comprise thebasis of much of our following analysis. we describe the determination offundamental parameters for each target. we detail the least-squaresdeconvolution that we have applied to each of our spectra, including theselection, editing and tuning of the lsd line masks. we describe the fitting ofthe lsd stokes i profiles using a multi-component model that yields therotationally-broadened photospheric profile (providing the projected rotationalvelocity and radial velocity for each observation) as well as circumstellaremission and absorption components. finally, we diagnose the longitudinalzeeman effect via the measured circular polarisation, and report thelongitudinal magnetic field and stokes v zeeman signature detectionprobability. as an appendix, we provide a detailed review of each starobserved.

1211.2911	a high-resolution spectropolarimetric survey of herbig ae/be stars - ii.  rotation	we report the analysis of the rotational properties of our sample of herbigae/be (haebe) and related stars for which we have obtained high-resolutionspectropolarimetric observations. using the projected rotational velocitiesmeasured at the surface of the stars, we have calculated the angular momentumof the sample and plotted it as a function of age. we have then compared theangular momentum and the vsini distributions of the magnetic to thenon-magnetic haebe stars. finally we have predicted the vsini of thenon-magnetic, non-binary ("normal") stars in our sample when they reach thezams, and compared them to various catalogues of the vsini of main-sequencestars. first, we observe that magnetic haebe stars are much slower rotatorsthan normal stars, indicating that they have been more efficiently braked thanthe normal stars. in fact, the magnetic stars have already lost most of theirangular momentum, despite their young ages (lower than 1 myr for some of them).secondly, our analysis suggests that the low mass (1.5 &lt; m &lt; 5 msun) normalhaebe stars evolve with constant angular momentum towards the zams, while thehigh-mass normal haebe stars (m &gt; 5 msun) are losing angular momentum. wepropose that winds, which are expected to be stronger in massive stars, are atthe origin of this phenomenon.

1212.0630	constraining magnetic-activity modulations in 3~solar-like stars  observed by corot and narval	stellar activity cycles are the manifestation of dynamo process running inthe stellar interiors. they have been observed during years to decades thanksto the measurement of stellar magnetic proxies at the surface of the stars suchas the chromospheric and x-ray emissions, and the measurement of the magneticfield with spectropolarimetry. however, all of these measurements rely onexternal features that cannot be visible during for example, a maunder-typeminimum. with the advent of long observations provided by space asteroseismicmissions, it has been possible to pierce inside the stars and study theirproperties. moreover, the acoustic-mode properties are also perturbed by thepresence of these dynamos. we track the temporal variations of the amplitudesand frequencies of acoustic modes allowing us to search for signature ofmagnetic activity cycles, as has already been done in the sun and in the corottarget hd49933. we use asteroseimic tools and more classical spectroscopicmeasurements performed with the narval spectropolarimeter to check if there arehints of any activity cycle in three solar-like stars observed continuously bythe corot satellite: hd49385, hd181420, and hd52265.our analysis gives verysmall variation of the seismic parameters preventing us from detecting anymagnetic modulation. however we are able to provide a lower limit of anymagnetic-activity change in the three stars that should be longer than 120days, which is the length of the time series. moreover we computed the upperlimit for the line-of-sight magnetic field component. more seismic andspectroscopic data would be required to have a firm detection in these stars.

1212.1687	asymptotic and measured large frequency separations	with the space-borne missions corot and kepler, a large amount ofasteroseismic data is now available. so-called global oscillation parametersare inferred to characterize the large sets of stars, to perform ensembleasteroseismology, and to derive scaling relations. the mean large separation issuch a key parameter. it is therefore crucial to measure it with the highestaccuracy. as the conditions of measurement of the large separation do notcoincide with its theoretical definition, we revisit the asymptotic expressionsused for analysing the observed oscillation spectra. then, we examine theconsequence of the difference between the observed and asymptotic values of themean large separation. the analysis is focused on radial modes. we use seriesof radial-mode frequencies to compare the asymptotic and observational valuesof the large separation. we propose a simple formulation to correct theobserved value of the large separation and then derive its asymptoticcounterpart. we prove that, apart from glitches due to stellar structurediscontinuities, the asymptotic expansion is valid from main-sequence stars tored giants. our model shows that the asymptotic offset is close to 1/4, as inthe theoretical development. high-quality solar-like oscillation spectraderived from precise photometric measurements are definitely better describedwith the second-order asymptotic expansion. the second-order term isresponsible for the curvature observed in the \'echelle diagrams used foranalysing the oscillation spectra and this curvature is responsible for thedifference between the observed and asymptotic values of the large separation.taking it into account yields a revision of the scaling relations providingmore accurate asteroseismic estimates of the stellar mass and radius.

0712.1746	characterisation of the magnetic field of the herbig be star hd 200775	after our recent discovery of four magnetic herbig stars, we have decided tostudy in detail one of them, hd 200775, to determine if its magnetic topologyis similar to that of the main sequence magnetic stars. with this aim, wemonitored this star in stokes i and v over more than two years, using the newspectropolarimeters espadons at cfht, and narval at tbl. using our data, wefind that hd 200775 is a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, whosesecondary seems similar, in temperature, to the primary. we determine theluminosity ratio of the system, and using the luminosity of the system found inliterature, we derive the luminosity of both stars. from our measurements ofthe radial velocities of both stars we determine the ephemeris and the orbitalparameters of the system. we have fitted 30 stokes v profiles simultaneously,using a chi2 minimisation method, with a decentered-dipole model. the best-fitmodel provides a rotation period of 4.3281 d an inclination angle of 60degrees, and a magnetic obliquity angle of 125 degrees. the polar strength ofthe magnetic dipole field is 1000 g, which is decentered by 0.05 r* from thecenter of the star. the derived magnetic field model is qualitatively identicalto those commonly observed in the ap/bp stars, which bring strong argument infavour of the fossil field hypothesis, to explain the origin of the magneticfields in the main sequence ap/bp stars. our determination of the inclinationof the rotation axis leads to a radius of the primary which is smaller thanthat derived from the hr diagram position. this can be explained by a largerintrinsic luminosity of the secondary relative to the primary, due to a largercircumstellar extinction of the secondary relative to the primary.

1301.1804	the dramatic change of the fossil magnetic field of hd 190073: evidence  of the birth of the convective core in a herbig star ?	in the context of the espadons and narval spectropolarimetric surveys ofherbig ae/be stars, we discovered and then monitored the magnetic field of hd190073 over more than four years, from 2004 to 2009. our observations alldisplayed similar zeeman signatures in the stokes v spectra, indicating that hd190073 hosted an aligned dipole, stable over many years, consistent with afossil origin. we obtained new observations of the star in 2011 and 2012 anddetected clear variations of the zeeman signature on timescales of days toweeks, indicating that the configuration of its field has changed between 2009and 2011. such a sudden change of external structure of a fossil field hasnever previously been observed in any intermediate or high-mass star. hd 190073is an almost entirely radiative pre-main sequence star, probably hosting agrowing convective core. we propose that this dramatic change is the result ofthe interaction between the fossil field and the ignition of a dynamo fieldgenerated in the newly-born convective core.

1307.2739	an in-depth study of hd 174966 with corot photometry and harps  spectroscopy. large separation as a new observable for \delta sct stars	the aim of this work was to use a multi-approach technique to derive the mostaccurate values possible of the physical parameters of the \delta sct starhd174966. in addition, we searched for a periodic pattern in the frequencyspectra with the goal of using it to determine the mean density of the star.first, we extracted the frequency content from the corot light curve. then, wederived the physical parameters of hd174966 and carried a mode identificationout from the spectroscopic and photometric observations. we used thisinformation to look for the models fulfilling all the conditions and discussedthe inaccuracies of the method because of the rotation effects. in a finalstep, we searched for patterns in the frequency set using a fourier transform,discussed its origin and studied the possibility of using the periodicity toobtain information about the physical parameters of the star. a total of 185peaks were obtained from the fourier analysis of the corot light curve, beingalmost all reliable pulsating frequencies. from the spectroscopic observations,18 oscillation modes were detected and identified, and the inclination angle($62.5^{\circ}$$^{+7.5}_{-17.5}$) and the rotational velocity of the star (142km/s) were estimated. from the multi-colour photometric observations, 3frequencies were detected, which correspond to the main ones in the corot lightcurve. we looked for periodicities within the 185 frequencies and found aperiodic pattern ~64 \mu hz. using the inclination angle, the rotationalvelocity and an echelle diagram, showing a double comb outside the asymptoticregime, we concluded that the periodicity corresponds to a large separationstructure. the periodic pattern allowed us to discriminate models from a grid,finding that the value of the mean density is achieved with a 6% uncertainty.so, the pattern could be used as a new observable for a-f type stars.

0802.1584	magnetic cycles of the planet-hosting star taubootis	we have obtained new spectropolarimetric observations of the planet-hostingstar taubootis, using the espadons and narval spectropolarimeters at thecanada-france-hawaii telescope and telescope bernard-lyot. with this data set,we are able to confirm the presence of a magnetic field at the surface oftauboo and map its large-scale structure over the whole star. the overallpolarity of the magnetic field has reversed with respect to our previousobservation (obtained a year before), strongly suggesting that tauboo isundergoing magnetic cycles similar to those of the sun. this is the first timethat a global magnetic polarity switch is observed in a star other than thesun; we speculate that the magnetic cycle period of tauboo is much shorter thanthat of the sun.  our new data also allow us to confirm the presence of differential rotationfrom the latitudinal shearing that the magnetic structure is undergoing. thedifferential rotation surface shear that tauboo experiences is found to be 6 to10 times larger than that of the sun. we propose that the short magnetic cycleperiod is due to the strong level of differential rotation. with a rotationperiod of 3.0 and 3.9 d at the equator and pole respectively, tauboo appears asthe first planet-hosting star whose rotation (at intermediate latitudes) issynchronised with the orbital motion of its giant planet (period 3.3 d).assuming that this synchronisation is not coincidental, it suggests that thetidal effects induced by the giant planet can be strong enough to force thethin convective enveloppe (though not the whole star) into corotation and thusto play a role in the activity cycle of tauboo.

0802.2052	magnetospheric accretion on the t tauri star bp tauri	from observations collected with the espadons and narval spectropolarimeters,we report the detection of zeeman signatures on the classical t tauri star bptau. circular polarisation signatures in photospheric lines and in narrowemission lines tracing magnetospheric accretion are monitored throughout mostof the rotation cycle of bp tau at two different epochs in 2006. we observethat rotational modulation dominates the temporal variations of bothunpolarised and circularly polarised spectral proxies tracing the photosphereand the footpoints of accretion funnels.  from the complete data sets at each epoch, we reconstruct the large-scalemagnetic topology and the location of accretion spots at the surface of bp tauusing tomographic imaging. we find that the field of bp tau involves a 1.2 kgdipole and 1.6 kg octupole, both slightly tilted with respect to the rotationaxis. accretion spots coincide with the two main magnetic poles at highlatitudes and overlap with dark photospheric spots; they cover about 2% of thestellar surface. the strong mainly-axisymmetric poloidal field of bp tau isvery reminiscent of magnetic topologies of fully-convective dwarfs. it suggeststhat magnetic fields of fully-convective cttss such as bp tau are likely notfossil remants, but rather result from vigorous dynamo action operating withinthe bulk of their convective zones.  preliminary modelling suggests that the magnetosphere of bp tau extends todistances of at least 4 r* to ensure that accretion spots are located at highlatitudes, and is not blown open close to the surface by a putative stellarwind. it apparently succeeds in coupling to the accretion disc as far out asthe corotation radius, and could possibly explain the slow rotation of bp tau.

0804.1290	toroidal versus poloidal magnetic fields in sun-like stars: a rotation  threshold	from a set of stellar spectropolarimetric observations, we report thedetection of surface magnetic fields in a sample of four solar-type stars,namely hd 73350, hd 76151, hd 146233 (18 sco) and hd 190771. assuming that theobserved variability of polarimetric signal is controlled by stellar rotation,we establish the rotation periods of our targets, with values ranging from 8.8d (for hd 190771) to 22.7 d (for hd 146233). apart from rotation, fundamentalparameters of the selected objects are very close to the sun's, making thissample a practical basis to investigate the specific impact of rotation onmagnetic properties of sun-like stars.  we reconstruct the large-scale magnetic geometry of the targets as alow-order (l&lt;10) spherical harmonics expansion of the surface magnetic field.  from the set of magnetic maps, we draw two main conclusions. (a) the magneticenergy of the large-scale field increases with rotation rate. the increase ofchromospheric emission with the mean magnetic field is flatter than observed inthe sun. since the chromospheric flux is also sensitive to magnetic elementssmaller than those contributing to the polarimetric signal, this observationsuggests that a larger fraction of the surface magnetic energy is stored inlarge scales as rotation increases. (b) whereas the magnetic field is mostlypoloidal for low rotation rates, more rapid rotators host a large-scaletoroidal component in their surface field. from our observations, we infer thata rotation period lower than ~12 days is necessary for the toroidal magneticenergy to dominate over the poloidal component.

astro-ph;0002026	mass-loss induced instabilities in fast rotating stars	to explain the origin of herbig ae/be stars activity, it has been recentlyproposed that strong mass-losses trigger rotational instabilities in theenvelope of fast rotating stars. the kinetic energy transferred to turbulentmotions would then be the energy source of the active phenomena observed in theouter atmosphere of herbig ae/be stars (vigneron et al. 1990; lignieres et al.1996).  in this paper, we present a one-dimensional model of angular momentumtransport which allows to estimate the degree of differential rotation inducedby mass-loss. gradients of angular velocity are very close to - 2 \omega / r(\omega being the surface rotation rate and r the stellar radius). for strongmass-loss, this process occurs in a short time scale as compared to otherprocesses of angular momentum transport. application of existing stabilitycriteria indicates that rotational instabilities should develop for fastrotating star. thus, in fast rotating stars with strong winds, shearinstabilities are expected to develop and to generate subphotospheric turbulentmotions. albeit very simple, this model gives strong support to the assumptionmade by vigneron et al. 1990 and lignieres et al. 1996.

astro-ph;0203305	abundance analysis of targets for the corot / mons asteroseimology  missions i. semi-automatic abundance analysis of the gamma dor star hd 49434	one of the goals of the ground-based support program for the corot andmons/roemer satellite missions is to select and characterise suitable targetstars for the part of the missions dedicated to asteroseismology. while theglobal atmospheric parameters may be determined with good accuracy from thestromgren indices, careful abundance analysis must be made for the proposedmain targets. this is a time consuming process considering the long list ofprimary and secondary targets. we have therefore developed new software calledvwa for this task. the vwa automatically selects the least blended lines fromthe atomic line database vald, and consequently adjusts the abundance in orderto find the best match between the calculated and observed spectra. thevariability of hd 49434 was discovered as part of corot ground-based supportobservations. here we present a detailed abundance analysis of hd 49434 usingvwa. for most elements we find abundances somewhat below the solar values, inparticular we find [fe/h] = -0.13(14). we also present the results from thestudy of the variability that is seen in spectroscopic and photometric timeseries observations. from the characteristics of the variation seen inphotometry and in the line profiles we propose that hd 49434 is a variable starof the gamma doradus type.

astro-ph;0304422	preparing the corot space mission: incidence and characterisation of  pulsation in the lower instability strip	by pursuing the goal to find new variables in the corot field-of-view wecharacterised a sample of stars located in the lower part of the instabilitystrip. our sample is composed of stars belonging to the disk population in thesolar neighbourhood. we found that 23% of the stars display multiperiodic lightvariability up to few mmag of amplitude. uvbybeta photometry fixed most of thevariables in the middle of the instability strip and high-resolutionspectroscopy established that they have vsin i&gt;100 km/s. the comparison withdelta sct stars in the whole galaxy shows slightly different features, i.e.,most delta sct stars have a 0.05-mag redder (b-y)_0 index and lower vsin ivalues. additional investigation in the open cluster ngc 6633 confirms the sameincidence of variability, i.e., around 20%. the wide variety of pulsationalbehaviours of delta sct stars (including unusual objects such as a variablebeyond the blue edge or a rapidly rotating high-amplitude pulsator) makes themvery powerful asteroseismic tools to be used by corot. being quite common amongbright stars, delta sct stars are suitable targets for optical observationsfrom space.

astro-ph;0403464	abundance analysis of targets for the corot / mons asteroseismology  missions ii. abundance analysis of the corot main targets	one of the goals of the ground-based support program for the corot and roemersatellite missions is to characterize suitable target stars for the part of themissions dedicated to asteroseismology. we present the detailed abundanceanalysis of nine of the potential corot main targets using the semi-automaticsoftware vwa. for two additional corot targets we could not perform theanalysis due to the high rotational velocity of these stars. for five starswith low rotational velocity we have also performed abundance analysis by aclassical equivalent width method in order to test the reliability of the vwasoftware. the agreement between the different methods is good. we find that itis necessary to measure abundances extracted from each line relative to theabundances found from a spectrum of the sun in order to remove systematicerrors. we have constrained the global atmospheric parameters teff, log g, and[fe/h] to within 70-100 k, 0.1-0.2 dex, and 0.1 dex for five stars which areslow rotators (v sin i &lt; 15 km/s). for most of the stars stars we find goodagreement with the parameters found from line depth ratios, h-alpha lines,str\"omgren indices, previous spectroscopic studies, and also log g determinedfrom the hipparcos parallaxes. for the fast rotators v sin i &gt; 60 km/s it isnot possible to constrain the atmospheric parameters.

astro-ph;0406110	the pre-main sequence star hd 34282: a very short period delta  scuti-type pulsator	hd 34282 has been found to pulsate during a systematic search for short-termphotometric variability in herbig ae/be stars with the goal of determining theposition and size of the pre-main sequence instability strip. simultaneousstromgren photometry is used in the frequency analysis, yielding twofrequencies with values of nu1=79.5 and nu2=71.3 c/d. the light curve with thelargest amplitude is that of the u band. this behaviour, which is not commonfor delta scuti stars, is explained as pulsation in a high radial order instars near the blue edge of the instability strip. the main period, with avalue of 18.12 min, represents the shortest period observed so far for a deltascuti-type pulsator. a seismic modelling, including instability predictions androtation effects, has been attempted. it is found that both main sequence andpre-main sequence models predict modes in the range of 56 to 82 c/d (between648 and 949 microhz), corresponding to oscillations of radial order n from 6 to8. the highest of the observed frequencies only becomes unstable for models oflow metallicity, in agreement with results from spectroscopic measurements.

astro-ph;0509295	discovery of the pre-main sequence progenitors of the magnetic ap/bp  stars?	we report the discovery, using fors1 at the eso-vlt and espadons at the cfht,of magnetic fields in the young a-type stars hd 101412, v380 ori and hd 72106a.two of these stars (hd 101412 and v380 ori) are pre-main sequence herbig ae/be(haebe) stars, while one (hd 72106a) is physically associated with a haebestar. remarkably, evidence of surface abundance spots is detected in thespectra of hd 72106a. the magnetic fields of these objects display intensitiesof order 1 kg at the photospheric level, are ordered on global scales, andappear in approximately 10% of the stars studied. based on these properties,the detected stars may well represent pre-main sequence progenitors of themagnetic ap/bp stars. the low masses inferred for these objects (2.6, 2.8 and2.4 solar masses) represent additional contradictions to the hypothesis ofhubrig et al. (2000), who claim that magnetic fields appear inintermediate-mass stars only after 30% of their main sequence evolution iscomplete. finally, we fail to confirm claims by hubrig et al. (2004) ofmagnetic fields in the herbig ae star hd 139614.

astro-ph;0601624	investigation of the magnetic field characteristics of herbig ae/be  stars: discovery of the pre-main sequence progenitors of the magnetic ap/bp  stars	we are investigating the magnetic characteristics of pre-main sequence herbigae/be stars, with the aim of (1) understanding the origin and evolution ofmagnetism in intermediate-mass stars, and (2) exploring the influence ofmagnetic fields on accretion, rotation and mass-loss at the early stages ofevolution of a, b and o stars. we have begun by conducting 2 large surveys ofherbig ae/be stars, searching for direct evidence of photospheric magneticfields via the longitudinal zeeman effect. from observations obtained usingfors1 at the eso-vlt and espadons at the canada-france-hawaii telescope, wereport the confirmed detection of magnetic fields in 4 pre-main sequence a- andb-type stars, and the apparent (but as yet unconfirmed) detection of fields in2 other such stars. we do not confirm the detection of magnetic fields inseveral stars reported by other authors to be magnetic: hd 139614, hd 144432 orhd 31649. one of the most evolved stars in the detected sample, hd 72106a,shows clear evidence of strong photospheric chemical peculiarity, whereas manyof the other (less evolved) stars do not. the magnetic fields that we detectappear to have surface intensities of order 1 kg, seem to be structured onglobal scales, and appear in about 10% of the stars studied. based on theseproperties, these magnetic stars appear to be pre-main sequence progenitors ofthe magnetic ap/bp stars.

astro-ph;0610499	the magnetic field of the pre-main sequence herbig ae star hd 190073	the general context of this paper is the study of magnetic fields in thepre-main sequence intermediate mass herbig ae/be stars. magnetic fields arelikely to play an important role in pre-main sequence evolution at thesemasses, in particular in controlling the gains and losses of stellar angularmomentum. the particular aim of this paper is to announce the detection of astructured magnetic field in the herbig ae star hd 190073, and to discussvarious scenarii for the geometry of the star, its environment and its magneticfield. we have used the espadons spectropolarimeter at cfht in 2005 and 2006 toobtain high-resolution and signal-to-noise circular polarization spectra whichdemonstrate unambiguously the presence of a magnetic field in the photosphereof this star. nine circular polarization spectra were obtained, each oneshowing a clear zeeman signature. this signature is suggestive of a magneticfield structured on large scales. the signature, which corresponds to alongitudinal magnetic field of 74+- 10 g, does not vary detectably on aone-year timeframe, indicating either an azimuthally symmetric field, a zeroinclination angle between the rotation axis and the line of sight, or a verylong rotation period. the optical spectrum of hd 190073 exhibits a large numberof emission lines. we discuss the formation of these emission lines in theframework of a model involving a turbulent heated region at the base of thestellar wind, possibly powered by magnetic accretion. this magnetic detectionbrings an important element for our understanding of stellar magnetism atintermediate masses.

astro-ph;0610758	the magnetic field of the planet-hosting star $\tau$ bootis	we have obtained high resolution spectropolarimetric data for theplanet-hosting star $\tau$ bootis, using the espadons spectropolarimeter atcfht. a weak but clear stokes $v$ signature is detected on three of the fournights of june 2006 during which we have recorded data. this polarimetricsignature indicates with no ambiguity the presence of a magnetic field at thestar's surface, with intensity of just a few gauss.  the analysis of the photospheric lines of $\tau$ boo at ultra-highsignal-to-noise reveals the presence of an 18% relative differential rotation.tentative zeeman-doppler imaging, using our spectropolarimetric observationscovering only a fraction of the star's rotational phase, indicates a magneticfield with a dominant potential field component. the data are best fitted whena 3.1d period of modulation and an intermediate inclination are assumed.considering the level of differential rotation of $\tau$ boo, this implies arotation period of 3.0d at the equator and of 3.7d at the pole, and a topologyof the magnetic field where its main non-axisymmetric part is located at lowlatitudes.  the planet is probably synchronised with the star's rotation at intermediatelatitudes, while the non-axisymmetric part of the magnetic field seems locatedat lower latitudes. our limited data do not provide sufficient constraints onthe magnetic field to study a possible interaction of the planet with thestar's magnetosphere. investigating this issue will require data with muchbetter phase coverage. similar studies should also be performed for other starshosting close-in giant planets.

astro-ph;0610947	calibration of the pre-main sequence rs cha binary system	context: the calibration of binary systems with accurately known massesand/or radii provides powerful tools to test stellar structure and evolutiontheory and to determine the age and helium content of stars. we study theeclipsing double-lined spectroscopic binary system rs cha, for which we haveaccurate observations of the parameters of both stars (masses, radii,luminosities, effective temperatures and metallicity). aims: we have calculatedseveral sets of stellar models for the components of the rs cha system, withthe aim of reproducing simultaneously the available observational constraintsand to estimate the age and initial helium abundance of the system. methods:using the cesam stellar evolution code, we model both components starting fromthe initial mass and metallicity and adjusting the input parameters and physicsin order to satisfy the observational constraints. results: we find that theobservations cannot be reproduced if we assume that the abundance ratios aresolar but they are satisfied if carbon and nitrogen are depleted in the rs chasystem with respect to the sun. this is in accordance with the abundancesobserved in other young stars. the rs cha system is in an evolutionary stage atthe end of the pms phase where models are not strongly sensitive to variousphysical uncertainties. however we show that the oscillations of these twostars, which have been detected, would be able to discriminate betweendifferent options in the physical description of this evolutionary phase.

0809.2039	magnetic fields and chemical peculiarities of the very young  intermediate-mass binary system hd 72106	the recently discovered magnetic herbig ae and be stars may providequalitatively new information about the formation and evolution of magnetic apand bp stars. we have performed a detailed investigation of one particularlyinteresting binary system with a herbig ae secondary and a late b-type primarypossessing a strong, globally ordered magnetic field. twenty high-resolutionstokes v spectra of the system were obtained with the espadons instrumentmounted on the cfht. in these observations we see clear evidence for a magneticfield in the primary, but no evidence for a magnetic field in the secondary. adetailed abundance analysis was performed for both stars, revealing strongchemical peculiarities in the primary and normal chemical abundances in thesecondary. the primary is strongly overabundant in si, cr, and other iron-peakelements, as well as nd, and underabundant in he. the primary therefore appearsto be a very young bp star. in this context, line profile variations of theprimary suggest non-uniform lateral distributions of surface abundances.interpreting the 0.63995 +/- 0.00009 day variation period of the stokes i and vprofiles as the rotational period of the star, we have modeled the magneticfield geometry and the surface abundance distributions of si, ti, cr and feusing magnetic doppler imaging. we derive a dipolar geometry of the surfacemagnetic field, with a polar strength of 1230 g and an obliquity of 57 degrees.the distributions ti, cr and fe are all qualitatively similar, with anelongated patch of enhanced abundance situated near the positive magnetic pole.the si distribution is somewhat different, and its relationship to the magneticfield geometry less clear.

astro-ph;9603041	line profile variations in $\gamma$ doradus	we present data from high-dispersion echelle spectra and simultaneous $uvby$photometry for $\gamma$~doradus. these data were obtained from several sitesduring 1994 november as part of the musicos-94 campaign. the star has twoclosely-spaced periods of about 0.75 d and is the brightest member of a newclass of variable early f-type stars. a previously suspected third period, veryclose to the other two, is confirmed. previous observations indicated thatsudden changes could be expected in the spectrum, but none were found duringthe campaign. the radial velocities rule out the possibility of a closecompanion. the phasing between the radial velocity and light curve of thestrongest periodic component rules out the starspot model. the only viablemechanism for understanding the variability is nonradial pulsation. we used themethod of moments to identify the modes of pulsation of the three periodiccomponents. these appear to be sectorial retrograde modes with sphericalharmonic degrees, ($\ell, m$), as follows: $f_1$ = (3,3), $f_2$ = (1,1) and$f_4$ = (1,1). the angle of inclination of the star is found to be $i \approx70^\circ$.
