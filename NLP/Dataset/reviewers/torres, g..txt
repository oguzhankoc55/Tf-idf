0704.0059	the mass and radius of the unseen m-dwarf companion in the single-lined  eclipsing binary hat-tr-205-013	we derive masses and radii for both components in the single-lined eclipsingbinary hat-tr-205-013, which consists of a f7v primary and a late m-dwarfsecondary. the system's period is short, $p=2.230736 \pm 0.000010$ days, withan orbit indistinguishable from circular, $e=0.012 \pm 0.021$. we demonstrategenerally that the surface gravity of the secondary star in a single-linedbinary undergoing total eclipses can be derived from characteristics of thelight curve and spectroscopic orbit. this constrains the secondary to a uniqueline in the mass-radius diagram with $m/r^2$ = constant. for hat-tr-205-013, weassume the orbit has been tidally circularized, and that the primary's rotationhas been synchronized and aligned with the orbital axis. our observed linebroadening, $v_{\rm rot} \sin i_{\rm rot} = 28.9 \pm 1.0$ \kms, gives a primaryradius of $r_{\rm a} = 1.28 \pm 0.04$ \rsun. our light curve analysis leads tothe radius of the secondary, $r_{\rm b} = 0.167 \pm 0.006$ \rsun, and thesemimajor axis of the orbit, $a = 7.54 \pm 0.30 \rsun = 0.0351 \pm 0.0014$ au.our single-lined spectroscopic orbit and the semimajor axis then yield theindividual masses, $m_{\rm b} = 0.124 \pm 0.010$ \msun and $m_{\rm a} = 1.04\pm 0.13$ \msun. our result for hat-tr-205-013 b lies above the theoreticalmass-radius models from the lyon group, consistent with results fromdouble-lined eclipsing binaries. the method we describe offers the opportunityto study the very low end of the stellar mass-radius relation.

0908.2624	accurate masses and radii of normal stars: modern results and  applications	this paper presents and discusses a critical compilation of accurate,fundamental determinations of stellar masses and radii. we have identified 95detached binary systems containing 190 stars (94 eclipsing systems, and alphacentauri) that satisfy our criterion that the mass and radius of both stars beknown to 3% or better. to these we add interstellar reddening, effectivetemperature, metal abundance, rotational velocity and apsidal motiondeterminations when available, and we compute a number of other physicalparameters, notably luminosity and distance. we discuss the use of thisinformation for testing models of stellar evolution. the amount and quality ofthe data also allow us to analyse the tidal evolution of the systems inconsiderable depth, testing prescriptions of rotational synchronisation andorbital circularisation in greater detail than possible before. the new dataalso enable us to derive empirical calibrations of m and r for single (post-)main-sequence stars above 0.6 m(sun). simple, polynomial functions of t(eff),log g and [fe/h] yield m and r with errors of 6% and 3%, respectively.excellent agreement is found with independent determinations for host stars oftransiting extrasolar planets, and good agreement with determinations of m andr from stellar models as constrained by trigonometric parallaxes andspectroscopic values of t(eff) and [fe/h]. finally, we list a set of 23interferometric binaries with masses known to better than 3%, but withoutfundamental radius determinations (except alpha aur). we discuss the prospectsfor improving these and other stellar parameters in the near future.

0910.4458	absolute dimensions of the g7+k7 eclipsing binary star im virginis:  discrepancies with stellar evolution models	we report extensive spectroscopic and differential photometric bvriobservations of the active, detached, 1.309-day double-lined eclipsing binaryim vir, composed of a g7-type primary and a k7 secondary. with theseobservations we derive accurate absolute masses and radii of m(1) = 0.981 +/-0.012 m(sun), m(2) = 0.6644 +/- 0.0048 m(sun), r(1) = 1.061 +/- 0.016 r(sun),and r(2) = 0.681 +/- 0.013 r(sun) for the primary and secondary, with relativeerrors under 2%. the effective temperatures are 5570 +/- 100 k and 4250 +/- 130k. the significant difference in mass makes this a favorable case forcomparison with stellar evolution theory. we find that both stars are largerthan the models predict, by 3.7% for the primary and 7.5% for the secondary, aswell as cooler than expected, by 100 k and 150 k, respectively. thesediscrepancies are in line with previously reported differences in low-massstars, and are believed to be caused by chromospheric activity, which is notaccounted for in current models. the effect is not confined to low-mass stars:the rapidly-rotating primary of im vir joins the growing list of objects ofnear-solar mass (but still with convective envelopes) that show similaranomalies. the comparison with the models suggests an age of 2.4 gyr for thesystem, and a metallicity [fe/h] of approximately -0.3 that is consistent withother indications, but requires confirmation.

1001.5138	tyc 2675-663-1: a newly discovered w uma system in an active state	the recently discovered eclipsing binary system tyc 2675-663-1 is a x-raysource, and shows properties in the optical that are similar to the w umasystems, but are somewhat unusual compared to what is seen in other contactbinary systems. the goal of this work is to characterize its properties andinvestigate its nature by means of detailed photometric and spectroscopicobservations. we have performed extensive v-band photometric measurements withthe integral satellite along with ground-based multi-band photometricobservations, as well as high-resolution spectroscopic monitoring from which wehave measured the radial velocities of the components. these data have beenanalysed to determine the stellar properties, including the absolute masses andradii. additional low-resolution spectroscopy was obtained to investigatespectral features. from the measured eclipse timings we determine an orbitalperiod for the binary of p=0.4223576+-0.0000009 days. the light-curve andspectroscopic analyses reveal the observations to be well represented by amodel of an overcontact system composed of main-sequence f5 and g7 stars(temperature difference of nearly 1000 k), with the possible presence of athird star. low-resolution optical spectroscopy reveals a complex h alphaemission, and other features that are not yet understood. the unusually largemass ratio of q=0.81+-0.05 places it in the rare "h" (high mass ratio) subclassof the w uma systems, which are presumably on their way to coalescence.

1002.2949	di her as a test of internal stellar structure and general relativity:  new apsidal motion rate and evolutionary models	for the past three decades, and until recently, there has been a seriousdiscrepancy between the observed and theoretical values of the apsidal motionrate dw/dt of the eccentric eclipsing binary di her, which has even beeninterpreted occasionally as a possible failure of general relativity (gr).recent observations of the rossiter-mclaughlin effect have shown convincinglythat the reason for the anomaly is that the rotational axes of the stars andthe orbital axis are misaligned, which changes the predicted rate of precessionsignificantly. although as a result of those measurements the disagreement isnow drastically smaller, it remains formally at the level of 50%, possibly dueto errors in the measured apsidal motion rate, outdated stellar models, orinaccuracies in the stellar parameters. here we address each of these issues inorder to improve the agreement further. new times of minimum have beencollected in order to redetermine the apsidal motion rate. we have computed newstellar evolution models with updated physical inputs, and derived improvedapsidal motion constants for the components. we have performed monte carlosimulations to infer the theoretical distribution of dw/dt, including thecontributions from gr as well as tidal and rotational distortions. allobservational errors have been accounted for. our simulations yield aretrograde apsidal motion rate due to the rotationally-induced oblateness of-0.00056 deg/cycle (mode of the distribution), a gr contribution of +0.00068deg/cycle, and a tidal contribution of +0.00034 deg/cycle, leading to a totalpredicted rate of +0.00046 deg/cycle. this is in excellent agreement with thenewly measured value of +0.00042 deg/cycle. the formal difference is nowreduced to 10%, a small fraction of the observational uncertainties.

1106.1212	hat-p-32b and hat-p-33b: two highly inflated hot jupiters transiting  high-jitter stars	we report the discovery of two exoplanets transiting high-jitter stars.hat-p-32b orbits the bright v=11.289 star gsc 3281-00800, with a period p =2.150008 d. the stellar and planetary masses and radii depend on theeccentricity of the system, which is poorly constrained due to the highvelocity jitter (~80m/s). assuming a circular orbit, the star has a mass of1.16+-0.04 m_sun, and radius of 1.22+-0.02 r_sun, while the planet has a massof 0.860+-0.164 mj, and a radius of 1.789+-0.025 rj. when the eccentricity isallowed to vary, the best-fit model results in a planet which is close tofilling its roche lobe. including the constraint that the planet cannot exceedits roche lobe results in the following best-fit parameters: e = 0.163+-0.061,mp = 0.94+-0.17 mj, rp = 2.04+-0.10 rj, ms = 1.18+0.04-0.07 m_sun and rs =1.39+-0.07 r_sun. the second planet, hat-p-33b, orbits the bright v=11.188 stargsc 2461-00988, with a period p = 3.474474 d. as for hat-p-32, the stellar andplanetary masses and radii of hat-p-33 depend on the eccentricity, which ispoorly constrained due to the high jitter (~50m/s). in this case spectral linebisector spans are significantly anti-correlated with the radial velocityresiduals, and we use this correlation to reduce the residual rms to ~35m/s. wefind the star has a mass of either 1.38+-0.04 m_sun or 1.40+-0.10 m_sun, and aradius of either 1.64+-0.03 r_sun or 1.78+-0.28 r_sun, while the planet has amass of either 0.762+-0.101 mj or 0.763+-0.117 mj, and a radius of either1.686+-0.045 rj or 1.827+-0.290 rj, for an assumed circular orbit or for thebest-fit eccentric orbit respectively. due to the large bisector spanvariations exhibited by both stars we rely on detailed modeling of thephotometric light curves to rule out blend scenarios. both planets are amongthe largest radii transiting planets discovered to date.

1106.4244	young exoplanet transit initiative (yeti)	we present the young exoplanet transit initiative (yeti), in which we useseveral 0.2 to 2.6m telescopes around the world to monitor continuously young(&lt; 100 myr), nearby (&lt; 1 kpc) stellar clusters mainly to detect youngtransiting planets (and to study other variability phenomena on time-scalesfrom minutes to years). the telescope network enables us to observe the targetscontinuously for several days in order not to miss any transit. the runs aretypically one to two weeks long, about three runs per year per cluster in twoor three subsequent years for about ten clusters. there are thousands of starsdetectable in each field with several hundred known cluster members, e.g. inthe first cluster observed, tr-37, a typical cluster for the yeti survey, thereare at least 469 known young stars detected in yeti data down to r=16.5 magwith sufficient precision of 50 milli-mag rms (5 mmag rms down to r=14.5 mag)to detect transits, so that we can expect at least about one young transitingobject in this cluster. if we observe 10 similar clusters, we can expect todetect approximately 10 young transiting planets with radius determinations.the precision given above is for a typical telescope of the yeti network,namely the 60/90-cm jena telescope (similar brightness limit, namely within+/-1 mag, for the others) so that planetary transits can be detected. forplanets with mass and radius determinations, we can calculate the mean densityand probe the internal structure. we aim to constrain planet formation modelsand their time-scales by discovering planets younger than 100 myr anddetermining not only their orbital parameters, but also measuring their truemasses and radii, which is possible so far only by the transit method. here, wepresent an overview and first results.

0704.2938	improving stellar and planetary parameters of transiting planet systems:  the case of tres-2	we report on a spectroscopic determination of the atmospheric parameters andchemical abundance of the parent star of the recently discovered transitingplanet {tres-2}. a detailed lte analysis of a set of \ion{fe}{1} and\ion{fe}{2} lines from our keck spectra yields $t_\mathrm{eff} = 5850\pm 50$ k,$\log g = 4.4\pm 0.1$, and [fe/h] $= -0.15\pm 0.10$. several independent checks(e.g., additional spectroscopy, line-depth ratios) confirm the reliability ofour spectroscopic $t_\mathrm{eff}$ estimate. the mass and radius of the star,needed to determine the properties of the planet, are traditionally inferred bycomparison with stellar evolution models using $t_\mathrm{eff}$ and somemeasure of the stellar luminosity, such as the spectroscopic surface gravity(when a trigonometric parallax is unavailable, as in this case). we apply herea new method in which we use instead of $\log g$ the normalized separation$a/r_\star$ (related to the stellar density), which can be determined directlyfrom the light curves of transiting planets with much greater precision. withthe $a/r_\star$ value from the light curve analysis of holman et al.\citeyearpar{holman07b} and our $t_\mathrm{eff}$ estimate we obtain $m_\star =0.980\pm0.062 m_\odot$ and $r_\star = 1.000_{-0.033}^{+0.036} r_\odot$, and anevolutionary age of $5.1^{+2.7}_{-2.3}$ gyr, in good agreement with otherconstraints based on the strength of the emission in the \ion{ca}{2} h &amp; k linecores, the lithium abundance, and rotation. the new stellar parameters yieldimproved values for the planetary mass and radius of $m_p = 1.198 \pm 0.053m_\mathrm{jup}$ and $r_p = 1.220^{+0.045}_{-0.042} r_\mathrm{jup}$, confirmingthat {tres-2} is the most massive among the currently known nearby ($d\lesssim300$ pc) transiting hot jupiters.

1112.1018	a surprising dynamical mass for v773~tau~b	we report on new high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy on the multiple ttauri star system v773 tau over the 2003 -- 2009 period. with these data wederive relative astrometry, photometry between the a and b components, andradial velocity (rv) of the a-subsystem components. combining these new datawith previously published astrometry and rvs, we update the relative a-b orbitmodel. this updated orbit model, the known system distance, and a subsystemparameters yields a dynamical mass for the b component for the first time.remarkably the derived b dynamical mass is in the range of 1.7 -- 3.0 m$_\sun$.this is much higher than previous estimates, and suggests that like a, b isalso a multiple stellar system.  among these data, spatially-resolved spectroscopy provide new insight intothe nature of the b component. similar to a, these near-ir spectra indicatethat the dominant source in b is of mid-k spectral type. if b is in fact amultiple star system as suggested by the dynamical mass estimate, the simplestassumption is that b is composed of similar $\sim$ 1.2 m$_\sun$ pms stars in aclose ($&lt;$ 1 au) binary system. this inference is supported by line-shapechanges in near-ir spectroscopy of b, tentatively interpreted as changing rvamong components in v773 tau b.  relative photometry indicate that b is highly variable in the near-ir. themost likely explanation for this variability is circum-b material resulting invariable line-of-sight extinction. the distribution of this material must besignificantly affected by both the putative b multiplicity, and the a-b orbit.

0801.1841	improved parameters for extrasolar transiting planets	we present refined values for the physical parameters of transitingexoplanets, based on a self-consistent and uniform analysis of transit lightcurves and the observable properties of the host stars. previously it has beendifficult to interpret the ensemble properties of transiting exoplanets,because of the widely different methodologies that have been applied inindividual cases. furthermore, previous studies often ignored an importantconstraint on the mean stellar density that can be derived directly from thelight curve. the main contributions of this work are 1) a critical compilationand error assessment of all reported values for the effective temperature andmetallicity of the host stars; 2) the application of a consistent methodologyand treatment of errors in modeling the transit light curves; and 3) moreaccurate estimates of the stellar mass and radius based on stellar evolutionmodels, incorporating the photometric constraint on the stellar density. we useour results to revisit some previously proposed patterns and correlationswithin the ensemble. we confirm the mass-period correlation, and we findevidence for a new pattern within the scatter about this correlation: planetsaround metal-poor stars are more massive than those around metal-rich stars ata given orbital period. likewise, we confirm the proposed dichotomy of planetsaccording to their safronov number, and we find evidence that the systems withsmall safronov numbers are more metal-rich on average. finally, we confirm thetrend that led to the suggestion that higher-metallicity stars harbor planetswith a greater heavy-element content.

1308.2937	hat-p-44b, hat-p-45b, and hat-p-46b: three transiting hot jupiters in  possible multi-planet systems	we report the discovery by the hatnet survey of three new transitingextrasolar planets orbiting moderately bright (v=13.2, 12.8 and 11.9) stars.the planets have orbital periods of 4.3012, 3.1290, and 4.4631 days, masses of0.39, 0.89, and 0.49 mjup, and radii of 1.28, 1.43, and 1.28 rjup. the stellarhosts have masses of 0.94, 1.26, and 1.28 msun. each system shows significantsystematic variations in its residual radial velocities indicating the possiblepresence of additional components. based on its bayesian evidence, thepreferred model for hat-p-44 consists of two planets, including the transitingcomponent, with the outer planet having a period of 220 d and a minimum mass of1.6 mjup. due to aliasing we cannot rule out an alternative solution for theouter planet having a period of 438 d and a minimum mass of 3.7 mjup. forhat-p-45 at present there is not enough data to justify the additional freeparameters included in a multi-planet model, in this case a single-planetsolution is preferred, but the required jitter of 22.5 +- 6.3 m/s is relativelyhigh for a star of this type. for hat-p-46 the preferred solution includes asecond planet having a period of 78 d and a minimum mass of 2.0 mjup, howeverthe preference for this model over a single-planet model is not very strong.while substantial uncertainties remain as to the presence and/or properties ofthe outer planetary companions in these systems, the inner transiting planetsare well characterized with measured properties that are fairly robust againstchanges in the assumed models for the outer planets. continued rv monitoring isnecessary to fully characterize these three planetary systems, the propertiesof which may have important implications for understanding the formation of hotjupiters.

(2007). if as predicted by fortney et al.

1410.6170	the g+m eclipsing binary v530 orionis: a stringent test of magnetic  stellar evolution models for low-mass stars	we report extensive photometric and spectroscopic observations of the 6.1-dayperiod, g+m-type detached double-lined eclipsing binary v530 ori, an importantnew benchmark system for testing stellar evolution models for low-mass stars.we determine accurate masses and radii for the components with errors of 0.7%and 1.3%, as follows: m(a) = 1.0038 +/- 0.0066 m(sun), m(b) = 0.5955 +/- 0.0022m(sun), r(a) = 0.980 +/- 0.013 r(sun), and r(b) = 0.5873 +/- 0.0067 r(sun). theeffective temperatures are 5890 +/- 100 k (g1v) and 3880 +/- 120 k (m1v),respectively. a detailed chemical analysis probing more than 20 elements in theprimary spectrum shows the system to have a slightly subsolar abundance, with[fe/h] = -0.12 +/- 0.08. a comparison with theory reveals that standard modelsunderpredict the radius and overpredict the temperature of the secondary, ashas been found previously for other m dwarfs. on the other hand, models fromthe dartmouth series incorporating magnetic fields are able to match theobservations of the secondary star at the same age as the primary (3 gyr) witha surface field strength of 2.1 +/- 0.4 kg when using a rotational dynamoprescription, or 1.3 +/- 0.4 kg with a turbulent dynamo approach, not far fromour empirical estimate for this star of 0.83 +/- 0.65 kg. the observations aremost consistent with magnetic fields playing only a small role in changing theglobal properties of the primary. the v530 ori system thus provides animportant demonstration that recent advances in modeling appear to be on theright track to explain the long-standing problem of radius inflation andtemperature suppression in low-mass stars.

1503.04435	precise mass and radius measurements for the components of the bright  solar-type eclipsing binary star v1094 tau	v1094 tau is bright eclipsing binary star with an orbital period close to 9days containing two stars similar to the sun. our aim is to test models ofsun-like stars using precise and accurate mass and radius measurements for bothstars in v1094 tau. we present new spectroscopy of v1094 tau which we use toestimate the effective temperatures of both stars and to refine theirspectroscopic orbits. we also present new, high-quality photometry coveringboth eclipses of v1094 tau in the stroemgren uvby system and in the johnsonv-band. the masses, radii and effective temperatures of the stars in v1094 tauare found to be m$_a$ = 1.0965 $\pm$ 0.0040 m$_{\odot}$, r$_a$ = 1.4109 $\pm$0.0058 r$_{\odot}$, t$_{\rm eff,a}$ = 5850 $\pm$ 100 k, and m$_b$ = 1.0120$\pm$ 0.0028 m$_{\odot}$, r$_b$ = 1.1063 $\pm$ 0.0066 r$_{\odot}$, t$_{\rmeff,b}$ = 5700 $\pm$ 100 k. an analysis of the times of mid-eclipse and theradial velocity data reveals apsidal motion with a period of 14500 $\pm$ 3700years. the observed masses, radii and effective temperatures are consistentwith stellar models for an age $\approx$ 6 gyr if the stars are assumed to havea metallicity similar to the sun. this estimate is in reasonable agreement withour estimate of the metallicity derived using stroemgren photometry andtreating the binary as a single star ([fe/h] $= -0.09 \pm 0.11$). the rotationvelocities of the stars suggest that v1094 tau is close to the limit at whichtidal interactions between the stars force them to rotate pseudo-synchronouslywith the orbital motion.

astro-ph;0609369	hat-p-1b: a large-radius, low-density exoplanet transiting one member of  a stellar binary	using small automated telescopes in arizona and hawaii, the hatnet projecthas detected an object transiting one member of the double star system ads16402 ab. this system is a pair of g0 main-sequence stars with age about 3 gyrat a distance of ~139 pc and projected separation of ~1550 au. the transitsignal has a period of 4.46529 days and depth of 0.015 mag. from follow-upphotometry and spectroscopy, we find that the object is a "hot jupiter" planetwith mass about 0.53 m_jup and radius ~1.36 r_jup traveling in an orbit withsemimajor axis 0.055 au and inclination about 85.9 deg, thus transiting thestar at impact parameter 0.74 of the stellar radius. based on a data setspanning three years, ephemerides for the transit center are: t_c = 2453984.397+ n_tr * 4.46529. the planet, designated hat-p-1b, appears to be at least aslarge in radius, and smaller in mean density, than any previously-known planet.

astro-ph;0612135	physical orbit for lambda virginis and a test of stellar evolution  models	lambda virginis (lamvir) is a well-known double-lined spectroscopic am binarywith the interesting property that both stars are very similar in abundance butone is sharp-lined and the other is broad-lined. we present combinedinterferometric and spectroscopic studies of lamvir. the small scale of thelamvir orbit (~20 mas) is well resolved by the infrared optical telescope array(iota), allowing us to determine its elements as well as the physicalproperties of the components to high accuracy. the masses of the two stars aredetermined to be 1.897 msun and 1.721 msun, with 0.7% and 1.5% errorsrespectively, and the two stars are found to have the same temperature of 8280+/- 200 k. the accurately determined properties of lamvir allow comparisonsbetween observations and current stellar evolution models, and reasonablematches are found. the best-fit stellar model gives lamvir a subsolarmetallicity of z=0.0097, and an age of 935 myr. the orbital and physicalparameters of lamvir also allow us to study its tidal evolution time scales andstatus. although currently atomic diffusion is considered to be the mostplausible cause of the am phenomenon, the issue is still being actively debatedin the literature. with the present study of the properties and evolutionarystatus of lamvir, this system is an ideal candidate for further detailedabundance analyses that might shed more light on the source of the chemicalanomalies in these a stars.

0809.4589	a new spectroscopic and photometric analysis of the transiting planet  systems tres-3 and tres-4	we report new spectroscopic and photometric observations of the parent starsof the recently discovered transiting planets tres-3 and tres-4. a detailedabundance analysis based on high-resolution spectra yields [fe/h] $= -0.19\pm0.08$, $t_\mathrm{eff} = 5650\pm 75$ k, and $\log g = 4.4\pm 0.1$ for tres-3,and [fe/h] $= +0.14\pm 0.09$, $t_\mathrm{eff} = 6200\pm 75$ k, and $\log g =4.0\pm0.1$ for tres-4. the accuracy of the effective temperatures is supportedby a number of independent consistency checks. the spectroscopic orbitalsolution for tres-3 is improved with our new radial-velocity measurements ofthat system, as are the light-curve parameters for both systems based on newlyacquired photometry for tres-3 and a reanalysis of existing photometry fortres-4. we have redetermined the stellar parameters taking advantage of thestrong constraint provided by the light curves in the form of the normalizedseparation $a/r_\star$ (related to the stellar density) in conjunction with ournew temperatures and metallicities. the masses and radii we derive are$m_\star=0.928_{-0.048}^{+0.028} m_{\sun}$,$r_\star = 0.829_{-0.022}^{+0.015}r_{\sun}$, and $m_\star = 1.404_{-0.134}^{+0.066} m_{\sun}$,$r_\star=1.846_{-0.087}^{+0.096} r_{\sun}$ for tres-3 and tres-4, respectively.with these revised stellar parameters we obtain improved values for theplanetary masses and radii. we find $m_p = 1.910_{-0.080}^{+0.075}m_\mathrm{jup}$, $r_p=1.336_{-0.036}^{+0.031} r_\mathrm{jup}$ for tres-3, and$m_p=0.925 \pm 0.082 m_\mathrm{jup}$, $r_p=1.783_{-0.086}^{+0.093}r_\mathrm{jup}$ for tres-4. we confirm tres-4 as the planet with the largestradius among the currently known transiting hot jupiters.

0810.0260	independent confirmation and refined parameters of the hot jupiter xo-5b	we present hatnet observations of xo-5b, confirming its planetary naturebased on evidence beyond that described in the announcement of burke et al.(2008), namely, the lack of significant correlation between spectral bisectorvariations and orbital phase. in addition, using extensive spectroscopicmeasurements spanning multiple seasons, we investigate the relatively largescatter in the spectral line bisectors. we also examine possible blendedstellar configurations (hierarchical triples, chance alignments) that can mimicthe planet signals, and we are able to show that none are consistent with thesum of all the data. the analysis of the s activity index shows no significantstellar activity. our results for the planet parameters are consistent withvalues in burke et al. (2008), and we refine both the stellar and planetaryparameters using our data. xo-5b orbits a slightly evolved, late g type starwith mass m_s = 0.88 +/- 0.03, radius r_s = 1.08 +/- 0.04, and metallicityclose to solar. the planetary mass and radius are m_p = 1.059 +/- 0.028 m_jupand r_p = 1.109 +/- 0.050 r_jup, respectively, corresponding to a mean densityof 0.96 -0.11 +0.14 g/cm^3. the ephemeris for the orbit is p = 4.187757 +/-0.000011, e= 2454552.67168 +/- 0.00029 (bjd) with transit duration of 0.1307+/- 0.0013 d. by measuring four individual transit centers, we found no signsfor transit timing variations. the planet xo-5b is notable for its anomalouslyhigh safronov number, and has a high surface gravity when compared to othertransiting exoplanets with similar period.

0810.1541	absolute properties of the low-mass eclipsing binary cm draconis	spectroscopic and eclipsing binary systems offer the best means fordetermining accurate physical properties of stars, including their masses andradii. the data available for low-mass stars have yielded firm evidence thatstellar structure models predict smaller radii and higher effectivetemperatures than observed, but the number of systems with detailed analyses isstill small. in this paper we present a complete reanalysis of one of sucheclipsing systems, cm dra, composed of two dm4.5 stars. new and existing lightcurves as well as a radial velocity curve are modeled to measure the physicalproperties of both components. the masses and radii determined for thecomponents of cm dra are m1=0.2310+/-0.0009 msun, m2=0.2141+/-0.0010 msun,r1=0.2534+/-0.0019 rsun, and r2=0.2396+/-0.0015 rsun. with relativeuncertainties well below the 1% level, these values constitute the mostaccurate properties to date for fully convective stars. this makes cm dra avaluable benchmark for testing theoretical models. in comparing ourmeasurements with theory, we confirm the discrepancies reported previously forother low-mass eclipsing binaries. these discrepancies seem likely to be due tothe effects of magnetic activity. we find that the orbit of this system isslightly eccentric, and we have made use of eclipse timings spanning threedecades to infer the apsidal motion and other related properties.
