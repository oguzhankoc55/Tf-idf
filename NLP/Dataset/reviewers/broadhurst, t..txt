0902.2403	near-ir galaxy counts and evolution from the wide-field alhambra survey	the alhambra survey aims to cover 4 square degrees using a system of 20contiguous, equal width, medium-band filters spanning the range 3500 a to 9700a plus the standard jhks filters. here we analyze deep near-ir number counts ofone of our fields (alh08) for which we have a relatively large area (0.5 squaredegrees) and faint photometry (j=22.4, h=21.3 and k=20.0 at the 50% of recoveryefficiency for point-like sources). we find that the logarithmic gradient ofthe galaxy counts undergoes a distinct change to a flatter slope in each band:from 0.44 at [17.0, 18.5] to 0.34 at [19.5, 22.0] for the j band; for the hband 0.46 at [15.5, 18.0] to 0.36 at [19.0, 21.0], and in ks the change is from0.53 in the range [15.0, 17.0] to 0.33 in the interval [18.0, 20.0]. theseobservations together with faint optical counts are used to constrain modelsthat include density and luminosity evolution of the local type-dependentluminosity functions. our models imply a decline in the space density ofevolved early-type galaxies with increasing redshift, such that only 30% - 50%of the bulk of the present day red-ellipticals was already in place at z~1.

0903.3988	bright strongly lensed galaxies at redshift z~ 6-7 behind the clusters  abell 1703 and cl0024+161	we report on the discovery of three bright, strongly-lensed objects behindabell 1703 and cl0024+16 from a dropout search over 25 square arcminutes ofdeep nicmos data, with deep acs optical coverage. they are undetected in thedeep acs images below 8500 a and have clear detections in the j and h bands.fits to the acs, nicmos and irac data yield robust photometric redshifts in therange z~6-7 and largely rule out the possibility that they are low-redshiftinterlopers. all three objects are extended, and resolved into a pair of brightknots. the bright i-band dropout in abell 1703 has an h-band ab magnitude of23.9, which makes it one of the brightest known galaxy candidates at z&gt;5.5. ourmodel fits suggest a young, massive galaxy only ~ 60 million years old with amass of ~ 1e10 solar mass. the dropout galaxy candidates behind cl0024+16 areseparated by 2.5" (~ 2 kpc in the source plane), and have h-band ab magnitudesof 25.0 and 25.6. lensing models of cl0024+16 suggest that the objects havecomparable intrinsic magnitudes of ab ~ 27.3, approximately one magnitudefainter than l* at z~6.5. their similar redshifts, spectral energydistribution, and luminosities, coupled with their very close proximity on thesky, suggest that they are spatially associated, and plausibly are physicallybound. combining this sample with two previously reported, similarly magnifiedgalaxy candidates at z~6-8, we find that complex systems with dual nuclei maybe a common feature of high-redshift galaxies.

1002.4691	testing strict hydrostatic equilibrium in simulated clusters of  galaxies: implications to abell 1689	accurate mass determination of clusters of galaxies is crucial if they are tobe used as cosmological probes. however, there are some discrepancies betweencluster masses determined based on gravitational lensing, and x-rayobservations assuming strict hydrostatic equilibirium (i.e., the equilibriumgas pressure is provided entirely by thermal pressure). cosmologicalsimulations suggest that turbulent gas motions remaining from hierarchicalstructure formation may provide a significant contribution to the equilibriumpressure in clusters. we analyze a sample of massive clusters of galaxies drawnfrom high resolution cosmological simulations, and find a significantcontribution (20%-45%) from non-thermal pressure near the center of relaxedclusters, and, in accord with previous studies, a minimum contribution at about0.1 rvir, growing to about 30%-45% at the virial radius, rvir. our resultsstrongly suggest that relaxed clusters should have significant non-thermalsupport in their core region. as an example, we test the validity of stricthydrostatic equilibirium in the well-studied massive galaxy cluster abell 1689using the latest high resolution gravitational lensing and x-ray observations.we find a contribution of about 40% from non-thermal pressure within the coreregion of a1689, suggesting an alternate explanation for the mass discrepancy:the strict hydrostatic equilibirium is not valid in this region.

1008.1753	herschel fir counterparts of selected ly-alpha emitters at z~2.2. fast  evolution since z~3 or missed obscured agns?	ly-alpha emitters (laes) are seen everywhere in the redshift domain fromlocal to z~7. far-infrared (fir) counterparts of laes at different epochs couldprovide direct clues on dust content, extinction, and spectral energydistribution (sed) for these galaxies. we search for fir counterparts of laesthat are optically detected in the goods-north field at redshift z~2.2 usingdata from the herschel space telescope with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs). the lae candidates were isolated via color-magnitudediagram using the medium-band photometry from the alhambra survey, ancillarydata on goods-north, and stellar population models. according to the fitting ofthese spectral synthesis models and fir/optical diagnostics, most of them seemto be obscured galaxies whose spectra are agn-dominated. from the analysis ofthe optical data, we have observed a fraction of agn or composite over sourcetotal number of ~0.75 in the lae population at z~2.2, which is marginallyconsistent with the fraction previously observed at z=2.25 and even at lowredshift (0.2&lt;z&lt;0.45), but significantly different from the one observed atredshift ~3, which could be compatible either with a scenario of rapid changein the agn fraction between the epochs involved or with a non detection ofobscured agn in other z=2-3 lae samples due to lack of deep fir observations.we found three robust fir (pacs) counterparts at z~2.2 in goods-north. thisdemonstrates the possibility of finding dust emission in laes even at higherredshifts.

1103.0044	comparison of an x-ray selected sample of massive lensing clusters with  the marenostrum universe lcdm simulation	a long-standing problem of strong lensing by galaxy clusters regards theobserved high rate of giant gravitational arcs as compared to the predictionsin the framework of the "standard" cosmological model. recently, few otherinconsistencies between theoretical expectations and observations have beenclaimed which regard the large size of the einstein rings and the highconcentrations of few clusters with strong lensing features. all of theseproblems consistently indicate that observed galaxy clusters may begravitational lenses stronger than expected. we use clusters extracted from themarenostrum universe to build up mock catalogs of galaxy clusters selectedthrough their x-ray flux. we use these objects to estimate the probabilitydistributions of lensing cross sections, einstein rings, and concentrations forthe sample of 12 macs clusters at $z&gt;0.5$ presented in ebeling et al. (2007)and discussed in zitrin et al. (2010). we find that simulated clusters produce$\sim 50%$ less arcs than observed clusters do. the medians of thedistributions of the einstein ring sizes differ by $\sim 25%$ betweensimulations and observations. we estimate that, due to cluster triaxiality andorientation biases affecting the lenses with the largest cross sections, theconcentrations of the individual macs clusters inferred from the lensinganalysis should be up to a factor of $\sim 2$ larger than expected from the$\lambda$cdm model. the arc statistics, the einstein ring, and theconcentration problems in strong lensing clusters are mitigated but not solvedon the basis of our analysis. nevertheless, due to the lack of redshifts formost of the multiple image systems used for modeling the macs clusters, theresults of this work will need to be verified with additional data. theupcoming clash program will provide an ideal sample for extending ourcomparison (abridged).

1103.2772	creation of cosmic structure in the complex galaxy cluster merger abell  2744	we present a detailed strong lensing, weak lensing and x-ray analysis ofabell 2744 (z = 0.308), one of the most actively merging galaxy clusters known.it appears to have unleashed `dark', `ghost', `bullet' and `stripped'substructures, each ~10^14 solar masses. the phenomenology is complex and willpresent a challenge for numerical simulations to reproduce. with new, multibandhst imaging, we identify 34 strongly-lensed images of 11 galaxies around themassive southern `core'. combining this with weak lensing data from hst, vltand subaru, we produce the most detailed mass map of this cluster to date. wealso perform an independent analysis of archival chandra x-ray imaging. ouranalyses support a recent claim that the southern core and northwesternsubstructure are post-merger and exhibit morphology similar to the bulletcluster viewed from an angle. from the separation between x-ray emitting gasand lensing mass in the southern core, we derive a new and independentconstraint on the self-interaction cross section of dark matter particlessigma/m &lt;~ 3 \pm 1 cm^2 g^-1. in the northwestern substructure, the gas, darkmatter, and galaxy components have become separated by much larger distances.most curiously, the `ghost' clump (primarily gas) leads the `dark' clump(primarily dark matter) by more than 150 kpc. we propose an enhanced`ram-pressure slingshot' scenario which may have yielded this reversal ofcomponents with such a large separation, but needs further confirmation byfollow-up observations and numerical simulations. a secondary merger involves asecond `bullet' clump in the north and an extremely `stripped' clump to thewest. the latter appears to exhibit the largest separation between dark matterand x-ray emitting baryons detected to date in our sky.

1103.5618	the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash): strong  lensing analysis of abell 383 from 16-band hst wfc3/acs imaging	we examine the inner mass distribution of the relaxed galaxy cluster abell383 in deep 16-band hst/acs+wfc3 imaging taken as part of the clash multi-cycletreasury program. our program is designed to study the dark matter distributionin 25 massive clusters, and balances depth with a wide wavelength coverage tobetter identify lensed systems and generate precise photometric redshifts. thisinformation together with the predictive strength of our strong-lensinganalysis method identifies 13 new multiply-lensed images and candidates, sothat a total of 27 multiple-images of 9 systems are used to tightly constrainthe inner mass profile, $d\log \sigma/d\log r\simeq -0.6\pm 0.1$ (r&lt;160 kpc).we find consistency with the standard distance-redshift relation for the fullrange spanned by the lensed images, 1.01&lt;z&lt;6.03, with the higher redshiftsources deflected through larger angles as expected. the inner mass profilederived here is consistent with the results of our independent weak-lensinganalysis of wide-field subaru images, with good agreement in the region ofoverlap. the overall mass profile is well fitted by an nfw profile withm_{vir}=(5.37^{+0.70}_{-0.63}\pm 0.26) x 10^{14}m_{\odot}/h and a relativelyhigh concentration, c_{vir}=8.77^{+0.44}_{-0.42}\pm 0.23, which lies above thestandard c-m relation similar to other well-studied clusters. the criticalradius of abell 383 is modest by the standards of other lensing clusters,r_{e}\simeq16\pm2\arcsec (for z_s=2.55), so the relatively large number oflensed images uncovered here with precise photometric redshifts validates ourimaging strategy for the clash survey. in total we aim to provide similarlyhigh-quality lensing data for 25 clusters, 20 of which are x-ray selectedrelaxed clusters, enabling a precise determination of the representative massprofile free from lensing bias.

1107.2649	clash: new multiple-images constraining the inner mass profile of macs  j1206.2-0847	we present a strong-lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster macs j1206.2-0847($z$=0.44) using uv, optical, and ir, hst/acs/wfc3 data taken as part of theclash multi-cycle treasury program, with vlt/vimos spectroscopy for some of themultiply-lensed arcs. the clash observations, combined with our mass-model,allow us to identify 47 new multiply-lensed images of 12 distant sources. theseimages, along with the previously known arc, span the redshift range $1\laz\la5.5$, and thus enable us to derive a detailed mass distribution and toaccurately constrain, for the first time, the inner mass-profile of thiscluster. we find an inner profile slope of $d\log \sigma/d\log \theta\simeq-0.55\pm 0.1$ (in the range [1\arcsec, 53\arcsec], or $5\la r \la300$ kpc), ascommonly found for relaxed and well-concentrated clusters. using the manysystems uncovered here we derive credible critical curves and einstein radiifor different source redshifts. for a source at $z_{s}\simeq2.5$, the criticalcurve encloses a large area with an effective einstein radius of$\theta_{e}=28\pm3\arcsec$, and a projected mass of $1.34\pm0.15\times10^{14}m_{\odot}$. from the current understanding of structure formation inconcordance cosmology, these values are relatively high for clusters at$z\sim0.5$, so that detailed studies of the inner mass distribution of clusterssuch as macs j1206.2-0847 can provide stringent tests of the $\lambda$cdmparadigm.

1202.3397	quasi-stellar objects in the alhambra survey. i. photometric redshift  accuracy based on a 23 optical-nir filter photometry	we characterize the ability of the alhambra survey to assign accuratephoto-z's to blagn and qsos based on their alhambra very-low-resolutionoptical-nir spectroscopy. a sample of 170 spectroscopically identified blagnand qsos have been used together with a library of templates (including sedsfrom agn, normal, starburst galaxies and stars) in order to fit the 23photometric data points provided by alhambra in the optical and nir (20medium-band optical filters plus the standard jhks). we find that the alhambraphotometry is able to provide an accurate photo-z and spectral classificationfor ~88% of the spectroscopic sources over 2.5 deg^2 in different areas of thesurvey, all of them brighter than m678=23.5 (equivalent to r(sloan)~24.0). thederived photo-z accuracy is better than 1% and comparable to the most recentresults in other cosmological fields. the fraction of outliers (~12%) is mainlycaused by the larger photometric errors for the faintest sources and theintrinsic variability of the blagn/qso population. a small fraction of outliersmay have an incorrectly assigned spectroscopic redshift. the definition of thealhambra survey in terms of the number of filters, filter properties, areacoverage and depth is able to provide photometric redshifts for blagn/qsos witha precision similar to any previous survey that makes use of medium-bandoptical photometry. in agreement with previous literature results, our analysisalso reveals that, in the 0&lt;z&lt;4 redshift interval, very accurate photo-z can beobtained without the use of near-ir broadband photometry at the expense of aslight increase of outliers. the nir importance is expected to increase athigher redshifts (z&gt;4). these results are relevant for the design of futureoptical follow-ups of surveys with a large fraction of blagn, as it is the casefor x-rays or radio surveys.

1204.0517	detecting gravitationally lensed population iii galaxies with the hubble  space telescope and the james webb space telescope	small galaxies consisting entirely of population iii (pop iii) stars may format high redshifts, and could constitute one of the best probes of such stars.here, we explore the prospects of detecting gravitationally lensed pop iiigalaxies behind the galaxy cluster j0717.5+3745 (j0717) with both the hubblespace telescope (hst) and the upcoming james webb space telescope (jwst). byprojecting simulated catalogs of pop iii galaxies at z~7-15 through the j0717magnification maps, we estimate the lensed number counts as a function of fluxdetection threshold. we find that the ongoing hst survey clash, targeting atotal of 25 galaxy clusters including j0717, potentially could detect a smallnumber of pop iii galaxies if ~1% of the baryons in these systems have beenconverted into pop iii stars. using jwst exposures of j0717, this limit can bepushed to ~0.1% of the baryons. ultra-deep jwst observations of unlensed fieldsare predicted to do somewhat worse, but will be able to probe pop iii galaxieswith luminosities intermediate between those detectable in hst/clash and injwst observations of j0717. we also explain how current measurements of thegalaxy luminosity function at z=7-10 can be used to constrain pop iii galaxymodels with very high star formation efficiencies (~10% of the baryonsconverted into pop iii stars).

1307.5847	evidence for ubiquitous, high-ew nebular emission in z~7 galaxies:  towards a clean measurement of the specific star formation rate using a  sample of bright, magnified galaxies	growing observational evidence now indicates that nebular line emission has asignificant impact on the rest-frame optical fluxes of z~5-7 galaxies observedwith spitzer. this line emission makes z~5-7 galaxies appear more massive, withlower specific star formation rates. however, corrections for this lineemission have been very difficult to perform reliably due to huge uncertaintieson the overall strength of such emission at z&gt;~5.5. here, we present the mostdirect observational evidence yet for ubiquitous high-ew [oiii]+hbeta lineemission in lyman-break galaxies at z~7, while also presenting a strategy foran improved measurement of the ssfr at z~7. we accomplish this through theselection of bright galaxies in the narrow redshift window z~6.6-7.0 where theirac 4.5 micron flux provides a clean measurement of the stellar continuumlight. observed 4.5 micron fluxes in this window contrast with the 3.6 micronfluxes which are contaminated by the prominent [oiii]+hbeta lines. to ensure ahigh s/n for our irac flux measurements, we consider only the brightest(h_{160}&lt;26 mag) magnified galaxies we have identified in clash and otherprograms targeting galaxy clusters. remarkably, the mean rest-frame opticalcolor for our bright seven-source sample is very blue, [3.6]-[4.5]=-0.9+/-0.3.such blue colors cannot be explained by the stellar continuum light and requirethat the rest-frame ew of [oiii]+hbeta be greater than 637 angstroms for theaverage source. the bluest four sources from our seven-source sample require aneven more extreme ew of 1582 angstroms. our derived lower limit for the mean[oiii]+hbeta ew could underestimate the true ew by ~2x based on a simplemodeling of the redshift distribution of our sources. we can also set a robustlower limit of &gt;~4 gyr^-1 on the specific star formation rates based on themean sed for our seven-source sample.

1307.5867	clash-vlt: the mass, velocity-anisotropy, and pseudo-phase-space density  profiles of the z=0.44 galaxy cluster macs 1206.2-0847	we use an unprecedented data-set of about 600 redshifts for cluster members,obtained as part of a vlt/vimos large programme, to constrain the mass profileof the z=0.44 cluster macs j1206.2-0847 over the radial range 0-5 mpc (0-2.5virial radii) using the mamposst and caustic methods. we then add externalconstraints from our previous gravitational lensing analysis. we invert thejeans equation to obtain the velocity-anisotropy profiles of cluster members.with the mass-density and velocity-anisotropy profiles we then obtain the firstdetermination of a cluster pseudo-phase-space density profile. the kinematicsand lensing determinations of the cluster mass profile are in excellentagreement. this is very well fitted by a nfw model with mass m200=(1.4 +- 0.2)10^15 msun and concentration c200=6 +- 1, only slightly higher than theoreticalexpectations. other mass profile models also provide acceptable fits to ourdata, of (slightly) lower (burkert, hernquist, and softened isothermal sphere)or comparable (einasto) quality than nfw. the velocity anisotropy profiles ofthe passive and star-forming cluster members are similar, close to isotropicnear the center and increasingly radial outside. passive cluster members followextremely well the theoretical expectations for the pseudo-phase-space densityprofile and the relation between the slope of the mass-density profile and thevelocity anisotropy. star-forming cluster members show marginal deviations fromtheoretical expectations. this is the most accurate determination of a clustermass profile out to a radius of 5 mpc, and the only determination of thevelocity-anisotropy and pseudo-phase-space density profiles of both passive andstar-forming galaxies for an individual cluster [abridged]

(2013) using dropout techniques with the 16-band hst photometry acquired aspart of the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash). obtainedas part of the clash-vlt survey, the vimos medium-resolution spectra of thissource show a very faint continuum between ~8700a and ~9300a and a prominentemission line at 8643a, which can be readily identified with lyman-alpha atz=6.110. the emission line exhibits an asymmetric profile, with a morepronounced red wing. the rest-frame equivalent width of the line is ew=79+-10a.after correcting for magnification, the star-formation rate (sfr) estimatedfrom the lya line is sfr(lya)=11 m_{sol}/yr and that estimated from the uv datais sfr(uv)=3 m_{sol}/yr. we estimate that the effective radius of the source isr_e&lt;~0.4 kpc, which implies a star formation surface mass density sigma_{sfr}&gt;6m_{sol}/yr/kpc^2 and, using the kennicutt-schmidt relation, a gas surface massdensity sigma_{gas}&gt;10^3 m_{sol}/pc^2. our results support the idea that thismagnified, distant galaxy is a young and compact object with 0.4 l^* at z=6,with comparable amount of mass in gas and stars. future follow-up observationswith alma will provide valuable insight into the sfr and molecular gas contentof this source. in the spirit of the frontier fields initiative, we alsopublish the redshifts of several multiply imaged sources and other backgroundobjects which will help improving the strong lensing model of this galaxycluster.

1401.4993	the alhambra survey: an empirical estimation of the cosmic variance for  merger fraction studies based on close pairs	our goal is to estimate empirically, for the first time, the cosmic variancethat affects merger fraction studies based on close pairs. we compute themerger fraction from photometric redshift close pairs with 10h^-1 kpc &lt;= rp &lt;=50h^-1 kpc and dv &lt;= 500 km/s, and measure it in the 48 sub-fields of thealhambra survey. we study the distribution of the measured merger fractions,that follow a log-normal function, and estimate the cosmic variance sigma_v asthe intrinsic dispersion of the observed distribution. we develop a maximumlikelihood estimator to measure a reliable sigma_v and avoid the dispersion dueto the observational errors (including the poisson shot noise term). the cosmicvariance of the merger fraction depends mainly on (i) the number density of thepopulations under study, both for the principal (n_1) and the companion (n_2)galaxy in the close pair, and (ii) the probed cosmic volume v_c. we find asignificant dependence on neither the search radius used to define closecompanions, the redshift, nor the physical selection (luminosity or stellarmass) of the samples. we provide a parametrisation of the cosmic variance withn_1, n_2, and v_c, sigma_v = 0.48 n_1^{-0.54} v_c^{-0.48} (n_2/n_1)^{-0.37}.thanks to this prescription, future merger fraction studies based on closepairs could account properly for the cosmic variance on their results.

1402.4170	a free-form lensing grid solution for a1689 with new mutiple images	hubble space telescope imaging of the galaxy cluster abell 1689 has revealedan exceptional number of strongly lensed multiply-imaged galaxies, includinghigh-redshift candidates. previous studies have used this data to obtain themost detailed dark matter reconstructions of any galaxy cluster to date,resolving substructures ~25 kpc across. we examine abell 1689 (hereafter,a1689) non-parametrically, combining strongly lensed images and weakdistortions from wider field subaru imaging, and we incorporate member galaxiesto improve the lens solution. strongly lensed galaxies are often locallyaffected by member galaxies, however, these perturbations cannot be recoveredin grid based reconstructions because the lensing information is too sparse toresolve member galaxies. by adding luminosity-scaled member galaxy deflectionsto our smooth grid we can derive meaningful solutions with sufficient accuracyto permit the identification of our own strongly lensed images, so our modelbecomes self consistent. we identify 11 new multiply lensed system candidatesand clarify previously ambiguous cases, in the deepest optical and nir data todate from hubble and subaru. our improved spatial resolution brings up newfeatures not seen when the weak and strong lensing effects are used separately,including clumps and filamentary dark matter around the main halo. ourtreatment means we can obtain an objective mass ratio between the cluster andgalaxy components, for examining the extent of tidal stripping of the luminousmember galaxies. we find a typical mass-to-light ratios of m/l_b = 21 insidethe r&lt;1 arcminute region that drops to m/l_b = 17 inside the r&lt;40 arcsecondregion. our model independence means we can objectively evaluate thecompetitiveness of stacking cluster lenses for defining the geometriclensing-distance-redshift relation in a model independent way.

1505.07555	stellar populations of galaxies in the alhambra survey up to $z \sim 1$.  i. muffit: a multi-filter fitting code for stellar population diagnostics	we present muffit, a new generic code optimized to retrieve the main stellarpopulation parameters of galaxies in photometric multi-filter surveys, and wecheck its reliability and feasibility with real galaxy data from the alhambrasurvey. making use of an error-weighted $\chi^2$-test, we compare themulti-filter fluxes of galaxies with the synthetic photometry of mixtures oftwo single stellar populations at different redshifts and extinctions, toprovide through a monte carlo method the most likely range of stellarpopulation parameters (mainly ages and metallicities), extinctions, redshifts,and stellar masses. to improve the diagnostic reliability, muffit identifiesand removes from the analysis those bands that are significantly affected byemission lines. we highlight that the retrieved age-metallicity locus for asample of $z \le 0.22$ early-type galaxies in alhambra at different stellarmass bins are in very good agreement with the ones from sdss spectroscopicdiagnostics. moreover, a one-to-one comparison between the redshifts, ages,metallicities, and stellar masses derived spectroscopically for sdss and bymuffit for alhambra reveals good qualitative agreements in all the parameters.in addition, and using as input the results from photometric-redshift codes,muffit improves the photometric-redshift accuracy by $\sim 10$-$20\%$, and italso detects nebular emissions in galaxies, providing physical informationabout their strengths. our results show the potential of multi-filter galaxydata to conduct reliable stellar population studies with the appropiateanalysis techniques, as muffit.

1507.05846	the impact from survey depth and resolution on the morphological  classification of galaxies	we consistently analyse for the first time the impact of survey depth andspatial resolution on the most used morphological parameters for classifyinggalaxies through non-parametric methods: abraham and conselice-bershadyconcentration indices, gini, m20 moment of light, asymmetry, and smoothness.three different non-local datasets are used, alhambra and sxds (examples ofdeep ground-based surveys), and cosmos (deep space-based survey). we used asample of 3000 local, visually classified galaxies, measuring theirmorphological parameters at their real redshifts (z ~ 0). then we simulatedthem to match the redshift and magnitude distributions of galaxies in thenon-local surveys. the comparisons of the two sets allow to put constraints onthe use of each parameter for morphological classification and evaluate theeffectiveness of the commonly used morphological diagnostic diagrams. allanalysed parameters suffer from biases related to spatial resolution and depth,the impact of the former being much stronger. when including asymmetry andsmoothness in classification diagrams, the noise effects must be taken intoaccount carefully, especially for ground-based surveys. m20 is significantlyaffected, changing both the shape and range of its distribution at allbrightness levels.we suggest that diagnostic diagrams based on 2 - 3 parametersshould be avoided when classifying galaxies in ground-based surveys,independently of their brightness; for cosmos they should be avoided forgalaxies fainter than f814 = 23.0. these results can be applied directly tosurveys similar to alhambra, sxds and cosmos, and also can serve as anupper/lower limit for shallower/deeper ones.

1508.02861	the alhambra survey : estimation of the clustering signal encoded in the  cosmic variance	the relative cosmic variance ($\sigma_v$) is a fundamental source ofuncertainty in pencil-beam surveys and, as a particular case of count-in-cellstatistics, can be used to estimate the bias between galaxies and theirunderlying dark-matter distribution. our goal is to test the significance ofthe clustering information encoded in the $\sigma_v$ measured in the alhambrasurvey. we measure the cosmic variance of several galaxy populations selectedwith $b-$band luminosity at $0.35 \leq z &lt; 1.05$ as the intrinsic dispersion inthe number density distribution derived from the 48 alhambra subfields. wecompare the observational $\sigma_v$ with the cosmic variance of the darkmatter expected from the theory, $\sigma_{v,{\rm dm}}$. this provides anestimation of the galaxy bias $b$. the galaxy bias from the cosmic variance isin excellent agreement with the bias estimated by two-point correlationfunction analysis in alhambra. this holds for different redshift bins, for redand blue subsamples, and for several $b-$band luminosity selections. we findthat $b$ increases with the $b-$band luminosity and the redshift, as expectedfrom previous work. moreover, red galaxies have a larger bias than bluegalaxies, with a relative bias of $b_{\rm rel} = 1.4 \pm 0.2$. our resultsdemonstrate that the cosmic variance measured in alhambra is due to theclustering of galaxies and can be used to characterise the $\sigma_v$ affectingpencil-beam surveys. in addition, it can also be used to estimate the galaxybias $b$ from a method independent of correlation functions.

1512.04555	clash-vlt: a highly precise strong lensing model of the galaxy cluster  rxc j2248.7-4431 (abell s1063) and prospects for cosmography	we perform a comprehensive study of the total mass distribution of the galaxycluster rxcj2248 ($z=0.348$) with a set of high-precision strong lensingmodels, which take advantage of extensive spectroscopic information on manymultiply lensed systems. in the effort to understand and quantify inherentsystematics in parametric strong lensing modelling, we explore a collection of22 models where we use different samples of multiple image families,parametrizations of the mass distribution and cosmological parameters. as inputinformation for the strong lensing models, we use the clash hst imaging dataand spectroscopic follow-up observations, carried out with the vimos and musespectrographs, to identify bona-fide multiple images. a total of 16 backgroundsources, over the redshift range $1.0-6.1$, are multiply lensed into 47 images,24 of which are spectroscopically confirmed and belong to 10 individualsources. the cluster total mass distribution and underlying cosmology in themodels are optimized by matching the observed positions of the multiple imageson the lens plane. we show that with a careful selection of a sample ofspectroscopically confirmed multiple images, the best-fit model reproducestheir observed positions with a rms of $0.3$ in a fixed flat $\lambda$cdmcosmology, whereas the lack of spectroscopic information lead to biases in thevalues of the model parameters. allowing cosmological parameters to varytogether with the cluster parameters, we find (at $68\%$ confidence level)$\omega_m=0.25^{+0.13}_{-0.16}$ and $w=-1.07^{+0.16}_{-0.42}$ for a flat$\lambda$cdm model, and $\omega_m=0.31^{+0.12}_{-0.13}$ and$\omega_\lambda=0.38^{+0.38}_{-0.27}$ for a universe with $w=-1$ and freecurvature. using toy models mimicking the overall configuration of rxcj2248, weestimate the impact of the line of sight mass structure on the positional rmsto be $0.3\pm 0.1$.(abridged)

astro-ph;0107340	the spatial clustering of distant, z~1, early-type galaxies	we examine the spatial clustering of extremely red objects (eros) found in arelatively large survey of 700 arcmin^2, containing 400 galaxies with r-ks&gt;5 toks=19.2. a comoving correlation length r_0=12\pm3 /h mpc is derived, under theassumption that the selection function is described by a passively evolvingearly-type galaxy population, with an effective redshift of z~1.2. thiscorrelation length is very similar to that of local l* elliptical galaxiesimplying, at face value, no significant clustering evolution in comovingcoordinates of early-type galaxies to the limiting depth of our sample, z~1.5.a rapidly evolving clustering bias can be designed to reproduce a null result;however, our data do not show the corresponding strong reduction in the averagepopulation density expected for consistency with underlying growth of themass-function. we discuss our data in the context of recent ideas regardingbias evolution. the uncertainty we quote on r_0 accounts for the spikeyredshift distribution expected along relatively narrow sightlines, which wequantify with detailed simulations. this is an improvement over the standarduse of limber's equation which, because of its implicit assumption of a smoothselection function, underestimates the true noise by a factor of ~ 3 for theparameters of our survey. we propose a general recipe for the analysis ofangular clustering, suggesting that any measurement of the angular clusteringamplitude, a, has an intrinsic additional uncertainty of \sigma_a/a=\sqrt{ac},where ac is the appropriate integral constraint.

astro-ph;0302599	the k20 survey. v the evolution of the near-ir luminosity function	we present the galaxy rest-frame near-ir luminosity function (lf) and itscosmic evolution to z=1.5 based on a spectroscopic survey of a magnitudelimited sample of galaxies with ks&lt;20 (the k20 survey, cimatti et al. 2002b).the lfs have been derived in the rest-frame j and ks bands using 3 z bins(z_mean= 0.5, 1, 1.5) and compared to the local near-ir lf. the faint-end ofthe lfs is consistent with the local estimates, with no evidence for a changeeither in the slope or normalization up to z&lt;1.3. viceversa, the density ofluminous galaxies (m_ks-5logh_70&lt;-25.5) is higher than locally at all z andrelatively constant or mildly increasing with z within our sample. the data areconsistent with a mild luminosity evolution both in the j and ks-band up toz=1.5 (deltam_j=-0.69+-0.12 and deltam_k=-0.54+-0.12 at z=1). moreover, we findthat red and early-type galaxies dominate the bright-end of the lf, and thattheir number density shows at most a small decrease (&lt;30%) up to z=1, thussuggesting that massive elliptical galaxies were already in place at z=1 andthey should have formed their stars and assembled their mass at higher z. thereappears to be a correlation of the optical/near-ir colors with near-irluminosities, the most luminous/massive galaxies being red/old. we find a slowevolution with z of the near-ir comoving luminosity density to z=1.5. finally,we show that hierarchical models overpredict significantly the density of lowluminosity galaxies at z&lt;=1 and underpredict the density of luminous galaxiesat z&gt;=1, whereas ple models are more consistent with the data up to z=1.5. thegif model (kaufmann et al. 1999) shows a clear deficiency of red luminousgalaxies at z=1 compared to our observations and predicts a decrease ofluminous galaxies with z not observed in our sample.

astro-ph;0306215	star formation at z~6: i-dropouts in the acs gto fields	using an i-z dropout criterion, we determine the space density of z~6galaxies from two deep acs gto fields with deep optical-ir imaging. a total of23 objects are found over 46 arcmin^2, or ~0.5 objects/arcmin^2 down to z~27.3(6 sigma; all ab mag) (including one probable z~6 agn). combining deep isaacdata for our rdcs1252-2927 field (j~25.7 and ks~25.0 (5 sigma)) and nicmos datafor the hdf north (jh~27.3 (5 sigma)), we verify that these dropouts have flatspectral slopes. i-dropouts in our sample range in luminosity from ~1.5 l*(z~25.6) to ~0.3 l* (z~27.3) with the exception of one very bright candidate atz~24.2. the half-light radii vary from 0.09" to 0.29", or 0.5 kpc to 1.7 kpc.we derive the z~6 rest-frame uv luminosity density using three differentprocedures, each utilizing simulations based on a cdf south v dropout sample.first, we compare our findings with a no-evolution projection of this v-dropoutsample. we find 23+/-25% more i-dropouts than we predict. adopting previousresults to z~5, this works out to a 20+/-29% drop in the luminosity densityfrom z~3 to z~6. second, we use these same v-dropout simulations to derive aselection function for our i-dropout sample and compute the uv-luminositydensity (7.2+/-2.5 x 10^25 ergs/s/hz/mpc^3 down to z~27). we find a 39+/-21%drop over the same redshift range. this is our preferred value and suggests astar formation rate of 0.0090+/-0.0031 m_sol/yr/mpc^3 to z~27, or ~0.036+/-0.012 m_sol/yr/mpc^3 extrapolating the lf to the faint limit. third, we followa very similar procedure, but assume no incompleteness, finding a luminositydensity which is ~2-3x lower. this final estimate constitutes a lower limit.all three estimates are within the canonical range of luminosity densitiesnecessary for reionization of the universe at this epoch.

(2004a)based on the same data. our estimated mass does not rely on any priorinformation about the distribution of dark matter in the cluster. the peak ofthe mass distribution falls very close to the central cd and there issubstructure near the center suggesting that the cluster is not fully relaxed.we also examine the effect on the recovered mass when we include theuncertainties in the redshift of the sources and in the original shape of thesources. using simulations designed to mimic the data, we identify some biasesin our reconstructed mass distribution. we find that the recovered mass isbiased toward lower masses beyond 1 arcmin (150 kpc) from the central cd andthat in the very center we may be affected by degeneracy problems. on the otherhand, we confirm that the reconstructed mass between 25'' and 70'' is a robust,unbiased estimate of the true mass distribution and is compatible with an nfwprofile.

astro-ph;9712061	hubble space telescope imaging of the cfrs and ldss redshift surveys ii:  structural parameter and the evolution of disk galaxies to z=1	(abridged) several aspects of the evolution of star-forming galaxies arestudied using measures of the 2-dimensional surface brightness profile of asample of 341 faint objects selected from the cfrs and ldss redshift surveysthat have been observed with the hubble space telescope. the size function ofdisk scale lengths in disk-dominated galaxies is found to stay roughly constantto z=1. this result, which is strengthened by inclusion of the local de jong etal (1996) size function, suggests that the scale lengths of typical disks cannot have grown substantially with cosmic epoch since z=1, unless acorresponding number of large disks have been destroyed through merging. inaddition to a roughly constant number density, the galaxies with large diskshave, as a set, properties consistent with the idea that they are similargalaxies observed at different cosmic epochs. however, on average, they showhigher b-band disk surface brightnesses, bluer overall (u-v) colors, higher[oii] 3727 equivalent widths and less regular morphologies at high redshiftthan at low redshift, suggesting an increase in the star-formation rate by afactor of about 3 to z=0.7. this is consistent with the expectations of recentmodels for the evolution of the disk of the milky way and similar galaxies. theevolution of the large disk galaxies is probably not sufficient to account forthe evolution of the overall luminosity function of galaxies over the interval0&lt;z&lt;1, especially if omega=1. analysis of the half-light radii of all thegalaxies in the sample and construction of the bivariate size-luminosityfunction suggests that larger changes in the galaxy population are due tosmaller galaxies, those with half-light radii around 5 h_{50}^{-1} kpc

astro-ph;9909211	hubble space telescope imaging of the cfrs and ldss redshift surveys -  iv. influence of mergers in the evolution of faint field galaxies from z~1	hst images of a sample of 285 galaxies with measured z from the cfrs andautofib-ldss redshift surveys are analysed to derive the evolution of themerger fraction out to z~1. we have performed visual and machine-based mergeridentifications, as well as counts of bright pairs of galaxies with magnitudedifferences less than 1.5 mag. we find that the pair fraction increases with z,with up to ~20% of the galaxies being in physical pairs at z~0.75-1. we derivea merger fraction varying with z as (1+z)^{3.2 +/- 0.6}, after correction forline-of-sight contamination, in excellent agreement with the merger fractionderived from the visual classification of mergers for which m = 3.4 +/- 0.6.after correcting for seeing effects on the ground-based selection of surveygalaxies, we conclude that the pair fraction evolves as (1+z)^{2.7 +/- 0.6}.this implies that an average l* galaxy will have undergone 0.8 to 1.8 mergerevents from z=1 to 0, with 0.5 to 1.2 merger events occuring in a 2 gyr timespan at z~0.9. this result is consistent with predictions from semi-analyticalmodels of galaxy formation. from the simple co-addition of the observedluminosities of the galaxies in pairs, physical mergers are computed to lead toa brightening of 0.5 mag for each pair on average, and a boost in starformation rate of a factor of 2, as derived from the average [o ii] equivalentwidths. mergers of galaxies are therefore contributing significantly to theevolution of both the luminosity function and luminosity density of theuniverse out to z~1.

0812.3568	optimal filter systems for photometric redshift estimation	in the next years, several cosmological surveys will rely on imaging data toestimate the redshift of galaxies, using traditional filter systems with 4-5optical broad bands; narrower filters improve the spectral resolution, butstrongly reduce the total system throughput. we explore how photometricredshift performance depends on the number of filters n_f, characterizing thesurvey depth through the fraction of galaxies with unambiguous redshiftestimates. for a combination of total exposure time and telescope imaging areaof 270 hrs m^2, 4-5 filter systems perform significantly worse, both incompleteness depth and precision, than systems with n_f &gt;= 8 filters. ourresults suggest that for low n_f, the color-redshift degeneracies overwhelm theimprovements in photometric depth, and that even at higher n_f, the effectivephotometric redshift depth decreases much more slowly with filter width thannaively expected from the reduction in s/n. adding near-ir observationsimproves the performance of low n_f systems, but still the system whichmaximizes the photometric redshift completeness is formed by 9 filters withlogarithmically increasing bandwidth (constant resolution) and half-bandoverlap, reaching ~0.7 mag deeper, with 10% better redshift precision, than 4-5filter systems. a system with 20 constant-width, non-overlapping filtersreaches only ~0.1 mag shallower than 4-5 filter systems, but has a precisionalmost 3 times better, dz = 0.014(1+z) vs. dz = 0.042(1+z). we briefly discussa practical implementation of such a photometric system: the alhambra survey.
