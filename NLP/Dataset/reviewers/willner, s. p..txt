0904.4479	irs spectroscopy and multi-wavelength study of luminous star-forming  galaxies at z~1.9	we analyze a sample of galaxies chosen to have f24&gt;0.5 mjy and satisfy acertain irac color criterion. irs spectra yield redshifts, spectral types, andpah luminosities, to which we add multi-wavelength broadband photometry.stellar population modeling and irs spectra together demonstrate that thedouble criteria used to select this sample have efficiently isolated massivestar-forming galaxies at z~1.9. this is the first starburst-dominated ulirgsample at high redshift with total infrared luminosity measured directly fromfir and millimeter photometry, and as such gives us the first accurate view ofbroadband seds for starburst galaxies at extremely high luminosity and at allwavelengths. similar broadband data are assembled for three other galaxysamples -- local starburst galaxies, local agn/ulirgs, and a second24mu-luminous z~1.9 sample dominated by agn. l(pah)/l(ir) for the new z~1.9starburst sample is the highest ever seen, some three times higher than inlocal starbursts, whereas in agns this ratio is depressed below the starbursttrend, often severely. several pieces of evidence imply that agns exist in thisstarburst dominated sample, except two of which even host very strong agn,while they still have very strong pah emission. the acs images show mostobjects have very extended morphologies in the rest-frame uv band, thusextended distribution of pah molecules. such an extended distribution preventsfurther destruction pah molecules by central agns. we conclude that objects inthis sample are ulirgs powered mainly by starburst; and the total infraredluminosity density contributed by this type of objects is 0.9-2.6x 10^7lsol/mpc^3.

0905.3825	nearby galaxies in the 2micron all sky survey i. k-band luminosity  functions	differential k-band luminosity functions (lfs) are presented for a completesample of 1613 nearby bright galaxies segregated by visible morphology. the lffor late-type spirals follows a power law that rises towards low luminositieswhereas the lfs for ellipticals, lenticulars and bulge-dominated spirals arepeaked and decline toward both higher and lower luminosities. eachmorphological type (e, s0, s0/a-sab, sb-sbc, sc-scd) contributes approximatelyequally to the overall k-band luminosity density of galaxies in the localuniverse. type averaged bulge/disk ratios are used to subtract the diskcomponent leading to the prediction that the k-band lf for bulges is bimodalwith ellipticals dominating the high luminosity peak, comprising 60% of thebulge luminosity density in the local universe with the remaining 40%contributed by lenticulars and the bulges of spirals. overall, bulgescontribute 30% of the galaxy luminosity density at k in the local universe withspiral disks making up the remainder. if bulge luminosities indicate centralblack hole masses, then our results predict that the black hole mass functionis also bimodal.

0906.0024	the spitzer deep, wide-field survey	the spitzer deep, wide-field survey (sdwfs) is a four-epoch infrared surveyof ten square degrees in the bootes field of the noao deep wide-field surveyusing the irac instrument on the spitzer space telescope. sdwfs, a cycle fourspitzer legacy project, occupies a unique position in the area-depth surveyspace defined by other spitzer surveys. the four epochs that make up sdwfspermit -- for the first time -- the selection of infrared-variable and highproper motion objects over a wide field on timescales of years. because of itslarge survey volume, sdwfs is sensitive to galaxies out to z~3 with relativelylittle impact from cosmic variance for all but the richest systems. the sdwfsdatasets will thus be especially useful for characterizing galaxy evolutionbeyond z~1.5. this paper explains the sdwfs observing strategy and dataprocessing, presents the sdwfs mosaics and source catalogs, and discusses someearly scientific findings. the publicly-released, full-depth catalogs contain6.78, 5.23, 1.20, and 0.96 x 10e5 distinct sources detected to the average5-sigma, 4" diameter, aperture-corrected limits of 19.77, 18.83, 16.50, and15.82 vega mag at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 micron, respectively. the sdwfs numbercounts and color-color distribution are consistent with other, earlier spitzersurveys. at the 6 min integration time of the sdwfs irac imaging, more than 50%of isolated first radio sources and more than 80% of on-axis xbootes sourcesare detected out to 8.0 micron. finally, we present the four highest propermotion irac-selected sources identified from the multi-epoch imaging, two ofwhich are likely field brown dwarfs of mid-t spectral class.

0909.5367	on the nature of the first galaxies selected at 350 microns	[abridged] we present constraints on the nature of the first galaxiesselected at 350 microns. the sample includes galaxies discovered in the deepestblank-field survey at 350 microns (in the bootes deep field) and also laterserendipitous detections in the lockman hole. spectral energy distributiontemplates are fit to identified counterparts, and the sample is found tocomprise ir-luminous galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;3 predominantly powered by star formation.the first spectrum of a 350-micron-selected galaxy provides an additionalconfirmation, showing prominent dust grain features typically associated withstar-forming galaxies.  compared to submillimeter galaxies selected at 850 and 1100 microns, galaxiesselected at 350 microns have a similar range of far-infrared colortemperatures. however, no 350-micron-selected sources are reliably detected at850 or 1100 microns. galaxies in our sample with redshifts 1&lt;z&lt;2 show a tightcorrelation between the far- and mid-infrared flux densities, but galaxies athigher redshifts show a large dispersion in their mid- to far-infrared colors.  the 350-micron flux densities (15&lt;s(350)&lt;40 mjy) place these objects near theherschel/spire 350-micron confusion threshold, with the lower limit on the starformation rate density suggesting the bulk of the 350-micron contribution willcome from less luminous infrared sources and normal galaxies.

1002.3365	mid-infrared variability from the spitzer deep, wide-field survey	we use the multi-epoch, mid-infrared spitzer deep, wide-field survey toinvestigate the variability of 474,179 objects in 8.1 deg^2 of the ndwfs bootesfield. we perform a difference image analysis of the four available epochsbetween 2004 and 2008, focusing on the deeper 3.6 and 4.5 micron bands. we findthat 1.1% of the studied sample meet our standard selection criteria for beingclassed as a variable source. we require that the 3.6 and 4.5 micronlight-curves are strongly correlated (r&gt;0.8) and that their joint varianceexceeds that for all sources with the same magnitude by 2 sigma. we thenexamine the mid-ir colors of the variable sources and match them with x-raysources from the xbootes survey, radio catalogs, 24 micron-selected agncandidates, and spectroscopically identified agns from the agn and galaxyevolution survey (ages). based on their mid-ir colors, most of the variablesources are agns (76%), with smaller contributions from stars (11%), galaxies(6%), and unclassified objects. most of the stellar, galaxy and unclassifiedsources are false positives. for our standard selection criteria, 11-12% of themid-ir counterparts to x-ray sources, 24 micron-selected agn candidates andspectroscopically identified agns show variability. mid-ir agn variability canbe well described by a single power-law structure function with a power-lawindex of 0.5 at both 3.6 and 4.5 microns, and an amplitude of 0.1 mag onrest-frame time scales of 2 years. the variability amplitude is higher forshorter rest-frame wavelengths and lower luminosities.

1005.3331	aegis: a multi-wavelength study of spitzer power-law galaxies	this paper analyzes a sample of 489 spitzer/irac sources in the extendedgroth strip whose spectral energy distributions fit a red power law from 3.6 to8.0 \micron. the median for sources with known redshift is &lt;z&gt;=1.6. though allor nearly all of the sample are likely to be active galactic nuclei, only 33%were detected in the egs x-ray survey (aegis-x) using 200 ks chandraobservations. the detected sources are x-ray luminous with l_x &gt; 10^43 erg/sand moderately to heavily obscured with n_h &gt; 10^22 cm^-2. stacking thex-ray-undetected sample members yields a statistically significant x-raysignal, suggesting that they are on average more distant or more obscured thansources with x-ray detections. the ratio of x-ray to mid-infrared fluxessuggests that a substantial fraction of the sources undetected in x-rays areobscured at the compton-thick level, in contrast to the x-ray-detected sources,all of which appear to be compton-thin. for the x-ray-detected power-lawsources with redshifts, an x-ray luminosity l_x ~ 10^44 erg/s marks atransition between low-luminosity, blue sources dominated by the host galaxy tohigh-luminosity, red power-law sources dominated by nuclear activity.x-ray-to-optical ratios, infrared variability, and 24 micron properties of thesample are consistent with the identification of infrared power-law sources asactive nuclei, but a rough estimate is that only 22% of agns are selected bythe power law criteria. comparison of the power-law selection technique andvarious irac color criteria for identifying agns confirms that high-redshiftsamples selected via simple irac colors may be heavily contaminated bystarlight-dominated objects.

1007.0105	mid-infrared spectroscopy of high-redshift 3crr sources	using the spitzer space telescope, we have obtained rest frame 9-16mu spectraof 11 quasars and 9 radio galaxies from the 3crr catalog at redshifts1.0&lt;z&lt;1.4. this complete flux-limited 178mhz-selected sample is unbiased withrespect to orientation and therefore suited to study orientation-dependenteffects in the most powerful active galactic nuclei (agn). the mean radiogalaxy spectrum shows a clear silicate absorption feature (tau_9.7mu = 1.1)whereas the mean quasar spectrum shows silicates in emission. the mean radiogalaxy spectrum matches a dust-absorbed mean quasar spectrum in both shape andoverall flux level. the data for individual objects conform to these results.the trend of the silicate depth to increase with decreasing core fraction ofthe radio source further supports that for this sample, orientation is the maindriver for the difference between radio galaxies and quasars, as predicted byagn unification. however, comparing our high-z sample with lower redshift 3crrobjects reveals that the absorption of the high-z radio galaxy mir continuum islower than expected from a scaled up version of lower luminosity sources, andwe discuss some effects that may explain these trends.

1007.3494	aegis: demographics of x-ray and optically selected agns	we develop a new diagnostic method to classify galaxies into agn hosts,star-forming galaxies, and absorption-dominated galaxies by combining the [oiii]/hbeta ratio with rest-frame u-b color. this can be used to robustly selectagns in galaxy samples at intermediate redshifts (z&lt;1). we compare the resultof this optical agn selection with x-ray selection using a sample of 3150galaxies with 0.3&lt;z&lt;0.8 and i_ab&lt;22, selected from the deep2 galaxy redshiftsurvey and the all-wavelength extended groth strip international survey(aegis). among the 146 x-ray sources in this sample, 58% are classifiedoptically as emission-line agns, the rest as star-forming galaxies orabsorption-dominated galaxies. the latter are also known as "x-ray bright,optically normal galaxies" (xbongs). analysis of the relationship betweenoptical emission lines and x-ray properties shows that the completeness ofoptical agn selection suffers from dependence on the star formation rate andthe quality of observed spectra. it also shows that xbongs do not appear to bea physically distinct population from other x-ray detected, emission-line agns.on the other hand, x-ray agn selection also has strong bias. about 2/3 of allemission-line agns at l_bol&gt;10^44 erg/s in our sample are not detected in our200 ks chandra images, most likely due to moderate or heavy absorption by gasnear the agn. the 2--7 kev detection rate of seyfert 2s at z~0.6 suggests thattheir column density distribution and compton-thick fraction are similar tothat of local seyferts. multiple sample selection techniques are needed toobtain as complete a sample as possible.

1010.1385	the spitzer high redshift radio galaxy survey	we present results from a comprehensive imaging survey of 70 radio galaxiesat redshifts 1&lt;z&lt;5.2 using all three cameras onboard the spitzer spacetelescope. the resulting spectral energy distributions unambiguously show astellar population in 46 sources and hot dust emission associated with theactive nucleus in 59. using a new restframe s_3um/s_1.6um versus s_um/s_3umcriterion, we identify 42 sources where the restframe 1.6um emission from thestellar population can be measured. for these radio galaxies, the medianstellar mass is high, 2x10^11 m_sun, and remarkably constant within the range1&lt;z&lt;3. at z&gt;3, there is tentative evidence for a factor of two decrease instellar mass. this suggests that radio galaxies have assembled the bulk oftheir stellar mass by z~3, but confirmation by more detailed decomposition ofstellar and agn emission is needed.  the restframe 500 mhz radio luminosities are only marginally correlated withstellar mass but are strongly correlated with the restframe 5um hot dustluminosity. this suggests that the radio galaxies have a large range ofeddington ratios. we also present new very large array 4.86 and 8.46 ghzimaging of 14 radio galaxies and find that radio core dominance --- anindicator of jet orientation --- is strongly correlated with hot dustluminosity. while all of our targets were selected as narrow-lined, type 2agns, this result can be understood in the context of orientation-dependentmodels if there is a continuous distribution of orientations from obscured type2 to unobscured type 1 agns rather than a clear dichotomy. finally, four radiogalaxies have nearby (&lt;6") companions whose mid-ir colors are suggestive oftheir being agns. this may indicate an association between radio galaxyactivity and major mergers.

1107.2570	the star formation reference survey. i. survey description and basic  data	star formation is arguably the most important physical process in the cosmos.it is a fundamental driver of galaxy evolution and the ultimate source of mostof the energy emitted by galaxies. a correct interpretation of star formationrate (sfr) measures is therefore essential to our understanding of galaxyformation and evolution. unfortunately, however, no single sfr estimator isuniversally available or even applicable in all circumstances: the numerousgalaxies found in deep surveys are often too faint (or too distant) to yieldsignificant detections with most standard sfr measures, and until now therehave been no global, multi-band observations of nearby galaxies that span allthe conditions under which star-formation is taking place. to address this needin a systematic way, we have undertaken a multi-band survey of all types ofstar-forming galaxies in the local universe. this project, the star formationreference survey (sfrs), is based on a statistically valid sample of 369 nearbygalaxies that span all existing combinations of dust temperature, sfr, andspecific sfr. furthermore, because the sfrs is blind with respect to agnfraction and environment it serves as a means to assess the influence of thesefactors on sfr. our panchromatic global flux measurements (including galexfuv+nuv, sdss ugriz, 2mass jhks, spitzer 3-8{\mu}m, and others) furnish uniformsfr measures and the context in which their reliability can be assessed. thispaper describes the sfrs survey strategy, defines the sample, and presents themulti-band photometry collected to date.

1207.2727	the ages, masses and star-formation rates of spectroscopically confirmed  z~6 galaxies in candels	we report the results of a study exploring the stellar populations of 13luminous (l&gt;l*), spectroscopically confirmed, galaxies in the redshift interval5.5&lt;z&lt;6.5, all with wfc3/ir and irac imaging from the hst/candels andspitzer/seds surveys. based on fitting the observed photometry with sedtemplates covering a wide range of different star-formation histories, and aself consistent treatment of lyman-alpha emission, we find that the derivedstellar masses lie within the range 10^9 msun &lt; m*&lt; 10^10 msun and are robustto within a factor of two. in contrast, we confirm previous reports that theages of the stellar populations are poorly constrained. although thebest-fitting models for three objects have ages &gt;= 300 myr, the degeneraciesintroduced by dust extinction mean that only two of these objects actuallyrequire a &gt;300 myr old stellar population to reproduce the observed photometry.moreover, when considering only smoothly-varying star-formation histories, weobserve a clear tension between the data and models such that a galaxy sedtemplate with an old age is often chosen in order to try and fit objects withblue uv-slopes but red uv-to-optical colours. to break this tension we exploresed fitting with two-component models (burst plus on-going star-formation) andallow for nebular emission. on average, the inclusion of nebular emission leadsto lower stellar-mass estimates (median offset 0.18 dex), moderately higherspecific star-formation rates, and allows for a wider range of plausiblestellar ages. however, based on our sed modelling, we find no strong evidencefor extremely young ages in our sample (&lt;50 myr). finally, considering all ofthe different star-formation histories explored, we find that the medianbest-fitting ages are of the order 200-300 myr and that the objects with thetightest constraints indicate ages in the range 50-200 myr (abridged).

0704.3609	the local galaxy 8 micron luminosity function	a sst survey in the noao deep-wide field in bo\"otes provides a complete,8-micron-selected sample of galaxies to a limiting (vega) magnitude of 13.5. inthe 6.88 deg$^2$ field sampled, 79% of the 4867 galaxies have spectroscopicredshifts, allowing an accurate determination of the local (z&lt;0.3) galaxyluminosity function. stellar and dust emission can be separated on the basis ofobserved galaxy colors. dust emission (mostly pah) accounts for 80% of the 8micron luminosity, stellar photospheres account for 19%, and agn emissionaccounts for roughly 1 %. a sub-sample of the 8 micron-selected galaxies haveblue, early-type colors, but even most of these have significant pah emission.the luminosity functions for the total 8 micron luminosity and for the dustemission alone are both well fit by schechter functions. for the 8 micronluminosity function, the characteristic luminosity is \nu l_{\nu}^*(8.0\micron) = 1.8 \times 10^{10}$ \lsun while for the dust emission alone it is1.6 x 10^{10}$ \lsun\null. the average 8 \micron luminosity density at z&lt;0.3 is3.1 x 10^7 \lsun mpc^{-3}, and the average luminosity density from dust aloneis 2.5 x 10^7 \lsun mpc^{-3}. this luminos ity arises predominantly fromgalaxies with 8 \micron luminosities ($\nu l_{\nu}$) between $2\times 10^9$ and$2 x 10^{10}$ \lsun, i.e., normal galaxies, not lirgs or ulirgs.

1208.1612	contribution of the accretion disk, hot corona, and obscuring torus to  the luminosity of seyfert galaxies: integral and spitzer observations	we estimate the relative contributions of the supermassive black hole (smbh)accretion disk, corona, and obscuring torus to the bolometric luminosity ofseyfert galaxies, using spizter mid-infrared (mir) observations of a completesample of 68 nearby active galactic nuclei from the integral all-sky hard x-ray(hx) survey. this is the first hx-selected (above 15 kev) sample of agns withcomplementary high angular resolution, high signal to noise, mir data.correcting for the host galaxy contribution, we find a correlation between hxand mir luminosities: l_mir l_hx^(0.74+/-0.06). assuming that the observed miremission is radiation from an accretion disk reprocessed in a surrounding dustytorus that subtends a solid angle decreasing with increasing luminosity (asinferred from the declining fraction of obscured agns), the intrinsic diskluminosity, l_d, is approximately proportional to the luminosity of the coronain the 2-300 kev energy band, l_c, with the l_d/l_c ratio varying by a factorof 2.1 around a mean value of 1.6. this ratio is a factor of ~2 smaller thanfor typical quasars producing the cosmic x-ray background (cxb). therefore,over three orders of magnitude in luminosity, hx radiation carries a large, androughly comparable, fraction of the bolometric output of agns. we estimate thecumulative bolometric luminosity density of local agns at ~(1-3)x10^40erg/s/mpc^3. finally, the compton temperature ranges between kt_c~2 and ~6 kevfor nearby agns, compared to kt_c~2 kev for typical quasars, confirming thatradiative heating of interstellar gas can play an important role in regulatingsmbh growth.

1304.4227	discovery of lyman break galaxies at z~7 from the zfourge survey	star-forming galaxies at redshifts z&gt;6 are likely responsible for thereionization of the universe, and it is important to study the nature of thesegalaxies. we present three candidates for z~7 lyman-break galaxies (lbgs) froma 155 arcmin^2 area in the candels/cosmos field imaged by the deep fourstargalaxy evolution (zfourge) survey. the fourstar medium-band filters provide theequivalent of r~10 spectroscopy, which cleanly distinguishes between z~7 lbgsand brown dwarf stars. the distinction between stars and galaxies based on anobject's angular size can become unreliable even when using hst imaging; thereexists at least one very compact z~7 candidate (fwhm~0.5-1 kpc) that isindistinguishable from a point source. the medium-band filters provide narrowerredshift distributions compared with broad-band-derived redshifts. the uvluminosity function derived using the three z~7 candidates is consistent withprevious studies, suggesting an evolution at the bright end (muv -21.6 mag)from z~7 to z~5. fitting the galaxies' spectral energy distributions, wepredict lyman-alpha equivalent widths for the two brightest lbgs, and find thatthe presence of a lyman-alpha line affects the medium-band flux therebychanging the constraints on stellar masses and uv spectral slopes. thisillustrates the limitations of deriving lbg properties using only broad-bandphotometry. the derived specific star-formation rates for the bright lbgs are~13 per gyr, slightly higher than the lower-luminosity lbgs, implying that thestar-formation rate increases with stellar mass for these galaxies.

1306.0850	revealing the heavily obscured agn population of high redshift 3crr  sources with chandra x-ray observations	chandra observations of a complete, flux-limited sample of 38 high-redshift(1&lt;z&lt;2), low-frequency selected (and so unbiased in orientation) 3crr radiosources are reported. the sample includes 21 quasars (= broad line radiogalaxies) and 17 narrow line radio galaxies (nlrgs) with matched 178 mhz radioluminosity (log l_r ~ 44-45). the quasars have high radio core-fraction, highx-ray luminosities (log l_x ~ 45-46) and soft x-ray hardness ratios (hr ~ -0.5)indicating low obscuration. the nlrgs have lower core-fraction, lower apparentx-ray luminosities (log l_x ~ 43-45) and mostly hard x-ray hardness ratios(hr&gt;0) indicating obscuration (log n_h ~ 22-24 cm^-2). these properties and thecorrelation between obscuration and radio core-fraction are consistent withorientation-dependent obscuration as in unification models. about half thenlrgs have soft x-ray hardness ratios and/or high [oiii] emission line to x-rayluminosity ratio suggesting obscuration by compton thick (ct) material so thatscattered nuclear or extended x-ray emission dominates (as in ngc1068). theratios of unobscured to compton-thin (10^{22}&lt; n_h(int) &lt; 1.5 x 10^{24} cm^-2)to ct (n_h(int) &gt; 1.5 x 10^{24} cm^-2) is 2.5:1.4:1 in this high luminosity,radio-selected sample. the obscured fraction is 0.5, higher than is typicallyreported for agn at comparable luminosities from multi-wavelength surveys(0.1-0.3). assuming random nuclear orientation, the unobscured half-openingangle of the disk/wind/torus structure is ~ 60deg and the obscuring materialcovers 30deg of which ~ 12deg is compton thick. the multi-wavelength propertiesreveal that many nlrgs have intrinsic absorption 10-1000x higher than indicatedby their x-ray hardness ratios, and their true l_x values are ~10--100x largerthan the hardness-ratio absorption corrections would indicate.

1306.3572	an intensely star-forming galaxy at z~7 with low dust and metal content  revealed by deep alma and hst observations	we report deep alma observations complemented with associated hst imaging fora luminous (m_uv=25) galaxy, `himiko', at a redshift z=6.595. the galaxy isremarkable for its high star formation rate, 100 mo/yr, securely estimated fromour deep hst and spitzer photometry, and the absence of any evidence for strongagn activity or gravitational lensing magnification. our alma observationsprobe an order of magnitude deeper than previous iram observations, yet fail todetect a 1.2mm dust continuum, indicating a flux &lt;52ujy comparable with orweaker than that of local dwarf irregulars with much lower star formationrates. we likewise provide a strong upper limit for the flux of [cii] 158um,l([cii]) &lt; 5.4x10^7 lo, a diagnostic of the hot interstellar gas oftendescribed as a valuable probe for early galaxies. in fact, our observationsindicate himiko lies off the local l([cii]) - star formation rate scalingrelation by a factor of more than 30. both aspects of our alma observationssuggest himiko is an unique object with a very low dust content and perhapsnearly primordial interstellar gas. our hst images provide unique insight intothe morphology of this remarkable source, highlighting an extremely blue coreof activity and two less extreme associated clumps. himiko is undergoing atriple major merger event whose extensive ionized nebula of lyman alphaemitting gas, discovered in our earlier work with subaru, is powered by starformation and the dense circum-galactic gas. we are likely witnessing an earlymassive galaxy during a key period of its mass assembly close to the end of thereionization era.

0801.2160	the role of agn in the colour transformation of galaxies at redshifts  z~1	we explore the role of agn in establishing and/or maintaining the bimodalcolour distribution of galaxies by quenching their star-formation and hence,causing their transition from the blue to the red cloud. important tests forthis scenario include (i) the x-ray properties of galaxies in the transitionzone between the two clouds and (ii) the incidence of agn in post-starbursts,i.e. systems observed shortly after (&lt;1gyr) the termination of theirstar-formation. we perform these tests by combining deep chandra observationswith multiwavelength data from the aegis survey. stacking the x-ray photons atthe positions of galaxies (0.4&lt;z&lt;0.9) not individually detected at x-raywavelengths suggests a population of obscured agn among sources in thetransition zone and in the red cloud. their mean x-ray and mid-ir propertiesare consistent with moderately obscured low-luminosity agn, compton thicksources or a mix of both. morphologies show that major mergers are unlikely todrive the evolution of this population but minor interactions may play a role.the incidence of obscured agn in the red cloud (both direct detections andstacking results) suggests that bh accretion outlives the termination of thestar-formation. this is also supported by our finding that post-starburstgalaxies at z~0.8 and agn are associated, in agreement with recent results atlow-z. a large fraction of post-starbursts and red cloud galaxies show evidencefor at least moderate levels of agn obscuration. this implies that if agnoutflows cause the colour transformation of galaxies, then some nuclear gas anddust clouds either remain unaffected or relax to the central galaxy regionsafter the quenching their star-formation.

1309.2280	the most luminous z~9-10 galaxy candidates yet found: the luminosity  function, cosmic star-formation rate, and the first mass density estimate at  500 myr	[abridged] we present the discovery of four surprisingly bright (h_160 ~ 26 -27 mag ab) galaxy candidates at z~9-10 in the complete hst candels wfc3/irgoods-n imaging data, doubling the number of z~10 galaxy candidates that areknown, just ~500 myr after the big bang. two similarly bright sources are alsodetected in a systematic re-analysis of the goods-s data set. three of the fourgalaxies in goods-n are significantly detected at 4.5-6.2sigma in the very deepspitzer/irac 4.5 micron data, as is one of the goods-s candidates. furthermore,the brightest of our candidates (at z=10.2+-0.4) is robustly detected also at3.6 micron (6.9sigma), revealing a flat uv spectral energy distribution with aslope beta=-2.0+-0.2, consistent with demonstrated trends with luminosity athigh redshift. the abundance of such luminous candidates suggests that theluminosity function evolves more significantly in phi_* than in l_* at z&gt;~8with a higher number density of bright sources than previously expected.despite the discovery of these luminous candidates, the cosmic star formationrate density for galaxies with sfr &gt;0.7 m_sun/yr shows an order-of-magnitudeincrease in only 170 myr from z ~ 10 to z ~ 8, consistent with previousresults. based on the irac detections, we derive galaxy stellar masses at z~10,finding that these luminous objects are typically 10^9 m_sun. the cosmicstellar mass density at z~10 is log10 rho_* = 4.7^+0.5_-0.8 m_sun mpc^-3 forgalaxies brighter than m_uv~-18. the remarkable brightness, and henceluminosity, of these z~9-10 candidates highlights the opportunity for deepspectroscopy to determine their redshift and nature, demonstrates the value ofadditional search fields covering a wider area to understand star-formation inthe very early universe, and highlights the opportunities for jwst to map thebuildup of galaxies at redshifts much earlier than z~10.

0801.3782	irac photometric analysis and the mid-ir photometric properties of lyman  break galaxies	we present photometric analysis of deep mid-infrared observations obtained byspitzer/irac covering the fields q1422+2309, q2233+1341, dsf2237a,b, hdfn,ssa22a,b and b20902+34, giving the number counts and the depths for each field.in a sample of 751 lbgs lying in those fields, 443, 448, 137 and 152 areidentified at 3.6microns, 4.5microns, 5.8microns, 8.0microns irac bandsrespectively, expanding their spectral energy distribution torest-near-infrared and revealing that lbgs display a variety of colours. theirrest-near-infrared properties are rather inhomogeneous, ranging from those thatare bright in irac bands and exhibit [r]-[3.6] &gt; 1.5 colours to those that arefaint or not detected at all in irac bands with [r]-[3.6] &lt; 1.5 colours andthese two groups of lbgs are investigated. we compare the mid-ir colours of thelbgs with the colours of star-forming galaxies and we find that lbgs havecolours consistent with star-foming galaxies at z~3. the properties of the lbgsdetected in the 8microns irac band (rest frame k-band) are examined separately,showing that they exhibit redder [r]-[3.6] colours than the rest of thepopulation and that irac 8microns band can be used as a diagnostic tool, toseparate agn dominated objects from normal star-forming galaxies at z~3

1310.6031	a rapidly star-forming galaxy 700 million years after the big bang at  z=7.51	out of several dozen z &gt; 7 candidate galaxies observed spectroscopically,only five have been confirmed via lyman-alpha emission, at z=7.008, 7.045,7.109, 7.213 and 7.215. the small fraction of confirmed galaxies may indicatethat the neutral fraction in the intergalactic medium (igm) rises quickly at z&gt; 6.5, as lyman-alpha is resonantly scattered by neutral gas. however, thesmall samples and limited depth of previous observations makes theseconclusions tentative. here we report the results of a deep near-infraredspectroscopic survey of 43 z &gt; 6.5 galaxies. we detect only a single galaxy,confirming that some process is making lyman-alpha difficult to detect. thedetected emission line at 1.0343 um is likely to be lyman-alpha emission,placing this galaxy at a redshift z = 7.51, an epoch 700 million years afterthe big bang. this galaxy's colors are consistent with significant metalcontent, implying that galaxies become enriched rapidly. we measure asurprisingly high star formation rate of 330 msol/yr, more than a factor of 100greater than seen in the milky way. such a galaxy is unexpected in a survey ofour size, suggesting that the early universe may harbor more intense sites ofstar-formation than expected.

0803.0357	the mid-infrared properties of x-ray sources	we combine the results of the spitzer irac shallow survey and the chandraxbootes survey of the 8.5 square degrees bootes field of the noao deep wide-field survey to produce the largest comparison of mid-ir and x-ray sources todate. the comparison is limited to sources with x-ray fluxes &gt;8x10-15 ergcm-2s-1 in the 0.5-7.0 kev range and mid-ir sources with 3.6 um fluxes brighterthan 18.4 mag (12.3 ujy). in this most sensitive irac band, 85% of the 3086x-ray sources have mid-ir counterparts at an 80% confidence level based on abayesian matching technique. only 2.5% of the sample have no irac counterpartat all based on visual inspection. even for a smaller but a significantlydeeper chandra survey in the same field, the irac shallow survey recovers mostof the x-ray sources. a majority (65%) of the chandra sources detected in allfour irac bands occupy a well-defined region of irac [3.6] - [4.5] vs [5.8] -[8.0] color-color space. these x-ray sources are likely infrared luminous,unobscured type i agn with little mid-infrared flux contributed by the agn hostgalaxy. of the remaining chandra sources, most are lower luminosity type i andtype ii agn whose mid-ir emission is dominated by the host galaxy, whileapproximately 5% are either galactic stars or very local galaxies.

1406.2872	3c 220.3: a radio galaxy lensing a submillimeter galaxy	herschel space observatory photometry and extensive multiwavelength followuphave revealed that the powerful radio galaxy 3c 220.3 at z=0.685 acts as agravitational lens for a background submillimeter galaxy (smg) at z=2.221. atan observed wavelength of 1mm, the smg is lensed into three distinct images. inthe observed near infrared, these images are connected by an arc of 1.8" radiusforming an einstein half-ring centered near the radio galaxy. in visible light,only the arc is apparent. 3c 220.3 is the only known instance of stronggalaxy-scale lensing by a powerful radio galaxy not located in a galaxy clusterand therefore it offers the potential to probe the dark matter content of theradio galaxy host. lens modeling rejects a single lens, but two lenses centeredon the radio galaxy host a and a companion b, separated by 1.5", provide a fitconsistent with all data and reveal faint candidates for the predicted fourthand fifth images. the model does not require an extended common dark matterhalo, consistent with the absence of extended bright x-ray emission on ourchandra image. the projected dark matter fractions within the einstein radii ofa (1.02") and b (0.61") are about 0.4 +/- 0.3 and 0.55 +/- 0.3. the mass toi-band light ratios of a and b, m/l ~ 8 +/- 4 msun/lsun, appear comparable tothose of radio-quiet lensing galaxies at the same redshift in the castles, lsd,and sl2s samples. the lensed smg is extremely bright with observed f(250um) =440mjy owing to a magnification factor mu~10. the smg spectrum shows luminous,narrow civ 154.9nm emission, revealing that the smg houses a hidden quasar inaddition to a violent starburst. multicolor image reconstruction of the smgindicates a bipolar morphology of the emitted ultraviolet (uv) light suggestiveof cones through which uv light escapes a dust-enshrouded nucleus.

1406.4503	the hetdex pilot survey v: the physical origin of lyman-alpha emitters  probed by near-infrared spectroscopy	we present the results from a vlt/sinfoni and keck/nirspec near-infraredspectroscopic survey of 16 lyman-alpha emitters (laes) at $z$ = 2.1 - 2.5 inthe cosmos and goods-n fields discovered from the hetdex pilot survey. wedetect rest-frame optical nebular lines (h$\alpha$ and/or [oiii]$\lambda$5007)for 10 of the laes and measure physical properties, including the starformation rate (sfr), gas-phase metallicity, gas-mass fraction, and ly$\alpha$velocity offset. we find that laes may lie below the mass-metallicity relationfor continuum-selected star-forming galaxies at the same redshift. the laes allshow velocity shifts of ly$\alpha$ relative to the systemic redshift rangingbetween +85 and +296 km s$^{-1}$ with a mean of +180 km s$^{-1}$. this value issmaller than measured for continuum-selected star-forming galaxies at similarredshifts. the ly$\alpha$ velocity offsets show a moderate correlation with themeasured star formation rate (2.5$\sigma$), but no significant correlations areseen with the sfr surface density, specific sfr, stellar mass, or dynamicalmass ($\lesssim$ 1.5$\sigma$). exploring the role of dust, kinematics of theinterstellar medium (ism), and geometry on the escape of ly$\alpha$ photons, wefind no signature of selective quenching of resonantly scattered ly$\alpha$photons. however, we also find no evidence that a clumpy ism is enhancing thely$\alpha$ equivalent width. our results suggest that the low metallicity inlaes may be responsible for yielding an environment with a low neutral hydrogencolumn density as well as less dust, easing the escape of ly$\alpha$ photonsover that in continuum-selected star-forming galaxies.

1412.0663	high-precision photometric redshifts from spitzer/irac: extreme  [3.6]-[4.5] colors identify galaxies in the redshift range z~6.6-6.9	one of the most challenging aspects of studying galaxies in the z&gt;~7 universeis the infrequent confirmation of their redshifts through spectroscopy, aphenomenon thought to occur from the increasing opacity of the intergalacticmedium to lya photons at z&gt;6.5. the resulting redshift uncertainties inhibitthe efficient search for [c ii] in z~7 galaxies with sub-mm instruments such asalma, given their limited scan speed for faint lines. one means by which toimprove the precision of the inferred redshifts is to exploit the potentialimpact of strong nebular emission lines on the colors of z~4-8 galaxies asobserved by spitzer/irac. at z~6.8, galaxies exhibit irac colors as blue as[3.6]-[4.5] ~-1, likely due to the contribution of [o iii]+hb to the 3.6 mumflux combined with the absence of line contamination in the 4.5 mum band. inthis paper we explore the use of extremely blue [3.6]-[4.5] colors to identifygalaxies in the narrow redshift window z~6.6-6.9. when combined with ani-dropout criterion, we demonstrate that we can plausibly select a relativelyclean sample of z~6.8 galaxies. through a systematic application of thisselection technique to our catalogs from all five candels fields, we identify20 probable z~6.6-6.9 galaxies. we estimate that our criteria select the ~50%strongest line emitters at z~6.8 and from the irac colors we estimate a typical[o iii]+hb rest-frame equivalent width of 1085a for this sample. the smallredshift uncertainties on our sample make it particularly well suited forfollow-up studies with facilities such as alma.

1412.3806	zfourge/candels: on the evolution of m* galaxy progenitors from z=3 to  0.5	galaxies with stellar masses near m* contain the majority of stellar mass inthe universe, and are therefore of special interest in the study of galaxyevolution. the milky way (mw) and andromeda (m31) have present day stellarmasses near m*, at 5x10^10 msol (mw-mass) and 10^11 msol (m31-mass). we studythe typical progenitors of these galaxies using zfourge, a deep medium-bandnear-ir imaging survey, which is sensitive to the progenitors of these galaxiesout to z~3. we use abundance-matching techniques to identify the mainprogenitors of these galaxies at higher redshifts. we measure the evolution inthe stellar mass, rest-frame colors, morphologies, far-ir luminosities, andstar-formation rates combining our deep multiwavelength imaging with near-irhst imaging from candels, and far-ir imaging from goods-h and candels-h. thetypical mw-mass and m31-mass progenitors passed through the same evolutionstages, evolving from blue, star-forming disk galaxies at the earliest stages,to redder dust-obscured ir-luminous galaxies in intermediate stages, and tored, more quiescent galaxies at their latest stages. the progenitors of themw-mass galaxies reached each evolutionary stage at later times (lowerredshifts) and with stellar masses that are a factor of 2-3 lower than theprogenitors of the m31-mass galaxies. the process driving this evolution,including the suppression of star-formation in present-day m* galaxies requiresan evolving stellar-mass/halo-mass ratio and/or evolving halo-mass thresholdfor quiescent galaxies. the effective size and star-formation rates imply thatthe baryonic cold-gas fractions drop as galaxies evolve from high redshift toz~0 and are strongly anticorrelated with an increase in the s\'ersic index.therefore, the growth of galaxy bulges in m* galaxies corresponds to a rapiddecline in the galaxy gas fractions and/or a decrease in the star-formationefficiency.

1412.5180	stellar masses from the candels survey: the goods-south and uds fields	we present the public release of the stellar mass catalogs for the goods-sand uds fields obtained using some of the deepest near-ir images available,achieved as part of the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacysurvey (candels) project. we combine the effort from ten different teams, whocomputed the stellar masses using the same photometry and the same redshifts.each team adopted their preferred fitting code, assumptions, priors, andparameter grid. the combination of results using the same underlying stellarisochrones reduces the systematics associated with the fitting code and otherchoices. thanks to the availability of different estimates, we can test theeffect of some specific parameters and assumptions on the stellar massestimate. the choice of the stellar isochrone library turns out to have thelargest effect on the galaxy stellar mass estimates, resulting in the largestdistributions around the median value (with a semi interquartile range largerthan 0.1 dex). on the other hand, for most galaxies, the stellar mass estimatesare relatively insensitive to the different parameterizations of the starformation history. the inclusion of nebular emission in the model spectra doesnot have a significant impact for the majority of galaxies (less than a factorof 2 for ~80% of the sample). nevertheless, the stellar mass for the subsampleof young galaxies (age &lt; 100 myr), especially in particular redshift ranges(e.g., 2.2 &lt; z &lt; 2.4, 3.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.6, and 5.5 &lt; z &lt; 6.5), can be seriouslyoverestimated (by up to a factor of 10 for &lt; 20 myr sources) if nebularcontribution is ignored.

1504.00005	an increasing stellar baryon fraction in bright galaxies at high  redshift	recent observations have shown that the characteristic luminosity of therest-frame ultraviolet (uv) luminosity function does not significantly evolveat 4 &lt; z &lt; 7 and is approximately m*_uv ~ -21. we investigate this apparentnon-evolution by examining a sample of 178 bright, m_uv &lt; -21 galaxies at z=4to 7, analyzing their stellar populations and host halo masses. including deepspitzer/irac imaging to constrain the rest-frame optical light, we find thatm*_uv galaxies at z=4-7 have similar stellar masses of log(m/msol)=9.6-9.9 andare thus relatively massive for these high redshifts. however, bright galaxiesat z=4-7 are less massive and have younger inferred ages than similarly brightgalaxies at z=2-3, even though the two populations have similar star formationrates and levels of dust attenuation. we match the abundances of these brightz=4-7 galaxies to halo mass functions from the bolshoi lambda-cdm simulation toestimate the halo masses. we find that the typical halo masses in ~m*_uvgalaxies decrease from log(m_h/msol)=11.9 at z=4 to log(m_h/msol)=11.4 at z=7.thus, although we are studying galaxies at a similar mass across multipleredshifts, these galaxies live in lower mass halos at higher redshift. thestellar baryon fraction in units of the cosmic mean omega_b/omega_m rises from5.1% at z=4 to 11.7% at z=7; this evolution is significant at the ~3-sigmalevel. this rise does not agree with simple expectations of how galaxies grow,and implies that some effect, perhaps a diminishing efficiency of feedback, isallowing a higher fraction of available baryons to be converted into stars athigh redshifts.

1506.01323	s-candels: the spitzer-cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic  survey. survey design, photometry, and deep irac source counts	the spitzer-cosmic assembly deep near-infrared extragalactic legacy survey(s-candels; pi g. fazio) is a cycle 8 exploration program designed to detectgalaxies at very high redshifts (z &gt; 5). to mitigate the effects of cosmicvariance and also to take advantage of deep coextensive coverage in multiplebands by the hubble space telescope multi-cycle treasury program candels,s-candels was carried out within five widely separated extragalactic fields:the ukidss ultra-deep survey, the extended chandra deep field south, cosmos,the hst deep field north, and the extended groth strip. s-candels builds uponthe existing coverage of these fields from the spitzer extended deep survey(seds) by increasing the integration time from 12 hours to a total of 50 hoursbut within a smaller area, 0.16 square degrees. the additional depthsignificantly increases the survey completeness at faint magnitudes. this paperdescribes the s-candels survey design, processing, and publicly-available dataproducts. we present irac dual-band 3.6+4.5 micron catalogs reaching to a depthof 26.5 ab mag. deep irac counts for the roughly 135,000 galaxies detected bys-candels are consistent with models based on known galaxy populations. theincrease in depth beyond earlier spitzer/irac surveys does not reveal asignificant additional contribution from discrete sources to the diffuse cosmicinfrared background (cib). thus it remains true that only roughly half of theestimated cib flux from cobe/dirbe is resolved.

0805.2143	mid-infrared spectra of high redshift (z&gt;2) radio galaxies	we present the first mid-infrared spitzer/infrared spectrograph (irs)observations of powerful radio galaxies at z&gt;2. these radio galaxies, 4c +23.56(z=2.48) and 6c j1908+7220 (z=3.53), both show strong mid-infrared continua,but with 6c j1908+7220 also showing strong pah emission at rest-frame 6.2 and7.7um. in 4c+23.56 we see no obvious pah features above the continuum. the pahemission in 6c j1908+7220 is the amongst the most distant observed to date andimplies that there is a large instantaneous star formation rate (sfr). this isconsistent with the strong detection of 6c j1908+7220 at far-ir and sub-mmwavelengths, indicative of large amounts of cold dust, ~10^9msun. powerfulradio galaxies at lower redshifts tend to have weak or undetectable pahfeatures and typically have lower far-ir luminosities. in addition, 4c 23.56shows moderate silicate absorption as seen in less luminous radio galaxies,indicating tau_{9.7um}=0.3+/-0.05. this feature is shifted out of the observedwavelength range for 6c j1908+7220. the correlation of strong pah features withlarge amounts of cold dust, despite the presence of a powerful agn, is inagreement with other recent results and implies that star formation at highredshift is, in some cases at least, associated with powerful, obscured agn.

1509.05781	mid-infrared spectroscopy of the andromeda galaxy	we present spitzer/infrared spectrograph (irs) 5-21 micron spectroscopic mapstowards 12 regions in the andromeda galaxy (m31). these regions include thenucleus, bulge, an active region in the star-forming ring, and 9 other regionschosen to cover a range of mid-to-far-infrared colours. in line with previousresults, pah feature ratios (6.2 micron and 7.7 micron features compared to the11.2 micron feature) measured from our extracted m31 spectra, except thenucleus, strongly correlate. the equivalent widths of the main pah features, asa function of metallicity and radiation hardness, are consistent with thoseobserved for other nearby spiral and starburst galaxies. reprocessed data fromthe isocam instrument on the infrared space observatory agree with the irsdata; early reports of suppressed 6-8 micron features and enhanced 11.3 micronfeature intensity and fwhm apparently resulted from background-subtractionproblems. the nucleus does not show any pah emission but does show strongsilicate emission at 9.7 micron. furthermore, different spectral features (11.3micron pah emission, silicate emission and [neiii] 15.5 micron line emission)have distinct spatial distributions in the nuclear region: the silicateemission is strongest towards the stellar nucleus, while the pah emission peaks15 arcsec north of the nucleus. the pah feature ratios at this position areatypical with strong emission at 11.2 microns and 15-20 microns but weakemission at 6--8 microns. the nucleus itself is dominated by stellar lightgiving rise to a strong blue continuum and silicate emission.

1512.02656	infrared color selection of massive galaxies at z &gt; 3	we introduce a new color-selection technique to identify high-redshift,massive galaxies that are systematically missed by lyman-break selection. thenew selection is based on the h_{160} and irac 4.5um bands, specifically h -[4.5] &gt; 2.25 mag. these galaxies, dubbed "hieros", include two majorpopulations that can be separated with an additional j - h color. thepopulations are massive and dusty star-forming galaxies at z &gt; 3 (jh-blue) andextremely dusty galaxies at z &lt; 3 (jh-red). the 350 arcmin^2 of the goods-n andgoods-s fields with the deepest hst/wfc3 and irac data contain 285 hieros downto [4.5] &lt; 24 mag. we focus here primarily on jh-blue (z &gt; 3) hieros, whichhave a median photometric redshift z ~4.4 and stellar massm_{*}~10^{10.6} msun,and are much fainter in the rest-frame uv than similarly massive lyman-breakgalaxies (lbgs). their star formation rates (sfrs) reaches ~240 msun yr^{-1}leading to a specific sfr, ssfr ~4.2 gyr^{-1}, suggesting that the ssfrs formassive galaxies continue to grow at z &gt; 2 but at a lower growth rate than fromz=0 to z=2. with a median half-light radius of 2 kpc, including ~20% as compactas quiescent galaxies at similar redshifts, jh-blue hieros represent perfectstar-forming progenitors of the most massive (m_{*} &gt; 10^{11.2} msun) compactquiescent galaxies at z ~ 3 and have the right number density. hieros make up~60% of all galaxies with m_{*} &gt; 10^{10.5} msun identified at z &gt; 3 from theirphotometric redshifts. this is five times more than lbgs with nearly no overlapbetween the two populations. while hieros make up 15-25% of the total sfrdensity at z ~ 4-5, they completely dominate the sfr density taking place inm_{*} &gt;10^{10.5} msun galaxies, and are therefore crucial to understanding thevery early phase of massive galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0008280	infrared l band observations of the trapezium cluster: a census of  circumstellar disks and candidate protostars	we report the results of a sensitive near-infrared jhkl imaging survey of thetrapezium cluster in orion. we use the jhkl colors to obtain a census ofinfrared excess stars in the cluster. of (391) stars brighter than 12thmagnitude in the k and l bands, 80 +/- 7% are found to exhibit detectableinfrared excess on the j-h, k-l color-color diagram. examination of a subsampleof 285 of these stars with published spectral types yields a slightly higherinfrared excess fraction of 85%. we find that 97% of the optical proplyds inthe cluster exhibit excess in the jhkl color-color diagram indicating that themost likely origin of the observed infrared excesses is from circumstellardisks. we interpret these results to indicate that the fraction of stars in thecluster with circumstellar disks is between 80-85%. moreover, we find that theprobability of finding an infrared excess/protoplanetary disk around a star isindependent of stellar mass over essentially the entire range of the stellarmass function down to the hydrogen burning limit. we identify 78 stars in oursample characterized by k-l colors suggestive of deeply embedded protostellarobjects. if even a modest fraction fraction (i.e., ~ 50%) of these objects areprotostars, then star formation could be continuing in the molecular ridge at arate comparable to that which produced the foreground trapezium cluster.

0808.2188	interferometric imaging of the high-redshift radio galaxy, 4c60.07: an  sma, spitzer and vla study reveals a binary agn/starburst	high-resolution submm imaging of the hzrg, 4c60.07, at z=3.8, has revealedtwo dusty components. spitzer imaging shows that one of these components (b) iscoincident with an extremely red agn, offset by ~4" (~30 kpc) from the hzrgcore. the other submm component (a) - resolved by our beam and devoid ofemission at 3.6-8.0um - lies between b and the hzrg core. since the hzrg wasdiscovered via its young, steep-spectrum lobes and their creation was likelytriggered by the interaction, we argue that we are witnessing an early-stagemerger, prior to its eventual equilibrium state. the interaction is between thehost galaxy of an actively-fueled bh, and a gas-rich starburst/agn (b) markedby the compact submm component and coincident with broad co emission. `a' is aplume of cold, dusty gas, associated with a narrow (~150 km/s) co feature, andmay represent a short-lived tidal structure. it has been claimed that hzrgs andsmgs differ only in the activity of their agns, but such complex submmmorphologies are seen only rarely amongst smgs. our study has importantimplications: where a galaxy's gas is not aligned with its central bh, co maybe an unreliable probe of dynamical mass, affecting work on the co-assembly ofbhs and spheroids. our data support the picture wherein close binary agn areinduced by mergers. they also raise the possibility that some supposedlyjet-induced starbursts may have formed co-evally with (yet independently of)the radio jets, both triggered by the same interaction. we note that the hzrghost would have gone unnoticed without its jets/companion, so there may be manyother unseen bhs at high redshift, lost in the sea of ~5 x 10^8 similarlybright irac sources - sufficiently massive to drive a &gt;10^27-w radio source,yet practically invisible unless actively fueled (abridged).

astro-ph;0410523	mid-infrared selection of active galaxies	mid-infrared photometry provides a robust technique for identifying activegalaxies. while the ultraviolet to mid-infrared continuum of normal galaxies isdominated by the composite stellar black body curve and peaks at approximately1.6 microns, the ultraviolet to mid-infrared continuum of active galaxies isdominated by a power law. consequently, with sufficient wavelength baseline,one can easily distinguish agn from stellar populations. mirroring the tendencyof agn to be bluer than galaxies in the ultraviolet, where galaxies (and stars)sample the blue, rising portion of stellar spectra, agn tend to be redder thangalaxies in the mid-infrared, where galaxies sample the red, falling portion ofthe stellar spectra. we report on spitzer space telescope mid-infrared colors,derived from the irac shallow survey, of nearly 10,000 spectroscopicallyidentified sources from the agn and galaxy evolution survey. based on thisspectroscopic sample, we find that simple mid-infrared color criteria provideremarkably robust separation of active galaxies from normal galaxies andgalactic stars, with over 80% completeness and less than 20% contamination.considering only broad-lined agn, these mid-infrared color criteria identifyover 90% of spectroscopically identified quasars and seyfert 1s. applying thesecolor criteria to the full imaging data set, we discuss the implied surfacedensity of agn and find evidence for a large population of optically obscuredactive galaxies.

astro-ph;0512618	mid-infrared properties of x-ray sources in the extended groth strip	mid-infrared observations of active galactic nuclei (agn) are important forunderstanding of the physical conditions around the central accretion engines.chandra and xmm-newton x-ray observations of a 300 arcmin^2 region in theextended groth strip are used to select a sample of~150 agn. the spitzerinstruments irac and mips detect 68-80% of these sources, which show a widerange of mid-infrared properties. about 40% of the sources have red power-lawspectral energy distributions (f_nu ~ nu^alpha, alpha&lt;0) in the 3.6-8 um iracbands. in these sources the central engine dominates the emission at both x-rayand ir wavelengths. another 40% of the sources have blue mid-ir spectral energydistributions (alpha&gt;0) with their infrared emission dominated by the hostgalaxy; the remaining 20% are not well-fit by a power law. published irac colorcriteria for agn select most of the red sources, but only some of the bluesources. as with all other known methods, selecting agn with mid-ir colors willnot produce a sample that is simultaneously complete and reliable. the irac sedtype does not directly correspond to x-ray spectral type (hard/soft). themid-ir properties of x-ray-detected lyman-break, radio, submillimeter, andoptically-faint sources vary widely and, for the most part, are not distinctfrom those of the general x-ray/infrared source population. x-ray sources emit6-11% of the integrated mid--ir light, making them significant contributors tothe cosmic infrared background.

astro-ph;0601116	m33's variable a -- a hypergiant star more than 35 years in eruption	variable a in m33 is a member of a rare class of highly luminous, evolvedstars near the upper luminosity boundary that show sudden and dramatic shiftsin apparent temperature due to the formation of optically thick winds in highmass loss episodes. recent optical and infrared spectroscopy and imaging revealthat its ``eruption'' begun in $\sim$1950 has ended, {\it lasting $\approx$ 45yrs}. our current observations show major changes in its wind from a cool,dense envelope to a much warmer state surrounded by low density gas with rareemission lines of ca ii, [ca ii] and k i. its spectral energy distribution hasunexpectedly changed, especially at the long wavelengths, with a significantdecrease in its apparent flux, while the star remains optically obscured. weconclude that much of its radiation is now escaping out of our line of sight.we attribute this to the changing structure and distribution of itscircumstellar ejecta corresponding to the altered state of its wind as the starrecovers from a high mass loss event.

astro-ph;0602198	the agn contribution to the mid-ir emission of luminous infrared  galaxies	we determine the contribution of agn to the mid-ir emission of luminousinfrared galaxies (lirgs) at z&gt;0.6 by measuring the mid-ir dust continuum slopeof 20,039 mid-ir sources. the 24 micron sources are selected from aspitzer/mips survey of the noao deep wide-field survey bo\"otes field and havecorresponding 8 micron data from the irac shallow survey. there is a clearbimodal distribution in the 24 micron to 8 micron flux ratio. the x-raydetected sources fall within the peak corresponding to a flat spectrum innufnu, implying that it is populated by agn-dominated lirgs, whereas the peakcorresponding to a higher 24 micron to 8 micron flux ratio is likely due tolirgs whose infrared emission is powered by starbursts. the 24 micron emissionis increasingly dominated by agn at higher 24 micron flux densities (f_24): theagn fraction of the z&gt;0.6 sources increases from ~9% at f_24 ~ 0.35 mjy to74+/-20% at f_24 ~ 3 mjy in good agreement with model predictions. deep 24micron, small area surveys, like goods, will be strongly dominated by starburstgalaxies. agn are responsible for ~ 3-7% of the total 24 micron background.

astro-ph;0608378	aegis: galaxy spectral energy distributions from the x-ray to radio	the all-wavelength extended groth strip international survey (aegis) teampresents broad-band spectral energy distributions (seds), from x-ray to radiowavelengths, for 71 galaxies spanning the redshift range 0.55-1.16 (&lt;z&gt;~0.7).galaxies with secure redshifts were selected from a small (22 arcminute-square)sub-section of the keck/deimos galaxy redshift survey in the extended grothstrip field that has also been targeted for deep panchromatic imaging bychandra (x-ray), galex (ultraviolet), canada-france-hawaii telescope (optical),hubble space telescope (optical/near infrared), palomar observatory (nearinfrared), spitzer (mid/far infrared), and the very large array (radio.) theabsolute magnitude of the typical galaxy in our sample is m_b=-19.82. theultraviolet to mid-infrared portion of their spectral energy distributions(seds) are found to be bracketed by two stellar-only model seds: an early burstfollowed by passive evolution and a constant star-formation rate since earlytimes; this suggests that few of these galaxies are undergoing majorstarbursts. approximately half the galaxies show a mid- to far-infrared excessrelative to the model seds, consistent with thermal emission from interstellardust. two objects have power-law seds, indicating that they are dominated byactive galactic nuclei; both are detected in x-rays. the galaxies are groupedby rest-frame color,quantitative optical morphology, and [oii] emission linestrength (possible indicator of star formation). on average, the panchromaticseds of the galaxies, from the ultraviolet to the infrared, follow expectedtrends: redder seds are associated with red u-b, early-type morphology, and low[oii] emission, and vice versa for blue seds.

astro-ph;0610543	an almost head-on collision as the origin of two off-centre rings in the  andromeda galaxy	the unusual morphology of the andromeda spiral (messier 31, the closestspiral galaxy to the milky way) has long been an enigma. although regarded fordecades as showing little evidence of a violent history, m~31 has a well-knownouter ring of star formation at a radius of 10 kpc whose center is offset fromthe galaxy nucleus. in addition, the outer galaxy disk is warped as seen atboth optical and radio wavelengths. the halo contains numerous loops andripples. here we report the discovery, based on analysis of previously-obtaineddata, of a second, inner dust ring with projected dimensions 1.5 by 1 kpc andoffset by ~0.5kpc from the center of the galaxy. the two rings appear to bedensity waves propagating in the disk. numerical simulations offer a completelynew interpretation for the morphology of m31: both rings result from acompanion galaxy plunging head-on through the center of the disk of m31. themost likely interloper is m32. head-on collisions between galaxies are rare,but it appears nonetheless that one took place 210 million years ago in ourlocal group of galaxies.

astro-ph;0611346	spitzer/irac characterization of galactic agb stars	the spitzer space telescope and in particular its infrared array camera(irac) is an ideal facility to study the distribution of agb stars in our ownand other galaxies because of its efficiency in surveying vast areas of the skyand its ability to detect sources with infrared excess. the irac colors of agbstars, however, are not well known because cool stars have numerous molecularabsorption features in the spectral region covered by the irac photometricsystem. the presence and strength of these features depends on the chemistry ofthe stellar atmosphere and the mass loss rate and can change with time due tothe star's variability. to characterize the irac colors of agb stars, we arecarrying out a spitzer guaranteed time observation program to observe a sampleof agb stars with irac. the results will be made available to the community inthe form of template magnitudes and colors for each target with the goal ofaiding the identification of agb stars in already available and future iracsurveys. we present here the first results of this project.
