0905.1265	a systematic study of variability in a sample of ultraluminous x-ray  sources	we present results from a study of short term variability in 19 archivalobservations by xmm-newton of 16 ultraluminous x-ray sources (ulxs). eightobservations (six sources) showed intrinsic variability with power spectra inthe form of either a power law or broken power law-like continuum and in somecases quasi-periodic oscillations (qpos). the remaining observations were usedto place upper limits on the strength of possible variability hidden within.seven observations (seven sources) yielded upper limits comparable to, orhigher than, the values measured from those observations with detectablevariations. these represented the seven faintest sources all with f_x &lt;3x10^-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1. in contrast there are four observations (threesources) that gave upper limits significantly lower than both the valuesmeasured from the ulx observations with detectable variations, and the valuesexpected by comparison with luminous galactic black hole x-ray binaries (bhbs)and active galactic nuclei (agn) in the observed frequency bandpass (10^-3 - 1hz). this is the case irrespective of whether one assumes characteristicfrequencies appropriate for a stellar mass (10 m_sun) or an intermediate mass(1000 m_sun) black hole, and means that in some ulxs the variability issignificantly suppressed compared to bright bhbs and agn. we discuss ways toaccount for this unusual suppression in terms of both observational andintrinsic effects and whether these solutions are supported by our results.

0905.2891	an intermediate black hole spin in the nls1 galaxy swift j2127.4+5654:  chaotic accretion or spin energy extraction?	we have observed the hard x-ray selected narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy swiftj2127.4+5654 with suzaku. we report the detection of a broad relativistic ironemission line from the inner accretion disc. by assuming that the inner edge ofthe accretion disc corresponds to the innermost stable circular orbit of theblack hole spacetime, the line profile enables us to measure a black hole spina= 0.6\pm0.2. however, a non-rotating schwarzschild spacetime is excluded atjust above the 3 sigma level, while a maximally spinning kerr black hole isexcluded at the ~5 sigma level. the intermediate spin we measure may indicatethat accretion-driven black hole growth in this source proceeds throughshort-lived episodes with chaotic angular momentum alignment between the discand the hole rather than via prolonged accretion. the measured steep emissivityindex (q~5) constrains the irradiating x-ray source to be very centrallyconcentrated. light bending may help focus the primary emission towards theinnermost accretion disc, thus steepening the irradiation profile. on the otherhand, steep profiles can also be reached if magnetic extraction of the holerotational energy is at work. if this is the case, the interplay betweenaccretion (spinning up the black hole) and rotational energy extraction(spinning it down) forces the hole to reach an equilibrium spin value which,under standard assumptions, is remarkably consistent with our measurement.rotational energy extraction would then be able to simultaneously account forthe intermediate spin and steep emissivity profile we infer from our spectralanalysis without the need to invoke chaotic accretion episodes.

0910.2706	a bayesian test for periodic signals in red noise	many astrophysical sources, especially compact accreting sources, showstrong, random brightness fluctuations with broad power spectra in addition toperiodic or quasi-periodic oscillations (qpos) that have narrower spectra. therandom nature of the dominant source of variance greatly complicates theprocess of searching for possible weak periodic signals. we have addressed thisproblem using the tools of bayesian statistics; in particular using markovchain monte carlo techniques to approximate the posterior distribution of modelparameters, and posterior predictive model checking to assess model fits andsearch for periodogram outliers that may represent periodic signals. themethods developed are applied to two example datasets, both long xmm-newtonobservations of highly variable seyfert 1 galaxies: re j1034+396 and mrk 766.in both cases a bend (or break) in the power spectrum is evident. in the caseof re j1034+396 the previously reported qpo is found but with somewhat weakerstatistical significance than reported in previous analyses. the difference isdue partly to the improved continuum modelling, better treatment of nuisanceparameters, and partly to different data selection methods.

1003.5825	the linear rms-flux relation in an ultraluminous x-ray source	we report the first detection of a linear correlation between rms variabilityamplitude and flux in the ultraluminous x-ray source ngc 5408 x-1. the rms-fluxrelation has previously been observed in several galactic black hole x-raybinaries (bhbs), several active galactic nuclei (agn) and at least one neutronstar x-ray binary. this result supports the hypothesis that a linear rms-fluxrelation is common to all luminous black hole accretion and perhaps even afundamental property of accretion flows about compact objects. we also show forthe first time the cross-spectral properties of the variability of this ulx,comparing variations below and above 1 kev. the coherence and time delays arepoorly constrained but consistent with high coherence between the two bands,over most of the observable frequency range, and a significant time delay (withhard leading soft variations). the magnitude and frequency dependence of thelags are broadly consistent with those commonly observed in bhbs, but thedirection of the lag is reversed. these results indicate that ulx variabilitystudies, using long x-ray observations, hold great promise for constraining theprocesses driving ulxs behaviour, and the position of ulxs in the scheme ofblack hole accretion from bhbs to agn.

1011.6321	quasi-periodic oscillations in xte j1550-564: the rms-flux relation	we present an analysis of the short timescale variations in the properties ofthe strong (type "c") quasi-periodic oscillation observed in xte j1550-564during its 1998 outburst. in particular, the qpo shows a correlation betweenabsolute rms amplitude and mean source flux over timescales shorter than ~ 3ksec. a linear rms-flux relation has been observed to be a common property ofbroad-band noise but here we report the first detection of rms-flux dependencein a qpo. the gradient of the rms-flux relation is correlated with the qpo peakfrequency: from a strong positive correlation when the qpo peak frequency isbelow ~ 4 hz, through no correlation, to a strong negative correlation when thepeak frequency is above 6 hz. this is the first time a negative short termrms-flux relation has been observed in any component of the power spectrum.previous work on both the broad-band noise and qpos in a range of sources havesuggested the presence of a filter reducing the amplitude of qpos withincreasing frequency. we attempt to remove the possible effects of this filterand find that the previously negative rms-flux relations above ~ 5 hz becomeconstant.

1101.1802	the rapid x-ray variability of ngc 4051	we present an analysis of the high frequency x-ray variability of ngc 4051(m_bh ~ 1.7*10^6 m_sun) based on a series of xmm-newton observations taken in2009 with a total exposure of ~570 ks (epic pn). these data reveal the form ofthe power spectrum over frequencies from 10^-4 hz, below the previouslydetected power spectral break, to &gt; 10^-2 hz, above the frequency of theinnermost stable circular orbit (isco) around the black hole (nu_isco ~ 10^-3 -10^-2 hz, depending on the black hole spin parameter j). this is equivalent toprobing frequencies &gt;1 khz in a stellar mass (m_bh ~ 10 msun) black hole binarysystem. the power spectrum is a featureless power law over the region of theexpected isco frequency, suggesting no strong enhancement or change in thevariability at the fastest orbital period in the system. despite the hugeamplitude of the flux variations between the observations (peak-to-peak factorof &gt;50) the power spectrum appears to be stationary in shape, and varies inamplitude at all observed frequencies following the previously establishedlinear rms-flux relation. the rms-flux relation is offset in flux by a smalland energy-dependent amount. the simplest interpretation of the offset is interms of a very soft spectral component that is practically constant (comparedto the primary source of variability). one possible origin for this emission isa circumnuclear shock energised by a radiatively driven outflow from thecentral regions, and emitting via inverse-compton scattering of the centralengine's optical-uv continuum (as inferred from a separate analysis of theenergy spectrum). a comparison with the power spectrum of a long xmm-newtonobservation taken in 2001 gives only weak evidence for non-stationarity inpower spectral shape or amplitude.

1202.5877	the ubiquity of the rms-flux relation in black hole x-ray binaries	we have investigated the short term linear relation between the rmsvariability and the flux in 1,961 observations of 9 black hole x-ray binaries.the rms-flux relation for the 1-10 hz range is ubiquitously observed in anyobservation with good variability signal to noise (&gt; 3 % 1-10 hz fractionalrms). this concurs with results from a previous study of cygnus x-1 (gleissneret. al. 2004), and extends detection of the rms-flux relation to a wider rangeof states. we find a strong dependence of the flux intercept of the rms-fluxrelation on source state; as the source transitions from the hard state intothe hard intermediate state the intercept becomes strongly positive. we findlittle evidence for flux dependence of the broad-band noise within the psdshape, excepting a small subset of observations from one object in an anomaloussoft-state. we speculate that the ubiquitous linear rms-flux relation in thebroad band noise of this sample, representing a range of different states andobjects, indicates that its formation mechanism is an essential property of theluminous accretion flow around black holes.

1205.4255	x-ray variability of 104 active galactic nuclei. xmm-newton  power-spectrum density profiles	agn, powered by accretion onto smbhs, are thought to be scaled up versions ofgalactic black hole x-ray binaries (bh-xrbs). in the past few years evidence ofsuch correspondence include similarities in the broadband shape of the x-rayvariability power spectra, with characteristic bend times-scales scaling withmass. we have performed a uniform analysis of the power spectrum densities(psds) of 104 nearby (z&lt;0.4) agn using 209 xmm-newton/pn observations. the psdshave been estimated in three energy bands: 0.2-10, 0.2-2, and 2-10 kev. thesample comprises 61 type-1 agn, 21 type-2 agn, 15 nlsy1, and 7 bllacs. we havefitted each psd to two models: (1) a single power-law model and (2) a bendingpower-law model. among the entire sample, 72% show significant variability inat least one of the three bands tested. a high percentage of low-luminosity agndo not show any significant variability. the psd of the majority of thevariable agn was well described by a simple power-law with a mean index of 2.in 15 sources we found that the bending power law model was preferred with amean slope of 3 and a mean bend frequency of 2.e-04 hz. only kug1031+398(rej1034+396) shows evidence for quasi-periodic oscillations. the `fundamentalplane' relating variability timescale, black hole mass, and luminosity isdemonstrated using the new x-ray timing results presented here together with acompilation of the previously detected timescales from the literature. bothquantitative (i.e. scaling with bh mass) and qualitative (overall psd shapes)found in this sample of agn are in agreement with the expectations for thesmbhs and bh-xrbs being the same phenomenon scaled-up with the size of the bh.the steep psd slopes above the high frequency bend bear a closer resemblance tothose of the `soft/thermal dominated' bh-xrb states than other states.

1306.2330	the hot and energetic universe: astrophysics of feedback in local agn	understanding the astrophysics of feedback in active galactic nuclei (agn) iskey to understanding the growth and co-evolution of supermassive black holesand galaxies. agn-driven winds/outflows are potentially the most effective wayof transporting energy and momentum from the nuclear scales to the host galaxy,quenching star formation by sweeping away the gas reservoir. key questions inthis field are: 1) how do accretion disks around black holes launchwinds/outflows, and how much energy do these carry? 2) how are the energy andmetals accelerated in winds/outflows transferred and deposited into thecircumgalactic medium? x-ray observations are a unique way to address thesequestions because they probe the phase of the outflows which carries most ofthe kinetic energy. we show how a high throughput, high spectral resolutioninstrument like the x-ray integral field unit (x-ifu) on athena+ will allow usto address these questions by determining the physical parameters (ionizationstate, density, temperature, abundances, velocities, geometry, etc.) of theoutflows on a dynamical time-scale, in a broad sample of nearby bright agn. thex-ifu will also allow direct spectral imaging of the impact of these winds onthe host galaxy for local agn, forming a template for understanding agn athigher redshifts where wind shocks cannot be resolved.

0807.4806	on the evidence for narrow, relativistically shifted x-ray lines	in recent years there have been many reported detections of highly redshiftedor blueshifted narrow spectral lines (both emission or absorption) in the x-rayspectra of active galaxies, but these are all modest detections in terms oftheir statistical significance. the aim of this paper is to review the issue ofthe significance of these detections and, in particular, take account ofpublication bias. a literature search revealed 38 reported detections ofnarrow, strongly shifted (v/c &gt;= 0.05) x-ray lines in the 1.5-20 kev spectra ofseyfert galaxies and quasars. these published data show a close, linearrelationship between the estimated line strength and its uncertainty, in thesense that better observations (with smaller uncertainties) only ever show thesmallest lines. this result is consistent with many of the reported lines beingfalse detections resulting from random fluctuations, drawn from a large body ofdata and filtered by publication bias such that only the most `significant'fluctuations are ever reported. the reality of many of these features, andcertainly their prevalence in the population at large, therefore remains anopen question that is best settled though uniform analysis (and reporting) ofhigher quality observations.

astro-ph;0202297	how the x-ray spectrum of a narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy may be  reflection dominated	a model for the inner regions of accretion flows is presented where, due todisc instabilities, cold and dense material is clumped into deep sheets orrings. surrounding these density enhancements is hot, tenuous gas where coronaldissipation processes occur. we expect this situation to be most relevant whenthe accretion rate is close to eddington and the disc is radiation-pressuredominated, and so may apply to narrow-line seyfert~1 (nls1) galaxies. in thisscenario, the hard x-ray source is obscured for most observers, and so thedetected x-ray emission would be dominated by reflection off the walls of thesheets. a simple comptonization calculation shows that the large photon-indicescharacteristic of nls1s would be a natural outcome of two reprocessors closelysurrounding the hard x-ray source. we test this model by fitting the xmm-newtonspectrum of the nls1 1h 0707-495 between 0.5 and 11 kev with reflectiondominated ionized disc models. a very good fit is found with three differentreflectors each subject to the same \gamma=2.35 power-law. an ironoverabundance is still required to fit the sharp drop in the spectrum at around7 kev. we note that even a small corrugation of the accretion disc may resultin \gamma &gt; 2 and a strong reflection component in the observed spectrum.therefore, this model may also explain the strength and the variabilitycharacteristics of the mcg-6-30-15 fe k line. the idea needs to be tested withfurther broadband xmm-newton observations of nls1s.

astro-ph;0211421	x-ray continuum variability of mcg-6-30-15	this paper presents a comprehensive examination of the x-ray continuumvariability of the bright seyfert 1 galaxy mcg-6-30-15. the source clearlyshows the strong, linear correlation between rms variability amplitude and fluxfirst seen in galactic x-ray binaries. the high frequency power spectraldensity (psd) of mcg-6-30-15 is examined in detail using a monte carlo fittingprocedure and is found to be well represented by a steep power-law at highfrequencies (with a power-law index alpha ~ 2.5), breaking to a flatter slope(alpha ~ 1) below f_br ~ 0.6 - 2.0 x 10^-4 hz, consistent with the previousresults of uttley, mchardy &amp; papadakis. the slope of the power spectrum abovethe break is energy dependent, with the higher energies showing a flatter psd.at low frequencies the variations between different energy bands are highlycoherent while at high frequencies the coherence is significantly reduced. timelags are detected between energy bands, with the soft variations leading thehard. the magnitude of the lag is small (&lt;200 s for the frequencies observed)and is most likely frequency dependent. these properties are remarkably similarto the temporal properties of the galactic black hole candidate cygnus x-1. thecharacteristic timescales in these two types of source differ by ~10^5;assuming that these timescales scale linearly with black hole mass thensuggests a black hole mass ~10^6 m_sun for mcg-6-30-15. we speculate that thetiming properties of mcg-6-30-15 may be analogous to those of cyg x-1 in itshigh/soft state and discuss a simple phenomenological model, originallydeveloped to explain the timing properties of cyg x-1, that can explain many ofthe observed properties of mcg-6-30-15.

astro-ph;0301172	the high frequency power spectrum of markarian 766	an analysis is presented of the power spectrum of x-ray variability of thebright seyfert 1 galaxy mrk 766 as observed by xmm-newton. over the 0.2-10 kevenergy range the power spectral density (psd) is well-represented by apower-law with a slope of alpha_low ~ 1 at low frequencies, breaking to a slopeof alpha_hi = 2.8 (-0.4/+0.2) at a frequency f_br ~ 5 x 10^-4 hz. as has beennoted before this broken power-law psd shape is similar to that observed in thegalactic black hole candidate cygnus x-1. if it is assumed that mrk 766 shows apower spectrum similar in form to that of cyg x-1, and that the break timescalescales linearly with black hole mass, then the mass of the black hole in mrk766 is inferred to be &lt; 5 x 10^5 m_sun. this rather low mass would mean mrk 766radiates above the eddington limit. the coherence between different energybands is significantly below unity implying that variations in the differentenergy bands are rather poorly correlated. the low coherence can be explainedin the framework of standard comptonisation models if the properties of thecomptonising medium are rapidly variable or if there are several distinctemission sites.

astro-ph;0301588	the iron line in mcg-6-30-15 from xmm-newton: evidence for gravitational  light-bending?	the lack of variability of the broad iron line seen in the seyfert 1 galaxymcg-6-30-15 is studied using the epic pn data obtained from a 2001 observationof 325 ks, during which the count rate from the source varied by a factor of 5.the spectrum of 80 ks of data from when the source was bright, using the thelowest 10 ks as background, is well fitted over the 3-10 kev band with a simplepower-law of photon index gamma=2.11. the source spectrum can therefore bedecomposed into an approximately constant component, containing a strong ironemission line, and a variable power law component. assuming that the power-lawcontinuum extends down to 0.5 kev enables us to deduce the absorption acting onthe nucleus. a simple model involving galactic absorption and 2 photoelectricedges (at 0.72 and 0.86 kev) is adequate for the epic spectrum above 1 kev. itstill gives a fair representation of the spectrum at lower energies whereabsorption lines, utas etc are expected. applying the absorption model to thelow flux spectrum enables us to characterize it as reflection-dominated withiron about 3 times solar. fitting this model, with an additional power-lawcontinuum, to 32 x 10 ks spectra of the whole observation reveals that gammalies mostly between 2 and 2.3 and the normalization of the reflection-dominatedcomponent varies by up to 25 per cent. the breadth of the iron line suggeststhat most of the illumination originates from about 2 gravitational radii.gravitational light bending will be very strong there, causing the observedcontinuum to be a strong function of the source height and much of thecontinuum radiation to return to the disk. together these effects can explainthe otherwise puzzling disconnectedness of the continuum and reflectioncomponents of mcg-6-30-15.

astro-ph;0302288	a two-component ionized reflection model of mcg--6-30-15	ionized reflection has often been considered as the explanation for theunusual fe k variability observed in mcg--6-30-15. in this paper, we test thismodel using a 325 ks observation of mcg--6-30-15 by xmm-newton and bepposax.the data are fit between 2.5 and 80 kev with the constant density models ofross &amp; fabian. the best fit ionized reflection model requires the fe k line tobe split into two reprocessing events: one from the inner disc to build up thered wing, and the other from the outer accretion disc to fit the blue horn. theimplied geometry is a disc which becomes strongly warped or flared at largeradii. a good fit was obtained with a solar abundance of iron and a reflectionfraction (r) of unity for the inner reflector. the combination of the tworeflection spectra can appear to have r&gt;2 as required by the bepposax data. theinner reflector has an ionization parameter \log \xi =3.8, but the outer one isneutral with an inner radius ~70 gravitational radii (r_g), corresponding to alight crossing time of about an hour for a 10^7 msun black hole. applying thismodel to time-resolved spectra shows that the inner reflector becomes moreionized as the source brightens. this reduces the strength of the red wing athigh flux states. the x-ray source is constrained to arise from a narrowannulus at ~5 r_g, with only 6 per cent of the 2-10 kev flux due to the outerreprocessor. this amount of localized energy generation is extremely difficultto produce without resorting to other energy sources such as the black holespin. in fact, all the fe k models fit to xmm-newton spectra of mcg--6-30-15require a large increase in energy production at the inner edge of theaccretion disc.

astro-ph;0303273	x-ray fluctuation power spectral densities of seyfert 1 galaxies	by combining complementary monitoring observations spanning long, medium andshort time scales, we have constructed power spectral densities (psds) of sixseyfert~1 galaxies. these psds span $\gtrsim$4 orders of magnitude in temporalfrequency, sampling variations on time scales ranging from tens of minutes toover a year. in at least four cases, the psd shows a "break," a significantdeparture from a power law, typically on time scales of order a few days. thisis similar to the behavior of galactic x-ray binaries (xrbs), lower masscompact systems with breaks on time scales of seconds. ngc 3783 shows tentativeevidence for a doubly-broken power law, a feature that until now has only beenseen in the (much better-defined) psds of low-state xrbs. it is alsointeresting that (when one previously-observed object is added to make a smallsample of seven), an apparently significant correlation is seen between thebreak time scale $t$ and the putative black hole mass $m_{\rm bh}$, while noneis seen between break time scale and luminosity. the data are consistent withthe linear relation $ t = m_{\rm bh}/10^{6.5} \msun$; extrapolation over 6--7orders of magnitude is in reasonable agreement with xrbs. all of thisstrengthens the case for a physical similarity between seyfert~1s and xrbs.

astro-ph;0303418	a softer look at mcg--6-30-15 with xmm-newton	we present analysis and results from the reflection grating spectrometerduring the 320 ks xmm observation of the seyfert 1 galaxy mcg-6-30-15. thespectrum is marked by a sharp drop in flux at 0.7 kev which has beeninterpreted by branduardi-raymont et al. as the blue wing of a relativisticoviii emission line and by lee at al. as a dusty warm absorber. we find thatthe drop is well explained by the fei l2,3 absorption edges and obtainreasonable fits over the 0.32-1.7 kev band using a multizone, dusty warmabsorber model. some residuals remain which could be due to emission from arelativistic disc, but at a much weaker level than from any model relying onrelativistic emission lines alone. a model based on such emission lines can bemade to fit if sufficient (warm) absorption is added, although the linestrengths exceed those expected. the epic pn difference spectrum between thehighest and lowest flux states of the source indicates that this is a power-lawin the 3-10 kev band which, if extrapolated to lower energies, reveals theabsorption function acting on the intrinsic spectrum, provided that anyemission lines do not scale exactly with the continuum. we find that thisfunction matches our dusty warm absorber model well. the soft x-ray spectrum istherefore dominated by absorption structures, with the equivalent width of anyindividual emission lines in the residuals being below about 30 ev.

astro-ph;0305239	xmm-newton spectral properties of the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy iras  13224--3809	we report on the first xmm-newton observation of the highly x-ray variable,radio-quiet, narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy iras 13224-3809 obtained during theguaranteed time programme with a 64 ks exposure. the most remarkable spectralfeature is a sharp drop, by a factor ~5, in the spectrum at 8 kev. this is asimilar, but stronger, feature to that which we found in 1h0707-495.significant flattening of the hard x-ray spectrum occurs when the source fluxdecreases. the flattening of the spectrum can be modelled as an increase in thecolumn density of the absorbing material and/or its covering fraction. below ~1.5 kev the spectrum is dominated by a giant soft x-ray excess, and at around ~1.2 kev there is a significant absorption feature detected, most probably dueto ionized fe l absorption. the new x-ray spectral properties detected withxmm-newton in iras 13224-3809 support a partial covering interpretation, i.e.the presence of dense material inside the accretion-disc region partiallyobscuring the emission from the accretion disc. however, the sharpness of thefeature, if due to photoelectric absorption, is surprising and may require analternative explanation. one possibility which does fit the whole spectrum isthat it is dominated by ionized reflection rather than absorption. the unusualspectral properties detected with xmm-newton from narrow-line seyfert 1galaxies increase the known spectral complexity of active galactic nuclei andshould further stimulate a combined theoretical and observational effort toachieve a better understanding of the physics of the innermost regions of agn.

astro-ph;0307420	on characterising the variability properties of x-ray light curves from  active galaxies	we review some practical aspects of measuring the amplitude of variability in`red noise' light curves typical of those from active galactic nuclei (agn).the quantities commonly used to estimate the variability amplitude in agn lightcurves, such as the fractional rms variability amplitude, f_var, and excessvariance, sigma_xs^2, are examined. their statistical properties, relationshipto the power spectrum, and uses for investigating the nature of the variabilityprocesses are discussed. we demonstrate that sigma_xs^2 (or similarly f_var)shows large changes from one part of the light curve to the next, even when thevariability is produced by a stationary process. this limits the usefulness ofthese estimators for quantifying differences in variability amplitude betweendifferent sources or from epoch to epoch in one source. some examples of theexpected scatter in the variance are tabulated for various typical powerspectral shapes, based on monte carlo simulations. the excess variance can beuseful for comparing the variability amplitudes of light curves in differentenergy bands from the same observation. monte carlo simulations are used toderive a description of the uncertainty in the amplitude expected betweendifferent energy bands (due to measurement errors). finally, these estimatorsare used to demonstrate some variability properties of the bright seyfert 1galaxy markarian 766. the source is found to show a strong, linear correlationbetween rms amplitude and flux, and to show significant spectral variability.

astro-ph;0308312	long-term x-ray spectral variability in seyfert 1 galaxies	direct time-resolved spectral fitting has been performed on continuous rxtemonitoring of seven seyfert 1 galaxies in order to study their broadbandspectral variability and fe k alpha variability characteristics on time scalesof days to years. variability in the fe k alpha line is not detected in someobjects but is present in others, e.g., in ngc 3516, ngc 4151 and ngc 5548there are systematic decreases in line flux by factors of ~2-5 over 3-4 years.the fe k alpha line varies less strongly than the broadband continuum, but,like the continuum, exhibits stronger variability towards longer time scales.relatively less model-dependent broadband fractional variability amplitude(fvar) spectra also show weaker line variability compared to the continuumvariability. comparable systematic long-term decreases in the line andcontinuum are present in ngc 5548. overall, however, there is no evidence forcorrelated variability between the line and continuum, severely challengingmodels in which the line tracks continuum variations modified only by alight-travel time delay. local effects such as the formation of an ionized skinat the site of line emission may be relevant. the spectral fitting and fvarspectra both support spectral softening as continuum flux increases.

astro-ph;0310278	arakelian 564: an xmm-newton view	we report on two xmm-newton observations of the bright narrow-line seyfert 1galaxy ark 564 taken one year apart (2000 june and 2001 june). the 0.6-10 kevcontinuum is well described by a soft blackbody component (kt~140-150 ev) plusa steep power law (gamma~2.50-2.55). no significant spectral changes areobserved between the two observations, although the x-ray flux in the secondobservation is ~40-50 per cent lower. in both observations we detect asignificant absorption edge at a rest-frame energy of ~0.73 kev, correspondingto ovii. the presence of the absorption feature is confirmed by a simultaneouschandra grating observation in 2000 june, although the best-fitting edgethreshold is at a slightly lower energy in the chandra data, possibly becauseof a different parameterisation of the underlying x-ray continuum. we findtentative evidence for a broad iron emission line in the 2000 june observation.the results from an analysis of the power spectral density (psd) function arealso presented. the present xmm-newton data support the idea that the psd showstwo breaks, although the location of the high-frequency break requires furtherconstraints.

astro-ph;0311473	a long, hard look at mcg-6-30-15 with xmm-newton ii: detailed epic  analysis and modelling	the bright seyfert 1 galaxy mcg-6-30-15 has provided some of the bestevidence to date for the existence of supermassive black holes in activegalactic nuclei. observations with asca revealed an x-ray iron line profileshaped by strong doppler and gravitational effects. in this paper the shape ofthe iron line, its variability characteristics and the robustness of thisspectral interpretation are examined using the long xmm-newton observationtaken in 2001. a variety of spectral models, both including and excluding theeffects of strong gravity, are compared to the data in a uniform fashion. theresults strongly favour models in which the spectrum is shaped by emission froma relativistic accretion disc. it is far more difficult to explain the 3-10 kevspectrum using models dominated by absorption (either by warm or partiallycovering cold matter), emission line blends, curved continua or additionalcontinuum components. these provide a substantially worse fit to the data andfail to explain other observations (such as the simultaneous bepposaxspectrum). this reaffirms the veracity of the relativistic `disc line'interpretation. the short term variability in the shape of the energy spectrumis investigated and explained in terms of a two-component emission model. usinga combination of spectral variability analyses the spectrum is successfullydecomposed into a variable power-law component (plc) and a reflection dominatedcomponent (rdc). the former is highly variable while the latter isapproximately constant throughout the observation, leading to the well-knownspectral variability patterns.

astro-ph;0312298	izw1 observed with xmm-newton: low-energy spectral complexity, iron  lines, and hard x-ray flares	we present a 20 ks xmm-newton observation of the prototypical narrow-lineseyfert 1 galaxy izw1. the best-fit model to the data is a double blackbodyplus a dominant power-law, on which complex soft absorption (possibly a blendededge or absorption lines) and/or ovii emission are superimposed, as well asstrong fe kalpha emission. the iron feature in the high-energy spectra appearsbroad; however, on close examination of the epic pn data, there exists thepossibility that the broad emission feature can be attributed to a neutral fekalpha line in addition to a blend of he- and h-like fe kalpha lines. the lightcurve shows a strong, hard x-ray flare concentrated in the 3-12 kev band. theflare appears to induce spectral variability, showing spectral hardening to beoccuring as the flare intensifies. a detailed examination suggests that thespectral variability is most likely due to an increase in the 3-12 kev fluxrelative to the soft flux during the flare. a difference spectrum and completemodelling of the flare and non-flare spectra show intrinsic changes only in thenormalisation of the continuum components and not in their shape parameters.the timing results are consistent with the flare originating in the accretiondisc corona. the iron emission line(s) do not appear to respond to changes inthe continuum flux during the flare; the iron lines are stronger in equivalentwidth during the low-flux (non-flare) states, and weaker during the flare.

astro-ph;0401264	chandra observations of five x-ray transient galactic nuclei	we report on exploratory chandra observations of five galactic nuclei thatwere found to be x-ray bright during the rosat all-sky survey (with l_x &gt; 10^43erg s^-1) but subsequently exhibited a dramatic decline in x-ray luminosity.very little is known about the post-outburst x-ray properties of theseenigmatic sources. in all five cases chandra detects an x-ray sourcepositionally coincident with the nucleus of the host galaxy. the spectrum ofthe brightest source (ic 3599) appears consistent with a steep power-law(gamma~3.6). the other sources have too few counts to extract individual,well-determined spectra, but their x-ray spectra appear flatter (gamma~2) onaverage. the chandra fluxes are ~10^2-10^3 fainter than was observed during theoutburst (up to 12 years previously). that all post-outburst x-ray observationsshowed similarly low x-ray luminosities is consistent with these sources having`switched' to a persistent low-luminosity state. unfortunately the relativedearth of long-term monitoring and other data mean that the physical mechanismresponsible for this spectacular behaviour is still highly unconstrained.

astro-ph;0402660	an xmm-newton observation of ark 120: the x-ray spectrum of a `bare'  seyfert 1 nucleus	we report on a long (100 ks) xmm-newton observation of the bright seyfert 1galaxy arakelian 120. the source previously showed no signs of intrinsicreddening in its infrared-ultraviolet continuum and previous observations hadshown no evidence for ionized absorption in either the ultraviolet or x-raybands. the new xmm-newton rgs data place tight limits on the presence of anionized x-ray absorber and confirm that the x-ray spectrum of ark 120 isessentially unmodified by intervening matter. thus ark 120 can be considered a`bare' seyfert 1 nucleus. this observation therefore offers a clean view of thex-ray spectrum of a `normal' seyfert galaxy free from absorption effects. thespectrum shows a doppler broadened iron emission line (fwhm ~ 3*10^4 km/s) anda smooth, continuous soft excess which appears to peak at an energy ~0.5 kev.this adds weight to the claim that genuine soft excesses (i.e. those due to areal steepening of the underlying continuum below ~2 kev) are ubiquitous inseyfert 1 spectra. however, the detailed shape of the excess could not bereproduced by any of the simple models tested (power-laws, blackbodies,comptonised blackbodies, accretion disc reflection). this observation thereforedemonstrates both the need to understand the soft excess (as a significantcontributor to the luminosity of most seyfert 1s) and the inability of theexisting, simple models to explain it.

astro-ph;0405159	long-term spectral changes in the partial-covering candidate nls1 1h  0707-495	we compare two xmm-newton observations of the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy 1h0707-495 separated by two years, and discuss the results in terms of thepartial-covering phenomenon. the second longer observation once again displaysa sharp (&lt; 200 ev) spectral drop above 7 kev; however, in contrast to the firstobservation, the edge depth and energy have changed significantly. in additionto changes in the edge parameters, the high-energy spectrum appears steeper.the changes in the high-energy continuum can be adequately explained in termsof a partial-covering absorber outflowing from the central region. thelow-energy spectrum also shows significant long-term spectral variability,including: a substantial increase in the disc temperature; detection of a ~0.9kev emission feature; and the presence of warm absorption that was alsodetected during the asca mission, but not seen during the first xmm-newtonobservation. the large increase in disc temperature, and more modest rise inluminosity, can be understood if we consider the slim-disc model for 1h0707-495. in addition, the higher disc luminosity could be the driving forcebehind the outflow scenario and the re-appearance of a warm medium during thesecond xmm-newton observation.

astro-ph;0405160	x-ray reflection in the nls1 1h 0707-495	we apply a reflection-dominated model to the second xmm-newton observation ofthe narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy 1h 0707-495. as in the first xmm-newtonobservation a sharp spectral drop is detected with energy that has shifted from7 kev to 7.5 kev in two years. the drop is interpreted in terms ofrelativistically blurred ionised reflection from the accretion disc, while theenergy shift can be accounted for by changes in the ionisation state and, moreimportantly, emissivity profile on the disc. a flatter emissivity profileduring the second higher flux observation reduces gravitational redshifteffects, therefore shifting the edge to higher energy. remarkably, ionised discreflection and the associated power law continuum provide a reasonabledescription of the broadband spectrum, including the soft excess. consideringboth observations, the spectral variability in 1h 0707-495 appears to be due tothe interplay between these two spectral components. the reflection componentin the second observation is significantly less variable than the power law.changes of the emissivity profile, spectral shape and variability properties(such as the rms spectrum) within the two observations are all consistent witha recently proposed model in which relativistic effects in the very innerregions of the nucleus play a major role.

astro-ph;0405570	the soft x-ray absorption lines of the seyfert 1 galaxy mcg--6-30-15	the absorption lines in the soft x-ray spectrum of mcg--6-30-15 are studiedusing the reflection grating spectrometer data from the 2001 xmm-newton 320 ksobservation. a line search of the full time-averaged spectrum reveals 51absorption lines and one emission line. the equivalent widths of the lines aremeasured and the majority of the lines identified. we find lines produced by abroad range of charge states for several elements, including almost all thecharge states oxygen and iron, suggesting a broad range of ionizationparameters is present in the warm absorber. the equivalent widths of the linesare broadly consistent with the best fitting warm absorber models from turneret al (2003). the equivalent widths of the absorption lines allow confidencelimits on the column density of the species to be determined. for ovii a columndensity of 10^18.36-10^18.86 cm^-2 is found. this column density of ovii, whencombined with the inferred fei absorption, is sufficient to explain the drop influx at 0.7 kev as being due to absorption from the warm absorber. fitting oik-edge absorption to the spectrum reveals a column of 10^17.51-10^17.67 cm^-2of oi, suggesting an fe:o ratio of ~1:2, consistent with the neutral iron beingin the form of iron oxide dust. variability is seen in a few absorption lines,but the majority of the absorption features, including the prominent absorptionedges, stay constant throughout the observation despite variability in thecontinuum flux.

astro-ph;0410261	the exceptional x-ray variability of the dwarf seyfert nucleus ngc 4395	an analysis of the x-ray variability of the low luminosity seyfert nucleusngc 4395, based on a long xmm-newton observation, is presented. the powerspectrum shows a clear break from a flat spectrum (alpha ~ 1) to a steeperspectrum (alpha ~ 2) at a frequency f_br = 0.5 - 3.0 * 10^-3 hz, comparable tothe highest characteristic frequency found previously in a seyfert galaxy. thisextends the measured m_bh-f_br values to lower m_bh than previous studies ofseyfert galaxies, and is consistent with an inverse scaling of variabilityfrequency with black hole mass. the variations observed are among the mostviolent seen in an agn to date, with the fractional rms amplitude (f_var)exceeding 100 per cent in the softest band. the amplitude of the variationsseems intrinsically higher in ngc 4395 than most other seyferts, even afteraccounting for the differences in characteristic frequencies. the origin ofthis difference is not clear, but it is unlikely to be a high accretion rate(l/l_edd &lt; 20 per cent for ngc 4395). the variations clearly follow the linearrms-flux relation, further supporting the idea that this is a ubiquitouscharacteristics of accreting black holes. the variations are highly coherentbetween different energy bands with any frequency-dependent time delay limitedto &lt;1 per cent.

astro-ph;0412697	a simple test for periodic signals in red noise	we demonstrate a simple method for testing the significance of peaks in theperiodogram of red noise data. the procedure was designed to test for spuriousperiodicities in x-ray light curves of active galaxies, but can be used quitegenerally to test for periodic components against a background noise spectrumassumed to have a power law shape. the method provides a simple and fast testof the significance of candidate periodic signals in short, well-sampled timeseries such as those obtained from xmm-newton observations of seyfert galaxies,without the need for monte carlo simulations. a full account is made of thenumber of trials and the uncertainties inherent to the model fitting. ignoringthese subtle effects can lead to substantially overestimated significances.these difficulties motivate us to demand high standards of detection (minimum&gt;99.9 per cent confidence) for periodicities in sources that normally show rednoise spectra. the method also provides a simple means to estimate the powerspectral index, which may be an interesting parameter itself, regardless of thepresence/absence of periodicities.

astro-ph;0502112	non-linear x-ray variability in x-ray binaries and active galaxies	we show that the rms-flux relation recently discovered in the x-ray lightcurves of active galactic nuclei (agn) and x-ray binaries (xrbs) implies thatthe light curves have a formally non-linear, exponential form, provided therms-flux relation applies to variations on all time-scales (as it appears to).this phenomenological model implies that stationary data will have a lognormalflux distribution. we confirm this result using an observation of cyg x-1, andfurther demonstrate that our model predicts the existence of the powerfulmillisecond flares observed in cyg x-1 in the low/hard state, and explains thegeneral shape and amplitude of the bicoherence spectrum in that source. ourmodel predicts that the most variable light curves will show the most extremenon-linearity. this result can naturally explain the apparent non-linearvariability observed in some highly variable narrow line seyfert 1 (nls1)galaxies, as well as the low states observed on long time-scales in the nls1ngc 4051, as being nothing more than extreme manifestations of the samevariability process that is observed in xrbs and less variable agn. thatvariability process must be multiplicative (with variations coupled together onall time-scales) and cannot be additive (such as shot-noise), or related toself-organised criticality, or result from completely independent variations inmany separate emitting regions. successful models for variability mustreproduce the observed rms-flux relation and non-linear behaviour, which aremore fundamental characteristics of the variability process than the powerspectrum or spectral-timing properties. models where x-ray variability isdriven by accretion rate variations produced at different radii remain the mostpromising.

astro-ph;0506455	where are the x-ray qpos in active galaxies?	in this paper we address the question of whether existing x-ray observationsof seyfert galaxies are sufficiently sensitive to detect quasi-periodicoscillations (qpos) similar to those observed in the x-ray variations ofgalactic black holes (gbhs). we use data from xmm-newton and simulated databased on the best rxte long-term monitoring light curves, to show that if x-rayqpos are present in seyfert x-ray light curves - with similar shapes andstrengths to those observed in gbhs, but at lower frequencies commensurate withtheir larger black hole masses - they would be exceedingly difficult to detect.our results offer a simple explanation for the present lack of qpo detectionsin seyferts. we discuss the improvements in telescope size and monitoringpatterns needed to make qpo detections feasible. the most efficient type offuture observatory for searching for x-ray qpos in agn is an x-ray all-skymonitor (asm). a sufficiently sensitive asm would be ideally suited todetecting low frequency qpos in nearby agn. the detection of agn qpos wouldstrengthen the agn-gbh connection and could serve as powerful diagnostics ofthe black hole mass, and the structure of the x-ray emitting region in agn.

astro-ph;0511576	discovery of an afterglow extension of the prompt phase of two gamma ray  bursts observed by swift	bat and xrt observations of two recent well-covered grbs observed by swift,grb 050315 and grb 050319, show clearly a prompt component joining the onset ofthe afterglow emission. by fitting a power law form to the gamma-ray spectrum,we extrapolate the time dependent fluxes measured by the bat, in the energyband 15-350 kev, into the spectral regime observed by the xrt 0.2-10 kev, andexamine the functional form of the rate of decay of the two light curves. wefind that the bat and xrt light curves merge to form a unified curve. there isa period of steep decay up to ~300 s, followed by a flatter decay. the durationof the steep decay, ~100 s in the source frame after correcting forcosmological time dilation, agrees roughly with a theoretical estimate for thedeceleration time of the relativistic ejecta as it interacts with circumstellarmaterial. for grb 050315, the steep decay can be characterized by anexponential form, where one e-folding decay time t_e(bat) ~ 24+/-2 s, andt_e(xrt) ~ 35+/-2 s. for grb 050319, a power law decay -(d ln f/d ln t) = n,where n is about 3, provides a reasonable fit. the early time x-ray fluxes areconsistent with representing the lower energy tail of the prompt emission, andprovide our first quantitative measure of the decay of the prompt gamma-rayemission over a large dynamic range in flux. the initial steep decay isexpected due to the delayed high latitude photons from a curved shell ofrelativistic plasma illuminated only for a short interval. the overallconclusion is that the prompt phase of grbs remains observable for hundreds ofseconds longer than previously thought.

astro-ph;0511579	an origin for short g-ray bursts unassociated with current star  formation	two short (&lt;2 s) g-ray bursts (grbs) have recently been localized and fadingafterglow counterparts detected. the combination of these two results leftunclear the nature of the host galaxies of the bursts, because one was astar-forming dwarf, while the other was probably an elliptical galaxy. here wereport the x-ray localization of a short burst (grb 050724) with unusual g-rayand x-ray properties. the x-ray afterglow lies off the centre of an ellipticalgalaxy at a redshift of z=0.258, coincident with the position determined byground-based optical and radio observations. the low level of star formationtypical for elliptical galaxies makes it unlikely that the burst originated n asupernova explosion. a supernova origin was also ruled out for grb 050709, eventhough that burst took place in a galaxy with current star formation. theisotropic energy for the short bursts is 2-3 orders of magnitude lower han thatfor the long bursts. our results therefore suggest that an alternative sourceof bursts -- the of binary systems of neutron stars or a neutron star-blackhole pair -- are the progenitors of short bursts.

astro-ph;0601125	the early x-ray emission from grbs	we present observations of the early x-ray emission for a sample of 40gamma-ray bursts (grbs) obtained using the swift satellite for which thenarrow-field instruments were pointed at the burst within 10 minutes of thetrigger. using data from the burst alert and x-ray telescopes, we show that thex-ray light curve can be well described by an exponential that relaxes into apower law, often with flares superimposed. the transition time between theexponential and the power law provides a physically defined timescale for theburst duration. in most bursts the power law breaks to a shallower decay withinthe first hour, and a late emission "hump" is observed which can last for manyhours. in other grbs the hump is weak or absent. the observed variety in theshape of the early x-ray light curve can be explained as a combination of threecomponents: prompt emission from the central engine; afterglow; and the latehump. in this scenario, afterglow emission begins during or soon after theburst and the observed shape of the x-ray light curve depends on the relativestrengths of the emission due to the central engine and that of the afterglow.there is a strong correlation such that those grbs with stronger afterglowcomponents have brighter early optical emission. the late emission hump canhave a total fluence equivalent to that of the prompt phase. grbs with thestrongest late humps have weak or no x-ray flares.

astro-ph;9905323	x-ray spectral complexity in narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies	we present a systematic analysis of the x-ray spectral properties of a sampleof 22 ``narrow-line'' seyfert 1 galaxies for which data are available from theasca public archive. many of these sources, which were selected on the basis oftheir relatively narrow h-beta line width (fwhm &lt;= 2000 km/s), show significantspectral complexity in the x-ray band. their measured hard power-law continuahave photon indices spanning the range 1.6 - 2.5 with a mean of 2.1, which isonly slightly steeper than the norm for ``broad-line'' seyfert 1s. all but fourof the sources exhibit a soft excess, which can be modelled as blackbodyemission (t_{bb} ~ 100 - 300 ev) superposed on the underlying power-law. thissoft component is often so strong that, even in the relatively hard bandpass ofasca, it contains a significant fraction, if not the bulk, of the x-rayluminosity, apparently ruling out models in which the soft excess is producedentirely through reprocessing of the hard continuum.  most notably, 6 of the 22 objects show evidence for a broad absorptionfeature centred in the energy range 1.1 - 1.4 kev, which could be the signatureof resonance absorption in highly ionized material. a further 3 sources exhibit``warm absorption'' edges in the 0.7 - 0.9 kev bandpass. remarkably, all 9``absorbed'' sources have h-beta line widths below 1000 km/s, which is lessthan the median value for the sample taken as a whole. this tendency for verynarrow line widths to correlate with the presence of ionized absorptionfeatures in the soft x-ray spectra of nls1s, if confirmed in larger samples,may provide a further clue in the puzzle of active galactic nuclei.

astro-ph;9906445	evidence for an ionised disc in the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy ark 564	we present simultaneous asca and rxte observations of ark 564, the brightestknown ``narrow-line'' seyfert 1 in the 2-10 kev band. the measured x-rayspectrum is dominated by a steep (gamma~2.7) power-law continuum extending toat least 20 kev, with imprinted fe k-line and -edge features and an additional``soft excess'' below ~1.5 kev. the energy of the iron k-edge indicates thepresence of highly ionised material, which we identify in terms of reflectionfrom a strongly irradiated accretion disc. the high reflectivity of thisputative disc, together with its strong intrinsic o viii ly-alpha and o viiirecombination emission, can also explain much of the observed soft excess flux.furthermore, the same spectral model also provides a reasonable match to thevery steep 0.1-2 kev spectrum deduced from rosat data. the source is much morerapidly variable than ``normal'' seyfert 1s of comparable luminosity,increasing by a factor of ~50% in 1.6 hours, with no measurable lag between the0.5-2 kev and 3-12 kev bands, consistent with much of the soft excess fluxarising from reprocessing of the primary power-law component in the innerregion of the accretion disc. we note, finally, that if the unusually steeppower-law component is a result of compton cooling of a disc corona by anintense soft photon flux, then the implication is that the bulk of these softphotons lie in the unobserved extreme ultraviolet.

astro-ph;9911475	pds 456: an extreme accretion rate quasar?	we present quasi-simultaneous asca and rxte observations of the most luminousknown agn in the local (z&lt;0.3) universe, the recently discovered quasar pds456. multiwavelength observations have been conducted which show that pds 456has a bolometric luminosity of 10^47 erg/s peaking in the uv part of thespectrum. in the x-ray band the 2-10 kev (rest-frame) luminosity is 10^45erg/s. the broad-band x-ray spectrum obtained with asca and rxte containsconsiderable complexity. the most striking feature observed is a very deep,ionised iron k edge, observed at 8.7 kev in the quasar rest-frame. we find thatthese features are consistent with reprocessing from highly ionised matter,probably the inner accretion disk. pds 456 appeared to show a strong (factor of2.1) outburst in just 17ksec, although non-intrinsic sources cannot becompletely ruled out. if confirmed, this would be an unusual event for such ahigh-luminosity source, with the light-crossing-time corresponding to 2schwarzschild radii. the implication would be that flaring occurs within thevery central regions, or else that pds 456 is a `super-eddington' orrelativistically beamed system. overall we conclude on the basis of the extremeblue/uv luminosity, the rapid x-ray variability and from the imprint of highlyionised material on the x-ray spectrum, that pds 456 is a quasar with anunusually high accretion rate.

0810.1249	a comprehensive x-ray spectral analysis of the seyfert 1.5 ngc 3227	we present results of a 100 ks xmm observation of the seyfert 1.5 ngc 3227.our best-fit broadband model to the pn spectrum consists of a moderately flat(photon index 1.57) hard x-ray power-law absorbed by cold gas with n_h = 3 *10^21 cm^-2, plus a strong soft excess, modeled as a steep power law with aphoton index of 3.35, absorbed by cold gas with n_h = 9 * 10^20 cm^-2. the softexcess normalization increases by ~20% in ~20 ks, independently of the hardx-ray component, and the uv continuum, tracked via the om, also shows a strongincreasing trend over the observation, consistent with reprocessing of softx-ray emission. warm absorber signatures are evident in both the epic and rgs;we model two layers, with log(xi) = 1.2 and 2.9 erg cm s^-1, and with similarcolumn densities (~1-2 * 10^21 cm^-2). the outflow velocities relative tosystemic of the high- and low-ionization absorbers are estimated to be-(2060(+240,-170)) km/s and -(420(+430,-190)) km/s, respectively. the fe kalpha line width fwhm is 7000 +/- 1500 km/s; its inferred radius is consistentwith the blr and with the inner radius of the dust reverberation-mapped bysuganuma et al. an emission feature near 6.0 kev is modeled equally well as anarrow redshifted fe k line, possibly associated with a disk "hot-spot," or asthe red wing to a relativistically broadened fe line profile. swift-bat andarchival rxte data suggest at most weak compton reflection (r &lt;~ 0.5), and ahigh-energy cutoff near 100 kev. from rxte monitoring, we find tentativeevidence for a significant fraction of the fe line flux to track continuumvariations on time scales &lt; 700 days.
