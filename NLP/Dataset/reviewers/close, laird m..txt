0904.3936	a search for wide companions to the extrasolar planetary system hr 8799	the extrasolar planetary system around hr 8799 is the first multiplanetsystem ever imaged. it is also, by a wide margin, the highest mass system with&gt;27 jupiters of planetary mass past 25 au. this is a remarkable system with noanalogue with any other known planetary system. in the first part of this paperwe investigate the nature of two faint objects imaged near the system. theseobjects are considerably fainter (h=20.4, and 21.6 mag) and more distant(projected separations of 612, and 534 au) than the three known planetarycompanions b, c, and d (68-24 au). it is possible that these two objects couldbe lower mass planets (of mass ~5 and ~3 jupiters) that have been scattered towider orbits. we make the first direct comparison of newly reduced archivalgemini adaptive optics images to archival hst/nicmos images. with nearly adecade between these epochs we can accurately assess the proper motion natureof each candidate companion. we find that both objects are unbound to hr 8799and are background. we estimate that hr 8799 has no companions of h&lt;22 from~5-15 arcsec. any scattered giant planets in the hr 8799 system are &gt;600 au orless than 3 jupiters in mass. in the second part of this paper we carry out asearch for wider common proper motion objects. while we identify no boundcompanions to hr 8799, our search yields 16 objects within 1 degree in thenomad catalog and poss dss images with similar (+/-20 mas/yr) proper motions tohr 8799, three of which warrant follow-up observations.

0706.3824	the very nearby m/t dwarf binary scr 1845-6357	the recently discovered star scr 1845-6357 is the first late m/t dwarf binarydiscovered. scr 1845 is a particular object due to its tight orbit (currentlyaround 4 au) and its proximity to the sun (3.85 pc). we present spatiallyresolved vlt/naco images and low resolution spectra of scr 1845 in the j, h andk near-infrared bands. since the t dwarf companion, scr 1845b, is so close tothe primary scr 1845a, orbital motion is evident even within a year. followingthe orbital motion, the binary's mass can be measured accurately within adecade, making scr 1845b a key t-dwarf mass-luminosity calibrator. the nirspectra allow for accurate determination of spectral type and also for roughestimates of the object's physical parameters. the spectral type of scr 1845bis determined by direct comparison of the flux calibrated jhk spectra with tdwarf standard template spectra and also by nir spectral indices obtained fromsynthetic photometry. constrained values for surface gravity, effectivetemperature and metallicity are derived by comparison with model spectra. ourdata prove that scr 1845b is a brown dwarf of spectral type t6 that isco-moving with and therefore gravitationally bound to the m8.5 primary. fittingthe nir spectrum of scr 1845b to model spectra yields an effective temperatureof about 950k and a surface gravity log(g)=5.1 (cgs) assuming solarmetallicity. mass and age of scr 1845b are in the range 40 to 50 jupiter massesand 1.8 to 3.1 gyr.

0906.4320	a tentative detection of a starspot during consecutive transits of an  extrasolar planet from the ground: no evidence of a double transiting planet  system around tres-1	there have been numerous reports of anomalies during transits of the planettres-1b. recently, rabus and coworkers' analysis of hst observations lead themto claim brightening anomalies during transit might be caused by either asecond transiting planet or a cool starspot. observations of two consecutivetransits are presented here from the university of arizona's 61-inch kuipertelescope on may 12 and may 15, 2008 ut. a 5.4 +/- 1.7 mmag (0.54 +/- 0.17%)brightening anomaly was detected during the first half of the transit on may 12and again in the second half of the transit on may 15th. we conclude that thisis a tentative detection of a r greater than or equal to 6 earth radii starspotrotating on the surface of the star. we suggest that all evidence to datesuggest tres-1 has a spotty surface and there is no need to introduce a secondtransiting planet in this system to explain these anomalies. we are only ableto constrain the rotational period of the star to 40.2 +22.9 -14.6 days, due toprevious errors in measuring the alignment of the stellar spin axis with theplanetary orbital axis. this is consistent with the previously observed p_obs =33.2 +22.3 -14.3 day period. we note that this technique could be applied toother transiting systems for which starspots exist on the star in the transitpath of the planet in order to constrain the rotation rate of the star.(abridged)

0907.1685	on the apparent orbital inclination change of the extrasolar transiting  planet tres-2b	on june 15, 2009 ut the transit of tres-2b was detected using the universityof arizona's 1.55 meter kuiper telescope with 2.0-2.5 millimag rms accuracy inthe i-band. we find a central transit time of $t_c = 2454997.76286 \pm0.00035$hjd, an orbital period of $p = 2.4706127 \pm 0.0000009$ days, and aninclination angle of $i = 83^{\circ}.92 \pm 0.05$, which is consistent with ourre-fit of the original i-band light curve of o'donovan et al. (2006) where wefind $i = 83^{\circ}.84 \pm0.05$. we calculate an insignificant inclinationchange of $\delta i = -0^{\circ}.08 \pm 0.07$ over the last 3 years, and assuch, our observations rule out, at the $\sim 11 \sigma$ level, the apparentchange of orbital inclination to $i_{predicted} = 83^{\circ}.35 \pm0.1$ aspredicted by mislis and schmitt (2009) and mislis et al. (2010) for our epoch.moreover, our analysis of a recently published kepler space telescope lightcurve (gilliland et al. 2010) for tres-2b finds an inclination of $i =83^{\circ}.91 \pm0.03$ for a similar epoch. these kepler results definitivelyrule out change in $i$ as a function of time. indeed, we detect no significantchanges in any of the orbital parameters of tres-2b.

0909.4531	a uniform analysis of 118 stars with high-contrast imaging: long period  extrasolar giant planets are rare around sun-like stars	we expand on the results of nielsen et al. (2008), using the null result forgiant extrasolar planets around the 118 target stars from the vlt naco h and ksband planet search (masciadri et al. 2005), the vlt and mmt simultaneousdifferential imaging (sdi) survey (biller et al. 2007), and the gemini deepplanet survey (lafreniere et al. 2007) to set constraints on the population ofgiant extrasolar planets. our analysis is extended to include the planetluminosity models of fortney et al. (2008), as well as the correlation betweenstellar mass and frequency of giant planets found by johnson et al. (2007).doubling the sample size of fgkm stars strengthens our conclusions: a model forextrasolar giant planets with power-laws for mass and semi-major axis as givingby cumming et al. (2008) cannot, with 95% confidence, have planets beyond 65au, compared to the value of 94 au reported in nielsen et al. (2008), using themodels of baraffe et al. (2003). when the johnson et al. (2007) correction forstellar mass (which gives fewer jupiter-mass companions to m stars with respectto solar-type stars) is applied, however, this limit moves out to 82 au. forthe relatively new fortney et al. (2008) models, which predict fainter planetsacross most of parameter space, these upper limits, with and without acorrection for stellar mass, are 182 and 234 au, respectively.

1008.0146	enabling technologies for visible adaptive optics: the magellan adaptive  secondary visao camera	since its beginnings, diffraction-limited ground-based adaptive optics (ao)imaging has been limited to wavelengths in the near ir ({\lambda} &gt; 1 micron)and longer. visible ao ({\lambda} &lt; 1 micron) has proven to be difficultbecause shorter wavelengths require wavefront correction on very short spatialand temporal scales. the pupil must be sampled very finely, which requiresdense actuator spacing and fine wavefront sampling with large dynamic range. inaddition, atmospheric dispersion is much more significant in the visible thanin the near-ir. imaging over a broad visible band requires a very goodatmospheric dispersion corrector (adc). even with these technologies, our aosimulations using the caos code, combined with the optical and site parametersfor the 6.5m magellan telescope, demonstrate a large temporal variability ofvisible ({\lambda}=0.7 micron) strehl on timescales of 50 ms. over severalhundred milliseconds, the visible strehl can be as high at 50% and as low as10%. taking advantage of periods of high strehl requires either the ability toread out the ccd very fast, thereby introducing significant amounts ofread-noise, or the use of a fast asynchronous shutter that can block thelow-strehl light. our magellan visao camera will use an advanced adc, ahigh-speed shutter, and our 585 actuator adaptive secondary to achievebroadband (0.5-1.0 micron) diffraction limited images on the 6.5m magellan claytelescope in chile at las campanas observatory. these will be the sharpest anddeepest visible direct images taken to date with a resolution of 17 mas, afactor of 2.7 better than the diffraction limit of the hubble space telescope.

1101.4314	sirius b imaged in the mid-infrared: no evidence for a remnant planetary  system	evidence is building that remnants of solar systems might orbit a largepercentage of white dwarfs, as the polluted atmospheres of daz and dbz whitedwarfs indicate the very recent accretion of metal-rich material. (zuckerman etal. 2010). some of these polluted white dwarfs are found to have largemid-infrared excesses from close-in debris disks that are thought to bereservoirs for the metal accretion. these systems are coined dazd white dwarfs(von hippel et al. 2007). here we investigate the claims of bonnet-bidaud &amp;pantin (2008) that sirius b, the nearest white dwarf to the sun, might have aninfrared excess from a dusty debris disk. sirius b's companion, sirius a iscommonly observed as a mid-infrared photometric standard in the southernhemisphere. we combine several years of gemini/t-recs photometric standardobservations to produce deep mid-infrared imaging in five ~10 micron filters(broad n + 4 narrowband), which reveal the presence of sirius b. our photometryis consistent with the expected photospheric emission such that we constrainany mid-infrared excess to &lt;10% of the photosphere. thus we conclude thatsirius b does not have a large dusty disk, as seen in dazd white dwarfs.

1103.1880	evidence against an edge-on disk around the extrasolar planet 2mass 1207  b and a new thick cloud explanation for its under-luminosity	(abridged) since the discovery of the first directly-imaged, planetary-massobject, 2mass 1207 b, several works have sought to explain a disparity betweenits observed temperature and luminosity. given its known age, distance, andspectral type, 2mass 1207 b is under-luminous by a factor of ~10 (~2.5 mags)when compared to standard models of brown-dwarf/giant-planet evolution. in thispaper, we study three possible sources of 2mass 1207 b's under-luminosity.first, we investigate mohanty et al. (2007)'s hypothesis that a near edge-ondisk might be responsible for 2mass 1207 b's under-luminosity. we conclude thatthe hypothesis is unlikely due to the lack of variability seen in multi-epochphotometry and unnecessary due to the increasing sample of under-luminousbrown-dwarfs/giant-exoplanets that cannot be explained by an edge-on disk.next, we test the analogous possibility that a spherical shell of dust, couldexplain 2mass 1207 b's under-luminosity. models containing enough dust tocreate ~2.5 mags of extinction, placed at reasonable radii, are ruled out byour new gemini/t-recs 8.7 micron photometric upper-limit for 2mass 1207 b.finally, we investigate the possibility that 2mass 1207 b is intrinsicallycooler than the commonly used ames-dusty fits to its spectrum, and thus it isnot, in fact, under-luminous. new, thick cloud model grids by madhusudhan etal. (2011) fit 2mass 1207 b's 1-10 micron sed well, but they do not quite fitits near-infrared spectrum. however, we suggest that with some "tuning", theymight be capable of simultaneously reproducing 2mass 1207 b's spectral shapeand luminosity. in this case, the whole class of young, under-luminousbrown-dwarfs/giant-exoplanets might be explained by atmospheres that are ableto suspend thick, dusty clouds in their photospheres at lower temperatures thanfield brown-dwarfs.

1107.3161	dust grain evolution in spatially resolved t tauri binaries	core-accretion planet formation begins in protoplanetary disks with thegrowth of small, ism dust grains into larger particles. the progress of graingrowth, which can be quantified using 10 micron silicate spectroscopy, hasbroad implications for the final products of planet formation. previous studieshave attempted to correlate stellar and disk properties with the 10 micronsilicate feature in an effort to determine which stars are efficient at graingrowth. thus far there does not appear to be a dominant correlated parameter.in this paper, we use spatially resolved adaptive optics spectroscopy of 9 ttauri binaries as tight as 0.25" to determine if basic properties sharedbetween binary stars, such as age, composition, and formation history, have aneffect on dust grain evolution. we find with 90-95% confidence that thesilicate feature equivalent widths of binaries are more similar than those ofrandomly paired single stars, implying that shared properties do play animportant role in dust grain evolution. at lower statistical significance, wefind with 82% confidence that the secondary has a more prominent silicateemission feature (i.e., smaller grains) than the primary. if confirmed bylarger surveys, this would imply that spectral type and/or binarity areimportant factors in dust grain evolution.

1312.1265	hd 106906 b: a planetary-mass companion outside a massive debris disk	we report the discovery of a planetary-mass companion, hd 106906 b, with thenew magellan adaptive optics (magao) + clio2 system. the companion is detectedwith clio2 in three bands: $j$, $k_s$, and $l^\prime$, and lies at a projectedseparation of 7.1'' (650 au). it is confirmed to be comoving with its $13\pm2$myr-old f5 host using hubble space telescope/advanced camera for surveysastrometry over a time baseline of 8.3 yr. dusty and cond evolutionary modelspredict the companion's luminosity corresponds to a mass of $11\pm2 m_{jup}$,making it one of the most widely separated planetary-mass companions known. weclassify its magellan/folded-port infrared echellette $j/h/k$ spectrum asl$2.5\pm1$; the triangular $h$-band morphology suggests an intermediate surfacegravity. hd 106906 a, a pre-main-sequence lower centaurus crux member, wasinitially targeted because it hosts a massive debris disk detected via infraredexcess emission in unresolved spitzer imaging and spectroscopy. the diskemission is best fit by a single component at 95 k, corresponding to an inneredge of 15-20 au and an outer edge of up to 120 au. if the companion is on aneccentric ($e&gt;0.65$) orbit, it could be interacting with the outer edge of thedisk. close-in, planet-like formation followed by scattering to the currentlocation would likely disrupt the disk and is disfavored. furthermore, we findno additional companions, though we could detect similar-mass objects atprojected separations $&gt;35$ au. in situ formation in a binary-star-like processis more probable, although the companion-to-primary mass ratio, at $&lt;1\%$, isunusually small.

1509.00007	direct exoplanet detection with binary differential imaging	binaries are typically excluded from direct imaging exoplanet surveys.however, the recent findings of kepler and radial velocity programs show thatplanets can and do form in binary systems. here, we suggest that visualbinaries offer unique advantages for direct imaging. we show that binarydifferential imaging (bdi), whereby two stars are imaged simultaneously at thesame wavelength within the isoplanatic patch at high strehl ratio, offersimproved point spread function (psf) subtraction that can result in increasedsensitivity to planets close to each star. we demonstrate this by observing ayoung visual binary separated by 4\asec ~with magao/clio-2 at 3.9 \microns,where the strehl ratio is high, the isoplanatic patch is large, and giantplanets are bright. comparing bdi to angular differential imaging (adi), wefind that bdi's 5$\sigma$ contrast is \about 0.5 mags better than adi's within\about 1\asec ~for the particular binary we observed. because planets typicallyreside close to their host stars, bdi is a promising technique for discoveringexoplanets in stellar systems that are often ignored. bdi is also 2-4$\times$more efficient than adi and classical reference psf subtraction, since planetscan be detected around both the target and psf reference simultaneously. we arecurrently exploiting this technique in a new magao survey for giant planets in140 young nearby visual binaries. bdi on a space-based telescope would not belimited by isoplanatism effects and would therefore be an even more powerfultool for imaging and discovering planets.

astro-ph;0210271	discovery of a tight brown dwarf companion to the low mass star lhs  2397a	using the adaptive optics system, hokupa'a, at gemini-north, we have directlyimaged a companion around the ukirt faint standard m8 star, lhs 2397a (fs 129)at a separation of 2.96 au. near-infrared photometry of the companion has shownit to be an l7.5 brown dwarf and confirmed the spectral type of the primary tobe m8. we also derive a substellar mass of the companion of 0.068 msun,although masses in the range (0.061-0.069) are possible, and the primary massas 0.090 msun (0.089-0.094). reanalysis of archival imaging from hst hasconfirmed the secondary as a common proper motion object. this binaryrepresents the first clear example of a brown dwarf companion within 4 au of alow mass star and should be one of the first late l dwarfs to have a dynamicalmass. as part of a larger survey of m8-l0 stars, this object may indicate thatthere is no ``brown dwarf desert'' around low mass primaries.

astro-ph;0301095	detection of nine m8.0-l0.5 binaries: the very low mass binary  population and its implications for brown dwarf and vlm star formation	use of the highly sensitive hokupa'a/gemini curvature wavefront sensor hasallowed direct adaptive optics (ao) guiding on very low mass (vlm) stars withspt=m8.0-l0.5. a survey of 39 such objects detected 9 vlm binaries. most ofthese systems are tight (separation &lt;5 au) and have similar masses (deltaks&lt;0.8 mag; 0.85&lt;q&lt;1.0). we find a sensitivity corrected binary fraction in therange 15+/-7% for m8.0-l0.5 stars with separations &gt;2.6 au. this is slightlyless than the 32+/-9% measured for more massive m0-m4 dwarfs over the sameseparation range (fischer &amp; marcy 1992). it appears m8.0-l0.5 binaries (as wellas l and t dwarf binaries) have a much smaller semi-major axis distributionpeak (~4 au) than early m binaries. we also find no vlm binary systems (definedhere as systems with m_tot&lt;0.185 solar masses) with separations &gt;15 au.  we briefly explore possible reasons why vlm binaries are slightly lesscommon, nearly equal mass, and much more tightly bound compared to more massivebinaries. we find that a kick during the ejection of a forming vlm binary froma close triple or quadruple encounter (imparting a differential kick of ~3 km/sbetween the members of the binary) could reproduce the observed cut-off in thesemi-major axis distribution at ~20 au. however, the estimated binarity (~&lt;5%;bate et al. 2002) produced by such "ejection scenarios" is below the 9-15%observed. similarly, the dynamical decay models of sterzik &amp; durisen (1998);durisen, sterzik, &amp; pickett (2001) also cannot produce a vlm binary fractionabove ~5%. our estimate of a fragmentation-produced vlm binary semi-major axisdistribution contains a significant fraction of ``wide'' vlm binaries with a&gt;20au in contrast to observation. hence more detailed theoretical work will beneeded to explain this very interesting vlm binary population.

astro-ph;0308496	an adaptive optics survey of m6.0-m7.5 stars: discovery of three very  low mass binary systems including two probable hyades members	a survey of 30 nearby m6.0-m7.5 dwarfs with ks&lt;12 mag utilizing the hokupa'aadaptive optics system at the gemini north telescope has discovered 3 newbinary systems. all 3 systems have separations between 0.12-0.29 arcsec (3-10au) with similar mass ratios (q&gt;0.8, delta ks&lt;0.7). this result gives furthersupport to the suggestion that wide (a&gt;20 au) very low mass (m_{tot}&lt;0.185m_sun) binary systems are exceedingly rare or perhaps even non-existant. thesemimajor axis distribution of these systems peaks at ~5 au, tighter than moremassive m and g binary distributions which have a broad peak at separations of\~30 au. we find a sensitivity-corrected binary fraction in the range of5_{-2}^{+4}% for m6.0-m7.5 stars with separations a&gt;3 au. this binary frequencyis less than the ~32% measured among early m dwarfs over the same separationrange. two of the low-mass binaries are probable hyades open cluster membersbased on proper motions, cluster membership probabilities, radial velocities,and near-ir photometry. lp415-20 has the distinction of being the tightest (3.6au) multiple system ever spatially resolved in the cluster and the companionsof lp415-20 and lp475-855 are among the least massive objects ever resolved inthe hyades with estimated masses of 0.081_{-0.010}^{+0.009} and0.082_{-0.009}^{+0.009} m_{\sun}.

astro-ph;0412240	discovery of two very low-mass binaries: final results of an adaptive  optics survey of nearby m6.0-m7.5 stars	we present updated results of a high-resolution, magnitude limited (ks&lt;12mag) imaging survey of nearby low-mass m6.0-m7.5 field stars. the observationswere carried out using adaptive optics at the gemini north, vlt, keck ii, andsubaru telescopes. our sample of 36 stars consists predominantly of nearby (&lt;30pc) field stars, 5 of which we have resolved as binaries. two of the binarysystems, 2massi j0429184-312356 and 2massi j1847034+552243, are presented herefor the first time. all 5 discovered binary systems have separations between0.08"-0.53" (2-9 au) with similar mass ratios (q&gt;0.8, delta ks &lt; 1 mag). thisresult supports the hypothesis that wide (a&gt;20 au) very low-mass (m_tot&lt;0.19m_sun) binary systems are rare. the projected semimajor axis distribution ofthese systems peak at ~ 5 au and we report a sensitivity-corrected binaryfraction of 9% (-3%, +4%) for stars with primaries of spectral type m6.0-m7.5with separations &gt;3 au and mass ratios q&gt;0.6. within these instrumentalsensitivities, these results support the overall trend that both the semimajoraxis distribution and binary fraction are a function of the mass of the primarystar and decrease with decreasing primary mass. these observations provideimportant constraints for low-mass binary star formation theories.

astro-ph;0604336	resolving the dusty circumstellar structure of the enigmatic symbiotic  star ch cygni with the mmt adaptive optics system	we imaged the symbiotic star ch cyg and two psf calibration stars using theunique 6.5m mmt deformable secondary adaptive optics system. ourhigh-resolution (fwhm=0.3"), very high strehl (98%+-2%) mid-infrared (9.8 and11.7 um) images of ch cyg allow us to probe finer length scales than everbefore for this object. ch cyg is significantly extended compared to ourunresolved psf calibration stars (mu uma and alpha her) at 9.8 and 11.7 um. weestimated the size of the extension by convolving a number of simple gaussianmodels with the mu uma psf and determining which model provided the best fit tothe data. adopting the hipparcos distance for this object of 270 pc, we found anearly gaussian extension with a fwhm at 9.8 um of ~40.5+-2.7 au (0.15+-0.01")and a fwhm at 11.7 um of 45.9+-2.7 au (0.17+-0.01"). after subtracting out thegaussian component of the emission (convolved with our psf), we found a faint\~0.7" asymmetric extension which peaks in flux ~0.5" north of the stars. thisextension is roughly coincident with the northern knotlike feature seen in hstwfpc2 images obtained in 1999.

astro-ph;0608574	the wide brown dwarf binary oph 1622-2405 and discovery of a wide, low  mass binary in ophiuchus (oph 1623-2402): a new class of young evaporating  wide binaries?	we imaged five objects near the star forming clouds of ophiuchus with thekeck laser guide star ao system. we resolved allers et al. (2006)'s #11 (oph16222-2405) and #16 (oph 16233-2402) into binary systems. the #11 object isresolved into a 243 au binary, the widest known for a very low mass (vlm)binary. the binary nature of #11 was discovered first by allers (2005) andindependently here during which we obtained the first spatially resolved r~2000near-infrared (j &amp; k) spectra, mid-ir photometry, and orbital motion estimates.we estimate for 11a and 11b gravities (log(g)&gt;3.75), ages (5+/-2 myr),luminosities (log(l/lsun)=-2.77+/-0.10 and -2.96+/-0.10), and temperatures(teff=2375+/-175 and 2175+/-175 k). we find self-consistent dusty evolutionarymodel (chabrier et al. 2000) masses of 17+4-5 mjup and 14+6-5 mjup, for 11a and11b respectively. our masses are higher than those previously reported (13-15mjup and 7-8 mjup) by jayawardhana &amp; ivanov (2006b). hence, we find the systemis unlikely a ``planetary mass binary'', (in agreement with luhman et al. 2007)but it has the second lowest mass and lowest binding energy of any knownbinary. oph #11 and oph #16 belong to a newly recognized population of wide(&gt;100 au), young (&lt;10 myr), roughly equal mass, vlm stellar and brown dwarfbinaries. we deduce that ~6+/-3% of young (&lt;10 myr) vlm objects are in suchwide systems. however, only 0.3+/-0.1% of old field vlm objects are found insuch wide systems. thus, young, wide, vlm binary populations may beevaporating, due to stellar encounters in their natal clusters, leading to afield population depleted in wide vlm systems.

astro-ph;0609356	discovery of 9 new companions to nearby young m stars with the altair ao  system	we present results of a high-resolution, near-infrared survey of 41 nearby,young (&lt;~300 myr) m0-m5.0 dwarfs using the altair natural guide star adaptiveoptics system at the gemini north telescope. twelve of the objects appear to bebinaries, 7 of which are reported here for the first time. one triple systemwas discovered. statistical properties are studied and compared with earlier (fto k) and later (&gt;= m6 very low-mass, vlm) populations. we find that theseparation distribution of the binaries in this sample peaks at 13+14-9 au,which is consistent with previous measurements of early-m binaries. hence,early-m binaries seem to occur in--on average--tighter systems than g binaries.at the same time they are significantly wider than field vlm binary stars. thedistribution of mass ratios q of primary and secondary stars was found to showan intermediate distribution between the strongly q--&gt;1 peaked distribution offield vlm systems and the almost flat distribution of earlier-type stars.consequently, we show evidence for relatively young, early-m binariesrepresenting a transition between the well known earlier star distributions andthe recently examined field vlm population characteristics. despite the factthat this survey was dedicated to the search for faint brown dwarf andplanetary mass companions, all planetary mass candidates were backgroundobjects. we exclude the existence of physical companions with masses greaterthan 10 jupiter masses (m_jup) at separations of &gt;~40 au and masses greaterthan 24 m_jup for separations &gt;~10 au around 37 of the 41 observed objects.

astro-ph;0610658	a reflective gaussian coronagraph for exao: laboratory performance	we report laboratory results of a coronagraphic test bench to assess theintensity reduction differences between a "gaussian" tapered focal planecoronagraphic mask and a classical hard-edged "top hat" function mask atextreme adaptive optics (exao) strehl ratios of ~94%. however, unlike atraditional coronagraph design, we insert a reflective focal plane mask at 45degree to the optical axis. we also used an intermediate secondary mask("mask_2") before a final image in order to block additional mask-edgediffracted light. the test bench simulates the 8.1m gemini north telescope. itincludes one spider vane, different mask radii (r= 1.9, 3.7, 7.4 lambda/d) andtwo types of reflective focal plane masks (hard-edged "top hat" and "gaussian"tapered profiles). in order to investigate the relative performance of thesecompeting coronagraphic designs with regard to extra-solar planet detectionsensitivity, we utilize the simulation of realistic extra-solar planetpopulations (nielson et al. 2006). with an appropriate translation of ourlaboratory results to expected telescope performance, a "gaussian" tapered maskradius of 3.7 lambda/d with an additional mask ("mask_2") performs best(highest planet detection sensitivity). for a full survey with this optimaldesign, the simulation predicts ~30% more planets detected compared to asimilar sized "top hat" function mask with "mask_2." using the best design, thepoint contrast ratio between the stellar psf peak and the coronagraphic psf at10 lambda/d (0.4" in h band if d = 8.1m) is ~10 times higher than a classicallyot "top hat" coronagraph. hence, we find a gaussian apodized mask with anadditional blocking mask is a superior (~10x higher contrast) than use of aclassical lyot coronagraph for exao-like strehls.

astro-ph;0702013	discovery of a 66 mas ultracool binary with laser guide star adaptive  optics	we present the discovery of 2mass j21321145+1341584ab as a closely separated(0.066") very low-mass field dwarf binary resolved in the near-infrared by thekeck ii telescope using laser guide star adaptive optics. physical associationis deduced from the angular proximity of the components and constraints ontheir common proper motion. we have obtained a near-infrared spectrum of thebinary and find that it is best described by an l5+/-0.5 primary and anl7.5+/-0.5 secondary. model-dependent masses predict that the two componentsstraddle the hydrogen burning limit threshold with the primary likely stellarand the secondary likely substellar. the properties of this sytem - closeprojected separation (1.8+/-0.3 au) and near unity mass ratio - are consistentwith previous results for very low-mass field binaries. the relatively shortestimated orbital period of this system (~7-12 yr) makes it a good target fordynamical mass measurements. interestingly, the system's angular separation isthe tightest yet for any very low-mass binary published from a ground-basedtelescope and is the tightest binary discovered with laser guide star adaptiveoptics to date.

astro-ph;0703564	new photometry and spectra of ab doradus c: an accurate mass  determination of a young low-mass object with theoretical evolutionary tracks	we present new photometric and spectroscopic measurements for the unique,young, low-mass evolutionary track calibrator ab dor c. while the new ksphotometry is similar to that previously published in close et al. (2005) thespectral type is found to be earlier. based on new h &amp; k ifs spectra of ab dorc (thatte et al. 2007; paper 1) we adopt a spectral type of m5.5+/-1.0 for abdor c. this is considerably earlier than the m8+/-1 estimated in close et al.(2005) and nielsen et al. (2005) yet is consistent with the m6+/-1independently derived by luhman &amp; potter (2005). however, the spectrumpresented in paper 1 and analyzed here is a significant improvement over anyprevious spectrum of ab dor c. we also present new astrometry for the systemwhich further supports a 0.090+/-0.005 msun mass for the system. once armedwith an accurate spectrum and ks flux we find l=0.0021+/-0.0005 lsun andteff=2925{+170}{-145}k for ab dor c. these values are consistent with a ~75 myr0.090+/-0.005 msun object like ab dor c according to the dusty evolutionarytracks (chabrier et al. 2000). hence masses can be estimated from the hrdiagram with the dusty tracks for young low-mass objects like ab dor c.however, we cautiously note that underestimates of the mass from the tracks canoccur if one lacks a proper (continuum preserved) spectra or is relying on nirfluxes alone.

astro-ph;0703565	very high contrast ifu spectroscopy of ab doradus c: 9 mag contrast at  0.2" without a coronagraph using spectral deconvolution	we present an extension of the spectral deconvolution method (sparks &amp; ford2002) to achieve very high contrast at small inner working radii. we apply themethod to the specific case of ground based adaptive optics fed integral fieldspectroscopy (without a coronagraph). utilising the wavelength dependence ofthe airy and speckle patterns, we make an accurate estimate of the psf that canbe scaled and subtracted from the data cube. the residual noise in theresulting spectra is very close to the photon noise from the starlight halo. weutilise the technique to extract a very high snr h &amp; k band spectrum of ab dorc, the low mass companion to ab dor a. by effectively eliminating allcontamination from ab dor a, the extracted spectrum retains both continuum andspectral features. the achieved 1 sigma contrast is 9 mag at 0.2", 11 mag at0.5", in 20 mins exposure time, at an effective spectral bandwidth of 5.5 nm,proving that the method is applicable even in low strehl regimes.  the spectral deconvolution method clearly demonstrates the efficacy of imageslicer based ifus in achieving very high contrast imaging spectroscopy at smallangular separations, validating their use as high contrastspectrographs/imagers for extreme adaptive optics systems.

astro-ph;9803333	pg 1700+518 revisited: adaptive optics imaging and a revised starburst  age for the companion	we present the results of adaptive-optics imaging of the z=0.2923 qso pg1700+518 in the j and h bands. the extension to the north of the qso is clearlyseen to be a discrete companion with a well-defined tidal tail, rather than afeature associated with the host galaxy of pg 1700+518 itself. on the otherhand, an extension to the southwest of the qso (seen best in deeper, butlower-resolution, optical images) does likely comprise tidal material from thehost galaxy. the sed derived from images in j, h, and two non-standard opticalbands indicates the presence of dust intermixed with the stellar component. weuse our previously reported keck spectrum of the companion, the sed found fromthe imaging data, and updated spectral-synthesis models to constrain thestellar populations in the companion and to redetermine the age of thestarburst. while our best-fit age of 0.085 gyr is nearly the same as ourearlier determination, the fit of the new models is considerably better. thisage is found to be remarkably robust with respect to different assumptionsabout the nature of the older stellar component and the effects of dust.
