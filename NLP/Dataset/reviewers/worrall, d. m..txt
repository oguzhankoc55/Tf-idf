0901.1346	high-energy particle acceleration at the radio-lobe shock of centaurus a	we present new results on the shock around the southwest radio lobe ofcentaurus a using data from the chandra very large programme observations. thex-ray spectrum of the emission around the outer southwestern edge of the lobeis well described by a single power-law model with galactic absorption --thermal models are strongly disfavoured, except in the region closest to thenucleus. we conclude that a significant fraction of the x-ray emission aroundthe southwest part of the lobe is synchrotron, not thermal. we infer that inthe region where the shock is strongest and the ambient gas density lowest, theinflation of the lobe is accelerating particles to x-ray synchrotron emittingenergies, similar to supernova remnants such as sn1006. this interpretationresolves a problem of our earlier, purely thermal, interpretation for thisemission, namely that the density compression across the shock was required tobe much larger than the theoretically expected factor of 4. we estimate thatthe lobe is expanding to the southwest with a velocity of ~2600 km/s, roughlymach 8 relative to the ambient medium. we discuss the spatial variation ofspectral index across the shock region, concluding that our observationsconstrain gamma_max for the accelerated particles to be 10^8 at the strongestpart of the shock, consistent with expectations from diffusive shockacceleration theory. finally, we consider the implications of these results forthe production of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (uhecrs) and tev emission fromcentaurus a, concluding that the shock front region is unlikely to be asignificant source of uhecrs, but that tev emission from this region isexpected at levels comparable to current limits at tev energies, for plausibleassumed magnetic field strengths.

0901.3552	a multi-wavelength study of the high surface brightness hotspot in  pks1421-490	long baseline array imaging of the z=0.663 broad line radio galaxypks1421-490 reveals a 400 pc diameter high surface brightness hotspot at aprojected distance of approximately 40kpc from the active galactic nucleus. theisotropic x-ray luminosity of the hotspot, l_{2-10 kev} = 3 10^{44} ergs/s, iscomparable to the isotropic x-ray luminosity of the entire x-ray jet ofpks0637-752, and the peak radio surface brightness is hundreds of times greaterthan that of the brightest hotspot in cygnus a. we model the radio to x-rayspectral energy distribution using a one-zone synchrotron self compton modelwith a near equipartition magnetic field strength of 3 mg. there is a strongbrightness asymmetry between the approaching and receding hotspots and the hotspot spectrum remains flat (alpha ~ 0.5) well beyond the predicted coolingbreak for a 3 mg magnetic field, indicating that the hotspot emission may bedoppler beamed. a high plasma velocity beyond the terminal jet shock could bethe result of a dynamically important magnetic field in the jet. there is achange in the slope of the hotspot radio spectrum at ghz frequencies fromalpha~0.5 to alpha&lt;0.2, which we model by incorporating a cut-off in theelectron energy distribution at gamma_{min} ~ 650, with higher values impliedif the hotspot emission is doppler beamed. we show that a sharp decrease in theelectron number density below a lorentz factor of 650 would arise from thedissipation of bulk kinetic energy in an electron/proton jet with a lorentzfactor gamma_{jet} ~ 5.

0903.2444	the x-ray view of giga-hertz peaked spectrum radio galaxies	this paper presents the x-ray properties of a flux- and volume-limitedcomplete sample of 16 giga-hertz peaked spectrum (gps) galaxies. this studyaddresses three basic questions in our understanding of the nature andevolution of gps sources: a) what is the physical origin of the x-ray emissionin gps galaxies? b) what physical system is associated with the x-rayobscuration? c) what is the "endpoint" of the evolution of compact radiosources? we obtain a 100% (94%) detection fraction in the 0.5-2 kev (0.5-10kev) energy band. gps galaxy x-ray spectra are typically highly obscured. thex-ray column density is higher than the hi column density measured in the radioby a factor of 10 to 100. gps galaxies lie well on the extrapolation to highradio powers of the correlation between radio and x-ray luminosity known inlow-luminosity fri radio galaxies. on the other hand, gps galaxies exhibit acomparable x-ray luminosity to frii radio galaxies, notwithstanding their muchhigher radio luminosity. the x-ray to radio luminosity ratio distribution inour sample is consistent with the bulk of the high-energy emission beingproduced by the accretion disk, as well as with dynamical models of gpsevolution where x-rays are produced by compton upscattering of ambient photons.further support for the former scenario comes from the location of gps galaxiesin the x-ray to o[iii] luminosity ratio versus column density plane. we proposethat gps galaxies are young radio sources, which would reach their fullmaturity as classical frii radio galaxies. however, column densities ~10^{22}atoms/cm/cm could lead to a significant underestimate of dynamical agedeterminations based on the hotspot recession velocity measurements.

0903.2663	the jet-heated x-ray filament in the centaurus a northern middle radio  lobe	we present results from a 40 ks {\em xmm-newton} observation of the x-rayfilament coincident with the southeast edge of the centaurus a northern middleradio lobe (nml). we find that the x-ray filament consists of five spatiallyresolved x-ray knots embedded in a continuous diffuse bridge. the spectrum ofeach knot is well fitted by a thermal model with temperatures ranging from0.3-0.7 kev and subsolar elemental abundances. in four of the five knots,non-thermal models are a poor fit to the spectra, conclusively ruling outsynchrotron or ic/cmb mechanisms for their emission. the internal pressures ofthe knots exceed that of the ambient ism or the equipartition pressure of thenml by more than an order of magnitude, demonstrating that they must be shortlived ($\sim3\times10^6$ yrs). based on energetic arguments, it is implausiblethat these knots have been ionized by the beamed flux from the active galacticnucleus of cen a or that they have been shock-heated by supersonic inflation ofthe nml. in our view, the most viable scenario for the origin of the x-rayknots is that they are the result of cold gas shock heated by a directinteraction with the jet. the lifetimes of the x-ray knots in the nml areroughly the same as the age of the strong shock around the sw inner lobe,suggesting they were created in the same agn outburst. the most plausible modelof the nml is that it is a bubble from a previous outburst that is beingre-energized by the current outburst. we also report the discovery of a largescale (at least 35 kpc radius) gas halo around cen a.

0904.1112	unmasking the active galactic nucleus in pks j2310-437	pks j2310-437 is an agn with bright x-ray emission relative to its weak radioemission and optical continuum. it is believed that its jet lies far enoughfrom the line of sight that it is not highly relativistically beamed. it thusprovides an extreme test of agn models. we present new observations aimed atrefining the measurement of the source's properties. in optical photometry withthe ntt we measure a central excess with relatively steep spectrum lying abovethe bright elliptical galaxy emission, and we associate the excess wholly or inpart with the agn. a new full-track radio observation with the atca finds thatthe core 8.64ghz emission has varied by about 20 per cent over 38 months, andimproves the mapping of the weak jet. with chandra we measure awell-constrained power-law spectral index for the x-ray core, uncontaminated byextended emission from the cluster environment, with a negligible level ofintrinsic absorption. weak x-ray emission from the resolved radio jet is alsomeasured. our analysis suggests that the optical continuum in this radio galaxyhas varied by at least a factor of four over a timescale of about two years,something that should be testable with further observations. we conclude thatthe most likely explanation for the bright central x-ray emission issynchrotron radiation from high-energy electrons.

0706.4013	a chandra study of the lobe/ism interactions around the inner radio  lobes of centaurus a: constraints on the temperature structure and transport  processes	we present results from deeper {\em chandra} observations of the southwestradio lobe of centaurus a, first described by kraft et al. (2003). we find thatthe sharp x-ray surface brightness discontinuity extends around $\sim$75% ofthe periphery of the radio lobe, and detect significant temperature jumps inthe brightest regions of this discontinuity nearest to the nucleus. thisdemonstrates that this discontinuity is indeed a strong shock which is theresult of an overpressure which has built up in the entire lobe over time.additionally, we demonstrate that if the mean free path for ions to transferenergy and momentum to the electrons behind the shock is as large as thespitzer value, the electron and proton temperatures will not have equilibratedalong the sw boundary of the radio lobe where the shock is strongest. thus theproton temperature of the shocked gas could be considerably larger than theobserved electron temperature, and the total energy of the outburstcorrespondingly larger as well. we investigate this using a simpleone-dimensional shock model for a two-fluid (proton/electron) plasma. we findthat for the thermodynamic parameters of the cen a shock the electrontemperature rises rapidly from $\sim$0.29 kev (the temperature of the ambientism) to $\sim$3.5 kev at which point heating from the protons is balanced byadiabatic losses. the proton and electron temperatures do not equilibrate in atimescale less than the age of the lobe. we note that the measured electrontemperature of similar features in other nearby powerful radio galaxies in poorenvironments may considerably underestimate the strength and velocity of theshock.

0906.5364	luminosity functions of lmxbs in centaurus a: globular clusters versus  the field	we study the x-ray luminosity function (xlf) of low mass x-ray binaries(lmxb) in the nearby early-type galaxy centaurus a, concentrating primarily ontwo aspects of binary populations: the xlf behavior at the low luminosity limitand comparison between globular cluster and field sources. the 800 ksecexposure of the deep chandra vlp program allows us to reach a limitingluminosity of 8e35 erg/s, about 2-3 times deeper than previous investigations.we confirm the presence of the low luminosity break in the overall lmxb xlf atlog(l_x)=37.2-37.6 below which the luminosity distribution follows a constantdn/d(ln l). separating globular cluster and field sources, we find astatistically significant difference between the two luminosity distributionswith a relative underabundance of faint sources in the globular clusterpopulation. this demonstrates that the samples are drawn from distinct parentpopulations and may disprove the hypothesis that the entire lmxb population inearly type galaxies is created dynamically in globular clusters. as a plausibleexplanation for this difference in the xlfs, we suggest that there is anenhanced fraction of helium accreting systems in globular clusters, which arecreated in collisions between red giants and neutron stars. due to the 4 timeshigher ionization temperature of he, such systems are subject to accretion diskinstabilities at approximately 20 times higher mass accretion rate, andtherefore are not observed as persistent sources at low luminosities.

0910.3782	kinematics of the parsec-scale radio jet in 3c48	we present results on the compact steep-spectrum quasar 3c 48 fromobservations with the vlba, merlin and evn at multiple radio frequencies. inthe 1.5-ghz vlbi images, the radio jet is characterized by a series of brightknots. the active nucleus is embedded in the southernmost vlbi component a,which is further resolved into two sub-components a1 and a2 at 4.8 and 8.3 ghz.a1 shows a flat spectrum and a2 shows a steep spectrum. the most stronglypolarized vlbi components are located at component c $\sim$0.25 arcsec north ofthe core. the polarization angles at c show gradual changes across the jetwidth at all observed frequencies, indicative of a gradient in theemission-weighted intrinsic polarization angle across the jet and possibly asystematic gradient in the rotation measure; moreover, the percentage ofpolarization increases near the curvature at c, likely consistent with thepresence of a local jet-ism interaction and/or changing magnetic-fielddirections. the hot spot b shows a higher rotation measure, and has no detectedproper motion. these facts provide some evidence for a stationary shock in thevicinity of b. comparison of the present vlbi observations with those made 8.43years ago suggests a proper motion of $\beta_{app}=3.7\pm0.4 c$ for a2 to thenorth. the apparent superluminal motion suggests that the relativistic jetplasma moves at a velocity of $\gtrsim0.96 c$ if the jet is viewed at aninclination angle less than $20\degr$. a simple precessing jet model and ahydrodynamical isothermal jet model with helical-mode kelvin-helmholtzinstabilities are used to fit the oscillatory jet trajectory of 3c 48 definedby the bright knots.

0911.2115	long term monitoring of the dynamics and particle acceleration of knots  in the jet of centaurus a	we present new and archival multi-frequency radio and x-ray data forcentaurus a obtained over almost 20 years at the vla and with chandra, withwhich we measure the x-ray and radio spectral indices of jet knots, fluxdensity variations in the jet knots, polarization variations, and propermotions. we compare the observed properties with current knot formation modelsand particle acceleration mechanisms. we rule out impulsive particleacceleration as a formation mechanism for all of the knots as we detect thesame population of knots in all of the observations and we find no evidence ofextreme variability in the x-ray knots. we find the most likely mechanism forall the stationary knots is a collision resulting in a local shock followed bya steady state of prolonged, stable particle acceleration and x-ray synchrotronemission. in this scenario, the x-ray-only knots have radio counterparts thatare too faint to be detected, while the radio-only knots are due to weak shockswhere no particles are accelerated to x-ray emitting energies. although thebase knots are prime candidates for reconfinement shocks, the presence of amoving knot in this vicinity and the fact that there are two base knots arehard to explain in this model. we detect apparent motion in three knots;however, their velocities and locations provide no conclusive evidence for oragainst a faster moving `spine' within the jet. the radio-only knots, bothstationary and moving, may be due to compression of the fluid.

1006.1649	the jet and counterjet of 3c 270 (ngc 4261) viewed in the x-ray with  chandra	the radio source 3c 270, hosted by ngc 4261, is the brightest known exampleof counterjet x-ray emission from a low-power radio galaxy. we report on thex-ray emission of the jet and counterjet from 130 ks of chandra data. we arguethat the x-ray emission is synchrotron radiation and that the internalproperties of the jet and counterjet are remarkably similar. we find a smoothconnection in x-ray hardness and x-ray to radio ratio between the jet and oneof the x-ray components within the core spectrum. we observe wedge-likedepressions in diffuse x-ray surface brightness surrounding the jets, andinterpret them as regions where an aged population of electrons providespressure to balance the interstellar medium of ngc 4261. about 20% of the massof the interstellar medium has been displaced by the radio source. treating 3c270 as a twin-jet system, we find an interesting agreement between the ratio ofjet-to-counterjet length in x-rays and that expected if x-rays are observedover the distance that an outflow from the core would have traveled in ~6x10^4yr. x-ray synchrotron loss times are shorter than this, and we suggest thatmost particle acceleration arises as a result of turbulence and dissipation ina stratified flow. we speculate that an episode of activity in the centralengine beginning ~6x10^4 yr ago has led to an increased velocity shear. thishas enhanced the ability of the jet plasma to accelerate electrons tox-ray-synchrotron-emitting energies, forming the x-ray jet and counterjet thatwe see today.

1306.0850	revealing the heavily obscured agn population of high redshift 3crr  sources with chandra x-ray observations	chandra observations of a complete, flux-limited sample of 38 high-redshift(1&lt;z&lt;2), low-frequency selected (and so unbiased in orientation) 3crr radiosources are reported. the sample includes 21 quasars (= broad line radiogalaxies) and 17 narrow line radio galaxies (nlrgs) with matched 178 mhz radioluminosity (log l_r ~ 44-45). the quasars have high radio core-fraction, highx-ray luminosities (log l_x ~ 45-46) and soft x-ray hardness ratios (hr ~ -0.5)indicating low obscuration. the nlrgs have lower core-fraction, lower apparentx-ray luminosities (log l_x ~ 43-45) and mostly hard x-ray hardness ratios(hr&gt;0) indicating obscuration (log n_h ~ 22-24 cm^-2). these properties and thecorrelation between obscuration and radio core-fraction are consistent withorientation-dependent obscuration as in unification models. about half thenlrgs have soft x-ray hardness ratios and/or high [oiii] emission line to x-rayluminosity ratio suggesting obscuration by compton thick (ct) material so thatscattered nuclear or extended x-ray emission dominates (as in ngc1068). theratios of unobscured to compton-thin (10^{22}&lt; n_h(int) &lt; 1.5 x 10^{24} cm^-2)to ct (n_h(int) &gt; 1.5 x 10^{24} cm^-2) is 2.5:1.4:1 in this high luminosity,radio-selected sample. the obscured fraction is 0.5, higher than is typicallyreported for agn at comparable luminosities from multi-wavelength surveys(0.1-0.3). assuming random nuclear orientation, the unobscured half-openingangle of the disk/wind/torus structure is ~ 60deg and the obscuring materialcovers 30deg of which ~ 12deg is compton thick. the multi-wavelength propertiesreveal that many nlrgs have intrinsic absorption 10-1000x higher than indicatedby their x-ray hardness ratios, and their true l_x values are ~10--100x largerthan the hardness-ratio absorption corrections would indicate.

1306.2323	the hot and energetic universe: agn feedback in galaxy clusters and  groups	mechanical feedback via active galactic nuclei (agn) jets in the centres ofgalaxy groups and clusters is a crucial ingredient in current models of galaxyformation and cluster evolution. jet feedback is believed to regulate gascooling and thus star formation in the most massive galaxies, but a robustphysical understanding of this feedback mode is currently lacking. the largecollecting area, excellent spectral resolution and high spatial resolution ofathena+ will provide the breakthrough diagnostic ability necessary to developthis understanding, via: (1) the first kinematic measurements on relevantspatial scales of the hot gas in galaxy, group and cluster haloes as it absorbsthe impact of agn jets, and (2) vastly improved ability to map thermodynamicconditions on scales well-matched to the jets, lobes and gas disturbancesproduced by them. athena+ will therefore determine for the first time how jetenergy is dissipated and distributed in group and cluster gas, and how afeedback loop operates in group/cluster cores to regulate gas cooling and agnfuelling. athena+ will also establish firmly the cumulative impact of powerfulradio galaxies on the evolution of baryons from the epoch of group/clusterformation to the present day.

1312.5311	sliding not sloshing in abell 3744: the influence of radio galaxies ngc  7018 and 7016 on cluster gas	we present new x-ray (chandra) and radio (jvla) observations of the nearbycluster abell 3744. it hosts two prominent radio galaxies with powers in therange critical for radio-mode feedback. the radio emission from these galaxiesterminates in buoyant tendrils reaching the cluster's outer edge, and theradio-emitting plasma clearly influences the cluster's x-ray-emittingatmosphere. the cluster's average gas temperature, of kt=3.5 kev, is high forits bolometric luminosity of 3.2 \times 10^{43} ergs s^{-1}, but the 100kpc-scale cavity carved out by radio-emitting plasma shows evidence of lessthan 2 per cent of the excess enthalpy. we suggest instead that a high-velocityencounter with a galaxy group is responsible for dispersing and increasing theentropy of the gas in this non-cool-core cluster. we see no evidence forshocks, or established isobaric gas motions (sloshing), but there is muchsub-structure associated with a dynamically active central region thatencompasses the brightest radio emission. gas heating is evident in directionsperpendicular to the inferred line of encounter between the infalling group andcluster. the radio-emitting tendrils run along boundaries between gas ofdifferent temperature, apparently lubricating the gas flows and inhibiting heattransfer. the first stages of the encounter may have helped trigger the radiogalaxies into their current phase of activity, where we see x-rays from thenuclei, jets, and hotspots.

0802.4297	an xmm-newton study of the environments, particle content and impact of  low-power radio galaxies	we present a detailed study of the environments of a sample of nine low-powerradio galaxies, based on new and archival xmm-newton observations. we reportnew detections of group-scale environments around three radio galaxies, 3c 296,ngc 1044 and 3c 76.1. as with previous studies, we find that fr-i radiogalaxies inhabit group environments ranging over nearly two orders of magnitudein bolometric x-ray luminosity, but find no evidence for a tight relationshipbetween large-scale x-ray environment and radio-source properties such as size,radio luminosity, and axial ratio. we confirm earlier work showing thatequipartition internal pressures are typically lower than the externalpressures acting on the radio lobes, so that additional non-radiating particlesmust be present or the lobes must be magnetically dominated. we present thefirst direct observational evidence that entrainment may provide this missingpressure, in the form of a relationship between radio-source structure andapparent pressure imbalance. finally, our study provides further support forthe presence of an apparent temperature excess in radio-loud groups compared tothe group population as a whole. for five of eight temperature excesses, theenergy required to inflate the radio lobes is comparable to the energy requiredto produce this excess by heating of the group gas; however, in three cases thecurrent radio source appears too weak to produce the temperature excess. itremains unclear whether the temperature excess can be directly associated withthe current phase of agn activity, or whether it is instead either a signatureof previous agn activity or simply an indicator of the particular set of groupproperties most conducive to the growth of an fr-i radio galaxy.

0803.3595	evidence for non-hydrostatic gas motions in the hot ism of centaurus a	we present preliminary results from a deep (600 ks) {\em chandra} observationof the hot interstellar medium of the nearby early-type galaxy centaurus a (cena). we find a surface brightness discontinuity in the gas $\sim$3.5 kpc fromthe nucleus spanning a 120$^\circ$ arc. the temperature of the gas is0.60$\pm$0.05 and 0.68$\pm$0.10 kev, interior and exterior to thediscontinuity, respectively. the elemental abundance is poorly constrained bythe spectral fits, but if the abundance is constant across the discontinuity,there is a factor of 2.3$\pm$0.4 pressure jump across the discontinuity. thiswould imply that the gas is moving at 470$\pm$100 km s$^{-1}$, or mach1.0$\pm$0.2 (1.2$\pm$0.2) relative to the sound speed of the gas external(internal) to the discontinuity. alternatively, pressure balance could bemaintained if there is a large (factor of $\sim$7) discontinuity in theelemental abundance. we suggest that the observed discontinuity is the resultof non-hydrostatic motion of the gas core (i.e. sloshing) due to the recentmerger. in this situation, both gas motions and abundance gradients areimportant in the visibility of the discontinuity. cen a is in the late stagesof merging with a small late-type galaxy, and a large discontinuity in densityand abundance across a short distance demonstrates that the gas of the twogalaxies remains poorly mixed even several hundred million years after themerger. the pressure discontinuity may have had a profound influence on thetemporal evolution of the kpc-scale jet. the jet could have decollimatedcrossing the discontinuity and thereby forming the northeast radio lobe.

1510.08392	deep chandra observations of pictor a	we report on deep chandra observations of the nearby broad-line radio galaxypictor a, which we combine with new australia telescope compact array (atca)observations. the new x-ray data have a factor 4 more exposure thanobservations previously presented and span a 15-year time baseline, allowing adetailed study of the spatial, temporal and spectral properties of the agn,jet, hotspot and lobes. we present evidence for further time variation of thejet, though the flare that we reported in previous work remains the mostsignificantly detected time-varying feature. we also confirm previous tentativeevidence for a faint counterjet. based on the radio through x-ray spectrum ofthe jet and its detailed spatial structure, and on the properties of thecounterjet, we argue that inverse-compton models can be conclusively rejected,and propose that the x-ray emission from the jet is synchrotron emission fromparticles accelerated in the boundary layer of a relativistic jet. for thefirst time, we find evidence that the bright western hotspot is alsotime-varying in x-rays, and we connect this to the small-scale structure in thehotspot seen in high-resolution radio observations. the new data allow us toconfirm that the spectrum of the lobes is in good agreement with thepredictions of an inverse-compton model and we show that the data favour modelsin which the filaments seen in the radio images are predominantly the result ofspatial variation of magnetic fields in the presence of a relatively uniformelectron distribution.

astro-ph;0005227	the chandra x-ray observatory resolves the x-ray morphology and spectra  of a jet in pks 0637-752	the core-dominated radio-loud quasar pks 0637-752 (z = 0.654) was the firstcelestial object observed with the chandra x-ray observatory, offering theearly surprise of the detection of a remarkable x-ray jet. several observationswith a variety of detector configurations contribute to a total exposure timewith the chandra advanced ccd imaging spectrometer (acis; garmire et al. 2000,in preparation) of about 100ks. a spatial analysis of all the available x-raydata, making use of chandra's spatial resolving power of about 0.4 arcsec,reveals a jet that extends about 10 arcsec to the west of the nucleus. at leastfour x-ray knots are resolved along the jet, which contains about 5% of theoverall x-ray luminosity of the source. previous observations of pks 0637-752in the radio band (tingay et al. 1998) had identified a kpc-scale radio jetextending to the west of the quasar. the x-ray and radio jets are similar inshape, intensity distribution, and angular structure out to about 9 arcsec,after which the x-ray brightness decreases more rapidly and the radio jet turnsabruptly to the north. the x-ray luminosity of the total source is log lx ~45.8 erg/s (2 - 10kev), and appears not to have changed since it was observedwith asca in november 1996. we present the results of fitting a variety ofemission models to the observed spectral distribution, comment on thenon-existence of emission lines recently reported in the asca observations ofpks 0637-752, and briefly discuss plausible x-ray emission mechanisms.

astro-ph;0005255	chandra discovery of a 100 kpc x-ray jet in pks 0637--752	the quasar pks 0637-753, the first celestial x-ray target of the chandrax-ray observatory, has revealed asymmetric x-ray structure extending from 3 to12 arcsec west of the quasar, coincident with the inner portion of the jetpreviously detected in a 4.8 ghz radio image (tingay et al. 1998). at aredshift of z=0.651, the jet is the largest (~100 kpc) and most luminous(~10^{44.6} ergs/s) of the few so far detected in x-rays. this letter presentsa high resolution x-ray image of the jet, from 42 ks of data when pks 0637-753was on-axis and acis-s was near the optimum focus. for the inner portion of theradio jet, the x-ray morphology closely matches that of new atca radio imagesat 4.8 and 8.6 ghz. observations of the parsec scale core using the vsop spacevlbi mission show structure aligned with the x-ray jet, placing importantconstraints on the x-ray source models. hst images show that there are threesmall knots coincident with the peak radio and x-ray emission. two of these areresolved, which we use to estimate the sizes of the x-ray and radio knots. theouter portion of the radio jet, and a radio component to the east, show nox-ray emission to a limit of about 100 times lower flux.  the x-ray emission is difficult to explain with models that successfullyaccount for extra-nuclear x-ray/radio structures in other active galaxies. wethink the most plausible is a synchrotron self-compton (ssc) model, but thiswould imply extreme departures from the conventional minimum-energy and/orhomogeneity assumptions. we also rule out synchrotron or thermal bremsstrahlungmodels for the jet x-rays, unless multicomponent or ad hoc geometries areinvoked.

astro-ph;0105194	chandra measurements of 3c 220.1's x-ray core and cluster	we report results of an 18 ks exposure with the acis instrument on chandra ofthe powerful z = 0.62 radio galaxy 3c 220.1. the x-ray emission separates intocluster gas of emission-weighted kt ~ 5 kev and 0.7-12 kev luminosity (to aradius of 45 arcsec) 5.6 x 10^44 ergs s^-1, and unresolved emission (coincidentwith the radio core). while the extended x-ray emission is clearly thermal innature, a straightforward cooling-flow model, even in conjunction with apoint-source component, is a poor fit to the radial profile of the x-rayemission. this is despite the fact that the measured properties of the gassuggest a massive cooling flow of ~ 130 m_\odot yr^-1, and the data show weakevidence for a temperature gradient. the central unresolved x-ray emission hasa power-law spectral energy index \alpha ~ 0.7 and 0.7-12 kev luminosity 10^45ergs s^-1, and any intrinsic absorption is relatively small. the two-pointspectrum of the core emission between radio and x-ray energies has \alpha_rx =0.75. since this is a flatter spectrum than seen in other sources where thex-ray emission is presumed to be radio-related, regions close to the agn inthis source may dominate the central x-ray output, as is believed to be thecase for lobe-dominated quasars. simple unification models would be challengedif this were found to be the case for a large fraction of high-power radiogalaxies.

astro-ph;0106029	chandra observations of the x-ray jet in 3c66b	our chandra observation of the fri radio galaxy 3c66b has resulted in thefirst detection of an x-ray counterpart to the previously known radio,infra-red and optical jet. the x-ray jet is detected up to 7 arcsec from thecore and has a steep x-ray spectrum, alpha ~ 1.3 +/- 0.1. the overall x-rayflux density and spectrum of the jet are consistent with a synchrotron originfor the x-ray emission. however, the inner knot in the jet has a higher ratioof x-ray to radio emission than the others. this suggests that either twodistinct emission processes are present or that differences in the accelerationmechanism are required; there may be a contribution to the inner knot'semission from an inverse-compton process or it may be the site of an earlystrong shock in the jet. the peak of the brightest radio and x-ray knot issignificantly closer to the nucleus in the x-ray than in the radio, which maysuggest that the knots are privileged sites for high-energy particleacceleration. 3c66b's jet is similar both in overall spectral shape and instructural detail to those in more nearby sources such as m87 and centaurus a.

astro-ph;0111340	chandra observations of the x-ray jet in centaurus a	we present high angular resolution x-ray images and spectra from two {\emchandra} acis-i observations of the x-ray jet in the nearby radio galaxycentaurus a. we find that the x-ray emission from the jet is composed of a lowsurface brightness diffuse component extending continuously from within atleast 60 pc of the active nucleus into the ne radio lobe 4 kpc from thenucleus, along with 31 discrete compact knots, most of which are extended atthe resolution of our observation. we find that there are small but significantdifferences between the x-ray and radio morphologies of the inner jet at thearcsecond level, making it unlikely that a single, spatially coincidentpopulation of ultrarelativistic electrons is responsible for the emission inboth energy regimes. we suggest that the x-ray knots of the inner jet areindeed the sites of particle acceleration and shocks, and the x-ray and radioknot offsets are caused by a combination of particle diffusion and energy loss.these offsets may be a common feature of all jets in radio galaxies, or atleast jets in fr i type galaxies, and may be fundamental to the physics of suchjets. the x-ray spectra of several regions of the jet are well fit by absorbedpower-law models with photon indices $\sim$2.2-2.5, although the spectrum ofone bright knot located $\sim$1 kpc from the nucleus (knot b) is harder (photonindex = 2.0).

astro-ph;0203374	a chandra observation of the x-ray environment and jet of 3c31	we have used a deep chandra observation of the central regions of thetwin-jet fri radio galaxy 3c31 to resolve the thermal x-ray emission in thecentral few kiloparsecs of the host galaxy, ngc 383, where the jets are thoughtto be decelerating rapidly. this allows us to make high-precision measurementsof the density, temperature and pressure distributions in this region, and toshow that the x-ray emitting gas in the centre of the galaxy has a cooling timeof only 5 times 10^7 years. in a companion paper these measurements are used toplace constraints on models of the jet dynamics.  a previously unknown one-sided x-ray jet in 3c31, extending up to 8 arcsecfrom the nucleus, is detected and resolved. its structure and steep x-rayspectrum are similar to those of x-ray jets known in other fri sources, and weattribute the radiation to synchrotron emission from a high-energy populationof electrons. in situ particle acceleration is required in the region of thejet where bulk deceleration is taking place.  we also present x-ray spectra and luminosities of the galaxies in the arp 331chain of which ngc 383 is a member. the spectrum and spatial properties of thenearby bright x-ray source 1e 0104+3153 are used to argue that the soft x-rayemission is mostly due to a foreground group of galaxies rather than to thebackground broad absorption-line quasar.

astro-ph;0208204	magnetic field strengths in the hotspots and lobes of three powerful  frii radio sources	we have made deep chandra observations of three powerful frii radio sources:two quasars (3c263 and 3c351) and one radio galaxy (3c330). x-ray emission fromhotspots and lobes, as well as from the active nucleus, is detected in eachsource.  we model the hotspots' synchrotron spectra using vla, bima and hst data. in3c263 and 3c330, the hotspots' x-ray emission is at a level consistent withbeing synchrotron self-compton (ssc) emission, with a hotspot magnetic fieldclose to the equipartition value. in the two hotspots of 3c351, however, an sscorigin for the x-rays would require the magnetic field strength to be an orderof magnitude below the equipartition value in our models: in addition, thereare offsets between the radio, optical and x-ray emission from the secondaryhotspot which are hard to explain in a simple ssc model. we discuss theemission mechanisms that may be responsible for these observations.  on our preferred model, the x-ray emission from the radio lobes of the threesources is due to inverse-compton scattering of the microwave backgroundradiation. if this is the case, the magnetic field strengths in the lobes aretypically about a factor 2 below the equipartition values, assuming uniformlobe electron and magnetic field distributions.  we detect extended x-ray emission, which we attribute to a cluster/groupenvironment, around 3c263 and 3c330. this detection allows us to show that thelobes are close to pressure balance with their surroundings, as long as nonon-radiating particles contribute to the internal pressure of the lobes.

astro-ph;0209099	unifying b2 radio galaxies with bl lac objects	in an earlier paper we presented nuclear x-ray flux densities, measured withrosat, for the b2 bright sample of nearby low-luminosity radio galaxies. inthis paper we construct a nuclear x-ray luminosity function for the b2 radiogalaxies, and discuss the consequences of our results for models in which suchradio galaxies are the parent population of bl lac objects. based on ourobservations of the b2 sample, we use monte carlo techniques to simulatesamples of beamed radio galaxies, and use the selection criteria of existingsamples of bl lac objects to compare our simulated results to what is observed.we find that previous analytical results are not applicable since the bl lacsamples are selected on beamed flux density. a simple model in which bl lacsare the moderately beamed (gamma ~ 3) counterparts of radio galaxies, with somerandom dispersion (~ 0.4 decades) in the intrinsic radio-x-ray relationship,can reproduce many of the features of the radio-selected and x-ray-selected bllac samples, including their radio and x-ray luminosity functions and thedistributions of their radio-to-x-ray spectral indices. in contrast, models inwhich the x-ray and radio emission have systematically different beamingparameters cannot reproduce important features of the radio-galaxy and bl lacpopulations. the redshift distribution and number counts of the x-ray-selectedemss sample are well reproduced by our best models, supporting a picture inwhich these objects are beamed fri radio galaxies with intrinsic luminositiessimilar to those of the b2 sample. however, we cannot match the redshiftdistribution of the radio-selected 1-jy sample, and it is likely that apopulation of frii radio galaxies is responsible for the high-redshift objectsin this sample.

astro-ph;0304363	x-ray emission from the hot ism and sw radio lobe of the nearby radio  galaxy centaurus a	we present results from two {\em chandra}/acis-i observations and one {\emxmm-newton} observation of x-ray emission from the ism and the inner radiolobes of the nearby radio galaxy centaurus a. the ism has an average radialsurface brightness profile that is well described by a $\beta$-model profilewith index $\beta$=0.40$\pm$0.04 and a temperature of $k_bt_{ism}\sim$0.29 kevbeyond 2 kpc from the nucleus. we find that diffuse x-ray emission iscoincident with the outer half of the southwest radio lobe, and a bright x-rayenhancement is detected along the edge of the lobe. on the basis of energeticand lifetime arguments, we reject a nonthermal explanation for this emission.we model this emission as a thin, hot shell or cap of x-ray emitting plasmasurrounding the radio lobe that was created by the supersonic inflation of thelobe. this plasma shell is both hotter than ($k_bt_{sh}\sim$2.9 kev) andgreatly overpressurized relative to the ambient ism indicating supersonicexpansion. we estimate that the lobe is expanding into the ism at approximatelymach 8.5 or 2400 km s$^{-1}$. we are not directly observing the bow shock, butrather the cooler, denser material that is accumulating ahead of the contactdiscontinuity. the thermal energy in the shell is a significant fraction of thethermal energy of the hot ism, demonstrating the possibility that the hot ismof early galaxies can be re-energized by outflows from nuclear activity.interestingly, no similarly bright x-ray emission is detected in or along theedge of the ne lobe, implying that there are differences in the dynamics andevolution of the kpc-scale radio components.

astro-ph;0304443	radio and x-ray observations of the jet in centaurus a	we present new, high dynamic range vla images of the inner jet of the closestradio galaxy, centaurus a. over a ten-year baseline we detect apparentsub-luminal motions (v ~ 0.5c) in the jet on scales of hundreds of pc. theinferred speeds are larger than those previously determined using vlbi onsmaller scales, and provide new constraints on the angle made by the jet to theline of sight if we assume jet-counterjet symmetry. the new images also allowus to detect faint radio counterparts to a number of previously unidentifiedx-ray knots in the inner part of the jet and counterjet, showing conclusivelythat these x-ray features are genuinely associated with the outflow. however,we find that the knots with the highest x-ray to radio flux density ratios donot have detectable proper motions, suggesting that they may be related tostanding shocks in the jet; we consider some possible internal obstacles thatthe jet may encounter. using new, high-resolution chandra data, we discuss theradio to x-ray spectra of the jet and the discrete features that it contains,and argue that the compact radio and x-ray knots are privileged sites for thein situ particle acceleration that must be taking place throughout the jet. weshow that the offsets observed between the peaks of the radio and x-rayemission at several places in the cen a jet are not compatible with thesimplest possible models involving particle acceleration and downstreamadvection together with synchrotron and expansion losses.

astro-ph;0309150	xmm-newton observations of the hot-gas atmospheres of 3c 66b and 3c 449	we present new xmm-newton observations of the hot-gas environments of twolow-power twin-jet radio galaxies, 3c 66b and 3c 449, showing direct evidencefor the interactions between x-ray-emitting gas and radio plasma that arethought to determine the large-scale radio structure of these sources. thetemperatures that we measure for the two environments are significantly higherthan those predicted by standard luminosity-temperature relations for clustersand groups. we show that luminosity-temperature relations for radio-quiet andradio-loud x-ray groups differ, in the sense that radio-source heating mayoperate in most groups containing radio galaxies. if the radio lobes areexpanding subsonically, we find minimum ages of 3e8 years for 3c 66b, and 5e8years for 3c 449, older than the values obtained from spectral ageing, whichwould give the radio source sufficient time to heat the groups to the observedtemperatures for plausible values of the jet power. the external pressures inthe atmospheres of both radio galaxies are an order of magnitude higher thanequipartition estimates of their radio-lobe pressures, confirming that theradio lobes are either out of equipartition or require a pressure contributionfrom non-radiating particles. constraints from the level of x-ray emission wemeasure from the radio lobes allow us to conclude that a departure fromequipartition must be in the direction of magnetic domination, and that themost plausible candidates for a particle contribution to lobe pressure arerelativistic protons, an additional population of low-energy electrons, orentrained and heated thermal material.

astro-ph;0309737	the relationship between the x-ray and radio components in the compact  steep spectrum quasar 3c 48	we combine results from rosat, chandra, and multifrequency vlba observationsof the compact steep spectrum quasar 3c 48. we infer that the x-ray spectrum ofthe nucleus is made up of a soft, variable, steep-spectrum component, andharder, power-law emission of slope consistent with the 1 ghz radio spectrum.the similarity of 3c 48's x-ray to radio ratio to that seen in core-dominatedradio-loud quasars leads us to examine the possibility that the harder x-rayemission is inverse compton radiation from the radio source, which is more than99% resolved in our vlba data. the weak (3 sigma) evidence that we find for aproper motion of 0.5\pm0.2c in a compact radio component about 0.05 arcsec fromthe core implies that if this component has a highly relativistic bulk motion,it is at a very small angle to the line of sight. however, stringentrequirements on the jet opening angle make it unlikely that all the x-rayemission is from a fast jet which sees boosted cosmic microwave backgroundemission and emits beamed x-rays in the observer's frame. if the unusual radiostructures are intrinsically one-sided and unbeamed, the inverse comptonmechanism can provide an appreciable fraction of the x-ray emission if themagnetic field strength is a factor of six to ten below that which gives equalenergy in radiating relativistic particles and magnetic fields and roughlyminimizes the total energy in the source. it remains possible that theunresolved x-ray emission arises from close to the central engine, either as anembedded blazar or associated with the accretion processes.

astro-ph;0501031	a chandra study of the multi-component x-ray emission from the x-shaped  radio galaxy 3c 403	we present results from a 49.4 ks chandra/acis-s observation of the nearby($z$=0.059) x-shaped frii radio galaxy 3c~403. this is the first chandraobservation of an x-shaped radio galaxy, and one of the goals of thispioneering study is to determine the relationship between the x-ray emittinggas and the x-shaped radio morphology. the x-ray isophotes of the hot gaswithin $\sim3.5''$ of the central galaxy are highly elliptical(eccentricity$\sim$0.57) and co-aligned with the elliptical optical isophotes.this supports the hypothesis that x-shaped radio sources are created bypropagation of jets through asymmetric density distributions. within largeuncertainties, there is no evidence that the lobes or wings are overpressurizedrelative to the ism. we have detected x-ray emission from several of the radioknots to the e of the active nucleus, and diffuse emission from the radio lobeto the w. the x-ray emission from the eastern knots cannot be explained by aninverse compton model unless they are far from equipartition. using archivalhst data, optical emission is detected from two knots, and theradio/optical/x-ray spectra are well fitted by simple synchrotron models. thisis one of the strongest examples to date of x-ray synchrotron emission frommultiple knots in the jet of an fr ii radio galaxy. x-ray emission is alsodetected from the radio wings at a flux consistent with inverse comptonscattering of cmb photons from relativistic electrons if the wings are nearequipartition. the nuclear spectrum is well described by a multi-componentmodel that includes a heavily absorbed power law and a bright, broadened feline. a second, less absorbed, power-law component, likely to representunresolved emission from a pc-scale jet, is also required.

astro-ph;0502575	a chandra and xmm-newton study of the wide-angle tail radio galaxy 3c465	we have observed the prototypical wide-angle tail radio galaxy 3c465 withchandra and xmm-newton. x-ray emission is detected from the active nucleus andthe inner radio jet, as well as a small-scale, cool component of thermalemission, a number of the individual galaxies of the host cluster (abell 2634),and the hotter thermal emission from the cluster itself. the x-ray detection ofthe jet allows us to argue that synchrotron emission may be an importantmechanism in other well-collimated, fast jets, including those of classicaldouble radio sources. the bases of the radio plumes are not detected in thex-ray, which supports the model in which these plumes are physically differentfrom the twin jets of lower-power radio galaxies. the plumes are in factspatially coincident with deficits of x-ray emission on large scales, whichargues that they contain little thermal material at the cluster temperature,although the minimum pressures throughout the source are lower than theexternal pressures estimated from the observed thermal emission. ourobservations confirm both spatially and spectrally that a component of dense,cool gas with a short cooling time is associated with the central galaxy.however, there is no evidence for the kind of discontinuity in externalproperties that would be required in many models of the jet-plume transition inwats. although the wat jet-plume transition appears likely to be related to theinterface between this central cool component and the hotter intra-clustermedium, the mechanism for wat formation remains unclear. we revisit thequestion of the bending of wat plumes, and show that the plumes can be bent byplausible bulk motions of the intra-cluster medium, or by motion of the hostgalaxy with respect to the cluster, as long as the plumes are light.

astro-ph;0503203	an x-ray study of magnetic field strengths and particle content in frii  radio sources	we present a chandra and xmm-newton study of x-ray emission from the lobes of33 classical double radio galaxies and quasars. we report new detections oflobe-related x-ray emission in 11 sources. together with previous detections wefind that x-ray emission is detected from at least one radio lobe in ~75percent of the sample. for all of the lobe detections, we find that themeasured x-ray flux can be attributed to inverse-compton scattering of thecosmic microwave background radiation, with magnetic field strengths in thelobes between (0.3 - 1.3) b_eq, where the value b_eq corresponds toequipartition between the electrons and magnetic field assuming a fillingfactor of unity. there is a strong peak in the magnetic field strengthdistribution at b ~ 0.7 b_eq. we find that &gt; 70 percent of the radio lobes areeither at equipartition or electron dominated by a small factor. thedistribution of measured magnetic field strengths differs for narrow-line andbroad-line objects, in the sense that broad-line radio galaxies and quasarsappear to be further from equipartition; however, this is likely to be due to acombination of projection effects and worse systematic uncertainty in the x-rayanalysis for those objects. our results suggest that the lobes of classicaldouble radio sources do not contain an energetically dominant protonpopulation, because this would require the magnetic field energy density to besimilar to the electron energy density rather than the overall energy densityin relativistic particles.

astro-ph;0601632	observations of magnetic fields and relativistic beaming in four quasar  jets	we discuss the physical properties of four quasar jets imaged with thechandra x-ray observatory in the course of a survey for x-ray emission fromradio jets. these objects have sufficient counts to study their spatiallyresolved properties, even in the 5 ks survey observations. we have acquiredaustralia telescope compact array data with resolution matching chandra. wehave searched for optical emission with magellan, with sub-arcsecondresolution. the radio to x-ray spectral energy distribution for most of theindividual regions indicates against synchrotron radiation from asingle-component electron spectrum. we therefore explore the consequences ofassuming that the x-ray emission is the result of inverse compton scattering onthe cosmic microwave background. if particles and magnetic fields are nearminimum energy density in the jet rest frames, then the emitting regions mustbe relativistically beamed, even at distances of order 500 kpc from the quasar.we estimate the magnetic field strengths, relativistic doppler factors, andkinetic energy flux as a function of distance from the quasar core for two orthree distinct regions along each jet. we develop, for the first time,estimates in the uncertainties in these parameters, recognizing that they aredominated by our assumptions in applying the standard synchrotron minimumenergy conditions. the kinetic power is comparable with, or exceeds, the quasarradiative luminosity, implying that the jets are a significant factor in theenergetics of the accretion process powering the central black hole. themeasured radiative efficiencies of the jets are of order 10^(-4).

astro-ph;0606119	optical polarimetry of the jets of nearby radio galaxies: i. the data	we present an overview of new hst imaging polarimetry of six nearby radiogalaxies with optical jets. these observations triple the number ofextragalactic jets with subarcsecond-resolution optical polarimetry. we discussthe polarization characteristics and optical morphology of each jet. we findevidence of high optical polarization, averaging 20%, but reaching upwards of$\sim 50%$ in some objects, confirming that the optical emission issynchrotron, and that the components of the magnetic fields perpendicular tothe line of sight are well ordered. we find a wide range of polarizationmorphologies, with each jet having a somewhat different relationship betweentotal intensity and polarized flux and the polarization position angle. we findtwo trends in all of these jets. first, jet ``edges'' are very often associatedwith high fractional optical polarizations, as also found in earlier radioobservations of these and other radio jets. in these regions, the magneticfield vectors appear to track the jet direction, even at bends, where we seeparticularly high fractional polarizations. this indicates a strong linkbetween the local magnetic field and jet dynamics. second, optical flux maximumregions are usually well separated from maxima in fractional polarization andoften are associated with polarization minima. this trend is not found in radiodata and was found in our optical polarimetry of m87 with hst. however, unlikein m87, we do not find a general trend for near-90$^\circ$ rotations in theoptical polarization vectors near flux maxima. we discuss possibilities forinterpreting these trends, as well as implications for jet dynamics, magneticfield structure and particle acceleration.

astro-ph;0610124	on the environment of powerful radio galaxies at z&gt;0.5	active galaxies are the most powerful engines in the universe for convertinggravitational energy into radiation, and radio galaxies and radio-loud quasarsare highly luminous and can be detected across the universe. the jets thatcharacterise them need a medium to propagate into, and thus radio galaxies athigh redshift point to gaseous atmospheres on scales of at least the radiosource diameter, which in many cases can reach hundreds of kpc. the variationwith redshift of x-ray properties of radio-selected clusters provides animportant test of structure formation theories as, unlike x-ray selection, thisselection is not biased towards the most luminous clusters in the universe. wepresent new results from a sample of 19 luminous radio galaxies at redshiftsbetween 0.5 and 1. the properties of the gaseous atmosphere around thesesources as mapped by chandra and xmm-newton observations are discussed. bycombining these with observations at radio frequency, we will be able to drawconclusions on cluster size, density, and pressure balance between the radiosource and the environment in which it lies.

astro-ph;0611069	the structure of the jet in 3c 15 from multi-band polarimetry	we investigate the structure of the kpc-scale jet in the nearby (z = 0.073)radio galaxy 3c 15, using new optical hubble space telescope (hst) acs/f606wpolarimetry together with archival multi-band hst imaging, chandra x-ray dataand 8.4 ghz vla radio polarimetry. the new data confirm that synchrotronradiation dominates in the optical. with matched beams, the jet is generallynarrower in the optical than in the radio, suggesting a stratified flow. weexamine a simple two-component model comprising a highly relativistic spine andlower-velocity sheath. this configuration is broadly consistent withpolarization angle differences seen in the optical and radio data. the base ofthe jet is relatively brighter in the ultraviolet and x-ray than at lowerenergies, and the radio and optical polarization angles vary significantly asthe jet brightens downstream. further out, the x-ray intensity rises again andthe apparent magnetic field becomes simpler, indicating a strong shock.modelling the synchrotron spectrum of this brightest x-ray knot provides anestimate of its minimum internal pressure, and a comparison with the thermalpressure from x-ray emitting gas shows that the knot is overpressured andlikely to be a temporary, expanding feature.

astro-ph;0701458	a radio through x-ray study of the hot spots, active nucleus, and  environment of the nearby fr ii radio galaxy 3c 33	we present results from {\em chandra}/acis-s, {\em spitzer}, {\emxmm-newton}, {\em hst}, and vla observations of the radio hot spots, extendedenvironment, and nucleus of the nearby ($z$=0.0597) fr ii radio galaxy 3c 33.this is a relatively low-power fr ii radio galaxy, and so we expect, {\it apriori}, to detect a significant x-ray synchrotron component to the emissionfrom the hot spots. we detect x-ray emission coincident with the two knots ofpolarized optical emission from the southern hot spot (shs), as well as alongthe northwest arm of this hot spot. we also detect x-ray emission from twocompact regions of the northern hot spot (nhs), as well as diffuse emissionbehind the radio peak. the x-ray flux density of the region at the tip of thesouthern hot spot, the most compact radio feature of the southern lobe, isconsistent with the synchrotron self-compton (ssc) process. the x-ray fluxdensities of the other three regions of the shs and the two compact regions ofthe nhs are an order of magnitude or more above the predictions from either thessc and inverse-compton scattering of the cmb (ic/cmb) mechanisms, thusstrongly disfavoring these scenarios unless they are far from equipartition($b$ $\sim$4-14 times smaller than the equipartition values). the x-ray fluxfrom the diffuse region behind the nhs is consistent with the ic/cmb predictionassuming a small departure from equipartition. we conclude that the x-rayemission is synchrotron emission from multiple populations of ultrarelativisticelectrons unless these regions are far from equipartition. there must thereforebe unresolved substructure within each knot, similar to that which is found inchandra observations of nearby fr i jets such as centaurus a and 3c 66b.

astro-ph;0702411	the effect of a chandra-measured merger-related gas component on the  lobes of a dead radio galaxy	we use chandra data to infer that an x-ray bright component of gas is in theprocess of separating the radio lobes of 3c 442a. this is the first radiogalaxy with convincing evidence that central gas, overpressured with respect tothe lobe plasma and not simply a static atmosphere, is having a major dynamicaleffect on the radio structure. we speculate that the expansion of the gas alsore-excites electrons in the lobes of 3c 442a through compression and adiabaticheating. two features of 3c 442a contribute to its dynamical state. firstly,the radio source is no longer being powered by a detected active jet, so thatthe dynamical state of the radio plasma is at the mercy of the ambient medium.secondly the two early-type galaxies, ngc 7236 and ngc 7237, one of which wasthe original host of 3c 442a, are undergoing a merger and have alreadyexperienced a close encounter, suggesting that the x-ray bright gas is mostlythe heated combined galaxy atmospheres. the lobes have been swept apart forabout 10^8 yrs by the pressure-driven expansion of the x-ray bright inner gas.

astro-ph;0703080	the interaction between radio lobes and hot gas in the nearby radio  galaxies 3c285 and 3c442a	we present chandra observations of two nearby radio galaxies in groupenvironments, 3c285 and 3c442a. the host galaxies of both sources are involvedin mergers with nearby massive galaxies, and the hot gas in the systems isextended along lines joining the interacting galaxies. both sources show strongevidence for interactions between the radio lobes and the asymmetrical hot gas.we argue that the structure in the hot gas is independent of the existence ofthe radio lobes in these systems, and argue that hot gas shaped by an ongoingmassive galaxy merger may play an important role in the dynamics of radio lobesin other objects. for 3c442a, our observations show that gas is being drivenout of both members of the host interacting galaxy pair, and the impliedconstraints on galaxy velocities are consistent with mildly supersonic motionswith respect to the group-scale hot gas. the previously known filamentary radiostructure in the center of 3c442a may be a result of the interaction betweenhot gas expelled from these galaxies and pre-existing radio-emitting plasma. in3c285, where there is no ongoing galaxy merger, the powerful radio source isprobably having a significant effect on the energetics of the host group.

astro-ph;9910141	x-ray-emitting atmospheres of b2 radio galaxies	we report rosat pspc spatial and spectral analysis of the eight b2 radiogalaxies ngc 315, ngc 326, 4c 35.03, b2 0326+39, ngc 2484, b2 1040+31, b21855+37, and 3c 449, expected to be representative of the class of low-powerradio galaxies. multiple x-ray components are present in each, and the gascomponents have a wide range of linear sizes and follow an extrapolation of thecluster x-ray luminosity/temperature correlation, implying that there is norelationship between the presence of a radio galaxy and the gas fraction of theenvironment. no large-scale cooling flows are found. there is no correlation ofradio-galaxy size with the scale or density of the x-ray atmosphere. thissuggests that it is processes on scales less than those of the overall gaseousenvironments which are the major influence on radio-source dynamics. theintergalactic medium is usually sufficient to confine the outer parts of theradio structures, in some cases even to within 5 kpc of the core. in the caseof ngc 315, an extrapolation suggests that the pressure of the atmosphere maymatch the minimum pressure in the radio source over a factor of about 40 inlinear size (a factor of about 1600 in pressure).
