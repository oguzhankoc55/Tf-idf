0903.0622	bayesclumpy: bayesian inference with clumpy dusty torus models	our aim is to present a fast and general bayesian inference framework basedon the synergy between machine learning techniques and standard samplingmethods and apply it to infer the physical properties of clumpy dusty torususing infrared photometric high spatial resolution observations of activegalactic nuclei. we make use of the metropolis-hastings markov chain montecarlo algorithm for sampling the posterior distribution function. suchdistribution results from combining all a-priori knowledge about the parametersof the model and the information introduced by the observations. the maindifficulty resides in the fact that the model used to explain the observationsis computationally demanding and the sampling is very time consuming. for thisreason, we apply a set of artificial neural networks that are used toapproximate and interpolate a database of models. as a consequence, models notpresent in the original database can be computed ensuring continuity. we focuson the application of this solution scheme to the recently developed publicdatabase of clumpy dusty torus models. the machine learning scheme used in thispaper allows us to generate any model from the database using only a factor10^-4 of the original size of the database and a factor 10^-3 in computingtime. the posterior distribution obtained for each model parameter allows us toinvestigate how the observations constrain the parameters and which ones remainpartially or completely undetermined, providing statistically relevantconfidence intervals. as an example, the application to the nuclear region ofcentaurus a shows that the optical depth of the clouds, the total number ofclouds and the radial extent of the cloud distribution zone are wellconstrained using only 6 filters.

0706.2590	extreme value theory and the solar cycle	we investigate the statistical properties of the extreme events of the solarcycle as measured by the sunspot number. the recent advances in the methodologyof the theory of extreme values is applied to the maximal extremes of the timeseries of sunspots. we focus on the extreme events that exceed a carefullychosen threshold and a generalized pareto distribution is fitted to the tail ofthe empirical cumulative distribution. a maximum likelihood method is used toestimate the parameters of the generalized pareto distribution and confidencelevels are also given to the parameters. due to the lack of an automaticprocedure for selecting the threshold, we analyze the sensitivity of the fittedgeneralized pareto distribution to the exact value of the threshold. accordingto the available data, that only spans the previous ~250 years, the cumulativedistribution of the time series is bounded, yielding an upper limit of 324 forthe sunspot number. we also estimate that the return value for each solar cycleis ~188, while the return value for a century increases to ~228. finally, theresults also indicate that the most probable return time for a large event likethe maximum at solar cycle 19 happens once every ~700 years and that theprobability of finding such a large event with a frequency smaller than ~50years is very small. in spite of the essentially extrapolative character ofthese results, their statistical significance is very large.

0906.4226	multiline zeeman signatures through line addition	in order to get a significant zeeman signature in the polarised spectra of amagnetic star, we usually 'add' the contributions of numerous spectral lines;the ultimate goal is to recover the spectropolarimetric prints of the magneticfield in these line additions. here we want to clarify the meaning of thesetechniques of line addition; in particular, we try to interpret the meaning ofthe 'pseudo-line' formed during this process and to find out why and how itszeeman signature is still meaningful. we create a synthetic case of lineaddition and apply well tested standard solar methods routinely used in theresearch on magnetism in our nearest star. the results are convincing and thezeeman signatures well detected; solar methods are found to be quite efficientalso for stellar observations. we statistically compare line addition withleast-squares deconvolution and demonstrate that they both give very similarresults as a consequence of the special statistical properties of the weights.the zeeman signatures are unequivocally detected in this multiline approach. wemay anticipate the outcome that magnetic field detection is reliable wellbeyond the weak-field approximation. linear polarisation in the spectra ofsolar type stars can be detected when the spectral resolution is sufficientlyhigh.

0906.4230	evidence for quasi-isotropic magnetic fields from hinode quiet sun  observations	some recent investigations of spectropolarimetric observations of the zeemaneffect in the fe i lines at 630 nm carried out with the hinode solar spacetelescope have concluded that the strength of the magnetic field vector in theinternetwork regions of the quiet sun is in the hg regime and that itsinclination is predominantly horizontal. we critically reconsider the analysisof such observations and carry out a complete bayesian analysis with the aim ofextracting as much information as possible from them, including error bars. weapply the recently developed bayesme code that carries out a complete bayesianinference for milne-eddington atmospheres. the sampling of the posteriordistribution function is obtained with a markov chain monte carlo scheme andthe marginal distributions are analyzed in detail. the kullback-leiblerdivergence is used to study the extent to which the observations introduce newinformation in the inference process resulting in sufficiently constrainedparameters. our analysis clearly shows that only upper limits to the magneticfield strength can be inferred with fields in the kg regime completelydiscarded. furthermore, the noise level present in the analyzed hinodeobservations induces a substantial loss of information for constraining theazimuth of the magnetic field. concerning the inclination of the field, wedemonstrate that some information is available to constrain it for those pixelswith the largest polarimetric signal. the results also point out that the fieldin pixels with small polarimetric signals can be nicely reproduced in terms ofa quasi-isotropic distribution.

1003.1255	small magnetic loops connecting the quiet surface and the hot outer  atmosphere of the sun	sunspots are the most spectacular manifestation of solar magnetism, yet, 99%of the solar surface remains 'quiet' at any time of the solar cycle. the quietsun is not void of magnetic fields, though; they are organized at smallerspatial scales and evolve relatively fast, which makes them difficult todetect. thus, although extensive quiet sun magnetism would be a natural driverto a uniform, steady heating of the outer solar atmosphere, it is not clearwhat the physical processes involved would be due to lack of observationalevidence. we report the topology and dynamics of the magnetic field in veryquiet regions of the sun from spectropolarimetric observations of the hinodesatellite, showing a continuous injection of magnetic flux with a wellorganized topology of omega-loop from below the solar surface into the upperlayers. at first stages, when the loop travels across the photosphere, it has aflattened (staple-like) geometry and a mean velocity ascent of $\sim3$ km/s.when the loop crosses the minimum temperature region, the magnetic fields atthe footpoints become almost vertical and the loop topology ressembles apotential field. the mean ascent velocity at chromospheric height is $\sim12$km/s. the energy input rate of these small-scale loops in the lower boundary ofthe chromosphere is (at least) of 1.4x10^6-2.2x10^7 erg cm-2 s-1. our findingsprovide empirical evidence for solar magnetism as a multi-scale system, inwhich small-scale low-flux magnetism plays a crucial role, at least asimportant as active regions, coupling different layers of the solar atmosphereand being an important ingredient for chromospheric and coronal heating models.

1004.3278	image reconstruction with analytical point spread functions	the image degradation produced by atmospheric turbulence and opticalaberrations is usually alleviated using post-facto image reconstructiontechniques, even when observing with adaptive optics systems. these techniquesrely on the development of the wavefront using zernike functions and thenon-linear optimization of a certain metric. the resulting optimizationprocedure is computationally heavy. our aim is to alleviate thiscomputationally burden. to this aim, we generalize the recently developedextended zernike-nijboer theory to carry out the analytical integration of thefresnel integral and present a natural basis set for the development of thepoint spread function in case the wavefront is described using zernikefunctions. we present a linear expansion of the point spread function in termsof analytic functions which, additionally, takes defocusing into account in anatural way. this expansion is used to develop a very fast phase-diversityreconstruction technique which is demonstrated through some applications. thissuggest that the linear expansion of the point spread function can be appliedto accelerate other reconstruction techniques in use presently and based onblind deconvolution.

0709.0596	bayesian inversion of stokes profiles	[abridged] inversion techniques are the most powerful methods to obtaininformation about the thermodynamical and magnetic properties of solar andstellar atmospheres. in the last years, we have witnessed the development ofhighly sophisticated inversion codes that are now widely applied tospectro-polarimetric observations. the majority of these inversion codes arebased on the optimization of a complicated non-linear merit function. however,no reliable and statistically well-defined confidence intervals can be obtainedfor the parameters inferred from the inversions. a correct estimation of theconfidence intervals for all the parameters that describe the model ismandatory. additionally, it is fundamental to apply efficient techniques toassess the ability of models to reproduce the observations and to what extentthe models have to be refined or can be simplified. bayesian techniques areapplied to analyze the performance of the model to fit a given observed stokesvector. the posterior distribution, is efficiently sampled using a markov chainmonte carlo method. for simplicity, we focus on the milne-eddington approximatesolution of the radiative transfer equation and we only take into account thegeneration of polarization through the zeeman effect. however, the method isextremely general and other more complex forward models can be applied. weillustrate the ability of the method with the aid of academic and realisticexamples. we show that the information provided by the posterior distributionturns out to be fundamental to understand and determine the amount ofinformation available in the stokes profiles in these particular cases.

1101.1868	clear detection of dusty torus signatures in a weak-line radio galaxy:  the case of pks 0043-42	we report the clearest detection to date of dusty torus signatures in aweak-line radio galaxy (wlrg). the deep spitzer infrared spectrograph (irs)rest-frame mid-infrared (mir) spectrum of the wlrg pks 0043-42 (z=0.116) showsa clear spectral turnover at wavelengths longer than ~20 micron suggestive ofwarm dust, as well as a 9.7 micron silicate absorption feature. in addition,the hard x-ray results, based on chandra data, strongly support a picture inwhich pks 0043-42 has a torus and accretion disc more typical of strong-lineradio galaxies (slrgs). the mir and x-ray spectra are markedly different fromthose of other wlrgs at similar redshifts, and here we show that the former canbe successfully fitted with clumpy torus models with parameters characteristicof type-2 agn tori: close to edge-on (i=74 deg) and relatively broad (torusangular width=60 deg), with an outer radius of 2 pc, hydrogen column density~1.6x10^(23) cm^(-2), and agn bolometric luminosity ~1.6x10^(44) erg s^(-1).the presence of a compact torus in pks 0043-42 provides evidence that this wlrgis fuelled by cold, rather than hot, gas accretion. we suggest that wlrgs are adiverse population, and pks 0043-42 may represent a type of radio galaxy inwhich the agn activity has been recently re-triggered as a consequence ofintermittent gas supply, or in which the covering factor of the narrow-lineregion (nlr) clouds is relatively low.

1101.3335	testing the unification model for agn in the infrared: are the obscuring  tori of type 1 and 2 seyferts different?	we present new mid-infrared (mir) imaging data for three type-1 seyfertgalaxies obtained with t-recs on the gemini-south telescope at subarcsecondresolution. our aim is to enlarge the sample studied in a previous work tocompare the properties of type-1 and type-2 seyfert tori using clumpy torusmodels and a bayesian approach to fit the infrared nuclear spectral energydistributions (seds). thus, the sample considered here comprises 7 type-1, 11type-2, and 3 intermediate-type seyferts. the unresolved ir emission of theseyfert 1 galaxies can be reproduced by a combination of dust heated by thecentral engine and direct agn emission, while for the seyfert 2 nuclei onlydust emission is considered. these dusty tori have physical sizes smaller than6 pc radius, as derived from our fits. unification schemes of agn account for avariety of observational differences in terms of viewing geometry. however, wefind evidence that strong unification may not hold, and that the immediatedusty surroundings of type-1 and type-2 seyfert nuclei are intrinsicallydifferent. the type-2 tori studied here are broader, have more clumps, andthese clumps have lower optical depths than those of type-1 tori. the largerthe covering factor of the torus, the smaller the probability of having directview of the agn, and vice-versa. in our sample, seyfert 2 tori have largercovering factors and smaller escape probabilities than those of seyfert 1. allthe previous differences are significant according to the kullback-leiblerdivergence. thus, on the basis of the results presented here, theclassification of a seyfert galaxy as a type-1 or type-2 depends more on theintrinsic properties of the torus rather than on its mere inclination towardsus, in contradiction with the simplest unification model.

1102.2068	bayesian inference of solar and stellar magnetic fields in the  weak-field approximation	the weak-field approximation is one of the simplest models that allows us torelate the observed polarization induced by the zeeman effect with the magneticfield vector present on the plasma of interest. it is usually applied fordiagnosing magnetic fields in the solar and stellar atmospheres. a fullybayesian approach to the inference of magnetic properties in unresolvedstructures is presented. the analytical expression for the marginal posteriordistribution is obtained, from which we can obtain statistically relevantinformation about the model parameters. the role of a-priori information isdiscussed and a hierarchical procedure is presented that gives robust resultsthat are almost insensitive to the precise election of the prior. the strengthof the formalism is demonstrated through an application to imax data. bayesianmethods can optimally exploit data from filter-polarimeters given the scarcityof spectral information as compared with spectro-polarimeters. the effect ofnoise and how it degrades our ability to extract information from the stokesprofiles is analyzed in detail.

1103.0145	unnoticed magnetic field oscillations in the very quiet sun revealed by  sunrise/imax	we present observational evidence for oscillations of magnetic flux densityin the quiet areas of the sun. the majority of magnetic fields on the solarsurface have strengths of the order of or lower than the equipartition field(300-500 g). this results in a myriad of magnetic fields whose evolution islargely determined by the turbulent plasma motions. when granules evolve theysquash the magnetic field lines together or pull them apart. here we report onthe periodic deformation of the shapes of features in circular polarizationobserved at high resolution with sunrise. in particular, we note that the areaof patches with constant magnetic flux oscillates with time, which implies thatthe apparent magnetic field intensity oscillates in antiphase. the periodsassociated to this oscillatory pattern is compatible with the granularlife-time and change abruptly, which suggests that these oscillations might notcorrespond to characteristic oscillatory modes of magnetic structures, but tothe forcing by granular motions. in one particular case, we find three patchesaround the same granule oscillating in phase, which means that the spatialcoherence of these oscillations can reach 1600 km. interestingly, the same kindof oscillatory phenomenon is found also in the upper photosphere.

1111.2496	influence of phase-diversity image reconstruction techniques on circular  polarization asymmetries	full stokes filter-polarimeters are key instruments for investigating therapid evolution of magnetic structures on the solar surface. to this end, theimage quality is routinely improved using a-posteriori image reconstructionmethods. we analyze the robustness of circular polarization asymmetries tophase-diversity image reconstruction techniques. we use snapshots ofmagneto-hydrodynamical simulations carried out with different initialconditions to synthesize spectra of the magnetically sensitive fe i line at5250.2 a. we degrade the synthetic profiles spatially and spectrally tosimulate observations with the imax full stokes filter-polarimeter. we alsosimulate the focused/defocused pairs of images used by the phase-diversityalgorithm for reconstruction and the polarimetric modulation scheme. we assumethat standard optimization methods are able to infer the projection of thewavefront on the zernike polynomials with 10% precision. we also consider theless favorable case of 25% precision. we obtain reconstructed monochromaticmodulated images that are later demodulated and compared with the originalmaps. although asymmetries are often difficult to define in the quiet sun dueto the complexity of the stokes v profiles, we show how asymmetries aredegraded with spatial and spectral smearing. the results indicate that,although image reconstruction techniques reduce the spatial smearing, they canmodify the asymmetries of the profiles, mainly caused by the appearance ofspatially-correlated noise.

1201.5063	model selection for spectro-polarimetric inversions	inferring magnetic and thermodynamic information from spectropolarimetricobservations relies on the assumption of a parameterized model atmosphere whoseparameters are tuned by comparison with observations. often, the choice of theunderlying atmospheric model is based on subjective reasons. in other cases,complex models are chosen based on objective reasons (for instance, thenecessity to explain asymmetries in the stokes profiles) but it is not clearwhat degree of complexity is needed. the lack of an objective way of comparingmodels has, sometimes, led to opposing views of the solar magnetism because theinferred physical scenarios are essentially different. we present the firstquantitative model comparison based on the computation of the bayesian evidenceratios for spectropolarimetric observations. our results show that there is nota single model appropriate for all profiles simultaneously. data with moderatesignal-to-noise ratios favor models without gradients along the line-of-sight.if the observations shows clear circular and linear polarization signals abovethe noise level, models with gradients along the line are preferred. as ageneral rule, observations with large signal-to-noise ratios favor more complexmodels. we demonstrate that the evidence ratios correlate well with simpleproxies. therefore, we propose to calculate these proxies when carrying outstandard least-squares inversions to allow for model comparison in the future.

1206.2502	analytical calculation of stokes profiles of rotating stellar magnetic  dipole	the observation of the polarization emerging from a rotating star atdifferent phases opens up the possibility to map the magnetic field in thestellar surface thanks to the well-known zeeman doppler imaging. when themagnetic field is sufficiently weak, the circular and linear polarizationprofiles locally in each point of the star are proportional to the first andsecond derivatives of the unperturbed intensity profile, respectively. we showthat the weak-field approximation (for weak lines in the case of linearpolarization) can be generalized to the case of a rotating star including thedoppler effect and taking into account the integration on the stellar surface.the stokes profiles are written as a linear combination of wavelength-dependentterms expressed as series expansions in terms of hermite polynomials. theseterms contain the surface integrated magnetic field and velocity components.the direct numerical evaluation of these quantities is limited to rotationvelocities not larger than 8 times the doppler width of the local absorptionprofiles. additionally, we demonstrate that, in a rotating star, the circularpolarization flux depends on the derivative of the intensity flux with respectto the wavelength and also on the profile itself. likewise, the linearpolarization depends on the profile and on its first and second derivative withrespect to the wavelength. we particularize the general expressions to arotating dipole.

1209.3870	constraining clumpy dusty torus models using optimized filter sets	recent success in explaining several properties of the dusty torus around thecentral engine of active galactic nuclei has been gathered with the assumptionof clumpiness. the properties of such clumpy dusty tori can be inferred byanalyzing spectral energy distributions (seds), sometimes with scarce samplinggiven that large aperture telescopes and long integration times are needed toget good spatial resolution and signal. we aim at using the information alreadypresent in the data and the assumption of clumpy dusty torus, in particular,the clumpy models of nenkova et al., to evaluate the optimum next observationsuch that we maximize the constraining power of the new observed photometricpoint. to this end, we use the existing and barely applied idea of bayesianadaptive exploration, a mixture of bayesian inference, prediction and decisiontheories. the result is that the new photometric filter to use is the one thatmaximizes the expected utility, which we approximate with the entropy of thepredictive distribution. in other words, we have to sample where there islarger variability in the seds compatible with the data with what we know ofthe model parameters. we show that bayesian adaptive exploration can be used tosuggest new observations, and ultimately optimal filter sets, to betterconstrain the parameters of the clumpy dusty torus models. in general, we findthat the region between 10 and 200 um produces the largest increase in theexpected utility, although sub-mm data from alma also prove to be useful. it isimportant to note that here we are not considering the angular resolution ofthe data, which is key when constraining torus parameters. therefore, theexpected utilities derived from this methodology must be weighted with thespatial resolution of the data.

1209.6455	signal detection for spectroscopy and polarimetry	the analysis of high spectral resolution spectroscopic andspectropolarimetric observations constitute a very powerful way of inferringthe dynamical, thermodynamical, and magnetic properties of distant objects.however, these techniques are photon-starving, making it difficult to use themfor all purposes. one of the problems commonly found is just detecting thepresence of a signal that is buried on the noise at the wavelength of someinteresting spectral feature. this is specially relevant forspectropolarimetric observations because typically, only a small fraction ofthe received light is polarized. we present in this note a bayesian techniquefor the detection of spectropolarimetric signals. the technique is based on theapplication of the non-parametric relevance vector machine to the observations,which allows us to compute the evidence for the presence of the signal andcompute the more probable signal. the method would be suited for analyzing datafrom experimental instruments onboard space missions and rockets aiming atdetecting spectropolarimetric signals in unexplored regions of the spectrumsuch as the chromospheric lyman-alpha spectro-polarimeter (clasp) soundingrocket experiment.

1307.0061	improved search of pca databases for spectro-polarimetric inversion	we describe a simple technique for the acceleration of spectro-polarimetricinversions based on principal component analysis (pca) of stokes profiles. thistechnique involves the indexing of the database models based on the sign of theprojections (pca coefficients) of the first few relevant orders of principalcomponents of the four stokes parameters. in this way, each model in thedatabase can be attributed a distinctive binary number of $2^{4n}$ bits, where$n$ is the number of pca orders used for the indexing. each of these binarynumbers (indexes) identifies a group of "compatible" models for the inversionof a given set of observed stokes profiles sharing the same index. the completeset of the binary numbers so constructed evidently determines a partition ofthe database. the search of the database for the pca inversion ofspectro-polarimetric data can profit greatly from this indexing. in practicalcases it becomes possible to approach the ideal acceleration factor of $2^{4n}$as compared to the systematic search of a non-indexed database for atraditional pca inversion. this indexing method relies on the existence of aphysical meaning in the sign of the pca coefficients of a model. for thisreason, the presence of model ambiguities and of spectro-polarimetric noise inthe observations limits in practice the number $n$ of relevant pca orders thatcan be used for the indexing.

1311.3446	uncovering the deeply embedded agn activity in the nuclear regions of  the interacting galaxy arp299	we present mid-infrared (mir) 8-13micron spectroscopy of the nuclear regionsof the interacting galaxy arp299 (ic694+ngc3690) obtained with canaricam (cc)on the 10.4m gran telescopio canarias (gtc). the high angular resolution(~0.3-0.6arcsec) of the data allows us to probe nuclear physical scales between60 and 120pc, which is a factor of 10 improvement over previous mirspectroscopic observations of this system. the gtc/cc spectroscopy displaysevidence of deeply embedded active galactic nucleus (agn) activity in bothnuclei. the gtc/cc nuclear spectrum of ngc3690/arp299-b1 can be explained asemission from agn-heated dust in a clumpy torus with both a high coveringfactor and high extinction along the line of sight. the estimated bolometricluminosity of the agn in ngc3690 is 3.2(+/-0.6)x10^44 erg/s. the nuclear gtc/ccspectrum of ic694/arp299-a shows 11.3micron polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon(pah) emission stemming from a deeply embedded (a_v~24mag) region of less than120pc in size. there is also a continuum-emitting dust component. if associatedwith th putative agn in ic694, we estimate that it would be approximately 5times less luminous than the agn in ngc3690. the presence of dual agn activitymakes arp299 a good example to study such phenomenon in the early coalescencephase of interacting galaxies.

1401.6282	a search for magnetic fields on central stars in planetary nebulae	one of the possible mechanisms responsible for the panoply of shapes inplanetary nebulae is the presence of magnetic fields that drive the ejection ofionized material during the proto-planetary nebula phase. therefore, detectingmagnetic fields in such objects is of key importance for understanding theirdynamics. still, magnetic fields have not been detected using polarimetry inthe central stars of planetary nebulae. circularly polarized light spectra havebeen obtained with the focal reducer and low dispersion spectrograph at thevery large telescope of the european southern observatory and the intermediatedispersion spectrograph and imaging system at the william herschel telescope.nineteen planetary nebulae spanning very different morphology and evolutionarystages have been selected. most of central stars have been observed atdifferent rotation phases to point out evidence of magnetic variability. inthis paper, we present the result of two observational campaigns aimed todetect and measure the magnetic field in the central stars of planetary nebulaeon the basis of low resolution spectropolarimetry. in the limit of the adoptedmethod, we can state that large scale fields of kg order are not hosted on thecentral star of planetary nebulae.

1402.0345	investigating the sensitivity of observed spectral energy distributions  to clumpy torus properties in seyfert galaxies	we present nuclear spectral energy distributions (seds) from 1 to 18 micronof a small sample of nearby, nearly face-on and undisturbed seyfert galaxieswithout prominent nuclear dust lanes. these nuclear seds probe the central ~35pc of the galaxies, on average, and include photometric and spectroscopicinfrared (ir) data. we use these seds, the clumpy torus models of nenkova etal. and a bayesian approach to study the sensitivity of different irwavelengths to the torus parameters. we find that high angular resolution 8-13micron spectroscopy alone reliably constrains the number of clumps and theiroptical depth (n0 and tau_v). on the other hand, we need a combination of mid-and near-ir subarcsecond resolution photometry to constrain torus width andinclination, as well as the radial distribution of the clouds (sigma, i and q).for flat radial profiles (q=0,1), it is possible to constrain the extent of themid-ir-emitting dust within the torus (y) when n-band spectroscopy isavailable, in addition to near-ir photometry. finally, by fitting differentcombinations of average and individual seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 data, we findthat, in general, for undisturbed, nearly face-on seyferts without prominentnuclear dust lanes, the minimum combination of data necessary to reliablyconstrain all the torus parameters is j+k+m-band photometry + n-bandspectroscopy.

1403.5640	time evolution of plasma parameters during the rise of a prominence  instability	we present high spatial resolution spectropolarimetric observations of aquiescent hedgerow prominence taken in the he i 1083.0 nm triplet. theobservation consisted of a time series in sit-and-stare mode of 36 minutes ofduration. the spectrograph's slit crossed the prominence body and we recordedthe time evolution of individual vertical threads. eventually, we observed thedevelopment of a dark rayleigh-taylor plume that propagated upward with avelocity, projected onto the plane of the sky, of 17 km/s. interestingly, theplume apex collided with the prominence threads pushing them aside. we inferreddoppler shifts, doppler widths, and magnetic field strength variations byinterpreting the he i stokes profiles with the hazel code. the doppler shiftsshow that clusters of threads move coherently while individual threads haveoscillatory patterns. regarding the plume we found strong redshifts (9-12 km/s)and large doppler widths (10 km/s) at the plume apex when it passed through theprominence body and before it disintegrated. we associate the redshifts withperspective effects while the doppler widths are more likely due to an increasein the local temperature. no local variations of the magnetic field strengthassociated with the passage of the plume were found; this leads us to concludethat the plumes are no more magnetized than the surroundings. finally, we foundthat some of the threads oscillations are locally damped, what allowed us toapply prominence seismology techniques to infer additional prominence physicalparameters.

1404.0786	on the inversion of the scattering polarization and the hanle effect  signals in the hydrogen lyman-$\alpha$ line	magnetic field measurements in the upper chromosphere and above, where thegas-to-magnetic pressure ratio $\beta$ is lower than unity, are essential forunderstanding the thermal structure and dynamical activity of the solaratmosphere. recent developments in the theory and numerical modeling ofpolarization in spectral lines have suggested that information on the magneticfield of the chromosphere-corona transition region could be obtained bymeasuring the linear polarization of the solar disk radiation at the core ofthe hydrogen lyman-$\alpha$ line at 121.6~nm, which is produced by scatteringprocesses and the hanle effect. the chromospheric lyman-$\alpha$spectropolarimeter (clasp) sounding rocket experiment aims to measure theintensity (stokes $i$) and the linear polarization profiles ($q/i$ and $u/i$)of the hydrogen lyman-$\alpha$ line. in this paper we clarify the informationthat the hanle effect can provide by applying a stokes inversion techniquebased on a database search. the database contains all theoretical $q/i$ and$u/i$ profiles calculated in a one-dimensional semi-empirical model of thesolar atmosphere for all possible values of the strength, inclination, andazimuth of the magnetic field vector, though this atmospheric region is highlyinhomogeneous and dynamic. we focus on understanding the sensitivity of theinversion results to the noise and spectral resolution of the syntheticobservations as well as the ambiguities and limitation inherent to the hanleeffect when only the hydrogen lyman-$\alpha$ is used. we conclude thatspectropolarimetric observations with clasp can indeed be a suitable diagnostictool for probing the magnetism of the transition region, especially whencomplemented with information on the magnetic field azimuth that can beobtained from other instruments.

0804.2695	advanced forward modeling and inversion of stokes profiles resulting  from the joint action of the hanle and zeeman effects	a big challenge in solar and stellar physics in the coming years will be todecipher the magnetism of the solar outer atmosphere (chromosphere and corona)along with its dynamic coupling with the magnetic fields of the underlyingphotosphere. to this end, it is important to develop rigorous diagnostic toolsfor the physical interpretation of spectropolarimetric observations in suitablychosen spectral lines. here we present a computer program for the synthesis andinversion of stokes profiles caused by the joint action of atomic levelpolarization and the hanle and zeeman effects in some spectral lines ofdiagnostic interest, such as those of the he i 10830 a and d_3 multiplets. itis based on the quantum theory of spectral line polarization, which takes intoaccount all the relevant physical mechanisms and ingredients (optical pumping,atomic level polarization, zeeman, paschen-back and hanle effects). theinfluence of radiative transfer on the emergent spectral line radiation istaken into account through a suitable slab model. the user can either calculatethe emergent intensity and polarization for any given magnetic field vector orinfer the dynamical and magnetic properties from the observed stokes profilesvia an efficient inversion algorithm based on global optimization methods. thereliability of the forward modeling and inversion code presented here isdemonstrated through several applications, which range from the inference ofthe magnetic field vector in solar active regions to determining whether or notit is canopy-like in quiet chromospheric regions. this user-friendly diagnostictool called "hazel" (from hanle and zeeman light) is offered to theastrophysical community, with the hope that it will facilitate new advances insolar and stellar physics.

0804.4692	pca detection and denoising of zeeman signatures in stellar polarised  spectra	our main objective is to develop a denoising strategy to increase the signalto noise ratio of individual spectral lines of stellar spectropolarimetricobservations.  we use a multivariate statistics technique called principal componentanalysis. the cross-product matrix of the observations is diagonalized toobtain the eigenvectors in which the original observations can be developed.this basis is such that the first eigenvectors contain the greatest variance.assuming that the noise is uncorrelated a denoising is possible byreconstructing the data with a truncated basis. we propose a method to identifythe number of eigenvectors for an efficient noise filtering.  numerical simulations are used to demonstrate that an important increase ofthe signal to noise ratio per spectral line is possible using pca denoisingtechniques. it can be also applied for detection of magnetic fields in stellaratmospheres. we analyze the relation between pca and commonly used well-knowntechniques like line addition and least-squares deconvolution. moreover, pca isvery robust and easy to compute.

0804.4708	error propagation in polarimetric demodulation	the polarization analysis of the light is typically carried out usingmodulation schemes. the light of unknown polarization state is passed through aset of known modulation optics and a detector is used to measure the totalintensity passing the system. the modulation optics is modified several timesand, with the aid of such several measurements, the unknown polarization stateof the light can be inferred. how to find the optimal demodulation process hasbeen investigated in the past. however, since the modulation matrix has to bemeasured for a given instrument and the optical elements can present problemsof repeatability, some uncertainty is present in the elements of the modulationmatrix and/or covariances between these elements. we analyze in detail thisissue, presenting analytical formulae for calculating the covariance matrixproduced by the propagation of such uncertainties on the demodulation matrix,on the inferred stokes parameters and on the efficiency of the modulationprocess. we demonstrate that, even if the covariance matrix of the modulationmatrix is diagonal, the covariance matrix of the demodulation matrix is, ingeneral, non-diagonal because matrix inversion is a nonlinear operation. thispropagates through the demodulation process and induces correlations on theinferred stokes parameters.

1503.07666	sparse inversion of stokes profiles. i. two-dimensional milne-eddington  inversions	inversion codes are numerical tools used for the inference of physicalproperties from the observations. despite their success, the quality of currentspectropolarimetric observations and those expected in the near future presentsa challenge to current inversion codes. the pixel-by-pixel strategy ofinverting spectropolarimetric data that we currently utilize needs to besurpassed and improved. the inverted physical parameters have to take intoaccount the spatial correlation that is present in the data and that containsvaluable physical information. we utilize the concept of sparsity orcompressibility to develop an new generation of inversion codes for the stokesparameters. the inversion code uses numerical optimization techniques based onthe idea of proximal algorithms to impose sparsity. in so doing, we allow forthe first time to exploit the presence of spatial correlation on the maps ofphysical parameters. sparsity also regularizes the solution by reducing thenumber of unknowns. we compare the results of the new inversion code withpixel-by-pixel inversions, demonstrating the increase in robustness of thesolution. we also show how the method can easily compensate for the effect ofthe telescope point spread function, producing solutions with an enhancedcontrast.

1505.03219	spatial deconvolution of spectropolarimetric data: an application to  quiet sun magnetic elements	observations of the sun from the earth are always limited by the presence ofthe atmosphere, which strongly disturbs the images. a solution to this problemis to place the telescopes in space satellites, which produce observationswithout any (or limited) atmospheric aberrations. however, even though theimages from space are not affected by atmospheric seeing, the opticalproperties of the instruments still limit the observations. in the case ofdiffraction limited observations, the psf establishes the maximum allowedspatial resolution, defined as the distance between two nearby structures thatcan be properly distinguished. in addition, the shape of the psf induce adispersion of the light from different parts of the image, leading to what iscommonly termed as stray light or dispersed light. this effect produces thatlight observed in a spatial location at the focal plane is a combination of thelight emitted in the object at relatively distant spatial locations. we aim tocorrect the effect produced by the telescope's psf using a deconvolutionmethod, and we decided to apply the code on hinode/sp quiet sun observations.we analyze the validity of the deconvolution process with noisy data and weinfer the physical properties of quiet sun magnetic elements after thedeconvolution process.

astro-ph;0303460	non-equilibrium co chemistry in the solar atmosphere	investigating the reliability of the assumption of instantaneous chemicalequilibrium (ice) for calculating the co number density in the solar atmosphereis of crucial importance for the resolution of the long-standing controversyover the existence of `cool clouds' in the chromosphere, and for determiningwhether the cool gas owes its existence to co radiative cooling or to ahydrodynamical process. here we report the first results of such aninvestigation in which we have carried out time-dependent gas-phase chemistrycalculations in radiation hydrodynamical simulations of solar chromosphericdynamics. we show that while the ice approximation turns out to be suitable formodeling the observed infrared co lines at the solar disk center, it maysubstantially overestimate the `heights of formation' of strong co linessynthesized close to the edge of the solar disk, especially concerning vigorousdynamic cases resulting from relatively strong photospheric disturbances. thishappens because during the cool phases of the hydrodynamical simulations the conumber density in the outer atmospheric regions is smaller than what isstipulated by the ice approximation, resulting in decreased co opacity in thesolar chromosphere. as a result, the cool co-bearing gas which produces theobserved molecular lines must be located at atmospheric heights not greaterthan 700 km, approximately. we conclude that taking into account thenon-equilibrium chemistry improves the agreement with the available on-disk andoff-limb observations, but that the hydrodynamical simulation model has to beeven cooler than anticipated by the ice approximation, and this has to be thecase at the `new' (i.e. deeper) formation regions of the rovibrational colines.

astro-ph;0401467	the zeeman effect in the g band	we investigate the possibility of measuring magnetic field strength in g-bandbright points through the analysis of zeeman polarization in molecular chlines. to this end we solve the equations of polarized radiative transfer inthe g band through a standard plane-parallel model of the solar atmosphere withan imposed magnetic field, and through a more realistic snapshot from asimulation of solar magneto-convection. this region of the spectrum is crowdedwith many atomic and molecular lines. nevertheless, we find several instancesof isolated groups of ch lines that are predicted to produce a measurablestokes v signal in the presence of magnetic fields. in part this is possiblebecause the effective land\'{e} factors of lines in the stronger main branch ofthe ch a$^{2}\delta$--x$^{2}\pi$ transition tend to zero rather quickly forincreasing total angular momentum $j$, resulting in a stokes $v$ spectrum ofthe g band that is less crowded than the corresponding stokes $i$ spectrum. weindicate that, by contrast, the effective land\'{e} factors of the $r$ and $p$satellite sub-branches of this transition tend to $\pm 1$ for increasing $j$.however, these lines are in general considerably weaker, and do not contributesignificantly to the polarization signal. in one wavelength location near 430.4nm the overlap of several magnetically sensitive and non-sensitive ch lines ispredicted to result in a single-lobed stokes $v$ profile, raising thepossibility of high spatial-resolution narrow-band polarimetric imaging. in themagneto-convection snapshot we find circular polarization signals of the orderof 1% prompting us to conclude that measuring magnetic field strength insmall-scale elements through the zeeman effect in ch lines is a realisticprospect.

astro-ph;0512248	very efficient methods for multilevel radiative transfer in atomic and  molecular lines	the development of fast numerical methods for multilevel radiative transfer(rt) applications often leads to important breakthroughs in astrophysics,because they allow the investigation of problems that could not be properlytackled using the methods previously available. probably, the most familiarexample is the so-called multilevel accelerated $\lambda$-iteration (mali)technique of rybicki &amp; hummer for the case of a local approximate operator,which is based on jacobi iteration. however, there are superioroperator-splitting methods, based on gauss-seidel (gs) and successiveoverrelaxation (sor) iteration, which provide a dramatic increase in the speedwith which non-lte multilevel transfer problems can be solved in one, two andthree-dimensional geometries. such rt methods, which were introduced bytrujillo bueno &amp; fabiani bendicho ten years ago, are the main subject of thefirst part of this paper. we show in some detail how they can be applied forsolving multilevel rt problems in spherical geometry, for both atomic andmolecular line transitions. the second part of the article addresses the issueof the calculation of the molecular number densities when the approximation ofinstantaneous chemical equilibrium turns out to be inadequate, which happens tobe the case whenever the dynamical time scales of the astrophysical plasmaunder consideration are much shorter than the time needed by the molecules toform.

astro-ph;0606516	the minimum description length principle and model selection in  spectropolarimetry	it is shown that the two-part minimum description length principle can beused to discriminate among different models that can explain a given observeddataset. the description length is chosen to be the sum of the lengths of themessage needed to encode the model plus the message needed to encode the datawhen the model is applied to the dataset. it is verified that the proposedprinciple can efficiently distinguish the model that correctly fits theobservations while avoiding over-fitting. the capabilities of this criterionare shown in two simple problems for the analysis of observedspectropolarimetric signals. the first is the de-noising of observations withthe aid of the pca technique. the second is the selection of the optimal numberof parameters in lte inversions. we propose this criterion as a quantitativeapproach for distinguising the most plausible model among a set of proposedmodels. this quantity is very easy to implement as an additional output on theexisting inversion codes.

astro-ph;0610128	influence of atomic polarization and horizontal illumination on the  stokes profiles of the he i 10830 multiplet	the polarization observed in the spectral lines of the he i 10830 multipletcarries valuable information on the dynamical and magnetic properties of plasmastructures in the solar chromosphere and corona, such as spicules, prominences,filaments, emerging magnetic flux regions, etc. here we investigate theinfluence of atomic level polarization on the emergent stokes profiles for abroad range of magnetic field strengths, in both 90 degree and forwardscattering geometry. we show that, contrary to a widespread belief, theselective emission and absorption processes caused by the presence of atomiclevel polarization may have an important influence on the emergent linearpolarization, even for magnetic field strengths as large as 1000 g.consequently, the modeling of the stokes q and u profiles should not be done bytaking only into account the contribution of the transverse zeeman effectwithin the framework of the paschen-back effect theory, unless the magneticfield intensity of the observed plasma structure is sensibly larger than 1000g. we point out also that in low-lying optically thick plasma structures, suchas those of active region filaments, the (horizontal) radiation field generatedby the structure itself may substantially reduce the positive contribution tothe anisotropy factor caused by the (vertical) radiation field coming from theunderlying solar photosphere, so that the amount of atomic level polarizationmay turn out to be negligible. only under such circumstances may the emergentlinear polarization of the he i 10830 multiplet in such regions of the solaratmosphere be dominated by the contribution caused by the transverse zeemaneffect.

astro-ph;0612389	a near-ir line of mn i as a diagnostic tool of the average magnetic  energy in the solar photosphere	we report on spectropolarimetric observations of a near-ir line of mn ilocated at 15262.702 a whose intensity and polarization profiles are verysensitive to the presence of hyperfine structure. a theoretical investigationof the magnetic sensitivity of this line to the magnetic field uncovers severalinteresting properties. the most important one is that the presence of strongpaschen-back perturbations due to the hyperfine structure produces an intensityline profile whose shape changes according to the absolute value of themagnetic field strength. a line ratio technique is developed from the intrinsicvariations of the line profile. this line ratio technique is applied tospectropolarimetric observations of the quiet solar photosphere in order toexplore the probability distribution function of the magnetic field strength.particular attention is given to the quietest area of the observed field ofview, which was encircled by an enhanced network region. a detailed theoreticalinvestigation shows that the inferred distribution yields information on theaverage magnetic field strength and the spatial scale at which the magneticfield is organized. a first estimation gives ~250 g for the mean field strengthand a tentative value of ~0.45" for the spatial scale at which the observedmagnetic field is horizontally organized.
