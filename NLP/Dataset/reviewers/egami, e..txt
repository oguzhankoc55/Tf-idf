0903.4911	locuss: luminous infrared galaxies in the merging cluster abell 1758 at  z=0.28	we present the first galaxy evolution results from the local clustersubstructure survey (locuss), a multi-wavelength survey of 100 x-ray selectedgalaxy clusters at 0.15&lt;z&lt;0.30. locuss combines far-uv through far-irobservations of cluster galaxies with gravitational lensing analysis and x-raydata to investigate the interplay between the hierarchical assembly of clustersand the evolution of cluster galaxies. here we present new panoramicspitzer/mips 24micron observations of the merging cluster abell 1758 at z=0.279spanning 6.5x6.5mpc and reaching a 90% completeness limit of 400ujy. weestimate a global cluster sfr of 910\pm320 m_sun/yr within 3 mpc of the clustercentre, originating from 42 galaxies with l_ir &gt; 5x10^10 l_sun. the obscuredactivity in a1758 is therefore comparable with that in cl 0024+1654, the mostactive cluster previously studied at 24um. the obscured galaxies faithfullytrace the cluster potential as revealed by the weak-lensing mass map of thecluster, including numerous mass peaks at r~2-3mpc that are likely associatedwith infalling galaxy groups and filamentary structures. however the core(r&lt;500kpc) of a1758n is 2x more active in the ir than that of a1758s, likelyreflecting differences in the recent dynamical history of the two clusters. the24micron results from a1758 therefore suggest that dust-obscured clustergalaxies are common in merging clusters and suggests that obscured activity inclusters is triggered by both the details of cluster-cluster mergers andprocesses that operate at larger radii including those within in-fallinggroups. our ongoing far-uv through far-ir observations of a large sample ofclusters should allow us to disentangle the different physical processesresponsible for triggering obscured star formation in clusters.

0904.4479	irs spectroscopy and multi-wavelength study of luminous star-forming  galaxies at z~1.9	we analyze a sample of galaxies chosen to have f24&gt;0.5 mjy and satisfy acertain irac color criterion. irs spectra yield redshifts, spectral types, andpah luminosities, to which we add multi-wavelength broadband photometry.stellar population modeling and irs spectra together demonstrate that thedouble criteria used to select this sample have efficiently isolated massivestar-forming galaxies at z~1.9. this is the first starburst-dominated ulirgsample at high redshift with total infrared luminosity measured directly fromfir and millimeter photometry, and as such gives us the first accurate view ofbroadband seds for starburst galaxies at extremely high luminosity and at allwavelengths. similar broadband data are assembled for three other galaxysamples -- local starburst galaxies, local agn/ulirgs, and a second24mu-luminous z~1.9 sample dominated by agn. l(pah)/l(ir) for the new z~1.9starburst sample is the highest ever seen, some three times higher than inlocal starbursts, whereas in agns this ratio is depressed below the starbursttrend, often severely. several pieces of evidence imply that agns exist in thisstarburst dominated sample, except two of which even host very strong agn,while they still have very strong pah emission. the acs images show mostobjects have very extended morphologies in the rest-frame uv band, thusextended distribution of pah molecules. such an extended distribution preventsfurther destruction pah molecules by central agns. we conclude that objects inthis sample are ulirgs powered mainly by starburst; and the total infraredluminosity density contributed by this type of objects is 0.9-2.6x 10^7lsol/mpc^3.

0907.1093	aztec half square degree survey of the shades fields -- i. maps,  catalogues, and source counts	we present the first results from the largest deep extragalacticmillimetre-wavelength survey undertaken to date. these results are derived frommaps covering over 0.7 deg^2, made at 1.1mm, using the aztec continuum cameramounted on the james clerk maxwell telescope. the maps were made in the twofields originally targeted at 0.85mm with scuba in the shades project, namelythe lockman hole east (mapped to a depth of 0.9-1.3 mjy rms) and the subaru xmmdeep field (1.0-1.7 mjy rms). the wealth of existing and forthcoming deepmulti-frequency data in these two fields will allow the bright mm sourcepopulation revealed by these images to be explored in detail in subsequentpapers. here we present the maps themselves, a catalogue of 114high-significance sub-millimetre galaxy detections, and a thorough statisticalanalysis leading to the most robust determination to date of the 1.1mm sourcenumber counts. through careful comparison, we find that both the cosmos andgoods north fields, also imaged with aztec, contain an excess of mm sourcesover the new 1.1mm source-count baseline established here. in particular, ournew aztec/shades results indicate that very luminous high-redshift dustenshrouded starbursts (s_{1.1} &gt; 3 mjy) are 25-50% less common than would havebeen inferred from these smaller surveys, thus highlighting the potential rolesof cosmic variance and clustering in such measurements. we compare number countpredictions from recent models of the evolving mm/sub-mm source population tothese smg surveys, which provide important constraints for the ongoingrefinement of semi-analytic and hydrodynamical models of galaxy formation, andfind that all recent models over-predict the number of bright sub-millimetregalaxies found in this survey.

0908.3003	locuss: the mid-infrared butcher-oemler effect	we study the mid-infrared (mir) properties of galaxies in 30 massive galaxyclusters at 0.02&lt;z&lt;0.40, using panoramic spitzer/mips 24micron and nir data.this is the largest sample of clusters to date with mir data covering not onlythe cluster cores, but extending into the infall regions. we revisit thebutcher-oemler effect, measuring the fraction of massive infrared-luminousgalaxies (k&lt;k*+1.5, l_ir&gt;5x10^10l_sun) within r_200, finding a steady increasein the fraction with redshift from ~3% at z=0.02 to ~10% by z=0.30, and an rmscluster-to-cluster scatter about this trend of 0.03. the best-fit redshiftevolution model is of the form f_sf ~ (1+z)^5.7, which is stronger redshiftevolution than that of l*_ir in both clusters and the field. we find that,statistically, this excess is associated with galaxies found at largecluster-centric radii, implying that the mir butcher-oemler effect can beexplained by a combination of both the global decline in star-formation in theuniverse since z~1 and enhanced star formation in the infall regions ofclusters at intermediate redshifts. this picture is supported by a simpleinfall model based on the millennium simulation semi-analytic galaxy catalogs,whereby star-formation in infalling galaxies is instantaneously quenched upontheir first passage through the cluster, in that the observed radial trends off_sf trace those inferred from the simulations. we also find that f_sf does notdepend on simple indicators of the dynamical state of clusters, including theoffset between the brightest cluster galaxy and the peak of the x-ray emission.this is consistent with the picture described above in that most newstar-formation in clusters occurs in the infall regions, and is thus notsensitive to the details of cluster-cluster mergers in the core regions.

0909.0661	deep u-b-v imaging of the lockman hole with the lbt. observations and  number counts	we used the large binocular camera (lbc) mounted on the large binoculartelescope (lbt) to observe the lockman hole in the u, b, and v bands. ourobservations cover an area of 925 sq.arcmin. we reached depths of 26.7, 26.3,and 26.3 mag(ab) in the three bands, respectively, in terms of 50% sourcedetection efficiency, making this survey the deepest u-band survey and one ofthe deepest b and v band surveys with respect to its covered area. we extracteda large number of sources (~89000), detected in all three bands and examinedtheir surface density, comparing it with models of galaxy evolution. we findgood agreement with previous claims of a steep faint-end slope of theluminosity functions, caused by late-type and irregular galaxies at z&gt;1.5. apopulation of dwarf star-forming galaxies at 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5 is needed to explain theu-band number counts. we also find evidence of strong supernova feedback athigh redshift. this survey is complementary to the r, i, and z lockman holesurvey conducted with the subaru telescope and provides the essentialwavelength coverage to derive photometric redshifts and select different typesof sources from the lockman hole for further study.

0911.2004	physical properties and morphology of a newly identified compact z=4.04  lensed submillimeter galaxy in abell 2218	we present the identification of a bright submm source, smmj163555.5+661300,detected in the lensing cluster abell2218, for which we have accuratelydetermined the position using observations from the submillimeter array (sma).the identified optical counterpart has a spectroscopic redshift ofz=4.044+-0.001 if we attribute the single emission line detected atlambda=6140aa to lyman-alpha. this redshift identification is in good agreementwith the optical/near-infrared photometric redshift as well as the submm fluxratio s_450/s_850~1.6, the radio-submm flux ratio s_1.4/s_850 &lt; 0.004, and the24um to 850um flux ratio s_24/s_850 &lt; 0.005. correcting for the gravitationallensing amplification of ~5.5, we find that the source has a far-infraredluminosity of 1.3x10^12 lsun, which implies a star formation rate of 230msun/yr. this makes it the lowest-luminosity smg known at z&gt;4 to date. previousco(4-3) emission line obserations yielded a non-detection, for which we derivedan upper limit of the co line luminosity of l'_co = 0.3x10^10 k km/s/pc^2,which is not inconsistent with the l'_co - l_fir relation for starburstgalaxies. the best fit model to the optical and near-infrared photometry give astellar population with an age of 1.4 gyr and a stellar mass of 1.6x10^10 msun.the optical morphology is compact and in the source plane the galaxy has anextent of ~6kpc x 3kpc with individual star forming knots of &lt;500 pc in size.j163556 is not resolved in the sma data and we place a strict upper limit onthe size of the starburst region of 8kpc x 3kpc, which implies a lower limit onthe star formation rate surface density of 12 msun/yr/kpc^2. the redshift ofj163556 extends the redshift distribution of faint, lensed smgs, and we find noevidence that these have a different redshift distribution than bright smgs.

0912.0039	x-ray groups and clusters of galaxies in the subaru-xmm deep field	we present the results of a search for galaxy clusters in subaru-xmm deep  field. we reach a depth for a total cluster flux in the 0.5-2 kev band of2x10^{-15} ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1} over one of the widest xmm-newton contiguousraster surveys, covering an area of 1.3 square degrees. cluster candidates areidentified through a wavelet detection of extended x-ray emission. the redsequence technique allows us to identify 57 cluster candidates. we report onthe progress with the cluster spectroscopic follow-up and derive theirproperties based on the x-ray luminosity and cluster scaling relations. inaddition, 3 sources are identified as x-ray counterparts of radio lobes, and in3 further sources, x-ray counterpart of radio lobes provides a significantfraction of the total flux of the source. in the area covered by nir data, ouridentification success rate achieves 86%. we detect a number of radio galaxieswithin our groups and for a luminosity-limited sample of radio galaxies wecompute halo occupation statistics using a marked cluster mass function. wecompare the cluster detection statistics in the sxdf with the predictions ofconcordance cosmology and current knowledge of the x-ray cluster properties,concluding that a reduction of concordance sigma_8 value by 5% is required inorder to match the prediction of the model and the data. this conclusion stillneeds verification through the completion of cluster follow-up.

1003.0447	mid-infrared spectroscopy of candidate agn-dominated submillimeter  galaxies	spitzer spectroscopy has revealed that ~80% of submm galaxies (smgs) arestarburst (sb) dominated in the mid-infrared. here we focus on the remaining~20% that show signs of harboring powerful active galactic nuclei (agn). wehave obtained spitzer-irs spectroscopy of a sample of eight smgs which arecandidates for harboring powerful agn on the basis of irac color-selection(s8/s4.5&gt;2; i.e. likely power-law mid-infrared seds). smgs with an agndominating (&gt;50%) their mid-infrared emission could represent `missing link'sources in an evolutionary sequence involving a major merger. first of all, wedetect pah features in all of the smgs, indicating redshifts from 2.5-3.4,demonstrating the power of the mid-infrared to determine redshifts for theseoptically faint dusty galaxies. secondly, we see signs of both star-formation(from the pah features) and agn activity (from continuum emission) in oursample: 62% of the sample are agn-dominated in the mid-infrared with a medianagn content of 56%, compared with &lt;30% on average for typical smgs, revealingthat our irac color selection has successfully singled out sources withproportionately more agn emission than typical sb-dominated smgs. however, wefind that only about 10% of these agn dominate the bolometric emission of thesmg when the results are extrapolated to longer infrared wavelengths, implyingthat agn are not a significant power source to the smg population overall, evenwhen there is evidence in the mid-infrared for substantial agn activity. whenexisting samples of mid-infrared agn-dominated smgs are considered, we findthat s8/s4.5&gt;1.65 works well at selecting mid-infrared energetically dominantagn in smgs, implying a duty cycle of ~15% if all smgs go through a subsequentmid-infrared agn-dominated phase in the proposed evolutionary sequence.

1005.1207	herschel observations of fir emission lines in brightest cluster  galaxies	the question of how much gas cools in the cores of clusters of galaxies hasbeen the focus of many, multiwavelength studies in the past 30 years. in thisletter we present the first detections of the strongest atomic cooling lines,[c ii], [o i] and [n i] in two strong cooling flow clusters, a1068 and a2597,using herschel pacs. these spectra indicate that the substantial mass of coldmolecular gas (&gt;10^9 mo) known to be present in these systems is beingirradiated by intense uv radiation, most probably from young stars. the linewidths of these fir lines indicate that they share dynamics similar but notidentical to other ionised and molecular gas traced by optical, near-infraredand co lines. the relative brightness of the fir lines compared to co and firluminosity is consistent with other star-forming galaxies indicating that theproperties of the molecular gas clouds in cluster cores and the stars they formare not unusual. these results provide additional evidence for a reservoir ofcold gas that is fed by the cooling of gas in the cores of the most compactclusters and provide important diagnostics of the temperature and density ofthe dense clouds this gas resides in.

1005.3811	locuss: shedding new light on the massive lensing cluster abell 1689 -  the view from herschel	we present wide-field herschel/pacs observations of abell 1689, a massivegalaxy cluster at z=0.1832, from our open time key programme. we detect 39spectroscopically confirmed 100micron-selected cluster members down to1.5x10^10 lsun. these galaxies are forming stars at rates in the range 1-10msun/yr, and appear to comprise two distinct populations: two-thirds areunremarkable blue, late-type spirals found throughout the cluster; theremainder are dusty red sequence galaxies whose star formation is heavilyobscured with a(halpha)~2 mag, and are found only in the cluster outskirts. thespecific-sfrs of these dusty red galaxies are lower than the blue late-types,suggesting that the former are in the process of being quenched, perhaps viapre-processing, the unobscured star formation being terminated first. we alsodetect an excess of 100micron-selected galaxies extending ~6 mpc in lengthalong an axis that runs ne-sw through the cluster centre at &gt;95% confidence.qualitatively this structure is consistent with previous reports ofsubstructure in x-ray, lensing, and near-infrared maps of this cluster, furthersupporting the view that this cluster is a dynamically active, merging system.

1005.3816	locuss: probing galaxy transformation physics with herschel	we present an early broad-brush analysis of herschel/pacs observations ofstar-forming galaxies in 8 galaxy clusters drawn from our survey of 30 clustersat z~0.2. we define a complete sample of 192 spectroscopically confirmedcluster members down to l_tir&gt;3x10^10l_sun and l_k&gt;0.25l_sun. the averagek-band and bolometric infrared luminosities of these galaxies both fade by afactor of ~2 from clustercentric radii of 2r_200 to ~0.5r_200, indicating thatas galaxies enter the clusters ongoing star-formation stops first in the mostmassive galaxies, and that the specific star-formation rate (ssfr) isconserved. on smaller scales the average ssfr jumps by 25%, suggesting that incluster cores processes including ram pressure stripping may trigger a finalepisode of star-formation that presumably exhausts the remaining gas. thispicture is consistent with our comparison of the herschel-detected clustermembers with the cluster mass distributions, as measured in our previousweak-lensing study of these clusters. for example, the spatial distribution ofthe herschel sources is positively correlated with the structures in theweak-lensing mass maps at 5sigma significance, with the strongest signal seenat intermediate group-like densities. the strong dependence of the totalcluster ir luminosity on cluster mass l_tir propto m_virial^2 is alsoconsistent with accretion of galaxies and groups of galaxies (i.e. thesubstructure mass function) driving the cluster ir luminosity. the mostsurprising result is that roughly half of the herschel-detected cluster membershave redder s_100/s_24 flux ratios than expected, based on the rieke et al.models. on average cluster members are redder than non-members, and thefraction of red galaxies increases towards the cluster centers, both of whichindicate that these colors are not attributable to systematic photometricerrors.

1005.3820	the herschel lensing survey (hls): overview	the herschel lensing survey (hls) will conduct deep pacs and spire imaging of~40 massive clusters of galaxies. the strong gravitational lensing power ofthese clusters will enable us to penetrate through the confusion noise, whichsets the ultimate limit on our ability to probe the universe with herschel.here, we present an overview of our survey and a summary of the major resultsfrom our science demonstration phase (sdp) observations of the bullet cluster(z=0.297). the sdp data are rich, allowing us to study not only the backgroundhigh-redshift galaxies (e.g., strongly lensed and distorted galaxies at z=2.8and 3.2) but also the properties of cluster-member galaxies. our preliminaryanalysis shows a great diversity of far-infrared/submillimeter spectral energydistributions (seds), indicating that we have much to learn with herschel aboutthe properties of galaxy seds. we have also detected the sunyaev-zel'dovich(sz) effect increment with the spire data. the success of this sdp programdemonstrates the great potential of the herschel lensing survey to produceexciting results in a variety of science areas.

1005.3821	the far-infrared/submillimeter properties of galaxies located behind the  bullet cluster	the herschel lensing survey (hls) takes advantage of gravitational lensing bymassive galaxy clusters to sample a population of high-redshift galaxies whichare too faint to be detected above the confusion limit of currentfar-infrared/submillimeter telescopes. measurements from 100-500 micron bracketthe peaks of the far-infrared spectral energy distributions of these galaxies,characterizing their infrared luminosities and star formation rates. weintroduce initial results from our science demonstration phase observations,directed toward the bullet cluster (1e0657-56). by combining our observationswith laboca 870 micron and aztec 1.1 mm data we fully constrain the spectralenergy distributions of 19 mips 24 micron selected galaxies which are locatedbehind the cluster. we find that their colors are best fit using templatesbased on local galaxies with systematically lower infrared luminosities.thissuggests that our sources are not like local ultra-luminous infrared galaxiesin which vigorous star formation is contained in a compact highly dust-obscuredregion. instead, they appear to be scaled up versions of lower luminosity localgalaxies with star formation occurring on larger physical scales.

1005.3824	first detection of the sunyaev zel'dovich effect increment at lambda &lt;  650 um	the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect is a spectral distortion of the cosmicmicrowave background as observed through the hot plasma in galaxy clusters.this distortion is a decrement in the cmb intensity for lambda &gt; 1.3 mm, anincrement at shorter wavelengths, and small again by lambda ~250 um. as part ofthe herschel lensing survey (hls) we have mapped 1e0657-56 (the bullet cluster)with spire with bands centered at 250, 350 and 500 um and have detected the szeffect at the two longest wavelengths. the measured sz effect increment centralintensities are delta i_{0} = 0.097 +- 0.019 mjy sr^{-1} at 350 um and deltai_{0} = 0.268 +- 0.031 mjy sr^{-1} at 500 um, consistent with the sz effectspectrum derived from previous measurements at 2 mm. no other diffuse emissionis detected. the presence of the finite temperature sz effect correction ispreferred by the spire data at a significance of 2.1 sigma, opening thepossibility that the relativistic sz effect correction can be constrained byspire in a sample of clusters. the results presented here have importantramifications for both sub-mm measurements of galaxy clusters and blank fieldsurveys with spire.

1006.2153	the agn, star-forming, and morphological properties of luminous  ir-bright/optically-faint galaxies	we present the agn, star-forming, and morphological properties of a sample of13 mir-luminous (f(24) &gt; 700ujy) ir-bright/optically-faint galaxies (irbgs,f(24)/f(r) &gt; 1000). while these z~2 sources were drawn from deep chandra fieldswith &gt;200 ks x-ray coverage, only 7 are formally detected in the x-ray and fourlack x-ray emission at even the 2 sigma level. spitzer irs spectra, however,confirm that all of the sources are agn-dominated in the mid-ir, although halfhave detectable pah emission responsible for ~25% of their mid-infrared fluxdensity. when combined with other samples, this indicates that at least 30-40%of luminous irbgs have star-formation rates in the ulirg range (~100-2000msun/yr). x-ray hardness ratios and mir to x-ray luminosity ratios indicatethat all members of the sample contain heavily x-ray obscured agn, 80% of whichare candidates to be compton-thick. furthermore, the mean x-ray luminosity ofthe sample, log l(2-10 kev)(ergs/s)=44.6, indicates that these irbgs are type 2qsos, at least from the x-ray perspective. while those sources most heavilyobscured in the x-ray are also those most likely to display strong silicateabsorption in the mid-ir, silicate absorption does not always accompany x-rayobscuration. finally, ~70% of the irbgs are merger candidates, a rateconsistent with that of sub-mm galaxies (smgs), although smgs appear to bephysically larger than irbgs. these characteristics are consistent with theproposal that these objects represent a later, agn-dominated, and more relaxedevolutionary stage following soon after the star-formation-dominated onerepresented by the smgs.

1007.2196	locuss: connecting the dominance and shape of brightest cluster galaxies  with the assembly history of massive clusters	we study the luminosity gap, dm12, between the first and second rankedgalaxies in a sample of 59 massive galaxy clusters, using data from the haletelescope, hst, chandra, and spitzer. we find that the dm12 distribution,p(dm12), is a declining function of dm12, to which we fitted a straight line:p(dm12) propto -(0.13+/-0.02)dm12. the fraction of clusters with "large"luminosity gaps is p(dm12&gt;=1)=0.37+/-0.08, which represents a 3sigma excessover that obtained from monte carlo simulations of a schechter function thatmatches the mean cluster galaxy luminosity function. we also identify fourclusters with "extreme" luminosity gaps, dm12&gt;=2, giving a fraction ofp(dm12&gt;=2)=0.07+0.05-0.03. more generally, large luminosity gap clusters arerelatively homogeneous, with elliptical/disky brightest cluster galaxies(bcgs), cuspy gas density profiles (i.e. strong cool cores), highconcentrations, and low substructure fractions. in contrast, small luminositygap clusters are heterogeneous, spanning the full range ofboxy/elliptical/disky bcg morphologies, the full range of cool core strengthsand dark matter concentrations, and have large substructure fractions. takentogether, these results imply that the amplitude of the luminosity gap is afunction of both the formation epoch, and the recent infall history of thecluster. "bcg dominance" is therefore a phase that a cluster may evolvethrough, and is not an evolutionary "cul-de-sac". we also compare our resultswith semi-analytic model predictions based on the millennium simulation. noneof the models are able to reproduce all of the observational results,underlining the inability of current models to match the empirical propertiesof bcgs. we identify the strength of agn feedback and the efficiency with whichcluster galaxies are replenished after they merge with the bcg in each model aspossible causes of these discrepancies.

(2004). sed modellingshows that ~ 36 % of the ieros in our sample are luminous or ultra-luminousinfrared galaxies ((u)lirg). some very red drgs are found to be very dustystarbursts, even (u)lirgs, as also supported by their mid-ir photometry. noindication for agns is found, although faint activity cannot be excluded forall objects. from mid-ir and x-ray data 5 objects are clearly classified asstarbursts. the derived properties are quite similar to those of drgs andieros, except for 5 extreme objects in terms of colours, for which a very highextinction (av&gt;3) is found.

1102.5129	optical and infrared properties of active galactic nuclei in the lockman  hole	we present the observed-frame optical, near- and mid-infrared properties ofx-ray selected agn in the lockman hole. using a likelihood ratio method onoptical, near-infrared or mid-infrared catalogues, we assigned counterparts to401 out of the 409 x-ray sources of the xmm-newton catalogue. accuratephotometry was collected for all the sources from u to 24um. we used x-ray andoptical criteria to remove any normal galaxies, galactic stars, or x-rayclusters among them and studied the multi-wavelength properties of theremaining 377 agn. we used a mid-ir colour-colour selection to understand theagn contribution to the optical and infrared emission. using this selection, weidentified different behaviours of agn-dominated and host-dominated sources inx-ray-optical-infrared colour-colour diagrams. more specifically, the agndominated sources show a clear trend in the f_x/f_r vs. r-k and f_24um/f_r vs.r-k diagrams, while the hosts follow the behaviour of non x-ray detectedgalaxies. in the optical-near-infrared colour-magnitude diagram we see that theknown trend of redder objects being more obscured in x-rays is stronger foragn-dominated than for host-dominated systems. this is an indication that thetrend is more related to the agn contaminating the overall colours than anyevolutionary effects. finally, we find that a significant fraction (~30%) ofthe reddest agn are not obscured in x-rays.

(2002) at z=6.56 behind the abell 370 cluster was observed with themambo-2 array of bolometers at 1.2mm wavelength. the galaxy was not detecteddown to 1.08 mjy (3 sigma), but the depth of the observations and the lensamplification allow us to improve by approximately one order of magnitudepreviously published upper limits on far infrared emission of lyman-alphaemitting galaxies at this redshift. the following upper limits are derived fromour observations assuming typical dust parameters: dust mass &lt;5.3x10^7 msun, irluminosity &lt;2.1x10^{11} lsun, and star formation rate, sfr&lt;35 msun/yr. theobserved restframe uv--optical--ir spectral energy distribution (sed) of thisgalaxy is compatible with that of normal spiral galaxies or blue compact dwarfgalaxies. seds of prototypical ulirgs, such as arp 220, are clearly excluded.finally, we obtain an upper limit of &lt; 2.1x10^{-2} msun/yr/mpc^{-3} for thedust-obscured sfr density of lyman-alpha selected galaxies at z~6.6.

1108.2406	far infrared constraints on the contamination by dust obscured galaxies  of high-z dropout searches	the spectral energy distributions (sed) of dusty galaxies at intermediateredshift may look similar to very high redshift galaxies in the optical/nearinfrared (nir) domain. this can lead to the contamination of high redshiftgalaxy searches based on broad band optical/nir photometry by lower redshiftdusty galaxies as both kind of galaxies cannot be distinguished. thecontamination rate could be as high as 50%. {this work shows how the farinfrared (fir) domain can help to recognize likely low-z interlopers in anoptical/nir search for high-z galaxies.} we analyse the fir seds of twogalaxies proposed as very high redshift ($z&gt;7$) dropout candidates based ondeep hawk-i/vlt observations. the fir seds are sampled with pacs/herschel at100 and 160\,$\mu$m, with spire/herschel at 250, 350 and 500\,$\mu$m and withlaboca/apex at 870\,$\mu$m. we find that redshifts $&gt;7$ would imply extreme firseds (with dust temperatures $&gt;100$\,k and fir luminosities$&gt;10^{13}$\,$l_{\odot}$). at z$\sim$2, instead, the seds of both sources wouldbe compatible with that of typical ulirgs/smgs. considering all the dataavailable for these sources from visible to fir we re-estimate the redshiftsand we find $z\sim$1.6--2.5. due to the strong spectral breaks observed inthese galaxies, standard templates from the literature fail to reproduce thevisible-near ir part of the seds even when additional extinction is included.these sources resemble strongly dust obscured galaxies selected in spitzerobservations with extreme visible-to-fir colors, and the galaxy gn10 at $z=4$.galaxies with similar seds could contaminate other high redshift surveys.

1110.0960	photometry and photometric redshift catalogs for the lockman hole deep  field	we present broad band photometry and photometric redshifts for 187611 sourceslocated in ~0.5deg^2 in the lockman hole area. the catalog includes 389 x-raydetected sources identified with the very deep xmm-newton observationsavailable for an area of 0.2 deg^2. the source detection was performed on therc, z' and b band images and the available photometry is spanning from the farultraviolet to the mid infrared, reaching in the best case scenario 21 bands.astrometry corrections and photometric cross-calibrations over the entiredataset allowed the computation of accurate photometric redshifts. specialtreatment is undertaken for the x-ray sources, the majority of which is activegalactic nuclei. comparing the photometric redshifts to the availablespectroscopic redshifts we achieve for normal galaxies an accuracy of\sigma_{\delta z/(1+z)}=0.036, with 12.7% outliers, while for the x-raydetected sources the accuracy is \sigma_{\delta z/(1+z)}=0.069, with 18.3%outliers, where the outliers are defined as sources with|z_{phot}-z_{spec}|&gt;0.15 (1+z_{spec})}. these results are a significantimprovement over the previously available photometric redshifts for normalgalaxies in the lockman hole, while it is the first time that photometricredshifts are computed and made public for agn for this field.

1201.1294	the relation between cool cluster cores and herschel-detected star  formation in brightest cluster galaxies	we present far-infrared (fir) analysis of 68 brightest cluster galaxies(bcgs) at 0.08 &lt; z &lt; 1.0. deriving total infrared luminosities directly fromspitzer and herschel photometry spanning the peak of the dust component(24-500um), we calculate the obscured star formation rate (sfr). 22(+6.2,-5.3)%of the bcgs are detected in the far-infrared, with sfr= 1-150 m_sun/yr. theinfrared luminosity is highly correlated with cluster x-ray gas cooling timesfor cool-core clusters (gas cooling time &lt;1 gyr), strongly suggesting that thestar formation in these bcgs is influenced by the cluster-scale coolingprocess. the occurrence of the molecular gas tracing ha emission is alsocorrelated with obscured star formation. for all but the most luminous bcgs(l_tir &gt; 2x10^11 l_sun), only a small (&lt;0.4 mag) reddening correction isrequired for sfr(ha) to agree with sfr_fir. the relatively low ha extinction(dust obscuration), compared to values reported for the general star-formingpopulation, lends further weight to an alternate (external) origin for the coldgas. finally, we use a stacking analysis of non-cool-core clusters to show thatthe majority of the fuel for star formation in the fir-bright bcgs is unlikelyto originate form normal stellar mass loss.

1205.2370	aztec half square degree survey of the shades fields - ii.  identifications, redshifts, and evidence for large-scale structure	the aztec 1.1 mm survey of the scuba half degree extragalactic survey(shades) fields is the largest (0.7 deg2) blank-field millimetre-wavelengthsurvey undertaken to date at a resolution of ~18" and a depth of ~1 mjy. wehave used the deep optical-to-radio multi-wavelength data in the shades lockmanhole east and sxdf/uds fields to obtain galaxy identifications for ~64% (~80%with tentative identifications) of the 148 aztec-shades 1.1 mm sources,exploiting deep radio and 24 um data complemented by methods based on 8 umflux-density and red optical-infrared (i-k) colour. this unusually highidentification rate can be attributed to the relatively brightmillimetre-wavelength flux-density threshold, combined with the relatively deepsupporting multi-frequency data. we have further exploited theoptical-mid-infrared-radio data to derive a ~60% (~75% with tentativeidentifications) complete redshift distribution for the aztec-shades sources,yielding a median redshift of z~2.2, with a high-redshift tail extending to atleast z~4. despite the larger area probed by the aztec survey relative to theoriginal scuba shades imaging, the redshift distribution of the aztec sourcesis consistent with that displayed by the scuba sources, and reinforcestentative evidence that the redshift distribution of mm/sub-mm sources in thelockman hole field is significantly different from that found in the sxdf/udsfield. comparison with simulated surveys of similar scale extracted fromsemi-analytic models based on the millennium simulation indicates that this isas expected if the mm/sub-mm sources are massive (m&gt;10^11 mo) star-forminggalaxies tracing large-scale structures over scales of 10-20 mpc. this confirmsthe importance of surveys covering several square degrees (as now underway withscuba2) to obtain representative samples of bright (sub)mm-selected galaxies.

1205.6818	locuss: a dynamical analysis of x-ray agn in local clusters	we present a study of the distribution of x-ray agn in a representativesample of 26 massive clusters at 0.15&lt;z&lt;0.30, combining chandra observationswith highly complete spectroscopy of cluster members down to m_k*+2. in totalwe identify 48 x-ray agn among the cluster members, with luminosities2x10^41-1x10^44erg/s. in the stacked caustic diagram, the x-ray agn appear topreferentially lie along the caustics, suggestive of an infalling population.they also appear to avoid the region with lowest cluster-centric radii andrelative velocities (r_proj&lt;0.4 r_500; |v-&lt;v&gt;|/sigma_v&lt;0.8), which is dominatedby the virialized population of galaxies accreted earliest into the clusters.moreover the velocity dispersion of the 48 x-ray agn is 1.51x that of theoverall cluster population, which is consistent with the sqrt(2) ratio expectedby simple energetic arguments when comparing infalling versus virializedpopulations. this kinematic segregation is significant at the 4.66-sigma level.when splitting the x-ray agn sample into two according to x-ray or infrared(ir) luminosity, both x-ray bright and ir-bright sub-samples show highervelocity dispersions than their x-ray dim and ir-dim counterparts at &gt;2sigmasignificance. this is consistent with the nuclear activity responsible for thex-ray and ir emission being slowly shut down as the host galaxies are accretedinto the cluster. overall our results provide the strongest observationalevidence to date that x-ray agn found in massive clusters are an infallingpopulation, and that the cluster environment very effectively suppressesradiatively-efficient nuclear activity in its member galaxies. these resultsare consistent with the view that for galaxies to host an x-ray agn they shouldbe the central galaxy within their dark matter halo and have a ready supply ofcold gas.

0711.1902	mid-infrared spectroscopy of lensed galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;3: the nature of  sources near the mips confusion limit	we present spitzer/irs mid-infrared spectra for 15 gravitationally lensed, 24micron--selected galaxies, and combine the results with 4 additional very faintgalaxies with irs spectra in the literature. the median intrinsic 24 micronflux density of the sample is 130 microjy, enabling a systematic survey of thespectral properties of the very faint 24 micron sources that dominate thenumber counts of spitzer cosmological surveys. six of the 19 galaxy spectra(32%) show the strong mid-ir continuua expected of agn; x-ray detectionsconfirm the presence of agn in three of these cases, and reveal agns in twoother galaxies. these results suggest that nuclear accretion may contributemore flux to faint 24 micron--selected samples than previously assumed. almostall the spectra show some aromatic (pah) emission features; the measuredaromatic flux ratios do not show evolution from z=0. in particular, the highs/n mid-ir spectrum of smm j163554.2+661225 agrees remarkably well withlow--redshift, lower--luminosity templates. we compare the rest-frame 8 micronand total infrared luminosities of star--forming galaxies, and find that thebehavior of this ratio with total ir luminosity has evolved modestly from z=2to z=0. since the high aromatic--to--continuum flux ratios in these galaxiesrule out a dominant contribution by agn, this finding implies systematicevolution in the structure and/or metallicity of infrared sources withredshift. it also has implications for the estimates of star forming ratesinferred from 24 micron measurements, in the sense that at z ~2, a givenobserved frame 24 micron luminosity corresponds to a lower bolometricluminosity than would be inferred from low-redshift templates of similarluminosity at the corresponding rest wavelength.

1207.2174	discovery of "warm dust" galaxies in clusters at z~0.3: evidence for  stripping of cool dust in the dense environment?	using far-infrared imaging from the "herschel lensing survey", we derive dustproperties of spectroscopically-confirmed cluster member galaxies within twomassive systems at z~0.3: the merging bullet cluster and the more relaxedms2137.3-2353. most star-forming cluster sources (~90%) have characteristicdust temperatures similar to local field galaxies of comparable infrared (ir)luminosity (t_dust ~ 30k). several sub-lirg (l_ir &lt; 10^11 l_sun) bullet clustermembers are much warmer (t_dust &gt; 37k) with far-infrared spectral energydistribution (sed) shapes resembling lirg-type local templates. x-ray andmid-infrared data suggest that obscured active galactic nuclei do notcontribute significantly to the infrared flux of these "warm dust" galaxies.sources of comparable ir-luminosity and dust temperature are not observed inthe relaxed cluster ms2137, although the significance is too low to speculateon an origin involving recent cluster merging. "warm dust" galaxies are,however, statistically rarer in field samples (&gt; 3sigma), indicating that theresponsible mechanism may relate to the dense environment. the spatialdistribution of these sources is similar to the whole far-infrared brightpopulation, i.e. preferentially located in the cluster periphery, although thegalaxy hosts tend towards lower stellar masses (m_* &lt; 10^10 m_sun). we proposedust stripping and heating processes which could be responsible for theunusually warm characteristic dust temperatures. a normal star-forming galaxywould need 30-50% of its dust removed (preferentially stripped from the outerreaches, where dust is typically cooler) to recover a sed similar to a "warmdust" galaxy. these progenitors would not require a higher ir-luminosity ordust mass than the currently observed normal star-forming population.

1208.2962	a massive, cooling-flow-induced starburst in the core of a highly  luminous galaxy cluster	in the cores of some galaxy clusters the hot intracluster plasma is denseenough that it should cool radiatively in the cluster's lifetime, leading tocontinuous "cooling flows" of gas sinking towards the cluster center, yet nosuch cooling flow has been observed. the low observed star formation rates andcool gas masses for these "cool core" clusters suggest that much of the coolingmust be offset by astrophysical feedback to prevent the formation of a runawaycooling flow. here we report x-ray, optical, and infrared observations of thegalaxy cluster spt-clj2344-4243 at z = 0.596. these observations reveal anexceptionally luminous (l_2-10 kev = 8.2 x 10^45 erg/s) galaxy cluster whichhosts an extremely strong cooling flow (dm/dt = 3820 +/- 530 msun/yr). further,the central galaxy in this cluster appears to be experiencing a massivestarburst (740 +/- 160 msun/yr), which suggests that the feedback sourceresponsible for preventing runaway cooling in nearby cool core clusters may notyet be fully established in spt-clj2344-4243. this large star formation rateimplies that a significant fraction of the stars in the central galaxy of thiscluster may form via accretion of the intracluster medium, rather than thecurrent picture of central galaxies assembling entirely via mergers.

1301.4549	enhanced warm h2 emission in the compact group mid-infrared "green  valley"	we present results from a spitzer, mid-infrared spectroscopy study of asample of 74 galaxies located in 23 hickson compact groups, chosen to be at adynamically-active stage of hi depletion. we find evidence for enhanced warm h2emission (i.e. above that associated with uv excitation in star-formingregions) in 14 galaxies (~20%), with 8 galaxies having extreme values of l(h2s(0)-s(3))/l(7.7micron pah), in excess of 0.07. such emission has been seenpreviously in the compact group hcg 92 (stephan's quintet), and was shown to beassociated with the dissipation of mechanical energy associated with alarge-scale shock caused when one group member collided, at high velocity, withtidal debris in the intragroup medium. similarly, shock excitation or turbulentheating is likely responsible for the enhanced h2 emission in the compact groupgalaxies, since other sources of heating (uv or x-ray excitation from starformation or agn) are insufficient to account for the observed emission. thegroup galaxies fall predominantly in a region of mid-infrared color-color spaceidentified by previous studies as being connected to rapid transformations inhcg galaxy evolution. furthermore, the majority of h2-enhanced galaxies lie inthe optical "green valley" between the blue cloud and red-sequence, and areprimarily early-type disk systems. we suggest that h2-enhanced systems mayrepresent a specific phase in the evolution of galaxies in dense environmentsand provide new insight into mechanisms which transform galaxies onto theoptical red sequence.

1307.1135	locuss: the steady decline and slow quenching of star formation in  cluster galaxies over the last four billion years	we present an analysis of the levels and evolution of star formation activityin a representative sample of 30 massive galaxy clusters at 0.15&lt;z&lt;0.30 fromthe local cluster substructure survey (locuss), combining wide-field spitzer24um data with extensive spectroscopy of cluster members. the specific-sfrs ofmassive (m&gt;10^10 m_sun) star-forming cluster galaxies within r200 are found tobe systematically 28% lower than their counterparts in the field at fixedstellar mass and redshift, a difference significant at the 8.7-sigma level.this is the unambiguous signature of star formation in most (and possibly all)massive star-forming galaxies being slowly quenched upon accretion into massiveclusters, their sfrs declining exponentially on quenching time-scales in therange 0.7-2.0 gyr. we measure the mid-infrared butcher-oemler effect over theredshift range 0.0-0.4, finding rapid evolution in the fraction (f_sf) ofmassive (m_k&lt;-23.1) cluster galaxies within r200 with sfrs&gt;3m_sun/yr, of theform f_sf (1+z)^7.6. we dissect the origins of the butcher-oemler effect,revealing it to be due to the combination of a ~3x decline in the meanspecific-sfrs of star-forming cluster galaxies since z~0.3 with a ~1.5xdecrease in number density. two-thirds of this reduction in the specific-sfrsof star-forming cluster galaxies is due to the steady cosmic decline in thespecific-sfrs among those field galaxies accreted into the clusters. theremaining one-third reflects an accelerated decline in the star formationactivity of galaxies within clusters. the slow quenching of star-formation incluster galaxies is consistent with a gradual shut down of star formation ininfalling spiral galaxies as they interact with the intra-cluster medium viaram-pressure stripping or starvation mechanisms. we find no evidence for thebuild-up of cluster s0 bulges via major nuclear star-burst episodes.

0802.0497	the scuba half degree extragalactic survey (shades) - vii. optical/ir  photometry and stellar masses of sub-millimeter galaxies	we present estimates of the photometric redshifts, stellar masses and starformation histories of sources in the scuba half degree extragalactic survey(shades). this paper describes the 60 scuba sources detected in the lockmanhole covering an area of ~320 square arcmin. using photometry spanning the bband to 8um, we find that the average scuba source forms a significant fractionof its stars in an early period of star formation and that most of theremainder forms in a shorter more intense burst around the redshift it isobserved. this trend does not vary significantly with source redshift but theexact ratio of early to late mass is quite sensitive to the way extinction istreated in the modelling. however, the sources show a clear increase in stellarmass with redshift, consistent with downsizing. in terms of sed types, only twoout of the 51 sources we have obtained photometric redshifts for are best fitby a quasar-like spectral energy distribution, with approximately 80 per centof the sources being best fit with late-type spectra (sc, im and starburst). byincluding photometry at 850um, we conclude that the average scuba source isforming stars at a rate somewhere between 6 and 30 times the rate implied fromthe rest-frame optical in a dust obscured burst and that this burst creates15-65 per cent of the total stellar mass. using a simplistic calculation, weestimate from the average star formation history that between one in five andone in 15 bright (l_* +2 mag &lt; l_optical &lt; l_* -1 mag) galaxies in the fieldover the interval 0 &lt; z &lt; 3 will at some point in their lifetime experience asimilar energetic dusty burst of star formation. finally, we compute theevolution of the star formation rate density and find it peaks around z=2.

1401.8263	the first frontier fields cluster: 4.5{\mu}m excess in a z~8 galaxy  candidate in abell 2744	we present in this letter the first analysis of a z~8 galaxy candidate foundin the hubble and spitzer imaging data of abell 2744, as part of the hubblefrontier fields legacy program. we applied the most commonly-used methods toselect exceptionally high-z galaxies by combining non-detection andcolor-criteria using seven hst bands. we used galfit on irac images for fittingand subtracting contamination of bright nearby sources. the physical propertieshave been inferred from sed-fitting using templates with and without nebularemission. this letter is focussed on the brightest candidate we found(m$_{f160w}$=26.2) over the 4.9 arcmin$^2$ field of view covered by the wfc3.it shows a non-detection in the acs bands and at 3.6{\mu}m whereas it isclearly detected at 4.5{\mu}m with rather similar depths. this break in theirac data could be explained by strong [oiii]+h{\beta} lines at z~8 whichcontribute to the 4.5{\mu}m photometry. the best photo-z is found atz~8.0$^{+0.2}_{-0.5}$, although solutions at low-redshift (z~1.9) cannot becompletely excluded, but they are strongly disfavoured by the sed-fitting work.the amplification factor is relatively small at {\mu}=1.49$\pm$0.02. the starformation rate in this object is ranging from 8 to 60 mo/yr, the stellar massis in the order of m$_{\star}$=(2.5-10) x 10$^{9}$mo and the size isr~0.35$\pm$0.15 kpc. this object is one of the first z~8 lbg candidates showinga clear break between 3.6{\mu}m and 4.5{\mu}m which is consistent with the iracproperties of the first spectroscopically confirmed galaxy at a similarredshift. due to its brightness, the redshift of this object could potentiallybe confirmed by near infrared spectroscopy with current 8-10m telescopes. thenature of this candidate will be revealed in the coming months with the arrivalof new acs and spitzer data, increasing the depth at optical and near-irwavelengths.

1403.4249	a $10^{10}$ solar mass flow of molecular gas in the abell 1835 brightest  cluster galaxy	we report alma early science observations of the abell 1835 brightest clustergalaxy (bcg) in the co (3-2) and co (1-0) emission lines. we detect $5\times10^{10}~\rm m_\odot$ of molecular gas within 10 kpc of the bcg. its ensemblevelocity profile width of $\sim 130 ~\rm km~s^{-1}$ fwhm is too narrow for themolecular cloud sto be supported in the galaxy by dynamic pressure. the gas mayinstead be supported in a rotating, turbulent disk oriented nearly face-on.roughly $10^{10}~\rm m_\odot$ of molecular gas is projected $3-10 ~\rm kpc$ tothe north-west and to the east of the nucleus with line of sight velocitieslying between $-250 ~\rm km~s^{-1}$ to $+480 ~\rm km~s^{-1}$ with respect tothe systemic velocity. the high velocity gas may be either inflowing oroutflowing. however, the absence of high velocity gas toward the nucleus thatwould be expected in a steady inflow, and its bipolar distribution on eitherside of the nucleus, are more naturally explained as outflow. star formationand radiation from the agn are both incapable of driving an outflow of thismagnitude. if so, the molecular outflow may be associated a hot outflow onlarger scales reported by kirkpatrick and colleagues. the molecular gas flowrate of approximately $200~\rm m_\odot ~yr^{-1}$ is comparable to the starformation rate of $100-180~\rm m_\odot ~yr^{-1}$ in the central disk. how radiobubbles would lift dense molecular gas in their updrafts, how much gas will belost to the bcg, and how much will return to fuel future star formation and agnactivity are poorly understood. our results imply that radio-mechanical (radiomode) feedback not only heats hot atmospheres surrounding elliptical galaxiesand bcgs, it is able to sweep higher density molecular gas away from theircenters.

0802.4292	strong lensing in abell 1703: constraints on the slope of the inner dark  matter distribution	in this article, we apply strong lensing techniques in abell 1703, a massivex-ray luminous galaxy cluster at z=0.28. our analysis is based on imaging databoth from space and ground in 8 bands, complemented with a spectroscopicsurvey. abell 1703 looks rather circular from the general shape of its multiplyimaged systems and present a dominant giant elliptical cd galaxy in its centre.this cluster exhibits a remarkable bright 'central ring' formed by 4 brightimages at z_{spec}=0.888 located very close to the cd galaxy, providingobservational constraints that are potentially very interesting to probe thecentral mass distribution. the stellar contribution from the cd galaxy (~1.2510^{12} m_{sun} within 7") is accounted for in our parametric mass modelling,and the underlying smooth dark matter component distribution is described usinga generalized nfw profile parametrized with a central logarithmic slope \alpha.we find that within the range where observational constraints are present (from~5" to ~50"), the slope of the dark matter distribution in abell1703 is equalto 1.09^{+0.05}_{-0.11} (3\sigma confidence level). the concentration parameteris equal to c_{200} ~ 3.5, and the scale radius is constrained to be largerthan the region where observational constraints are available. within thisradius, the 2d mass is equal to m(50")=2.4 10^{14} m_{\sun}. we cannot draw anyconclusions on cosmological models at this point since we lack results fromrealistic numerical simulations containing baryons to make a proper comparison.we advocate the need for a sample of observed and simulated unimodal relaxedgalaxy clusters in order to make reliable comparisons, and potentially providea test of cosmological models.

1405.1046	star formation in the massive cluster merger abell 2744	we present a comprehensive study of star-forming (sf) galaxies in the hstfrontier field recent cluster merger a2744 (z=0.308). wide-field,ultraviolet-infrared (uv-ir) imaging enables a direct constraint of the totalstar formation rate (sfr) for 53 cluster galaxies, with sfr{uv+ir}=343+/-10msun/yr. within the central 4 arcmin (1.1 mpc) radius, the integrated sfr iscomplete, yielding a total sfr{uv+ir}=201+/-9 msun/yr. focussing on obscuredstar formation, this core region exhibits a total sfr{ir}=138+/-8 msun/yr, amass-normalised sfr{ir} of sigma{sfr}=11.2+/-0.7 msun/yr per 10^14 msun and afraction of ir-detected sf galaxies f{sf}=0.080(+0.010,-0.037). overall, thecluster population at z~0.3 exhibits significant intrinsic scatter in irproperties (total sfr{ir}, tdust distribution) apparently unrelated to thedynamical state: a2744 is noticeably different to the merging bullet cluster,but similar to several relaxed clusters. however, in a2744 we identify a trailof sf sources including jellyfish galaxies with substantial unobscured sf dueto extreme stripping (sfr{uv}/sfr{ir} up to 3.3). the orientation of the trail,and of material stripped from constituent galaxies, indicates that the passingshock front of the cluster merger was the trigger. constraints on starformation from both ir and uv are crucial for understanding galaxy evolutionwithin the densest environments.

1405.3303	mass and magnification maps for the hubble space telescope frontier  fields clusters: implications for high redshift studies	extending over three hubble space telescope (hst) cycles, the hubble frontierfields (hff) initiative constitutes the largest commitment ever of hst time tothe exploration of the distant universe via gravitational lensing by massivegalaxy clusters. we here present models of the mass distribution in the six hffcluster lenses, derived from a joint strong- and weak-lensing analysis anchoredby a total of 88 multiple-image systems identified in existing hst data. theresulting maps of the projected mass distribution and of the gravitationalmagnification effectively calibrate the hff clusters as gravitationaltelescopes. allowing the computation of search areas in the source plane, thesemaps are provided to the community to facilitate the exploitation offorthcoming hff data for quantitative studies of the gravitationally lensedpopulation of background galaxies. our models of the gravitationalmagnification afforded by the hff clusters allow us to quantify thelensing-induced boost in sensitivity over blank-field observations and predictthat galaxies at $z&gt;10$ and as faint as m(ab)=32 will be detectable, up to 2magnitudes fainter than the limit of the hubble ultra deep field.

1405.3412	mining the gap: evolution of the magnitude gap in x-ray galaxy groups  from the 3 square degree xmm coverage of cfhtls	we present a catalog of 129 x-ray galaxy groups, covering a redshift range0.04&lt;z&lt;1.23, selected in the ~3 square degree part of the cfhtls w1 fieldoverlapping xmm observations performed under the xmm-lss project. we carry outa statistical study of the redshift evolution out to redshift one of themagnitude gap between the first and the second brightest cluster galaxies of awell defined mass-selected group sample. we find that the slope of the relationbetween the fraction of groups and the magnitude gap steepens with redshift,indicating a larger fraction of fossil groups at lower redshifts. we find that22.2$\pm$6% of our groups at z$\leq$0.6 are fossil groups. we compare ourresults with the predictions of three semi-analytic models based on themillennium simulation. the intercept of the relation between the magnitude ofthe brightest galaxy and the value of magnitude gap becomes brighter withincreasing redshift. this trend is steeper than the model predictions which weattribute to the younger stellar age of the observed brightest clustergalaxies. this trend argues in favor of stronger evolution of the feedback fromactive galactic nuclei at z&lt;1 compared to the models. the slope of the relationbetween the magnitude of the brightest cluster galaxy and the value of the gapdoes not evolve with redshift and is well reproduced by the models, indicatingthat the tidal galaxy stripping, put forward as an explanation of theoccurrence of the magnitude gap, is both a dominant mechanism and issufficiently well modeled.

1405.5280	near-infrared brightness of the galilean satellites eclipsed in jovian  shadow: a new technique to investigate jovian upper atmosphere	we have discovered that europa, ganymede and callisto are bright around 1.5{\mu}m even when not directly lit by sunlight, based on observations from thehubble space telescope and the subaru telescope. the observations wereconducted with non-sidereal tracking on jupiter outside of the field of view toreduce the stray light subtraction uncertainty due to the close proximity ofjupiter. their eclipsed luminosity was $10^{-6}$-$10^{-7}$ of their uneclipsedbrightness, which is low enough that this phenomenon has been undiscovereduntil now. in addition, europa in eclipse was &lt;1/10 of the others at 1.5{\mu}m, a potential clue to the origin of the source of luminosity. likewise,ganymede observations were attempted at 3.6 {\mu}m by the spitzer spacetelescope but it was not detected, suggesting a significant wavelengthdependence. the reason why they are luminous even when in the jovian shadow isstill unknown, but forward-scattered sunlight by haze in the jovian upperatmosphere is proposed as the most plausible candidate. if this is the case,observations of these galilean satellites while eclipsed by the jovian shadowprovide us a new technique to investigate jovian atmospheric composition, andinvestigating the transmission spectrum of jupiter by this method is importantfor investigating the atmosphere of extrasolar giant planets by transitspectroscopy.

1410.8769	cfhtlens: weak lensing calibrated scaling relations for low mass  clusters of galaxies	we present weak lensing and x-ray analysis of 12 low mass clusters from thecfhtlens and xmm-cfhtls surveys. we combine these systems with high-masssystems from cccp and low-mass systems from cosmos to obtain a sample of 70systems, spanning over two orders of magnitude in mass. we measure core-excisedlx-tx, m-lx and m-tx scaling relations and include corrections forobservational biases. by providing fully bias corrected relations, we give thecurrent limitations for lx and tx as cluster mass proxies. we demonstrate thattx benefits from a significantly lower intrinsic scatter at fixed mass than lx.by studying the residuals of the bias corrected relations, we show for thefirst time using weak lensing masses that galaxy groups seem more luminous andwarmer for their mass than clusters. this implies a steepening of the m-lx andm-tx relations at low masses. we verify the inferred steepening using adifferent high mass sample from the literature and show that variance betweensamples is the dominant effect leading to discrepant scaling relations. wedivide our sample into subsamples of merging and relaxed systems, and find thatmergers may have enhanced scatter in lensing measurements, most likely due tostronger triaxiality and more substructure. for the lx-tx relation, which isunaffected by lensing measurements, we find the opposite trend in scatter. wealso explore the effects of x-ray cross-calibration and find that chandracalibration leads to flatter lx-tx and m-tx relations than xmm-newton.

1502.03842	alma detection of [cii] 158 micron emission from a strongly lensed z=2  star-forming galaxy	our objectives are to determine the properties of the interstellar medium(ism) and of star-formation in typical star-forming galaxies at high redshift.following up on our previous multi-wavelength observations with hst, spitzer,herschel, and the plateau de bure interferometer (pdbi), we have studied astrongly lensed z=2.013 galaxy, the arc behind the galaxy cluster macsj0451+0006, with alma to measure the [cii] 158 micron emission line, one of themain coolants of the ism. [cii] emission from the southern part of this galaxyis detected at 10 $\sigma$. taking into account strong gravitational lensing,which provides a magnification of $\mu=49$, the intrinsic lensing-corrected[cii]158 micron luminosity is $l(cii)=1.2 \times 10^8 l_\odot$. the observedratio of [cii]-to-ir emission, $l(cii)/l(fir) \approx (1.2-2.4) \times10^{-3}$, is found to be similar to that in nearby galaxies. the same alsoholds for the observed ratio $l(cii)/l(co)=2.3 \times 10^3$, which iscomparable to that of star-forming galaxies and active galaxy nuclei (agn) atlow redshift. we utilize strong gravitational lensing to extend diagnosticstudies of the cold ism to an order of magnitude lower luminosity ($l(ir) \sim(1.1-1.3) \times 10^{11} l_\odot$) and sfr than previous work at high redshift.while larger samples are needed, our results provide evidence that the cold ismof typical high redshift galaxies has physical characteristics similar tonormal star forming galaxies in the local universe.

1504.05604	locuss: the slow quenching of star formation in cluster galaxies and the  need for pre-processing	we present a study of the spatial distribution and kinematics of star-forminggalaxies in 30 massive clusters at 0.15&lt;z&lt;0.30, combining wide-field spitzer24um and galex nuv imaging with highly-complete spectroscopy of clustermembers. the fraction (f_sf) of star-forming cluster galaxies rises steadilywith cluster-centric radius, increasing fivefold by 2r200, but remains wellbelow field values even at 3r200. this suppression of star formation at largeradii cannot be reproduced by models in which star formation is quenched ininfalling field galaxies only once they pass within r200 of the cluster, but isconsistent with some of them being first pre-processed within galaxy groups.despite the increasing f_sf-radius trend, the surface density of star-forminggalaxies actually declines steadily with radius, falling ~15x from the core to2r200. this requires star-formation to survive within recently accreted spiralsfor 2--3gyr to build up the apparent over-density of star-forming galaxieswithin clusters. the velocity dispersion profile of the star-forming galaxypopulation shows a sharp peak of 1.44-sigma_v at 0.3r500, and is 10--35% higherthan that of the inactive cluster members at all cluster-centric radii, whiletheir velocity distribution shows a flat, top-hat profile within r500. all ofthese results are consistent with star-forming cluster galaxies being aninfalling population, but one that must also survive ~0.5--2gyr beyond passingwithin r200. by comparing the observed distribution of star-forming galaxies inthe stacked caustic diagram with predictions from the millennium simulation, weobtain a best-fit model in which sfrs decline exponentially on quenchingtime-scales of 1.73\pm0.25 gyr upon accretion into the cluster.

1506.01323	s-candels: the spitzer-cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic  survey. survey design, photometry, and deep irac source counts	the spitzer-cosmic assembly deep near-infrared extragalactic legacy survey(s-candels; pi g. fazio) is a cycle 8 exploration program designed to detectgalaxies at very high redshifts (z &gt; 5). to mitigate the effects of cosmicvariance and also to take advantage of deep coextensive coverage in multiplebands by the hubble space telescope multi-cycle treasury program candels,s-candels was carried out within five widely separated extragalactic fields:the ukidss ultra-deep survey, the extended chandra deep field south, cosmos,the hst deep field north, and the extended groth strip. s-candels builds uponthe existing coverage of these fields from the spitzer extended deep survey(seds) by increasing the integration time from 12 hours to a total of 50 hoursbut within a smaller area, 0.16 square degrees. the additional depthsignificantly increases the survey completeness at faint magnitudes. this paperdescribes the s-candels survey design, processing, and publicly-available dataproducts. we present irac dual-band 3.6+4.5 micron catalogs reaching to a depthof 26.5 ab mag. deep irac counts for the roughly 135,000 galaxies detected bys-candels are consistent with models based on known galaxy populations. theincrease in depth beyond earlier spitzer/irac surveys does not reveal asignificant additional contribution from discrete sources to the diffuse cosmicinfrared background (cib). thus it remains true that only roughly half of theestimated cib flux from cobe/dirbe is resolved.

1508.02453	the relation between luminous agns and star formation in their host  galaxies	we study the relation of active galactic nuclei (agns) to star formation intheir host galaxies. our sample includes 205 type-1 and 85 type-2 agns, 162detected with herschel, from fields surrounding 30 galaxy clusters in the localcluster substructure survey (locuss). the sample is identified by optical linewidths and ratios after selection to be brighter than 1 mjy at 24 microns. weshow that type-2 agn [oiii]5007 line fluxes at high z can be contaminated bytheir host galaxies with typical spectrograph entrance apertures (but oursample is not compromised in this way). we use spectral energy distribution(sed) templates to decompose the galaxy seds and estimate star formation rates,agn luminosities, and host galaxy stellar masses (described in an accompanyingpaper). the agns arise from massive black holes (~ 3 x 10^8 msun) accreting at~ 10% of the eddington rate and residing in galaxies with stellar mass &gt; 3 x10^{10} msun; those detected with herschel have ir luminosity from starformation in the range of 10^{10} -- 10^{12} lsun. we find that: 1.) thespecific star formation rates in the host galaxies are generally consistentwith those of normal star-forming (main sequence) galaxies; 2.) there is astrong correlation between the luminosities from star formation and the agn;and 3.) however, the correlation may not result from a causal connection, butcould arise because the black hole mass (and hence agn eddington luminosity)and star formation are both correlated with the galaxy mass.

0705.3668	an unusually brilliant transient in the galaxy messier 85	historically, variable and transient sources have both surprised astronomersand provided new views of the heavens. here we report the discovery of anoptical transient in the outskirts of the lenticular galaxy messier 85 in thevirgo cluster. with a peak absolute r magnitude of -12 this event is distinctlybrighter than novae, but fainter than type ia supernovae (expected from apopulation of old stars in lenticular galaxies). archival images of the fielddo not show a luminous star at that position with an upper limit of ~-4.1, soit is unlikely to be a giant eruption from a luminous blue variable star. overa two month period the transient emitted radiation energy of almost 10e47 ergand subsequently faded in the opical sky. it is similar to, but more luminousat peak by a factor of 6 than, an enigmatic transient in the galaxy m31. apossible origin of m85 ot2006-1 is a stellar merger. if so, searches forsimilar events in nearby galaxies will not only allow to study the physics ofhyper-eddington sources, but also probe an important phase in the evolution ofstellar binary systems.

astro-ph;0106172	high resolution mid-infrared imaging of infrared luminous starburst  galaxies	observations for seven infrared luminous starburst galaxies are reported inthe mid-infrared from 8 - 18 microns using the keck telescopes with spatialresolution approaching the diffraction limit. all of the galaxies observed showevidence of strong interactions based on optical morphologies. for thesegalaxies, a substantial fraction, usually more than 50%, of the infraredluminosity is generated in regions ranging in sizes from 100pc -- 1 kpc.nuclear starbursts often dominate the infrared luminosity, but this is notalways true. in some galaxies, most notably ngc 6090, substantial infraredluminosity greatly in excess of the nuclear luminosity is generated in regionsassociated with the physical interaction between two galaxies. the radioemission is a good tracer of the location of high luminosity young stars. thevisual/ultraviolet radiation output of the nearby star forming galaxies isdominated by emission from regions that are generally not producing the copiousinfrared luminosity of the systems. the regions of high infrared luminosity inlocal starburst galaxies are significantly smaller than the galaxies as awhole. the integrated spectral energy distributions (seds) of these galaxiesare very different from the seds of the regions of star formation. if the sedsof star-forming regions in these galaxies reflect the seds found in forminggalaxies at high redshift, the distant galaxies should be dominated by the midand far-infrared luminosity output far more than the integrated luminous outputof nearby starburst galaxies would suggest.

astro-ph;0212175	near-infrared observations of powerful high-redshift radio galaxies: 4c  40.36 and 4c 39.37	we present near-infrared imaging and spectroscopic observations of two fr iihigh-redshift radio galaxies (hzrgs), 4c 40.36 (z=2.3) and 4c 39.37 (z=3.2),obtained with the hubble, keck, and hale telescopes. high resolution imageswere taken with filters both in and out of strong emission lines, and togetherwith the spectroscopic data, the properties of the line and continuum emissionswere carefully analyzed. our analysis of 4c 40.36 and 4c 39.37 shows thatstrong emission lines (e.g., [o iii] 5007 a and h alpha+[n ii]) contribute tothe broad-band fluxes much more significantly than previously estimated (80%vs. 20-40%), and that when the continuum sources are imaged through line-freefilters, they show an extremely compact morphology with a high surfacebrightness. if we use the r^1/4-law parametrization, their effective radii(r(e)) are only 2-3 kpc while their restframe b-band surface brightnesses atr(e) are i(b) ~ 18 mag/arcsec^2. compared with z ~ 1 3cr radio galaxies, theformer is x3-5 smaller, while the latter is 1-1.5 mag brighter than what ispredicted from the i(b)-r(e) correlation. although exponential profiles produceequally good fits for 4c 40.36 and 4c 39.37, this clearly indicates that withrespect to the z~1 3cr radio galaxies, the light distribution of these twohzrgs is much more centrally concentrated. spectroscopically, 4c 40.36 shows aflat (fnu=const) continuum while 4c 39.37 shows a spectrum as red as that of alocal giant elliptical galaxy. although this difference may be explained interms of a varying degree of star formation, the similarities of their surfacebrightness profiles and the submillimeter detection of 4c 39.37 might suggestthat the intrinsic spectra is equally blue (young stars or an agn), and thatthe difference is the amount of reddening.

astro-ph;0406035	the 24 micron source counts in deep spitzer surveys	galaxy source counts in the infrared provide strong constraints on theevolution of the bolometric energy output from distant galaxy populations. wepresent the results from deep 24 micron imaging from spitzer surveys, whichinclude approximately 50,000 sources to an 80% completeness of 60 ujy. the 24micron counts rapidly rise at near-euclidean rates down to 5 mjy, increase witha super-euclidean rate between 0.4 - 4 mjy, and converge below 0.3 mjy. the 24micron counts exceed expectations from non-evolving models by a factor &gt;10 at0.1 mjy. the peak in the differential number counts corresponds to a populationof faint sources that is not expected from predictions based on 15 microncounts from iso. we argue that this implies the existence of a previouslyundetected population of infrared-luminous galaxies at z ~ 1-3. integrating thecounts to 60 ujy, we derive a lower limit on the 24 micron background intensityof 1.9 +/- 0.6 nw m-2 sr-1 of which the majority (~ 60%) stems from sourcesfainter than 0.4 mjy. extrapolating to fainter flux densities, sources below 60ujy contribute 0.8 {+0.9/-0.4} nw m-2 sr-1 to the background, which provides anestimate of the total 24 micron background of 2.7 {+1.1/-0.7} nw m-2 sr-1.

astro-ph;0502079	reduction algorithms for the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer	we describe the data reduction algorithms for the multiband imagingphotometer for spitzer (mips) instrument. these algorithms were based onextensive preflight testing and modeling of the si:as (24 micron) and ge:ga (70and 160 micron) arrays in mips and have been refined based on initial flightdata. the behaviors we describe are typical of state-of-the-art infrared focalplanes operated in the low backgrounds of space. the ge arrays are bulkphotoconductors and therefore show a variety of artifacts that must be removedto calibrate the data. the si array, while better behaved than the ge arrays,does show a handful of artifacts that also must be removed to calibrate thedata. the data reduction to remove these effects is divided into three parts.the first part converts the non-destructively read data ramps into slopes whileremoving artifacts with time constants of the order of the exposure time. thesecond part calibrates the slope measurements while removing artifacts withtime constants longer than the exposure time. the third part uses theredundancy inherit in the mips observing modes to improve the artifact removaliteratively. for each of these steps, we illustrate the relevant laboratoryexperiments or theoretical arguments along with the mathematical approachestaken to calibrate the data. finally, we describe how these preflightalgorithms have performed on actual flight data.

astro-ph;0511507	infrared power-law galaxies in the chandra deep field south: agn and  ulirgs	we investigate the nature of a sample of 92 spitzer/mips 24 micron selectedgalaxies in the cdfs, showing power law-like emission in the spitzer/irac 3.6-8micron bands. the main goal is to determine whether the galaxies not detectedin x-rays (47% of the sample) are part of the hypothetical population ofobscured agn not detected even in deep x-ray surveys. the majority of the irpower-law galaxies are ulirgs at z&gt;1, and those with lirg-like ir luminositiesare usually detected in x-rays. the optical to ir spectral energy distributions(seds) of the x-ray detected galaxies are almost equally divided between ablagn sed class (similar to an optically selected qso) and a nlagn sed (similarto the blagn sed but with an obscured uv/optical continuum). a small fractionof seds resemble warm ulirg galaxies (e.g., mrk231). most galaxies not detectedin x-rays have seds in the nlagn+ulirg class as they tend to be opticallyfainter, and possibly more obscured. moreover, the ir power-law galaxies haveseds significantly different from those of high-z (z_sp&gt;1) ir (24 micron)selected and optically bright (vvds i_ab&lt;=24) star-forming galaxies whose sedsshow a very prominent stellar bump at 1.6 micron. the galaxies detected inx-rays have 2-8 kev rest-frame luminosities typical of agn. the galaxies notdetected in x-rays have global x-ray to mid-ir sed properties that make themgood candidates to contain ir bright x-ray absorbed agn. if all these sourcesare actually obscured agn, we would observe a ratio of obscured to unobscured24 micron detected agn of 2:1, whereas models predict a ratio of up to 3:1.additional studies using spitzer to detect x-ray-quiet agn are likely to findmore such obscured sources.

astro-ph;0512357	an investigation of the submillimeter background radiation using scuba  and spitzer	we investigate the redshift dependence of the contribution to theextragalactic far-infrared/sub-millimeter background from galaxies detected bythe spitzer space telescope at 8um and 24um. using seven-band optical tomid-infrared photometry, we estimate photometric redshifts for the spitzersources which appear to be mostly l* galaxies at a median redshift of z=1.0.these sources, extracted from deep 8um and 24um mosaics of the cudss 14-hourfield with 5sigma limits of 5.8ujy and 70ujy respectively, exhibit significant850um and 450um emission as observed by scuba. at 850um, after removing&gt;=4sigma sources and those securely identified in our previous cross-matchingpaper, we measure stacked flux at the significance level of 4.4sigma and2.9sigma from the full 8um and 24um galaxy catalogue respectively. at 450um,flux is detected from all 8um galaxies at the level of 3.5sigma, while there isno significant emission from the 24um galaxies. we find that the 850um flux isemitted almost exclusively at z&gt;~1.3 from the spitzer sources with 0.44mjy(4.7sigma) per 8um source and 0.51mjy (2.8sigma) per 24um source. thiscorresponds to a contribution of (16+/-3)% toward the 850um extra-galacticbackground from the 8um sources and (5.0+/-1.8)% from the 24um sources. at450um, only the 8um sources within the redshift interval 1&lt;z&lt;2 exhibitsignificant emission with an average flux per source of 3.35mjy (3.0sigma).this is a contribution of (37+/-12)% to the 450um background.

astro-ph;0512618	mid-infrared properties of x-ray sources in the extended groth strip	mid-infrared observations of active galactic nuclei (agn) are important forunderstanding of the physical conditions around the central accretion engines.chandra and xmm-newton x-ray observations of a 300 arcmin^2 region in theextended groth strip are used to select a sample of~150 agn. the spitzerinstruments irac and mips detect 68-80% of these sources, which show a widerange of mid-infrared properties. about 40% of the sources have red power-lawspectral energy distributions (f_nu ~ nu^alpha, alpha&lt;0) in the 3.6-8 um iracbands. in these sources the central engine dominates the emission at both x-rayand ir wavelengths. another 40% of the sources have blue mid-ir spectral energydistributions (alpha&gt;0) with their infrared emission dominated by the hostgalaxy; the remaining 20% are not well-fit by a power law. published irac colorcriteria for agn select most of the red sources, but only some of the bluesources. as with all other known methods, selecting agn with mid-ir colors willnot produce a sample that is simultaneously complete and reliable. the irac sedtype does not directly correspond to x-ray spectral type (hard/soft). themid-ir properties of x-ray-detected lyman-break, radio, submillimeter, andoptically-faint sources vary widely and, for the most part, are not distinctfrom those of the general x-ray/infrared source population. x-ray sources emit6-11% of the integrated mid--ir light, making them significant contributors tothe cosmic infrared background.

astro-ph;0601582	the bolocam 1.1 mm lockman hole galaxy survey: sharc ii 350 micron  photometry and implications for spectral models, dust temperatures, and  redshift estimation	we present 350 micron photometry of all 17 galaxy candidates in the lockmanhole detected in a 1.1 mm bolocam survey. several of the galaxies werepreviously detected at 850 microns, at 1.2 mm, in the infrared by spitzer, andin the radio. nine of the bolocam galaxy candidates were detected at 350microns and two new candidates were serendipitously detected at 350 microns(bringing the total in the literature detected in this way to three). five ofthe galaxies have published spectroscopic redshifts, enabling investigation ofthe implied temperature ranges and a comparison of photometric redshifttechniques.  lambda = 350 microns lies near the spectral energy distribution peak for z =2.5 thermally emitting galaxies. thus, luminosities can be measured withoutextrapolating to the peak from detection wavelengths of lambda &gt; 850 microns.characteristically, the galaxy luminosities lie in the range 1.0 - 1.2 x 10^13l_solar, with dust temperatures in the range of 40 k to 70 k, depending on thechoice of spectral index and wavelength of unit optical depth. the implied dustmasses are 3 - 5 x 10^8 m_solar. we find that the far-infrared to radiorelation for star-forming ulirgs systematically overpredicts the radioluminosities and overestimates redshifts on the order of delta z ~ 1, whereasredshifts based on either on submillimeter data alone or the 1.6 micron stellarbump and pah features are more accurate.

astro-ph;0603656	spitzer observations of the brightest galaxies in x-ray-luminous  clusters	we have studied the infrared properties of the brightest cluster galaxies(bcgs) located in the cores of x-ray-luminous clusters at 0.15 &lt; z &lt; 0.35. themajority of the bcgs are not particularly infrared-luminous compared with othermassive early-type galaxies, suggesting that the cluster environment has littleinfluence on the infrared luminosities of the bcgs. the exceptions, however,are the bcgs in the three x-ray-brightest clusters in the sample, a1835, z3146,and a2390. these bcgs have a prominent far-infrared peak in their spectralenergy distributions (seds), and two of them (those in a1835 and z3146) can beclassified as luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs: l_{ir} &gt; 10^{11} l_{sun}).although radio agns are found to be prevalent among the bcgs, the infraredluminosities of these three bcgs, judged from the infrared sed signatures, arelikely to be powered by star formation. considering the overall trend thatclusters with shorter radiative gas cooling times harbor more infrared-luminousbcgs, the enhanced star formation may be caused by the cooling cluster gasaccreting onto the bcgs.

astro-ph;0605355	spitzer observations of z~3 lyman break galaxies: stellar masses and  mid-infrared properties	we describe the spectral energy distributions (seds) of lyman break galaxies(lbgs) at z~3 using deep mid-infrared and optical observations of the extendedgroth strip, obtained with irac and mips on board spitzer and from the ground,respectively. we focus on lbgs with detections at all four irac bands, inparticular the 26 galaxies with irac 8 micron band (rest--frame k-band)detections. we use stellar population synthesis models and probe the stellarcontent of these galaxies. based on best--fit continuous star-formation modelswe derive estimates of the stellar mass for these lbgs. as in previous studies,we find that a fraction of lbgs have very red colors and large estimatedstellar masses (m_stellar &gt; 5 x 10 ^{10} m_solar): the present spitzer dataallow us, for the first time, to study these massive lbgs in detail. we discussthe link between these lbgs and submm-luminous galaxies.we find that the numberdensity of these massive lbgs at high redshift is higher than predicted bycurrent semi-analytic models of galaxy evolution.

astro-ph;0607673	mid-infrared identification of 6 cm radio source counterparts in the  extended groth strip	a new 6-cm survey of almost 0.6 square degrees to a limit of 0.55-mjy/beam(10-sigma) finds 37 isolated radio sources and 7 radio source pairs (notnecessarily physical companions). irac counterparts are identified for at least92% of the radio sources within the area of deep irac coverage, which includes31 isolated sources and 6 pairs. this contrasts with an identification rate of&lt;74% to r&lt;23.95 in visible light. eight of the irac galaxies have power lawspectral energy distributions, implying that the mid-infrared emission comesfrom a powerful agn. the remaining 26 irac galaxies show stellar emission inthe mid-infrared, probably in most of these galaxies because the stellaremission is bright enough to outshine an underlying agn. the infrared colorssuggest that the majority of these galaxies are bulge-dominated and haveredshifts between approximately 0.5 and 1.0. visible spectra from the deep2redshift survey, available for 11 galaxies, are consistent with thissuggestion. the irac galaxies fall into two distinct groups in acolor-magnitude diagram, one group (the "stripe") includes all the agn. theother group (the "blue clump") has blue 3.6 to 8 micron colors and a smallrange of 8 micron magnitudes. this separation should be useful in classifyinggalaxies found in other radio surveys.

astro-ph;0609466	far-infrared characterization of an ultra-luminous starburst associated  with a massively-accreting black hole at z=1.15	as part of the "all wavelength extended groth strip international survey"(aegis), we describe the panchromatic characterization of an x-ray luminousactive galactic nucleus (agn) in a merging galaxy at z=1.15. this object isdetected at infrared (8mic, 24mic, 70mic, 160mic), submillimeter (850mic) andradio wavelengths, from which we derive a bolometric luminosity l_bol ~ 9x10^12lsol. we find that the agn clearly dominates the hot dust emission below 40micbut its total energetic power inferred from the hard x-rays is substantiallyless than the bolometric output of the system. about 50% of the infraredluminosity is indeed produced by a cold dust component that probably originatesfrom enshrouded star formation in the host galaxy. in the context of a coevalgrowth of stellar bulges and massive black holes, this source might represent a``transition'' object sharing properties with both quasars and luminousstarbursts. study of such composite galaxies will help address how the starformation and disk-accretion phenomena may have regulated each other at highredshift and how this coordination may have participated to the build-up of therelationship observed locally between the masses of black holes and stellarspheroids.

astro-ph;0609579	a scuba/spitzer investigation of the far infra-red extragalactic  background	we have measured the contribution of submillimeter and mid-infrared sourcesto the extragalactic background radiation at 70 and 160um. specifically, wehave stacked flux in 70 and 160um spitzer space telescope (spitzer)observations of the canada-uk deep sub-millimeter survey 14h field at thepositions of 850um sources detected by scuba and also 8 and 24um sourcesdetected by spitzer. we find that per source, the scuba galaxies are thestrongest and the 8um sources the weakest contributors to the background fluxat both 70 and 160um. our estimate of the contribution of the scuba sources ishigher than previous estimates. however, expressed as a total contribution, thefull 8um source catalogue accounts for twice the total 24um source contributionand ~10 times the total scuba source contribution. the 8um sources account forthe majority of the background radiation at 160um with a flux of 0.87+/-0.16mjy/sr and at least a third at 70um with a flux of 0.103+/-0.019 mjy/sr. thesemeasurements are consistent with current lower limits on the background at 70and 160um. finally, we have investigated the 70 and 160um emission from the 8and 24um sources as a function of redshift. we find that the average 70um fluxper 24um source and the average 160um flux per 8 and 24um source is constantover all redshifts, up to z~4. in contrast, the low-redshift half (z&lt;1) of theof 8um sample contributes approximately four times the total 70um flux of thehigh-redshift half. these trends can be explained by a single non-evolving sed.

astro-ph;0611735	aegis: infrared spectral energy distributions of mips 70micron selected  sources	we present 0.5 -160 micron spectral energy distributions (seds) of galaxies,detected at 70microns with the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer (mips),using broadband imaging data from spitzer and ground-based telescopes.spectroscopic redshifts, in the range 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.5, have been measured as part ofthe deep extragalactic evolutionary probe2 (deep2) project. based on the sedswe explore the nature and physical properties of the sources. using the opticalspectra we derive hbeta and [oii]-based star formation rates (sfr) which are10-100 times lower than sfr estimates based on ir and radio. the median offsetin sfr between optical and ir is reduced by a factor of ~3 when we apply atypical extinction corrections. we investigate mid-to-far infrared correlationsfor low redshift (&gt;0.5) and high redshift (0.5&lt;z&lt;1.2) bins. using this unique``far-infrared'' selected sample we derive an empirical mid to far-infraredrelationship that can be used to estimate the infrared energy budget ofgalaxies in the high-redshift universe. our sample can be used as a template totranslate far-infrared luminosities into bolometric luminosities for highredshift objects.

astro-ph;0612165	combining strong and weak gravitational lensing in abell 1689	we present a reconstruction of the mass distribution of galaxy cluster abell1689 at z = 0.18 using detected strong lensing features from deep hst/acsobservations and extensive ground based spectroscopy. earlier analyses havereported up to 32 multiply imaged systems in this cluster, of which only 3 werespectroscopically confirmed. in this work, we present a parametric stronglensing mass reconstruction using 24 multiply imaged systems with newlydetermined spectroscopic redshifts, which is a major step forward in building arobust mass model. in turn, the new spectroscopic data allows a more secureidentification of multiply imaged systems. the resultant mass model enables usto reliably predict the redshifts of additional multiply imaged systems forwhich no spectra are currently available, and to use the location of thesesystems to further constrain the mass model. in particular, we have detected 5strong galaxy-galaxy lensing systems just outside the einstein ring region,further constraining the mass profile. our strong lensing mass model isconsistent with that inferred from our large scale weak lensing analysisderived using cfh12k wide field images. thanks to a new method for reliablyselecting a well defined background lensed galaxy population, we resolve thediscrepancy found between the strong and weak lensing mass models reported inearlier work.

astro-ph;0702544	the scuba half degree extragalactic survey (shades) - iii.  identification of radio and mid-infrared counterparts to submillimetre  galaxies	determining an accurate position for a submm galaxy (smg) is the crucial stepthat enables us to move from the basic properties of an smg sample - sourcecounts and 2-d clustering - to an assessment of their detailed,multi-wavelength properties, their contribution to the history of cosmic starformation and their links with present-day galaxy populations. in this paper,we identify robust radio and/or ir counterparts, and hence accurate positions,for over two thirds of the scuba half-degree extragalactic survey (shades)source catalogue, presenting optical, 24-um and radio images of each smg.observed trends in identification rate have given no strong rationale forpruning the sample. uncertainties in submm position are found to be consistentwith theoretical expectations, with no evidence for significant additionalsources of error. employing the submm/radio redshift indicator, via aparameterisation appropriate for radio-identified smgs with spectroscopicredshifts, yields a median redshift of 2.8 for the radio-identified subset ofshades, somewhat higher than the median spectroscopic redshift. we present adiagnostic colour-colour plot, exploiting spitzer photometry, in which weidentify regions commensurate with smgs at very high redshift. finally, we findthat significantly more smgs have multiple robust counterparts than would beexpected by chance, indicative of physical associations. these multiple systemsare most common amongst the brightest smgs and are typically separated by 2-6",or 15-50/(sin i) kpc at z ~ 2, consistent with early bursts seen in mergersimulations.

astro-ph;0703387	eros found behind lensing clusters. ii. stellar populations and dust  properties of optical dropout eros and comparison with related objects	we determine the nature, redshift, stellar populations and dust properties ofoptically faint or non-detected extremely red objects (ero) found from oursurvey of the lensing clusters a1835 and ac114. we perform sed fitting and usedeep optical, hst, vlt, spitzer data, and for some objects and sub-mm data. formost of the lensed eros we find photometric redshifts showing a strongdegeneracy between "low-z" (z~1-3) and high-z (z~6-7). although formally bestfits are often found at high-z, their resulting bright absolute magnitudes, thenumber density of these objects, and in some cases spitzer photometry or longerwavelength observations, suggest strongly that all of these objects are at"low-z". the majority of these objects are best fitted with young (&lt;~ 0.5-0.7gyr) and dusty starbursts. indications for strong extinction, with a_v~2.4-4,are found in some objects. for dusty objects star formation rates (sfr) havebeen estimated from the bolometric luminosity determined after fitting ofsemi-empirical starburst, ero, and ulirg templates. typically we findsfr~(1-18) msun/yr. again, smmj14009+0252 stands out as a lirg with sfr 1000msun/yr. concerning the comparison objects, we argue that the massivepost-starburst z~6.5 galaxy candidate hudf-j2 showing observed properties verysimilar to our eros, is more likely a dusty starburst at z~2.3-2.6. thisinterpretation also naturally explains the observed 24 micron emission. bothempirically and from our sed fits we find that the irac selectec eros from yanet al (2004) show very similar properties to our lensed eros. reasonable fitsare found for most of them with relatively young and dusty stellar populations.

astro-ph;9711255	what powers ultra-luminous iras galaxies?	we present an iso sws and isophot-s, mid-infrared spectroscopic survey of 15ultra-luminous iras galaxies. we combine the survey results with a detailedcase study, based on near-ir and mm imaging spectroscopy, of one of the samplegalaxies (ugc 5101). we compare the near- and mid-ir characteristics of theseultra-luminous galaxies to iso and literature data of thirty starburst andactive galactic nuclei (agn), template galaxies. we find that  1) 70-80% of the ultra-luminous iras galaxies in our sample are predominantlypowered by recently formed massive stars. 20-30% are powered by a central agn.these conclusions are based on a new infrared 'diagnostic diagram' involvingthe ratio of high to low excitation mid-ir emission lines on the one hand, andon the strength of the 7.7um pah feature on the other hand.  2) at least half of the sources probably have simultaneously an activenucleus and starburst activity in a 1-2 kpc diameter circum-nuclear disk/ring.  3) the mid-infrared emitting regions are highly obscured. after correctionfor these extinctions, we estimate that the star forming regions in ulirgs haveages between 10^7 and 10^8 years, similar to but somewhat larger than thosefound in lower luminosity starburst galaxies.  4) in the sample we have studied there is no obvious trend for the agncomponent to dominate in the most compact, and thus most advanced mergers.instead, at any given time during the merger evolution, the time dependentcompression of the circum-nuclear interstellar gas, the accretion rate onto thecentral black hole and the associated radiation efficiency may determinewhether star formation or agn activity dominates the luminosity of the system.

astro-ph;9911045	high resolution mid-infrared imaging of ultraluminous infrared galaxies	observations of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) with an achievedresolution approaching the diffraction limit in the mid-infrared from 8 - 25$\mu$m using the keck telescopes are reported. we find extremely compactstructures, with spatial scales of $&lt; 0.3''$ (diameter) in six of the sevenulirgs observed. these compact sources emit between 30% and 100% of themid-infrared energy from these galaxies. we have utilized the compactmid-infrared structures as a diagnostic of whether an agn or a compact (100 --300 pc) starburst is the primary power source in these ulirgs. in markarian231, the upper limit on the diameter of the 12.5 $\mu$m source, 0.13$''$, showsthat the size of the infrared source must increase with increasing wavelength,consistent with agn models. in iras 05189-2524 and iras 08572+3915 there isstrong evidence that the source size increases with increasing wavelength. thissuggests heating by a central source rather than an extended luminosity source,consistent with the optical classification as an agn. the compact mid-infraredsources seen in the other galaxies cannot be used to distinguish the ultimateluminosity source. if these ulirgs are powered by compact starbursts, the starformation rates seen in the central few hundred parsecs far exceed the globalrates seen in nearby starburst galaxies, and approach the surface brightness ofindividual clusters in nearby starburst galaxies.
