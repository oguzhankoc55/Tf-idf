0907.0992	the magic highlights of the gamma ray binary ls i +61 303	the discovery of emission of tev gamma rays from x-ray binaries has triggeredan intense effort to better understand the particle acceleration, absorption,and emission mechanisms in compact binary systems. here we present thepioneering effort of the magic collaboration to understand the very high energyemission of the prototype system ls i +61 303. we report on the variable natureof the emission from ls i +61 303 and show that this emission is indeedperiodic. the system shows regular outburst at tev energies in phasephi=0.6-0.7 and detect no signal at periastron (phi~ 0.275). furthermore wefind no indication of spectral variation along the orbit of the compact objectand the spectral energy distribution is compatible with a simple power law withindex gamma=2.6+-0.2_(stat)+-0.2_(sys). to answer some of the open questionsconcerning the emission process of the tev radiation we conducted amultiwavelength campaign with the magic telescope, xmm-newton, and swift inseptember 2007. we detect a simultaneous outburst at x-ray and tev energies,with the peak at phase 0.62 and a similar shape at both wavelengths. a linearfit to the strictly simultaneous x-ray/tev flux pairs provides r=0.81 -0.21+0.06. here we present the observations and discuss the implications of theobtained results to the emission processes in the system.

0909.0406	radio continuum and near-infrared study of the mgro j2019+37 region	(abridged) mgro j2019+37 is an unidentified extended source of vhe gamma-raysoriginally reported by the milagro collaboration as the brightest tev source inthe cygnus region. its extended emission could be powered by either a single orseveral sources. the gev pulsar agl j2020.5+3653, discovered by agile andassociated with psr j2021+3651, could contribute to the emission from mgroj2019+37, although extrapolation of the gev spectrum does not explain thedetected multi-tev flux. our aim is to identify radio and nir sources in thefield of the extended tev source mgro j2019+37, and study potentialcounterparts that could contribute to its emission. we surveyed a region ofabout 6 square degrees with the giant metrewave radio telescope (gmrt) at thefrequency 610 mhz. we also observed the central square degree of this survey inthe nir ks-band using the 3.5 m telescope in calar alto. archival x-rayobservations of some specific fields are included. vlbi observations of aninteresting radio source were performed. we explored possible scenarios toproduce the multi-tev emission from mgro j2019+37 and studied which of thesources could be the main particle accelerator. we present a catalogue of 362radio sources detected with the gmrt in the field of mgro j2019+37, and theresults of a cross-correlation of this catalog with one obtained at nirwavelengths, as well as with available x-ray observations of the region. somepeculiar sources inside the ~1 degree uncertainty region of the tev emissionfrom mgro j2019+37 are discussed in detail, including the pulsar psr j2021+3651and its pulsar wind nebula pwn g75.2+0.1, two new radio-jet sources, the hiiregion sh 2-104 containing two star clusters, and the radio source nvssj202032+363158.

0909.3267	magic gamma-ray telescope observation of the perseus cluster of  galaxies: implications for cosmic rays, dark matter, and ngc1275	the perseus galaxy cluster was observed by the magic cherenkov telescope fora total effective time of 24.4 hr during 2008 november and december. theresulting upper limits on the gamma-ray emission above 100 gev are in the rangeof 4.6 to 7.5 x 10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1} for spectral indices from -1.5 to -2.5,thereby constraining the emission produced by cosmic rays, dark matterannihilations, and the central radio galaxy ngc1275. results are compatiblewith cosmological cluster simulations for the cosmic-ray-induced gamma-rayemission, constraining the average cosmic ray-to-thermal pressure to &lt;4% forthe cluster core region (&lt;8% for the entire cluster). using simplifiedassumptions adopted in earlier work (a power-law spectrum with an index of-2.1, constant cosmic ray-to-thermal pressure for the peripheral clusterregions while accounting for the adiabatic contraction during the cooling flowformation), we would limit the ratio of cosmic ray-to-thermal energy toe_cr/e_th&lt;3%. the upper limit also translates into a level of gamma-rayemission from possible annihilations of the cluster dark matter (the dominantmass component) that is consistent with boost factors of ~10^4 for thetypically expected dark matter annihilation-induced emission. finally, theupper limits obtained for the gamma-ray emission of the central radio galaxyngc1275 are consistent with the recent detection by the fermi-lat satellite.due to the extremely large doppler factors required for the jet, a one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model is implausible in this case. we reproduce theobserved spectral energy density by using the structured jet (spine-layer)model which has previously been adopted to explain the high-energy emission ofradio galaxies.

0910.4381	correlated x-ray and very high energy emission in the gamma-ray binary  ls i +61 303	the discovery of very high energy (vhe) gamma-ray emitting x-ray binaries hastriggered an intense effort to better understand the particle acceleration,absorption, and emission mechanisms in compact binary systems, which providevariable conditions along eccentric orbits. despite this, the nature of some ofthese systems, and of the accelerated particles producing the vhe emission, isunclear. to answer some of these open questions, we conducted a multiwavelengthcampaign of the vhe gamma-ray emitting x-ray binary ls i +61 303 including themagic telescope, xmm-newton, and swift during 60% of an orbit in 2007september. we detect a simultaneous outburst at x-ray and vhe bands, with thepeak at phase 0.62 and a similar shape at both wavelengths. a linear fit to thesimultaneous x-ray/vhe pairs obtained during the outburst yields a correlationcoefficient of r=0.97, while a linear fit to all simultaneous pairs providesr=0.81. since a variable absorption of the vhe emission towards the observer isnot expected for the data reported here, the correlation found indicates asimultaneity in the emission processes. assuming that they are dominated by asingle particle population, either hadronic or leptonic, the x-ray/vhe fluxratio favors leptonic models. this fact, together with the detected photonindices, suggests that in ls i +61 303 the x-rays are the result of synchrotronradiation of the same electrons that produce vhe emission as a result ofinverse compton scattering of stellar photons.

0910.4412	powerful non-thermal emission in black-hole powered sources	powerful non-thermal emission has been detected coming from relativisticcollimated outflows launched in the vicinity of black holes of a very widerange of masses, from few to $\sim 10^{10}$ m$_{\odot}$. at different scalesalong the outflows, i.e. $\sim 10-10^{10} r_{\rm sch}$ from the black hole, thelocal conditions can lead to the generation of non-thermal populations ofparticles via, e.g., magnetic reconnection, magneto-centrifugal mechanisms,diffusive processes, or the so-called converter mechanism. these non-thermalpopulations of particles, interacting with dense matter, magnetic, andradiation fields, could yield radio-to-gamma-ray emission via synchrotronprocess, inverse compton scattering, relativistic bremsstrahlung, proton-protonand photo-hadron colissions, and even heavy nuclei photo-disintegration. otherprocesses, like pair creation or the development of electromagnetic cascades,could be also relevant in black-hole jets and their surroundings. black holesof different masses, accretion rates and environments show differentphenomenologies, as can be observed in agns, grbs or microquasars. nonetheless,these sources basically share the same fundamental physics: accretion,black-hole rotation, plus an environment, but they are individualized due totheir own specific conditions. in this paper, we qualitatively review the maincharacteristics of the non-thermal emission produced in jets from black holes,giving also a brief overview on the physical properties of black hole/jetsystems. we comment as well on some important differences and similaritiesbetween classes of sources, and on the prospects for the study of thenon-thermal emission from astrophysical sources powered by black holes.

1004.1093	search for an extended vhe gamma-ray emission from mrk 421 and mrk 501  with the magic telescope	context: part of the very high energy $\gamma$-ray radiation coming fromextragalactic sources is absorbed through the pair production process on theextragalactic background light photons. extragalactic magnetic fields alter thetrajectories of these cascade pairs and, in turn, convert cosmic backgroundphotons to gamma-ray energies by inverse compton scattering. these secondaryphotons can form an extended halo around bright vhe sources.  aims: we searched for an extended emission around the bright blazars mrk 421and mrk 501 using the magic telescope data.  methods: if extended emission is present, the angular distribution ofreconstructed gamma-ray arrival directions around the source is broader thanfor a point-like source. in the analysis of a few tens of hours ofobservational data taken from mrk 421 and mrk 501 we used a newly developedmethod that provides better angular resolution. this method is based on theusage of multidimensional decision trees. comparing the measured shapes ofangular distributions with those expected from a point-like source one candetect or constrain possible extended emission around the source. we alsostudied the influence of different types of systematic errors on the shape ofthe distribution of reconstructed gamma-ray arrival directions for a pointsource.  results: we present upper limits for an extended emission calculated for bothsources for various source extensions and emission profiles. we discusspossible constraints on the extragalactic magnetic fields strength. we obtainupper limits on the extended emission around the mrk~421 (mrk~501) on the levelof &lt; 5% (&lt; 4%) of the crab nebula flux above the energy threshold of 300 gev.using these results we discuss possible constraints on the extragalacticmagnetic fields strength around a few times $10^{-15}$~g.

1004.3665	magic observation of the grb080430 afterglow	context: gamma-ray bursts are cosmological sources emitting radiation fromthe gamma-rays to the radio band. substantial observational efforts have beendevoted to the study of gamma-ray bursts during the prompt phase, i.e. theinitial burst of high-energy radiation, and during the long-lasting afterglows.in spite of many successes in interpreting these phenomena, there are stillseveral open key questions about the fundamental emission processes, theirenergetics and the environment. aim: independently of specific gamma-ray bursttheoretical recipes, spectra in the gev/tev range are predicted to beremarkably simple, being satisfactorily modeled with power-laws, and thereforeoffer a very valuable tool to probe the extragalactic background lightdistribution. furthermore, the simple detection of a component at very-highenergies, i.e. at $\sim 100$\,gev, would solve the ambiguity about theimportance of various possible emission processes, which provide barelydistinguishable scenarios at lower energies. methods: we used the results ofthe magic telescope observation of the moderate resdhift ($z\sim0.76$)\object{grb\,080430} at energies above about 80\,gev, to evaluate theperspective for late-afterglow observations with ground based gev/tevtelescopes. results: we obtained an upper limit of $f_{\rm 95%\,cl} = 5.5\times 10^{-11}$\,erg\,cm$^{-2}$\,s$^{-1}$ for the very-high energy emission of\object{grb\,080430}, which cannot set further constraints on the theoreticalscenarios proposed for this object also due to the difficulties in modeling thelow-energy afterglow. nonetheless, our observations show that cherenkovtelescopes have already reached the required sensitivity to detect the gev/tevemission of grbs at moderate redshift ($z \lesssim 0.8$), provided theobservations are carried out at early times, close to the onset of theirafterglow phase.

1005.0740	magic constraints on gamma-ray emission from cygnus x-3	cygnus x-3 is a microquasar consisting of an accreting compact objectorbiting around a wolf-rayet star. it has been detected at radio frequenciesand up to high-energy gamma rays (above 100 mev). however, many models alsopredict a very high energy (vhe) emission (above hundreds of gev) when thesource displays relativistic persistent jets or transient ejections. therefore,detecting such emission would improve the understanding of the jet physics. theimaging atmospheric cherenkov telescope magic observed cygnus x-3 for about 70hours between 2006 march and 2009 august in different x-ray/radio spectralstates and also during a period of enhanced gamma-ray emission. magic found noevidence for a vhe signal from the direction of the microquasar. an upper limitto the integral flux for energies higher than 250 gev has been set to 2.2 x10-12 photons cm-2 s-1 (95% confidence level). this is the best limit so far tothe vhe emission from this source. the non-detection of a vhe signal during theperiod of activity in the high-energy band sheds light on the location of thepossible vhe radiation favoring the emission from the innermost region of thejets, where absorption is significant. the current and future generations ofcherenkov telescopes may detect a signal under precise spectral conditions.

0708.2955	gamma-ray emission from massive young stellar objects	massive stars form in dense and massive molecular cores. the exact formationmechanism is unclear, but it is possible that some massive stars are formed byprocesses similar to those that produce the low-mass stars, withaccretion/ejection phenomena occurring at some point of the evolution of theprotostar. this picture seems to be supported by the detection of a collimatedstellar wind emanating from the massive protostar iras 16547-4247. a tripleradio source is associated with the protostar: a compact core and two radiolobes. the emission of the southern lobe is clearly non-thermal. such emissionis interpreted as synchrotron radiation produced by relativistic electronslocally accelerated at the termination point of a thermal jet. since theambient medium is determined by the properties of the molecular cloud in whichthe whole system is embedded, we can expect high densities of particles andinfrared photons. because of the confirmed presence of relativistic electrons,inverse compton and relativistic bremsstrahlung interactions are unavoidable.proton-proton collision should also occur, producing an injection of neutralpions. in this paper we aim at making quantitative predictions of the spectralenergy distribution of the non-thermal spots generated by massive young stellarobjects, with emphasis on the particular case of iras 16547-4247. we presentspectral energy distributions for the southern lobe of this source, for avariety of conditions. we show that high-energy emission might be detectablefrom this object in the gamma-ray domain (mev to tev). the source may also bedetectable at x-rays through long exposures with current x-ray instruments.

1011.4489	on the origin of correlated x-ray/vhe emission from ls i +61 303	the magic collaboration has recently reported correlated x-ray and veryhigh-energy gamma-ray emission from the gamma-ray binary ls i +61 303 during~60% of one orbit. these observations suggest that the emission in these twobands has its origin in a single particle population. we aim at improving ourunderstanding of the source behaviour by explaining the simultaneous x-ray andvhe data through a radiation model. we use a model based on a one zonepopulation of relativistic leptonic particles assuming dominant adiabaticlosses located at the position of the compact object. the adiabatic coolingtimescale is inferred from the x-ray fluxes. the model can reproduce thespectra and lightcurves in the x-ray and vhe bands. adiabatic losses could bethe key ingredient to explain the x-ray and partially the vhe lightcurves. fromthe best fit result, we obtain a magnetic field of b=0.2 g, a minimumluminosity budget of ~2x10^35 erg/s and a relatively high accelerationefficiency. in addition, our results seem to confirm that the gev emissiondetected by fermi does not come from the same parent particle population as thex-ray and vhe emission and the fermi spectrum poses a constraint on thehardness of the particle spectrum at lower energies. in the context of ourscenario, more sensitive observations would allow to constrain the inclinationangle, which could determine the nature of the compact object.

1101.5049	the termination region of high-mass microquasar jets	the environment of high-mass x-ray binaries can be characterized either bythe snr that forms these systems, or by the wind from the companion massivestar. these regions should be tenuous but very hot, and surrounded by a denseand cold shocked ism shell. the interaction between the jet and such a complexmedium, also affected by the system proper motion, can lead to very differentjet termination structures. the evolution of the jet termination regions duringthe life of a high-mass microquasar is simulated to improve the presentunderstanding of these structures. also, the evolving emission characteristicsare modeled to inform potential observational campaigns for this class ofobject. we have performed 2d numerical simulations of jets propagating indifferent scenarios, corresponding to different epochs after the formation ofthe high-mass x-ray binary, using the code ratpenat. we have also made simpleestimates of the non-thermal emission that could be produced in the jettermination regions. we find that, in the way through the hot and tenuousmedium of the shocked wind/snr ejecta, the jet suffers recollimation shocks inwhich it loses part of its thrust and ends in a strong shock inflating a hotcocoon. the jet head propagates with a speed similar to the medium sound speed,until it eventually reaches the denser and colder shocked ism and theunperturbed ism later on. in these last stages of evolution, the jet issignificantly slowed down and can be disrupted. for relatively old sources, themicroquasar peculiar velocity becomes important, leading to complete jetdestruction. extended non-thermal radiation can be generated in the jettermination regions, being hard x-rays and tev photons the best suitedwavelengths to observe these structures.

1103.2996	radio emission from high-mass binaries with non-accreting pulsars	binary systems that harbor a non-accreting pulsar are efficient non-thermalemitters, from radio to gamma rays. this broadband emission is thought to comefrom the region where the companion star and pulsar winds collide. aparadigmatic example of this source type is psr b1259$-$63. whereas thehigh-energy radiation probes the shock structure at the binary scale, the radioemission is produced well outside the system, in regions where the shockedstellar and pulsar winds are likely mixing due to hydrodynamical instabilities.understanding the evolution of the shocked flow depends strongly on a propercharacterization of the low-energy radiation. we have performed numericalcalculations of the radio emission produced in a high-mass binary hosting ayoung pulsar. adopting a prescription for the shocked flow in the system andthe non-thermal particle injection, we have generated synthetic radio emissionmaps that can be compared with observations. preliminary results suggest thatthe emitting bulk flow should be rather slow, with a pulsar wind magnetizationat the shock higher than in isolated pulsars.

1105.6236	large-scale flow dynamics and radiation in pulsar gamma-ray binaries	several gamma-ray binaries show extended x-ray emission that may beassociated to interactions of an outflow with the medium. some of these systemsare, or may be, high-mass binaries harboring young nonaccreting pulsars, inwhich the stellar and the pulsar winds collide, generating a powerful outflowthat should terminate at some point in the ambient medium. this work studiesthe evolution and termination, as well as the related radiation, of theshocked-wind flow generated in high-mass binaries hosting powerful pulsars. acharacterization, based on previous numerical work, is given for thestellar/pulsar wind interaction. then, an analytical study of the furtherevolution of the shocked flow and its dynamical impact on the surroundingmedium is carried out. finally, the expected nonthermal emission from the flowtermination shock, likely the dominant emitting region, is calculated. theshocked wind structure, initially strongly asymmetric, becomes aquasi-spherical, supersonically expanding bubble, with its energy coming fromthe pulsar and mass from the stellar wind. this bubble eventually interactswith the environment on ~pc scales, producing a reverse and, sometimes, aforward shock. nonthermal leptonic radiation can be efficient in the reverseshock. radio emission is expected to be faint, whereas x-rays can easily reachdetectable fluxes. under very low magnetic fields and large nonthermalluminosities, gamma rays may also be significant. we conclude that thecomplexity of the stellar/pulsar wind interaction is likely to be smoothed outoutside the binary system, where the wind-mixed flow accelerates and eventuallyterminates in a strong reverse shock. this shock may be behind the extendedx-rays observed in some binary systems. for very powerful pulsars, part of theunshocked pulsar wind may directly interact with the large-scale environment.

1108.4269	thermal x-ray emission from the shocked stellar wind of pulsar gamma-ray  binaries	gamma-ray loud x-ray binaries are binary systems that show non-thermalbroadband emission from radio to gamma rays. if the system comprises a massivestar and a young non-accreting pulsar, their winds will collide producingbroadband non-thermal emission, most likely originated in the shocked pulsarwind. thermal x-ray emission is expected from the shocked stellar wind, butuntil now it has neither been detected nor studied in the context of gamma-raybinaries. we present a semi-analytic model of the thermal x-ray emission fromthe shocked stellar wind in pulsar gamma-ray binaries, and find that thethermal x-ray emission increases monotonically with the pulsar spin-downluminosity, reaching luminosities of the order of 10^33 erg/s. the lack ofthermal features in the x-ray spectrum of gamma-ray binaries can then be usedto constrain the properties of the pulsar and stellar winds. by fitting theobserved x-ray spectra of gamma-ray binaries with a source model composed of anabsorbed non-thermal power law and the computed thermal x-ray emission, we areable to derive upper limits on the spin-down luminosity of the putative pulsar.we applied this method to ls 5039, the only gamma-ray binary with a radial,powerful wind, and obtain an upper limit on the pulsar spin-down luminosity of~6x10^36 erg/s. given the energetic constraints from its high-energy gamma-rayemission, a non-thermal to spin-down luminosity ratio very close to unity maybe required.

1109.1734	gamma rays from extragalactic astrophysical sources	presently there are several classes of detected gamma-ray extragalaticsources. they are mostly associated to active galactic nuclei (agn) and (atsoft gamma rays) to gamma-ray bursts (grb), but not only. active galacticnuclei consist of accreting supermassive black holes hosted by a galaxy thatpresent in some cases powerful relativistic jet activity. these sources, whichhave been studied in gamma rays for several decades, are probably the mostenergetic astrophysical objects, and their appearance depends much on whethertheir jets point to us. gamma-ray bursts, thought to be associated tocollapsing or merging stellar-mass objects at cosmological distances, are alsoaccreting highly relativistic jet sources that shine strongly at high energies.these are very short-duration events, but they are also the most luminous.recently, star formation galaxies have turned out to be also gamma-rayemitters. on the other hand, clusters of galaxies have not been detected beyondx-rays yet. these are the largest known structures in the universe; in theirformation through accretion and merging, shocks and turbulence are generated,which may lead to gamma-ray production. in this work, the gamma-ray physics ofagns is briefly presented, as well as that of starburst galaxies, grbs andclusters of galaxies. afterwards, we consider some particular cases ofgamma-ray production in non-blazar agn jets interacting with their medium atdifferent scales.

1110.1534	exploring particle acceleration in gamma-ray binaries	binary systems can be powerful sources of non-thermal emission from radio togamma rays. when the latter are detected, then these objects are known asgamma-ray binaries. in this work, we explore, in the context of gamma-raybinaries, different acceleration processes to estimate their efficiency: fermii, fermi ii, shear acceleration, the converter mechanism, and magneticreconnection. we find that fermi i acceleration in a mildly relativistic shockcan provide, although marginally, the multi-10 tev particles required toexplain observations. shear acceleration may be a complementary mechanism,giving particles the final boost to reach such a high energies. fermi iiacceleration may be too slow to account for the observed very high energyphotons, but may be suitable to explain extended low-energy emission. theconverter mechanism seems to require rather high lorentz factors but cannot bediscarded a priori. standard relativistic shock acceleration requires a highlyturbulent, weakly magnetized downstream medium; magnetic reconnection, byitself possibly insufficient to reach very high energies, could perhapsfacilitate such a conditions. further theoretical developments, and a bettersource characterization, are needed to pinpoint the dominant accelerationmechanism, which need not be one and the same in all sources.

1310.5641	clumpy stellar winds and high-energy emission in high-mass binaries  hosting a young pulsar	high-mass binaries hosting young pulsars can be powerful gamma-ray emitters.the stellar wind of the massive star in the system is expected to be clumpy.since the high-energy emission comes from the pulsar-star wind interaction, thepresence of clumps can affect the spectrum and variability of this radiation.we look for the main effects of the clumps on the two-wind interaction regionand on the non-thermal radiation. a simple analytical model for the two-windinteraction dynamics was developed accounting for the lifetime of clumps underthe pulsar-wind impact. this time plays a very important role with regard tothe evolution of the clump, the magnetic field in the clump-pulsar windinteraction region, and the non-radiative and radiative cooling of thenon-thermal particles. we also computed the high-energy emission produced atthe interaction of long-living clumps with the pulsar wind. for reasonableparameters, the clumps will induce small variability on the x-ray and gamma-rayradiation. sporadically, large clumps can reach closer to the pulsar increasingthe magnetic field, triggering synchrotron x-ray flares and weakening otheremission components like inverse compton. the reduction of the emitter sizeinduced by clumps also makes non-radiative losses faster. stellar wind clumpscan also enhance instability development and matter entrainment in the shockedpulsar wind when it leaves the binary. growth limitations of the clumps fromthe wind acceleration region may imply that a different origin for the largestclumps is required. the large-scale wind structures behind the observeddiscrete absorption components in the uv may be the source of these largeclumps. the presence of structure in the stellar wind can produce substantialenergy-dependent variability and should not be neglected when studying thebroadband emission from high-mass binaries hosting young pulsars.

0805.1707	the physics of non-thermal radiation in microquasars	microquasars are binary systems that harbor a normal star and a compactobject (black-hole or neutron star), and show relativistic outflows (or jets).the matter that forms these jets is of likely stellar origin, previouslyexpelled from the star and trapped in the potential well of the compact object.this matter is accreted by the compact object, forming a disk due to itsangular momentum, and is eventually ejected in the form of a bipolar outflow(the jets), which generates radio emission and could also be a very high-energyemitter. to study and understand the radiation from microquasars, there is aset of elements that can play a major role and are to be taken into account:the photons and the expelled matter from the star in the case of high-masssystems; the accreted matter radiation; the jet; the magnetic field carried bythe jet or filling the binary system; and the medium surrounding themicroquasar at large scales (~pc). in this lecture, we consider these elementsof the microquasar scenario and briefly describe the physical conditions andprocesses involved in the production of non-thermal radiation from radio togamma-rays. the required energetics, particle acceleration and transport,several radiative mechanisms, and the impact of different photon absorptionprocesses, are discussed.

astro-ph;0509086	a broadband leptonic model for gamma-ray emitting microquasars	observational and theoretical studies point to microquasars (mqs) as possiblecounterparts of a significant fraction of the unidentified gamma-ray sourcesdetected so far. at present, a proper scenario to explain the emission beyondsoft x-rays from these objects is not known, nor what the precise connection isbetween the radio and the high-energy radiation. we develop a new model wherethe mq jet is dynamically dominated by cold protons and radiatively dominatedby relativistic leptons. the matter content and power of the jet are bothrelated with the accretion process. the magnetic field is assumed to be closeto equipartition, although it is attached to and dominated by the jet matter.for the relativistic particles in the jet, their maximum energy depends on boththe acceleration efficiency and the energy losses. the model takes into accountthe interaction of the relativistic jet particles with the magnetic field andall the photon and matter fields. such interaction produces significant amountsof radiation from radio to very high energies through synchrotron, relativisticbremsstrahlung, and inverse compton (ic) processes. variability of the emissionproduced by changes in the accretion process (e.g. via orbital eccentricity) isalso expected. the effects of the gamma-ray absorption by the external photonfields on the gamma-ray spectrum have been taken into account, revealing clearspectral features that might be observed. this model is consistent to theaccretion scenario, energy conservation laws, and current observationalknowledge, and can provide deeper physical information of the source whentested against multiwavelength data.

astro-ph;0509095	spectral energy distribution of the gamma-ray microquasar ls 5039	the microquasar ls 5039 has recently been detected as a source of very highenergy (vhe) $\gamma$-rays. this detection, that confirms the previouslyproposed association of ls 5039 with the egret source 3eg~j1824$-$1514, makesof ls 5039 a special system with observational data covering nearly all theelectromagnetic spectrum. in order to reproduce the observed spectrum of ls5039, from radio to vhe $\gamma$-rays, we have applied a cold matter dominatedjet model that takes into account accretion variability, the jet magneticfield, particle acceleration, adiabatic and radiative losses, microscopicenergy conservation in the jet, and pair creation and absorption due to theexternal photon fields, as well as the emission from the first generation ofsecondaries. the radiative processes taken into account are synchrotron,relativistic bremsstrahlung and inverse compton (ic). the model is based on ascenario that has been characterized with recent observational results,concerning the orbital parameters, the orbital variability at x-rays and thenature of the compact object. the computed spectral energy distribution (sed)shows a good agreement with the available observational data.

astro-ph;0601238	a microquasar model applied to unidentified gamma-ray sources	among unidentified gamma-ray sources in the galactic plane, there are somethat present significant variability and have been proposed to be high-massmicroquasars. to deepen the study of the possible association between variablelow galactic latitude gamma-ray sources and microquasars, we have applied aleptonic jet model based on the microquasar scenario that reproduces thegamma-ray spectrum of three unidentified gamma-ray sources, 3eg j1735-1500, 3egj1828+0142 and gro j1411-64, and is consistent with the observationalconstraints at lower energies. we conclude that if these sources were generatedby microquasars, the particle acceleration processes could not be as efficientas in other objects of this type that present harder gamma-ray spectra.moreover, the dominant mechanism of high-energy emission should be synchrotronself-compton (ssc) scattering, and the radio jets may only be observed at lowfrequencies. for each particular case, further predictions of jet physicalconditions and variability generation mechanisms have been made in the contextof the model. although there might be other candidates able to explain theemission coming from these sources, microquasars cannot be excluded ascounterparts. observations performed by the next generation of gamma-rayinstruments, like glast, are required to test the proposed model.

astro-ph;0605491	spectral and variability properties of ls 5039 from radio to very  high-energy gamma-rays	microquasars are x-ray binaries with relativistic jets. the microquasar ls5039 turned out to be the first high-energy gamma-ray microquasar candidate dueto its likely association with the egret source 3eg j1824-1514. furthertheoretical studies supported this association, which could be extended toother egret sources. very recently, aharonian et al. (2005) have communicatedthe detection of the microquasar ls 5039 at tev energies. this fact confirmsthe egret source association and leaves no doubt about the gamma-ray emittingnature of this object. the aim of the present work is to show that, applying acold-matter dominated jet model to ls 5039, we can reproduce many of thespectral and variability features observed in this source. jet physics isexplored, and some physical quantities are estimated as a by-product of theperformed modeling. although at the moment only ls 5039 has been detected onthe entire electromagnetic spectrum, it does not seem unlikely that othermicroquasars will show similar spectral properties. therefore, an in-depthstudy of the first gamma-ray microquasar, on theoretical grounds supported byobservations, can render a useful knowledge applicable elsewhere.

astro-ph;0609708	integral serendipitous detection of the gamma-ray microquasar ls 5039	ls 5039 is the only x-ray binary persistently detected at tev energies by thecherenkov hess telescope. it is moreover a gamma-ray emitter in the gev andpossibly mev energy ranges. to understand important aspects of jet physics,like the magnetic field content or particle acceleration, and emissionprocesses, such as synchrotron and inverse compton (ic), a complete modeling ofthe multiwavelength data is necessary. ls 5039 has been detected along almostall the electromagnetic spectrum thanks to several radio, infrared, optical andsoft x-ray detections. however, hard x-ray detections above 20 kev have been sofar elusive and/or doubtful, partly due to source confusion for the poorspatial resolution of hard x-ray instruments. we report here on deep (300 ksec)serendipitous integral hard x-ray observations of ls 5039, coupled withsimultaneous vla radio observations. we obtain a 20-40 kev flux of 1.1 +/- 0.3mcrab (5.9 (+/-1.6) x 10^{-12} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}), a 40-100 kev upper limit of1.5 mcrab (9.5 x 10^{-12} erg cm^{-2}s^{-1}), and typical radio flux densitiesof about 25 mjy at 5ghz. these hard x-ray fluxes are significantly lower thanprevious estimates obtained with batse in the same energy range but, in thelower interval, agree with extrapolation of previous rxte measurements. theintegral observations also hint to a break in the spectral behavior at hardx-rays. a more sensitive characterization of the hard x-ray spectrum of ls 5039from 20 to 100 kev could therefore constrain key aspects of the jet physics,like the relativistic particle spectrum and the magnetic field strength. futuremultiwavelength observations would allow to establish whether such hard x-raysynchrotron emission is produced by the same population of relativisticelectrons as those presumably producing tev emission through ic.

astro-ph;0612318	theoretical overview on high-energy emission in microquasars	microquasar (mq) jets are sites of particle acceleration and synchrotronemission. such synchrotron radiation has been detected coming from jet regionsof different spatial scales, which for the instruments at work nowadays appearas compact radio cores, slightly resolved radio jets, or (very) extendedstructures. because of the presence of relativistic particles and dense photon,magnetic and matter fields, these outflows are also the best candidates togenerate the very high-energy (vhe) gamma-rays detected coming from two ofthese objects, ls 5039 and ls i +61 303, and may be contributing significantlyto the x-rays emitted from the mq core. in addition, beside electromagneticradiation, jets at different scales are producing some amount of leptonic andhadronic cosmic rays (cr), and evidences of neutrino production in theseobjects may be eventually found. in this work, we review on the differentphysical processes that may be at work in or related to mq jets. the jetregions capable to produce significant amounts of emission at differentwavelengths have been reduced to the jet base, the jet at scales of the orderof the size of the system orbital semi-major axis, the jet middle scales (theresolved radio jets), and the jet termination point. the surroundings of thejet could be sites of multiwavelegnth emission as well, deserving also aninsight. we focus on those scenarios, either hadronic or leptonic, in which itseems more plausible to generate both photons from radio to vhe and high-energyneutrinos. we briefly comment as well on the relevance of mq as possiblecontributors to the galactic cr in the gev-pev range.

astro-ph;0703499	exploring the connection between the stellar wind and the non-thermal  emission in ls 5039	ls 5039 has been observed with several x-ray instruments so far. the sourcepresents x-ray variability at orbital timescales in flux and photon index. thesystem harbors an o-type main sequence star with moderate mass loss. atpresent, the link between the x-rays and the stellar wind is unclear. newxmm-newton observations have been performed around periastron and apastronpassages in september 2005, when the stellar wind activity was apparentlyhigher. april 2005 chandra observations on ls 5039 are also revisited.moreover, a compilation of halpha ew data obtained since 1992, from which thestellar mass loss evolution can be approximately inferred, is carried out.xmm-newton observations show higher and harder emission around apastron thanaround periastron. no signatures of thermal emission or a reflection iron lineindicating the presence of an accretion disk are found in the spectrum, and thehydrogen column density (nh) is compatible with being the same in bothobservations and consistent with the interstellar value. 2005 chandraobservations show a hard x-ray spectrum, and possibly high fluxes. the halphaew shows yearly variations of a ~ 10%, and does not seem to be correlated withx-ray fluxes obtained at similar phases, unlike it would be expected in thewind accretion scenario. 2005 xmm-newton and chandra observations areconsistent with 2003 rxte/pca results. the constancy of the nh seems to implythat either the x-ray emitter is located at &gt;~ 1012 cm from the compact object,or the real n_h is 3-27 times smaller than the one predicted by a sphericalsymmetric wind model. we suggest that the multiwavelength non-thermal emissionof ls 5039 is related to the radio jets and unlikely produced inside the binarysystem.

0811.0978	studying the properties of the radio emitter in ls 5039	ls 5039 is an x-ray binary that presents non-thermal radio emission. theradiation at $\sim 5$ ghz is quite steady and optically thin, consisting on adominant core plus an extended jet-like structure. there is a spectral turnoveraround 1 ghz, and evidence of variability at timescales of 1 yr at 234 mhz. weinvestigate the radio emitter properties using the available broadband radiodata, and assuming two possible scenarios to explain the turnover: free-freeabsorption in the stellar wind, or synchrotron self-absorption. we use therelationships between the turnover frequency, the stellar wind density, theemitter location, size and magnetic field, and the lorentz factor of theemitting electrons, as well as a reasonable assumption on the energy budget, toinfer the properties of the low-frequency radio emitter. also, we put thisinformation in context with the broadband radio data. the location and size ofthe low-frequency radio emitter can be restricted to $\ga$ few au from theprimary star, its magnetic field to $\sim 3\times 10^{-3}-1$ g, and theelectron lorentz factors to $\sim 10-100$. the observed variability of theextended structures seen with vlba would point to electron bulk velocities $\ga3\times 10^8$ cm s$^{-1}$, whereas much less variable radiation at 5 ghz wouldindicate velocities for the vlba core $\la 10^8$ cm s$^{-1}$. the emission at234 mhz in the high state would mostly come from a region larger than thedominant broadband radio emitter. we suggest a scenario in which secondarypairs, created via gamma-ray absorption and moving in the stellar wind, arebehind the steady broadband radio core, whereas the resolved jet-like radioemission would come from a collimated, faster, outflow.

0812.3235	non thermal emission from microquasar/ism interaction	the interaction of microquasar jets with their environment can producenon-thermal radiation as is the case for extragalactic outflows impacting ontheir surroundings. we have developed an analytical model based on thosesuccessfully applied to extragalactic sources. the jet is taken to be asupersonic and mildly relativistic hydrodynamical outflow. we focus on thejet/shocked medium structure when being in its adiabatic phase, and assume thatit grows in a self-similar way. we calculate the fluxes and spectra of theradiation produced via synchrotron, inverse compton and relativisticbremsstrahlung processes by electrons accelerated in strong shocks. ahydrodynamical simulation is also performed to further investigate the jetinteraction with the environment and check the physical parameters used in theanalytical model. we conclude that microquasar jet termination regions could bedetectable at radio wavelengths for current instruments sensitive to arcminutescales while at x-rays the expected luminosities are moderate, although theemitter is more compact than the radio one. the radiation at gamma-ray energiesmay be within the detection limits of the next generation of satellite andground-based instruments.

0812.3358	study of the spectral and temporal characteristics of x-ray emission of  the gamma-ray binary ls 5039 with suzaku	we report on the results from suzaku broadband x-ray observations of thegalactic binary source ls5039. the suzaku data, which have continuous coverageof more than one orbital period, show strong modulation of the x-ray emissionat the orbital period of this tev gamma-ray emitting system.the x-ray emissionshows a minimum at orbital phase ~ 0.1, close to the so-called superiorconjunction of the compact object, and a maximum at phase ~0.7, very close tothe inferior conjunction of the compact object. the x-ray spectral data up to70 kev are described by a hard power-law with a phase-dependent photon indexwhich varies within gamma ~1.45 - 1.61. the amplitude of the flux variation isa factor of 2.5, but is significantly less than that of the factor ~8 variationin the tev flux. otherwise the two light curves are similar, but not identical.although periodic x-ray emission has been found from many galactic binarysystems, the suzaku result implies a phenomenon different from the "standard"origin of x-rays related to the emission of the hot accretion plasma formedaround the compact companion object. the x-ray radiation of ls5039is likely tobe linked to very-high-energy electrons which are also responsible for the tevgamma-ray emission. while the gamma-rays are the result of inverse comptonscattering by electrons on optical stellar photons, x-rays are produced viasynchrotron radiation. yet, while the modulation of the tev gamma-ray signalcan be naturally explained by the photon-photon pair production and anisotropicinverse compton scattering, the observed modulation of synchrotron x-raysrequires an additional process, the most natural one being adiabatic expansionin the radiation production region.
