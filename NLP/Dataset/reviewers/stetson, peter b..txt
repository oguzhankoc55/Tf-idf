0904.4463	the acs lcid project. i. short-period variables in the isolated dwarf  spheroidal galaxies cetus &amp; tucana	(abridged) we present the first study of the variable star populations in theisolated dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dsph) cetus and tucana. based on hubblespace telescope images obtained with the advanced camera for surveys in thef475w and f814w bands, we identified 180 and 371 variables in cetus and tucana,respectively. the vast majority are rr lyrae stars. in cetus we also foundthree anomalous cepheids, four candidate binaries and one candidate long-periodvariable (lpv), while six anomalous cepheids and seven lpv candidates werefound in tucana. of the rr lyrae stars, 147 were identified as fundamental mode(rrab) and only eight as first-overtone mode (rrc) in cetus, with mean periodsof 0.614 and 0.363 day, respectively. in tucana we found 216 rrab and 82 rrcgiving mean periods of 0.604 and 0.353 day. these values place both galaxies inthe so-called oosterhoff gap, as is generally the case for dsph. we calculatedthe distance modulus to both galaxies using different approaches based on theproperties of rrab and rrc, namely the luminosity-metallicity andperiod-luminosity-metallicity relations, and found values in excellentagreement with previous estimates using independent methods:(m-m)_{0,cet}=24.46+-0.12 and (m-m)_{0,tuc}=24.74+-0.12, corresponding to780+-40 kpc and 890+-50 kpc. we also found numerous rr lyrae variablespulsating in both modes simultaneously (rrd): 17 in cetus and 60 in tucana.tucana is, after fornax, the second dsph in which such a large fraction of rrd(~17%) has been observed. we provide the photometry and pulsation parametersfor all the variables, and compare the latter with values from the literaturefor well-studied dsph of the local group and galactic globular clusters.

0905.3737	the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury	the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury (angst) is a systematic survey toestablish a legacy of uniform multi-color photometry of resolved stars for avolume-limited sample of nearby galaxies (d&lt;4 mpc). the survey volumeencompasses 69 galaxies in diverse environments, including close pairs, small &amp;large groups, filaments, and truly isolated regions. the galaxies include anearly complete range of morphological types spanning a factor of ~10^4 inluminosity and star formation rate. the survey data consists of images takenwith acs on hst, supplemented with archival data and new wfpc2 imaging takenafter the failure of acs. survey images include wide field tilings covering thefull radial extent of each galaxy, and single deep pointings in uncrowdedregions of the most massive galaxies in the volume. the new wide field imagingin angst reaches median 50% completenesses of m_f475w=28.0 mag, m_f606w=27.3mag, and m_f814w=27.3 mag, several magnitudes below the tip of the red giantbranch (trgb). the deep fields reach magnitudes sufficient to fully resolve thestructure in the red clump. the resulting photometric catalogs are publiclyaccessible and contain over 34 million photometric measurements of &gt;14 millionstars. in this paper we present the details of the sample selection, imaging,data reduction, and the resulting photometric catalogs, along with an analysisof the photometric uncertainties (systematic and random), for both the acs andwfpc2 imaging. we also present uniformly derived relative distances measuredfrom the apparent magnitude of the trgb.

1002.4178	the acs lcid project. ii. faint variable stars in the isolated dwarf  irregular galaxy ic1613	(abridged) we present the results of a new search for variable stars in thelocal group (lg) isolated dwarf galaxy ic1613, based on 24 orbits of f475w andf814w photometry from the acs camera onboard the hst. we detected 259 candidatevariables in this field, of which only 13 (all of them bright cepheids) werepreviously known. out of the confirmed variables, we found 90 rr lyrae stars,49 classical cepheids (including 36 new discoveries), and 38 eclipsing binarystars for which we could determine a period. the rr lyrae include 61fundamental (rrab) and 24 first-overtone (rrc) pulsators, and 5 pulsating inboth modes simultaneously (rrd). as for the majority of lg dwarfs, the meanperiods of the rrab and rrc (0.611 and 0.334 day, respectively) as well as thefraction of overtone pulsators (f_c=0.28) place this galaxy in the intermediateregime between the oosterhoff types. from their position on theperiod-luminosity diagram and light-curve morphology, we can unambiguouslyclassify 25 and 14 cepheids as fundamental and first-overtone mode pulsators,respectively. another two are clearly second-overtone cepheids, the first onesto be discovered beyond the magellanic clouds. we estimate the distance toic1613 using various methods based on the photometric and pulsationalproperties of the cepheids and rr lyrae stars. the values we find are in verygood agreement with each other and with previous estimates based on independentmethods. when corrected to a common reddening of e(b-v)=0.025 and true lmcdistance modulus of (m-m)_{lmc,0}=18.515+-0.085, we find that all the distancedeterminations from the literature converge to a common value of(m-m)_0=24.400+-0.014 (statistical), or 760 kpc.

1010.0247	fiducial stellar population sequences for the vjks photometric system	we have obtained broad-band near-infrared photometry for seven galactic starclusters (m92, m15, m13, m5, ngc1851, m71 and ngc6791) using the wircamwide-field imager on the canada-france-hawaii telescope, supplemented by imagesof ngc1851 taken with hawk-i on the vlt. in addition, 2mass observations of the[fe/h] ~ 0.0 open cluster m67 were added to the cluster database. from theresultant (v-j)-v and (v-ks)-v colour-magnitude diagrams (cmds), fiducialsequences spanning the range in metallicity, -2.4 &lt; [fe/h] &lt; +0.3, have beendefined which extend (for most clusters) from the tip of the red-giant branch(rgb) to ~ 2.5 magnitudes below the main-sequence turnoff. these fiducialsprovide a valuable set of empirical isochrones for the interpretation ofstellar population data in the 2mass system. we also compare our newly derivedcmds to victoria isochrones that have been transformed to the observed planeusing recent empirical and theoretical colour-teff relations. the models areable to reproduce the entire cmds of clusters more metal rich than [fe/h] ~-1.4 quite well, on the assumption of the same reddenings and distance modulithat yield good fits of the same isochrones to johnson-cousins bv(ri)cphotometry. however, the predicted giant branches become systematically redderthan the observed rgbs as the cluster metallicity decreases. possibleexplanations for these discrepancies are discussed.

1010.5794	period change similarities among the rr lyrae variables in oosterhoff i  and oosterhoff ii globular systems	we present period change rates (dp/dt) for 42 rr lyrae variables in theglobular cluster ic$\,$4499. despite clear evidence of these period increasesor decreases, the observed period change rates are an order of magnitude largerthan predicted from theoretical models of this cluster. we find there is apreference for increasing periods, a phenomenon observed in most rr lyrae starsin milky way globular clusters. the period-change rates as a function ofposition in the period-amplitude plane are used to examine possibleevolutionary effects in ooi clusters, ooii clusters, field rr lyrae stars andthe mixed-population cluster $\omega$~ centauri. it is found that there is nocorrelation between the period change rate and the typical definition ofoosterhoff groups. if the rr lyrae period changes correspond with evolutionaryeffects, this would be in contrast to the hypothesis that rr lyrae variables inooii systems are evolved hb stars that spent their zahb phase on the blue sideof the instability strip. this may suggest that age may not be the primaryexplanation for the oosterhoff types.

1204.5719	a new reddening law for m4	we have used a combination of broad-band near-infrared and opticaljohnson-cousins photometry to study the dust properties in the line of sight tothe galactic globular cluster m4. we have investigated the reddening effects interms of absolute strength and variation across the cluster field, as well asthe form of the reddening law defined by the type of dust. here, we determinethe ratio of absolute to selective extinction (r_v) in the line of sighttowards m4, which is known to be a useful indicator for the type of dust andtherefore characterizes the applicable reddening law. our method is independentof age assumptions and appears to be significantly more precise and accuratethan previous approaches. we obtain a_v/e(b-v)=3.76\pm0.07 (random error) forthe dust in the line of sight to m4 for our set of filters. with this value,the distance to m4 is found to be 1.80\pm0.05 kpc (random error). a reddeningmap for m4 has been created, which reveals a spatial differential reddening ofdelta e(b-v)&gt;0.2 mag across a field within 10' around the cluster centre and atotal mean reddening of e(b-v)=0.37\pm0.01. in order to provide accurate zeropoints for the extinction coefficients of our photometric filters, weinvestigated the impact of stellar parameters such as temperature, surfacegravity and metallicity on the extinction properties in different bandpasses.using both synthetic atlas9 spectra and observed spectral energy distributions,we found similar sized effects for the range of temperature, surface gravity,and metallicity typical of globular cluster stars: each causes a change ofabout 3% in the necessary correction factor for each filter combination. fromour calculations, we provide extinction zero points for johnson-cousins and2mass filters, spanning a wide range of stellar parameters and dust types,suited for accurate, object-specific extinction corrections.

1205.6293	the central blue straggler population in four outer-halo globular  clusters	using hst/wfpc2 data, we have performed a comparative study of the bluestraggler star (bss) populations in the central regions of the globularclusters am 1, eridanus, palomar 3, and palomar 4. located at distances rgc &gt;50 kpc from the galactic centre, these are (together with palomar 14 and ngc2419) the most distant clusters in the halo. we determine theircolour-magnitude diagrams and centres of gravity. the four clusters turn out tohave similar ages (10.5-11 gyr), significantly smaller than those of theinner-halo globulars, and similar metallicities. by exploiting wide fieldground based data, we build the most extended radial density profiles fromresolved star counts ever published for these systems. these are wellreproduced by isotropic king models of relatively low concentration. bsssappear to be significantly more centrally segregated than red giants in allglobular clusters, in agreement with the estimated core and half-massrelaxation times which are smaller than the cluster ages. assuming that this isa signature of mass segregation, we conclude that am 1 and eridanus areslightly dynamically more evolved than pal 3 and pal 4.

1211.3447	the horizontal branch of ngc 1851: constraints from its rr lyrae  variables	we use the pulsational properties of the rr lyrae variables in the globularcluster ngc 1851 to obtain detailed constraints of the various sub-stellarpopulations present along its horizontal branch. on the basis of detailedsynthetic horizontal branch modeling, we find that minor helium variations(y~0.248-0.280) are able to reproduce the observed periods and amplitudes ofthe rr lyrae variables, as well as the frequency of fundamental andfirst-overtone rr lyrae stars. comparison of number ratios amongst the blue andred horizontal branch components and the two observed subgiant branches alsosuggest that the rr lyrae variables originated from the progeny of the brightsubgiant branch. the rr lyrae variables with a slightly enhanced helium(y~0.270-0.280) have longer periods at a given amplitude, as is seen withoosterhoff ii (ooii) rr lyrae variables, whereas the rr lyrae variables withy~0.248-0.270 have shorter periods, exhibiting properties of oosterhoff i (ooi)variables. this correlation does suggest that the pulsational properties of rrlyrae stars can be very useful for tracing the various sub-populations and canprovide suitable constraints on the multiple population phenomenon. it appearsof great interest to explore whether this conclusion can be generalized toother globular clusters hosting multiple populations.

1211.5147	variable stars in the globular cluster ngc 2808	the first calibrated broadband bvi time-series photometry is presented forthe variable stars in ngc 2808, with observations spanning a range oftwenty-eight years. we have also redetermined the variability types and periodsfor the variable stars identified previously by corwin et al, revising thenumber of probable fundamental-mode rr lyrae variables (rr0) to 11 and thenumber of first-overtone variables (rr1) to five. our observations wereinsufficient to discern the nature of the previously identified rr1 star, v24,and the tentatively identified rr1 star, v13. these two variables are \sim0.8mag brighter than the rr lyrae variables, appear to have somewhat erraticperiod and/or luminosity changes, and lie inside the rr lyrae instabilitystrip. curiously, all but one of the rr lyrae stars studied in this relativelymetal-rich cluster exhibit the blazhko phenomenon, an effect thought to occurwith higher frequency in metal-poor environments. the mean periods of the rr0and rr1 variables are &lt;p&gt;_rr0=0.56 pm 0.01 d and &lt;p&gt;_rr1=0.30 pm 0.02 d,respectively, supporting an oosterhoff i classification of the cluster. on theother hand, the number ratio of rr1- to rr0-type variables is high, though notunprecedented, for an oosterhoff i cluster. the rr lyrae variables have noperiod shifts at a given amplitude as compared to the m3 variables, making itunlikely that these variables are he-enhanced. using the recent recalibrationof the rr lyrae luminosity scale by catelan &amp; cortes, a mean distance modulusof (m-m)_v= 15.57 pm 0.13 mag for ngc 2808 is obtained, in good agreement withthat determined here from its type ii cepheid and sx phoenicis population. ourdata have also allowed the discovery of two new candidate sx phoenicis starsand an eclipsing binary in the blue straggler region of the ngc 2808color-magnitude diagram.

1308.4627	particle-physics constraints from the globular cluster m5: neutrino  dipole moments	stellar evolution is modified if energy is lost in a "dark channel" similarto neutrino emission. comparing modified stellar evolution sequences withobservations provides some of the most restrictive limits on axions and otherhypothetical low-mass particles and on non-standard neutrino properties. inparticular, a putative neutrino magnetic dipole moment mu_nu enhances theplasmon decay process, postpones helium ignition in low-mass stars, andtherefore extends the red-giant branch (rgb) in globular clusters (gcs). thebrightness of the tip of the rgb (trgb) remains the most sensitive probe formu_nu and we revisit this argument from a modern perspective. based on a largeset of archival observations, we provide high-precision photometry for thegalactic gc m5 (ngc5904) and carefully determine its trgb position. on thetheoretical side, we add the extra plasmon decay rate brought about by mu_nu tothe princeton-goddard-puc stellar evolution code. different sources ofuncertainty are critically examined. the main source of systematic uncertaintyis the bolometric correction and the main statistical uncertainty derives fromthe distance modulus based on main-sequence fitting. (other measures ofdistance, e.g., the brightness of rr lyrae stars, are influenced by the energyloss that we wish to constrain.) the statistical uncertainty of the trgbposition relative to the brightest rgb star is less important because the rgbis well populated. we infer an absolute i-band brightness of m_i=-4.17+/-0.13mag for the trgb compared with the theoretical prediction of -3.99+/-0.07 mag,in reasonable agreement with each other. a significant brightness increasecaused by neutrino dipole moments is constrained such thatmu_nu&lt;2.6x10^-12mu_b(68% cl), where mu_b is the bohr magneton, andmu_nu&lt;4.5x10^-12 mu_b(95% cl). in these results, statistical and systematicerrors have been combined in quadrature.

1411.7300	weak galactic halo--dwarf spheroidal connection from rr lyrae stars	we discuss the role that dwarf galaxies may have played in the formation ofthe galactic halo (halo) using rr lyrae stars (rrl) as tracers of their ancientstellar component. the comparison is performed using two observables (periods,luminosity amplitudes) that are reddening and distance independent.  fundamental mode rrl in six dwarf spheroidals and eleven ultra faint dwarfgalaxies (1,300) show a gaussian period distribution well peaked around a meanperiod of &lt;pab&gt;=0.610+-0.001 days (sigma=0.03). the halo rrl (15,000) arecharacterized by a broader period distribution.  the fundamental mode rrl in all the dwarf spheroidals apart from sagittariusare completely lacking in high amplitude short period (hasp) variables, definedas those having p&lt; 0.48 days and av&gt; 0.75mag. such variables are not uncommonin the halo and among the globular clusters and massive dwarf irregulars. tofurther interpret this evidence, we considered eighteen globulars covering abroad range in metallicity (-2.3&lt; [fe/h]&lt; -1.1) and hosting more than 35 rrleach.  the metallicity turns out to be the main parameter, since only globulars moremetal--rich than [fe/h] -1.5 host rrl in the hasp region. this finding suggeststhat dsphs similar to the surviving ones do not appear to be the majorbuilding-blocks of the halo. leading physical arguments suggest an extremeupper limit of 50% to their contribution. on the other hand, massive dwarfshosting an old population with a broad metallicity distribution (largemagellanic cloud, sagittarius) may have played a primary role in the formationof the halo.

1506.01180	on the absolute age of the metal-rich globular m71 (ngc 6838): i.  optical photometry	we investigated the absolute age of the galactic globular cluster m71 (ngc6838) by using optical ground-based images (u',g',r',i',z') collected with themegacam camera at the canada-france-hawaii-telescope (cfht). we performed arobust selection of field and cluster stars by applying a new method based onthe 3d (r',u'-g',g'-r') color-color-magnitude-diagram. the comparison betweenthe color-magnitude-diagram of the candidate cluster stars and a new set ofisochrones, at the locus of the main sequence turn off (msto), suggests anabsolute age of 12+/-2 gyr. the absolute age was also estimated using thedifference in magnitude between the msto and the so-called main sequence knee,a well defined bending occurring in the lower main sequence. this feature wasoriginally detected in the near-infrared (nir) bands and explained as aconsequence of an opacity mechanism (collisionally induced absorption ofmolecular hydrogen) in the atmosphere of cool low-mass stars (bono et al.2010). the same feature was also detected in the r',u'-g' and in the r',g'-r'cmd, thus supporting previous theoretical predictions by borysow et al. (1997).the key advantage in using the delta^(knee)_(to) as an age diagnostic is thatit is independent of uncertainties affecting the distance, the reddening andthe photometric zero-point. we found an absolute age of 12+/-1 gyr that agrees,within the errors, with similar age estimates, but the uncertainty is onaverage a factor of two smaller. we also found that the delta^(knee)_(to) ismore sensitive to the metallicity than the msto, but the dependence becomesvanishing using the difference in color between the msk and the msto.

astro-ph;0012377	a revised cepheid distance to ngc 4258 and a test of the distance scale	in a previous paper (maoz et al. 1999), we reported a hubble space telescope(hst) cepheid distance to the galaxy ngc 4258 obtained using the calibrationsand methods then standard for the key project on the extragalactic distancescale. here, we reevaluate the cepheid distance using the revised key projectprocedures described in freedman et al. (2001). these revisions alter the zeropoints and slopes of the cepheid period-luminosity (p-l) relations derived atthe large magellanic cloud (lmc), the calibration of the hst wfpc2 camera, andthe treatment of metallicity differences. we also provide herein fullinformation on the cepheids described in maoz et al. 1999. using the refinedkey project techniques and calibrations, we determine the distance modulus ofngc 4258 to be 29.47 +/- 0.09 mag (unique to this determination) +/- 0.15 mag(systematic uncertainties in key project distances), corresponding to a metricdistance of 7.8 +/- 0.3 +/- 0.5 mpc and 1.2 sigma from the maser distance of7.2 +/- 0.5 mpc. we also test the alternative cepheid p-l relations of feast(1999), which yield more discrepant results. additionally, we place weak limitsupon the distance to the lmc and upon the effect of metallicity in cepheiddistance determinations.

astro-ph;0109458	the star formation history of the large magellanic cloud	using wfpc2 aboard the hubble space telescope, we have created deepcolor-magnitude diagrams in the v and i passbands for approximately 100,000stars in a field at the center of the lmc bar and another in the disk. themain--sequence luminosity functions (lfs) from 19 mag &lt; v &lt; 23.5 mag, the redclump and horizontal branch morphologies, and the differential hess diagram ofthe two fields all strongly imply that the disk and bar have significantlydifferent star-formation histories (sfhs). the disk's sfh has been relativelysmooth and continuous over the last 15 gyr while the bar's sfh was dominated bystar formation episodes at intermediate ages. comparison of the lf againstpredictions based on padova theoretical stellar evolution models and an assumedage-metallicity relationship allows us to identify the dominant stellarpopulations in the bar with episodes of star formation that occurred from 4 to6 and 1 to 2 gyr ago. these events accounted, respectively, for approximately25% and 15% of its stellar mass. the disk field may share a mild enhancement insf for the younger episode, and thus we identify the 4 to 6 gyr episode withthe formation of the lmc bar.

astro-ph;0210121	carbon abundances of faint stars in m13 - evidence for two abundance  altering mechanisms	we present an analysis of ch band strengths in keck lris spectra of a sampleof 81 stars in m13 within 2 magnitudes of the main-sequence turnoff. thesubgiants clearly exhibit a substantial (a factor of ~ 6) spread in [c/fe].moreover, the bulk of the subgiants possess c abundances larger than thosefound among their more luminous counterparts. the turnoff stars themselves aretoo warm for appreciable ch formation, but the relatively small range in theobserved ch band strength for stars just below the turnoff neverthelesstranslates into this same spread in [c/fe]. still fainter, the sample size issmall, but the same range in [c/fe] appears to be present. on the basis ofthese observations we suggest that a process external to the present stars hasresulted in a substantial star-to-star dispersion in [c/fe] (and possibly otherlight elements) among all stars in m13. in addition, the surface c abundancesamong the more luminous stars have been further modified by the operation of aninternal deep-mixing mechanism during red giant branch ascent. the amplitude ofthe scatter we find in [c/fe] at all luminosities may prove difficult toexplain via accretion from intermediate mass agb stars as the external"polluting" mechanism.

astro-ph;0304036	the galactic inner halo: searching for white dwarfs and measuring the  fundamental galactic constant, vo/ro	we establish an extragalactic, zero-motion frame of reference within thedeepest optical image of a globular star cluster, an hst 123-orbit exposure ofm4 (go 8679, cycle 9). the line of sight beyond m4 (l,b (deg) = 351,16)intersects the inner halo (spheroid) of our galaxy at a tangent-point distanceof 7.6 kpc (for ro = 8 kpc). we isolate these spheroid stars from the clusterbased on their proper motions over the 6-year baseline between these andprevious epoch hst data (go 5461, cycle 4). distant background galaxies arealso found on the same sight line using image-morphology techniques. this fixedreference frame allows us to independently determine the fundamental galacticconstant, vo/ro = 25.3 +/- 2.6 km/s/kpc, thus providing a velocity of the localstandard of rest, v = 202.7 +/- 24.7 km/s for ro = 8.0 +/- 0.5 kpc. secondly,the galaxies allow a direct measurement of m4's absolute proper motion,mu_total = 22.57 +/- 0.76 mas/yr, in excellent agreement with recent studies.the clear separation of galaxies from stars in these deep data also allow us tosearch for inner-halo white dwarfs. we model the conventional galacticcontributions of white dwarfs along our line of sight and predict 7.9 (thindisk), 6.3 (thick disk) and 2.2 (spheroid) objects to the limiting magnitude atwhich we can clearly delineate stars from galaxies (v = 29). an additional 2.5objects are expected from a 20% white dwarf dark halo consisting of 0.5 moobjects, 70% of which are of the da type. after considering the kinematics andmorphology of the objects in our data set, we find the number of white dwarfsto be consistent with the predictions for each of the conventional populations.however, we do not find any evidence for dark halo white dwarfs.

astro-ph;0312315	the chemical inhomogeneity of faint m13 stars: c and n abundances	building upon earlier observations which demonstrate substantial star-to-stardifferences in the carbon abundances of m13 subgiants, we present new keck lrisspectra reaching more that 1.5 mag below the m13 main-sequence turn-off (to v ~20). our analysis reveals a distribution of c abundances similar to that foundamong the subgiants, implying little change in the compositions of the m13stars at least through the main-sequence turn-off. we presume these differencesto be the result of some process operating early in the cluster history.  additional spectra of previously studied bright m13 giants have been obtainedwith the hale 5-m. a comparison of c abundances derived using the presentmethods and those from the literature yield a mean difference of 0.03+-0.14 dexfor four stars in common with smith et al. (1996) and 0.14+-0.07 dex for starsalso observed by suntzeff (1981) (if one extreme case is removed). we concludethat the lower surface c abundances of these luminous giants as compared to thesubgiants and main-sequence stars are likely the result of mixing rather than adifference in our abundance scales.  nh band strengths have also been measured for a handful of the most luminousm13 turn-off stars. while molecular band formation in such stars is weak,significant star-to-star nh band strength differences are present. moreover,for the stars with both c and n measurements, differences between stars inthese two elements appear to be anticorrelated.  finally, the most recent c and n abundances for main-sequence, main-sequenceturn-off, and subgiant stars in 47 tuc, m71, m5, and the present m13 data arecompared.

[ca/fe], [ti/fe], and [v/fe] in the lmc, however,are significantly lower than what is seen in the galactic globular clustersystem. neither does the behavior of [cu/fe] as a function of [fe/h] in our lmcclusters match the trend seen in the galaxy, staying instead at a constantvalue of ~0.8. because not all [alpha/fe] ratios are suppressed, theseabundance ratios cannot be attributed solely to the injection of type ia snematerial, and instead reflect the differences in star formation history of thelmc vs. the milky way. we conclude that many of the abundances in the lmcglobular clusters we observed are distinct from those observed in the milkyway, and these differences are intrinsic to the stars in those systems.

astro-ph;9605064	the relative ages of galactic globular clusters	we discuss the present state of knowledge and thought concerning the spreadin age found among galactic globular clusters, with some discussion of theimplications for what happened during the earliest stages of the formation ofthe milky way galaxy. differential observational techniques to derive therelative age differences among clusters of similar metallicity are discussed indetail. we conclude that as of the current date (mid-april 1996) the state ofthe field is still somewhat muddled. however, we believe that there is now asubstantial body of evidence --- including a particularly revealingintercomparison of the color-magnitude diagrams of \ngc{1851}, \ngc{288}, and\ngc{362} presented here --- indicating that age is {\it not\/} the dominantsecond parameter determining the shape of globular clusters' horizontalbranches. if our assertion is correct, then apart from a handful of anomalousclusters that may well have been captured from a satellite dwarf galaxy, thereis no strong evidence either for a significant spread in age among clusters ofa given metal abundance or for a systematic variation of mean age withgalactocentric distance. on the question of whether there is a significant agedifference between metal-poor and metal-rich clusters, we feel compelled tofall back on the scottish verdict: ``unproven.'' data now being collected bynumerous groups in various subdisciplines may resolve the remaining controversywithin a few years.

astro-ph;9607094	hubble space telescope observations of m32: the color-magnitude diagram	we present a v-i color-magnitude diagram for a region 1'-2' from the centerof m32 based on hubble space telescope wfpc2 images. the broad color-luminositydistribution of red giants shows that the stellar population comprises starswith a wide range in metallicity. this distribution cannot be explained by aspread in age. the blue side of the giant branch rises to m_i ~ -4.0 and can befitted with isochrones having [fe/h] ~ -1.5. the red side consists of a heavilypopulated and dominant sequence that tops out at m_i ~ -3.2, and extends beyondv-i=4. this sequence can be fitted with isochrones with -0.2 &lt; [fe/h] &lt; +0.1,for ages running from 15 gyr to 5 gyr respectively. we do not find theoptically bright asymptotic giant branch stars seen in previous ground-basedwork and argue that the majority of them were artifacts of crowding. ourresults are consistent with the presence of the infrared-luminous giants foundin ground-based studies, though their existence cannot be directly confirmed byour data. there is little evidence for an extended or even a red horizontalbranch, but we find a strong clump on the giant branch itself. if the agespread is not extreme, the distribution of metallicities in m32 is considerablynarrower than that of the closed-box model of chemical evolution, and alsoappears somewhat narrower than that of the solar neighborhood. overall, the m32hst color-magnitude diagram is consistent with the average luminosity-weightedage of 8.5 gyr and [fe/h] = -0.25 inferred from integrated spectral indices.

(1998) using thehst/wfpc2. combined with cluster velocities corrected for a cosmological flowmodel, these distances imply a value of the hubble constant of h0 = 69 +/- 4(random) +/- 6 (systematic) km/s/mpc. this result assumes that the cepheid plrelation is independent of the metallicity of the variable stars; adopting ametallicity correction as in kennicutt et al.

astro-ph;9910501	a database of cepheid distance moduli and trgb, gclf, pnlf and sbf data  useful for distance determinations	we present a compilation of cepheid distance moduli and data for foursecondary distance indicators that employ stars in the old stellar populations:the planetary nebula luminosity function (pnlf), the globular clusterluminosity function (gclf), the tip of the red giant branch (trgb), and thesurface brightness fluctuation (sbf) method. the database includes all datapublished as of july 15, 1999. the main strength of this compilation resides inall data being on a consistent and homogeneous system: all cepheid distancesare derived using the same calibration of the period-luminosity relation, thetreatment of errors is consistent for all indicators, measurements which arenot considered reliable are excluded. as such, the database is ideal forinter-comparing any of the distance indicators considered, or for deriving acepheid calibration to any secondary distance indicator. specifically, thedatabase includes: 1) cepheid distances, extinctions and metallicities; 2)apparent magnitudes of the pnlf cutoff; 3) apparent magnitudes and colors ofthe turnover of the gclf (both in the v- and b-bands); 4) apparent magnitudesof the trgb (in the i-band) and v-i colors at and 0.5 magnitudes fainter thanthe trgb; 5) apparent surface brightness fluctuation magnitudes i, k', k_short,and using the f814w filter with the hst/wfpc2. in addition, for every galaxy inthe database we give reddening estimates from dirbe/iras as well as hi maps,j2000 coordinates, hubble and t-type morphological classification, apparenttotal magnitude in b, and systemic velocity.

astro-ph;9911193	photometric recovery of crowded stellar fields observed with hst/wfpc2  and the effects of confusion noise on the extragalactic distance scale	we explore the limits of photometric reductions of crowded stellar fieldsobserved with the wide field and planetary camera 2 on board the hubble spacetelescope. two photometric procedures, based on the dophot and daophot/allframeprograms are tested, and the effects of crowding, complex sky background andcosmic-ray contamination are discussed using an extensive set of artificialstar simulations. as a specific application of the results presented in thispaper, we assess the magnitude of photometric biases on programs aimed atfinding cepheids and determining distances. we find that while the photometryin individual images can be biased too bright by up to 0.2 mag in the mostcrowded fields due to confusion noise, the effects on distance measurementsbased on cepheid variables are insignificant, less than 0.02 mag (1% indistance) even in the most problematic cases. this result, which is at oddswith claims recently surfaced in the literature, is due to the strict criteriaapplied in the selection of the variable stars, and the photometric crosschecks made possible by the availability of multiple exposures in differentfilters which characterizes cepheid observations.

0810.2557	the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury i. the star formation history of  the m81 outer disk	the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury (angst) is a large hubble spacetelescope (hst) advanced camera for surveys (acs) treasury program to obtainresolved stellar photometry for a volume-limited sample of galaxies out to 4mpc. as part of this program, we have obtained deep acs imaging of a field inthe outer disk of the large spiral galaxy m81. the field contains the outskirtsof a spiral arm as well as an area containing no current star formation. ourimaging results in a color-magnitude diagram (cmd) reaching to f814w = 28.8 andf606w = 29.5, one magnitude fainter than the red clump. through detailedmodeling of the full cmd, we quantify the age and metallicity distribution ofthe stellar populations contained in the field. the mean metallicity in thefield is -1&lt;[m/h]&lt;0 and only a small fraction of stars have ages &lt;~1 gyr. theresults show that most of the stars in this outer disk field were formed by z~1and that the arm structure at this radius has a lifetime of &gt;~100 myr. wediscuss the measured evolution of the m81 disk in the context of surveys ofhigh-redshift disk galaxies and deep stellar photometry of other nearbygalaxies. all of these indicate that massive spiral disks are mostly formed byz~1 and that they have experienced rapid metal enrichment.
