0902.3392	evolution of cluster red-sequence galaxies from redshift 0.8 to 0.4:  ages, metallicities and morphologies	we present a comprehensive analysis of the stellar population properties(age, metallicity and the alpha-element enhancement [e/fe]) and morphologies ofred-sequence galaxies in 24 clusters and groups from z~0.75 to z~0.45. thedataset, consisting of 215 spectra drawn from the eso distant cluster survey,constitutes the largest spectroscopic sample at these redshifts for which suchan analysis has been conducted. analysis reveals that the evolution of thestellar population properties of red-sequence galaxies depend on their mass:while the properties of most massive are well described by passive evolutionand high-redshift formation, the less massive galaxies require a more extendedstar formation history. we show that these scenarios reproduce the index-sigmarelations as well as the galaxy colours. the two main results of this work are(1) the evolution of the line-strength indices for the red-sequence galaxiescan be reproduced if 40% of the galaxies with sigma &lt; 175 km/s entered thered-sequence between z=0.75 to z=0.45, in agreement with the fraction derivedin studies of the luminosity functions, and (2) the percentage the red-sequencegalaxies exhibiting early-type morphologies (e and s0) decreases by 20% fromz=0.75 to z=0.45. this can be understood if the red-sequence gets populated atlater times with disc galaxies whose star formation has been quenched. weconclude that the processes quenching star formation do not necessarily producea simultaneous morphological transformation of the galaxies entering thered-sequence.

0909.2258	the roadmap for unification in galaxy group selection:. i. a search for  extended x-ray emission in the cnoc2 survey	x-ray properties of galaxy groups can unlock some of the most challengingresearch topics in modern extragalactic astronomy: the growth of structure andits influence on galaxy formation. only with the advent of the chandra and xmmfacilities have x-ray observations reached the depths required to address thesequestions in a satisfactory manner. here we present an x-ray imaging study oftwo patches from the cnoc2 spectroscopic galaxy survey using combined chandraand xmm data. a state of the art extended source finding algorithm has beenapplied, and the resultant source catalog, including redshifts from aspectroscopic follow-up program, is presented. the total number ofspectroscopically identified groups is 25 spanning a redshift range 0.04-0.79.approximately 50% of cnoc2 spectroscopically selected groups in the deeperx-ray (ra14h) field are likely x-ray detections, compared to 20% in theshallower (ra21h) field. statistical modeling shows that this is consistentwith expectations, assuming an expected evolution of the lx-m relation. asignificant detection of a stacked shear signal for both spectroscopic andx-ray groups indicates that both samples contain real groups of about theexpected mass. we conclude that the current area and depth of x-ray andspectroscopic facilities provide a unique window of opportunity at z~0.4 totest the x-ray appearance of galaxy groups selected in various ways. there isat present no evidence that the correlation between x-ray luminosity andvelocity dispersion evolves significantly with redshift, which implies thatcatalogs based on either method can be fairly compared and modeled.

0910.5418	photometric redshifts and cluster tomography in the eso distant cluster  survey	this paper reports the results obtained on the photometric redshiftsmeasurement and accuracy, and cluster tomography in the eso distant clustersurvey (ediscs) fields. photometric redshifts were computed using twoindependent codes (hyperz and g. rudnick's code). the accuracy of photometricredshifts was assessed by comparing our estimates with the spectroscopicredshifts of ~1400 galaxies in the 0.3&lt;z&lt;1.0 domain. the accuracy for galaxiesfainter than the spectroscopic control sample was estimated using a degradedversion of the photometric catalog for the spectroscopic sample. the accuracyof photometric redshifts is typically sigma(delta z/(1+z)) ~ 0.05+/-0.01,depending on the field, the filter set, and the spectral type of the galaxies.the quality of the photometric redshifts degrades by a factor of two insigma(delta z/(1+z)) between the brightest (i~22) and the faintest (i~24-24.5)galaxies in the ediscs sample. the photometric determination of clusterredshifts in the ediscs fields using a simple algorithm based on photoz is inexcellent agreement with the spectroscopic values (delta(z) ~0.03-0.04 in thehigh-z sample and ~0.05 in the low-z sample). we also developed a method thatuses both photz codes jointly to reject interlopers at magnitudes fainter thanthe spectroscopic limit. when applied to the spectroscopic sample, this methodrejects ~50-90% of all spectroscopically confirmed non-members, while retainingat least 90% of all confirmed members. photometric redshifts are found to beparticularly useful for the identification and study of clusters of galaxies inlarge surveys. they enable efficient and complete pre-selection of clustermembers for spectroscopy, allow accurate determinations of the clusterredshifts, and provide a means of determining cluster membership.

0910.5590	the old and heavy bulge of m31 i. kinematics and stellar populations	we present new optical long-slit data along 6 position angles of the bulgeregion of m31. we derive accurate stellar and gas kinematics reaching 5 arcminfrom the center, where the disk light contribution is always less than 30%, andout to 8 arcmin along the major axis, where the disk makes 55% of the totallight. we show that the velocity dispersions of mcelroy (1983) are severelyunderestimated (by up to 50 km/s) and previous dynamical models haveunderestimated the stellar mass of m31's bulge by a factor 2. moreover, thelight-weighted velocity dispersion of the galaxy grows to 166 km/s, thusreducing the discrepancy between the predicted and measured mass of the blackhole at the center of m31. the kinematic position angle varies with distance,pointing to triaxiality. we detect gas counterrotation near the bulge minoraxis. we measure eight emission-corrected lick indices. they are approximatelyconstant on circles. we derive the age, metallicity and alpha-elementoverabundance profiles. except for the region in the inner arcsecs of thegalaxy, the bulge of m31 is uniformly old (&gt;12 gyr, with many best-fit ages atthe model grid limit of 15 gyr), slightly alpha-elements overabundant([alpha/fe]~0.2) and at solar metallicity, in agreement with studies of theresolved stellar components. the predicted u-g, g-r and r-i sloan colorprofiles match reasonably well the dust-corrected observations. the stellarpopulations have approximately radially constant mass-to-light ratios (m/l_r ~4-4.5 for a kroupa imf), in agreement with stellar dynamical estimates based onour new velocity dispersions. in the inner arcsecs the luminosity-weighted agedrops to 4-8 gyr, while the metallicity increases to above 3 times the solarvalue.

0708.2205	axisymmetric orbit models of n-body merger remnants: a dependency of  reconstructed mass on viewing angle	we model mock observations of collisionless n-body disc-disc mergers with anaxisymmetric orbit superposition program that has been used to model comaellipticals. the remnants sample representatively the shapes of disc-discmergers including prolate, triaxial and oblate objects. the aim is to betterunderstand how the assumption of axial symmetry affects reconstructed massesand stellar motions of systems which are intrinsically not axisymmetric,whether it leads to a bias and how such a potential bias can be recognised inmodels of real galaxies. the mass recovery at the half-light radius depends onviewing-angle and intrinsic shape: edge-on views allow to reconstruct totalmasses with an accuracy between 20% (triaxial/prolate remnants) and 3% (oblateremnant). masses of highly flattened, face-on systems are underestimated by upto 50%. deviations in local mass densities can be larger where remnants arestrongly triaxial or prolate. luminous m/l are sensitive to box orbits in theremnants. box orbits cause the central kinematics to vary with viewing-angle.reconstructed luminous m/l and central masses follow this variation. luminousm/l are always underestimated (up to a factor of 2.5). respective dark halos inthe models can be overestimated by about the same amount, depending again onviewing angle. reconstructed velocity anisotropies depend on viewing angle andon the orbital composition of the remnant. we construct n-body realisations ofthe schwarzschild models to discuss chaotic orbits and the virial equilibriumin our models. apparently flattened, rotating ellipticals of intermediate massare likely close to both, axial symmetry and edge-on orientation. our resultsimply that schwarzschild models allow a reconstruction of their masses andstellar anisotropies with high accuracy.

1007.4447	superdense massive galaxies in the eso distant cluster survey (ediscs)	we find a significant number of massive and compact galaxies in clusters fromthe eso distant clusters survey (ediscs) at 0.4&lt;z&lt;1. they have similar stellarmasses, ages, sizes and axial ratios to local z~0.04 compact galaxies in wingsclusters, and to z=1.4-2 massive and passive galaxies found in the generalfield. if non-bcg cluster galaxies of all densities, morphologies and spectraltypes are considered, the median size of ediscs galaxies is only a factor 1.18smaller than in wings. we show that for morphologically selected samples, themorphological evolution taking place in a significant fraction of galaxiesduring the last gyrs may introduce an apparent, spurious evolution of size withredshift, which is actually due to intrinsic differences in the selectedsamples. we conclude that the median mass-size relation of cluster galaxiesdoes not evolve significantly from z~0.7 to z~0.04. in contrast, the masses andsizes of bcgs and galaxies with m*&gt;4x10^11 msun have significantly increased bya factor of 2 and 4, respectively, confirming the results of a number of recentworks on the subject. our findings show that progenitor bias effects play animportant role in the size-growth paradigm of massive and passive galaxies.

1009.0645	the fundamental plane of ediscs galaxies - the effect of size evolution	we study the evolution of spectral early-type galaxies in clusters, groupsand the field up to redshift 0.9 using the ediscs dataset. we measure re, ie,and sigma for 154 cluster and 68 field galaxies. we study the evolution of thezero point of the fundamental plane (fp) and confirm results in the literature,but now also for the low cluster velocity dispersion regime. the mass-to-lightratio varies as delta log m/l_b=(-0.54+-0.01)z=(-1.61+-0.01)log(1+z) inclusters, independent of their velocity dispersion. the evolution is stronger(delta log m/l_b=(-0.76+-0.01)z=(-2.27+-0.03)log(1+z)) for field galaxies. thefp residuals correlate with galaxy mass and become progressively negative atlow masses. the effect is visible at z&gt;=0.7 for cluster galaxies and at z&gt;=0.5for field galaxies. we investigate the size evolution of our galaxy sample. wefind that the half-luminosity radius for a galaxy with a dynamical or stellarmass of 2x10^11 msol varies as (1+z)^{-1.0+-0.3} for both cluster and fieldgalaxies. at the same time, stellar velocity dispersions grow with redshift, as(1+z)^{0.59+-0.10} at constant dynamical mass, and as (1+z)^{0.34+- 0.14} atconstant stellar mass. the measured size evolution reduces to re (1+z)^{-0.5+-0.2} and sigma (1+z)^{0.41+-0.08}, at fixed dynamical masses, and re(1+z)^{-0.68+-0.4} and sigma (1+z)^{0.19+-0.10}, at fixed stellar masses, whenthe progenitor bias (galaxies that locally are of spectroscopic early-type, butnot very old, disappear from the ediscs high-redshift sample; these galaxiestend to be large in size) is taken into account. taken together, the variationsin size and velocity dispersion imply that the luminosity evolution withredshift derived from the zero point of the fp is somewhat milder than thatderived without taking these variations into account.

0709.0691	dynamical modelling of luminous and dark matter in 17 coma early-type  galaxies	dynamical models for 17 coma early-type galaxies are presented. the galaxysample consists of flattened, rotating as well as non-rotating early-typesincluding cd and s0 galaxies with luminosities between m=-18.79 and m=-22.56.kinematical long-slit observations cover at least the major and minor axis andextend to 1-4 effective radii. axisymmetric schwarzschild models are used toderive stellar mass-to-light ratios and dark halo parameters. in every galaxymodels with a dark matter halo match the data better than models without. thestatistical significance is over 95 percent for 8 galaxies, around 90 percentfor 5 galaxies and for four galaxies it is not significant. for the highlysignificant cases systematic deviations between observed and modelledkinematics are clearly seen; for the remaining galaxies differences are morestatistical in nature. best-fit models contain 10-50 percent dark matter insidethe half-light radius. the central dark matter density is at least one order ofmagnitude lower than the luminous mass density. the central phase-space densityof dark matter is often orders of magnitude lower than in the luminouscomponent, especially when the halo core radius is large. the orbital system ofthe stars along the major-axis is slightly dominated by radial motions. somegalaxies show tangential anisotropy along the minor-axis, which is correlatedwith the minor-axis gauss-hermite coefficient h4. changing the balance betweendata-fit and regularisation constraints does not change the reconstructed massstructure significantly. model anisotropies tend to strengthen if the weight onregularisation is reduced, but the general property of a galaxy to be radiallyor tangentially anisotropic, respectively, does not change.

1103.3414	dynamical masses of early-type galaxies: a comparison to lensing results  and implications for the stellar imf and the distribution of dark matter	this work aims to study the distribution of luminous and dark matter in comaearly-type galaxies. dynamical masses obtained under the assumption that massfollows light do not match with the masses of strong gravitational lens systemsof similar velocity dispersions. instead, dynamical fits with dark matter halosare in good agreement with lensing results. we derive mass-to-light ratios ofthe stellar populations from lick absorption line indices, reproducing well theobserved galaxy colours. even in dynamical models with dark matter halos theamount of mass that follows the light increases more rapidly with galaxyvelocity dispersion than expected for a constant stellar initial mass function(imf). while galaxies around sigma ~ 200 km/s are consistent with a kroupa imf,the same imf underpredicts luminous dynamical masses of galaxies with sigma ~300 km/s by a factor of two and more. a systematic variation of the stellar imfwith galaxy velocity dispersion could explain this trend with a salpeter imffor the most massive galaxies. if the imf is instead constant, then some of thedark matter in high velocity dispersion galaxies must follow a spatialdistribution very similar to that of the light. a combination of both, avarying imf and a component of dark matter that follows the light is possibleas well. for a subsample of galaxies with old stellar populations we show thatthe tilt in the fundamental plane can be explained by systematic variations ofthe total (stellar + dark) mass inside the effective radius. we tested commonlyused mass estimator formulae, finding them accurate at the 20-30% level.

1306.1124	the influence of dark matter halos on dynamical estimates of black hole  mass: ten new measurements for high-sigma early-type galaxies	adaptive-optics assisted sinfoni observations of the central regions of tenearly-type galaxies are presented. based primarily on the sinfoni kinematics,ten black hole masses occupying the high-mass regime of the m_bh-sigma relationare derived using three-integral schwarzschild models. the effect of darkmatter inclusion on the black hole mass is explored. the omission of a darkmatter halo in the model results in a higher stellar mass-to-light ratio,especially when extensive kinematic data are used in the model. however, whenthe diameter of the sphere of influence -- computed using the black hole massderived without a dark halo -- is at least 10 times the psf fwhm during theobservations, it is safe to exclude a dark matter component in the dynamicalmodeling, i.e. the change in black hole mass is negligible. when the spatialresolution is marginal, restricting the mass-to-light ratio to the right valuereturns the correct m_bh although dark halo is not present in the model.compared to the m_bh-sigma and m_bh-l relations of mcconnell et al. (2011), theten black holes are all more massive than expected from the luminosities andseven black hole masses are higher than expected from the stellar velocitydispersions of the host bulges. using new fitted relations which include theten galaxies, we find that the space density of the most massive black holes(m_bh &gt;~ 10^9 msun) estimated from the m_bh-l relation is higher than theestimate based on the m_bh-sigma relation and the latter is higher than modelpredictions based on quasar counts, each by about an order of magnitude.

1310.5310	depleted galaxy cores and dynamical black hole masses	shallow cores in bright, massive galaxies are commonly thought to be theresult of scouring of stars by mergers of binary supermassive black holes. pastinvestigations have suggested correlations between the central black hole massand the stellar light or mass deficit in the core, using proxy measurements of$m_{\rm bh}$ or stellar mass-to-light ratios ($\upsilon$). drawing on a wealthof dynamical models which provide both $m_{\rm bh}$ and $\upsilon$, we identifycores in 23 galaxies, of which 20 have direct, reliable measurements of $m_{\rmbh}$ and dynamical stellar mass-to-light ratios ($\upsilon_{\star,{\rm dyn}}$).these cores are identified and measured using core-s\'ersic model fits tosurface brightness profiles which extend out to large radii (typically morethan the effective radius of the galaxy); for approximately one fourth of thegalaxies, the best fit includes an outer (\sersic) envelope component. we findthat the core radius is most strongly correlated with the black hole mass andthat it correlates better with total galaxy luminosity than it does withvelocity dispersion. the strong core-size-- $m_{\rm bh}$ correlation enablesestimation of black hole masses (in core galaxies) with an accuracy comparableto the $m_{\rm bh}$--$\sigma$ relation (rms scatter of 0.30 dex in $\log m_{\rmbh}$), without the need for spectroscopy. the light and mass deficits correlatemore strongly with galaxy velocity dispersion than they do with black holemass. stellar mass deficits span a range of 0.2--39 \mbh, with almost all (87%)being $&lt; 10 \, m_{\rm bh}$; the median value is 2.2 $m_{\rm bh}$.

1311.3783	the dynamical fingerprint of core scouring in massive elliptical  galaxies	the most massive elliptical galaxies have low-density centers or cores thatdiffer dramatically from the high-density centers of less massive ellipticalsand bulges of disk galaxies. these cores have been interpreted as the result ofmergers of supermassive black hole binaries, which depopulate galaxy centers bygravitationally slingshotting central stars toward large radii. such binariesnaturally form in mergers of luminous galaxies. here, we analyze the populationof central stellar orbits in 11 massive elliptical galaxies that we observedwith the integral field spectrograph sinfoni at the european southernobservatory very large telescope. our dynamical analysis is orbit-based andincludes the effects of a central black hole, the mass distribution of thestars, and a dark matter halo. we show that the use of integral fieldkinematics and the inclusion of dark matter is important to conclude upon thedistribution of stellar orbits in galaxy centers. six of our galaxies are coregalaxies. in these six galaxies, but not in the galaxies without cores, wedetect a coherent lack of stars on radial orbits in the core region and auniform excess of radial orbits outside of it: when scaled by the core radius,the radial profiles of the classical anisotropy parameter beta are nearlyidentical in core galaxies. moreover, they match quantitatively the predictionsof black hole binary simulations, providing the first convincing dynamicalevidence for core scouring in the most massive elliptical galaxies.

1312.0604	molecular gas in the centre of nearby galaxies from vlt/sinfoni integral  field spectroscopy - ii. kinematics	we present an analysis of the h2 emission-line gas kinematics in the inner &lt;4 arcsec radius of six nearby spiral galaxies, based on ao-assistedintegral-field observations obtained in the k-band with sinfoni/vlt. four ofthe six galaxies in our sample display ordered h2 velocity fields, consistentwith gas moving in the plane of the galaxy and rotating in the same directionas the stars. however, the gas kinematics is typically far from simple circularmotion. we can classify the observed velocity fields into four different typesof flows, ordered by increasing complexity: (1) circular motion in a disc(ngc3351); (2) oval motion in the galaxy plane (ngc3627 and ngc4536); (3)streaming motion superimposed on circular rotation (ngc4501); and (4)disordered streaming motions (ngc4569 and ngc4579). the h2 velocity dispersionin the galaxies is usually higher than 50 km/s in the inner 1-2 arcsec radii.the four galaxies with ordered kinematics have v/sigma &lt; 1 at radii less than40-80 pc. the radius at which v/sigma = 1 is independent of the type of nuclearactivity. while the low values of v/sigma could be taken as an indication of athick disc in the innermost regions of the galaxies, other lines of evidence(e.g. h2 morphologies and velocity fields) argue for a thin disc interpretationin the case of ngc3351 and ngc4536. we discuss the implications of the highvalues of velocity dispersion for the dynamics of the gaseous disc and suggestcaution when interpreting the velocity dispersion of ionized and warm tracersas being entirely dynamical. understanding the nature and role of the velocitydispersion in the gas dynamics, together with the full 2d information of thegas, is essential for obtaining accurate black hole masses from gas kinematics.

1409.0859	evolution of central dark matter of early-type galaxies up to z ~ 0.8	we investigate the evolution of dark and luminous matter in the centralregions of early-type galaxies (etgs) up to z ~ 0.8. we use a spectroscopicallyselected sample of 154 cluster and field galaxies from the ediscs survey,covering a wide range in redshifts (z ~ 0.4-0.8), stellar masses ($\logm_{\star}/ m_{\odot}$ ~ 10.5-11.5 dex) and velocity dispersions($\sigma_{\star}$ ~ 100-300 \, km/s). we obtain central dark matter (dm)fractions by determining the dynamical masses from jeans modelling of galaxyaperture velocity dispersions and the $m_{\star}$ from galaxy colours, andcompare the results with local samples. we discuss how the correlations ofcentral dm with galaxy size (i.e. the effective radius, $r_{\rm e}$),$m_{\star}$ and $\sigma_{\star}$ evolve as a function of redshift, findingclear indications that local galaxies are, on average, more dm dominated thantheir counterparts at larger redshift. this dm fraction evolution with $z$ canbe only partially interpreted as a consequence of the size-redshift evolution.we discuss our results within galaxy formation scenarios, and conclude that thegrowth in size and dm content which we measure within the last 7 gyr isincompatible with passive evolution, while it is well reproduced in themultiple minor merger scenario. we also discuss the impact of the imf on our dminferences and argue that this can be non-universal with the lookback time. inparticular, we find the salpeter imf can be better accommodated by low redshiftsystems, while producing stellar masses at high-$z$ which are unphysicallylarger than the estimated dynamical masses (particularly forlower-$\sigma_{\star}$ systems).

astro-ph;0007038	the evolution of the color gradients of early-type cluster galaxies	we investigate the origin of color gradients in cluster early-type galaxiesto probe whether pure age or pure metallicity gradients can explain theobserved data in local and distant (z approx 0.4) samples. we measure thesurface brightness profiles of the 20 brightest early-type galaxies ofcl0949+44 (hereafter cl0949) at redshift z=0.35-0.38 from hst wf2 frames takenin the filters f555w, f675w, f814w. we determine the color profiles (v-r)(r),(v-i)(r), and (r-i)(r) as a function of the radial distance r in arcsec, andfit logarithmic gradients in the range -0.2 to 0.1 mag per decade. these valuesare similar to what is found locally for the colors (u-b), (u-v), (b-v) whichapproximately match the (v-r), (v-i), (r-i) at redshift approx 0.4. we analysethe results with up to date stellar population models. we find that passiveevolution of metallicity gradients (approx 0.2 dex per radial decade) providesa consistent explanation of the local and distant galaxies' data. invoking pureage gradients (with fixed metallicity) to explain local color gradientsproduces too steep gradients at redshifts z approx 0.4. pure age gradients areconsistent with the data only if large present day ages (&gt;=15 gyr) are assumedfor the galaxy centers.

astro-ph;0008418	the peculiar motions of early-type galaxies in two distant regions -  vii. peculiar velocities and bulk motions	we present peculiar velocities for 84 clusters of galaxies in two largevolumes at distances between 6000 and 15000 km/s in the directions ofhercules-corona borealis and perseus-pisces-cetus. these velocities are basedon fundamental plane (fp) distance estimates for early-type galaxies in eachcluster. we fit the fp using a maximum likelihood algorithm which accounts forboth selection effects and measurement errors, and yields fp parameters withsmaller bias and variance than other fitting procedures. we find a best-fit fpwith coefficients consistent with the best existing determinations. we measurethe bulk motions of the sample volumes using the 50 clusters with thebest-determined peculiar velocities. we find the bulk motions in both regionsare small, and consistent with zero at about the 5% level. the efar results arein agreement with the small bulk motions found by dale et al. (1999) on similarscales, but are inconsistent with pure dipole motions having the largeamplitudes found by lauer &amp; postman (1994) and hudson et al. (1999). thealignment of the efar sample with the lauer &amp; postman dipole produces a strongrejection of a large-amplitude bulk motion in that direction, but the rejectionof the hudson et al. result is less certain because their dipole lies at alarge angle to the main axis of the efar sample. we find the bulk motion of oursample is consistent with most cosmological models that approximately reproducethe shape and normalisation of the observed galaxy power spectrum. we concludethat existing measurements of large-scale bulk motions provide no significantevidence against standard models for the formation of structure.

astro-ph;0012381	dynamical family properties and dark halo scaling relations of giant  elliptical galaxies	based on a uniform dynamical analysis of line-profile shapes for 21 luminousround elliptical galaxies, we have investigated the dynamical family relationsof ellipticals: (i) the circular velocity curves (cvcs) of elliptical galaxiesare flat to within ~10% for r&gt;~0.2r_e. (ii) most ellipticals are moderatelyradially anisotropic; their dynamical structure is surprisingly uniform. (iii)elliptical galaxies follow a tully-fisher (tf) relation, with v_c^max=300 km/sfor an l_b^* galaxy. at given v_c^max, they are ~1 mag fainter in b and appearto have slightly lower baryonic mass than spirals even for maximum m/l_b. (iv)the luminosity dependence of m/l_b is confirmed. the tilt of the fundamentalplane is not caused by dynamical non-homology, nor only by an increasing darkmatter fraction with l. it is, however, consistent with stellar populationmodels based on published metallicities and ages. the main driver is thereforeprobably metallicity, and a secondary population effect is needed to explainthe k-band tilt. (v) these results make it likely that elliptical galaxies havenearly maximal m/l_b (minimal halos). (vi) despite the uniformly flat cvcs,there is a spread in cumulative m/l_b(r). some galaxies have no indication fordark matter within 2r_e, whereas others have local m/l_bs of 20-30 at 2r_e.(vii) in models with maximum stellar mass, the dark matter contributes ~10-40%of the mass within r_e. (viii) the corresponding halo core densities andphase-space densities are at least ~25 times larger and the halo core radii ~4times smaller than in spiral galaxies of the same v_c^max. the increase in m/lsets in at ~10 times larger acceleration than in spirals. this could imply thatelliptical galaxy halos collapsed at high redshift or that some of the darkmatter in ellipticals might be baryonic.

astro-ph;0012456	the peculiar motions of early-type galaxies in two distant regions vi:  the maximum likelihood gaussian algorithm	the efar project is designed to measure the properties and peculiar motionsof early-type galaxies in two distant regions. here we describe the maximumlikelihood algorithm we developed to investigate the correlations between theparameters of the efar database. one-, two-, and three-dimensional gaussianmodels are constructed to determine the mean value and intrinsic spread of theparameters, and the slopes and intrinsic parallel and orthogonal spread of themgb'-mg2, mg2-sigma, mgb'-sigma relations, and the fundamental plane. in thelatter case, the cluster peculiar velocities are also determined. we show thatthis method is superior to ``canonical'' approaches of least-squares type,which give biased slopes and biased peculiar velocities. we test the algorithmwith monte carlo simulations of mock efar catalogues and derive the systematicand random errors on the estimated parameters. we find that random errors arealways dominant. we estimate the influence of systematic errors due to the wayclusters were selected and the hard limits and uncertainties in the selectionfunction parameters for the galaxies. we explore the influence of uniformdistributions in the fundamental plane parameters and the errors. we concludethat the mean peculiar motions of the efar clusters can be determined reliably.in particular, the placement of the two efar sample regions relative to thelauer and postman dipole allows us to strongly constrain the amplitude of thebulk motion in this direction.

astro-ph;0111146	the evolution of the tully-fisher relation of spiral galaxies	we present the b-band tully-fisher relation (tfr) of 60 late-type galaxieswith redshifts 0.1-1. the galaxies were selected from the fors deep field witha limiting magnitude of r=23. spatially resolved rotation curves were derivedfrom spectra obtained with fors2 at the vlt. high-mass galaxies with v_max&gt;=150km/s show little evolution, whereas the least massive systems in our sample arebrighter by about 1-2 mag compared to their local counterparts. for the entiredistant sample, the tfr slope is flatter than for local field galaxies(-5.77+-0.45 versus -7.92+-0.18). thus, we find evidence for evolution of theslope of the tfr with redshift on the 3-sigma level. this is still true when wesubdivide the sample into three redshift bins. we speculate that the flattertilt of our sample is caused by the evolution of luminosities and an additionalpopulation of blue galaxies at z&gt;=0.2. the mass dependence of the tfr evolutionalso leads to variations for different galaxy types in magnitude-limitedsamples, suggesting that selection effects can account for the discrepantresults of previous tfr studies on the luminosity evolution of late-typegalaxies.

(in preparation). applying a voronoitessellation in the surface of section we are able to assign accuratephase-space volumes to individual orbits and to reconstruct the fullthree-integral phase-space distribution function (df) of any axisymmetric orbitlibrary. two types of tests have been performed to check the accuracy withwhich dfs can be represented by appropriate orbit libraries. first, by mappingdfs of spherical gamma-models and flattened plummer models on to the library weshow that the resulting line-of-sight velocity distributions and internalvelocity moments of the library match those directly derived from the df to aprecision better than that of present day observational errors. second, byfitting libraries to the projected kinematics of the same dfs we show that thedistribution function reconstructed from the fitted library matches the inputdf to a rms of about 15 per cent over a region in phase-space covering 90 percent of the mass of the library. the achieved accuracy allows us to implementeffective entropy-based regularisation to fit real, noisy and spatiallyincomplete data.

astro-ph;0409515	the star formation rate history in the fors deep and goods south fields	we measure the star formation rate (sfr) as a function of redshift z up to z\~4.5, based on b, i and (i+b) selected galaxy catalogues from the fors deepfield (fdf) and the k-selected catalogue from the goods-south field. distancesare computed from spectroscopically calibrated photometric redshifts accurateto (delta_z / (z_spec+1)) ~0.03 for the fdf and ~0.056 for the goods-southfield. the sfrs are derived from the luminosities at 1500 angstroem. we findthat the total sfr estimates derived from b, i and i+b catalogues agree verywell ($\lsim 0.1$ dex) while the sfr from the k catalogue is lower by ~0.2 dex.we show that the latter is solely due to the lower star-forming activity ofk-selected intermediate and low luminosity (l&lt;l_*) galaxies. the sfr of bright(l&gt;l_*) galaxies is independent of the selection band, i.e. the same for b, i,(i+b), and k-selected galaxy samples. at all redshifts, luminous galaxies(l&gt;l_*) contribute only ~1/3 to the total sfr. there is no evidence forsignificant cosmic variance between the sfrs in the fdf and goods-south field,  ~0.1 dex, consistent with theoretical expectations. the sfrs derived here arein excellent agreement with previous measurements provided we assume the samefaint-end slope of the luminosity function as previous works (alpha ~ -1.6).however, our deep fdf data indicate a shallower slope of alpha=-1.07, implyinga sfr lower by ~0.3 dex. we find the sfr to be roughly constant up to z ~4 andthen to decline slowly beyond, if dust extinctions are assumed to be constantwith redshift.

astro-ph;0410121	structural properties of discs and bulges of early-type galaxies	we have used the efar sample of galaxies to study the light distributions ofearly-type galaxies. we decompose the 2d light distribution of the galaxies ina flattened spheroidal component with a sersic radial light profile and aninclined disc component with an exponential light profile. we show that thebrightest, bulge dominated elliptical galaxies have a fairly broad distributionin the sersic profile shape parameter n_b, with a median of about 3.7 and asigma of ~0.9. other galaxies have smaller n_b values, meaning that spheroidsare in general less concentrated than the n_b=4 de vaucouleurs-law profile.  the results of our light decompositions are robust, even though withoutkinematic information we cannot prove that the spheroids and discs are reallypressure- and rotation-supported stellar systems. if we assume that thedetected spheroids and discs are indeed separate components, we can draw thefollowing conclusions: 1) the spheroid and disc scale sizes are correlated; 2)bulge-to-total luminosity ratios, bulge effective radii, and bulge n_b valuesare all positively correlated; 3) the bivariate space density distribution ofelliptical galaxies in the (luminosity, scale size)-plane is well described bya schechter luminosity function in and a log-normal scale-size distribution ata given luminosity; 4) at the brightest luminosities, the scale sizedistribution of elliptical galaxies is similar to those of bright spiralgalaxies; at fainter luminosities the elliptical scale size distribution peaksat distinctly smaller sizes than the spiral galaxy distribution; and 5) bulgecomponents of early-type galaxies are typically a factor 1.5 to 2.5 smallerthan the disks of spiral galaxies, while disc components of early-type galaxiesare typically twice as large as the discs of spiral galaxies.

astro-ph;0503607	oxygen and neon abundances of planetary nebulae in the elliptical galaxy  ngc 4697	this paper presents deep spectra of 14 planetary nebulae (pns) at a varietyof angular distances from the center of the flattened elliptical galaxy ngc4697. both near the center and among the most outlying pns we have foundseveral examples of very strong [o iii] 5007, about 20 times brighter thanhbeta. this, together with strong [ne iii] lines, implies a lower limit for oand ne abundances near solar at the center and also at more than two effectiveradii from the center of ngc 4697. thus we have found, for the first time fromindividual stars, direct evidence of the existence of a metal-rich populationin elliptical galaxies, confirming metallicities derived from absorption-lineindices and extending the information to angular distances where the stellarsurface brightness is too low for absorption-line studies. a comparison withabundances obtained closer to the center of ngc 4697 from integratedabsorption-line spectra indicates that the metallicity gradient, which is quitesteep within one effective radius, becomes much less pronounced beyond oneeffective radius. the only alternative to this interpretation would be thepresence of a very metal-poor pn population with [z/h] below -1, which wecannot rule out but would require an extremely bimodal metallicity distributionwith almost no intermediate metallicities.

astro-ph;0511033	dynamical mass estimates for two luminous star clusters in galactic  merger remnants	we present high-dispersion spectra of two extremely massive star clusters ingalactic merger remnants. one cluster, w30, is located in the ~500 myr oldmerger remnant ngc 7252 and has a velocity dispersion and effective radius ofsigma=27.5+-2.5 km/s and r_eff=9.3+-1.7 pc, respectively. the other cluster,g114, located in the ~3 gyr old merger remnant ngc 1316, is much more compact,r_eff=4.08+-0.55 pc, and has a velocity dispersion of sigma=42.1+-2.8 km/s.these measurements allow an estimate of the virial mass of the two clusters,yielding m_dyn(w30)=1.59(+-0.26) * 10^7 msun and m_dyn(g114)=1.64(+-0.13) *10^7msun. both clusters are extremely massive, being more than three times heavierthan the most massive globular clusters in the galaxy. for both clusters wemeasure light-to-mass ratios, which when compared to simple stellar population(ssp) models of the appropriate age, are consistent with a kroupa-type stellarmass function. using measurements from the literature we find a strong agedependence on how well ssp models (with underlying kroupa or salpeter-typestellar mass functions) fit the light-to-mass ratio of clusters. based on thisresult we suggest that the large scatter in the light-to-mass ratio of theyoungest clusters is not due to variations in the underlying stellar massfunction, but instead to the rapidly changing internal dynamics of youngclusters. finally, based on the positions of old globular clusters, youngmassive clusters (ymcs), ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (ucds) and dwarf-globulartransition objects (dgtos) in kappa-space we conclude that 1) ucds and dgtosare consistent with the high mass end of star clusters and 2) ymcs occupy amuch larger parameter space than old globular clusters, consistent with theidea of preferential disruption of star clusters.

astro-ph;0511409	a counter-rotating core in the dwarf elliptical galaxy vcc 510	we present optical long-slit spectra of the virgo dwarf elliptical galaxy vcc510 at high spectral and spatial resolution. heliocentric velocities andvelocity dispersions as functions of galaxy radius are derived by deconvolvingline-of-sight velocity distributions. a maximum rotation v_rot=8 km/s insidehalf the effective radius (re~20 arcsec) and a mean, radially flat velocitydispersion sigma=44 km/s are measured. the core extending over the inner 2arcsec (~140 pc) is found to rotate in the opposite sense with v_rot(core) ~-1/2 v_rot. vcc 510 (m_b ~ -15.7) is therefore by far the faintest and smallestgalaxy with a counter-rotating core known. from the main body rotation and thevelocity dispersion profile we deduce that vcc 510 is anisotropic and clearlynot entirely supported by rotation. by comparison of lick absorption-lineindices with stellar population models we derive an old luminosity-weighted age(10 gyr) and sub-solar metallicity ([z/h]=-0.4) inside the effective radius.there is tentative evidence that the counter-rotating core might be younger andless alpha/fe enhanced. from the stellar population parameters we obtain atotal stellar mass-to-light ratio of ~3.6 (m/l_b)_sun which is significantlylower than a rough dynamical estimate obtained from the kinematics through thevirial theorem (~15). this discrepancy hints toward the possible presence ofdark matter in the centre of vcc 510. we discuss the origin of thecounter-rotating core and exclude fly-by encounters as a viable possibility.gas accretion or galaxy merging provide more likely explanations. vcc 510 istherefore the direct observational evidence that such processes do occur incluster satellite galaxies on dwarf galaxy scales.

astro-ph;0601338	the evolution of the mass function split by morphology up to redshift 1  in the fors deep and the goods-s fields	we study the evolution of the stellar mass density for the separate familiesof bulge-dominated and disk-dominated galaxies over the redshift range 0.25 &lt; z&lt; 1.15. we derive quantitative morphology for a statistically significantgalaxy sample of 1645 objects selected from the fors deep and the goods-sfields. we find that the morphological mix evolves monotonically with time: thehigher the redshift, the more disk systems dominate the total mass content. atredshift about 1, massive objects (m_stellar &gt; 7e10 m_solar) host about half ofthe mass contained in objects of similar mass in the local universe. thecontribution from early and late type galaxies to the mass budget at z about 1is nearly equal. we show that in situ star formation is not sufficient toexplain the changing mass budget. moreover we find that the star formation rateper unit stellar mass of massive galaxies increases with redshift only for theintermediate and early morphological types, while it stays nearly constant forlate-type objects. this suggests that merging and/or frequent accretion ofsmall mass objects has a key role in the shaping of the hubble sequence as weobserve it now, and also in decreasing the star formation activity of thebulge-dominated descendants of massive disk galaxies.

astro-ph;0606527	lyman break galaxies under a microscope: the small scale dynamics and  mass of an arc in the cluster 1e0657-56	using the near-infrared integral-field spectrograph spiffi on the vlt, wehave studied the spatially-resolved dynamics in the z=3.2 strongly lensedgalaxy 1e0657-56 ``arc+core''. the lensing configuration suggests that the highsurface brightness ``core'' is the m=20 magnified central 1 kpc of the galaxy(seen at a spatial resolution of about 200 pc in the source plane), whereas thefainter ``arc'' is a more strongly magnified peripheral region of the samegalaxy at about a half-light radius, which otherwise appears to be a typicalz=3 lyman break galaxy.  the overall shape of the position-velocity diagram resembles the ``rotationcurves'' of the inner few kpcs of nearby l* spiral galaxies. the projectedvelocities rise rapidly to 75 km/s within the core. this implies a dynamicalmass of m_dyn = 10^9.3 m_sun within the central kpc, and suggests that in thissystem the equivalent of the mass of a present-day l* bulge at the same radiuswas already in place by z&gt;=3. approximating the circular velocity of the haloby the measured asymptotic velocity of the rotation curve, we estimate a darkmatter halo mass of m_halo = 10^11.7 +/- 0.3, in good agreement withlarge-scale clustering studies of lyman break galaxies. the baryonic collapsefraction is low compared to actively star-forming ``bx'' and low-redshiftgalaxies around z=2, perhaps implying comparatively less gas infall to smallradii or efficient feedback. even more speculatively, the high central massdensity might indicate highly dissipative gas collapse in very early stages ofgalaxy evolution, in approximate agreement with what is expected for``inside-out'' galaxy formation models.

astro-ph;9903222	probing early-type galaxy evolution with the kormendy relation	we investigate the evolution of early-type galaxies in four clusters at z=0.4(abell370, cl0303+17, cl0939+47 and cl1447+26) and in one at z=0.55(cl0016+16). the galaxies are selected according to theirspectrophotometrically determined spectral types and comprise the morphologicalclasses e, s0 and sa galaxies. structural parameters are determined by atwo-component fitting of the surface brightness profiles derived from hstimages. exploring a realistic range of k-corrections using bruzual and charlotmodels, we construct the rest-frame b-band kormendy relations (mu_e-log(r_e))for the different clusters. we do not detect a systematic change of the slopeof the relation as a function of redshift. we discuss in detail how theluminosity evolution, derived by comparing the kormendy relations of thedistant clusters with the local one for coma, depends on various assumptionsand give a full description of random and systematic errors by exploring theinfluences of selection bias, different star formation histories andk-corrections.  early-type galaxies with modest disk components (s0 and sa) do not differsignificantly in their evolution from disk-less ellipticals.  the observed luminosity evolution is compatible with pure passive evolutionmodels (with redshift of formation z&gt;2) but also with models that allow ongoingstar formation on a low level, like exponentially decaying star formationmodels with an e-folding time of tau=1 gyr.

0809.3906	dark matter scaling relations and the assembly epoch of coma early-type  galaxies	axisymmetric, orbit-based dynamical models are used to derive dark matterscaling relations for coma early-type galaxies. from faint to bright galaxieshalo core-radii and asymptotic circular velocities increase. compared tospirals of the same brightness, the majority of coma early-types -- those withold stellar populations -- have similar halo core-radii but more than 2 timeslarger asymptotic halo velocities. the average dark matter density inside 2reff decreases with increasing luminosity and is 6.8 times larger than in diskgalaxies of the same b-band luminosity. compared at the same stellar mass, darkmatter densities in ellipticals are 13.5 times higher than in spirals.different baryon concentrations in ellipticals and spirals cannot explain thehigher dark matter density in ellipticals. instead, the assembly redshift (1+z)of coma early-type halos is likely about two times larger than of comparablybright spirals. assuming that local spirals typically assemble at a redshift ofone, the majority of bright coma early-type galaxy halos must have formedaround z = 2-3. for about half of our coma galaxies the assembly redshiftsmatch with constraints derived from stellar populations. we find dark matterdensities and estimated assembly redshifts of our observed coma galaxies inreasonable agreement with recent semi-analytic galaxy formation models.

astro-ph;9909446	the orbital structure and potential of ngc 1399	accurate and radially extended stellar kinematic data reaching r=97'' fromthe center are presented for the cd galaxy of fornax, ngc 1399. the stellarrotation is small (&lt;= 30 km/s); the stellar velocity dispersion remainsconstant at 250-270 km/s. the deviations from gaussian line of sight velocitydistributions are small, at the percent level. we construct dynamical models ofthe galaxy, deprojecting its nearly round (e0-e1) surface brightnessdistribution, and determining the spherical distribution function that bestfits (at the 4 percent level) the kinematic data on a grid of parametrizedpotentials. we find that the stellar orbital structure is moderately radial,with beta=0.3 +- 0.1 for r&lt;=60'', similar to results found for some normalgiant ellipticals. the gravitational potential is dominated by the luminouscomponent out to the last data point, with a mass-to-light ratio m/l_b=10 solarunits, although the presence of a central black hole of m approx 5 x 10^8 solarmasses is compatible with the data in the inner 5 arcsec. the influence of thedark component is marginally detected starting from r approx 60''. using theradial velocities of the globular clusters and planetary nebulae of the galaxywe constrain the potential more strongly, ruling out the self-consistent caseand finding that the best fit solution agrees with x-ray determinations. theresulting total mass and mass-to-light ratio are m=1.2-2.5 x 10^12 solar massesand m/l_b=22-48 m solar units inside r=417'' or 35 kpc for d=17.6 mpc.

0811.2130	the flattening and the orbital structure of early-type galaxies and  collisionless n-body binary disk mergers	we use oblate axisymmetric dynamical models including dark halos to determinethe orbital structure of intermediate mass to massive coma early-type galaxies.we find a large variety of orbital compositions. averaged over all samplegalaxies the unordered stellar kinetic energy in the azimuthal and the radialdirection are of the same order, but they can differ by up to 40 percent inindividual systems. in contrast, both for rotating and non-rotating galaxiesthe vertical kinetic energy is on average smaller than in the other twodirections. this implies that even most of the rotating ellipticals areflattened by an anisotropy in the stellar velocity dispersions. usingthree-integral axisymmetric toy models we show that flattening by stellaranisotropy maximises the entropy for a given density distribution.collisionless disk merger remnants are radially anisotropic. the apparent lackof strong radial anisotropy in observed early-type galaxies implies that theymay not have formed from mergers of disks unless the influence of dissipationalprocesses was significant.

0812.0599	ogle2-tr-l9: an extrasolar planet transiting a fast-rotating f3 star	context: photometric observations for the ogle-ii microlens monitoringcampaign have been taken in the period 1997-2000. all light curves of thiscampaign have recently been made public. our analysis of these data hasrevealed 13 low-amplitude transiting objects among ~15700 stars in three carinafields towards the galactic disk. one of these objects, ogle2-tr-l9 (p~2.5days), turned out to be an excellent transiting planet candidate.  aims: in this paper we report on our investigation of the true nature ofogle2-tr-l9, by re-observing the photometric transit with the aim to determinethe transit parameters at high precision, and by spectroscopic observations, toestimate the properties of the host star, and to determine the mass of thetransiting object through radial velocity measurements.  methods: high precision photometric observations have been obtained in g',r', i', and z' band simultaneously, using the new grond detector, mounted onthe mpi/eso 2.2m telescope at la silla. eight epochs of high-dispersionspectroscopic observations were obtained using the fiber-fed flames/uvesechelle spectrograph, mounted on eso's very large telescope at paranal.  results: the photometric transit, now more than 7 years after the lastogle-ii observations, was re-discovered only ~8 minutes from its predictedtime. the primary object is a fast rotating f3 star, with vsini=39.33+-0.38km/s, t=6933+-58 k, log g = 4.25+-0.01, and [fe/h] = -0.05+-0.20. thetransiting object is an extrasolar planet with m_p=4.5+-1.5 m_jup andr_p=1.61+-0.04 r_jup. the rejection of possible blend scenarios was based on aquantitative analysis of the multi-color photometric data [abridged].

0812.1559	investigating the potential of the pan-planets project using monte carlo  simulations	using monte carlo simulations we analyze the potential of the upcomingtransit survey pan-planets. the analysis covers the simulation of realisticlight curves (including the effects of ingress/egress and limb-darkening) withboth correlated and uncorrelated noise as well as the application of abox-fitting-least-squares detection algorithm. in this work we show howsimulations can be a powerful tool in defining and optimizing the surveystrategy of a transiting planet survey. we find the pan-planets project to becompetitive with all other existing and planned transit surveys with the mainpower being the large 7 square degree field of view. in the first year weexpect to find up to 25 jupiter-sized planets with periods below 5 days aroundstars brighter than v = 16.5 mag. the survey will also be sensitive to planetswith longer periods and planets with smaller radii. after the second year ofthe survey, we expect to find up to 9 warm jupiters with periods between 5 and9 days and 7 very hot saturns around stars brighter than v = 16.5 mag as wellas 9 very hot neptunes with periods from 1 to 3 days around stars brighter thani' = 18.0 mag.
