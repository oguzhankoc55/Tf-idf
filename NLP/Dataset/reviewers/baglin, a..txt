0901.4618	photospheric activity and rotation of the planet-hosting star  corot-exo-4a	the space experiment corot has recently detected a transiting hot jupiter inorbit around a moderately active f-type main-sequence star (corot-exo-4a). thisplanetary system is of particular interest because it has an orbital period of9.202 days, the second longest one among the transiting planets known to date.we study the surface rotation and the activity of the host star during anuninterrupted sequence of optical observations of 58 days. our approach isbased on a maximum entropy spot modelling technique extensively tested bymodelling the variation of the total solar irradiance. it assumes that stellaractive regions consist of cool spots and bright faculae, analogous to sunspotsand solar photospheric faculae, whose visibility is modulated by stellarrotation. the modelling of the light curve of corot-exo-4a reveals three mainactive longitudes with lifetimes between about 30 and 60 days that rotatequasi-synchronously with the orbital motion of the planet. the differentrotation rates of the active longitudes are interpreted in terms of surfacedifferential rotation and a lower limit of 0.057 \pm 0.015 is derived for itsrelative amplitude. the enhancement of activity observed close to thesubplanetary longitude suggests a magnetic star-planet interaction, althoughthe short duration of the time series prevents us from drawing definiteconclusions.

0905.3340	looking for pulsations in hgmn stars through corot lightcurves	hgmn chemically peculiar stars are among the quietest stars of themain-sequence. however, according to theoretical predictions, these stars couldhave pulsations related to the very strong overabundances of iron peakelements, which are produced by atomic diffusion in upper layers. suchpulsations have never been detected from ground based observations.  our aim is to search for signatures of pulsations in hgmn stars using thehigh quality lightcurves provided by the corot satellite.  we identified three faint stars (v&gt;12), from vlt-giraffe multiobjectspectrograph survey in a field which was planned for observation by corot. theypresent the typical characteristics of hgmn stars. they were observed by thecorot satellite during the long run (131 days) which started from the 24th ofoctober 2007, with the exoplanets ccd's (additional programme). in the presentwork, we present the analysis of the ground based spectra of these three starsand the analysis of the corresponding corot lightcurves.  two of these three hgmn candidates show low amplitude (less than 1.6 mmag)periodic variations (4.3 and 2.53 days respectively, with harmonics) which arecompatible with periods predicted by theoretical models.

1010.4959	plaskett's star: analysis of the corot photometric data	the sra02 of the corot space mission for asteroseismology was partly devotedto stars belonging to the mon ob2 association. an intense monitoring wasperformed on plaskett's star (hd47129) and the unprecedented quality of thelight curve allows us to shed new light on this very massive, non-eclipsingbinary system. we particularly aimed at detecting periodic variability whichmight be associated with pulsations or interactions between both components. wealso searched for variations related to the orbital cycle which could help toconstrain the inclination and the morphology of the binary system. afourier-based prewhitening and a multiperiodic fitting procedure were appliedto analyse the time series and extract the frequencies of variations. wedescribe the noise properties to tentatively define an appropriate significancecriterion, to only point out the peaks at a certain significance level. we alsodetect the variations related to the orbital motion and study them by using thenightfall program. the periodogram exhibits a majority of peaks at lowfrequencies. among these peaks, we highlight a list of about 43 values,including notably two different sets of harmonic frequencies whose fundamentalpeaks are located at about 0.07 and 0.82d-1. the former represents the orbitalfrequency of the binary system whilst the latter could probably be associatedwith non-radial pulsations. the study of the 0.07d-1 variations reveals thepresence of a hot spot most probably situated on the primary star and facingthe secondary. the investigation of this unique dataset constitutes a furtherstep in the understanding of plaskett's star. these results provide a firstbasis for future seismic modelling. the existence of a hot region between bothcomponents renders the determination of the inclination ambiguous.

1011.2690	possible detection of phase changes from the non-transiting planet hd  46375b by corot	the present work deals with the detection of phase changes in an exoplanetarysystem. hd 46375 is a solar analog known to host a non-transiting saturn-massexoplanet with a 3.0236 day period. it was observed by the corot satellite for34 days during the fall of 2008. we attempt to identify at optical wavelengths,the changing phases of the planet as it orbits its star. we then try to improvethe star model by means of a seismic analysis of the same light curve and theuse of ground-based spectropolarimetric observations. the data analysis relieson the fourier spectrum and the folding of the time series. we find evidence ofa sinusoidal signal compatible in terms of both amplitude and phase with lightreflected by the planet. its relative amplitude is delta fp/f* = [13.0, 26.8]ppm, implying an albedo a=[0.16, 0.33] or a dayside visible brightnesstemperature tb ~ [1880,2030] k by assuming a radius r=1.1 r_jup and aninclination i=45 deg. its orbital phase differs from that of theradial-velocity signal by at most 2 sigma_rv. however, the tiny planetarysignal is strongly blended by another signal, which we attribute to a telluricsignal with a 1 day period. we show that this signal is suppressed, but noteliminated, when using the time series for hd 46179 from the same corot run asa reference. this detection of reflected light from a non-transiting planetshould be confirmable with a longer corot observation of the same field. in anycase, it demonstrates that non-transiting planets can be characterized usingultra-precise photometric lightcurves with present-day observations by corotand kepler. the combined detection of solar-type oscillations on the sametargets (gaulme et al. 2010a) highlights the overlap between exoplanetaryscience and asteroseismology and shows the high potential of a mission such asplato.

1101.3428	corot high-precision photometry of the b0.5 iv star hd 51756	ob stars are important constituents for the ecology of the universe, andthere are only a few studies on their pulsational properties detailed enough toprovide important feedback on current evolutionary models. our goal is toanalyse and interpret the behaviour present in the corot light curve of theb0.5 iv star hd 51756 observed during the second long run of the space mission,and to determine the fundamental stellar parameters from ground-basedspectroscopy gathered with the coralie and harps instruments after checking forsigns of variability and binarity, thus making a step further in mapping thetop of the beta cep instability strip. we compare the newly obtainedhigh-resolution spectra with synthetic spectra of late o-type and early b-typestars computed on a grid of stellar parameters. we match the results withevolutionary tracks to estimate stellar parameters. we use various time seriesanalysis tools to explore the nature of the variations present in the lightcurve. additional calculations are carried out based on distance and historicalposition measurements of the components to impose constraints on the binaryorbit. we find that hd 51756 is a wide binary with both a slow (v sin i \approx28 km s^-1) and a fast (v sin i \approx 170 km s^-1) early-b rotator whoseatmospheric parameters are similar (t_eff \approx 30000 k and log g \approx3.75). we are unable to detect pulsation in any of the components, and weinterpret the harmonic structure in the frequency spectrum as sign ofrotational modulation, which is compatible with the observed and deducedstellar parameters of both components. the non-detection of pulsation modesprovides a feedback on the theoretical treatment, given that non-adiabaticcomputations applied to appropriate stellar models predict the excitation ofboth pressure and gravity modes for the fundamental parameters of this star.

1105.6113	mixed modes in red-giant stars observed with corot	the corot mission has provided thousands of red-giant light curves. theanalysis of their solar-like oscillations allows us to characterize theirstellar properties. up to now, the global seismic parameters of the pressuremodes remain unable to distinguish red-clump giants from members of thered-giant branch. as recently done with kepler red giants, we intend to analyzeand use the so-called mixed modes to determine the evolutionary status of thered giants observed with corot. we also aim at deriving different seismiccharacteristics depending on evolution. the complete identification of thepressure eigenmodes provided by the red-giant universal oscillation patternallows us to aim at the mixed modes surrounding the l=1 expectedeigenfrequencies. a dedicated method based on the envelope autocorrelationfunction is proposed to analyze their period separation. we have identified themixed-mode signature separation thanks to their pattern compatible with theasymptotic law of gravity modes. we have shown that, independent of anymodelling, the g-mode spacings help to distinguish the evolutionary status of ared-giant star. we then report different seismic and fundamental properties ofthe stars, depending on their evolutionary status. in particular, we show thathigh-mass stars of the secondary clump present very specific seismicproperties. we emphasize that stars belonging to the clump were affected bysignificant mass loss. we also note significant population and/or evolutiondifferences in the different fields observed by corot.

1204.5587	the corot b-type binary hd50230: a prototypical hybrid pulsator with  g-mode period and p-mode frequency spacings	b-type stars are promising targets for asteroseismic modelling, since theirfrequency spectrum is relatively simple.  we deduce and summarise observational constraints for the hybrid pulsator,hd50230, earlier reported to have deviations from a uniform period spacing ofits gravity modes. the combination of spectra and a high-quality light curvemeasured by the corot satellite allow a combined approach to fix the positionof hd50230 in the hr diagram.  to describe the observed pulsations, classical fourier analysis was combinedwith short-time fourier transformations and frequency spacing analysistechniques. visual spectra were used to constrain the projected rotation rateof the star and the fundamental parameters of the target. in a firstapproximation, the combined information was used to interpret multiplets andspacings to infer the true surface rotation rate and a rough estimate of theinclination angle.  we identify hd50230 as a spectroscopic binary and characterise the twocomponents. we detect the simultaneous presence of high-order g modes andlow-order p and g-modes in the corot light curve, but were unable to link themto line profile variations in the spectroscopic time series. we extract therelevant information from the frequency spectrum, which can be used for seismicmodelling, and explore possible interpretations of the pressure mode spectrum.

1209.5696	study of hd 169392a observed by corot and harps	the numerous results obtained with asteroseismology thanks to space missionssuch as corot and kepler are providing a new insight on stellar evolution.after five years of observations, corot is going on providing high-qualitydata. we present here the analysis of the double star hd169392 complemented byground-based spectroscopic observations. this work aims at characterizing thefundamental parameters of the two stars, their chemical composition, theacoustic-mode global parameters including their individual frequencies, andtheir dynamics. we have analysed harps observations of the two stars toretrieve their chemical compositions. several methods have been used andcompared to measure the global properties of acoustic modes and theirindividual frequencies from the photometric data of corot. the newspectroscopic observations and archival astrometric values suggest thathd169392 is a wide binary system weakly bounded. we have obtained thespectroscopic parameters for both components, suggesting the origin from thesame cloud. however, only the mode signature of hd169392 a has been measuredwithin the corot data. the signal-to-noise ratio of the modes in hd169392b istoo low to allow any confident detection. we were able to extract modeparameters of modes for l=0, 1, 2, and 3. the study of the splittings andinclination angle gives two possible solutions with splittings and inclinationangles of 0.4-1.0 muhz and 20-40 degrees for one case and 0.2-0.5 muhz and55-86 degrees for the other case. the modeling of this star with theasteroseismic modeling portal led to a mass of 1.15+/-0.01 ms, a radius of1.88+/-0.02 rs, and an age of 4.33+/-0.12 gyr, where the uncertainties are theinternal ones.

1211.0146	galactic archaeology: mapping and dating stellar populations with  asteroseismology of red-giant stars	our understanding of how the galaxy was formed and evolves is severelyhampered by the lack of precise constraints on basic stellar properties such asdistances, masses, and ages. here, we show that solar-like pulsating red giantsrepresent a well-populated class of accurate distance indicators, spanning alarge age range, which can be used to map and date the galactic disc in theregions probed by observations made by the corot and kepler space telescopes.when combined with photometric constraints, the pulsation spectra of suchevolved stars not only reveal their radii, and hence distances, but alsoprovide well-constrained estimates of their masses, which are reliable proxiesfor the ages of the stars. as a first application we consider red giantsobserved by corot in two different parts of the milky way, and determineprecise distances for ~2000 stars spread across nearly 15,000 pc of thegalactic disc, exploring regions which are a long way from the solarneighbourhood. we find significant differences in the mass distributions ofthese two samples which, by comparison with predictions of synthetic models ofthe milky way, we interpret as mainly due to the vertical gradient in thedistribution of stellar masses (hence ages) in the disc. in the future, theavailability of spectroscopic constraints for this sample of stars will notonly improve the age determination, but also provide crucial constraints onage-velocity and age-metallicity relations at different galactocentric radiiand heights from the plane.

1212.1687	asymptotic and measured large frequency separations	with the space-borne missions corot and kepler, a large amount ofasteroseismic data is now available. so-called global oscillation parametersare inferred to characterize the large sets of stars, to perform ensembleasteroseismology, and to derive scaling relations. the mean large separation issuch a key parameter. it is therefore crucial to measure it with the highestaccuracy. as the conditions of measurement of the large separation do notcoincide with its theoretical definition, we revisit the asymptotic expressionsused for analysing the observed oscillation spectra. then, we examine theconsequence of the difference between the observed and asymptotic values of themean large separation. the analysis is focused on radial modes. we use seriesof radial-mode frequencies to compare the asymptotic and observational valuesof the large separation. we propose a simple formulation to correct theobserved value of the large separation and then derive its asymptoticcounterpart. we prove that, apart from glitches due to stellar structurediscontinuities, the asymptotic expansion is valid from main-sequence stars tored giants. our model shows that the asymptotic offset is close to 1/4, as inthe theoretical development. high-quality solar-like oscillation spectraderived from precise photometric measurements are definitely better describedwith the second-order asymptotic expansion. the second-order term isresponsible for the curvature observed in the \'echelle diagrams used foranalysing the oscillation spectra and this curvature is responsible for thedifference between the observed and asymptotic values of the large separation.taking it into account yields a revision of the scaling relations providingmore accurate asteroseismic estimates of the stellar mass and radius.

1301.0991	gamma doradus pulsation in two pre-main sequence stars discovered by  corot	pulsations in pre-main sequence stars have been discovered several timeswithin the last years. but nearly all of these pulsators are of deltascuti-type. gamma doradus-type pulsation in young stars has been predicted bytheory, but lack observational evidence. we present the investigation ofvariability caused by rotation and (gammadoradus-type) pulsation in twopre-main sequence members of the young open cluster ngc2264 usinghigh-precision time series photometry from the corot satellite and dedicatedhigh-resolution spectroscopy. time series photometry of ngc2264vas20 and ngc2264vas87 was obtained by the corot satellite during the dedicated short runsra01 in march 2008. ngc2264vas87 was re-observed by corot during the short runsra05 in december 2011 and january 2012. frequency analysis was conducted usingperiod04 and sigspec. the spectral analysis was performed using equivalentwidths and spectral synthesis. the frequency analysis yielded 10 and 14intrinsic frequencies for ngc2264vas20 and ngc2264vas 87, respectively, in therange from 0 to 1.5c/d which are attributed to be caused by a combination ofrotation and pulsation. the effective temperatures were derived to be6380$\pm$150k for ngc2264vas20 and 6220$\pm$150k for ngc2264vas87. membershipof the two stars to the cluster is confirmed independently using x-ray fluxes,radial velocity measurements and proper motions available in the literature.the derived li abundances of log n(li)=3.34 and 3.54 for ngc2264vas20 andngc2264vas87, respectively, are in agreement with the li abundance for otherstars in ngc2264 of similar teff reported in the literature. we conclude thatthe two objects are members of ngc2264 and therefore are in their pre-mainsequence evolutionary stage. assuming that part of their variability is causedby pulsation, these two stars might be the first pre-main sequence gammadoradus candidates.

1305.0811	overview of semi-sinusoidal stellar variability with the corot satellite	to date, the corot space mission has produced more than 124,471 light curves.classifying these curves in terms of unambiguous variability behavior ismandatory for obtaining an unbiased statistical view on their controllingroot-causes. the present study provides an overview of semi-sinusoidal lightcurves observed by the corot exo-field ccds. we selected a sample of 4,206light curves presenting well-defined semi-sinusoidal signatures. thevariability periods were computed based on lomb-scargle periodograms, harmonicfits, and visual inspection. color-period diagrams for the present sample showthe trend of an increase of the variability periods as long as the starsevolve. this evolutionary behavior is also noticed when comparing the perioddistribution in the galactic center and anti-center directions. these aspectsindicate a compatibility with stellar rotation, although more information isneeded to confirm their root-causes. considering this possibility, weidentified a subset of three sun-like candidates by their photometric period.finally, the variability period versus color diagram behavior was found to behighly dependent on the reddening correction.

1308.3598	periodicity search as a tool for disentangling the contaminated colour  light curve of corot 102781750	the star corot102781750 reveals a puzzle, showing a very complex and alteringvariation in different `corot colours'. we established without doubt that morethan a single star was situated within the corot mask. using a search forperiodicity as a tool, our aim is to disentangle the composite light curve andidentify the type of sources behind the variability. both flux and magnitudelight curves were used. conversion was applied after a jump- andtrend-filtering algorithm. we applied different types of period-findingtechniques including mufran and period04. the amplitude and phase peculiaritiesobtained from the independent analysis of corot r, g, and b colours andground-based follow-up photometric observations ruled out the possibility ofeither a background monoperiodic or a blazhko type rr lyrae star being in themask. the main target, an active star, shows at least two spotted areas thatreveal a $p_rot = 8.8$ hours $(f_0 = 2.735$ c d$^{-1})$ mean rotation period.the evolution of the active regions helped to derive a period change of $dp/dt= 1.6\cdot 10^{-6}$ (18 s over the run) and a differential rotation of $\alpha= \delta\omega/\omega = 0.0074$. the $0\fm 015$ linear decrease and a local$0\fm 005$ increase in the dominant period's amplitude are interpreted as adecay of the old spotted region and an appearance of a new one, respectively. astar that is detected only in the corot b domain shows a $f_1 = 7.172$ cd$^{-1}$ pulsation connected to a $14\fd 83$ periodicity via an equidistanttriplet structure. the best explanation for our observation is a $\beta$ cepstar with a corotating dust disk.

1408.2576	corot-22 b: a validated 4.9 re exoplanet in 10-day orbit	the corot satellite has provided high-precision photometric light curves formore than 163,000 stars and found several hundreds of transiting systemscompatible with a planetary scenario. if ground-based velocimetric observationsare the best way to identify the actual planets among many possibleconfigurations of eclipsing binary systems, recent transit surveys have shownthat it is not always within reach of the radial-velocity detection limits. inthis paper, we present a transiting exoplanet candidate discovered by corotwhose nature cannot be established from ground-based observations, and whereextensive analyses are used to validate the planet scenario. they are based onobserving constraints from radial-velocity spectroscopy, adaptive opticsimaging and the corot transit shape, as well as from priors on stellarpopulations, planet and multiple stellar systems frequency. we use the fullybayesian approach developed in the pastis analysis software, and conclude thatthe planet scenario is at least 1400 times more probable than any other falsepositive scenario. the primary star is a metallic solar-like dwarf, with ms =1.099+-0.049 msun and rs = 1.136 (+0.038,-0.090) rsun . the validated planethas a radius of rp = 4.88 (+0.17,-0.39) re and mass less than 49 me. its meandensity is smaller than 2.56 g/cm^3 and orbital period is 9.7566+-0.0012 days.this object, called corot-22 b, adds to a large number of validated keplerplanets. these planets do not have a proper measurement of the mass but allowstatistical characterization of the exoplanet population.

0803.3202	transiting exoplanets from the corot space mission i - corot-exo-1b: a  low-density short-period planet around a g0v star	context. the pioneer space mission for photometric planet searches, corot,steadily monitors about 12,000 stars in each of its fields of view; it is ableto detect transit candidates early in the processing of the data and before theend of a run. aims. we report the detection of the first planet discovered bycorot and characterizing it with the help of follow-up observations. methods.raw data were filtered from outliers and residuals at the orbital period of thesatellite. the orbital parameters and the radius of the planet were estimatedby best fitting the phase folded light curve with 34 successive transits.doppler measurements with the sophie spectrograph permitted us to secure thedetection and to estimate the planet mass. results. the accuracy of the data isvery high with a dispersion in the 2.17 min binned phase-folded light curvethat does not exceed 3.10-4 in flux unit. the planet orbits a mildly metal-poorg0v star of magnitude v=13.6 in 1.5 days. the estimated mass and radius of thestar are 0.95+-0.15msun and 1.11+-0.05rsun. we find the planet has a radius of1.49+-0.08rjup, a mass of 1.03+-0.12mjup, and a particularly low mean densityof 0.38 +-0.05g cm-3.

0803.3207	transiting exoplanets from the corot space mission ii. corot-exo-2b: a  transiting planet around an active g star	context. the corot mission, a pioneer in exoplanet searches from space, hascompleted its first 150 days of continuous observations of ~12000 stars in thegalactic plane. an analysis of the raw data identifies the most promisingcandidates and triggers the ground-based follow-up. aims. we report on thediscovery of the transiting planet corot-exo-2b, with a period of 1.743 days,and characterize its main parameters. methods. we filter the corot raw lightcurve of cosmic impacts, orbital residuals, and low frequency signals from thestar. the folded light curve of 78 transits is fitted to a model to obtain themain parameters. radial velocity data obtained with the sophie, coralie andharps spectro-graphs are combined to characterize the system. the 2.5 minbinned phase-folded light curve is affected by the effect of sucessiveoccultations of stellar active regions by the planet, and the dispersion in theout of transit part reaches a level of 1.09x10-4 in flux units. results. wederive a radius for the planet of 1.465+-0.029 r_jup and a mass of 3.31+-0.16m_jup, corresponding to a density of 1.31+-0.04 g/cm^3. the large radius ofcorot-exo-2b cannot be explained by current models of evolution of irradiatedplanets.

1504.01532	transiting exoplanets from the corot space mission xxvii. corot-28b, a  planet orbiting an evolved star, and corot-29b, a planet showing an  asymmetric transit	context. we present the discovery of two transiting extrasolar planets by thesatellite corot. aims. we aim at a characterization of the planetary bulkparameters, which allow us to further investigate the formation and evolutionof the planetary systems and the main properties of the host stars. methods. weused the transit light curve to characterize the planetary parameters relativeto the stellar parameters. the analysis of harps spectra established theplanetary nature of the detections, providing their masses. further photometricand spectroscopic ground-based observations provided stellar parameters (logg,teff,v sin i) to characterize the host stars. our model takes the geometry ofthe transit to constrain the stellar density into account, which when linked tostellar evolutionary models, determines the bulk parameters of the star.because of the asymmetric shape of the light curve of one of the planets, wehad to include the possibility in our model that the stellar surface was notstrictly spherical. results. we present the planetary parameters of corot-28b,a jupiter-sized planet (mass 0.484+/-0.087mjup; radius 0.955+/-0.066rjup)orbiting an evolved star with an orbital period of 5.208 51 +/- 0.000 38 days,and corot-29b, another jupiter-sized planet (mass 0.85 +/- 0.20mjup; radius0.90 +/- 0.16rjup) orbiting an oblate star with an orbital period of 2.850 570+/- 0.000 006 days. the reason behind the asymmetry of the transit shape is notunderstood at this point. conclusions. these two new planetary systems havevery interesting properties and deserve further study, particularly in the caseof the star corot-29.

1505.01529	models of red giants in the corot asteroseismology fields combining  asteroseismic and spectroscopic constraints	context. the availability of asteroseismic constraints for a large sample ofred giant stars from the corot and kepler missions paves the way for variousstatistical studies of the seismic properties of stellar populations.  aims. we use the first detailed spectroscopic study of 19 corot red-giantstars (morel et al 2014) to compare theoretical stellar evolution models toobservations of the open cluster ngc 6633 and field stars.  methods. in order to explore the effects of rotation-induced mixing andthermohaline instability, we compare surface abundances of carbon isotopicratio and lithium with stellar evolution predictions. these chemicals aresensitive to extra-mixing on the red-giant branch.  results. we estimate mass, radius, and distance for each star using theseismic constraints. we note that the hipparcos and seismic distances aredifferent. however, the uncertainties are such that this may not besignificant. although the seismic distances for the cluster members are selfconsistent they are somewhat larger than the hipparcos distance. this is anissue that should be considered elsewhere. models including thermohalineinstability and rotation-induced mixing, together with the seismicallydetermined masses can explain the chemical properties of red-giants targets.however, with this sample of stars we cannot perform stringent tests of thecurrent stellar models. tighter constraints on the physics of the models wouldrequire the measurement of the core and surface rotation rates, and of theperiod spacing of gravity-dominated mixed modes. a larger number of stars withlonger times series, as provided by kepler or expected with plato, would helpfor ensemble asteroseismology.

1508.05358	the variability behavior of corot m-giant stars	for 6 years the convection, rotation, and planetary transits (corot) spacemission has acquired photometric data from more than one hundred thousand pointsources towards and directly opposite from the inner and outer regions of thegalaxy. the high temporal resolution of the corot data combined with the widetime span of the observations has enabled the study of short and long timevariations in unprecedented detail. from the initial sample of 2534 starsclassified as m-giants in the corot databasis, we selected 1428 targets thatexhibit well defined variability, using visual inspection. the variabilityperiod and amplitude of c1 stars (stars having teff &lt; 4200 k) were computedusing lomb-scargle and harmonic fit methods. the trends found in the v-i vs j-kcolor-color diagram are in agreement with standard empirical calibrations form-giants. the sources located towards the inner regions of the galaxy aredistributed throughout the diagram while the majority of the stars towards theouter regions of the galaxy are spread between the calibrations of m-giants andthe predicted position for carbon stars. the stars classified as supergiantsfollow a different sequence from the one found for giant stars. we alsoperformed a ks test of the period and amplitude of stars towards the inner andouter regions of the galaxy. we obtained a low probability that the two samplescome from the same parent distribution. the observed behavior of theperiod-amplitude and period-teff diagrams are, in general, in agreement withthose found for kepler sources and ground based photometry, with pulsationbeing the dominant cause responsible for the observed modulation. we alsoconclude that short-time variations on m-giant stars do not exist orare veryrare and the few cases we found are possibly related to biases or backgroundstars.

1509.01523	rotation period distribution of corot and kepler sun-like stars	we study the distribution of the photometric rotation period (prot), which isa direct measurement of the surface rotation at active latitudes, for threesubsamples of sun-like stars: one from corot data and two from kepler data. weidentify the main populations of these samples and interpret their main biasesspecifically for a comparison with the solar prot. prot and variabilityamplitude (a) measurements were obtained from public corot and kepler catalogscombined with physical parameters. because these samples are subject toselection effects, we computed synthetic samples with simulated biases tocompare with observations, particularly around the location of the sun in thehr diagram. theoretical grids and empirical relations were used to combinephysical parameters with prot and a. biases were simulated by performingcutoffs on the physical and rotational parameters in the same way as in eachobserved sample. a crucial cutoff is related with the detectability of therotational modulation, which strongly depends on a. the synthetic samplesexplain the observed prot distributions of sun-like stars as having two mainpopulations: one of young objects (group i, with ages younger than ~1 gyr) andanother of ms and evolved stars (group ii, with ages older than ~1 gyr). theproportions of groups i and ii in relation to the total number of stars rangewithin 64-84% and 16-36%, respectively. hence, young objects abound in thedistributions, producing the effect of observing a high number of short periodsaround the location of the sun in the hr diagram. differences in the protdistributions between the corot and kepler sun-like samples may be associatedwith different galactic populations. overall, the synthetic distribution aroundthe solar period agrees with observations, which suggests that the solarrotation is normal with respect to sun-like stars within the accuracy ofcurrent data.

0811.0461	magnetic activity in the photosphere of corot-exo-2a. active longitudes  and short-term spot cycle in a young sun-like star	the space experiment corot has recently detected transits by a hot jupiteracross the disc of an active g7v star (corot-exo-2a) that can be considered asa good proxy for the sun at an age of approximately 0.5 gyr. we present a spotmodelling of the optical variability of the star during 142 days ofuninterrupted observations performed by corot with unprecedented photometricprecision. we apply spot modelling approaches previously tested in the case ofthe sun by modelling total solar irradiance variations. to model the lightcurve of corot-exo-2a, we take into account both the photometric effects ofcool spots as well as those of solar-like faculae, adopting solar analogy. twoactive longitudes initially on opposite hemispheres are found on thephotosphere of corot-exo-2a with a rotation period of 4.522 $\pm$ 0.024 days.their separation changes by approximately 80 degrees during the time span ofthe observations. from this variation, a relative amplitude of the surfacedifferential rotation lower than about 1 percent is estimated. individual spotsform within the active longitudes and show an angular velocity about 1 percentsmaller than that of the longitude pattern. the total spotted area shows acyclic oscillation with a period of 28.9 $\pm$ 4.3 days, which is close to 10times the synodic period of the planet as seen by the rotating activelongitudes. the implications of such results for the internal rotation ofcorot-exo-2a are discussed on the basis of solar analogy. a possible magneticstar-planet interaction is suggested by the cyclic variation of the spottedarea. alternatively, the 28.9-d cycle may be related to rossby-type wavespropagating in the subphotospheric layers of the star.
