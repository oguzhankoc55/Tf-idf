0902.4003	a cross-correlation analysis of mg ii absorption line systems and  luminous red galaxies from the sdss dr5	we analyze the cross-correlation of 2,705 unambiguously intervening mg ii(2796,2803a) quasar absorption line systems with 1,495,604 luminous redgalaxies (lrgs) from the fifth data release of the sloan digital sky surveywithin the redshift range 0.36&lt;=z&lt;=0.8. we confirm with high precision apreviously reported weak anti-correlation of equivalent width and dark matterhalo mass, measuring the average masses to be log m_h(m_[solar]h^-1)=11.29[+0.36,-0.62] and log m_h(m_[solar]h^-1)=12.70 [+0.53,-1.16] for systems withw[2796a]&gt;=1.4a and 0.8a&lt;=w[2796a]&lt;1.4a, respectively. additionally, weinvestigate the significance of a number of potential sources of bias inherentin absorber-lrg cross-correlation measurements, including absorber velocitydistributions and the weak lensing of background quasars, which we determine iscapable of producing a 20-30% bias in angular cross-correlation measurements onscales less than 2'. we measure the mg ii - lrg cross-correlation for 719absorption systems with v&lt;60,000 km s^-1 in the quasar rest frame and find thatthese associated absorbers typically reside in dark matter haloes that are~10-100 times more massive than those hosting unambiguously intervening mg iiabsorbers. furthermore, we find evidence for evolution of the redshift numberdensity, dn/dz, with 2-sigma significance for the strongest (w&gt;2.0a) absorbersin the dr5 sample. this width-dependent dn/dz evolution does not significantlyaffect the recovered equivalent width-halo mass anti-correlation and adds toexisting evidence that the strongest mg ii absorption systems are correlatedwith an evolving population of field galaxies at z&lt;0.8, while the non-evolvingdn/dz of the weakest absorbers more closely resembles that of the lrgpopulation.

0907.2727	the 2df-sdss lrg and qso survey: the qso luminosity function at  0.4&lt;z&lt;2.6	we present the qso luminosity function of the completed 2df-sdss lrg and qso(2slaq) survey, based on qsos photometrically selected from sloan digital skysurvey imaging data and then observed spectroscopically using the 2dfinstrument on the anglo-australian telescope. we analyse 10637 qsos in theredshift range 0.4&lt;z&lt;2.6 to a g-band flux limit of 21.85 (extinction corrected)and an absolute continuum magnitude of mg(z=2)&lt;-21.5. this sample covers anarea of 191.9 deg^2.  the binned qso luminosity function agrees with that of the brighter sdss mainqso sample, but extends ~2.5 mags fainter, clearly showing the flattening ofthe luminosity function towards faint absolute magnitudes. 2slaq finds anexcess of qsos compared to the 2df qso redshift survey at g&gt;20.0, as foundpreviously by richards et al. (2005). the luminosity function is consistentwith other previous, much smaller, samples produced to the depth of 2slaq.  by combining the 2slaq and sdss qso samples we produce a qso luminosityfunction with an unprecedented combination of precision and dynamic range. withthis we are able to accurately constrain both the bright and faint ends of theqso lf. while the overall trends seen in the evolution of the qso lf appearsimilar to pure luminosity evolution, the data show very significant departuresfrom such a model. most notably we see clear evidence that the number densityof faint qsos peaks at lower redshift than bright qsos: qsos with mg&gt;-23 havespace densities which peak at z&lt;1, while qsos at mg&lt;-26 peak at z&gt;2. by fittingsimple luminosity function models in narrow mg intervals we find that thisdownsizing is significant at the 99.98 per cent level (abridged).

0908.3907	binary quasars at high redshift i: 24 new quasar pairs at z ~ 3-4	the clustering of quasars on small scales yields fundamental constraints onmodels of quasar evolution and the buildup of supermassive black holes. thispaper describes the first systematic survey to discover high redshift binaryquasars. using color-selection and photometric redshift techniques, we searched8142 deg^2 of sdss imaging data for binary quasar candidates, and confirmedthem with follow-up spectroscopy. our sample of 27 high redshift binaries (24of them new discoveries) at redshifts 2.9 &lt; z &lt; 4.3 with proper transverseseparations 10 kpc &lt; r_{\perp} &lt; 650 kpc increases the number of such objectsknown by an order of magnitude. eight members of this sample are very closepairs with r_{\perp} &lt; 100 kpc, and of these close systems four are at z &gt; 3.5.the completeness and efficiency of our well-defined selection algorithm arequantified using simulated photometry and we find that our sample is ~ 50%complete. our companion paper uses this knowledge to make the first measurementof the small scale clustering (r &lt; 1 mpc/h comoving) of high-redshift quasars.high redshift binaries constitute exponentially rare coincidences of twoextreme (m &gt;~ 10^9 msun) supermassive black holes. at z ~ 4 there is about oneclose binary per 10 gpc^3, thus these could be the highest sigma peaks, theanalogs of superclusters, in the early universe.

1009.0767	mergers in double-peaked [o iii] active galactic nuclei	as a natural consequence of galaxy mergers, binary active galactic nuclei(agns) should be commonplace. nevertheless, observational confirmations arerare, especially for binaries with separations less than ten kpc. such a systemmay show two sets of narrow emission lines in a single spectrum owing to theorbital motion of the binary. we have obtained high-resolution near-infraredimages of 50 double-peaked [o iii] 5007 agns with the keck ii laser guide staradaptive optics system. the sloan digital sky survey sample is compiled fromthe literature and consists of 17 type-1 agns between 0.18 &lt; z &lt; 0.56 and 33type-2 agns between 0.03 &lt; z &lt; 0.24. the new images reveal eight type-1 andeight type-2 sources that are apparently undergoing mergers. these are strongcandidates of kpc-scale binary agns, because they show multiple componentsseparated between 0.6 and 12 kpc and often disturbed morphologies. because mostof the type-1s are at higher redshifts than the type-2s, the higher mergerfraction of type-1s (47+/-20%) compared to that of type-2s (24+/-10%) can beattributed to the general evolution of galaxy merger fraction with redshift.furthermore, we show that agn mergers are outliers of the m_bh-sigma relationbecause of over-estimated stellar velocity dispersions, illustrating theimportance of removing mergers from the samples defining the m_bh-sigmarelations. finally, we find that the emission-line properties areindistinguishable for spatially resolved and unresolved sources, emphasizingthat scenarios involving a single agn can produce the same double-peaked lineprofiles and they account for at least 70% of the double-peaked [o iii] agns.

1102.4850	clustering of obscured and unobscured quasars in the bootes field:  placing rapidly growing black holes in the cosmic web	we present the first measurement of the spatial clustering of mid-infraredselected obscured and unobscured quasars, using a sample in the redshift range0.7 &lt; z &lt; 1.8 selected from the 9 deg^2 bootes multiwavelength survey. recentlythe spitzer space telescope and x-ray observations have revealed largepopulations of obscured quasars that have been inferred from models of thex-ray background and supermassive black hole evolution. to date, little isknown about obscured quasar clustering, which allows us to measure the massesof their host dark matter halos and explore their role in the cosmic evolutionof black holes and galaxies. in this study we use a sample of 806 mid-infraredselected quasars and ~250,000 galaxies to calculate the projected quasar-galaxycross-correlation function w_p(r). the observed clustering yieldscharacteristic dark matter halo masses of log (m_halo [h^-1 m_sun]) =12.7^+0.4_-0.6 and 13.3^+0.3_-0.4 for unobscured quasars (qso-1s) and obscuredquasars (obs-qsos), respectively. the results for qso-1s are in excellentagreement with previous measurements for optically-selected quasars, while weconclude that the obs-qsos are at least as strongly clustered as the qso-1s. wetest for the effects of photometric redshift errors on the optically-faintobs-qsos, and find that our method yields a robust lower limit on theclustering; photo-z errors may cause us to underestimate the clusteringamplitude of the obs-qsos by at most ~20%. we compare our results to previousstudies, and speculate on physical implications of stronger clustering forobscured quasars.

0704.2573	higher-order angular galaxy correlations in the sdss: redshift and color  dependence of non-linear bias	we present estimates of the n-point galaxy, area-averaged, angularcorrelation functions $\bar{\omega}_{n}$($\theta$) for $n$ = 2,...,7 forgalaxies from the fifth data release of the sloan digital sky survey. ourparent sample is selected from galaxies with $18 \leq r &lt; 21$, and is thelargest ever used to study higher-order correlations. we subdivide this parentsample into two volume limited samples using photometric redshifts, and thesetwo samples are further subdivided by magnitude, redshift, and color (producingearly- and late-type galaxy samples) to determine the dependence of$\bar{\omega}_{n}$($\theta$) on luminosity, redshift, and galaxy-type. wemeasure $\bar{\omega}_{n}$($\theta$) using oversampling techniques and use themto calculate the projected, $s_{n}$. using models derived from theoreticalpower-spectra and perturbation theory, we measure the bias parameters $b_1$ and$c_2$, finding that the large differences in both bias parameters ($b_1$ and$c_2$) between early- and late-type galaxies are robust against changes inredshift, luminosity, and $\sigma_8$, and that both terms are consistentlysmaller for late-type galaxies. by directly comparing their higher-ordercorrelation measurements, we find large differences in the clustering oflate-type galaxies at redshifts lower than 0.3 and those at redshifts higherthan 0.3, both at large scales ($c_2$ is larger by $\sim0.5$ at $z &gt; 0.3$) andsmall scales (large amplitudes are measured at small scales only for $z &gt; 0.3$,suggesting much more merger driven star formation at $z &gt; 0.3$). finally, ourmeasurements of $c_2$ suggest both that $\sigma_8 &lt; 0.8$ and $c_2$ is negative.

0709.3474	quasar clustering at $25\kpch$ from a complete sample of binaries	we present spectroscopy of binary quasar candidates selected from datarelease 4 of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss dr4) using kernel densityestimation (kde). we present 27 new sets of observations, 10 of which arebinary quasars, roughly doubling the number of known $g &lt; 21$ binaries withcomponent separations of 3 to 6". only 3 of 49 spectroscopically identifiedobjects are non-quasars, confirming that the quasar selection efficiency of thekde technique is $\sim95$%. several of our observed binaries arewide-separation lens candidates that merit additional higher-resolutionobservations. one interesting pair may be an m star binary, or an m star-binaryquasar superposition. our candidates are initially selected by uv-excess ($u-g&lt; 1$), but are otherwise selected irrespective of the relative colors of thequasar pair, and we thus use them to suggest optimal color similarity andphotometric redshift approaches for targeting binary quasars, or projectedquasar pairs. from a sample that is complete on proper scales of $23.7 &lt;r_{prop} &lt; 29.7\kpch$, we determine the projected quasar correlation functionto be $w_p=24.0 \pm^{16.9}_{10.8}$, which is $2\sigma$ lower than recentestimates. we argue that our low $w_p$ estimates may indicate redshiftevolution in the quasar correlation function from $z\sim1.9$ to $z\sim1.4$ onscales of $r_{prop} \sim25\kpch$. the size of this evolution broadly tracksquasar clustering on larger scales, consistent with merger-driven models ofquasar origin. although our sample alone is insufficient to detect evolution inquasar clustering on small scales, an $i$-selected dr6 kde quasar catalog,which will contain several hundred $z \leqsim 5$ binary quasars, could easilyconstrain any clustering evolution at $r_{prop} \sim25\kpch$.

1104.5244	the lyman-alpha forest in three dimensions: measurements of large scale  flux correlations from boss 1st-year data	using a sample of approximately 14,000 z&gt;2.1 quasars observed in the firstyear of the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss), we measure thethree-dimensional correlation function of absorption in the lyman-alpha forest.the angle-averaged correlation function of transmitted flux (f = exp(-tau)) issecurely detected out to comoving separations of 60 mpc/h, the first detectionof flux correlations across widely separated sightlines. a quadrupoledistortion of the redshift-space correlation function by peculiar velocities,the signature of the gravitational instability origin of structure in thelyman-alpha forest, is also detected at high significance. we obtain a good fitto the data assuming linear theory redshift-space distortion and linear bias ofthe transmitted flux, relative to the matter fluctuations of a standard lcdmcosmological model (inflationary cold dark matter with a cosmologicalconstant). at 95% confidence, we find a linear bias parameter 0.16&lt;b&lt;0.24 andredshift-distortion parameter 0.44&lt;beta&lt;1.20, at central redshift z=2.25, witha well constrained combination b(1+\beta)=0.336 +/- 0.012. the errors on betaare asymmetric, with beta=0 excluded at over 5 sigma confidence level. thevalue of beta is somewhat low compared to theoretical predictions, and ourtests on synthetic data suggest that it is depressed (relative to expectationsfor the lyman-alpha forest alone) by the presence of high column densitysystems and metal line absorption. these results set the stage for cosmologicalparameter determinations from three-dimensional structure in the lyman-alphaforest, including anticipated constraints on dark energy from baryon acousticoscillations.

1105.0606	the sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey: quasar target  selection for data release nine	the sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss), a five-yearspectroscopic survey of 10,000 deg^2, achieved first light in late 2009. one ofthe key goals of boss is to measure the signature of baryon acousticoscillations in the distribution of ly-alpha absorption from the spectra of asample of ~150,000 z&gt;2.2 quasars. along with measuring the angular diameterdistance at z\approx2.5, boss will provide the first direct measurement of theexpansion rate of the universe at z &gt; 2. one of the biggest challenges inachieving this goal is an efficient target selection algorithm for quasars over2.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.5, where their colors overlap those of stars. during the first yearof the boss survey, quasar target selection methods were developed and testedto meet the requirement of delivering at least 15 quasars deg^-2 in thisredshift range, out of 40 targets deg^-2. to achieve these surface densities,the magnitude limit of the quasar targets was set at g &lt;= 22.0 or r&lt;=21.85.while detection of the bao signature in the ly-alpha absorption in quasarspectra does not require a uniform target selection, many other astrophysicalstudies do. we therefore defined a uniformly-selected subsample of 20 targetsdeg^-2, for which the selection efficiency is just over 50%. this "core"subsample will be fixed for years two through five of the survey. in this paperwe describe the evolution and implementation of the boss quasar targetselection algorithms during the first two years of boss operations. we analyzethe spectra obtained during the first year. 11,263 new z&gt;2.2 quasars werespectroscopically confirmed by boss. our current algorithms select an averageof 15 z &gt; 2.2 quasars deg^-2 from 40 targets deg^-2 using single-epoch sdssimaging. multi-epoch optical data and data at other wavelengths can furtherimprove the efficiency and completeness of boss quasar target selection.[abridged]

1105.2320	ameliorating systematic uncertainties in the angular clustering of  galaxies: a study using sdss-iii	we investigate the effects of potential sources of systematic error on theangular and photometric redshift, z_phot, distributions of a sample of redshift0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.7 massive galaxies whose selection matches that of the baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) constant mass sample. utilizing over112,778 boss spectra as a training sample, we produce a photometric redshiftcatalog for the galaxies in the sdss dr8 imaging area that, after masking,covers nearly one quarter of the sky (9,913 square degrees). we investigatefluctuations in the number density of objects in this sample as a function ofgalactic extinction, seeing, stellar density, sky background, airmass,photometric offset, and north/south galactic hemisphere. we find that thepresence of stars of comparable magnitudes to our galaxies (which are nottraditionally masked) effectively remove area. failing to correct for suchstars can produce systematic errors on the measured angular auto-correlationfunction, w, that are larger than its statistical uncertainty. we describe howone can effectively mask for the presence of the stars, without removing anygalaxies from the sample, and minimize the systematic error. additionally, weapply two separate methods that can be used to correct the systematic errorsimparted by any parameter that can be turned into a map on the sky. we findthat failing to properly account for varying sky background introduces asystematic error on w. we measure w, in four z_phot slices of width 0.05between 0.45 &lt; z_phot &lt; 0.65 and find that the measurements, after correctingfor the systematic effects of stars and sky background, are generallyconsistent with a generic lambdacdm model, at scales up to 60 degrees. atscales greater than 3 degrees and z_phot &gt; 0.5, the magnitude of thecorrections we apply are greater than the statistical uncertainty in w.

1105.3975	photometric redshifts and quasar probabilities from a single,  data-driven generative model	we describe a technique for simultaneously classifying and estimating theredshift of quasars. it can separate quasars from stars in arbitrary redshiftranges, estimate full posterior distribution functions for the redshift, andnaturally incorporate flux uncertainties, missing data, and multi-wavelengthphotometry. we build models of quasars in flux-redshift space by applying theextreme deconvolution technique to estimate the underlying density. byintegrating this density over redshift one can obtain quasar flux-densities indifferent redshift ranges. this approach allows for efficient, consistent, andfast classification and photometric redshift estimation. this is achieved bycombining the speed obtained by choosing simple analytical forms as the basisof our density model with the flexibility of non-parametric models through theuse of many simple components with many parameters. we show that this techniqueis competitive with the best photometric quasar classificationtechniques---which are limited to fixed, broad redshift ranges and highsignal-to-noise ratio data---and with the best photometric redshift techniqueswhen applied to broadband optical data. we demonstrate that the inclusion of uvand nir data significantly improves photometric quasar--star separation andessentially resolves all of the redshift degeneracies for quasars inherent tothe ugriz filter system, even when included data have a low signal-to-noiseratio. for quasars spectroscopically confirmed by the sdss 84 and 97 percent ofthe objects with galex uv and ukidss nir data have photometric redshifts within0.1 and 0.3, respectively, of the spectroscopic redshift; this amounts to abouta factor of three improvement over ugriz-only photometric redshifts. our codeto calculate quasar probabilities and redshift probability distributions ispublicly available.

1107.3564	the nature of double-peaked [o iii] active galactic nuclei	active galactic nuclei (agns) with double-peaked [o iii] lines are suspectedto be sub-kpc or kpc-scale binary agns. however, pure gas kinematics canproduce the same double-peaked line profile in spatially integrated spectra.here we combine integral-field spectroscopy and high-resolution imaging of 42double-peaked [o iii] agns from sloan digital sky survey to investigate theconstituents of the population. we find two binary agns where theline-splitting is driven by the orbital motion of the merging nuclei. suchobjects account for only ~2% of the double-peaked agns. almost all (~98%) ofthe double-peaked agns were selected because of gas kinematics; and half ofthose show spatially resolved narrow-line regions that extend 4-20 kpc from thenuclei. serendipitously, we find two spectrally unresolved binary agns wheregas kinematics produced the double-peaked [o iii] lines. the relativelyfrequent serendipitous discoveries indicate that only ~1% of binary agns wouldappear double-peaked in sloan spectra and 2.2_{-0.8}^{+2.5}% of all sloan agnsare binary agns. therefore, the double-peaked sample does not offer muchadvantage over any other agn samples in finding binary agns. the binary agnfraction implies an elevated agn duty cycle (8_{-3}^{+8}%), suggesting galaxyinteractions enhance nuclear accretion. we illustrate that integral-fieldspectroscopy is crucial for identifying binary agns: several objects previouslyclassified as "binary agns" with long-slit spectra are most likely single agnswith extended narrow-line regions. the formation of extended narrow-lineregions driven by radiation pressure is also discussed.

1203.5306	the clustering of intermediate redshift quasars as measured by the  baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey	we measure the quasar two-point correlation function over the redshift range2.2&lt;z&lt;2.8 using data from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey. we use ahomogeneous subset of the data consisting of 27,129 quasars with spectroscopicredshifts---by far the largest such sample used for clustering measurements atthese redshifts to date. the sample covers 3,600 square degrees, correspondingto a comoving volume of 9.7(gpc/h)^3 assuming a fiducial lambdacdm cosmology,and it has a median absolute i-band magnitude of -26, k-corrected to z=2. afteraccounting for redshift errors we find that the redshift space correlationfunction is fit well by a power-law of slope -2 and amplitude s_0=(9.7\pm0.5)mpc/h over the range 3&lt;s&lt;25mpc/h. the projected correlation function, whichintegrates out the effects of peculiar velocities and redshift errors, is fitwell by a power-law of slope -1 and r_0=(8.4\pm 0.6)mpc/h over the range4&lt;r&lt;16mpc/h. there is no evidence for strong luminosity or redshift dependenceto the clustering amplitude, in part because of the limited dynamic range inour sample. our results are consistent with, but more precise than, previousmeasurements at similar redshifts. our measurement of the quasar clusteringamplitude implies a bias factor of b~3.5 for our quasar sample. we compare thedata to models to constrain the manner in which quasars occupy dark matterhalos at z~2.4 and infer that such quasars inhabit halos with a characteristicmass of &lt;m&gt;~10^{12}msun/h with a duty cycle for the quasar activity of 1 percent.

1207.2175	first-2mass red quasars: transitional objects emerging from the dust	we present a sample of 120 dust-reddened quasars identified by matching radiosources detected at 1.4 ghz in the first survey with the near-infrared 2masscatalog and color-selecting red sources. optical and/or near-infraredspectroscopy provide broad wavelength sampling of their spectral energydistributions that we use to determine their reddening, characterized bye(b-v). we demonstrate that the reddening in these quasars is best-described bysmc-like dust. this sample spans a wide range in redshift and reddening (0.1 &lt;z &lt; 3, 0.1 &lt; e(b-v) &lt; 1.5), which we use to investigate the possiblecorrelation of luminosity with reddening. at every redshift, dust-reddenedquasars are intrinsically the most luminous quasars. we interpret this resultin the context of merger-driven quasar/galaxy co-evolution where these reddenedquasars are revealing an emergent phase during which the heavily obscuredquasar is shedding its cocoon of dust prior to becoming a "normal" blue quasar.when correcting for extinction, we find that, depending on how the parentpopulation is defined, these red quasars make up &lt; 15-20% of the luminousquasar population. we estimate, based on the fraction of objects in this phase,that its duration is 15-20% as long as the unobscured, blue quasar phase.

1207.7326	spectral classification and redshift measurement for the sdss-iii baryon  oscillation spectroscopic survey	(abridged) we describe the automated spectral classification, redshiftdetermination, and parameter measurement pipeline in use for the baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) of the sloan digital sky survey iii(sdss-iii) as of data release 9, encompassing 831,000 moderate-resolutionoptical spectra. we give a review of the algorithms employed, and describe thechanges to the pipeline that have been implemented for boss relative toprevious sdss-i/ii versions, including new sets of stellar, galaxy, and quasarredshift templates. for the color-selected cmass sample of massive galaxies atredshift 0.4 &lt;~ z &lt;~ 0.8 targeted by boss for the purposes of large-scalecosmological measurements, the pipeline achieves an automated classificationsuccess rate of 98.7% and confirms 95.4% of unique cmass targets as galaxies(with the balance being mostly m stars). based on visual inspections of asubset of boss galaxies, we find that ~0.2% of confidently reported cmasssample classifications and redshifts are incorrect, and ~0.4% of all cmassspectra are objects unclassified by the current algorithm which are potentiallyrecoverable. the boss pipeline confirms that ~51.5% of the quasar targets havequasar spectra, with the balance mainly consisting of stars. statistical (asopposed to systematic) redshift errors propagated from photon noise aretypically a few tens of km/s for both galaxies and quasars, with a significanttail to a few hundreds of km/s for quasars. we test the accuracy of thesestatistical redshift error estimates using repeat observations, finding themunderestimated by a factor of 1.19 to 1.34 for galaxies, and by a factor of 2for quasars. we assess the impact of sky-subtraction quality, s/n, and otherfactors on galaxy redshift success. finally, we document known issues, anddescribe directions of ongoing development.

0711.3414	developing and deploying advanced algorithms to novel supercomputing  hardware	the objective of our research is to demonstrate the practical usage andorders of magnitude speedup of real-world applications by using alternativetechnologies to support high performance computing. currently, the main barrierto the widespread adoption of this technology is the lack of development toolsand case studies that typically impede non-specialists that might otherwisedevelop applications that could leverage these technologies. by partnering withthe innovative systems laboratory at the national center for supercomputing, wehave obtained access to several novel technologies, including severalfield-programmable gate array (fpga) systems, nvidia graphics processing units(gpus), and the sti cell be platform. our goal is to not only demonstrate thecapabilities of these systems, but to also serve as guides for others to followin our path. to date, we have explored the efficacy of the src-6 map-c andmap-e and sgi rasc athena and rc100 reconfigurable computing platforms insupporting a two-point correlation function which is used in a number ofdifferent scientific domains. in a brute force test, the fpga basedsingle-processor system has achieved an almost two orders of magnitude speedupover a single-processor cpu system. we are now developing implementations ofthis algorithm on other platforms, including one using a gpu. given theconsiderable efforts of the cosmology community in optimizing these classes ofalgorithms, we are currently working to implement an optimized version of thebasic family of correlation functions by using tree-based data structures.finally, we are also exploring other algorithms, such as instance-basedclassifiers, power spectrum estimators, and higher-order correlation functionsthat are also commonly used in a wide range of scientific disciplines.

1211.2616	baryon acoustic oscillations in the ly-\alpha\ forest of boss quasars	we report a detection of the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) feature in thethree-dimensional correlation function of the transmitted flux fraction in the\lya forest of high-redshift quasars. the study uses 48,640 quasars in theredshift range $2.1\le z \le 3.5$ from the baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey (boss) of the third generation of the sloan digital sky survey(sdss-iii). at a mean redshift $z=2.3$, we measure the monopole and quadrupolecomponents of the correlation function for separations in the range$20\hmpc&lt;r&lt;200\hmpc$. a peak in the correlation function is seen at aseparation equal to $(1.01\pm0.03)$ times the distance expected for the baopeak within a concordance $\lambda$cdm cosmology. this first detection of thebao peak at high redshift, when the universe was strongly matter dominated,results in constraints on the angular diameter distance $\da$ and the expansionrate $h$ at $z=2.3$ that, combined with priors on $h_0$ and the baryon density,require the existence of dark energy. combined with constraints derived fromcosmic microwave background (cmb) observations, this result implies$h(z=2.3)=(224\pm8){\rm km\,s^{-1}mpc^{-1}}$, indicating that the timederivative of the cosmological scale parameter $\dot{a}=h(z=2.3)/(1+z)$ issignificantly greater than that measured with bao at $z\sim0.5$. thisdemonstrates that the expansion was decelerating in the range $0.7&lt;z&lt;2.3$, asexpected from the matter domination during this epoch. combined withmeasurements of $h_0$, one sees the pattern of deceleration followed byacceleration characteristic of a dark-energy dominated universe.

1301.3459	measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations in the lyman-alpha forest  fluctuations in boss data release 9	we use the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) data release 9(dr9) to detect and measure the position of the baryonic acoustic oscillation(bao) feature in the three-dimensional correlation function in the lyman-alphaforest flux fluctuations at a redshift z=2.4. the feature is clearly detectedat significance between 3 and 5 sigma (depending on the broadband model andmethod of error covariance matrix estimation) and is consistent withpredictions of the standard lcdm model. we assess the biases in our method,stability of the error covariance matrix and possible systematic effects. wefit the resulting correlation function with several models that decouple thebroadband and acoustic scale information. for an isotropic dilation factor, wemeasure 100x(alpha_iso-1) = -1.6 ^{+2.0+4.3+7.4}_{-2.0-4.1-6.8} (stat.) +/- 1.0(syst.) (multiple statistical errors denote 1,2 and 3 sigma confidence limits)with respect to the acoustic scale in the fiducial cosmological model (flatlcdm with omega_m=0.27, h=0.7). when fitting separately for the radial andtransversal dilation factors we find marginalised constraints 100x(alpha_par-1)= -1.3 ^{+3.5+7.6 +12.3}_{-3.3-6.7-10.2} (stat.) +/- 2.0 (syst.) and100x(alpha_perp-1) = -2.2 ^{+7.4+17}_{-7.1-15} +/- 3.0 (syst.). the dilationfactor measurements are significantly correlated with cross-correlationcoefficient of ~ -0.55. errors become significantly non-gaussian for deviationsover 3 standard deviations from best fit value. because of the data cuts andanalysis method, these measurements give tighter constraints than a previousbao analysis of the boss dr9 lyman-alpha forest sample, providing an importantconsistency test of the standard cosmological model in a new redshift regime.

0712.2474	agn environments in the sloan digital sky survey i: dependence on type,  redshift, and luminosity	we explore how the local environment is related to the redshift, type, andluminosity of active galactic nuclei (agn). recent simulations and observationsare converging on the view that the extreme luminosity of quasars is fueled inmajor mergers of gas-rich galaxies. in such a picture, quasars are expected tobe located in regions with a higher density of galaxies on small scales wheremergers are more likely to take place. however, in this picture, the activityobserved in low-luminosity agn is due to secular processes that are lessdependent on the local galaxy density. to test this hypothesis, we compare thelocal photometric galaxy density on kiloparsec scales around spectroscopic typei and type ii quasars to the local density around lower luminosityspectroscopic type i and type ii agn. to minimize projection effects andevolution in the photometric galaxy sample we use to characterize agnenvironments, we place our random control sample at the same redshift as ouragn and impose a narrow redshift window around both the agn and controltargets. we find that higher luminosity agn have more overdense environmentscompared to lower luminosity agn on all scales out to our $2\mpchseventy$limit. additionally, in the range $0.3\leqslant z\leqslant 0.6$, type iiquasars have similarly overdense environments to those of bright type i quasarson all scales out to our $2\mpchseventy$ limit, while the environment of dimmertype i quasars appears to be less overdense than the environment of type iiquasars. we see increased overdensity for type ii agn compared to type i agn onscales out to our limit of $2\mpchseventy$ in overlapping redshift ranges. wealso detect marginal evidence for evolution in the number of galaxies within$2\mpchseventy$ of a quasar with redshift.

1303.1937	the large-scale quasar-lyman \alpha\ forest cross-correlation from boss	we measure the large-scale cross-correlation of quasars with the lyman\alpha\ forest absorption in redshift space, using ~ 60000 quasar spectra fromdata release 9 (dr9) of the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss). thecross-correlation is detected over a wide range of scales, up to comovingseparations r of 80 mpc/h. for r &gt; 15 mpc/h, we show that the cross-correlationis well fitted by the linear theory prediction for the mean overdensity arounda quasar host halo in the standard \lambda cdm model, with the redshiftdistortions indicative of gravitational evolution detected at high confidence.using previous determinations of the lyman \alpha\ forest bias factor obtainedfrom the lyman \alpha\ autocorrelation, we infer the quasar bias factor to beb_q = 3.64^+0.13_-0.15 at a mean redshift z=2.38, in agreement with previousmeasurements from the quasar auto-correlation. we also obtain a new estimate ofthe lyman \alpha\ forest redshift distortion factor, \beta_f = 1.1 +/- 0.15,slightly larger than but consistent with the previous measurement from thelyman \alpha\ forest autocorrelation. the simple linear model we use fails atseparations r &lt; 15 mpc/h, and we show that this may reasonably be due to theenhanced ionization due to radiation from the quasars. we also provide theexpected correction that the mass overdensity around the quasar implies formeasurements of the ionizing radiation background from the line-of-sightproximity effect.

1306.5896	the one-dimensional ly-alpha forest power spectrum from boss	we have developed two independent methods to measure the one-dimensionalpower spectrum of the transmitted flux in the lyman-$\alpha$ forest. the firstmethod is based on a fourier transform, and the second on a maximum likelihoodestimator. the two methods are independent and have different systematicuncertainties. the determination of the noise level in the data spectra wassubject to a novel treatment, because of its significant impact on the derivedpower spectrum.  we applied the two methods to 13,821 quasar spectra from sdss-iii/boss dr9selected from a larger sample of over 60,000 spectra on the basis of their highquality, large signal-to-noise ratio, and good spectral resolution. the powerspectra measured using either approach are in good agreement over all twelveredshift bins from $&lt;z&gt; = 2.2$ to $&lt;z&gt; = 4.4$, and scales from 0.001$\rm(km/s)^{-1}$ to $0.02 \rm(km/s)^{-1}$. we determine the methodological andinstrumental systematic uncertainties of our measurements.  we provide a preliminary cosmological interpretation of our measurementsusing available hydrodynamical simulations. the improvement in precision overpreviously published results from sdss is a factor 2--3 for constraints onrelevant cosmological parameters. for a $\lambda$cdm model and using aconstraint on $h_0$ that encompasses measurements based on the local distanceladder and on cmb anisotropies, we infer $\sigma_8 =0.83\pm0.03$ and $n_s=0.97\pm0.02$ based on \ion{h}{i} absorption in the range $2.1&lt;z&lt;3.7$.

1307.1731	does size matter? the underlying intrinsic size distribution of radio  sources and implications for unification by orientation	unification by orientation is a ubiquitous concept in the study of activegalactic nuclei. a gold standard of the orientation paradigm is the hypothesisthat radio galaxies and radio-loud quasars are intrinsically the same, but areobserved over different ranges of viewing angles. historically, strong supportfor this model was provided by the projected sizes of radio structure inluminous radio galaxies, which were found to be significantly larger than thoseof quasars, as predicted due to simple geometric projection. recently, thistest of the simplest prediction of orientation-based models has been revisitedwith larger samples that cover wider ranges of fundamental properties---and noclear difference in projected sizes of radio structure is found. cast solely interms of viewing angle effects, these results provide convincing evidence thatunification of these objects solely through orientation fails. however, it ispossible that conflicting results regarding the role orientation plays in ourview of radio sources simply result from insufficient sampling of theirintrinsic size distribution. we test this possibility using monte-carlosimulations constrained by real sample sizes and properties. we develop modelsfor the real intrinsic size distribution of radio sources, simulateobservations by randomly sampling intrinsic sizes and viewing angles, andanalyze how likely each sample is to support or dispute unification byorientation. we find that, while it is possible to reconcile conflictingresults purely within a simple, orientation-based framework, it is veryunlikely. we analyze the effects that sample size, relative numbers of radiogalaxies and quasars, the critical angle that separates the two subclasses, andthe shape of the intrinsic size distribution have on this type of test.

1307.7289	candidate type ii quasars at 2 &lt; z &lt; 4.3 in the sloan digital sky survey  iii	at low redshifts, dust-obscured quasars often have strong yet narrowpermitted lines in the rest-frame optical and ultraviolet, excited by thecentral active nucleus, earning the designation type ii quasars. we present asample of 145 candidate type ii quasars at redshifts between 2 and 4.3,encompassing the epoch at which quasar activity peaked in the universe. theseobjects, selected from the quasar sample of the baryon oscillationspectroscopic survey of the sloan digital sky survey iii, are characterized byweak continuum in the rest-frame ultraviolet (typical continuum magnitude of i\approx 22) and strong lines of civ and ly \alpha, with full width at halfmaximum less than 2000 kms-1. the continuum magnitudes correspond to anabsolute magnitude of -23 or brighter at redshift 3, too bright to be dueexclusively to the host galaxies of these objects. roughly one third of theobjects are detected in the shorter-wavelength bands of the wise survey; thespectral energy distributions (seds) of these objects appear to be intermediatebetween classic type i and type ii quasars seen at lower redshift. five objectsare detected at rest frame 6\mu m by spitzer, implying bolometric luminositiesof several times 10^46 erg s-1. we have obtained polarization measurements fortwo objects; they are roughly 3% polarized. we suggest that these objects areluminous quasars, with modest dust extinction (a_v ~ 0.5 mag), whoseultraviolet continuum also includes a substantial scattering contribution.alternatively, the line of sight to the central engines of these objects may bepartially obscured by optically thick material.

1307.7735	the tenth data release of the sloan digital sky survey: first  spectroscopic data from the sdss-iii apache point observatory galactic  evolution experiment	the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) has been in operation since 2000 april.this paper presents the tenth public data release (dr10) from its currentincarnation, sdss-iii. this data release includes the first spectroscopic datafrom the apache point observatory galaxy evolution experiment (apogee), alongwith spectroscopic data from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss)taken through 2012 july. the apogee instrument is a near-infrared r~22,500300-fiber spectrograph covering 1.514--1.696 microns. the apogee survey isstudying the chemical abundances and radial velocities of roughly 100,000 redgiant star candidates in the bulge, bar, disk, and halo of the milky way. dr10includes 178,397 spectra of 57,454 stars, each typically observed three or moretimes, from apogee. derived quantities from these spectra (radial velocities,effective temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities) are alsoincluded.dr10 also roughly doubles the number of boss spectra over thoseincluded in the ninth data release. dr10 includes a total of 1,507,954 bossspectra, comprising 927,844 galaxy spectra; 182,009 quasar spectra; and 159,327stellar spectra, selected over 6373.2 square degrees.

1308.2685	a glance at the host galaxy of high-redshift quasars using strong damped  lyman-alpha systems as coronagraphs	we searched quasar spectra from the sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey (boss) for the rare occurrences where a strong damped lyman-alphaabsorber (dla) blocks the broad line region emission from the quasar and actsas a natural coronagraph to reveal narrow ly\alpha\ emission from the hostgalaxy. we define a statistical sample of 31 dlas in data release 9 (dr9) withlog n(hi) &gt; 21.3 cm^-2 located at less than 1500 km s^-1 from the quasarredshift. in 25% (8) of these dlas, a strong narrow ly\alpha\ emission line isobserved with flux ~25 x 10^-17 erg s^-1 cm^-2 on average. for dlas withoutthis feature in their troughs, the average 3-\sigma\ upper limit is &lt; 0.8 x10^-17 erg s^-1 cm^-2. our statistical sample is nearly 2.5 times larger thanthe anticipated number of intervening dlas in dr9 within 1500 km s^-1 of thequasar redshift. we also define a sample of 26 dlas from dr9 and dr10 withnarrow ly\alpha\ emission detected and no limit on the hi column density tobetter characterize properties of the host galaxy emission. analyzing thestatistical sample, we do not find substantial differences in the kinematics,metals, or reddening for the two populations with and without emissiondetected. the highly symmetric narrow ly\alpha\ emission line profile centeredin the hi trough indicates that the emitting region is separate from theabsorber. the luminosity of the narrow ly\alpha\ emission peaks is intermediatebetween that of lyman-alpha emitters and radio galaxies, implying that thely\alpha\ emission is predominantly due to ionizing radiation from the agn.galaxies neighboring the quasar host are likely responsible for the majority (&gt;75%) of these dlas, with only a minority (&lt; 25%) arising from hi clouds locatedin the agn host galaxy.

1309.2954	characterizing unknown systematics in large scale structure surveys	photometric large scale structure (lss) surveys probe the largest volumes inthe universe, but are inevitably limited by systematic uncertainties. imperfectphotometric calibration leads to biases in our measurements of the densityfields of lss tracers such as galaxies and quasars, and as a result incosmological parameter estimation. earlier studies have proposed usingcross-correlations between different redshift slices or cross-correlationsbetween different surveys to reduce the effects of such systematics. in thispaper we develop a method to characterize unknown systematics. we demonstratethat while we do not have sufficient information to correct for unknownsystematics in the data, we can obtain an estimate of their magnitude. wedefine a parameter to estimate contamination from unknown systematics usingcross-correlations between different redshift slices and propose discardingbins in the angular power spectrum that lie outside a certain contaminationtolerance level. we show that this method improves estimates of the bias usingsimulated data and further apply it to photometric luminous red galaxies in thesloan digital sky survey as a case study.

1309.5364	broad absorption line variability on multi-year timescales in a large  quasar sample	we present a detailed investigation of the variability of 428 c iv and 235 siiv broad absorption line (bal) troughs identified in multi-epoch observationsof 291 quasars by the sloan digital sky survey-i/ii/iii. these observationsprimarily sample rest-frame timescales of 1-3 yr over which significantrearrangement of the bal wind is expected. we derive a number of observationalresults on, e.g., the frequency of bal variability, the velocity range overwhich bal variability occurs, the primary observed form of bal-troughvariability, the dependence of bal variability upon timescale, the frequency ofbal strengthening vs. weakening, correlations between bal variability andbal-trough profiles, relations between c iv and si iv bal variability,coordinated multi-trough variability, and bal variations as a function ofquasar properties. we assess implications of these observational results forquasar winds. our results support models where most bal absorption is formedwithin an order-of-magnitude of the wind-launching radius, although asignificant minority of bal troughs may arise on larger scales. we estimate anaverage lifetime for a bal trough along our line-of-sight of a few thousandyears. bal disappearance and emergence events appear to be extremes of generalbal variability, rather than being qualitatively distinct phenomena. we derivethe parameters of a random-walk model for bal ew variability, finding that thismodel can acceptably describe some key aspects of ew variability. thecoordinated trough variability of bal quasars with multiple troughs suggeststhat changes in "shielding gas" may play a significant role in driving generalbal variability.

1310.0836	x-ray surface brightness profiles of active galactic nuclei in the  extended groth strip: implications for agn feedback	using data from the all wavelength extended groth strip international survey(aegis) we statistically detect the extended x-ray emission in the interstellarmedium (ism)/intra-cluster medium (icm) in both active and normal galaxies at0.3 &lt;= z &lt;= 1.3. for both active galactic nuclei (agn) host galaxy and normalgalaxy samples that are matched in restframe color, luminosity, and redshiftdistribution, we tentatively detect excess x-ray emission at scales of 1--10arcsec at a few sigma significance in the surface brightness profiles. theexact significance of this detection is sensitive to the true characterizationof chandra's point spread function. the observed excess in the surfacebrightness profiles is suggestive of lower extended emission in agn hostscompared to normal galaxies. this is qualitatively similar to theoreticalpredictions of the x-ray surface brightness profile from agn feedback models,where feedback from agn is likely to evacuate the gas from the center of thegalaxy/cluster. we propose that agn that are intrinsically under-luminous inx-rays, but have equivalent bolometric luminosities to our sources will be theideal sample to study more robustly the effect of agn feedback on diffuseism/icm gas.

1311.2597	sloan digital sky survey iii photometric quasar clustering: probing the  initial conditions of the universe using the largest volume	the sloan digital sky survey has surveyed 14,555 square degrees of the sky,and delivered over a trillion pixels of imaging data. we present thelarge-scale clustering of 1.6 million quasars between z = 0.5 and z = 2.5 thathave been classified from this imaging, representing the highest density ofquasars ever studied for clustering measurements. this data set spans ~11,000square degrees and probes a volume of 80(gpc/h)^3. in principle, such a largevolume and medium density of tracers should facilitate high-precisioncosmological constraints. we measure the angular clustering of photometricallyclassified quasars using an optimal quadratic estimator in four redshift sliceswith an accuracy of ~25% over a bin width of l ~10 - 15 on scales correspondingto matter-radiation equality and larger (l ~ 2 - 30). observational systematicscan strongly bias clustering measurements on large scales, which can mimiccosmologically relevant signals such as deviations from gaussianity in thespectrum of primordial perturbations. we account for systematics by employing anew method recently proposed by agarwal et al. (2014) to the clustering ofphotometrically classified quasars. we carefully apply our methodology tomitigate known observational systematics and further remove angular bins thatare contaminated by unknown systematics. combining quasar data with thephotometric luminous red galaxy (lrg) sample of ross et al. (2011) and ho etal. (2012), and marginalizing over all bias and shot noise-like parameters, weobtain a constraint on local primordial non-gaussianity of fnl = -113+/-154(1\sigma error). [abridged]

1311.4870	the sloan digital sky survey quasar catalog: tenth data release	we present the data release 10 quasar (dr10q) catalog from the baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) of the sloan digital sky survey iii.the catalog includes all boss objects that were targeted as quasar candidatesduring the first 2.5 years of the survey and that are confirmed as quasars viavisual inspection of the spectra. the catalog also includes known quasars(mostly from sdss-i and ii) that were reobserved by boss. the catalog contains166,583 quasars (74,454 are new discoveries since sdss-dr9) detected over 6,373deg$^{2}$ with robust identification and redshift measured by a combination ofprincipal component eigenspectra. the number of quasars with $z&gt;2.15$ (117,668)is $\sim$5 times greater than the number of $z&gt;2.15$ quasars known prior toboss. redshifts and fwhms are provided for the strongest emission lines (civ,ciii, mgii). the catalog identifies 16,461 broad absorption line quasars andgives their characteristics. for each object, the catalog presents five-band(u, g, r, i, z) ccd-based photometry with typical accuracy of 0.03 mag andinformation on the optical morphology and selection method. the catalog alsocontains x-ray, ultraviolet, near-infrared, and radio emission properties ofthe quasars, when available, from other large-area surveys. the calibrateddigital spectra cover the wavelength region 3,600-10,500\aa\ at a spectralresolution in the range 1,300$&lt;$r$&lt;$2,500; the spectra can be retrieved fromthe sdss catalog archive server. we also provide a supplemental list of anadditional 2,376 quasars that have been identified among the galaxy targets ofthe sdss-iii/boss.

1404.1801	baryon acoustic oscillations in the ly{\alpha} forest of boss dr11  quasars	we report a detection of the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) feature in theflux-correlation function of the ly{\alpha} forest of high-redshift quasarswith a statistical significance of five standard deviations. the study uses137,562 quasars in the redshift range $2.1\le z \le 3.5$ from the data release11 (dr11) of the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) of sdss-iii.this sample contains three times the number of quasars used in previousstudies. the measured position of the bao peak determines the angular distance,$d_a(z=2.34)$ and expansion rate, $h(z=2.34)$, both on a scale set by the soundhorizon at the drag epoch, $r_d$. we find$d_a/r_d=11.28\pm0.65(1\sigma)^{+2.8}_{-1.2}(2\sigma)$ and$d_h/r_d=9.18\pm0.28(1\sigma)\pm0.6(2\sigma)$ where $d_h=c/h$. the optimalcombination, $\sim d_h^{0.7}d_a^{0.3}/r_d$ is determined with a precision of$\sim2\%$. for the value $r_d=147.4~{\rm mpc}$, consistent with the cmb powerspectrum measured by planck, we find $d_a(z=2.34)=1662\pm96(1\sigma)~{\rm mpc}$and $h(z=2.34)=222\pm7(1\sigma)~{\rm km\,s^{-1}mpc^{-1}}$. tests with mockcatalogs and variations of our analysis procedure have revealed no systematicuncertainties comparable to our statistical errors. our results agree with thepreviously reported bao measurement at the same redshift using thequasar-ly{\alpha} forest cross-correlation. the auto-correlation andcross-correlation approaches are complementary because of the quite differentimpact of redshift-space distortion on the two measurements. the combinedconstraints from the two correlation functions imply values of $d_a/r_d$ and$d_h/r_d$ that are, respectively, 7% low and 7% high compared to thepredictions of a flat $\lambda$cdm cosmological model with the best-fit planckparameters. with our estimated statistical errors, the significance of thisdiscrepancy is $\approx 2.5\sigma$.

1404.1921	gemini long-slit observations of luminous obscured quasars: further  evidence for an upper limit on the size of the narrow-line region	we examine the spatial extent of the narrow-line regions (nlrs) of a sampleof 30 luminous obscured quasars at $0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.7$ observed with spatiallyresolved gemini-n gmos long-slit spectroscopy. using the [oiii]$\lambda5007$emission feature, we estimate the size of the nlr using a cosmology-independentmeasurement: the radius where the surface brightness falls to 10$^{-15}$ ergs$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$. we then explore the effects of atmosphericseeing on nlr size measurements and conclude that direct measurements of thenlr size from observed profiles are too large by 0.1 - 0.2 dex on average, ascompared to measurements made to best-fit s\'{e}rsic or voigt profilesconvolved with the seeing. these data, which span a full order of magnitude inir luminosity ($\log{(l_{8 \mu \mathrm{m}} / \mathrm{erg\, s}^{-1})} = 44.4 -45.4$) also provide strong evidence that there is a flattening of therelationship between nlr size and agn luminosity at a seeing-corrected size of$\sim 7$ kpc. the objects in this sample have high luminosities which placethem in a previously under-explored portion of the size-luminosityrelationship. these results support the existence of a maximal size of thenarrow-line region around luminous quasars; beyond this size either there isnot enough gas, or the gas is over-ionized and does not produce enough[oiii]$\lambda5007$ emission.

1407.2250	the dependence of c iv broad absorption line properties on accompanying  si iv and al iii absorption: relating quasar-wind ionization levels,  kinematics, and column densities	we consider how the profile and multi-year variability properties of a largesample of c iv broad absorption line (bal) troughs change when bals from si ivand/or al iii are present at corresponding velocities, indicating that theline-of-sight intercepts at least some lower ionization gas. we derive a numberof observational results for c iv bals separated according to the presence orabsence of accompanying lower ionization transitions, including measurements ofcomposite profile shapes, equivalent width (ew), characteristic velocities,composite variation profiles, and ew variability. we also measure thecorrelations between ew and fractional-ew variability for c iv, si iv, and aliii. our measurements reveal the basic correlated changes between ionizationlevel, kinematics, and column density expected in accretion-disk wind models;e.g., lines-of-sight including lower ionization material generally show deeperand broader c iv troughs that have smaller minimum velocities and that are lessvariable. many c iv bals with no accompanying si iv or al iii bals may haveonly mild or no saturation.

1408.1893	radio-loud and radio-quiet bal quasars: a detailed ultraviolet  comparison	studies of radio-loud (rl) broad absorption line (bal) quasars indicate thatpopular orientation-based bal models fail to account for all observations. arethese results extendable to radio-quiet (rq) bal quasars? comparisons of rl andrq bal quasars show that many of their properties are quite similar. here weextend these analyses to the rest-frame ultraviolet (uv) spectral properties,using a sample of 73 rl and 473 rq bal quasars selected from the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss). each rq quasar is individually matched to a rl quasar inboth redshift (over the range $1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.5$) and continuum luminosity. wecompare several continuum, emission line, and absorption line properties, aswell as physical properties derived from these measurements. most properties inthe samples are statistically identical, though we find slight differences inthe velocity structure of the bals that cause apparent differences in civemission line properties. differences in the velocities may indicate aninteraction between the radio jets and the absorbing material. we also findthat uv feii emission is marginally stronger in rl bal quasars. all of thesedifferences are subtle, so in general we conclude that rl and rq bal qsos arenot fundamentally different objects, except in their radio properties. they aretherefore likely to be driven by similar physical phenomena, suggesting thatresults from samples of rl bal quasars can be extended to their rqcounterparts.

1409.4773	a spectroscopic survey of wise-selected obscured quasars with the  southern african large telescope	we present the results of an optical spectroscopic survey of a sample of 40candidate obscured quasars identified on the basis of their mid-infraredemission detected by the wide-field infrared survey explorer (wise). opticalspectra for this survey were obtained using the robert stobie spectrograph(rss) on the southern african large telescope (salt). our sample was selectedwith wise colors characteristic of agns, as well as red optical to mid-ircolors indicating that the optical/uv agn continuum is obscured by dust. weobtain secure redshifts for the majority of the objects that comprise oursample (35/40), and find that sources that are bright in the wise w4 (22$\mu$m)band are typically at moderate redshift (&lt;z&gt; = 0.35$) while sources fainter inw4 are at higher redshifts (&lt;z&gt; = 0.73$). the majority of the sources havenarrow emission lines, with optical colors and emission line ratios of ourwise-selected sources that are consistent with the locus of agn on therest-frame $g-z$ color vs. [neiii]$\lambda$3869 /[oii]$\lambda\lambda$3726+3729 line ratio diagnostic diagram. we also useempirical agn and galaxy templates to model the spectral energy distributions(seds) for the objects in our sample, and find that while there is significantvariation in the observed seds for these objects, the majority require a strongagn component. finally, we use the results from our analysis of the opticalspectra and the seds to compare our selection criteria to alternate criteriapresented in the literature. these results verify the efficacy of selectingluminous obscured agns based on their wise colors.

1411.1074	cosmological implications of baryon acoustic oscillation (bao)  measurements	we derive constraints on cosmological parameters and tests of dark energymodels from the combination of baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) measurementswith cosmic microwave background (cmb) and type ia supernova (sn) data. we takeadvantage of high-precision bao measurements from galaxy clustering and thely-alpha forest (lyaf) in the boss survey of sdss-iii. bao data alone yield ahigh confidence detection of dark energy, and in combination with the cmbangular acoustic scale they further imply a nearly flat universe. combining baoand sn data into an "inverse distance ladder" yields a 1.7% measurement of$h_0=67.3 \pm1.1$ km/s/mpc. this measurement assumes standard pre-recombinationphysics but is insensitive to assumptions about dark energy or space curvature,so agreement with cmb-based estimates that assume a flat lcdm cosmology is animportant corroboration of this minimal cosmological model. for open lcdm, ourbao+sn+cmb combination yields $\omega_m=0.301 \pm 0.008$ and curvature$\omega_k=-0.003 \pm 0.003$. when we allow more general forms of evolving darkenergy, the bao+sn+cmb parameter constraints remain consistent with flat lcdm.while the overall $\chi^2$ of model fits is satisfactory, the lyaf baomeasurements are in moderate (2-2.5 sigma) tension with model predictions.models with early dark energy that tracks the dominant energy component at highredshifts remain consistent with our constraints. expansion history aloneyields an upper limit of 0.56 ev on the summed mass of neutrino species,improving to 0.26 ev if we include planck cmb lensing. standard dark energymodels constrained by our data predict a level of matter clustering that ishigh compared to most, but not all, observational estimates.

0804.3325	normalization of the matter power spectrum via higher-order angular  correlations of luminous red galaxies	we present a novel technique to measure $\sigma_8$, by measuring thedependence of the second-order bias of a density field on $\sigma_8$ using twoseparate techniques. each technique employs area-averaged angular correlationfunctions ($\bar{\omega}_n$), one relying on the shape of $\bar{\omega}_2$, theother relying on the amplitude of $s_3$ ($s_3=\bar{\omega}_3/\bar{\omega}_2^2$). we confirm the validity of the method bytesting it on a mock catalog drawn from millennium simulation data and finding$\sigma_8^{measured}- \sigma_8^{true} = -0.002 \pm 0.062$. we create a catalogof photometrically selected lrgs from sdss dr5 and separate it into threedistinct data sets by photometric redshift, with median redshifts of 0.47,0.53, and 0.61. measurements of $c_2$, and $\sigma_8$ are made for each dataset, assuming flat geometry and wmap3 best-fit priors on $\omega_m$, $h$, and$\gamma$. we find, with increasing redshfit, $c_2 = 0.09 \pm 0.04$, $0.09 \pm0.05$, and $0.09 \pm 0.03$ and $\sigma_8 = 0.78 \pm 0.08$, $0.80 \pm 0.09$, and$0.80 \pm 0.09$. we combine these three consistent $\sigma_8$ measurements toproduce the result $\sigma_8 = 0.79 \pm 0.05$. allowing the parameters$\omega_m$, $h$, and $\gamma$ to vary within their wmap3 1$\sigma$ error, wefind that the best-fit $\sigma_8$ does not change by more than 8% and we arethus confident our measurement is accurate to within 10%. we anticipate thatfuture surveys, such as pan-starrs, des, and lsst, will be able to employ thismethod to measure $\sigma_8$ to great precision, and will serve as an importantcheck, complementary, on the values determined via more established methods.

0804.3413	robust machine learning applied to astronomical datasets iii:  probabilistic photometric redshifts for galaxies and quasars in the sdss and  galex	we apply machine learning in the form of a nearest neighbor instance-basedalgorithm (nn) to generate full photometric redshift probability densityfunctions (pdfs) for objects in the fifth data release of the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss dr5). we use a conceptually simple but novel application of nn togenerate the pdfs - perturbing the object colors by their measurement error -and using the resulting instances of nearest neighbor distributions to generatenumerous individual redshifts. when the redshifts are compared to existing sdssspectroscopic data, we find that the mean value of each pdf has a dispersionbetween the photometric and spectroscopic redshift consistent with othermachine learning techniques, being sigma = 0.0207 +/- 0.0001 for main samplegalaxies to r &lt; 17.77 mag, sigma = 0.0243 +/- 0.0002 for luminous red galaxiesto r &lt; ~19.2 mag, and sigma = 0.343 +/- 0.005 for quasars to i &lt; 20.3 mag. thepdfs allow the selection of subsets with improved statistics. for quasars, theimprovement is dramatic: for those with a single peak in their probabilitydistribution, the dispersion is reduced from 0.343 to sigma = 0.117 +/- 0.010,and the photometric redshift is within 0.3 of the spectroscopic redshift for99.3 +/- 0.1% of the objects. thus, for this optical quasar sample, we canvirtually eliminate 'catastrophic' photometric redshift estimates. in additionto the sdss sample, we incorporate ultraviolet photometry from the third datarelease of the galaxy evolution explorer all-sky imaging survey (galex ais gr3)to create pdfs for objects seen in both surveys. for quasars, the increasedcoverage of the observed frame uv of the sed results in significant improvementover the full sdss sample, with sigma = 0.234 +/- 0.010. we demonstrate thatthis improvement is genuine.

1507.08380	clustering of intermediate redshift quasars using the final sdss  iii-boss sample	we measure the two-point clustering of spectroscopically confirmed quasarsfrom the final sample of the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) oncomoving scales of 4 &lt; s &lt; 22 mpc/h. the sample covers 6950 deg^2 (~ 19(gpc/h)^3) and, over the redshift range 2.2 &lt; z &lt; 2.8, contains 55,826homogeneously selected quasars, which is twice as many as in any similar work.we deduce b_q = 3.54 +/- 0.10 ; the most precise measurement of quasar bias todate at these redshifts. this corresponds to a host halo mass of ~ 2 x 10^12 ~m_sun/h with an implied quasar duty cycle of ~1 percent. the real-spaceprojected correlation function is well-fit by a power law of index -2 andcorrelation length r0 = (8.12 +/- 0.22), mpc/h over scales of 4 &lt; rp &lt; 25 ~mpc/h. to better study the evolution of quasar clustering at moderate redshift,we extend the redshift range of our study to z ~ 3.4 and measure the bias andcorrelation length of three subsamples over 2.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.4. we find nosignificant evolution of r0 or bias over this range, implying that the hosthalo mass of quasars decreases somewhat with increasing redshift. we findquasar clustering remains similar over a decade in luminosity, contradicting ascenario in which quasar luminosity is monotonically related to halo mass at z~ 2.5. our results are broadly consistent with previous boss measurements, butthey yield more precise constraints based upon a larger and more uniform dataset.

1508.04121	quasar classification using color and variability	we conduct a pilot investigation to determine the optimal combination ofcolor and variability information to identify quasars in current and futuremulti-epoch optical surveys. we use a bayesian quasar selection algorithm(richards et al. 2004) to identify 35,820 type 1 quasar candidates in a 239square degree field of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) stripe 82, using acombination of optical photometry and variability. color analysis is performedon 5-band single- and multi-epoch sdss optical photometry to a depth of r~22.4. from these data, variability parameters are calculated by fitting thestructure function of each object in each band with a power law model using 10to &gt;100 observations over timescales from ~1 day to ~8 years. selection wasbased on a training sample of 13,221 spectroscopically-confirmed type-1quasars, largely from the sdss. using variability alone, colors alone, andcombining variability and colors we achieve 91%, 93%, and 97% quasarcompleteness and 98%, 98%, and 97% efficiency respectively, with particularimprovement in the selection of quasars at 2.7&lt;z&lt;3.5 where quasars and starshave similar optical colors. the 22,867 quasar candidates that are notspectroscopically confirmed reach a depth of i ~22.0; 21,876 (95.7%) are dimmerthan coadded i-band magnitude of 19.9, the cut off for spectroscopic follow-upfor sdss on stripe 82. brighter than 19.9, we find 5.7% more quasar candidateswithout confirming spectra in sky regions otherwise considered complete. theresulting quasar sample has sufficient purity (and statistically correctableincompleteness) to produce a luminosity function comparable to those determinedby spectroscopic investigations. we discuss improvements that can be made tothe process in preparation for performing similar photometric selection andscience on data from post-sdss sky surveys.

1508.04472	the sdss-iv extended baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey: quasar  target selection	as part of the sloan digital sky survey iv the extended baryon oscillationspectroscopic survey (eboss) will improve measurements of the cosmologicaldistance scale by applying the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) method toquasar samples. eboss will adopt two approaches to target quasars over 7500 sq.deg. first, a "core" quasar sample will combine optical selection in ugrizusing a likelihood-based routine called xdqsoz, with a mid-ir-opticalcolor-cut. eboss core selection (to g &lt; 22 or r &lt; 22) should return ~ 70quasars per sq. deg. at redshifts 0.9 &lt; z &lt; 2.2 and ~7 z &gt; 2.1 quasars per sq.deg. second, a selection based on variability in multi-epoch imaging from thepalomar transient factory should recover an additional ~3-4 z &gt; 2.1 quasars persq. deg. to g &lt; 22.5. a linear model of how imaging systematics affect targetdensity recovers the angular distribution of eboss core quasars over 96.7%(76.7%) of the sdss north (south) galactic cap area. the eboss core quasarsample should thus be sufficiently dense and homogeneous over 0.9 &lt; z &lt; 2.2 toyield the first few-percent-level bao constraint near z~1.5. eboss quasars at z&gt; 2.1 will be used to improve bao measurements in the lyman-alpha forest.beyond its key cosmological goals, eboss should be the next-generation quasarsurvey, comprising &gt; 500,000 new quasars and &gt; 500,000 uniformly selectedspectroscopically confirmed 0.9 &lt; z &lt; 2.2 quasars. at the conclusion of eboss,the sdss will have provided unique spectra of over 800,000 quasars.

astro-ph;0409484	qso lensing magnification associated with galaxy groups	we simulated both the matter and light (galaxy) distributions in a wedge ofthe universe and calculated the gravitational lensing magnification caused bythe mass along the line of sight of galaxies and galaxy groups identified insky surveys. a large volume redshift cone containing cold dark matter particlesmimics the expected cosmological matter distribution in a flat universe withlow matter density and a cosmological constant. we generate a mock galaxycatalogue from the matter distribution and identify thousands of galaxy groupsin the luminous sky projection. we calculate the expected magnification aroundgalaxies and galaxy groups and then the induced qso-lens angular correlationdue to magnification bias. this correlation is an observable and can be used toestimate the average mass of the lens population and also make cosmologicalinferences. we also use analytic calculations and various analysis to comparethe observational results with theoretical expectations for thecross-correlation between faint qsos from the 2df survey and nearby galaxiesand groups from the apm and sdss edr. the observed qso-lens anti-correlationsare stronger than the predictions for the cosmological model used. thissuggests that there could be unknown systematic errors in the observations anddata reduction, or that the model used is not adequate. if the observed signalis assumed to be solely due to gravitational lensing then the lensing isstronger than expected, due to more massive galactic structures or moreefficient lensing than simulated.

astro-ph;0504510	detection of cosmic magnification with the sloan digital sky survey	we present an 8 sigma detection of cosmic magnification measured by thevariation of quasar density due to gravitational lensing by foreground largescale structure. to make this measurement we used 3800 square degrees ofphotometric observations from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) containing\~200,000 quasars and 13 million galaxies. our measurement of the galaxy-quasarcross-correlation function exhibits the amplitude, angular dependence andchange in sign as a function of the slope of the observed quasar number countsthat is expected from magnification bias due to weak gravitational lensing. weshow that observational uncertainties (stellar contamination, galactic dustextinction, seeing variations and errors in the photometric redshifts) are wellcontrolled and do not significantly affect the lensing signal. by weighting thequasars with the number count slope, we combine the cross-correlation ofquasars for our full magnitude range and detect the lensing signal at &gt;4 sigmain all five sdss filters. our measurements of cosmic magnification probe scalesranging from 60 kpc/h to 10 mpc/h and are in good agreement with theoreticalpredictions based on the wmap concordance cosmology. as with galaxy-galaxylensing, future measurements of cosmic magnification will provide usefulconstraints on the galaxy-mass power spectrum.

astro-ph;0612471	robust machine learning applied to astronomical datasets ii: quantifying  photometric redshifts for quasars using instance-based learning	we apply instance-based machine learning in the form of a k-nearest neighboralgorithm to the task of estimating photometric redshifts for 55,746 objectsspectroscopically classified as quasars in the fifth data release of the sloandigital sky survey. we compare the results obtained to those from an empiricalcolor-redshift relation (czr). in contrast to previously published resultsusing czrs, we find that the instance-based photometric redshifts are assignedwith no regions of catastrophic failure. remaining outliers are simplyscattered about the ideal relation, in a similar manner to the pattern seen inthe optical for normal galaxies at redshifts z &lt; ~1. the instance-basedalgorithm is trained on a representative sample of the data andpseudo-blind-tested on the remaining unseen data. the variance between thephotometric and spectroscopic redshifts is sigma^2 = 0.123 +/- 0.002 (comparedto sigma^2 = 0.265 +/- 0.006 for the czr), and 54.9 +/- 0.7%, 73.3 +/- 0.6%,and 80.7 +/- 0.3% of the objects are within delta z &lt; 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3respectively. we also match our sample to the second data release of the galaxyevolution explorer legacy data and the resulting 7,642 objects show a furtherimprovement, giving a variance of sigma^2 = 0.054 +/- 0.005, and 70.8 +/- 1.2%,85.8 +/- 1.0%, and 90.8 +/- 0.7% of objects within delta z &lt; 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3.we show that the improvement is indeed due to the extra information provided bygalex, by training on the same dataset using purely sdss photometry, which hasa variance of sigma^2 = 0.090 +/- 0.007. each set of results represents arealistic standard for application to further datasets for which the spectraare representative.

0809.3952	efficient photometric selection of quasars from the sloan digital sky  survey: ii. ~1,000,000 quasars from data release six	we present a catalog of 1,172,157 quasar candidates selected from thephotometric imaging data of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). the objectsare all point sources to a limiting magnitude of i=21.3 from 8417 sq. deg. ofimaging from sdss data release 6 (dr6). this sample extends our previouscatalog by using the latest sdss public release data and probing both uv-excessand high-redshift quasars. while the addition of high-redshift candidatesreduces the overall efficiency (quasars:quasar candidates) of the catalog to~80%, it is expected to contain no fewer than 850,000 bona fide quasars -- ~8times the number of our previous sample, and ~10 times the size of the largestspectroscopic quasar catalog. cross-matching between our photometric catalogand spectroscopic quasar catalogs from both the sdss and 2df surveys, yields88,879 spectroscopically confirmed quasars. for judicious selection of the mostrobust uv-excess sources (~500,000 objects in all), the efficiency is nearly97% -- more than sufficient for detailed statistical analyses. the catalog'scompleteness to type 1 (broad-line) quasars is expected to be no worse than70%, with most missing objects occurring at z&lt;0.7 and 2.5&lt;z&lt;3.0. in addition toclassification information, we provide photometric redshift estimates(typically good to delta z +/- 0.3 [2 sigma]) and cross-matching with radio,x-ray, and proper motion catalogs. finally, we consider the catalog's utilityfor determining the optical luminosity function of quasars and are able toconfirm the flattening of the bright-end slope of the quasar luminosityfunction at z~4 as compared to z~2.

0810.3567	eight-dimensional mid-infrared/optical bayesian quasar selection	we explore the multidimensional, multiwavelength selection of quasars frommid-ir (mir) plus optical data, specifically from spitzer-irac and the sloandigital sky survey (sdss). we apply modern statistical techniques to combinedspitzer mir and sdss optical data, allowing up to 8-d color selection ofquasars. using a bayesian selection method, we catalog 5546 quasar candidatesto an 8.0 um depth of 56 ujy over an area of ~24 sq. deg; ~70% of thesecandidates are not identified by applying the same bayesian algorithm to4-color sdss optical data alone. our selection recovers 97.7% of known type 1quasars in this area and greatly improves the effectiveness of identifying3.5&lt;z&lt;5 quasars. even using only the two shortest wavelength irac bandpasses,it is possible to use our bayesian techniques to select quasars with 97%completeness and as little as 10% contamination. this sample has a photometricredshift accuracy of 93.6% (delta z +/-0.3), remaining roughly constant whenthe two reddest mir bands are excluded. while our methods are designed to findtype 1 (unobscured) quasars, as many as 1200 of the objects are type 2(obscured) quasar candidates. coupling deep optical imaging data with deepmid-ir data could enable selection of quasars in significant numbers past thepeak of the quasar luminosity function (qlf) to at least z~4. such a samplewould constrain the shape of the qlf and enable quasar clustering studies overthe largest range of redshift and luminosity to date, yielding significantgains in our understanding of quasars and the evolution of galaxies.

0810.4955	the 2df-sdss lrg and qso survey: the spectroscopic qso catalogue	we present the final spectroscopic qso catalogue from the 2df-sdss lrg andqso (2slaq) survey. this is a deep, 18&lt;g&lt;21.85 (extinction corrected), sampleaimed at probing in detail the faint end of the broad line agn luminositydistribution at z&lt;2.6. the candidate qsos were selected from sdss photometryand observed spectroscopically with the 2df spectrograph on theanglo-australian telescope. this sample covers an area of 191.9 deg^2 andcontains new spectra of 16326 objects, of which 8764 are qsos, and 7623 arenewly discovered (the remainder were previously identified by the 2qz and sdsssurveys). the full qso sample (including objects previously observed in thesdss and 2qz surveys) contains 12702 qsos. the new 2slaq spectroscopic data setalso contains 2343 galactic stars, including 362 white dwarfs, and 2924 narrowemission line galaxies with a median redshift of z=0.22. we present detailedcompleteness estimates for the survey, based on modelling of qso colours,including host galaxy contributions. this calculation shows that at g~21.85 qsocolours are significantly affected by the presence of a host galaxy up toredshift z~1 in the sdss ugriz bands. in particular we see a significantreddening of the objects in g-i towards fainter g-band magnitudes. thisreddening is consistent with the qso host galaxies being dominated by a stellarpopulation of age at least 2-3 gyr. the full catalogue, including completenessestimates, is available on-line at http://www.2slaq.info/
