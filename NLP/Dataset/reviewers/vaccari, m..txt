0902.3369	mid-infrared spectroscopy of infrared-luminous galaxies at z~0.5-3	we present results on low-resolution mid-infrared (mir) spectra of 70infrared-luminous galaxies obtained with the infrared spectrograph (irs)onboard spitzer. we selected sources from the european large area infraredsurvey (elais) with s15 &gt; 0.8 mjy and photometric or spectroscopic z &gt; 1. abouthalf of the sample are qsos in the optical, while the remaining sources aregalaxies, comprising both obscured agn and starbursts. we classify the spectrausing well-known infrared diagnostics, as well as a new one that we propose,into three types of source: those dominated by an unobscured agn (qsos),obscured agn, and starburst-dominated sources. starbursts concentrate at z ~0.6-1.0 favored by the shift of the 7.7-micron pah band into the selection 15micron band, while agn spread over the 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.1 range. star formationrates (sfr) are estimated for individual sources from the luminosity of the pahfeatures. an estimate of the average pah luminosity in qsos and obscured agn isobtained from the composite spectrum of all sources with reliable redshifts.the estimated mean sfr in the qsos is 50-100 mo yr^-1, but the implied firluminosity is 3-10 times lower than that obtained from stacking analysis of thefir photometry, suggesting destruction of the pah carriers by energetic photonsfrom the agn. the sfr estimated in obscured agn is 2-3 times higher than inqsos of similar mir luminosity. this discrepancy might not be due to luminosityeffects or selection bias alone, but could instead indicate a connectionbetween obscuration and star formation. however, the observed correlationbetween silicate absorption and the slope of the near- to mid-infrared spectrumis compatible with the obscuration of the agn emission in these sources beingproduced in a dust torus.

0906.4938	testing the starburst/agn connection with swire x-ray/70 micron sources	we explore the nature of x-ray sources with 70 micron counterparts selectedin the swire fields elais-n1, lockman hole and chandra deep field south, forwhich chandra x-ray data are available. a total of 28 x-ray/70 micron sourcesin the redshift interval 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.3 are selected. the x-ray luminosities and theshape of the x-ray spectra show that these sources are agn. modelling of theoptical to far-infrared spectral energy distribution indicates that most ofthem (27/28) have a strong starburst component (&gt;50 solar masses per year) thatdominates in the infrared. it is found that the x-ray and infrared luminositiesof the sample sources are broadly correlated, consistent with a link betweenagn activity and star-formation. contrary to the predictions of some models forthe co-evolution of agn and galaxies, the x-ray/70 micron sources in the sampleare not more obscured at x-ray wavelengths compared to the overall x-raypopulation. it is also found that the x-ray/70 micron sources have lowerspecific star-formation rates compared to the general 70 micron population,consistent with agn feedback moderating the star-formation in the hostgalaxies.

0909.5044	spectroscopic cosmological surveys in the far-ir	we show the feasibility of spectroscopic cosmological surveys with the safariinstrument onboard of spica. the work is done through simulations that make useof both empirical methods, i.e. the use of observed luminosity functions andtheoretical models for galaxy formation and evolution. the relations assumedbetween the line emission to trace agn and star formation activity have beenderived from the observations of local samples of galaxies. the resultsconverge to indicate the use of blind spectroscopy with the safari fts atvarious resolutions to study galaxy evolution from the local to the distant(z~3) universe. specifically, two different and independent galaxy evolutionmodels predict about 7-10 sources to be spectroscopically detected in more thanone line in a 2'x 2'safari field of view, down to the expected flux limits ofsafari, with about 20% of sources to be detected at z&gt;2. spica-safari will betherefore excellent at detecting high-z sources and at assessing in a directway their nature (e.g whether mainly agn or star formation powered) thanks toblind spectroscopy.

0910.5649	mid- and far-infrared luminosity functions and galaxy evolution from  multiwavelength spitzer observations up to z~2.5	[abridged]we exploit a large homogeneous dataset to derive a self-consistentpicture of ir emission based on the time-dependent 24, 15, 12 and 8micronmonochromatic and bolometric ir luminosity functions (lf) over the 0&lt;z&lt;2.5redshift range. our analysis is based on the combination of data from deepspitzer surveys in the vvds-swire and goods areas. to our limiting flux ofs(24)=400microjy our derived sample in vvds-swire includes 1494 sources, and666 and 904 sources brighter than s(24)=80microjy are catalogued in goods-s andgoods-n, respectively, for a total area of ~0.9 square degs. we obtain reliableoptical identifications and redshifts, providing us a rich and robust datasetfor our luminosity function determination. based on the multi-wavelengthinformation available, we constrain the lfs at 8, 12, 15 and 24micron. we alsoextrapolate total ir luminosities from our best-fit to the observed seds ofeach source, and use this to derive the bolometric lf and comoving volumeemissivity up to z~2.5. in the 0&lt;z&lt;1 interval, the bolometric ir luminositydensity evolves as (1+z)^3.8+/-0.4. although more uncertain at higher-z, ourresults show a flattening of the ir luminosity density at z&gt;1. the meanredshift of the peak in the source number density shifts with luminosity: thebrighest ir galaxies appear to be forming stars earlier in cosmic time (z&gt;1.5),while the less luminous ones keep doing it at more recent epochs (z~1 forl(ir)&lt;10^11l_sun). our results suggest a rapid increase of the galaxy ircomoving volume emissivity back to z~1 and a constant average emissivity atz&gt;1. we also seem to find a difference in the evolution rate of the sourcenumber densities as a function of luminosity, a downsizing evolutionary patternsimilar to that reported from other samples of cosmic sources.

1001.5136	the herschel reference survey	the herschel reference survey is a guaranteed time herschel key project andwill be a benchmark study of dust in the nearby universe. the survey willcomplement a number of other herschel key projects including large cosmologicalsurveys that trace dust in the distant universe. we will use herschel toproduce images of a statistically-complete sample of 323 galaxies at 250, 350and 500 micron. the sample is volume-limited, containing sources with distancesbetween 15 and 25 mpc and flux limits in the k-band to minimize the selectioneffects associated with dust and with young high-mass stars and to introduce aselection in stellar mass. the sample spans the whole range of morphologicaltypes (ellipticals to late-type spirals) and environments (from the field tothe centre of the virgo cluster) and as such will be useful for other purposesthan our own. we plan to use the survey to investigate (i) the dust content ofgalaxies as a function of hubble type, stellar mass and environment, (ii) theconnection between the dust content and composition and the other phases of theinterstellar medium and (iii) the origin and evolution of dust in galaxies. inthis paper, we describe the goals of the survey, the details of the sample andsome of the auxiliary observing programs that we have started to collectcomplementary data. we also use the available multi-frequency data to carry outan analysis of the statistical properties of the sample.

1003.0447	mid-infrared spectroscopy of candidate agn-dominated submillimeter  galaxies	spitzer spectroscopy has revealed that ~80% of submm galaxies (smgs) arestarburst (sb) dominated in the mid-infrared. here we focus on the remaining~20% that show signs of harboring powerful active galactic nuclei (agn). wehave obtained spitzer-irs spectroscopy of a sample of eight smgs which arecandidates for harboring powerful agn on the basis of irac color-selection(s8/s4.5&gt;2; i.e. likely power-law mid-infrared seds). smgs with an agndominating (&gt;50%) their mid-infrared emission could represent `missing link'sources in an evolutionary sequence involving a major merger. first of all, wedetect pah features in all of the smgs, indicating redshifts from 2.5-3.4,demonstrating the power of the mid-infrared to determine redshifts for theseoptically faint dusty galaxies. secondly, we see signs of both star-formation(from the pah features) and agn activity (from continuum emission) in oursample: 62% of the sample are agn-dominated in the mid-infrared with a medianagn content of 56%, compared with &lt;30% on average for typical smgs, revealingthat our irac color selection has successfully singled out sources withproportionately more agn emission than typical sb-dominated smgs. however, wefind that only about 10% of these agn dominate the bolometric emission of thesmg when the results are extrapolated to longer infrared wavelengths, implyingthat agn are not a significant power source to the smg population overall, evenwhen there is evidence in the mid-infrared for substantial agn activity. whenexisting samples of mid-infrared agn-dominated smgs are considered, we findthat s8/s4.5&gt;1.65 works well at selecting mid-infrared energetically dominantagn in smgs, implying a duty cycle of ~15% if all smgs go through a subsequentmid-infrared agn-dominated phase in the proposed evolutionary sequence.

0708.0845	the scuba half degree extragalactic survey (shades) -- v. submillimetre  properties of near-infrared--selected galaxies in the subaru/xmm--newton deep  field	we have studied the submillimetre (submm) properties of the following classesof near-infrared (nir)-selected massive galaxies at high redshifts:bzk-selected star-forming galaxies (bzks); distant red galaxies (drgs); andextremely red objects (eros). we used the scuba half degree extragalacticsurvey (shades), the largest uniform submm survey to date. partial overlap ofsirius/nir images and shades in sxdf has allowed us to identify 4 submm-brightnir-selected galaxies, which are detected in the mid-infrared, 24 micron, andthe radio, 1.4 ghz. we find that all of our submm-bright nir-selected galaxiessatisfy the bzk selection criteria, except for one galaxy whose b-z and z-kcolours are however close to the bzk colour boundary. two of the submm-brightnir-selected galaxies satisfy all of the selection criteria we considered, i.e.they belong to the bzk-drg-ero overlapping population, or `extremely red' bzks.although these extremely red bzks are rare (0.25 arcmin^{-2}), up to 20 % ofthis population could be submm galaxies. this fraction is significantly higherthan that found for other galaxy populations studied here. via a stackinganalysis, we have detected the 850 micron flux of submm-faint bzks and eros inour scuba maps. while the contribution of z~2 bzks to the submm background isabout 10--15 % and similar to that from eros typically at z~1, bzks have ahigher fraction (~30 %) of submm flux in resolved sources compared with erosand submm sources as a whole. from the sed fitting analysis for bothsubmm-bright and submm-faint bzks, we found no clear signature thatsubmm-bright bzks are experiencing a specifically luminous evolutionary phase,compared with submm-faint bzks. an alternative explanation might be thatsubmm-bright bzks are more massive than submm-faint ones.

1005.1072	the far-infrared/radio correlation as probed by herschel	we set out to determine the ratio, q(ir), of rest-frame 8-1000um flux, s(ir),to monochromatic radio flux, s(1.4ghz), for galaxies selected at far-ir andradio wavelengths, to search for signs that the ratio evolves with redshift,luminosity or dust temperature, and to identify any far-ir-bright outliers -useful laboratories for exploring why the far-ir/radio correlation is generallyso tight when the prevailing theory suggests variations are almost inevitable.we use flux-limited 250-um and 1.4-ghz samples, obtained in goods-n usingherschel (hermes; pep) and the vla. we determine bolometric ir output using tenbands spanning 24-1250um, exploiting data from pacs and spire, as well asspitzer, scuba, aztec and mambo. we also explore the properties of anl(ir)-matched sample, designed to reveal evolution of q(ir) with z, spanninglog l(ir) = 11-12 l(sun) and z=0-2, by stacking into the radio and far-irimages. for 1.4-ghz-selected galaxies, we see tentative evidence of a break inthe flux ratio, q(ir), at l(1.4ghz) ~ 10^22.7 w/hz, where agn are starting todominate the radio power density, and of weaker correlations with z and t(d).from our 250-um-selected sample we identify a small number of far-ir-brightoutliers, and see trends of q(ir) with l(1.4ghz), l(ir), t(d) and z, notingthat some of these are inter-related. for our l(ir)-matched sample, there is noevidence that q(ir) changes significantly as we move back into the epoch ofgalaxy formation: we find q(ir) goes as (1+z)^gamma, where gamma = -0.04 +/-0.03 at z=0-2; however, discounting the least reliable data at z&lt;0.5 we findgamma = -0.26 +/- 0.07, modest evolution which may be related to the radiobackground seen by arcade2, perhaps driven by &lt;10ujy radio activity amongstordinary star-forming galaxies at z&gt;1.

1005.1526	spire imaging of m82: cool dust in the wind and tidal streams	m82 is a unique representative of a whole class of galaxies, starbursts withsuperwinds, in the very nearby galaxy survey with herschel. in addition, itsinteraction with the m81 group has stripped a significant portion of itsinterstellar medium from its disk. spire maps now afford bettercharacterization of the far-infrared emission from cool dust outside the disk,and sketch a far more complete picture of its mass distribution and energeticsthan previously possible. they show emission coincident in projection with thestarburst wind and in a large halo, much more extended than the pah bandemission seen with spitzer. some complex substructures coincide with thebrightest pah filaments, and others with tidal streams seen in atomic hydrogen.we subtract the far-infrared emission of the starburst and underlying disk fromthe maps, and derive spatially-resolved far-infrared colors for the wind andhalo. we interpret the results in terms of dust mass, dust temperature, andglobal physical conditions. in particular, we examine variations in the dustphysical properties as a function of distance from the center and the windpolar axis, and conclude that more than two thirds of the extraplanar dust hasbeen removed by tidal interaction, and not entrained by the starburst wind.

1005.2187	the hermes spire submillimeter local luminosity function	local luminosity functions are fundamental benchmarks for high-redshiftgalaxy formation and evolution studies as well as for models describing theseprocesses. determining the local luminosity function in the submillimeter rangecan help to better constrain in particular the bolometric luminosity density inthe local universe, and herschel offers the first opportunity to do so in anunbiased way by imaging large sky areas at several submillimeter wavelengths.  we present the first herschel measurement of the submillimeter 0&lt;z&lt;0.2 localluminosity function and infrared bolometric (8-1000 $\mu$m) local luminositydensity based on spire data from the hermes herschel key program over 14.7deg^2.  flux measurements in the three spire channels at 250, 350 and 500 \mum arecombined with spitzer photometry and archival data. we fit the observedoptical-to-submillimeter spectral energy distribution of spire sources and usethe 1/v_{max} estimator to provide the first constraints on the monochromatic250, 350 and 500 \mum as well as on the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) localluminosity function based on herschel data.  we compare our results with modeling predictions and find a slightly moreabundant local submillimeter population than predicted by a number of models.our measurement of the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) local luminosityfunction suggests a flat slope at low luminosity, and the inferred localluminosity density, 1.31_-0.21^+0.24 x 10^8 lsun mpc^-3, is consistent with therange of values reported in recent literature.

1005.2192	hermes: far-infrared properties of known agn in the hermes fields	nuclear and starburst activity are known to often occur concomitantly.herschel-spire provides sampling of the fir seds of type 1 and type 2 agn,allowing for the separation between the hot dust (torus) and cold dust(starburst) emission. we study large samples of spectroscopically confirmedtype 1 and type 2 agn lying within the herschel multi-tiered extragalacticsurvey (hermes) fields observed during the science demonstration phase, aimingto understand their fir colour distributions and constrain their starburstcontributions. we find that one third of the spectroscopically confirmed agn inthe hermes fields have 5-sigma detections at 250um, in agreement with previous(sub)mm agn studies. their combined spitzer-mips and herschel-spire colours -specifically s(250)/s(70) vs. s(70)/s(24) - quite clearly separate them fromthe non-agn, star-forming galaxy population, as their 24-um flux is dominatedby the hot torus emission. however, their spire colours alone do not differfrom those of non-agn galaxies. sed fitting shows that all those agn need astarburst component to fully account for their fir emission. for objects at z &gt;2, we find a correlation between the infrared luminosity attributed to thestarburst component, l(sb), and the agn accretion luminosity, l(acc), withl(sb) propto l(acc)^0.35. type 2 agn detected at 250um show on average higherl(sb) than type 1 objects but their number is still too low to establishwhether this trend indicates stronger star-formation activity.

1005.2859	herschel unveils a puzzling uniformity of distant dusty galaxies	the herschel space observatory enables us to accurately measure thebolometric output of starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (agn) bydirectly sampling the peak of their far-infrared (ir) emission. here we examinewhether the spectral energy distribution (sed) and dust temperature of galaxieshave strongly evolved since z~2.5. we use herschel deep extragalactic surveysfrom 100 to 500um to compute total ir luminosities in galaxies down to thefaintest levels, using pacs and spire in the goods-north field (pep and hermeskey programs). we show that measurements in the spire bands can be used belowthe statistical confusion limit if information at higher spatial resolution isused to identify isolated galaxies whose flux is not boosted by brightneighbors. below z~1.5, mid-ir extrapolations are correct for star-forminggalaxies with a dispersion of only 40% (0.15dex), therefore similar to z~0galaxies. this narrow distribution is puzzling when considering the range ofphysical processes that could have affected the sed of these galaxies.extrapolations from only one of the 160um, 250um or 350um bands alone tend tooverestimate the total ir luminosity. this may be explained by the lack offar-ir constraints around and above ~150um (rest-frame) on local templates. wealso note that the dust temperature of luminous ir galaxies around z~1 ismildly colder by 10-15% than their local analogs and up to 20% for ulirgs atz~1.6. above z=1.5, distant galaxies are found to exhibit a substantiallylarger mid- over far-ir ratio, which could either result from stronger broademission lines or warm dust continuum heated by a hidden agn. two thirds of theagns identified in the field with a measured redshift exhibit the same behavioras purely star-forming galaxies. hence a large fraction of agns harbor starformation at very high sfr and in conditions similar to purely star-forminggalaxies.

1005.5123	the herschel-spire instrument and its in-flight performance	the spectral and photometric imaging receiver (spire), is the herschel spaceobservatory`s submillimetre camera and spectrometer. it contains a three-bandimaging photometer operating at 250, 350 and 500 microns, and an imagingfourier transform spectrometer (fts) which covers simultaneously its wholeoperating range of 194-671 microns (447-1550 ghz). the spire detectors arearrays of feedhorn-coupled bolometers cooled to 0.3 k. the photometer has afield of view of 4' x 8', observed simultaneously in the three spectral bands.its main operating mode is scan-mapping, whereby the field of view is scannedacross the sky to achieve full spatial sampling and to cover large areas ifdesired. the spectrometer has an approximately circular field of view with adiameter of 2.6'. the spectral resolution can be adjusted between 1.2 and 25ghz by changing the stroke length of the fts scan mirror. its main operatingmode involves a fixed telescope pointing with multiple scans of the fts mirrorto acquire spectral data. for extended source measurements, multiple positionoffsets are implemented by means of an internal beam steering mirror to achievethe desired spatial sampling and by rastering of the telescope pointing to mapareas larger than the field of view. the spire instrument consists of a coldfocal plane unit located inside the herschel cryostat and warm electronicsunits, located on the spacecraft service module, for instrument control anddata handling. science data are transmitted to earth with no on-board datacompression, and processed by automatic pipelines to produce calibrated scienceproducts. the in-flight performance of the instrument matches or exceedspredictions based on pre-launch testing and modelling: the photometersensitivity is comparable to or slightly better than estimated pre-launch, andthe spectrometer sensitivity is also better by a factor of 1.5-2.

1007.1857	measures of star formation rates from infrared (herschel) and uv (galex)  emissions of galaxies in the hermes fields	the reliability of infrared (ir) and ultraviolet (uv) emissions to measurestar formation rates in galaxies is investigated for a large sample of galaxiesobserved with the spire and pacs instruments on herschel as part of the hermesproject. we build flux-limited 250 micron samples of sources at redshift z&lt;1,cross-matched with the spitzer/mips and galex catalogues. about 60 % of theherschel sources are detected in uv. the total ir luminosities, l_ir, of thesources are estimated using a sed-fitting code that fits to fluxes between 24and 500 micron. dust attenuation is discussed on the basis of commonly-useddiagnostics: the l_ir/l_uv ratio and the slope, beta, of the uv continuum. amean dust attenuation a_uv of ~ 3 mag is measured in the samples. l_ir/l_uv isfound to correlate with l_ir. galaxies with l_ir &gt; 10 ^{11} l_sun and 0.5&lt; z&lt;1exhibit a mean dust attenuation a_uv about 0.7 mag lower than that found fortheir local counterparts, although with a large dispersion. our galaxy samplesspan a large range of beta and l_ir/l_uv values which, for the most part, aredistributed between the ranges defined by the relations found locally forstarburst and normal star-forming galaxies. as a consequence the recipecommonly applied to local starbursts is found to overestimate the dustattenuation correction in our galaxy sample by a factor ~2-3 .

1009.1058	evolution of dust temperature of galaxies through cosmic time as seen by  herschel	we study the dust properties of galaxies in the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;2.8observed by the herschel space observatory in the field of the greatobservatories origins deep survey-north as part of pep and hermes keyprogrammes. infrared (ir) luminosity (l_ir) and dust temperature (t_dust) ofgalaxies are derived from the spectral energy distribution (sed) fit of thefar-infrared (fir) flux densities obtained with pacs and spire instrumentsonboard herschel. as a reference sample, we also obtain ir luminosities anddust temperatures of local galaxies at z&lt;0.1 using akari and iras data in thefield of the sloan digital sky survey. we compare the l_ir-t_dust relationbetween the two samples and find that: the median t_dust of herschel-selectedgalaxies at z&gt;0.5 with l_ir&gt;5x10^{10} l_\odot, appears to be 2-5 k colder thanthat of akari-selected local galaxies with similar luminosities; and thedispersion in t_dust for high-z galaxies increases with l_ir due to theexistence of cold galaxies that are not seen among local galaxies. we show thatthis large dispersion of the l_ir-t_dust relation can bridge the gap betweenlocal star-forming galaxies and high-z submillimeter galaxies (smgs). we alsofind that three smgs with very low t_dust (&lt;20 k) covered in this study haveclose neighbouring sources with similar 24-\mum brightness, which could lead toan overestimation of fir/(sub)millimeter fluxes of the smgs.

1009.3001	herschel-spire, far-infrared properties of millimetre-bright and -faint  radio galaxies	(abridged) we present the first study of the farir properties of highredshift, radio-selected ulirgs using deep observations obtained with spirefrom the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes). these galaxiesspan a large range of 850um fluxes from submillimetre-luminous ~10mjy "scubagalaxies -- smgs" to ~1.5mjy from stacked scuba non-detections, thus likelyrepresenting a complete distribution of ulirg spectral energy distributions.from keck spectroscopic surveys in the lockman-north field we identified asample of 31 smgs and 37 submillimetre-faint, optically-faint radio galaxies(ofrgs), all with radio-inferred ir luminosities &gt;10^12 lsun. these galaxieswere cross-identified with spire 250, 350 and 500um catalogs based on fluxesextracted at 24um positions in the swire survey, yielding a sample of more thanhalf of the galaxies well detected in at least two of the spire bandpasses. byfitting greybody dust models to the spire photometry together with scuba 850ummeasurements, we infer dust temperatures and far-infrared luminosities. theofrgs detected by spire have median &lt;t_d&gt;= 41+-5 k and the smgs have &lt;t_d&gt;=34+-5 k, both in reasonable agreement with previous (pre-herschel) estimates,reaffirming that the local fir/radio correlation holds (at least for thissubset of high-z ulirgs) at high redshift. our observations firstly confirmthat a substantial fraction of ofrgs exhibit large infrared luminositiescorresponding to sfrs of ~400 msun/yr. the spire observations secondly confirmthe higher dust temperatures for these ofrgs than similarly selected smgs,consistent with early predictions of the submm-faint radio populations. ourobservations also clearly confirm the large infrared luminosities of most smgsselected with s850um&gt;5 mjy and radio and strong 24um detections, correspondingto sfrs of ~700 msun/yr.

1009.3279	the jcmt nearby galaxies legacy survey iv. velocity dispersions in the  molecular interstellar medium in spiral galaxies	an analysis of large-area co j=3-2 maps from the james clerk maxwelltelescope for 12 nearby spiral galaxies reveals low velocity dispersions in themolecular component of the interstellar medium. the three lowest luminositygalaxies show a relatively flat velocity dispersion as a function of radiuswhile the remaining nine galaxies show a central peak with a radial fall-offwithin 0.2-0.4 r(25). correcting for the average contribution due to theinternal velocitydispersions of a population of giant molecular clouds, theaverage cloud-cloud velocity dispersion across the galactic disks is 6.1 +/-1.0 km/s (standard deviation 2.9 km/s), in reasonable agreement with previousmeasurements for the galaxy andm33. the cloud-cloud velocity dispersion derivedfrom the co data is on average two times smaller than the hi velocitydispersion measured in the same galaxies. the low cloud-cloudvelocitydispersion implies that the molecular gas is the critical component determiningthe stability of the galactic disk against gravitational collapse, especiallyin those regions of the disk which are h2 dominated. the cloud-cloud velocitydispersion shows a significant positivecorrelation with both the far-infraredluminosity, which traces the star formation activity, and the k-band absolutemagnitude, which traces the total stellar mass. for three galaxies in the virgocluster, smoothing the data to a resolution of 4.5 kpc (to match the typicalresolution of high redshift co observations) increases the measured velocitydispersion by roughly a factor of two, comparable to the dispersion measuredrecently in a normal galaxy at z=1. this comparison suggests that the mass andstar formation rate surface densities may be similar in galaxies from z=0-1 andthat the high star formation rates seen at z=1 may be partly due to thepresence of physically larger molecular gas disks.

1009.5675	hermes: deep galaxy number counts from a p(d) fluctuation analysis of  spire science demonstration phase observations	dusty, star forming galaxies contribute to a bright, currently unresolvedcosmic far-infrared background. deep herschel-spire images designed to detectand characterize the galaxies that comprise this background are highlyconfused, such that the bulk lies below the classical confusion limit. weanalyze three fields from the hermes programme in all three spire bands (250,350, and 500 microns); parameterized galaxy number count models are derived toa depth of ~2 mjy/beam, approximately 4 times the depth of previous analyses atthese wavelengths, using a p(d) (probability of deflection) approach forcomparison to theoretical number count models. our fits account for 64, 60, and43 per cent of the far-infrared background in the three bands. the numbercounts are consistent with those based on individually detected spire sources,but generally inconsistent with most galaxy number counts models, whichgenerically overpredict the number of bright galaxies and are not as steep asthe p(d)-derived number counts. clear evidence is found for a break in theslope of the differential number counts at low flux densities. systematiceffects in the p(d) analysis are explored. we find that the effects ofclustering have a small impact on the data, and the largest identifiedsystematic error arises from uncertainties in the spire beam.

1010.4770	on the origin of m81 group extended dust emission	galactic cirrus emission at far-infrared wavelengths affects manyextragalactic observations. separating this emission from that associated withextragalactic objects is both important and difficult. in this paper we discussa particular case, the m81 group, and the identification of diffuse structuresprominent in the infrared, but also detected at optical wavelengths. the originof these structures has previously been controversial, ranging from them beingthe result of a past interaction between m81 and m82 or due to more localgalactic emission. we show that over of order a few arcminute scales thefar-infrared (herschel 250 &amp;\mu&amp;m) emission correlates spatially very well witha particular narrow velocity (2-3 km/s) component of the galactic hi. we findno evidence that any of the far-infrared emission associated with thesefeatures actually originates in the m81 group. thus we infer that theassociated diffuse optical emission must be due to galactic light backscattered off dust in our galaxy. ultra-violet observations pick out youngstellar associations around m81, but no detectable far-infrared emission. weconsider in detail one of the galactic cirrus features, finding that thefar-infrared hi relation breaks down below arc minute scales and that atsmaller scales there can be quite large dust temperature variations.

1101.1080	sub-millimetre galaxies reside in dark matter halos with masses greater  than 3x10^11 solar masses	the extragalactic background light at far-infrared wavelengths originatesfrom optically-faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies in the universe withstar-formation rates at the level of a few hundred solar masses per year. dueto the relatively poor spatial resolution of far-infrared telescopes, the faintsub-millimetre galaxies are challenging to study individually. instead, theiraverage properties can be studied using statistics such as the angular powerspectrum of the background intensity variations. a previous attempt atmeasuring this power spectrum resulted in the suggestion that the clusteringamplitude is below the level computed with a simple ansatz based on a halomodel. here we report a clear detection of the excess clustering over thelinear prediction at arcminute angular scales in the power spectrum ofbrightness fluctuations at 250, 350, and 500 microns. from this excess, we findthat sub-millimetre galaxies are located in dark matter halos with a minimummass of log[m_min/m_sun ]= 11.5^+0.7_-0.2 at 350 microns. this minimum darkmatter halo mass corresponds to the most efficient mass scale for starformation in the universe, and is lower than that predicted by semi-analyticalmodels for galaxy formation.

1101.4796	hermes: detection of cosmic magnification of sub-mm galaxies using  angular cross-correlation	cosmic magnification is due to the weak gravitational lensing of sources inthe distant universe by foreground large-scale structure leading to coherentchanges in the observed number density of the background sources. depending onthe slope of the background source number counts, cosmic magnification causes acorrelation between the background and foreground galaxies, which is unexpectedin the absence of lensing if the two populations are spatially disjoint.previous attempts using submillimetre (sub-mm) sources have been hampered bysmall number statistics. the large number of sources detected in the {\itherschel} multi-tiered extra-galactic survey (hermes) lockman-swire fieldenables us to carry out the first robust study of the cross-correlation betweensub-mm sources and sources at lower redshifts. using ancillary data we compiletwo low-redshift samples from sdss and swire with &lt;z&gt; ~ 0.2 and 0.4,respectively, and cross-correlate with two sub-mm samples based on flux densityand colour criteria, selecting galaxies preferentially at z ~ 2. we detectcross-correlation on angular scales between ~1 and 50 arcmin and find clearevidence that this is primarily due to cosmic magnification. a small, butnon-negligible signal from intrinsic clustering is likely to be present due tothe tails of the redshift distribution of the sub-mm sources overlapping withthose of the foreground samples.

1104.4113	discovery of a multiply-lensed submillimeter galaxy in early hermes  herschel/spire data	we report the discovery of a bright ($f(250\mum) &gt; 400$ mjy), multiply-lensedsubmillimeter galaxy \obj\ in {\it  herschel}/spire science demonstration phase data from the hermes project.interferometric 880\mum\ submillimeter array observations resolve at least fourimages with a large separation of $\sim 9\arcsec$. a high-resolution adaptiveoptics $k_p$ image with keck/nirc2 clearly shows strong lensing arcs. follow-upspectroscopy gives a redshift of $z=2.9575$, and the lensing model gives atotal magnification of $\mu \sim 11 \pm 1$. the large image separation allowsus to study the multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution (sed) of thelensed source unobscured by the central lensing mass. thefar-ir/millimeter-wave sed is well described by a modified blackbody fit withan unusually warm dust temperature, $88 \pm 3$ k. we derive a lensing-correctedtotal ir luminosity of $(1.43 \pm 0.09) \times 10^{13}\, \mathrm{l}_{\odot}$,implying a star formation rate of $\sim 2500\, \mathrm{m}_{\odot}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. however, models primarily developed from brighter galaxiesselected at longer wavelengths are a poor fit to the full optical-to-millimetersed. a number of other strongly lensed systems have already been discovered inearly {\it herschel} data, and many more are expected as additional data arecollected.

1104.4115	redshift determination and co line excitation modeling for the  multiply-lensed galaxy hlsw-01	we report on the redshift measurement and co line excitation of hermesj105751.1+573027 (hlsw-01), a strongly lensed submillimeter galaxy discoveredin herschel/spire observations as part of the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey (hermes). hlsw-01 is an ultra-luminous galaxy with anintrinsic far-infrared luminosity of 1.4x10^(13) solar luminosities, and islensed by a massive group of galaxies into at least four images with a totalmagnification of 10.9+/-0.7. with the 100 ghz instantaneous bandwidth of thez-spec instrument on the caltech submillimeter observatory, we robustlyidentify a redshift of z=2.958+/-0.007 for this source, using the simultaneousdetection of four co emission lines (j = 7-6, j = 8-7, j = 9-8, and j = 10-9).combining the measured line fluxes for these high-j transitions with the j =1-0, j = 3-2 and j = 5-4 line fluxes measured with the green bank telescope,the combined array for research in millimeter astronomy, and the plateau debure interferometer, respectively, we model the physical properties of themolecular gas in this galaxy. we find that the full co spectral line energydistribution is well described by warm, moderate-density gas with tkin = 86-235k and n(h2) = (1.1-3.5)x10^3 cm^(-3). however, it is possible that thehighest-j transitions are tracing a small fraction of very dense gas inmolecular cloud cores, and two-component models that include a warm/densemolecular gas phase with tkin ~ 200 k, n(h2) ~ 10^5 cm^(-3) are also consistentwith these data. higher signal-to-noise measurements of the j(upper) &gt; 7transitions with high spectral resolution, combined with high spatialresolution co maps, are needed to improve our understanding of the gasexcitation, morphology, and dynamics of this interesting high-redshift galaxy.

1104.4116	dynamical structure of the molecular interstellar medium in an extremely  bright, multiply lensed z~3 submillimeter galaxy discovered with herschel	we report the detection of co 5-4, 3-2, and 1-0 emission in the stronglylensed, herschel/spire-selected submillimeter galaxy (smg) hlsw-01 atz=2.9574+/-0.0001, using the plateau de bure interferometer, the combined arrayfor research in millimeter-wave astronomy, and the green bank telescope. theobservations spatially resolve the molecular gas into four lensed images with amaximum separation of ~9", and reveal the internal gas dynamics in this system.we derive lensing-corrected co line luminosities of l'(co 1-0) = (4.17+/-0.41),l'(co 3-2) = (3.96+/-0.20) and l'(co 5-4) = (3.45+/-0.20) x 10^10(mu_l/10.9)^-1 kkm/s pc^2, corresponding to luminosity ratios of r_31 =0.95+/-0.10, r_53 = 0.87+/-0.06, and r_51 = 0.83+/-0.09. this suggests a totalmolecular gas mass of mgas = 3.3 x 10^10 (alpha_co/0.8) (mu_l/10.9)^-1 msun.the gas mass, gas mass fraction, gas depletion timescale, star formationefficiency, and specific star formation rate are typical for an smg. thevelocity structure of the gas reservoir suggests that the brightest two lensedimages are dynamically resolved projections of the same dust-obscured region inthe galaxy that are kinematically offset from the unresolved fainter images.the resolved kinematics appear consistent with the complex velocity structureobserved in major, `wet' (i.e., gas-rich) mergers. major mergers are commonlyobserved in smgs, and are likely to be responsible for fueling their intensestarbursts at high gas consumption rates. this study demonstrates the level ofdetail to which galaxies in the early universe can be studied by utilizing theincrease in effective spatial resolution and sensitivity provided bygravitational lensing.

1104.4119	modeling of the hermes j105751.1+573027 submillimeter source lensed by a  dark matter dominated foreground group of galaxies	we present the results of a gravitational lensing analysis of the bright$\zs=2.957$ sub-millimeter galaxy (smg), hermes j105751.1+573027 found in {\itherschel}/spire science demonstration phase data from the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey (hermes) project. the high resolution imaging available inoptical and near-ir channels, along with co emission obtained with the plateaude bure interferometer, allow us to precisely estimate the intrinsic sourceextension and hence estimate the total lensing magnification to be $\mu=10.9\pm0.7$. we measure the half-light radius $r_{\rm eff}$ of the source in therest-frame near-uv and $v$ bands that characterize the unobscured light comingfrom stars and find $r_{\rm eff,*}= [2.0 \pm 0.1]$ kpc, in good agreement withrecent studies on the submillimeter galaxy population. this lens model is alsoused to estimate the size of the gas distribution ($r_{\rm eff,gas}=[1.1\pm0.5]$) kpc by mapping back in the source plane the co (j=5-4) transitionline emission. the lens modeling yields a relatively large einstein radius$r_{\rm ein}= 4\farcs10 \pm 0\farcs02$, corresponding to a deflector velocitydispersion of [$483\pm 16] \,\kms$. this shows that hermes j105751.1+573027 islensed by a {\it galaxy group-size} dark matter halo at redshift $\zl\sim 0.6$.the projected dark matter contribution largely dominates the mass budget withinthe einstein radius with $f_{\rm dm}(&lt;r_{\rm ein})\sim 80%$. this fractionreduces to $f_{\rm dm}(&lt;r_{\rm eff,g1}\simeq 4.5\kpc)\sim 47%$ within theeffective radius of the main deflecting galaxy of stellar mass $m_{\rm*,g1}=[8.5\pm 1.6] \times 10^{11}\msun$. at this smaller scale the dark matterfraction is consistent with results already found for massive lensingellipticals at $z\sim0.2$ from the slacs survey.

1109.5186	hermes: point source catalogues from deep herschel-spire observations	we describe the generation of single-band point source catalogues fromsubmillimetre herschel-spire observations taken as part of the sciencedemonstration phase of the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes).flux densities are found by means of peak-finding and the fitting of a gaussianpoint-response function. with highly-confused images, careful checks must bemade on the completeness and flux density accuracy of the detected sources.this is done by injecting artificial sources into the images and analysing theresulting catalogues. measured flux densities at which 50 per cent of injectedsources result in good detections at (250, 350, 500) {\mu}m range from (11.6,13.2, 13.1) mjy to (25.7, 27.1, 35.8) mjy, depending on the depth of theobservation (where a `good' detection is taken to be one with positional offsetless than one full-width half-maximum of the point-response function, and withthe measured flux density within a factor of 2 of the flux density of theinjected source). this paper acts as a reference for the 2010 july hermespublic data release.

1110.0960	photometry and photometric redshift catalogs for the lockman hole deep  field	we present broad band photometry and photometric redshifts for 187611 sourceslocated in ~0.5deg^2 in the lockman hole area. the catalog includes 389 x-raydetected sources identified with the very deep xmm-newton observationsavailable for an area of 0.2 deg^2. the source detection was performed on therc, z' and b band images and the available photometry is spanning from the farultraviolet to the mid infrared, reaching in the best case scenario 21 bands.astrometry corrections and photometric cross-calibrations over the entiredataset allowed the computation of accurate photometric redshifts. specialtreatment is undertaken for the x-ray sources, the majority of which is activegalactic nuclei. comparing the photometric redshifts to the availablespectroscopic redshifts we achieve for normal galaxies an accuracy of\sigma_{\delta z/(1+z)}=0.036, with 12.7% outliers, while for the x-raydetected sources the accuracy is \sigma_{\delta z/(1+z)}=0.069, with 18.3%outliers, where the outliers are defined as sources with|z_{phot}-z_{spec}|&gt;0.15 (1+z_{spec})}. these results are a significantimprovement over the previously available photometric redshifts for normalgalaxies in the lockman hole, while it is the first time that photometricredshifts are computed and made public for agn for this field.

1112.3348	the herschel exploitation of local galaxy andromeda (helga). i: global  far-infrared and sub-mm morphology	we have obtained herschel images at five wavelengths from 100 to 500 micronof a ~5.5x2.5 degree area centred on the local galaxy m31 (andromeda), ournearest neighbour spiral galaxy, as part of the herschel guaranteed timeproject "helga". the main goals of helga are to study the characteristics ofthe extended dust emission, focusing on larger scales than studied in previousobservations of andromeda at an increased spatial resolution, and the obscuredstar formation. in this paper we present data reduction and herschel maps, andprovide a description of the far-infrared morphology, comparing it withfeatures seen at other wavelengths. we use high--resolution maps of the atomichydrogen, fully covering our fields, to identify dust emission features thatcan be associated to m31 with confidence, distinguishing them from emissioncoming from the foreground galactic cirrus. thanks to the very large extensionof our maps we detect, for the first time at far-infrared wavelengths, threearc-like structures extending out to ~21, ~26 and ~31 kpc respectively, in thesouth-western part of m31. the presence of these features, hosting ~2.2e6 msolof dust, is safely confirmed by their detection in hi maps. overall, weestimate a total dust mass of ~5.8e7 msol, about 78% of which is contained inthe two main ring-like structures at 10 and 15 kpc, at an average temperatureof 16.5 k. we find that the gas-to-dust ratio declines exponentially as afunction of the galacto-centric distance, in agreement with the knownmetallicity gradient, with values ranging from 66 in the nucleus to ~275 in theoutermost region.

1203.0063	hermes: a statistical measurement of the redshift distribution of  herschel-spire sources using the cross-correlation technique	the wide-area imaging surveys with the {\it herschel} space observatory atsub-mm wavelengths have now resulted in catalogs of order one hundred thousanddusty, star-burst galaxies. we make a statistical estimate of $n(z)$ using aclustering analysis of sub-mm galaxies detected at each of 250, 350 and 500$\mu$m from the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes) centered onthe bo\"{o}tes field. we cross-correlate {\it herschel} galaxies against galaxysamples at optical and near-ir wavelengths from the sloan digital sky survey(sdss), the noao deep wide field survey (ndwfs) and the spitzer deep wide fieldsurvey (sdwfs). we create optical and near-ir galaxy samples based on theirphotometric or spectroscopic redshift distributions and test the accuracy ofthose redshift distributions with similar galaxy samples defined with catalogsof the cosmological evolution survey (cosmos), as the cosmos field has superiorspectroscopy coverage. we model-fit the clustering auto and cross-correlationsof {\it herschel} and optical/ir galaxy samples to estimate $n(z)$ andclustering bias factors. the $s_{350} &gt; 20$ mjy galaxies have a bias factorvarying with redshift as $b(z)=1.0^{+1.0}_{-0.5}(1+z)^{1.2^{+0.3}_{-0.7}}$.this bias and the redshift dependence is broadly in agreement with galaxiesthat occupy dark matter halos of mass in the range of 10$^{12}$ to 10$^{13}$m$_{\sun}$. we find that the redshift distribution peaks around $z \sim 0.5$ to1 for galaxies selected at 250 $\mu$m with an average redshift of $&lt; z &gt; = 1.8\pm 0.2$. for 350 and 500 $\mu$m-selected spire samples the peak shifts tohigher redshift, but the average redshift remains the same with a value of $1.9\pm 0.2$.

1203.2562	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey: hermes	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey, hermes, is a legacy programdesigned to map a set of nested fields totalling ~380 deg^2. fields range insize from 0.01 to ~20 deg^2, using herschel-spire (at 250, 350 and 500 \mu m),and herschel-pacs (at 100 and 160 \mu m), with an additional wider component of270 deg^2 with spire alone. these bands cover the peak of the redshiftedthermal spectral energy distribution from interstellar dust and thus capturethe re-processed optical and ultra-violet radiation from star formation thathas been absorbed by dust, and are critical for forming a completemulti-wavelength understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.  the survey will detect of order 100,000 galaxies at 5\sigma in some of thebest studied fields in the sky. additionally, hermes is closely coordinatedwith the pacs evolutionary probe survey. making maximum use of the fullspectrum of ancillary data, from radio to x-ray wavelengths, it is designed to:facilitate redshift determination; rapidly identify unusual objects; andunderstand the relationships between thermal emission from dust and otherprocesses. scientific questions hermes will be used to answer include: thetotal infrared emission of galaxies; the evolution of the luminosity function;the clustering properties of dusty galaxies; and the properties of populationsof galaxies which lie below the confusion limit through lensing and statisticaltechniques.  this paper defines the survey observations and data products, outlines theprimary scientific goals of the hermes team, and reviews some of the earlyresults.

1204.1152	the agn content in luminous ir galaxies at z\sim2 from a global sed  analysis including herschel data	we use herschel-pacs far-infrared data, combined with previous multi-bandinformation and mid-ir spectra, to properly account for the presence of anactive nucleus and constrain its energetic contribution in luminous infrared(ir) sources at z\sim2. the sample is composed of 24 sources in the goods-southfield, with typical ir luminosity of 10^{12} lo. data from the 4 ms chandrax-ray imaging in this field are also used to identify and characterize agnemission. we reproduce the observed spectral energy distribution (sed),decomposed into a host-galaxy and an agn component. a smooth-torus model forcircum-nuclear dust is used to account for the direct and re-processedcontribution from the agn. we confirm that galaxies with typicall_{8-1000um}\sim10^{12}lo at z\sim2 are powered predominantly bystar-formation. an agn component is present in nine objects (\sim35% of thesample) at the 3sigma confidence level, but its contribution to the 8-1000 umemission accounts for only \sim5% of the energy budget. the agn contributionrises to \sim23% over the 5-30 um range (in agreement with spitzer irs results)and to \sim60% over the narrow 2-6 um range. the presence of an agn isconfirmed by x-ray data for 3 (out of nine) sources, with x-ray spectralanalysis indicating the presence of significant absorption, i.e.nh\sim10^{23}-10^{24} cm^{-2}. an additional source shows indications ofobscured agn emission from x-ray data. the comparison between themid-ir--derived x-ray luminosities and those obtained from x-ray data suggeststhat obscuration is likely present also in the remaining six sources thatharbour an agn according to the sed-fitting analysis.

0711.0843	clustering of galaxies at 3.6 microns in the spitzer wide-area infrared  extragalactic legacy survey	we investigate the clustering of galaxies selected in the 3.6 micron band ofthe spitzer wide-area infrared extragalactic (swire) legacy survey. the angulartwo-point correlation function is calculated for eleven samples with fluxlimits of s_3.6 &gt; 4-400 mujy, over an 8 square degree field. the angularclustering strength is measured at &gt;5-sigma significance at all flux limits,with amplitudes of a=(0.49-29)\times10^{-3} at one degree, for a power-lawmodel, a\theta^{-0.8}. we estimate the redshift distributions of the samplesusing phenomological models, simulations and photometric redshifts, and soderive the spatial correlation lengths. we compare our results with the galics(galaxies in cosmological simulations) models of galaxy evolution and withparameterized models of clustering evolution. the galics simulations areconsistent with our angular correlation functions, but fail to match thespatial clustering inferred from the phenomological models or the photometricredshifts. we find that the uncertainties in the redshift distributions of oursamples dominate the statistical errors in our estimates of the spatialclustering. at low redshifts (median z&lt;0.5) the comoving correlation length isapproximately constant, r_0=6.1\pm0.5h^{-1} mpc, and then decreases withincreasing redshift to a value of 2.9\pm0.3h^{-1} mpc for the faintest sample,for which the median redshift is z=1. we suggest that this trend can beattributed to a decrease in the average galaxy and halo mass in the fainterflux-limited samples, corresponding to changes in the relative numbers ofearly- and late-type galaxies. however, we cannot rule out strong evolution ofthe correlation length over 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.

1205.2045	clustering of star-forming galaxies detected in mid-infrared with the  spitzer wide-area survey	we discuss the clustering properties of galaxies with signs of ongoing starformation detected by the spitzer space telescope at 24mum band in the swirelockman hole field. the sample of mid-ir-selected galaxies includes ~20,000objects detected above a flux threshold of s24mum=310mujy. we adoptoptical/near-ir color selection criteria to split the sample into thelower-redshift and higher-redshift galaxy populations. we measure the angularcorrelation function on scales of theta=0.01-3.5 deg, from which, using thelimber inversion along with the redshift distribution established for similarlyselected source populations in the goods fields (rodighiero et al. 2010), weobtain comoving correlation lengths of r0=4.98+-0.28 h^-1 mpc and r0=8.04+-0.69 h^-1 mpc for the low-z (&lt;z&gt;=0.7) and high-z (&lt;z&gt;=1.7) subsamples,respectively. comparing these measurements with the correlation functions ofdark matter halos identified in the bolshoi cosmological simulation (klypin etal. 2011}, we find that the high-redshift objects reside in progressively moremassive halos reaching mtot&gt;3e12 h^-1 msun, compared to mtot&gt;7e11 h^-1 msun forthe low-redshift population. approximate estimates of the ir luminosities basedon the catalogs of 24mum sources in the goods fields show that our high-zsubsample represents a population of "distant ulirgs" with lir&gt;10^12lsun, whilethe low-z subsample mainly consists of "lirgs", lir~10^11lsun. the comparisonof number density of the 24mum selected galaxies and of dark matter halos withderived minimum mass mtot shows that only 20% of such halos may hoststar-forming galaxies.

1205.3778	hermes: candidate gravitationally lensed galaxies and lensing statistics  at submillimeter wavelengths	we present a list of 13 candidate gravitationally lensed submillimetergalaxies (smgs) from 95 square degrees of the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey, a surface density of 0.14\pm0.04deg^{-2}. the selectedsources have 500um flux densities (s_500) greater than 100mjy. gravitationallensing is confirmed by follow-up observations in 9 of the 13 systems (70%),and the lensing status of the four remaining sources is undetermined. we alsopresent a supplementary sample of 29 (0.31\pm0.06deg^{-2}) gravitationallylensed smg candidates with s_500=80--100mjy, which are expected to contain ahigher fraction of interlopers than the primary candidates. the number countsof the candidate lensed galaxies are consistent with a simple statistical modelof the lensing rate, which uses a foreground matter distribution, the intrinsicsmg number counts, and an assumed smg redshift distribution. the model predictsthat 32--74% of our s_500&gt;100mjy candidates are strongly gravitationally lensed(mu&gt;2), with the brightest sources being the most robust; this is consistentwith the observational data. our statistical model also predicts that, onaverage, lensed galaxies with s_500=100mjy are magnified by factors of ~9, withapparently brighter galaxies having progressively higher average magnification,due to the shape of the intrinsic number counts. 65% of the sources areexpected to have intrinsic 500micron flux densities less than 30mjy. thus,samples of strongly gravitationally lensed smgs, such as those presented here,probe below the nominal herschel detection limit at 500 micron. they are goodtargets for the detailed study of the physical conditions in distant dusty,star-forming galaxies, due to the lensing magnification, which can lead tospatial resolutions of ~0.01" in the source plane.

1205.5690	evolution of the far-infrared luminosity functions in the spitzer  wide-area infrared extragalactic legacy survey	we present new observational determination of the evolution of the rest-frame70 and 160 micron and total infrared (tir) galaxy luminosity functions (lfs)using 70 micron data from the spitzer wide-area infrared extragalactic legacysurvey (swire). the lfs were constructed for sources with spectroscopicredshifts only in the xmm-lss and lockman hole fields from the swirephotometric redshift catalogue. the 70 micron and tir lfs were constructed inthe redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;1.2 and the 160 micron lf was constructed in theredshift range 0&lt;z&lt;0.5 using a parametric bayesian and the vmax methods. weassume in our models, that the faint-end power-law index of the lf does notevolve with redshifts. we find the the double power-law model is a betterrepresentation of the ir lf than the more commonly used power-law and gaussianmodel. we model the evolution of the fir lfs as a function of redshift wherewhere the characteristic luminosity, $l^\ast$ evolve as$\propto(1+z)^{\alpha_\textsc{l}}$. the rest-frame 70 micron lf shows a strongluminosity evolution out to z=1.2 with alpha_l=3.41^{+0.18}_{-0.25}. therest-frame 160 micron lf also showed rapid luminosity evolution withalpha_l=5.53^{+0.28}_{-0.23} out to z=0.5. the rate of evolution in luminosityis consistent with values estimated from previous studies using data from iras,iso and spitzer. the tir lf evolves in luminosity withalpha_l=3.82^{+0.28}_{-0.16} which is in agreement with previous results fromspitzer 24 micron which find strong luminosity evolution. by integrating the lfwe calculated the co-moving ir luminosity density out to z=1.2, which confirmthe rapid evolution in number density of lirgs and ulirgs which contribute~68^{+10}_{-07} % to the co-moving star formation rate density at z=1.2. ourresults based on 70 micron data confirms that the bulk of the star formation atz=1 takes place in dust obscured objects.

1210.2362	cosmic evolution of star-formation enhancement in close major-merger  galaxy pairs since z = 1	the infrared (ir) emission of m_* galaxies (10^{10.4} &lt; m_{star} &lt; 10^{11.0}m_\sun) in galaxy pairs, derived using data obtained in herschel (pep/hermes)and spitzer (s-cosmos) surveys, is compared to that of single disk galaxies inwell matched control samples to study the cosmic evolution of thestar-formation enhancement induced by galaxy-galaxy interaction. both the meanir sed and mean ir luminosity of star-forming galaxies (sfgs) in sfg+sfg (s+s)pairs in the redshift bin of 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1 are consistent with no star-formationenhancement. sfgs in s+s pairs in a lower redshift bin of 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.6 showmarginal evidence for a weak star-formation enhancement. together with thesignificant and strong ssfr enhancement shown by sfgs in a local sample of s+spairs (obtained using previously published spitzer observations), our resultsreveal a trend for the star-formation enhancement in s+s pairs to decrease withincreasing redshift. between z=0 and z=1, this decline of interaction-inducedstar-formation enhancement occurs in parallel with the dramatic increase (by afactor of ~10) of the ssfr of single sfgs, both can be explained by the highergas fraction in higher z disks. sfgs in mixed pairs (s+e pairs) do not show anysignificant star-formation enhancement at any redshift. the difference betweensfgs in s+s pairs and in s+e pairs suggests a modulation of the ssfr by theinter-galactic medium igm in the dark matter halos (dmh) hosting these pairs.

1211.6116	the complex physics of dusty star-forming galaxies at high redshifts as  revealed by herschel and spitzer	we combine far-infrared photometry from herschel (pep/hermes) with deepmid-infrared spectroscopy from spitzer to investigate the nature and the massassembly history of a sample of 31 luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxiesat z~1 and 2 selected in goods-s with 24 $\mu$m fluxes between 0.2 and 0.5 mjy.we model the data with a self-consistent physical model (grasil) which includesa state-of-the-art treatment of dust extinction and reprocessing. we find thatall of our galaxies appear to require massive populations of old (&gt;1 gyr) starsand, at the same time, to host a moderate ongoing activity of sf (sfr &lt; 100m$_{\odot}$/yr). the bulk of the stars appear to have been formed a few gyrbefore the observation in essentially all cases. only five galaxies of thesample require a recent starburst superimposed on a quiescent star formationhistory (sfh). we also find discrepancies between our results and those basedon optical-only sed fitting for the same objects; by fitting their observedspectral energy distributions with our physical model we find higherextinctions (by $\delta$a_{v} ~ 0.81 and 1.14) and higher stellar masses (by$\delta$log(m*) ~ 0.16 and 0.36 dex) for z~1 and z~2 (u)lirgs, respectively.the stellar mass difference is larger for the most dust obscured objects. wealso find lower sfrs than those computed from l_{ir} using the kennicuttrelation due to the significant contribution to the dust heating byintermediate-age stellar populations through 'cirrus' emission (~73% and ~66%of total l_{ir} for z~1 and z~2 (u)lirgs, respectively).

1302.4895	the herschel census of infrared seds through cosmic time	using herschel data from the deepest spire and pacs surveys (hermes and pep)in cosmos and goods (n+s), we examine the dust properties of ir-luminous(l_ir&gt;10^10 l_sun) galaxies at 0.1&lt;z&lt;2 and determine how these evolve withcosmic time. the unique angle of this work is the rigorous analysis of surveyselection effects, making this the first study of the star-formation-dominated,ir-luminous population within a framework almost entirely free of selectionbiases. we find that ir-luminous galaxies have seds with broad far-ir peakscharacterised by cool/extended dust emission and average dust temperatures inthe 25-45k range. hot (t&gt;45k) seds and cold (t&lt;25k), cirrus-dominated seds arerare, with most sources being within the range occupied by warm starbursts suchas m82 and cool spirals such as m51. we observe a luminosity-temperature (l-t)relation, where the average dust temperature of log[l_ir/l_sun]=12.5 galaxiesis about 10k higher than that of their log[l_ir/l_sun]=10.5 counterparts.however, although the increased dust heating in more luminous systems is thedriving factor behind the l-t relation, the increase in dust mass and/orstarburst size with luminosity plays a dominant role in shaping it. our resultsshow that the dust conditions in ir-luminous sources evolve with cosmic time:at high redshift, dust temperatures are on average up to 10k lower than what ismeasured locally. this is manifested as a flattening of the l-t relation,suggesting that (u)lirgs in the early universe are typically characterised by amore extended dust distribution and/or higher dust masses than local equivalentsources. interestingly, the evolution in dust temperature is luminositydependent, with the fraction of lirgs with t&lt;35k showing a 2-fold increase fromz~0 to z~2, whereas that of ulirgs with t&lt;35k shows a 6-fold increase.

1304.4593	far-ir emission from dust-obscured galaxies	dust-obscured galaxies (dogs) are a uv-faint, ir-bright galaxy populationthat reside at z~2 and are believed to be in a phase of dusty star-forming andagn activity. we present far-ir observations of a complete sample of dogs inthe 2 deg2 of cosmos. the 3077 dogs have &lt;z&gt;=1.9+/-0.3 and are selected from24um and r+ observations using a color cut of r+ - [24]&gt;=7.5 (ab mag) ands24&gt;=100ujy. based on the near-ir seds, 47% are star-formation dominated and10% are agn-dominated. we use spire far-ir photometry from hermes to calculatethe ir luminosity and characteristic dust temperature for the 1572 (51%) dogsthat are detected at 250um (&gt;=3{\sigma}). for the remaining 1505 (49%) that areundetected, we perform a median stacking analysis to probe fainterluminosities. detected and undetected dogs have average ir luminosities of(2.8+/-0.4) x 1012 lsun and (0.77+-0.08)x10^12lsun, and dust temperatures of34+/-7 k and 37+/-3 k, respectively. the ir luminosity function of dogs withs24&gt;=100ujy is calculated, using far-ir observations and stacking. dogscontribute 10-30% to the total star formation rate density of the universe atz=1.5-2.5, dominated by 250um detected and bump dogs. for comparison, dogscontribute 30% to the star-formation rate density of the universe for allgalaxies at z=1.5-2.5 with s24&gt;=100ujy. dogs have a large scatter about thestar-formation main sequence and their specific star-formation rates show thatthe observed phase of star-formation could be responsible for their observedstellar mass at z~2.

1305.4930	the rapid assembly of an elliptical galaxy of 400 billion solar masses  at a redshift of 2.3	stellar archeology shows that massive elliptical galaxies today formedrapidly about ten billion years ago with star formation rates above severalhundreds solar masses per year (m_sun/yr). their progenitors are likely thesub-millimeter-bright galaxies (smgs) at redshifts (z) greater than 2. whilesmgs' mean molecular gas mass of 5x10^10 m_sun can explain the formation oftypical elliptical galaxies, it is inadequate to form ellipticals that alreadyhave stellar masses above 2x10^11 m_sun at z ~ 2. here we reportmulti-wavelength high-resolution observations of a rare merger of two massivesmgs at z = 2.3. the system is currently forming stars at a tremendous rate of2,000 m_sun/yr. with a star formation efficiency an order-of-magnitude greaterthan that of normal galaxies, it will quench the star formation by exhaustingthe gas reservoir in only ~200 million years. at a projected separation of 19kiloparsecs, the two massive starbursts are about to merge and form a passiveelliptical galaxy with a stellar mass of ~4x10^11 m_sun. our observations showthat gas-rich major galaxy mergers, concurrent with intense star formation, canform the most massive elliptical galaxies by z ~ 1.5.

1309.1371	revealing the cold dust in low-metallicity environments: i - photometry  analysis of the dwarf galaxy survey with herschel	we present new photometric data from our herschel key programme, the dwarfgalaxy survey (dgs), dedicated to the observation of the gas and dust in 48low-metallicity environments. they were observed with pacs and spire onboardherschel at 70,100,160,250,350, and 500 microns. we focus on a systematiccomparison of the derived fir properties (fir luminosity, dust mass, dusttemperature and emissivity index) with more metal-rich galaxies and investigatethe detection of a potential submm excess. the data reduction method is adaptedfor each galaxy to derive the most reliable photometry from the final maps.pacs flux densities are compared with the mips 70 and 160 microns bands. we usecolour-colour diagrams and modified blackbody fitting procedures to determinethe dust properties of the dgs galaxies. we also include galaxies from theherschel kingfish sample, containing more metal-rich environments, totalling109 galaxies. the location of the dgs galaxies on herschel colour-colourdiagrams highlights the differences in global environments of low-metallicitygalaxies. the dust in dgs galaxies is generally warmer than in kingfishgalaxies (t_dgs~32 k, t_kingfish~23 k). the emissivity index, beta, is ~1.7 inthe dgs, but metallicity does not make a strong effect on beta. thedust-to-stellar mass ratio is lower in low-metallicity galaxies:m_dust/m_star~0.02% for the dgs vs 0.1% for kingfish. per unit dust mass, dwarfgalaxies emit ~6 times more in the fir than higher metallicity galaxies. out ofthe 22 dgs galaxies detected at 500 micron, 41% present an excess in the submmnot explained by our dust sed model. the excess mainly appears in lowermetallicity galaxies (12+log(o/h) &lt; 8.3), and the strongest excesses aredetected in the most metal-poor galaxies. we stress the need for observationslongwards of the herschel wavelengths to detect any submm excess appearingbeyond 500 micron.

1310.4147	the suppression of star formation by powerful active galactic nuclei	the old, red stars which constitute the bulges of galaxies, and the massiveblack holes at their centres, are the relics of a period in cosmic history whengalaxies formed stars at remarkable rates and active galactic nuclei (agn)shone brightly from accretion onto black holes. it is widely suspected, butunproven, that the tight correlation in mass of the black hole and stellarcomponents results from the agn quenching the surrounding star formation as itapproaches its peak luminosity. x-rays trace emission from agn unambiguously,while powerful star-forming galaxies are usually dust-obscured and arebrightest at infrared to submillimetre wavelengths. here we report observationsin the submillimetre and x-ray which show that rapid star formation was commonin the host galaxies of agn when the universe was 2-6 gyrs old, but that themost vigorous star formation is not observed around black holes above an x-rayluminosity of 10^44 erg/s. this suppression of star formation in the hostgalaxies of powerful agn is a key prediction of models in which the agn drivesa powerful outflow, expelling the interstellar medium of its host galaxy andtransforming the galaxy's properties in a brief period of cosmic time.

1310.7583	hermes: candidate high-redshift galaxies discovered with herschel/spire	we present a method for selecting $z&gt;4$ dusty, star forming galaxies (dsfgs)using herschel/spire 250/350/500 $\mu m$ flux densities to search for redsources. we apply this method to 21 deg$^2$ of data from the hermes survey toproduce a catalog of 38 high-$z$ candidates. follow-up of the first 5 of thesesources confirms that this method is efficient at selecting high-$z$ dsfgs,with 4/5 at $z=4.3$ to $6.3$ (and the remaining source at $z=3.4$), and thatthey are some of the most luminous dusty sources known. comparison withprevious dsfg samples, mostly selected at longer wavelengths (e.g., 850 $\mum$) and in single-band surveys, shows that our method is much more efficient atselecting high-$z$ dsfgs, in the sense that a much larger fraction are at$z&gt;3$. correcting for the selection completeness and purity, we find that thenumber of bright ($s_{500\,\mu m} \ge 30$ mjy), red herschel sources is $3.3\pm 0.8$ deg$^{-2}$. this is much higher than the number predicted by currentmodels, suggesting that the dsfg population extends to higher redshifts thanpreviously believed. if the shape of the luminosity function for high-$z$ dsfgsis similar to that at $z\sim2$, rest-frame uv based studies may be missing asignificant component of the star formation density at $z=4$ to $6$, even aftercorrection for extinction.

0802.0497	the scuba half degree extragalactic survey (shades) - vii. optical/ir  photometry and stellar masses of sub-millimeter galaxies	we present estimates of the photometric redshifts, stellar masses and starformation histories of sources in the scuba half degree extragalactic survey(shades). this paper describes the 60 scuba sources detected in the lockmanhole covering an area of ~320 square arcmin. using photometry spanning the bband to 8um, we find that the average scuba source forms a significant fractionof its stars in an early period of star formation and that most of theremainder forms in a shorter more intense burst around the redshift it isobserved. this trend does not vary significantly with source redshift but theexact ratio of early to late mass is quite sensitive to the way extinction istreated in the modelling. however, the sources show a clear increase in stellarmass with redshift, consistent with downsizing. in terms of sed types, only twoout of the 51 sources we have obtained photometric redshifts for are best fitby a quasar-like spectral energy distribution, with approximately 80 per centof the sources being best fit with late-type spectra (sc, im and starburst). byincluding photometry at 850um, we conclude that the average scuba source isforming stars at a rate somewhere between 6 and 30 times the rate implied fromthe rest-frame optical in a dust obscured burst and that this burst creates15-65 per cent of the total stellar mass. using a simplistic calculation, weestimate from the average star formation history that between one in five andone in 15 bright (l_* +2 mag &lt; l_optical &lt; l_* -1 mag) galaxies in the fieldover the interval 0 &lt; z &lt; 3 will at some point in their lifetime experience asimilar energetic dusty burst of star formation. finally, we compute theevolution of the star formation rate density and find it peaks around z=2.

1402.3597	dust spectral energy distributions of nearby galaxies: an insight from  the herschel reference survey	we gather infrared (ir) photometric data from 8 to 500 microns (spitzer,wise, iras and herschel) for all of the hrs galaxies. draine &amp; li (2007) modelsare fit to the data from which the stellar contribution has been carefullyremoved. we find that our photometric coverage is sufficient to constrain allof the models parameters and that a strong constraint on the 20-60 micronsrange is mandatory to estimate the relative contribution of thephoto-dissociation regions to the ir sed. the sed models tend to systematicallyunder-estimate the observed 500 microns flux densities, especially for low masssystems. we provide the output parameters for all of the galaxies: the minimumintensity of the interstellar radiation field (isrf), the fraction of pah, therelative contribution of pdr and evolved stellar population to the dustheating, the $m_{dust}$ and the $l_{ir}$. for a subsample of gas-rich galaxies,we analyze the relations between these parameters and the integrated propertiesof galaxies, such as $m_*$, sfr, metallicity, h$\alpha$ and h-band surfacebrightness, and the fuv attenuation. a good correlation between the fraction ofpah and the metallicity is found implying a weakening of the pah emission ingalaxies with low metallicities. the intensity of the irsf and the h-band andh$\alpha$ surface brightnesses are correlated, suggesting that the diffuse dustcomponent is heated by both the young stars in star forming regions and thediffuse evolved population. we use these results to provide a new set of irtemplates calibrated with herschel observations on nearby galaxies and a meansed template to provide the z=0 reference for cosmological studies. for thesame purpose, we put our sample on the sfr-$m_*$ diagram. the templates arecompared to the most popular ir sed libraries, enlightening a large discrepancybetween all of them in the 20-100 microns range.

1402.4524	pacs photometry of the herschel reference survey -  far-infrared/sub-millimeter colours as tracers of dust properties in nearby  galaxies	we present herschel/pacs 100 and 160 micron integrated photometry for the 323galaxies in the herschel reference survey (hrs), a k-band-, volume-limitedsample of galaxies in the local universe. once combined with the herschel/spireobservations already available, these data make the hrs the largestrepresentative sample of nearby galaxies with homogeneous coverage across the100-500 micron wavelength range. in this paper, we take advantage of thisunique dataset to investigate the properties and shape of thefar-infrared/sub-millimeter spectral energy distribution in nearby galaxies. weshow that, in the stellar mass range covered by the hrs (8&lt;log(m*/msun)&lt;12),the far-infrared/sub-millimeter colours are inconsistent with a single modifiedblack-body having the same dust emissivity index beta for all galaxies. inparticular, either beta decreases, or multiple temperature components areneeded, when moving from metal-rich/gas-poor to metal-poor/gas-rich galaxies.we thus investigate how the dust temperature and mass obtained from a singlemodified black-body depend on the assumptions made on beta. we show that, whilethe correlations between dust temperature, galaxy structure and star formationrate are strongly model dependent, the dust mass scaling relations are muchmore reliable, and variations of beta only change the strength of the observedtrends.

1411.3677	the far-infrared-radio correlation in ms0451-03	we present a multi-wavelength analysis of star-forming galaxies in themassive cluster ms0451.6-0305 at z $\sim$ 0.54 to shed new light on theevolution of the far-infrared-radio relationship in distant rich clusters. wehave derived total infrared luminosities for a spectroscopically confirmedsample of cluster and field galaxies through an empirical relation based on$spitzer$ mips 24 $\mu$m photometry. the radio flux densities were measuredfrom deep very large array 1.4 ghz radio continuum observations. we find theratio of far-infrared to radio luminosity for galaxies in an intermediateredshift cluster to be $q_{\rm fir}$ = 1.80$\pm$0.15 with a dispersion of 0.53.due to the large intrinsic dispersion, we do not find any observable change inthis value with either redshift or environment. however, a higher percentage ofgalaxies in this cluster show an excess in their radio fluxes when compared tolow redshift clusters ($27^{+23}_{-13}\%$ to $11\%$), suggestive of a clusterenhancement of radio-excess sources at this earlier epoch. in addition, thefar-infrared-radio relationship for blue galaxies, where $q_{\rm fir}$ =2.01$\pm$0.14 with a dispersion of 0.35, is consistent with the predicted valuefrom the field relationship, although these results are based on a sample froma single cluster.

1412.1488	variability-selected active galactic nuclei in the vst-sudare/voice  survey of the cosmos field	optical variability has proven to be an effective way of detecting agns inimaging surveys, lasting from weeks to years. in the present work we test itsuse as a tool to identify agns in the vst multi-epoch survey of the cosmosfield, originally tailored to detect supernova events. we make use of themulti-wavelength data provided by other cosmos surveys to discuss thereliability of the method and the nature of our agn candidates. our selectionreturns a sample of 83 agn candidates; based on a number of diagnostics, weconclude that 67 of them are confirmed agns (81% purity), 12 are classified assupernovae, while the nature of the remaining 4 is unknown. for the subsampleof agns with some spectroscopic classification, we find that type 1 areprevalent (89%) compared to type 2 agns (11%). overall, our approach is able toretrieve on average 15% of all agns in the field identified by means ofspectroscopic or x-ray classification, with a strong dependence on the sourceapparent magnitude. in particular, the completeness for type 1 agns is 25%,while it drops to 6% for type 2 agns. the rest of the x-ray selected agnpopulation presents on average a larger r.m.s. variability than the bulk of nonvariable sources, indicating that variability detection for at least some ofthese objects is prevented only by the photometric accuracy of the data. weshow how a longer observing baseline would return a larger sample of agncandidates. our results allow us to assess the usefulness of this agn selectiontechnique in view of future wide-field surveys.

1504.05254	spitzer imaging of strongly-lensed herschel-selected dusty star forming  galaxies	we present the rest-frame optical spectral energy distribution and stellarmasses of six herschel- selected gravitationally lensed dusty, star-forminggalaxies (dsfgs) at 1 &lt; z &lt; 3. these galaxies were first identified withherschel/spire imaging data from the herschel astrophysical terahertz largearea survey (h-atlas) and the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey(hermes). the targets were observed with spitzer/irac at 3.6 and 4.5um. due tothe spatial resolution of the irac observations at the level of 2 arcseconds,the lensing features of a background dsfg in the near-infrared are blended withthe flux from the foreground lensing galaxy in the irac imaging data. we makeuse of higher resolution hubble/wfc3 or keck/nirc2 adaptive optics imaging datato fit light profiles of the foreground lensing galaxy (or galaxies) as a wayto model the foreground components, in order to successfully disentangle theforeground lens and background source flux densities in the irac images. theflux density measurements at 3.6 and 4.5um, once combined with hubble/wfc3 andkeck/nirc2 data, provide important constraints on the rest-frame opticalspectral energy distribution of the herschel-selected lensed dsfgs. we modelthe combined uv- to millimeter-wavelength seds to establish the stellar mass,dust mass, star-formation rate, visual extinction, and other parameters foreach of these herschel-selected dsfgs. these systems have inferred stellarmasses in the range 8 x 10^10 to 4 x 10^11 msun and star-formation rates ofaround 100 msun yr-1. this puts these lensed sub-millimeter systems well abovethe sfr-m* relation observed for normal star-forming galaxies at similarredshifts. the high values of sfr inferred for these systems are consistentwith a major merger-driven scenario for star formation.

1505.02668	sudare-voice variability-selection of active galaxies in the chandra  deep field south and the servs/swire region	one of the most peculiar characteristics of active galactic nuclei (agn) istheir variability over all wavelengths. this property has been used in the pastto select agn samples and is foreseen to be one of the detection techniquesapplied in future multi-epoch surveys, complementing photometric andspectroscopic methods.  in this paper, we aim to construct and characterise an agn sample using amulti-epoch dataset in the r band from the sudare-voice survey.  our work makes use of the vst monitoring program of an area surrounding thechandra deep field south to select variable sources. we use data spanning a sixmonth period over an area of 2 square degrees, to identify agn based on theirphotometric variability.  the selected sample includes 175 agn candidates with magnitude r &lt; 23 mag. wedistinguish different classes of variable sources through their lightcurves, aswell as x-ray, spectroscopic, sed, optical and ir information overlapping withour survey.  we find that 12% of the sample (21/175) is represented by sn. of theremaining sources, 4% (6/154) are stars, while 66% (102/154) are likely agnsbased on the available diagnostics. we estimate an upper limit to thecontamination of the variability selected agn sample of about 34%, but we pointout that restricting the analysis to the sources with availablemulti-wavelength ancillary information, the purity of our sample is close to80% (102 agn out of 128 non-sn sources with multi-wavelength diagnostics). ourwork thus confirms the efficiency of the variability selection method inagreement with our previous work on the cosmos field; in addition we show thatthe variability approach is roughly consistent with the infrared selection.

1507.01144	the host galaxies of micro-jansky radio sources	we combine a deep 0.5~deg$^2$, 1.4~ghz deep radio survey in the lockman holewith infrared and optical data in the same field, including the servs andukidss near-infrared surveys, to make the largest study to date of the hostgalaxies of radio sources with typical radio flux densities $\sim 50 \;\mu$jy.87% (1274/1467) of radio sources have identifications in servs to $ab\approx23.1$ at 3.6 or 4.5$\mu$m, and 9% are blended with bright objects (mostlystars), leaving only 4% (59 objects) which are too faint to confidentlyidentify in the near-infrared. we are able to estimate photometric redshiftsfor 68% of the radio sources. we use mid-infrared diagnostics to show that thesource population consists of a mixture of star forming galaxies, rapidlyaccreting (cold mode) agn and low accretion rate, hot mode agn, with neitheragn nor starforming galaxies clearly dominating. we see the breakdown in the$k-z$ relation in faint radio source samples, and show that it is due to radiosource populations becoming dominated by sources with radio luminosities $\sim10^{23}\;{\rm whz^{-1}}$. at these luminosities, both the star forming galaxiesand the cold mode agn have hosts with stellar luminosities about a factor oftwo lower than those of hot mode agn, which continue to reside in only the mostmassive hosts. we show that out to at least $z\sim 2$, galaxies with stellarmasses $&gt;10^{11.5}\, m_{\odot}$ have a radio-loud fraction up to $\sim 30$%.this is consistent with there being a sufficient number of radio sources thatradio-mode feedback could play a role in galaxy evolution.

1507.07044	hermes: disentangling active galactic nuclei and star formation in the  radio source population	we separate the extragalactic radio source population above ~50 ujy intoactive galactic nuclei (agn) and star-forming sources. the primary method ofour approach is to fit the infrared spectral energy distributions (seds),constructed using spitzer/irac and mips and herschel/spire photometry, of 380radio sources in the extended chandra deep field-south. from the fitted seds,we determine the relative agn and star-forming contributions to their infraredemission. with the inclusion of other agn diagnostics such as x-ray luminosity,spitzer/irac colours, radio spectral index and the ratio of star-forming totalinfrared flux to k-corrected 1.4 ghz flux density, qir, we determine whetherthe radio emission in these sources is powered by star formation or by an agn.the majority of these radio sources (60 per cent) show the signature of an agnat some wavelength. of the sources with agn signatures, 58 per cent are hybridsystems for which the radio emission is being powered by star formation. thisimplies that radio sources which have likely been selected on their starformation have a high agn fraction. below a 1.4 ghz flux density of 1 mjy,along with finding a strong contribution to the source counts from purestar-forming sources, we find that hybrid sources constitute 20-65 per cent ofthe sources. this result suggests that hybrid sources have a significantcontribution, along with sources that do not host a detectable agn, to theobserved flattening of the source counts at ~1mjy for the extragalactic radiosource population.

1508.03237	the faint radio source population at 15.7 ghz - ii. multi-wavelength  properties	a complete, flux density limited sample of 96 faint ($&gt; 0.5$ mjy) radiosources is selected from the 10c survey at 15.7 ghz in the lockman hole. wehave matched this sample to a range of multi-wavelength catalogues, includingservs, swire, ukidss and optical data; multi-wavelength counterparts are foundfor 80 of the 96 sources and spectroscopic redshifts are available for 24sources. photometric reshifts are estimated for the sources withmulti-wavelength data available; the median redshift of the sample is 0.91 withan interquartile range of 0.84. radio-to-optical ratios show that at least 94per cent of the sample are radio loud, indicating that the 10c sample isdominated by radio galaxies. this is in contrast to samples selected at lowerfrequencies, where radio-quiet agn and starforming galaxies are present insignificant numbers at these flux density levels. all six radio-quiet sourceshave rising radio spectra, suggesting that they are dominated by agn emission.these results confirm the conclusions of paper i that the faint, flat-spectrumsources which are found to dominate the 10c sample below $\sim 1$ mjy are thecores of radio galaxies. the properties of the 10c sample are compared to theskads simulated skies; a population of low-redshift starforming galaxiespredicted by the simulation is not found in the observed sample.

1509.04496	supernova rates from the sudare vst-omegacam search. i	we describe the observing strategy, data reduction tools and early results ofa supernova (sn) search project, named sudare, conducted with the eso vsttelescope aimed at measuring the rate of the different types of sne in theredshift range 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.8. the search was performed in two of the best-studiedextragalactic fields, cdfs and cosmos, for which a wealth of ancillary data areavailable in the literature or public archives.  (abridged)  we obtained a final sample of 117 sne, most of which are snia (57%) and theremaining core collapse events of which 44% type ii, 22% type iin and 34% typeib/c. in order to link the transients, we built a catalog of ~1.3x10^5 galaxiesin the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;1 with a limiting magnitude k_ab=23.5 mag. wemeasured the sn rate per unit volume for sn ia and core collapse sne indifferent bin of redshifts. the values are consistent with other measurementsfrom the literature. the dispersion of the rate measurements for sne ia iscomparable with the scatter of the theoretical tracks for single (sd) anddouble degenerate (dd) binary systems models, therefore the data do not allowto disentangle among the two different progenitor scenarios. however, we maynotice that among the three tested models, sd and two flavours of dd, eitherwith a steep (ddc) or a wide (ddw) delay time distribution, the sd gives abetter fit across the whole redshift range whereas the ddc better matches thesteep rise up to redshift ~1.2. the ddw appears instead less favoured. the corecollapse sn rate is fully consistent, unlike recent claims, with the predictionbased on recent estimates of the star formation history, and standardprogenitor mass range.

1511.06167	the hermes sub-millimetre local and low-redshift luminosity functions	we used wide area surveys over 39 deg$^2$ by the hermes collaboration,performed with the herschel observatory spire multi-wavelength camera, toestimate the low-redshift, $0.02&lt;z&lt;0.5$, monochromatic luminosity functions(lfs) of galaxies at 250, 350 and 500$\,\mu$m. spire flux densities were alsocombined with spitzer photometry and multi-wavelength archival data to performa complete sed fitting analysis of spire detected sources to calculate precisek-corrections, as well as the bolometric infrared (8-1000$\,\mu$m) luminosityfunctions and their low-$z$ evolution from a combination of statisticalestimators. integration of the latter prompted us to also compute the localluminosity density (lld) and the comoving star formation rate density (sfrd)for our sources, and to compare them with theoretical predictions of galaxyformation models. the luminosity functions show significant and rapidluminosity evolution already at low redshifts, $0.02&lt;z&lt;0.2$, with l$_{ir}^*\propto (1+z)^{6.0\pm0.4}$ and $\phi_{ir}^* \propto (1+z)^{-2.1\pm0.4}$,l$_{250}^* \propto (1+z)^{5.3\pm0.2}$ and $\phi_{250}^* \propto(1+z)^{-0.6\pm0.4}$ estimated using the ir bolometric and the 250$\,\mu$m lfsrespectively. converting our ir ld estimate into an sfrd assuming a standardsalpeter imf and including the unobscured contribution based on the uvdust-uncorrected emission from local galaxies, we estimate a sfrd scaling ofsfrd$_0+0.08 z$, where sfrd$_0\simeq (1.9\pm 0.03)\times 10^{-2}[\mathrm{m}_\odot\,\mathrm{mpc}^{-3}]$ is our total sfrd estimate at$z\sim0.02$.

astro-ph;0601003	cosmic evolution of the galaxy mass and luminosity functions by  morphological type from multi-wavelength data in the cdf-south	we constrain the evolution of the galaxy mass and luminosity functions fromthe analysis of (public) multi-wavelength data in the chandra deep field south(cdfs) area, obtained from the goods and other projects, and including verydeep high-resolution imaging by hst/acs. our reference catalogue of fainthigh-redshift galaxies, which we have thoroughly tested for completeness andreliability, comes from a deep (s(3.6micron)&gt;1 microjy) image by irac on thespitzer observatory. these imaging data in the field are complemented withextensive optical spectroscopy by the eso vlt/fors2 and vimos spectrographs,while deep k-band vlt/isaac imaging is also used to derive furthercomplementary statistical constraints and to assist the source identificationand sed analysis. we have selected a highly reliable irac 3.6micron sub-sampleof 1478 galaxies with s(3.6)&gt;10microjy, 47% of which have spectroscopicredshift, while for the remaining objects both combo-17 and hyperz are used toestimate the photometric redshift. this very extensive dataset is exploited toassess evolutionary effects in the galaxy luminosity and stellar massfunctions, while luminosity/density evolution is further constrained with thenumber counts and redshift distributions. the deep acs imaging allows us todifferentiate these evolutionary paths by morphological type, which oursimulations show to be reliable at least up to z=1.5 for the two main early-(e/s0) and late-type (sp/irr) classes. these data, as well as our directestimate of the stellar mass function above m=10^(10)m_sun for the spheroidalsubclass, consistently evidence a progressive dearth of such objects to occurstarting at z=0.7, paralleled by an increase in luminosity.

astro-ph;0605305	luminosity functions for galaxies and quasars in the spitzer wide-area  infrared extra-galactic (swire) legacy survey	we construct rest-frame luminosity functions at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8 and 24microns over the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;2 for galaxies and 0&lt;z&lt;4 for optical qsos,using optical and infrared data from the spitzer wide-area infraredextragalactic survey. the 3.6 and 4.5 micron galaxy lfs show evidence formoderate positive luminosity evolution up to z~1.5, consistent with the passiveageing of evolved stellar populations. their comoving luminosity density wasfound to evolve passively, gradually increasing out to z~0.5-1 but flattening,or even declining, at higher redshift. conversely, the 24 micron galaxy lf,which is more sensitive to obscured star formation and/or agn activity,undergoes strong positive evolution, with the derived ir energy density and sfrdensity proportional to (1+z)^gamma with gamma=4.5^{+0.7}_{-0.6} and themajority of this evolution occurring since z~1. optical qsos, however, showpositive luminosity evolution in all bands, out to the highest redshifts(3&lt;z&lt;4). modelling as l* proportional to (1+z)^gamma gavegamma=1.3^{+0.1}_{-0.1} at 3.6 micron, gamma=1.0^{+0.1}_{-0.1} at 4.5 micronand stronger evolution at the longer wavelengths (5.8, 8 and 24 micron), ofgamma~3. comparison of the galaxy lfs to predictions from a semi-analytic modelbased on cdm indicate that an imf skewed towards higher mass star formation inbursts compared to locally is preferred. as a result the currently inferredmassive star formation rates in distant sub-mm sources may require substantialdownwards revision.

astro-ph;0609039	the scuba half degree extragalactic survey (shades) -- ii. submillimetre  maps, catalogue and number counts	we present the maps, source catalogue and number counts of the largest, mostcomplete and unbiased extragalactic submillimetre survey ever undertaken: the850-micron scuba half degree extragalactic survey (shades). using thesubmillimetre common-user bolometer array (scuba) on the james clerk maxwelltelescope (jcmt), shades mapped two separate regions of sky: thesubaru/xmm-newton deep field (sxdf) and the lockman hole east (lh). these scubamaps cover 720 square arcmin with an rms noise level of about 2 mjy and haveuncovered &gt;100 submillimetre galaxies. in order to ensure the utmost robustnessof the resulting source catalogue, data reduction was independently carried outby four sub-groups drawn within the shades team, providing an unprecedenteddegree of reliability with respect to other scuba catalogues available from theliterature. individual source lists from the four groups were combined toproduce a robust 120-object shades catalogue; an invaluable resource forfollow-up campaigns aiming to study the properties of a complete and consistentsample of submillimetre galaxies. we present differential and integral sourcenumber counts of submillimetre galaxies and find that the differential countsare better fit with a broken power-law or a schechter function than with asingle power-law; the shades data alone significantly show that a break isrequired at several mjy, although the precise position of the break is not wellconstrained. we also find that an 850-micron survey complete down to 2 mjywould resolve 20-30 per cent of the far-ir background into point sources.[abridged]

astro-ph;0610897	galaxy evolution through infrared surveys: from spitzer to herschel	the spitzer space telescope is devoting a significant fraction of theobserving time to multi-wavelength cosmological surveys of different depths invarious low-background sky regions. several tens of thousand mid-ir galaxieshave been detected over a wide interval of redshifts. a progressively clearerpicture of galaxy evolution is emerging, which emphasizes populations ofluminous galaxies at z&gt;1,likely corresponding to the main phases of stellarformation and galaxy assembly. these results are entirely consistent withprevious outcomes from iso, scuba and cobe observations, and provide valuableconstraints of high statistical and photometric precision. we briefly reporthere on our attempt to extract from statistical data some general properties ofgalaxy evolution and describe evidence that a population of very luminousobjects at z&gt;1.5 share different properties from those of starbursts at lowerredshifts, indicating some seemingly anti-hierarchical behavior of galaxyevolution in the ir. we warn, however, that these results are based on large,still uncertain, extrapolations of the observed mid-ir to bolometric fluxes,for measuring which the forthcoming far-ir and submillimetre herschel spaceobservatory will be needed. we finally comment, based on our presentunderstanding, about herschel capabilities for investigating the early phasesof galaxy evolution.

astro-ph;0702544	the scuba half degree extragalactic survey (shades) - iii.  identification of radio and mid-infrared counterparts to submillimetre  galaxies	determining an accurate position for a submm galaxy (smg) is the crucial stepthat enables us to move from the basic properties of an smg sample - sourcecounts and 2-d clustering - to an assessment of their detailed,multi-wavelength properties, their contribution to the history of cosmic starformation and their links with present-day galaxy populations. in this paper,we identify robust radio and/or ir counterparts, and hence accurate positions,for over two thirds of the scuba half-degree extragalactic survey (shades)source catalogue, presenting optical, 24-um and radio images of each smg.observed trends in identification rate have given no strong rationale forpruning the sample. uncertainties in submm position are found to be consistentwith theoretical expectations, with no evidence for significant additionalsources of error. employing the submm/radio redshift indicator, via aparameterisation appropriate for radio-identified smgs with spectroscopicredshifts, yields a median redshift of 2.8 for the radio-identified subset ofshades, somewhat higher than the median spectroscopic redshift. we present adiagnostic colour-colour plot, exploiting spitzer photometry, in which weidentify regions commensurate with smgs at very high redshift. finally, we findthat significantly more smgs have multiple robust counterparts than would beexpected by chance, indicative of physical associations. these multiple systemsare most common amongst the brightest smgs and are typically separated by 2-6",or 15-50/(sin i) kpc at z ~ 2, consistent with early bursts seen in mergersimulations.
