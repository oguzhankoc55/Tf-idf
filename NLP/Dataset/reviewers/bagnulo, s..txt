0901.0347	magnetism of herbig ae/be stars	observations of magnetic fields of stars at the pre-main sequence phase canprovide important new insights into the complex physics of the late stages ofstar formation. this is especially true at intermediate stellar masses, wheremagnetic fields are strong and globally organised, and therefore most amenableto direct study. recent circularly-polarised spectroscopic observations ofpre-main sequence herbig ae/be stars have revealed the presence of organisedmagnetic fields in the photospheres of a small fraction of these objects. todate, 9 magnetic haebe stars have been detected, and those detections confirmedby repeated observations. the morphology and variability of their stokes vsignatures indicates that their magnetic fields have important dipolecomponents of kg strength, and that the dipole is stable on timescales ofatleast years. these magnetic stars exhibit a large range of stellar mass, fromabout 2-13 solar masses, and diverse rotational properties, with vsini from afew km/s to 200 km/s. most magnetic haebe stars show approximately solarabundances; they clearly do not generally exhibit the strong and systematicpeculiarities of the magnetic main sequence a and b type stars (the ap/bpstars). the observed fractional bulk incidence of magnetic haebe stars is about7%, a value compatible with the incidence of magnetic intermediate-mass starson the main sequence. this low incidence is at odds with formation scenariosgenerally involving magnetically-mediated accretion. the similarily between themagnetic properties of the pre-main sequence and main sequenceintermediate-mass stars appears compatible with the hypothesis of a fossilorigin of magnetism in these objects.

0906.5269	the chemical abundance analysis of normal early a- and late b-type stars	modern spectroscopy of early-type stars often aims at studying complexphysical phenomena. comparatively less attention is paid to identifying andstudying the "normal" a- and b-type stars and testing how the basic atomicparameters and standard spectral analysis allow one to fit the observations. wewish to stablish whether the chemical composition of the solar photosphere canbe regarded as a reference for early a- and late b-type stars. we have obtainedoptical high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectra of three slowlyrotating early-type stars (hd 145788, 21 peg and pi cet) that show no obvioussign of chemical peculiarity, and performed a very accurate lte abundanceanalysis of up to 38 ions of 26 elements (for 21 peg), using a vast amount ofspectral lines visible in the spectral region covered by our spectra. weprovide an exhaustive description of the abundance characteristics of the threeanalysed stars with a critical review of the line parameters used to derive theabundances. we compiled a table of atomic data for more than 1100 measuredlines that may be used in the future as a reference. the abundances we obtainedfor he, c, al, s, v, cr, mn, fe, ni, sr, y, and zr are compatible with thesolar ones derived with recent 3d radiative-hydrodynamical simulations of thesolar photosphere. the abundances of the remaining studied elements show somedegree of discrepancy compared to the solar photosphere. those of n, na, mg,si, ca, ti, and nd may well be ascribed to non-lte effects; for p, cl, sc andco, non-lte effects are totally unknown; o, ne, ar, and ba show discrepanciesthat cannot be ascribed to non-lte effects. the discrepancies obtained for o(in two stars) and ne agree with very recent non-lte abundance analysis ofearly b-type stars in the solar neighbourhood.

0907.5113	magnetism and binarity of the herbig ae star v380 ori	in this paper we report the results of high-resolution circularspectropolarimetric monitoring of the herbig ae star v380 ori, in which wediscovered a magnetic field in 2005. a careful study of the intensity spectrumreveals the presence of a cool spectroscopic companion. by modelling the binaryspectrum we infer the effective temperature of both stars: $10500\pm 500$ k forthe primary, and $5500\pm500$ k for the secondary, and we argue that the highmetallicity ($[m/h] = 0.5$), required to fit the lines may imply that theprimary is a chemically peculiar star. we observe that the radial velocity ofthe secondary's lines varies with time, while that of the the primary does not.by fitting these variations we derive the orbital parameters of the system. wefind an orbital period of $104\pm5$ d, and a mass ratio ($m_{\rm p}/m_{\rm s}$)larger than 2.9. the intensity spectrum is heavily contaminated with strong,broad and variable emission. a simple analysis of these lines reveals that adisk might surround the binary, and that a wind occurs in the environment ofthe system. finally, we performed a magnetic analysis using the least-squaresdeconvolved (lsd) profiles of the stokes $v$ spectra of both stars, andadopting the oblique rotator model. from rotational modulation of the primary'sstokes $v$ signatures, we infer its rotation period $p=4.31276\pm0.00042$ d,and find that it hosts a centred dipole magnetic field of polar strength$2.12\pm0.15$ kg, with a magnetic obliquity $\beta = 66\pm5^{\circ}$, and arotation axis inclination $i=32\pm5^{\circ}$. however, no magnetic field isdetected in the secondary, and if it hosts a dipolar magnetic field, itsstrength must be below about 500 g, to be consistent with our observations.

1005.3793	magnetic field, chemical composition and line profile variability of the  peculiar eclipsing binary star ar aur	ar aur is the only eclipsing binary known to contain a hgmn star, making itan ideal case for a detailed study of the hgmn phenomenon. hgmn stars are apoorly understood class of chemically peculiar stars, which have traditionallybeen thought not to possess significant magnetic fields. however, the recentdiscovery of line profile variability in some hgmn stars, apparentlyattributable to surface abundance patches, has brought this belief intoquestion. in this paper we investigate the chemical abundances, line profilevariability, and magnetic field of the primary and secondary of the ar aursystem, using a series of high resolution spectropolarimetric observations. wefind the primary is indeed a hgmn star, and present the most precise abundancesyet determined for this star. we find the secondary is a weak am star, and ispossibly still on the pre-main sequence. line profile variability was observedin a range of lines in the primary, and is attributed to inhomogeneous surfacedistributions of some elements. no magnetic field was detected in anyobservation of either stars, with an upper limit on the longitudinal magneticfield in both stars of 100 g. modeling of the phase-resolve longitudinal fieldmeasurements leads to a 3 sigma upper limit on any dipole surface magneticfield of about 400 g.

1006.5868	the rapid rotation and complex magnetic field geometry of vega	the recent discovery of a weak surface magnetic field on the normalintermediate-mass star vega raises the question of the origin of this magnetismin a class of stars that was not known to host magnetic fields. we aim toconfirm the field detection and provide additional observational constraintsabout the field characteristics, by modelling the magnetic geometry of the starand by investigating the seasonal variability of the reconstructed field. weanalyse a total of 799 circularly-polarized spectra collected with the narvaland espadons spectropolarimeters during 2008 and 2009. we employ across-correlation procedure to compute, from each spectrum, a mean polarizedline profile with a signal-to-noise ratio of about 20,000. the technique ofzeeman-doppler imaging is then used to determine the rotation period of thestar and reconstruct the large-scale magnetic geometry of vega at two differentepochs. we confirm the detection of circularly polarized signatures in the meanline profiles. the amplitude of the signatures is larger when spectral lines ofhigher magnetic sensitivity are selected for the analysis, as expected for asignal of magnetic origin. the short-term evolution of polarized signatures isconsistent with a rotational period of 0.732 \pm 0.008 d. the reconstructedmagnetic topology unveils a magnetic region of radial field orientation,closely concentrated around the rotation pole. this polar feature isaccompanied by a small number of magnetic patches at lower latitudes. nosignificant variability in the field structure is observed over a time span ofone year. the repeated observation of a weak photospheric magnetic field onvega suggests that a previously unknown type of magnetic stars exists in theintermediate-mass domain. vega may well be the first confirmed member of a muchlarger, as yet unexplored, class of weakly-magnetic stars.

1007.3082	a detailed spectropolarimetric analysis of the planet hosting star  wasp-12	the knowledge of accurate stellar parameters is paramount in several fieldsof stellar astrophysics, particularly in the study of extrasolar planets, whereoften the star is the only visible component and therefore used to infer theplanet's fundamental parameters. another important aspect of the analysis ofplanetary systems is the stellar activity and the possible star-planetinteraction. here we present a self-consistent abundance analysis of the planethosting star wasp-12 and a high-precision search for a structured stellarmagnetic field on the basis of spectropolarimetric observations obtained withthe espadons spectropolarimeter. our results show that the star does not have astructured magnetic field, and that the obtained fundamental parameters are ingood agreement with what was previously published. in addition we deriveimproved constraints on the stellar age (1.0-2.65 gyr), mass (1.23-1.49 m/m0),and distance (295-465 pc). wasp-12 is an ideal object to look for pollutionsignatures in the stellar atmosphere. we analyse the wasp-12 abundances as afunction of the condensation temperature and compare them with those publishedby several other authors on planet hosting and non-planet hosting stars. wefind hints of atmospheric pollution in wasp-12's photosphere, but are unable toreach firm conclusions with our present data. we conclude that a differentialanalysis based on wasp-12 twins will probably clarify if an atmosphericpollution is present, the nature of this pollution and its implications in theplanet formation and evolution. we attempt also the direct detection of thecircumstellar disk through infrared excess, but without success.

1103.5778	a study of the photometric variability of the peculiar magnetic white  dwarf wd1953-011	we present and interpret simultaneous new photometric and spectroscopicobservations of the peculiar magnetic white dwarf wd1953-011. the flux in thev-band filter and intensity of the balmer spectral lines demonstratevariability with the rotation period of about 1.45 days. according to previousstudies, this variability can be explained by the presence of a dark spothaving a magnetic nature, analogous to a sunspot. motivated by this idea, weexamine possible physical relationships between the suggested dark spot and thestrong-field magnetic structure (magnetic "spot", or "tube") recentlyidentified on the surface of this star. comparing the rotationally-modulatedflux with the variable spectral observables related to the magnetic "spot" weestablish their correlation, and therefore their physical relationship.modeling the variable photometric flux assuming that it is associated withtemperature variations in the stellar photosphere, we argue that thestrong-field area and dark, low-temperature spot are comparable in size andlocated at the same latitudes, essentially overlapping each other with apossible slight longitudinal shift. in this paper we also present a new,improved value of the star's rotational period and constrain thecharacteristics of the thermal inhomogeneity over the degenerate's surface.

0710.1554	weak magnetic fields in ap/bp stars: evidence for a dipole field lower  limit and a tentative interpretation of the magnetic dichotomy	we have investigated a sample of 28 well-known spectroscopically-identifiedmagnetic ap/bp stars, with weak, poorly-determined or previously undetectedmagnetic fields, with the aim of exploring the weak part of the magnetic fielddistribution of ap/bp stars. using the musicos and narval spectropolarimeterswe have obtained 282 lsd stokes v signatures of our 28 sample stars. all starswere detected, showing clearly that when observed with sufficient precision,all firmly classified ap/bp stars show detectable surface magnetic fields. tobetter characterise the surface magnetic field intensities and geometries ofthe sample, we have inferred the dipolar field intensity and the magneticobliquity. the distribution of derived dipole strengths for these starsexhibits a plateau at about 1 kg, falling off to larger and smaller fieldstrengths. remarkably, in this sample of stars selected for their presumablyweak magnetic fields, we find only 2 stars for which the derived dipolestrength is weaker than 300 g. we interpret this "magnetic threshold" as acritical value necessary for the stability of large-scale magnetic fields, anddevelop a simple quantitative model that is able to approximately reproduce theobserved threshold characteristics. this scenario leads to a naturalexplanation of the small fraction of intermediate-mass magnetic stars. it mayalso explain the near-absence of magnetic fields in more massive b and o-typestars.

0710.1780	magnetism and rotation in herbig ae/be stars	among the main sequence intermediate mass a and b stars, around 5% hostlarge-scale organized magnetic fields. most of these stars are very slowrotators compared to their non-magnetic counterparts, and show photosphericabundance anomalies. they are referred to as the ap/bp stars. one of thegreatest challenges, today is to understand the origin of their magnetic fieldand their slow rotation. the favoured hypothesis is a fossil origin of themagnetic field, in which the magnetic fields of ap/bp stars are relics of thosewhich existed in the parental molecular clouds during the formation. thisimplies that the magnetic field must survive all the initial phases of thestellar evolution and especially the pre-main sequence (pms) phase. this isconsistent with the general belief that magnetic braking occurs during the pmsphase, which sheds angular momentum and slows the rotation of these stars. inthis context, we proceeded with a survey of a sample of around 50 pms herbigae/be stars, using the new spectropolarimeter espadons at the cfht, in order tostudy the magnetic field and the rotation velocity of these stars. this talkreviews the results of our survey, as well as their consequences for the originof the magnetic fields and the evolution of the rotation of intermediate massstars during the pms phase.

1207.6210	the habitability and detection of earth-like planets orbiting cool white  dwarfs	since there are several ways planets can survive the giant phase of the hoststar, we examine the habitability and detection of planets orbiting whitedwarfs. as a white dwarf cools from 6000 k to 4000 k, a planet orbiting at 0.01au would remain in the continuous habitable zone (chz) for ~8 gyr. we show thatphotosynthetic processes can be sustained on such planets. the dna-weighted uvradiation dose for an earth-like planet in the chz is less than the maximaencountered on earth, hence non-magnetic white dwarfs are compatible with thepersistence of complex life. polarisation due to a terrestrial planet in thechz of a cool white dwarf is 10^2 (10^4) times larger than it would be in thehabitable zone of a typical m-dwarf (sun-like star). polarimetry is thus aviable way to detect close-in rocky planets around white dwarfs. multi-bandpolarimetry would also allow reveal the presence of a planet atmosphere,providing a first characterisation. planets in the chz of a 0.6 m_sun whitedwarf will be distorted by roche geometry, and a kepler-11d analogue wouldoverfill its roche lobe. with current facilities a super-earth-sizedatmosphereless planet is detectable with polarimetry around the brightest knowncool white dwarf. planned future facilities render smaller planets detectable,in particular by increasing the instrumental sensitivity in the blue.

1208.3650	on the incidence of weak magnetic fields in da white dwarfs	context: about 10% of white dwarfs have magnetic fields with strength in therange between about 10^5 and 3x10^8 g. it is not known whether the remainingwhite dwarfs are not magnetic, or if they have a magnetic field too weak to bedetected with the techniques adopted in the large surveys. aims. we describethe results of the first survey specifically devised to clarify the detectionfrequency of kg-level magnetic fields in cool da white dwarfs. methods: usingthe fors1 instrument of the eso vlt, we have obtained balmer line circularspectropolarimetric measurements of a small sample of cool (da6 - da8) whitedwarfs. using fors and uves archive data, we have also revised numerous whitedwarf field measurements previously published in the literature. results: wehave discovered an apparently constant longitudinal magnetic field of \sim9.5kg in the da6 white dwarf wd2105-820. this star is the first weak-field whitedwarf that has been observed sufficiently to roughly determine thecharacteristics of its field. the available data are consistent with a simpledipolar morphology with magnetic axis nearly parallel to the rotation axis, anda polar strength of \simeq 56 kg. our re-evaluation of the fors archive datafor white dwarfs indicates that longitudinal magnetic fields weaker than 10 kghad previously been correctly identified in at least three white dwarfs.conclusions: we find that the probability of detecting a field of kg strengthin a da white dwarf is of the order of 10% for each of the cool and hot dastars. if there is a lower cutoff to field strength in white dwarfs, or a fieldbelow which all white dwarfs are magnetic, the current precision ofmeasurements is not yet sufficient to reveal it.

0712.0199	magnetism in pre-ms intermediate-mass stars and the fossil field  hypothesis	today, one of the greatest challenges concerning the ap/bp stars is tounderstand the origin of their slow rotation and their magnetic fields. thefavoured hypothesis for the latter is the fossil field, which implies that themagnetic fields subsist throughout the different evolutionary phases, and inparticular during the pre-main sequence phase. the existence of magnetic fieldsat the pre-main sequence phase is also required to explain the slow rotation ofap/bp stars. however, until recently, essentially no information was availableabout the magnetic properties of intermediate-mass pre-main sequence stars, theso-called herbig ae/be stars. the new high-resolution spectropolarimeterespadons, installed in 2005 at the canada-france-hawaii telescope, provided thecapability necessary to perform surveys of the herbig ae/be stars in order toinvestigate their magnetism and rotation. these investigations have resulted inthe detection and/or confirmation of magnetic fields in 8 herbig ae/be stars,ranging in mass from 2 to nearly 15 solar masses. in this contribution i willpresent the results of our survey, as well as their implications for the originand evolution of the magnetic fields and rotation.

1211.2907	a high-resolution spectropolarimetric survey of herbig ae/be stars - i.  observations and measurements	this is the first in a series of papers in which we describe and report theanalysis of a large survey of herbig ae/be stars in circularspectropolarimetry. using the espadons and narval high-resolutionspectropolarimeters at the canada-france-hawaii and bernard lyot telescopes,respectively, we have acquired 132 circularly-polarised spectra of 70 herbigae/be stars and herbig candidates. the large majority of these spectra arecharacterised by a resolving power of about 65,000, and a spectral coveragefrom about 3700 ang to 1 micron. the peak snr per ccd pixel ranges from below100 (for the faintest targets) to over 1000 (for the brightest). theobservations were acquired with the primary aim of searching for magneticfields in these objects. however, our spectra are suitable for a variety ofother important measurements, including rotational properties, variability,binarity, chemical abundances, circumstellar environment conditions andstructure, etc. in this first paper, we describe the sample selection, theobservations and their reduction, and the measurements that will comprise thebasis of much of our following analysis. we describe the determination offundamental parameters for each target. we detail the least-squaresdeconvolution that we have applied to each of our spectra, including theselection, editing and tuning of the lsd line masks. we describe the fitting ofthe lsd stokes i profiles using a multi-component model that yields therotationally-broadened photospheric profile (providing the projected rotationalvelocity and radial velocity for each observation) as well as circumstellaremission and absorption components. finally, we diagnose the longitudinalzeeman effect via the measured circular polarisation, and report thelongitudinal magnetic field and stokes v zeeman signature detectionprobability. as an appendix, we provide a detailed review of each starobserved.

0712.1340	spectroscopic study of pulsations in the atmosphere of roap star 10 aql	we present the analysis of spectroscopic time-series observations of the roapstar 10 aql. observations were carried out in july 2006 with the uves and sargspectrographs simultaneously with the most mini-satellite photometry. all thesedata were analysed for radial velocity (rv) variations. about 150 lines out ofthe 1000 measured reveal clear pulsation signal. frequency analysis of thespectroscopic data gives four frequencies. three highest amplitude frequenciesin spectroscopy coincide with the photometric ones. phase-amplitude diagramscreated for the lines of different elements/ions show that atmosphericpulsations may be represented by a superposition of the standing and runningwave components, similar to other roap stars. the highest rv amplitudes,300-400 m/s, were measured for ce ii, dy iii, tb iii, and two unidentifiedlines at lambda 5471, 5556 a. we discovered ~0.4 period phase jump in the rvmeasurements across the nd iii line profiles. it indicates the presence of thepulsation node in stellar atmosphere. the phase jump occurs at nearly the sameatmospheric layers for the two main frequencies. there is no rotationalmodulation in the average spectra for the 6 different nights we analysed.

0712.1742	magnetic doppler imaging of ap stars	historically, the magnetic field geometries of the chemically peculiar apstars were modelled in the context of a simple dipole field. however, with theacquisition of increasingly sophisticated diagnostic data, it has become clearthat the large-scale field topologies exhibit important departures from thissimple model. recently, new high-resolution circular and linear polarisationspectroscopy has even hinted at the presence of strong, small-scale fieldstructures, which were completely unexpected based on earlier modelling. thisproject investigates the detailed structure of these strong fossil magneticfields, in particular the large-scale field geometry, as well as small scalemagnetic structures, by mapping the magnetic and chemical surface structure ofa selected sample of ap stars. these maps will be used to investigate therelationship between the local field vector and local surface chemistry,looking for the influence the field may have on the various chemical transportmechanisms (i.e., diffusion, convection and mass loss). this will lead tobetter constraints on the origin and evolution, as well as refining themagnetic field model for ap stars. mapping will be performed using highresolution and signal-to-noise ratio time-series of spectra in both circularand linear polarisation obtained using the new-generation espadons and narvalspectropolarimeters at the cfht and pic du midi observatory. with these data wewill perform tomographic inversion of doppler-broadened stokes iquv zeemanprofiles of a large variety of spectral lines using the invers10 magneticdoppler imaging code, simultaneously recovering the detailed surface maps ofthe vector magnetic field and chemical abundances.

0712.1746	characterisation of the magnetic field of the herbig be star hd 200775	after our recent discovery of four magnetic herbig stars, we have decided tostudy in detail one of them, hd 200775, to determine if its magnetic topologyis similar to that of the main sequence magnetic stars. with this aim, wemonitored this star in stokes i and v over more than two years, using the newspectropolarimeters espadons at cfht, and narval at tbl. using our data, wefind that hd 200775 is a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, whosesecondary seems similar, in temperature, to the primary. we determine theluminosity ratio of the system, and using the luminosity of the system found inliterature, we derive the luminosity of both stars. from our measurements ofthe radial velocities of both stars we determine the ephemeris and the orbitalparameters of the system. we have fitted 30 stokes v profiles simultaneously,using a chi2 minimisation method, with a decentered-dipole model. the best-fitmodel provides a rotation period of 4.3281 d an inclination angle of 60degrees, and a magnetic obliquity angle of 125 degrees. the polar strength ofthe magnetic dipole field is 1000 g, which is decentered by 0.05 r* from thecenter of the star. the derived magnetic field model is qualitatively identicalto those commonly observed in the ap/bp stars, which bring strong argument infavour of the fossil field hypothesis, to explain the origin of the magneticfields in the main sequence ap/bp stars. our determination of the inclinationof the rotation axis leads to a radius of the primary which is smaller thanthat derived from the hr diagram position. this can be explained by a largerintrinsic luminosity of the secondary relative to the primary, due to a largercircumstellar extinction of the secondary relative to the primary.

0801.2245	isotopic anomaly and stratification of ca in magnetic ap stars	we have carried out an accurate investigation of the ca isotopic compositionand stratification in the atmospheres of 23 magnetic chemically peculiar (ap)stars of different temperature and magnetic field strength. with the uvesspectrograph at the 8m eso vlt, we have obtained high-resolution spectra of apstars in the wavelength range 3000-10000 a. using a detailed spectrum synthesiscalculations, we have reproduced a variety of ca lines in the optical andultraviolet spectral regions, inferring the overall vertical distribution of caabundance, then we have deduced the relative isotopic composition and itsdependence on height using the profile of the the ir-triplet ca ii line atlambda 8498 a. in 22 out of 23 studied stars, we found that ca is stronglystratified, being usually overabundant by 1.0-1.5 dex below log tau_5000 ~ -1,and strongly depleted above log tau_5000 = -1.5. the ir-triplet ca ii line atlambda 8498 a reveals a significant contribution of the heavy isotopes 46ca and48ca, which represent less than 1% of the terrestrial ca isotopic mixture. weconfirm our previous finding that the presence of heavy ca isotopes isgenerally anticorrelated with the magnetic field strength. moreover, wediscover that in ap stars with relatively small surface magnetic fields (&lt;=4-5kg), the light isotope 40ca is concentrated close to the photosphere, while theheavy isotopes are dominant in the outer atmospheric layers. this verticalisotopic separation, observed for the first time for any metal in a stellaratmosphere, disappears in stars with magnetic field strength above 6-7 kg. wesuggest that the overall ca stratification and depth-dependent isotopic anomalyobserved in ap stars may be attributed to a combined action of theradiatively-driven diffusion and light-induced drift.

1308.3148	dust in the diffuse interstellar medium: extinction, emission, linear  and circular polarisation	we present a model for the diffuse interstellar dust that explains theobserved wavelength-dependence of extinction, emission, linear and circularpolarisation of light. the model is set-up with a small number of parameters.it consists of a mixture of amorphous carbon and silicate grains with sizesfrom the molecular domain of 0.5 up to about 500nm. dust grains with radiilarger than 6nm are spheroids. spheroidal dust particles have a factor 1.5 - 3larger absorption cross section in the far ir than spherical grains of the samevolume. mass estimates derived from submillimeter observations that ignore thiseffect are overestimated by the same amount. in the presence of a magneticfield, spheroids may be partly aligned and polarise light. we find thatpolarisation spectra help to determine the upper particle radius of theotherwise rather unconstrained dust size distribution. stochastically heatedsmall grains of graphite, silicates and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs)are included. we tabulate parameters for pah emission bands in variousenvironments. they show a trend with the hardness of the radiation field thatcan be explained by the ionisation state or hydrogenation coverage of themolecules. for each dust component its relative weight is specified, so thatabsolute element abundances are not direct input parameters. the model isconfronted with the average properties of the milky way, which seems torepresent dust in the solar neighbourhood. it is then applied to four specificsight lines including the reflection nebula ngc2023. for these sight lines, wepresent linear and circular spectro-polarimetric observations obtained withfors/vlt. using prolate rather than oblate grains gives a better fit toobserved spectra; the axial ratio of the spheroids is typically two and alignedsilicates are the dominant contributor to the polarisation.

1311.1552	chemical peculiarities in magnetic and non-magnetic pre-main sequence a  and b stars	in a- and late b-type stars, strong magnetic fields are always associatedwith ap and bp chemical peculiarities. however, it is not clear at what pointin a star's evolution those peculiarities develop. strong magnetic fields havebeen observed in pre-main sequence a and b stars (herbig ae and be stars), andthese objects have been proposed to be the progenitors of ap and bp stars.however, the photospheric chemical abundances of these magnetic herbig starshave not been studied carefully, and furthermore the chemical abundances of'normal' non-magnetic herbig stars remain poorly characterized. to investigatethis issue, we have studied the photospheric compositions of 23 herbig stars,four of which have confirmed magnetic fields. surprisingly, we found that halfthe non-magnetic stars in our sample show lambda bootis chemical peculiaritiesto varying degrees. for the stars with detected magnetic fields, we find onechemically normal star, one star with lambda boo peculiarities, one stardisplaying weak ap/bp peculiarities, and one somewhat more evolved star withsomewhat stronger ap/bp peculiarities. these results suggests that ap/bppeculiarities are preceded by magnetic fields, and that these peculiaritiesdevelop over the pre-main sequence lives of a and b stars. the incidence oflambda boo stars we find is much higher than that seen on the main sequence. weargue that a selective accretion model for the formation of lambda boopeculiarities is a natural explanation for this remarkably large incidence.

1312.0511	discovery of secular variations in the atmospheric abundances of  magnetic ap stars	the stars of the middle main sequence have relatively quiescent outer layers,and unusual chemical abundance patterns may develop in their atmospheres. thepresence of chemical peculiarities reveal the action of such subsurfacephenomena as gravitational settling and radiatively driven levitation of traceelements, and their competition with mixing processes such as turbulentdiffusion.  we want to establish whether abundance peculiarities change as stars evolveon the main sequence, and provide observational constraints to diffusiontheory.  we have performed spectral analysis of 15 magnetic bp stars that are membersof open clusters (and thus have well-known ages), with masses between about 3and 4 m_sun. for each star, we measured the abundances of he, o, mg, si, ti,cr, fe, pr and nd.  we have discovered the systematic time evolution of trace elements throughthe main-sequence lifetime of magnetic chemically peculiar stars as theiratmospheres cool and evolve toward lower gravity. during the main sequencelifetime, we observe clear and systematic variations in the atmosphericabundances of he, ti, cr, fe, pr and nd. for all these elements, except he, theatmospheric abundances decrease with age. the abundances of fe-peak elementsconverge toward solar values, while the rare-earth elements converge towardvalues at least 100 times more abundant than in the sun. helium is alwaysunderabundant compared to the sun, evolving from about 1% up to 10% of thesolar he abundance. we have attempted to interpret the observed abundancevariations in the context of radiatively driven diffusion theory, which appearsto provide a framework to understand some, but not all, of the observedanomalous abundance levels and variations.

1401.1931	a successful search for hidden barbarians in the watsonia asteroid  family	barbarians, so named after the prototype of this class (234) barbara, are arare class of asteroids exhibiting anomalous polarimetric properties. theirvery distinctive feature is that they show negative polarization at relativelylarge phase-angles, where all 'normal' asteroids show positive polarization.the origin of the barbarian phenomenon is unclear, but it seems to becorrelated with the presence of anomalous abundances of spinel, a mineralusually associated with the so-called calcium aluminum-rich inclusions (cais)on meteorites. since cais are samples of the oldest solid matter identified inour solar system, barbarians are very interesting targets for investigations.inspired by the fact that some of the few known barbarians are members of, orvery close to the dynamical family of watsonia, we have checked whether thisfamily is a major repository of barbarians, in order to obtain some hints abouttheir possible collisional origin. we have measured the linear polarization ofa sample of nine asteroids which are members of the watsonia family within thephase-angle range 17-21 deg. we found that seven of them exhibit the peculiarbarbarian polarization signature, and we conclude that the watsonia family is arepository of barbarian asteroids. the new barbarians identified in ouranalysis will be important to confirm the possible link between the barbarianphenomenon and the presence of spinel on the surface.

0803.0877	searching for links between magnetic fields and stellar evolution iii.  measurement of magnetic fields in open cluster ap stars with espadons	we are carrying out a survey of magnetic fields in ap stars in open clustersin order to obtain the first sample of magnetic upper main sequence stars withprecisely known ages. these data will constrain theories of field evolution inthese stars. using the new spectropolarimeter espadons at cfht, we haveobtained 44 measurements of the mean longitudinal fields of 23 b6 - a2 starsthat have been identified as possible ap stars and that are possible members ofopen clusters, with a median uncertainty of about 45 g. of these stars, 10 havedefinite field detections. nine stars of our sample are found not to bemagnetic ap stars. the espadons data contain a large amount of usefulinformation not readily obtained from lower resolution spectropolarimetry. withthe new observations we are able to expand the available data on fields oflow-mass, relatively evolved ap stars, and identify more robustly whichobserved stars are actually magnetic ap stars and cluster members. re-analysisof the enlarged data set of cluster ap stars indicates that such stars withmasses in the range of 2 -- 5 \mo show rms fields larger than about 1 kg onlywhen they are near the zams. the time scale on which these large fieldsdisappear varies strongly with mass, ranging from about 250 myr for stars of 2- 3 solar mass to 15 myr for stars of 4 - 5 solar mass. our data are consistenteither with emergent flux conservation for most (but not all) ap stars, or withmodest decline in flux with age.

1409.4620	linear spectro-polarimetry: a new diagnostic tool for the classification  and characterisation of asteroids	we explore the use of spectro-polarimetry as a remote sensing tool forasteroids in addition to traditional reflectance measurements. in particular weare interested in possible relationships between the wavelength-dependentvariation of linear polarization and the properties of the surfaces, includingalbedo and composition.  we have obtained optical spectro-polarimetric measurements of a dozenasteroids of different albedo and taxonomic classes and of two small regions atthe limb of the moon.  we found that objects with marginally different relative reflectance spectra(in the optical) may have totally different polarization spectra. this suggeststhat spectro-polarimetry may be used to refine the classification of asteroids.we also found that in some cases the umov law may be violated, that is, incontrast to what is expected from basic physical considerations, the fractionof linear polarization and the reflectance may be positively correlated. inagreement with a few previous studies based on multi-colour broadbandpolarimetry, we found that the variation of linear polarization with wavelengthand with phase-angle is correlated with the albedo and taxonomic class of theobjects. finally, we have serendipitously discovered that spinel-rich asteroid(599) luisa, located very close to the watsonia family, is a member of the rareclass of barbarian asteroids.  we suggest that future modelling attempts of the surface structure ofasteroids should be aimed at explaining both reflectance and polarizationspectra.

0804.3140	the pecular magnetic field morphology of the white dwarf wd 1953-011:  evidence for a large-scale magnetic flux tube?	we present and interpret new spectropolarimetric observations of the magneticwhite dwarf wd 1953-011. circular polarization and intensity spectra of theh$\alpha$ spectral line demonstrate the presence of two-component magneticfield in the photosphere of this star. the geometry consists of a weak, largescale component, and a strong, localized component. analyzing the rotationallymodulated low-field component, we establish a rotation period $p_{rot} = 1.4480\pm 0.0001$ days. modeling the measured magnetic observables, we find that thelow-field component can be described by the superposition of a dipole andquadrupole. according to the best-fit model, the inclination of the stellarrotation axis with respect to the line of sight is $i \approx 20^\circ$, andthe angle between the rotation axis and the dipolar axis is $\beta \approx10^\circ$. the dipole strength at the pole is about 180 kg, and the quadrupolarstrength is about 230 kg. these data suggest a fossil origin of the low-fieldcomponent. in contrast, the strong-field component exhibits a peculiar,localized structure (``magnetic spot'') that confirms the conclusions of maxtedand co-workers. the mean field modulus of the spot ($|b_{spot}| = 520 \pm 7$kg) together with its variable longitudinal magnetic field having a maximum ofabout +400 kg make it difficult to describe it naturally as a high-ordercomponent of the star's global poloidal field. instead, we suggest that theobserved strong-field region has a geometry similar to a magnetic flux tube.

1502.05520	the enigmatic he-sdb pulsator ls iv$-$14$^\circ$116: new insights from  the vlt	the intermediate helium subdwarf b star ls iv$-$14$^\circ$116 is a uniqueobject showing extremely peculiar atmospheric abundances as well as long-periodpulsations that cannot be explained in terms of the usual opacity mechanism.one hypothesis invoked was that a strong magnetic field may be responsible. wediscredit this possibility on the basis of fors2 spectro-polarimetry, whichallows us to rule out a mean longitudinal magnetic field down to 300 g.  using the same data, we derive the atmospheric parameters for lsiv$-$14$^\circ$116 to be $t_{\rm eff}$ = 35,150$\pm$111 k, $\log{g}$ =5.88$\pm$0.02 and $\log{n(\rm he)/n(\rm h)}$ = $-$0.62$\pm$0.01. the highsurface gravity in particular is at odds with the theory that lsiv$-$14$^\circ$116 has not yet settled onto the helium main sequence, and thatthe pulsations are excited by an $\epsilon$ mechanism acting on thehelium-burning shells present after the main helium flash.  archival uves spectroscopy reveals ls iv$-$14$^\circ$116 to have a radialvelocity of 149.1$\pm$2.1 km/s. running a full kinematic analysis, we find thatit is on a retrograde orbit around the galactic centre, with a galactic radialvelocity component $u$=13.23$\pm$8.28 km/s and a galactic rotational velocitycomponent $v$=$-$55.56$\pm$22.13 km/s. this implies that ls iv$-$14$^\circ$116belongs to the halo population, an intriguing discovery.

1507.00800	a novel and sensitive method for measuring very weak magnetic fields of  da white dwarfs: a search for a magnetic field at the 250 g level in 40 eri b	searches for magnetic fields in white dwarfs have clarified both thefrequency of occurrence and the global structure of the fields found down tofield strengths of the order of 500 kg. below this level, the situation isstill very unclear. we are studying the weakest fields found in white dwarfs todetermine the frequency of such fields and their structure. we describe a verysensitive new method of measuring such fields in da (h-rich) white dwarfs, andsearch for a field in the brightest such star, 40 eri b. our new method makesuse of the strongly enhanced polarisation signal in the sharp core of halpha.we find that with one-hour integrations with the high-resolutionspectropolarimeter espadons on the 3.6-m cfht, we can reach a standard error fothe longitudinal field of about 85 g, the smallest error ever achieved for anywhite dwarf. nevertheless, we do not detect a magnetic field in this star.observations with isis at the wht, and the main stellar spectrograph at thesao, support the absence of a field at somewhat lower precision. the new methodis very efficient; it is shown that for suitable da stars the integration time,with espadons on a 3.6-m telescope, to reach a 500 g standard error on a whitedwarf of v = 12.5, is about half an hour, about the same as the time requiredon an eso 8-m telescope with fors using conventional low-resolutionspectropolarimetry.

1511.01759	a polarimetric study of asteroids: fitting phase - polarization curves	by considering all asteroid linear polarization data available in theliterature, it is possible to obtain updated phase - polarization curves forseveral tens of objects. in a separate paper (cellino et al., 2015a, mnras,451, 3473) we have produced new calibrations of different relations between thegeometric albedo and several polarimetric parameters, based on an analysis of alimited sample of asteroids for which the albedo is known with sufficientaccuracy. in this paper, we present the main polarization parameters andcorresponding albedos for a larger dataset of asteroids which we did not usefor calibration purposes. we find a good agreement between the albedo valuescomputed using different polarization parameters. conversely, in the case ofthe so-called barbarian asteroids the situation is rather unclear. moreover, wepresent an updated analysis of the distributions of different polarimetricparameters, including the so-called inversion angle and the solar phase anglecorresponding to the extreme value of negative polarization, and study theirmutual relations. we find that the above parameters can be used to clearlydistinguish some unusual classes of asteroids. polarimetric parameters areknown to be related to physical properties of asteroid surfaces which aredifficult to infer by means of other observing techniques. by using a muchlarger dataset, in our analysis we confirm and extend some results obtained inthe past by other authors, and we explore more systematically some featuresthat had been mostly unexplored before, mainly concerning the morphology of thenegative polarization branch.

astro-ph;0601414	exploring the surface properties of transneptunian objects and centaurs  with polarimetric fors1/vlt observations	polarization is a powerful remote-sensing method to investigate solar systembodies. it is an especially sensitive diagnostic tool to reveal physicalproperties of the bodies whose observational characteristics are governed bysmall scatterers (dust, regolith surfaces). for these objects, at small phaseangles, a negative polarization is observed, i.e., the electric vector eoscillates predominantly in the scattering plane, contrary to what is typicalfor rather smooth homogeneous surfaces. the behavior of negative polarizationwith phase angle depends on the size, composition and packing of thescatterers. these characteristics can be unveiled by modelling the lightscattering by the dust or regolith in terms of the coherent backscatteringmechanism.  we have investigated the surface properties of tnos and centaurs by means ofpolarimetric observations with fors1 of the eso vlt.  tnos ixion and quaoar, and centaur chiron show a negative polarization surge.the centaur chiron has the deepest polarization minimum (-1.5 - 1.4%). the twotnos show differing polarization curves: for ixion, the negative polarizationincreases rapidly with phase; for quaoar, the polarization is relatively small(~ -0.6%), and nearly constant at the observed phase angles. for all threeobjects, modelling results suggest that the surface contains an areal mixtureof at least two components with different single-scatterer albedos and photonmean-free paths.

astro-ph;0601461	evolutionary state of magnetic chemically peculiar stars	we present a comprehensive statistical investigation of the evolution ofmagnetic cp stars, aimed at providing constraints to the theories that dealwith the origin of the magnetic field in these stars. we have collected fromthe literature data for 150 magnetic cp stars with accurate hipparcosparallaxes. we have retrieved from the eso archive 142 fors1 observations ofcircularly polarized spectra for 100 stars. from these spectra we have measuredthe mean longitudinal magnetic field, and discovered 48 new magnetic cp stars(five of which belonging to the rare class of rapidly oscillating ap stars). wehave determined effective temperature and luminosity, then mass and position inthe h-r diagram for a final sample of 194 magnetic cp stars. we found thatmagnetic stars with m&gt;3msun are homogeneously distributed along the mainsequence. instead, there are statistical indications that lower mass stars(especially those with m&lt;=2msun) tend to concentrate in the centre of the mainsequence band. we show that this inhomogeneous age distribution cannot beattributed to the effects of random errors and small number statistics. ourdata suggest also that the surface magnetic flux of cp stars increases withstellar age and mass, and correlates with the rotation period. for stars withm&gt;3msun, rotation periods decrease with age in a way consistent with theconservation of the angular momentum, while for less massive magnetic cp starsan angular momentum loss cannot be ruled out. the mechanism that originates andsustains the magnetic field in the upper main sequence stars may be differentin cp stars of different mass.

astro-ph;0610499	the magnetic field of the pre-main sequence herbig ae star hd 190073	the general context of this paper is the study of magnetic fields in thepre-main sequence intermediate mass herbig ae/be stars. magnetic fields arelikely to play an important role in pre-main sequence evolution at thesemasses, in particular in controlling the gains and losses of stellar angularmomentum. the particular aim of this paper is to announce the detection of astructured magnetic field in the herbig ae star hd 190073, and to discussvarious scenarii for the geometry of the star, its environment and its magneticfield. we have used the espadons spectropolarimeter at cfht in 2005 and 2006 toobtain high-resolution and signal-to-noise circular polarization spectra whichdemonstrate unambiguously the presence of a magnetic field in the photosphereof this star. nine circular polarization spectra were obtained, each oneshowing a clear zeeman signature. this signature is suggestive of a magneticfield structured on large scales. the signature, which corresponds to alongitudinal magnetic field of 74+- 10 g, does not vary detectably on aone-year timeframe, indicating either an azimuthally symmetric field, a zeroinclination angle between the rotation axis and the line of sight, or a verylong rotation period. the optical spectrum of hd 190073 exhibits a large numberof emission lines. we discuss the formation of these emission lines in theframework of a model involving a turbulent heated region at the base of thestellar wind, possibly powered by magnetic accretion. this magnetic detectionbrings an important element for our understanding of stellar magnetism atintermediate masses.

astro-ph;0612284	rotation and chemical abundances of ap/bp stars in the open cluster ngc  6475	the connection between age, rotation and chemical abundance of magnetic apstars is poorly understood. using open clusters, we are able to study samplesof stars that are both co-eval and co-environmental. by determining rotationand chemical abundance for ap star members of clusters with various ages, thevariations of these properties as a function of age and environment can bederived. all four probable ap star members of the open cluster ngc 6475, aswell as one normal late b star, were studied using detailed spectrum synthesisof high resolution uves-pop spectra. probable cluster membership was confirmedfor all five stars, however chemical abundance anomalies only appear to bepresent in spectra of three. projected rotational velocity and chemicalabundances for 21 elements ranging from c to eu are presented for the 5 stars.in the three peculiar stars we find overabundances of si, cr, mn, fe and rareearths such as nd, characteristic of ap stars. the set of chemically peculiarstars show fairly homogeneous abundance tables, however notable differencesexist for a few elements. there also exist appreciable differences in the v sini and main sequence evolutionary stage of the chemically peculiar stars. thismay hint at the underlying processes giving rise to the observed abundanceanomalies. with this first detailed study of chemical abundances of a completesample of magnetic ap/bp stars in an open cluster, we have initiated anexploration of the environmental and evolutionary influence on chemicalpeculiarity.

0809.1959	photometry and polarimetry of the nucleus of comet 2p/encke	broadband imaging photometry, and broadband and narrowband linear polarimetrywas measured for the nucleus of 2p/encke over the phase-angle range 4 - 28 deg.an analysis of the point spread function of the comet reveals only weak comaactivity, corresponding to a dust production of the order of 0.05 kg/s. thenucleus displays a color independent photometric phase function of almostlinear slope. the absolute r filter magnitude at zero phase angle is 15.05 +/-0.05, and corresponds to an equivalent radius for the nucleus of 2.43 +/- 0.06km (for an adopted albedo of 0.047). the nucleus color v - r is 0.47 +/- 0.07,suggesting a spectral slope of 11 +/- 8 %/100nm. the phase function of linearpolarimetry in the v and r filters shows a widely color independent linearincrease with phase angle (0.12 +/- 0.02%/deg). we find discrepancies in thephotometric and polarimetric parameters between 2p/encke and other minor bodiesin the solar system, which may indicate significant differences in the surfacematerial properties and light-scattering behavior of the bodies.  the linear polarimetric phase function of 2p/encke presented here is thefirst ever measured for a cometary nucleus, and its analysis encourages futurestudies of cometary nuclei in order to characterize the light-scatteringbehavior of comets on firm empirical grounds and provide suitable input to acomprehensive modeling of the light scattering by cometary surfaces.

astro-ph;0701387	a search for strong, ordered magnetic fields in herbig ae/be stars	the origin of magnetic fields in intermediate-mass and high-mass stars isfundamentally a mystery. clues toward solving this basic astrophysical problemcan likely be found at the pre-main sequence (pms) evolutionary stage. withthis work, we perform the largest and most sensitive search for magnetic fieldsin pre-main sequence herbig ae/be (haebe) stars. sixty-eight observations of 50haebe stars have been obtained in circularly polarised light using the fors1spectropolarimeter at the eso vlt. an analysis of both balmer and metalliclines reveals the possible presence of weak longitudinal magnetic fields inphotospheric lines of two haebe stars, hd 101412 and bf ori. the intensity ofthe longitudinal fields detected in hd 101412 and bf ori suggest that theycorrespond to globally-ordered magnetic fields with surface intensities oforder 1 kg. monte carlo simulations of the longitudinal field measurements ofthe undetected stars allow us to place an upper limits of about 300 g on thegeneral presence of aligned magnetic dipole magnetic fields, and of about 500 gon perpendicular dipole fields. we find that the observed bulk incidence ofmagnetic haebe stars in our sample is 8-12%, in good agreement with that ofmagnetic main sequence stars of similar masses. we also find that the rmslongitudinal field intensity of magnetically-detected haebe stars is similar tothat of ap stars and consistent with magnetic flux conservation during stellarevolution. these results are all in agreement with the hypothesis that themagnetic fields of main sequence ap/bp stars are fossils, which already existwithin the stars at the pre-main sequence stage. finally, we explore theability of our new magnetic data to constrain magnetospheric accretion inherbig ae/be stars.

0809.2039	magnetic fields and chemical peculiarities of the very young  intermediate-mass binary system hd 72106	the recently discovered magnetic herbig ae and be stars may providequalitatively new information about the formation and evolution of magnetic apand bp stars. we have performed a detailed investigation of one particularlyinteresting binary system with a herbig ae secondary and a late b-type primarypossessing a strong, globally ordered magnetic field. twenty high-resolutionstokes v spectra of the system were obtained with the espadons instrumentmounted on the cfht. in these observations we see clear evidence for a magneticfield in the primary, but no evidence for a magnetic field in the secondary. adetailed abundance analysis was performed for both stars, revealing strongchemical peculiarities in the primary and normal chemical abundances in thesecondary. the primary is strongly overabundant in si, cr, and other iron-peakelements, as well as nd, and underabundant in he. the primary therefore appearsto be a very young bp star. in this context, line profile variations of theprimary suggest non-uniform lateral distributions of surface abundances.interpreting the 0.63995 +/- 0.00009 day variation period of the stokes i and vprofiles as the rotational period of the star, we have modeled the magneticfield geometry and the surface abundance distributions of si, ti, cr and feusing magnetic doppler imaging. we derive a dipolar geometry of the surfacemagnetic field, with a polar strength of 1230 g and an obliquity of 57 degrees.the distributions ti, cr and fe are all qualitatively similar, with anelongated patch of enhanced abundance situated near the positive magnetic pole.the si distribution is somewhat different, and its relationship to the magneticfield geometry less clear.

astro-ph;0702307	the optical polarisation of the vela pulsar revisited	in this work we present a revised measurement of the phase-averaged opticalpolarisation of the vela pulsar (psr b0833-45), for which only one value hasbeen published so far (wagner &amp; seifert 2000). our measurement has beenobtained through an accurate reanalysis of archival polarisation observationsobtained with the fors instrument at the vlt. we have measured a phase-averagedlinear polarisation degree p=9.4% +/- 4% and a position angle 146 +/- 11 deg,very close to the ones of the axis of symmetry of the x-ray arcs and jetsdetected by chandra and of the pulsar proper motion.we have compared themeasured phase-averaged optical polarisation with the expectations of differentpulsars' magnetosphere models. we have found that all models consistentlypredict too large values of the phase-averaged linear polarization with respectto the observed one. this is probably a consequence of present models'limitations which neglect the contributions of various depolarisation effects.interestingly, for the outer gap model we have found that, assuming synchrotronradiation for the optical emission, the observed polarisation position anglealso implies an alignment between the pulsar rotational axis and the axis ofsymmetry of the x-ray arcs and jets.

astro-ph;0703296	ca isotopic anomaly in the atmospheres of ap stars	we present results of the ca stratification analysis in the atmospheres of 21magnetic chemically peculiar (ap) stars. this analysis was based on thespectral observations carried out with the uves spectrograph attached to the8-m vlt telescope. ca was found to be strongly stratified in all stars withdifferent effective temperatures and magnetic field strengths. this element isoverabundant by 1-1.5 dex below logtau_5000~-1 and strongly depleted abovelogtau_5000=-1.5. based on the overall ca abundance distributions, we modelleda profile of the ir-triplet ca ii 8498 line. it shows a significantcontribution of the heavy isotopes 46ca and 48ca, which represent less than 1%of the solar ca isotopic mixture. in ap stars with the relatively small surfacemagnetic fields (&lt;= 4-5 kg) the light 40ca isotope is concentrated close to thephotosphere, while the heavy isotopes are pushed towards the outer layers.isotopic separation disappears in the atmospheres of stars with magnetic fieldsabove 6-7 kg. the observed overall ca stratification and isotopic anomalies maybe explained by a combined action of the radiatively-driven diffusion and thelight-induced drift.

0810.2714	discovery of two distinct polarimetric behaviours of trans-neptunian  objects	trans-neptunian objects (tnos) contain the most primitive and thermallyleast-processed materials from the early accretional phase of the solar system.they allow us to study interrelations between various classes of small bodies,their origin and evolution.  using fors1 of the eso vlt, we have obtained linear-polarization measurementsin the bessell r filter for five tnos at different values of their phase angle(i.e., the angle between the sun, the object, and the earth). due to the largedistance of the targets (&gt; 30 au), the observed range of phase angles islimited to about 0-2 deg. we have analyzed our new observations of five tnos,and those of another four tnos obtained in previous works, and discovered thatthere exist two classes of objects that exhibit different polarimetricbehaviour. objects with a diameter &gt; 1000 km, such as, e.g., pluto and eris,show a small polarization in the scattering plane (~0.5%) which slowly changesin the observed phase angle range. in smaller objects such as, e.g., ixion andvaruna, linear polarization changes rapidly with the phase angle, and reaches ~1% (in the scattering plane) at phase angle 1 deg. the larger objects have ahigher albedo than the smaller ones, and have the capability of retainingvolatiles such as co, n2 and ch4. both of these facts can be linked to theirdifferent polarimetric behaviour compared to smaller objects.  in spite of the very limited range of observable phase angles, ground-basedpolarimetric observations are a powerful tool to identify different propertiesof the surfaces of tnos. we suggest that a single polarimetric observation atphase angle ~1 deg allows one to determine whether the target albedo is low orhigh.

0706.0330	searching for links between magnetic fields and stellar evolution. ii.  the evolution of magnetic fields as revealed by observations of ap stars in  open clusters and associations	the evolution of magnetic fields in ap stars during the main sequence phaseis presently mostly unconstrained by observation because of the difficulty ofassigning accurate ages to known field ap stars.  we are carrying out a large survey of magnetic fields in cluster ap starswith the goal of obtaining a sample of these stars with well-determined ages.in this paper we analyse the information available from the survey as itcurrently stands.  we select from the available observational sample the stars that are probably(1) cluster or association members and (2) magnetic ap stars. for the stars inthis subsample we determine the fundamental parameters t_eff, log(l/l_o), andm/m_o. with these data and the cluster ages we assign both absolute age andfractional age (the fraction of the main sequence lifetime completed). for thispurpose we have derived new bolometric corrections for ap stars.  magnetic fields are present at the surfaces of ap stars from the zams to thetams. statistically for the stars with m &gt; 3 m_o the fields decline withadvancing age approximately as expected from flux conservation together withincreased stellar radius, or perhaps even faster than this rate, on a timescale of about 3 10^7 yr. in contrast, lower mass stars show no compellingevidence for field decrease even on a timescale of several times 10^8 yr.  study of magnetic cluster stars is now a powerful tool for obtainingconstraints on evolution of ap stars through the main sequence. enlarging thesample of known cluster magnetic stars, and obtaining more precise rms fields,will help to clarify the results obtained so far. further field observationsare in progress.
