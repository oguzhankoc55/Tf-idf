0903.1086	type ia supernova science 2010-2020	in the next decade type ia supernovae (sne ia) will be used to test theoriespredicting changes in the dark energy equation of state with time. ultimatelythis requires a dedicated space mission like jdem. sne ia are maturecosmological probes --- their limitations are well characterized, and a path toimprovement is clear. dominant systematic errors include photometriccalibration, selection effects, reddening, and population-dependentdifferences. building on past lessons, well-controlled new surveys are poisedto make strides in these areas: the palomar transient factory, skymapper, lasilla quest, pan-starrs, the dark energy survey, lsst, and jdem. they willobviate historical calibrations and selection biases, and allow comparisons vialarge subsamples. some systematics follow from our ignorance of sn iaprogenitors, which there is hope of determining with sn ia rate studies from0&lt;z&lt;4.  aside from cosmology, sne ia regulate galactic and cluster chemicalevolution, inform stellar evolution, and are laboratories for extreme physics.essential probes of sne ia in these contexts include spectroscopy from the uvto the ir, x-ray cluster and sn remnant observations, spectropolarimetry, andadvanced theoretical studies. while there are an abundance of discoveryfacilities planned, there is a deficit of follow-up resources. living in thesystematics era demands deep understanding rather than larger statistics. noaorestar initiative to build 2-4m telescopes would provide necessary follow-upcapability. finally, to fully exploit lsst, well-matched wide-fieldspectroscopic capabilities are desirable.

0906.4085	a catalog of near infrared spectra from type ia supernovae	we present forty-one near infrared (nir, 0.7-2.5 microns) spectra from normaltype ia supernovae (sne ia) obtained at epochs ranging from fourteen daysbefore to seventy-five days with respect to the maximum light date in thev-band. all data were obtained at the irtf using the spex instrument. weidentify many spectral features, measure the doppler velocities, and discussthe chemical distribution of explosion products in sne ia. we describeprocedures for smoothing data, fitting continua, and measuring absorptionfeatures to insure consistency for measurement and analysis.  this sample provides the first opportunity to examine and compare a largenumber of sne ia in this wavelength region. nir data are a rich source ofinformation about explosion products whose signatures are blended or obscuredin other spectral regions and nir observations probe a greater radial depththan optical wavelengths. we analyze similarities and differences in thespectra and we show that the progressive development of spectral features fornormal sne ia in the nir is consistent with time.  measured doppler velocities indicate that burning products in sne ia aredistributed in distinct layers with no large scale mixing. carbon is notdetected in these data, in agreement with previous results with nir dataestablishing very low limits on carbon abundance in sne ia. carbon burningproducts, o and mg, are plentiful in the outer layers suggesting that theentire progenitor is burned in the explosion. the data provide a resource forinvestigations of cross-correlations with other data libraries that may furtherconstrain sn ia physics and improve the effectiveness of sne ia as cosmologicaldistance indicators.

0908.1918	the fast declining type ia supernova 2003gs, and evidence for a  significant dispersion in near-infrared absolute magnitudes of fast decliners  at maximum light	we obtained optical photometry of sn 2003gs on 49 nights, from 2 to 494 daysafter t(b_max). we also obtained near-ir photometry on 21 nights. sn 2003gs wasthe first fast declining type ia sn that has been well observed since sn1999by. while it was subluminous in optical bands compared to more slowlydeclining type ia sne, it was not subluminous at maximum light in the near-irbands. there appears to be a bimodal distribution in the near-ir absolutemagnitudes of type ia sne at maximum light. those that peak in the near-irafter t(b_max) are subluminous in the all bands. those that peak in the near-irprior to t(b_max), such as sn 2003gs, have effectively the same near-irabsolute magnitudes at maximum light regardless of the decline rate deltam_15(b).  near-ir spectral evidence suggests that opacities in the outer layers of sn2003gs are reduced much earlier than for normal type ia sne. that may allowgamma rays that power the luminosity to escape more rapidly and accelerate thedecline rate. this conclusion is consistent with the photometric behavior of sn2003gs in the ir, which indicates a faster than normal decline fromapproximately normal peak brightness.

1001.2775	the transitional stripped-envelope sn 2008ax: spectral evolution and  evidence for large asphericity	supernova (sn) 2008ax in ngc 4490 was discovered within hours after shockbreakout, presenting the rare opportunity to study a core-collapse sn beginningwith the initial envelope-cooling phase immediately following shock breakout.we present an extensive sequence of optical and near-infrared spectra, as wellas three epochs of optical spectropolarimetry. our initial spectra, taken twodays after shock breakout, are dominated by hydrogen balmer lines at highvelocity. however, by maximum light, he i lines dominated the optical andnear-infrared spectra, which closely resembled those of normal type ibsupernovae (sne ib) such as sn 1999ex. this spectroscopic transition definestype iib supernovae, but the strong similarity of sn 2008ax to normal sne ibbeginning near maximum light, including an absorption feature near 6270a due toh-alpha at high velocities, suggests that many objects classified as sne ib inthe literature may have ejected similar amounts of hydrogen as sn 2008ax,roughly a few x 0.01 m_sun. early-time spectropolarimetry (6 and 9 days aftershock breakout) revealed strong line polarization modulations of 3.4% acrossh-alpha, indicating the presence of large asphericities in the outer ejecta.the continuum shares a common polarization angle with the hydrogen, helium, andoxygen lines, while the calcium and iron absorptions are oriented at differentangles. this is clear evidence of deviations from axisymmetry even in the outerejecta. intrinsic continuum polarization of 0.64% only nine days after shockbreakout shows that the outer layers of the ejecta were quite aspherical. asingle epoch of late-time spectropolarimetry, as well as the shapes of thenebular line profiles, demonstrate that asphericities extended from theoutermost layers all the way down to the center of this sn.

1103.1671	a study of carbon features in type ia supernova spectra	one of the major differences between various explosion scenarios of type iasupernovae (sne ia) is the remaining amount of unburned (c+o) material and itsvelocity distribution within the expanding ejecta. while oxygen absorptionfeatures are not uncommon in the spectra of sne ia before maximum light, thepresence of strong carbon absorption has been reported only in a minority ofobjects, typically during the pre-maximum phase. the reported low frequency ofcarbon detections may be due to low signal-to-noise data, low abundance ofunburned material, line blending between c ii 6580 and si ii 6355, ejectatemperature differences, asymmetrical distribution effects, or a combination ofthese. however, a survey of published pre-maximum spectra reveals that more sneia than previously thought may exhibit c ii 6580 absorption features and relicsof line blending near 6300 angstroms. here we present new sn ia observationswhere spectroscopic signatures of c ii 6580 are detected, and investigate thepresence of c ii 6580 in the optical spectra of 19 sne ia using theparameterized spectrum synthesis code, synow. most of the objects in our samplethat exhibit c ii 6580 absorption features are of the low-velocity gradientsubtype. our study indicates that the morphology of carbon-rich regions isconsistent with either a spherical distribution or a hemispheric asymmetry,supporting the recent idea that sn ia diversity may be a result of off-centerignition coupled with observer line-of-sight effects.

1109.0987	very early ultraviolet and optical observations of the type ia supernova  2009ig	supernova (sn) 2009ig was discovered 17 hours after explosion by the lickobservatory supernova search, promptly classified as a normal type ia sn (snia), peaked at v = 13.5 mag, and was equatorial, making it one of the foremostsupernovae for intensive study in the last decade. here, we present ultraviolet(uv) and optical observations of sn 2009ig, starting about 1 day afterexplosion until around maximum brightness. our data include excellent uv andoptical light curves, 25 premaximum optical spectra, and 8 uv spectra,including the earliest uv spectrum ever obtained of a sn ia. sn 2009ig is arelatively normal sn ia, but does display high-velocity ejecta - the ejectavelocity measured in our earliest spectra (v ~ -23,000 km/s for si ii 6355) isthe highest yet measured in a sn ia. the spectral evolution is very dramatic attimes earlier than 12 days before maximum brightness, but slows after thattime. the early-time data provide a precise measurement of 17.13 +/- 0.07 daysfor the sn rise time. the optical color curves and early-time spectra aresignificantly different from template light curves and spectra used forlight-curve fitting and k-corrections, indicating that the template lightcurves and spectra do not properly represent all type ia supernovae at veryearly times. in the age of wide-angle sky surveys, sne like sn 2009ig that arenearby, bright, well positioned, and promptly discovered will still be rare. asshown with sn 2009ig, detailed studies of single events can providesignificantly more information for testing systematic uncertainties related tosn ia distance estimates and constraining progenitor and explosion models thanlarge samples of more distant sne.

1111.0596	improved distance determination to m51 from supernovae 2011dh and 2005cs	the appearance of two recent supernovae, sn 2011dh and 2005cs, both in m51,provides an opportunity to derive an improved distance to their host galaxy bycombining the observations of both sne. we apply the expanding photospheremethod to get the distance to m51 by fitting the data of these two snesimultaneously. in order to correct for the effect of flux dilution, we usecorrection factors (zeta) appropriate for standard type ii-p sne atmospheresfor 2005cs, but find zeta ~ 1 for the type iib sn 2011dh, which may be due tothe reduced h-content of its ejecta. the epm analysis resulted in d_m51 = 8.4+/- 0.7 mpc. based on this improved distance, we also re-analyze the hstobservations of the proposed progenitor of sn 2011dh. we confirm that theobject detected on the pre-explosion hst-images is unlikely to be a compactstellar cluster. in addition, its derived radius (~ 277$ r_sun) is too largefor being the real (exploded) progenitor of sn 2011dh. the supernova-baseddistance, d = 8.4 mpc, is in good agreement with other recent distanceestimates to m51.

1205.0252	an ultraviolet-optical flare from the tidal disruption of a helium-rich  stellar core	the flare of radiation from the tidal disruption and accretion of a star canbe used as a marker for supermassive black holes that otherwise lie dormant andundetected in the centres of distant galaxies. previous candidate flares havehad declining light curves in good agreement with expectations, but with poorconstraints on the time of disruption and the type of star disrupted, becausethe rising emission was not observed. recently, two `relativistic' candidatetidal disruption events were discovered, each of whose extreme x-ray luminosityand synchrotron radio emission were interpreted as the onset of emission from arelativistic jet. here we report the discovery of a luminousultraviolet-optical flare from the nuclear region of an inactive galaxy at aredshift of 0.1696. the observed continuum is cooler than expected for a simpleaccreting debris disk, but the well-sampled rise and decline of its light curvefollows the predicted mass accretion rate, and can be modelled to determine thetime of disruption to an accuracy of two days. the black hole has a mass ofabout 2 million solar masses, modulo a factor dependent on the mass and radiusof the star disrupted. on the basis of the spectroscopic signature of ionizedhelium from the unbound debris, we determine that the disrupted star was ahelium-rich stellar core.

1206.1328	the very young type ia supernova 2012cg: discovery and early-time  follow-up observations	on 2012 may 17.2 ut, only 1.5 +/- 0.2 d after explosion, we discovered sn2012cg, a type ia supernova (sn ia) in ngc 4424 (d ~ 15 mpc). as a result ofthe newly modified strategy employed by the lick observatory sn search, asequence of filtered images was obtained starting 161 s after discovery.utilizing recent models describing the interaction of sn ejecta with acompanion star, we rule out a ~1 m_sun companion for half of all viewing anglesand a red-giant companion for nearly all orientations. sn 2012cg reached ab-band maximum of 12.09 +/- 0.02 mag on 2012 june 2.0 and took ~17.3 d fromexplosion to reach this, typical for sne ia. our pre-maximum brightnessphotometry shows a narrower-than-average b-band light curve for sn 2012cg,though slightly overluminous at maximum brightness and with normal colorevolution (including some of the earliest sn ia filtered photometry everobtained). spectral fits to sn 2012cg reveal ions typically found in sne ia atearly times, with expansion velocities &gt;14,000 km/s at 2.5 d past explosion.absorption from c ii is detected early, as well as high-velocity components ofboth si ii 6355 ang. and ca ii. our last spectrum (13.5 d past explosion)resembles that of the somewhat peculiar sn ia 1999aa. this suggests that sn2012cg will have a slower-than-average declining light curve, which may besurprising given the faster-than-average rising light curve.

1206.4050	ultra-luminous supernovae as a new probe of the interstellar medium in  distant galaxies	we present the pan-starrs1 discovery and light curves, and follow-up mmt andgemini spectroscopy of an ultra-luminous supernova (ulsn; dubbed ps1-11bam) ata redshift of z=1.566 with a peak brightness of m_uv=-22.3 mag. ps1-11bam isone of the highest redshift spectroscopically-confirmed sne known to date. thespectrum is characterized by broad absorption features typical of previousulsne (e.g., cii, siiii), and by strong and narrow mgii and feii absorptionlines from the interstellar medium (ism) of the host galaxy, confirmed by an[oii]3727 emission line at the same redshift. the equivalent widths of thefeii2600 and mgii2803 lines are in the top quartile of the quasar interveningabsorption system distribution, but are weaker than those of gamma-ray burstintrinsic absorbers (i.e., grb host galaxies). we also detect the host galaxyin pre-explosion pan-starrs1 data and find that its uv spectral energydistribution is best fit with a young stellar population age of tau~15-45 myrand a stellar mass of m \sim (1.1-2.6)x10^9 m_sun (for z=0.05-1 z_sun). thestar formation rate inferred from the uv continuum and [oii]3727 emission lineis ~10 m_sun/yr, higher than in any previous ulsn host. ps1-11bam provides thefirst direct demonstration that ulsne can serve as probes of the interstellarmedium in distant galaxies. at the present, the depth and red sensitivity ofps1 are uniquely suited to finding such events at cosmologically interestingredshifts (z~1-2); the future combination of lsst and 30-m class telescopespromises to extend this technique to z~4.

1207.4310	testing sne ia distance measurement methods with sn 2011fe	the nearby, bright, almost completely unreddened type ia supernova 2011fe inm101 provides a unique opportunity to test both the precision and the accuracyof the extragalactic distances derived from sne ia light curve fitters. weapply the current, public versions of the independent light curve fitting codesmlcs2k2 and salt2 to compute the distance modulus of sn 2011fe fromhigh-precision, multi-color (bvri) light curves. the results from the twofitting codes confirm that 2011fe is a "normal" (not peculiar) and onlyslightly reddened sn ia. new unreddened distance moduli are derived as 29.21+/- 0.07 mag (d ~ 6.95 +/- 0.23$ mpc, mlcs2k2), and 29.05 +/- 0.07 mag (6.46+/- 0.21 mpc, salt2). despite the very good fitting quality achieved with bothlight curve fitters, the resulting distance moduli are inconsistent by 2 sigma.both are marginally consistent (at ~1 sigma) with the hst key project distancemodulus for m101. the salt2 distance is in good agreement with the recentlyrevised cepheid- and trgb-distance to m101. averaging all sn- and cepheid-basedestimates, the absolute distance to m101 is ~6.6 +/- 0.5 mpc.

1301.6287	the earliest near-infrared time-series spectroscopy of a type ia  supernova	we present ten medium-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio near-infrared(nir) spectra of sn 2011fe from spex on the nasa infrared telescope facility(irtf) and gemini near-infrared spectrograph (gnirs) on gemini north, obtainedas part of the carnegie supernova project. this data set constitutes theearliest time-series nir spectroscopy of a type ia supernova (sn ia), with thefirst spectrum obtained at 2.58 days past the explosion and covering -14.6 to+17.3 days relative to b-band maximum. c i {\lambda}1.0693 {\mu}m is detectedin sn 2011fe with increasing strength up to maximum light. the delay in theonset of the nir c i line demonstrates its potential to be an effective tracerof unprocessed material. for the first time in a sn ia, the early rapid declineof the mg ii {\lambda}1.0927 {\mu}m velocity was observed, and the subsequentvelocity is remarkably constant. the mg ii velocity during this constant phaselocates the inner edge of carbon burning and probes the conditions under whichthe transition from deflagration to detonation occurs. we show that the mg iivelocity does not correlate with the optical light-curve decline rate{\delta}m15. the prominent break at ~1.5 {\mu}m is the main source of concernfor nir k-correction calculations. we demonstrate here that the feature has auniform time evolution among sne ia, with the flux ratio across the breakstrongly correlated with {\delta}m15. the predictability of the strength andthe onset of this feature suggests that the associated k-correctionuncertainties can be minimized with improved spectral templates.

1302.0009	ps1-10afx at z=1.388: pan-starrs1 discovery of a new type of  superluminous supernova	we present the pan-starrs1 discovery of ps1-10afx, a uniquehydrogen-deficient superluminous supernova (slsn) at z=1.388. the light curvepeaked at z_p1=21.7 mag, making ps1-10afx comparable to the most luminous knownsne, with m_u = -22.3 mag. our extensive optical and nir observations indicatethat the bolometric light curve of ps1-10afx rose on the unusually fasttimescale of ~12 d to the extraordinary peak luminosity of 4.1e44 erg/s (m_bol= -22.8 mag) and subsequently faded rapidly. equally important, the sed isunusually red for a slsn, with a color temperature of 6800 k near maximumlight, in contrast to previous h-poor slsne, which are bright in the uv. thespectra more closely resemble those of a normal sn ic than any known slsn, witha photospheric velocity of 11,000 km/s and evidence for line blanketing in therest-frame uv. despite the fast rise, these parameters imply a very largeemitting radius (&gt;5e15 cm). we demonstrate that no existing theoretical modelcan satisfactorily explain this combination of properties: (i) a nickel-poweredlight curve cannot match the combination of high peak luminosity with the fasttimescale; (ii) models powered by the spindown energy of a rapidly-rotatingmagnetar predict significantly hotter and faster ejecta; and (iii) modelsinvoking shock breakout through a dense circumstellar medium cannot explain theobserved spectra or color evolution. the host galaxy is well detected inpre-explosion imaging with a luminosity near l*, a star formation rate of 15m_sun/yr, and is fairly massive (2e10 m_sun), with a stellar population age of1e8 yr, also in contrast to the dwarf hosts of known h-poor slsne. ps1-10afx isdistinct from known examples of slsne in its spectra, colors, light-curveshape, and host galaxy properties, suggesting that it resulted from a differentchannel than other hydrogen-poor slsne.

1302.3537	high-velocity line forming regions in the type ia supernova 2009ig	we report measurements and analysis of high-velocity (&gt; 20,000 km/s) andphotospheric absorption features in a series of spectra of the type iasupernova (sn) 2009ig obtained between -14d and +13d with respect to the timeof maximum b-band luminosity. we identify lines of si ii, si iii, s ii, ca iiand fe ii that produce both high-velocity (hvf) and photospheric-velocity (pvf)absorption features. sn 2009ig is unusual for the large number of lines withdetectable hvf in the spectra, but the light-curve parameters correspond to aslightly overluminous but unexceptional sn ia (m_b = -19.46 mag and delta_m15(b) = 0.90 mag). similarly, the si ii lambda_6355 velocity at the time of b-maxis greater than "normal" for a sn ia, but it is not extreme (v_si = 13,400km/s). the -14d and -13d spectra clearly resolve hvf from si ii lambda_6355 asseparate absorptions from a detached line forming region. at these very earlyphases, detached hvf are prevalent in all lines. from -12d to -6d, hvf and pvfare detected simultaneously, and the two line forming regions maintain aconstant separation of about 8,000 km/s. after -6d all absorption features arepvf. the observations of sn 2009ig provide a complete picture of the transitionfrom hvf to pvf. most sn ia show evidence for hvf from multiple lines inspectra obtained before -10d, and we compare the spectra of sn 2009ig toobservations of other sn. we show that each of the unusual line profiles for siii lambda_6355 found in early-time spectra of sn ia correlate to a specificphase in a common development sequence from hvf to pvf.

1306.0038	a panchromatic view of the restless sn2009ip reveals the explosive  ejection of a massive star envelope	the 2012 explosion of sn2009ip raises questions about our understanding ofthe late stages of massive star evolution. here we present a comprehensivestudy of sn2009ip during its remarkable re-brightening(s). high-cadencephotometric and spectroscopic observations from the gev to the radio bandobtained from a variety of ground-based and space facilities (including thevla, swift, fermi, hst and xmm) constrain sn2009ip to be a low energy (e~ 10^50erg for an ejecta mass ~ 0.5 msun) and likely asymmetric explosion in a complexmedium shaped by multiple eruptions of the restless progenitor star. most ofthe energy is radiated as a result of the shock breaking out through a denseshell of material located at 5x10^14 cm with m~0.1 msun, ejected by theprecursor outburst ~40 days before the major explosion. we interpret the nirexcess of emission as signature of dust vaporization of material locatedfurther out (r&gt;4x 10^15 cm), the origin of which has to be connected withdocumented mass loss episodes in the previous years. our modeling predictsbright neutrino emission associated with the shock break-out if the cosmic rayenergy is comparable to the radiated energy. we connect this phenomenology withthe explosive ejection of the outer layers of the massive progenitor star, thatlater interacted with material deposited in the surroundings by previouseruptions. future observations will reveal if the luminous blue variable (lbv)progenitor star survived. irrespective of whether the explosion was terminal,sn2009ip brought to light the existence of new channels for sustained episodicmass-loss, the physical origin of which has yet to be identified.

1309.3009	the uv-bright, slowly declining transient ps1-11af as a partial tidal  disruption event	we present the pan-starrs1 discovery of the long-lived and blue transientps1-11af, which was also detected by galex with coordinated observations in thenear-ultraviolet (nuv) band. ps1-11af is associated with the nucleus of anearly-type galaxy at redshift z=0.4046 that exhibits no evidence for starformation or agn activity. four epochs of spectroscopy reveal a pair oftransient broad absorption features in the uv on otherwise featureless spectra.despite the superficial similarity of these features to p-cygni absorptions ofsupernovae (sne), we conclude that ps1-11af is not consistent with theproperties of known types of sne. blackbody fits to the spectral energydistribution are inconsistent with the cooling, expanding ejecta of a sn, andthe velocities of the absorption features are too high to represent material inhomologous expansion near a sn photosphere. however, the constant blue colorsand slow evolution of the luminosity are similar to previous optically-selectedtidal disruption events (tdes). the shape of the optical light curve isconsistent with models for tdes, but the minimum accreted mass necessary topower the observed luminosity is only ~0.002m_sun, which points to a partialdisruption model. a full disruption model predicts higher bolometricluminosities, which would require most of the radiation to be emitted in aseparate component at high energies where we lack observations. in addition,the observed temperature is lower than that predicted by pure accretion diskmodels for tdes and requires reprocessing to a constant, lower temperature.three deep non-detections in the radio with the vla over the first two yearsafter the event set strict limits on the production of any relativistic outflowcomparable to swift j1644+57, even if off-axis.

1310.3824	systematic uncertainties associated with the cosmological analysis of  the first pan-starrs1 type ia supernova sample	we probe the systematic uncertainties from 113 type ia supernovae (snia) inthe pan-starrs1 (ps1) sample along with 197 sn ia from a combination oflow-redshift surveys. the companion paper by rest et al. (2013) describes thephotometric measurements and cosmological inferences from the ps1 sample. thelargest systematic uncertainty stems from the photometric calibration of theps1 and low-z samples. we increase the sample of observed calspec standardsfrom 7 to 10 used to define the ps1 calibration system. the ps1 and sdss-iicalibration systems are compared and discrepancies up to ~0.02 mag arerecovered. we find uncertainties in the proper way to treat intrinsic colorsand reddening produce differences in the recovered value of w up to 3%. weestimate masses of host galaxies of ps1 supernovae and detect an insignificantdifference in distance residuals of the full sample of 0.037\pm0.031 mag forhost galaxies with high and low masses. assuming flatness in our analysis ofonly sne measurements, we find $w = {-1.120^{+0.360}_{-0.206}\textrm{(stat)}^{+0.269}_{-0.291}\textrm{(sys)}}$. with additional constraints from bao,cmb(planck) and h0 measurements, we find $w = -1.166^{+0.072}_{-0.069}$ and$\omega_m=0.280^{+0.013}_{-0.012}$ (statistical and systematic errors added inquadrature). significance of the inconsistency with $w=-1$ depends on whetherwe use planck or wmap measurements of the cmb:$w_{\textrm{bao+h0+sn+wmap}}=-1.124^{+0.083}_{-0.065}$.

1310.3828	cosmological constraints from measurements of type ia supernovae  discovered during the first 1.5 years of the pan-starrs1 survey	we present griz light curves of 146 spectroscopically confirmed type iasupernovae ($0.03 &lt; z &lt;0.65$) discovered during the first 1.5 years of thepan-starrs1 medium deep survey. the pan-starrs1 natural photometric system isdetermined by a combination of on-site measurements of the instrument responsefunction and observations of spectrophotometric standard stars. we find thatthe systematic uncertainties in the photometric system are currently 1.2\%without accounting for the uncertainty in the hst calspec definition of the absystem. a hubble diagram is constructed with a subset of 113 out of 146 sne iathat pass our light curve quality cuts. the cosmological fit to 310 sne ia (113ps1 sne ia + 222 light curves from 197 low-z sne ia), using only sne andassuming a constant dark energy equation of state and flatness, yields$w=-1.120^{+0.360}_{-0.206}\textrm{(stat)} ^{+0.269}_{-0.291}\textrm{(sys)}$.when combined with bao+cmb(planck)+$h_0$, the analysis yields $\omega_{\rmm}=0.280^{+0.013}_{-0.012}$ and $w=-1.166^{+0.072}_{-0.069}$ including allidentified systematics (see also scolnic et al. 2014). the value of $w$ isinconsistent with the cosmological constant value of $-1$ at the 2.3$\sigma$level. tension endures after removing either the bao or the $h_0$ constraint,though it is strongest when including the $h_0$ constraint. if we include wmap9cmb constraints instead of those from planck, we find$w=-1.124^{+0.083}_{-0.065}$, which diminishes the discord to $&lt;2\sigma$. wecannot conclude whether the tension with flat $\lambda$cdm is a feature of darkenergy, new physics, or a combination of chance and systematic errors. the fullpan-starrs1 supernova sample with $\sim\!\!$3 times as many sne should providemore conclusive results.

1311.0026	hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae and long-duration gamma-ray  bursts have similar host galaxies	we present optical spectroscopy and optical/near-ir photometry of 31 hostgalaxies of hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (slsne), including 15 eventsfrom the pan-starrs1 medium deep survey. our sample spans the redshift range0.1 &lt; z &lt; 1.6 and is the first comprehensive host galaxy study of this specificsubclass of cosmic explosions. combining the multi-band photometry andemission-line measurements, we determine the luminosities, stellar masses, starformation rates and metallicities. we find that as a whole, the hosts of slsneare a low-luminosity (&lt;m_b&gt; ~ -17.3 mag), low stellar mass (&lt;m_*&gt; ~ 2 x 10^8m_sun) population, with a high median specific star formation rate (&lt;ssfr&gt; ~ 2gyr^-1). the median metallicity of our spectroscopic sample is low, 12 +log(o/h}) ~ 8.35 ~ 0.45 z_sun, although at least one host galaxy has solarmetallicity. the host galaxies of h-poor slsne are statistically distinct fromthe hosts of goods core-collapse sne (which cover a similar redshift range),but resemble the host galaxies of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs) interms of stellar mass, sfr, ssfr and metallicity. this result indicates thatthe environmental causes leading to massive stars forming either slsne or lgrbsare similar, and in particular that slsne are more effectively formed in lowmetallicity environments. we speculate that the key ingredient is large coreangular momentum, leading to a rapidly-spinning magnetar in slsne and anaccreting black hole in lgrbs.

1312.6617	high density circumstellar interaction in the luminous type iin sn  2010jl: the first 1100 days	hst and ground based observations of the type iin sn 2010jl are analyzed,including photometry, spectroscopy in the ultraviolet, optical and nir bands,26-1128 days after first detection. at maximum the bolometric luminosity was$\sim 3\times10^{43}$ erg/s and even at 850 days exceeds $10^{42}$ erg/s. a nirexcess, dominating after 400 days, probably originates in dust in thecircumstellar medium (csm). the total radiated energy is $&gt; 6.5\times10^{50}$ergs, excluding the dust component. the spectral lines can be separated intoone broad component due to electron scattering, and one narrow with expansionvelocity $\sim 100$ km/s from the csm. the broad component is initiallysymmetric around zero velocity but becomes blueshifted after $\sim 50$ days,while remaining symmetric about a shifted centroid velocity. dust absorption inthe ejecta is unlikely to explain the line shifts, and we attribute the shiftinstead to acceleration by the sn radiation. from the optical lines and thex-ray and dust properties, there is strong evidence for large scale asymmetriesin the csm. the ultraviolet lines indicate cno processing in the progenitor,while the optical shows a number of narrow coronal lines excited by the x-rays.the bolometric light curve is consistent with a radiative shock in an $r^{-2}$csm with a mass loss rate of $\sim 0.1$ m_sun/yr. the total mass lost is $&gt; 3$m_sun. these properties are consistent with the sn expanding into a csmcharacteristic of an lbv progenitor with a bipolar geometry. the apparentabsence of nuclear processing is attributed to a csm still opaque to electronscattering.

1401.2991	interaction between the broad-lined type ic supernova 2012ap and  carriers of diffuse interstellar bands	the diffuse interstellar bands (dibs) are absorption features observed inoptical and near-infrared spectra that are thought to be associated withcarbon-rich polyatomic molecules in interstellar gas. however, because thecentral wavelengths of these bands do not correspond with electronictransitions of any known atomic or molecular species, their nature has remaineduncertain since their discovery almost a century ago. here we report onunusually strong dibs in optical spectra of the broad-lined type ic supernovasn 2012ap that exhibit changes in equivalent width over short (~30 days)timescales. the 4428 and 6283 angstrom dib features get weaker with time,whereas the 5780 angstrom feature shows a marginal increase. these nonuniformchanges suggest that the supernova is interacting with a nearby source of thedibs and that the dib carriers possess high ionization potentials, such assmall cations or charged fullerenes. we conclude that moderate-resolutionspectra of supernovae with dib absorptions obtained within weeks of outburstcould reveal unique information about the mass-loss environment of theirprogenitor systems and provide new constraints on the properties of dibcarriers.

1403.0651	near-ir studies of recurrent nova v745 scorpii during its 2014 outburst	the recurrent nova (rn) v745 scorpii underwent its third known outburst on2014 february 6. infrared monitoring of the eruption on an almost daily basis,starting from 1.3d after discovery, shows the emergence of a powerful blastwave generated by the high velocity nova ejecta exceeding 4000 kms$^{-1}$plowing into its surrounding environment. the temperature of the shocked gas israised to a high value exceeding 10$^{8}$k immediately after outburstcommencement. the energetics of the outburst clearly surpass those of similarsymbiotic systems like rs oph and v407 cyg which have giant secondaries. theshock does not show a free-expansion stage but rather shows a decelerativesedov-taylor phase from the beginning. such strong shockfronts are known to besites for $\gamma$ ray generation. v745 sco is the latest nova, apart from fiveother known novae, to show $\gamma$ ray emission. it may be an importanttestbed to resolve the crucial question whether all novae are generically$\gamma$ ray emitters by virtue of having a circumbinary reservoir of materialthat is shocked by the ejecta rather than $\gamma$ ray generation beingrestricted to only symbiotic systems with a shocked red giant (rg) wind. thelack of a free-expansion stage favors v745 sco to have a density enhancementaround the white dwarf (wd), above that contributed by a rg wind. our analysisalso suggests that the wd in v745 sco is very massive and a potentialprogenitor for a future sn ia explosion.

1404.2004	towards characterization of the type iip supernova progenitor  population: a statistical sample of light curves from pan-starrs1	in recent years, wide-field sky surveys providing deep multi-band imaginghave presented a new path for indirectly characterizing the progenitorpopulations of core-collapse supernovae (sn): systematic light curve studies.we assemble a set of 76 grizy-band type iip sn light curves from pan-starrs1,obtained over a constant survey program of 4 years and classified using bothspectroscopy and machine learning-based photometric techniques. we develop andapply a new bayesian model for the full multi-band evolution of each lightcurve in the sample. we find no evidence of a sub-population of fast-decliningexplosions (historically referred to as "type iil" sne). however, we identify ahighly significant relation between the plateau phase decay rate and peakluminosity among our sne iip. these results argue in favor of a singleparameter, likely determined by initial stellar mass, predominantly controllingthe explosions of red supergiants. this relation could also be applied forsupernova cosmology, offering a standardizable candle good to an intrinsicscatter of 0.2 mag. we compare each light curve to physical models fromhydrodynamic simulations to estimate progenitor initial masses and otherproperties of the pan-starrs1 type iip sn sample. we show that correction ofsystematic discrepancies between modeled and observed sn iip light curveproperties and an expanded grid of progenitor properties, are needed to enablerobust progenitor inferences from multi-band light curve samples of this kind.this work will serve as a pathfinder for photometric studies of core-collapsesne to be conducted through future wide field transient searches.

1405.3668	rapidly-evolving and luminous transients from pan-starrs1	in the past decade, several rapidly-evolving transients have been discoveredwhose timescales and luminosities are not easily explained by traditionalsupernovae (sn) models. the sample size of these objects has remained smalldue, at least in part, to the challenge of detecting short timescale transientswith traditional survey cadences. here we present the results from a searchwithin the pan-starrs1 medium deep survey (ps1-mds) for rapidly-evolving andluminous transients. we identify 10 new transients with a time abovehalf-maximum of less than 12 days and -16.5 &gt; m &gt; -20 mag. this increases thenumber of known events in this region of sn phase space by roughly a factor ofthree. the median redshift of the ps1-mds sample is z=0.275 and they allexploded in star forming galaxies. in general, the transients possess fasterrise than decline timescale and blue colors at maximum light (g - r &lt; -0.2).best fit blackbodies reveal photospheric temperatures/radii that expand/coolwith time and explosion spectra taken near maximum light are dominated by ablue continuum, consistent with a hot, optically thick, ejecta. we find itdifficult to reconcile the short timescale, high peak luminosity (l &gt; 10^43erg/s), and lack of uv line blanketing observed in many of these transientswith an explosion powered mainly by the radioactive decay of ni-56. rather, wefind that many are consistent with either (1) cooling envelope emission fromthe explosion of a star with a low-mass extended envelope which ejected verylittle (&lt;0.03 m_sun) radioactive material, or (2) a shock breakout within adense, optically thick, wind surrounding the progenitor star. after calculatingthe detection efficiency for objects with rapid timescales in the ps1-mds wefind a volumetric rate of 4800 - 8000 events/yr/gpc^3 (4-7% of thecore-collapse sn rate at z=0.2).

1405.3677	extensive hst ultraviolet spectra and multi-wavelength observations of  sn 2014j in m82 indicate reddening and circumstellar scattering by typical  dust	sn 2014j in m82 is the closest detected type ia supernova (sn ia) in at least28 years and perhaps in 410 years. despite its small distance of 3.3 mpc, sn2014j is surprisingly faint, peaking at v = 10.6 mag, and assuming a typical snia luminosity, we infer an observed visual extinction of a_v = 2.0 +/- 0.1 mag.but this picture, with r_v = 1.6 +/- 0.2, is too simple to account for allobservations. we combine 10 epochs (spanning a month) of hst/stis ultravioletthrough near-infrared spectroscopy with hst/wfc3, kait, and fancam photometryfrom the optical to the infrared and 9 epochs of high-resolution tresspectroscopy to investigate the sources of extinction and reddening for sn2014j. we argue that the wide range of observed properties for sn 2014j iscaused by a combination of dust reddening, likely originating in theinterstellar medium of m82, and scattering off circumstellar material. for thismodel, roughly half of the extinction is caused by reddening from typical dust(e(b-v ) = 0.45 mag and r_v = 2.6) and roughly half by scattering off lmc-likedust in the circumstellar environment of sn 2014j.

1405.3970	early observations and analysis of the type ia sn 2014j in m82	we present optical and near infrared (nir) observations of the nearby type iasn 2014j. seventeen optical and twenty-three nir spectra were obtained from 10days before ($-$10d) to 10 days after (+10d) the time of maximum $b$-bandbrightness. the relative strengths of absorption features and their patterns ofdevelopment can be compared at one day intervals throughout most of thisperiod. carbon is not detected in the optical spectra, but we identify ci$\lambda$ 1.0693 in the nir spectra. we find that mgii lines with highoscillator strengths have higher initial velocities than other mgii lines. weshow that the velocity differences can be explained by differences in opticaldepths due to oscillator strengths. the spectra of sn 2014j show it is a normalsn ia, but many parameters are near the boundaries between normal andhigh-velocity subclasses. the velocities for oi, mgii, siii, sii, caii and feiisuggest that sn 2014j has a layered structure with little or no mixing. thatresult is consistent with the delayed detonation explosion models. we alsoreport photometric observations, obtained from $-$10d to +29d, in the $ubvrijh$and $k_s$ bands. sn 2014j is about 3 magnitudes fainter than a normal sn ia atthe distance of m82, which we attribute to extinction in the host. the templatefitting package snoopy is used to interpret the light curves and to derivephotometric parameters. using $r_v$ = 1.46, which is consistent with previousstudies, snoopy finds that $a_v = 1.80$ for $e(b-v)_{host}=1.23 \pm 0.01$ mag.the maximum $b$-band brightness of $-19.19 \pm 0.10$ mag was reached onfebruary 1.74 ut $ \pm 0.13$ days and the supernova had a decline parameter of$\delta m_{15}=1.11 \pm 0.02$ mag.

1408.1089	a luminous, blue progenitor system for a type-iax supernova	type-iax supernovae (sn iax) are stellar explosions that arespectroscopically similar to some type-ia supernovae (sn ia) at maximum light,except with lower ejecta velocities. they are also distinguished by lowerluminosities. at late times, their spectroscopic properties diverge from othersn, but their composition (dominated by iron-group and intermediate-masselements) suggests a physical connection to normal sn ia. these are not rare;sn iax occur at a rate between 5 and 30% of the normal sn ia rate. the leadingmodels for sn iax are thermonuclear explosions of accreting carbon-oxygen whitedwarfs that do not completely unbind the star, implying they are "lesssuccessful" cousins of normal sn ia, where complete disruption is observed.here we report the detection of the luminous, blue progenitor system of thetype-iax sn 2012z in deep pre-explosion imaging. its luminosity, colors,environment, and similarity to the progenitor of the galactic helium nova v445puppis, suggest that sn 2012z was the explosion of a white dwarf accreting froma helium-star companion. observations in the next few years, after sn 2012z hasfaded, could test this hypothesis, or alternatively show that this supernovawas actually the explosive death of a massive star.

1408.6239	on the nature of type ia-csm supernovae: optical and near-infrared  spectra of sn 2012ca and sn 2013dn	a growing subset of type ia supernovae (sne ia) show evidence for unexpectedinteraction with a dense circumstellar medium (sne ia-csm). the precise natureof the progenitor, however, remains debated owing to spectral ambiguitiesarising from a strong contribution from the csm interaction. late-time spectraoffer potential insight if the post-shock cold, dense shell becomessufficiently thin and/or the ejecta begin to cross the reverse shock. to date,few high-quality spectra of this kind exist. here we report on the late-timeoptical and infrared spectra of the sne~ia-csm 2012ca and 2013dn. these sneia-csm spectra exhibit low [fe iii]/[fe ii] ratios and strong [ca ii] at lateepochs. such characteristics are reminiscent of the super-chandrasekhar-mass(sc) candidate sn 2009dc, for which these features suggested a low-ionisationstate due to high densities, although the broad fe features admittedly showsimilarities to the blue "quasi-continuum" observed in some core-collapse sneibn and iin. neither sn 2012ca nor any of the other sne ia-csm show evidencefor broad oxygen, carbon, or magnesium in their spectra. similar to theinteracting type iin sn 2005ip, a number of high-ionisation lines areidentified in sn 2012ca, including [s iii], [ar iii], [ar x], [fe viii], [fex], and possibly [fe xi]. the total bolometric energy output does not exceed10^51 erg, but does require a large kinetic-to-radiative conversion efficiency.all of these observations taken together suggest that sne ia-csm are moreconsistent with a thermonuclear explosion than a core-collapse event, althoughdetailed radiative transfer models are certainly necessary to confirm theseresults.

1410.6014	a luminous, fast rising uv-transient discovered by rotse: a tidal  disruption event?	we present follow-up observations of an optical transient (ot) discovered byrotse on jan. 21, 2009. photometric monitoring was carried out with rotse-iiibin the optical and swift in the uv up to +70 days after discovery. the lightcurve showed a fast rise time of ~10 days followed by a steep decline over thenext 60 days, which was much faster than that implied by 56ni - 56coradioactive decay. the sdss dr10 database contains a faint, red object at theposition of the ot, which appears slightly extended. this and other lines ofevidence suggest that the ot is of extragalactic origin, and this faint objectis likely the host galaxy. a sequence of optical spectra obtained with the9.2-m hobby-eberly telescope (het) between +8 and +45 days after discoveryrevealed a hot, blue continuum with no visible spectral features. a few weakfeatures that appeared after +30 days probably originated from the underlyinghost. fitting synthetic templates to the observed spectrum of the host galaxyrevealed a redshift of z = 0.19. at this redshift the peak magnitude of the otis close to -22.5, similar to the brightest super-luminous supernovae; however,the lack of identifiable spectral features makes the massive stellar deathhypothesis less likely. a more plausible explanation appears to be the tidaldisruption of a sun-like star by the central super-massive black hole. we arguethat this transient likely belongs to a class of super-eddington tidaldisruption events.

1411.1060	zooming in on the progenitors of superluminous supernovae with the hst	we present hubble space telescope (hst) rest-frame ultraviolet imaging of thehost galaxies of 16 hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (slsne), including11 events from the pan-starrs medium deep survey. taking advantage of thesuperb angular resolution of hst, we characterize the galaxies' morphologicalproperties, sizes and star formation rate (sfr) densities. we determine thesupernova (sn) locations within the host galaxies through precise astrometricmatching, and measure physical and host-normalized offsets, as well as the snpositions within the cumulative distribution of uv light pixel brightness. wefind that the host galaxies of h-poor slsne are irregular, compact dwarfgalaxies, with a median half-light radius of just 0.9 kpc. the uv-derived sfrdensities are high (&lt;sigma_sfr&gt; ~ 0.1 m_sun/yr/kpc^2), suggesting that slsneform in overdense environments. their locations trace the uv light of theirhost galaxies, with a distribution intermediate between that of long-durationgamma-ray bursts (lgrbs) (which are strongly clustered on the brightest regionsof their hosts) and a uniform distribution (characteristic of normalcore-collapse sne), though cannot be statistically distinguished from eitherwith the current sample size. taken together, this strengthens the picture thatslsn progenitors require different conditions than those of ordinarycore-collapse sne to form, and that they explode in broadly similar galaxies asdo lgrbs. if the tendency for slsne to be less clustered on the brightestregions than are lgrbs is confirmed by a larger sample, this would indicate adifferent, potentially lower-mass progenitor for slsne than lrgbs.

1501.01314	selection of burst-like transients and stochastic variables using  multi-band image differencing in the pan-starrs1 medium-deep survey	we present a novel method for the light-curve characterization of pan-starrs1medium deep survey (ps1 mds) extragalactic sources into stochastic variables(sv) and burst-like (bl) transients, using multi-band image-differencingtime-series data. we select detections in difference images associated withgalaxy hosts using a star/galaxy catalog extracted from the deep ps1 mdsstacked images, and adopt a maximum a posteriori formulation to model theirdifference-flux time-series in four pan-starrs1 photometric bands g,r,i, and z.we use three deterministic light-curve models to fit burst-like transients andone stochastic light curve model, the ornstein-uhlenbeck process, in order tofit variability that is characteristic of active galactic nuclei (agn). weassess the quality of fit of the models band-wise source-wise, using theirestimated leave-out-one cross-validation likelihoods and corrected akaikeinformation criteria. we then apply a k-means clustering algorithm on thesestatistics, to determine the source classification in each band. the finalsource classification is derived as a combination of the individual filterclassifications. we use our clustering method to characterize 4361extragalactic image difference detected sources in the first 2.5 years of theps1 mds, into 1529 bl, and 2262 sv, with a purity of 95.00% for agn, and 90.97%for sn based on our verification sets. we combine our light-curveclassifications with their nuclear or off-nuclear host galaxy offsets, todefine a robust photometric sample of 1233 active galactic nuclei and 812supernovae. we use these samples to identify simple photometric priors thatwould enable their real-time identification in future wide-field synopticsurveys.

1501.06491	supernova 2013by: a type iil supernova with a iip-like light curve drop	we present multi-band ultraviolet and optical light curves, as well asvisual-wavelength and near-infrared spectroscopy of the type ii linear (iil)supernova (sn) 2013by. we show that sn 2013by and other sne iil in theliterature, after their linear decline phase that start after maximum, have asharp light curve decline similar to that seen in type ii plateau (iip)supernovae. this light curve feature has rarely been observed in other sne iildue to their relative rarity and the intrinsic faintness of this particularphase of the light curve. we suggest that the presence of this drop could beused as a physical parameter to distinguish between subclasses of sne ii,rather than their light curve decline rate shortly after peak. close inspectionof the spectra of sn 2013by indicate asymmetric line profiles and signatures ofhigh-velocity hydrogen. late (less than 90 days after explosion) near-infraredspectra of sn 2013by exhibit oxygen lines, indicating significant mixing withinthe ejecta. from the late-time light curve, we estimate that 0.029 solar massof 56ni was synthesized during the explosion. it is also shown that the v -bandlight curve slope is responsible for part of the scatter in the luminosity (vmagnitude 50 days after explosion) vs. 56ni relation. our observations of sn2013by and other sne iil through the onset of the nebular phase indicate thattheir progenitors are similar to those of sne iip.

1502.07278	high-velocity features of calcium and silicon in the spectra of type ia  supernovae	"high-velocity features" (hvfs) are spectral features in type ia supernovae(sne ia) that have minima indicating significantly higher (by greater thanabout 6000 km/s) velocities than typical "photospheric-velocity features"(pvfs). the pvfs are absorption features with minima indicating typicalphotospheric (i.e., bulk ejecta) velocities (usually ~9000-15,000 km/s nearb-band maximum brightness). in this work we undertake the most in-depth studyof hvfs ever performed. the dataset used herein consists of 445 low-resolutionoptical and near-infrared (nir) spectra (at epochs up to 5 d past maximumbrightness) of 210 low-redshift sne ia that follow the "phillips relation." aseries of gaussian functions is fit to the data in order to characterisepossible hvfs of ca ii h&amp;k, si ii {\lambda}6355, and the ca ii nir triplet. thetemporal evolution of the velocities and strengths of the pvfs and hvfs ofthese three spectral features is investigated, as are possible correlationswith other sn ia observables. we find that while hvfs of ca ii are regularlyobserved (except in underluminous sne ia, where they are never found), hvfs ofsi ii {\lambda}6355 are significantly rarer, and they tend to exist at theearliest epochs and mostly in objects with large photospheric velocities. it isalso shown that stronger hvfs of si ii {\lambda}6355 are found in objects thatlack c ii absorption at early times and that have red ultraviolet/opticalcolours near maximum brightness. these results lead to a self-consistentconnection between the presence and strength of hvfs of si ii {\lambda}6355 andmany other mutually correlated sn~ia observables, including photosphericvelocity.

1503.01229	observations of type ia supernova 2014j with flitecam/sofia	we present medium resolution near-infrared (nir) spectra, covering 1.1 to 3.4microns, of the normal type ia supernova (sn ia) sn 2014j in m82 obtained withthe flitecam instrument aboard sofia approximately 17-25 days after maximum blight. our 2.8-3.4 micron spectra may be the first ~3 micron spectra of a sn iaever published. the spectra spanning the 1.5-2.7 micron range are characterizedby a strong emission feature at ~1.77 microns with a full width at half maximumof ~11,000-13,000 km/s. we compare the observed flitecam spectra to the recentnon-lte delayed detonation models of dessart et al. (2014) and find that themodels agree with the spectra remarkably well in the 1.5-2.7 micron wavelengthrange. based on this comparison we identify the ~1.77 micron emission peak as ablend of permitted lines of co ii. other features seen in the 2.0 - 2.5 micronspectra are also identified as emission from permitted transitions of co ii.however, the models are not as successful at reproducing the spectra in the 1.1- 1.4 micron range or between 2.8 and 3.4 microns. these observationsdemonstrate the promise of sofia by allowing access to wavelength regionsinaccessible from the ground, and serve to draw attention to the usefulness ofthe regions between the standard ground-based nir passbands for constraining snmodels.

1503.02293	strong near-infrared carbon in the type ia supernova iptf13ebh	we present near-infrared (nir) time-series spectroscopy, as well ascomplementary ultraviolet (uv), optical, and nir data, of the type ia supernova(sn ia) iptf13ebh, which was discovered within two days from the estimated timeof explosion. the first nir spectrum was taken merely 2.3 days after explosionand may be the earliest nir spectrum yet obtained of a sn ia. the most strikingfeatures in the spectrum are several nir c i lines, and the c i {\lambda}1.0693{\mu}m line is the strongest ever observed in a sn ia. interestingly, no strongoptical c ii counterparts were found, even though the optical spectroscopictime series began early and is densely-cadenced. except at the very earlyepochs, within a few days from the time of explosion, we show that the strongnir c i compared to the weaker optical c ii appears to be general in sne ia.iptf13ebh is a fast decliner with {\delta}m15(b) = 1.79 $\pm$ 0.01, and itsabsolute magnitude obeys the linear part of the width-luminosity relation. itis therefore categorized as a "transitional" event, on the fast-declining endof normal sne ia as opposed to subluminous/91bg-like objects. iptf13ebh showsnir spectroscopic properties that are distinct from both the normal andsubluminous/91bg-like classes, bridging the observed characteristics of the twoclasses. these nir observations suggest composition and density of the innercore similar to that of 91bg-like events, and a deep reaching carbon burninglayer not observed in slower declining sne ia. there is also a substantialdifference between the explosion times inferred from the early-time light curveand the velocity evolution of the si ii {\lambda}0.6355 {\mu}m line, implying along dark phase of ~ 4 days.

0805.2201	from shock breakout to peak and beyond: extensive panchromatic  observations of the type ib supernova 2008d associated with swift x-ray  transient 080109	we present extensive early photometric (ultraviolet through near-infrared)and spectroscopic (optical and near-infrared) data on supernova (sn) 2008d aswell as x-ray data analysis on the associated swift/x-ray transient (xrt)080109. our data span a time range of 5 hours before the detection of the x-raytransient to 150 days after its detection, and detailed analysis allowed us toderive constraints on the nature of the sn and its progenitor; throughout wedraw comparisons with results presented in the literature and find several keyaspects that differ. we show that the x-ray spectrum of xrt 080109 can be fitequally well by an absorbed power law or a superposition of about equal partsof both power law and blackbody. our data first established that sn 2008d is aspectroscopically normal sn ib (i.e., showing conspicuous he lines), and showthat sn 2008d had a relatively long rise time of 18 days and a modest opticalpeak luminosity. the early-time light curves of the sn are dominated by acooling stellar envelope (for \delta t~0.1- 4 day, most pronounced in the bluebands) followed by 56^ni decay. we construct a reliable measurement of thebolometric output for this stripped-envelope sn, and, combined with estimatesof e_k and m_ej from the literature, estimate the stellar radius r_star of itsprobable wolf-rayet progenitor. according to the model of waxman et al. and ofchevalier &amp; fransson, we derive r_star^{w07}= 1.2+/-0.7 r_sun andr_star^{cf08}= 12+/-7 r_sun, respectively; the latter being more in line withtypical wn stars. spectra obtained at 3 and 4 months after maximum light showdouble-peaked oxygen lines that we associate with departures from sphericalsymmetry, as has been suggested for the inner ejecta of a number of sn ibcores.

1509.05389	supernova 2013fc in a circumnuclear ring of a luminous infrared galaxy:  the big brother of sn 1998s	we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of sn 2013fc, a brighttype ii supernova (sn) in a circumnuclear star-forming ring in the luminousinfrared galaxy eso 154-g010, observed as part of the public eso spectroscopicsurvey of transient objects (pessto). sn 2013fc is both photometrically andspectroscopically similar to the well-studied type iin sn 1998s and to thebright type ii-l sn 1979c. it exhibits an initial linear decline, followed by ashort plateau phase and a tail phase with a decline too fast for $^{56}$codecay with full gamma-ray trapping. initially the spectrum was blue andfeatureless. later on, a strong broad ($\sim 8000$ km s$^{-1}$) h $\alpha$emission profile became prominent. we apply a starlight stellar populationmodel fit to the sn location (observed when the sn had faded) to estimate ahigh extinction of $a_v = 2.9 \pm 0.2$ mag and an age of $10_{-2}^{+3}$ myr forthe underlying cluster. we compare the sn to sne 1998s and 1979c and discussits possible progenitor star considering the similarities to these events. witha peak brightness of $b = -20.46 \pm 0.21$ mag, sn 2013fc is 0.9 mag brighterthan sn 1998s and of comparable brightness to sn 1979c. we suggest that sn2013fc was consistent with a massive red supergiant (rsg) progenitor. recentmass loss probably due to a strong rsg wind created the circumstellar matterilluminated through its interaction with the sn ejecta. we also observe anear-infrared excess, possibly due to newly condensed dust.

1510.05074	evolution of the dust in v4332 sagittarii	an eruptive nova-like event took place in 1994 in the stellar-mergercandidate v4332 sgr. following the eruption, dust consisting of refractorysilicate rich dust grains containing a significant component of alo bonding wasformed sometime between 1998 and 2003. observations using spitzer between 2005and 2009 show significant changes in the 10 micron silicate stretch feature.there is a deepening of the 10 micron silicate stretch as well as thedevelopment of a feature between about 13 and 20 microns consistent with ablend of the mgo and feo stretching features and the o-si-o bending mode ofincreasingly ordered silicate dust. near-infrared observations show thepresence of alo and water vapor in the outflow in 2003, 2004 and 2005: the alohas significantly decreased in spectra obtained in 2014 while the water vaporremains largely unchanged. an attempt is made to correlate these observationsand understand the significance of these changes using dusty modeling. theobservations appear consistent with the kinetically-controlled, condensation ofhighly under-oxidized sio/alo/fe/mg dust grains in the outflow followed by thecontinuous evolution of the initial condensate due to thermal annealing andoxidation of the dust via reaction with ambient o, oh and h2o in the expanding,cooling shell. periodic monitoring of this dust shell over the mid-infraredspectral range could yield useful information on the evolution ofunder-oxidized silicate condensates exposed to hot water vapor in moreconventional circumstellar environments.

astro-ph;0006414	constraints on type ia supernovae from near infrared spectra	we describe a research program to improve the understanding of type iasupernovae (sne ia) by modeling and observing near infrared (nir) spectra ofthese events. the nir between 0.9 microns and 2.5 microns is optimal forexamining certain products of the sne ia explosion that may be blended orobscured in other spectral regions. nir analysis will enable us to placeimportant constraints on the physical properties of sne ia progenitors andtheir explosion dynamics. these are critical steps toward understanding thephysics of type ia supernovae. we have identified features in nir spectra ofsne ia that discriminate between population i and population ii progenitors.these features can significantly restrict the evolutionary history of sne ia.we also examine certain products of the nuclear burning that enable us to placeconstraints on the propagation of nuclear burning during the explosion, and onthe behavior of the burning front during the event. we will be able todifferentiate between the several explosion models for sne ia.

astro-ph;0306470	near infrared spectra of type ia supernovae	we report near infrared (nir) spectroscopic observations of twelve``branch-normal'' type ia supernovae (sne ia) which cover the wavelength regionfrom 0.8-2.5 microns. our sample more than doubles the number of sne ia withpublished nir spectra within three weeks of maximum light. the epochs ofobservation range from thirteen days before maximum light to eighteen daysafter maximum light. a detailed model for a type ia supernovae is used toidentify spectral features. the doppler shifts of lines are measured to obtainthe velocity and, thus, the radial distribution of elements.  the nir is an extremely useful tool to probe the chemical structure in thelayers of sne ia ejecta. this wavelength region is optimal for examiningcertain products of the sne ia explosion that may be blended or obscured inother spectral regions. we identify spectral features from mgii, caii, siii,feii, coii, niii and possibly mnii. we find no indications for hydrogen, heliumor carbon in the spectra. the spectral features reveal important clues aboutthe physical characteristics of sne ia. we use the features to derive upperlimits for the amount of unburned matter, to identify the transition regionsfrom explosive carbon to oxygen burning and from partial to complete siliconburning, and to estimate the level of mixing during and after the explosion.

astro-ph;0309639	sn 2003du: signatures of the circumstellar environment in a normal type  ia supernova?	we present observations of the type ia supernova 2003du and report thedetectionof an unusual, high-velocity component in the ca ii infrared triplet,similar tofeatures previously observed in sn 2000cx and sn 2001el. this featureexhibits a large expansion velocity (~18,000 km/s) which is nearly constantbetween -7 and +2 days relative to maximum light, and disappears shortlythereafter. otherthan this feature, the spectral evolution and light curveresemble those of a normal sn ia.  we find that the ca ii feature can plausibly be caused by a dense shellformed when circumstellar material of solar abundance is overrun by the rapidlyexpanding outermost layers of the sn ejecta. model calculations show that theoptical and infrared spectra are remarkably unaffected by the circumstellarinteraction. in particular, no hydrogen lines are detectable in eitherabsorption or emission. the only qualitatively different features are thestrong, high-velocity feature in the ca ii ir-triplet, and a somewhat weaker oi feature near 7,300 aa. the morphology and time evolution of these featuresprovide an estimate for the amount of accumulated matter and an indication ofthe mixing in the dense shell. we apply these diagnostic tools to sn 2003du andinfer that about 2 x 10^{-2} m_sun of solar abundance material may haveaccumulated in a circumstellar shell prior to the observations. furthermore,the early light curve data imply that the circumstellar material was originallyvery close to the progenitor system, perhaps from an accretion disk, roche lobeor common envelope.

astro-ph;0601614	low carbon abundance in type ia supernovae	we investigate the quantity and composition of unburned material in the outerlayers of three normal type ia supernovae (sne ia): 2000dn, 2002cr and 20 04bw.pristine matter from a white dwarf progenitor is expected to be a mixture ofoxygen and carbon in approximately equal abundance. using near-infrared (nir,0.7-2.5 microns) spectra, we find that oxygen is abundant while carbon isseverely depleted with low upper limits in the outer third of the ejected mass.strong features from the oi line at rest wavelength = 0.7773 microns areobserved through a wide range of expansion velocities approx. 9,000 - 18,000km/s. this large velocity domain corresponds to a physical region of thesupernova with a large radial depth. we show that the ionization of c and owill be substantially the same in this region. ci lines in the nir are expectedto be 7-50 times stronger than those from oi but there is only marginalevidence of ci in the spectra and none of cii. we deduce that for these threenormal sne ia, oxygen is more abundant than carbon by factors of 100 - 1,000.mgii is also detected in a velocity range similar to that of oi. the presenceof o and mg combined with the absence of c indicates that for these sne ia,nuclear burning has reached all but the extreme outer layers; any unburnedmaterial must have expansion velocities greater than 18,000 km/s. this resultfavors deflagration to detonation transition (dd) models over pure deflagrationmodels for sne ia.
