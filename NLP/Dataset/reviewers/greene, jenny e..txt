0903.2257	x-ray properties of intermediate-mass black holes in active galaxies.  ii. x-ray-bright accretion and possible evidence for slim disks	we present x-ray properties of optically-selected intermediate-mass(~10^5--10^6 m_sun) black holes (bhs) in active galaxies (agns), using datafrom the chandra x-ray observatory. our observations are a continuation of apilot study by greene &amp; ho (2007). of the 8 objects observed, 5 are detectedwith x-ray luminosities in the range l_0.5-2 kev = 10^41--10^43 erg s^-1,consistent with the previously observed sample. objects with enough counts toextract a spectrum are well fit by an absorbed power law. we continue to find arange of soft photon indices 1 &lt; \gamma_s &lt; 2.7, where n(e) \proptoe^-\gamma_s, consistent with previous agn studies, but generally flatter thanother narrow-line seyfert 1 active nuclei (nls1s). the soft photon indexcorrelates strongly with x-ray luminosity and eddington ratio, but does notdepend on bh mass. there is no justification for the inclusion of anyadditional components, such as a soft excess, although this may be a functionof the relative inefficiency of detecting counts above 2 kev in theserelatively shallow observations. as a whole, the x-ray-to-optical spectralslope \alpha_ox is flatter than in more massive systems, even other nls1s. onlyx-ray-selected nls1s with very high eddington ratios share a similar \alpha_ox.this is suggestive of a physical change in the accretion structure at lowmasses and at very high accretion rates, possibly due to the onset of slimdisks. although the detailed physical explanation for the x-ray loudness ofthese intermediate-mass bhs is not certain, it is very striking that targetsselected on the basis of optical properties should be so distinctly offset intheir broader spectral energy distributions.

0907.1086	the growth of black holes: insights from obscured active galaxies	obscured or narrow-line active galaxies offer an unobstructed view of thequasar environment in the presence of a luminous and vigorously accreting blackhole. we exploit the large new sample of optically selected luminousnarrow-line active galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey at redshifts 0.1&lt; z &lt; 0.45, in conjunction with follow-up observations with the low dispersionsurvey spectrograph (ldss3) at magellan, to study the distributions of blackhole mass and host galaxy properties in these extreme objects. we find a narrowrange in black hole mass (&lt;log m_bh/m_sun&gt; = 8.0 +/- 0.7) and eddington ratio(&lt;log l/l_edd&gt; = -0.7 +/- 0.7) for the sample as a whole, surprisingly similarto comparable broad-line systems. in contrast, we infer a wide range in starformation properties and host morphologies for the sample, from disk-dominatedto elliptical galaxies. nearly one-quarter have highly disturbed morphologiesindicative of ongoing mergers. unlike the black holes, which are apparentlyexperiencing significant growth, the galaxies appear to have formed the bulk oftheir stars at a previous epoch. on the other hand, it is clear from the lackof correlation between gaseous and stellar velocity dispersions in thesesystems that the host galaxy interstellar medium is far from being in virialequilibrium with the stars. while our findings cast strong doubt on thereliability of substituting gas for stellar dispersions in high luminosityactive galaxies, they do provide direct evidence that luminous accreting blackholes influence their surroundings on a galaxy-wide scale.

0907.3491	host galaxies of luminous type 2 quasars at z ~ 0.5	we present deep gemini gmos optical spectroscopy of nine luminous quasars atredshifts z ~ 0.5, drawn from the sdss type 2 quasar sample. our targets wereselected to have high intrinsic luminosities (m_v &lt; -26 mag) as indicated bythe [o iii] 5007 a emission-line luminosity (l_[o iii]). our sample has amedian black hole mass of ~ 10^8.8 m_sun inferred assuming the localm_bh-sigma_* relation and a median eddington ratio of ~ 0.7, using stellarvelocity dispersions sigma_* measured from the g band. we estimate thecontamination of the stellar continuum from scattered quasar light based on thestrength of broad h-beta, and provide an empirical calibration of thecontamination as a function of l_[o iii]; the scattered light fraction is ~ 30%of l_5100 for objects with l_[o iii] = 10^9.5 l_sun. population synthesisindicates that young post-starburst populations (&lt; 0.1 gyr) are prevalent inluminous type 2 quasars, in addition to a relatively old population (&gt; 1 gyr)which dominates the stellar mass. broad emission complexes around he ii 4686 awith luminosities up to 10^8.3 l_sun are unambiguously detected in three out ofthe nine targets, indicative of wolf-rayet populations. population synthesisshows that ~ 5-myr post-starburst populations contribute substantially to theluminosities (&gt; 50% of l_5100) of all three objects with wolf-rayet detections.we find two objects with double cores and four with close companions. ourresults may suggest that luminous type 2 quasars trace an early stage of galaxyinteraction, perhaps responsible for both the quasar and the starburstactivity.

0908.0003	the lick agn monitoring project: broad-line region radii and black hole  masses from reverberation mapping of hbeta	we have recently completed a 64-night spectroscopic monitoring campaign atthe lick observatory 3-m shane telescope with the aim of measuring the massesof the black holes in 12 nearby (z &lt; 0.05) seyfert 1 galaxies with expectedmasses in the range ~10^6-10^7 m_sun and also the well-studied nearby activegalactic nucleus (agn) ngc 5548. nine of the objects in the sample (includingngc 5548) showed optical variability of sufficient strength during themonitoring campaign to allow for a time lag to be measured between thecontinuum fluctuations and the response to these fluctuations in the broadhbeta emission. we present here the light curves for the objects in this sampleand the subsequent hbeta time lags for the nine objects where thesemeasurements were possible. the hbeta lag time is directly related to the sizeof the broad-line region, and by combining the lag time with the measured widthof the hbeta emission line in the variable part of the spectrum, we determinethe virial mass of the central supermassive black hole in these nine agns. theabsolute calibration of the black hole masses is based on the normalizationderived by onken et al. we also examine the time lag response as a function ofvelocity across the hbeta line profile for six of the agns. the analysis offour leads to ambiguous results with relatively flat time lags as a function ofvelocity. however, sbs 1116+583a exhibits a symmetric time lag response aroundthe line center reminiscent of simple models for circularly orbiting broad-lineregion (blr) clouds, and arp 151 shows an asymmetric profile that is mosteasily explained by a simple gravitational infall model. further investigationwill be necessary to fully understand the constraints placed on physical modelsof the blr by the velocity-resolved response in these objects.

0704.1458	radio emission from the intermediate-mass black hole in the globular  cluster g1	we have used the very large array (vla) to search for radio emission from theglobular cluster g1 (mayall-ii) in m31. g1 has been reported by gebhardt et al.to contain an intermediate-mass black hole (imbh) with a mass of ~2 x 10^4solar masses. radio emission was detected within an arcsecond of the clustercenter with an 8.4 ghz power of 2 x 10^{15} w/hz. the radio/x-ray ratio of g1is a few hundred times higher than that expected for a high-mass x-ray binaryin the cluster center, but is consistent with the expected value for accretiononto an imbh with the reported mass. a pulsar wind nebula is also a possiblecandidate for the radio and x-ray emission from g1; future high-sensitivityvlbi observations might distinguish between this possibility and an imbh. ifthe radio source is an imbh, and similar accretion and outflow processes occurfor hypothesized ~ 1000-solar-mass black holes in milky way globular clusters,they are within reach of the current vla and should be detectable easily by theexpanded vla when it comes on line in 2010.

0909.5455	the lick agn monitoring project: photometric light curves and optical  variability characteristics	the lick agn monitoring project targeted 13 nearby seyfert 1 galaxies withthe intent of measuring the masses of their central black holes usingreverberation mapping. the sample includes 12 galaxies selected to have blackholes with masses roughly in the range 10^6-10^7 solar masses, as well as thewell-studied agn ngc 5548. in conjunction with a spectroscopic monitoringcampaign, we obtained broad-band b and v images on most nights from 2008february through 2008 may. the imaging observations were carried out by fourtelescopes: the 0.76-m katzman automatic imaging telescope (kait), the 2-mmulticolor active galactic nuclei monitoring (magnum) telescope, the palomar60-in (1.5-m) telescope, and the 0.80-m tenagra ii telescope. havingwell-sampled light curves over the course of a few months is useful forobtaining the broad-line reverberation lag and black hole mass, and also allowsus to examine the characteristics of the continuum variability. in this paper,we discuss the observational methods and the photometric measurements, andpresent the agn continuum light curves. we measure various variabilitycharacteristics of each of the light curves. we do not detect any evidence fora time lag between the b- and v-band variations, and we do not find significantcolor variations for the agns in our sample.

0911.2314	strong [o iii] objects among sdss broad-line active galaxies	we present the results of a spectral principal component analysis on 9046broad-line agn from the sloan digital sky survey. we examine correlationsbetween spectral regions within various eigenspectra (e.g., between fe iistrength and h$\beta$ width) and confirm that the same trends are apparent inspectral measurements, as validation of our technique. because we found thatour sample had a large range in the equivalent width of [o iii] $\lambda$5007,we divided the data into three subsets based on [o iii] strength. of these,only in the sample with the weakest equivalent width of [o iii] were we able torecover the known correlation between [o iii] strength and full width at halfmaximum of h$\beta$ and their anticorrelation with fe ii strength. at the lowluminosities considered here ($l_{5100 \aa}$ of $10^{42}-10^{46}$ ergs$^{-1}$), interpretation of the principal components is considerablycomplicated particularly because of the wide range in [o iii] equivalent width.we speculate that variations in covering factor are responsible for this widerange in [o iii] strength.

0707.2617	a new sample of low-mass black holes in active galaxies	we present an expanded sample of low-mass black holes (bhs) found in galacticnuclei. using standard virial mass techniques to estimate bh masses, we selectfrom the fourth data release of the sloan digital sky survey all broad-lineactive galaxies with masses &lt; 2 x 10^6 m_sun. bhs in this mass regime provideunique tests of the relationship between bhs and galaxies, since theirlate-type galaxy hosts do not necessarily contain classical bulges.furthermore, they provide observational analogs of primordial seed bhs and areexpected, when merging, to provide strong gravitational signals for futuredetectors such as lisa. from our preliminary sample of 19, we have increasedthe total sample by an order of magnitude to 174, as well as an additional 55(less secure) candidates. the sample has a median bh mass of &lt;m_bh&gt; = 1.3 x10^6 m_sun, and in general the objects are radiating at high fractions of theireddington limits. we investigate the broad spectral properties of the sample;55 are detected by \rosat, with soft x-ray luminosities in the range 10^40 to 7x 10^43 ergs/sec. much like the preliminary sample, these objects arepredominantly radio-quiet (r = f_6cm/f_4400a &lt; 10), but 11 objects are detectedat 20 cm, with radio powers (10^21-10^23 w/hz) that may arise from either starformation or nuclear activity; only 1% of the sample is radio-loud. we furtherconfirm that, with &lt;m_g&gt;=-19.3 and &lt;g-r&gt; = 0.7 mag, the host galaxies arelow-mass, late-type systems. at least 40% show disk-like morphologies, and thecombination of host galaxy colors and higher-order balmer absorption linesindicate intermediate-age stellar populations in a subset of the sample.

1004.2922	the lick agn monitoring project: reverberation mapping of optical  hydrogen and helium recombination lines	we have recently completed a 64-night spectroscopic monitoring campaign atthe lick observatory 3-m shane telescope with the aim of measuring the massesof the black holes in 12 nearby (z &lt; 0.05) seyfert 1 galaxies with expectedmasses in the range ~10^6-10^7m_sun and also the well-studied nearby activegalactic nucleus (agn) ngc 5548. nine of the objects in the sample (includingngc 5548) showed optical variability of sufficient strength during themonitoring campaign to allow for a time lag to be measured between thecontinuum fluctuations and the response to these fluctuations in the broadhbeta emission, which we have previously reported. we present here the lightcurves for the halpha, hgamma, heii 4686, and hei 5876 emission lines and thetime lags for the emission-line responses relative to changes in the continuumflux. combining each emission-line time lag with the measured width of the linein the variable part of the spectrum, we determine a virial mass of the centralsupermassive black hole from several independent emission lines. we find thatthe masses are generally consistent within the uncertainties. the time-lagresponse as a function of velocity across the balmer line profiles is examinedfor six of the agns. finally we compare several trends seen in the datasetagainst the predictions from photoionization calculations as presented bykorista &amp; goad. we confirm several of their predictions, including an increasein responsivity and a decrease in the mean time lag as the excitation andionization level for the species increases. further confirmation ofphotoionization predictions for broad-line gas behavior will require additionalmonitoring programs for these agns while they are in different luminositystates.

1009.0532	the lick agn monitoring project: alternate routes to a broad-line region  radius	it is now possible to estimate black hole masses across cosmic time, usingbroad emission lines in active galaxies. this technique informs our views ofhow galaxies and their central black holes coevolve. unfortunately, there aremany outstanding uncertainties associated with these "virial" mass estimates.one of these comes from using the accretion luminosity to infer a size for thebroad-line region. incorporating the new sample of low-luminosity activegalaxies from our recent monitoring campaign at lick observatory, werecalibrate the radius-luminosity relation with tracers of the accretionluminosity other than the optical continuum. we find that the radius of thebroad-line region scales as the square root of the x-ray and hbetaluminosities, in agreement with recent optical studies. on the other hand, thescaling appears to be marginally steeper with narrow-line luminosities. this isconsistent with a previously observed decrease in the ratio of narrow-line tox-ray luminosity with increasing total luminosity. the radius of the broad-lineregion correlates most tightly with hbeta luminosity, while the x-ray andnarrow-line relations both have comparable scatter of a factor of two. thesecorrelations provide useful alternative virial bh masses in objects with nodetectable optical/uv continuum emission, such as high-redshift galaxies withbroad emission lines, radio-loud objects, or local active galaxies withgalaxy-dominated continua.

1011.5246	type 2 active galactic nuclei with double-peaked [oiii] lines. ii.  single agns with complex narrow-line region kinematics are more common than  binary agns	(abridged) approximately 1% of low redshift (z&lt;0.3) optically-selected type 2agns show a double-peaked [oiii] narrow emission line profile in theirspatially-integrated spectra. such features are usually interpreted as dueeither to kinematics, such as biconical outflows and/or disk rotation of thenarrow line region (nlr) around single black holes, or to the relative motionof two distinct nlrs in a merging pair of agns. here we report follow-up nearinfrared (nir) imaging and optical slit spectroscopy of 31 double-peaked [oiii]type 2 agns drawn from the sdss parent sample presented in liu et al (2010).these data reveal a mixture of origins for the double-peaked feature. roughly10% of our objects are best explained by binary agns at (projected) kpc-scaleseparations, where two stellar components with spatially coincident nlrs areseen. ~ 50% of our objects have [oiii] emission offset by a few kpc,corresponding to the two velocity components seen in the sdss spectra, butthere are no corresponding double stellar components seen in the nir imaging.for those objects with sufficiently high quality slit spectra, we see velocityand/or velocity dispersion gradients in [oiii] emission, suggestive of thekinematic signatures of a single nlr. the remaining ~40% of our objects areambiguous, and will need higher spatial resolution observations to distinguishbetween the two scenarios. our observations therefore favor the kinematicsscenario with a single agn for the majority of these double-peaked [oiii] type2 agns. we emphasize the importance of combining imaging and slit spectroscopyin identifying kpc binary agns, i.e., in no cases does one of these alone allowan unambiguous identification. we estimate that ~ 0.5-2.5% of the z&lt;0.3 type 2agns are kpc-scale binary agns of comparable luminosities, with a relativeorbital velocity &gt;~150 km/s.

1012.0075	the rest frame ultraviolet spectra of uv-selected active galactic nuclei  at z ~ 2-3	we present new results for a sample of 33 narrow-lined uv-selected activegalactic nuclei (agns), identified in the course of a spectroscopic survey forstar-forming galaxies at z ~ 2-3. the rest-frame uv composite spectrum for ouragn sample shows several emission lines characteristic of agns, as well asinterstellar absorption features seen in star-forming lyman break galaxies(lbgs). we report a detection of niv]1486, which has been observed inhigh-redshift radio galaxies, as well as in rare optically-selected quasars.the uv continuum slope of the composite spectrum is significantly redder thanthat of a sample of non-agn uv-selected star forming galaxies. blueshifted siivabsorption provides evidence for outflowing highly-ionized gas in these objectsat speeds of ~ 10^(3) km/s, quantitatively different from what is seen in theoutflows of non-agn lbgs. grouping the individual agns by parameters such asly-alpha equivalent width, redshift, and uv continuum magnitude allows for ananalysis of the major spectroscopic trends within the sample. stronger ly-alphaemission is coupled with weaker low-ionization absorption, which is similar towhat is seen in the non-agn lbgs, and highlights the role that coolinterstellar gas plays in the escape of ly-alpha photons. however, the agncomposite does not show the same trends between ly-alpha strength andextinction seen in the non-agn lbgs. these results represent the first suchcomparison at high-redshift between star-forming galaxies and similar galaxiesthat host agn activity.

1102.2913	feedback in luminous obscured quasars	we use spatially resolved long-slit spectroscopy from magellan to investigatethe extent, kinematics, and ionization structure in the narrow-line regions of15 luminous, obscured quasars with z&lt;0.5. increasing the dynamic range inluminosity by an order of magnitude, as well as improving the depth of existingobservations by a similar factor, we revisit relations between narrow-lineregion size and the luminosity and linewidth of the narrow emission lines. wefind a slope of 0.22 +/- 0.04 for the power-law relationship between size andluminosity, suggesting that the nebulae are limited by availability of gas toionize at these luminosities. in fact, we find that the active galactic nucleusis effectively ionizing the interstellar medium over the full extent of thehost galaxy. broad (~300-1000 km/s) linewidths across the galaxies reveal thatthe gas is kinematically disturbed. furthermore, the rotation curves andvelocity dispersions of the ionized gas remain constant out to large distances,in striking contrast to normal and starburst galaxies. we argue that the gas inthe entire host galaxy is significantly disturbed by the central activegalactic nucleus. while only ~10^7-10^8 m_sun worth of gas are directlyobserved to be leaving the host galaxies at or above their escape velocities,these estimates are likely lower limits because of the biases in both mass andoutflow velocity measurements and may in fact be in accord with expectationsfrom recent feedback models. additionally, we report the discovery of two dualobscured quasars, one of which is blowing a large-scale (~10 kpc) bubble ofionized gas into the intergalactic medium.

1111.6604	the lick agn monitoring project: recalibrating single-epoch virial black  hole mass estimates	we investigate the calibration and uncertainties of black hole mass estimatesbased on the single-epoch (se) method, using homogeneous and high-qualitymulti-epoch spectra obtained by the lick active galactic nucleus (agn)monitoring project for 9 local seyfert 1 galaxies with black hole masses &lt; 10^8m_sun. by decomposing the spectra into their agn and stellar components, westudy the variability of the single-epoch hbeta line width (full width athalf-maximum intensity, fwhm_hbeta; or dispersion, sigma_hbeta) and of the agncontinuum luminosity at 5100a (l_5100). from the distribution of the "virialproducts" (~ fwhm_hbeta^2 l_5100^0.5 or sigma_hbeta^2 l_5100^0.5) measured fromse spectra, we estimate the uncertainty due to the combined variability as ~0.05 dex (12%). this is subdominant with respect to the total uncertainty in semass estimates, which is dominated by uncertainties in the size-luminosityrelation and virial coefficient, and is estimated to be ~ 0.46 dex (factor of ~3). by comparing the hbeta line profile of the se, mean, and root-mean-square(rms) spectra, we find that the hbeta line is broader in the mean (and se)spectra than in the rms spectra by ~ 0.1 dex (25%) for our sample withfwhm_hbeta &lt; 3000 km/s. this result is at variance with larger mass black holeswhere the difference is typically found to be much less than 0.1 dex. tocorrect for this systematic difference of the hbeta line profile, we introducea line-width dependent virial factor, resulting in a recalibration of se blackhole mass estimators for low-mass agns.

1112.3358	a spectacular outflow in an obscured quasar	sdss j1356+1026 is a pair of interacting galaxies at redshift z=0.123 thathosts a luminous obscured quasar in its northern nucleus. here we present twolong-slit magellan ldss-3 spectra that reveal a pair of symmetric ~10 kpc-sizeoutflows emerging from this nucleus, with observed expansion velocities of ~250km/s in projection. we present a kinematic model of these outflows and arguethat the deprojected physical velocities of expansion are likely ~1000 km/s andthat the kinetic energy of the expanding shells is likely 10^44-10^45 erg/s,with an absolute minimum of &gt;10^42 erg/s. although a radio counterpart isdetected at 1.4ghz, it is faint enough that the quasar is considered to beradio-quiet by all standard criteria, and there is no evidence of extendedemission due to radio lobes, whether aged or continuously powered by an ongoingjet. we argue that the likely level of star formation is probably insufficientto power the observed energetic outflow and that sdss j1356+1026 makes a strongcase for radio-quiet quasar feedback. in further support of this hypothesis,polarimetric observations show that the direction of quasar illumination iscoincident with the direction of the outflow.

1202.4464	the stellar halos of massive elliptical galaxies	we use the mitchell spectrograph (formerly virus-p) on the mcdonaldobservatory 2.7m harlan j. smith telescope to search for the chemicalsignatures of massive elliptical galaxy assembly. the mitchell spectrograph isan integral-field spectrograph with a uniquely wide field of view (107x107 sqarcsec), allowing us to achieve remarkably high signal-to-noise ratios of~20-70 per pixel in radial bins of 2-2.5 times the effective radii of the eightgalaxies in our sample. focusing on a sample of massive elliptical galaxieswith stellar velocity dispersions sigma* &gt; 150 km/s, we study the radialdependence in the equivalent widths (ews) of key metal absorption lines. bytwice the effective radius, the mgb ews have dropped by ~50%, and only a weakcorrelation between sigma* and mgb ew remains. the mgb ews at large radii arecomparable to those seen in the centers of elliptical galaxies that areapproximately an order of magnitude less massive. we find that the well-knownmetallicity gradients often observed within an effective radius continuesmoothly to 2.5r_e, while the abundance ratio gradients remain flat. much likethe halo of the milky way, the stellar halos of our galaxies have lowmetallicities and high alpha-abundance ratios, as expected for very old starsformed in small stellar systems. our observations support a picture in whichthe outer parts of massive elliptical galaxies are built by the accretion ofmuch smaller systems whose star formation history was truncated at early times.

1205.3224	simultaneous ultraviolet and optical emission-line profiles of quasars:  implications for black hole mass determination	the x-shooter instrument on the vlt was used to obtain spectra of sevenmoderate-redshift quasars simultaneously covering the spectral range 3000 angto 2.5 microns. at z ~ 1.5, most of the prominent broad emission lines in theultraviolet to optical region are captured in their rest frame. we use thisunique dataset, which mitigates complications from source variability, tointercompare the line profiles of c iv 1549, c iii] 1909, mg ii 2800, andhalpha and evaluate their implications for black hole mass estimation. weconfirm that mg ii and the balmer lines share similar kinematics and that theydeliver mutually consistent black hole mass estimates with minimal internalscatter (&lt; 0.1 dex) using the latest virial mass estimators. although no virialmass formalism has yet been calibrated for c iii], this line does not appearpromising for such an application because of the large spread of its velocitywidth compared to lines of both higher and lower ionization; part of thediscrepancy may be due to the difficulty of deblending c iii] from itsneighboring lines. the situation for c iv is complex and, because of thelimited statistics of our small sample, inconclusive. on the one hand, slightlymore than half of our sample (4/7) have c iv line widths that correlatereasonably well with halpha line widths, and their respective black hole massestimates agree to within ~0.15 dex. the rest, on the other hand, exhibitexceptionally broad c iv profiles that overestimate virial masses by factors of2-5 compared to halpha. as c iv is widely used to study black hole demographicsat high redshifts, we urgently need to revisit our analysis with a largersample.

1205.3789	the lick agn monitoring project 2011: dynamical modeling of the broad  line region in mrk 50	we present dynamical modeling of the broad line region (blr) in the seyfert 1galaxy mrk 50 using reverberation mapping data taken as part of the lick agnmonitoring project (lamp) 2011. we model the reverberation mapping datadirectly, constraining the geometry and kinematics of the blr, as well asderiving a black hole mass estimate that does not depend on a normalizingfactor or virial coefficient. we find that the geometry of the blr in mrk 50 isa nearly face-on thick disk, with a mean radius of 9.6(+1.2,-0.9) light days, awidth of the blr of 6.9(+1.2,-1.1) light days, and a disk opening angle of25\pm10 degrees above the plane. we also constrain the inclination angle to be9(+7,-5) degrees, close to face-on. finally, the black hole mass of mrk 50 isinferred to be log10(m(bh)/msun) = 7.57(+0.44,-0.27). by comparison to thevirial black hole mass estimate from traditional reverberation mappinganalysis, we find the normalizing constant (virial coefficient) to be log10(f)= 0.78(+0.44,-0.27), consistent with the commonly adopted mean value of 0.74based on aligning the m(bh)-{\sigma}* relation for agn and quiescent galaxies.while our dynamical model includes the possibility of a net inflow or outflowin the blr, we cannot distinguish between these two scenarios.

1208.1303	physical properties of the narrow-line region of low-mass active  galaxies	we present spectroscopic observations of 27 active galactic nuclei (agn) withsome of the lowest black hole (bh) masses known. we use the high spectralresolution and small aperture of our keck data, taken with the echellettespectrograph and imager, to isolate the narrow-line regions (nlrs) of theselow-mass bhs. we investigate their emission-line properties and compare themwith those of agn with higher-mass black holes. while we are unable todetermine absolute metallicities, some of our objects plausibly representexamples of the low-metallicity agn described by groves et al. (2006), based ontheir [n ii]/h_alpha ratios and their consistency with the kewley &amp; ellison(2008) mass-metallicity relation. we find tentative evidence for steeper far-uvspectral slopes in lower-mass systems. overall, nlr emission lines in theselow-mass agn exhibit trends similar to those seen in agn with higher-mass bhs,such as increasing blueshifts and broadening with increasing ionizationpotential. additionally, we see evidence of an intermediate line region whoseintensity correlates with l/l_edd, as seen in higher-mass agn. we highlight theinteresting trend that, at least in these low-mass agn, the [o iii] equivalentwidth (ew) is highest in symmetric nlr lines with no blue wing. this trend ofincreasing [o iii] ew with line symmetry could be explained by a high coveringfactor of lower ionization gas in the nlr. in general, low-mass agn preservemany well-known trends in the structure of the nlr, while exhibiting steeperionizing continuum slopes and somewhat lower gas-phase metallicities.

1210.6653	x-ray properties of intermediate-mass black holes in active galaxies.  iii. spectral energy distribution and possible evidence for intrinsically  x-ray-weak agns	we present a systematic x-ray study, the third in a series, of 49 activegalactic nuclei with intermediate-mass black holes (imbh; ~10^5-10^6 m_sun)using chandra observations. we detect 42 out of 49 targets with a 0.5-2 kevx-ray luminosity 10^41-10^43 erg/s. we perform spectral fitting for the 10objects with enough counts (&gt;200), and they are all well fit by a simplepower-law model modified by galactic absorption, with no sign of significantintrinsic absorption. while we cannot fit the x-ray spectral slope directly forthe rest of the sample, we estimate it from the hardness ratio and find a rangeof photon indices consistent with those seen in more luminous and massiveobjects. the x-ray-to-optical spectral slope (alphaox) of our imbh sample issystematically flatter than in active galaxies with more massive black holes,consistent with the well-known correlation between alphaox and uv luminosity.thanks to the wide dynamic range of our sample, we find evidence that alphaoxincreases with decreasing m_bh as expected from accretion disk models, wherethe uv emission systematically decreases as m_bh decreases and the disktemperature increases. we also find a long tail toward low alphaox values.while some of these sources may be obscured, given the high l_bol/l_eddingtonvalues in the sample, we argue that some may be intrinsically x-ray-weak,perhaps owing to a rare state that radiates very little coronal emission.

1211.7082	low-mass black holes as the remnants of primordial black hole formation	this article documents our ongoing search for the elusive "intermediate-mass"black holes. these would bridge the gap between the approximately ten solarmass "stellar-mass" black holes that are the end-product of the life of amassive star, and the "supermassive" black holes with masses of millions tobillions of solar masses found at the centers of massive galaxies. thediscovery of black holes with intermediate mass is the key to understandingwhether supermassive black holes can grow from stellar-mass black holes, orwhether a more exotic process accelerated their growth only hundreds ofmillions of years after the big bang. here we focus on searches for black holeswith masses of 10^4-10^6 solar masses that are found at galaxy centers. we willrefer to black holes in this mass range as "low-mass" black holes, since theyare at the low-mass end of supermassive black holes. we review the searches forlow-mass black holes to date and show tentative evidence, from the number oflow-mass black holes that are discovered today in small galaxies, that theprogenitors of supermassive black holes were formed as ten thousand toone-hundred thousand solar mass black holes via the direct collapse of gas.

1301.1677	observations of feedback from radio-quiet quasars: i. extents and  morphologies of ionized gas nebulae	black hole feedback -- the strong interaction between the energy output ofsupermassive black holes and their surrounding environments -- is routinelyinvoked to explain the absence of overly luminous galaxies, the black hole vs.bulge correlations and the similarity of black hole accretion and starformation histories. yet direct probes of this process in action are scarce andlimited to small samples of active nuclei. we present gemini ifu observationsof the distribution of ionized gas around luminous, obscured, radio-quiet (rq)quasars at z~0.5. we detect extended ionized gas nebulae via [o iii]5007emission in every case, with a mean diameter of 28 kpc. these nebulae arenearly perfectly round. the regular morphologies of nebulae around rq quasarsare in striking contrast with lumpy or elongated nebulae seen around radiogalaxies at low and high redshifts. we present the uniformly measuredsize-luminosity relationship of [o iii] nebulae around seyfert 2 galaxies andtype 2 quasars spanning 6 orders of magnitude in luminosity and confirm theflat slope of the correlation (r ~ l^{0.25+/-0.02}). we find a universalbehavior of the [o iii]/h-beta ratio in our entire rq quasar sample: itpersists at a constant value (~10) in the central regions, until reaching a"break" isophotal radius ranging from 4 to 11 kpc where it starts to decrease.we propose a model of clumpy nebulae in which clouds that produce line emissiontransition from being ionization-bounded at small distances from the quasar tobeing matter-bounded in the outer parts of the nebula, which qualitativelyexplains the observed line ratio and surface brightness profiles. it isstriking that we see such smooth and round large-scale gas nebulosities in thissample, which are inconsistent with illuminated merger debris and which wesuggest may be the signature of accretion energy from the nucleus reaching gasat large scales.

0705.0020	the mass function of active black holes in the local universe	we present the first measurement of the black hole (bh) mass function forbroad-line active galaxies in the local universe. using the ~9000 broad-lineactive galaxies from the fourth data release of the sloan digital sky survey,we construct a broad-line luminosity function that agrees very well with thelocal soft x-ray luminosity function. using standard virial relations, we thenconvert observed broad-line luminosities and widths into bh masses. a massfunction constructed in this way has the unique capability to probe the massregion &lt;10^6 m_sun, which, while insignificant in terms of total bh massdensity, nevertheless may place important constraints on the mass distributionof seed bhs in the early universe. the characteristic local active bh has amass of ~10^7 m_sun radiating at 10% of the eddington rate. the active fractionis a strong function of bh mass; at both higher and lower masses the activemass function falls more steeply than one would infer from the distribution ofbulge luminosity. the deficit of local massive radiating bhs is a well-knownphenomenon, while we present the first robust measurement of a decline in thespace density of active bhs at low mass.

1303.1742	the low-luminosity end of the radius-luminosity relationship for active  galactic nuclei	we present an updated and revised analysis of the relationship between thehbeta broad-line region (blr) radius and the luminosity of the active galacticnucleus (agn). specifically, we have carried out two-dimensional surfacebrightness decompositions of the host galaxies of 9 new agns imaged with thehubble space telescope wide field camera 3. the surface brightnessdecompositions allow us to create "agn-free" images of the galaxies, from whichwe measure the starlight contribution to the optical luminosity measuredthrough the ground-based spectroscopic aperture. we also incorporate 20 newreverberation-mapping measurements of the hbeta time lag, which is assumed toyield the average hbeta blr radius. the final sample includes 41 agns coveringfour orders of magnitude in luminosity. the additions and updates incorporatedhere primarily affect the low-luminosity end of the r-l relationship. the bestfit to the relationship using a bayesian analysis finds a slope of alpha =0.533 (+0.035/-0.033), consistent with previous work and with simplephotoionization arguments. only two agns appear to be outliers from therelationship, but both of them have monitoring light curves that raise doubtregarding the accuracy of their reported time lags. the scatter around therelationship is found to be 0.19(+/-0.02) dex, but would be decreased to 0.13dex by the removal of these two suspect measurements. a large fraction of theremaining scatter in the relationship is likely due to the inaccurate distancesto the agn host galaxies. our results help support the possibility that the r-lrelationship could potentially be used to turn the blrs of agns intostandardizable candles. this would allow the cosmological expansion of theuniverse to be probed by a separate population of objects, and over a largerrange of redshifts.

1303.4393	the effect of spatial gradients in stellar mass-to-light ratio on black  hole mass measurements	we have tested the effect of spatial gradients in stellar mass-to-light ratio(y) on measurements of black hole masses (mbh) derived from stellar orbitsuperposition models. such models construct a static gravitational potentialfor a galaxy and its central black hole, but typically assume spatially uniformy. we have modeled three giant elliptical galaxies with gradients alpha = d(logy)/d(log r) from -0.2 to +0.1. color and line strength gradients suggest mildlynegative alpha in these galaxies. introducing a negative (positive) gradient iny increases (decreases) the enclosed stellar mass near the center of the galaxyand leads to systematically smaller (larger) mbh measurements. for models withalpha = -0.2, the best-fit values of mbh are 28%, 27%, and 17% lower than theconstant-y case, in ngc 3842, ngc 6086, and ngc 7768, respectively. for alpha =+0.1, mbh are 14%, 22%, and 17% higher than the constant-y case for the threerespective galaxies. for ngc 3842 and ngc 6086, this bias is comparable to thestatistical errors from individual modeling trials. at larger radii, negative(positive) gradients in y cause the total stellar mass to decrease (increase)and the dark matter fraction within one effective radius to increase(decrease).

1304.4643	the lick agn monitoring project 2011: fe ii reverberation from the outer  broad-line region	the prominent broad fe ii emission blends in the spectra of active galacticnuclei have been shown to vary in response to continuum variations, but pastattempts to measure the reverberation lag time of the optical fe ii lines havemet with only limited success. here we report the detection of fe iireverberation in two seyfert 1 galaxies, ngc 4593 and mrk 1511, based on datafrom a program carried out at lick observatory in spring 2011. light curves foremission lines including h-beta and fe ii were measured by applying a fittingroutine to decompose the spectra into several continuum and emission-linecomponents, and we use cross-correlation techniques to determine thereverberation lags of the emission lines relative to v-band light curves. inboth cases the measured lag (t_cen) of fe ii is longer than that of h-beta,although the inferred lags are somewhat sensitive to the choice of fe iitemplate used in the fit. for spectral decompositions done using the fe iitemplate of veron-cetty et al. (2004), we find t_cen(fe ii)/t_cen(h-beta) =1.9+-0.6 in ngc 4593 and 1.5+-0.3 in mrk 1511. the detection of highlycorrelated variations between fe ii and continuum emission demonstrates thatthe fe ii emission in these galaxies originates in photoionized gas, locatedpredominantly in the outer portion of the broad-line region.

1309.2284	dual supermassive black hole candidates in the agn and galaxy evolution  survey	dual supermassive black holes (smbhs) with kiloparsec scale separations inmerger-remnant galaxies are informative tracers of galaxy evolution, but theavenue for identifying them in large numbers for such studies is not yet clear.one promising approach is to target spectroscopic signatures of systems whereboth smbhs are fueled as dual active galactic nuclei (agns), or where one smbhis fueled as an offset agn. dual agns may produce double-peaked narrow agnemission lines, while offset agns may produce single-peaked narrow agn emissionlines with line-of-sight velocity offsets relative to the host galaxy. wesearch for such dual and offset systems among 173 type 2 agns at z&lt;0.37 in theagn and galaxy evolution survey (ages), and we find two double-peaked agns andfive offset agn candidates. when we compare these results to a similar searchof the deep2 galaxy redshift survey and match the two samples in color,absolute magnitude, and minimum velocity offset, we find that the fraction ofagns that are dual smbh candidates increases from z=0.25 to z=0.7 by a factorof ~6 (from 2/70 to 16/91, or 2.9% to 18%). this may be associated with therise in the galaxy merger fraction over the same cosmic time. as furtherevidence for a link with galaxy mergers, the ages offset and dual agncandidates are tentatively ~3 times more likely than the overall agn populationto reside in a host galaxy that has a companion galaxy (from 16/173 to 2/7, or9% to 29%). follow-up observations of the seven offset and dual agn candidatesin ages will definitively distinguish velocity offsets produced by dual smbhsfrom those produced by narrow-line region kinematics, and will help sharpen ourobservational approach to detecting dual smbhs.

1309.5166	refining the m_bh-v_c scaling relation with hi rotation curves of water  megamaser galaxies	black hole - galaxy scaling relations provide information about thecoevolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies. we compare theblack hole mass - circular velocity (mbh - vc) relation with the black holemass - bulge stellar velocity dispersion (mbh - sigma) relation, to see whetherthe scaling relations can passively emerge from a large number of mergers, orrequire a physical mechanism, such as feedback from an active nucleus. wepresent vla h i observations of five galaxies, including three water megamasergalaxies, to measure the circular velocity. using twenty-two galaxies withdynamical mbh measurements and vc measurements extending to large radius, ourbest-fit mbh - vc relation, log mbh = alpha + beta log(vc /200 km s^-1), yieldsalpha = 7.43+/-0.13, beta = 3.68+1.23/-1.20, and intrinsic scatter epsilon_int= 0.51+0.11/-0.09. the intrinsic scatter may well be higher than 0.51, as wetake great care to ascribe conservatively large observational errors. we findcomparable scatter in the mbh - sigma relations, epsilon_int = 0.48+0.10/-0.08,while pure merging scenarios would likely result in a tighter scaling with thedark halo (as traced by vc) than baryonic (sigma) properties. instead, feedbackfrom the active nucleus may act on bulge scales to tighten the mbh - sigmarelation with respect to the mbh - vc relation, as observed.

1312.3950	x-ray properties of k-selected galaxies at 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.0: investigating  trends with stellar mass, redshift and spectral type	we examine how the total x-ray luminosity correlates with stellar mass,stellar population, and redshift for a k-band limited sample of ~3500 galaxiesat 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.0 from the newfirm medium band survey in the cosmos field. thegalaxy sample is divided into 32 different galaxy types, based on similaritiesbetween the spectral energy distributions. for each galaxy type, we furtherdivide the sample into bins of redshift and stellar mass, and perform an x-raystacking analysis using the chandra cosmos (c-cosmos) data. we find that fullband x-ray luminosity is primarily increasing with stellar mass, and at similarmass and spectral type is higher at larger redshifts. when comparing at thesame stellar mass, we find that the x-ray luminosity is slightly higher foryounger galaxies (i.e., weaker 4000\aa breaks), but the scatter in thisrelation is large. we compare the observed x-ray luminosities to those expectedfrom low and high mass x-ray binaries (xrbs). for blue galaxies, xrbs canalmost fully account for the observed emission, while for older galaxies withlarger 4000\aa breaks, active galactic nuclei (agn) or hot gas dominate themeasured x-ray flux. after correcting for xrbs, the x-ray luminosity is stillslightly higher in younger galaxies, although this correlation is notsignificant. agn appear to be a larger component of galaxy x-ray luminosity atearlier times, as the hardness ratio increases with redshift. together with theslight increase in x-ray luminosity this may indicate more obscured agns orhigher accretion rates at earlier times.

1401.0536	similarity of ionized gas nebulae around unobscured and obscured quasars	quasar feedback is suspected to play a key role in the evolution of massivegalaxies, by removing or reheating gas in quasar host galaxies and thuslimiting the amount of star formation. in this paper we continue ourinvestigation of quasar-driven winds on galaxy-wide scales. we conduct geminiintegral field unit spectroscopy of a sample of luminous unobscured (type 1)quasars, to determine the morphology and kinematics of ionized gas around theseobjects, predominantly via observations of the [o iii]5007 emission line. wefind that ionized gas nebulae extend out to ~13 kpc from the quasar, that theyare smooth and round, and that their kinematics are inconsistent with gas indynamical equilibrium with the host galaxy. the observed morphological andkinematic properties are strikingly similar to those of ionized gas aroundobscured (type 2) quasars with matched [o iii] luminosity, with marginalevidence that nebulae around unobscured quasars are slightly more compact.therefore in samples of obscured and unobscured quasars carefully matched in [oiii] luminosity we find support for the standard geometry-based unificationmodel of active galactic nuclei, in that the intrinsic properties of quasars,of their hosts and of their ionized gas appear to be very similar. given theapparent ubiquity of extended ionized regions, we are forced to conclude thateither the quasar is at least partially illuminating pre-existing gas or thatboth samples of quasars are seen during advanced stages of quasar feedback. inthe latter case, we may be biased by our [o iii]-based selection againstquasars in the early "blow-out" phase, for example due to dust obscuration.

1402.6736	quasar feedback and the origin of radio emission in radio-quiet quasars	we conduct kinematic analysis of the sdss spectra of 568 obscured luminousquasars, with the emphasis on the kinematic structure of the [oiii]5007emission line. [oiii] emission tends to show blueshifts and blue excess, whichindicates that at least part of the narrow-line gas is undergoing an organizedoutflow. the velocity width containing 90% of line power ranges from 370 to4780 km/sec, suggesting outflow velocities up to 2000 km/sec. the velocitywidth of the [oiii] emission is positively correlated with the radio luminosityamong the radio-quiet quasars. we propose that radio emission in radio-quietquasars is due to relativistic particles accelerated in the shocks within thequasar-driven outflows; star formation in quasar hosts is insufficient toexplain the observed radio emission. the median radio luminosity of the sampleof nu l_nu[1.4ghz] = 10^40 erg/sec suggests a median kinetic luminosity of thequasar-driven wind of l_wind=3x10^44 erg/sec, or about 4% of the estimatedmedian bolometric luminosity l_bol=8x10^45 erg/sec. furthermore, the velocitywidth of [oiii] is positively correlated with mid-infrared luminosity, whichsuggests that outflows are ultimately driven by the radiative output of thequasar. as the outflow velocity increases, some emission lines characteristicof shocks in quasi-neutral medium increase as well, which we take as furtherevidence of quasar-driven winds propagating into the interstellar medium of thehost galaxy. none of the kinematic components show correlations with thestellar velocity dispersions of the host galaxies, so there is no evidence thatany of the gas in the narrow-line region of quasars is in dynamical equilibriumwith the host galaxy. quasar feedback appears to operate above the thresholdluminosity of l_bol=3x10^45 erg/sec.

1403.4246	x-ray constraints on the local supermassive black hole occupation  fraction	distinct seed formation mechanisms are imprinted upon the fraction of dwarfgalaxies currently containing a central supermassive black hole. seeding by popiii remnants is expected to produce a higher occupation fraction than isgenerated with direct gas collapse precursors. chandra observations of nearbyearly-type galaxies can directly detect even low-level supermassive black holeactivity, and the active fraction immediately provides a firm lower limit tothe occupation fraction. here, we use the volume-limited amuse surveys of ~200optically-selected early-type galaxies to characterize simultaneously, for thefirst time, the occupation fraction and the scaling of nuclear x-ray luminositywith stellar mass, accounting for intrinsic scatter, measurement uncertainties,and x-ray limits. for early-type galaxies with log(m_star/m_sun)&lt;10, we obtaina lower limit to the occupation fraction of &gt;20% (at 95% confidence), but fulloccupation cannot be excluded. the preferred dependence of log(l_x) uponlog(m_star) has a slope of about 0.7-0.8, consistent with the "downsizing"trend previously identified from the amuse dataset, and a uniform eddingtonefficiency is disfavored at ~2 sigma. we provide guidelines for the futureprecision with which these parameters may be refined with larger or moresensitive samples.

1404.1921	gemini long-slit observations of luminous obscured quasars: further  evidence for an upper limit on the size of the narrow-line region	we examine the spatial extent of the narrow-line regions (nlrs) of a sampleof 30 luminous obscured quasars at $0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.7$ observed with spatiallyresolved gemini-n gmos long-slit spectroscopy. using the [oiii]$\lambda5007$emission feature, we estimate the size of the nlr using a cosmology-independentmeasurement: the radius where the surface brightness falls to 10$^{-15}$ ergs$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$. we then explore the effects of atmosphericseeing on nlr size measurements and conclude that direct measurements of thenlr size from observed profiles are too large by 0.1 - 0.2 dex on average, ascompared to measurements made to best-fit s\'{e}rsic or voigt profilesconvolved with the seeing. these data, which span a full order of magnitude inir luminosity ($\log{(l_{8 \mu \mathrm{m}} / \mathrm{erg\, s}^{-1})} = 44.4 -45.4$) also provide strong evidence that there is a flattening of therelationship between nlr size and agn luminosity at a seeing-corrected size of$\sim 7$ kpc. the objects in this sample have high luminosities which placethem in a previously under-explored portion of the size-luminosityrelationship. these results support the existence of a maximal size of thenarrow-line region around luminous quasars; beyond this size either there isnot enough gas, or the gas is over-ionized and does not produce enough[oiii]$\lambda5007$ emission.

1405.6711	offset active galactic nuclei as tracers of galaxy mergers and  supermassive black hole growth	offset active galactic nuclei (agns) are agns that are in ongoing galaxymergers, which produce kinematic offsets in the agns relative to their hostgalaxies. offset agns are also close relatives of dual agns. we conduct asystematic search for offset agns in the sloan digital sky survey, by selectingagn emission lines that exhibit statistically significant line-of-sightvelocity offsets relative to systemic. from a parent sample of 18314 type 2agns at z&lt;0.21, we identify 351 offset agn candidates with velocity offsets of50 km/s &lt; |v| &lt; 410 km/s. when we account for projection effects in theobserved velocities, we estimate that 4% - 8% of agns are offset agns. wedesigned our selection criteria to bypass velocity offsets produced by rotatinggas disks, agn outflows, and gravitational recoil of supermassive black holes,but follow-up observations are still required to confirm our candidates asoffset agns. we find that the fraction of agns that are offset candidatesincreases with agn bolometric luminosity, from 0.7% to 6% over the luminosityrange 43 &lt; log(l_bol) [erg/s] &lt; 46. if these candidates are shown to be bonafide offset agns, then this would be direct observational evidence that galaxymergers preferentially trigger high-luminosity agns. finally, we find that thefraction of agns that are offset agn candidates increases from 1.9% at z=0.1 to32% at z=0.7, in step with the growth in the galaxy merger fraction over thesame redshift range.

0803.1952	properties of active galaxies deduced from h i observations	we completed a new survey for h i emission for a large, well-defined sampleof 154 nearby (z &lt; 0.1) galaxies with type 1 agns. we make use of the extensivedatabase presented in a companion paper to perform a comprehensive appraisal ofthe cold gas content in active galaxies and to seek new strategies toinvestigate the global properties of the host galaxies and their relationshipto their central black holes (bhs). we show that the bh mass obeys a strong,roughly linear relation with the host galaxy's dynamical mass. bh mass followsa looser, though still highly significant, correlation with the maximumrotation velocity of the galaxy, as expected from the known scaling betweenrotation velocity and central velocity dispersion. neither of these h i-basedcorrelations is as tight as the more familiar relations between bh mass andbulge luminosity or velocity dispersion, but they offer the advantage of beinginsensitive to the glare of the nucleus and therefore are promising new toolsfor probing the host galaxies of both nearby and distant agns. we presentevidence for substantial ongoing bh growth in the most actively accreting agns.in these nearby systems, bh growth appears to be delayed with respect to theassembly of the host galaxy but otherwise has left no detectable perturbationto its mass-to-light ratio or its global gas content. the host galaxies of type1 agns, including those luminous enough to qualify as quasars, are generallygas-rich systems, possessing a cold interstellar medium reservoir at least asabundant as that in inactive galaxies of the same morphological type. thiscalls into question current implementations of agn feedback in models of galaxyformation that predict strong cold gas depletion in unobscured agns.

1506.07535	the sloan digital sky survey reverberation mapping project:  post-starburst signatures in quasar host galaxies at z &lt; 1	quasar host galaxies are key for understanding the relation between galaxiesand the supermassive black holes (smbhs) at their centers. we present a studyof 191 broad-line quasars and their host galaxies at z &lt; 1, using highsignal-to-noise ratio (snr) spectra produced by the sloan digital sky surveyreverberation mapping project. clear detection of stellar absorption linesallows a reliable decomposition of the observed spectra into nuclear and hostcomponents, using spectral models of quasar and stellar radiations as well asemission lines from the interstellar medium. we estimate age, mass (m*), andvelocity dispersion (sigma*) of the host stars, the star formation rate (sfr),quasar luminosity, and smbh mass (mbh), for each object. the quasars arepreferentially hosted by massive galaxies with m* ~ 10^{11} msun characterizedby stellar ages around a billion years, which coincides with the transitionphase of normal galaxies from the blue cloud to the red sequence. the hostgalaxies have relatively low sfrs and fall below the main sequence ofstar-forming galaxies at similar redshifts. these facts suggest that the hostshave experienced an episode of major star formation sometime in the pastbillion years, which was subsequently quenched or suppressed. the derived mbh -sigma* and mbh - m* relations agree with our past measurements and areconsistent with no evolution from the local universe. the present analysisdemonstrates that reliable measurements of stellar properties of quasar hostgalaxies are possible with high-snr fiber spectra, which will be acquired inlarge numbers with future powerful instruments such as the subaru prime focusspectrograph.

1509.03640	now you see it, now you don't: the disappearing central engine of the  quasar j1011+5442	we report the discovery of a new "changing-look" quasar, sdssj101152.98+544206.4, through repeat spectroscopy from the time domainspectroscopic survey. this is an addition to a small but growing set of quasarswhose blue continua and broad optical emission lines have been observed todecline by a large factor on a time scale of approximately a decade. the 5100angstrom monochromatic continuum luminosity of this quasar drops by a factor of&gt; 9.8 in a rest-frame time interval of &lt; 9.7 years, while the broad h-alphaluminosity drops by a factor of 55 in the same amount of time. the width of thebroad h-alpha line increases in the dim state such that the black hole massderived from the appropriate single-epoch scaling relation agrees between thetwo epochs within a factor of 3. the fluxes of the narrow emission lines do notappear to change between epochs. the light curve obtained by the catalina skysurvey suggests that the transition occurs within a rest-frame time interval ofapproximately 500 days. we examine three possible mechanisms for thistransition suggested in the recent literature. an abrupt change in thereddening towards the central engine is disfavored by the substantialdifference between the timescale to obscure the central engine and the observedtimescale of the transition. a decaying tidal disruption flare is consistentwith the decay rate of the light curve but not with the prolonged bright statepreceding the decay, nor can this scenario provide the power required by theluminosities of the emission lines. an abrupt drop in the accretion rate ontothe supermassive black hole appears to be the most plausible explanation forthe rapid dimming.

1509.04291	the origin of double-peaked narrow lines in active galactic nuclei i:  very large array detections of dual agns and agn outflows	we have examined a subset of 18 active galactic nuclei (agns) drawn from asample of 81 galaxies that possess double-peaked narrow optical emission linespectra in the sloan digital sky survey, have two optical agn emissioncomponents separated by &gt;0.2", and are detected in the faint images of theradio sky at twenty-centimeters survey. without follow-up observations, thesources of the double-peaked narrow emission lines are uncertain, and may beproduced by kpc-scale separation dual active supermassive black holes, agnoutflows, or disk rotation. in this work, we propose a new methodology tocharacterize double-peaked narrow emission-line galaxies based on opticallong-slit spectroscopy and high resolution multi-band very large arrayobservations. the nature of the radio emission in the sample galaxies isvaried. of the 18 galaxies, we detect two compact flat-spectrum radio coreswith projected spatial separations on the sky between 0.6-1.6 kpc in threegalaxies: j1023+3243, j1158+3231, and j1623+0808. the two radio sources arespatially coincident with the two optical components of ionized gas withagn-like line ratios, which confirms the presence of dual agns in these threegalaxies. dual agns account for only ~15% (3/18) of the double-peaked agns inour sample. gas kinematics produce ~75% (13/18) of the double-peaked narrowemission lines, distributed in the following way: 7 agn wind-driven outflows, 5radio-jet driven outflows, and one rotating narrow-line region. the remaining~10% (2/18) are ambiguous cases. our method demonstrates the power of spatiallyresolved spectroscopy and high resolution radio observations for theidentification of agn outflows and agn pairs with angular separations as smallas 0.18".

1510.02802	the sloan digital sky survey reverberation mapping project: first  broad-line hbeta and mgii lags at z&gt;~0.3 from six-month spectroscopy	reverberation mapping (rm) measurements of broad-line region (blr) lags inz&gt;0.3 quasars are important for directly measuring black hole masses in thesedistant objects, but so far there have been limited attempts and success giventhe practical difficulties of rm in this regime. here we report preliminaryresults of 15 blr lag measurements from the sloan digital sky surveyreverberation mapping (sdss-rm) project, a dedicated rm program withmulti-object spectroscopy designed for rm over a wide redshift range. the lagsare based on the 2014 spectroscopic light curves alone (32 epochs over 6months) and focus on the hbeta and mgii broad lines in the 100 lowest-redshift(z&lt;0.8) quasars included in sdss-rm; they represent a small subset of the lagsthat sdss-rm (including 849 quasars to z~4.5) is expected to deliver. thereported preliminary lag measurements are for intermediate-luminosity quasarsat 0.3&lt;~z&lt;0.8, including 9 hbeta lags and 6 mgii lags, for the first timeextending rm results to this redshift-luminosity regime and providing directquasar black hole mass estimates over ~ half of cosmic time. the mgii lags alsoincrease the number of known mgii lags by several-fold, and start to explorethe utility of mgii for rm at high redshift. the location of these new lags athigher redshifts on the observed blr size-luminosity relationship isstatistically consistent with previous hbeta results at z&lt;0.3. however, anindependent constraint on the relationship slope at z&gt;0.3 is not yet possibledue to the limitations in our current sample. our results demonstrate thegeneral feasibility and potential of multi-object rm for z&gt;0.3 quasars.

1511.00013	star formation in quasar hosts and the origin of radio emission in  radio-quiet quasars	radio emission from radio-quiet quasars may be due to star formation in thequasar host galaxy, to a jet launched by the supermassive black hole, or torelativistic particles accelerated in a wide-angle radiatively-driven outflow.in this paper we examine whether radio emission from radio-quiet quasars is abyproduct of star formation in their hosts. to this end we use infraredspectroscopy and photometry from spitzer and herschel to estimate or placeupper limits on star formation rates in hosts of ~300 obscured and unobscuredquasars at z&lt;1. we find that low-ionization forbidden emission lines such as[neii] and [neiii] are likely dominated by quasar ionization and do not providereliable star formation diagnostics in quasar hosts, while pah emissionfeatures may be suppressed due to the destruction of pah molecules by thequasar radiation field. while the bolometric luminosities of our sources aredominated by the quasars, the 160 micron fluxes are likely dominated by starformation, but they too should be used with caution. we estimate median starformation rates to be 6-29 msun/year, with obscured quasars at the high end ofthis range. this star formation rate is insufficient to explain the observedradio emission from quasars by an order of magnitude, with log(l_radio,observed/l_radio, sf)=0.6-1.3 depending on quasar type and star formationestimator. although radio-quiet quasars in our sample lie close to the 8-1000micron infrared / radio correlation characteristic of the star-forminggalaxies, both their infrared emission and their radio emission are dominatedby the quasar activity, not by the host galaxy.

1511.02883	on r-w1 as a diagnostic to discover obscured active galactic nuclei in  wide-area x-ray surveys	capitalizing on the all-sky coverage of {\it wise}, and the 35\% and 50\% skycoverage from sdss and pan-starrs, respectively, we explore the efficacy of$m_{r}$ (optical) - $m_{3.4 \mu m}$ (mid-infrared), hereafter $r-w1$, as acolor diagnostic to identify obscured supermassive black hole accretion inwide-area x-ray surveys. we use the $\sim$16.5 deg$^2$ stripe 82 x-ray surveydata as a test-bed to compare $r-w1$ with $r-k$, an oft-used obscured agnselection criterion, and examine where different classes of objects lie in thisparameter space. most stars follow a well-defined path in $r-k$ vs. $r-w1$space. we demonstrate that optically normal galaxies hosting x-ray agn atredshifts $0.5&lt;z&lt;1$ can be recovered with an $r-w1&gt;4$ color-cut, while theytypically are not selected as agn based on their $w1-w2$ colors. additionally,different observed x-ray luminosity bins favor different regions in $r-w1$parameter space: moderate luminosity agn ($10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1} &lt; l_{\rm 0.5-10kev} &lt; 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$) tend to have red colors while the highestluminosity agn ($l_{\rm 0.5-10 kev} &gt; 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$) have bluer colors;higher spectroscopic completeness of the stripe 82x sample is needed todetermine whether this is a selection effect or an intrinsic property. finally,we parameterize x-ray obscuration of stripe 82x agn by calculating theirhardness ratios (hrs) and find no clear trends between hr and opticalreddening. our results will help inform best-effort practices in following-upobscured agn candidates in current and future wide-area, shallow x-ray surveys,including the all-sky {\it erosita} mission.

0806.3470	galaxies correlating with ultra-high energy cosmic rays	the pierre auger observatory reports that 20 of the 27 highest energy cosmicrays have arrival directions within 3.2 deg of a nearby galaxy in theveron-cetty &amp; veron catalog of quasars and active galactic nuclei (12th ed.),with ~5 of the correlations expected by chance. in this paper we examine thecorrelated galaxies to gain insight into the possible uhecr sources. we findthat 14 of the 21 correlated vcv galaxies are agns and we determine theirbolometric luminosities. the remaining 7 are primarily star-forming galaxies.the bolometric luminosities of the correlated agns are all greater than 5 x10^{42} erg/s, which may explain the absence of uhecrs from the virgo region inspite of the large number of vcv galaxies in virgo, since most of the vcvgalaxies in the virgo region are low luminosity agns. interestingly, thebolometric luminosities of most of the agns are significantly lower thanrequired to satisfy the minimum condition for uhecr acceleration in acontinuous jet. if a uhecr-agn correlation is substantiated with furtherstatistics, our results lend support to the recently proposed ``giant agnflare" mechanism for uhecr acceleration.

astro-ph;0404110	active galactic nuclei with candidate intermediate-mass black holes	we present an initial sample of 19 intermediate-mass black hole candidates inactive galactic nuclei culled from the first data release of the sloan digitalsky survey. using the linewidth-luminosity-mass scaling relation establishedfor broad-line active nuclei, we estimate black hole masses in the range of 8 x10^4 - 10^6 solar masses, a regime in which only two objects are currentlyknown. the absolute magnitudes are faint for active galactic nuclei, rangingfrom m_g of -15 to -18 mag, while the bolometric luminosities are all close tothe eddington limit. the entire sample formally satisfies the linewidthcriterion for so-called narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies; however, they display awider range of feii and [oiii] (5007) line strengths than is typically observedin this class of objects. although the available imaging data are ofinsufficient quality to ascertain the detailed morphologies of the hostgalaxies, it is likely that the majority of the hosts are relatively late-typesystems. the host galaxies have estimated g-band luminosities ~ 1 mag fainterthan m* for the general galaxy population at z of 0.1. beyond simply extendingthe known mass range of central black holes in galactic nuclei, these objectsprovide unique observational constraints on the progenitors of supermassiveblack holes. they are also expected to contribute significantly to theintegrated signal for future gravitational wave experiments.

astro-ph;0503675	a comparison of stellar and gaseous kinematics in the nuclei of active  galaxies	to investigate the relationship between black holes and their host galaxies,many groups have used the width of the [o iii] 5007 line as a substitute forthe stellar velocity dispersion (sigma*) of galaxy bulges. we directly testthis assumption with a large and homogeneous sample of narrow-line activegalactic nuclei from the sloan digital sky survey. we consider multipletransitions ([o ii] 3727, [o iii] 5007, and [s ii] 6716, 6731) and varioustechniques for quantifying the line width in order to obtain a calibrationbetween the gas velocity dispersion, sigma_g, and sigma*. we find that sigma_gof the low-ionization lines traces sigma*, as does sigma_g for the core of [oiii] after its asymmetric blue wing is properly removed, although in all casesthe correlation between sigma_g and sigma* has considerable scatter. while thegas kinematics of the narrow-line region of active galaxies are primarilygoverned by the gravitational potential of the stars, the accretion rate, astraced by the eddington luminosity ratio, seems to play an important secondaryrole. departures from virial motions correlate systematically with accretionrate. we discuss the implications of these results for previous studies thatuse [o iii] line widths to infer stellar velocity dispersions in quasars andnarrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies.

astro-ph;0509198	the radio quiescence of active galaxies with high accretion rates	we present 6 cm very large array observations of the greene &amp; ho (2004)sample of 19 low-mass active galaxies with high accretion rates. this is one ofthe only studies of a uniform sample of narrow-line seyfert 1 (nls1) galaxieswith such high sensitivity and resolution. although we detect only one source,the entire sample is very radio-quiet down to strong limits. gh10 was found tohave a radio power of 8.5 x 10^21 w/hz, and a ratio r = f(6 cm)/f(4400 a) of2.8. the 3 sigma upper limits for the remaining nondetections correspond toradio powers from 3 x 10^20 to 8 x 10^21 w/hz and 0.47 &lt; r &lt;9.9. stacking allnondetections yields an even stronger upper limit of r &lt; 0.27. an assessment ofexisting observations in the literature confirms our finding that nls1s areconsistently radio-quiet, with a radio-loud fraction of 0%-6%, which issignificantly lower than the 10%-20% observed in the general quasar population.by analogy with stellar-mass black holes, we argue that agns undergo a statetransition at l_bol/l_edd~0.01. below this value a radiatively inefficientaccretion flow effectively drives an outflow, which disappears when the flowturns into an optically thick, geometrically thin disk, or a radiationpressure-dominated slim disk at still higher l_bol/l_edd.

astro-ph;0509568	spatially-resolved narrow line region kinematics in active galactic  nuclei	we have analyzed hst spectroscopy of 24 nearby agns to investigatespatially-resolved gas kinematics in the narrow line region (nlr). theseobservations effectively isolate the nuclear line profiles on less than 100 pcscales and are used to investigate the origin of the substantial scatterbetween the widths of strong nlr lines and the stellar velocity dispersionsigma_* of the host galaxy, a quantity which relates with substantially lessscatter to the mass of the central, supermassive black hole, and more generallycharacterize variations in the nlr velocity field with radius. we find thatline widths measured with stis at a range of spatial scales systematicallyunderestimate both sigma_* and the line width measured from ground-basedobservations, although they do have comparably large scatter to the relationbetween ground-based nlr line width and sigma_*. there are no obvious trends inthe residuals when compared with a range of host galaxy and nuclear properties.the widths and asymmetries of [oiii] 5007 and [sii] 6716, 6731 as a function ofradius exhibit a wide range of behavior. some of the most common phenomena aresubstantial width increases from the stis to the large-scale, ground-basedaperture and almost no change in line profile between the unresolved nuclearspectrum and ground-based measurements. we identify asymmetries in asurprisingly large fraction of low-ionization [sii] line profiles and severalexamples of substantial red asymmetries in both [oiii] and [sii]. these resultsunderscore the complexity of the circumnuclear material that constitutes thenlr and suggest that the scatter in the nlr width and sigma_* correlation cannot be substantially reduced with a simple set of empirical relations.

astro-ph;0512462	measuring stellar velocity dispersions in active galaxies	(abridged) we present stellar velocity dispersion (sigma*) measurements for asignificant sample of 40 broad-line (type 1) active galaxies for use in testingthe well-known relation between black hole mass and stellar velocitydispersion. the objects are selected to contain ca ii triplet, mgb triplet, andca h+k stellar absorption features in their optical spectra so that we may usethem to perform extensive tests of the systematic biases introduced by bothtemplate mismatch and contamination from the active galactic nucleus (agn). weuse the ca ii triplet as a benchmark to evaluate the utility of the otherspectral regions in the presence of agn contamination. broad fe ii emission,extending from ~5050-5520 a, in combination with narrow coronal emission lines,can seriously bias sigma* measurements from the mgb region, highlighting theneed for extreme caution in its use. however, we argue that at luminositiesconstituting a moderate fraction of the eddington limit, when the fe ii linesare both weak and smooth relative to the stellar lines, it is possible toderive meaningful measurements with careful selection of the fitting region. inparticular, to avoid the contamination of coronal lines, we advocate the use ofthe region 5250--5820 a, which is rich in fe absorption features. we lay thegroundwork for an extensive comparison between black hole mass and bulgevelocity dispersion in active galaxies, as described in a companion paper bygreene &amp; ho.

0810.1972	black holes in pseudobulges and spheroidals: a change in the black  hole-bulge scaling relations at low mass	we investigate the relationship between black hole mass and host galaxyproperties for active galaxies with the lowest black hole masses currentlyknown in galaxy nuclei. hubble space telescope imaging confirms that the hostgalaxies have correspondingly low luminosity; they are ~1 mag below l*. interms of morphology, ~60% of the members of the sample are disk-dominated, andall of these are consistent with containing a bulge or (more likely)pseudobulge, while the remainder are compact systems with no discernible diskcomponent. in general the compact components of the galaxies do not obey thefundamental plane of giant elliptical galaxies and classical bulges, but ratherare less centrally concentrated at a given luminosity, much like spheroidalgalaxies. our results strongly confirm that a classical bulge is not arequirement for a nuclear black hole. at the same time, the observed ratio ofblack hole to bulge mass is nearly an order of magnitude lower in this samplethan that seen for classical bulges. while the m-sigma relation appears tocontinue to low mass, it seems that black hole-galaxy scaling relations dodepend on galaxy structure.
