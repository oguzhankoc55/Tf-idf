0909.1554	mmtf-halpha and hst-fuv imaging of the filamentary complex in abell 1795	we have obtained deep, high spatial resolution images of the central regionof abell 1795 at halpha and [nii] (6583a) with the maryland magellan tunablefilter (mmtf), and in the far-ultraviolet (fuv) with the advanced camera forsurveys solar blind channel on the hubble space telescope (hst). the superbimage quality of the mmtf data has made it possible to resolve the known sefilament into a pair of thin, intertwined filaments extending for ~50 kpc, witha width &lt; 1 kpc. the presence of these thin, tangled strands is suggestive of acooling wake where runaway cooling is taking place, perhaps aided by anenhanced magnetic field in this region. the hst data further resolve thesestrands into chains of fuv-bright stellar clusters, indicating that thesefilaments are indeed sites of on-going star formation, but at a rate ~2 ordersof magnitude smaller than the mass-deposition rates predicted from the x-raydata. the elevated [nii]/halpha ratio and large spatial variations of thefuv/halpha flux ratio across the filaments indicate that o-star photoionizationis not solely responsible for the ionization. the data favor collisionalheating by cosmic rays either produced in-situ by magnetohydrodynamicalprocesses or conducted in from the surrounding intracluster medium.

0911.3897	neutral gas outflows and inflows in infrared-faint seyfert galaxies	previous studies of the na i d interstellar absorption line doublet haveshown that galactic winds occur in most galaxies with high infraredluminosities. however, in infrared-bright composite systems where a starburstcoexists with an active galactic nucleus (agn), it is unclear whether thestarburst, the agn, or both are driving the outflows. the present paperdescribes the results from a search for outflows in 35 infrared-faint seyfertswith 10^9.9 &lt; l_ir/l_sun &lt; 10^11, or, equivalently, star formation rates (sfr)of ~0.4 -- 9 solar masses per year, to attempt to isolate the source of theoutflow. we find that the outflow detection rates for the infrared-faintseyfert 1s (6%) and seyfert 2s (18%) are lower than previously reported forinfrared-luminous seyfert 1s (50%) and seyfert 2s (45%). the outflow kinematicsof infrared-faint and infrared-bright seyfert 2 galaxies resemble those ofstarburst galaxies, while the outflow velocities in seyfert 1 galaxies aresignificantly larger. taken together, these results suggest that the agn doesnot play a significant role in driving the outflows in most infrared-faint andinfrared-bright systems, except the high-velocity outflows seen in seyfert 1galaxies. another striking result of this study is the high rate of detectionof inflows in infrared-faint galaxies (39% of seyfert 1s, 35% of seyfert 2s),significantly larger than in infrared-luminous seyferts (15%). this inflow maybe contributing to the feeding of the agn in these galaxies, and potentiallyprovides more than enough material to power the observed nuclear activity overtypical agn lifetimes.

1001.0049	optical spectral properties of swift bat hard x-ray selected active  galactic nuclei sources	the swift burst alert telescope (bat) survey of active galactic nuclei (agn)is providing an unprecedented view of local agns (&lt;z&gt; = 0.03) and their hostgalaxy properties. in this paper, we present an analysis of the optical spectraof a sample of 64 agns from the 9-month survey, detected solely based on their14-195 kev flux. our analysis includes both archived spectra from the sloandigital sky survey and our own observations from the 2.1-m kitt peak nationalobservatory telescope. among our results, we include line ratio classificationsutilizing standard emission line diagnostic plots, [o iii] 5007 a luminosities,and h-beta derived black hole masses. as in our x-ray study, we find the type 2sources to be less luminous (in [o iii] 5007 a and 14-195 kev luminosities)with lower accretion rates than the type 1 sources. we find that the opticallyclassified liners, h ii/composite galaxies, and ambiguous sources have thelowest luminosities, while both broad line and narrow line seyferts havesimilar luminosities. from a comparison of the hard x-ray (14-195 kev) and [oiii] luminosities, we find that both the observed and extinction-corrected [oiii] luminosities are weakly correlated with x-ray luminosity. in a study ofthe host galaxy properties from both continuum fits and measurements of thestellar absorption indices, we find that the hosts of the narrow line sourceshave properties consistent with late type galaxies.

0707.3440	tracing pahs and warm dust emission in the seyfert galaxy ngc 1068	we present a study of the nearby seyfert galaxy ngc 1068 using mid- and far-infrared data acquired with the irac, irs, and mips instruments aboard thespitzer space telescope. the images show extensive 8 um and 24 um emissioncoinciding with star formation in the inner spiral approximately 15" (1 kpc)from the nucleus, and a bright complex of star formation 47" (3 kpc) sw of thenucleus. the brightest 8 um pah emission regions coincide remarkably well withknots observed in an halpha image. strong pah features at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and11.3 um are detected in irs spectra measured at numerous locations inside,within, and outside the inner spiral. the irac colors and irs spectra of theseregions rule out dust heated by the agn as the primary emission source; theseds are dominated by starlight and pah emission. the equivalent widths andflux ratios of the pah features in the inner spiral are generally consistentwith conditions in a typical spiral galaxy ism. interior to the inner spiral,the influence of the agn on the ism is evident via pah flux ratios indicativeof a higher ionization parameter and a significantly smaller mean equivalentwidth than observed in the inner spiral. the brightest 8 and 24 um emissionpeaks in the disk of the galaxy, even at distances beyond the inner spiral, arelocated within the ionization cones traced by [o iii]/hbeta, and they are alsoremarkably well aligned with the axis of the radio jets. although it ispossible that radiation from the agn may directly enhance pah excitation ortrigger the formation of ob stars that subsequently excite pah emission atthese locations in the inner spiral, the orientation of collimated radiationfrom the agn and star formation knots in the inner spiral could becoincidental.

0708.1766	the oxygen abundances of luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies	luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (lirgs and ulirgs) dominate thestar formation rate budget of the universe at z &gt; 1, yet no local measurementsof their heavy element abundances exist. we measure nuclear or near-nuclearoxygen abundances in a sample of 100 star-forming lirgs and ulirgs using new,previously published, and archival spectroscopy of strong emission lines(including [o ii] 3727, 3729 a) in galaxies with redshifts &lt;z&gt; ~ 0.1. whencompared to local emission-line galaxies of similar luminosity and mass (usingthe near-infrared luminosity-metallicity and mass-metallicity relations), wefind that lirgs and ulirgs are under-abundant by a factor of two on average. asa corollary, lirgs and ulirgs also have smaller effective yields. we concludethat the observed under-abundance results from the combination of a decrease ofabundance with increasing radius in the progenitor galaxies and strong,interaction- or merger-induced gas inflow into the galaxy nucleus. thisconclusion demonstrates that local abundance scaling relations are notuniversal, a fact that must be accounted for when interpreting abundancesearlier in the universe's history when merger-induced star formation was thedominant mode. we use our local sample to compare to high-redshift samples andassess abundance evolution in lirgs and ulirgs. we find that abundances inthese systems increased by ~0.2 dex from z ~ 0.6 to z ~ 0.1. evolution from z ~2 submillimeter galaxies to z ~ 0.1 ulirgs also appears to be present, thoughuncertainty due to spectroscopic limitations is large.

1006.3071	the luminosity function of lyman alpha emitters at redshift z=7.7	lyman alpha (lya) emission lines should be attenuated in a neutralintergalactic medium (igm). therefore the visibility of lya emitters at highredshifts can serve as a valuable probe of reionization at about the 50% level.we present an imaging search for z=7.7 lya emitting galaxies using anultra-narrowband filter (filter width= 9a) on the newfirm imager at the kittpeak national observatory. we found four candidate lya emitters in a surveyvolume of 1.4 x 10^4 mpc^3, with a line flux brighter than 6x10^-18 erg/cm^2/s(5 sigma in 2" aperture). we also performed a detailed monte-carlo simulationincorporating the instrumental effects to estimate the expected number of lyaemitters in our survey, and found that we should expect to detect one lyaemitter, assuming a non-evolving lya luminosity function (lf) between z=6.5 andz=7.7. even if one of the present candidates is spectroscopically confirmed asa z~8 lya emitter, it would indicate that there is no significant evolution ofthe lya lf from z=3.1 to z~8. while firm conclusions would need bothspectroscopic confirmations and larger surveys to boost the number counts ofgalaxies, we successfully demonstrate the feasibility of sensitivenear-infrared (1.06 um) narrow-band searches using custom filters designed toavoid the oh emission lines that make up most of the sky background.

1008.0392	on the origin of the extended halpha filaments in cooling flow clusters	we present a high spatial resolution halpha survey of 23 cooling flowclusters using the maryland magellan tunable filter (mmtf), covering 1-2 ordersof magnitude in cooling rate, dm/dt, temperature and entropy. we find 8/23(35%) of our clusters have complex, filamentary morphologies at halpha, whilean additional 7/23 (30%) have marginally extended or nuclear halpha emission,in general agreement with previous studies of line emission in cooling flowcluster bcgs. a weak correlation between the integrated near-uv luminosity andthe halpha luminosity is also found for our complete sample, with a largeamount of scatter about the expected relation for photoionization by youngstars. we detect halpha emission out to the x-ray cooling radius, but nofurther, in several clusters and find a strong correlation between the halphaluminosity contained in filaments and the x-ray cooling flow rate of thecluster, suggesting that the warm ionized gas is linked to the cooling flow.furthermore, we detect a strong enhancement in the cooling properties of theicm coincident with the halpha emission, compared to the surrounding icm at thesame radius. while the filaments in a few clusters may be entrained by buoyantradio bubbles, in general, the radially-infalling cooling flow model provides abetter explanation for the observed trends. the correlation of the halpha andx-ray properties suggests that conduction may be important in keeping thefilaments ionized. the thinness of the filaments suggests that magnetic fieldsare an important part of channeling the gas and shielding it from thesurrounding hot icm.

1101.5204	identification of a complete 160 micron flux-limited sample of infrared  galaxies in the iso lockman hole 1-deg^2 deep fields: source properties and  evidence for strong evolution in the fir luminosity function for ulirgs	we have identified a complete, flux-limited, (s_160&gt;120 mjy), sample of 160micron-selected sources from spitzer observations of the 1-deg^2 iso deep fieldregion in the lockman hole. ground-based uv, optical and near-infrared (nir)photometry and optical spectroscopy have been used to determine colors,redshifts and masses for the complete sample of 40 galaxies. spitzer-irac+mipsphotometry, supplemented by isophot data at 90 micron and 170 micron, has beenused to calculate accurate total infrared luminosities, lir(8-1000 micron), andto determine the ir luminosity function (lf) of luminous infrared galaxies(lirgs). the maximum observed redshift is z~0.80 and the maximum total infraredluminosity is log(l_ir/l_sun)=12.74. over the luminosity rangelog(l_ir/l_sun)=10-12, the lf for lirgs in the lockman hole deep field issimilar to that found previously for local sources at similar infraredluminosities. the mean host galaxy mass, log(m/m_sun)=10.7, and dominance ofhii-region spectral types, is also similar to what has been found for locallirgs, suggesting that intense starbursts likely power the bulk of the infraredluminosity for sources in this range of lir. however for the most luminoussources, log(l_ir/l_sun)&gt;12.0, we find evidence for strong evolution in the lf\propto (1+z)6\pm1, assuming pure number density evolution. these ultraluminousinfrared galaxies (ulirgs) have a larger mean host mass, log(m/m_sun)=11.0, andexhibit disturbed morphologies consistent with strong-interactions/mergers, andthey are also more likely to be characterized by starburst-agn composite or agnspectral types.

1102.1972	the effect of environment on the formation of halpha filaments and cool  cores in galaxy groups and clusters	we present the results of a combined x-ray and halpha study of 10 galaxygroups and 17 galaxy clusters using the chandra x-ray observatory and themaryland magellan tunable filter. we find no difference in the morphology ordetection frequency of halpha filaments in groups versus clusters, over themass range 10^13 &lt; m_500 &lt; 10^15 msun. the detection frequency of halphaemission is shown to be only weakly dependent on the total mass of the system,at the 52% confidence level. in contrast, we find that the presence of halphafilaments is strongly correlated with both the global (89% confidence level)and core (84%) icm entropy, as well as the x-ray cooling rate (72%). the halphafilaments are therefore an excellent proxy for the cooling icm. the halphafilaments are more strongly correlated with the cooling properties of the icmthan with the radio properties of the bcg; this further supports the scenariowhere these filaments are directly associated with a thermally-unstable,rapidly cooling icm, rather than radio bubbles. the icm cooling efficiency,defined as the x-ray cooling rate per unit gas mass, is shown to correlate withthe total system mass, indicating that groups are more efficient at coolingthan clusters. this result implies that, in systems with cool cores, agnfeedback scales with the total mass of the system, in agreement with earliersuggestions.

1102.4349	integral field spectroscopy of massive, kiloparsec-scale outflows in the  infrared-luminous qso mrk 231	the quasi-stellar object (qso)/merger mrk 231 is arguably the nearest andbest laboratory for studying qso feedback. it hosts several outflows, includingbroad-line winds, radio jets, and a poorly-understood kpc scale outflow. inthis letter, we present integral field spectroscopy from the gemini telescopethat represents the first unambiguous detection of a wide-angle, kpc scaleoutflow from a powerful qso. using neutral gas absorption, we show that thenuclear region hosts an outflow with blueshifted velocities reaching 1100 km/s,extending 2-3 kpc from the nucleus in all directions in the plane of the sky. aradio jet impacts the outflow north of the nucleus, accelerating it to evenhigher velocities (up to 1400 km/s). finally, 3.5 kpc south of the nucleus,star formation is simultaneously powering an outflow that reaches more modestvelocities of only 570 km/s. blueshifted ionized gas is also detected aroundthe nucleus at lower velocities and smaller scales. the mass and energy fluxfrom the outflow are &gt;~2.5 times the star formation rate and &gt;~0.7% of theactive galactic nucleus luminosity, consistent with negative feedback models ofqsos.

0709.2915	a connection between star formation in nuclear rings and their host  galaxies	we present results from a photometric h-alpha survey of 22 nuclear rings,aiming to provide insight into their star formation properties, including agedistribution, dynamical timescales, star formation rates, and galactic barinfluence. we find a clear relationship between the position angles andellipticities of the rings and those of their host galaxies, which indicatesthe rings are in the same plane as the disk and circular. we use populationsynthesis models to estimate ages of each h-alpha emitting hii region, whichrange from 1 myr to 10 myrs throughout the rings. we find that approximatelyhalf of the rings contain azimuthal age gradients that encompass at least 25%of the ring, although there is no apparent relationship between the presence orabsence of age gradients and the morphology of the rings or their hostgalaxies. ngc1343, ngc1530, and ngc4321 show clear bipolar age gradients, wherethe youngest hii regions are located near the two contact points of the bar andring. we speculate in these cases that the gradients are related to anincreased mass inflow rate and/or an overall higher gas density in the ring,which would allow for massive star formation to occur on short timescales,after which the galactic rotation would transport the hii regions around thering as they age. two-thirds of the barred galaxies show correlation betweenthe locations of the youngest hii region(s) in the ring and the location of thecontact points, which is consistent with predictions from numerical modeling.

1104.0665	star formation efficiency in the cool cores of galaxy clusters	we have assembled a sample of high spatial resolution far-uv (hubble spacetelescope advanced camera for surveys solar blind channel) and halpha(maryland-magellan tunable filter) imaging for 15 cool core galaxy clusters.these data provide a detailed view of the thin, extended filaments in the coresof these clusters. based on the ratio of the far-uv to halpha luminosity, theuv spectral energy distribution, and the far-uv and halpha morphology, weconclude that the warm, ionized gas in the cluster cores is photoionized bymassive, young stars in all but a few (abell 1991, abell 2052, abell 2580)systems. we show that the extended filaments, when considered separately,appear to be star-forming in the majority of cases, while the nuclei tend tohave slightly lower far-uv luminosity for a given halpha luminosity, suggestinga harder ionization source or higher extinction. we observe a slight offset inthe uv/halpha ratio from the expected value for continuous star formation whichcan be modeled by assuming intrinsic extinction by modest amounts of dust(e(b-v) ~ 0.2), or a top-heavy imf in the extended filaments. the measured starformation rates vary from ~ 0.05 msun/yr in the nuclei of non-cooling systems,consistent with passive, red ellipticals, to ~ 5 msun/yr in systems withcomplex, extended, optical filaments. comparing the estimates of the starformation rate based on uv, halpha and infrared luminosities to thespectroscopically-determined x-ray cooling rate suggests a star formationefficiency of 14(+18)(-8)%. this value represents the time-averaged fraction,by mass, of gas cooling out of the intracluster medium which turns into stars,and agrees well with the global fraction of baryons in stars required bysimulations to reproduce the stellar mass function for galaxies. this resultprovides a new constraint on the efficiency of star formation in accretingsystems.

1106.6055	searching for z~7.7 lyman alpha emitters in the cosmos field with  newfirm	the study of ly-alpha emission in the high-redshift universe is a usefulprobe of the epoch of reionization, as the ly-alpha line should be attenuatedby the intergalactic medium (igm) at low to moderate neutral hydrogenfractions. here we present the results of a deep and wide imaging search forly-alpha emitters in the cosmos field. we have used two ultra-narrowbandfilters (filter width of ~8-9 {\deg}a) on the newfirm camera, installed on themayall 4m telescope at kitt peak national observatory, in order to isolately-alpha emitters at z = 7.7; such ultra-narrowband imaging searches haveproved to be excellent at detecting ly-alpha emitters. we found 5-sigmadetections of four candidate ly-alpha emitters in a survey volume of 2.8 x 10^4mpc^3 (total survey area ~760 arcmin^2). each candidate has a line flux greaterthan 8 x 10^-18 erg s^-1 cm^-2. using these results to construct a luminosityfunction and comparing to previously established ly-alpha luminosity functionsat z = 5.7 and z = 6.5, we find no conclusive evidence for evolution of theluminosity function between z = 5.7 and z = 7.7. statistical monte carlosimulations suggest that half of these candidates are real z = 7.7 targets, andspectroscopic follow-up will be required to verify the redshift of thesecandidates. however, our results are consistent with no strong evolution in theneutral hydrogen fraction of the igm between z = 5.7 and z = 7.7, even if onlyone or two of the z = 7.7 candidates are spectroscopically confirmed.

1109.6360	an ionization cone in the dwarf starburst galaxy ngc 5253	there are few observational constraints on how the escape of ionizing photonsfrom starburst galaxies depends on galactic parameters. here, we report on thefirst major detection of an ionization cone in ngc 5253, a nearby starburstgalaxy. this high-excitation feature is identified by mapping the emission-lineratios in the galaxy using [s iii] lambda 9069, [s ii] lambda 6716, and h_alphanarrow-band images from the maryland-magellan tunable filter at las campanasobservatory. the ionization cone appears optically thin, which is suggestive ofthe escape of ionizing photons. the cone morphology is narrow with an estimatedsolid angle covering just 3% of 4pi steradians, and the young, massive clustersof the nuclear starburst can easily generate the radiation required to ionizethe cone. although less likely, we cannot rule out the possibility of anobscured agn source. an echelle spectrum along the minor axis shows complexkinematics that are consistent with outflow activity. the narrow morphology ofthe ionization cone supports the scenario that an orientation bias contributesto the difficulty in detecting lyman continuum emission from starbursts andlyman break galaxies.

1207.3793	cold molecular gas along the cooling x-ray filament in abell 1795	we present the results of interferometric observations of the cool core ofabell 1795 at co(1-0) using the combined array for research in millimeter-waveastronomy. in agreement with previous work, we detect a significant amount ofcold molecular gas (3.9 +/- 0.4 x10^9 msun) in the central ~10 kpc. we reportthe discovery of a substantial clump of cold molecular gas at clustercentricradius of 30 kpc (2.9 +/- 0.4 x10^9 msun), coincident in both position andvelocity with the warm, ionized filaments. we also place an upper limit on theh_2 mass at the outer edge of the star-forming filament, corresponding to adistance of 60 kpc (&lt;0.9 x10^9 msun). we measure a strong gradient in thehii/h_2 ratio as a function of radius, suggesting different ionizationmechanisms in the nucleus and filaments of abell1795. the total mass of coldmolecular gas (\sim7x10^9 msun) is roughly 30% of the classical coolingestimate at the same position, assuming a cooling time of 10^9 yr. combiningthe cold molecular gas mass with the uv-derived star formation rate and thewarm, ionized gas mass, the spectroscopically-derived x-ray cooling rate isfully accounted for and in good agreement with the cooling byproducts overtimescales of \sim10^9 yr. the overall agreement between the cooling rate ofthe hot intracluster medium and the mass of the cool gas reservoir suggeststhat, at least in this system, the cooling flow problem stems from a lack ofobservable cooling in the more diffuse regions at large radii.

1211.7058	an hst/wfc3-uvis view of the starburst in the cool core of the phoenix  cluster	we present hubble space telescope wide field camera 3 observations of thecore of the phoenix cluster spt-clj2344-4243 in five broadband filters spanningrest-frame 1000--5500a. these observations reveal complex, filamentary blueemission, extending for &gt;40kpc from the brightest cluster galaxy. we observe anunderlying, diffuse population of old stars, following an r^1/4 distribution,confirming that this system is somewhat relaxed. the spectral energydistribution in the inner part of the galaxy, as well as along the extendedfilaments, is a smooth continuum and is consistent with that of a star-forminggalaxy, suggesting that the extended, filamentary emission is not due to thecentral agn, either from a large-scale ionized outflow or scattered polarizeduv emission, but rather a massive population of young stars. we estimate anextinction-corrected star formation rate of 798 +/- 42 msun/yr, consistent withour earlier work based on low spatial resolution ultraviolet, optical, andinfrared imaging. the lack of tidal features and multiple bulges, combine withthe need for an exceptionally massive (&gt;10^11 msun) cold gas reservoir, suggestthat this star formation is not the result of a merger of gas-rich galaxies.instead, we propose that the high x-ray cooling rate of ~2700 msun/yr is theorigin of the cold gas reservoir. the combination of such a high cooling rateand the relatively weak radio source in the cluster core suggests that feedbackhas been unable to halt cooling in this system, leading to this tremendousburst of star formation.

1301.5642	gbt detection of polarization-dependent hi absorption and hi outflows in  local ulirgs and quasars	we present the results of a 21-cm hi survey of 27 local massive gas-richlate-stage mergers and merger remnants with the robert c. byrd green banktelescope (gbt). these remnants were selected from the quasar/ulirg evolutionstudy (quest) sample of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs; l$_{8-1000 \mum} &gt; 10^{12}$ l$_\odot$) and quasars; our targets are all bolometricallydominated by active galactic nuclei (agn) and sample the later phases of theproposed ulirg-to-quasar evolutionary sequence. we find the prevalence of hiabsorption (emission) to be 100% (29%) in ulirgs with hi detections, 100% (88%)in fir-strong quasars, and 63% (100%) in fir-weak quasars. the absorptionfeatures are associated with powerful neutral outflows that change from beingmainly driven by star formation in ulirgs to being driven by the agn in thequasars. these outflows have velocities that exceed 1500 km s$^{-1}$ in somecases. unexpectedly, we find polarization-dependent hi absorption in 57% of ourspectra (88% and 63% of the fir-strong and fir-weak quasars, respectively). weattribute this result to absorption of polarized continuum emission from thesesources by foreground hi clouds. about 60% of the quasars displaying polarizedspectra are radio-loud, far higher than the $\sim$10% observed in the generalagn population. this discrepancy suggests that radio jets play an importantrole in shaping the environments in these galaxies. these systems may representa transition phase in the evolution of gas-rich mergers into "mature" radiogalaxies.

1303.6866	the multiphase structure and power sources of galactic winds in major  mergers	massive, galaxy-scale outflows are known to be ubiquitous in major mergers ofdisk galaxies in the local universe. in this paper, we explore the multiphasestructure and power sources of galactic winds in six ultraluminous infraredgalaxies (ulirgs) at z &lt; 0.06 using deep integral field spectroscopy with thegemini multi-object spectrograph (gmos) on gemini north. we probe the neutral,ionized, and dusty gas phases using na i d, strong emission lines ([o i],halpha, and [n ii]), and continuum colors, respectively. we separate outflowmotions from those due to rotation and tidal perturbations, and find that allof the galaxies in our sample host high-velocity flows on kiloparsec scales.the properties of these outflows are consistent with multiphase (ionized,neutral, and dusty) collimated bipolar winds emerging along the minor axis ofthe nuclear disk to scales of 1-2 kpc. in two cases, these collimated windstake the form of bipolar superbubbles, identified by clear kinematicsignatures. less collimated (but still high-velocity) flows are also present onscales up to 5 kpc in most systems. the three galaxies in our sample withobscured qsos host higher velocity outflows than those in the three galaxieswith no evidence for an agn. the peak outflow velocity in each of the qsos isin the range 1450-3350 km/s, and the highest velocities (2000-3000 km/s) areseen only in ionized gas. the outflow energy and momentum in the qsos aredifficult to produce from a starburst alone, but are consistent with the qsocontributing significantly to the driving of the flow. finally, when all gasphases are accounted for, the outflows are massive enough to provide negativefeedback to star formation.

1307.6216	dusty winds: extraplanar pah features of nearby galaxies	recent observations have shown the presence of dust and molecular material ingalactic winds, but relatively little is known about the distribution of theseoutflow components. to shed some light on this issue, we have used irac imagesfrom the spitzer space telescope archive to investigate polycyclic aromatichydrocarbon (pah) emission from a sample of 16 local galaxies with known winds.our focus on nearby sources (median distance 8.6 mpc) has revealed detailed pahstructure in the winds and allowed us to measure extraplanar pah emission. wehave identified extraplanar pah features on scales of ~ 0.8 - 6.0 kpc. we finda nearly linear correlation between the amount of extraplanar pah emission andthe total infrared flux, a proxy for star formation activity in the disk. ourresults also indicate a correlation between the height of extraplanar pahemission and star formation rate surface density, which supports the idea of asurface density threshold on the energy or momentum injection rate forproducing detectable extraplanar wind material.

1307.6259	the starburst-driven molecular wind in ngc 253 and the suppression of  star formation	the under-abundance of very massive galaxies in the universe is frequentlyattributed to the effect of galactic winds. although ionized galactic winds arereadily observable most of the expelled mass is likely in cooler atomic andmolecular phases. expanding molecular shells observed in starburst systems suchas ngc 253 and m 82 may facilitate the entrainment of molecular gas in thewind. while shell properties are well constrained, determining the amount ofoutflowing gas emerging from such shells and the connection between this gasand the ionized wind requires spatial resolution &lt;100 pc coupled withsensitivity to a wide range of spatial scales, hitherto not available. here wereport observations of ngc 253, a nearby starburst galaxy (d~3.4 mpc) known topossess a wind, which trace the cool molecular wind at 50 pc resolution. atthis resolution the extraplanar molecular gas closely tracks the h{\alpha}filaments, and it appears connected to molecular expanding shells located inthe starburst region. these observations allow us to directly measure themolecular outflow rate to be &gt; 3 msun/yr and likely ~9 msun/yr. this implies aratio of mass-outflow rate to star formation rate of at least {\eta}~1-3,establishing the importance of the starburst-driven wind in limiting the starformation activity and the final stellar content.

1311.0867	the state of the warm and cold gas in the extreme starburst at the core  of the phoenix galaxy cluster (spt-clj2344-4243)	[abridged] we present new optical integral field spectroscopy (gemini south)and submillimeter spectroscopy (submillimeter array) of the central galaxy inthe phoenix cluster (spt-clj2344-4243). this cluster was previously reported tohave a massive starburst (~800 msun/yr) in the central, brightest clustergalaxy, most likely fueled by the rapidly-cooling intracluster medium. thesenew data reveal a complex emission-line nebula, extending for &gt;30 kpc from thecentral galaxy. the total halpha luminosity, assuming halpha/hbeta = 2.85, isl_ha = 7.6 +/- 0.4 x10^43 erg/s, making this the most luminous emission linenebula detected in the center of a cool core cluster. overall, the relativefluxes of the low-ionization lines (e.g., [o ii], hbeta) to the uv continuumare consistent with photoionization by young stars. in both the center of thegalaxy and in a newly-discovered highly-ionized plume to the north of thegalaxy, the ionization ratios are consistent with both shocks and agnphotoionization. we speculate that this extended plume may be a galactic wind,driven and partially photoionized by both the starburst and central agn. wefind evidence for shocks throughout the ism of the central galaxy, most likelydriven by a combination of stellar winds from massive young stars,core-collapse supernovae, and the central agn. in addition to the warm, ionizedgas, we detect a substantial amount of cold, molecular gas via the co(3-2)transition, coincident in position with the galaxy center. we infer a moleculargas mass of m_h2 = 2.2 +/- 0.6 x10^10 msun, which implies that the starburstwill consume its fuel in ~30 myr if it is not replenished. the combination ofthe high level of turbulence in the warm phase and the high l_ir/m_h2 ratiosuggests that this violent starburst may be in the process of quenching itself.

1311.2227	new constraints on the escape of ionizing photons from starburst  galaxies using ionization-parameter mapping	the fate of ionizing radiation in starburst galaxies is key to understandingcosmic reionization. however, the galactic parameters on which the escapefraction of ionizing radiation depend are not well understood.ionization-parameter mapping provides a simple, yet effective, way to study theradiative transfer in starburst galaxies. we obtain emission-line ratio maps of[siii]/[sii] for six, nearby, dwarf starbursts: ngc 178, ngc 1482, ngc 1705,ngc 3125, ngc 7126, and he 2-10. the narrow-band images are obtained with themaryland-magellan tunable filter at las campanas observatory. using these data,we previously reported the discovery of an optically thin ionization cone inngc 5253, and here we also discover a similar ionization cone in ngc 3125. thislatter cone has an opening angle of 40+/-5 degrees (0.4 ster), indicating thatthe passageways through which ionizing radiation may travel correspond to asmall solid angle. additionally, there are three sample galaxies that havewinds and/or superbubble activity, which should be conducive to escapingradiation, yet they are optically thick. these results support the scenariothat an orientation bias limits our ability to directly detect escaping lymancontinuum in many starburst galaxies. a comparison of the star-formationproperties and histories of the optically thin and thick galaxies is consistentwith the model that high escape fractions are limited to galaxies that are oldenough (&gt; 3 myr) for mechanical feedback to have cleared optically thinpassageways in the ism, but young enough (&lt; 5 myr) that the ionizing stars arestill present.

1401.6798	sdss1133: an unusually persistent transient in a nearby dwarf galaxy	while performing a survey to detect recoiling supermassive black holes, wehave identified an unusual source having a projected offset of 800 pc from anearby dwarf galaxy. the object, sdss j113323.97+550415.8, exhibits broademission lines and strong variability. while originally classified as asupernova (sn) because of its nondetection in 2005, we detect it in recent andpast observations over 63 yr and find over a magnitude of rebrightening in thelast 2 years. using high-resolution adaptive optics observations, we constrainthe source emission region to be &lt;12 pc and find a disturbed host-galaxymorphology indicative of recent merger activity. observations taken over morethan a decade show narrow [o iii] lines, constant ultraviolet emission, broadbalmer lines, a constant putative black hole mass over a decade of observationsdespite changes in the continuum, and optical emission-line diagnosticsconsistent with an active galactic nucleus (agn). however, the optical spectraexhibit blueshifted absorption, and eventually narrow fe ii and [ca ii]emission, each of which is rarely found in agn spectra. while this peculiarsource displays many of the observational properties expected of a potentialblack hole recoil candidate, some of the properties could also be explained bya luminous blue variable star (lbv) erupting for decades since 1950, followedby a type iin sn in 2001. interpreted as an lbv followed by a sn analogous tosn 2009ip, the multi-decade lbv eruptions would be the longest ever observed,and the broad halpha emission would be the most luminous ever observed at latetimes (&gt;10 yr), larger than that of unusually luminous supernovae such as sn1988z, suggesting one of the most extreme episodes of pre-sn mass loss everdiscovered.

1411.2836	alma reveals the molecular medium fueling the nearest nuclear starburst	we use alma to derive the mass, length, and time scales associated with thenuclear starburst in ngc 253. this region forms ~2 m_sun/yr of stars andresembles other starbursts in scaling relations, with star formation consumingthe gas reservoir 10 times faster than in galaxy disks. we present observationsof co, the high effective density transitions hcn(1-0), hco+(1-0), cs(2-1), andtheir isotopologues. we identify ten clouds that appear as peaks in lineemission and enhancements in the hcn-to-co ratio. these clouds are massive(~10^7 m_sun) structures with sizes (~30 pc) similar to gmcs in other systems.compared to disk galaxy gmcs, they show high line widths (~20-40 km/s) giventheir size, with implied mach numbers ~90. the clouds also show high surface(~6,000 m_sun/pc^2) and volume densities (n_h2~2,000 cm^-3). given these,self-gravity can explain the line widths. this short free fall time (~0.7 myr)helps explain the more efficient star formation in ngc 253. we also considerthe starburst region as a whole. the geometry is confused by the highinclination, but simple models support a non-axisymmetric, bar-like geometrywith a compact, clumpy region of high gas density embedded in an extended codistribution. even for the whole region, the surface density still exceeds thatof a disk galaxy gmc. the orbital time (~10 myr), disk free fall time (&lt;~ 3myr), and disk crossing time (&lt;~ 3 myr) are each much shorter than in a normalspiral galaxy disk. some but not all aspects of the structure correspond topredictions from assuming vertical dynamical equilibrium or a marginally stablerotating disk. finally, the co-to-h2 conversion factor implied by our cloudcalculations is approximately galactic, contrasting with results showing a lowvalue for the whole starburst region. the contrast provides resolved supportfor the idea of mixed molecular ism phases in starburst galaxies.

astro-ph;0104455	the farthest known supernova: support for an accelerating universe and a  glimpse of the epoch of deceleration	we present photometric observations of an apparent type ia supernova (sn ia)at a redshift of ~1.7, the farthest sn observed to date. sn 1997ff, wasdiscovered in a repeat observation by the hst of the hdf-), and serendipitouslymonitored with nicmos on hst throughout the gto campaign. the sn type can bedetermined from the host galaxy type:an evolved, red elliptical lacking enoughrecent star formation to provide a significant population of core-collapse sne.the class- ification is further supported by diagnostics available from theobserved colors and temporal behavior of the sn, both of which match a typicalsn ia. the photo- metric record of the sn includes a dozen flux measurements inthe i, j, and h bands spanning 35 days in the observed frame. the redshiftderived from the sn photometry, z=1.7+/-0.1, is in excellent agreement with theredshift estimate of z=1.65+/-0.15 derived from theu_300,b_450,v_606,i_814,j_110,j_125,h_160, h_165,k_s photometry of the galaxy.optical and near-infrared spectra of the host provide a very tentativespectroscopic redshift of 1.755. fits to observations of the sn provideconstraints for the redshift-distance relation of sne~ia and a powerful test ofthe current accelerating universe hypothesis. the apparent sn brightness isconsistent with that expected in the decelerating phase of the preferredcosmological model, omega_m~1/3, omega_lambda~2/3. it is inconsistent with greydust or simple luminosity evolution, candidate astro- physical effects whichcould mimic past evidence for an accelerating universe from sne ia at z~0.5.weconsider several sources of possible systematic error including lensing, snmisclassification, selection bias, and calibration errors. currently, none ofthese effects appears likely to challenge our conclusions.

astro-ph;0201008	identification of galactic wind candidates using excitation maps:  tunable-filter discovery of a shock-excited wind in the galaxy ngc 1482	multi-line imaging of the nearby disk galaxy ngc 1482 with the taurus tunablefilter (ttf) on the anglo-australian telescope reveals a remarkablehourglass-shaped [n ii] 6583/h-alpha excitation structure suggestive of agalactic wind extending at least 1.5 kpc above and below the disk of the hostgalaxy. long-slit spectroscopy confirms the existence of a large-scale outflowin this galaxy. the entrained wind material has [n ii] 6583/h-alpha ratios inexcess of unity while the disk material is characterized by h ii region-likeline ratios indicative of a starburst. expansion velocities of order 250 km/sare detected in the wind material, and a lower limit of 2 x 10^{53} ergs isderived for the kinetic energy of the outflow based on the gas kinematics andthe amount of ionized material entrained in the outflow. this is the first timeto our knowledge that a galactic wind is discovered using excitation maps. thisline ratio technique represents a promising new way to identify wind galaxycandidates before undergoing more time-consuming spectroscopic follow-ups. thismethod of selection may be particularly useful for samples of galaxies atmoderate redshifts.

astro-ph;0201371	keck absorption-line spectroscopy of galactic winds in ultraluminous  infrared galaxies	in this paper, we present moderately-high resolution (~65 km/s) spectroscopy,acquired with esi on keck ii, of 11 ultraluminous infrared galaxies at z &lt; 0.3from the iras 1 jy sample. the targets were chosen as good candidates to hostgalaxy-scale outflows, and most have infrared luminosities dominated by starformation. we use a chi-squared minimization to fit one- to three-componentprofiles to the nai d interstellar absorption doublet in each object. assumingthat gas blueshifted by more than 70 km/s relative to the systemic velocity ofthe host is outflowing, we detect outflows in 73% of these objects. we adopt asimple model of a mass-conserving free wind to infer mass outflow rates in therange (dm/dt)_tot(h) = 13-133 m_sun/yr for galaxies hosting a wind. thesevalues of (dm/dt)_tot, normalized to the corresponding global star formationrates inferred from infrared luminosities, are in the range eta = (dm/dt)_tot /sfr = 0.1-0.7. this is on average a factor of only 10 less than eta from recentmeasurements of nearby dwarfs, edge-on spirals, and lower-luminosity infraredgalaxies. within our sample, we conclude that eta has no dependence on the massof the host (parameterized by host galaxy kinematics and absolute r- andk'-band magnitudes). we also attempt to estimate the average escape fraction&lt;f_esc&gt; = sum(dm/dt_esc^i) / sum(dm/dt_tot^i) and ``ejection efficiency''&lt;delta&gt; = sum(dm/dt_esc^i) / sum(sfr^i) for our sample, which we find to be\~0.4-0.5 and ~0.1, respectively. the complex absorption-line properties of mrk231, an ultraluminous infrared galaxy which is optically classified as aseyfert 1, are discussed separately in an appendix.

astro-ph;0304471	extraplanar emission-line gas in edge-on spiral galaxies. ii. optical  spectroscopy	the results from deep long-slit spectroscopy of nine edge-on spiral galaxieswith known extraplanar line emission are reported. emission from halpha, [n ii]lambda 6548, 6583, and [s ii] lambda 6716, 6731 is detected out to heights of afew kpc in all of these galaxies. several other fainter diagnostic lines suchas [o i] lambda 6300, [o iii] lambda 4959, 5007, and he i lambda 5876 are alsodetected over a smaller scale. the relative strengths, centroids and widths ofthe various emission lines provide constraints on the electron density,temperature, reddening, source(s) of ionization, and kinematics of theextraplanar gas. in all but one galaxy, photoionization by massive ob starsalone has difficulties explaining all of the line ratios in the extraplanargas. hybrid models that combine photoionization by ob stars and another sourceof ionization such as photoionization by turbulent mixing layers or shocksprovide a better fit to the data. the (upper limits on the) velocity gradientsmeasured in these galaxies are consistent with the predictions of the galacticfountain model to within the accuracy of the measurements.

astro-ph;0305026	extraplanar emission-line gas in edge-on spiral galaxies. i. deep  emission-line imaging	the extraplanar diffuse ionized gas (edig) in 17 nearby, edge-on diskgalaxies is studied using deep taurus tunable filter halpha and [n ii] lambda6583 images and conventional interference filter halpha + [n ii] lambda 6548,6583 images which reach flux levels generally below about 1 x 10^{-17} ergs^{-1} cm^{-2} arcsec^{-2}. [n ii] lambda 6583/halpha excitation maps areavailable for 10 of these objects. all but one galaxy in the sample exhibitedig. the contribution of the edig to the total halpha luminosity is relativelyconstant, of order 12 +/- 4%. the halpha scale height of the edig derived froma two-exponential fit to the vertical emission profile ranges from 0.4 kpc to17.9 kpc, with an average of 4.3 kpc. this average value is noticeably largerthan the edig scale height measured in our galaxy and other galaxies. thisdifference in scale height is probably due in part to the lower flux limits ofour observations. a quantitative analysis of the topology of the edig confirmsthat several galaxies in the sample have a highly structured edig morphology.the distribution of the edig emission is often correlated with the locations ofthe h ii regions in the disk. a strong correlation is found between the starformation rate (ir luminosity) per unit disk area and the extraplanar ionizedmass, providing further support for a strong connection between the disk andedig components in these galaxies. the excitation maps confirm that the [nii]/halpha ratios are systematically higher in the edig than in the disk. moredetail is given in paper ii.

astro-ph;0309298	the agn content of ultraluminous ir galaxies: high resolution vla  imaging of the iras 1jy ulirg sample	this paper presents the results of a high resolution radio imaging survey of83 of the 118 ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) in the iras 1 jy ulirgsample. we have observed these ulirgs at 15ghz with the very large array (vla).we find that ~75% of seyferts (both type 1 and 2) and liners have radio nucleiwhich are compact at our 150mas resolution. the detection rate of hii nuclei issignificantly lower (32%); the detections among these are preferentially hii +liner/seyfert composite nuclei. among ulirgs with multiple optical or near-irnuclei our observations detected only one (or no) nucleus; in these the radiodetection is typically towards the brightest near-ir nucleus. the compactnessof the radio sources, the higher detection rates in agn-type nuclei than hiinuclei, the preferential detection of nuclei with unresolved point sources inthe near-ir, the low soft x-ray to nuclear radio luminosity ratio (arguingagainst thermal emission powering the radio nuclei), and the lack ofcorrelation between radio power and halpha luminosity, all support an origin ofthe detected radio nuclei in agn related activity. this result is especiallyinteresting for liner ulirgs for which signatures of agns have often beenambiguous in other wavebands. such a high incidence of agn would provide, forthe first time, a large sample in which to study the interplay between agn,starbursts, and galaxy mergers.

astro-ph;0503707	extranuclear x-ray emission in the edge-on seyfert galaxy ngc 2992	we found several extranuclear (r &gt;~ 3") x-ray nebulae within 40" (6.3 kpc at32.5 mpc) of the nucleus of the seyfert galaxy ngc 2992. the net x-rayluminosity from the extranuclear sources is ~2-3 e39 erg/s (0.3-8.0 kev). thex-ray core itself (r &lt;~ 1") is positioned at 9:45:41.95 -14:19:34.8 (j2000) andhas a remarkably simple power-law spectrum with photon index gamma=1.86 andnh=7e21 /cm2. the near-nuclear (3" &lt;~ r &lt;~ 18") chandra spectrum is bestmodelled by three components: (1) a direct agn component with gamma fixed at1.86, (2) cold compton reflection of the agn component, and (3) a 0.5 kevlow-abundance (z &lt; 0.03 zsolar) "thermal plasma," with ~10% of the flux ofeither of the first two components. the x-ray luminosity of the 3rd component(the "soft excess") is ~1.4e40 erg/s, or ~5x that of all of the detectedextranuclear x-ray sources. we suggest that most (~75-80%) of the soft excessemission originates from 1" &lt; r &lt; 3", which is not imaged in our observationdue to severe ccd pile-up. we also require the cold reflector to be positionedat least 1" (158 pc) from the nucleus, since there is no reflection componentin the x-ray core spectrum. much of the extranuclear x-ray emission iscoincident with radio structures (nuclear radio bubbles and large-scale radiofeatures), and its soft x-ray luminosity is generally consistent withluminosities expected from a starburst-driven wind (with the starburst scaledfrom l_fir). however, the agn in ngc 2992 seems equally likely to power thegalactic wind in that object. furthermore, agn photoionization andphotoexcitation processes could dominate the soft excess, especially the\~75-80% which is not imaged by our observations.

astro-ph;0506611	outflows in infrared-luminous starbursts at z &lt; 0.5. ii. analysis and  discussion	we have performed an absorption-line survey of outflowing gas in 78starburst-dominated, infrared-luminous galaxies. this is the largest study ofsuperwinds at z &lt; 3. superwinds are found in almost all infrared-luminousgalaxies, and changes in detection rate with sfr--winds are found twice asoften in ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) as in less-luminousgalaxies--reflect different wind geometries. the maximum velocities we measureare 600 km/s, though most of the outflowing gas has lower velocities (100-200km/s). (one galaxy has velocities exceeding 1000 km/s.) velocities in linersare higher than in hii galaxies, and outflowing ionized gas often has highervelocities than the neutral gas. wind properties (velocity, mass, momentum, andenergy) scale with galaxy properties (sfr, luminosity, and galaxy mass),consistent with ram-pressure driving of the wind. wind properties increasestrongly with increasing galactic mass, contrary to expectation. thesecorrelations flatten at high sfr (&gt; 10-100 m_sun/yr), luminosities, and masses.this saturation is due to a lack of gas remaining in the wind's path, a commonneutral gas terminal velocity, and/or a decrease in the efficiency ofthermalization of the supernovae energy. it means that mass entrainmentefficiency, rather than remaining constant, declines in galaxies with sfr &gt; 10m_sun/yr and m_k &lt; -24. half of our sample consists of ulirgs, which host asmuch as half of the star formation in the universe at z &gt; 1. the powerful,ubiquitous winds we observe in these galaxies imply that superwinds in massivegalaxies at redshifts above unity play an important role in the evolution ofgalaxies and the intergalactic medium.

astro-ph;0507037	outflows in agn/starburst-composite ultraluminous infrared galaxies	galactic superwinds occur in almost all infrared-luminous galaxies with starformation rates (sfrs) above 10 m_sun/yr, as shown by studies of the nai dinterstellar absorption line. we demonstrate that this result also applies toultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) which host an active galactic nucleus(agn) embedded in a strong starburst (sfr &gt; 100 m_sun/yr) by studying a sampleof 26 seyfert ulirgs in nai d. the infrared luminosity of these galaxies ispowered jointly by the agn and starburst. we find that there are hints of theinfluence of the agn on outflows in seyfert 2/starburst composites, but theevidence is not yet statistically conclusive. the evidence we find is lowerwind detection rates (i.e., wind opening angles) in seyfert 2 ulirgs than ingalaxies of comparable l_ir, higher velocities than in galaxies of comparablesfr, and correlations between the neutral gas and the ionized gas in theextended narrow-line region. though the agn probably contributes to theoutflows in seyfert 2 ulirgs, its momentum and energy injection is equal to orless than that of the starburst. similarly, the outflow mechanical luminosity(energy outflow rate) per unit radiative luminosity is the same for starburstand seyfert 2 ulirgs. in the nuclei of seyfert 1s, we observe small-scaleoutflows that are powered solely by the agn. however, in mrk~231, we observeboth a high-velocity, small-scale and low-velocity, extended outflow. thelatter may be powered by a starburst or radio jet. these large-scale,lower-velocity outflows certainly exist in other seyfert 1 ulirgs, but they arewashed out by the light of the nucleus.

astro-ph;0509075	keck high-resolution spectroscopy of outflows in infrared luminous  galaxies	several recent studies have determined that large quantities of neutral gasare outflowing from the nuclei of almost all infrared-luminous galaxies. thesemeasurements show that winds in infrared-luminous galaxies play a significantrole in the evolution of galaxies and the intergalactic medium at redshifts z &gt;1, when infrared-luminous galaxies dominated the star formation rate of theuniverse. these conclusions rely on moderate resolution spectra (fwhm &gt; 65km/s) of the nai d absorption line and the assumption that there are nounresolved, saturated velocity components. for the first time, we present highresolution spectra (fwhm = 13 km/s) of massive, infrared-luminous galaxies. thefive galaxies in our sample are known to host outflows on the basis of previousobservations. with the present observations, all nai d velocity components areresolved with tau(nai d1 5896 a) &lt; 6. the column densities we measure areconsistent within the errors with those measured from moderate-resolutionobservations. this confirms that the mass, momentum, and energy of outflowinggas in infrared-luminous galaxies have been measured correctly by previousstudies.

astro-ph;0603028	local ultraluminous infrared galaxies and quasars	this paper reviews the recent results from a comprehensive investigation ofthe most luminous mergers in the local universe, the ultraluminous infraredgalaxies (ulirgs) and the quasars. first, the frequency of occurrence andimportance of black hole driven nuclear activity in ulirgs are discussed usingthe latest sets of optical, near-infrared, mid-infrared, and x-ray spectra onthese objects. obvious trends with luminosity, infrared color, and morphologyare pointed out. next, the host galaxy properties of ulirgs are described indetail and then compared with local quasar hosts and inactive spheroids. by andlarge, these data are consistent with the scenario where ulirgs areintermediate-mass elliptical galaxies in formation and in the process ofbecoming moderate-luminosity optical quasars. the powerful galactic windsdetected in many ulirgs may help shed any excess gas during thistransformation. however, this evolutionary scenario does not seem to apply toall ulirgs and quasars: ultraluminous infrared mergers do not always result ina quasar, and low-luminosity quasars near the boundary with seyferts do not allshow signs of a recent major merger.

0809.2090	suzaku observations of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies	we report the results from our analysis of {\it suzaku} xis (0.5-10 kev) andhxd/pin (15-40 kev) observations of five well-known local ulirgs: {\em iras}f05189-2524, {\em iras} f08572+3915, mrk 273, pks 1345+12, and arp 220. the xisobservations of f05189-2524 and mrk 273 reveal strong iron lines consistentwith fe k$\alpha$ and changes in spectral shapes with respect to previous {\itchandra} and {\it xmm-newton} observations. mrk 273 is also detected by thehxd/pin at $\sim$1.8-$\sigma$. for f05189-2524, modeling of the data from thedifferent epochs suggests that the change in spectral shape is likely due tothe central source switching off, leaving behind a residual reflectionspectrum, or an increase in the absorbing column. an increase in the coveringfraction of the absorber can describe the spectral variations seen in mrk 273,although a reduction in the intrinsic agn luminosity cannot be formally ruledout. the {\it suzaku} spectra of mrk 273 are well fit by a ~94% coveringfraction model with a column density of $\sim10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$. theabsorption-corrected log[$l_{\rm 2-10 kev}$ / $l_{\rm ir}$] ratio is consistentwith those found in pg quasars. the 0.5-10 kev spectrum of pks 1345+12 and arp220 seem unchanged from previous observations and their hard x-ray emission isnot convincingly detected by the hxd/pin. the large column density derived fromco observations and the large equivalent width of an ionized fe line in arp 220can be reconciled by an ionized reflection model. f08572+3915 is undetected inboth the xis and hxd/pin, but the analysis of unpublished {\em chandra} dataprovides a new measurement at low energies.

astro-ph;9711137	large-scale outflows in edge-on seyfert galaxies. iii. kiloparsec-scale  soft x-ray emission	we present rosat pspc and hri images of eight galaxies selected from adistance-limited sample of 22 edge-on seyfert galaxies. kiloparsec-scale softx-ray nebulae extend along the galaxy minor axes in three galaxies (ngc 2992,ngc 4388 and ngc 5506). the extended x-ray emission has 0.2-2.4 kev x-rayluminosities of $0.4-3.5 \times 10^{40} erg s^{-1}$. the x-ray nebulae areroughly co-spatial with the large-scale radio emission, suggesting that bothare produced by large-scale galactic outflows. assuming pressure balancebetween the radio and x-ray plasmas, the x-ray filling factor is $\gapprox10^4$ times larger than the radio plasma filling factor, suggesting thatlarge-scale outflows in seyfert galaxies are predominantly winds of thermalx-ray emitting gas. we favor an interpretation in which large-scale outflowsoriginate as agn-driven jets that entrain and heat gas on kpc scales as theymake their way out of the galaxy. agn- and starburst-driven winds are alsopossible explanations in cases where the winds are oriented along the rotationaxis of the galaxy disk.

0706.0818	spitzer quasar and ulirg evolution study (quest): ii. the spectral  energy distributions of palomar-green quasars	this is the second paper studying the qsos in the spitzer quest sample.previously we presented new pah measurements and argued that most of theobserved far infrared (fir) radiation is due to star-forming activity. here wepresent spectral energy distributions (seds) by supplementing our data withoptical, nir and fir observations. we define two sub-groups of ``weak fir'' and``strong fir'' qsos, and a third group of fir non-detections. assuming astarburst origin for the fir, we obtain ``intrinsic'' agn seds by subtracting astarburst template from the mean seds. the resulting seds are remarkablysimilar for all groups. they show three distinct peaks corresponding to twosilicate emission features and a 3mic bump that we interpret as the signatureof the hottest agn dust. they also display drops beyond 20mic that we interpretas the signature of the minimum temperature (about 200k) dust. this componentmust be optically thin to explain the silicate emission and the slope of thelong wavelength continuum. we discuss the merits of an alternative model wheremost of the fir emission is due to agn heating. such models are unlikely toexplain the properties of our qsos but they cannot be ruled out for moreluminous objects. we also find correlations between the luminosity at 5100a andtwo infrared starburst indicators: l(60mic) and l(pah 7.7mic). the correlationof l(5100a) with l(60mic) can be used to measure the relative growth rates andlifetimes of the black hole and the new stars.
