0901.1601	a complete 12co 2--1 map of m51 with hera: ii. total gas surface  densities and gravitational stability	to date the onset of large-scale star formation in galaxies and its link togravitational stability of the galactic disk have not been fully understood.the nearby face-on spiral galaxy m51 is an ideal target for studying thissubject. this paper combines co, dust, hi, and stellar maps of m51 and itscompanion galaxy to study the h2/hi transition, the gas-to-dust ratios, and thestability of the disk against gravitational collapse. we combine maps of themolecular gas using 12co 2--1 map hera/iram-30m data and hi vla data to studythe total gas surface density and the phase transition of atomic to moleculargas. the total gas surface density is compared to the dust surface density from850 micron scuba data. taking into account the velocity dispersions of themolecular and atomic gas, and the stellar surface densities derived from the2mass k-band survey, we derive the total toomre q parameter of the disk. thegas surface density in the spiral arms is approximately 2-3 higher compared tothat of the interarm regions. the ratio of molecular to atomic surface densityshows a nearly power-law dependence on the hydrostatic pressure p_hydro. thegas surface density distribution in m51 shows an underlying exponentialdistribution with a scale length of h_gas=7.6 kpc representing 55% of the totalgas mass, comparable to the properties of the exponential dust disk. incontrast to the velocity widths observed in hi, the co velocity dispersionshows enhanced line widths in the spiral arms compared to the interarm regions.the contribution of the stellar component in the toomre q-parameter analysis issignificant and lowers the combined q-parameter q_tot by up to 70% towards thethreshold for gravitational instability. the value of q_tot varies from 1.5-3in radial averages. a map of q_tot shows values around 1 on the spiral arms.

0901.2277	the molecular environment of the massive star forming region ngc 2024:  multi co transition analysis	ngc 2024, a sites of massive star formation, have complex internal structurescaused by cal heating by young stars, outflows, and stellar winds. thesecomplex cloud structures lead to intricate emission line shapes. the goal ofthis paper is to show that the complex line shapes of 12 co lines in ngc 2024can be explained consistently with a model, whose temperature and velocitystructure are based on the well-established scenario of a pdr and the blistermodel. we present velocity-resolved spectra of seven co lines ranging from j=3to j=13, and we combined these data with co high-frequency data from the isosatellite. we find that the bulk of the molecular cloud associated with ngc2024 consists of warm (75 k) and dense (9e5 cm-3) gas. an additional hot (~ 300k) component, located at the interface of the hii region and the molecularcloud, is needed to explain the emission of the high-j co lines. deepabsorption notches indicate that very cold material (20 k) exists in front ofthe warm material, too. a temperature and column density structure consistentwith those predicted by pdr models, combined with the velocity structure of ablister model, appropriately describes the observed emission line profiles ofthis massive star forming region. this case study of ngc 2024 shows that, withphysical insights into these complex regions and careful modeling, multi-lineobservations of co can be used to derive detailed physical conditions inmassive star forming regions.

0707.3312	scuba mapping of outer galaxy protostellar candidates	we aim to study dust properties of massive star forming regions in the outergalaxy, in a direction opposite to the galactic center. we present observationsof six outer galaxy point sources iras 01045+6505, 01420+6401, 05271+3059,05345+3556, 20222+3541 and 20406+4555, taken with the submillimeter common-userbolometer array (scuba) on the james clerk maxwell telescope (jcmt) at 450 and850 micron. single temperature greybody models are fitted to the spectralenergy distribution of the detected sub-mm cores to derive dust temperature,dust emissivity index and optical depth at 250 micron. the observed radialintensity profiles of the sub-mm cores were fitted with power laws to derivethe indices describing the density distribution. at a resolution of 15" all sixiras point sources show multiple emission peaks. only four out of fourteendetected sub-mm cores show associated mid-infrared emission. for the sub-mmcores we derive dust temperatures of 32+-5 k and dust emissivity indicesbetween 0.9 and 2.5. the density profiles of the sub-mm cores can be fitted bya single power law distribution with indices -1.5+-0.3, with most cores showingan index of -1.5. this is consistent with most observations of massive starforming regions and supports predictions of models of star formation whichconsider non-thermal support against gravitational collapse.

1001.2453	the link between molecular cloud structure and turbulence	we aim to better understand how the spatial structure of molecular clouds isgoverned by turbulence. for that, we study the large-scale spatial distributionof low density molecular gas and search for characteristic length scales. weemploy a 35 square degrees 13co 1-0 molecular line survey of cygnus x andvisual extinction (a_v) maps of 17 galactic clouds to analyse the spatialstructure using the delta-variance method. this sample contains a large varietyof different molecular cloud types with different star forming activity. thedelta-variance spectra obtained from the a_v maps show differences betweenlow-mass star-forming (sf) clouds and massive giant molecular clouds (gmc) interms of shape of the spectrum and its power-law exponent beta. low-mass sfclouds have a double-peak structure with characteristic size scales around 1 pc(though with a large scatter around this value) and 4 pc. gmcs show nocharacteristic scale in the a_v-maps, which can partly be ascribed to adistance effect due to a larger line-of-sight (los) confusion. thedelta-variance for cygnus, determined from the 13co survey, showscharacteristic scales at 4 pc and 40 pc, either reflecting the filamentstructure and large-scale turbulence forcing or - for the 4 pc scale - thescale below which the 13co 1-0 line becomes optically thick. though there aredifferent processes that can introduce characteristic scales, i.e. geometry,decaying turbulence the transition scale from supersonic to subsonic turbulence(the sonic scale), line-of-sight effects and energy injection due to expandingsupernova shells, outflows, hii-regions, and the relative contribution of theseeffects strongly varies from cloud to cloud, it is remarkable that theresulting turbulent structure of molecular clouds shows similarcharacteristics.

1005.1671	strong absorption by interstellar hydrogen fluoride: herschel/hifi  observations of the sight-line to g10.6-0.4 (w31c)	we report the detection of strong absorption by interstellar hydrogenfluoride along the sight-line to the submillimeter continuum source g10.6-0.4(w31c). we have used herschel's hifi instrument, in dual beam switch mode, toobserve the 1232.4763 ghz j=1-0 hf transition in the upper sideband of the band5a receiver. the resultant spectrum shows weak hf emission from g10.6-0.4 atlsr velocities in the range -10 to -3 km/s, accompanied by strong absorption byforeground material at lsr velocities in the range 15 to 50 km/s. the spectrumis similar to that of the 1113.3430 ghz 1(11)-0(00) transition of para-water,although at some frequencies the hf (hydrogen fluoride) optical depth clearlyexceeds that of para-h2o. the optically-thick hf absorption that we haveobserved places a conservative lower limit of 1.6e+14 cm-2 on the hf columndensity along the sight-line to g10.6-0.4. our lower limit on the hf abundance,6e-9 relative to hydrogen nuclei, implies that hydrogen fluoride accounts forbetween ~ 30 and 100% of the fluorine nuclei in the gas phase along thissight-line. this observation corroborates theoretical predictions that -because the unique thermochemistry of fluorine permits the exothermic reactionof f atoms with molecular hydrogen - hf will be the dominant reservoir ofinterstellar fluorine under a wide range of conditions.

1005.2517	hifi observations of warm gas in dr21: shock versus radiative heating	the molecular gas in the dr21 massive star formation region is known to beaffected by the strong uv field from the central star cluster and by a fastoutflow creating a bright shock. the relative contribution of both heatingmechanisms is the matter of a long debate. by better sampling the excitationladder of various tracers we provide a quantitative distinction between thedifferent heating mechanisms. hifi observations of mid-j transitions of co andhco+ isotopes allow us to bridge the gap in excitation energies betweenobservations from the ground, characterizing the cooler gas, and existing isolws spectra, constraining the properties of the hot gas. comparing the detailedline profiles allows to identify the physical structure of the differentcomponents. in spite of the known shock-excitation of h2 and the clearlyvisible strong outflow, we find that the emission of all lines up to &gt; 2 thzcan be explained by purely radiative heating of the material. however, the newherschel/hifi observations reveal two types of excitation conditions. we findhot and dense clumps close to the central cluster, probably dynamicallyaffected by the outflow, and a more widespread distribution of cooler, butnevertheless dense, molecular clumps.

1005.2521	detection of interstellar oxidaniumyl: abundant h2o+ towards the  star-forming regions dr21, sgr b2, and ngc6334	we identify a prominent absorption feature at 1115 ghz, detected in firsthifi spectra towards high-mass star-forming regions, and interpret itsastrophysical origin. the characteristic hyperfine pattern of the h2o+ground-state rotational transition, and the lack of other known low-energytransitions in this frequency range, identifies the feature as h2o+ absorptionagainst the dust continuum background and allows us to derive the velocityprofile of the absorbing gas. by comparing this velocity profile with velocityprofiles of other tracers in the dr21 star-forming region, we constrain thefrequency of the transition and the conditions for its formation. in dr21, thevelocity distribution of h2o+ matches that of the [cii] line at 158\mu\m and ofoh cm-wave absorption, both stemming from the hot and dense clump surfacesfacing the hii-region and dynamically affected by the blister outflow. diffuseforeground gas dominates the absorption towards sgr b2. the integratedintensity of the absorption line allows us to derive lower limits to the h2o+column density of 7.2e12 cm^-2 in ngc 6334, 2.3e13 cm^-2 in dr21, and 1.1e15cm^-2 in sgr b2.

1007.1523	herschel observations in the ultracompact hii region mon r2: water in  dense photon-dominated regions (pdrs)	mon r2, at a distance of 830 pc, is the only ultracompact hii region (uc hii)where the photon-dominated region (pdr) between the ionized gas and themolecular cloud can be resolved with herschel. hifi observations of theabundant compounds 13co, c18o, o-h2-18o, hco+, cs, ch, and nh have been used toderive the physical and chemical conditions in the pdr, in particular the waterabundance. the 13co, c18o, o-h2-18o, hco+ and cs observations are welldescribed assuming that the emission is coming from a dense (n=5e6 cm-3,n(h2)&gt;1e22 cm-2) layer of molecular gas around the uc hii. based on ouro-h2-18o observations, we estimate an o-h2o abundance of ~2e-8. this is theaverage ortho-water abundance in the pdr. additional h2-18o and/or water linesare required to derive the water abundance profile. a lower density envelope(n~1e5 cm-3, n(h2)=2-5e22 cm-2) is responsible for the absorption in the nh1_1-0_2 line. the emission of the ch ground state triplet is coming from bothregions with a complex and self-absorbed profile in the main component. theradiative transfer modeling shows that the 13co and hco+ line profiles areconsistent with an expansion of the molecular gas with a velocity law, v_e =0.5x (r/rout)^{-1} km/s, although the expansion velocity is poorly constrained bythe observations presented here.

1007.4226	the distribution of water in the high-mass star-forming region ngc 6334i	we present observations of twelve rotational transitions of h2o-16, h2o-18,and h2o-17 toward the massive star-forming region ngc 6334 i, carried out withherschel/hifi as part of the guaranteed time key program chemical herschelsurveys of star forming regions (chess). we analyze these observations toobtain insights into physical processes in this region.  we identify three main gas components (hot core, cold foreground, andoutflow) in ngc 6334 i and derive the physical conditions in these components.  the hot core, identified by the emission in highly excited lines, shows ahigh excitation temperature of 200 k, whereas water in the foreground componentis predominantly in the ortho- and para- ground states. the abundance of watervaries between 4 10^-5 (outflow) and 10^-8 (cold foreground gas). thisvariation is most likely due to the freeze-out of water molecules onto dustgrains. the h2o-18/h2o-17 abundance ratio is 3.2, which is consistent with theo-18/o-17 ratio determined from co isotopologues. the ortho/para ratio in waterappears to be relatively low 1.6(1) in the cold, quiescent gas, but close tothe equilibrium value of three in the warmer outflow material (2.5(0.8)).

1007.4370	variations in h2o+/h2o ratios toward massive star-forming regions	early results from the herschel space observatory revealed the water cationh2o+ to be an abundant ingredient of the interstellar medium. here we presentnew observations of the h2o and h2o+ lines at 1113.3 and 1115.2 ghz using theherschel space observatory toward a sample of high-mass star-forming regions toobservationally study the relation between h2o and h2o+ . nine out of tensources show absorption from h2o+ in a range of environments: the molecularclumps surrounding the forming and newly formed massive stars, brighthigh-velocity outflows associated with the massive protostars, and unrelatedlow-density clouds along the line of sight. column densities per velocitycomponent of h2 o+ are found in the range of 10^12 to a few 10^13 cm-2 . thehighest n(h2o+) column densities are found in the outflows of the sources. theratios of h2o+/h2o are determined in a range from 0.01 to a few and are foundto differ strongly between the observed environments with much lower ratios inthe massive (proto)cluster envelopes (0.01-0.1) than in outflows and diffuseclouds. remarkably, even for source components detected in h2o in emission,h2o+ is still seen in absorption.

1007.4957	the origin of the [c ii] emission in the s140 pdrs - new insights from  hifi	using herschel's hifi instrument we have observed [c ii] along a cut throughs140 and high-j transitions of co and hco+ at two positions on the cut,corresponding to the externally irradiated ionization front and the embeddedmassive star forming core irs1. the hifi data were combined with availableground-based observations and modeled using the kosma-tau model for photondominated regions. here we derive the physical conditions in s140 and inparticular the origin of [c ii] emission around irs1. we identify threedistinct regions of [c ii] emission from the cut, one close to the embeddedsource irs1, one associated with the ionization front and one further into thecloud. the line emission can be understood in terms of a clumpy model ofphoton-dominated regions. at the position of irs1, we identify at least twodistinct components contributing to the [c ii] emission, one of them a small,hot component, which can possibly be identified with the irradiated outflowwalls. this is consistent with the fact that the [c ii] peak at irs1 coincideswith shocked h2 emission at the edges of the outflow cavity. we note thatpreviously available observations of irs1 can be well reproduced by asingle-component kosma-tau model. thus it is hifi's unprecedented spatial andspectral resolution, as well as its sensitivity which has allowed us to uncoveran additional hot gas component in the s140 region.

1007.5131	reversal of infall in sgrb2(m) revealed by herschel/hifi observations of  hcn lines at thz frequencies	to investigate the accretion and feedback processes in massive starformation, we analyze the shapes of emission lines from hot molecular cores,whose asymmetries trace infall and expansion motions. the high-mass starforming region sgrb2(m) was observed with herschel/hifi (hexos key project) invarious lines of hcn and its isotopologues, complemented by apex data. theobservations are compared to spherically symmetric, centrally heated modelswith density power-law gradient and different velocity fields (infall orinfall+expansion), using the radiative transfer code ratran. the hcn lineprofiles are asymmetric, with the emission peak shifting from blue to red withincreasing j and decreasing line opacity (hcn to h$^{13}$cn). this is mostevident in the hcn 12--11 line at 1062 ghz. these line shapes are reproduced bya model whose velocity field changes from infall in the outer part to expansionin the inner part. the qualitative reproduction of the hcn lines suggests thatinfall dominates in the colder, outer regions, but expansion dominates in thewarmer, inner regions. we are thus witnessing the onset of feedback in massivestar formation, starting to reverse the infall and finally disrupting the wholemolecular cloud. to obtain our result, the thz lines uniquely covered by hifiwere critically important.

1007.5470	herschel observations of extra-ordinary sources (hexos): observations of  h2o and its isotopologues towards orion kl	we report the detection of more than 48 velocity-resolved ground rotationalstate transitions of h2(16)o, h2(18)o, and h2(17)o - most for the first time -in both emission and absorption toward orion kl using herschel/hifi. we showthat a simple fit, constrained to match the known emission and absorptioncomponents along the line of sight, is in excellent agreement with the spectralprofiles of all the water lines. using the measured h2(18)o line fluxes, whichare less affected by line opacity than their h2(16)o counterparts, and anescape probability method, the column densities of h2(18)o associated with eachemission component are derived. we infer total water abundances of 7.4e-5,1.0e-5, and 1.6e-5 for the plateau, hot core, and extended warm gas,respectively. in the case of the plateau, this value is consistent withprevious measures of the orion-kl water abundance as well as those of othermolecular outflows. in the case of the hot core and extended warm gas, thesevalues are somewhat higher than water abundances derived for other quiescentclouds, suggesting that these regions are likely experiencing enhancedwater-ice sublimation from (and reduced freeze-out onto) grain surfaces due tothe warmer dust in these sources.

1008.1315	gas morphology and energetics at the surface of pdrs: new insights with  herschel observations of ngc 7023	we investigate the physics and chemistry of the gas and dust in densephoton-dominated regions (pdrs), along with their dependence on theilluminating uv field. using herschel-hifi observations, we study the gasenergetics in ngc 7023 in relation to the morphology of this nebula. ngc 7023is the prototype of a pdr illuminated by a b2v star and is one of the keytargets of herschel. our approach consists in determining the energetics of theregion by combining the information carried by the mid-ir spectrum (extinctionby classical grains, emission from very small dust particles) with that of themain gas coolant lines. in this letter, we discuss more specifically theintensity and line profile of the 158 micron (1901 ghz) [cii] line measured byhifi and provide information on the emitting gas. we show that both the [cii]emission and the mid-ir emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs)arise from the regions located in the transition zone between atomic andmolecular gas. using the meudon pdr code and a simple transfer model, we findgood agreement between the calculated and observed [cii] intensities. hifiobservations of ngc 7023 provide the opportunity to constrain the energetics atthe surface of pdrs. future work will include analysis of the main coolant line[oi] and use of a new pdr model that includes pah-related species.

1101.0805	herschel observations of extra-ordinary sources: methanol as a probe of  physical conditions in orion kl	we have examined methanol emission from orion kl with of the {\emherschel}/hifi instrument, and detected two methanol bands centered at 524 ghzand 1061 ghz. the 524 ghz methanol band (observed in hifi band 1a) is dominatedby the isolated $\delta$j$=$0, k$=-4\rightarrow$-3, v$_t$$=$0 q branch, andincludes 25 e-type and 2 a-type transitions. the 1061 ghz methanol band(observed in hifi band 4b) is dominated by the $\delta$j$=$0,k$=7\rightarrow$6, v$_t$$=$0 q branch transitions which are mostly blended. wehave used the isolated e-type v$_t$$=$0 methanol transitions to explore thephysical conditions in the molecular gas. with hifi's high velocity resolution,the methanol emission contributed by different spatial components along theline of sight toward orion kl (hot core, low velocity flow, and compact ridge)can be distinguished and studied separately. the isolated transitions detectedin these bands cover a broad energy range (upper state energy ranging from 80 kto 900 k), which provides a unique probe of the thermal structure in eachspatial component. the observations further show that the compact ridge isexternally heated. these observations demonstrate the power of methanol linesas probes of the physical conditions in warm regions in close proximity toyoung stars.

1304.3131	the effects of radiative transfer on the pdfs of molecular mhd  turbulence	we study the effects of radiative transfer on the probability distributionfunctions (pdfs) of simulations of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in the widelystudied $^{13}$co 2-1 transition. we find that the integrated intensity mapsgenerally follow a log-normal distribution, with the cases that have $\tau\approx 1$ best matching the pdf of the column density. we fit a 2dvariance-sonic mach number relationship to our logarithmic pdfs of the form$\sigma_{ln(\sigma/\sigma_0)}^2=a\times ln(1+b^2{\cal m}_s^2)$ and find that,for parameter $b=1/3$, parameter $a$ depends on the radiative transferenvironment. we also explore the variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the linearpdfs finding that higher moments reflect both higher sonic mach number andlower optical depth. finally, we apply the tsallis incremental pdf function andfind that the fit parameters depend on both mach numbers, but also aresensitive to the radiative transfer parameter space, with the $\tau \approx 1$case best fitting the incremental pdf of the true column density. we concludethat, for pdfs of low optical depth cases, part of the gas is alwayssub-thermally excited so that the spread of the line intensities exceeds thespread of the underlying column densities and hence the pdfs do not reflect thetrue column density. similarly, pdfs of optically thick cases are dominated bythe velocity dispersion and therefore do not represent the true column densitypdf. thus, in the case of molecules like carbon monoxide, the dynamic range ofintensities, structures observed and consequently, the observable pdfs, areless determined by turbulence and more-often determined by radiative transfereffects.

1305.3619	the turbulence power spectrum in optically thick interstellar clouds	the fourier power spectrum is one of the most widely used statistical toolsto analyze the nature of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in the interstellarmedium. lazarian &amp; pogosyan (2004) predicted that the spectral slope shouldsaturate to -3 for an optically thick medium and many observations exist insupport of their prediction. however, there have not been any numerical studiesto-date testing these results. we analyze the spatial power spectrum of mhdsimulations with a wide range of sonic and alfv\'enic mach numbers, whichinclude radiative transfer effects of the $^{13}$co transition. we confirmnumerically the predictions of lazarian &amp; pogosyan (2004) that the spectralslope of line intensity maps of an optically thick medium saturates to -3.furthermore, for very optically thin supersonic co gas, where the density or coabundance values are too low to excite emission in all but the densest shockcompressed gas, we find that the spectral slope is shallower than expected fromthe column density. finally, we find that mixed optically thin/thick co gas,which has average optical depths on order of unity, shows mixed behavior: forsuper-alfv\'enic turbulence, the integrated intensity power spectral slopesgenerally follow the same trend with sonic mach number as the true columndensity power spectrum slopes. however, for sub-alfv\'enic turbulence thespectral slopes are steeper with values near -3 which are similar to the veryoptically thick regime.

1404.0121	detection of a dense clump in a filament interacting with w51e2	in the framework of the herschel/prismas guaranteed time key program, theline of sight to the distant ultracompact hii region w51e2 has been observedusing several selected molecular species. most of the detected absorptionfeatures are not associated with the background high-mass star-forming regionand probe the diffuse matter along the line of sight. we present here thedetection of an additional narrow absorption feature at ~70 km/s in theobserved spectra of hdo, nh3 and c3. the 70 km/s feature is not uniquelyidentifiable with the dynamic components (the main cloud and the large-scaleforeground filament) so-far identified toward this region. the narrowabsorption feature is similar to the one found toward low-mass protostars,which is characteristic of the presence of a cold external envelope. thefar-infrared spectroscopic data were combined with existing ground-basedobservations of 12co, 13co, cch, cn, and c3h2 to characterize the 70 km/scomponent. using a non-lte analysis of multiple transitions of nh3 and cn, weestimated the density (n(h2) (1-5)x10^5 cm^-3) and temperature (10-30 k) forthis narrow feature. we used a gas-grain warm-up based chemical model withphysical parameters derived from the nh3 data to explain the observedabundances of the different chemical species. we propose that the 70 km/snarrow feature arises in a dense and cold clump that probably is undergoingcollapse to form a low-mass protostar, formed on the trailing side of thehigh-velocity filament, which is thought to be interacting with the w51 maincloud. while the fortuitous coincidence of the dense clump along the line ofsight with the continuum-bright w51e2 compact hii region has contributed to itsnon-detection in the continuum images, this same attribute makes it anappropriate source for absorption studies and in particular for ice studies ofstar-forming regions.

0804.4649	structure analysis of interstellar clouds: i. improving the  delta-variance method	the delta-variance analysis, has proven to be an efficient and accuratemethod of characterising the power spectrum of interstellar turbulence. theimplementation presently in use, however, has several shortcomings.  we propose and test an improved delta-variance algorithm for two-dimensionaldata sets, which is applicable to maps with variable error bars and which canbe quickly computed in fourier space. we calibrate the spatial resolution ofthe delta-variance spectra.  the new delta-variance algorithm is based on an appropriate filtering of thedata in fourier space. it allows us to distinguish the influence of variablenoise from the actual small-scale structure in the maps and it helps fordealing with the boundary problem in non-periodic and/or irregularly boundedmaps. we try several wavelets and test their spatial sensitivity usingartificial maps with well known structure sizes.  it turns out that different wavelets show different strengths with respect todetecting characteristic structures and spectral indices, i.e. differentaspects of map structures. as a reasonable universal compromise for the optimumdelta-variance filter, we propose the mexican-hat filter with a ratio betweenthe diameters of the core and the annulus of 1.5.

1508.03801	velocity-resolved [cii] emission and [cii]/fir mapping along orion with  herschel	we present the first 7.5'x11.5' velocity-resolved map of the [cii]158um linetoward the orion molecular cloud-1 (omc-1) taken with the herschel/hifiinstrument. in combination with far-infrared (fir) photometric images andvelocity-resolved maps of the h41alpha hydrogen recombination and co j=2-1lines, this data set provides an unprecedented view of the intricatesmall-scale kinematics of the ionized/pdr/molecular gas interfaces and of theradiative feedback from massive stars. the main contribution to the [cii]luminosity (~85%) is from the extended, fuv-illuminated face of the cloudg_0&gt;500, n_h&gt;5x10^3 cm^-3) and from dense pdrs (g_0~10^4, n_h~10^5 cm^-3) atthe interface between omc-1 and the hii region surrounding the trapeziumcluster. around 15% of the [cii] emission arises from a different gas componentwithout co counterpart. the [cii] excitation, pdr gas turbulence, line opacity(from [13cii]) and role of the geometry of the illuminating stars with respectto the cloud are investigated. we construct maps of the [cii]/fir and fir/m_gasratios and show that [cii]/fir decreases from the extended cloud component(10^-2-10^-3) to the more opaque star-forming cores (10^-3-10^-4). the lowestvalues are reminiscent of the "[cii] deficit" seen in local ultra-luminous irgalaxies hosting vigorous star formation. spatial correlation analysis showsthat the decreasing [cii]/fir ratio correlates better with the column densityof dust through the molecular cloud than with fir/m_gas. we conclude that the[cii] emitting column relative to the total dust column along each line ofsight is responsible for the observed [cii]/fir variations through the cloud.

1508.06699	disentangling the excitation conditions of the dense gas in m17 sw	we probe the chemical and energetic conditions in dense gas created byradiative feedback through observations of multiple co, hcn and hco$^+$transitions toward the dense core of m17 sw. we used the dual band receivergreat on board the sofia airborne telescope to obtain maps of the $j=16-15$,$j=12-11$, and $j=11-10$ transitions of $^{12}$co. we compare these maps withcorresponding apex and iram 30m telescope data for low- and mid-$j$ co, hcn andhco$^+$ emission lines, including maps of the hcn $j=8-7$ and hco$^+$ $j=9-8$transitions. the excitation conditions of $^{12}$co, hco$^+$ and hcn areestimated with a two-phase non-lte radiative transfer model of the linespectral energy distributions (lseds) at four selected positions. the energybalance at these positions is also studied. we obtained extensive lseds for theco, hcn and hco$^+$ molecules toward m17 sw. the lsed shape, particularly thehigh-$j$ tail of the co lines observed with sofia/great, is distinctive for theunderlying excitation conditions. the critical magnetic field criterion impliesthat the cold cloudlets at two positions are partially controlled by processesthat create and dissipate internal motions. supersonic but sub-alfv\'enicvelocities in the cold component at most selected positions indicates thatinternal motions are likely mhd waves. magnetic pressure dominates thermalpressure in both gas components at all selected positions, assuming randomorientation of the magnetic field. the magnetic pressure of a constant magneticfield throughout all the gas phases can support the total internal pressure ofthe cold components, but it cannot support the internal pressure of the warmcomponents. if the magnetic field scales as $b \propto n^{2/3}$, then theevolution of the cold cloudlets at two selected positions, and the warmcloudlets at all selected positions, will be determined by ambipolar diffusion.

0807.1988	a clumpy-cloud pdr model of the global far-infrared line emission of the  milky way	the fractal structure of the interstellar medium suggests that theinteraction of uv radiation with the ism as described in the context ofphoton-dominated regions (pdr) dominates most of the physical and chemicalconditions, and hence the far-infrared and submm emission from the ism in themilky way. we investigate to what extent the galactic fir line emission of theimportant species co, c, c+, and o, as observed by the cosmic backgroundexplorer (cobe) satellite can be modeled in the framework of a clumpy,uv-penetrated cloud scenario. the far-infrared line emission of the milky wayis modeled as the emission from an ensemble of clumps with a power law clumpmass spectrum and mass-size relation with power-law indices consistent with theobserved ism structure. the individual clump line intensities are calculatedusing the kosma-tau pdr-model for spherical clumps. the model parameters forthe cylindrically symmetric galactic distribution of the mass density andvolume filling factor are determined by the observed radial distributions. aconstant fuv intensity, in which the clumps are embedded, is assumed. we showthat this scenario can explain, without any further assumptions and within afactor of about 2, the absolute fir-line intensities and their distributionwith galactic longitude as observed by cobe.

astro-ph;0602265	interstellar cloud structure: the statistics of centroid velocities	the investigation of the statistical properties of maps of line centroids hasbeen used for almost 50 years, but there is still no general agreement on theirinterpretation. we try to quantify which properties of underlying turbulentvelocity fields can be derived from centroid velocity maps, and we testconditions under which the scaling behaviour of the centroid velocities matchesthe scaling of the three-dimensional velocity field. using fractal cloud modelswe study systematically the relation between three-dimensional density andvelocity fields and the statistical properties of the produced line centroidmaps. we put special attention to cases with large density fluctuationsresembling supersonic interstellar turbulence. starting from the delta-varianceanalysis we derive a new tool to compute the scaling behaviour of thethree-dimensional velocity field from observed intensity and centroid velocitymaps. we provide two criteria to decide whether the information from thecentroid velocities directly reflects the properties of the underlying velocityfield. applying these criteria allows to understand the different results foundso far in the literature on the interpretation of the statistics of velocitycentroids. a new iteration scheme can be used to derive the three-dimensionalvelocity scaling from centroid velocity maps for arbitrary density and velocityfields, but it requires an accurate knowledge of the average density of theconsidered interstellar cloud.

astro-ph;0606560	first observations with condor, a 1.5 thz heterodyne receiver	the thz atmospheric windows centered at roughly 1.3 and 1.5~thz, containnumerous spectral lines of astronomical importance, including three high-j colines, the n+ line at 205 microns, and the ground transition of para-h2d+. theco lines are tracers of hot (several 100k), dense gas; n+ is a cooling line ofdiffuse, ionized gas; the h2d+ line is a non-depleting tracer of cold (~20k),dense gas. as the thz lines benefit the study of diverse phenomena (fromhigh-mass star-forming regions to the wim to cold prestellar cores), we havebuilt the co n+ deuterium observations receiver (condor) to further explore thethz windows by ground-based observations. condor was designed to be used at theatacama pathfinder experiment (apex) and stratospheric observatory for infraredastronomy (sofia). condor was installed at the apex telescope and testobservations were made to characterize the instrument. the combination ofcondor on apex successfully detected thz radiation from astronomical sources.condor operated with typical trec=1600k and spectral allan variance times of30s. condor's first light observations of co 13-12 emission from the hot coreorion fir4 (= omc1 south) revealed a narrow line with t(mb) = 210k anddelta(v)=5.4km/s. a search for n+ emission from the ionization front of theorion bar resulted in a non-detection. the successful deployment of condor atapex demonstrates the potential for making observations at thz frequencies fromground-based facilities.

astro-ph;0609559	the cooling of atomic and molecular gas in dr21	we present an overview of a high-mass star formation region through the major(sub-)mm, and far-infrared cooling lines to gain insight into the physicalconditions and the energy budget of the molecular cloud. we used the kosma 3mtelescope to map the core ($10'\times 14'$) of the galactic star forming regiondr 21/dr 21 (oh) in the cygnus x region in the two fine structure lines ofatomic carbon ci and four mid-$j$ transitions of co and $^{13}$co, and cs$j=7\to6$. these observations have been combined with fcrao $j=1\to0$observations of $^{13}$co and c$^{18}$o. five positions, including dr21, dr21(oh), and dr21 fir1, were observed with the iso/lws grating spectrometer in the\oi 63 and 145 $\mu$m lines, the \cii 158 $\mu$m line, and four high-$j$ colines. we discuss the intensities and line ratios at these positions and applylocal thermal equilibrium (lte) and non-lte analysis methods in order to derivephysical parameters such as masses, densities and temperatures. the co lineemission has been modeled up to j=20. from non-lte modeling of the low- tohigh-$j$ co lines we identify two gas components, a cold one at temperatures oft$_\rm{kin}\sim 30-40$ k, and one with t$_\rm{kin}\sim 80-150$ k at a localclump density of about n(h$_2$)$\sim 10^4-10^6$ cm$^{-3}$. while the coldquiescent component is massive containing typically more than 94 % of the mass,the warm, dense, and turbulent gas is dominated by mid- and high-$j$ co lineemission and its large line widths. the medium must be clumpy with avolume-filling of a few percent. the co lines are found to be important for thecooling of the cold molecular gas, e.g. at dr21 (oh). near the outflow of theuv-heated source dr21, the gas cooling is dominated by line emission of atomicoxygen and of co.

astro-ph;0702231	a pdr-code comparison study	we present a comparison between independent computer codes, modeling thephysics and chemistry of interstellar photon dominated regions (pdrs). our goalwas to understand the mutual differences in the pdr codes and their effects onthe physical and chemical structure of the model clouds, and to converge theoutput of different codes to a common solution. a number of benchmark modelshave been created, covering low and high gas densities and far ultravioletintensities. the benchmark models were computed in two ways: one set assumingconstant temperatures, thus testing the consistency of the chemical network andphoto-processes, and a second set determining the temperature selfconsistently.we investigated the impact of pdr geometry and agreed on the comparison ofresults from spherical and plane-parallel pdr models. we identified a number ofkey processes governing the chemical network which have been treateddifferently in the various codes, and defined a proper common treatment. weestablished a comprehensive set of reference models for ongoing and future pdrmodel bench-marking and were able to increase the agreement in modelpredictions for all benchmark models significantly.
