0902.4717	how do galaxies accrete gas and form stars?	great strides have been made in the last two decades in determining howgalaxies evolve from their initial dark matter seeds to the complex structureswe observe at z=0. the role of mergers has been documented through bothobservations and simulations, numerous satellites that may represent theseinitial dark matter seeds have been discovered in the local group, highredshift galaxies have been revealed with monstrous star formation rates, andthe gaseous cosmic web has been mapped through absorption line experiments.despite these efforts, the dark matter simulations that include baryons arestill unable to accurately reproduce galaxies. one of the major problems is ourincomplete understanding of how a galaxy accretes its baryons and subsequentlyforms stars. galaxy formation simulations have been unable to accuratelyrepresent the required gas physics on cosmological timescales, and observationshave only just begun to detect the star formation fuel over a range ofredshifts and environments. how galaxies obtain gas and subsequently form starsis a major unsolved, yet tractable problem in contemporary extragalacticastrophysics. in this paper we outline how progress can be made in this area inthe next decade.

0707.0395	warm molecular hydrogen in the spitzer sings galaxy sample	(simplified) results on the properties of warm h2 in 57 normal galaxies arederived from h2 rotational transitions, obtained as part of sings. this studyextends previous extragalactic surveys of h2, the most abundant constituent ofthe molecular ism, to more common systems (l_fir = e7 to 6e10 l_sun) of allmorphological and nuclear types. the s(1) transition is securely detected inthe nuclear regions of 86% of sings galaxies with stellar masses above 10^9.5m_sun. the derived column densities of warm h2 (t &gt; ~100 k), even thoughaveraged over kiloparsec-scale areas, are commensurate with those of resolvedpdrs; the median of the sample is 3e20 cm-2. they amount to between 1% and &gt;30%of the total h2. the power emitted in the sum of the s(0) to s(2) transitionsis on average 30% of the [siii] line power, and ~4e-4 of the total infraredpower (tir) within the same area for star-forming galaxies, which is consistentwith excitation in pdrs. the fact that h2 emission scales tightly with pahemission, even though the average radiation field intensity varies by a factorten, can also be understood if both tracers originate predominantly in pdrs,either dense or diffuse. a large fraction of the 25 liner/sy targets, however,strongly depart from the rest of the sample, in having warmer h2 in the excitedstates, and an excess of h2 emission with respect to pahs, tir and [siii]. wepropose a threshold in h2 to pah power ratios, allowing the identification oflow-luminosity agns by an excess h2 excitation. a dominant contribution fromshock heating is favored in these objects. finally, we detect, in nearly halfthe star-forming targets, non-equilibrium ortho to para ratios, consistent withfuv pumping combined with incomplete ortho-para thermalization by collisions,or possibly non-equilibrium pdr fronts advancing into cold gas.

0907.4722	the spitzer local volume legacy: survey description and infrared  photometry	the survey description and the near-, mid-, and far-infrared flux propertiesare presented for the 258 galaxies in the local volume legacy (lvl). lvl is aspitzer space telescope legacy program that surveys the local universe out to11 mpc, built upon a foundation of ultraviolet, h-alpha, and hst imaging from11hugs (11 mpc h-alpha and ultraviolet galaxy survey) and angst (acs nearbygalaxy survey treasury). lvl covers an unbiased, representative, andstatistically robust sample of nearby star-forming galaxies, exploiting thehighest extragalactic spatial resolution achievable with spitzer. as a resultof its approximately volume-limited nature, lvl augments previous spitzerobservations of present-day galaxies with improved sampling of thelow-luminosity galaxy population. the collection of lvl galaxies shows a largespread in mid-infrared colors, likely due to the conspicuous deficiency of 8umpah emission from low-metallicity, low-luminosity galaxies. conversely, thefar-infrared emission tightly tracks the total infrared emission, with adispersion in their flux ratio of only 0.1 dex. in terms of the relationbetween infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio and ultraviolet spectral slope, the lvlsample shows redder colors and/or lower infrared-to-ultraviolet ratios thanstarburst galaxies, suggesting that reprocessing by dust is less important inthe lower mass systems that dominate the lvl sample. comparisons withtheoretical models suggest that the amplitude of deviations from the relationfound for starburst galaxies correlates with the age of the stellar populationsthat dominate the ultraviolet/optical luminosities.

0707.1303	variations in 24 micron morphologies among galaxies in the spitzer  infrared nearby galaxies survey: new insights into the hubble sequence	to study the distribution of star formation and dust emission within nearbygalaxies, we measured five morphological parameters in the 3.6 and 24 micronwave bands for 65 galaxies in the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey(sings) and 8 galaxies that were serendipitously observed by sings. themorphological parameters demonstrate strong variations along the hubblesequence, including statistically significant differences between s0/a-sab andsc-sd galaxies. early-type galaxies are generally found to be compact,centralized, symmetric sources in the 24 micron band, while late-type galaxiesare generally found to be extended, asymmetric sources. these results suggestthat the processes that increase the real or apparent sizes of galaxies' bulgesalso lead to more centralized 24 micron dust emission. several phenomena, suchas strong nuclear star formation, seyfert activity, or outer ring structures,may cause galaxies to deviate from the general morphological trends observed at24 microns. we also note that the 24 micron morphologies of sdm-im galaxies arequite varied, with some objects appearing very compact and symmetric whileothers appear diffuse and asymmetric. these variations reflect the widevariation in star formation in irregular galaxies as observed at otherwavelengths. the variations in the 24 micron morphological parameters acrossthe hubble sequence mirror many of the morphological trends seen in othertracers of the ism and in stellar emission. however, the 24 micronmorphological parameters for the galaxies in this sample do not match themorphological parameters measured in the stellar wave bands. this implies thatthe distribution of dust emission is related to but not equivalent to thedistribution of stellar emission.

0909.2648	radial distribution of stars, gas and dust in sings galaxies. i. surface  photometry and morphology	we present ultraviolet through far-infrared surface brightness profiles forthe 75 galaxies in the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings). theimagery used to measure the profiles includes galex uv data, optical imagesfrom kpno, ctio and sdss, near-ir data from 2mass, and mid- and far-infraredimages from spitzer. along with the radial profiles, we also providemulti-wavelength asymptotic magnitudes and several non-parametric indicators ofgalaxy morphology: the concentration index (c_42), the asymmetry (a), the ginicoefficient (g) and the normalized second-order moment of the brightest 20% ofthe galaxy's flux (m_20). our radial profiles show a wide range of morphologiesand multiple components (bulges, exponential disks, inner and outer disktruncations, etc.) that vary not only from galaxy to galaxy but also withwavelength for a given object. in the optical and near-ir, the sings galaxiesoccupy the same regions in the c_42-a-g-m_20 parameter space as other normalgalaxies in previous studies. however, they appear much less centrallyconcentrated, more asymmetric and with larger values of g when viewed in the uv(due to star-forming clumps scattered across the disk) and in the mid-ir (dueto the emission of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons at 8.0 microns and very hotdust at 24 microns).

0909.2658	radial distribution of stars, gas and dust in sings galaxies. ii.  derived dust properties	we present a detailed analysis of the radial distribution of dust propertiesin the sings sample, performed on a set of uv, ir and hi surface brightnessprofiles, combined with published molecular gas profiles and metallicitygradients. the internal extinction, derived from the tir-to-fuv luminosityratio, decreases with radius, and is larger in sb-sbc galaxies. the tir-to-fuvratio correlates with the uv spectral slope beta, following a sequence shiftedto redder uv colors with respect to that of starbursts. the star formationhistory (sfh) is identified as the main driver of this departure. we have alsoderived radial profiles of the total dust mass surface density, the fraction ofthe dust mass contributed by pahs, the fraction of the dust mass heated by veryintense starlight and the intensity of the radiation field heating the grains.the dust profiles are exponential, their radial scale-length being constantfrom sb to sd galaxies (only ~10% larger than the stellar scale-length). manys0/a-sab galaxies have central depressions in their dust radial distributions.the pah abundance increases with metallicity for 12+\log(o/h)&lt;9, and at largermetallicities the trend flattens and even reverses, with the sfh being aplausible underlying driver for this behavior. the dust-to-gas ratio is alsowell correlated with metallicity and therefore decreases with galactocentricradius.

0910.0774	star-forming or starbursting? the ultraviolet conundrum	compared to starburst galaxies, normal star forming galaxies have been shownto display a much larger dispersion of the dust attenuation at fixed reddeningthrough studies of the irx-beta diagram (the ir/uv ratio "irx" versus the uvcolor "beta"). to investigate the causes of this larger dispersion and attemptto isolate second parameters, we have used galex uv, ground-based optical, andspitzer infrared imaging of 8 nearby galaxies, and examined the properties ofindividual uv and 24 micron selected star forming regions. we concentrated onstar-forming regions, in order to isolate simpler star formation histories thanthose that characterize whole galaxies. we find that 1) the dispersion is notcorrelated with the mean age of the stellar populations, 2) a range of dustgeometries and dust extinction curves are the most likely causes for theobserved dispersion in the irx-beta diagram 3) together with some potentialdilution of the most recent star-forming population by older unrelated bursts,at least in the case of star-forming regions within galaxies, 4) we alsorecover some general characteristics of the regions, including a tight positivecorrelation between the amount of dust attenuation and the metal content.although generalizing our results to whole galaxies may not be immediate, thepossibility of a range of dust extinction laws and geometries should beaccounted for in the latter systems as well.

0911.2226	hst/nicmos paschen-alpha survey of the galactic center: overview	we have recently carried out the first wide-field hydrogen paschen-alpha lineimaging survey of the galactic center (gc), using the nicmos instrument aboardthe hubble space telescope. the survey maps out a region of 2253 pc^2 aroundthe central supermassive black hole (sgr a*) in the 1.87 and 1.90 micron narrowbands with a spatial resolution of 0.01 pc at a distance of 8 kpc. here wepresent an overview of the observations, data reduction, preliminary results,and potential scientific implications, as well as a description of therationale and design of the survey. we have produced mosaic maps of thepaschen-alpha line and continuum emission, giving an unprecedentedly highresolution and high sensitivity panoramic view of stars and photo-ionized gasin the nuclear environment of the galaxy. we detect a significant number ofpreviously undetected stars with paschen-alpha in emission. they are mostlikely massive stars with strong winds, as confirmed by our initial follow-upspectroscopic observations. about half of the newly detected massive stars arefound outside the known clusters (arches, quintuplet, and central). manypreviously known diffuse thermal features are now resolved into arrays ofintriguingly fine linear filaments indicating a profound role of magneticfields in sculpting the gas. the bright spiral-like paschen-alpha emissionaround sgr a* is seen to be well confined within the known dusty torus. in thedirections roughly perpendicular to it, we further detect faint, diffusepaschen-alpha emission features, which, like earlier radio images, suggest anoutflow from the structure. in addition, we detect various compactpaschen-alpha nebulae, probably tracing the accretion and/or ejection of starsat various evolutionary stages.

0707.4165	the opacity of spiral galaxy disks viii: structure of the cold ism	the quantity of dust in a spiral disk can be estimated using the dust'stypical emission or the extinction of a known source. in this paper, we comparetwo techniques, one based on emission and one on absorption, applied onsections of fourteen disk galaxies. the two measurements reflect, respectivelythe average and apparent optical depth of a disk section. hence, they dependdifferently on the average number and optical depth of ism structures in thedisk. the small scale geometry of the cold ism is critical for accurate modelsof the overall energy budget of spiral disks. ism geometry, relativecontributions of different stellar populations and dust emissivity are all freeparameters in galaxy spectral energy distribution (sed) models; they are alsosometimes degenerate, depending on wavelength coverage. our aim is to constraintypical ism geometry. the apparent optical depth measurement comes from thenumber of distant galaxies seen in hst images through the foreground disk. wemeasure the ir flux in images from the {\it spitzer} infrared nearby galaxysurvey in the same section of the disk that was covered by hst. a physicalmodel of the dust is fit to the sed to estimate the dust surface density, meantemperature, and brightness in these disk sections. the surface density issubsequently converted into the average optical depth estimate. the twomeasurements generally agree. the ratios between the measured average andapparent optical depths of the disk sections imply optically thin clouds inthese disks. optically thick disks, are likely to have more than a single cloudalong the line-of-sight.

0707.4167	gaps in the cloud cover? comparing extinction measures in spiral disks	dust in galaxies can be mapped by either the fir/sub-mm emission, the opticalor infrared reddening of starlight, or the extinction of a known backgroundsource. we compare two dust extinction measurements for a set of fifteensections in thirteen nearby galaxies, to determine the scale of the dusty ismresponsible for disk opacity: one using stellar reddening and the other a knownbackground source. in our earlier papers, we presented extinction measurementsof 29 galaxies, based on calibrated counts of distant background objectsidentified though foreground disks in hst/wfpc2 images. for the 13 galaxiesthat overlap with the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings), we nowcompare these results with those obtained from an i-l color map. our goal is todetermine whether or not a detected distant galaxy indicates a gap in the dustyism, and hence to better understand the nature and geometry of the diskextinction.  we find that distant galaxies are predominantly in low-extinction sectionsmarked by the color maps, indicating that their number depends both on thecloud cover of {\it spitzer}-resolved dust structures --mostly the spiralarms--and a diffuse, unresolved underlying disk. we note that our infraredcolor map (e[i-l]) underestimates the overall dust presence in these disksseverely, because it implicitly assumes the presence of a dust screen in frontof the stellar distribution.

1003.0961	the calibration of monochromatic far-infrared star formation rate  indicators	(abridged) spitzer data at 24, 70, and 160 micron and ground-based h-alphaimages are analyzed for a sample of 189 nearby star-forming and starburstgalaxies to investigate whether reliable star formation rate (sfr) indicatorscan be defined using the monochromatic infrared dust emission centered at 70and 160 micron. we compare recently published recipes for sfr measures usingcombinations of the 24 micron and observed h-alpha luminosities with thoseusing 24 micron luminosity alone. from these comparisons, we derive a referencesfr indicator for use in our analysis. linear correlations between sfr and the70 and 160 micron luminosity are found for l(70)&gt;=1.4x10^{42} erg/s andl(160)&gt;=2x10^{42} erg/s, corresponding to sfr&gt;=0.1-0.3 m_sun/yr. below thosetwo luminosity limits, the relation between sfr and 70 micron (160 micron)luminosity is non-linear and sfr calibrations become problematic. thedispersion of the data around the mean trend increases for increasingwavelength, becoming about 25% (factor ~2) larger at 70 (160) micron than at 24micron. the increasing dispersion is likely an effect of the increasingcontribution to the infrared emission of dust heated by stellar populations notassociated with the current star formation. the non-linear relation between sfrand the 70 and 160 micron emission at faint galaxy luminosities suggests thatthe increasing transparency of the interstellar medium, decreasing effectivedust temperature, and decreasing filling factor of star forming regions acrossthe galaxy become important factors for decreasing luminosity. the sfrcalibrations are provided for galaxies with oxygen abundance 12+log(o/h)&gt;8.1.at lower metallicity the infrared luminosity no longer reliably traces the sfrbecause galaxies are less dusty and more transparent.

1003.1339	total infrared luminosity estimation of resolved and unresolved galaxies	the total infrared (tir) luminosity from galaxies can be used to examine bothstar formation and dust physics. we provide here new relations to estimate thetir luminosity from various spitzer bands, in particular from the 8 micron and24 micron bands. to do so, we use 45" subregions within a subsample of nearbyface-on spiral galaxies from the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey(sings) that have known oxygen abundances as well as integrated galaxy datafrom the sings, the local volume legacy survey (lvl) and engelbracht et al.(2008) samples. taking into account the oxygen abundances of the subregions,the star formation rate intensity, and the relative emission of the polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbons at 8 micron, the warm dust at 24 micron and the cold dustat 70 micron and 160 micron we derive new relations to estimate the tirluminosity from just one or two of the spitzer bands. we also show that themetallicity and the star formation intensity must be taken into account whenestimating the tir luminosity from two wave bands, especially when datalongward of 24 micron are not available.

1004.1441	an aromatic inventory of the local volume	using infrared photometry from the spitzer space telescope, we perform thefirst inventory of aromatic feature emission (afe, but also commonly referredto as pah emission) for a statistically complete sample of star-forminggalaxies in the local volume. the photometric methodology involved iscalibrated and demonstrated to recover the aromatic fraction of the irac 8micron flux with a standard deviation of 6% for a training set of 40 singsgalaxies (ranging from stellar to dust dominated) with both suitablemid-infrared spitzer irs spectra and equivalent photometry. a potential factorof two improvement could be realized with suitable 5.5 and 10 micronphotometry, such as what may be provided in the future by jwst. the resultingtechnique is then applied to mid-infrared photometry for the 258 galaxies fromthe local volume legacy (lvl) survey, a large sample dominated in number bylow-luminosity dwarf galaxies for which obtaining comparable mid-infraredspectroscopy is not feasible. we find the total lvl luminosity due to fivestrong aromatic features in the 8 micron complex to be 2.47e10 solarluminosities with a mean volume density of 8.8e6 solar luminosities per cubicmegaparsec. twenty-four of the lvl galaxies, corresponding to a luminosity cutat m = -18.22 in the b band, account for 90% of the aromatic luminosity. usingoxygen abundances compiled from the literature for 129 of the 258 lvl galaxies,we find a correlation between metallicity and the aromatic to total infraredemission ratio but not the aromatic to total 8 micron dust emission ratio. apossible explanation is that metallicity plays a role in the abundance ofaromatic molecules relative to the total dust content, but other factors suchas star formation and/or the local radiation field affect the excitation ofthose molecules.

1005.1611	far-infrared line imaging of the starburst ring in ngc 1097 with the  herschel/pacs spectrometer	ngc 1097 is a nearby sbb galaxy with a seyfert nucleus and a bright starburstring. we study the physical properties of the interstellar medium (ism) in thering using spatially resolved far-infrared spectral maps of the circumnuclearstarburst ring of ngc 1097, obtained with the pacs spectrometer on board theherschel space telescope. in particular, we map the important ism cooling anddiagnostic emission lines of [oi] 63 $\mu$m, [oiii] 88 $\mu$m, [nii] 122$\mu$m, [cii] 158 $\mu$m and [nii] 205 $\mu$m. we observe that in the [oi] 63$\mu$m, [oiii] 88 $\mu$m, and [nii] 122 $\mu$m line maps, the emission isenhanced in clumps along the ne part of the ring. we observe evidence of rapidrotation in the circumnuclear ring, with a rotation velocity of ~220$ kms$^{-1}$ (inclination uncorrected) measured in all lines. the [oi] 63$\mu$m/[cii] 158 $\mu$m ratio varies smoothly throughout the central region,and is enhanced on the northeastern part of the ring, which may indicate astronger radiation field. this enhancement coincides with peaks in the [oi] 63$\mu$m and [oiii] 88 $\mu$m maps. variations of the [nii] 122 $\mu$m/[nii] 205$\mu$m ratio correspond to a range in the ionized gas density between 150 and400 cm$^{-3}$.

1005.1887	enhanced dust heating in the bulges of early-type spiral galaxies	stellar density and bar strength should affect the temperatures of the cool(t ~ 20-30 k) dust component in the inner regions of galaxies, which impliesthat the ratio of temperatures in the circumnuclear regions to the disk shoulddepend on hubble type. we investigate the differences between cool dusttemperatures in the central 3 kpc and disk of 13 nearby galaxies by fittingmodels to measurements between 70 and 500 microns. we attempt to quantifytemperature trends in nearby disk galaxies, with archival data fromspitzer/mips and new observations with herschel/spire, which were acquiredduring the first phases of the herschel observations for the kingfish (keyinsights in nearby galaxies: a far-infrared survey with herschel) sample. wefit single-temperature modified blackbodies to far-infrared and submillimetermeasurements of the central and disk regions of galaxies to determine thetemperature of the component(s) emitting at those wavelengths. we present theratio of central-region-to-disk-temperatures of the cool dust component of 13nearby galaxies as a function of morphological type. we find a significanttemperature gradient in the cool dust component in all galaxies, with a meancenter-to-disk temperature ratio of 1.15 +/- 0.03. the cool dust temperaturesin the central ~3 kpc of nearby galaxies are 23(+/-3)% hotter for morphologicaltypes earlier than sc, and only 9(+/-3)% hotter for later types. thetemperature ratio is also correlated with bar strength, with only stronglybarred galaxies having a ratio over 1.2. the strong radiation field in the highstellar density of a galactic bulge tends to heat the cool dust component tohigher temperatures, at least in early-type spirals with relatively largebulges, especially when paired with a strong bar.

1005.1959	mapping far-ir emission from the central kiloparsec of ngc 1097	using photometry of ngc 1097 from the herschel pacs (photodetector arraycamera and spectrometer) instrument, we study the resolved properties ofthermal dust continuum emission from a circumnuclear starburst ring with aradius ~ 900 pc. these observations are the first to resolve the structure of acircumnuclear ring at wavelengths that probe the peak (i.e. lambda ~ 100micron) of the dust spectral energy distribution. the ring dominates thefar-infrared (far-ir) emission from the galaxy - the high angular resolution ofpacs allows us to isolate the ring's contribution and we find it is responsiblefor 75, 60 and 55% of the total flux of ngc 1097 at 70, 100 and 160 micron,respectively. we compare the far-ir structure of the ring to what is seen atother wavelengths and identify a sequence of far-ir bright knots thatcorrespond to those seen in radio and mid-ir images. the mid- and far-ir bandratios in the ring vary by less than +/- 20% azimuthally, indicating modestvariation in the radiation field heating the dust on ~ 600 pc scales. weexplore various explanations for the azimuthal uniformity in the far-ir colorsof the ring including a lack of well-defined age gradients in the young stellarcluster population, a dominant contribution to the far-ir emission from dustheated by older (&gt; 10 myr) stars and/or a quick smoothing of local enhancementsin dust temperature due to the short orbital period of the ring. finally, weimprove previous limits on the far-ir flux from the inner ~ 600 pc of ngc 1097by an order of magnitude, providing a better estimate of the total bolometricemission arising from the active galactic nucleus and its associated centralstarburst.

1005.2182	100 mum and 160 mum emission as resolved star-formation rate estimators  in m33 (herm33es)	over the past few years several studies have provided estimates of the sfr(star-formation rate) or the total infrared luminosity from just one infraredband. however these relations are generally derived for entire galaxies, whichare known to contain a large scale diffuse emission that is not necessarilyrelated to the latest star-formation episode. we provide new relations toestimate the sfr from resolved star-forming regions at 100 mum and 160 mum. weselect individual star-forming regions in the nearby (840 kpc) galaxy m33. weestimate the sfr combining the emission in halpha and at 24 mum to calibratethe emission at 100 mum and 160 mum as sfr estimators, as mapped withpacs/herschel. the data are obtained in the framework of the herm33es open timekey project. there is less emission in the hii regions at 160 mum than at 100mum. over a dynamic range of almost 2 dex in sigma(sfr) we find that the 100mum emission is a nearly linear estimator of the sfr, whereas that at 160 mumis slightly superlinear. the behaviour of individual star-forming regions issurprisingly similar to that of entire galaxies. at high sigma(sfr), starformation drives the dust temperature, whereas uncertainties and variations inradiation-transfer and dust-heated processes dominate at low sigma(sfr).detailed modelling of both galaxies and individual star forming regions will beneeded to interpret similarities and differences between the two and assess thefraction of diffuse emission in galaxies.

1005.2297	properties of compact 250 \mu m emission and hii regions in m33  (herm33es)	within the framework of the herm33es key project, using the high resolutionand sensitivity of the herschel photometric data, we study the compact emissionin the local group spiral galaxy m33 to investigate the nature of the compactspire emission sources. we extracted a catalogue of sources at 250um in orderto investigate the nature of this compact emission. taking advantage of theunprecedented herschel resolution at these wavelengths, we also focus on a moreprecise study of some striking halpha shells in the northern part of thegalaxy. we present a catalogue of 159 compact emission sources in m33identified by sextractor in the 250um spire band that is the one that providesthe best spatial resolution. we also measured fluxes at 24um and halpha forthose 159 extracted sources. the morphological study of the shells alsobenefits from a multiwavelength approach including halpha, far-uv from galex,and infrared from both spitzer irac 8um and mips 24um in order to makecomparisons. for the 159 compact sources selected at 250um, we find a verystrong pearson correlation coefficient with the mips 24um emission (r24 = 0.94)and a rather strong correlation with the halpha emission, although with morescatter (rha = 0.83). the morphological study of the halpha shells shows adisplacement between far-ultraviolet, halpha, and the spire bands. the cooldust emission from spire clearly delineates the halpha shell structures. thevery strong link between the 250um compact emission and the 24um and halphaemissions, by recovering the star formation rate from standard recipes for hiiregions, allows us to provide star formation rate calibrations based on the250um compact emission alone. the different locations of the halpha andfar-ultraviolet emissions with respect to the spire cool dust emission leads toa dynamical age of a few myr for the halpha shells and the associated cooldust.

1005.2563	pacs and spire photometer maps of m33: first results of the herschel m33  extended survey (herm33es)	within the framework of the herm33es key project, we are studying the starforming interstellar medium in the nearby, metal-poor spiral galaxy m33,exploiting the high resolution and sensitivity of herschel. we use pacs andspire maps at 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 micron wavelength, to study thevariation of the spectral energy distributions (seds) with galacto-centricdistance. detailed sed modeling is performed using azimuthally averaged fluxesin elliptical rings of 2 kpc width, out to 8 kpc galacto-centric distance.simple isothermal and two-component grey body models, with fixed dustemissivity index, are fitted to the seds between 24 and 500 micron using alsomips/spitzer data, to derive first estimates of the dust physical conditions.the far-infrared and submillimeter maps reveal the branched, knotted spiralstructure of m33. an underlying diffuse disk is seen in all spire maps (250-500micron). two component fits to the seds agree better than isothermal modelswith the observed, total and radially averaged flux densities. the twocomponent model, with beta fixed at 1.5, best fits the global and the radialseds. the cold dust component clearly dominates; the relative mass of the warmcomponent is less than 0.3% for all the fits. the temperature of the warmcomponent is not well constrained and is found to be about 60k plus/minus 10k.the temperature of the cold component drops significantly from about 24k in theinner 2 kpc radius to 13k beyond 6 kpc radial distance, for the best fittingmodel. the gas-to-dust ratio for beta=1.5, averaged over the galaxy, is higherthan the solar value by a factor of 1.5 and is roughly in agreement with thesubsolar metallicity of m33.

1005.3071	hubble space telescope wfc3 early release science: emission-line  galaxies from infrared grism observations	we present grism spectra of emission-line galaxies (elgs) from 0.6-1.6microns from the wide field camera 3 on the hubble space telescope. these newinfrared grism data augment previous optical advanced camera for surveys g800l0.6-0.95 micron grism data in goods-south from the pears program, extending thewavelength covereage well past the g800l red cutoff. the ers grism field wasobserved at a depth of 2 orbits per grism, yielding spectra of hundreds offaint objects, a subset of which are presented here. elgs are studied via theha, [oiii], and [oii] emission lines detected in the redshift ranges 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.4,1.2&lt;z&lt;2.2 and 2.0&lt;z&lt;3.3 respectively in the g102 (0.8-1.1 microns; r~210) andg141 (1.1-1.6 microns; r~130) grisms. the higher spectral resolution affordedby the wfc3 grisms also reveals emission lines not detectable with the g800lgrism (e.g., [sii] and [siii] lines). from these relatively shallowobservations, line luminosities, star-formation rates, and grism spectroscopicredshifts are determined for a total of 48 elgs to m(ab)~25 mag. seventeengoods-south galaxies that previously only had photometric redshifts now havenew grism-spectroscopic redshifts, in some cases with large corrections to thephotometric redshifts (delta(z)~0.3-0.5). additionally, one galaxy had nopreviously-measured redshift but now has a secure grism-spectroscopic redshift,for a total of 18 new goods-south spectroscopic redshifts. the faintest sourcein our sample has a magnitude m(ab)=26.9 mag. the ers grism data also reflectthe expected trend of lower specific star formation rates for the highest massgalaxies in the sample as a function of redshift, consistent with downsizingand discovered previously from large surveys. these results demonstrate theremarkable efficiency and capability of the wfc3 nir grisms for measuringgalaxy properties to faint magnitudes and redshifts to z&gt;2.

1005.3422	cool gas and dust in m33: results from the herschel m33 extended survey  (herm33es)	we present an analysis of the first space-based far-ir-submm observations ofm 33, which measure the emission from the cool dust and resolve the giantmolecular cloud complexes. with roughly half-solar abundances, m33 is a firststep towards young low-metallicity galaxies where the submm may be able toprovide an alternative to co mapping to measure their h$_2$ content. in thisletter, we measure the dust emission cross-section $\sigma$ using spire andrecent co and \hi\ observations; a variation in $\sigma$ is present from anear-solar neighborhood cross-section to about half-solar with the maximumbeing south of the nucleus. calculating the total h column density from themeasured dust temperature and cross-section, and then subtracting the \hi\column, yields a morphology similar to that observed in co. the h$_2$/\hi\ massratio decreases from about unity to well below 10% and is about 15% averagedover the optical disk. the single most important observation to reduce thepotentially large systematic errors is to complete the co mapping of m 33.

1007.1460	the size evolution of passive galaxies: observations from the wide field  camera 3 early release science program	we present results on the size evolution of passively evolving galaxies at1&lt;z&lt;2 drawn from the wide field camera 3 early release science program. oursample was constructed using an analog to the passive bzk selection criterion,which isolates galaxies with little or no on-going star formation at z&gt;1.5. weidentify 30 galaxies in ~40 square arcmin to h&lt;25 mag. we supplementspectroscopic redshifts from the literature with photometric redshiftsdetermined from the 15-band photometry from 0.22-8 micron. we determineeffective radii from sersic profile fits to the h-band image using an empiricalpsf. we find that size evolution is a strong function of stellar mass, with themost massive (m* ~ 10^11 msol) galaxies undergoing the most rapid evolutionfrom z~2 to the present. parameterizing the size evolution as (1+z)^{-alpha},we find a tentative scaling between alpha and stellar mass of alpha ~ -1.8+1.4log(m*/10^9 msol). we briefly discuss the implications of this result for ourunderstanding of the dynamical evolution of the red galaxies.

1101.4023	the displaced dusty ism of ngc 3077: tidal stripping in the m 81 triplet	we present the detection of extended (~30 kpc^2) dust emission in the tidal\hi\ arm near ngc 3077 (member of the m\,81 triplet) using spire on boardherschel. dust emission in the tidal arm is typically detected where the \hi\column densities are &gt;10^21 cm^-2. the spire band ratios show that the dust inthe tidal arm is significantly colder (~13 k) than in ngc 3077 itself (~31 k),consistent with the lower radiation field in the tidal arm. the total dust massin the tidal arm is ~1.8 x 10^6 m_sun (assuming beta=2), i.e. substantiallylarger than the dust mass associated with ngc 3077 (~2 x 10^5 m_sun). wheredust is detected, the dust-to-gas ratio is 6+/-3 x 10^-3, consistent within theuncertainties with what is found in ngc 3077 and nearby spiral galaxies withgalactic metallicities. the faint hii regions in the tidal arm can not beresponsible for the detected enriched material and are not the main source ofthe dust heating in the tidal arm. we conclude that the interstellar medium(atomic hi, molecules and dust) in this tidal feature was pre-enriched andstripped off ngc 3077 during its recent interaction (~3 x 10^8 yr ago) with m82 and m 81. this implies that interaction can efficiently remove heavyelements and enriched material (dust, molecular gas) from galaxies. asinteractions were more frequent at large lookback times, it is conceivable thatthey could substantially contribute (along with galactic outflows) to theenrichment of the intergalactic medium.

1104.0929	the star formation rate distribution function of the local universe	we present total infrared (ir) and ultraviolet (uv) luminosity functionsderived from large representative samples of galaxies at z ~ 0, selected at irand uv wavelengths from the iras iifscz catalogue, and the galex aisrespectively. we augment these with deep spitzer and galex imaging of galaxiesin the 11 mpc local volume legacy survey (lvl), allowing us to extend theseluminosity functions to lower luminosities (~10^6 l_sun), and providing goodconstraints on the slope of the luminosity function at the extreme faint endfor the first time. using conventional star formation prescriptions, wegenerate from our data the sfr distribution function for the local universe. wefind that it has a schechter form, that the faint-end slope has a constantvalue (to the limits of our data) of {\alpha} = -1.51 \pm 0.08, and the'characteristic' sfr is 9.2 m_sun/yr. we also show the distribution function ofthe sfr volume density; we then use this to calculate a value for the total sfrvolume density at z ~ 0 of 0.025 \pm 0.0016 m_sun/yr/mpc^-3, of which ~ 20% isoccurring in starbursts. decomposing the total star formation by infraredluminosity, it can be seen that 9 \pm 1% is due to lirgs, and 0.7 \pm 0.2% isoccuring in ulirgs. by comparing uv and ir emission for galaxies in our sample,we also calculate the fraction of star formation occurring in dust obscuredenvironments, and examine the distribution of dusty star formation: we find avery shallow slope at the highly extincted end, which may be attributable toline of sight orientation effects as well as conventional internal extinction.

1105.1703	hst paschen-alpha survey of the galactic center: data reduction and  products	our hst/nicmos pa survey of the galactic center (gc) provides a uniform,panoramic, high-resolution map of stars and ionized diffuse gas in the central416 arcmin^2 of the galaxy. this survey was carried out with 144 hst orbitsusing two narrow-band filters at 1.87 and 1.90 micron in nicmos camera 3. inthis paper, we describe in detail the data reduction and mosaicking proceduresfollowed, including background level matching and astrometric corrections. wehave detected ~570,000 near-ir sources and are able to quantify photometricuncertainties of the detections. the source detection limit varies across thesurvey field but the typical 50% completion limit is ~17th mag (vega system) inthe 1.90 micron band. a comparison with the expected stellar magnitudedistribution shows that these sources are primarily main-sequence massive stars(&gt;7m) and evolved lower mass stars at the distance of the gc. in particular,the observed source magnitude distribution exhibits a prominent peak, whichcould represent the red clump stars within the gc. the observed magnitude andcolor of these rc stars support a steep extinction curve in the near-ir towardthe gc. the flux ratios of our detected sources in the two bands also allow foran adaptive and statistical estimate of extinction across the field. with thesubtraction of the extinction-corrected continuum, we construct a net paemission map and identify a set of pa-emitting sources, which should mostly beevolved massive stars with strong stellar winds. the majority of the identifiedpa point sources are located within the three known massive gc stellarclusters. however, a significant fraction of our pa-emitting sources arelocated outside the clusters and may represent a new class of `field' massivestars, many of which may have formed in isolation and/or in small groups. themaps and source catalogues presented here are available electronically.

1105.2537	goods-herschel: an infrared main sequence for star-forming galaxies	we present the deepest far-ir observations obtained with herschel and examinethe 3-500um seds of galaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;2.5, supplemented by a local referencesample from iras, iso, spitzer and akari data. we find that the ratio of totalir luminosity to rest-frame 8um luminosity, ir8 (=lir/l8), follows a gaussiandistribution centered on ir8=4 and defines an ir main sequence (ms). a minoritypopulation (&lt;20 %) of outliers producing a tail skewed toward higher values ofir8 consist of starbursts (sb) with compact projected star formation densities.ir8 can be used to separate galaxies with normal and extended modes of starformation from compact sbs with high-ir8, high projected ir surface brightness(&gt;3x10^10 lsun kpc^-2) and a high specific sfr (i.e., sbs). the rest-frame,uv-2700a size of these distant sbs is typically half that of ms galaxies,supporting the correlation between star formation density and sb activity thatis measured for the local sample. locally, (u)lirgs are systematically in thesb mode, whereas most distant (u)lirgs form stars in the "normal" ms mode. thisconfusion between two modes of star formation is the cause of the so-called"mid-ir excess" population of galaxies found at z&gt;1.5 by previous studies. msgalaxies have strong pah emission line features, a broad far-ir bump resultingfrom a combination of dust temperatures (tdust~15-50 k), and an effectivetdust~31 k, as derived from the peak wavelength of their ir sed. galaxies inthe sb regime instead exhibit weak pah ew and a sharper far-ir bump with aneffective tdust~40 k. finally, we present evidence that the mid-to-far iremission of x-ray agns is predominantly produced by star formation and thatcandidate dusty agns with a power-law emission in the mid-ir systematicallyoccur in compact, dusty sbs. after correcting for the effect of sbs on ir8, weidentify new candidates for extremely obscured agns.

1105.4877	calibrating extinction-free star formation rate diagnostics with 33ghz  free-free emission in ngc6946	abridged: using free-free emission measured in the ka-band (26-40ghz) for 10star-forming regions in the nearby galaxy ngc6946, including its starburstingnucleus, we compare a number of sfr diagnostics that are typically consideredto be unaffected by interstellar extinction: i.e., non-thermal radio (i.e.,1.4ghz), total infrared (ir; 8-1000um), and warm dust (i.e., 24um) emission,along with the hybrid (obscured + unobscured) indicators of h\alpha+24um anduv+ir. the 33ghz free-free emission is assumed to provide the most accuratemeasure of the current sfr. among the extranuclear star-forming regions, the24um, h\alpha+24um and uv+ir sfr calibrations are in good agreement with the33ghz free-free sfrs. however, each of the sfr calibrations relying on someform of dust emission overestimate the nuclear sfr by a factor of ~2. this ismore likely the result of excess dust heating through an accumulation ofnon-ionizing stars associated with an extended episode of star formation in thenucleus rather than increased competition for ionizing photons by dust. sfrcalibrations using the non-thermal radio continuum yield values which onlyagree with the free-free sfrs for the nucleus, and underestimate the sfrs fromthe extranuclear star-forming regions by a factor of ~2. this result likelyarises from the cr electrons decaying within the starburst region withnegligible escape compared to the young extranuclear star-forming regions.finally, we find that the sfrs estimated using the total 33ghz emission agreewell with the free-free sfrs due to the large thermal fractions present atthese frequencies even when local diffuse backgrounds are not removed. thus,rest-frame 33ghz observations may act as a reliable method to measure the sfrsof galaxies at increasingly high redshift without the need of ancillary radiodata to account for the non-thermal emission.

1201.2558	dust and gas power-spectrum in m33 (herm33es)	power spectra of de-projected images of late-type galaxies in gas and/or dustemission are very useful diagnostics of the dynamics and stability of theirinterstellar medium. previous studies have shown that the power spectra can beapproximated as two power-laws, a shallow one at large scales (larger than 500pc) and a steeper one at small scales, with the break between the twocorresponding to the line-of-sight thickness of the galaxy disk. we present athorough analysis of the power spectra of the dust and gas emission at severalwavelengths in the nearby galaxy m33. in particular, we use the recentlyobtained images at five wavelengths by pacs and spire onboard herschel. thelarge dynamical range (2-3 dex in scale) of most images allow us to determineclearly the change in slopes from -1.5 to -4, with some variations withwavelength. the break scale is increasing with wavelength, from 100 pc at 24and 100micron to 350 pc at 500micron, suggesting that the cool dust lies in athicker disk than the warm dust, may be due to star formation more confined tothe plane. the slope at small scale tends to be steeper at longer wavelength,meaning that the warmer dust is more concentrated in clumps. numericalsimulations of an isolated late-type galaxy, rich in gas and with no bulge,like m33, are carried out, in order to better interpret these observed results.varying the star formation and feedback parameters, it is possible to obtain arange of power-spectra, with two power-law slopes and breaks, which nicelybracket the data. the small-scale power-law is indeed reflecting the 3dbehaviour of the gas layer, steepening strongly while the feedback smoothes thestructures, by increasing the gas turbulence. m33 appears to correspond to afiducial model with an sfr of $\sim$ 0.7 mo/yr, with 10% supernovae energycoupled to the gas kinematics.

1204.0554	a study of heating and cooling of the ism in ngc 1097 with herschel-pacs  and spitzer-irs	ngc 1097 is a nearby seyfert 1 galaxy with a bright circumnuclear starburstring, a strong large-scale bar and an active nucleus. we present a detailedstudy of the spatial variation of the far infrared (fir) [cii]158um and[oi]63um lines and mid-infrared h2 emission lines as tracers of gas cooling,and of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) bands as tracers of thephotoelectric heating, using herschel-pacs, and spitzer-irs infrared spectralmaps. we focus on the nucleus and the ring, and two star forming regions (enucn and enuc s). we estimated a photoelectric gas heating efficiency([cii]158um+[oi]63um)/pah in the ring about 50% lower than in enuc n and s. theaverage 11.3/7.7um pah ratio is also lower in the ring, which may suggest alarger fraction of ionized pahs, but no clear correlation with[cii]158{\mu}m/pah(5.5 - 14um) is found. pahs in the ring are responsible for afactor of two more [cii]158um and [oi]63um emission per unit mass than pahs inthe enuc s. sed modeling indicates that at most 25% of the fir power in thering and enuc s can come from high intensity photodissociation regions (pdrs),in which case g0 ~ 10^2.3 and nh ~ 10^3.5 cm^-3 in the ring. for these valuesof g0 and nh pdr models cannot reproduce the observed h2 emission. much of thethe h2 emission in the starburst ring could come from warm regions in thediffuse ism that are heated by turbulent dissipation or shocks.

1206.6116	stellar populations of lyman break galaxies at z=1-3 in the hst/wfc3  early release science observations	we analyze the spectral energy distributions (seds) of lyman break galaxies(lbgs) at z=1-3 selected using the hubble space telescope (hst) wide fieldcamera 3 (wfc3) uvis channel filters. these hst/wfc3 observations cover about50 sq. arcmin in the goods-south field as a part of the wfc3 early releasescience program. these lbgs at z=1-3 are selected using dropout selectioncriteria similar to high redshift lbgs. the deep multi-band photometry in thisfield is used to identify best-fit sed models, from which we infer thefollowing results: (1) the photometric redshift estimate of these dropoutselected lbgs is accurate to within few percent; (2) the uv spectral slope(beta) is redder than at high redshift (z&gt;3), where lbgs are less dusty; (3) onaverage, lbgs at z=1-3 are massive, dustier and more highly star-forming,compared to lbgs at higher redshifts with similar luminosities(0.1l*&lt;~l&lt;~2.5l*), though their median values are similar within 1-sigmauncertainties. this could imply that identical dropout selection technique, atall redshifts, find physically similar galaxies; and (4) stellar masses ofthese lbgs are directly proportional to their uv luminosities with alogarithmic slope of ~0.46, and star-formation rates are proportional to theirstellar masses with a logarithmic slope of ~0.90. these relations hold true ---within luminosities probed in this study --- for lbgs from z~1.5 to 5. thestar-forming galaxies selected using other color-based techniques show similarcorrelations at z~2, but to avoid any selection biases, and for directcomparison with lbgs at z&gt;3, a true lyman break selection at z~2 is essential.the future hst uv surveys, both wider and deeper, covering a large luminosityrange are important to better understand lbg properties, and their evolution.

1207.1301	mapping the cold dust temperatures and masses of nearby kingfish  galaxies with herschel	taking advantage of the sensitivity and angular resolution of the herschelspace observatory at far-infrared and submm wavelengths, we aim to characterizethe physical properties of cold dust within nearby galaxies and study therobustness of the parameters we derive using different modified blackbodymodels. for a pilot subsample of the kingfish program, we perform 2 temperaturefits of the spitzer and herschel photometric data (24 to 500um), with a warmand a cold component, globally and in each resolution element.at global scales,we observe ranges of values for beta_c(0.8 to 2.5) and tc(19.1 to 25.1k).wecompute maps of our parameters with beta fixed or free to test the robustnessof the temperature and dust surface density maps we deduce. when the emissivityis fixed, we observe temperature gradients as a function of radius.when theemissivity is fitted as a free parameter, barred galaxies tend to have uniformfitted emissivities.gathering resolved elements in a tc-beta_c diagramunderlines an anti-correlation between the two parameters.it remains difficultto assess whether the dominant effect is the physics of dust grains, noise, ormixing along the line of sight and in the beam. we finally observe in bothcases that the dust column density peaks in central regions of galaxies and barends (coinciding with molecular gas density enhancements usually found in theselocations).we also quantify how the total dust mass varies with our assumptionsabout the emissivity index as well as the influence of the wavelength coverageused in the fits. we show that modified blackbody fits using a shallowemissivity (beta_c &lt; 2.0) lead to significantly lower dust masses compared tothe beta_c &lt; 2.0 case, with dust masses lower by up to 50% if beta_c=1.5 forinstance.the working resolution affects our total dust mass estimates: massesincrease from global fits to spatially-resolved fits.

1207.4186	modeling dust and starlight in galaxies observed by spitzer and  herschel: ngc 628 and ngc 6946	we characterize the dust in ngc628 and ngc6946, two nearby spiral galaxies inthe kingfish sample. with data from 3.6um to 500um, dust models are stronglyconstrained. using the draine &amp; li (2007) dust model, (amorphous silicate andcarbonaceous grains), for each pixel in each galaxy we estimate (1) dust masssurface density, (2) dust mass fraction contributed by polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons (pah)s, (3) distribution of starlight intensities heating thedust, (4) total infrared (ir) luminosity emitted by the dust, and (5) irluminosity originating in regions with high starlight intensity. we obtain mapsfor the dust properties, which trace the spiral structure of the galaxies. thedust models successfully reproduce the observed global and resolved spectralenergy distributions (seds). the overall dust/h mass ratio is estimated to be0.0082+/-0.0017 for ngc628, and 0.0063+/-0.0009 for ngc6946, consistent withwhat is expected for galaxies of near-solar metallicity. our derived dustmasses are larger (by up to a factor 3) than estimates based onsingle-temperature modified blackbody fits. we show that the sed fits aresignificantly improved if the starlight intensity distribution includes a(single intensity) "delta function" component. we find no evidence forsignificant masses of cold dust t&lt;12k. discrepancies between pacs and mipsphotometry in both low and high surface brightness areas result in largeuncertainties when the modeling is done at pacs resolutions, in which casespire, mips70 and mips160 data cannot be used. we recommend against attemptingto model dust at the angular resolution of pacs.

1210.6349	physical conditions in molecular clouds in the arm and interarm regions  of m51	we report systematic variations in the co(2-1)/co(1-0) line ratio (r) in m51.the ratio shows clear evidence for the evolution of molecular gas from theupstream interarm regions, passage into the spiral arms and back into thedownstream interarm regions. in the interarm regions, r is typically low &lt;0.7(and often 0.4-0.6); this is similar to the ratios observed in galactic giantmolecular clouds (gmcs) with low far-ir luminosities. however, the ratio risesto &gt;0.7 (often 0.8-1.0) in the spiral arms, particularly at their leading(downstream) edge. r is also high, 0.8-1.0, in the central region. an lvgcalculation provides insight into the changes in the gas physical conditionsbetween the arm and interarm regions: cold and low density gas (~10k, ~300cm-3)is required for the interarm gmcs, but this gas must become warmer and/ordenser in the more active star forming spiral arms. r is higher in areas ofhigh 24micron brightness (an approximate tracer of star formation rate surfacedensity) and high co(1-0) integrated intensity (a well-calibrated tracer oftotal molecular gas surface density). the systematic enhancement of the co(2-1)line relative to co(1-0) in luminous star forming regions suggests that somecaution is needed when using co(2-1) as a tracer of bulk molecular gas mass.

1212.1208	the co-to-h2 conversion factor and dust-to-gas ratio on kiloparsec  scales in nearby galaxies	we present kiloparsec (kpc) spatial resolution maps of the co-to-h2conversion factor (alpha_co) and dust-to-gas ratio (dgr) in 26 nearby,star-forming galaxies. we have simultaneously solved for alpha_co and dgr byassuming that the dgr is approximately constant on kpc scales. with thisassumption, we can combine maps of dust mass surface density, co integratedintensity and hi column density to solve for both alpha_co and dgr with noassumptions about their value or dependence on metallicity or other parameters.such a study has just become possible with the availability of high resolutionfar-ir maps from the herschel key program kingfish, 12co j=(2-1) maps from theiram 30m large program heracles and hi 21-cm line maps from things. we use afixed ratio between the (2-1) and (1-0) lines to present our alpha_co resultson the more typically used 12co j=(1-0) scale and show using literaturemeasurements that variations in the line ratio do not effect our results. intotal, we derive 782 individual solutions for alpha_co and dgr. on average,alpha_co = 3.1 msun pc^-2 (k km s^-1)^-1 for our sample with a standarddeviation of 0.3 dex. within galaxies we observe a generally flat profile ofalpha_co as a function of galactocentric radius. however, most galaxies exhibita lower alpha_co in the central kpc---a factor of ~2 below the galaxy mean, onaverage. in some cases, the central alpha_co value can be factors of 5 to 10below the standard milky way (mw) value of alpha_co,mw =4.4 msun pc^-2 (k kms^-1)^-1. while for alpha_co we find only weak correlations with metallicity,dgr is well-correlated with metallicity, with an approximately linear slope.finally, we present several recommendations for choosing an appropriatealpha_co for studies of nearby galaxies.

1301.5917	spectral energy distributions of hii regions in m33 (herm33es)	within the framework of the herschel m 33 extended survey herm33es we studythe spectral energy distribution (sed) of a set of hii regions in m 33 as afunction of the morphology. we present a catalogue of 119 hii regionsmorphologically classified: 9 filled, 47 mixed, 36 shell, and 27 clear shellhii regions. for each object we extract the photometry at twelve availablewavelength bands (from fuv-1516a to ir-250mi) and obtain the sed. we alsoobtain emission line profiles across the regions to study the location of thestellar, ionised gas, and dust components. we find trends for the seds relatedto the morphology, showing that the star and gas-dust configuration affects theratios of the emission in different bands. the mixed and filled regions showhigher emission at 24mi than the shells and clear shells, which could be due tothe proximity of the dust to the stellar clusters in the case of mixed andfilled regions. the fir peak for shells and clear shells seems to be locatedtowards longer wavelengths, indicating that the dust is colder for this type ofobjects.the logarithmic 100/70mi ratio for filled and mixed regions remainsconstant over one order of magnitude in halpha and fuv surface brightness,while the shells and clear shells exhibit a wider range of values of almost twoorders of magnitude. we derive dust masses and temperatures fitting theindividual seds with dust models proposed in the literature. the derived dustmass range is between 10^2-10^4 msun and the cold dust temperature spanst(cold)~12-27 k. the spherical geometrical model proposed for the halpha clearshells is confirmed by the emission profile obtained from the observations andis used to infer the electron density within the envelope: the typical electrondensity is 0.7+-0.3 cm^-3, while filled regions can reach values two to fivetimes higher.

1301.6884	a detailed study of the radio--fir correlation in ngc6946 with  herschel-pacs/spire from kingfish	we derive the distribution of the synchrotron spectral index across ngc6946and investigate the correlation between the radio continuum (synchrotron) andfar-infrared (fir) emission using the kingfish herschel pacs and spire data.the radio--fir correlation is studied as a function of star formation rate,magnetic field strength, radiation field strength, and the total gas surfacebrightness. the synchrotron emission follows both star-forming regions and theso-called magnetic arms present in the inter-arm regions. the synchrotronspectral index is steepest along the magnetic arms ($\alpha_n \sim 1$), whileit is flat in places of giant h{\sc ii} regions and in the center of the galaxy($\alpha_n \sim 0.6-0.7$). the map of $\alpha_n$ provides an observationalevidence for aging and energy loss of cosmic ray electrons propagating in thedisk of the galaxy. variations in the synchrotron--fir correlation across thegalaxy are shown to be a function of both star formation and magnetic fields.we find that the synchrotron emission correlates better with cold rather thanwith warm dust emission, when the interstellar radiation field is the mainheating source of dust. the synchrotron--fir correlation suggests a couplingbetween the magnetic field and the gas density. ngc6946 shows a power-lawbehavior between the total (turbulent) magnetic field strength b and the starformation rate surface density $\sigma_{\rm sfr}$ with an index of0.14\,(0.16)$\pm$0.01. this indicates an efficient production of the turbulentmagnetic field with the increasing gas turbulence expected in actively starforming regions. the scale-by-scale analysis of the synchrotron--fircorrelation indicates that the ism affects the propagation of old/diffusedcosmic ray electrons, resulting in a diffusion coefficient of $d_0=4.6\times10^{28}$\,cm$^2$\,s$^{-1}$ for 2.2\,gev cres.

1302.4363	calibration of the total infrared luminosity of nearby galaxies from  spitzer and herschel bands	we present new empirical calibrations to estimate resolved and integratedtotal infrared luminosities from spitzer and herschel bands used asmonochromatic or combined tracers. we base our calibrations on resolvedelements of nearby galaxies (3 to 30 mpc) observed with herschel. we perform aresolved sed modelling of these objects using the draine and li (2007) dustmodels and investigate the influence of the addition of spire measurements inthe estimation of ltir. we find that using data up to 250 um leads to localltir values consistent with those obtained with a complete coverage (up to 500um) within 10 per cent for most of our resolved elements. we then study thedistribution of energy in the resolved seds of our galaxies. the bulk of energy(30-50 per cent) is contained in the (70-160 um) band. the (24-70 um) fractiondecreases with increasing metallicity. the (160-1100 um) submillimeter band canaccount for up to 25 per cent of the ltir in metal-rich galaxies. weinvestigate the correlation between tir surface brightnesses/luminosities andmonochromatic spitzer and herschel surface brightnesses/luminosities. the threepacs bands can be used as reliable monochromatic estimators of the ltir, the100 um band being the most reliable monochromatic tracer. there is also astrong correlation between the spire 250um and ltir, although with more scatterthan for the pacs relations. we also study the ability of our monochromaticrelations to reproduce integrated ltir of nearby galaxies as well as ltir ofz=1-3 sources. finally, we provide calibration coefficients that can be used toderive tir surface brightnesses/luminosities from a combination of spitzer andherschel surface brightnesses/fluxes and analyse the associated uncertainties.

1305.2923	mapping dust through emission and absorption in nearby galaxies	dust has long been identified as a barrier to measuring inherent galaxyproperties. however, the link between dust and attenuation is notstraightforward and depends on both the amount of dust and its distribution.herschel imaging of nearby galaxies undertaken as part of the kingfish projectallows us to map the dust as seen in emission with unprecedented sensitivityand ~1 kpc resolution. we present here new optical integral field unitspectroscopy for eight of these galaxies that provides complementary 100-200 pcscale maps of the dust attenuation through observation of the reddening in boththe balmer decrement and the stellar continuum. the stellar continuumreddening, which is systematically less than that observed in the balmerdecrement, shows no clear correlation with the dust, suggesting that thedistribution of stellar reddening acts as a poor tracer of the overall dustcontent. the brightest hii regions are observed to be preferentially located industy regions, and we do find a correlation between the balmer line reddeningand the dust mass surface density for which we provide an empirical relation.some of the high-inclination systems in our sample exhibit high extinction, butwe also find evidence that unresolved variations in the dust distribution onscales smaller than 500 pc may contribute to the scatter in this relation. wecaution against the use of integrated a_v measures to infer global dustproperties.

0801.2933	structure and evolution of the opacity of spiral disks	the opacity of a spiral disk due to dust absorption influences everymeasurement we make of it in the uv and optical. two separate techniquesdirectly measure the total absorption by dust in the disk: calibrated distantgalaxy counts and overlapping galaxy pairs. the main results from both so farare a semi-transparent disk with more opaque arms, and a relation betweensurface brightness and disk opacity. in the spitzer era, sed models of spiraldisks add a new perspective on the role of dust in spiral disks. combined withthe overall opacity from galaxy counts, they yield a typical optical depth ofthe dusty ism clouds: 0.4 that implies a size of $\sim$ 60 pc. work on galaxycounts is currently ongoing on the acs fields of m51, m101 and m81. occultinggalaxies offer the possibility of probing the history of disk opacity fromhigher redshift pairs. evolution in disk opacity could influence distancemeasurements (sn1a, tully-fisher relation). here, we present first results fromspectroscopically selected occulting pairs in the sdss. the redshift range forthis sample is limited, but does offer a first insight into disk opacityevolution as well as a reference for higher redshift measurements. spiral diskopacity has not undergone significant evolution since z=0.2. hst imaging wouldhelp disentangle the effects of spiral arms in these pairs. many moremixed-morphology types are being identified in sdss by the galaxyzoo project.the occulting galaxy technique can be pushed to a redshift of 1 using manypairs identified in the imaging campaigns with hst (deep2, gems, goods,cosmos).

1309.0817	towards a removal of temperature dependencies from abundance  determinations	the metal content of a galaxy is a key property for distinguishing betweenviable galaxy evolutionary scenarios, and it strongly influences many of thephysical processes in the interstellar medium. an absolute and robustdetermination of extragalactic metallicities is essential in constrainingmodels of chemical enrichment and chemical evolution, however, current gasphase abundance determinations from optical fine-structure lines are uncertainto 0.8 dex as conversion of these optical line fluxes to abundances is stronglydependent on the electron temperature of the ionized gas. in contrast, thefar-ir emission lines can be used to derive an o++ abundance that is relativelyinsensitive to temperature, while the ratio of the optical to far-ir linesprovides a consistent temperature to be used in the derivation of an o$^+$abundance. we present observations of the [o iii] 88 \micron\ fine-structureline in ngc 628 that were obtained as part of the kingfish program. these dataare combined with optical ifu data to derive oxygen abundances for seven hiiregions. we find the abundance of these regions to all lie between the high andlow values of strong line calibrations and in agreement with estimates thatassume temperature fluctuations are present in the hii regions.

1401.3693	dissecting the origin of the submillimeter emission in nearby galaxies  with herschel and laboca	we model the infrared to submillimeter spectral energy distribution of 11nearby galaxies of the kingfish sample using spitzer and herschel data andcompare model extrapolations at 870um (using different fitting techniques) withlaboca 870um observations. we investigate how the differences betweenpredictions and observations vary with model assumptions or environment. atglobal scales, we find that modified blackbody models using realistic coldemissivity indices (beta_c=2 or 1.5) are able to reproduce the 870um observedemission within the uncertainties for most of the sample. low values(beta_c&lt;1.3) would be required in ngc0337, ngc1512 and ngc7793. at localscales, we observe a systematic 870um excess when using beta_=2.0. thebeta_c=1.5 or the draine and li (2007) models can reconcile predictions withobservations in part of the disks. some of the remaining excesses occur towardsthe centres and can be partly or fully accounted for by non-dust contributionssuch as co(3-2) or, to a lesser extent, free-free or synchrotron emission. inthree non-barred galaxies, the remaining excesses rather occur in the diskoutskirts. this could be a sign of a flattening of the submm slope (anddecrease of the effective emissivity index) with radius in these objects.

1402.4668	the heating of mid-infrared dust in the nearby galaxy m33: a testbed for  tracing galaxy evolution	because the 8 {\mu}m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) emission has beenfound to correlate with other well-known star formation tracers, it has widelybeen used as a star formation rate (sfr) tracer. there are, however, studiesthat challenge the accuracy and reliability of the 8 {\mu}m emission as a sfrtracer. our study, part of the herschel m33 extended survey (herm33es) opentime key program, aims at addressing this issue by analyzing the infraredemission from the nearby spiral galaxy m33 at the high spatial scale of 75 pc.combining data from the herschel space observatory and the spitzer spacetelescope we find that the 8 {\mu}m emission is better correlated with the 250{\mu}m emission, which traces cold interstellar gas, than with the 24 {\mu}memission. the l(8)/l(24) ratio is highly depressed in 24 {\mu}m luminousregions, which correlate with known hii regions. we also compare our resultswith the dust emission models by draine &amp; li (2007). we confirm that thedepression of 8 {\mu}m pah emission near star-forming regions is higher thanwhat is predicted by models; this is possibly an effect of increased stellarradiation from young stars destroying the dust grains responsible for the 8{\mu}m emission as already suggested by other authors. we find that themajority of the 8 {\mu}m emission is fully consistent with heating by thediffuse interstellar medium, similar to what recently determined for the dustemission in m31 by draine at al.

1407.4547	big fish in small ponds: massive stars in the low mass clusters of m83	we have used multi-wavelength hubble space telescope wfc3 data of thestarbursting spiral galaxy m83 in order to measure variations in the upper endof the stellar initial mass function (uimf) using the production rate ofionizing photons in unresolved clusters with ages $\leq$ 8 myr. as in earlierpapers on m51 and ngc 4214, the upper end of the stellar imf in m83 isconsistent with an universal imf, and stochastic sampling of the stellarpopulations in the $\lessapprox$ 10$^{3}$ msun clusters are responsible for anydeviations in this universality. the ensemble cluster population, as well asindividual clusters, also imply that the most massive star in a cluster doesnot depend on the cluster mass. in fact, we have found that these smallclusters seem to have an over-abundance of ionizing photons when compared to anexpected universal or truncated imf. this also suggests that the presence ofmassive stars in these clusters does not affect the star formation in adestructive way.

1409.5916	cool dust heating and temperature mixing in nearby star-forming galaxies	physical conditions of the interstellar medium in galaxies are closely linkedto the ambient radiation field and the heating of dust grains. in order tocharacterize dust properties in galaxies over a wide range of physicalconditions, we present here the radial surface brightness profiles of theentire sample of 61 galaxies from key insights into nearby galaxies:far-infrared survey with herschel (kingfish). the main goal of our work is thecharacterization of the grain emissivities, dust temperatures, and interstellarradiation fields responsible for heating the dust. after fitting the dust andstellar radial profiles with exponential functions, we fit the far-infraredspectral energy distribution (sed) in each annular region withsingle-temperature modified black bodies using both variable (mbbv) and fixed(mbbf) emissivity indices beta, as well as with physically motivated dustmodels. results show that while most sed parameters decrease with radius, theemissivity index beta also decreases with radius in some galaxies, but inothers is increasing, or rising in the inner regions and falling in the outerones. despite the fixed grain emissivity (average beta~ 2.1) of thephysically-motivated models, they are well able to accommodate flat spectralslopes with beta&lt;= 1. we find that flatter slopes (beta&lt;= 1.5) are associatedwith cooler temperatures, contrary to what would be expected from the usualtdust-beta degeneracy. this trend is related to variations in umin since betaand umin are very closely linked over the entire range in umin sampled by thekingfish galaxies: low umin is associated with flat beta&lt;=1. both these resultsstrongly suggest that the low apparent \beta values (flat slopes) in mbbv fitsare caused by temperature mixing along the line-of-sight, rather than byintrinsic variations in grain properties. abstract truncated for arxiv.

1409.7123	[cii] 158 $\mu$m emission as a star formation tracer	the [cii] 157.74 $\mu$m transition is the dominant coolant of the neutralinterstellar gas, and has great potential as a star formation rate (sfr)tracer. using the herschel kingfish sample of 46 nearby galaxies, weinvestigate the relation of [cii] surface brightness and luminosity with sfr.we conclude that [cii] can be used for measurements of sfr on both global andkiloparsec scales in normal star-forming galaxies in the absence of strongactive galactic nuclei (agn). the uncertainty of the $\sigma_{\rm[cii]}-\sigma_{\rm sfr}$ calibration is $\pm$0.21 dex. the main source ofscatter in the correlation is associated with regions that exhibit warm ircolors, and we provide an adjustment based on ir color that reduces thescatter. we show that the color-adjusted $\sigma_{\rm[cii]}-\sigma_{\rm sfr}$correlation is valid over almost 5 orders of magnitude in $\sigma_{\rm sfr}$,holding for both normal star-forming galaxies and non-agn luminous infraredgalaxies. using [cii] luminosity instead of surface brightness to estimate sfrsuffers from worse systematics, frequently underpredicting sfr in luminousinfrared galaxies even after ir color adjustment (although this depends on thesfr measure employed). we suspect that surface brightness relations are betterbehaved than the luminosity relations because the former are more closelyrelated to the local far-uv field strength, most likely the main parametercontrolling the efficiency of the conversion of far-uv radiation into gasheating. a simple model based on starburst99 population-synthesis code toconnect sfr to [cii] finds that heating efficiencies are $1\%-3\%$ in normalgalaxies.

1410.7456	legacy extragalactic uv survey (legus) with the hubble space telescope.  i. survey description	the legacy extragalactic uv survey (legus) is a cycle 21 treasury program onthe hubble space telescope, aimed at the investigation of star formation andits relation with galactic environment in nearby galaxies, from the scales ofindividual stars to those of ~kpc-size clustered structures. five-band imaging,from the near-ultraviolet to the i-band, with the wide field camera 3, plusparallel optical imaging with the advanced camera for surveys, is beingcollected for selected pointings of 50 galaxies within the local 12 mpc. thefilters used for the observations with the wide field camera 3 are: f275w(2,704a), f336w(3,355 a), f438w(4,325 a), f555w(5,308 a), and f814w(8,024 a); theparallel observations with the advanced camera for surveys use the filters:f435w(4,328 a), f606w(5,921 a), and f814w(8,057 a). the multi-band images areyielding accurate recent (&lt;~50 myr) star formation histories from resolvedmassive stars and the extinction-corrected ages and masses of star clusters andassociations. the extensive inventories of massive stars and clustered systemswill be used to investigate the spatial and temporal evolution of starformation within galaxies. this will, in turn, inform theories of galaxyevolution and improve the understanding of the physical underpinning of thegas-star formation relation and the nature of star formation at high redshift.this paper describes the survey, its goals and observational strategy, and theinitial science results. because legus will provide a reference survey and afoundation for future observations with jwst and with alma, a large number ofdata products are planned for delivery to the community.

1501.07279	heating and cooling of the neutral ism in the ngc4736 circumnuclear ring	the manner in which gas accretes and orbits within circumnuclear rings hasdirect implications for the star formation process. in particular, gas may becompressed and shocked at the inflow points, resulting in bursts of starformation at these locations. afterwards the gas and young stars move togetherthrough the ring. in addition, star formation may occur throughout the ring, ifand when the gas reaches sufficient density to collapse under gravity. thesetwo scenarios for star formation in rings are often referred to as the `pearlson a string' and `popcorn' paradigms. in this paper, we use new herschel pacsobservations, obtained as part of the kingfish open time key program, alongwith archival spitzer and ground-based observations from the sings legacyproject, to investigate the heating and cooling of the interstellar medium inthe nearby star-forming ring galaxy, ngc4736. by comparing spatially resolvedestimates of the stellar fuv flux available for heating, with the gas and dustcooling derived from the fir continuum and line emission, we show that whilestar formation is indeed dominant at the inflow points in ngc 4736, additionalstar formation is needed to balance the gas heating and cooling throughout thering. this additional component most likely arises from the general increase ingas density in the ring over its lifetime. our data provide strong evidence,therefore, for a combination of the two paradigms for star formation in thering in ngc4736.

1508.04476	the brightest young star clusters in ngc 5253	the nearby dwarf starburst galaxy ngc5253 hosts a number of young, massivestar clusters, the two youngest of which are centrally concentrated andsurrounded by thermal radio emission (the `radio nebula'). to investigate therole of these clusters in the starburst energetics, we combine new and archivalhubble space telescope images of ngc5253 with wavelength coverage from 1500 angto 1.9 micron in 13 filters. these include h-alpha, p-beta, and p-alpha, andthe imaging from the hubble treasury program legus (legacy extragalactic uvsurvey). the extraordinarily well-sampled spectral energy distributions enablemodeling with unprecedented accuracy the ages, masses, and extinctions of the 9optically brightest clusters (m_v &lt; -8.8) and the two young radio nebulaclusters. the clusters have ages ~1-15 myr and masses ~1x10^4 - 2.5x10^5 m_sun.the clusters' spatial location and ages indicate that star formation has becomemore concentrated towards the radio nebula over the last ~15 myr. the mostmassive cluster is in the radio nebula; with a mass 2.5x10^5 m_sun and an age~1 myr, it is 2-4 times less massive and younger than previously estimated. itis within a dust cloud with a_v~50 mag, and shows a clear nearir excess, likelyfrom hot dust. the second radio nebula cluster is also ~1 myr old, confirmingthe extreme youth of the starburst region. these two clusters account for abouthalf of the ionizing photon rate in the radio nebula, and will eventuallysupply about 2/3 of the mechanical energy in present-day shocks. additionalsources are required to supply the remaining ionizing radiation, and mayinclude very massive stars.

1511.02233	the spatial distribution of the young stellar clusters in the star  forming galaxy ngc 628	we present a study of the spatial distribution of the stellar clusterpopulations in the star forming galaxy ngc 628. using hubble space telescopebroad band wfc3/uvis uv and optical images from the treasury program legus(legacy extragalactic uv survey), we have identified 1392 potential young (&lt;100myr) stellar clusters within the galaxy, identified from a combination ofvisual inspection and automatic selection. we investigate the clustering ofthese young stellar clusters and quantify the strength and change of clusteringstrength with scale using the two-point correlation function. we alsoinvestigate how image boundary conditions and dust lanes affect the observedclustering. the distribution of the clusters is well fit by a broken power lawwith negative exponent $\alpha$. we recover a weighted mean index of $\alpha$ ~-0.8 for all spatial scales below the break at 3".3 (158 pc at a distance of9.9 mpc) and an index of $\alpha$ ~ -0.18 above 158 pc for the accumulation ofall cluster types. the strength of the clustering increases with decreasing ageand clusters older than 40 myr lose their clustered structure very rapidly andtend to be randomly distributed in this galaxy whereas the mass of the starcluster has little effect on the clustering strength. this is consistent withresults from other studies that the morphological hierarchy in stellarclustering resembles the same hierarchy as the turbulent interstellar medium.

0705.3377	the calibration of mid-infrared star formation rate indicators	with the goal of investigating the degree to which the mid-infrared emissiontraces the star formation rate (sfr), we analyze spitzer 8 um and 24 um data ofstar-forming regions in a sample of 33 nearby galaxies with availablehst/nicmos images in the paschen-alpha (1.8756 um) emission line. the galaxiesare drawn from the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings) sample, andcover a range of morphologies and a factor ~10 in oxygen abundance. publisheddata on local low-metallicity starburst galaxies and luminous infrared galaxiesare also included in the analysis. both the stellar-continuum-subtracted 8 umemission and the 24 um emission correlate with the extinction-correctedpa-alpha line emission, although neither relationship is linear. simple modelsof stellar populations and dust extinction and emission are able to reproducethe observed non-linear trend of the 24 um emission versus number of ionizingphotons, including the modest deficiency of 24 um emission in the lowmetallicity regions, which results from a combination of decreasing dustopacity and dust temperature at low luminosities. conversely, the trend of the8 um emission as a function of the number of ionizing photons is not wellreproduced by the same models. the 8 um emission is contributed, in largermeasure than the 24 um emission, by dust heated by non-ionizing stellarpopulations, in agreement with previous findings. two sfr calibrations, oneusing the 24 um emission and the other using a combination of the 24 um andh-alpha luminosities (kennicutt et al. 2007), are presented. no calibration ispresented for the 8 um emission, because of its significant dependence on bothmetallicity and environment. the calibrations presented here should be directlyapplicable to systems dominated by on-going star formation.

astro-ph;0102283	fuse observations of outflowing ovi in the dwarf starburst galaxy  ngc1705	we report fuse far-uv spectroscopy of the prototypical dwarf starburst galaxyngc 1705. these data allow us for the first time to probe the coronal-phase gas(t = 10e5 to 10e6 k) that may dominate the radiative cooling of thesupernova-heated ism and thereby determine the dynamical evolution ofstarburst-driven outflows. we detect a broad (100 km/s) and blueshifted (by 80km/s) ovi absorption-line arising in the previously-known galactic outflow. theproperties of the ovi absorption are inconsistent with the standard superbubblemodel in which this gas arises in a conductive interface inside the outershell. we show that the superbubble in ngc 1705 is blowing out of the galaxyism. during blow-out, coronal-phase gas can be created by hydrodynamical mixingas hot gas rushes out through fissures in the fragmenting shell of cool gas. asthe coronal gas cools radiatively, it can naturally produce the observed ovicolumn density and outflow speed. the ovi data show that the cooling rate inthe coronal-phase gas is less than about 10% of the supernova heating rate.since the x-ray luminosity from hotter gas is even smaller, we conclude thatradiative losses are insignificant. the outflow should be able to vent itsmetals and kinetic energy out of the galaxy. this process has potentiallyimportant implications for the evolution of dwarf galaxies and the igm.

astro-ph;0105012	on the escape of ionizing radiation from starbursts	far-ultraviolet spectra obtained with $fuse$ show that the strong$cii\lambda$1036 interstellar absorption-line is essentially black in five ofthe uv-brightest local starburst galaxies. since the opacity of the neutral ismbelow the lyman-edge will be significantly larger than in the $cii$ line, thesedata provide strong constraints on the escape of ionizing radiation from thesestarbursts. interpreted as a a uniform absorbing slab, the implied opticaldepth at the lyman edge is huge ($\tau_0 \geq 10^2$). alternatively, the arealcovering factor of opaque material is typically $\geq$ 94%. thus, the fractionof ionizing stellar photons that escape the ism of each galaxy is small: ourconservative estimates typically yield $f_{esc} \leq 6%$. inclusion ofextinction due to dust will further decrease $f_{esc}$. an analogous analysisof the rest-uv spectrum of the star-forming galaxy $ms 1512-cb58$ at $z$ =2.7leads to similar constraints on $f_{esc}$. these new results agree with theconstraints provided by direct observations below the lyman edge in a few otherlocal starbursts. however, they differ from the recently reported properties ofstar-forming galaxies at $z \geq$ 3. we assess the idea that the stronggalactic winds seen in many powerful starbursts clear channels through theirneutral ism. we show empirically that such outflows may be a necessary - butnot sufficient - part of the process for creating a relatively porous ism. wenote that observations will soon document the cosmic evolution in thecontribution of star-forming galaxies to the metagalactic ionizing background,with important implications for the evolution of the igm.

astro-ph;0602064	ultraviolet-to-far-infrared properties of local star-forming galaxies	we present the results of a multiwavelength study of nearby galaxies, aimedat understanding the relation between the ultraviolet and far-infrared emissionin star-forming galaxies. the dataset comprises new ultraviolet (fromhst/stis), ground-based halpha, and radio continuum observations, together witharchival infrared data (from iras and iso). the local galaxies are used asbenchmarks for comparison of the infrared-to-ultraviolet properties with twopopulations of high-redshift galaxies: the sub-millimeter star-forming galaxiesdetected by scuba and the ultraviolet-selected lyman break galaxies. inaddition, the long wavelength baseline covered by the present data enables usto compare the star formation rates (sfrs) derived from the observedultraviolet, halpha, infrared, and radio luminosities, and to gauge the impactof dust opacity in the local galaxies. we also derive a new calibration for thenon-thermal part of the radio sfr estimator, based on the comparison of 1.4 ghzmeasurements with a new estimator of the bolometric luminosity of the starforming regions. we find that more actively star forming galaxies show higherdust opacities, in line with previous results. we find that the localstar-forming galaxies have lower f(205um)/f(uv) ratio, by two-three orders ofmagnitude than the submillimeter-selected galaxies, and may have similar orsomewhat higher f(205um)/f(uv) than lyman break galaxies. the f(205um)/f(uv)ratio of the local galaxy population may be influenced by the cool dustemission in the far-infrared heated by non-ionizing stellar populations, whichmay be reduced or absent in the lbgs.

astro-ph;0603395	dust in spiral disks: opacity profiles from fir emission and counts of  distant galaxies	dust emission in the far-infrared (fir) characterizes the temperature andquantity of interstellar dust in a spiral disk. the three spitzer/mips bandsare well suited to measuring the gradient in temperature and the total opticaldepth in the disk of a spiral galaxy. another way to estimate the quantity ofdust in a spiral disk is the "synthetic field method" (sfm, gonzalez et al.1998), which uses the number of distant field galaxies seen through the disk ofthe nearby spiral. the optical depth estimated from this method can be comparedto the values derived from the fir emission. since the two techniques depend ondifferent assumptions regarding the dust geometry and emissivity, thiscomparison between the optical depth profiles can potentially shed light on thestructure and quantity of the ism in spiral disks, especially any coldercomponents. the dust responsible for the opacity from distant galaxy countsappears to be predominantly cold (t &lt; 20 k.). the differences between theradial absorption profiles can be explained by spiral arms in the sfmmeasurements. taken over the same aperture, galaxy counts show higherextinction values than the fir derived ones. the implications for dust geometrycan hopefully be explored with a more rigorous estimate of dust mass from thefir fluxes.

astro-ph;0604007	mid-infrared spectral diagnostics of nuclear and extra-nuclear regions  in nearby galaxies	mid-infrared diagnostics are presented for a large portion of the spitzerinfrared nearby galaxies survey (sings) sample plus archival data from theinfrared space observatory and the spitzer space telescope. our main result isthat these mid-infrared diagnostics effectively constrain a target's dominantpower source. the combination of a high ionization line index and pah strengthserves as an efficient discriminant between agn and star-forming nuclei,confirming progress made with iso spectroscopy on starbursting andultraluminous infrared galaxies. the sensitivity of spitzer allows us to probefainter nuclei and star-forming regions within galaxy disks. we find that bothstar-forming nuclei and extranuclear regions stand apart from nuclei that arepowered by seyfert or liner activity. in fact, we identify areas within fourdiagnostic diagrams containing &gt;90% seyfert/liner nuclei or &gt;90% hiiregions/hii nuclei. we also find that, compared to starbursting nuclei,extranuclear regions typically separate even further from agn, especially forlow-metallicity extranuclear environments. in addition, instead of thetraditional mid-infrared approach to differentiating between agn andstar-forming sources that utilizes relatively weak high-ionization lines, weshow that strong low-ionization cooling lines of x-ray dominated regions like[siii] 34.82 micron can alternatively be used as excellent discrimants.finally, the typical target in this sample shows relatively modest interstellarelectron density (~400 cm^{-3}) and obscuration (a_v ~ 1.0 mag for a foregroundscreen), consistent with a lack of dense clumps of highly obscured gas and dustresiding in the emitting regions.

astro-ph;0609724	the effect of star formation on the far-infrared--radio correlation  within galaxies	using data obtained for twelve galaxies as part of the {\it spitzer} infrarednearby galaxies survey (sings) and the westerbork synthesis radio telescope(wsrt)-sings radio continuum survey, we study how star formation activityaffects the far-infrared (fir)--radio correlation {\it within} galaxies bytesting a phenomenological model, which describes the radio image as a smearedversion of the fir image. the physical basis of this description is thatcosmic-ray (cr) electrons will diffuse measurably farther than the mean freepath of dust-heating photons before decaying by synchrotron radiation. thisdescription works well in general. galaxies with higher infrared surfacebrightnesses have best-fit smoothing scale-lengths of a few hundred parsecs,substantially shorter than those for lower surface brightness galaxies. weinterpret this result to suggest that galaxies with higher disk averaged starformation rates have had a recent episode of enhanced star formation and arecharacterized by a higher fraction of young cr electrons that have traveledonly a few hundred parsecs from their acceleration sites in supernova remnantscompared to galaxies with lower star formation activity.

astro-ph;0610688	an ultraviolet-to-radio broadband spectral atlas of nearby galaxies	the ultraviolet-to-radio continuum spectral energy distributions arepresented for all 75 galaxies in the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey(sings). a principal component analysis of the sample shows that most of thesample's spectral variations stem from two underlying components, onerepresentative of a galaxy with a low infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio and onerepresentative of a galaxy with a high infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio. theinfluence of several parameters on the infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio is studied(e.g., optical morphology, disk inclination, far-infrared color, ultravioletspectral slope, and star formation history). consistent with our understandingof normal star-forming galaxies, the sings sample of galaxies in comparison tomore actively star-forming galaxies exhibits a larger dispersion in theinfrared-to-ultraviolet versus ultraviolet spectral slope correlation. earlytype galaxies, exhibiting low star formation rates and high optical surfacebrightnesses, have the most discrepant infrared-to-ultraviolet correlation.these results suggest that the star formation history may be the dominantregulator of the broadband spectral variations between galaxies. finally, a newdiscovery shows that the 24 micron morphology can be a useful tool forparametrizing the global dust temperature and ultraviolet extinction in nearbygalaxies. the dust emission in dwarf/irregular galaxies is clumpy and warmaccompanied by low ultraviolet extinction, while in spiral galaxies there istypically a much larger diffuse component of cooler dust and averageultraviolet extinction. for galaxies with nuclear 24 micron emission, the dusttemperature and ultraviolet extinction are relatively high compared to diskgalaxies.

astro-ph;0702378	dust and atomic gas in dwarf irregular galaxies of the m81 group: the  sings and things view	[abridged] we present observations of the dust and atomic gas phase in sevendwarf irregular galaxies of the m81 group from the sings and things surveys.the spitzer observations provide a first glimpse of the nature of thenon-atomic ism in these metal-poor (z~0.1 z_sun), quiescent (sfr~0.001-0.1m_sun/yr) dwarf galaxies. dust emission is detected in five out of the seventargets. most detected dust emission is restricted to hi column densities&gt;1x10^21 cm^-2. spitzer spectroscopy of two regions in the brightest galaxies(ic 2574 and holmberg ii) show distinctly different spectral shapes. thespectrum of ic 2574 shows aromatic features that are less luminous (relative tothe fir luminosity) compared to an average sings spiral galaxy by a factor of\~7 . the aromatic features in holmberg~ii (which has only a slightly lowergas-phase metallicity) are fainter than in ic 2574 by an order of magnitude.this result emphazises that the strength of the aromatic features is not asimple linear function of metallicity. we estimate dust masses of ~10^4-10^6m_sun for the m81 dwarf galaxies, resulting in an average dust--to--gas ratio(m_dust/m_hi) of ~3x10^-4 (1.5x10^-3 if only the hi that is associated withdust emission is considered); this is an order of magnitude lower than thetypical value derived for the sings spirals. the dwarf galaxies areunderluminous per unit star formation rate at 70um as compared to the moremassive galaxies in sings by a factor of ~2. however, the average 70um/160umratio in the sample dwarf galaxies is higher than what is found in the othergalaxies of the sings sample. this can be explained by a combination of a lowerdust content in conjunction with a higher dust temperature in the dwarfs.

astro-ph;9705043	dust in starburst galaxies	to investigate the nature of starbursts' dust, we constructed a model of thestars and dust in starburst galaxies and applied it to 30 observed starburstspectral energy distributions (seds). the starburst model was constructed bycombining two stellar evolutionary synthesis models with a model describing theradiative transfer of stellar photons through dust. the stellar evolutionarysynthesis models were used to compute the dust-free seds for stellarpopulations with ages between 1x10^6 and 15x10^9 years. using a monte carloradiative transfer model, the effects of dust were computed for average milkyway (mw) and small magellanic cloud (smc) dust, two different star/dustgeometries, and locally homogeneous or clumpy dust. using color-color plots,the starburst model was used to interpret the behavior of 30 starbursts withaperture-matched uv and optical seds (and ir for 19 of the 30) from previousstudies. from the color-color plots, it was evident that the dust in starburstshas an extinction curve lacking a 2175 a bump, like the smc curve, and a steepfar-uv rise, intermediate between the mw and smc curves. the star/dust geometrywhich is able to explain the distribution of the 30 starbursts in variouscolor-color plots has an inner dust-free sphere of stars surrounded by an outerstar-free shell of clumpy dust. when combined with other work from theliterature on the orion region and the 30 dor region of the large magellaniccloud, this work implies a trend in dust properties with star formationintensity.

0811.4190	the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey: a high-resolution  spectroscopy anthology	high resolution mid-infrared spectra are presented for 155 nuclear andextranuclear regions from the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings).the fluxes for nine atomic forbidden and three molecular hydrogen mid-infraredemission lines are also provided, along with upper limits in key lines forinfrared-faint targets. the sings sample shows a wide range in the ratio of[siii]18.71um/[siii]33.48um, but the average ratio of the ensemble indicates atypical interstellar electron density of 300-400 cm^{-3} on ~23"x15" scales and500-600 cm^{-3} using ~11"x9" apertures, independent of whether the regionprobed is a star-forming nuclear, a star-forming extranuclear, or an agnenvironment. evidence is provided that variations in gas-phase metallicity playan important role in driving variations in radiation field hardness, asindicated by [neiii]15.56um/[neii]12.81um, for regions powered by starformation. conversely, the radiation hardness for galaxy nuclei powered byaccretion around a massive black hole is independent of metal abundance.furthermore, for metal-rich environments agn are distinguishable fromstar-forming regions by significantly larger [neiii]15.56um/[neii]12.81umratios. finally, [feii]25.99um/[neii]12.81um versus [siii]34.82um/[siii]33.48umalso provides an empirical method for discerning agn from normal star-formingsources. however, similar to [neiii]15.56um/[neii]12.81um, these mid-infraredline ratios lose their agn/star-formation diagnostic powers for very lowmetallicity star-forming systems with hard radiation fields.
