0706.3624	absorption line-strengths of 18 late-type spiral galaxies observed with  sauron	we present absorption line-strength maps for a sample of 18 sb-sd galaxiesobserved using the integral-field spectrograph sauron. the sauron spectralrange allows the measurement of the lick/ids indices hbeta, fe5015 and mgb,which can be used to estimate the stellar population parameters. we presenthere the two-dimensional line-strength maps for each galaxy. from the maps, welearn that late-type spiral galaxies tend to have high hbeta and low fe5015 andmgb values, and that the hbeta index has often a positive gradient over thefield, while the metal indices peak in the central region. we investigate therelations between the central line-strength indices and their correlations withmorphological type and central velocity dispersion, and compare the observedbehaviour with that for ellipticals, lenticulars and early-type spirals fromthe sauron survey. we find that our galaxies lie below the mg - sigma relationdetermined for elliptical galaxies and that the indices show a clear trend withmorphological type. from the line-strength maps we calculate age, metallicityand abundance ratio maps and discuss the results from a one-ssp approach andfrom a two-ssp approach. late-type galaxies are generally younger and moremetal poor than ellipticals and have abundance ratios closer to solar values.we also explore a continuous star formation scenario, and try to recover thestar formation history using the evolutionary models of bruzual &amp; charlot(2003), assuming constant or exponentially declining star formation rate (sfr).we find a correlation between the e-folding time-scale tau of the starburst andthe central velocity dispersion: more massive galaxies tend to have shortertau, suggesting that the star formation happened long ago and has now basicallyended, while for smaller objects with larger values of tau it is still active.

0906.3318	the sauron project - xiii. sauron-galex study of early-type galaxies:  the ultraviolet colour-magnitude relations and fundamental planes	we present galex far (fuv) and near (nuv) ultraviolet imaging of 34 nearbyearly-type galaxies from the sauron representative sample of 48 e/s0 galaxies,all of which have ground-based optical imaging from the mdm observatory. thesurface brightness profiles of nine galaxies show regions with blue uv-opticalcolours suggesting recent star formation. five of these show blue integrateduv-optical colours that set them aside in the nuv integrated colour-magnituderelation. they also have other properties confirming they have had recent starformation, in particular h_beta absorption higher than expected for a quiescentpopulation and a higher co detection rate. nuv-blue galaxies are generallydrawn from the lower stellar velocity dispersion and thus lower dynamical masspart of the sample. we have also constructed the first uv fundamental planesand show that nuv blue galaxies bias the slopes and increase the scatters. ifthey are eliminated the fits get closer to expectations from the virialtheorem. although our analysis is based on a limited sample, it seems that adominant fraction of the tilt and scatter of the uv fundamental planes is dueto the presence of young stars in preferentially low-mass early-type galaxies.interestingly, the uv-optical radial colour profiles reveal a variety ofbehaviours, with many galaxies showing signs of recent star formation, acentral uv-upturn phenomenon, smooth but large-scale age and metallicitygradients, and in many cases a combination of these. in addition, fuv-nuv andfuv-v colours even bluer than those normally associated with uv-upturn galaxiesare observed at the centre of some quiescent galaxies. four out of the fiveuv-upturn galaxies are slow rotators. these objects should thus poseinteresting challenges to stellar evolutionary models of the uv-upturn.

0906.3321	the sauron project - xiv. no escape from v$_{\mathrm{esc}}$: a global  and local parameter in early-type galaxy evolution	we present the results of an investigation of the local escape velocity(vesc) - line strength index relationship for 48 early type galaxies from thesauron sample, the first such study based on a large sample of galaxies withboth detailed integral field observations and extensive dynamical modelling.values of vesc are computed using multi gaussian expansion (mge) photometricfitting and axisymmetric, anisotropic jeans' dynamical modelling simultaneouslyon hst and ground-based images. we determine line strengths and escapevelocities at multiple radii within each galaxy, allowing an investigation ofthe correlation within individual galaxies as well as amongst galaxies. we finda tight correlation between vesc and the line-strength indices. for mgb we findthat this correlation exists not only between different galaxies but alsoinside individual galaxies - it is both a local and global correlation. therelation within individual galaxies has the same slope and offset as the globalrelation to a good level of agreement, though there is significant intrinsicscatter in the local gradients. we transform our line strength indexmeasurements to the single stellar population (ssp) equivalent age (t),metallicity ([z/h]) and enhancement ([$\alpha$/fe]) and carry out a principalcomponent analysis of our ssp and vesc data. we find that in thisfour-dimensional parameter space the galaxies in our sample are to a goodapproximation confined to a plane, given by $\log\mathrm({v}_{\mathrm{esc}}/500\mathrm{km/s}) = 0.85 \mathrm{[z/h]} + 0.43 \log(\mathrm{t}/\mathrm{gyrs})$ - 0.20. it is surprising that it is a combinationof age and metallicity that is conserved; this may indicate a 'conspiracy'between age and metallicity or a weakness in the ssp models.

0912.0275	the sauron project xvi: on the sources of ionisation for the gas in  elliptical and lenticular galaxies	following our study on the incidence, morphology and kinematics of theionised gas in early-type galaxies we now address the question of what ispowering the observed nebular emission. to constrain the likely sources of gasexcitation, we resort to a variety of ancillary data, draw from complementaryinformation on the gas kinematics, stellar populations and galactic potentialfrom the sauron data, and use the sauron-specific diagnostic diagramjuxtaposing the [oiii]/hb and [ni]/hb line ratios. we find a tight correlationbetween the stellar surface brightness and the flux of the hb recombinationline across our sample, which points to a diffuse and old stellar source as themain contributor of ionising photons in early-type galaxies, withpost-asymptotic giant branch (pagb) stars being still the best candidate basedon ionising-balance arguments. other ionising sources such as a central agn,ob-stars, shocks or the interaction between the hot and warm phases of theinterestellar medium are found to play only a limited or localised role inpowering the diffuse nebular emission observed in our sample galaxies. theseresults lead us to investigate the relative importance of stellar and agnphotoionisation in explaining the ionised-gas emission observed in early-typegalaxies by the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). by simulating how our samplegalaxies would appear if placed at further distance and targeted by the sdss,we conclude that only in very few, if any, of the sdss early-type galaxies thatdisplay modest values for the equivalent width of the [oiii] line (less than~2.4\aa) and liner-like [oiii]/hb values, the nebular emission is truly poweredby an agn.

1006.1574	the sauron project - xvii. stellar population analysis of the absorption  line strength maps of 48 early-type galaxies	(abridged) we present a stellar population analysis of the absorption linestrength maps for 48 early-type galaxies from the sauron sample. using the linestrength index maps of hbeta, fe5015, and mgb, measured in the lick/ids systemand spatially binned to a constant signal-to-noise, together with predictionsfrom up-to-date stellar population models, we estimate the simple stellarpopulation-equivalent (ssp-equivalent) age, metallicity and abundance ratio[alpha/fe] over a two-dimensional field extending up to approximately oneeffective radius. we find a large range of ssp-equivalent ages in our sample,of which ~40% of the galaxies show signs of a contribution from a young stellarpopulation. the most extreme cases of post-starburst galaxies, withssp-equivalent ages of &lt;=3 gyr observed over the full field-of-view, andsometimes even showing signs of residual star-formation, are restricted to lowmass systems(sigma_e &lt;= 100 k/ms or ~2x10^10 m_sol). spatially restricted casesof young stellar populations in circumnuclear regions can almost exclusively belinked to the presence of star-formation in a thin, dusty disk/ring, also seenin the near-uv or mid-ir. the flattened components with disk-like kinematicspreviously identified in all fast rotators (krajnovi\'c et al.) are shown to beconnected to regions of distinct stellar populations. these range from theyoung, still star-forming circumnuclear disks and rings with increasedmetallicity preferentially found in intermediate-mass fast rotators, toapparently old structures with extended disk-like kinematics, which areobserved to have an increased metallicity and mildly depressed [alpha/fe] ratiocompared to the main body of the galaxy. the slow rotators generally show nostellar population signatures over and above the well known metallicitygradients and are largely consistent with old (&gt;=10 gyr) stellar populations.

1012.1551	the atlas3d project -- i. a volume-limited sample of 260 nearby  early-type galaxies: science goals and selection criteria	the atlas3d project is a multi-wavelength survey combined with a theoreticalmodeling effort. the observations span from the radio to the millimeter andoptical, and provide multi-colour imaging, two-dimensional kinematics of theatomic (hi), molecular (co) and ionized gas (hbeta, [oiii] and [ni]), togetherwith the kinematics and population of the stars (hbeta, fe5015 and mgb), for acarefully selected, volume-limited (1.16*10^5 mpc^3) sample of 260 early-type(elliptical e and lenticular s0) galaxies (etgs). the models includesemi-analytic, n-body binary mergers and cosmological simulations of galaxyformation. here we present the science goals for the project and introduce thegalaxy sample and the selection criteria. the sample consists of nearby (d&lt;42mpc) morphologically-selected etgs extracted from a parent sample of 871galaxies (8% e, 22% s0 and 70% spirals) brighter than m_k&lt;-21.5 mag (stellarmass m_star&gt;6*10^9 m_sun). we analyze possible selection biases and we concludethat the parent sample is essentially complete and statistically representativeof the nearby galaxy population. we present the size-luminosity relation forthe spirals and etgs and show that the etgs in the atlas3d sample define atight red sequence in a colour-magnitude diagram, with few objects in thetransition from the blue cloud. we describe the strategy of the sauronintegral-field observations and the extraction of the stellar kinematics withthe ppxf method. we give an overview of the characteristics of the other maindatasets already available for our sample and of the ongoing modellingprojects.

1102.0957	the sauron project - xviii. the integrated uv-linestrength relations of  early-type galaxies	using far (fuv) and near (nuv) ultraviolet photometry from guest investigatorprogrammes on the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) satellite, opticalphotometry from the mdm observatory and optical integral-field spectroscopyfrom sauron, we explore the uv-linestrength relations of the 48 nearbyearly-type galaxies in the sauron sample. identical apertures are used for allquantities, avoiding aperture mismatch. we show that galaxies with purely oldstellar populations show well-defined correlations of the integrated fuv-v andfuv-nuv colours with the integrated mgb and hbeta absorption linestrengthindices, strongest for fuv-nuv. correlations with the nuv-v colour, fe5015index and stellar velocity dispersion are much weaker. these correlations putstringent constraints on the origin of the uv-upturn phenomenon in early-typegalaxies, and highlight its dependence on age and metallicity. in particular,despite recent debate, we recover the negative correlation between fuv-v colourand mg linestrength originally publicised by burstein et al. (1988), which werefer to as the "burstein relation", suggesting a positive dependence of theuv-upturn on metallicity. we argue that the scatter in the correlations isreal, and present mild evidence that a strong uv excess is preferentiallypresent in slow-rotating galaxies. we also demonstrate that most outliers inthe correlations are galaxies with current or recent star formation, some atvery low levels. we believe that this sensitivity to weak star formation,afforded by the deep and varied data available for the sauron sample, explainswhy our results are occasionally at odds with other recent but shallowersurveys. this is supported by the analysis of a large, carefully-crafted sampleof more distant early-type galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss),more easily comparable with current and future large surveys.

1102.3801	the atlas3d project - ii. morphologies, kinemetric features and  alignment between photometric and kinematic axes of early-type galaxies	[abridged] we use the atlas3d sample of 260 early-type galaxies (etgs) tostudy the apparent kinematic misalignment angle, psi, defined as the anglebetween the photometric and kinematic major axis. we find that 71% of nearbyetgs are strictly aligned systems (psi &gt; 5 deg), an additional 14% have 5 &lt; psi&lt; 10 deg and 90% of galaxies have psi &lt; 15 deg. taking into account measurementuncertainties, 90% of galaxies can be considered aligned to better than 5 deg,suggesting that only a small fraction of early-type galaxies (~10%) are notconsistent with axisymmetry within the projected half-light radius. we identifymorphological features such as bars and rings (30%), dust structures (16%),blue nuclear colours (6%) and evidence of interactions (8%). we use kinemetryto analyse the mean velocity maps and separate galaxies in two broad types ofregular and non-regular rotators. we find 82% of regular rotators and 17%non-regular rotators, with 2 galaxies that we were not able to classify due todata quality. the non-regular rotators are typically found in dense regions andare massive. the majority of galaxies do not have any specific kinemetricfeatures, but we highlight here the frequency of the kinematically distinctcores (7%) and the aligned double peaks in the velocity dispersion maps (4%).most of the galaxies that are misaligned have complex kinematics and arenon-regular rotators. while the trends are weak, there is a tendency that largevalues of psi are found in galaxies at intermediate environmental densities andamong the most massive galaxies in the sample. we suggest that the most commonformation mechanism for etgs preserves the axisymmetry of the disk progenitors.less commonly, the formation process results in a triaxial galaxy with muchlower net angular momentum.

1102.4444	the atlas3d project - iii. a census of the stellar angular momentum  within the effective radius of early-type galaxies: unveiling the  distribution of fast and slow rotators	we provide a census of the apparent stellar angular momentum within 1 re of avolume-limited sample of 260 early-type galaxies (etgs) in the nearby universe,using integral-field spectroscopy obtained in the course of the atlas3dproject. we exploit the lambdar parameter to characterise the existence of twofamilies of etgs: slow rotators which exhibit complex stellar velocity fieldsand often include stellar kinematically distinct cores (kdcs), and fastrotators which have regular velocity fields. our complete sample of 260 etgsleads to a new criterion to disentangle fast and slow rotators which nowincludes a dependency on the apparent ellipticity (epsilon). it separates thetwo classes significantly better than the previous prescription, and than acriterion based on v/sigma: slow rotators and fast rotators have lambdar lowerand larger than kfsxsqrt(epsilon), respectively, where kfs=0.31 formeasurements made within 1 re. we show that the vast majority of early-typegalaxies are fast rotators: these have regular stellar rotation, with alignedphotometric and kinematic axes (paper ii, krajnovic et al. 2011}, include discsand often bars and represent 86% (224/260) of all early-type galaxies in thevolume-limited atlas3d sample. fast rotators span the full range of apparentellipticities from 0 to 0.85, and we suggest that they cover intrinsicellipticities from about 0.35 to 0.85, the most flattened having morphologiesconsistent with spiral galaxies. only a small fraction of etgs are slowrotators representing 14% (36/260) of the atlas3d sample of etgs. of all slowrotators, 11% (4/36) exhibit two counter-rotating stellar disc-like componentsand are rather low mass objects (mdyn&lt;10^10.5 m_sun). all other slow rotators(32/36) appear relatively round on the sky (epsilon_e&lt;0.4), tend to be massive(mdyn&gt;10^10.5 m_sun), and often (17/32) exhibit kdcs.

1102.4877	the atlas3d project - v. the co tully-fisher relation of early-type  galaxies	we demonstrate here using both single-dish and interferometric observationsthat co molecules are an excellent kinematic tracer, even in high-massgalaxies, allowing us to investigate for the first time the co tully-fisherrelation of early-type galaxies. we compare the tully-fisher relations producedusing both single-dish and interferometric data and various inclinationestimation methods, and evaluate the use of the velocity profile shape as acriterion for selecting galaxies in which the molecular gas extends beyond thepeak of the rotation curve. we show that the gradient and zero-point of thebest-fit relations are robust, independent of the velocity measure andinclination used, and agree with those of relations derived using stellarkinematics. we also show that the early-type co tully-fisher (co-tf) relationis offset from the co-tf of spirals by 0.98 \pm 0.22 magnitude at ks-band, inline with other results. the intrinsic scatter of the relation is found to be\approx 0.4 magnitudes, similar to the level found in the spiral galaxypopulation. next generation facilities such as the large millimeter telescope(lmt) and the atacama large millimeter/sub-millimeter array (alma) should allowthis technique to be used in higher-redshift systems, providing a simple newtool to trace the mass-to-light ratio evolution of the most massive galaxiesover cosmic time.

1104.2240	the planetary nebulae population in the central regions of m32: the  sauron view	extragalactic planetary nebulae (pne) are not only useful as distancesignposts or as tracers of the dark-matter content of their host galaxies, butconstitute also good indicators of the main properties of their parent stellarpopulations. yet, so far, the properties of pne in the optical regions ofgalaxies where stellar population gradients can be more extreme have remainedlargely unexplored, mainly because the detection of pne with narrow-bandimaging or slit-less spectroscopy is considerably hampered by a strong stellarbackground. integral-field spectroscopy (ifs) can overcome this limitation, andhere we present a study of the pn population in the nearby compact ellipticalm32. using sauron data taken with just two 10-minutes-long pointings we havedoubled the number of known pne within the effective radius of m32, detectingpne five times fainter than previously found in narrow-band images thatcollected nearly the same number of photons. furthermore, by carefullyaccounting for the incompleteness of our survey we could conclude, despitehaving only 15 sources, that the central pne population of m32 is consistentwith the generally adopted shape for the pne luminosity function and itstypical normalization observed in early-type galaxies. finally, owing to theproximity of m32 and to uv images taken with hst, we could identify the mostlikely candidates for the central star of a subset of our detected pne andconclude that these stars are affected by substantial amounts of circumstellardust extinction, a finding that could reconcile the intriguing discrepancypreviously reported in m32 between model predictions and observations for thelater stages of stellar evolution. considering the modest time investment on a4m-class telescope that delivered these results, this work illustrates thepotential of future ifs studies for the central pne population of early-typegalaxies.

1104.2326	discovery of an agn-driven molecular outflow in the local early-type  galaxy ngc 1266	we report the discovery of a powerful molecular wind from the nucleus of thenon-interacting nearby s0 field galaxy ngc 1266. the single-dish co profileexhibits emission to +/- 400 km/s and requires a nested gaussian fit to beproperly described. interferometric observations reveal a massive, centrally-concentrated molecular component with a mass of 1.1x10^9 msuns and a molecularoutflow with a molecular mass of 2.4x10^7 msuns. the molecular gas close to thesystemic velocity consists of a rotating, compact nucleus with a mass of about4.1x108 msuns within a radius of approximately 60 pc. this compact molecularnucleus has a surface density of \approx 2.7 \times 10^4 msuns/pc^2, more thantwo orders of magnitude larger than that of giant molecular clouds in the diskof the milky way, and it appears to sit on the kennicutt-schmidt relationdespite its extreme kinematics and energetic activity. we interpret thisnucleus as a disk that confines the outflowing wind. a mass outflow rate of 13msuns/yr leads to a depletion timescale of about 85 myr. the star formation inngc 1266 is insufficient to drive the outflow, and thus it is likely driven bythe active galactic nucleus (agn). the concentration of the majority of themolecular gas in the central 100 pc requires an extraordinary loss of angularmomentum, but no obvious companion or interacting galaxy is present to enablethe transfer. ngc 1266 is the first known outflowing molecular system that doesnot show any evidence of a recent interaction.

1104.3545	the atlas3d project - vii. a new look at the morphology of nearby  galaxies: the kinematic morphology-density relation	we look at the morphology of fast and slow rotator early-type galaxies.edge-on fast rotators are lenticular galaxies. they appear like spiral galaxieswith the gas and dust removed, and in some cases are flat ellipticals withdisky isophotes. fast rotators are often barred and span the same full range ofbulge fractions as spiral galaxies. the slow rotators are rounder and aregenerally consistent with being genuine, namely spheroidal-like, ellipticalgalaxies. we propose a revision to the tuning-fork diagram by hubble as itgives a misleading description of etgs. we study for the first time thekinematic morphology-density t-sigma relation using fast and slow rotators toreplace lenticulars and ellipticals. we find that our relation is cleaner thanusing classic morphology. slow rotators are nearly absent at the lowest densityenvironments [f(sr)&lt;2%] and generally constitute a small fraction [f(sr)~4%] ofthe total galaxy population in the environments explored by our survey, withthe exception of the densest core of the virgo cluster [f(sr)~20%]. we find aclean log-linear relation between the fraction f(sp) of spiral galaxies and thelocal galaxy surface density. the existence of a smooth kinematic t-sigmarelation in the field excludes processes related to the cluster environment asmain contributors to the apparent conversion of spirals into fast-rotators inlow-density environments. it shows that the segregation is driven by localeffects at the small-group scale. only at the largest densities in the virgocore does the f(sp) relation break down and steepens sharply, while thefraction of slow-rotators starts to significantly increase. this suggests thata different mechanism is at work there.

1107.5059	the atlas3d project-- viii: modelling the formation and evolution of  fast and slow rotator early-type galaxies within $\lambda$cdm	we propose a simple model for the origin of fast and slow rotator early-typegalaxies (etg) within the hierarchical $\lambda$cdm scenario, that is based onthe assumption that the mass fraction of stellar discs in etgs is a proxy forthe specific angular momentum expressed via $\lambda_r$. within our model wereproduce the fraction of fast and slow rotators as a function of magnitude inthe \atl survey, assuming that fast rotating etgs have at least 10% of theirtotal stellar mass in a disc component. in agreement with \atl observations wefind that slow rotators are predominantly galaxies with $ m_* &gt; 10^{10.5}$m$_{\odot}$ contributing $\sim 20%$ to the overall etg population. we show indetail that the growth histories of fast and slow rotators are different,supporting the classification of etgs into these two categories. slow rotatorsaccrete between $\sim 50% -90%$ of their stellar mass from satellites and theirmost massive progenitors have on average up to 3 major mergers during theirevolution. fast rotators in contrast, accrete less than 50% and have on averageless than one major merger in their past.  we find that the underlying physical reason for the different growthhistories is the slowing down and ultimately complete shut-down of gas coolingin massive galaxies. once cooling and associated star formation in disc stops,galaxies grow via infall from satellites. frequent minor mergers thereby,destroy existing stellar discs via violent relaxation and also tend to lowerthe specific angular momentum of the main stellar body, lowering $\lambda_r$into the slow rotator regime. abridged...

1109.2746	the sauron project - xx. the spitzer [3.6] - [4.5] colour in early-type  galaxies: colours, colour gradients and inverted scaling relations	we investigate the [3.6] - [4.5] spitzer-irac colour behaviour of theearly-type galaxies of the sauron survey, a representative sample of 48 nearbyellipticals and lenticulars. we investigate how this colour, which isunaffected by dust extinction, can be used to constrain the stellar populationsin these galaxies.  we find a tight relation between the [3.6]-[4.5] colour and effectivevelocity dispersion, a good mass-indicator in early-type galaxies. contrary toother colours in the optical and near-infrared, we find that the colours becomebluer for larger galaxies. the relations are tighter when using the colourinside r_e, rather than the much smaller r_e/8 aperture, due to the presence ofyoung populations in the central regions. we also obtain strong correlationsbetween the [3.6]-[4.5] colour and 3 strong absorption lines (h beta, mg b andfe 5015). comparing our data with the models of marigo et al., which show thatmore metal rich galaxies are bluer, we can explain our results in a wayconsistent with results from the optical, by stating that larger galaxies aremore metal rich. the blueing is caused by a strong co absorption band, whoseline strength increases strongly with decreasing temperature and which covers aconsiderable fraction of the 4.5 micron filter. in galaxies that contain acompact radio source, the [3.6]-[4.5] colour is generally slightly redder thanin the other galaxies, indicating small amounts of either hot dust, non-thermalemission, or young stars near the center.  we find that the large majority of the galaxies show redder colours withincreasing radius. abbreviated...

1112.3641	the atlas3d project -- xi. dense molecular gas properties of co-luminous  early-type galaxies	surveying eighteen 12co-bright galaxies from the atlas3d early-type galaxysample with the institut de radio astronomie millim\'etrique (iram) 30mtelescope, we detect 13co(1-0) and 13co(2-1) in all eighteen galaxies, hcn(1-0)in 12/18 and hco+(1-0) in 10/18. we find that the line ratios12co(1-0)/13co(1-0) and 12co(1-0)/hcn(1-0) are clearly correlated with severalgalaxy properties: total stellar mass, luminosity-weighted mean stellar age,molecular to atomic gas ratio, dust temperature and dust morphology. we suggestthat these correlations are primarily governed by the optical depth in the 12colines; interacting, accreting and/or starbursting early-type galaxies have moreoptically thin molecular gas while those with settled dust and gas discs hostoptically thick molecular gas. the ranges of the integrated line intensityratios generally overlap with those of spirals, although we note some outliersin the 12co(1- 0)/13co(1-0), 12co(2-1)/13co(2-1) and hcn/hco+(1-0) ratios. inparticular, three galaxies are found to have very low 12co(1-0)/13co(1-0) and12co(2-1)/13co(2-1) ratios. such low ratios may signal particularly stablemolecular gas which creates stars less efficiently than 'normal' (i.e. belowschmidt-kennicutt prediction), consistent with the low dust temperatures seenin these galaxies.

1201.0885	simulations of binary galaxy mergers and the link with fast rotators,  slow rotators, and kinematically distinct cores	we study the formation of early-type galaxies (etgs) through mergers with asample of 70 high-resolution numerical simulations of binary mergers of discgalaxies. these simulations encompass various mass ratios, initial conditionsand orbital parameters. we find that binary mergers of disc galaxies with massratios of 3:1 and 6:1 are nearly always classified as fast rotators accordingto the atlas3d criterion: they preserve the structure of the input fastrotating spiral progenitors. major disc mergers (mass ratios of 2:1 and 1:1)lead to both fast and slow rotators. most of the slow rotators hold a stellarkinematically distinct core (kdc) in their 1-3 central kilo-parsec: these kdcsare built from the stellar components of the progenitors. the mass ratio of theprogenitors is a fundamental parameter for the formation of slow rotators inbinary mergers, but it also requires a retrograde spin for the progenitorgalaxies with respect to the orbital angular momentum. the importance of theinitial spin of the progenitors is also investigated in the library of galaxymergers of the galmer project.

1202.3308	a systematic variation of the stellar initial mass function in  early-type galaxies	much of our knowledge of galaxies comes from analysing the radiation emittedby their stars. it depends on the stellar initial mass function (imf)describing the distribution of stellar masses when the population formed.consequently knowledge of the imf is critical to virtually every aspect ofgalaxy evolution. more than half a century after the first imf determination,no consensus has emerged on whether it is universal in different galaxies.previous studies indicated that the imf and the dark matter fraction in galaxycentres cannot be both universal, but they could not break the degeneracybetween the two effects. only recently indications were found that massiveelliptical galaxies may not have the same imf as our milky way. here we reportunambiguous evidence for a strong systematic variation of the imf in early-typegalaxies as a function of their stellar mass-to-light ratio, producingdifferences up to a factor of three in mass. this was inferred from detaileddynamical models of the two-dimensional stellar kinematics for the largeatlas3d representative sample of nearby early-type galaxies spanning two ordersof magnitude in stellar mass. our finding indicates that the imf dependsintimately on a galaxy's formation history.

1204.2590	the sauron project-xxi. the spatially-resolved uv-line strength  relations of early-type galaxies	the unexpected rising flux of early-type galaxies at decreasing ultraviolet(uv) wavelengths is a long-standing mystery. one important observationalconstraint is the correlation between uv-optical colours and mg2 line strengthsfound by burstein et al. (1988). the simplest interpretation of this phenomenonis that the uv strength is related to the mg line strength. under thisassumption, we expect galaxies with larger mg gradients to have larger uvcolour gradients. by combining uv imaging from galex, optical imaging from mdmand sauron integral-field spectroscopy, we investigate the spatially-resolvedrelationships between uv colours and stellar population properties of 34early-type galaxies from the sauron survey sample. we find that galaxies withold stellar populations show tight correlations between the fuv colours (fuv-vand fuv-nuv) and the mgb index, h{\beta} index and metallicity [z/h]. theequivalent correlations for the fe5015 index, {\alpha}-enhancement[{\alpha}/fe] and age are present but weaker. we have also derived logarithmicinternal radial colour, measured line strength and derived stellar populationgradients for each galaxy and again found a strong dependence of the fuv-v andfuv-nuv colour gradients on both the mg b line strength and the metallicitygradients for galaxies with old stellar populations. in particular, globalgradients of mg b and [z/h] with respect to the uv colour across galaxies areconsistent with their local gradients within galaxies, suggesting that theglobal correlations also hold locally. from a simple model based on multi-bandcolour fits of uv upturn and uv-weak galaxies, we have identified a plausiblerange of parameters that reproduces the observed radial colour profiles. inthese models, the centers of elliptical galaxies, where the uv flux is strong,are enhanced in metals by roughly 60% compared to uv-weak regions.

1205.4299	an oxford swift integral field spectroscopy study of 14 early-type  galaxies in the coma cluster	as a demonstration of the capabilities of the new oxford swift integral fieldspectrograph, we present first observations for a set of 14 early-type galaxiesin the core of the coma cluster. our data consist of i- and z-band spatiallyresolved spectroscopy obtained with the oxford swift spectrograph, combinedwith r-band photometry from the sdss archive for 14 early- type galaxies. wederive spatially resolved kinematics for all objects from observations of thecalcium triplet absorption features at \sim 8500 {aa} . using this kinematicinformation we classify galaxies as either fast rotators or slow rotators. wecompare the fraction of fast and slow rotators in our sample, representing thedensest environment in the nearby universe, to results from the atlas3d survey,finding the slow rotator fraction is \sim 50 per cent larger in the core of thecoma cluster than in the virgo cluster or field, a 1.2 {\sigma} increase givenour selection criteria. comparing our sample to the virgo cluster core only(which is 24 times less dense than the coma core) we find no evidence of anincrease in the slow rotator fraction. combining measurements of the effectivevelocity dispersion {\sigma_e} with the photometric data we determine thefundamental plane for our sample of galaxies. we find the use of the averagevelocity dispersion within 1 effective radius, {\sigma_e}, reduces theresiduals by 13 per cent with respect to comparable studies using centralvelocity dispersions, consistent with other recent integral field fundamentalplane determinations.

1206.0291	the atlas3d project - xii. recovery of the mass-to-light ratio of  simulated early-type barred galaxies with axisymmetric dynamical models	we investigate the accuracy in the recovery of the stellar dynamics of barredgalaxies when using axisymmetric dynamical models. we do this by trying torecover the mass-to-light ratio (m/l) and the anisotropy of realistic galaxysimulations using the jeans anisotropic multi-gaussian expansion (jam) method.however, given that the biases we find are mostly due to an application of anaxisymmetric modeling algorithm to a non-axisymmetric system and in particularto inaccuracies in the de-projected mass model, our results are relevant forgeneral axisymmetric modelling methods. we run n-body collisionless simulationsto build a library with various luminosity distribution, constructed to mimicreal individual galaxies, with realistic anisotropy. the final result of ourevolved library of simulations contains both barred and unbarred galaxies. thejam method assumes an axisymmetric mass distribution, and we adopt a spatiallyconstant m/l and anisotropy beta_z=1-sigma_z^2/sigma_r^2 distributions. themodels are fitted to two-dimensional maps of the second velocity momentsv_rms=sqrt(v^2+sigma^2) of the simulations for various viewing angles (positionangle of the bar and inclination of the galaxy). we find that the inclinationis generally well recovered by the jam models, for both barred and unbarredsimulations. for unbarred simulations the m/l is also accurately recovered,with negligible median bias and with a maximum one of just delta(m/l)&lt;1.5% whenthe galaxy is not too close to face on. at very low inclinations (i&lt;30 deg) them/l can be significantly overestimated (9% in our tests, but errors can belarger for very face-on views). for barred simulations the m/l is on average(when pa=45 deg) essentially unbiased, but we measure an over/under estimationof up to delta(m/l)=15% in our tests. the sign of the m/l bias depends on theposition angle of the bar as expected.

1208.3523	the atlas3d project - xx. mass-size and mass-sigma distributions of  early-type galaxies: bulge fraction drives kinematics, mass-to-light ratio,  molecular gas fraction and stellar initial mass function	we study the (m,sigma) and (m,re) projections of the thin mass plane (mp)(m,sigma,re) which describes the distribution of the galaxy population. thedistribution of galaxy properties on the mp is characterized by: (i) a zone ofexclusion described by two power-laws joined by a break at m 3e10 msun. thisresults in a break in the mean m-sigma relation with msigma^2.3 and m sigma^4.7at small and large sigma respectively; (ii) a mass m 2e11 msun which separatesa population dominated by flat fast rotator with disks and spiral galaxies atlower masses, from one dominated by quite round slow rotators at larger masses;(iii) below that mass the distribution of etgs properties tends to be constantalong lines of constant sigma; (iv) it forms a parallel sequence with thedistribution of spiral galaxies; (v) at even lower masses, the distribution offast rotator etgs and late spirals naturally extends to that of dwarf etgs(sph) and dwarf irregulars (im) respectively. we show via dynamical models thatsigma traces the bulge fraction, which drives the observed trends in m/l,hbeta, colour, imf and molecular gas fraction. we interpret this as due to acombination of two main effects: (i) an increase of the bulge fraction whichincreases sigma and greatly enhances the likelihood for a galaxy to have itsstar formation quenched, and (ii) dry merging, increasing galaxy mass alonglines of nearly constant sigma, while leaving the population unchanged.[abriged]

1209.4107	discovery of a giant hi tail in the galaxy group hcg 44	we report the discovery of a giant hi tail in the intra-group medium of hcg44 as part of the atlas3d survey. the tail is ~300 kpc long in projection andcontains ~5x10^8 m_sun of hi. we detect no diffuse stellar light at thelocation of the tail down to ~28.5 mag/arcsec^2 in g band. we speculate thatthe tail might have formed as gas was stripped from the outer regions of ngc3187 (a member of hcg 44) by the group tidal field. in this case, a simplemodel indicates that about 1/3 of the galaxy's hi was stripped during a timeinterval of &lt;1 gyr. alternatively, the tail may be the remnant of aninteraction between hcg 44 and ngc 3162, a spiral galaxy now ~650 kpc away fromthe group. regardless of the precise formation mechanism, the detected hi tailshows for the first time direct evidence of gas stripping in hcg 44. it alsohighlights that deep hi observations over a large field are needed to gather acomplete census of this kind of events in the local universe.

1210.8167	the atlas3d project - xvii. linking photometric and kinematic signatures  of stellar discs in early-type galaxies	[abridged] we analyse the morphological structures in galaxies of the atlas3dsample by fitting a single sersic profile and decomposing all non-barredobjects (180 of 260 objects) in two components parameterised by an exponentialand a general sersic function. the aim of this analysis is to look forsignatures of discs in light distributions of nearby early-type galaxies andcompare them to kinematic properties. using sersic index from single componentfits for a distinction between slow and fast rotators, or even late- andearly-type galaxies, is not recommended. assuming that objects with n&gt;3 areslow rotators (or ellipticals), there is only a 22 per cent probability tocorrectly classify objects as slow rotators (or 37 per cent of previouslyclassified as ellipticals). we show that exponential sub-components, as well aslight profiles fitted with only a single component of a low sersic index, canbe linked with the kinematic evidence for discs in early-type galaxies. themedian disk-to-total light ratio for fast and slow rotators is 0.41 and 0.0,respectively. similarly, the median sersic indices of the bulge (general sersiccomponent) are 1.7 and 4.8 for fast and slow rotators, respectively. overall,discs or disc-like structures, are present in 83 per cent of early-typegalaxies which do not have bars, and they show a full range of disk-to-totallight ratios. discs in early-type galaxies contribute with about 40 per cent tothe total mass of the analysed (non-barred) objects. the decomposition intodiscs and bulges can be used as a rough approximation for the separationbetween fast and slow rotators, but it is not a substitute, as there is only a59 per cent probability to correctly recognise slow rotators. kinematics (i.e.projected angular momentum) remains the best approach to mitigate the influenceof the inclination effects.

1211.4615	the atlas3d project - xxi. correlations between gradients of local  escape velocity and stellar populations in early-type galaxies	we explore the connection between the local escape velocity, v_esc, and thestellar population properties in the atlas3d survey, a complete, volume-limitedsample of nearby early-type galaxies. we make use of ugriz photometry toconstruct multi-gaussian expansion models of the surface brightnesses of ourgalaxies. we are able to fit the full range of surface brightness profilesfound in our sample, and in addition we reproduce the results ofstate-of-the-art photometry in the literature with residuals of 0.04 mags. weutilise these photometric models and sauron integral-field spectroscopy,combined with jeans dynamical modelling, to determine the local v_esc derivedfrom the surface brightness. we find that the local v_esc is tightly correlatedwith the mgb and fe5015 linestrengths and optical colours, and anti-correlatedwith the hbeta linestrength. in the case of the mgb and colour - v_escrelations we find that the relation within individual galaxies follows theglobal relation between different galaxies. we intentionally ignored anyuncertain contribution due to dark matter since we are seeking an empiricaldescription of stellar population gradients in early-type galaxies that isideal for quantitative comparison with model predictions. we identify apopulation of galaxies that occur only at low v_esc that exhibit negativegradients in the mgb - and colour -v_esc relations. these galaxies typicallyhave young central stellar populations and contain significant amounts ofmolecular gas and dust. combining these results with n-body simulations ofbinary mergers we use the mgb-v_esc relation to constrain the possible numberof dry mergers experienced by the local early-type galaxy population - atypical massive etg can have experienced only ~1.5 major mergers beforebecoming a significant outlier in the mgb-v_esc relation.

1212.2288	the atlas3d project - xxii. low-efficiency star formation in early-type  galaxies: hydrodynamic models and observations	we study the global efficiency of star formation in high resolutionhydrodynamical simulations of gas discs embedded in isolated early-type andspiral galaxies. despite using a universal local law to form stars in thesimulations, we find that the early-type galaxies are offset from the spiralson the large-scale kennicutt relation, and form stars 2 to 5 times lessefficiently. this offset is in agreement with previous results on morphologicalquenching: gas discs are more stable against star formation when embedded inearly-type galaxies due to the lower disc self-gravity and increased shear. asa result, these gas discs do not fragment into dense clumps and do not reach ashigh densities as in the spiral galaxies. even if some molecular gas ispresent, the fraction of very dense gas (above 10^4 cm-3) is significantlyreduced, which explains the overall lower star formation efficiency. we alsoanalyse a sample of local early-type and spiral galaxies, measuring their coand hi surface densities and their star formation rates as determined by theirnon-stellar 8um emission. as predicted by the simulations, we find that theearly-type galaxies are offset from the kennicutt relation compared to thespirals, with a twice lower efficiency. finally, we validate our approach byperforming a direct comparison between models and observations. we run asimulation designed to mimic the stellar and gaseous properties of ngc524, alenticular galaxy, and find a gas disc structure and global star formation ratein good agreement with the observations. morphological quenching thus seems tobe a robust mechanism, and is also consistent with other observations of areduced star formation efficiency in early-type galaxies in the cold gasssurvey. this lower efficiency of star formation is not enough to explain theformation of the whole red sequence, but can contribute to the reddening ofsome galaxies.

1212.2630	the atlas 3d project - xvi. physical parameters and spectral line energy  distributions of the molecular gas in gas-rich early-type galaxies	[abridged] we present a detailed study of the physical properties of themolecular gas in a sample of 18 molecular gas-rich early-type galaxies (etgs)from the atlas$ 3d sample. our goal is to better understand the star formationprocesses occurring in those galaxies, starting here with the densestar-forming gas. we use existing integrated $^{12}$co(1-0, 2-1),$^{13}$co(1-0, 2-1), hcn(1-0) and hco$^{+}$(1-0) observations and present new$^{12}$co(3-2) single-dish data. from these, we derive for the first time theaverage kinetic temperature, h$_{2}$ volume density and column density of theemitting gas, this using a non-lte theoretical model. since the co lines tracedifferent physical conditions than of those the hcn and hco$^{+}$ lines, thetwo sets of lines are treated separately. we also compare for the first timethe predicted co spectral line energy distributions (sleds) and gas propertiesof our molecular gas-rich etgs with those of a sample of nearby well-studieddisc galaxies. the gas excitation conditions in 13 of our 18 etgs appearanalogous to those in the centre of the milky way. such results have never beenobtained before for etgs and open a new window to explore furtherstar-formation processes in the universe. the conclusions drawn shouldnevertheless be considered carefully, as they are based on a limited number ofobservations and on a simple model. in the near future, with higher cotransition observations, it should be possible to better identify the variousgas components present in etgs, as well as more precisely determine theirassociated physical conditions. to achieve these goals, we show here from ourtheoretical study, that mid-j co lines (such as the $^{12}$co(6-5) line) areparticularly useful.

1301.2589	the atlas3d project - xix. the hot-gas content of early-type galaxies:  fast versus slow rotators	for early-type galaxies, the ability to sustain a corona of hot, x-rayemitting gas could have played a key role in quenching their star-formationhistory. yet, it is still unclear what drives the precise amount of hot gasaround these galaxies. by combining photometric and spectroscopic measurementsfor the early-type galaxies observed during the atlas3d integral-field surveywith measurements of their x-ray luminosity based on x-ray data of both low andhigh spatial resolution we conclude that the hot-gas content of early-typegalaxies can depend on their dynamical structure. specifically, whereas slowrotators generally have x-ray halos with luminosity l_x,gas and temperature tvalues that are in line with what is expected if the hot-gas emission issustained by the thermalisaton of the kinetic energy carried by thestellar-mass loss material, fast rotators tend to display l_x,gas values thatfall consistently below the prediction of this model, with similar t valuesthat do not scale with the stellar kinetic energy as observed in the case ofslow rotators. considering that fast rotators are likely to be intrinsicallyflatter than slow rotators, and that the few l_x,gas-deficient slow rotatorsalso happen to be relatively flat, the observed l_x,gas deficiency in theseobjects would support the hypothesis whereby flatter galaxies have a hardertime in retaining their hot gas. we discuss the implications that a differenthot-gas content could have on the fate of both acquired and internally-producedgaseous material, considering in particular how the l_x,gas deficiency of fastrotators would make them more capable to recycle the stellar-mass loss materialinto new stars than slow rotators. this is consistent with the finding thatmolecular gas and young stars are detected only in fast rotators in the atlas3dsample, and that fast rotators tend to dustier than slow rotators.

1308.6581	fast and slow rotators in the densest environments: a swift ifs study of  the coma cluster	we present integral-field spectroscopy of 27 galaxies in the coma clusterobserved with the oxford swift spectrograph, exploring the kinematicmorphology-density relationship in a cluster environment richer and denser thanany in the atlas3d survey. our new data enables comparison of the kinematicmorphology relation in three very different clusters (virgo, coma and abell1689) as well as to the field/group environment. the coma sample was selectedto match the parent luminosity and ellipticity distributions of the early-typepopulation within a radius 15' (0.43 mpc) of the cluster centre, and is limitedto r' = 16 mag (equivalent to m_k = -21.5 mag), sampling one third of thatpopulation. from analysis of the lambda-ellipticity diagram, we find 15+-6% ofearly-type galaxies are slow rotators; this is identical to the fraction foundin the field and the average fraction in the virgo cluster, based on theatlas3d data. it is also identical to the average fraction found recently inabell 1689 by d'eugenio et al.. thus it appears that the average slow rotatorfraction of early type galaxies remains remarkably constant across manydifferent environments, spanning five orders of magnitude in galaxy numberdensity. however, within each cluster the slow rotators are generally found inregions of higher projected density, possibly as a result of mass segregationby dynamical friction. these results provide firm constraints on the mechanismsthat produce early-type galaxies: they must maintain a fixed ratio between thenumber of fast rotators and slow rotators while also allowing the totalearly-type fraction to increase in clusters relative to the field. a completesurvey of coma, sampling hundreds rather than tens of galaxies, could probe amore representative volume of coma and provide significantly strongerconstraints, particularly on how the slow rotator fraction varies at largerradii.

1311.6469	ngc1266 as a local candidate for rapid cessation of star formation	we present new spectrographic areal unit for research on optical nebulae(sauron) integral-field spectroscopy and swift ultraviolet optical telescope(uvot) observations of molecular outflow host galaxy ngc 1266 that indicate ngc1266 has experienced a rapid cessation of star formation. both the sauron mapsof stellar population age and the swift uvot observations demonstrate thepresence of young ($&lt; 1$ gyr) stellar populations within the central 1 kpc,while existing combined array for research in millimeter-wave astronomy (carma)co(1--0) maps indicate that the sites of current star formation are constrainedto the inner few hundred parsecs of the galaxy only. the optical spectrum ofngc 1266 from moustakas &amp; kennicutt (2006) reveal a characteristicpost-starburst (k+a) stellar population and davis et al. (2012) confirm thationized gas emission in the system originate from a shock. galaxies with k+aspectra and shock-like ionized gas line ratios may comprise an important,overlooked segment of the post-starburst population, containing exactly thoseobjects in which the agn is actively expelling the star-forming material. whileagn activity is not the likely driver of the post-starburst event that occurred500 myr ago, the faint spiral structure seen in the hubble space telescope(hst) wide-field camera 3 (wfc3) y-, j- and h-band imaging seems to point tothe possibility of gravitational torques being the culprit. if the moleculargas were driven into the center at the same time as the larger scale galaxydisk underwent quenching, the agn might be able to sustain the presence ofmolecular gas for $\gtrsim 1$ gyr by cyclically injecting turbulent kineticenergy into the dense molecular gas via a radio jet, inhibiting star formation.

1403.4850	the atlas3d project - xxviii. dynamically-driven star formation  suppression in early-type galaxies	we present measurements of the star formation rate (sfr) in the early-typegalaxies (etgs) of the atlas3d sample, based on wide-field infrared surveyexplorer (wise) 22um and galaxy evolution explorer (galex) far-ultravioletemission. we combine these with gas masses estimated from 12co and hi data inorder to investigate the star formation efficiency (sfe) in a larger sample ofetgs than previously available. we first recalibrate (based on wise data) therelation between old stellar populations (traced at ks-band) and 22umluminosity, allowing us to remove the contribution of 22um emission fromcircumstellar dust. we then go on to investigate the position of etgs on thekennicutt-schmidt (ks) relation. molecular gas-rich etgs have comparable starformation surface densities to normal spiral galaxy centres, but they liesystematically offset from the ks relation, having lower star formationefficiencies by a factor of ~2.5 (in agreement with other authors). this effectis driven by galaxies where a substantial fraction of the molecular material isin the rising part of the rotation curve, and shear is high. we show here forthe first time that although the number of stars formed per unit gas mass perunit time is lower in etgs, it seems that the amount of stars formed perfree-fall time is approximately constant. the scatter around this dynamicalrelation still correlates with galaxy properties such as the shape of thepotential in the inner regions. this leads us to suggest that dynamicalproperties (such as shear or the global stability of the gas) may be importantsecond parameters that regulate star formation and cause much of the scatteraround star-formation relations.

1501.03723	the atlas3d project - xxx. star formation histories and stellar  population scaling relations of early-type galaxies	we present the stellar population content of early-type galaxies from theatlas3d survey. using spectra integrated within apertures covering up to oneeffective radius, we apply two methods: one based on measuring line-strengthindices and applying single stellar population (ssp) models to derivessp-equivalent values of stellar age, metallicity, and alpha enhancement; andone based on spectral fitting to derive non-parametric star-formationhistories, mass-weighted average values of age, metallicity, and half-massformation timescales. using homogeneously derived effective radii anddynamically-determined galaxy masses, we present the distribution of stellarpopulation parameters on the mass plane (m_jam, sigma_e, r_maj), showing thatat fixed mass, compact early-type galaxies are on average older, moremetal-rich, and more alpha-enhanced than their larger counterparts.  from non-parametric star-formation histories, we find that the duration ofstar formation is systematically more extended in lower mass objects. assumingthat our sample represents most of the stellar content of today's localuniverse, approximately 50% of all stars formed within the first 2 gyrfollowing the big bang. most of these stars reside today in the most massivegalaxies (&gt;10^10.5 m_sun), which themselves formed 90% of their stars by z~2.the lower-mass objects, in contrast, have formed barely half their stars inthis time interval. stellar population properties are independent ofenvironment over two orders of magnitude in local density, varying only withgalaxy mass. in the highest-density regions of our volume (dominated by thevirgo cluster), galaxies are older, alpha-enhanced and have shorterstar-formation histories with respect to lower density regions.

1505.01895	on the distribution of galaxy ellipticity in clusters	we study the distribution of projected ellipticity n(epsilon) for galaxies ina sample of 20 rich (richness &gt;= 2) nearby (z &lt; 0.1) clusters of galaxies. wefind no evidence of differences in n(epsilon), although the nearest cluster inthe sample (the coma cluster) is the largest outlier (p(same) &lt; 0.05). we thenstudy n(epsilon) within the clusters, and find that epsilon increases withprojected cluster-centric radius r (hereafter the epsilon-r relation). thistrend is preserved at fixed magnitude, showing that this relation exists overand above the trend of more luminous galaxies to be both rounder and morecommon in the centres of clusters. the epsilon-r relation is particularlystrong in the subsample of intrinsically flattened galaxies (epsilon &gt; 0.4),therefore it is not a consequence of the increasing fraction of round slowrotator galaxies near cluster centers. furthermore, the epsilon-r relationpersists for just smooth flattened galaxies and for galaxies with devaucouleurs-like light profiles, suggesting that the variation of the spiralfraction with radius is not the underlying cause of the trend. we interpret ourfindings in light of the classification of early type galaxies (etgs) as fastand slow rotators. we conclude that the observed trend of decreasing epsilontowards the centres of clusters is evidence for physical effects in clusterscausing fast rotator etgs to have a lower average intrinsic ellipticity nearthe centres of rich clusters.

astro-ph;0011234	on the dependence of spectroscopic indices of early-type galaxies on  age, metallicity and velocity dispersion	we investigate the mg-sigma and &lt;fe&gt;-sigma relations in a sample of 72early-type galaxies drawn mostly from cluster and group environments using ahomogeneous data-set which is well-calibrated onto the lick/ids system. thesmall intrinsic scatter in mg at a given sigma gives upper limits on the spreadin age and metallicity of 49% and 32% respectively, if the spread is attributedto one quantity only and if the variations in age and metallicity areuncorrelated. the age/metallicity distribution as inferred from the hbeta vs&lt;fe&gt; diagnostic diagram reinforces this conclusion, as we find mostly galaxieswith large luminosity weighted ages spanning a range in metallicity. in oursample we do not find significant evidence for an anti-correlation of ages andmetallicities which would keep the index-sigma relations tight while hiding alarge spread in age and metallicity. as a result of correlated errors in theage-metallicity plane, a mild age-metallicity anti-correlation cannot becompletely ruled out given the current data. correcting the line-strengthsindices for non-solar abundance ratios following the recent paper by trager etal., leads to higher mean metallicity and slightly younger age estimates whilepreserving the metallicity sequence. the [mg/fe] ratio is mildly correlatedwith the central velocity dispersion and ranges from [mg/fe]=0.05 to 0.3 forgalaxies with sigma &gt; 100 km/s. under the assumption that there is no agegradient along the index-sigma relations, the abundance-ratio correctedmg-sigma, &lt;fe&gt;-sigma and hbeta-sigma relations give consistent estimates ofdelta [m/h]/ delta log sigma = 0.9 (+- 0.1). the slope of the hbeta-sigmarelation limits a potential age trend as a function of sigma to 2-3 gyrs alongthe sequence.(abriged)

astro-ph;0012456	the peculiar motions of early-type galaxies in two distant regions vi:  the maximum likelihood gaussian algorithm	the efar project is designed to measure the properties and peculiar motionsof early-type galaxies in two distant regions. here we describe the maximumlikelihood algorithm we developed to investigate the correlations between theparameters of the efar database. one-, two-, and three-dimensional gaussianmodels are constructed to determine the mean value and intrinsic spread of theparameters, and the slopes and intrinsic parallel and orthogonal spread of themgb'-mg2, mg2-sigma, mgb'-sigma relations, and the fundamental plane. in thelatter case, the cluster peculiar velocities are also determined. we show thatthis method is superior to ``canonical'' approaches of least-squares type,which give biased slopes and biased peculiar velocities. we test the algorithmwith monte carlo simulations of mock efar catalogues and derive the systematicand random errors on the estimated parameters. we find that random errors arealways dominant. we estimate the influence of systematic errors due to the wayclusters were selected and the hard limits and uncertainties in the selectionfunction parameters for the galaxies. we explore the influence of uniformdistributions in the fundamental plane parameters and the errors. we concludethat the mean peculiar motions of the efar clusters can be determined reliably.in particular, the placement of the two efar sample regions relative to thelauer and postman dipole allows us to strongly constrain the amplitude of thebulk motion in this direction.

astro-ph;0104084	on the origin of the colour-magnitude relation in the virgo cluster	we explore the origin of the colour-magnitude relation (cmr) of early typegalaxies in the virgo cluster using spectra of very high s/n ratio for sixelliptical galaxies selected along the cmr. the data are analysed using a newevolutionary stellar population synthesis model to generate galaxy spectra atthe resolution given by their velocity dispersions. in particular we use a newage indicator that is virtually free of the effects of metallicity. we findthat the luminosity weighted mean ages of virgo ellipticals are greater than ~8gyr, and show no clear trend with galaxy luminosity. we also find a positivecorrelation of metallicity with luminosity, colour and velocity dispersion. weconclude that the cmr is driven primarily by a luminosity-metallicitycorrelation. however, not all elements increase equally with the totalmetallicity and we speculate that the cmr may be driven by both a totalmetallicity increase and by a systematic departure from solar abundance ratiosof some elements along the cmr. a full understanding of the role played by thetotal metallicity, abundance ratios and age in generating the cmr requires theanalysis of spectra of very high quality, such as those reported here, for alarger number of galaxies in virgo and other clusters.

astro-ph;0410121	structural properties of discs and bulges of early-type galaxies	we have used the efar sample of galaxies to study the light distributions ofearly-type galaxies. we decompose the 2d light distribution of the galaxies ina flattened spheroidal component with a sersic radial light profile and aninclined disc component with an exponential light profile. we show that thebrightest, bulge dominated elliptical galaxies have a fairly broad distributionin the sersic profile shape parameter n_b, with a median of about 3.7 and asigma of ~0.9. other galaxies have smaller n_b values, meaning that spheroidsare in general less concentrated than the n_b=4 de vaucouleurs-law profile.  the results of our light decompositions are robust, even though withoutkinematic information we cannot prove that the spheroids and discs are reallypressure- and rotation-supported stellar systems. if we assume that thedetected spheroids and discs are indeed separate components, we can draw thefollowing conclusions: 1) the spheroid and disc scale sizes are correlated; 2)bulge-to-total luminosity ratios, bulge effective radii, and bulge n_b valuesare all positively correlated; 3) the bivariate space density distribution ofelliptical galaxies in the (luminosity, scale size)-plane is well described bya schechter luminosity function in and a log-normal scale-size distribution ata given luminosity; 4) at the brightest luminosities, the scale sizedistribution of elliptical galaxies is similar to those of bright spiralgalaxies; at fainter luminosities the elliptical scale size distribution peaksat distinctly smaller sizes than the spiral galaxy distribution; and 5) bulgecomponents of early-type galaxies are typically a factor 1.5 to 2.5 smallerthan the disks of spiral galaxies, while disc components of early-type galaxiesare typically twice as large as the discs of spiral galaxies.

astro-ph;0512415	rejuvenation of spiral bulges	we seek to understand whether the stellar populations of galactic bulges showfingerprints of secular evolution triggered by the presence of the disc. forthis purpose we re-analyse the sample of proctor and sansom, deriving stellarpopulation ages and element abundances from absorption line indices. we obtainvery consistent constraints on ages from the three balmer indices hbeta,hgamma, and hdelta, in good agreement with those of proctor and sansom based ona completely different method. like other studies in the literature, we findthat bulges have relatively low luminosity weighted ages, the lowest agederived for the smallest bulges being 1.3 gyr. hence bulges are not generallyold but actually rejuvenated systems. we discuss evidence that this might betrue also for the bulge of the milky way. we show that the smallest bulges,being the youngest with the lowest alpha/fe ratios, must have experienced starformation events involving 10-30 per cent of their total mass in the past 1-2gyr. no significant correlations of the stellar population parameters withhubble type are found instead. we show that the relationships with sigmacoincide perfectly with those of early-type galaxies. hence, bulges aretypically seen younger, metal-poorer and less alpha/fe enhanced than early-typegalaxies, only because of their smaller masses. at a given velocity dispersion,bulges and elliptical galaxies are indistinguishable as far as their stellarpopulations are concerned. these results favour an inside-out formationscenario and indicate that the discs in spiral galaxies of hubble types sbc andearlier cannot have a significant influence on the evolution of the stellarpopulations in the bulge component. the phenomenon of pseudobulge formationmust be restricted to spirals of types later than sbc.

astro-ph;0602318	young kinematically decoupled components in early-type galaxies	we present results from a series of follow-up observations of a sub-sample ofthe representative sauron survey elliptical (e) and lenticular (s0) galaxiesusing the oasis integral-field spectrograph. these observations focus on thecentral 10" x 10", with roughly double the spatial resolution of the sauronobservations. this increased spatial resolution reveals a number of interestingand previously unresolved features in the measured stellar kinematics andabsorption-line strengths. we find that galaxies exhibiting the youngest globalstellar populations (as measured with sauron) often contain a distinctly youngcentral region (on scales of a few hundred parsec or less) compared to the restof the galaxy. moreover, these compact, young components are found to be mostlycounter-rotating with respect to the rest of the galaxy. given that there is nowell-established reason for such young components to `prefer' counter- overco-rotation, this finding raises the following questions: how common are thesesmall kdcs as a function of age? why are there more young than old compactkdcs? where are the equivalent co-rotating components? we explore thesequestions using simple simulated velocity fields and stellar population models,and find that the fading of the young component as it evolves, coupled with thefact that counter-rotating components are more easily detected in the velocityfield, may help explain the observed trends.

astro-ph;0608212	star formation and figure rotation in the early-type galaxy ngc2974	we present galaxy evolution explorer (galex) far (fuv) and near (nuv)ultraviolet imaging of the nearby early-type galaxy ngc2974, along withcomplementary ground-based optical imaging. in the ultraviolet, the galaxyreveals a central spheroid-like component and a newly discovered complete outerring of radius 6.2kpc, with suggestions of another partial ring at an evenlarger radius. blue fuv-nuv and uv-optical colours are observed in the centreof the galaxy and from the outer ring outward, suggesting young stellarpopulations (&lt; 1gyr) and recent star formation in both locations. this issupported by a simple stellar population model which assumes two bursts of starformation, allowing us to constrain the age, mass fraction and surface massdensity of the young component pixel by pixel. overall, the mass fraction ofthe young component appears to be just under 1per cent (lower limit,uncorrected for dust extinction). the additional presence of a nuclear and aninner ring (radii 1.4 and 2.9kpc, respectively), as traced by [oiii] emission,suggests ring formation through resonances. all three rings are consistent witha single pattern speed of $78\pm6$ km/s/kpc, typical of s0 galaxies and onlymarginally slower than expected for a fast bar if traced by a small observedsurface brightness plateau. this thus suggests that star formation andmorphological evolution in ngc2974 at the present epoch are primarily driven bya rotating asymmetry (probably a large-scale bar), despite the standardclassification of ngc2974 as an e4 elliptical.

astro-ph;0703531	the sauron project -- ix. a kinematic classification for early-type  galaxies	2d stellar kinematics of 48 representative e and s0 galaxies obtained withthe sauron ifs reveal that early-type galaxies appear in two broad flavours,depending on whether they exhibit clear large-scale rotation or not. we definea new parameter lambdar which involves luminosity weighted averages over thefull 2d kinematic field, as a proxy to quantify the observed projected stellarangular momentum per unit mass. we use it as a basis for a new kinematicclassification: early-type galaxies are separated into slow and fast rotators(srs, frs), depending on whether they have lambdar values within theireffective radius re below or above 0.1, respectively. srs and frs are shown tobe physically distinct classes of galaxies, a result which cannot simply be theconsequence of a biased viewing angle. frs tend to be relatively low luminositygalaxies. srs tend to be brighter and more massive galaxies, but are stillspread over a wide range of absolute magnitude. 3 slow rotators of our sample,among the most massive ones, are consistent with zero rotation. remarkably, allother srs contain a large kpc-scale kdc. all frs show well aligned photometricand kinemetric axes, and small velocity twists, in contrast with most srs whichexhibit significant misalignments and velocity twists. in a companion paper(paper x), we also show that frs and srs are distinct classes in terms of theirorbital distribution. we suggest that gas is a key ingredient in the formationand evolution of frs, and that the slowest rotators are the extremeevolutionary end point reached deep in gravitational potential wells wheredissipationless mergers had a major role in the evolution, and for which mostof the baryonic angular momentum was expelled outwards.

astro-ph;9710176	the ages and metallicities of early type galaxies in the fornax cluster	we have measured central line strengths for a complete sample of early typegalaxies in the fornax cluster, comprising 11 elliptical and 11 lenticulargalaxies, more luminous than m_b=-17. in contrast to the elliptical galaxies inthe sample studied by gonzalez (and recently revisited by trager) we find thatthe fornax ellipticals follow the locus of galaxies of fixed age in worthey'smodels and have metallicities varying from roughly solar to three times solar.the lenticular galaxies however exhibit a substantial spread to youngerluminosity weighted ages indicating a more extended star formation history. wepresent measurements of the more sensitive indices: c4668 and hgamma_a; theseconfirm and re-enforce the conclusions that the elliptical galaxies are coevaland that only the lenticular galaxies show symptoms of late star-formation. theinferred difference in the age distribution between lenticular and ellipticalgalaxies is a robust conclusion as the models generate consistent relative agesusing different age and metallicity indicators even though the absolute agesremain uncertain. the young luminosity weighted ages of the s0s in the fornaxcluster are consistent with the recent discovery that the fraction of s0galaxies in intermediate redshift clusters is a factor of 2-3 lower than foundlocally and suggests that a fraction of the cluster spiral galaxy populationhas evolved to quiescence in the 5 gyr interval from z=0.5 to the present. twoof the faintest lenticular galaxies in our sample have blue continua and strongbalmer-line absorption suggesting starbursts \la2 gyrs ago. these may be thelow redshift analogues of the starburst or post-starburst galaxies seen inclusters at z=0.3, similar to the hdelta strong galaxies in the coma cluster.

astro-ph;9811089	the peculiar motions of early-type galaxies in two distant regions - v.  the mg-sigma relation, age and metallicity	we examine the mg-sigma relation for early-type galaxies in the efar sampleand its dependence on cluster properties. a maximum likelihood fit gives globalmg-sigma relations of mgb'=0.131log(sigma)-0.131 and mg2=0.257log(sigma)-0.305,with intrinsic scatter of 0.016 mag in mgb' and 0.023 mag in mg2. the zeropointfor cd galaxies is higher than for e/s0 galaxies, implying cds are older and/ormore metal-rich than e/s0s with the same sigma. mg-sigma zeropoint variationsbetween clusters are consistent with the number of galaxies observed percluster and the global intrinsic scatter in mg-sigma. we find no significantcorrelation between the mg-sigma zeropoint and the cluster velocity dispersion,x-ray luminosity or x-ray temperature over a wide range in cluster mass. wecompare the intrinsic scatter in the mg-sigma and fundamental plane (fp)relations with stellar population models to constrain the dispersion in ages,metallicities and m/l ratios for early-type galaxies at fixed sigma. variationsin age alone or metallicity alone cannot explain the measured intrinsic scatterin both mg-sigma and the fp. we derive the joint constraints on the dispersionin age and metallicity implied by the scatter in the mg-sigma and fp relationsfor a simple gaussian model. we find upper limits on the dispersions at fixedsigma of 32% in dt/t and 38% in dz/z if variations in age and metallicity areuncorrelated; only strongly anti-correlated variations lead to significantlyhigher upper limits. the joint distribution of residuals from the mg-sigma andfp relations is only marginally consistent with a model having no correlationbetween age and metallicity, and is better-matched by a model in which age andmetallicity variations are moderately anti-correlated, with younger galaxiesbeing more metal-rich.

astro-ph;9811241	the peculiar motions of early-type galaxies in two distant regions - ii.  the spectroscopic data	we present the spectroscopic data for the galaxies studied in the efarproject, which is designed to measure the properties and peculiar motions ofearly-type galaxies in two distant regions. we have obtained 1319 spectra of714 early-type galaxies over 33 observing runs on 10 different telescopes. wedescribe the observations and data reductions used to measure redshifts,velocity dispersions and the mgb and mg2 lick linestrength indices. detailedsimulations and intercomparison of the large number of repeat observations leadto reliable error estimates for all quantities. the measurements from differentobserving runs are calibrated to a common zeropoint or scale before beingcombined, yielding a total of 706 redshifts, 676 velocity dispersions, 676 mgblinestrengths and 582 mg2 linestrengths. the median estimated errors in thecombined measurements are dcz=20 km/s, dsigma/sigma=9.1%, dmgb/mgb=7.2% anddmg2=0.015 mag. comparison of our measurements with published datasets shows nosystematic errors in the redshifts or velocity dispersions and only smallzeropoint corrections to bring our linestrengths onto the standard lick system.we have assigned galaxies to physical clusters by examining the line-of-sightvelocity distributions based on efar and zcat redshifts, together with theprojected distributions on the sky. we derive mean redshifts and velocitydispersions for these clusters, which will be used in estimating distances andpeculiar velocities and to test for trends in the galaxy population withcluster mass. the spectroscopic parameters presented here for 706 galaxiescombine high quality data, uniform reduction and measurement procedures, anddetailed error analysis. they form the largest single set of velocitydispersions and linestrengths for early-type galaxies published to date.

astro-ph;9910479	the frequency of barred spiral galaxies in the near-ir	we have determined the fraction of barred galaxies in the h-band for astatistically well-defined sample of 186 spirals drawn from the ohio stateuniversity bright spiral galaxy survey. we find 56% of our sample to bestrongly barred at h, while another 16% is weakly barred. only 27% of oursample is unbarred in the near-infrared. the rc3 and the carnegie atlas ofgalaxies both classify only about 30% of our sample as strongly barred. thusstrong bars are nearly twice as prevalent in the near-infrared as in theoptical. the frequency of genuine optically hidden bars is significant, butlower than many claims in the literature: 40% of the galaxies in our samplethat are classified as unbarred in the rc3 show evidence for a bar in theh-band, while for the carnegie atlas this fraction is 66%. our data reveal nosignificant trend in bar fraction as a function of morphology in either theoptical or h-band. optical surveys of high redshift galaxies may be stronglybiased against finding bars, as bars are increasingly difficult to detect atbluer rest wavelengths.
