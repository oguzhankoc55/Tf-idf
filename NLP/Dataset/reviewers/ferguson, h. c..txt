0901.4364	spectroscopic observations of lyman-break galaxies at redshift ~ 4, 5  and 6 in the goods-south field	we report on observations of lyman-break galaxies (lbgs) selected from thegreat observatories origins deep survey at mean redshift z~4, 5 and 6, obtainedwith fors2 spectrograph at the eso-vlt.this program has yielded spectroscopicidentifications for 114 galaxies of which 51 are at z~4, 31 at z~5, and 32 atz~6. the adopted selection criteria are effective, identifying galaxies at theexpected redshift with minimal foreground contamination. once selection effectsare properly accounted for, the rest-frame uv spectra of the higher-redshiftlbgs appear to be similar to their counterparts at z~3. as at z~3, lbgs at z~4and z~5 show lya both in emission and in absorption; when in absorption, stronginterstellar lines and red uv spectra are observed, a fact also measured at z~2and 3. at z~6, sensitivity issues bias our sample towards galaxies with lya inemission; nevertheless, these spectra appear to be similar to theirlower-redshift counterparts. as in other studies at similar redshifts, we findclear evidence that brighter lbgs tend to have weaker lya emission lines. atfixed rest-frame uv luminosity, the equivalent width of the lya emission lineis larger at higher redshifts. at all redshifts where the measurements can bereliably made, the redshift of the lya emission line turns out to be largerthan that of the interstellar absorption lines,with a median velocitydifference deltav~400 km/s at z~4 and 5, consistent with results at lowerredshifts. this shows that powerful, large-scale winds are common at highredshift.in general,there is no strong correlation between the morphology ofthe uv light and the spectroscopic properties. however, galaxies with deepinterstellar absorption lines and strong lya absorption appear to be morediffuse than galaxies with lya in emission.(abridged)

0902.0384	evidence for a non-uniform initial mass function in the local universe	many results in modern astrophysics rest on the notion that the initial massfunction (imf) is universal. our observations of hi selected galaxies in thelight of h-alpha and the far-ultraviolet (fuv) challenge this notion. the fluxratio h-alpha/fuv from these two star formation tracers shows strongcorrelations with the surface-brightness in h-alpha and the r band: low surfacebrightness (lsb) galaxies have lower ratios compared to high surface brightnessgalaxies and to expectations from equilibrium star formation models usingcommonly favored imf parameters. weaker but significant correlations ofh-alpha/fuv with luminosity, rotational velocity and dynamical mass are foundas well as a systematic trend with morphology. the correlated variations ofh-alpha/fuv with other global parameters are thus part of the larger family ofgalaxy scaling relations. the h-alpha/fuv correlations can not be due to dustcorrection errors, while systematic variations in the star formation historycan not explain the trends with both h-alpha and r surface brightness. lsbgalaxies are unlikely to have a higher escape fraction of ionizing photonsconsidering their high gas fraction, and color-magnitude diagrams. the mostplausible explanation for the correlations are systematic variations of theupper mass limit and/or slope of the imf at the upper end. we outline ascenario of pressure driving the correlations by setting the efficiency of theformation of the dense star clusters where the highest mass stars form. ourresults imply that the star formation rate measured in a galaxy is highlysensitive to the tracer used in the measurement. a non-universal imf also callsinto question the interpretation of metal abundance patterns in dwarf galaxiesand star formation histories derived from color magnitude diagrams. abridged.

0706.2653	the udf05 follow-up of the hudf: i. the faint-end slope of the  lyman-break galaxy population at z~5	we present the udf05 project, a hst large program of deep acs (f606w, f775w,f850lp) and nicmos (f110w, f160w) imaging of three fields, two of whichcoincide with the nicp1-4 nicmos parallel observations of the hubble ultra deepfield (hudf). in this first paper we use the acs data for the nicp12 field, aswell as the original hudf acs data, to measure the uv luminosity function (lf)of z~5 lyman break galaxies (lbgs) down to very faint levels. specifically,based on a v-i, i-z selection criterion, we identify a sample of 101 and 133candidate z~5 galaxies down to z_{850}=28.5 and 29.25 magnitudes in the nicp12and in the hudf fields, respectively. using an extensive set of monte carlosimulations we derive corrections for observational biases and selectioneffects, and construct the rest-frame 1400 a lbg lf over the rangem_{1400}=[-21.4, -17.1], i.e. down to ~0.04 l* at z~5, and complement it withdata from the subaru deep field (sdf) from yoshida et al. (2006) to extend itto the brighter end (m_{1400}&gt;-22.2). we show that: (i) different assumptionsregarding the sed distribution of the lbg population, dust properties andintergalactic absorption result in a 25% variation in the number density oflbgs at z~5; (ii) under consistent assumptions for dust properties andintergalactic absorption, the hudf is about 30% under-dense in z~5 lbgsrelative to the nicp12 field, a variation which is well explained by cosmicvariance; (iii) the faint-end slope of the lf is independent of the specificassumptions for the input physical parameters, and has a value of alpha ~ -1.6,similar to the faint-end slope of the lf that has been measured for lbgs at z~3and z~6.

0906.1123	the hst/acs coma cluster survey: v - compact stellar systems in the coma  cluster	the hst acs coma cluster treasury survey is a deep two passband imagingsurvey of the nearest very rich cluster of galaxies, covering a range of galaxydensity environments. the imaging is complemented by a recent wide fieldredshift survey of the cluster conducted with hectospec on the 6.5m mmt. amongthe many scientific applications for this data are the search for compactgalaxies. in this paper, we present the discovery of seven compact (but quiteluminous) stellar systems, ranging from m32-like galaxies down to ultra-compactdwarfs (ucds)/dwarf to globular transition objects (dgtos). we find that allseven compact galaxies require a two-component fit to their light profile andhave measured velocity dispersions that exceed those expected for typicalearly-type galaxies at their luminosity. from our structural parameter analysiswe conclude that three of the sample should be classified as compactellipticals or m32-like galaxies, the remaining four being less extremesystems. the three compact ellipticals are all found to have old luminosityweighted ages (&gt; 12 gyr), intermediate metallicities (-0.6 &lt; [fe/h] &lt; -0.1) andhigh [mg/fe] (&gt; 0.25). our findings support a tidal stripping scenario as theformation mode of compact galaxies covering the luminosity range studied here.we speculate that at least two early-type morphologies may serve as theprogenitor of compact galaxies in clusters.

0911.1791	outlying hii regions in hi-selected galaxies	we present results from the first systematic search for outlying hii regions,as part of a sample of 96 emission-line point sources (referred to as eldots -emission-line dots) derived from the noao survey for ionization in neutral gasgalaxies (singg). our automated eldot-finder searches singg narrow-band andcontinuum images for high equivalent width point sources outside the opticalradius of the target galaxy (&gt; 2 x r25 in the r-band). follow-up longslitspectroscopy and deep galex images (exposure time &gt; 1000 s) distinguishoutlying hii regions from background galaxies whose strong emission lines([oiii], hbeta or [oii]) have been redshifted into the singg bandpass. we findthat these deep galex images can serve as a substitute for spectroscopicfollow-up because outlying hii regions separate cleanly from backgroundgalaxies in color-color space. we identify seven singg systems with outlyingmassive star formation that span a large range in halpha luminositiescorresponding to a few o stars in the most nearby cases, and unresolved dwarfsatellite companion galaxies in the most distant cases. six of these sevensystems feature galaxies with nearby companions or interacting galaxies.furthermore, our results indicate that some outlying hii regions are linked tothe extended-uv disks discovered by galex, representing emission from the mostmassive o stars among a more abundant population of lower mass (or older) starclusters. the overall frequency of outlying hii regions in this sample ofgas-rich galaxies is 8 - 11% when we correct for background emission-linegalaxy contamination (~75% of eldots).

0708.0826	stellar populations across the ngc4244 truncated galactic disk	we use hst/acs to study the resolved stellar populations of the nearby,nearly edge-on galaxy ngc4244 across its outer disk surface density break. thestellar photometry allows us to study the distribution of different stellarpopulations and reach very low equivalent surface brightnesses. we find thatthe break occurs at the same radius for young, intermediate age, and old stars.the stellar density beyond the break drops sharply by a factor of at least 600in 5 kpc. the break occurs at the same radius independent of height above thedisk, but is sharpest in the midplane and nearly disappears at large heights.these results make it unlikely that truncations are caused by a star formationthreshold alone: the threshold would have to keep the same radial position fromless than 100 myr to 10 gyr ago, in spite of potential disturbances such asinfall and redistribution of gas by internal processes. a dynamicalinterpretation of truncation formation is more likely such as due to angularmomentum redistribution by bars or density waves, or heating and stripping ofstars caused by the bombardment of dark matter sub-halos. the latterexplanation is also in quantitative agreement with the small diffuse componentwe see around the galaxy.

1103.1218	the hst/acs coma cluster survey: vii - colour gradients in giant and  dwarf early-type galaxies	using deep, high-spatial resolution imaging from the hst acs coma clustertreasury survey, we determine colour profiles of early-type galaxies in thecoma cluster. from 176 galaxies brighter than $m_\mathrm{f814w(ab)} = -15$ magthat are either spectroscopically confirmed members of coma or identified byeye as likely members from their low surface brightness, data are provided for142 early-type galaxies. typically, colour profiles are linear against$\log(r)$, sometimes with a nuclear region of distinct, often bluer colourassociated with nuclear clusters. colour gradients are determined for theregions outside the nuclear components. we find that almost all colourgradients are negative, both for elliptical and lenticular galaxies. mostlikely, earlier studies that report positive colour gradients in dwarf galaxiesare affected by the bluer colours of the nuclear clusters, underlining thathigh resolution data are essential to disentangle the colour properties of thedifferent morphological components in galaxies. colour gradients of dwarfgalaxies form a continuous sequence with those of elliptical galaxies, becomingshallower toward fainter magnitudes. interpreting the colours as metallicitytracers, our data suggest that dwarfs as well as giant early-type galaxies inthe coma cluster are less metal rich in their outer parts. we do not findevidence for environmental influence on the gradients, although we note thatmost of our galaxies are found in the central regions of the cluster. for asubset of galaxies with known morphological types, s0 galaxies have less steepgradients than elliptical galaxies.

1103.3469	absolute flux calibration of the irac instrument on the spitzer space  telescope using hubble space telescope flux standards	the absolute flux calibration of the james webb space telescope will be basedon a set of stars observed by the hubble and spitzer space telescopes. in orderto cross-calibrate the two facilities, several a, g, and white dwarf (wd) starsare observed with both spitzer and hubble and are the prototypes for a set ofjwst calibration standards. the flux calibration constants for the four spitzerirac bands 1-4 are derived from these stars and are 2.3, 1.9, 2.0, and 0.5%lower than the official cold-mission irac calibration of reach et al.

1105.2537	goods-herschel: an infrared main sequence for star-forming galaxies	we present the deepest far-ir observations obtained with herschel and examinethe 3-500um seds of galaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;2.5, supplemented by a local referencesample from iras, iso, spitzer and akari data. we find that the ratio of totalir luminosity to rest-frame 8um luminosity, ir8 (=lir/l8), follows a gaussiandistribution centered on ir8=4 and defines an ir main sequence (ms). a minoritypopulation (&lt;20 %) of outliers producing a tail skewed toward higher values ofir8 consist of starbursts (sb) with compact projected star formation densities.ir8 can be used to separate galaxies with normal and extended modes of starformation from compact sbs with high-ir8, high projected ir surface brightness(&gt;3x10^10 lsun kpc^-2) and a high specific sfr (i.e., sbs). the rest-frame,uv-2700a size of these distant sbs is typically half that of ms galaxies,supporting the correlation between star formation density and sb activity thatis measured for the local sample. locally, (u)lirgs are systematically in thesb mode, whereas most distant (u)lirgs form stars in the "normal" ms mode. thisconfusion between two modes of star formation is the cause of the so-called"mid-ir excess" population of galaxies found at z&gt;1.5 by previous studies. msgalaxies have strong pah emission line features, a broad far-ir bump resultingfrom a combination of dust temperatures (tdust~15-50 k), and an effectivetdust~31 k, as derived from the peak wavelength of their ir sed. galaxies inthe sb regime instead exhibit weak pah ew and a sharper far-ir bump with aneffective tdust~40 k. finally, we present evidence that the mid-to-far iremission of x-ray agns is predominantly produced by star formation and thatcandidate dusty agns with a power-law emission in the mid-ir systematicallyoccur in compact, dusty sbs. after correcting for the effect of sbs on ir8, weidentify new candidates for extremely obscured agns.

0710.0406	a population of massive and evolved galaxies at z$\ga$5	we report results from a search for massive and evolved galaxies at z&gt;5 inthe goods southern field. combining hst acs, vlt isaac and spitzer iracphotometric data, we develop a color selection technique to identify candidatesfor being evolved galaxies at high redshifts. the color selection is primarilybased on locating the balmer-break using the k- and 3.6micron bands. stellarpopulation synthesis models are fitted to the seds of these galaxies toidentify the final sample. we find 11 candidates with photometric redshifts inthe range 4.9 &lt; z &lt; 6.5, dominated by an old stellar population, with ages0.2-1.0 gyr, and stellar masses in the range (0.5 - 5) 10^{11} msun. themajority of the stars in these galaxies were formed at z &gt; 9. one candidate hasa spectroscopically confirmed redshift, in good agreement with our photometricredshift. the galaxies are very compact, with half-light radii in the observedk-band smaller than ~2 kpc. seven of the 11 candidates are also detected at24micron with the mips instrument on spitzer. the 24micron emission could beinterpreted as pah emission from a dusty starburst at z~2-3, however, it isalso consistent with the presence of an obscured agn at z&gt;5. we estimate thecompleteness of the balmer break galaxy sample to be ~40%. the comoving numberdensity of galaxies with a stellar mass &gt;10^{11} msun, at an average redshiftz=5.2, is 3.9 10^{-5} mpc^{-3} (no-mips sample: 1.4 10^{-5} mpc^{-3}). thecorresponding stellar mass density is 8 10^{6} msun/mpc^3 (no-mips sample: 6.210^6 msun/mpc^3).

1107.5256	extreme emission line galaxies in candels: broad-band selected,  star-bursting dwarf galaxies at z&gt;1	we identify an abundant population of extreme emission line galaxies (eelgs)at redshift z~1.7 in the cosmic assembly near-ir deep extragalactic legacysurvey (candels) imaging from hubble space telescope/wide field camera 3(hst/wfc3). 69 eelg candidates are selected by the large contribution ofexceptionally bright emission lines to their near-infrared broad-bandmagnitudes. supported by spectroscopic confirmation of strong [oiii] emissionlines -- with rest-frame equivalent widths ~1000\aa -- in the four candidatesthat have hst/wfc3 grism observations, we conclude that these objects aregalaxies with 10^8 msol in stellar mass, undergoing an enormous starburst phasewith m_*/(dm_*/dt) of only ~15 myr. these bursts may cause outflows that arestrong enough to produce cored dark matter profiles in low-mass galaxies. theindividual star formation rates and the co-moving number density (3.7x10^-4mpc^-3) can produce in ~4 gyr much of the stellar mass density that ispresently contained in 10^8-10^9 msol dwarf galaxies. therefore, ourobservations provide a strong indication that many or even most of the stars inpresent-day dwarf galaxies formed in strong, short-lived bursts, mostly at z&gt;1.

1110.3821	caught in the act: the assembly of massive cluster galaxies at z=1.62	we present the recent merger history of massive galaxies in aspectroscopically-confirmed proto-cluster at z=1.62. using hst wfc3near-infrared imaging from the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalacticlegacy survey (candels), we select cluster galaxies and z ~ 1.6 field galaxieswith m_star &gt;= 3 x 10^10 m_sun, and determine the frequency of double nuclei orclose companions with projected separations less than 20 kpc co-moving andstellar mass ratios between 1:1 and roughly 10:1. we find that four out of fivespectroscopically-confirmed massive proto-cluster galaxies have double nuclei,and 42 +13/-25 % of all m_star &gt;= 3 x 10^10 m_sun cluster candidates are eitherin close pair systems or have double nuclei. in contrast, only 4.5 +/- 2.6% ofthe field galaxies are in close pair/double nuclei systems. the implied mergerrate per massive galaxy in the proto-cluster is 3-10 times higher than themerger rate of massive field galaxies at z ~ 1.6, depending upon the assumedmass ratios. close pairs in the cluster have minor merger stellar mass ratios(m_primary:m_satellite ~ 6:1), while the field pairs are typically majormergers with stellar mass ratios between 1:1 and 4:1. at least half of thecluster mergers are dissipationless, as indicated by their red colors and low24 micron fluxes. two of the double-nucleated cluster members have x-raydetected agn with l_x &gt; 10^43 erg/s, and are strong candidates for dual oroffset super-massive black holes. we conclude that the massive z = 1.62proto-cluster galaxies are undergoing accelerated assembly relative to thefield population, and discuss the implications for galaxy evolution inproto-cluster environments.

1206.4322	the morphologies of massive galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;3 in the candels-uds field:  compact bulges, and the rise and fall of massive disks	we have used deep, hst, near-ir imaging to study the morphological propertiesof the most massive galaxies at high z, modelling the wfc3/ir h-band images ofthe ~200 galaxies in the candels-uds field with 1 &lt; z_phot &lt; 3, and stellarmasses m_star &gt; 10^11 m_sun. we have used both single-sersic and bulge+diskmodels, have investigated the errors/biases introduced by uncertainties in thebackground and the psf, and have obtained formally-acceptable model fits to&gt;90% of the galaxies. our results indicate that these massive galaxies at 1 &lt; z&lt; 3 lie both on and below the local size-mass relation, with a median r_e~2.6kpc, a factor of ~2.3 smaller than comparably-massive local galaxies. moreover,we find that bulge-dominated objects in particular show evidence for a growingbimodality in the size-mass relation with increasing z, and by z &gt; 2 thecompact bulges display effective radii a factor ~4 smaller than localellipticals of comparable mass. these trends appear to extend to the bulgecomponents of disk-dominated galaxies, and vice versa. we also find that, whilesuch massive galaxies at low z are bulge-dominated, at 1 &lt; z &lt; 2 they arepredominantly mixed bulge+disk systems, and by z &gt; 2 they are mostlydisk-dominated. the majority of the disk-dominated galaxies are activelyforming stars, but this is also true for many of the bulge-dominated systems.interestingly, however, while most of the quiescent galaxies arebulge-dominated, we find that a significant fraction (25-40%) of the mostquiescent galaxies have disk-dominated morphologies. thus, while our resultsshow that the massive galaxy population is undergoing dramatic changes at thiscrucial epoch, they also suggest that the physical mechanisms which quenchstar-formation activity are not simply connected to those responsible for themorphological transformation of massive galaxies into present-day giantellipticals.

1207.2727	the ages, masses and star-formation rates of spectroscopically confirmed  z~6 galaxies in candels	we report the results of a study exploring the stellar populations of 13luminous (l&gt;l*), spectroscopically confirmed, galaxies in the redshift interval5.5&lt;z&lt;6.5, all with wfc3/ir and irac imaging from the hst/candels andspitzer/seds surveys. based on fitting the observed photometry with sedtemplates covering a wide range of different star-formation histories, and aself consistent treatment of lyman-alpha emission, we find that the derivedstellar masses lie within the range 10^9 msun &lt; m*&lt; 10^10 msun and are robustto within a factor of two. in contrast, we confirm previous reports that theages of the stellar populations are poorly constrained. although thebest-fitting models for three objects have ages &gt;= 300 myr, the degeneraciesintroduced by dust extinction mean that only two of these objects actuallyrequire a &gt;300 myr old stellar population to reproduce the observed photometry.moreover, when considering only smoothly-varying star-formation histories, weobserve a clear tension between the data and models such that a galaxy sedtemplate with an old age is often chosen in order to try and fit objects withblue uv-slopes but red uv-to-optical colours. to break this tension we exploresed fitting with two-component models (burst plus on-going star-formation) andallow for nebular emission. on average, the inclusion of nebular emission leadsto lower stellar-mass estimates (median offset 0.18 dex), moderately higherspecific star-formation rates, and allows for a wider range of plausiblestellar ages. however, based on our sed modelling, we find no strong evidencefor extremely young ages in our sample (&lt;50 myr). finally, considering all ofthe different star-formation histories explored, we find that the medianbest-fitting ages are of the order 200-300 myr and that the objects with thetightest constraints indicate ages in the range 50-200 myr (abridged).

1208.0506	the size-luminosity relation at z=7 in candels and its implication on  reionization	the exploration of the relation between galaxy sizes and other physicalparameters has provided important clues for understanding galaxy formation. weuse the candels deep+wide surveys in the goods-south, uds and egs fields,complemented by data from the hudf09 program, to address the relation betweensize and luminosity at z\sim7. we select 153 z-band drop-out galaxies in sixdifferent fields characterized by a wide combination of depth and arealcoverage, ideally suited to sample without biases the observed size-magnitudeplane. detailed simulations allow us to derive the completeness as a functionof size and magnitude and to quantify measurements errors/biases. we find thatthe half light radius distribution function of z\sim7 galaxies fainter thanj=26.6 is peaked at &lt;0.1 arcsec (or equivalently 0.5 kpc proper), while atbrighter magnitudes high-z galaxies are typically larger than ~0.15 arcsec. wealso find a well defined size-luminosity relation, rh\siml^1/2. we compute theluminosity function in the hudf and p12hudf fields, finding large spatialvariation on the number density of faint galaxies. adopting the sizedistribution and the size-luminosity relation found for faint galaxies at z=7,we derive a mean slope of -1.7\pm0.1 for the luminosity function of lbgs atthis redshift. using this lf, we find that the amount of ionizing photonscannot keep the universe re-ionized if the igm is clumpy (c_hii&gt;3) and thelyman continuum escape fraction of high-z lbgs is relatively low (f_esc&lt;0.3).with future candels data, we can put severe limits to the role of galaxies inthe reionization of the universe.

1208.3464	the properties of (sub)millimetre-selected galaxies as revealed by  candels hst wfc3/ir imaging in goods-south	we have exploited the hst candels wfc3/ir imaging to study the properties of(sub-)mm galaxies in goods-south. after using the deep radio and spitzerimaging to identify galaxy counterparts for the (sub-)mm sources, we have usedthe new candels data in two ways. first, we have derived improved photometricredshifts and stellar masses, confirming that the (sub-)mm galaxies are massive(&lt;m*&gt;=2.2x10^11 m_solar) galaxies at z=1-3. second, we have exploited the depthand resolution of the wfc3/ir imaging to determine the sizes and morphologiesof the galaxies at rest-frame optical wavelengths, fitting two-dimensionalaxi-symmetric sersic models. crucially, the wfc3/ir h-band imaging enablesmodelling of the mass-dominant galaxy, rather than the blue high-surfacebrightness features which often dominate optical (rest-frame uv) images of(sub-)mm galaxies, and can confuse visual morphological classification. as aresult of this analysis we find that &gt;95% of the rest-frame optical light inalmost all of the (sub-)mm galaxies is well-described by either a singleexponential disk, or a multiple-component system in which the dominantconstituent is disk-like. we demonstrate that this conclusion is consistentwith the results of high-quality ground-based k-band imaging, and explain why.the massive disk galaxies which host luminous (sub-)mm emission are reasonablyextended (r_e=4 kpc), consistent with the sizes of other massive star-formingdisks at z~2. in many cases we find evidence of blue clumps within the sources,with the mass-dominant disk becoming more significant at longer wavelengths.finally, only a minority of the sources show evidence for a major galaxy-galaxyinteraction. taken together, these results support the view that most (sub-)mmgalaxies at z~2 are simply the most extreme examples of normal star-forminggalaxies at that era.

1211.6954	structural parameters of galaxies in candels	we present global structural parameter measurements of 109,533 unique,h_f160w-selected objects from the candels multi-cycle treasury program. sersicmodel fits for these objects are produced with galfit in all availablenear-infrared filters (h_f160w, j_f125w and, for a subset, y_f105w). theparameters of the best-fitting sersic models (total magnitude, half-lightradius, sersic index, axis ratio, and position angle) are made public, alongwith newly constructed point spread functions for each field and filter. randomuncertainties in the measured parameters are estimated for each individualobject based on a comparison between multiple, independent measurements of thesame set of objects. to quantify systematic uncertainties we create a mosaicwith simulated galaxy images with a realistic distribution of input parametersand then process and analyze the mosaic in an identical manner as the realdata. we find that accurate and precise measurements -- to 10% or better -- ofall structural parameters can typically be obtained for galaxies with h_f160w &lt;23, with comparable fidelity for basic size and shape measurements for galaxiesto h_f160w ~ 24.5.

1304.4227	discovery of lyman break galaxies at z~7 from the zfourge survey	star-forming galaxies at redshifts z&gt;6 are likely responsible for thereionization of the universe, and it is important to study the nature of thesegalaxies. we present three candidates for z~7 lyman-break galaxies (lbgs) froma 155 arcmin^2 area in the candels/cosmos field imaged by the deep fourstargalaxy evolution (zfourge) survey. the fourstar medium-band filters provide theequivalent of r~10 spectroscopy, which cleanly distinguishes between z~7 lbgsand brown dwarf stars. the distinction between stars and galaxies based on anobject's angular size can become unreliable even when using hst imaging; thereexists at least one very compact z~7 candidate (fwhm~0.5-1 kpc) that isindistinguishable from a point source. the medium-band filters provide narrowerredshift distributions compared with broad-band-derived redshifts. the uvluminosity function derived using the three z~7 candidates is consistent withprevious studies, suggesting an evolution at the bright end (muv -21.6 mag)from z~7 to z~5. fitting the galaxies' spectral energy distributions, wepredict lyman-alpha equivalent widths for the two brightest lbgs, and find thatthe presence of a lyman-alpha line affects the medium-band flux therebychanging the constraints on stellar masses and uv spectral slopes. thisillustrates the limitations of deriving lbg properties using only broad-bandphotometry. the derived specific star-formation rates for the bright lbgs are~13 per gyr, slightly higher than the lower-luminosity lbgs, implying that thestar-formation rate increases with stellar mass for these galaxies.

1310.6031	a rapidly star-forming galaxy 700 million years after the big bang at  z=7.51	out of several dozen z &gt; 7 candidate galaxies observed spectroscopically,only five have been confirmed via lyman-alpha emission, at z=7.008, 7.045,7.109, 7.213 and 7.215. the small fraction of confirmed galaxies may indicatethat the neutral fraction in the intergalactic medium (igm) rises quickly at z&gt; 6.5, as lyman-alpha is resonantly scattered by neutral gas. however, thesmall samples and limited depth of previous observations makes theseconclusions tentative. here we report the results of a deep near-infraredspectroscopic survey of 43 z &gt; 6.5 galaxies. we detect only a single galaxy,confirming that some process is making lyman-alpha difficult to detect. thedetected emission line at 1.0343 um is likely to be lyman-alpha emission,placing this galaxy at a redshift z = 7.51, an epoch 700 million years afterthe big bang. this galaxy's colors are consistent with significant metalcontent, implying that galaxies become enriched rapidly. we measure asurprisingly high star formation rate of 330 msol/yr, more than a factor of 100greater than seen in the milky way. such a galaxy is unexpected in a survey ofour size, suggesting that the early universe may harbor more intense sites ofstar-formation than expected.

1312.4975	the colour distribution of galaxies at redshift five	we present the results of a study investigating the rest-frame ultra-violet(uv) spectral slopes of redshift z~5 lyman-break galaxies (lbgs). by combiningdeep hubble space telescope imaging of the candels and hudf fields withground-based imaging from the ukidss ultra deep survey (uds), we have produceda large sample of z~5 lbgs spanning an unprecedented factor of &gt;100 in uvluminosity. based on this sample we find a clear colour-magnitude relation(cmr) at z~5, such that the rest-frame uv slopes (beta) of brighter galaxiesare notably redder than their fainter counterparts. we determine that the z~5cmr is well described by a linear relationship of the form: d beta = (-0.12 +/-0.02) d muv, with no clear evidence for a change in cmr slope at faintmagnitudes (i.e. muv &gt; -18.9). using the results of detailed simulations we areable, for the first time, to infer the intrinsic (i.e. free from noise)variation of galaxy colours around the cmr at z~5. we find significant (12sigma) evidence for intrinsic colour variation in the sample as a whole. ourresults also demonstrate that the width of the intrinsic uv slope distributionof z~5 galaxies increases from delta(beta)=0.1 at muv=-18 to delta(beta)=0.4 atmuv=-21. we suggest that the increasing width of the intrinsic galaxy colourdistribution and the cmr itself are both plausibly explained by a luminosityindependent lower limit of beta=-2.1, combined with an increase in the fractionof red galaxies in brighter uv-luminosity bins.

1403.0743	constraints on the star-formation rate of z~3 lbgs with measured  metallicity in the candels goods-south field	we analyse 14 lbgs at z~2.8-3.8 constituting the only sample where both aspectroscopic measurement of their metallicity and deep ir observations(candels+hugs survey) are available. fixing the metallicity of populationsynthesis models to the observed values, we determine best-fit physicalparameters under different assumptions about the star-formation history andalso consider the effect of nebular emission. for comparison we determine theuv slope of the objects, and use it to estimate their sfr_uv99 by correctingthe uv luminosity following meurer et al. (1999). a comparison between sfrobtained through sed-fitting (sfr_fit) and the sfr_uv99 shows that the latterare underestimated by a factor 2-10, regardless of the assumed sfh. other sfrindicators (radio, far-ir, x-ray, recombination lines) coherently indicate sfrsa factor of 2-4 larger than sfr_uv99 and in closer agreement with sfr_fit. thisdiscrepancy is due to the solar metallicity implied by the usual beta-a1600conversion factor. we propose a refined relation, appropriate for sub-solarmetallicity lbgs: a1600 = 5.32+1.99beta. this relation reconciles thedust-corrected uv with the sed-fitting and the other sfr indicators. we showthat the fact that z~3 galaxies have sub-solar metallicity implies an upwardrevision by a factor of ~1.5-2 of the global sfrd, depending on the assumptionsabout the age of the stellar populations. we find very young best-fit ages(10-500 myrs) for all our objects. from a careful examination of theuncertainties in the fit and the amplitude of the balmer break we conclude thatthere is little evidence of the presence of old stellar population in at leasthalf of the lbgs in our sample, suggesting that these objects are probablycaught during a huge star-formation burst, rather than being the result of asmooth evolution.

1404.2844	3d-hst+candels: the evolution of the galaxy size-mass distribution since  $z=3$	spectroscopic + photometric redshifts, stellar mass estimates, and rest-framecolors from the 3d-hst survey are combined with structural parametermeasurements from candels imaging to determine the galaxy size-massdistribution over the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;3. separating early- and late-typegalaxies on the basis of star-formation activity, we confirm that early-typegalaxies are on average smaller than late-type galaxies at all redshifts, andfind a significantly different rate of average size evolution at fixed galaxymass, with fast evolution for the early-type population, r_eff ~ (1+z)^-1.48,and moderate evolution for the late-type population, r_eff ~ (1+z)^-0.75. thelarge sample size and dynamic range in both galaxy mass and redshift, incombination with the high fidelity of our measurements due to the extensive useof spectroscopic data, not only fortify previous results, but also enable us toprobe beyond simple average galaxy size measurements. at all redshifts theslope of the size-mass relation is shallow, r_eff ~ m_star^0.22, for late-typegalaxies with stellar mass &gt;3x10^9 m_sol, and steep, r_eff m_star^0.75, forearly-type galaxies with stellar mass &gt;2x10^10 m_sol. the intrinsic scatter is&lt;~0.2 dex for all galaxy types and redshifts. for late-type galaxies, thelogarithmic size distribution is not symmetric, but skewed toward small sizes:at all redshifts and masses a tail of small late-type galaxies exists thatoverlaps in size with the early-type galaxy population. the number density ofmassive (~10^11 m_sol), compact (r_eff &lt; 2 kpc) early-type galaxies increasesfrom z=3 to z=1.5-2 and then strongly decreases at later cosmic times.

1405.1736	the bulge-disk decomposed evolution of massive galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;3 in  candels	we present the results of a new and improved study of the morphological andspectral evolution of massive galaxies over the redshift range 1&lt;z&lt;3. ouranalysis is based on a bulge-disk decomposition of 396 galaxies withmstar&gt;10^11 msolar from the candels wfc3/ir imaging within the cosmos andukidss uds survey fields. we find that, by modelling the h(160) image of eachgalaxy with a combination of a de vaucouleurs bulge (sersic index n=4) and anexponential disk (n=1), we can then lock all derived morphological parametersfor the bulge and disk components, and successfully reproduce theshorter-wavelength j(125), i(814), v(606) hst images simply by floating themagnitudes of the two components. this then yields sub-divided 4-band hstphotometry for the bulge and disk components which, with no additional priors,is well described by spectrophotometric models of galaxy evolution. armed withthis information we are able to properly determine the masses andstar-formation rates for the bulge and disk components, and find that: i) fromz=3 to z=1 the galaxies move from disk-dominated to increasinglybulge-dominated, but very few galaxies are pure bulges/ellipticals by z=1; ii)while most passive galaxies are bulge-dominated, and most star-forming galaxiesdisk-dominated, 18+/-5% of passive galaxies are disk-dominated, and 11+/-3% ofstar-forming galaxies are bulge-dominated, a result which needs to be explainedby any model purporting to connect star-formation quenching with morphologicaltransformations; iii) there exists a small but significant population of purepassive disks, which are generally flatter than their star-forming counterparts(whose axial ratio distribution peaks at b/a~0.7); iv) flatter/larger disksre-emerge at the highest star-formation rates, consistent with recent studiesof sub-mm galaxies, and with the concept of a maximum surface-density forstar-formation activity.

1405.5221	the decomposed bulge and disk size-mass relations of massive galaxies at  1&lt;z&lt;3 in candels	we have constructed a mass-selected sample of mstar&gt;10^11msolar galaxies at1&lt;z&lt;3 in the candels uds and cosmos fields and have decomposed these systemsinto their separate bulge and disk components according to their h(160)-bandmorphologies. by extending this analysis to multiple bands we have been able toconduct individual bulge and disk component sed fitting which has provided uswith stellar-mass and star-formation rate estimates for the separate bulge anddisk components. these have been combined with size measurements to explore theevolution of these massive high-redshift galaxies. by utilising the newdecomposed stellar-mass estimates, we confirm that the bulge components displaya stronger size evolution than the disks. this can be seen from both thefraction of bulge components which lie below the local relation and the mediansizes of the bulge components, where the bulges are a median factor of2.93+/-0.32 times smaller than similarly massive local galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;2 and3.41+/-0.58 smaller at 2&lt;z&lt;3; for the disks the corresponding factors are1.65+/-0.14 and 1.99+/-0.25. moreover, by splitting our sample into the passiveand star-forming bulge and disk sub-populations and examining their sizes as afraction of their present-day counter-parts, we find that the star-forming andpassive bulges are equally compact, star-forming disks are larger, while thepassive disks have intermediate sizes. this trend is not evident whenclassifying galaxy morphology on the basis of single-sersic fits and adoptingthe overall star-formation rates. finally, by evolving the star-formationhistories of the passive disks back to the redshifts when the passive diskswere last active, we show that the passive and star-forming disks haveconsistent sizes at the relevant epoch. these trends need to be reproduced byany mechanisms which attempt to explain the morphological evolution ofgalaxies.

1407.4233	geometry of star-forming galaxies from sdss, 3d-hst and candels	we determine the intrinsic, 3-dimensional shape distribution of star-forminggalaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;2.5, as inferred from their observed projected axis ratios. inthe present-day universe star-forming galaxies of all masses 1e9 - 1e11 msolare predominantly thin, nearly oblate disks, in line with previous studies. wenow extend this to higher redshifts, and find that among massive galaxies (m* &gt;1e10 msol) disks are the most common geometric shape at all z &lt; 2. lower-massgalaxies at z&gt;1 possess a broad range of geometric shapes: the fraction ofelongated (prolate) galaxies increases toward higher redshifts and lowermasses. galaxies with stellar mass 1e9 msol (1e10 msol) are a mix of roughlyequal numbers of elongated and disk galaxies at z~1 (z~2). this suggests thatgalaxies in this mass range do not yet have disks that are sustained over manyorbital periods, implying that galaxies with present-day stellar masscomparable to that of the milky way typically first formed such sustainedstellar disks at redshift z~1.5-2. combined with constraints on the evolutionof the star formation rate density and the distribution of star formation overgalaxies with different masses, our findings imply that, averaged over cosmictime, the majority of stars formed in disks.

1409.5122	the host galaxies of x-ray selected active galactic nuclei to z=2.5:  structure, star-formation and their relationships from candels and  herschel/pacs	we study the relationship between the structure and star-formation rate (sfr)of x-ray selected low and moderate luminosity active galactic nuclei (agns) inthe two chandra deep fields, using hubble space telescope imaging from thecosmic assembly near infrared extragalactic legacy survey (candels) and deepfar-infrared maps from the pep+goods-herschel survey. we derive detaileddistributions of structural parameters and fir luminosities from carefullyconstructed control samples of galaxies, which we then compare to those of theagns. at z~1, agns show slightly diskier light profiles than massive inactive(non-agn) galaxies, as well as modestly higher levels of gross galaxydisturbance (as measured by visual signatures of interactions and clumpystructure). in contrast, at z~2, agns show similar levels of galaxy disturbanceas inactive galaxies, but display a red central light enhancement, which mayarise due to a more pronounced bulge in agn hosts or due to extinguishednuclear light. we undertake a number of tests of these alternatives, but ourresults do not strongly favour one interpretation over the other. the mean sfrand its distribution among agns and inactive galaxies are similar at z&gt;1.5. atz&lt;1, however, clear and significant enhancements are seen in the sfrs of agnswith bulge-dominated light profiles. these trends suggest an evolution in therelation between nuclear activity and host properties with redshift, towards aminor role for mergers and interactions at z&gt;1.5.

1409.7082	the hawk-i uds and goods survey (hugs): survey design and deep k-band  number counts	we present the results of a new, ultra-deep, near-infrared imaging surveyexecuted with the hawk-i imager at the eso vlt, of which we make all the datapublic. this survey, named hugs (hawk-i uds and goods survey), provides deep,high-quality imaging in the k and y bands over the candels uds and goods-southfields. we describe here the survey strategy, the data reduction process, andthe data quality. hugs delivers the deepest and highest quality k-band imagesever collected over areas of cosmological interest, and ideally complements thecandels data set in terms of image quality and depth. the seeing is exceptionaland homogeneous, confined to the range 0.38"-0.43". in the deepest region ofthe goods-s field, (which includes most of the hudf) the k-band exposure timeexceeds 80 hours of integration, yielding a 1-sigma magnitude limit of ~28.0mag/sqarcsec. in the uds field the survey matches the shallower depth of thecandels images reaching a 1-sigma limit per sq.arcsec of ~27.3mag in the k bandand ~28.3mag in the y-band, we show that the hugs observations are well matchedto the depth of the candels wfc3/ir data, since the majority of even thefaintest galaxies detected in the candels h-band images are also detected inhugs. we present the k-band galaxy number counts produced by combining the hugsdata from the two fields. we show that the slope of the number counts dependssensitively on the assumed distribution of galaxy sizes, with potential impacton the estimated extra-galactic background light (abridged).

1412.0532	the galaxy stellar mass function at 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5 in the candels/uds,  goods-south, and hudf fields	the galaxy stellar mass function (gsmf) at high-z provides key information onstar-formation history and mass assembly in the young universe. we aimed to usethe unique combination of deep optical/nir/mir imaging provided by hst, spitzerand the vlt in the candels-uds, goods-south, and hudf fields to determine thegsmf over the redshift range 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5. we utilised the hst wfc3/ir nir imagingfrom candels and hudf09, reaching h~27-28.5 over a total area of 369 arcmin2,in combination with associated deep hst acs optical data, deep spitzer iracimaging from the seds programme, and deep y and k-band vlt hawk-i images fromthe hugs programme, to select a galaxy sample with high-quality photometricredshifts. these have been calibrated with more than 150 spectroscopicredshifts in the range 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5, resulting in an overall precision ofsigma_z/(1+z)~0.037. we have determined the low-mass end of the high-z gsmfwith unprecedented precision, reaching down to masses as low as m*~10^9 msun atz=4 and ~6x10^9 msun at z=7. we find that the gsmf at 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5 depends onlyslightly on the recipes adopted to measure the stellar masses, namely thephoto-z, the sfhs, the nebular contribution or the presence of agn on theparent sample. the low-mass end of the gsmf is steeper than has been found atlower redshifts, but appears to be unchanged over the redshift range probedhere. our results are very different from previous gsmf estimates based onconverting uv galaxy luminosity functions into mass functions via tight m/lrelations. integrating our evolving gsmf over mass, we find that the growth ofstellar mass density is barely consistent with the time-integral of the sfrdensity over cosmic time at z&gt;4. these results confirm the unique synergy ofthe candels+hudf, hugs, and seds surveys for the discovery and study ofmoderate/low-mass galaxies at high redshifts.

1412.5180	stellar masses from the candels survey: the goods-south and uds fields	we present the public release of the stellar mass catalogs for the goods-sand uds fields obtained using some of the deepest near-ir images available,achieved as part of the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacysurvey (candels) project. we combine the effort from ten different teams, whocomputed the stellar masses using the same photometry and the same redshifts.each team adopted their preferred fitting code, assumptions, priors, andparameter grid. the combination of results using the same underlying stellarisochrones reduces the systematics associated with the fitting code and otherchoices. thanks to the availability of different estimates, we can test theeffect of some specific parameters and assumptions on the stellar massestimate. the choice of the stellar isochrone library turns out to have thelargest effect on the galaxy stellar mass estimates, resulting in the largestdistributions around the median value (with a semi interquartile range largerthan 0.1 dex). on the other hand, for most galaxies, the stellar mass estimatesare relatively insensitive to the different parameterizations of the starformation history. the inclusion of nebular emission in the model spectra doesnot have a significant impact for the majority of galaxies (less than a factorof 2 for ~80% of the sample). nevertheless, the stellar mass for the subsampleof young galaxies (age &lt; 100 myr), especially in particular redshift ranges(e.g., 2.2 &lt; z &lt; 2.4, 3.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.6, and 5.5 &lt; z &lt; 6.5), can be seriouslyoverestimated (by up to a factor of 10 for &lt; 20 myr sources) if nebularcontribution is ignored.

0804.4874	the udf05 follow-up of the hudf: ii. constraints on reionization from  z-dropout galaxies	[abridged] we detect three (plus one less certain) z-dropout sources in twoseparate fields of our udf05 hst nicmos images. these z~7 lyman-break galaxy(lbg) candidates allow us to constrain the luminosity function (lf) of the starforming galaxy population at those epochs. by assuming a change in only m* andadopting a linear evolution in redshift, anchored to the measured values atz~6, the best fit evolution coefficient is found to be 0.43+-0.19 mag per unitredshift (0.36+-0.18, if including all four candidates), which provides a valueof m*(z=7.2)=-19.7+-0.3. this implies a steady evolution for the lbg lf out toz~7, at the same rate that is observed throughout the z~3 to 6 period. thisputs a strong constraint on the star-formation histories of z~6 galaxies, whoseensemble star-formation rate density must be lower by a factor 2 at ~170 myrbefore the epoch at which they are observed. in particular, a large fraction ofstars in the z~6 lbg population must form at redshifts well above z~7.extrapolating this steady evolution of the lf out to higher redshifts, weestimate that galaxies would be able to reionize the universe by z~6, providedthat the faint-end slope of the z&gt;7 lf steepens to alpha~-1.9, and that faintgalaxies, with luminosities below the current detection limits, contribute asubstantial fraction of the required ionizing photons. this scenario giveshowever an integrated optical depth to electron scattering that is ~2sigmabelow the wmap-5 measurement. therefore, altogether, our results indicate that,should galaxies be the primary contributors to reionization, either thecurrently detected evolution of the galaxy population slows down at z&gt;7, or thelf evolution must be compensated by a decrease in metallicity and acorresponding increase in ionization efficiency at these early epochs.

1506.01323	s-candels: the spitzer-cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic  survey. survey design, photometry, and deep irac source counts	the spitzer-cosmic assembly deep near-infrared extragalactic legacy survey(s-candels; pi g. fazio) is a cycle 8 exploration program designed to detectgalaxies at very high redshifts (z &gt; 5). to mitigate the effects of cosmicvariance and also to take advantage of deep coextensive coverage in multiplebands by the hubble space telescope multi-cycle treasury program candels,s-candels was carried out within five widely separated extragalactic fields:the ukidss ultra-deep survey, the extended chandra deep field south, cosmos,the hst deep field north, and the extended groth strip. s-candels builds uponthe existing coverage of these fields from the spitzer extended deep survey(seds) by increasing the integration time from 12 hours to a total of 50 hoursbut within a smaller area, 0.16 square degrees. the additional depthsignificantly increases the survey completeness at faint magnitudes. this paperdescribes the s-candels survey design, processing, and publicly-available dataproducts. we present irac dual-band 3.6+4.5 micron catalogs reaching to a depthof 26.5 ab mag. deep irac counts for the roughly 135,000 galaxies detected bys-candels are consistent with models based on known galaxy populations. theincrease in depth beyond earlier spitzer/irac surveys does not reveal asignificant additional contribution from discrete sources to the diffuse cosmicinfrared background (cib). thus it remains true that only roughly half of theestimated cib flux from cobe/dirbe is resolved.

1509.04720	the inferred evolution of the cold gas properties of candels galaxies at  0.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.0	we derive the total cold gas, atomic hydrogen, and molecular gas masses ofapproximately 24 000 galaxies covering four decades in stellar mass atredshifts 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.0, taken from the candels survey. our inferences arebased on the inversion of a molecular hydrogen based star formation law,coupled with a prescription to separate atomic and molecular gas. we find that:1) there is an increasing trend between the inferred cold gas (hi and h2), hi,and h2 mass and the stellar mass of galaxies down to stellar masses of 10^8msun already in place at z = 3; 2) the molecular fractions of cold gas increasewith increasing stellar mass and look-back time; 3) there is hardly anyevolution in the mean hi content of galaxies at fixed stellar mass; 4) the coldgas fraction and relative amount of molecular hydrogen in galaxies decrease ata relatively constant rate with time, independent of stellar mass; 5) there isa large population of low-stellar mass galaxies dominated by atomic gas. thesegalaxies are very gas rich, but only a minor fraction of their gas ismolecular; 6) the ratio between star-formation rate (sfr) and inferred totalcold gas mass (hi + h2) of galaxies (i.e., star-formation efficiency; sfe)increases with star-formation at fixed stellar masses. due to its simplicity,the presented approach is valuable to assess the impact of selection biases onsmall samples of directly-observed gas masses and to extend scaling relationsdown to stellar mass ranges and redshifts that are currently difficult to probewith direct measurements of gas content.

1512.00167	identification of z~&gt;2 herschel 500 micron sources using  color-deconfusion	we present a new method to search for candidate z~&gt;2 herschel 500{\mu}msources in the goods-north field, using a s500{\mu}m/s24{\mu}m "colordeconfusion" technique. potential high-z sources are selected againstlow-redshift ones from their large 500{\mu}m to 24{\mu}m flux density ratios.by effectively reducing the contribution from low-redshift populations to theobserved 500{\mu}m emission, we are able to identify counterparts to high-z500{\mu}m sources whose 24{\mu}m fluxes are relatively faint. the recovery ofknown z~4 starbursts confirms the efficiency of this approach in selectinghigh-z herschel sources. the resulting sample consists of 34 dusty star-forminggalaxies at z~&gt;2. the inferred infrared luminosities are in the range1.5x10^12-1.8x10^13 lsun, corresponding to dust-obscured star formation rates(sfrs) of ~260-3100 msun/yr for a salpeter imf. comparison with previous scuba850{\mu}m-selected galaxy samples shows that our method is more efficient atselecting high-z dusty galaxies with a median redshift of z=3.07+/-0.83 and 10of the sources at z~&gt;4. we find that at a fixed luminosity, the dusttemperature is ~5k cooler than that expected from the td-lir relation at z&lt;1,though different temperature selection effects should be taken into account.the radio-detected subsample (excluding three strong agn) follows thefar-infrared/radio correlation at lower redshifts, and no evolution withredshift is observed out to z~5, suggesting that the far-infrared emission isstar formation dominated. the contribution of the high-z herschel 500{\mu}msources to the cosmic sfr density is comparable to that of smg populations atz~2.5 and at least 40% of the extinction-corrected uv samples at z~4(abridged).

1512.02656	infrared color selection of massive galaxies at z &gt; 3	we introduce a new color-selection technique to identify high-redshift,massive galaxies that are systematically missed by lyman-break selection. thenew selection is based on the h_{160} and irac 4.5um bands, specifically h -[4.5] &gt; 2.25 mag. these galaxies, dubbed "hieros", include two majorpopulations that can be separated with an additional j - h color. thepopulations are massive and dusty star-forming galaxies at z &gt; 3 (jh-blue) andextremely dusty galaxies at z &lt; 3 (jh-red). the 350 arcmin^2 of the goods-n andgoods-s fields with the deepest hst/wfc3 and irac data contain 285 hieros downto [4.5] &lt; 24 mag. we focus here primarily on jh-blue (z &gt; 3) hieros, whichhave a median photometric redshift z ~4.4 and stellar massm_{*}~10^{10.6} msun,and are much fainter in the rest-frame uv than similarly massive lyman-breakgalaxies (lbgs). their star formation rates (sfrs) reaches ~240 msun yr^{-1}leading to a specific sfr, ssfr ~4.2 gyr^{-1}, suggesting that the ssfrs formassive galaxies continue to grow at z &gt; 2 but at a lower growth rate than fromz=0 to z=2. with a median half-light radius of 2 kpc, including ~20% as compactas quiescent galaxies at similar redshifts, jh-blue hieros represent perfectstar-forming progenitors of the most massive (m_{*} &gt; 10^{11.2} msun) compactquiescent galaxies at z ~ 3 and have the right number density. hieros make up~60% of all galaxies with m_{*} &gt; 10^{10.5} msun identified at z &gt; 3 from theirphotometric redshifts. this is five times more than lbgs with nearly no overlapbetween the two populations. while hieros make up 15-25% of the total sfrdensity at z ~ 4-5, they completely dominate the sfr density taking place inm_{*} &gt;10^{10.5} msun galaxies, and are therefore crucial to understanding thevery early phase of massive galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0012170	the nuclear cusp slopes of dwarf elliptical galaxies	we derive the light profiles for a sample of 25 dwarf elliptical galaxiesobserved by us with hst/wfpc2 in f555w and f814w. these profiles are fittedwith nuker, r^1/4, exponential, and sersic laws, and are also used to derivethe nuclear cusp slopes gamma. we discuss the correlation of nuclear cusp slopewith galactic luminosity, presence of a nucleus, and type of light profile. theresults are compared to those found in the literature for elliptical galaxiesand the bulges of spiral galaxies. we find that as a class the nuclear regionsof dwarf ellipticals are very similar to those of the exponential bulges ofspiral galaxies, and have nuclear cusp slopes shallower than those of bulgesthat were well fitted by a de vaucouleurs r^1/4 profile with the sameluminosity. for the 14 nucleated galaxies in our sample this conclusion is lesscertain than for the 11 non-nucleated objects since it relies on anextrapolation of galaxy light under the nucleus. in terms of their lightprofiles and nuclear properties, most spheroidal stellar systems can be broadlydivided into two subclasses: the exponential shallow cusp objects and ther^1/4, steep cusp objects. membership of a class does not appear to correlatewith the presence of a massive stellar disk.

0808.1727	mapping the dark matter from uv light at high redshift: an empirical  approach to understand galaxy statistics	we present a simple formalism to interpret two galaxy statistics, the uvluminosity function and two-point correlation functions for star-forminggalaxies at z~4, 5, 6 in the context of lcdm cosmology. both statistics are theresult of how star formation takes place in dm halos, and thus are used toconstrain how uv light depends on halo properties such as mass. the twomeasures were taken from the goods data, thus ideal for joint analysis. the twophysical quantities we explore are the sf duty cycle, and the range of l_uvthat a halo of mass m can have (mean and variance). the former addresses thetypical duration of sf activity in halos while the latter addresses theaveraged sf history and regularity of gas inflow into these systems. we explorevarious physical models consistent with data, and find the following: 1) thetypical duration of sf observed in the data is &lt;0.4 gyr (1 sig), 2) theinferred scaling law between l_uv and halo mass m from the observed slope ofthe lfs is roughly linear at all redshifts, and 3) l_uv for a fixed halo massdecreases with time, implying that the sf efficiency (after dust extinction) ishigher at earlier times. we explore several physical scenarios relating starformation to halo mass, but find that these scenarios are indistinguishable dueto the limited range of halo mass probed by our data. in order to discriminatebetween different scenarios, we discuss constraining the bright-faint galaxycross-correlation functions and luminosity-dependence of galaxy bias.(abridged)

astro-ph;0306348	the star-forming dwarf galaxy populations of two z ~ 0.4 clusters:  ms1512.4+3647 and abell 851	we present the results of a deep narrow-band [oii] 3727 \aa emission-linesearch for faint ($g &lt;$ 27), star-forming galaxies in the field of the $z=0.37$ms1512.4+3647 cluster. we find no evidence for an over-density of emission-linesources relative to the field at $z \sim$ 0.4 (hogg et al. 1998), and thereforeconclude that the ms1512.4+3647 sample is dominated by field [oii]emission-line galaxies which lie along the $\sim$ 180 mpc line of sightimmediately in front and behind the cluster. this is surprising, given that thepreviously surveyed $z=0.41$ cluster abell 851 has 3-4 times the fieldemission-line galaxy density (martin et al. 2000). we find that thems1512.4+3647 sample is deficient in galaxies with intermediate colors (1.0 $&lt;g-i &lt;$ 2.0) and implied star-formation exponential decay timescales $\tau \sim$100 myr - 1 gyr that dominate the abell 851 emission-line galaxy population.instead, the majority of [oii] emission-line galaxies surrounding thems1512.4+3647 cluster are blue ($g-i \leq 1.0$) and forming stars in burstswith $\tau &lt; $ 100 myr. in both samples, galaxies with the shorteststar-formation timescales are preferentially among the faintest star-formingobjects. their i luminosities are consistent with young stellar populations$\sim 10^8 - 10^9 \msun$, although an additional factor of ten in stellar masscould be hiding in underlying old stellar populations. we discuss theimplications for the star-formation histories of dwarf galaxies in the fieldand rich clusters.

astro-ph;0309065	the rest-frame uv luminosity density of star-forming galaxies at  redshifts z&gt;3.5	we have measured the rest--frame lambda~1500 ang comoving specific luminositydensity of star--forming galaxies at redshift 3.5&lt;z&lt;6.5 from deep images takenwith the hubble space telescope (hst)and the advanced camera for surveys (acs),obtained as part of the great observatories origins deep survey (goods). weused color selection criteria to construct samples of star--forming galaxies atredshifts z~4, 5 and 6, identified by the signature of the 912 ang lymancontinuum discontinuity and lyman-alpha forest blanketing in their rest--frameuv colors (lyman--break galaxies). the acs samples cover ~0.09 square degree,and are also relatively deep, reaching between 0.2 and 0.5 l_3^*, depending onthe redshift, where $l_3^*$ is the characteristic uv luminosity of lyman--breakgalaxies at z~3. the specific luminosity density of lyman--break galaxiesappears to be nearly constant with redshift from z~3 to z~6, although themeasure at z~6 remains relatively uncertain, because it depends on the accurateestimate of the faint counts of the z~6 sample. if lyman--break galaxies arefair tracers of the cosmic star formation activity, our results suggest that atz~6 the universe was already producing stars as vigorously as it did near itsmaximum several gyr later, at 1&lt;~z&lt;~3. thus, the onset of large--scale starformation in the universe is to be sought at around z~6 or higher, namely atless than ~7% of the current cosmic age.

astro-ph;0509551	morphology and evolution of emission line galaxies in the hubble ultra  deep field	we investigate the properties and evolution of a sample of galaxies selectedto have prominent emission lines in low-resolution grism spectra of the hubbleultra deep field (hudf). these objects, egrapes, are late type blue galaxies,characterized by small proper sizes (r_50 &lt; 2 kpc) in the 4350a rest-frame, lowmasses (5x10^9 m_sun), and a wide range of luminosities and surfacebrightnesses. the masses, sizes and volume densities of these objects appear tochange very little up to a redshift of z=1.5. on the other hand, their surfacebrightness decreases significantly from z=1.5 to z=0 while their mass-to-lightratio increases two-folds. this could be a sign that most of low redshiftegrapes have an older stellar population than high redshift egrapes and hencethat most egrapes formed at higher redshifts. the average volume density ofegrapes is (1.8 \pm 0.3)x10^{-3} mpc^{-3} between 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 1.5. many egrapeswould formally have been classified as luminous compact blue galaxies (lcbgs)if these had been selected based on small physical size, blue intrinsic color,and high surface brightness, while the remainder of the sample discussed inthis paper forms an extension of lcbgs towards fainter luminosities.

astro-ph;0604442	the survey for ionization in neutral gas galaxies- ii. the star  formation rate density of the local universe	we derive observed halpha and r band luminosity densities of an hi-selectedsample of nearby galaxies using the singg sample to be l_halpha' = (9.4 +/-1.8)e38 h_70 erg s^-1 mpc^-3 for halpha and l_r' = (4.4 +/- 0.7)e37 h_70 ergs^-1 a^-1 mpc^-3 in the r band. this r band luminosity density is approximately70% of that found by the sloan digital sky survey. this leads to a local starformation rate density of log(sfrd) = -1.80 +0.13/-0.07(random) +/-0.03(systematic) + log(h_70) after applying a mean internal extinctioncorrection of 0.82 magnitudes. the gas cycling time of this sample is found tobe t_gas = 7.5 +1.3/-2.1 gyr, and the volume-averaged equivalent width of thesingg galaxies is ew(halpha) = 28.8 +7.2/-4.7 a (21.2 +4.2/-3.5 a withoutinternal dust correction). as with similar surveys, these results imply thatsfrd(z) decreases drastically from z ~ 1.5 to the present. a comparison of thedynamical masses of the singg galaxies evaluated at their optical limits withtheir stellar and hi masses shows significant evidence of downsizing: the mostmassive galaxies have a larger fraction of their mass locked up in starscompared with hi, while the opposite is true for less massive galaxies. we showthat the application of the kennicutt star formation law to a galaxy having themedian orbital time at the optical limit of this sample results in a starformation rate decay with cosmic time similar to that given by the sfrd(z)evolution. this implies that the sfrd(z) evolution is primarily due to thesecular evolution of galaxies, rather than interactions or mergers. this isconsistent with the morphologies predominantly seen in the singg sample.

astro-ph;0606244	far-ultraviolet imaging of the hubble deep field north: star formation  in normal galaxies at z&lt;1	we present far-ultraviolet (fuv) imaging of the hubble deep field north(hdf-n) taken with the solar blind channel of the advanced camera for surveys(acs/sbc) and the fuv mama detector of the space telescope imaging spectrograph(stis) onboard the hubble space telescope. the full wfpc2 deep field has beenobserved at 1600 angstroms. we detect 134 galaxies and one star down to a limitof fuv_{ab} ~ 29. all sources have counterparts in the wfpc2 image. redshifts(spectroscopic or photometric) for the detected sources are in the range 0&lt;z&lt;1.we find that the fuv galaxy number counts are higher than those reported bygalex, which we attribute at least in part to cosmic variance in the smallhdf-n field of view. six of the 13 chandra sources at z&lt;0.85 in the hdf-n aredetected in the fuv, and those are consistent with starbursts rather than agn.cross-correlating with spitzer sources in the field, we find that the fuvdetections show general agreement with the expected l_ir/l_uv vs. betarelationship. we infer star formation rates (sfrs), corrected for extinctionusing the uv slope, and find a median value of 0.3 msun/yr for fuv-detectedgalaxies, with 75% of detected sources have sfr&lt;1 msun/yr. examining themorphological distribution of sources, we find that about half of allfuv-detected sources are identied as spiral galaxies. half ofmorphologically-selected spheroids at z&lt;0.85 are detected in the fuv,suggesting that such sources have significant ongoing star-formation in theepoch since z=1.

astro-ph;0606696	the morphological diversities among star-forming galaxies at high  redshifts in the great observatories origins deep survey (goods)	we have used the hst/acs images to identify 4700 lyman break galaxies (lbgs)in goods. we present the results from a parametric analysis of the 2-d surfacebrightness profiles, for 1333 lbgs at z &gt; 2.5 with rest-frame uv(1600 angstrom)ab magnitude &lt; -20.5. based on the sersic index, n, which measures the profileshape, we find that about 40% of lbgs at z=3 have light profiles close toexponential, and only 30% have the high concentrations seen for spheroids.about 30% of lbgs appear to have multiple cores or disturbed morphologiessuggestive of close pairs or on-going mergers. the fraction of spheroid-like (n&gt; 2.5) lbgs decreases by about 15% from z = 5 to 3. a comparison of lbgs withthe starburst galaxies at z = 1.2, shows that the fraction of spheroid-likeprofiles is about 20% higher among lbgs. the ellipticity distribution for lbgsexhibits a pronounced skew towards high ellipticities (&gt; 0.5), which cannot beexplained by morphologies similar to the local disks and spheroids viewed atrandom orientations. the peak of the distribution evolves toward lowerellipticities, from 0.7 at z = 4 to 0.5 at z = 3. at z = 1.2 the distributionis relatively flat as seen among the present-day galaxies. the dominance ofelongated morphologies among lbgs suggests that in a significant fraction ofthem we may be witnessing star-formation in clumps along gas-rich filaments, orthe earliest gas-rich bars that encompass essentially the entire visiblegalaxy. similar features are found to be ubiquitous in hydrodynamicalsimulations in which galaxy formation at high redshifts occurs in filamentaryinflows of dynamically cold gas within the dark matter halos, and involves gas-rich mergers.

astro-ph;9506123	visual search for galaxies near the northern crossing of the  supergalactic plane by the milky way	we have visually examined twelve palomar red plates for galaxies at lowgalactic latitude b, where the supergalactic plane (sgp) is crossed by thegalactic plane (gp), at galactic longitude l ~135 degrees. the catalogueconsists of 2575 galaxy candidates, of which 462 have major axis diameters d &gt;=0.8 arc min (uncorrected for extinction). galaxy candidates can be identifieddown to |b| ~ 0 degrees. one of our galaxy candidates (j24 = dwingeloo 1) hasrecently been discovered independently in 21cm by kraan-korteweg et al. (1994)as a nearby galaxy. comparisons with the structures seen in the iras and ugccatalogues are made. we compare the success rate of identifying galaxies usingthe iras point source catalogue under different colour selection criteria. thecriteria that require both the 60 micron and 100 micron fluxes to be of highquality, have the highest probability of selecting a galaxy (with d &gt;= 0.6 arcmin), but at the expense of selecting a smaller number of galaxies in total.

astro-ph;9701235	a far ultraviolet analysis of the stellar populations in six elliptical  and s0 galaxies	we have analyzed the far-ultraviolet (fuv) spectra of six elliptical and s0galaxies in order to characterize their hot stellar populations. the spectrawere obtained using the hopkins ultraviolet telescope (hut) in march 1995.these data, together with the spectra of two galaxies observed with hut in1990, represent the only fuv spectra of early type galaxies that extend to thelyman limit at 912 a and therefore include the "turnover" in the spectralenergy distribution below lyman alpha. using an extensive new grid of syntheticspectra which match the hut resolution and cover the relevant parameter spaceof temperature and gravity, we have constructed synthetic spectral energydistributions by integrating over predicted stellar evolutionary tracks forhorizontal branch stars and their progeny. when the models are compared withthe hut data, we find that those with supersolar metal abundances and heliumbest reproduce the flux across the entire hut wavelength range, while thosewith subsolar z &amp; y fit less well, partly because of a significant flux deficitshortward of 970 a in the models. we find that agb-manque evolution is requiredin all fits to the hut spectra, suggesting that all of the galaxies have somesubdwarf b star population. at any z &amp; y, the models that best match the hutflux are dominated by stars evolving from a narrow range of envelope mass onthe blue end of the horizontal branch.

astro-ph;9803144	high redshift galaxies in the hubble deep field: ii. colours and number  counts	we discuss the deep galaxy counts from the hubble deep field (hdf) imagingsurvey. at faint magnitudes, the slope of the differential number-magnituderelation is flatter than 0.2 in all four hdf bandpasses. in the ultraviolet, afluctuation analysis shows that the flattening observed below u=26 mag is notdue to incompleteness and is more pronounced than in the other bands,consistent with the idea that a redshift limit has been reached in the galaxydistribution. a reddening trend of about 0.5 magnitude is observed at faintfluxes in the colour-magnitude diagram, (u-v)_{eff} vs. v. we interpret theseresults as the effect of intergalactic attenuation on distant galaxies. at fluxlevels of ab=27 mag and in agreement with the fluctuation analysis and thecolour-magnitude relation, about 7% of the sources in u, 30% in b and 35% in vare lyman-break ``dropouts'', i.e. candidate star-forming galaxies at z&gt;2. byintegrating the number counts to the limits of the hdf survey we find that themean surface brightness of the extragalactic sky is dominated by galaxies thatare relatively bright and are known to have &lt;z&gt;=0.6. to ab=29 mag, theintegrated light from resolved galaxies in the i-band is 2.1\pm 0.4 \times10^{-20} erg/cm^2/s/hz/sr, and its spectrum is well described by a brokenpower-law. we discuss the predictions for the counts, colours, and luminositydensities from standard low-q_0 pure-luminosity-evolution models without dustobscuration, and find that they are unable to reproduce all the observedproperties of faint field galaxies.

astro-ph;9803327	color--luminosity relations for the resolved hot stellar populations in  the centers of m 31 and m 32	we present faint object camera (foc) ultraviolet images of the central14x14'' of messier 31 and messier 32. the hot stellar population detected inthe composite uv spectra of these nearby galaxies is partially resolved intoindividual stars, and their individual colors and apparent magnitudes aremeasured. we detect 433 stars in m 31 and 138 stars in m 32, down to detectionlimits of m_f275w = 25.5 mag and m_f175w = 24.5 mag. we investigate theluminosity functions of the sources, their spatial distribution, theircolor-magnitude diagrams, and their total integrated far-uv flux. although m 32has a weaker uv upturn than m 31, the luminosity functions and color-magnitudediagrams of m 31 and m 32 are surprisingly similar, and are inconsistent with amajority contribution from any of the following: pagb stars more massive than0.56 msun, main sequence stars, or blue stragglers. both the the luminosityfunctions and color-magnitude diagrams are consistent with a dominantpopulation of stars that have evolved from the extreme horizontal branch (ehb)along tracks with masses between 0.47 and 0.53 msun. these stars are well belowthe detection limits of our images while on the zero-age ehb, but becomedetectable while in the more luminous (but shorter) agb-manque' and post-earlyasymptotic giant branch (peagb) phases. the foc observations require that onlya only a very small fraction of the main sequence population (2% in m 31 and0.5% in m 32) in these two galaxies evolve though the ehb and post-ehb phases,with the remainder evolving through bright pagb evolution that is so rapid thatfew if any stars are expected in the small field of view covered by the foc.

astro-ph;9808282	an extremely red r^{1/4} galaxy in the test image of the hubble deep  field south	we report the serendipitous discovery of an extremely red object in thehubble deep field south (hdfs) test nicmos (near infrared camera and multiobject spectrograph) field of view. the object is resolved in the nicmos imageand has a light profile very well described by an r^{1/4} law with effectiveradius r_e=0."20+-0."05 and h_{ab}=21.7+-0.1 magnitudes. in contrast, thegalaxy is undetected in the r and i band ground based images taken at the ctio4 m blanco telescope, giving a lower limit to the color of (r-h)_{ab}&gt;3.9 and(i-h)_{ab}&gt;3.5 at the 95% confidence level. the colors of a range of syntheticgalactic spectra are computed, showing that the object is likely to be an``old'' elliptical galaxy at redshift z&gt;~1.7. alternatively the colors can bereproduced by an ``old'' elliptical galaxy at somewhat lower redshift (z&gt;~1)with significant amount of dust, or by a younger galaxy at higher redshift.this object represents a very interesting target for future vlt observations.

astro-ph;9809400	the specific globular cluster frequencies of dwarf elliptical galaxies  from the hubble space telescope	the specific globular cluster frequencies (s_n) for 24 dwarf elliptical (de)galaxies in the virgo and fornax clusters and the leo group imaged with thehubble space telescope are presented. combining all available data, we findthat for nucleated des --- which are spatially distributed like giantellipticals in galaxy clusters --- s_n(de,n)=6.5 +- 1.2 and s_n increases withm_v, while for non-nucleated des --- which are distributed like late-typegalaxies --- s_n(de,non)=3.1 +- 0.5 and there is little or no trend with m_v.the s_n values for de galaxies are thus on average significantly higher thanthose for late-type galaxies, which have s_n &lt; 1. this suggests that degalaxies are more akin to giant es than to late-type galaxies. if there aredormant or stripped irregulars hiding among the de population, they are likelyto be among the non-nucleated des. furthermore, the similarities in theproperties of the globular clusters and in the spatial distributions of de,nsand giant es suggest that neither galaxy mass or galaxy metallicity isresponsible for high values of s_n. instead, most metal-poor gcs may haveformed in dwarf-sized fragments that merged into larger galaxies.

astro-ph;9812102	vlt and hst observations of a candidate high redshift elliptical galaxy  in the hubble deep field south	the combined use of the eso very large telescope (vlt) ut1 scienceverification (sv) images and of the hubble space telescope (hst) hubble deepfield south observations allows us to strengthen the identification as acandidate elliptical galaxy of the extremely red object hdfs 223251-603910previously identified by us on the basis of nicmos and cerro tololointeramerican observatory imaging. the photometry presented here includes vltdata in u, b, v, r, i, a stis unfiltered image, nicmos j, h, and k band data,thus combining the 16.5 hours of vlt sv exposures with 101 hours of hstobserving. the object is detected in all images except the vlt u band and isone of the reddest known with b-k=9.7+-0.5. we consider a wide range of modelswith different ages, metallicities, star formation histories and dust content,and conclude that the observed spectral energy distribution agrees best withthat of an old elliptical galaxy at redshift just below 2. alternativepossibilities are discussed in light of their likelihood and of the perspectiveof spectroscopic confirmation.

astro-ph;9901022	the lyman-alpha forest of the qso in the hubble deep field south	the quasar in the hubble deep field south (hdfs), j2233-606 (z=2.23) has beenexhaustively observed by ground based telescopes and by the stis spectrographon board the hubble space telescope at low, medium and high resolution in thespectral interval from 1120 a to 10000 a. this very large base-line representsa unique opportunity to study in detail the distribution of clouds associatedwith emitting structures in the field of the quasar and in nearby fieldsalready observed as part of the hdfs campaign. here we report the mainproperties of the lyman-alpha clouds in the intermediate redshift range1.20-2.20, where our present knowledge has been complicated by the difficultyin producing good data. the number density is shown to be higher than what isexpected by extrapolating the results from both lower and higher redshifts:63\pm8 lines with log n_{hi}\geq14.0 are found (including metal systems) at&lt;z&gt;=1.7, to be compared with ~40 lines predicted by extrapolating from previousstudies. the redshift distribution of the lyman-alpha clouds shows a regionspanning z=1.383-1.460 (comoving size of 94 h^{-1}_{65} mpc, omega_o=1) with alow density of absorption lines; we detect 5 lines in this region, comparedwith the 16 expected from an average density along the line of sight. the twopoint correlation function shows a positive signal up to scales of about 3h^{-1}_{65} mpc and an amplitude that is larger for larger hi column densities.the average doppler parameter is about 27 km/s, comparable to the mean valuefound at z &gt; 3, thus casting doubts on the temperature evolution of thelyman-alpha clouds.
