0906.5018	radiation from relativistic shocks with turbulent magnetic fields	using our new 3-d relativistic electromagnetic particle (remp) codeparallelized with mpi, we investigated long-term particle accelerationassociated with a relativistic electron-positron jet propagating in anunmagnetized ambient electron-positron plasma. the simulations were performedusing a much longer simulation system than our previous simulations in order toinvestigate the full nonlinear stage of the weibel instability and its particleacceleration mechanism. cold jet electrons are thermalized and ambientelectrons are accelerated in the resulting shocks. acceleration of ambientelectrons leads to a maximum ambient electron density three times larger thanthe original value. behind the bow shock in the jet shock strongelectromagnetic fields are generated. these fields may lead to time dependentafterglow emission. we calculated radiation from electrons propagating in auniform parallel magnetic field to verify the technique. we also used the newtechnique to calculate emission from electrons based on simulations with asmall system. we obtained spectra which are consistent with those generatedfrom electrons propagating in turbulent magnetic fields with red noise. thisturbulent magnetic field is similar to the magnetic field generated at an earlynonlinear stage of the weibel instability. a fully developed shock within alarger system generates a jitter/synchrotron spectrum.

0907.5209	using population synthesis of massive stars to study the interstellar  medium near ob associations	we developed a new population synthesis code for groups of massive stars,where we model the emission of different forms of energy and matter from thestars of the association. in particular, the ejection of the two radioactiveisotopes 26al and 60fe is followed, as well as the emission of hydrogenionizing photons, and the kinetic energy of the stellar winds and supernovaexplosions. we investigate various alternative astrophysical inputs and theresulting output sensitivities, especially effects due to the inclusion ofrotation in stellar models. as the aim of the code is the application torelatively small populations of massive stars, special care is taken to addresstheir statistical properties. our code incorporates both analytical statisticalmethods applicable to small populations, as well as extensive monte carlosimulations. we find that the inclusion of rotation in the stellar models has alarge impact on the interactions between ob associations and their surroundinginterstellar medium. the emission of 26al in the stellar winds is stronglyenhanced, compared to non-rotating models with the same mass-loss prescription.this compensates the recent reductions in the estimates of mass-loss rates ofmassive stars due to the effects of clumping. despite the lower mass-lossrates, the power of the winds is actually enhanced for rotating stellar models.the supernova power (kinetic energy of their ejecta) is decreased due to longerlifetimes of rotating stars, and therefore the wind power dominates oversupernova power for the first 6 myr after a burst of star-formation. forpopulations typical of nearby star-forming regions, the statisticaluncertainties are large and clearly non-gaussian.

0912.1247	recent discoveries of supersoft x-ray sources in m 31	classical novae (cne) have recently been reported to represent the majorclass of supersoft x-ray sources (ssss) in the central area of our neighbouringgalaxy m 31. this paper presents a review of results from recent x-rayobservations of m 31 with xmm-newton and chandra. we carried out a dedicatedoptical and x-ray monitoring program of cne and ssss in the central area of m31. we discovered the first ssss in m 31 globular clusters (gcs) and theirconnection to the very first discovered cn in a m 31 gc. this result may havean impact on the cn rate in gcs. furthermore, in our optical and x-raymonitoring data we discovered the cn m31n 2007-11a, which shows a very shortsss phase of 29 - 52 days. short sss states (durations &lt; 100 days) of cneindicate massive white dwarfs (wds) that are candidate progenitors ofsupernovae type ia. in the case of m31n 2007-11a, the optical and x-ray lightcurves suggest a binary containing a wd with m_wd &gt; 1.0 m_sun. finally, wepresent the discovery of the sss counterpart of the cn m31n 2006-04a. the x-raylight curve of m31n 2006-04a shows short-time variability, which might indicatean orbital period of about 2 hours.

0912.1583	simulation of relativistic shocks and associated radiation	using our new 3-d relativistic electromagnetic particle (remp) codeparallelized with mpi, we investigated long-term particle accelerationassociated with a relativistic electron-positron jet propagating in anunmagnetized ambient electron-positron plasma. we have also performedsimulations with electron-ion jets. the simulations were performed using a muchlonger simulation system than our previous simulations in order to investigatethe full nonlinear stage of the weibel instability for electron-positron jetsand its particle acceleration mechanism. cold jet electrons are thermalized andambient electrons are accelerated in the resulting shocks for both cases.acceleration of ambient electrons leads to a maximum ambient electron densitythree times larger than the original value for pair plasmas. behind the bowshock in the jet shock strong electromagnetic fields are generated. thesefields may lead to time dependent afterglow emission. we calculated radiationfrom electrons propagating in a uniform parallel magnetic field to verify thetechnique. we also used the new technique to calculate emission from electronsbased on simulations with a small system with two different cases for lorentzfactors (15 and 100). we obtained spectra which are consistent with thosegenerated from electrons propagating in turbulent magnetic fields with rednoise. this turbulent magnetic field is similar to the magnetic field generatedat an early nonlinear stage of the weibel instability.

0912.2999	evidence for supernova-synthesised dust from the rising afterglow of grb  071025 at z~5	we present observations and analysis of the broadband afterglow of swift grb071025. using optical and infrared (riyjhk) photometry, we derive a photometricredshift of 4.4 &lt; z &lt; 5.2; at this redshift our simultaneous multicolourobservations begin at ~30 s after the grb trigger in the host frame and duringthe initial rising phase of the afterglow. we associate the light curve peak at580 s in the observer frame with the formation of the forward shock, giving anestimate of the initial lorentz factor gamma_0 ~ 200. the red spectral energydistribution (even in regions not affected by the lyman-alpha break) providessecure evidence of a large dust column. however, the inferred extinction curveshows a prominent flat component between 2000-3000 angstroms in the rest-frame,inconsistent with any locally observed template but well-fit by models of dustformed by supernovae. time-dependent fits to the extinction profile reveal noevidence of dust destruction and limit the decrease in the extinction column todelta a_3000 &lt; 0.54 mag after t = 50 s in the rest frame. our observationsprovide evidence of a transition in dust properties at z~5, in agreement withstudies of high-z quasars, and suggest that sn-formed dust continues todominate the opacity of typical galaxies at this redshift.

1005.3827	probing the evolving massive star population in orion with kinematic and  radioactive tracers	we assemble a census of the most massive stars in orion, then use stellarisochrones to estimate their masses and ages, and use these results toestablish the stellar content of orion's individual ob associations. from this,our new population synthesis code is utilized to derive the history of theemission of uv radiation and kinetic energy of the material ejected by themassive stars, and also follow the ejection of the long-lived radioactiveisotopes 26al and 60fe. in order to estimate the precision of our method, wecompare and contrast three distinct representations of the massive stars. wecompare the expected outputs with observations of 26al gamma-ray signal and theextent of the eridanus cavity. we find an integrated kinetic energy emitted bythe massive stars of 1.8(+1.5-0.4)times 10^52 erg. this number is consistentwith the energy thought to be required to create the eridanus superbubble. wealso find good agreement between our model and the observed 26al signal,estimating a mass of 5.8(+2.7-2.5) times 10^-4 msol of 26al in the orionregion. our population synthesis approach is demonstrated for the orion regionto reproduce three different kinds of observable outputs from massive stars ina consistent manner: kinetic energy as manifested in ism excavation, ionizationas manifested in free-free emission, and nucleosynthesis ejecta as manifestedin radioactivity gamma-rays. the good match between our model and theobservables does not argue for considerable modifications of mass loss. ifclumping effects turn out to be strong, other processes would need to beidentified to compensate for their impact on massive-star outputs. ourpopulation synthesis analysis jointly treats kinematic output and the return ofradioactive isotopes, which proves a powerful extension of the methodology thatconstrains feedback from massive stars.

1007.0383	the swift/fermi grb 080928 from 1 ev to 150 kev	we present the results of a comprehensive study of the gamma-ray burst 080928and of its afterglow. grb 080928 was a long burst detected by swift/bat andfermi/gbm. it is one of the exceptional cases where optical emission hadalready been detected when the grb itself was still radiating in the gamma-rayband. for nearly 100 seconds simultaneous optical, x-ray and gamma-ray dataprovide a coverage of the spectral energy distribution of the transient sourcefrom about 1 ev to 150 kev. in particular, we show that the sed during the mainprompt emission phase agrees with synchrotron radiation. we constructed theoptical/near-infrared light curve and the spectral energy distribution based onswift/uvot, rotse-iiia (australia), and grond (la silla) data and compared itto the x-ray light curve retrieved from the swift/xrt repository. we show thatits bumpy shape can be modeled by multiple energy-injections into the forwardshock.furthermore, we investigate whether the temporal and spectral evolutionof the tail emission of the first strong flare seen in the early x-ray lightcurve can be explained by large-angle emission (lae). we find that anonstandard lae model is required to explain the observations. finally, wereport on the results of our search for the grb host galaxy, for which only adeep upper limit can be provided.

1009.0004	monster in the dark: the ultraluminous grb 080607 and its dusty  environment	we present early-time optical through infrared photometry of the brightgamma-ray burst grb 080607, starting only 6 s following the initial trigger inthe rest frame. complemented by our previously published spectroscopy, thishigh-quality photometric dataset allows us to solve for the extinctionproperties of the redshift 3.036 sightline, giving perhaps the most detailedinformation on the ultraviolet continuum absorption properties of any sightlineoutside our local group to date. the extinction properties are not adequatelymodeled by any ordinary extinction template (including the average milky way,large magellanic cloud, and small magellanic cloud curves), partially becausethe 2175-angstrom feature (while present) is weaker by about a factor of twothan when seen under similar circumstances locally. however, the spectralenergy distribution is exquisitely fitted by the more general fitzpatrick &amp;massa (1990) parameterization of local-group extinction, putting it in the samefamily as some peculiar milky way extinction curves. after correcting for this(considerable, a_v = 3.3 +/- 0.4 mag) extinction, grb 080607 is revealed tohave been among the most optically luminous events ever observed, comparable tothe naked-eye burst grb 080319b. its early peak time (t_rest &lt; 6 s) indicates ahigh initial lorentz factor (gamma &gt; 600), while the extreme luminosity may beexplained in part by a large circumburst density. only because of its earlyhigh luminosity could the afterglow of grb 080607 be studied in such detail inspite of the large attenuation and great distance, making this burst anexcellent prototype for the understanding of other highly obscuredextragalactic objects, and of the class of "dark" grbs in particular.

1011.0618	the nature of "dark" gamma-ray bursts	context: thirteen years after the discovery of the first afterglows, thenature of dark gamma-ray bursts (grb) still eludes explanation: while eachng-duration grb typically has an x-ray afterglow, optical/nir emission is onlyseen for 40-60% of them. aim: here we use the afterglow detection statistics ofthe systematic follow-up observations performed with grond since mid-2007 inorder to derive the fraction of "dark bursts" according to different methods,and to distinguish between various scenarios for "dark bursts". method:observations were performed with the 7-channel "gamma-ray optical andnear-infrared detector" (grond) at the 2.2m mpi/eso telescope. we used theafterglow detection rate in dependence on the delay time between grb and thefirst grond exposure. results: for long-duration swift bursts with a detectedx-ray afterglow, we achieve a 90% (35/39) detection rate of optical/nirafterglows whenever our observations started within less than 240\,min afterthe burst. complementing our grond data with swift/xrt spectra we constructbroad-band spectral energy distributions and derive rest-frame extinctions. edetect 25-40% "dark bursts", depending on the definition used. the faintoptical afterglow emission of "dark bursts" is mainly due to a combination oftwo contributing factors: (i) moderate intrinsic extinction at moderateredshifts, and (ii) about 22% of "dark" bursts at redshift $&gt;$5.

1104.2048	origin: metal creation and evolution from the cosmic dawn	origin is a proposal for the m3 mission call of esa aimed at the study ofmetal creation from the epoch of cosmic dawn. using high-spectral resolution inthe soft x-ray band, origin will be able to identify the physical conditions ofall abundant elements between c and ni to red-shifts of z=10, and beyond. themission will answer questions such as: when were the first metals created? howdoes the cosmic metal content evolve? where do most of the metals reside in theuniverse? what is the role of metals in structure formation and evolution? toreach out to the early universe origin will use gamma-ray bursts (grbs) tostudy their local environments in their host galaxies. this requires thecapability to slew the satellite in less than a minute to the grb location. bystudying the chemical composition and properties of clusters of galaxies we canextend the range of exploration to lower redshifts (z ~ 0.2). for this task weneed a high-resolution spectral imaging instrument with a large field of view.using the same instrument, we can also study the so far only partially detectedbaryons in the warm-hot intergalactic medium (whim). the less dense part of thewhim will be studied using absorption lines at low redshift in the spectra forgrbs.

1109.1547	cxom31 j004253.1+411422: the first ultra-luminous x-ray transient in m  31	we seek clarification of the nature of x-ray sources detected in m 31. herewe focus on cxom31 j004253.1+411422, the brightness of which suggests that itbelongs to the class of ultraluminous x-ray sources. we determine the x-rayproperties of sources detected in the xmm-newton chandra monitoring program. weinvestigate spectral properties and search for periodic or quasi-periodicoscillations. a multi-component model is applied to the spectra obtained fromxmm-newton data to evaluate the relative contributions from thermal andnon-thermal emission. the time dependence of this ratio is evaluated over aperiod of forty days. we simultaneously fit data from xmm-newton epic-pn, mos1and mos2 detectors with (non-thermal) powerlaw and (thermal) multicoloredblackbody. the x-ray spectrum is best fit by the combination of a thermalcomponent with kt ~ 1 kev and a powerlaw component with photon indexapproximately 2.6. from combined analysis of chandra, swift and xmm-newtondata, the unabsorbed total luminosity of this source decreases from ~ 3.8 x10^{39} erg s^{-1} in the first observation to ~ 0.5 x 10^{39} ergs s^{-1} overa period of three months. the decay closely follows an exponential decline witha time constant of 32 days. the source spectrum evolves significantly,exhibiting a faster decline of the thermal component. we do not find evidenceof any significant temporal features in the power density spectrum. thepresence of a thermal component at kt ~ 1 kev in conjunction with a non-thermalhigh energy tail, is also consistent with spectral properties of other ulxs inthe "high state". our analysis indicates that the underlying source of thisfirst ulx in m~31 is a black hole of mass, m &gt; 13 m_{sun}, accreting near theeddington limit, that underwent a transient outburst followed by an exponentialdecay reminiscent of transients associated with galactic x-ray novae.

1110.4642	super-solar metal abundances in two galaxies at z ~ 3.57 revealed by the  grb 090323 afterglow spectrum	we report on the surprisingly high metallicity measured in two absorptionsystems at high redshift, detected in the very large telescope spectrum of theafterglow of the gamma-ray burst grb 090323. the two systems, at redshiftz=3.5673 and z=3.5774 (separation delta v ~ 660 km/s), are dominated by theneutral gas in the interstellar medium of the parent galaxies. from the singlyionized zinc and sulfur, we estimate oversolar metallicities of [zn/h]=+0.29+/-0.10 and [s/h] = +0.67+/- 0.34, in the blue and red absorber,respectively. these are the highest metallicities ever measured in galaxies atz&gt;3. we propose that the two systems trace two galaxies in the process ofmerging, whose star formation and metallicity are heightened by theinteraction. this enhanced star formation might also have triggered the birthof the grb progenitor. as typically seen in star-forming galaxies, thefine-structure absorption siii* is detected, both in g0 and g1. from therest-frame uv emission in the grb location, we derive a relatively high, notcorrected for dust extinction, star-formation rate sfr ~ 6 msun/yr. theseproperties suggest a possible connection between some high-redshift grb hostgalaxies and high-z massive sub-millimeter galaxies, which are characterized bydisturbed morphologies and high metallicities. our result provides additionalevidence that the dispersion in the chemical enrichment of the universe at highredshift is substantial, with the existence of very metal rich galaxies lessthan two billion years after the big bang.

1202.1434	a deep search for the host galaxies of grbs with no detected optical  afterglow	gamma-ray bursts can provide information about star formation at highredshifts. even in the absence of a optical/near-infrared/radio afterglow, thehigh detection rate of x-ray afterglows by swift/xrt and its localizationprecision of 2-3 arcsec facilitates the identification and study of grb hostgalaxies. we focus on the search for the host galaxies of a sample of 17 burstswith xrt error circles but no detected long-wavelength afterglow. three ofthese events can also be classified as truly dark bursts: the observed upperlimit on the optical flux of the afterglow was less than expected based on thex-ray flux. our study is based on deep r and k-band observations performed witheso/vlt instruments, supported by grond and newfirm. to be conservative, wesearched for host galaxies in an area with a radius twice the 90% swift/xrterror circle. for 15 of the 17 bursts we find at least one galaxy inside thedoubled xrt error circle. in seven cases we discover extremely red objects inthe error circles. the most remarkable case is the host of grb 080207 which asa colour of r-k~4.7 mag (ab), one of the reddest galaxies ever associated witha grb. as a by-product of our study we identify the optical afterglow of grb070517a. optically dim afterglows result from cosmological lyman drop out anddust extinction, but the former process is only equired for a minority of cases(&lt;1/3). extinction by dust in the host galaxies might explain all other events.thereby, a seemingly non-negligible fraction of these hosts are globallydust-enshrouded, extremely red galaxies. this suggests that bursts withoptically dim afterglows trace a subpopulation of massive starburst galaxies,which are markedly different from the main body of the grb host galaxypopulation, namely the blue, subluminous, compact galaxies.

(2012), the structure of kkhi ofour jet-sheath configuration is slightly different even for the globalevolution of the strong transverse magnetic field. in our simulations the majorcomponents of growing modes are the electric field $e_{\rm z}$ and the magneticfield $b_{\rm y}$. after the $b_{\rm y}$ component is excited, an inducedelectric field $e_{\rm x}$ becomes significant. however, other field componentsremain small. we find that the structure and growth rate of kkhi with massratios $m_{\rm i}/m_{\rm e} = 1836$ and $m_{\rm i}/m_{\rm e} = 20$ are similar.in our simulations saturation in the nonlinear stage is not as clear as incounter-streaming cases. the growth rate for a mildly-relativistic jet case($\gamma_{\rm j} = 1.5$) is larger than for a relativistic jet case($\gamma_{\rm j} = 15$).

0807.2949	three x-ray transients in m31 observed with swift	the purpose of this study is to find transient x-ray sources in m31, and toinvestigate and classify their nature. three x-ray transients were observedwith swift. for each of the three x-ray transients we use the swift x-ray andoptical data together with observations from xmm-newton and chandra toinvestigate the lightcurves and the spectra of the outburst, and thereby toidentify the source types. the outburst of xmmu j004215.8+411924 lasted forabout one month. the source had a hard power-law spectrum with a photon indexof 1.6. it was previously identified as a be/x-ray binary based on the opticalidentification with a star. however, we show that with improved sourcecoordinates it is clear that the optical source is not the counterpart to thex-ray source. the source swift j004217.3+411532 had a bright outburst, afterwhich it slowly decayed over half a year. the spectrum was soft, correspondingto a thermal accretion disk with innermost temperature of 250-600 ev. thesource was not seen in the optical, and the soft spectrum indicates that thesource is most likely a black hole low mass x-ray binary. m31n 2006-11a is anova that was previously observed in the optical. we detected it both in x-raysand uv with swift half a year after the optical maximum, after which it decayedbelow the swift detection threshold within a month. the spectrum of the x-raytransient can be modelled by a black-body with a temperature of 50 ev. we usecatalogues of x-ray transients in m31 to estimate their rate, and we find alower limit of 9/yr.

astro-ph;0005372	modelling radioactivities and other observables from ob associations	recent observations of the diffuse galactic gamma-ray glow at 1.809 mev,attributed to the radioactive decay of 26al, point towards a massive starorigin of this radioactive isotope. wolf rayet stars and core-collapsesupernovae appear to dominate the production of this isotope. massive stars arecommonly located in clusters and ob associations, regions of recent starformation. we thus discuss the temporal evolution of 26al, and 60fe withinevolving ob associations. the goal of this study is to utilize the associatedgamma-ray lines as a diagnostic tool for the study of correlated starformation, and also to provide more detailed models for the interpretation ofdata obtained with comptel on the compton observatory. we investigate theeffects of possible aluminum yield enhancements, predicted for some massiveclose binary systems. in addition to the ejection of chemically processedmatter, massive stars also drive strong stellar winds and emit large fluxes ofionizing radiation. this energy and radiation input into the interstellarmedium (ism) is crucial for the dynamical evolution of the gas and subsequentstar forming activity in the galactic disk. we discuss population synthesismodels for a variety of star formation histories, and compare the predictedgamma-ray line lightcurves to comptel measurements in the cygnus region.radioactive tracers such as 26al and 60fe provide a unique gamma-ray tracer ofgalactic star formation activity, complementary to other methods using spectralinformation in the radio, ir or optical bands.

astro-ph;0104050	the cygnus region: 26al from ob associations	the comptel map of the 1.809 mev gamma-ray line, which is attributed to theradioactive decay of 26al, shows significant excess emission in the cygnusregion. cygnus is a region of recent star formation activity, which is rich inmassive, early-type stars concentrated in ob associations.  we perform population synthesis studies of this region to model theproduction and distribution of 26al, which is predominantly synthesized inmassive stars and distributed through stellar winds and core-collapsesupernovae. our simulations of the cygnus ob associations determine thetime-dependent production rate of 26al. we also estimate the associatedproduction of radioactive 60fe, which is primarily synthesized in core-collapsesupernovae. gamma-ray line emission from this isotope has yet to be detected.we also track the temporal evolution of the mechanical "luminosity" due to thekinetic energy of stellar winds and supernova ejecta, and the ionizing euvemission from early-type stars. together with a simple one-dimensional model ofthe superbubble driven into the ism by this energy flux one can constrain keyparameters of the stellar associations in the cygnus region.

astro-ph;0108015	diffuse gamma-ray line emission from multiple ob associations in cygnus	the comptel observations of the diffuse galactic 1.809 mev emissionattributed to the radioactive decay of 26al have confirmed the diffuse natureof this interstellar emission line. one of the most significant features of thereconstructed intensity pattern is a flux enhancement in the direction of thecygnus region. this region is fairly young and contains a wealth of massivestars, most of them grouped in the cygnus ob associations. multi-frequencymodel fitting strongly supports the hypothesis of massive stars and theirdescendent supernovae being the dominant sources of interstellar 26al asobserved by comptel.  massive stars and supernovae are known to impart a large amount of kineticenergy into the surrounding ism which lead to shockregions and large cavities.in addition, a large fraction of the electro-magnetic radiation of massivestars lies in the extreme ultra-violet causing photoionisation of thesurrounding interstellar medium.  we applied a population synthesis model in combination with an analytic modelof the expansion of superbubbles to the cygnus ob associations. the modelpredicts the expected 1.809 mev flux and the gamma-ray line intensity due tointerstellar 60fe. we compute the sizes and expansion parameters of theexpected hi-structures and the free-free emission intensities due to thephotoionizing radiation from massive stars within this region of the sky. wediscuss our present understanding of the cygnus region with respect to themassive star census and history. our model assigns about 70% of the 1.809 mevintensity to six known ob associations, about 20% to known isolated sources androughly 10% to an unkown diffuse component.

astro-ph;0306161	constraining the cosmic star formation rate with the mev background	the cosmic gamma-ray background (cgb) in the mev regime has been measuredwith comptel and smm. the origin of the cgb in this energy regime is believedto be dominated by gamma-rays from type ia supernovae. we calculate the cgbspectrum within the framework of frw cosmology as a function of the cosmic starformation rate, sfr(z). several estimates of the sfr(z) have been reportedsince the pioneering work of madau et al. here we discuss observationalconstraints on sfr(z) derived from models of the cgb. in particular, weconsider the sfr obtained from gamma-ray burst observations, which increasesdramatically with redshift beyond z ~ 1 in contrast to most estimates whichsaturate or show a mild increase with redshift. gamma-ray bursts may be themost powerful tracers of star formation in the early universe and thus providesignposts of the initial epoch of element synthesis. the star formation rateimplied by grb statistics results in a gamma-ray background that matches theobservations more closely than that inferred from other tracers of starformation. this may provide some support for the grb/sfr-paradigm, which inturn promises a powerful diagnostic of star formation, and thus cosmic chemicalevolution, from the era of population iii stars to the present.

astro-ph;0311218	line shape diagnostics of galactic 26al	the shape of the gamma-ray line from radioactive 26al, at 1808.7 kev energyin the frame of the decaying isotope, is determined by its kinematics when itdecays, typically 10^6 y after its ejection into the interstellar medium fromits nucleosynthesis source. three measurements of the line width exist:heao-c's 1982 value of (0+3) kev fwhm, the gris 1996 value of (5.4 +/- 1.3) kevfwhm, and the recent rhessi value of (2.0 +/- 0.8) kev fwhm, suggesting either"cold", "hot", or "warm" 26al in the ism. we model the line width as expectedfrom galactic rotation, expanding supernova ejecta, and/or wolf-rayet winds,and predict a value below 1 kev (fwhm) with plausible assumptions about 26alinitial velocities and expansion history. even though the recent rhessimeasurement reduces the need to explain a broad line corresponding to 540 km/smean 26al velocity through extreme assumptions about grain transport of 26al orhuge interstellar cavities, our results suggest that standard 26al ejectionmodels produce a line on the narrow side of what is observed by rhessi andintegral. improved integral and rhessi spatially-resolved line widthmeasurements should help to disentangle the effects of galactic rotation fromthe ism trajectories of 26al.

astro-ph;0602444	probing cosmic chemical evolution with gamma-ray bursts: grb060206 at  z=4.048	aim: we present early optical spectroscopy of the afterglow of the gamma-rayburst grb 060206 with the aim of determining the metallicity of the grbabsorber and the physical conditions in the circumburst medium. we also discusshow grbs may be important complementary probes of cosmic chemical evolution.method: absorption line study of the grb afterglow spectrum. results: wedetermine the redshift of the grb to be z=4.04795+/-0.00020. based on themeasurement of the neutral hydrogen column density from the damped lyman-alphaline and the metal content from weak, unsaturated sii lines we derive ametallicity of [s/h] =-0.84+/-0.10. this is one of the highest metallicitiesmeasured from absorption lines at z~4. from the very high column densities forthe forbidden siii*, oi*, and oi** lines we infer very high densities and lowtemperatures in the system. there is evidence for the presence of h$_2$molecules with logn(h_2) ~ 17.0, translating into a molecular fraction of logf\~ -3.5 with f=2n(h_2)/(2n(h_2)+ n(hi)). even if grbs are only formed by singlemassive stars with metallicities below ~0.3z(solar), they could still be fairlyunbiased tracers of the bulk of the star formation at z&gt;2. hence, metallicitiesas derived for grb060206 here for a complete sample of grb afterglows willdirectly show the distribution of metallicities for representative star-forminggalaxies at these redshifts.

astro-ph;9503120	26al and 60fe from supernova explosions	using recently calculated yields for type ii supernovae, along with modelsfor chemical evolution and the distribution of mass in the interstellar medium,the current abundances and spatial distributions of two key gamma-rayradioactivities, $^{26}$al and $^{60}$fe, are determined. the estimated steadystate production rates are 2.0 $\pm$ 1.0 m\sun \ myr$^{-1}$ for $^{26}$al and0.75 $\pm$ 0.4 m\sun \ myr$^{-1}$ for $^{60}$fe. this corresponds to 2.2 $\pm$1.1 m\sun \ of $^{26}$al and 1.7 $\pm$ 0.9 m\sun \ of $^{60}$fe in the presentinterstellar medium. sources of uncertainty are discussed, one of the moreimportant being the current rate of core collapse supernovae in the galaxy. oursimple model gives three per century, but reasonable changes in the starformation rate could easily accommodate a core collapse rate one-half as large,and thus one-half the yields. when these stellar and chemical evolution resultsare mapped into a three dimensional model of the galaxy, the calculated 1809kev gamma-ray flux map is consistent with the {\it compton gamma rayobservatory} observations of a steep decline in the flux outside a longitude of$\pm$ 50$^\circ$ from the galactic center, and the slight flux enhancementsobserved in the vicinity of spiral arms. other potential stellar sources of$^{26}$al and $^{60}$fe are mentioned, especially the possibility of $^{60}$fesynthesis in type ia supernovae. predictions for the $^{60}$fe massdistribution, total mass, and flux map are given.

astro-ph;9511142	the production of ti44 and co60 in supernova	the production of the radioactive isotopes $^{44}$ti and $^{60}$co in alltypes of supernovae is examined and compared to observational constraintsincluding galactic $\gamma$--ray surveys, measurements of the diffuse 511 kevradiation, $\gamma$--ray observations of cas a, the late time light curve of sn1987a, and isotopic anomalies found in silicon carbide grains in meteorites.the (revised) line flux from $^{44}$ti decay in the cas a supernova remnantreported by comptel on the compton gamma-ray observatory is near the upperbound expected from our models. the necessary concurrent ejection of $^{56}$niwould also imply that cas a was a brighter supernova than previously thoughtunless extinction in the intervening matter was very large. thus, if confirmed,the reported amount of $^{44}$ti in cas a provides very interesting constraintson both the supernova environment and its mechanism. the abundances of$^{44}$ti and $^{60}$co ejected by type ii supernovae are such thatgamma-radiation from $^{44}$ti decay sn 1987a could be detected by a futuregeneration of gamma-ray telescopes and that the decay of $^{60}$co mightprovide an interesting contribution to the late time light curve of sn 1987aand other type ii supernovae. to produce the solar $^{44}$ca abundance andsatisfy all the observational constraints, nature may prefer at least theoccasional explosion of sub-chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs as type iasupernovae. depending on the escape fraction of positrons due to $^{56}$co madein all kinds of type ia supernovae, a significant fraction of the steady statediffuse 511 kev emission may arise from the annihilation of positrons producedduring the decay of $^{44}$ti to $^{44}$ca. the ca and ti isotopic anomalies inpre-solar grains confirm the production of $^{44}$ti in supernovae and that

astro-ph;9701242	constraints from $^{26}$al measurements on the galaxy's recent global  star formation rate and core collapse supernovae rate	gamma-rays from the decay of $^{26}$al offer a stringent constraint on thegalaxy's global star formation rate over the past million years, supplementingother methods for quantifying the recent galactic star formation rate, such asequivalent widths of h$\alpha$ emission. advantages and disadvantages of using$^{26}$al gamma-ray measurements as a tracer of the massive star formation rateare analyzed. estimates of the galactic $^{26}$al mass derived from comptelmeasurements are coupled with a simple, analytical model of the $^{26}$alinjection rate from massive stars and restrict the galaxy's recent starformation rate to \hbox{5 $\pm$ 4 m\sun yr$^{-1}$}. in addition, we show thatthe derived $^{26}$al mass implies a present day \hbox{type ii + ib} supernovaerate of 3.4 $\pm$ 2.8 per century, which seems consistent with otherindependent estimates of the galactic core collapse supernova rate. if someindependent measure of the massive star initial mass function or star formationrate or \hbox{type ii + ib} supernovae rate were to become available (perhapsthrough estimates of the galactic $^{60}$fe mass), then a convenient way torestrain, or possibly determine, the other parameters is presented.

astro-ph;9809197	the diffuse gamma-ray background from supernovae	the cosmic gamma-ray background (cgb) in the mev region is believed to be dueto photons from radioactivity produced in sne throughout the history ofgalaxies in the universe. in particular, gamma-ray line emission from the decaychain 56ni-&gt; 56co-&gt;56fe provides the dominant photon source. although ironsynthesis occurs in all types of sne, the contribution to the cgb is dominatedby snia events due to their higher photon escape probabilities. estimates ofthe star formation history in the universe suggest a rapid increase by a factor\~ 10 from the present to a redshift z_p ~ 1.5, beyond which it either remainsconstant or decreases slowly. we integrate the observed star formation historyto determine the cgb from the corresponding sn rate history. in addition togamma-rays from short-lived radioactivity in snia and snii/ibc we alsocalculate the minor contributions from long-lived radioactivities (26al, 44ti,60co, and electron-positron pair annihilation). although progenitor evolutionfor snia is not yet fully understood, various arguments suggest delays of order1-2 gy between star formation and the production of snia's. the effect of thisdelay on the cgb is discussed. we emphasize the value of gamma-ray observationsof the cgb in the mev range as an independent tool for studies of the cosmicstar formation history. if the delay between star formation and snia activityexceeds 1 gy substantially, and/or the peak of the cosmic star formation rateoccurs at a redshift much larger than unity, the gamma-ray production of sniawould be insufficient to explain the observed cgb. alternatively, the cosmicstar formation rate would have to be higher (by a factor 2-3) than commonlyassumed, which is in accord with several upward revisions reported in therecent literature.

astro-ph;9902190	lotis search for early time optical afterglows: grb 971227	we report on the very early time search for an optical afterglow from grb971227 with the livermore optical transient imaging system (lotis). lotis beganimaging the `original' batse error box of grb 971227 approximately 14 s afterthe onset of gamma-ray emission. continuous monitoring of the positionthroughout the evening yielded a total of 499 images (10 s integration).analysis of these images revealed no steady optical afterglow brighter thanr=12.3 +- 0.2 in any single image. coaddition of different combinations of thelotis images also failed to uncover transient optical emission. in particular,assuming a constant early time flux, no optical afterglow brighter than r=14.2+- 0.2 was present within the first 1200 s and no optical afterglow brighterthan r=15.0 +- 0.2 was present in the first 6.0 h.  follow up observations by other groups revealed a likely x-ray afterglow anda possible optical afterglow. although subsequent deeper observations could notconfirm a fading source, we show that these transients are not inconsistentwith our present knowledge of the characteristics of grb afterglows. we alsodemonstrate that with the upgraded thermoelectrically cooled ccds, lotis iscapable of either detecting very early time optical afterglow or placingstringent constraints on the relationship between the gamma-ray emission andthe longer wavelength afterglow in relativistic blast wave models.

astro-ph;9904122	formation rates of black hole accretion disk gamma-ray bursts	while many models have been proposed for grbs, those currently favored areall based upon the formation of and/or rapid accretion into stellar mass blackholes. we present population synthesis calculations of these models using amonte carlo approach in which the many uncertain parameters intrinsic to suchcalculations are varied. we estimate the event rate for each class of model aswell as the propagation distance for those having significant delay betweenformation and burst production, i.e., double neutron star (dns) mergers andblack hole-neutron star (bh/ns) mergers. for reasonable assumptions regardingthe many uncertainties in population synthesis, we calculate a daily event ratein the universe for i) merging neutron stars: ~100/day; ii) neutron-star blackhole mergers: ~450/day; iii) collapsars: ~10,000/day; iv) helium star blackhole mergers: ~1000/day; and v) white dwarf black hole mergers: ~20/day. therange of uncertainty in these numbers however, is very large, typically two tothree orders of magnitude. these rates must additionally be multiplied by anyrelevant beaming factor and sampling fraction (if the entire universal set ofmodels is not being observed). depending upon the mass of the host galaxy, halfof the dns and bh/ns mergers will happen within 60kpc (for a milky-way massedgalaxy) to 5mpc (for a galaxy with negligible mass) from the galactic center.because of the delay time, neutron star and black hole mergers will happen at aredshift 0.5 to 0.8 times that of the other classes of models. information isstill lacking regarding the hosts of short hard bursts, but we suggest thatthey are due to dns and bh/ns mergers and thus will ultimately be determined tolie outside of galaxies and at a closer mean distance than long complex bursts(which we attribute to collapsars).

astro-ph;9912402	lotis upper limits and the prompt ot from grb 990123	grb 990123 established the existence of prompt optical emission fromgamma-ray bursts (grbs). the livermore optical transient imaging system (lotis)has been conducting a fully automated search for this kind of simultaneous lowenergy emission from grbs since october 1996. although lotis has obtainedsimultaneous, or near simultaneous, coverage of the error boxes obtained withbatse, ipn, xte, and bepposax for several grbs, image analysis resulted in onlyupper limits. the unique gamma-ray properties of grb 990123, such as very largefluence (top 0.4%) and hard spectrum, complicate comparisons with more typicalbursts. we scale and compare gamma-ray properties, and in some cases afterglowproperties, from the best lotis events to those of grb 990123 in an attempt todetermine whether the prompt optical emission of this event is representativeof all grbs. furthermore, using lotis upper limits in conjunction with therelativistic blast wave model, we weakly constrain the grb and afterglowparameters such as density of the circumburster medium and bulk lorentz factorof the ejecta.
