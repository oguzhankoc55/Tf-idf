0903.3041	resolving cosmic structure formation with the millennium-ii simulation	we present the millennium-ii simulation (ms-ii), a very large n-bodysimulation of dark matter evolution in the concordance lcdm cosmology. thems-ii assumes the same cosmological parameters and uses the same particlenumber and output data structure as the original millennium simulation (ms),but was carried out in a periodic cube one-fifth the size (100 mpc/h) with 5times better spatial resolution (a plummer equivalent softening of 1.0 kpc/h)and with 125 times better mass resolution (a particle mass of 6.9 \times 10^6msun/h). by comparing results at ms and ms-ii resolution, we demonstrateexcellent convergence in dark matter statistics such as the halo mass function,the subhalo abundance distribution, the mass dependence of halo formationtimes, the linear and nonlinear autocorrelations and power spectra, and haloassembly bias. together, the two simulations provide precise results for suchstatistics over an unprecedented range of scales, from halos similar to thosehosting local group dwarf spheroidal galaxies to halos corresponding to therichest galaxy clusters. the "milky way" halos of the aquarius project wereselected from a lower resolution version of the ms-ii and were then resimulatedat much higher resolution. as a result, they are present in the ms-ii alongwith thousands of other similar mass halos. a comparison of their assemblyhistories in the ms-ii and in resimulations of 1000 times better resolutionshows detailed agreement over a factor of 100 in mass growth. we publiclyrelease halo catalogs and assembly trees for the ms-ii in the same formatwithin the same archive as those already released for the ms.

0706.2919	the statistics of lcdm halo concentrations	we use the millennium simulation (ms) to study the statistics of lcdm haloconcentrations at z = 0. our results confirm that the average haloconcentration declines monotonically with mass; a power-law fits well theconcentration-mass relation for over 3 decades in mass, up to the most massiveobjects to form in a lcdm universe (~ 10^15 h^-1 msol). this is in cleardisagreement with the predictions of the model proposed by bullock et al. forthese rare objects, and agrees better with the original predictions of navarro,frenk, &amp; white. the large volume surveyed, together with the unprecedentednumerical resolution of the ms, allow us to estimate with confidence thedistribution of concentrations and, consequently, the abundance of systems withunusual properties. about one in a hundred cluster haloes (m200 &gt;~ 3x10^14 h^-1msol) have concentrations exceeding c200 = 7.5, a result that may be used tointerpret the likelihood of unusually strong massive gravitational lenses, suchas abell 1689, in the lcdm cosmogony. a similar fraction (1 in 100) ofgalaxy-sized haloes (m200 ~ 10^12 h^-1 msol) have c200 &lt; 4.5, an importantconstraint on models that attempt to reconcile the rotation curves of lowsurface-brightness galaxies by appealing to haloes of unexpectedly lowconcentration. we find that halo concentrations are independent of spin oncehaloes manifestly out of equilibrium are removed from the sample. compared totheir relaxed brethren, the concentrations of out-of-equilibrium haloes tend tobe lower and to have more scatter, while their spins tend to be higher...(continue)

0905.1696	how common is the milky way - satellite system alignment?	the highly flattened distribution of satellite galaxies in the milky waypresents a number of puzzles. firstly, its polar alignment stands out from theplanar alignments commonly found in other galaxies. secondly, recent propermotion measurements reveal that the orbital angular momentum of at least 3, andpossibly as many as 8, of the milky ways satellites point (within 30 degrees)along the axis of their flattened configuration, suggesting some form ofcoherent motion. in this paper we use a high resolution cosmological simulationto investigate whether this pattern conflicts with the expectations of the colddark matter model of structure formation. we find that this seemingly unlikelyset up occurs often: approximately 35% of the time we find systems in which theangular momentum of 3 individual satellites point along, or close to, the shortaxis of the satellite distribution. in addition, in 30% of the systems we findthat the net angular momentum of the 6 best aligned satellites lies within 35degrees of the short axis of the satellite distribution, as observed for themilky way.

0906.2785	the angular momentum of cold dark matter haloes with and without baryons	we investigate the magnitude and internal alignment of the angular momentumof cold dark matter haloes in simulations with and without baryons. we analysethe cumulative angular momentum profiles of hundreds of thousands of haloes inthe millennium simulation and in a smaller, but higher resolution, simulation,in total spanning 5 orders of magnitude in mass. for haloes of a given mass,the median specific angular momentum increases as j(&lt;r) proportional to r. thedirection of the vector varies considerably with radius: the median anglebetween the inner (&lt; 0.25 rvir) and total (&lt; rvir) angular momentum vectors isabout 25degr. to investigate how baryons affect halo spin, we use another highresolution simulation, which includes gas cooling, star formation and feedback.this simulation produces a sample of galaxies with a realistic distribution ofdisc-to-total ratios. the formation of the galaxy spins up the dark matterwithin 0.1 rvir such that the specific halo angular momentum increases byapprox 50% in the median. the dark matter angular momentum becomes betteraligned, but there remains a broad distribution of (mis-)alignments between thehalo and the central galaxy, with a median angle between their angular momentaof ~ 30degr. galaxies have a range of orientations relative to the shape of thehalo: half of them have their minor axes misaligned by more than 45degr.finally, we align a sample of haloes according to the orientation of theirgalaxies and stack the projected mass distributions. although the individualhaloes are aspherical, galaxy--halo misalignments produce a stacked massdistribution that is indistinguishable from circular. if the misalignment foundin our simulations is realistic, it will be extremely difficult for weaklensing studies to measure the shape of dark haloes using this technique.

0906.4350	galaxies-intergalactic medium interaction calculation --i. galaxy  formation as a function of large-scale environment	[abridged] we present the first results of hydrodynamical simulations thatfollow the formation of galaxies to z=0 in spherical regions of radius ~20mpc/h drawn from the millennium simulation. the regions have overdensities thatdeviate by (-2, -1, 0, +1, +2)sigma from the cosmic mean, where sigma is therms mass fluctuation on a scale of ~20mpc/h at z=1.5. the simulations have massresolution of up to 10^6 msun/h, cover the entire range of large-scaleenvironments and allow extrapolation of statistics to the entire 500 (mpc/h)^3millennium volume. they include gas cooling, photoheating from an ionisingbackground, sne feedback and winds, but no agn. we find that the specific sfrdensity at z &lt;~ 10 varies systematically from region to region by up to anorder of magnitude, but the global value, averaged over all volumes, reproducesobservational data. massive, compact galaxies, similar to those observed in thegoods fields, form in the overdense regions as early as z=6, but do not appearin the underdense regions until z~3. these environmental variations are notcaused by a dependence of the star formation properties on environment, butrather by a strong variation of the halo mass function from one environment toanother, with more massive haloes forming preferentially in the denser regions.at all epochs, stars form most efficiently in haloes of circular velocity ~ 250km/s. however, the star formation history exhibits a form of "downsizing" (evenin the absence of agn): the stars comprising massive galaxies at z=0 havemostly formed by z=1-2, whilst those comprising smaller galaxies typically format later times. however, additional feedback is required to limit starformation in massive galaxies at late times.

0909.0265	the properties of satellite galaxies in simulations of galaxy formation	we investigate the properties of satellite galaxies in cosmologicaln-body/sph simulations of galaxy formation in milky way-sized haloes. becauseof their shallow potential wells, satellite galaxies are very sensitive toheating processes which affect their gas content. their properties cantherefore be used to constrain the nature of feedback processes that regulategalaxy formation. in our simulations, we assume that all the energy produced bysupernovae is used as kinetic energy to drive galactic winds. several of oursimulations produce bright, disc-dominated galaxies. we find that wind modelsin which the wind speed, v_w, is proportional to local velocity dispersion ofdark matter, sigma, (and thus the wind mass-loading, eta_w \propto sigma^{-2})have episodic star formation histories, reproduce the observed satelliteluminosity function reasonably well (down to m_v=-7) and match theluminosity-metallicity relation observed in the local group satellites. bycontrast, models that assume a constant wind speed overproduce faint satellitesand predict an incorrect luminosity-metallicity relation. our simulationstherefore suggest that the feedback processes that operate on the scale ofsatellite galaxies should generate galactic outflows whose intensity variesinversely with the depth of the potential.

0910.0258	second-order lagrangian perturbation theory initial conditions for  resimulations	we describe and test a new method for creating initial conditions forcosmological n-body dark matter simulations based on second-order lagrangianperturbation theory (2lpt). the method can be applied to multi-mass particledistributions making it suitable for creating resimulation, or `zoom' initialconditions. by testing against an analytic solution we show that the methodworks well for a spherically symmetric perturbation with radial featuresranging over more than three orders of magnitude in linear scale and elevenorders of magnitude in particle mass. we apply the method and repeatresimulations of the rapid formation of a high mass halo at redshift fifty andthe formation of a milky-way mass dark matter halo at redshift zero. in bothcases we find that many properties of the final halo show a much smallersensitivity to the start redshift with the 2lpt initial conditions, thansimulations started from zel'dovich initial conditions. for spherical overdenseregions structure formation is erroneously delayed in simulations starting fromzel'dovich initial conditions, and we demonstrate for the case of the formationthe high redshift halo that this delay can be accounted for using the sphericalcollapse model. in addition to being more accurate, 2lpt initial conditionsallow simulations to start later, saving computer time.

0911.4484	there's no place like home? statistics of milky way-mass dark matter  halos	we present an analysis of the distribution of structural properties for milkyway-mass halos in the millennium-ii simulation (ms-ii). this simulation ofstructure formation within the standard lcdm cosmology contains thousands ofmilky way-mass halos and has sufficient resolution to properly resolve manysubhalos per host. it thus provides a major improvement in the statisticalpower available to explore the distribution of internal structure for halos ofthis mass. in addition, the ms-ii contains lower resolution versions of theaquarius project halos, allowing us to compare our results to simulations ofsix halos at a much higher resolution. we study the distributions of massassembly histories, of subhalo mass functions and accretion times, and ofmerger and stripping histories for subhalos capable of impacting disks at thecenters of halos. we show that subhalo abundances are not well-described bypoisson statistics at low mass, but rather are dominated by intrinsic scatter.using the masses of subhalos at infall and the abundance-matching assumption,there is less than a 10% chance that a milky way halo with m_vir =10^12 m_sunwill host two galaxies as bright as the magellanic clouds. this probabilityrises to ~25% for a halo with m_vir=2.5 x 10^12 m_sun. the statistics relevantfor disk heating are very sensitive to the mass range that is consideredrelevant. mergers with infall mass : redshift zero virial mass greater than1:30 could well impact a central galactic disk and are a near inevitabilitysince z=2, whereas only half of all halos have had a merger with infall mass :redshift zero virial mass greater than 1:10 over this same period.

1001.2310	secondary infall and the pseudo-phase-space density profiles of cold  dark matter halos	we use n-body simulations to investigate the radial dependence of the densityand velocity dispersion in cold dark matter (cdm) halos. in particular, weexplore how closely q rho/sigma^3, a surrogate measure of the phase-spacedensity, follows a power-law in radius. our study extends earlier work byconsidering, in addition to spherically-averaged profiles, local q-estimatesfor individual particles, q_i; profiles based on the ellipsoidal radiusdictated by the triaxial structure of the halo, q_i(r'); and by carefullyremoving substructures in order to focus on the profile of the smooth halo,q^s. the resulting q_i^s(r') profiles follow closely a power law near thecenter, but show a clear upturn from this trend near the virial radius,r_{200}. the location and magnitude of the deviations are in excellentagreement with the predictions from bertschinger's spherical secondary-infallsimilarity solution. in this model, q \propto r^{-1.875} in the inner,virialized regions, but departures from a power-law occur near r_{200} becauseof the proximity of this radius to the location of the first shell crossing -the shock radius in the case of a collisional fluid. particles there have notyet fully virialized, and so q departs from the inner power-law profile. ourresults imply that the power-law nature of $q$ profiles only applies to theinner regions and cannot be used to predict accurately the structure of cdmhalos beyond their characteristic scale radius.

1003.0974	full-sky map of the isw and rees-sciama effect from gpc simulations	we present a new method for constructing maps of the secondary temperaturefluctuations imprinted on the cosmic microwave background (cmb) radiation byphotons propagating through the evolving cosmic gravitational potential. largecosmological n-body simulations are used to calculate the complete non-linearevolution of the peculiar gravitational potential. tracing light rays backthrough the past lightcone of a chosen observer accurately captures thetemperature perturbations generated by linear (the integrated sachs-wolfe orisw effect) and non-linear (the rees-sciama or rs effect) evolution. theseeffects give rise to three kinds of non-linear features in the temperaturemaps. (a) in overdense regions, converging flows of matter induce cold spots oforder 100 mpc in extent which can dominate over the isw effect at highredshift, and are surrounded by hot rings. (b) in underdense regions, the rseffect enhances isw cold spots which can be surrounded by weak hot rings. (c)transverse motions of large lumps of matter produce characteristic dipolefeatures, consisting of adjacent hot and cold spots separated by a few tens ofmegaparsecs. these non-linear features are not easily detectable; they modulatethe isw sky maps at about the 10 percent level. the rs effect causes theangular power spectrum to deviate from linear theory at l~50 and generatesnon-gaussianity, skewing the one-point distribution function to negativevalues. cold spots of similar angular size, but much smaller amplitude than thecmb cold spot reported by cruz et al. are produced. joint analysis of our mapsand the corresponding galaxy distribution may enable techniques to be developedto detect these non-linear, non-gaussian features. our maps are available athttp://astro.dur.ac.uk/~cai/isw

1010.6197	a halo expansion (hex) technique for approximating simulated dark matter  haloes	we apply a basis function expansion method to create a time-evolvingdensity/potential approximation of the late growth of simulated n-body darkmatter haloes. we demonstrate how the potential of a halo from the aquariusproject can be accurately represented by a small number of basis functions, andshow that the halo expansion (hex) method provides a way to replay simulations.we explore the level of accuracy of the technique as well as some of itslimitations. we find that the number of terms included in the expansion must belarge enough to resolve the large-scale distribution and shape of the halo but,beyond this, additional terms result in little further improvement. particleand subhalo orbits can be integrated in this realistic, time-varying halopotential approximation, at much lower cost than the original simulation, withhigh fidelity for many individual orbits, and a good match to the distributionsof orbital energy and angular momentum. statistically, the evolution ofstructural subhalo properties, such as mass, half-mass radius andcharacteristic circular velocity, are very well reproduced in the haloexpansion approximation over several gigayears. we demonstrate an applicationof the technique by following the evolution of an orbiting subhalo at muchhigher resolution than can be achieved in the original simulation. our methodrepresents a significant improvement over commonly used techniques based onstatic analytical descriptions of the halo potential.

1102.0002	the density and pseudo-phase-space density profiles of cdm halos	cosmological n-body simulations indicate that the spherically-averageddensity profiles of cold dark matter halos are accurately described by einastoprofiles, where the logarithmic slope is a power-law of adjustable exponent,\gamma =dln\rho /dlnr ~ r^\alpha $. the pseudo-phase-space density (ppsd)profiles of cdm halos also show remarkable regularity, and are wellapproximated by simple power laws, q(r)=\rho /\sigma ^3 ~ r^-\chi . we showthat this is expected from dynamical equilibrium considerations, since jeans'equations predict that the pseudo-phase-space density profiles of einasto halosshould resemble power laws over a wide range of radii. for the values of \alphatypical of cdm halos, the inner q profiles of equilibrium halos deviatesignificantly from a power law only very close to the center, and simulationsof extremely high-resolution would be needed to detect such deviationsunambiguously. we use an ensemble of halos drawn from the millennium-iisimulation to study which of these two alternatives describe best the massprofile of cdm halos. our analysis indicates that at the resolution of the bestavailable simulations, both einasto and power-law ppsd profiles (withadjustable exponents \alpha and \chi, respectively) provide equally acceptablefits to the simulations. a full account of the structure of cdm halos requiresunderstanding how the shape parameters that characterize departures fromself-similarity, like \alpha or \chi, are determined by evolutionary history,environment or initial conditions.

1104.2929	the haloes of bright satellite galaxies in a warm dark matter universe	high resolution n-body simulations of galactic cold dark matter haloesindicate that we should expect to find a few satellite galaxies around themilky way whose haloes have a maximum circular velocity in excess of 40 kms.yet, with the exception of the magellanic clouds and the sagittarius dwarf,which likely reside in subhaloes with significantly larger velocities thanthis, the bright satellites of the milky way all appear to reside in subhaloeswith maximum circular velocities below 40 kms. as recently highlighted byboylan-kolchin et al., this discrepancy implies that the majority of the mostmassive subhaloes within a cold dark matter galactic halo are much tooconcentrated to be consistent with the kinematic data for the bright milky waysatellites. here we show that no such discrepancy exists if haloes are made ofwarm, rather than cold dark matter because these haloes are less concentratedon account of their typically later formation epochs. warm dark matter is oneof several possible explanations for the observed kinematics of the satellites.

0709.3470	constraints on sigma_8 from galaxy clustering in n-body simulations and  semi-analytic models	we generate mock galaxy catalogues for a grid of different cosmologies, usingrescaled n-body simulations in tandem with a semi-analytic model run usingconsistent parameters. because we predict the galaxy bias, rather than fittingit as a nuisance parameter, we obtain an almost pure constraint on sigma_8 bycomparing the projected two-point correlation function we obtain to that fromthe sdss. a systematic error arises because different semi-analytic modellingassumptions allow us to fit the r-band luminosity function equally well.combining our estimate of the error from this source with the statisticalerror, we find sigma_8=0.97 +/- 0.06. we obtain consistent results if we usegalaxy samples with a different magnitude threshold, or if we select galaxiesby b_j-band rather than r-band luminosity and compare to data from the 2dfgrs.our estimate for sigma_8 is higher than that obtained for other analyses ofgalaxy data alone, and we attempt to find the source of this difference. wenote that in any case, galaxy clustering data provide a very stringentconstraint on galaxy formation models.

0711.0746	the redshift dependence of the structure of massive lcdm halos	(abridged) we use two very large cosmological simulations to study how thedensity profiles of relaxed lcdm dark halos depend on redshift and on halomass. we confirm that these profiles deviate slightly but systematically fromthe nfw form and are better approximated by the empirical formula, $d\log\rho/d\log r \propto r^{\alpha}$, first used by einasto to fit star counts inthe milky way. the best-fit value of the additional shape parameter, $\alpha$,increases gradually with mass, from alpha ~ 0.16 for present-day galaxy halosto alpha~ 0.3 for the rarest and most massive clusters. halo concentrationsdepend only weakly on mass at z=0, and this dependence weakens further atearlier times. at z ~3 the average concentration of relaxed halos does not varyappreciably over the mass range accessible to our simulations (m &gt;=3e11msun).furthermore, in our biggest simulation, the average concentration of the mostmassive}, relaxed halos is constant at c200 ~3.5 to 4 for 0&lt;=z&lt;= 3. theseresults have important implications for currently planned surveys of distantclusters.

1206.6495	the abundance of (not just) dark matter haloes	we study the effect of baryons on the abundance of structures andsubstructures in a lambda-cdm cosmology, using a pair of high resolutioncosmological simulations from the gimic project. both simulations use identicalinitial conditions, but while one contains only dark matter, the other alsoincludes baryons. we find that gas pressure, reionisation, supernova feedback,stripping, and truncated accretion systematically reduce the total mass and theabundance of structures below ~10^12 solar masses compared to the pure darkmatter simulation. taking this into account and adopting an appropriatedetection threshold lowers the abundance of observed galaxies with maximumcircular velocities below 100 km/s, significantly reducing the reporteddiscrepancy between lambda-cdm and the measured hi velocity function of thealfalfa survey. we also show that the stellar-to-total mass ratios of galaxieswith stellar masses of ~10^5 - 10^7 solar masses inferred from abundancematching of the (sub)halo mass function to the observed galaxy mass functionincrease by a factor of ~2. in addition, we find that an important fraction oflow-mass subhaloes are completely devoid of stars. accounting for the presenceof dark subhaloes below 10^10 solar masses further reduces the abundance ofobservable objects, and leads to an additional increase in the inferredstellar-to-total mass ratio by factors of 2 - 10 for galaxies in haloes of 10^9- 10^10 solar masses. this largely reconciles the abundance matching resultswith the kinematics of individual dwarf galaxies in lambda-cdm. we proposeapproximate corrections to the masses of objects derived from pure dark mattercalculations to account for baryonic effects.

1209.3018	dark matter halo merger histories beyond cold dark matter: i - methods  and application to warm dark matter	we describe a methodology to accurately compute halo mass functions,progenitor mass functions, merger rates and merger trees in non-cold darkmatter universes using a self-consistent treatment of the generalized extendedpress-schechter formalism. our approach permits rapid exploration of thesubhalo population of galactic halos in dark matter models with a variety ofdifferent particle properties or universes with rolling, truncated, or morecomplicated power spectra. we make detailed comparisons of analytically derivedmass functions and merger histories with recent warm dark matter cosmologicaln-body simulations, and find excellent agreement. we show that, once theaccretion of smoothly distributed matter is accounted for, coarse-grainedstatistics such as the mass accretion history of halos can be almostindistinguishable between cold and warm dark matter cases. however, the halomass function and progenitor mass functions differ significantly, with the warmdark matter cases being strongly suppressed below the free-streaming scale ofthe dark matter. we demonstrate the importance of using the correct solutionfor the excursion set barrier first-crossing distribution in warm dark matter -if the solution for a flat barrier is used instead the truncation of the halomass function is much slower, leading to an overestimate of the number of lowmass halos.

0801.1127	the unorthodox orbits of substructure halos	(abridged) we use cosmological n-body simulations to study the properties ofsubstructure halos in galaxy-sized dark matter halos. we extend prior work onthe subject by considering the whole population of subhalos physicallyassociated with the main system. these are defined as subhalos that have atsome time in the past been within the virial radius of the halo's mainprogenitor and that have survived as self-bound entities to $z=0$. we find thatthis population extends beyond {\it three times} the virial radius, andcontains objects on extreme orbits. we trace the origin of these unorthodoxorbits to the tidal dissociation of bound groups of subhalos, which results inthe ejection of some subhalos along tidal streams. ejected subhalos areprimarily low-mass systems, leading to mass-dependent biases in their spatialdistribution and kinematics: the lower the subhalo mass at accretion time, theless centrally concentrated and kinematically hotter their descendantpopulation. the bias is strongest amongst the most massive subhalos, butdisappears at the low-mass end. our findings imply that subhalos identifiedwithin the virial radius represent an incomplete census of the substructurephysically related to a halo: only about {\it one half} of all associatedsubhalos are found today within the virial radius of a halo. these results mayexplain the age dependence of the clustering of low-mass halos, and hasimplications for (i) the interpretation of the structural parameters andassembly histories of halos neighboring massive systems; (ii) the existence oflow-mass dynamical outliers in the local group; and (iii) the presence ofevidence for evolutionary effects well outside the traditional virial boundaryof a galaxy system.

1306.5968	a new way of setting the phases for cosmological multi-scale gaussian  initial conditions	we describe how to define an extremely large discrete realisation of agaussian white noise field that has a hierarchical structure and the propertythat the value of any part of the field can be computed quickly. tinysubregions of such a field can be used to set the phase information forgaussian initial conditions for individual cosmological simulations ofstructure formation. this approach has several attractive features: (i) thehierarchical structure based on an octree is particular well suited forgenerating follow up resimulation or zoom initial conditions; (ii) the phasesare defined for all relevant physical scales in advance so that resimulationinitial conditions are, by construction, consistent both with their parentsimulation and with each other; (iii) the field can easily be made public byreleasing a code to compute it - once public, phase information can be sharedor published by specifying a spatial location within the realisation. in thispaper we describe the principles behind creating such realisations. we definean example called panphasia and in a companion paper on arxiv (jenkins &amp;booth), make public a code to compute it. with fifty octree levels panphasiaspans a factor of more than 10^15 in linear scale - a range that significantlyexceeds the ratio of the current hubble radius to the putative cdmfree-streaming scale. we show how to modify a code used for making cosmologicaland resimulation initial conditions so that it can take the phase informationfrom panphasia and, using this code, we demonstrate that it is possible to makegood quality resimulation initial conditions. we define a convention forpublishing phase information from panphasia and publish the initial phases forseveral of the virgo consortium's most recent cosmological simulationsincluding the 303 billion particle mxxl simulation.

1308.1399	the properties of warm dark matter haloes	well-motivated elementary particle candidates for the dark matter, such asthe sterile neutrino, behave as warm dark matter (wdm).for particle masses oforder a kev, free streaming produces a cutoff in the linear fluctuation powerspectrum at a scale corresponding to dwarf galaxies. we investigate theabundance and structure of wdm haloes and subhaloes on these scales using highresolution cosmological n-body simulations of galactic haloes of mass similarto the milky way's. on scales larger than the free-streaming cutoff, theinitial conditions have the same power spectrum and phases as one of the colddark matter (cdm) haloes previously simulated by springel et al as part of thevirgo consortium aquarius project. we have simulated four haloes with wdmparticle masses in the range 1.4-2.3kev and, for one case, we have carried outfurther simulations at varying resolution. n-body simulations in which thepower spectrum cutoff is resolved are known to undergo artificial fragmentationin filaments producing spurious clumps which, for small masses (&lt;10^7msun inour case) outnumber genuine haloes. we have developed a robust algorithm toidentify these spurious objects and remove them from our halo catalogues. wefind that the wdm subhalo mass function is suppressed by well over an ordermagnitude relative to the cdm case for masses &lt;10^9msun. requiring that thereshould be at least as many subhaloes as there are observed satellites in themilky way leads to a conservative lower limit to the (thermal equivalent) wdmparticle mass of ~1.5\rmn{kev}. wdm haloes and subhaloes have cuspy densitydistributions that are well described by nfw or einasto profiles. their centraldensities are lower for lower wdm particle masses and none of the models wehave considered suffer from the "too big to fail" problem recently highlightedby boylan-kolchin et al.

1404.3724	bent by baryons: the low mass galaxy-halo relation	the relation between galaxies and dark matter halos is of vital importancefor evaluating theoretical predictions of structure formation and galaxyformation physics. we show that the widely used method of abundance matchingbased on dark matter only simulations fails at the low mass end because two ofits underlying assumptions are broken: only a small fraction of low mass (below10^9.5 solar masses) halos host a visible galaxy, and halos grow at a lowerrate due to the effect of baryons. in this regime, reliance on dark matter onlysimulations for abundance matching is neither accurate nor self-consistent. wefind that the reported discrepancy between observational estimates of the halomasses of dwarf galaxies and the values predicted by abundance matching doesnot point to a failure of lcdm, but simply to a failure to account for baryoniceffects. our results also imply that the local group contains only a fewhundred observable galaxies in contrast with the thousands of faint dwarfs thatabundance matching would suggest. we show how relations derived from abundancematching can be corrected, so that they can be used self-consistently tocalibrate models of galaxy formation.

1405.5216	dwarf galaxies in cdm and sidm with baryons: observational probes of the  nature of dark matter	we present the first cosmological simulations of dwarf galaxies, whichinclude dark matter self-interactions and baryons. we study two dwarf galaxieswithin cold dark matter, and four different elastic self-interacting scenarioswith constant and velocity-dependent cross sections, motivated by a new forcein the hidden dark matter sector. our highest resolution simulation has abaryonic mass resolution of $1.8\times 10^2\,{\rm m}_\odot$ and a gravitationalsoftening length of $34\,{\rm pc}$ at $z=0$. in this first study we focus onthe regime of mostly isolated dwarf galaxies with halo masses$\sim10^{10}\,{\rm m}_\odot$ where dark matter dynamically dominates even atsub-kpc scales. we find that while the global properties of galaxies of thisscale are minimally affected by allowed self-interactions, their internalstructures change significantly if the cross section is large enough within theinner sub-kpc region. in these dark-matter-dominated systems, self-scatteringties the shape of the stellar distribution to that of the dark matterdistribution. in particular, we find that the stellar core radius is closelyrelated to the dark matter core radius generated by self-interactions. darkmatter collisions lead to dwarf galaxies with larger stellar cores and smallerstellar central densities compared to the cold dark matter case. the centralmetallicity within $1\,{\rm kpc}$ is also larger by up to $\sim 15\%$ in theformer case. we conclude that the mass distribution, and characteristics of thecentral stars in dwarf galaxies can potentially be used to probe theself-interacting nature of dark matter.

1406.6362	the chosen few: the low mass halos that host faint galaxies	since reionization prevents star formation in most halos below 3 x 10^9 solarmasses, dwarf galaxies only populate a fraction of existing dark matter halos.we use hydrodynamic cosmological simulations of the local group to study thediscriminating factors for galaxy formation in the early universe and connectthem to the present-day properties of galaxies and halos. a combination ofselection effects related to reionization, and the subsequent evolution ofhalos in different environments, introduces strong biases between thepopulation of halos that host dwarf galaxies, and the total halo population.halos that host galaxies formed earlier and are more concentrated. in addition,halos more affected by tidal stripping are more likely to host a galaxy for agiven mass or maximum circular velocity, vmax, today. consequently, satellitehalos are populated more frequently than field halos, and satellite halos of10^8 - 10^9 solar masses or vmax of 12 - 20 km/s, similar to the local groupdwarf spheroidals, have experienced a greater than average reduction in bothmass and vmax after infall. they are on closer, more radial orbits with higherinfall velocities and earlier infall times. together, these effects make dwarfgalaxies highly biased tracers of the underlying dark matter distribution.

1407.5627	surface photometry of bcgs and intracluster stars in lambda-cdm	we simulate the phase-space distribution of stellar mass in 9 massivelambda-cdm galaxy clusters by applying the semi-analytic particle taggingmethod of cooper et al. to the phoenix suite of high-resolution n-bodysimulations (m200 = 7.5 to 33 x 10^14 msol). the resulting surface brightness(sb) profiles of brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) match well to observations.on average, stars formed in galaxies accreted by the bcg account for ~90 percent of its total mass (the remainder is formed in situ). in circularbcg-centred apertures, the superposition of multiple debris clouds (each ~10per cent of the total bcg mass) from different progenitors can result in anextensive outer diffuse component, qualitatively similar to a 'cd envelope'.these clouds typically originate from tidal stripping at z &lt; 1 and compriseboth streams and the extended envelopes of other massive galaxies in thecluster. stars at very low sb contribute a significant fraction of the totalcluster stellar mass budget: in the central 1 mpc^2 of a z ~ 0.15 clusterimaged at sdss-like resolution, our fiducial model predicts 80-95 per cent ofstellar mass below a sb of mu_v = 26.5 mag arcsec^2 is associated with accretedstars in the envelope of the bcg. the ratio of bcg stellar mass (including thisdiffuse component) to total cluster stellar mass is ~30 per cent.

1407.7040	the eagle project: simulating the evolution and assembly of galaxies and  their environments	we introduce the virgo consortium's eagle project, a suite of hydrodynamicalsimulations that follow the formation of galaxies and black holes inrepresentative volumes. we discuss the limitations of such simulations in lightof their finite resolution and poorly constrained subgrid physics, and howthese affect their predictive power. one major improvement is our treatment offeedback from massive stars and agn in which thermal energy is injected intothe gas without the need to turn off cooling or hydrodynamical forces, allowingwinds to develop without predetermined speed or mass loading factors. becausethe feedback efficiencies cannot be predicted from first principles, wecalibrate them to the z~0 galaxy stellar mass function and the amplitude of thegalaxy-central black hole mass relation, also taking galaxy sizes into account.the observed galaxy mass function is reproduced to $\lesssim 0.2$ dex over thefull mass range, $10^8 &lt; m_*/m_\odot \lesssim 10^{11}$, a level of agreementclose to that attained by semi-analytic models, and unprecedented forhydrodynamical simulations. we compare our results to a representative set oflow-redshift observables not considered in the calibration, and find goodagreement with the observed galaxy specific star formation rates, passivefractions, tully-fisher relation, total stellar luminosities of galaxyclusters, and column density distributions of intergalactic civ and ovi. whilethe mass-metallicity relations for gas and stars are consistent withobservations for $m_* \gtrsim 10^9 m_\odot$, they are insufficiently steep atlower masses. the gas fractions and temperatures are too high for clusters ofgalaxies, but for groups these discrepancies can be resolved by adopting ahigher heating temperature in the subgrid prescription for agn feedback. eagleconstitutes a valuable new resource for studies of galaxy formation.

1409.0723	cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters with feedback from active  galactic nuclei: profiles and scaling relations	we present results from a new set of 30 cosmological simulations of galaxyclusters, including the effects of radiative cooling, star formation, supernovafeedback, black hole growth and agn feedback. we first demonstrate that our agnmodel is capable of reproducing the observed cluster pressure profile atredshift, z~0, once the agn heating temperature of the targeted particles ismade to scale with the final virial temperature of the halo. this allows theejected gas to reach larger radii in higher-mass clusters than would bepossible had a fixed heating temperature been used. such a model alsosuccessfully reduces the star formation rate in brightest cluster galaxies andbroadly reproduces a number of other observational properties at low redshift,including baryon, gas and star fractions; entropy profiles outside the core;and the x-ray luminosity-mass relation. our results are consistent with thenotion that the excess entropy is generated via selective removal of thedensest material through radiative cooling; supernova and agn feedback largelyserve as regulation mechanisms, moving heated gas out of galaxies and away fromcluster cores. however, our simulations fail to address a number of seriousissues; for example, they are incapable of reproducing the shape and diversityof the observed entropy profiles within the core region. we also show that thestellar and black hole masses are sensitive to numerical resolution,particularly the gravitational softening length; a smaller value leads to moreefficient black hole growth at early times and a smaller central galaxy.

1409.8617	baryon effects on the internal structure of lcdm halos in the eagle  simulations	we investigate the internal structure and density profiles of halos of mass$10^{10}-10^{14}~m_\odot$ in the evolution and assembly of galaxies and theirenvironment (eagle) simulations. these follow the formation of galaxies in a$\lambda$cdm universe and include a treatment of the baryon physics thought tobe relevant. the eagle simulations reproduce the observed present-day galaxystellar mass function, as well as many other properties of the galaxypopulation as a function of time. we find significant differences between themasses of halos in the eagle simulations and in simulations that follow onlythe dark matter component. nevertheless, halos are well described by thenavarro-frenk-white (nfw) density profile at radii larger than ~5% of thevirial radius but, closer to the centre, the presence of stars can producecuspier profiles. central enhancements in the total mass profile are mostimportant in halos of mass $10^{12}-10^{13}m_\odot$, where the stellar fractionpeaks. over the radial range where they are well resolved, the resulting galaxyrotation curves are in very good agreement with observational data for galaxieswith stellar mass $m_*&lt;5\times10^{10}m_\odot$. we present an empirical fittingfunction that describes the total mass profiles and show that its parametersare strongly correlated with halo mass.

0804.0004	the clustering of the first galaxy halos	we explore the clustering properties of high redshift dark matter halos,focusing on halos massive enough to host early generations of stars or galaxiesat redshift 10 and greater. halos are extracted from an array of dark mattersimulations able to resolve down to the "mini-halo" mass scale at redshifts ashigh as 30, thus encompassing the expected full mass range of halos capable ofhosting luminous objects and sources of reionization. halo clustering onlarge-scales agrees with the sheth, mo &amp; tormen halo bias relation within allour simulations, greatly extending the regime where large-scale clustering isconfirmed to be "universal" at the 10-20% level (which means, for example, that3sigma halos of cluster mass at z=0 have the same large-scale bias with respectto the mass distribution as 3sigma halos of galaxy mass at z=10). however, onsmall-scales, the clustering of our massive halos (&gt; ~10^9 msun/h) at thesehigh redshifts is stronger than expected from comparisons with small-scale haloclustering extrapolated from lower redshifts. this implies "non-universality"in the scale-dependence of halo clustering, at least for the commonly usedparameterizations of the scale-dependence of bias that we consider. we providea fit for the scale-dependence of bias in our results. this study provides abasis for using extraordinarily high redshift galaxies (redshift ~10) as aprobe of cosmology and galaxy formation at its earliest stages. we show alsothat mass and halo kinematics are strongly affected by finite simulationvolumes. this suggests the potential for adverse affects on gas dynamics inhydrodynamic simulations of limited volumes, such as is typical in simulationsof the formation of the "first stars", though further study is warranted.

1411.0311	decaying dark matter: the case for a deep x-ray observation of draco	recent studies of m31, the galactic centre, and galaxy clusters have madetentative detections of an x-ray line at ~3.5 kev that could be produced bydecaying dark matter. we use high resolution simulations of the aquariusproject to predict the likely amplitude of the x-ray decay flux observed in thegc relative to that observed in m31, and also of the gc relative to other partsof the milky way halo and to dwarf spheroidal galaxies. we show that thereported detections from m31 and andromeda are compatible with each other, andwith upper limits arising from high galactic latitude observations, and imply adecay time {\tau} ~10^28 seconds. we argue that this interpretation can betested with deep observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies: in 95 per cent ofour mock observations, a 1.3 msec pointed observation of draco with xmm-newtonwill enable us to discover or rule out at the 3{\sigma} level an x-ray featurefrom dark matter decay at 3.5 kev, for decay times {\tau} &lt; 0.8x10^28 sec.

1501.01311	the eagle simulations of galaxy formation: calibration of subgrid  physics and model variations	we present results from thirteen cosmological simulations that explore theparameter space of the "evolution and assembly of galaxies and theirenvironments" (eagle) simulation project. four of the simulations follow theevolution of a periodic cube l = 50 cmpc on a side, and each employs adifferent subgrid model of the energetic feedback associated with starformation. the relevant parameters were adjusted so that the simulations eachreproduce the observed galaxy stellar mass function at z = 0.1. three of thesimulations fail to form disc galaxies as extended as observed, and we showanalytically that this is a consequence of numerical radiative losses thatreduce the efficiency of stellar feedback in high-density gas. such losses aregreatly reduced in the fourth simulation - the eagle reference model - byinjecting more energy in higher density gas. this model produces galaxies withthe observed size distribution, and also reproduces many galaxy scalingrelations. in the remaining nine simulations, a single parameter or process ofthe reference model was varied at a time. we find that the properties ofgalaxies with stellar mass &lt;~ m* (the "knee" of the galaxy stellar massfunction) are largely governed by feedback associated with star formation,while those of more massive galaxies are also controlled by feedback fromaccretion onto their central black holes. both processes must be efficient inorder to reproduce the observed galaxy population. in general, simulations thathave been calibrated to reproduce the low-redshift galaxy stellar mass functionwill still not form realistic galaxies, but the additional requirement thatgalaxy sizes be acceptable leads to agreement with a large range ofobservables.

1507.01998	the copernicus complexio: statistical properties of warm dark matter  haloes	the recent detection of a 3.5 kev x-ray line from the centres of galaxies andclusters by bulbul et al. (2014a) and boyarsky et al. (2014a) has beeninterpreted as emission from the decay of 7 kev sterile neutrinos which couldmake up the (warm) dark matter (wdm). as part of the copernicus complexio(coco) programme, we investigate the properties of dark matter haloes formed ina high-resolution cosmological $n$-body simulation from initial conditionssimilar to those expected in a universe in which the dark matter consists of 7kev sterile neutrinos. this simulation and its cold dark matter (cdm)counterpart have $\sim13.4$bn particles, each of mass $\sim 10^5\, h^{-1}m_\odot$, providing detailed information about halo structure and evolutiondown to dwarf galaxy mass scales. non-linear structure formation on smallscales ($m_{200}\, \leq\, 2 \times 10^9\,h^{-1}\,m_\odot$) begins slightlylater in coco-warm than in coco-cold. the halo mass function at the present dayin the wdm model begins to drop below its cdm counterpart at a mass $\sim 2\times 10^{9}\,h^{-1}\,m_\odot$ and declines very rapidly towards lower massesso that there are five times fewer haloes of mass $m_{200}=10^{8}\,h^{-1}\,m_\odot$ in coco-warm than in coco-cold. halo concentrations ondwarf galaxy scales are correspondingly smaller in coco-warm, and we provide asimple functional form that describes its evolution with redshift. the shapesof haloes are similar in the two cases, but the smallest haloes in coco-warmrotate slightly more slowly than their cdm counterparts.

1507.03643	the apostle project: local group kinematic mass constraints and  simulation candidate selection	we use a large sample of isolated dark matter halo pairs drawn fromcosmological n-body simulations to identify candidate systems whose kinematicsmatch that of the local group of galaxies (lg). we find, in agreement with the"timing argument" and earlier work, that the separation and approach velocityof the milky way (mw) and andromeda (m31) galaxies favour a total mass for thepair of ~ 5*10^12 m_sun. a mass this large, however, is difficult to reconcilewith the small relative tangential velocity of the pair, as well as with thesmall deceleration from the hubble flow observed for the most distant lgmembers. halo pairs that match these three criteria have average masses afactor of ~2 times smaller than suggested by the timing argument, but withlarge dispersion, spanning more than a decade in mass. guided by these results,we have selected 12 halo pairs with total mass in the range 1.6-3.6 *10^12m_sun for the apostle project (a project of simulations of the localenvironment), a suite of resimulations at various numerical resolution levels(reaching up to ~10^4 m_sun per gas particle) that use the hydrodynamical codeand subgrid physics developed for the eagle project. these simulationsreproduce, by construction, the main kinematics of the mw-m31 pair, and producesatellite populations whose overall number, luminosities, and kinematics are ingood agreement with observations of the mw and m31 companions. thesediagnostics are sensitive to the total mass assumed for the mw-m31 pair;indeed, the lg satellite population would be quite difficult to reproduce forpair masses as high as indicated by the timing argument. the apostle candidatesystems thus provide an excellent testbed to confront directly many of thepredictions of the lambda-cdm cosmology with observations of our localuniverse.

1511.01098	the apostle simulations: solutions to the local group's cosmic puzzles	the local group of galaxies offer some of the most discriminating tests ofmodels of cosmic structure formation. for example, observations of the milkyway (mw) and andromeda satellite populations appear to be in disagreement withn-body simulations of the "lambda cold dark matter" ({\lambda}cdm) model: thereare far fewer satellite galaxies than substructures in cold dark matter halos(the "missing satellites" problem); dwarf galaxies seem to avoid the mostmassive substructures (the "too-big-to-fail" problem); and the brightestsatellites appear to orbit their host galaxies on a thin plane (the "planes ofsatellites" problem). here we present results from apostle (a project ofsimulating the local environment), a suite of cosmological hydrodynamicsimulations of twelve volumes selected to match the kinematics of the localgroup (lg) members. applying the eagle code to the lg environment, we find thatour simulations match the observed abundance of lg galaxies, including thesatellite galaxies of the mw and andromeda. due to changes to the structure ofhalos and the evolution in the lg environment, the simulations reproduce theobserved relation between stellar mass and velocity dispersion of individualdwarf spheroidal galaxies without necessitating the formation of cores in theirdark matter profiles. satellite systems form with a range of spatialanisotropies, including one similar to that of the mw, confirming that such aconfiguration is not unexpected in {\lambda}cdm. finally, based on the observedvelocity dispersion, size, and stellar mass, we provide new estimates of themaximum circular velocity for the halos of nine mw dwarf spheroidals.

astro-ph;0002308	collisional versus collisionless dark matter	we compare the structure and substructure of dark matter halos in modeluniverses dominated by collisional, strongly self interacting dark matter(sidm) and collisionless, weakly interacting dark matter (cdm). while sidmvirialised halos are more nearly spherical than cdm halos, they can berotationally flattened by as much as 20% in their inner regions. substructurehalos suffer ram-pressure truncation and drag which are more rapid and severethan their gravitational counterparts tidal stripping and dynamical friction.lensing constraints on the size of galactic halos in clusters are a factor oftwo smaller than predicted by gravitational stripping, and the recent detectionof tidal streams of stars escaping from the satellite galaxy carina suggeststhat its tidal radius is close to its optical radius of a few hundred parsecs--- an order of magnitude smaller than predicted by cdm models but consistentwith sidm. the orbits of sidm satellites suffer significant velocity bias$\sigma_{sidm}/\sigma_{cdm}=0.85$ and are more circular than cdm,$\beta_{sidm}} \approx 0.5$, in agreement with the inferred orbits of thegalaxy's satellites. in the limit of a short mean free path, sidm halos havesingular isothermal density profiles, thus in its simplest incarnation sidm isinconsistent with galactic rotation curves.

astro-ph;0106462	including star formation and supernova feedback within cosmological  simulations of galaxy formation	we investigate phenomenological models of star formation and supernovafeedback in n-body/sph simulations of galaxy formation. first, we comparedifferent prescriptions in the literature for turning cold gas into starsneglecting feedback effects. we find that most prescriptions give broadlysimilar results: the ratio of cold gas to stars in the final galaxies isprimarily controlled by the range of gas densities where star formation isallowed to proceed efficiently. in the absence of feedback, the fraction of gasthat cools is much too high resulting, for example, in a k-band luminosityfunction that is much brighter than observed. this problem is ameliorated byincluding a feedback model which either imparts radial kinetic perturbations togalactic gas or directly reheats such material and prevents it from cooling fora certain period of time. in both these models, a significant fraction of coldgas is heated and expelled from haloes with an efficiency that varies inverselywith with halo circular velocity. increasing the resolution of a simulationallows a wider dynamic range in mass to be followed, but the average propertiesof the resolved galaxy population remain largely unaffected. however, as theresolution is increased, more and more gas is reheated by small galaxies; ourresults suggest that convergence requires the full mass range of galaxies to beresolved.

astro-ph;0212357	the halo occupation distribution and the physics of galaxy formation	the halo occupation distribution (hod) describes the bias between galaxiesand dark matter by specifying (a) the probability p(n|m) that a halo of virialmass m contains n galaxies of a particular class and (b) the relativedistributions of galaxies and dark matter within halos. we calculate predictedhods for a lambda-cdm cosmological model using an sph hydrodynamic simulationand a semi-analytic (sa) galaxy formation model. although the two methodspredict different galaxy mass functions, their hod predictions agree remarkablywell. for mass-selected samples, the mean occupation &lt;n(m)&gt; exhibits a sharpcutoff at low halo masses, a slowly rising plateau for &lt;n&gt;~1-2, and a moresteeply rising high occupancy regime. at low &lt;n&gt;, the mean pair and triplecounts are well below poisson expectations, with important consequences forsmall scale behavior of 2- and 3-point correlation functions. the hod dependsstrongly on galaxy age, with high mass halos populated mainly by old galaxiesand low mass halos by young galaxies. the sph simulation supports severalsimplifying assumptions about hod bias: the most massive galaxy in a halousually lies close to the center and moves near the halo's mean velocity;satellite galaxies have the same radial profile and velocity dispersion as thedark matter; and the mean occupation at fixed halo mass is independent of thehalo's larger scale environment. by applying the sph and sa hods to a largevolume n-body simulation, we show that both methods predict slight, observabledepartures from a power-law galaxy correlation function. the predicted hods areclosely tied to the underlying galaxy formation physics, they offer usefulguidance to theoretical models of galaxy clustering, and they will be testedempirically by ongoing analyses of galaxy redshift surveys.

astro-ph;0305286	cosmic structure growth and dark energy	dark energy has a dramatic effect on the dynamics of the universe, causingthe recently discovered acceleration of the expansion. the dynamics are alsocentral to the behavior of the growth of large scale structure, offering thepossibility that observations of structure formation provide a sensitive probeof the cosmology and dark energy characteristics. in particular, dark energywith a time varying equation of state can have an influence on structureformation stretching back well into the matter dominated epoch. we analyze thisimpact, first calculating the linear perturbation results, including those forweak gravitational lensing. these dynamical models possess definite observabledifferences from constant equation of state models. then we present a largescale numerical simulation of structure formation, including the largest volumeto date involving a time varying equation of state. we find the halo massfunction is well described by the jenkins et al. mass function formula. we alsoshow how to interpret modifications of the friedmann equation in terms of atime variable equation of state. the results presented here provide stepstoward realistic computation of the effect of dark energy in cosmologicalprobes involving large scale structure, such as cluster counts,sunyaev-zel'dovich effect, or weak gravitational lensing.

astro-ph;0311231	the inner structure of lambdacdm halos iii: universality and asymptotic  slopes	we investigate the mass profile of lambdacdm halos using a suite of numericalsimulations spanning five decades in halo mass, from dwarf galaxies to richgalaxy clusters. our analysis confirms the proposal of navarro, frenk &amp; white(nfw) that the shape of lambdacdm halo mass profiles differs strongly from apower law and depends little on mass. the logarithmic slope of thespherically-averaged density profile, as measured by beta=-dln(rho)/dln(r),decreases monotonically towards the center and becomes shallower thanisothermal (beta&lt;2) inside a characteristic radius, r_{-2}. although thefitting formula proposed by nfw provides a reasonably good approximation to thedensity and circular velocity profiles of individual halos, systematicdeviations from the best nfw fits are also noticeable. inside r_{-2}, theprofile of simulated halos gets shallower with radius more gradually thanpredicted and, as a result, nfw fits tend to underestimate the dark matterdensity in these regions. this discrepancy has been interpreted as indicating asteeply divergent cusp, but our results suggest a different interpretation. weuse the density and enclosed mass at our innermost resolved radii to placestrong constraints on beta_{0}: density cusps as steep as r^{-1.5} areinconsistent with most of our simulations, although beta_{0}=1 is stillconsistent with our data. our density profiles show no sign of converging to awell-defined asymptotic inner power law. we propose a simple formula thatreproduces the radial dependence of the slope better than the nfw profile, andso may minimize errors when extrapolating our results inward to radii not yetreliably probed by numerical simulations.

astro-ph;0312499	early formation and late merging of the giant galaxies	the most luminous galaxies in the present universe are found at the centersof the most massive dark matter haloes, rich galaxy clusters. in the lcdmcosmology, such massive halo cores are present at redshift z=6 with a comovingnumber density (as a function of mass interior to ~10 kpc) that is comparableto today's value. the identity of the matter in these central regions is,however, predicted to change as major mergers bring together stars and darkmatter from initially well separated sub-units. we use n-body simulations toinvestigate how these mergers push pre-existing matter outwards in the dominantgalaxy while preserving the inner density profile of collisionless matter. itappears that the central regions of large galaxies end up dominated by starsformed in a number of dense cores, well before the last major mergers. thedensity profile of collisionless matter (stars and dark matter combined) inthese central regions appears to be stable and to have attractor-like behaviorunder merging. this suggests that the baryon loading associated withdissipative contraction and star formation may be erased as subsequent mergersdrive the mass distribution back to a universal profile. such suppression ofthe effects of baryon loading, along with the early assembly of massconcentrations, may help resolve some apparent challenges to the cdm model forstructure formation.

astro-ph;0404589	the subhalo populations of lcdm dark haloes	we use a large cosmological simulation and a variety of high resolutionresimulations of individual cluster and galaxy haloes to study the systematicsof subhalo populations over ranges of 1000 in halo mass and 1000 in the ratioof subhalo to parent halo mass. the subhalo populations of different haloes arenot scaled copies of each other, but vary systematically with halo properties.on average, the amount of substructure increases with halo mass. at fixed mass,it decreases with halo concentration and with halo formation redshift. thesetrends are comparable in size to the scatter in subhalo abundance betweensimilar haloes. averaged over all haloes of given mass, the abundance of lowmass subhaloes per unit parent halo mass is independendent of parent mass.it isvery similar to the abundance per unit mass of low mass haloes in the universeas a whole, once differing boundary definitions for subhaloes and haloes areaccounted for. the radial distribution of subhaloes within their parent haloesis substantially less centrally concentrated than that of the dark matter. itvaries at most weakly with the mass(or concentration) of the parent halo andnot at all with subhalo mass. it does depend on the criteria used to define thesubhalo population considered. about 90% of present-day subhaloes were accretedafter z=1 and about 70% after z=0.5. only about 8% the total mass of all haloesaccreted at z=1 survives as bound subhaloes at z=0. for haloes accreted at z=2,the survival mass fraction is just 2%. subhaloes seen near the centre of theirparent typically were accreted earlier and retain less of their original massthan those seen near the edge. these strong systematics mean that comparisonwith galaxies in real clusters is only possible if the formation of theluminous component is modelled appropriately.

astro-ph;0407058	cosmological simulations of the intracluster medium	we investigate the properties of the intracluster medium (icm) that formswithin n-body/hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters in a \lambdacdmcosmology. when radiative cooling and a simple model for galactic feedback areincluded, our clusters have x-ray luminosities and temperatures in goodagreement with observed systems, demonstrating the required excess entropy intheir cores. more generally, cooling and feedback increases the entropy of theicm everywhere, albeit without significantly affecting the slope of the profile(s prop. to r) at large radii. the temperature of the icm is only modestlyincreased by these processes, with projected temperature profiles being inreasonable agreement with the observations. star/galaxy formation is still tooefficient in our simulations, however, and so our gas mass fractions are around60 per cent of the observed value at r_{2500}. finally, we examine thereliability of using the hydrostatic equilibrium equation to estimate clustermasses and find that it underpredicts the true mass of our clusters by up to 20per cent, due to incomplete thermalisation of the gas. feedback reduces thisdiscrepancy, however, with estimates being accurate to within 10 per cent outto r_{500}.

astro-ph;0503003	early structure in lcdm	we use a novel technique to simulate the growth of the most massiveprogenitor of a protocluster region from redshift z~80, when its mass was about10 msun until the present day. our nested sequence of n-body resimulationsallows us to study in detail the structure both of the dark matter objectitself and of its environment. our effective resolution is optimal at redshiftsof 49, 29, 12, 5 and 0 when the dominant object has mass 1.2e5, 5e7, 2e10, 3e12and 8e14 msun/hrespectively, and contains ~1e6 simulation particles within itsvirial radius. extended press-schechter theory correctly predicts both thisrapid growth and the substantial overabundance of massive haloes we find atearly times in regions surrounding the dominant object. although thelarge-scale structure in these regions differs dramatically from a scaledversion of its present-day counterpart, the internal structure of the dominantobject is remarkably similar. molecular hydrogen cooling could start as earlyas z~49 in this object, while cooling by atomic hydrogen becomes effective atz~39. if the first stars formed in haloes with virial temperature ~2000, theircomoving abundance by z=49 would be similar to that of dwarf galaxies today,while their comoving correlation length would be ~2.5mpc/h.

astro-ph;0503400	the distribution of satellite galaxies: the great pancake	the 11 known satellite galaxies within 250 kpc of the milky way lie close toa great circle on the sky. we use high resolution n-body simulations ofgalactic dark matter halos to test if this remarkable property can beunderstood within the context of the cold dark matter cosmology. we constructhalo merger trees from the simulations and use a semianalytic model to followthe formation of satellite galaxies. we find that in all 6 of our simulations,the 11 brightest satellites are indeed distributed along thin, disk-likestructures analogous to that traced by the milky way's satellites. this is insharp contrast to the overall distributions of dark matter in the halo and ofsubhalos within it which, although triaxial, are not highly aspherical. we findthat the spatial distribution of satellites is significantly different fromthat of the most massive subhalos but is similar to that of the subset ofsubhalos that had the most massive progenitors at earlier times. the elongateddisk-like structure delineated by the satellites has its long axis aligned withthe major axis of the dark matter halo. we interpret our results as reflectingthe preferential infall of satellites along the spines of a few filaments ofthe cosmic web.

astro-ph;0503676	the effects of feedback on the morphology of galaxy discs	we have performed hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation in a lcdmuniverse. we have followed galaxy formation in a dark matter halo, chosen tohave a relatively quiet recent merger history, using different models for starformation and feedback. in all cases, we have adopted a multi-phase descriptionof the interstellar medium and modelled star formation in quiescent and burstmodes. we have explored two triggers for starbursts: strong shocks and high gasdensity, allowing for the possibility that stars in the burst may form with atop-heavy initial mass function. we find that the final morphology of thegalaxy is extremely sensitive to the modelling of star formation and feedback.starting from identical initial conditions, galaxies spanning the wide range ofhubble types, with b-band disc-to-total luminosity ratios ranging from 0.25 to0.9, can form in the same dark matter halo. models in which starbursts areinduced by high gas density (qualitatively similar to models in which feedbackis produced by agn) generate energetic winds and result in galaxies with anearly-type morphology. models in which the starbursts are induced by strongshocks lead to extended discs. in this case, the feedback associated with thebursts suppresses the collapse of baryons in small halos, helping to create areservoir of hot gas that is available for cooling after $z = 1$, following thebulk of the dynamical activity that builds up the halo. this gas then cools toform a large, young stellar disc.

astro-ph;0504038	the first generation of star-forming haloes	we model gas cooling in high-resolution n-body simulations in order toinvestigate the formation of the first generation of stars. we follow a regionof a lcdm universe especially selected to contain a rich cluster by the presentday. the properties of the dark haloes that form in these sub-solar massresolution simulations are presented in a companion paper by gao et al. thefirst gas clouds able to cool by molecular hydrogen line emission collapse atextremely high redshift, z ~ 47, when the mass of the dark halo is 2.4 x 10^5msun/h. by z ~ 30, a substantial population of haloes are capable of undergoingmolecular hydrogen cooling although their ability to form stars is dependent onthe efficiency of feedback processes such as dissociating lyman-wernerradiation. the mass of the main halo grows extremely rapidly and, by z ~ 36,its virial temperature has reached 10^4k, at which point gas cooling becomesdominated by more effective atomic line processes. by z ~ 30, a small ``group''of such potential galaxies will have formed unless prevented from doing so byfeedback processes. by this redshift, massive (&gt;~ 100 msun) population iiistars are able to ionise gas well beyond their own host halo and neighbouringhii regions can percolate to form an ionized superbubble. such patches would betoo widely separated to contribute significantly to reionisation at this time.the large number density of early cooling haloes in the pre-reionised universeraises the exciting prospect that this ultra-early generation of stars may beobservable as gamma-ray bursts or supernovae.

astro-ph;0510488	a marked correlation function analysis of halo formation times in the  millennium simulation	we study the environmental dependence of the formation epoch of dark matterhaloes in the millennium simulation: a ten billion particle n-body simulationof standard lambdacdm cosmology. a sensitive test of this dependence - themarked correlation function - reveals highly significant evidence that haloesof a given mass form earlier in denser regions. we define a markedcross-correlation function, which helps quantify how this effect depends uponthe choice of the halo population used to define the environment. the mean haloformation redshift as a function of the local overdensity in dark matter isalso well determined, and we see an especially clear dependence forgalaxy-sized haloes. this contradicts one of the basic predictions of theexcursion set model of structure formation, even though we see that this theorypredicts other features of the distribution of halo formation epochs ratherwell. it also invalidates an assumption usually employed in the popular halo,or hod, models of galaxy clustering, namely that the distribution of haloproperties is a function of halo mass but not of halo environment.

0809.0894	a blueprint for detecting supersymmetric dark matter in the galactic  halo	dark matter is the dominant form of matter in the universe, but its nature isunknown. it is plausibly an elementary particle, perhaps the lightestsupersymmetric partner of known particle species. in this case, annihilation ofdark matter in the halo of the milky way should produce gamma-rays at a levelwhich may soon be observable. previous work has argued that the annihilationsignal will be dominated by emission from very small clumps (perhaps smallereven than the earth) which would be most easily detected where they clustertogether in the dark matter halos of dwarf satellite galaxies. here we show,using the largest ever simulation of the formation of a galactic halo, thatsuch small-scale structure will, in fact, have a negligible impact on darkmatter detectability. rather, the dominant and likely most easily detectablesignal will be produced by diffuse dark matter in the main halo of the milkyway. if the main halo is strongly detected, then small dark matter clumpsshould also be visible, but may well contain no stars, thereby confirming a keyprediction of the cold dark matter (cdm) model.

0809.0898	the aquarius project: the subhalos of galactic halos	we have performed the largest ever particle simulation of a milky way-sizeddark matter halo, and present the most comprehensive convergence study for anindividual dark matter halo carried out thus far. we have also simulated asample of 6 ultra-highly resolved milky-way sized halos, allowing us toestimate the halo-to-halo scatter in substructure statistics. in our largestsimulation, we resolve nearly 300,000 gravitationally bound subhalos within thevirialized region of the halo. simulations of the same object differing in massresolution by factors up to 1800 accurately reproduce the largest subhalos withthe same mass, maximum circular velocity and position, and yield goodconvergence for the abundance and internal properties of dark mattersubstructures. we detect up to four generations of subhalos within subhalos,but contrary to recent claims, we find less substructure in subhalos than inthe main halo when regions of equal mean overdensity are compared. the overallsubstructure mass fraction is much lower in subhalos than in the main halo.extrapolating the main halo's subhalo mass spectrum down to an earth mass, wepredict the mass fraction in substructure to be well below 3% within 100 kpc,and to be below 0.1% within the solar circle. the inner density profiles ofsubhalos show no sign of converging to a fixed asymptotic slope and are wellfit by gently curving profiles of einasto form. the mean concentrations ofisolated halos are accurately described by the fitting formula of neto et al.down to maximum circular velocities of 1.5 km/s, an extrapolation over some 5orders of magnitude in mass. however, at equal maximum circular velocity,subhalos are more concentrated than field halos, with a characteristic densitythat is typically ~2.6 times larger and increases towards the halo centre.

astro-ph;0607150	the halo mass function from the dark ages through the present day	we use an array of high-resolution n-body simulations to determine the massfunction of dark matter haloes at redshifts 10-30. we develop a new method forcompensating for the effects of finite simulation volume that allows us to findan approximation to the true ``global'' mass function. by simulating a widerange of volumes at different mass resolution, we calculate the abundance ofhaloes of mass 10^{5-12} msun/h. this enables us to predict accurately theabundance of the haloes that host the sources that reionize the universe. inparticular, we focus on the small mass haloes (&gt;~10^{5.5-6} msun/h) likely toharbour population iii stars where gas cools by molecular hydrogen emission,early galaxies in which baryons cool by atomic hydrogen emission at a virialtemperature of ~10^4k (10^{7.5-8} msun/h), and massive galaxies that may beobservable at redshift ~10. when we combine our data with simulations thatinclude high mass halos at low redshift, we find that the best fit to the halomass function depends not only on linear overdensity, as is commonly assumed inanalytic models, but also upon the slope of the linear power spectrum at thescale of the halo mass. the press-schechter model gives a poor fit to the halomass function in the simulations at all epochs; the sheth-tormen model gives abetter match, but still overpredicts the abundance of rare objects at all timesby up to 50%. finally, we consider the consequences of the recently releasedwmap 3-year cosmological parameters. these lead to much less structure at highredshift, reducing the number of z=10 ``mini-haloes'' by more than a factor oftwo and the number of z=30 galaxy hosts by more than four orders of magnitude.code to generate our best-fit halo mass function may be downloaded fromhttp://icc.dur.ac.uk/research/publicdownloads/genmf_readme.html

astro-ph;0607237	satellite systems around galaxies in hydrodynamic simulations	we investigate the properties of satellite galaxies formed in n-body/sphsimulations of galaxy formation in the $\lambda$cdm cosmology. the simulationsinclude the main physical effects thought to be important in galaxy formationand, in several cases, produce realistic spiral discs. in total, a sample of 9galaxies of luminosity comparable to the milky way was obtained. at magnitudesbrighter than the resolution limit, $m_v=-12$, the luminosity function of thesatellite galaxies in the simulations is in excellent agreement with data forthe local group. the radial number density profile of the model satellites, aswell as their gas fractions also match observations very well. in agreementwith previous n-body studies, we find that the satellites tend to bedistributed in highly flattened configurations whose major axis is aligned withthe major axis of the (generally triaxial) dark halo. in 2 out of 3 systemswith sufficiently large satellite populations, the satellite system is nearlyperpendicular to the plane of the galactic disc, a configuration analogous tothat observed in the milk way. the discs themselves are perpendicular to theminor axis of their host halos in the inner parts, and the correlation betweenthe orientation of the galaxy and the shape of the halo persists even out tothe virial radius. however, in one case the disc's minor axis ends up, at thevirial radius, perpendicular to the minor axis of the halo. the angular momentaof the galaxies and their host halo tend to be well aligned.

astro-ph;0608190	formation of z ~ 6 quasars from hierarchical galaxy mergers	the discovery of luminous quasars at redshift z ~ 6 indicates the presence ofsupermassive black holes (smbhs) of mass ~10^9 msun when the universe was lessthan one billion years old. this finding presents several challenges fortheoretical models. here, we present the first multi-scale simulations that,together with a self-regulated model for the smbh growth, produce a luminousquasar at z ~ 6.5 in the lcdm paradigm. we follow the hierarchical assemblyhistory of the most massive halo in a ~ 3 gpc^3 volume, and find that this haloof ~ 8x 10^{12} msun forming at z ~ 6.5 after several major mergers is able toreproduce a number of observed properties of sdss j1148+5251, the most distantquasar detected at z =6.42 (fan et al. 2003). moreover, the smbhs grow throughgas accretion below the eddington limit in a self-regulated manner owing tofeedback. we find that the progenitors experience significant star formation(up to 10^4 msun/yr) preceding the major quasar phase such that the stellarmass of the quasar host reaches 10^{12} msun at z ~ 6.5, consistent withobservations of significant metal enrichment in sdss j1148+5251. our resultsprovide a viable formation mechanism for z ~ 6 quasars in the standard lcdmcosmology, and demonstrate a common, merger-driven origin for the rarestquasars and the fundamental smbh-host correlation in a hierarchicaluniverse.(abridged)

astro-ph;0608607	the spin and shape of dark matter haloes in the millennium simulation of  a lambdacdm universe	we investigate the spins and shapes of over a million dark matter haloesidentified at z=0 in the millennium simulation. our sample spans halo massesranging from dwarf galaxies to rich galaxy clusters. the very large dynamicrange of this simulation enables the distribution of spins and shapes and theirvariation with halo mass and environment to be characterised with unprecedentedprecision. we compare results for haloes identified using different algorithms,including a novel one based on the branches of the halo merger trees. weinvestigate (and remove) biases in the estimate of angular momentum introducedby both the algorithms themselves and by numerical effects. we find that forthis many objects, the traditional lognormal function is no longer an adequatedescription of the distribution of the dimensionless spin parameter lambda, andwe provide a different function that gives a better fit. the variation of spinwith halo mass is weak but detectable, although the trend depends strongly onthe halo definition used. the haloes exhibit a range of shapes, with apreference for prolateness over oblateness. more massive haloes tend to be lessspherical and more prolate. we find that the more spherical haloes have spin inthe median, and those closest to spherical have a spin independent of mass. themost massive have a spin independent of shape. the majority of haloes havetheir angular momentum vector aligned with their minor axis and perpendicularto their major axis. we find that higher tend to be more clustered, with astronger effect for more massive haloes.

astro-ph;0610602	the baryon fraction of lambdacdm haloes	we investigate the baryon fraction in dark matter haloes formed innon-radiative gas-dynamical simulations of the lambdacdm cosmogony. bycombining a realisation of the millennium simulation (springel et al.) with asimulation of a smaller volume focussing on dwarf haloes, our study spans fivedecades in halo mass, from 10^10 msun/h to 10^15 msun/h. we find that thebaryon fraction within the halo virial radius is typically 90% of the cosmicmean, with an rms scatter of 6%, independently of redshift and of halo massdown to the smallest resolved haloes. our results show that, contrary to theproposal of mo et al. (2005), pre-virialisation gravitational heating is unableto prevent the collapse of gas within galactic and proto-galactic haloes, andconfirm the need for non-gravitational feedback in order to reduce theefficiency of gas cooling and star formation in dwarf galaxy haloes.simulations including a simple photoheating model (where a gas temperaturefloor of t_{floor} = 2x10^4 k is imposed from z=11) confirm earlier suggestionsthat photoheating can only prevent the collapse of baryons in systems withvirial temperatures t_{200} &lt; ~2.2 t_{floor} ~ 4.4x10^4 k (corresponding to avirial mass of m_{200} ~ 10^10 msun/h and a circular velocity of v_{200} ~ 35km/s). photoheating may thus help regulate the formation of dwarf spheroidalsand other galaxies at the extreme faint-end of the luminosity function, but itcannot, on its own, reconcile the abundance of sub-l* galaxies with the vastnumber of dwarf haloes expected in the lambdacdm cosmogony. the lack ofevolution or mass dependence seen in the baryon fraction augurs well for x-raycluster studies that assume a universal and non-evolving baryon fraction toplace constraints on cosmological parameters.

astro-ph;9707167	arc statistics with realistic cluster potentials. iv. clusters in  different cosmologies	we use numerical simulations of galaxy clusters in different cosmologies tostudy their ability to form large arcs. the cosmological models are: standardcdm (scdm; omega_0=1, omega_lambda=0); taucdm with reduced small-scale power(parameters as scdm, but with a smaller shape parameter of the power spectrum);open cdm (ocdm; omega_0=0.3, omega_lambda=0); and spatially flat, low-densitycdm (lambdacdm; omega_0=0.3, omega_lambda=0.7). all models are normalised tothe local number density of rich clusters. simulating gravitational lensing bythese clusters, we compute optical depths for the formation of large arcs. forlarge arcs with length-to-width ratio &gt;= 10, the optical depth is largest forocdm. relative to ocdm, the optical depth is lower by about an order ofmagnitude for lambdacdm, and by about two orders of magnitude for s/taucdm.these differences originate from the different epochs of cluster formationacross the cosmological models, and from the non-linearity of the stronglensing effect. we conclude that only the ocdm model can reproduce the observedarc abundance well, while the other models fail to do so by orders ofmagnitude.

astro-ph;9808257	galaxy clusters in the hubble volume simulations	we report on analyses of cluster samples obtained from the hubble volumesimulations. these simulations, an $\omega=1$ model named $\tau$cdm and a flatlow $\omega$ model with a cosmological constant ($\lambda$cdm), comprise thelargest computational efforts to date in numerical cosmology. we investigatethe presence of massive galaxy clusters at $z\approx 0.8$. the $\tau$cdm modelfails to form clusters at such a redshift. however, due to the small number ofobserved clusters around $z\approx 0.8$ and the uncertainties in thedeterminations of their masses, this conclusion still is somewhat preliminary.we produce cluster catalogs at $z=0$ for both cosmologies and investigate theirtwo--point correlation function $\xi$. we show that the relationship betweenthe mean density of subsamples of clusters, expressed via their mean separation$d_{\rm c}$, and the correlation length $r_0$, defined through $\xi(r_0) = 1$,is not linear but turns over gently for large $d_{\rm c}$. an analyticprediction by mo &amp; white (1996) overpredicts $r_0$. the results from theanalysis of the apm cluster data by croft et al. (1997) are nicely matched bythe $\lambda$cdm model.

astro-ph;9912238	experimental cosmic statistics ii: distribution	colombi et al. 1999 (paper i) investigated the counts-in-cells statistics andtheir respective errors in the $\tau$cdm virgo hubble volume simulation. thisextremely large $n$-body experiment also allows a numerical investigation ofthe {\em cosmic distribution function}, $\upsilon(\ta)$ itself for the firsttime. for a statistic $a$, $\upsilon(\ta)$ is the probability density ofmeasuring the value $\ta$ in a finite galaxy catalog. $\upsilon$ was evaluatedfor the distribution of counts-in-cells, $p_n$, the factorial moments, $f_k$,and the cumulants, $\xiav$ and $s_n$'s, using the same subsamples as paper i.while paper i concentrated on the first two moments of $\upsilon$, i.e. themean, the cosmic error and the cross-correlations, here the function $\upsilon$is studied in its full generality, including a preliminary analysis of jointdistributions $\upsilon(\ta,\tb)$. the most significant, and reassuring resultfor the analyses of future galaxy data is that the cosmic distribution functionis nearly gaussian provided its variance is small. a good practical criterionfor the relative cosmic error is that $\delta a/a \la 0.2$. this means that foraccurate measurements, the theory of the cosmic errors, presented by szapudi &amp;colombi (1996) and szapudi, colombi &amp; bernardeau (1999), and confirmedempirically by paper i, is sufficient for a full statistical description andthus for a maximum likelihood rating of models. as the cosmic error increases,the cosmic distribution function $\upsilon$ becomes increasingly skewed and iswell described by a generalization of the lognormal distribution. the cosmicskewness is introduced as an additional free parameter.

0809.4488	towards accurate modelling of the isw effect, the non-linear  contribution	in a universe with a cosmological constant, the large-scale gravitationalpotential varies in time and this is, in principle, observable. using an n-bodysimulation of a $\lambda$cdm universe, we show that linear theory is notsufficiently accurate to predict the power spectrum of the time derivative,$\dot{\phi}$, needed to compute the imprint of large-scale structure on thecosmic microwave background (cmb). the linear part of the $\dot{\phi}$ powerspectrum (the integrated sachs-wolfe effect or isw) drops quickly as therelative importance of $\omega_{\lambda}$ diminishes at high redshift, whilethe non-linear part (the rees-sciama effect or rs) evolves more slowly withredshift. therefore, the deviation of the total power spectrum from lineartheory occurs at larger scales at higher redshifts. the deviation occurs at$k\sim 0.1 $ $h$ mpc$^{-1}$ at $z=0$. the cross-correlation power spectrum ofthe density $\delta$ with $\dot{\phi}$ behaves differently to the powerspectrum of $\dot{\phi}$. firstly, the deviation from linear theory occurs atsmaller scales ($k\sim 1 $ $h$ mpc$^{-1}$ at $z=0$). secondly, the correlationbecomes negative when the non-linear effect dominates. for thecross-correlation power spectrum of galaxy samples with the cmb, the non-lineareffect becomes significant at $l\sim 500$ and rapidly makes the cross powerspectrum negative. for high redshift samples, the cross-correlation is expectedto be suppressed by $5-10%$ on arcminute scales. the rs effect makes anegligible contribution to the large-scale isw cross-correlation measurement.however, on arc-minute scales it will contaminate the expectedcross-correlation signal induced by the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect.

0810.1522	the diversity and similarity of simulated cold dark matter halos	we study the mass, velocity dispersion, and anisotropy profiles of$\lambda$cdm halos using a suite of n-body simulations of unprecedentednumerical resolution (the {\it aquarius project}). our analysis confirms anumber of results claimed by earlier work, and clarifies a few issues whereconflicting claims may be found in the recent literature. thespherically-averaged density profile becomes progressively shallower inwardsand, at the innermost resolved radius, the logarithmic slope is $\gamma \equiv-$d$\ln\rho/$d$\ln r \simlt 1$. asymptotic inner slopes as steep as therecently claimed $\rho \propto r^{-1.2}$ are clearly ruled out. the radialdependence of $\gamma$ is well approximated by a power-law, $\gamma \proptor^{\alpha}$ (the einasto profile). the shape parameter, $\alpha$, variesslightly but significantly from halo to halo, implying that the mass profilesof $\lambda$cdm halos are not strictly universal: different halos cannot, ingeneral, be rescaled to look identical. departures from similarity are alsoseen in velocity dispersion profiles and correlate with those in densityprofiles so as to preserve a power-law form for the spherically averagedpseudo-phase-space density, $\rho/\sigma^3\propto r^{-1.875}$. our conclusionsare reliable down to radii below 0.4% of the virial radius, providingwell-defined predictions for halo structure when baryonic effects areneglected, and thus an instructive theoretical template against which themodifications induced by the baryonic components of real galaxies can bejudged.

0810.2300	mock galaxy redshift catalogues from simulations: implications for  pan-starrs1	we describe a method for constructing mock galaxy catalogues which are wellsuited for use in conjunction with large photometric surveys. we use thesemi-analytic galaxy formation model of bower et al. implemented in themillennium simulation. we apply our method to the specific case of the surveyssoon to commence with ps1, the first of 4 telescopes planned for the pan-starrssystem. ps1 has 5 photometric bands (grizy), and will carry out an all-sky 3pisurvey and a medium deep survey (mds) over 84 sq.deg. we calculate the expectedmagnitude limits for extended sources in the two surveys. we find that, after 3years, the 3pi survey will have detected over 10^8 galaxies in all 5 bands, 10million of which will lie at redshift z&gt;0.9, while the mds will have detectedover 10^7 galaxies with 0.5 million lying at z&gt;2. these numbers at least doubleif detection in the shallowest band, y is not required. we then evaluate theaccuracy of photometric redshifts estimated using an off-the-shelf photo-zcode. with the grizy bands alone it is possible to achieve an accuracy in the3pi survey of delta z/(1+z)~0.06 for 0.25&lt;z&lt;0.8, which could be reduced byabout 15% using near infrared photometry from the ukidds survey, but wouldincrease by about 25% for the deeper sample without the y band photometry. forthe mds an accuracy of delta z/(1+z)~0.05 is achievable for 0.02&lt;z&lt;1.5 usinggrizy. a dramatic improvement in accuracy is possible by selecting only redgalaxies. in this case, delta z/(1+z)~0.02-0.04 is achievable for ~100 milliongalaxies at 0.4&lt;z&lt;1.1 in the 3pi survey and for 30 million galaxies in the mdsat 0.4&lt;z&lt;2. we investigate the effect of using photo-z in the estimate of thebaryonic acoustic oscillation scale. we find that ps1 will achieve a similaraccuracy in this estimate as a spectroscopic survey of 20 million galaxies.

0812.0362	phase-space structure in the local dark matter distribution and its  signature in direct detection experiments	we study predictions for dark matter phase-space structure near the sun basedon high-resolution simulations of six galaxy halos taken from the aquariusproject. the local dm density distribution is predicted to be remarkablysmooth; the density at the sun differs from the mean over a best-fitellipsoidal equidensity contour by less than 15% at the 99.9% confidence level.the local velocity distribution is also very smooth, but it differssystematically from a (multivariate) gaussian distribution. this is not due tothe presence of individual clumps or streams, but to broad features in thevelocity modulus and energy distributions that are stable both in space andtime and reflect the detailed assembly history of each halo. these featureshave a significant impact on the signals predicted for wimp and axion searches.for example, wimp recoil rates can deviate by ~10% from those expected from thebest-fit multivariate gaussian models. the axion spectra in our simulationstypically peak at lower frequencies than in the case of multivariate gaussianvelocity distributions. also in this case, the spectra show significantimprints of the formation of the halo. this implies that once direct dmdetection has become routine, features in the detector signal will allow us tostudy the dark matter assembly history of the milky way. a new field, "darkmatter astronomy", will then emerge.
