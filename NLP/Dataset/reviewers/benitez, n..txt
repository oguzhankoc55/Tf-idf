0902.2403	near-ir galaxy counts and evolution from the wide-field alhambra survey	the alhambra survey aims to cover 4 square degrees using a system of 20contiguous, equal width, medium-band filters spanning the range 3500 a to 9700a plus the standard jhks filters. here we analyze deep near-ir number counts ofone of our fields (alh08) for which we have a relatively large area (0.5 squaredegrees) and faint photometry (j=22.4, h=21.3 and k=20.0 at the 50% of recoveryefficiency for point-like sources). we find that the logarithmic gradient ofthe galaxy counts undergoes a distinct change to a flatter slope in each band:from 0.44 at [17.0, 18.5] to 0.34 at [19.5, 22.0] for the j band; for the hband 0.46 at [15.5, 18.0] to 0.36 at [19.0, 21.0], and in ks the change is from0.53 in the range [15.0, 17.0] to 0.33 in the interval [18.0, 20.0]. theseobservations together with faint optical counts are used to constrain modelsthat include density and luminosity evolution of the local type-dependentluminosity functions. our models imply a decline in the space density ofevolved early-type galaxies with increasing redshift, such that only 30% - 50%of the bulk of the present day red-ellipticals was already in place at z~1.

0903.3988	bright strongly lensed galaxies at redshift z~ 6-7 behind the clusters  abell 1703 and cl0024+161	we report on the discovery of three bright, strongly-lensed objects behindabell 1703 and cl0024+16 from a dropout search over 25 square arcminutes ofdeep nicmos data, with deep acs optical coverage. they are undetected in thedeep acs images below 8500 a and have clear detections in the j and h bands.fits to the acs, nicmos and irac data yield robust photometric redshifts in therange z~6-7 and largely rule out the possibility that they are low-redshiftinterlopers. all three objects are extended, and resolved into a pair of brightknots. the bright i-band dropout in abell 1703 has an h-band ab magnitude of23.9, which makes it one of the brightest known galaxy candidates at z&gt;5.5. ourmodel fits suggest a young, massive galaxy only ~ 60 million years old with amass of ~ 1e10 solar mass. the dropout galaxy candidates behind cl0024+16 areseparated by 2.5" (~ 2 kpc in the source plane), and have h-band ab magnitudesof 25.0 and 25.6. lensing models of cl0024+16 suggest that the objects havecomparable intrinsic magnitudes of ab ~ 27.3, approximately one magnitudefainter than l* at z~6.5. their similar redshifts, spectral energydistribution, and luminosities, coupled with their very close proximity on thesky, suggest that they are spatially associated, and plausibly are physicallybound. combining this sample with two previously reported, similarly magnifiedgalaxy candidates at z~6-8, we find that complex systems with dual nuclei maybe a common feature of high-redshift galaxies.

1008.0658	phat: photo-z accuracy testing	here we introduce phat, the photo-z accuracy testing programme, aninternational initiative to test and compare different methods of photo-zestimation. two different test environments are set up, one (phat0) based onsimulations to test the basic functionality of the different photo-z codes, andanother one (phat1) based on data from the goods survey. the accuracy of thedifferent methods is expressed and ranked by the global photo-z bias, scatter,and outlier rates. most methods agree well on phat0 but produce photo-zscatters that can differ by up to a factor of two even in this idealised case.a larger spread in accuracy is found for phat1. few methods benefit from theaddition of mid-ir photometry. remaining biases and systematic effects can beexplained by shortcomings in the different template sets and the use of priorson the one hand and an insufficient training set on the other hand. scatters of4-8% in delta_z/(1+z) were obtained, consistent with other studies. however,somewhat larger outlier rates (&gt;7.5% with delta_z/(1+z)&gt;0.15; &gt;4.5% aftercleaning) are found for all codes. there is a general trend that empiricalcodes produce smaller biases than template-based codes. the systematic,quantitative comparison of different photo-z codes presented here is a snapshotof the current state-of-the-art of photo-z estimation and sets a standard forthe assessment of photo-z accuracy in the future. the rather large outlierrates reported here for phat1 on real data should be investigated further sincethey are most probably also present (and possibly hidden) in many otherstudies. the test data sets are publicly available and can be used to comparenew methods to established ones and help in guiding future photo-z methoddevelopment.

1008.1753	herschel fir counterparts of selected ly-alpha emitters at z~2.2. fast  evolution since z~3 or missed obscured agns?	ly-alpha emitters (laes) are seen everywhere in the redshift domain fromlocal to z~7. far-infrared (fir) counterparts of laes at different epochs couldprovide direct clues on dust content, extinction, and spectral energydistribution (sed) for these galaxies. we search for fir counterparts of laesthat are optically detected in the goods-north field at redshift z~2.2 usingdata from the herschel space telescope with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs). the lae candidates were isolated via color-magnitudediagram using the medium-band photometry from the alhambra survey, ancillarydata on goods-north, and stellar population models. according to the fitting ofthese spectral synthesis models and fir/optical diagnostics, most of them seemto be obscured galaxies whose spectra are agn-dominated. from the analysis ofthe optical data, we have observed a fraction of agn or composite over sourcetotal number of ~0.75 in the lae population at z~2.2, which is marginallyconsistent with the fraction previously observed at z=2.25 and even at lowredshift (0.2&lt;z&lt;0.45), but significantly different from the one observed atredshift ~3, which could be compatible either with a scenario of rapid changein the agn fraction between the epochs involved or with a non detection ofobscured agn in other z=2-3 lae samples due to lack of deep fir observations.we found three robust fir (pacs) counterparts at z~2.2 in goods-north. thisdemonstrates the possibility of finding dust emission in laes even at higherredshifts.

1103.2772	creation of cosmic structure in the complex galaxy cluster merger abell  2744	we present a detailed strong lensing, weak lensing and x-ray analysis ofabell 2744 (z = 0.308), one of the most actively merging galaxy clusters known.it appears to have unleashed `dark', `ghost', `bullet' and `stripped'substructures, each ~10^14 solar masses. the phenomenology is complex and willpresent a challenge for numerical simulations to reproduce. with new, multibandhst imaging, we identify 34 strongly-lensed images of 11 galaxies around themassive southern `core'. combining this with weak lensing data from hst, vltand subaru, we produce the most detailed mass map of this cluster to date. wealso perform an independent analysis of archival chandra x-ray imaging. ouranalyses support a recent claim that the southern core and northwesternsubstructure are post-merger and exhibit morphology similar to the bulletcluster viewed from an angle. from the separation between x-ray emitting gasand lensing mass in the southern core, we derive a new and independentconstraint on the self-interaction cross section of dark matter particlessigma/m &lt;~ 3 \pm 1 cm^2 g^-1. in the northwestern substructure, the gas, darkmatter, and galaxy components have become separated by much larger distances.most curiously, the `ghost' clump (primarily gas) leads the `dark' clump(primarily dark matter) by more than 150 kpc. we propose an enhanced`ram-pressure slingshot' scenario which may have yielded this reversal ofcomponents with such a large separation, but needs further confirmation byfollow-up observations and numerical simulations. a secondary merger involves asecond `bullet' clump in the north and an extremely `stripped' clump to thewest. the latter appears to exhibit the largest separation between dark matterand x-ray emitting baryons detected to date in our sky.

1111.4434	cfhtlens: improving the quality of photometric redshifts with precision  photometry	here we present the results of various approaches to measure accurate coloursand photometric redshifts (photo-z's) from wide-field imaging data. we use datafrom the canada-france-hawaii-telescope legacy survey (cfhtls) which have beenre- processed by the cfht lensing survey (cfhtlens) team in order to carry outa number of weak gravitational lensing studies. an emphasis is put on thecorrection of systematic effects in the photo-z's arising from the differentpoint spread functions (psf) in the five optical bands. different ways ofcorrecting these effects are discussed and the resulting photo-z accuracies arequantified by comparing the photo-z's to large spectroscopic redshift (spec-z)data sets. careful homogenisation of the psf between bands leads to increasedoverall accuracy of photo-z's. the gain is particularly pronounced at faintermagnitudes where galaxies are smaller and flux measurements are affected moreby psf-effects. we also study possible re- calibrations of the photometriczeropoints (zps) with the help of galaxies with known spec-z's. we find that ifpsf-effects are properly taken into account, a re-calibration of the zpsbecomes much less important suggesting that previous such re-calibrationsdescribed in the literature could in fact be mostly corrections for psf-effectsrather than corrections for real inaccuracies in the zps. the implications ofthis finding for future surveys like kids, des, lsst, or euclid are mixed. onthe one hand, zp re-calibrations with spec-z's might not be as accurate aspreviously thought. on the other hand, careful psf homogenisation might providea way out and yield accurate, homogeneous photometry without the need for fullspectroscopic coverage. this is the first paper in a series describing thetechnical aspects of cfhtlens.

1307.5847	evidence for ubiquitous, high-ew nebular emission in z~7 galaxies:  towards a clean measurement of the specific star formation rate using a  sample of bright, magnified galaxies	growing observational evidence now indicates that nebular line emission has asignificant impact on the rest-frame optical fluxes of z~5-7 galaxies observedwith spitzer. this line emission makes z~5-7 galaxies appear more massive, withlower specific star formation rates. however, corrections for this lineemission have been very difficult to perform reliably due to huge uncertaintieson the overall strength of such emission at z&gt;~5.5. here, we present the mostdirect observational evidence yet for ubiquitous high-ew [oiii]+hbeta lineemission in lyman-break galaxies at z~7, while also presenting a strategy foran improved measurement of the ssfr at z~7. we accomplish this through theselection of bright galaxies in the narrow redshift window z~6.6-7.0 where theirac 4.5 micron flux provides a clean measurement of the stellar continuumlight. observed 4.5 micron fluxes in this window contrast with the 3.6 micronfluxes which are contaminated by the prominent [oiii]+hbeta lines. to ensure ahigh s/n for our irac flux measurements, we consider only the brightest(h_{160}&lt;26 mag) magnified galaxies we have identified in clash and otherprograms targeting galaxy clusters. remarkably, the mean rest-frame opticalcolor for our bright seven-source sample is very blue, [3.6]-[4.5]=-0.9+/-0.3.such blue colors cannot be explained by the stellar continuum light and requirethat the rest-frame ew of [oiii]+hbeta be greater than 637 angstroms for theaverage source. the bluest four sources from our seven-source sample require aneven more extreme ew of 1582 angstroms. our derived lower limit for the mean[oiii]+hbeta ew could underestimate the true ew by ~2x based on a simplemodeling of the redshift distribution of our sources. we can also set a robustlower limit of &gt;~4 gyr^-1 on the specific star formation rates based on themean sed for our seven-source sample.

1403.4979	intra cluster light properties in the clash-vlt cluster macs  j1206.2-0847	we aim at constraining the assembly history of clusters by studying the intracluster light (icl) properties, estimating its contribution to the fraction ofbaryons in stars, f*, and understanding possible systematics/bias usingdifferent icl detection techniques. we developed an automated method, galtoicl,based on the software galapagos to obtain a refined version of typical bcg+iclmaps. we applied this method to our test case macs j1206.2-0847, a massivecluster located at z=0.44, that is part of the clash sample. using deepmulti-band subaru images, we extracted the surface brightness (sb) profile ofthe bcg+icl and we studied the icl morphology, color, and contribution to f*out to r500. we repeated the same analysis using a different definition of theicl, sblimit method, i.e. a sb cut-off level, to compare the results. the mostpeculiar feature of the icl in macs1206 is its asymmetric radial distribution,with an excess in the se direction and extending towards the 2nd brightestcluster galaxy which is a post starburst galaxy. this suggests an interactionbetween the bcg and this galaxy that dates back to t &lt;= 1.5 gyr. the bcg+iclstellar content is 8% of m_(*,500) and the (de-) projected baryon fraction instars is f*=0.0177 (0.0116), in excellent agreement with recent results. thesblimit method provides systematically higher icl fractions and this effect islarger at lower sb limits. this is due to the light from the outer envelopes ofmember galaxies that contaminate the icl. though more time consuming, thegaltoicl method provides safer icl detections that are almost free of thiscontamination. this is one of the few icl study at redshift z &gt; 0.3. atcompletion, the clash/vlt program will allow us to extend this analysis to astatistically significant cluster sample spanning a wide redshift range:0.2&lt;z&lt;0.6.

1403.5237	j-pas: the javalambre-physics of the accelerated universe astrophysical  survey	the javalambre-physics of the accelerated universe astrophysical survey(j-pas) is a narrow band, very wide field cosmological survey to be carried outfrom the javalambre observatory in spain with a purpose-built, dedicated 2.5mtelescope and a 4.7 sq.deg. camera with 1.2gpix. starting in late 2015, j-paswill observe 8500sq.deg. of northern sky and measure $0.003(1+z)$ photo-z for$9\times10^7$ lrg and elg galaxies plus several million qsos, sampling aneffective volume of $\sim 14$ gpc$^3$ up to $z=1.3$ and becoming the firstradial bao experiment to reach stage iv. j-pas will detect $7\times 10^5$galaxy clusters and groups, setting constrains on dark energy which rival thoseobtained from its bao measurements. thanks to the superb characteristics of thesite (seeing ~0.7 arcsec), j-pas is expected to obtain a deep, sub-arcsec imageof the northern sky, which combined with its unique photo-z precision willproduce one of the most powerful cosmological lensing surveys before thearrival of euclid. j-pas unprecedented spectral time domain information willenable a self-contained sn survey that, without the need for externalspectroscopic follow-up, will detect, classify and measure $\sigma_z\sim 0.5\%$redshifts for $\sim 4000$ sneia and $\sim 900$ core-collapse sne. the key tothe j-pas potential is its innovative approach: a contiguous system of 54filters with $145\aa$ width, placed $100\aa$ apart over a multi-degree fov is apowerful "redshift machine", with the survey speed of a 4000 multiplexing lowresolution spectrograph, but many times cheaper and much faster to build. thej-pas camera is equivalent to a 4.7 sq.deg. "ifu" and it will produce atime-resolved, 3d image of the northern sky with a very wide range ofastrophysical applications in galaxy evolution, the nearby universe and thestudy of resolved stellar populations.

1404.1384	the music of clash: predictions on the concentration-mass relation	we present the results of a numerical study based on the analysis of themusic-2 simulations, aimed at estimating the expected concentration-massrelation for the clash cluster sample. we study nearly 1400 halos simulated athigh spatial and mass resolution, which were projected along manylines-of-sight each. we study the shape of both their density andsurface-density profiles and fit them with a variety of radial functions,including the navarro-frenk-white, the generalised navarro-frenk-white, and theeinasto density profiles. we derive concentrations and masses from these fitsand investigate their distributions as a function of redshift and halorelaxation. we use the x-ray image simulator x-mas to produce simulated chandraobservations of the halos and we use them to identify objects resembling thex-ray morphologies and masses of the clusters in the clash x-ray selectedsample. we also derive a concentration-mass relation for strong-lensingclusters. we find that the sample of simulated halos which resemble the x-raymorphology of the clash clusters is composed mainly by relaxed halos, but italso contains a significant fraction of un-relaxed systems. for such a samplewe measure an average 2d concentration which is ~11% higher than found for thefull sample of simulated halos. after accounting for projection and selectioneffects, the average nfw concentrations of clash clusters are expected to beintermediate between those predicted in 3d for relaxed and super-relaxed halos.matching the simulations to the individual clash clusters on the basis of thex-ray morphology, we expect that the nfw concentrations recovered from thelensing analysis of the clash clusters are in the range [3-6], with an averagevalue of 3.87 and a standard deviation of 0.61. simulated halos with x-raymorphologies similar to those of the clash clusters are affected by a modestorientation bias.

0803.1199	lensperfect: gravitational lens massmap reconstructions yielding exact  reproduction of all multiple images	we present a new approach to gravitational lens massmap reconstruction. ourmassmap solutions perfectly reproduce the positions, fluxes, and shears of allmultiple images. and each massmap accurately recovers the underlying massdistribution to a resolution limited by the number of multiple images detected.we demonstrate our technique given a mock galaxy cluster similar to abell 1689which gravitationally lenses 19 mock background galaxies to produce 93 multipleimages. we also explore cases in which far fewer multiple images are observed,such as four multiple images of a single galaxy. massmap solutions are neverunique, and our method makes it possible to explore an extremely flexible rangeof physical (and unphysical) solutions, all of which perfectly reproduce thedata given. each reconfiguration of the source galaxies produces a new massmapsolution. an optimization routine is provided to find those source positions(and redshifts, within uncertainties) which produce the "most physical" massmapsolution, according to a new figure of merit developed here. our method imposesno assumptions about the slope of the radial profile nor mass following light.but unlike "non-parametric" grid-based methods, the number of free parameterswe solve for is only as many as the number of observable constraints (orslightly greater if fluxes are constrained). for each set of source positionsand redshifts, massmap solutions are obtained "instantly" via direct matrixinversion by smoothly interpolating the deflection field using a recentlydeveloped mathematical technique. our lensperfect software is straightforwardand easy to use and is made publicly available via our website.

0705.2171	discovery of a ringlike dark matter structure in the core of the galaxy  cluster cl 0024+17	we present a comprehensive mass reconstruction of the rich galaxy cluster cl0024+17 at z~0.4 from acs data, unifying both strong- and weak-lensingconstraints. the weak-lensing signal from a dense distribution of backgroundgalaxies (~120 per square arcmin) across the cluster enables the derivation ofa high-resolution parameter-free mass map. the strongly-lensed objects tightlyconstrain the mass structure of the cluster inner region on an absolute scale,breaking the mass-sheet degeneracy. the mass reconstruction of cl 0024+17obtained in such a way is remarkable. it reveals a ringlike dark mattersubstructure at r~75" surrounding a soft, dense core at r~50". we interpretthis peculiar sub-structure as the result of a high-speed line-of-sightcollision of two massive clusters 1-2 gyr ago. such an event is also indicatedby the cluster velocity distribution. our numerical simulation with purelycollisionless particles demonstrates that such density ripples can arise byradially expanding, decelerating particles that originally comprised thepre-collision cores. cl 0024+17 can be likened to the bullet cluster 1e0657-56,but viewed $along$ the collision axis at a much later epoch. in addition, weshow that the long-standing mass discrepancy for cl 0024+17 between x-ray andlensing can be resolved by treating the cluster x-ray emission as coming from asuperposition of two x-ray systems. the cluster's unusual x-ray surfacebrightness profile that requires a two isothermal sphere description supportsthis hypothesis.

0807.0535	measuring baryon acoustic oscillations along the line of sight with  photometric redshifs: the pau survey	baryon acoustic oscillations (bao) provide a standard ruler of known physicallength, making it a promising probe of the nature of dark energy. the detectionof bao requires measuring galaxy positions and redshifts. "transversal"(angular distance) bao measure the angular size of this scale, while"line-of-sight" (or "radial") bao require precise redshifts, but provide adirect measurement of the hubble parameter at different redshifts, a moresensitive probe of dark energy. the main goal of this paper is to show that aprecision of sigma_z ~0.003(1 + z) is sufficient to measure bao in the radialdirection. this precision can be achieved for bright, red galaxies, by using afilter system comprising about 40 filters, each with a width of ~100 a, from ~4000 a to ~ 8000 a, supplemented by two broad-band filters. we describe apractical implementation, a new galaxy survey, pau, to be carried out with atelescope/camera combination with an etendue of about 20 m^2deg^2, and covering8000 sq. deg. in the sky in four years. we expect to measure positions andredshifts for over 14 million red, early-type galaxies with l &gt; l* and i_ab &lt;22.5 in the interval 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.9, with sigma_z &lt; 0.003(1 + z). thispopulation has a number density n &gt; 10^-3 mpc^-3 h^3 within the 9 (gpc/h)^3volume of the survey, ensuring that the error in the determination of the baoscale is not limited by shot-noise. by itself, such a survey will deliverprecisions of order 5% in the dark-energy equation of state parameter w, ifassumed constant, and can determine its time derivative when combined withfuture cmb measurements. in addition, pau will yield high-quality redshift andlow-resolution spectroscopy for hundreds of millions of other galaxies.

astro-ph;0211371	advanced camera for surveys observations of young star clusters in the  interacting galaxy ugc 10214	we present the first advanced camera for surveys (acs) observations of youngstar clusters in the colliding/merging galaxy ugc 10214. the observations weremade as part of the early release observation (ero) program for the newlyinstalled acs during service mission sm3b for the hubble space telescope (hst).many young star clusters can be identified in the tails of ugc 10214, with agesranging from ~3 myr to 10 myr. the extreme blue v-i (f606w-f814w) colors of thestar clusters found in the tail of ugc 10214 can only be explained if strongemission lines are included with a young stellar population. this has beenconfirmed by our keck spectroscopy of some of these bright blue stellar knots.the most luminous and largest of these blue knots has an absolute magnitude ofm_v = -14.45, with a half-light radius of 161 pc, and if it is a single starcluster, would qualify as a super star cluster (ssc). alternatively, it couldbe a superposition of multiple scaled ob associations or clusters. with anestimated age of ~ 4-5 myr, its derived mass is &lt; 1.3 x 10^6 solar masses. thusthe young stellar knot is unbound and will not evolve into a normal globularcluster. the bright blue clusters and associations are much younger than thedynamical age of the tail, providing strong evidence that star formation occursin the tail long after it was ejected. ugc 10214 provides a nearby example ofprocesses that contributed to the formation of halos and intra-cluster media inthe distant and younger universe.

astro-ph;0306215	star formation at z~6: i-dropouts in the acs gto fields	using an i-z dropout criterion, we determine the space density of z~6galaxies from two deep acs gto fields with deep optical-ir imaging. a total of23 objects are found over 46 arcmin^2, or ~0.5 objects/arcmin^2 down to z~27.3(6 sigma; all ab mag) (including one probable z~6 agn). combining deep isaacdata for our rdcs1252-2927 field (j~25.7 and ks~25.0 (5 sigma)) and nicmos datafor the hdf north (jh~27.3 (5 sigma)), we verify that these dropouts have flatspectral slopes. i-dropouts in our sample range in luminosity from ~1.5 l*(z~25.6) to ~0.3 l* (z~27.3) with the exception of one very bright candidate atz~24.2. the half-light radii vary from 0.09" to 0.29", or 0.5 kpc to 1.7 kpc.we derive the z~6 rest-frame uv luminosity density using three differentprocedures, each utilizing simulations based on a cdf south v dropout sample.first, we compare our findings with a no-evolution projection of this v-dropoutsample. we find 23+/-25% more i-dropouts than we predict. adopting previousresults to z~5, this works out to a 20+/-29% drop in the luminosity densityfrom z~3 to z~6. second, we use these same v-dropout simulations to derive aselection function for our i-dropout sample and compute the uv-luminositydensity (7.2+/-2.5 x 10^25 ergs/s/hz/mpc^3 down to z~27). we find a 39+/-21%drop over the same redshift range. this is our preferred value and suggests astar formation rate of 0.0090+/-0.0031 m_sol/yr/mpc^3 to z~27, or ~0.036+/-0.012 m_sol/yr/mpc^3 extrapolating the lf to the faint limit. third, we followa very similar procedure, but assume no incompleteness, finding a luminositydensity which is ~2-3x lower. this final estimate constitutes a lower limit.all three estimates are within the canonical range of luminosity densitiesnecessary for reionization of the universe at this epoch.

astro-ph;0411386	a vlt spectroscopic survey of rx j0152.7-1357, a forming cluster of  galaxies at z=0.837	we present the results of an extensive spectroscopic survey of rxj0152.7-1357, one of the most massive distant clusters of galaxies known.multi-object spectroscopy, carried out with fors1 and fors2 on the eso verylarge telescope (vlt), has allowed us to measure more than 200 redshifts in thecluster field and to confirm 102 galaxies as cluster members. the mean redshiftof the cluster is $z=0.837 \pm 0.001$ and we estimate the velocity dispersionof the overall cluster galaxy distribution to be $\sim 1600 \mathrm{km \s^{-1}}$. the distribution of cluster members is clearly irregular, with twomain clumps that follow the x-ray cluster emission mapped by chandra. a thirdclump of galaxies to the east of the central structure and at the clusterredshift has also been identified. the two main clumps have velocitydispersions of $\sim919$ and $\sim737 \mathrm{km s^{-1}}$ respectively, and thepeculiar velocity of the two clumps suggests that they will merge into a singlemore massive cluster. a segregation in the star formation activity of themember galaxies is observed. all star forming galaxies are located outside thehigh-density peaks, which are populated only by passive galaxies. a populationof red galaxies (belonging to the cluster red sequence) with clearpost-starburst spectral features and [oii] ($\lambda$3727) emission lines isobserved in the outskirts of the cluster. two agns, which were previouslyconfused with the diffuse x-ray emission from the intracluster medium in rosatand bepposax observations, are found to be cluster members.

astro-ph;0411516	the luminosity functions of the galaxy cluster ms1054-0321 at z=0.83  based on acs photometry	we present new measurements of the galaxy luminosity function (lf) and itsdependence on local galaxy density, color, morphology, and clustocentric radiusfor the massive z=0.83 cluster ms1054-0321. our analyses are based on imagingperformed with the acs onboard the hst in the f606w, f775w and f850lp passbandsand extensive spectroscopic data obtained with the keck lris. our main resultsare based on a spectroscopically selected sample of 143 cluster members withmorphological classifications derived from the acs observations. our threeprimary findings are (1) the faint-end slope of the lf is steepest in thebluest filter, (2) the lf in the inner part of the cluster (or highest densityregions) has a flatter faint-end slope, and (3) the fraction of early-typegalaxies is higher at the bright end of the lf, and gradually decreases towardfainter magnitudes. these characteristics are consistent with those in localgalaxy clusters, indicating that, at least in massive clusters, the commoncharacteristics of cluster lfs are established at z=0.83. we also find a 2sigmadeficit of intrinsically faint, red galaxies (i-z&gt;0.5, mi&gt;-19) in this cluster.this trend may suggest that faint, red galaxies (which are common in z&lt;0.1 richclusters) have not yet been created in this cluster at z=0.83. thegiant-to-dwarf ratio in ms1054-0321 starts to increase inwards of the virialradius or when sigma&gt;30 mpc^-2, coinciding with the environment where thegalaxy star formation rate and the morphology-density relation start to appear.(abridged)

astro-ph;0412191	non-parametric mass reconstruction of a1689 from strong lensing data  with slap	we present the mass distribution in the central area of the cluster a1689 byfitting over 100 multiply lensed images with the non-parametric strong lensinganalysis package (slap, diego et al. 2004). the surface mass distribution isobtained in a robust way finding a total mass of 0.25e15 m_sun/h within a 70''circle radius from the central peak. our reconstructed density profile fitswell an nfw profile with small perturbations due to substructure and iscompatible with the more model dependent analysis of broadhurst et al. (2004a)based on the same data. our estimated mass does not rely on any priorinformation about the distribution of dark matter in the cluster. the peak ofthe mass distribution falls very close to the central cd and there issubstructure near the center suggesting that the cluster is not fully relaxed.we also examine the effect on the recovered mass when we include theuncertainties in the redshift of the sources and in the original shape of thesources. using simulations designed to mimic the data, we identify some biasesin our reconstructed mass distribution. we find that the recovered mass isbiased toward lower masses beyond 1 arcmin (150 kpc) from the central cd andthat in the very center we may be affected by degeneracy problems. on the otherhand, we confirm that the reconstructed mass between 25'' and 70'' is a robust,unbiased estimate of the true mass distribution and is compatible with an nfwprofile.

astro-ph;0412263	discovery of two m32 twins in abell 1689	the m31 satellite galaxy m32 has long been considered an object of uniqueproperties, being the most extreme example of the very rare compact ellipticalgalaxy class. here we present the spectroscopic discovery of two m32 twins inthe massive galaxy cluster abell 1689. as these objects are so rare, this is animportant step towards a better understanding of the nature of compactgalaxies. the two m32 twins had first been detected within our photometricsearch for ultra compact dwarf galaxy (ucds) candidates in a1689 (mieske et al.2004) with the advanced camera for surveys (acs). their luminosities (m_v ~ -17mag) are very similar to m32 and their surface brightness profiles areconsistent with that of m32 projected to a1689's distance. from our acs imagingwe detect several fainter compact galaxy candidates with luminositiesintermediate between m32 and the fornax ucds. if spectroscopically confirmed ascluster members, this would almost close the gap in the magnitude-surfacebrightness plane between the region of ucds and the compact ellipticals,implying a sequence of faint compact galaxies well separated from that of dwarfellipticals.

astro-ph;0501224	the morphology - density relation in z ~ 1 clusters	we measure the morphology--density relation (mdr) and morphology-radiusrelation (mrr) for galaxies in seven z ~ 1 clusters that have been observedwith the advanced camera for surveys on board the hubble space telescope.simulations and independent comparisons of ourvisually derived morphologiesindicate that acs allows one to distinguish between e, s0, and spiralmorphologies down to zmag = 24, corresponding to l/l* = 0.21 and 0.30 at z =0.83 and z = 1.24, respectively. we adopt density and radius estimation methodsthat match those used at lower redshift in order to study the evolution of themdr and mrr. we detect a change in the mdr between 0.8 &lt; z &lt; 1.2 and thatobserved at z ~ 0, consistent with recent work -- specifically, the growth inthe bulge-dominated galaxy fraction, f_e+so, with increasing density proceedsless rapidly at z ~ 1 than it does at z ~ 0. at z ~ 1 and density &lt;= 500galaxies/mpc^2, we find &lt;f_e+s0&gt; = 0.72 +/- 0.10. at z ~ 0, an e+s0 populationfraction of this magnitude occurs at densities about 5 times smaller. theevolution in the mdr is confined to densities &gt;= 40 galaxies/mpc^2 and appearsto be primarily due to a deficit of s0 galaxies and an excess of spiral+irrgalaxies relative to the local galaxy population. the elliptical fraction -density relation exhibits no significant evolution between z = 1 and z = 0. wefind mild evidence to suggest that the mdr is dependent on the bolometric x-rayluminosity of the intracluster medium. implications for the evolution of thedisk galaxy population in dense regions are discussed in the context of theseobservations.

astro-ph;0503445	a dynamical simulation of the debris disk around hd 141569a	we study the dynamical origin of the structures observed in thescattered-light images of the resolved debris disk around hd 141569a. weexplore the roles of radiation pressure from the central star, gas drag fromthe gas disk, and the tidal forces from two nearby stars in creating andmaintaining these structures. we use a simple one-dimensional axisymmetricmodel to show that the presence of the gas helps confine the dust and that abroad ring of dust is produced if a central hole exists in the disk. this modelalso suggests that the disk is in a transient, excited dynamical state, as theobserved dust creation rate applied over the age of the star is inconsistentwith submillimeter mass measurements. we model in two dimensions the effects ofa fly-by encounter between the disk and a binary star in a prograde, parabolic,coplanar orbit. we track the spatial distribution of the disk's gas,planetesimals, and dust. we conclude that the surface density distributionreflects the planetesimal distribution for a wide range of parameters. our mostviable model features a disk of initial radius 400 au, a gas mass of 50m_earth, and beta = 4 and suggests that the system is being observed within4000 yr of the fly-by periastron. the model reproduces some features of hd141569a's disk, such as a broad single ring and large spiral arms, but it doesnot reproduce the observed multiple spiral rings or disk asymmetries nor theobserved clearing in the inner disk. for the latter, we consider the effect ofa 5 m_jup planet in an eccentric orbit on the planetesimal distribution of hd141569a.

astro-ph;0507614	the photometric performance and calibration of the hst advanced camera  for surveys	we present the photometric calibration of the hst advanced camera for surveys(acs). we give here an overview of the performance and calibration of the 2 ccdcameras, the wide field channel (wfc) and the high resolution channel (hrc),and a description of the best techniques for reducing acs ccd data.  on-orbit observations of spectrophotometric standard stars have been used torevise the pre-launch estimate of the instrument response curves to best matchpredicted and observed count rates. synthetic photometry has been used todetermine zeropoints for all filters in 3 magnitude systems and to deriveinterstellar extinction values for the acs photometric systems.  due to the ccd internal scattering of long wavelength photons, the width ofthe psf increases significantly in the near-ir and the aperture correction forphotometry with near-ir filters depends on the spectral energy distribution ofthe source. we provide encircled energy curves and a detailed recipe to correctfor the latter effect.  transformations between the acs photometric systems and the ubvri and wfpc2systems are presented. in general, two sets of transformations are available: 1based on the observation of 2 star clusters; the other on synthetic photometry.we discuss the accuracy of these transformations and their sensitivity todetails of the spectra being transformed.  initial signs of detector degradation due to the hst radiative environmentare already visible. we discuss the impact on the data in terms of dark rateincrease, charge transfer inefficiency, and hot pixel population.

astro-ph;0509308	clustering of star-forming galaxies near a radio galaxy at z=5.2	we present hst/acs observations of the most distant radio galaxy known, tnj0924-2201 at z=5.2. this radio galaxy has 6 spectroscopically confirmed lyaemitting companion galaxies, and appears to lie within an overdense region. theradio galaxy is marginally resolved in i_775 and z_850 showing continuumemission aligned with the radio axis, similar to what is observed for lowerredshift radio galaxies. both the half-light radius and the uv star formationrate are comparable to the typical values found for lyman break galaxies atz~4-5. the lya emitters are sub-l* galaxies, with deduced star formation ratesof 1-10 msun/yr. one of the lya emitters is only detected in lya. based on thestar formation rate of ~3 msun/yr calculated from lya, the lack of continuumemission could be explained if the galaxy is younger than ~2 myr and isproducing its first stars.  observations in v_606, i_775, and z_850 were used to identify additionallyman break galaxies associated with this structure. in addition to the radiogalaxy, there are 22 v-break (z~5) galaxies with z_850&lt;26.5 (5sigma), two ofwhich are also in the spectroscopic sample. we compare the surface density of2/arcmin^2 to that of similarly selected v-dropouts extracted from goods andthe udf parallel fields. we find evidence for an overdensity to very highconfidence (&gt;99%), based on a counts-in-cells analysis applied to the controlfield. the excess is suggestive of the v-break objects being associated with aforming cluster around the radio galaxy.

astro-ph;9801158	gravitational lens magnification and the mass of abell 1689	we present the first application of lens magnification to measure theabsolute mass of a galaxy cluster; abell 1689. the absolute mass of a galaxycluster can be measured by the gravitational lens magnification of a backgroundgalaxy population by the cluster potential. the lensing signal is complicatedby the variation in number counts due to galaxy clustering and shot-noise, andby additional uncertainties in relating magnification to mass in the stronglensing regime. clustering and shot-noise can be dealt with using maximumlikelihood methods. local approximations can then be used to estimate the massfrom magnification. alternatively if the lens is axially symmetric we show thatthe amplification equation can be solved nonlocally for the surface massdensity and the tangential shear. in this paper we present the first maps ofthe total mass distribution in abell 1689, measured from the deficit of lensedred galaxies behind the cluster. although noisier, these reproduce the mainfeatures of mass maps made using the shear distortion of background galaxiesbut have the correct normalisation, finally breaking the ``sheet-mass''degeneracy that has plagued lensing methods based on shear. we derive thecluster mass profile in the inner 4' (0.48 mpc/h). these show a profile with anear isothermal surface mass density \kappa = (0.5+/-0.1)(\theta/1')^{-1} outto a radius of 2.4' (0.28mpc/h), followed by a sudden drop into noise. we findthat the projected mass interior to 0.24 h^{-1}$mpc is m(&lt;0.24 mpc/h)=(0.50+/-0.09) \times 10^{15} msol/h. we compare our results with masses estimated fromx-ray temperatures and line-of-sight velocity dispersions, as well as weakshear and lensing arclets and find all are in fair agreement for abell 1698.

0812.3568	optimal filter systems for photometric redshift estimation	in the next years, several cosmological surveys will rely on imaging data toestimate the redshift of galaxies, using traditional filter systems with 4-5optical broad bands; narrower filters improve the spectral resolution, butstrongly reduce the total system throughput. we explore how photometricredshift performance depends on the number of filters n_f, characterizing thesurvey depth through the fraction of galaxies with unambiguous redshiftestimates. for a combination of total exposure time and telescope imaging areaof 270 hrs m^2, 4-5 filter systems perform significantly worse, both incompleteness depth and precision, than systems with n_f &gt;= 8 filters. ourresults suggest that for low n_f, the color-redshift degeneracies overwhelm theimprovements in photometric depth, and that even at higher n_f, the effectivephotometric redshift depth decreases much more slowly with filter width thannaively expected from the reduction in s/n. adding near-ir observationsimproves the performance of low n_f systems, but still the system whichmaximizes the photometric redshift completeness is formed by 9 filters withlogarithmically increasing bandwidth (constant resolution) and half-bandoverlap, reaching ~0.7 mag deeper, with 10% better redshift precision, than 4-5filter systems. a system with 20 constant-width, non-overlapping filtersreaches only ~0.1 mag shallower than 4-5 filter systems, but has a precisionalmost 3 times better, dz = 0.014(1+z) vs. dz = 0.042(1+z). we briefly discussa practical implementation of such a photometric system: the alhambra survey.
