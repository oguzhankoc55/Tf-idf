0908.1317	low-mass members of the young cluster ic 4665 and pre-main-sequence  lithium depletion	we have used fibre spectroscopy to establish cluster membership and examinepre-main-sequence (pms) lithium depletion for low-mass stars (spectral types fto m) in the sparse young (~30 myr) cluster ic 4665. we present a filteredcandidate list of 40 stars that should contain 75 per cent of single clustermembers with v of 11.5 to 18 in the central square degree of the cluster.whilst f- and g-type stars in ic 4665 have depleted little or no lithium, thek- and early m-type stars have depleted more li than expected when comparedwith similar stars in other clusters of known age. an empirical age estimatebased on li-depletion among the late-type stars of ic 4665 would suggest it isolder than 100 myr. this disagrees entirely with ages determined either fromthe nuclear turn-off, from isochronal matches to low-mass stars or from there-appearance of lithium previously found in much lower mass stars (the``lithium depletion boundary''). we suggest that other parameters besides age,perhaps composition or rotation, are very influential in determining the degreeof pms li-depletion in stars with m greater than 0.5 msun. further work isrequired to identify and assess the effects of these additional parameters,particularly to probe conditions at the interface between the sub-photosphericconvection zone and developing radiative core. until then, pms li depletion inf- to early m-type stars cannot be confidently used as a precise age indicatorin young clusters, kinematic groups or individual field stars.

0911.1075	are the spin axes of stars randomly aligned within a cluster?	we investigate to what extent the spin axes of stars in young open clustersare aligned. assuming that the spin vectors lie uniformly within a conicalsection, with an opening half-angle between lambda=0 (perfectly aligned) andlambda=90 degrees(completely random), we describe a monte-carlo modellingtechnique that returns a probability density for this opening angle given a setof measured sin i values, where i is the unknown inclination angle between astellar spin vector and the line of sight. using simulations we demonstratethat although azimuthal information is lost, it is easily possible todiscriminate between strongly aligned spin axes and a random distribution,providing that the mean spin-axis inclination lies outside the range 45--75degrees. we apply the technique to g- and k-type stars in the young pleiadesand alpha per clusters. the sin i values are derived using rotation periods andprojected equatorial velocities, combined with radii estimated from the clusterdistances and a surface brightness/colour relationship. for both clusters wefind no evidence for spin-axis alignment: lambda=90 degrees is the mostprobable model and lambda&gt;40 degrees with 90 per cent confidence. assuming arandom spin-axis alignment, we re-determine the distances to both clusters,obtaining 133+/-7pc for the pleiades and 182+/-11 pc for alpha per. if theassumption of random spin-axis alignment is discarded however, whilst thedistance estimate remains unchanged, it has an additional +18/-32 percentuncertainty.

0911.3588	rotation of young stars in cepheus ob3b	we present a photometric study of i-band variability in the young associationcepheus ob3b. the study is sensitive to periodic variability on timescales ofless than a day, to more than 20 days. after rejection of contaminating objectsusing v, i, r and narrowband h-alpha photometry, we find 475 objects withmeasured rotation periods, which are very likely pre-main-sequence members ofthe cep ob3b star forming region.  we revise the distance and age to cep ob3b, putting it on the self-consistentage and distance ladder of mayne &amp; naylor (2008). this yields a distancemodulus of 8.8 +/- 0.2 mags, corresponding to a distance of 580 +/- 60 pc, andan age of 4-5myrs.  the rotation period distribution confirms the general picture of rotationalevolution in young stars, exhibiting both the correlation between accretion(determined in this case through narrowband h-alpha photometry) and rotationexpected from disc locking, and the dependence of rotation upon mass that isseen in other star forming regions. however, this mass dependence is muchweaker in our data than found in other studies. comparison to the similarlyaged ngc 2362 shows that the low-mass stars in cep ob3b are rotating much moreslowly. this points to a possible link between star forming environment androtation properties. such a link would call into question models of stellarangular momentum evolution, which assume that the rotational perioddistributions of young clusters and associations can be assembled into anevolutionary sequence, thus ignoring environmental effects.

1004.4557	chromospheric activity among fast rotating m-dwarfs in the open cluster  ngc 2516	we report radial velocities (rvs), projected equatorial velocities (v sin i)and caii triplet (cat) chromospheric activity indices for 237 late-k to mid-mcandidate members of the young open cluster ngc 2516. these stars have rotationperiods between 0.1 and 15 days. intermediate resolution spectra were obtainedusing the giraffe spectrograph at the very large telescope. membership wasconfirmed on the basis of rvs for 210 targets. we see a marked increase in thefraction of rapidly rotators as we move to cooler spectral types. about 20 percent of m0-m1 stars have v sin i &gt;15km/s, increasing to 90 per cent of m4stars. activity indices derived from the first two lines of the cat (8498a and8542a) show differing dependencies on rotation period and mass for stars lyingabove and below the fully convective boundary. higher mass stars, of spectraltype k3-m2.5, show chromospheric activity which increases with decreasingrossby number (the ratio of period to convective turnover time), saturating forrossby numbers &lt;0.1. for cooler stars, which are probably fully convective andalmost all of which have rossby numbers &lt;0.1, there is a clear decrease inchromospheric activity as (v-i)_0 increases, amounting to a fall of about afactor of 2-3 between spectral types m2.5 and m4. this decrease in activitylevels at low rossby numbers is not seen in x-ray observations of the coronaeof cluster m-dwarfs or of active field m-dwarfs. there is no evidence forsupersaturation of chromospheric activity for stars of any spectral type atrossby numbers &lt;0.01. we suggest that the fall in the limiting level ofchromospheric emission beyond spectral type m3 in ngc~2516 is, like thesimultaneous increase in rotation rates in field stars, associated with achange in the global magnetic topology as stars approach the fully convectiveboundary and not due to any decrease in dynamo-generated magnetic flux.

1010.2152	investigating coronal saturation and super-saturation in fast-rotating  m-dwarf stars	at fast rotation rates the coronal activity of g- and k-type stars has beenobserved to "saturate" and then decline again at even faster rotation rates --a phenomenon dubbed "super-saturation". in this paper we investigate coronalactivity in fast-rotating m-dwarfs using deep xmm-newton observations of 97low-mass stars of known rotation period in the young open cluster ngc 2547, andcombine these with published x-ray surveys of low-mass field and cluster starsof known rotation period. like g- and k-dwarfs, we find that m-dwarfs exhibitincreasing coronal activity with decreasing rossby number n_r, the ratio ofperiod to convective turnover time, and that activity saturates at l_x/l_bol ~10^-3 for log n_r &lt; -0.8. however, super-saturation is not convincinglydisplayed by m-dwarfs, despite the presence of many objects in our sample withlog n_r &lt; -1.8, where super-saturation is observed to occur in higher massstars. instead, it appears that a short rotation period is the primarypredictor of super-saturation; p &lt;=0.3d for k-dwarfs and perhaps p &lt;=0.2d form-dwarfs. these observations favour the "centrifugal stripping" model forsuper-saturation, where coronal structures are forced open or becomeradiatively unstable as the keplerian co-rotation radius moves inside the x-rayemitting coronal volume.

1010.6100	identification of the lithium depletion boundary and age of the southern  open cluster blanco 1	we present results from a spectroscopic study of the very low mass members ofthe southern open cluster blanco 1 using the gemini-n telescope. we obtainedintermediate resolution (r~4400) gmos spectra for 15 cluster candidate memberswith i~14-20 mag, and employed a series of membership criteria - proximity tothe cluster's sequence in an i/i-ks color-magnitude diagram (cmd), kinematicsagreeing with the cluster systemic motion, magnetic activity as a youthindicator - to classify 10 of these objects as probable cluster members. forthese objects, we searched for the presence of the li i 6708 a feature toidentify the lithium depletion boundary (ldb) in blanco 1. the i/i-ks cmd showsa clear mass segregation in the li distribution along the cluster sequence;namely, all higher mass stars are found to be li-poor, while lower mass starsare found to be li-rich. the division between li-poor and li-rich (i.e., theldb) in blanco 1 is found at i=$18.78 \pm 0.24$ and i-ks=$3.05 \pm 0.10$. usingcurrent pre-main-sequence evolutionary models we determine an ldb age of $132\pm 24$ myr. comparing our derived ldb age to upper-main-sequence isochroneages for blanco 1, as well as for other open clusters with identified ldbs, wefind good chronometric consistency when using stellar evolution models thatincorporate a moderate degree of convective core overshoot.

1102.3836	accretion-induced luminosity spreads in young clusters: evidence from  stellar rotation	we present an analysis of the rotation of young stars in the associationscepheus ob3b, ngc 2264, ngc 2362 and the orion nebula cluster (onc). wediscover a correlation between rotation rate and position in a colour-magnitudediagram (cmd) such that stars which lie above an empirically determined medianpre-main sequence rotate more rapidly than stars which lie below this sequence.the same correlation is seen, with a high degree of statistical significance,in each association studied here. if position within the cmd is interpreted asbeing due to genuine age spreads within a cluster, then the stars above themedian pre-main sequence would be the youngest stars. this would in turn implythat the most rapidly rotating stars in an association are the youngest, andhence those with the largest moments of inertia and highest likelihood ofongoing accretion. such a result does not fit naturally into the existingpicture of angular momentum evolution in young stars, where the stars arebraked effectively by their accretion discs until the disc disperses.  instead, we argue that, for a given association of young stars, positionwithin the cmd is not primarily a function of age, but of accretion history. weshow that this hypothesis could explain the correlation we observe betweenrotation rate and position within the cmd.

1108.2052	no wide spread of stellar ages in the orion nebula cluster	the wide luminosity dispersion seen for stars at a given effectivetemperature in the h-r diagrams of young clusters and star forming regions isoften interpreted as due to significant (~10 myr) spreads in stellarcontraction age. in the scenario where most stars are born with circumstellardiscs, and that disc signatures decay monotonically (on average) overtimescales of only a few myr, then any such age spread should lead to cleardifferences in the age distributions of stars with and without discs. we haveinvestigated large samples of stars in the orion nebula cluster (onc) usingthree methods to diagnose disc presence from infrared measurements. we find nosignificant difference in the mean ages or age distributions of stars with andwithout discs, consistent with expectations for a coeval population. using asimple quantitative model we show that any real age spread must be smaller thanthe median disc lifetime. for a log-normal age distribution, there is an upperlimit of &lt;0.14 dex (at 99% confidence) to any real age dispersion, compared tothe ~=0.4 dex implied by the h-r diagram. if the mean age of the onc is 2.5myr, this would mean at least 95% of its low-mass stellar population has agesbetween 1.3--4.8 myr. we suggest that the observed luminosity dispersion iscaused by a combination of observational uncertainties and physical mechanismsthat disorder the conventional relationship between luminosity and age for premain-sequence stars. this means that individual stellar ages from the h-rdiagram are unreliable and cannot be used to directly infer a star formationhistory. irrespective of what causes the wide luminosity dispersion, thefinding that any real age dispersion is less than the median disc lifetimeargues strongly against star formation scenarios for the onc lasting longerthan a few myr.

1110.4219	dust discs around intermediate mass and sun-like stars in the 16 myr old  ngc 1960 open cluster	we present an analysis of spitzer irac (3.6--8um) and mips (24um) imaging ofmembers of the 16(+10/-5)myr old open cluster ngc 1960 (m36). models ofterrestrial planet formation indicate that rocky planets are likely to achievetheir final masses at around 10-30myr, and thus this cluster is at aninteresting epoch for planet formation. we find 21 b-f5 type stars and 14 f6-k9type stars which have 24um excess emission, and thus determine that &gt;30% ofb-f5 type stars and &gt;23% of f6-k9 type stars in this cluster have 24um excessemission. these excess frequencies are similar to those observed in otherclusters of similar age. three early type stars have excesses at near-infraredwavelengths. analysis of their seds confirms that these are true debris discsand not remnant primordial or transitional discs. none of the 61 sun-like starshave confirmed near-infrared excess, and we can place a limit on the frequencyof 8um excess emission around sun-like stars of &lt;7%. all of the detectedexcesses are consistent with emission from debris discs and are not primordial.

1203.5089	spitzer imaging of the nearby rich young cluster, cep ob3b	we map the full extent of a rich massive young cluster in the cep ob3bassociation with the irac and mips instruments aboard the {\it spitzer} spacetelescope and the acis instrument aboard the $\it{chandra}$ x-ray observatory.at 700 pc, it is revealed to be the second nearest large ($&gt;1000$ member),young ($&lt; 5$ myr) cluster known. in contrast to the nearest large cluster, theorion nebula cluster, cep ob3b is only lightly obscured and is mostly locatedin a large cavity carved out of the surrounding molecular cloud. our infraredand x-ray datasets, as well as visible photometry from the literature, are usedto take a census of the young stars in cep ob3b. we find that the young starswithin the cluster are concentrated in two sub-clusters; an easternsub-cluster, near the cep b molecular clump, and a western sub-cluster, nearthe cep f molecular clump. using our census of young stars, we examine thefraction of young stars with infrared excesses indicative of circumstellardisks. we create a map of the disk fraction throughout the cluster and findthat it is spatially variable. due to these spatial variations, the twosub-clusters exhibit substantially different average disk fractions from eachother: $32% \pm 4%$ and $50% \pm 6%$. we discuss whether the discrepant diskfractions are due to the photodestruction of disks by the high mass members ofthe cluster or whether they result from differences in the ages of thesub-clusters. we conclude that the discrepant disk fractions are most likelydue to differences in the ages.

1204.4066	why do some young cool stars show spot modulation while others do not?	we present far-red, intermediate resolution spectroscopy of 572photometrically selected, low-mass stars (0.2&lt;m/m_sun&lt;0.7) in the young opencluster ngc 2516, using the flames spectrograph at the very large telescope.precise radial velocities confirm membership for 210 stars that have publishedrotation periods from spot-modulated light curves and for another 144 stars inwhich periodic modulation could not be found. the two sub-samples are comparedand no significant differences are found between their positions incolour-magnitude diagrams, the distribution of their projected equatorialvelocities or their levels of chromospheric activity. we rule out differingobservational sensitivity as an explanation and conclude that otherwise similarobjects, with equally high levels of chromospheric activity, do not exhibitspot-induced light curve modulation because their significant spot coverage ishighly axisymmetric. we propose that the spot coverage consists of largenumbers of small, dark spots with diameters of about 2 degrees. this explainswhy about half of cluster members do not exhibit rotationally modulated lightcurves and why the light curve amplitudes of those that do have mean values ofonly 0.01-0.02 mag.

1206.2361	pre-main-sequence isochrones -- i. the pleiades benchmark	we present a critical assessment of commonly used pre-main-sequenceisochrones by comparing their predictions to a set of well-calibratedcolour-magnitude diagrams of the pleiades in the wavelength range 0.4 to 2.5microns. our analysis shows that for temperatures less than 4000 k the modelssystematically overestimate the flux by a factor two at 0.5 microns, thoughthis decreases with wavelength, becoming negligible at 2.2 microns. in opticalcolours this will result in the ages for stars younger than 10 myr beingunderestimated by factors between two and three.  we show that using observations of standard stars to transform the data intoa standard system can introduce significant errors in the positioning ofpre-main-sequences in colour-magnitude diagrams. therefore we have compared themodels to the data in the natural photometric system in which the observationswere taken. thus we have constructed and tested a model of the system responsesfor the wide-field camera on the isaac newton telescope.  as a benchmark test for the development of pre-main-sequence models weprovide both our system responses and the pleiades sequence.

1302.4202	on the relationship between the size and surface coverage of starspots  on magnetically active low-mass stars	we present a model that predicts the light curve amplitude distribution foran ensemble of low-mass magnetically active stars, under the assumptions thatstellar spin axes are randomly orientated and that cool starspots have acharacteristic scale length and are randomly distributed across the stellarsurfaces. the model is compared with observational data for highly magneticallyactive m-dwarfs in the young cluster ngc 2516. we find that the best fittingstarspot scale length is not constrained by these data alone, but requiresassumptions about the overall starspot filling factor and starspot temperature.assuming a spot coverage fraction of 0.4+/-0.1 and a starspot to unspottedphotosphere temperature ratio of 0.7+/-0.05, as suggested by the inflated radiiof these stars compared to evolutionary model predictions and by tio bandmeasurements on other active cool stars of earlier spectral type, thebest-fitting starspot angular scale length is 3.5(+2)(-1) degrees, or a linearscale length of \sim 25000 km. this linear scale length is similar to largesunspot groups, but 2--5 times smaller than the starspots recently deduced onan active g-dwarf using eclipse mapping by a transiting exoplanet. however, thebest-fitting spot scale length in the ngc 2516 m-dwarfs increases with theassumed spot temperature ratio and with the inverse square root of the assumedspot filling factor. hence the light curve amplitude distribution might equallywell be described by these larger spot scale lengths if the spot fillingfactors are &lt;0.1 or the spot temperature ratio is &gt;0.9.

1306.2282	no evidence for intense, cold accretion onto ysos from measurements of  li in t-tauri stars	we have used medium resolution spectra to search for evidence thatproto-stellar objects accrete at high rates during their early 'assemblyphase'. models predict that depleted lithium and reduced luminosity in t-tauristars are key signatures of 'cold' high-rate accretion occurring early in astar's evolution.  we found no evidence in 168 stars in ngc 2264 and the orion nebula clusterfor strong lithium depletion through analysis of veiling corrected 6708angstrom lithium spectral line strengths. this suggests that 'cold' accretionat high rates (m_dot &gt; 5 x 10-4 m_sol yr-1) occurs in the assembly phase offewer than 0.5 per cent of 0.3 &lt; m &lt; 1.9 m_sol stars.  we also find that the dispersion in the strength of the 6708 angstrom lithiumline might imply an age spread that is similar in magnitude to the apparent agespread implied by the luminosity dispersion seen in colour magnitude diagrams.evidence for weak lithium depletion (&lt; 10 per cent in equivalent width) that iscorrelated with luminosity is also apparent, but we are unable to determinewhether age spreads or accretion at rates less than 5 x 10-4 m_sol yr-1 areresponsible.

1306.3237	pre-main-sequence isochrones -- ii. revising star and planet formation  timescales	we have derived ages for 13 young (&lt;30 myr) star-forming regions and findthey are up to a factor two older than the ages typically adopted in theliterature. this result has wide-ranging implications, including thatcircumstellar discs survive longer (~10-12 myr) and that the average class ilifetime is greater (~1 myr) than currently believed.  for each star-forming region we derived two ages from colour-magnitudediagrams. first we fitted models of the evolution between the zero-agemain-sequence and terminal-age main-sequence to derive a homogeneous set ofmain-sequence ages, distances and reddenings with statistically meaningfuluncertainties. our second age for each star-forming region was derived byfitting pre-main-sequence stars to new semi-empirical model isochrones. for thefirst time (for a set of clusters younger than 50 myr) we find broad agreementbetween these two ages, and since these are derived from two distinct massregimes that rely on different aspects of stellar physics, it gives usconfidence in the new age scale. this agreement is largely due to our adoptionof empirical colour-teff relations and bolometric corrections forpre-main-sequence stars cooler than 4000 k.  the revised ages for the star-forming regions in our sample are: ~2 myr forngc 6611 (eagle nebula; m 16), ic 5146 (cocoon nebula), ngc 6530 (lagoonnebula; m 8), and ngc 2244 (rosette nebula); ~6 myr for {\sigma} ori, cep ob3b,and ic 348; ~10 myr for {\lambda} ori (collinder 69); ~11 myr for ngc 2169; ~12myr for ngc 2362; ~13 myr for ngc 7160; ~14 myr for {\chi} per (ngc 884); and~20 myr for ngc 1960 (m 36).

[ca/fe] and [si/fe] show solar ratios, but[mg/fe] is moderately enhanced, while [ti/fe] appears slightly deficient. aswith many open clusters, [na/fe] and [al/fe] are enhanced, [na/fe]significantly so, although the role of internal mixing and the assumption oflte in the analysis remain to be investigated. from isochrone fits tocolor-magnitude diagrams, we find a cluster age of 0.5 to 0.63 gyr, a reddeningof e(b-v) = 0.59 to 0.65, and a true distance modulus (m-m) = 11.95 to 12.20,depending on the choice of theoretical models, leading to a galactocentricdistance of 6.9 kpc.

1404.0683	the effect of starspots on the radii of low-mass pre-main sequence stars	a polytropic model is used to investigate the effects of dark photosphericspots on the evolution and radii of magnetically active, low-mass (m&lt;0.5msun),pre-main sequence (pms) stars. spots slow the contraction along hayashi tracksand inflate the radii of pms stars by a factor of (1-beta)^{-n} compared tounspotted stars of the same luminosity, where beta is the equivalent coveringfraction of dark starspots and n \simeq 0.45+/-0.05. this is a much strongerinflation than predicted by the models of spruit &amp; weiss (1986) for mainsequence stars with the same beta, where n \sim 0.2 to 0.3. these models havebeen compared to radii determined for very magnetically active k- and m-dwarfsin the young pleiades and ngc 2516 clusters, and the radii of tidally-locked,low-mass eclipsing binary components. the binary components and zams k-dwarfshave radii inflated by \sim 10 per cent compared to an empiricalradius-luminosity relation that is defined by magnetically inactive fielddwarfs with interferometrically measured radii; low-mass m-type pms stars, thatare still on their hayashi tracks, are inflated by up to \sim 40 per cent. ifthis were attributable to starspots alone, we estimate that an effective spotcoverage of 0.35 &lt; beta &lt; 0.51 is required. alternatively, global inhibition ofconvective flux transport by dynamo-generated fields may play a role. however,we find greater consistency with the starspot models when comparing the loci ofactive young stars and inactive field stars in colour-magnitude diagrams,particularly for the highly inflated pms stars, where the large, uniformtemperature reduction required in globally inhibited convection models wouldcause the stars to be much redder than observed.

1405.6586	the gaia-eso survey: the first abundance determination of the  pre-main-sequence cluster gamma velorum	knowledge of the abundance distribution of star forming regions and youngclusters is critical to investigate a variety of issues, from triggered starformation and chemical enrichment by nearby supernova explosions to the abilityto form planetary systems.in spite of this, detailed abundance studies arecurrently available for relatively few regions. in this context, we present theanalysis of the metallicity of the gamma velorum cluster, based on the productsdistributed in the first internal release of the gaia-eso survey. the gammavelorum candidate members have been observed with flames, using both uves andgiraffe, depending on the target brightness and spectral type. in order toderive a solid metallicity determination for the cluster, membership of theobserved stars must be first assessed. to this aim, we use several membershipcriteria including radial velocities, surface gravity estimates, and thedetection of the photospheric lithium line. out of the 80 targets observed withuves, we identify 14 high-probability members. we find that the metallicity ofthe cluster is slightly subsolar, with a mean [fe/h]=-0.057+/-0.018 dex.although j08095427-4721419 is one of the high-probability members, itsmetallicity is significantly larger than the cluster average. we speculateabout its origin as the result of recent accretion episodes of rocky bodies of~60 m_sun hydrogen-depleted material from the circumstellar disk.

1410.0022	the effect of starspots on the ages of low-mass stars determined from  the lithium depletion boundary	in a coeval group of low-mass stars, the luminosity of the sharp transitionbetween stars that retain their initial lithium and those at slightly highermasses in which li has been depleted by nuclear reactions, the lithiumdepletion boundary (ldb), has been advanced as an almost model-independentmeans of establishing an age scale for young stars. here we constructpolytropic models of contracting pre-main sequence stars (pms) that have cool,magnetic starspots blocking a fraction $\beta$ of their photospheric flux.starspots slow the descent along hayashi tracks, leading to lower coretemperatures and less li destruction at a given mass and age. the age,$\tau_{\rm ldb}$, determined from the luminosity of the ldb, $l_{\rm ldb}$, isincreased by a factor $(1-\beta)^{-e}$ compared to that inferred from unspottedmodels, where $e \simeq 1 + d\log \tau_{\rm ldb}/d \log l_{\rm ldb}$ and has avalue $\sim 0.5$ at ages $&lt; 80$ myr, decreasing to $\sim 0.3$ for older stars.spotted stars have virtually the same relationship between k-band bolometriccorrection and colour as unspotted stars, so this relationship applies equallyto ages inferred from the absolute k magnitude of the ldb. low-mass pms starsdo have starspots, but the appropriate value of $\beta$ is highly uncertainwith a probable range of $0.1 &lt; \beta &lt; 0.4$. for the smaller $\beta$ valuesour result suggests a modest systematic increase in ldb ages that is comparablewith the maximum levels of theoretical uncertainty previously claimed for thetechnique. the largest $\beta$ values would however increase ldb ages by 20-30per cent and demand a re-evaluation of other age estimation techniquescalibrated using ldb ages.

1411.4886	the gaia-eso survey: kinematics of seven galactic globular clusters	the gaia-eso survey is a large public spectroscopic survey aimed atinvestigating the origin and formation history of our galaxy by collectingspectroscopy of representative samples (about 10^5 milky way stars) of allgalactic stellar populations, in the field and in clusters. the survey usesglobular clusters as intra- and inter-survey calibrators, deriving stellaratmospheric parameters and abundances of a significant number of stars inclusters, along with radial velocity determinations. we used precise radialvelocities of a large number of stars in seven globular clusters (ngc 1851, ngc2808, ngc 4372, ngc 4833, ngc 5927, ngc 6752, and ngc 7078) to validatepipeline results and to preliminarily investigate the cluster internalkinematics. radial velocity measurements were extracted from flames/giraffespectra processed by the survey pipeline as part of the second internal datarelease of data products to eso. we complemented our sample with eso archivaldata obtained with different instrument configurations. reliable radialvelocity measurements for 1513 bona fide cluster star members were obtained intotal. we measured systemic rotation, estimated central velocity dispersions,and present velocity dispersion profiles of all the selected clusters,providing the first velocity dispersion curve and the first estimate of thecentral velocity dispersion for the cluster ngc~5927. finally, we explore thepossible link between cluster kinematics and other physical parameters. theanalysis we present here demonstrates that gaia-eso survey data aresufficiently accurate to be used in studies of kinematics of stellar systemsand stellar populations in the milky way.

1504.02484	the gaia-eso survey: n-body modelling of the gamma velorum cluster	the gaia-eso survey has recently unveiled the complex kinematic signature ofthe gamma velorum cluster: this cluster is composed of two kinematicallydistinct populations (hereafter, population a and b), showing two differentvelocity dispersions and a relative ~2 km s^-1 radial velocity (rv) shift. inthis paper, we propose that the two populations of the gamma velorum clusteroriginate from two different sub-clusters, born from the same parent molecularcloud. we investigate this possibility by means of direct-summation n-bodysimulations. our scenario is able to reproduce not only the rv shift and thedifferent velocity dispersions, but also the different centroid (~0.5 pc), thedifferent spatial concentration and the different line-of-sight distance (~5pc) of the two populations. the observed 1-2 myr age difference between the twopopulations is also naturally explained by our scenario, in which the twosub-clusters formed in two slightly different star formation episodes. oursimulations suggest that population b is strongly supervirial, while populationa is close to virial equilibrium. we discuss the implications of our models forthe formation of young star clusters and ob associations in the milky way.

astro-ph;0207489	lithium 6104a in population ii stars	we have obtained echelle spectroscopy of 14 population ii objects selectedfrom those previously observed by bonifacio &amp; molaro (1997). for one object, hd140283, we obtained exquisite data with the high dispersion spectrograph on thesubaru telescope, with s/n exceeding 1000 per 0.018a pixel. li abundances havebeen determined by spectral synthesis from both the 6708a resonance line andalso from 6104a subordinate feature. firm detections of the weak line have beenmade in seven objects, and upper limits are reported for the remainder. our6708a abundances agree with those reported by bonifacio &amp; molaro at the99%-confidence level. abundances from the 6104a line hint at a higher liabundance than that determined from the resonance feature, but this evidence ismixed; the weakness of the 6104a line and the large number of upper limits makeit difficult to draw firm conclusions. nlte-corrections increase (rather thaneliminate) the size of the (potential) discrepancy, and binarity appearsunlikely to affect any abundance difference. the effect of multi-dimensionalatmospheres on the line abundances was also considered, although it appearsthat use of 3-d (lte) models could again act to increase the discrepancy, ifone is indeed present.

astro-ph;0302205	the discovery of low-mass pre main sequence stars in cepheus ob3b	we report the discovery of low-mass pms stars in the younger subgroup of thecepheus ob3 association, cep ob3b, using {\it ubvi} ccd photometry andspectroscopy. the location of a pms is well defined in a v versus (v-i)colour-magnitude diagram (cmd). multi-fibre spectroscopy results ofoptically-selected pms candidates confirm the t tauri nature of 10 objects,with equal numbers of classical and weak-line tts. there are 6 other objectswhich we classify as possible pms stars. the newly discovered tts have massesin the range 0.9 - 3.0 msun and ages from &lt;1 to nearly 10 myr, based on thesiess et al.(2000) isochrones. their location close to the o and b theirlocation close to the o and b stars of the association demonstrates thatlow-mass star formation is possible in this hostile environment dominated byearly-type stars and that the latter must have been less effective in erodingthe circumstellar discs of their lower mass siblings compared to other obassociations (e.g. lambda ori). we attribute this to the nature of the localenvironment, speculating that the bulk of molecular material, which shieldedlow-mass stars from the ionising radiation of their early-type siblings, hasonly recently been removed (abridged).

astro-ph;0303083	the lithium depletion boundary and the age of ngc 2547	we present the results of a photometric and spectroscopic survey of cool mdwarf candidates in the young open cluster ngc 2547. using the 2df fiberspectrograph, we have searched for the luminosity at which lithium remainsunburned in an attempt to constrain the cluster age. the lack of a populationof individual lithium-rich objects towards the faint end of our sample places avery strong lower limit to the cluster age of 35 myr. however, the detection oflithium in the averaged spectra of our faintest targets suggests that thelithium depletion boundary lies at 9.5 &lt; m(i) &lt; 10.0 and that the cluster ageis &lt; 54 myr. the age of ngc 2547 judged from fitting isochrones to low-masspre-main-sequence stars in colour-magnitude diagrams is 20-35 myr using thesame evolutionary models. the sense and size of the discrepancy in agedetermined by these two techniques is similar to that found in another youngcluster, ic 2391, and in the low-mass pre main-sequence binary system, gj871.1ab. we suggest that the inclusion of rotation or dynamo-generated magneticfields in the evolutionary models could reconcile the two age determinations,but only at the expense of increasing the cluster ages beyond that currentlyindicated by the lithium depletion. alternatively, some mechanism is requiredthat increases the rate of lithium depletion in young, very low-mass fullyconvective stars.

astro-ph;0305501	young stars and their circumstellar disks in the sigma orionis cluster	the sigma orionis cluster is a young association evolving under thedisruptive influence of its massive o-star namesake. we are analysing thiscluster as part of a program to characterise the influence of o-stars on theearly stages of stellar evolution. at an age of approximately 4 myr, thiscluster is at a crucial stage in terms of disk evolution and therefore it is akey case to better constrain disk dissipation timescales. we have obtained riphotometry and optical spectroscopy of the sigma ori cluster; we have analysedthe li i and na i features to establish cluster membership. we have thusgathered a unique sample of spectroscopically confirmed low-mass clustermembers and brown dwarfs. disk frequencies from k-band excesses from 2masssuggest that less than 7% of the very low-mass sigma ori members have disks, instark contrast with even younger clusters (e.g. trapezium). however,near-infrared disk frequencies have to be taken with caution. we are currentlyundertaking an l-band (imaging) and mid-infrared (imaging and spectroscopy)program to identify and probe the properties of circumstellar disks aroundyoung stars in this cluster. preliminary results indicate that at least 30% ofcluster members have circumstellar disks.

astro-ph;0308488	on the nature of collinder 121: insights from the low-mass pre-main  sequence	we present a vi photometric catalogue towards the open cluster cr 121.xmm-newton and rosat data are used to discover a low-mass pre-main sequence(pms) along this sight-line. de zeeuw et al (1999) identified cr 121 as amoving group, using hipparcos data, at a distance of 592 pc. we reject thescenario that these low-mass pms stars are associated with that association. byconsidering the higher mass main sequence stellar membership of the groupsalong this sight-line, the density of low-mass pms stars and their age spreadwe argue that the low-mass pms stars are associated with a young, compactcluster at a distance of 1050 pc. this is consistent with the originaldescription of cr 121 (collinder, 1931), and we argue that this distant compactcluster should retain its original designation. the moving group detected by dezeeuw et al (1999) resembles a foreground association and we agree with eggen(1981) that this should be called cma ob2.  this study demonstrates that although the de zeeuw et al (1999) census of obassociations is an invaluable resource for studying local star formation, itmust be interpreted in the context other data when considering structure overdistances of the same order as the limits of the hipparcos parallaxes.

astro-ph;0404028	low mass stars, brown dwarf candidates and the mass function of the  young open cluster ngc 2547	we present a catalogue of riz photometry over an area of 0.855 squaredegrees, centred on ngc 2547. the survey is substantially complete to limits ofr_c=21.5, i_c=19.5, z=19.5. we use the catalogue to define ngc 2547 candidateswith masses of about 0.05-1.0 m_sun. after correcting for incompleteness andcontamination by foreground field dwarfs, we investigate the mass function ofthe cluster, its binary content, and search for evidence of mass segregationamong lower mass stars. there is evidence for mass segregation between high (&gt;3m_sun) and lower mass stars, but over the range 0.1&lt;m&lt;0.7 m_sun, the data areconsistent with no further mass segregation. by fitting king profiles weconclude that at least 60 percent of the low-mass stellar population arecontained in our survey. the cluster mass function is remarkably similar to thepleiades for 0.075&lt;m&lt;0.7 m_sun. because of its age (~30 myr), we demonstratethat this mass function is robust to several systematic uncertainties likely toaffect older and younger clusters and is therefore one of the best availableestimates for the initial mass function in young disc populations. for0.05&lt;m&lt;0.075 m_sun there is some evidence for a deficit of brown dwarfs in ngc2547 compared with other clusters. this deficit may extend to lower masses ormay only be a dip, perhaps caused by an imperfect understanding of themass-magnitude relationship at temperatures of 2800k.incompleteness in oursurvey, and the luminosity functions from which we estimate contamination,leave this question open. the binary fraction for systems with mass ratiosgreater than about 0.5 is 20-35 per cent for m-dwarfs in ngc 2547, quiteconsistent with that found in the field (abridged).

astro-ph;0408223	the li overabundance of j37: diffusion or accretion?	in september 2002 the discovery of a super li-rich f-dwarf (j37) in ngc 6633,an iron poor analogue of the better studied hyades and praecepe open clusters,was announced. this unique star was thought to be the smoking gun for theaction of diffusion, models of which predict a narrow "li-peak" atapproximately the correct temperature. however, with more detailed studies intoj37s abundance pattern this star provides firm evidence for the accretion ofplanetesimals or other material from the circumstellar environment of new bornstars.  thanks to the specific predictions made about the behaviour of be abundances,(the most striking of which being no be in super-li-rich dwarfs subject todiffusion) the opposing diffusion/accretion predictions can be tested.  initial modelling of the be line indicates that j37 is as be rich as it is lirich; log n(be) = 2.25 +/- 0.25, and so is broadly consistent with anaccretion-fuelled enhancement. however, that both li and be are enhanced bymuch more than the iron-peak elements (as determined in previous studies)suggests that diffusion also plays a role in increasing the abundances of liand be specifically.  furthermore, a new data set from the uves/ut2 combination has allowed theelemental abundance of iron to be measured, and the set of preliminary stellarparameters determined; teff ~ 7340 k, log g ~ 4.1, microturbulence ~ 4.3 km/s,[fe/h] ~ 0.50. this again provides distinct evidence for the effects ofaccretion in j37 and requires a new synthesis of the be doublet.

astro-ph;0409749	membership, binarity and accretion among very low-mass stars and brown  dwarfs of the sigma orionis cluster	intermediate resolution (r=7000) spectroscopy is presented for 76photometrically selected very low mass (0.04&lt;m&lt;0.3m_{sun}) candidate members ofthe sigma orionis cluster. more than two thirds appear to be genuine clustermembers on the basis of li i absorption, weak na i features and radialvelocities. photometric selection alone therefore appears to be very effectivein identifying cluster members in this mass range. only 6 objects appear to becertain non-members, however a substantial subset of 13 have ambiguous orcontradictory indications of membership and lack li absorption. four candidatebinary cluster members are identified. consideration of sampling and precisionleads us to conclude that either the fraction of very low mass stars and browndwarfs in small separation (a&lt;1au) binary systems is larger than in fieldm-dwarfs, or the distribution of separations is much less skewed towards largeseparations. this conclusion hinges critically on the correct identification ofthe small number of binary candidates, but is significant even when onlyli-rich candidate members are considered. broadened h alpha emission,indicative of circum(sub)stellar accretion discs is found in 5 or 6 of thecandidate cluster members, 3 of which probably have substellar masses. thefraction of accretors (10+/-5 per cent) is similar to that found in stars ofhigher mass in the cluster using h alpha emission as a diagnostic, but muchlower than found for very low mass stars and brown dwarfs of younger clusters.the timescale for accretion rates to drop to less than 10^{-11} m_sun/yr ishence less than the age of the sigma ori cluster (3 to 7 myr) for most low-massobjects (abridged).

astro-ph;0411418	contamination and exclusion in the sigma orionis young group	we present radial velocities for 38 low-mass candidate members of the sigmaorionis young group. we have measured their radial velocities bycross-correlation of high resolution (r~6000) af2/wyffos spectra of the gravitysensitive nai doublet at 8183, 8195angstroms. the total sample contained 117objects of which 54 have sufficient signal-to-noise to detect nai at anequivalent width of 3angstroms, however we only detect nai in 38 of these. thisimplies that very low-mass members of this young group display weaker naiabsorption than similarly aged objects in the upper scorpius ob association. wedevelop a technique to assess membership using radial velocities with a rangeof uncertainties that does not bias the selection when large uncertainties arepresent. the resulting membership probabilities are used to assess the issue ofexclusion in photometric selections, and we find that very few members arelikely to be excluded by such techniques.  we also assess the level of contamination in the expected pre-main sequenceregion of colour-magnitude space brighter than i = 17. we find thatcontamination by non-members in the expected pms region of the colour-magnitudediagram is small. we conclude that although radial velocity alone isinsufficient to confirm membership, high signal-to-noise observations of thenai doublet provide the opportunity to use the strength of nai absorption inconcert with radial velocities to asses membership down to the lowest masses,where lithium absorption no longer distinguishes youth.

astro-ph;0501534	do accretion discs regulate the rotation of young stars?	we present a photometric study of i-band variability in the young cluster ic348. the main purpose of the study was to identify periodic stars. in all wefind 50 periodic stars, of which 32 were previously unknown. for the first timein ic 348, we discover periods in significant numbers of lower-mass stars (m &lt;0.25 msun) and classical t-tauri stars. this increased sensitivity toperiodicities is due to the enhanced depth and temporal density of ourobservations, compared with previous studies. the period distribution is atfirst glance similar to that seen in the orion nebula cluster, with thehigher-mass stars (m &gt; 0.25 msun) showing a bi-modal period distributionconcentrated around periods of 2 and 8 days, and the lower-mass stars showing auni-modal distribution, heavily biassed towards fast rotators. closerinspection of the period distribution shows that the higher mass stars show asignificant dearth of fast rotators, compared to the orion nebula cluster,whilst the low mass stars are rotating significantly faster than those inorion. we find no correlation between rotation period and k-l colour or h-alphaequivalent width.  we also present a discussion of our own ic 348 data in the context ofpreviously published period distributions for the orion nebula cluster, theorion flanking fields and ngc 2264. we find that the previously claimedcorrelation between infrared excess and rotation period in the onc might infact result from a correlation between infrared excess and mass. we also find amarked difference in period distributions between ngc 2264 and ic 348, whichpresents a serious challenge to the disc locking paradigm, given the similarityin ages and disc fractions between the two clusters.

astro-ph;0508125	beryllium enhancement as evidence for accretion in a lithium-rich f  dwarf	the early f dwarf star ``j37'' in the open cluster ngc6633 shows an unusualpattern of photospheric abundances, including an order of magnitude enhancementof lithium and iron-peak elements, but an under-abundance of carbon. as aconsequence of its thin convection zone these anomalies have been attributed toeither radiative diffusion or the accretion of hydrogen-depleted material. bycomparing high resolution vlt/uves spectra of j37 (and other f stars in ngc6633) with syntheses of the be ii doublet region at 3131 ang, we establish thatj37 also has a be abundance (a(be)=3.0+/-0.5) that is at least ten times thecosmic value. this contradicts radiative diffusion models that produce a liover-abundance, as they also predict photospheric be depletion. instead, sincebe is a highly refractory element, it supports the notion that j37 is the firstclear example of a star that has accreted volatile-depleted material with acomposition similar to chondritic meteorites, although some diffusion may benecessary to explain the low c and o abundances.

astro-ph;0508487	can variability account for apparent age spreads in ob association  colour-magnitude diagrams?	we have investigated the role of photometric variability in causing theapparent age spreads observed in the colour-magnitude diagrams of obassociations. we have found that the combination of binarity, photometricuncertainty and variability on timescales of a few years is not sufficient toexplain the observed spread in either of the ob associations we have studied.such effects can account for about half the observed spread in the sigmaorionis subgroup and about 1/20 of the observed spread in cep ob3b. this rulesout variability caused by stellar rotation and rotation of structures withininner accretion discs as the source of the majority of the the apparent agespreads. we also find that the variability tends to move objects parallel toisochrones in v/v-i' cmds, and thus has little influence on apparent agespreads. we conclude that the remaining unexplained spread either reflects atrue spread in the ages of the pms objects or arises as a result of longer termvariability associated with changes in accretion flow.

astro-ph;0508606	elemental abundances in the blanco 1 open cluster	high resolution spectroscopy is used to determine the detailed chemicalabundances of a group of eight f- and g-type stars in the young open clusterblanco 1. an average [fe/h] of +0.04 +/- 0.02 (internal error) +/- 0.04(external error) is found, considerably lower than a previous spectroscopicestimate for this cluster. the difference is due mainly to our adoption ofsignificantly cooler temperatures which are consistent with both photometricand spectroscopic constraints. blanco~1 exhibits sub-solar [ni/fe] (-0.18 +/-0.01 +/- 0.01), [si/fe] (-0.09$ +/- 0.02 +/- 0.03), [mg/fe] (-0.14 +/- 0.02 +/-0.03) and [ca/fe] (-0.09 +/- 0.03 +/- 0.03); ratios which are not observedamong nearby field stars. the material from which blanco 1 formed may not havebeen well mixed with interstellar matter in the galactic disc, which tallieswith its current location about 240pc below the galactic plane. a simultaneousdeficit of ni and alpha elements with respect to fe is hard to reconcile withmost published models of yields from supernovae of types ia and ii. the revisedabundances for blanco 1 indicate that overall radiative opacities in its stars,and hence convective zone properties at a given mass, are similar to those inthe pleiades at approximately the same age. this can explain a previousobservation that the li depletion patterns of g- and k-type stars in the twoclusters are indistinguishable. the lower overall metallicity of blanco 1 nowmake it less attractive as a target for discovering transiting, short periodexoplanets.

astro-ph;0612090	empirical isochrones and relative ages for young stars, and the  radiative-convective gap	we have selected pre-main-sequence stars in 12 groups of notional agesranging from 1 myr to 35 myrs, using heterogeneous membership criteria. usingthese members we have constructed empirical isochrones in v, v-i colourmagnitude diagrams (cmds). this allows us to identify clearly the gap betweenthe radiative main sequence and the convective pre-main-sequence (the r-c gap).we follow the evolution of this gap with age and show that it can be a usefulage indicator for groups less than ~15 myrs old. we also observe a reduction inabsolute spreads about the sequences with age. finally the empirical isochronesallow us to place the groups in order of age, independently of theory. theyoungest groups can be collated into three sets of similar ages. the youngestset is the onc, ngc6530 and ic5146 (nominally 1 myrs); next cep ob3b, ngc2362,lambda ori and ngc2264 (nominally 3 myrs); and finally sigma ori and ic348(nominally 4-5 myrs). this suggests cep ob3b is younger than previouslythought, and ic348 older. for ic348 the stellar rotation rate distribution andfraction of stars with discs imply a younger age than we derive. we suggestthis is because of the absence of o-stars in this cluster, whose winds and/orionising radiation may be an important factor in the removal of discs in otherclusters.

astro-ph;0701186	the distance to the orion nebula cluster	the distance to the orion nebula cluster (onc) is estimated using therotational properties of its low-mass pre main-sequence (pms) stars. rotationperiods, projected equatorial velocities and distance-dependent radiusestimates are used to form an observational sin i distribution (where i is theaxial inclination), which is modelled to obtain the distance estimate. adistance of 440+/-34 pc is found from a sample of 74 pms stars with spectraltypes between g6 and m2, but this falls to 392+/-32 pc when pms stars withaccretion discs are excluded on the basis of their near-infrared excess. sincethe radii of accreting stars are more uncertain and probably systematicallyunderestimated, then this closer distance is preferred. the quoteduncertainties include statistical errors and uncertainties due to a number ofsystematic effects including binarity and inclination bias. this method isgeometric and independent of stellar evolution models, though does rely on theassumption of random axial orientations and the cohen &amp; kuhi (1979) effectivetemperature scale for pms stars. the new distance is consistent with, althoughlower and more precise, than most previous onc distance estimates. a closer oncdistance implies smaller luminosities and an increased age based on thepositions of pms stars in the hertzsprung-russell diagram.

astro-ph;9809106	lithium in blanco1: implications for stellar mixing	we obtain lithium abundances for g and k stars in blanco 1, an open clusterwith an age similar to, or slightly younger than, the pleiades. we criticallyexamine previous spectroscopic abundance analyses of blanco 1 and conclude thatwhile there were flaws in earlier work, it is likely that blanco 1 is close inoverall metallicity to the older hyades cluster and more metal-rich than thepleiades. however, we find blanco 1 has li abundances and rotation ratessimilar to the pleiades, contradicting predictions from standard stellarevolution models, in which convective pre-main sequence (pms) li depletionshould increase rapidly with metallicity. if the high metallicity of blanco 1is subsequently confirmed, our observations imply (1) that a currently unknownmechanism severely inhibits pms li depletion, (2) that additional non-standardmixing modes, such as those driven by rotation and angular momentum loss, arethen responsible for main sequence li depletion between the ages of blanco 1and the hyades, and (3) that in clusters younger than the hyades, metallicityplays only a minor role in determining the amount of li depletion among g and kstars. these conclusions suggest that li abundance remains a useful ageindicator among young (less than 700 myr) stars even when metallicities areunknown. if non-standard mixing is effective in population i stars, theprimordial li abundance could be significantly larger than present daypopulation ii li abundances, due to prior li depletion.

(2005). we compare thefinal imf with those of well studied star forming regions: we find that the imfof ngc 6611 more closely resembles that of the low-mass star forming region intaurus than that of the more massive orion nebula cluster (onc). we concludethat there seems to be no severe environmental effect in the imf due to theproximity of the massive stars in ngc 6611.
