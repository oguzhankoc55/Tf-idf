0901.1601	a complete 12co 2--1 map of m51 with hera: ii. total gas surface  densities and gravitational stability	to date the onset of large-scale star formation in galaxies and its link togravitational stability of the galactic disk have not been fully understood.the nearby face-on spiral galaxy m51 is an ideal target for studying thissubject. this paper combines co, dust, hi, and stellar maps of m51 and itscompanion galaxy to study the h2/hi transition, the gas-to-dust ratios, and thestability of the disk against gravitational collapse. we combine maps of themolecular gas using 12co 2--1 map hera/iram-30m data and hi vla data to studythe total gas surface density and the phase transition of atomic to moleculargas. the total gas surface density is compared to the dust surface density from850 micron scuba data. taking into account the velocity dispersions of themolecular and atomic gas, and the stellar surface densities derived from the2mass k-band survey, we derive the total toomre q parameter of the disk. thegas surface density in the spiral arms is approximately 2-3 higher compared tothat of the interarm regions. the ratio of molecular to atomic surface densityshows a nearly power-law dependence on the hydrostatic pressure p_hydro. thegas surface density distribution in m51 shows an underlying exponentialdistribution with a scale length of h_gas=7.6 kpc representing 55% of the totalgas mass, comparable to the properties of the exponential dust disk. incontrast to the velocity widths observed in hi, the co velocity dispersionshows enhanced line widths in the spiral arms compared to the interarm regions.the contribution of the stellar component in the toomre q-parameter analysis issignificant and lowers the combined q-parameter q_tot by up to 70% towards thethreshold for gravitational instability. the value of q_tot varies from 1.5-3in radial averages. a map of q_tot shows values around 1 on the spiral arms.

0905.4742	heracles: the hera co-line extragalactic survey	we present the hera co-line extragalactic survey (heracles), an atlas of coemission from 18 nearby galaxies that are also part of the hi nearby galaxysurvey (things) and the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings). weused the hera multi-pixel receiver on the iram 30-m telescope to map the coj=2-1 line over the full optical disk (defined by the isophotal radius r_25) ofeach target, at 13" angular resolution and 2.6 km/s velocity resolution. herewe describe the observations and reduction of the data and show channel maps,azimuthally averaged profiles, integrated intensity maps, and peak intensitymaps. the implied h2 masses range from 7 \times 10^6 to 6 \times 10^9 m_sun,with four low metallicity dwarf irregular galaxies yielding only upper limits.in the cases where co is detected, the integrated h2-to-hi ratios range from0.02 - 1.13 and h2-to-stellar mass ratios from 0.01 to 0.25. exponential scalelengths of the co emission for our targets are in the range 0.8 - 3.2 kpc, or0.2 \pm 0.05 r_25. the intensity-weighted mean velocity of co matches that ofhi very well, with a 1\sigma scatter of only 6 km/s. the co j=2-1 / j=1-0 lineratio varies over a range similar to that found in the milky way and othernearby galaxies, \sim 0.6 - 1.0, with higher values found in the centers ofgalaxies. the typical line ratio, \sim 0.8, could be produced by opticallythick gas with an excitation temperature of \sim 10 k.

1003.3222	molecular and atomic gas in the local group galaxy m33	we present high resolution large scale observations of the molecular andatomic gas in the local group galaxy m33. the observations were carried outusing the hera at the 30m iram telescope in the co(2-1) line achieving aresolution of 12"x2.6 km/s, enabling individual gmcs to be resolved. theobserved region mainly along the major axis out to a radius of 8.5 kpc, andcovers the strip observed with hifi/pacs spectrometers as part of the herm33esherschel key program. the achieved sensitivity in main beam temperature is20-50 mk at 2.6 km/s velocity resolution. the co(2-1) luminosity of theobserved region is 1.7\pm0.1x10^7 kkm/s pc^2, corresponding to h2 masses of1.9x10^8 msun (including he), calculated with a nh2/ico twice the galacticvalue due to the half-solar metallicity of m33. hi 21 cm vla archiveobservations were reduced and the mosaic was imaged and cleaned using themulti-scale task in casa, yielding a series of datacubes with resolutionsranging from 5" to 25". the hi mass within a radius of 8.5 kpc is estimated tobe 1.4x10^9 msun. the azimuthally averaged co surface brightness decreasesexponentially with a scale length of 1.9\pm0.1 kpc whereas the atomic gassurface density is constant at sigma_hi=6\pm2 msun/pc^2 deprojected to face-on.the central kiloparsec h_2 surface density is sigma_h2=8.5\pm0.2 msun/pc^2. thestar formation rate per unit molecular gas (sf efficiency, the rate oftransformation of molecular gas into stars), as traced by the ratio of co tohalpha and fir brightness, is constant with radius. the sfe appears 2-4 timesgreater than of large spiral galaxies. a morphological comparison of molecularand atomic gas with tracers of star formation shows good agreement betweenthese maps both in terms of peaks and holes. a few exceptions are noted.several spectra, including those of a molecular cloud situated more than 8 kpcfrom the galaxy center, are presented.

1005.2182	100 mum and 160 mum emission as resolved star-formation rate estimators  in m33 (herm33es)	over the past few years several studies have provided estimates of the sfr(star-formation rate) or the total infrared luminosity from just one infraredband. however these relations are generally derived for entire galaxies, whichare known to contain a large scale diffuse emission that is not necessarilyrelated to the latest star-formation episode. we provide new relations toestimate the sfr from resolved star-forming regions at 100 mum and 160 mum. weselect individual star-forming regions in the nearby (840 kpc) galaxy m33. weestimate the sfr combining the emission in halpha and at 24 mum to calibratethe emission at 100 mum and 160 mum as sfr estimators, as mapped withpacs/herschel. the data are obtained in the framework of the herm33es open timekey project. there is less emission in the hii regions at 160 mum than at 100mum. over a dynamic range of almost 2 dex in sigma(sfr) we find that the 100mum emission is a nearly linear estimator of the sfr, whereas that at 160 mumis slightly superlinear. the behaviour of individual star-forming regions issurprisingly similar to that of entire galaxies. at high sigma(sfr), starformation drives the dust temperature, whereas uncertainties and variations inradiation-transfer and dust-heated processes dominate at low sigma(sfr).detailed modelling of both galaxies and individual star forming regions will beneeded to interpret similarities and differences between the two and assess thefraction of diffuse emission in galaxies.

1005.2297	properties of compact 250 \mu m emission and hii regions in m33  (herm33es)	within the framework of the herm33es key project, using the high resolutionand sensitivity of the herschel photometric data, we study the compact emissionin the local group spiral galaxy m33 to investigate the nature of the compactspire emission sources. we extracted a catalogue of sources at 250um in orderto investigate the nature of this compact emission. taking advantage of theunprecedented herschel resolution at these wavelengths, we also focus on a moreprecise study of some striking halpha shells in the northern part of thegalaxy. we present a catalogue of 159 compact emission sources in m33identified by sextractor in the 250um spire band that is the one that providesthe best spatial resolution. we also measured fluxes at 24um and halpha forthose 159 extracted sources. the morphological study of the shells alsobenefits from a multiwavelength approach including halpha, far-uv from galex,and infrared from both spitzer irac 8um and mips 24um in order to makecomparisons. for the 159 compact sources selected at 250um, we find a verystrong pearson correlation coefficient with the mips 24um emission (r24 = 0.94)and a rather strong correlation with the halpha emission, although with morescatter (rha = 0.83). the morphological study of the halpha shells shows adisplacement between far-ultraviolet, halpha, and the spire bands. the cooldust emission from spire clearly delineates the halpha shell structures. thevery strong link between the 250um compact emission and the 24um and halphaemissions, by recovering the star formation rate from standard recipes for hiiregions, allows us to provide star formation rate calibrations based on the250um compact emission alone. the different locations of the halpha andfar-ultraviolet emissions with respect to the spire cool dust emission leads toa dynamical age of a few myr for the halpha shells and the associated cooldust.

1005.2517	hifi observations of warm gas in dr21: shock versus radiative heating	the molecular gas in the dr21 massive star formation region is known to beaffected by the strong uv field from the central star cluster and by a fastoutflow creating a bright shock. the relative contribution of both heatingmechanisms is the matter of a long debate. by better sampling the excitationladder of various tracers we provide a quantitative distinction between thedifferent heating mechanisms. hifi observations of mid-j transitions of co andhco+ isotopes allow us to bridge the gap in excitation energies betweenobservations from the ground, characterizing the cooler gas, and existing isolws spectra, constraining the properties of the hot gas. comparing the detailedline profiles allows to identify the physical structure of the differentcomponents. in spite of the known shock-excitation of h2 and the clearlyvisible strong outflow, we find that the emission of all lines up to &gt; 2 thzcan be explained by purely radiative heating of the material. however, the newherschel/hifi observations reveal two types of excitation conditions. we findhot and dense clumps close to the central cluster, probably dynamicallyaffected by the outflow, and a more widespread distribution of cooler, butnevertheless dense, molecular clumps.

1005.2521	detection of interstellar oxidaniumyl: abundant h2o+ towards the  star-forming regions dr21, sgr b2, and ngc6334	we identify a prominent absorption feature at 1115 ghz, detected in firsthifi spectra towards high-mass star-forming regions, and interpret itsastrophysical origin. the characteristic hyperfine pattern of the h2o+ground-state rotational transition, and the lack of other known low-energytransitions in this frequency range, identifies the feature as h2o+ absorptionagainst the dust continuum background and allows us to derive the velocityprofile of the absorbing gas. by comparing this velocity profile with velocityprofiles of other tracers in the dr21 star-forming region, we constrain thefrequency of the transition and the conditions for its formation. in dr21, thevelocity distribution of h2o+ matches that of the [cii] line at 158\mu\m and ofoh cm-wave absorption, both stemming from the hot and dense clump surfacesfacing the hii-region and dynamically affected by the blister outflow. diffuseforeground gas dominates the absorption towards sgr b2. the integratedintensity of the absorption line allows us to derive lower limits to the h2o+column density of 7.2e12 cm^-2 in ngc 6334, 2.3e13 cm^-2 in dr21, and 1.1e15cm^-2 in sgr b2.

1005.2563	pacs and spire photometer maps of m33: first results of the herschel m33  extended survey (herm33es)	within the framework of the herm33es key project, we are studying the starforming interstellar medium in the nearby, metal-poor spiral galaxy m33,exploiting the high resolution and sensitivity of herschel. we use pacs andspire maps at 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 micron wavelength, to study thevariation of the spectral energy distributions (seds) with galacto-centricdistance. detailed sed modeling is performed using azimuthally averaged fluxesin elliptical rings of 2 kpc width, out to 8 kpc galacto-centric distance.simple isothermal and two-component grey body models, with fixed dustemissivity index, are fitted to the seds between 24 and 500 micron using alsomips/spitzer data, to derive first estimates of the dust physical conditions.the far-infrared and submillimeter maps reveal the branched, knotted spiralstructure of m33. an underlying diffuse disk is seen in all spire maps (250-500micron). two component fits to the seds agree better than isothermal modelswith the observed, total and radially averaged flux densities. the twocomponent model, with beta fixed at 1.5, best fits the global and the radialseds. the cold dust component clearly dominates; the relative mass of the warmcomponent is less than 0.3% for all the fits. the temperature of the warmcomponent is not well constrained and is found to be about 60k plus/minus 10k.the temperature of the cold component drops significantly from about 24k in theinner 2 kpc radius to 13k beyond 6 kpc radial distance, for the best fittingmodel. the gas-to-dust ratio for beta=1.5, averaged over the galaxy, is higherthan the solar value by a factor of 1.5 and is roughly in agreement with thesubsolar metallicity of m33.

1005.2877	black hole accretion and star formation as drivers of gas excitation and  chemistry in mrk231	we present a full high resolution spire fts spectrum of the nearbyultraluminous infrared galaxy mrk231. in total 25 lines are detected, includingco j=5-4 through j=13-12, 7 rotational lines of h2o, 3 of oh+ and one line eachof h2o+, ch+, and hf. we find that the excitation of the co rotational levelsup to j=8 can be accounted for by uv radiation from star formation. however,the approximately flat luminosity distribution of the co lines over therotational ladder above j=8 requires the presence of a separate source ofexcitation for the highest co lines. we explore x-ray heating by the accretingsupermassive black hole in mrk231 as a source of excitation for these lines,and find that it can reproduce the observed luminosities. we also consider amodel with dense gas in a strong uv radiation field to produce the highest colines, but find that this model strongly overpredicts the hot dust mass inmrk231. our favoured model consists of a star forming disk of radius 560 pc,containing clumps of dense gas exposed to strong uv radiation, dominating theemission of co lines up to j=8. x-rays from the accreting supermassive blackhole in mrk231 dominate the excitation and chemistry of the inner disk out to aradius of 160 pc, consistent with the x-ray power of the agn in mrk231. theextraordinary luminosity of the oh+ and h2o+ lines reveals the signature ofx-ray driven excitation and chemistry in this region.

1005.3422	cool gas and dust in m33: results from the herschel m33 extended survey  (herm33es)	we present an analysis of the first space-based far-ir-submm observations ofm 33, which measure the emission from the cool dust and resolve the giantmolecular cloud complexes. with roughly half-solar abundances, m33 is a firststep towards young low-metallicity galaxies where the submm may be able toprovide an alternative to co mapping to measure their h$_2$ content. in thisletter, we measure the dust emission cross-section $\sigma$ using spire andrecent co and \hi\ observations; a variation in $\sigma$ is present from anear-solar neighborhood cross-section to about half-solar with the maximumbeing south of the nucleus. calculating the total h column density from themeasured dust temperature and cross-section, and then subtracting the \hi\column, yields a morphology similar to that observed in co. the h$_2$/\hi\ massratio decreases from about unity to well below 10% and is about 15% averagedover the optical disk. the single most important observation to reduce thepotentially large systematic errors is to complete the co mapping of m 33.

1005.3642	herschel observations of water vapour in markarian 231	the ultra luminous infrared galaxy mrk 231 reveals up to seven rotationallines of water (h2o) in emission, including a very high-lying (e_{upper}=640 k)line detected at a 4sigma level, within the herschel/spire wavelength range,whereas pacs observations show one h2o line at 78 microns in absorption, asfound for other h2o lines previously detected by iso. the absorption/emissiondichotomy is caused by the pumping of the rotational levels by far-infraredradiation emitted by dust, and subsequent relaxation through lines at longerwavelengths, which allows us to estimate both the column density of h2o and thegeneral characteristics of the underlying far-infrared continuum source.radiative transfer models including excitation through both absorption offar-infrared radiation emitted by dust and collisions are used to calculate theequilibrium level populations of h2o and the corresponding line fluxes. thehighest-lying h2o lines detected in emission, with levels at 300-640 k abovethe ground state, indicate that the source of far-infrared radiationresponsible for the pumping is compact (radius=110-180 pc) and warm(t_{dust}=85-95 k), accounting for at least 45% of the bolometric luminosity.the high column density, n(h2o)~5x10^{17} cm^{-2}, found in this nuclearcomponent, is most probably the consequence of shocks/cosmic rays, an xdrchemistry, and/or an "undepleted chemistry" where grain mantles are evaporated.a more extended region, presumably the inner region of the 1-kpc disk observedin other molecular species, could contribute to the flux observed in low-lyingh2o lines through dense hot cores, and/or shocks. the h2o 78 micron lineobserved with pacs shows hints of a blue-shifted wing seen in absorption,possibly indicating the occurrence of h2o in the prominent outflow detected inoh (fischer et al., this volume).

1006.5006	excitation of the molecular gas in the nuclear region of m82	we present high resolution hifi spectroscopy of the nucleus of thearchetypical starburst galaxy m82. six 12co lines, 2 13co lines and 4fine-structure lines are detected. besides showing the effects of the overallvelocity structure of the nuclear region, the line profiles also indicate thepresence of multiple components with different optical depths, temperatures anddensities in the observing beam. the data have been interpreted using a grid ofpdr models. it is found that the majority of the molecular gas is in lowdensity (n=10^3.5 cm^-3) clouds, with column densities of n_h=10^21.5 cm^-2 anda relatively low uv radiation field (go = 10^2). the remaining gas ispredominantly found in clouds with higher densities (n=10^5 cm^-3) andradiation fields (go = 10^2.75), but somewhat lower column densities(n_h=10^21.2 cm^-2). the highest j co lines are dominated by a small (1%relative surface filling) component, with an even higher density (n=10^6 cm^-3)and uv field (go = 10^3.25). these results show the strength of multi-componentmodeling for the interpretation of the integrated properties of galaxies.

1007.1167	hifi spectroscopy of low-level water transitions in m82	we present observations of the rotational ortho-water ground transition, thetwo lowest para-water transitions, and the ground transition of ionisedortho-water in the archetypal starburst galaxy m82, performed with the hifiinstrument on the herschel space observatory. these observations are the firstdetections of the para-h2o(111-000) (1113\,ghz) and ortho-h2o+(111-000)(1115\,ghz) lines in an extragalactic source. all three water lines showdifferent spectral line profiles, underlining the need for high spectralresolution in interpreting line formation processes. using the line shape ofthe para-h2o(111-000) and ortho-h2o+(111-000) absorption profile in conjunctionwith high spatial resolution co observations, we show that the (ionised) waterabsorption arises from a ~2000 pc^2 region within the hifi beam located about~50 pc east of the dynamical centre of the galaxy. this region does notcoincide with any of the known line emission peaks that have been identified inother molecular tracers, with the exception of hco. our data suggest that waterand ionised water within this region have high (up to 75%) area-coveringfactors of the underlying continuum. this indicates that water is notassociated with small, dense cores within the ism of m82 but arises from a morewidespread diffuse gas component.

1007.1523	herschel observations in the ultracompact hii region mon r2: water in  dense photon-dominated regions (pdrs)	mon r2, at a distance of 830 pc, is the only ultracompact hii region (uc hii)where the photon-dominated region (pdr) between the ionized gas and themolecular cloud can be resolved with herschel. hifi observations of theabundant compounds 13co, c18o, o-h2-18o, hco+, cs, ch, and nh have been used toderive the physical and chemical conditions in the pdr, in particular the waterabundance. the 13co, c18o, o-h2-18o, hco+ and cs observations are welldescribed assuming that the emission is coming from a dense (n=5e6 cm-3,n(h2)&gt;1e22 cm-2) layer of molecular gas around the uc hii. based on ouro-h2-18o observations, we estimate an o-h2o abundance of ~2e-8. this is theaverage ortho-water abundance in the pdr. additional h2-18o and/or water linesare required to derive the water abundance profile. a lower density envelope(n~1e5 cm-3, n(h2)=2-5e22 cm-2) is responsible for the absorption in the nh1_1-0_2 line. the emission of the ch ground state triplet is coming from bothregions with a complex and self-absorbed profile in the main component. theradiative transfer modeling shows that the 13co and hco+ line profiles areconsistent with an expansion of the molecular gas with a velocity law, v_e =0.5x (r/rout)^{-1} km/s, although the expansion velocity is poorly constrained bythe observations presented here.

1007.4957	the origin of the [c ii] emission in the s140 pdrs - new insights from  hifi	using herschel's hifi instrument we have observed [c ii] along a cut throughs140 and high-j transitions of co and hco+ at two positions on the cut,corresponding to the externally irradiated ionization front and the embeddedmassive star forming core irs1. the hifi data were combined with availableground-based observations and modeled using the kosma-tau model for photondominated regions. here we derive the physical conditions in s140 and inparticular the origin of [c ii] emission around irs1. we identify threedistinct regions of [c ii] emission from the cut, one close to the embeddedsource irs1, one associated with the ionization front and one further into thecloud. the line emission can be understood in terms of a clumpy model ofphoton-dominated regions. at the position of irs1, we identify at least twodistinct components contributing to the [c ii] emission, one of them a small,hot component, which can possibly be identified with the irradiated outflowwalls. this is consistent with the fact that the [c ii] peak at irs1 coincideswith shocked h2 emission at the edges of the outflow cavity. we note thatpreviously available observations of irs1 can be well reproduced by asingle-component kosma-tau model. thus it is hifi's unprecedented spatial andspectral resolution, as well as its sensitivity which has allowed us to uncoveran additional hot gas component in the s140 region.

1111.4320	giant molecular clouds in the local group galaxy m33	we present an analysis of the systematic co(2-1) survey at 12" resolutioncovering most of the local group spiral m 33 which, at a distance of 840 kpc,is close enough that individual giant molecular clouds (gmcs) can beidentified. the goal of this work is to study the properties of the gmcs inthis subsolar metallicity galaxy. the cprops (cloud properties) algorithm(rosolowsky &amp; leroy 2006) was used to identify 337 gmcs in m 33, the largestsample to date in an external galaxy. the sample is used to study the gmcluminosity function, or mass spectrum under the assumption of a constantn(h2)/ico ratio. we find that n(l)dl = k*l^(-2.0\pm0.1) for the entire sample.however, when the sample is divided into inner and outer disk samples, theexponent changes from 1.6 \pm 0.2 for the centre 2 kpc to 2.3 \pm 0.2 forgalactocentric distances larger than 2 kpc. based on the emission in the fuv,halpha, 8mu, and 24mu bands, each cloud was classified in terms of its starforming activity - no star formation, embedded, or exposed star formation(visible in fuv and halpha). at least one sixth of the clouds had no (massive)star formation, suggesting that the average time required for star formation tostart is about one sixth of the total time for which the object is identifiableas a gmc. the clouds without star formation have significantly lower columinosities than those with star formation, whether embedded or exposed,presumably related to the lack of heating sources. taking the cloud sample as awhole, the main non-trivial correlation was the decrease in cloud co brightness(or luminosity) with galactocentric radius. the complete cloud catalog,including co and hi spectra and the co contours on the fuv, halpha, 8mu, and24mu images is presented in the appendix.

1201.2558	dust and gas power-spectrum in m33 (herm33es)	power spectra of de-projected images of late-type galaxies in gas and/or dustemission are very useful diagnostics of the dynamics and stability of theirinterstellar medium. previous studies have shown that the power spectra can beapproximated as two power-laws, a shallow one at large scales (larger than 500pc) and a steeper one at small scales, with the break between the twocorresponding to the line-of-sight thickness of the galaxy disk. we present athorough analysis of the power spectra of the dust and gas emission at severalwavelengths in the nearby galaxy m33. in particular, we use the recentlyobtained images at five wavelengths by pacs and spire onboard herschel. thelarge dynamical range (2-3 dex in scale) of most images allow us to determineclearly the change in slopes from -1.5 to -4, with some variations withwavelength. the break scale is increasing with wavelength, from 100 pc at 24and 100micron to 350 pc at 500micron, suggesting that the cool dust lies in athicker disk than the warm dust, may be due to star formation more confined tothe plane. the slope at small scale tends to be steeper at longer wavelength,meaning that the warmer dust is more concentrated in clumps. numericalsimulations of an isolated late-type galaxy, rich in gas and with no bulge,like m33, are carried out, in order to better interpret these observed results.varying the star formation and feedback parameters, it is possible to obtain arange of power-spectra, with two power-law slopes and breaks, which nicelybracket the data. the small-scale power-law is indeed reflecting the 3dbehaviour of the gas layer, steepening strongly while the feedback smoothes thestructures, by increasing the gas turbulence. m33 appears to correspond to afiducial model with an sfr of $\sim$ 0.7 mo/yr, with 10% supernovae energycoupled to the gas kinematics.

0711.1320	clumpy photon-dominated regions in carina. i. [ci] and mid-j co lines in  two 4'x4' fields	the carina region is an excellent astrophysical laboratory for studying thefeedback mechanisms of newly born, very massive stars within their natal giantmolecular clouds (gmcs) at only 2.35 kpc distance. we use a clumpy pdr model toanalyse the observed intensities of atomic carbon and co and to derive theexcitation conditions of the gas. the nanten2-4m submillimeter telescope wasused to map the [ci] 3p1-3p0, 3p2-3p1 and co 4-3, 7-6 lines in two 4'x4'regions of carina where molecular material interfaces with radiation from themassive star clusters. one region is the northern molecular cloud near thecompact ob cluster tr14, and the second region is in the molecular cloud southof etacar and tr16. these data were combined with 13co sest spectra, hires/iras60um and 100um maps of the fir continuum, and maps of 8um irac/spitzer and msxemission. we used the hires far-infrared dust data to create a map of the fuvfield heating the gas. the northern region shows an fuv field of a few 1000 indraine units while the field of the southern region is about a factor 10weaker. we constructed models consisting of an ensemble of small sphericallysymmetric pdr clumps within the 38" beam (0.43pc), which follow canonicalpower-law mass and mass-size distributions. we find that an average local clumpdensity of 2x10**5 cm-3 is needed to reproduce the observed line emission attwo selected interface positions. stationary, clumpy pdr models reproduce theobserved cooling lines of atomic carbon and co at two positions in the carinanebula.

1207.3243	spectrally resolved cii emission in m~33 ({\tt herm33es}): physical  conditions and kinematics around bclmp 691	this work presents high spectral resolution observations of the \cii\ line at158 \micron, one of the major cooling lines of the interstellar medium, takenwith the hifi heterodyne spectrometer on the herschel satellite. in bclmp 691,an \hii\ region far north (3.3 kpc) in the disk of m 33, the \cii\ and co lineprofiles show similar velocities within $0.5 \kms$, while the \hi\ linevelocities are systematically shifted towards lower rotation velocities by$\sim 5\kms$. observed at the same $12"$ angular resolution, the \cii\ linesare broader than those of co by about 50% but narrower than the \hi\ lines. the\cii\ line to far-infrared continuum ratio suggests a photoelectric heatingefficiency of 1.1%. the data, together with published models indicate a uvfield $g_0 \sim 100$ in units of the solar neighborhood value, a gas density$n_h \sim 1000 \cc$, and a gas temperature $t\sim 200$ k. adopting thesevalues, we estimate the c$^+$ column density to be $n_{c^+} \approx 1.3 \times10^{17} \cmt$. the \cii\ emission comes predominantly from the warm neutralregion between the \hii\ region and the cool molecular cloud behind it. frompublished abundances, the inferred c$^+$ column corresponds to a hydrogencolumn density of $n_h \sim 2 \times 10^{21} \cmt$. the co observations suggestthat $n_h = 2 n_{h_2} \sim 3.2 \times 10^{21} \cmt$ and 21cm measurements, alsoat $12"$ resolution, yield $n_\hi \approx 1.2 \times 10^{21} \cmt$ within the\cii\ velocity range. thus, some h$_2$ not detected in co must be present, inagreement with earlier findings based on the spire 250 -- 500 $\mu$m emission.

1209.0476	the impact of interactions, bars, bulges, and agn on star formation  efficiency in local massive galaxies	using observations from the gass and cold gass surveys and complementary datafrom sdss and galex, we investigate the nature of variations in gas depletiontime observed across the local massive galaxy population. the large andunbiased cold gass sample allows us to assess the relative importance of galaxyinteractions, bar instabilities, morphologies and the presence of agn inregulating star formation efficiency. both the h2 mass fraction and depletiontime vary as a function of the distance of a galaxy from the main sequence inthe sfr-m* plane. the longest gas depletion times are found in below-mainsequence bulge-dominated galaxies that are either gas-poor, or else on averageless efficient than disk-dominated galaxy at converting into stars any cold gasthey may have. we find no link between agn and these long depletion times. thegalaxies undergoing mergers or showing signs of morphological disruptions havethe shortest molecular gas depletion times, while those hosting strong stellarbars have only marginally higher global star formation efficiencies as comparedto matched control samples. our interpretation is that depletion timevariations are caused by changes in the ratio between the gas mass traced bythe co(1-0) observations, and the gas mass in high density star-forming cores,with interactions, mergers and bar instabilities able to locally increasepressure and raise the ratio of efficiently star-forming gas to co-detectedgas. building a sample representative of the local massive galaxy population,we derive a global kennicutt-schmidt relation of slope 1.18+/-0.24, and observestructure within the scatter around this relation, with galaxies having low(high) stellar mass surface densities lying systematically above (below) themean relation, suggesting that gas surface density is not the only parameterdriving the global star formation ability of a galaxy.

1210.3263	dense gas in m33 (herm33es)	we aim to better understand the emission of molecular tracers of the diffuseand dense gas in giant molecular clouds and the influence that metallicity,optical extinction, density, far-uv field, and star formation rate have onthese tracers. using the iram 30m telescope, we detected hcn, hco+, 12co, and13co in six gmcs along the major axis of m33 at a resolution of ~ 114pc and outto a radial distance of 3.4kpc. optical, far-infrared, and submillimeter datafrom herschel and other observatories complement these observations. tointerpret the observed molecular line emission, we created two grids of modelsof photon-dominated regions, one for solar and one for m33-type subsolarmetallicity. the observed hco+/hcn line ratios range between 1.1 and 2.5.similarly high ratios have been observed in the large magellanic cloud. thehcn/co ratio varies between 0.4% and 2.9% in the disk of m33. the 12co/13coline ratio varies between 9 and 15 similar to variations found in the diffusegas and the centers of gmcs of the milky way. stacking of all spectra allowedhnc and c2h to be detected. the resulting hco+/hnc and hcn/hnc ratios of ~ 8and 6, respectively, lie at the high end of ratios observed in a large set of(ultra-)luminous infrared galaxies. hcn abundances are lower in the subsolarmetallicity pdr models, while hco+ abundances are enhanced. for hcn this effectis more pronounced at low optical extinctions. the observed hco+/hcn and hcn/coline ratios are naturally explained by subsolar pdr models of low opticalextinctions between 4 and 10 mag and of moderate densities of n = 3x10^3 -3x10^4 cm^-3, while the fuv field strength only has a small effect on themodeled line ratios. the line ratios are almost equally well reproduced by thesolar-metallicity models, indicating that variations in metallicity only play aminor role in influencing these line ratios.

1211.6659	evidence for co shock excitation in ngc 6240 from herschel spire  spectroscopy	we present herschel spire fts spectroscopy of the nearby luminous infraredgalaxy ngc 6240. in total 20 lines are detected, including co j=4-3 throughj=13-12, 6 h2o rotational lines, and [ci] and [nii] fine-structure lines. theco to continuum luminosity ratio is 10 times higher in ngc 6240 than mrk 231.although the co ladders of ngc 6240 and mrk 231 are very similar, uv and/orx-ray irradiation are unlikely to be responsible for the excitation of the gasin ngc 6240. we applied both c and j shock models to the h2 v=1-0 s(1) andv=2-1 s(1) lines and the co rotational ladder. the co ladder is best reproducedby a model with shock velocity v_s=10 km s^-1 and a pre-shock density n_h=5 *10^4 cm^-3. we find that the solution best fitting the h2 lines is degenerate:the shock velocities and number densities range between v_s = 17 - 47 km s^-1and n_h=10^7 - 5 * 10^4 cm^-3, respectively. the h2 lines thus need a much morepowerful shock than the co lines. we deduce that most of the gas is currentlymoderately stirred up by slow (10 km s^-1) shocks while only a small fraction(&lt; 1 percent) of the ism is exposed to the high velocity shocks. this impliesthat the gas is rapidly loosing its highly turbulent motions. we argue that ahigh co line-to-continuum ratio is a key diagnostic for the presence of shocks.

1310.4155	variation in the dust emissivity index across m33 with herschel and  spitzer (herm33es)	we study the wavelength dependence of the dust emission as a function ofposition and environment across the disk of m33 at a linear resolution of 160pc using spitzer and herschel photometric data. expressing the emissivity ofthe dust as a power law, the power-law exponent (beta) is estimated from twoindependent approaches designed to properly treat the degeneracy between betaand the dust temperature. both beta and the dust temperature are higher in theinner disk than in the outer disk, contrary to reported beta-tanti-correlations found in other sources. in the cold + warm dust model, thewarm component and the ionized gas (halpha) have a very similar distributionacross the galaxy, demonstrating that the model separates the components in anappropriate fashion. the flocculent spiral arms and the dust lanes are evidentin the map of the cold component. both cold and warm dust column densities arehigh in star forming regions and reach their maxima toward the giant starforming complexes ngc604 and ngc595. beta declines from close to 2 in thecenter to about 1.3 in the outer disk. beta is positively correlated with starformation and with molecular gas column, as traced by halpha and co emission.the lower dust emissivity index in the outer parts of m33 is likely related tothe reduced metallicity (different grain composition) and possibly differentsize distribution. it is not due to the decrease in stellar radiation field ortemperature in a simple way because the fir-bright regions in the outer diskalso have a low beta. like most spirals, m33 has a (decreasing) radial gradientin star formation and molecular-to-atomic gas ratio such that the regionsbright in halpha or co tend to trace the inner disk, making it difficult todistinguish between their effects on the dust.

1310.6237	first observation of the thermal sunyaev-zel'dovich effect with kinetic  inductance detectors	clusters of galaxies provide valuable information on the evolution of theuniverse and large scale structures. recent cluster observations via thethermal sunyaev-zel'dovich (tsz) effect have proven to be a powerful tool todetect and study them. in this context, high resolution tsz observations (~tens of arcsec) are of particular interest to probe intermediate and highredshift clusters. observations of the tsz effect will be carried out with themillimeter dual-band nika2 camera, based on kinetic inductance detectors (kids)to be installed at the iram 30-meter telescope in 2015. to demonstrate thepotential of such an instrument, we present tsz observations with the nikacamera prototype, consisting of two arrays of 132 and 224 detectors thatobserve at 140 and 240 ghz with a 18.5 and 12.5 arcsec angular resolution,respectively. the cluster rx j1347.5-1145 was observed simultaneously at 140and 240 ghz. we used a spectral decorrelation technique to remove theatmospheric noise and obtain a map of the cluster at 140 ghz. the efficiency ofthis procedure has been characterized through realistic simulations of theobservations. the observed 140 ghz map presents a decrement at the clusterposition consistent with the tsz nature of the signal. we used this map tostudy the pressure distribution of the cluster by fitting a gnfw model to thedata. subtracting this model from the map, we confirm that rx j1347.5-1145 isan ongoing merger, which confirms and complements previous tsz and x-rayobservations. for the first time, we demonstrate the tsz capability of kidbased instruments. the nika2 camera with ~ 5000 detectors and a 6.5 arcminfield of view will be well-suited for in-depth studies of the intra clustermedium in intermediate to high redshifts, which enables the characterization ofrecently detected clusters by the planck satellite.

0802.1929	submillimeter line emission from lmc n159w: a dense, clumpy pdr in a low  metallicity environment	star formation at earlier cosmological times takes place in an interstellarmedium with low metallicity. the large magellanic cloud (lmc) is ideally suitedto study star formation in such an environment. the physical and chemical stateof the ism in a star forming environment can be constrained by observations ofsubmm and fir spectral lines of the main carbon carrying species, co, ci andcii, which originate in the surface layers of molecular clouds illuminated bythe uv radiation of the newly formed, young stars. we present high-angularresolution sub-millimeter observations in the n159w region in the lmc obtainedwith the nanten2 telescope of the 12co j = 4-3, j = 7-6, and 13co j = 4-3rotational and [ci] 3p1-3p0 and 3p2-3p1 fine-structure transitions. the 13co j=4-3 and [ci] 3p2-3p1 transitions are detected for the first time in the lmc.we derive the physical and chemical properties of the low-metallicity moleculargas using an escape probability code and a self-consistent solution of thechemistry and thermal balance of the gas in the framework of a clumpy cloud pdrmodel. the separate excitation analysis of the submm co lines and the carbonfine structure lines shows that the emitting gas in the n159w region hastemperatures of about 80 k and densities of about 10^4 cm^-3. the estimated cto co abundance ratio close to unity is substantially higher than in densemassive star-forming regions in the milky way. the analysis of all observedlines together, including the [cii] line intensity reported in the literature,in the context of a clumpy cloud pdr model constrains the uv intensity to about\chi ~220 and an average density of the clump ensemble of about 10^5 cm^-3,thus confirming the presence of high density material in the lmc n159w region.

1402.4668	the heating of mid-infrared dust in the nearby galaxy m33: a testbed for  tracing galaxy evolution	because the 8 {\mu}m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) emission has beenfound to correlate with other well-known star formation tracers, it has widelybeen used as a star formation rate (sfr) tracer. there are, however, studiesthat challenge the accuracy and reliability of the 8 {\mu}m emission as a sfrtracer. our study, part of the herschel m33 extended survey (herm33es) opentime key program, aims at addressing this issue by analyzing the infraredemission from the nearby spiral galaxy m33 at the high spatial scale of 75 pc.combining data from the herschel space observatory and the spitzer spacetelescope we find that the 8 {\mu}m emission is better correlated with the 250{\mu}m emission, which traces cold interstellar gas, than with the 24 {\mu}memission. the l(8)/l(24) ratio is highly depressed in 24 {\mu}m luminousregions, which correlate with known hii regions. we also compare our resultswith the dust emission models by draine &amp; li (2007). we confirm that thedepression of 8 {\mu}m pah emission near star-forming regions is higher thanwhat is predicted by models; this is possibly an effect of increased stellarradiation from young stars destroying the dust grains responsible for the 8{\mu}m emission as already suggested by other authors. we find that themajority of the 8 {\mu}m emission is fully consistent with heating by thediffuse interstellar medium, similar to what recently determined for the dustemission in m31 by draine at al. (2013). we also find that the fraction of 8{\mu}m emission associated with the diffuse interstellar radiation field rangesbetween 60% and 80% and is 40% larger than the diffuse fraction at 24 {\mu}m.

1403.1763	chemistry in isolation: high cch/hco+ line ratio in the amiga galaxy cig  638	multi-molecule observations towards an increasing variety of galaxies havebeen showing that the relative molecular abundances are affected by the type ofactivity. however, these studies are biased towards bright active galaxies,which are typically in interaction. we study the molecular composition of oneof the most isolated galaxies in the local universe where the physical andchemical properties of their molecular clouds have been determined by intrinsicmechanisms. we present 3 mm broad band observations of the galaxy cig 638,extracted from the amiga sample of isolated galaxies. the emission of the j=1-0transitions of cch, hcn, hco+, and hnc are detected. integrated intensityratios between these line are compared with similar observations from theliterature towards active galaxies including starburst galaxies (sb), activegalactic nuclei (agn), luminous infrared galaxies (lirg), and gmcs in m33. asignificantly high ratio of cch with respect to hcn, hco+, and hnc is foundtowards cig 638 when compared with all other galaxies where these species havebeen detected. this points to either an overabundance of cch or to a relativelack of dense molecular gas as supported by the low hcn/co ratio, or both. thedata suggest that the cig 638 is naturally a less perturbed galaxy where alower fraction of dense molecular gas, as well as a more even distributioncould explain the measured ratios. in this scenario the dense gas tracers wouldbe naturally dimmer, while the uv enhanced cch, would be overproduced in a lessshielded medium.

1502.01347	measuring star formation with resolved observations: the test case of  m33	context. measuring star formation at a local scale is important to constrainstar formation laws. yet, it is not clear whether and how the measure of starformation is affected by the spatial scale at which a galaxy is observed. aims.we want to understand the impact of the resolution on the determination of thespatially resolved star formation rate (sfr) and other directly associatedphysical parameters such as the attenuation. methods. we have carried out amulti-scale, pixel-by-pixel study of the nearby galaxy m33. assembling fuv,halpha, 8, 24, 70, and 100 micron maps, we have systematically compared theemission in individual bands with various sfr estimators from a resolution of33 pc to 2084 pc. results. we have found that there are strong,scale-dependent, discrepancies up to a factor 3 between monochromatic sfrestimators and halpha+24 micron. the scaling factors between individual irbands and the sfr show a strong dependence on the spatial scale and on theintensity of star formation. finally, strong variations of the differentialreddening between the nebular emission and the stellar continuum are seen,depending on the specific sfr (ssfr) and on the resolution. at the finestspatial scales, there is little differential reddening at high ssfr. thedifferential reddening increases with decreasing ssfr. at the coarsest spatialscales the differential reddening is compatible with the canonical value foundfor starburst galaxies. conclusions. our results confirm that monochromaticestimators of the sfr are unreliable at scales smaller than 1 kpc. furthermore,the extension of local calibrations to high redshift galaxies presentsnon-trivial challenges as the properties of these systems may be poorly known.

1512.00904	velocity resolved [cii] spectroscopy of the center and the bclmp302  region of m33 (herm33es)	we aim to understand the contribution of the ionized, atomic and molecularphases of the ism to the [cii] emission from clouds near the dynamical centerand the bclmp302 hii region in the north of the nearby galaxy m33 at a spatialresolution of 50pc. we combine high resolution [cii] spectra taken with thehifi spectrometer onboard the herschel satellite with [cii] herschel-pacs mapsand ground-based observations of co(2-1) and hi. all data are at a commonspatial resolution of 50pc. typically, the [cii] lines have widths intermediatebetween the narrower co(2-1) and broader hi line profiles. we decomposed the[cii] spectra in terms of contribution from molecular and atomic gas detectedin co(2-1) and hi, respectively. we find that the relative contribution ofmolecular and atomic gas traced by co(2-1) and hi varies depends mostly on thelocal physical conditions and geometry. we estimate that 11-60% and 5-34% ofthe [cii] intensities in the center and in bclmp302, respectively, arise atvelocities showing no co(2-1) or hi emission and could arise in co-darkmolecular gas. the deduced strong variation in the [cii] emission notassociated with co and hi cannot be explained in terms of differences in a_v,far-ultraviolet radiation field, and metallicity between the two studiedregions. hence the relative amounts of diffuse (co-dark) and dense moleculargas possibly vary on spatial scales smaller than 50pc. based on the emissionmeasure observed at radio wavelengths we estimate the contribution of ionizedgas at a few positions to lie between 10-25%. the correlations between theintensities of tracers corresponding to the same velocity range as [cii],differ from the correlation derived from pacs data. the results in this paperemphasize the need for velocity-resolved observations to discern thecontribution of different components of the ism to [cii] emission.

(1999) from the nir colors of background giant stars.the ridge shows dust extinctions above ~10mag, rising up to 35mag in the cores.  a map of dust temperatures, constructed from the continuum flux ratios, showssignificant temperature gradients: we find temperatures of up to ~20k in theoutskirts and between the cores, and down to ~10k in the cores themselves. thecores themselves are almost isothermal. we used the extinction data to derivein addition a map of the dust emissivity. its average value agrees well withthe canonical value of mathis (1990). we find that the dust emissivityparametrized by kappa_850/kappa_v increases by a factor of about 4 when thedust temperature decreases from ~20k to ~12k. a monte carlo simulation showsthat this change is significant with regard to the estimated calibrationuncertainties. this is consistent with models of dust evolution in prestellarcores by ossenkopf &amp; henning (1994) and with the previous detection ofgas-phase depletion of co in one of the ic5146 cores by kramer et al. 1999.

astro-ph;0312146	the carbon content in the galactic cygnusx/dr21 star forming region	observations of carbon bearing species are among the most importantdiagnostic probes of ongoing star formation. co is a surrogate for h$_2$ and isfound in the vicinity of star formation sites. there, [ci] emission is thoughtto outline the dense molecular cores and extend into the lower density regions,where the impinging interstellar uv radiation field plays a critical role forthe dissociation and ionization processes. emission of ionized carbon ([cii])is found to be even more extended than [ci] and is linking up with the ionizedmedium. these different tracers emphasize the importance of multi-wavelengthstudies to draw a coherent picture of the processes driving and driven by highmass star formation. until now, large scale surveys were only done with lowresolution, such as the cobe full sky survey, or were biased to a few selectedbright sources (e.g. yamamoto et al. 2001, schneider et al. 2003). a broaderbasis of unbiased, high-resolution observations of [ci], co, and [cii] may playa key role to probe the material processed by uv radiation.

astro-ph;0406141	emission of co, ci, and cii in w3main	we used the kosma 3m telescope to map the core 7'x5' of the galactic massivestar forming region w3main in the two fine structure lines of atomic carbon andfour mid-j transitions of co and 13co. the maps are centered on the luminousinfrared source irs5 for which we obtained iso/lws data comprising four high-jco transitions, cii, and oi at 63 and 145 micron. in combination with a kao mapof integrated line intensities of cii (howe et al. 1991), this data set allowsto study the physical structure of the molecular cloud interface regions wherethe occurence of carbon is believed to change from c+ to c0, and to co. themolecular gas in w3main is warmed by the far ultraviolet (fuv) field created bymore than a dozen ob stars. detailed modelling shows that most of the observedline intensity ratios and absolute intensities are consistent with a clumpyphoton dominated region (pdr) of a few hundred unresolved clumps per 0.84pcbeam, filling between 3 and 9% of the volume, with a typical clump radius of0.025pc (2.2"), and typical mass of 0.44msun. the high-excitation lines of costem from a 100-200k layer, as also the ci lines. the bulk of the gas mass ishowever at lower temperatures.

astro-ph;0406510	the giant molecular cloud associated with rcw 106 -- a 1.2 mm continuum  mapping study	we have mapped the dust continuum emission from the molecular cloud coveringa region of 28pcx94pc associated with the well-known hii region rcw 106 at 1.2mm using simba on sest. the observations, having an hpbw of 24" (0.4 pc),reveal 95 clumps. owing to the higher sensitivity to colder dust and higherangular resolution the present observations identify new emission features andalso show that most of the iras sources in this region consist of multiple dustemission peaks. the detected millimeter sources (mms) include on one end theexotic mms5 (associated with iras 16183-4958, one of the brightest infraredsources in our galaxy) and the bright (and presumably cold) source mms54, withno iras or msx associations on the other end. around 10% of the sources areassociated with signposts of high mass star formation activity. assuming auniform dust temperature of 20 k we estimate the total mass of the gmcassociated with rcw 106 to be ~10^5\msun. the constituent millimeter clumpscover a range of masses and radii between 40 to 10^4 \msun and 0.3 to 1.9 pc.densities of the clumps range between (0.5-6) 10^4 cm^{-3}. we have decomposedthe continuum emission into gaussian and arbitrary shaped clumps using the twoindependent structure analysis tools gaussclumps and clumpfind respectively.the clump mass spectrum was found to have an index of 1.6+-0.3, independent ofthe decomposition algorithm used. the index of the mass spectrum for the massand length scales covered here are consistent with results derived from largescale co observations.

astro-ph;0505627	photon dominated regions in the spiral arms of m83 and m51	we present ci 3p1-3p0 spectra at four spiral arm positions and the nuclei ofthe nearby galaxies m83 and m51 obtained at the jcmt. this data is complementedwith maps of co 1-0, 2-1, and 3-2, and iso/lws far-infrared data of cii (158micron), oi (63 micron), and nii (122 micron) allowing for the investigation ofa complete set of all major gas cooling lines. from the intensity of the niiline, we estimate that between 15% and 30% of the observed cii emissionoriginate from the dense ionized phase of the ism. the analysis indicates thatemission from the diffuse ionized medium is negligible. in combination with thefir dust continuum, we find gas heating efficiencies below ~0.21% in thenuclei, and between 0.25 and 0.36% at the outer positions. comparison withmodels of photon-dominated regions (pdrs) of kaufman et al. (1999) with thestandard ratios oi(63)/cii_pdr and (oi(63)+cii_pdr) vs. tir, the total infraredintensity, yields two solutions. the physically most plausible solutionexhibits slightly lower densities and higher fuv fields than found when using afull set of line ratios, cii_pdr/ci(1-0), ci(1-0)/co(3-2), co(3-2)/co(1-0),cii/co(3-2), and, oi(63)/cii_pdr. the best fits to the latter ratios yielddensities of 10^4 cm^-3 and fuv fields of ~g_0=20-30 times the averageinterstellar field without much variation. at the outer positions, the observedtotal infrared intensities are in perfect agreement with the derived bestfitting fuv intensities. the ratio of the two intensities lies at 4-5 at thenuclei, indicating the presence of other mechanisms heating the dust.

astro-ph;0601650	a kosma 7 deg^2 13co 2--1 &amp; 12co 3--2 survey of the perseus cloud	characterizing the spatial and velocity structure of molecular clouds is afirst step towards a better understanding of interstellar turbulence and itslink to star formation. we present observations and structure analysis resultsfor a large-scale (~ 7.10 deg^2) 13co j = 2--1 and 12 co j = 3--2 surveytowards the nearby perseus molecular cloud observed with the kosma 3mtelescope. we study the spatial structure of line-integrated and velocitychannel maps, measuring the $\delta$-variance as a function of size scale. wedetermine the spectral index $\beta$ of the corresponding power spectrum andstudy its variation across the cloud and across the lines. we find that thespectra of all co line-integrated maps of the whole complex show the sameindex, $\beta$ ~ 3.1, for scales between about 0.2 and 3pc, independent ofisotopomer and rotational transition. a complementary 2mass map of opticalextinction shows a noticeably smaller index of 2.6. in contrast to the overallregion, the co maps of individual subregions show a significant variation of$\beta$. the 12co 3--2 data provide e.g. a spread of indices between 2.9 inl1455 and 3.5 in ngc1333. in general, active star forming regions show a largerpower-law exponent. we find that the $\delta$-variance spectra of individualvelocity channel maps are very sensitive to optical depth effects clearlyindicating self-absorption in the densest regions. when studying the dependenceof the channel-map spectra as a function of the velocity channel width, theexpected systematic increase of the spectral index with channel width is onlydetected in the blue line wings.this could be explained by a filamentary,pillar-like structure which is left at low velocities while the overallmolecular gas is swept up by a supernova shock wave.

astro-ph;0606268	study of photon dominated regions in cepheus b	aim: the aim of the paper is to understand the emission from the photondominated regions in cepheus b, estimate the column densities of neutral carbonin bulk of the gas in cepheus b and to derive constraints on the factors whichdetermine the abundance of neutral carbon relative to co. methods: this paperpresents 15'x15' fully sampled maps of ci at 492 ghz and 12co 4-3 observed withkosma at 1' resolution. the new observations have been combined with the fcrao12co 1-0, iram-30m 13co 2-1 and c18o 1-0 data, and far-infrared continuum datafrom hires/iras. the kosma-tau spherical pdr model has been used to understandthe ci and co emission from the pdrs in cepheus b and to explain the observedvariation of the relative abundances of both c^0 and co. results: the emissionfrom the pdr associated with cepheus b is primarily at v_lsr between -14 and-11 km s^-1. we estimate about 23% of the observed cii emission from themolecular hotspot is due to the ionized gas in the hii region. over bulk of thematerial the c^0 column density does not change significantly, (2.0+-1.4)x10^17cm^-2, although the co column density changes by an order of magnitude. theobserved \cbyco abundance ratio varies between 0.06 and 4 in cepheus b. we findan anti-correlation of the observed c/co abundance ratio with the observedhydrogen column density, which holds even when all previous observationsproviding c/co ratios are included. here we show that this observed variationof c/co abundance with total column density can be explained only by clumpypdrs consisting of an ensemble of clumps. at high h2 column densities high massclumps, which exhibit low c/co abundance, dominate, while at low columndensities, low mass clumps with high c/co abundance dominate.

astro-ph;0609559	the cooling of atomic and molecular gas in dr21	we present an overview of a high-mass star formation region through the major(sub-)mm, and far-infrared cooling lines to gain insight into the physicalconditions and the energy budget of the molecular cloud. we used the kosma 3mtelescope to map the core ($10'\times 14'$) of the galactic star forming regiondr 21/dr 21 (oh) in the cygnus x region in the two fine structure lines ofatomic carbon ci and four mid-$j$ transitions of co and $^{13}$co, and cs$j=7\to6$. these observations have been combined with fcrao $j=1\to0$observations of $^{13}$co and c$^{18}$o. five positions, including dr21, dr21(oh), and dr21 fir1, were observed with the iso/lws grating spectrometer in the\oi 63 and 145 $\mu$m lines, the \cii 158 $\mu$m line, and four high-$j$ colines. we discuss the intensities and line ratios at these positions and applylocal thermal equilibrium (lte) and non-lte analysis methods in order to derivephysical parameters such as masses, densities and temperatures. the co lineemission has been modeled up to j=20. from non-lte modeling of the low- tohigh-$j$ co lines we identify two gas components, a cold one at temperatures oft$_\rm{kin}\sim 30-40$ k, and one with t$_\rm{kin}\sim 80-150$ k at a localclump density of about n(h$_2$)$\sim 10^4-10^6$ cm$^{-3}$. while the coldquiescent component is massive containing typically more than 94 % of the mass,the warm, dense, and turbulent gas is dominated by mid- and high-$j$ co lineemission and its large line widths. the medium must be clumpy with avolume-filling of a few percent. the co lines are found to be important for thecooling of the cold molecular gas, e.g. at dr21 (oh). near the outflow of theuv-heated source dr21, the gas cooling is dominated by line emission of atomicoxygen and of co.

astro-ph;0609670	a complete 12co 2-1 map of m51 with hera: i. radial averages of co, hi,  and radio continuum	the mechanisms governing the star formation rate in spiral galaxies are notyet clear. the nearby, almost face-on, and interacting galaxy m51 offers anexcellent opportunity to study at high spatial resolutions the local starformation laws. in this first paper, we investigate the correlation of h2, hi,and total gas surface densities with the star forming activity, derived fromthe radio continuum (rc), along radial averages out to radii of 12kpc.  we have created a complete map of m51 in 12co 2-1 at a resolution of 450kpcusing hera at the iram-30m telescope. these data are combined with maps of hiand the radio-continuum at 20cm wavelength. the latter is used to estimate thestar formation rate (sfr), thus allowing to study the star formation efficiencyand the local schmidt law. the velocity dispersion from co is used to study thecritical surface density and the gravitational stability of the disk.  the critical gas velocity dispersions needed to stabilize the gas againstgravitational collapse in the differentially rotating disk of m51 using thetoomre criterion, vary with radius between 1.7 and 6.8 km/s. observed radiallyaveraged dispersions derived from the co data vary between 28 km/s in thecenter and 8 km/s at radii of 7 to 9 kpc. they exceed the critical dispersionsby factors q_gas of 1 to 5. we speculate that the gravitational potential ofstars leads to a critically stable disk.
