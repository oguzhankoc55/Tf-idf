0906.1073	a joint spectro-imaging analysis of the xmm-newton and hess observations  of the supernova remnant rx j1713.7-3946	the supernova remnant (snr) rx j1713.7-3946 (also known as g347.3-0.5) ispart of the class of remnants dominated by synchrotron emission in x-rays. itis also one of the few shell-type snrs observed at tev energies allowing toinvestigate particle acceleration at snrs shock.  our goal is to compare spatial and spectral properties of the remnant in x-and gamma-rays to understand the nature of the tev emission. this requires tostudy the remnant at the same spatial scale at both energies. to complement thenon-thermal spectrum of the remnant, we attempt to provide a reliable estimatefor the radio flux density. in radio, we revisited atca data and used hi andmid-infrared observations to disentangle the thermal from the non-thermalemission. in x-rays, we produced a new mosaic of the remnant and degraded thespatial resolution of the x-ray data to the resolution of the hess instrumentto perform spatially resolved spectroscopy at the same spatial scale in x- andgamma-rays. radial profiles were obtained to investigate the extension of theemission at both energies.  we found that part of the radio emission within the snr contours is thermalin nature. taking this into account, we provide new lower and upper limits forthe integrated synchrotron flux of the remnant at 1.4 ghz of 22 jy and 26 jyrespectively. in x-rays, we obtained the first full coverage of rx j1713.7-3946with xmm-newton. the spatial variation of the photon index seen at small scalein x-rays is smeared out at hess resolution. a non-linear correlation betweenthe x- and gamma-ray fluxes of the type fx \propto fg^2.41 is found.

0911.1912	localising the vhe gamma-ray source at the galactic centre	the inner 10 pc of our galaxy contains many counterpart candidates of thevery high energy (vhe; &gt; 100 gev) gamma-ray point source hess j1745-290. withinthe point spread function of the h.e.s.s. measurement, at least three objectsare capable of accelerating particles to very high energies and beyond, and ofproviding the observed gamma-ray flux. previous attempts to address this sourceconfusion were hampered by the fact that the projected distances between thoseobjects were of the order of the error circle radius of the emission centroid(34", dominated by the pointing uncertainty of the h.e.s.s. instrument). herewe present h.e.s.s. data of the galactic centre region, recorded with animproved control of the instrument pointing compared to h.e.s.s. standardpointing procedures. stars observed during gamma-ray observations by opticalguiding cameras mounted on each h.e.s.s. telescope are used for off-linepointing calibration, thereby decreasing the systematic pointing uncertaintiesfrom 20" to 6" per axis. the position of hess j1745-290 is obtained by fittinga multi-gaussian profile to the background-subtracted gamma-ray count map. aspatial comparison of the best-fit position of hess j1745-290 with the positionand morphology of candidate counterparts is performed. the position is, withina total error circle radius of 13", coincident with the position of thesupermassive black hole sgr a* and the recently discovered pulsar wind nebulacandidate g359.95-0.04. it is significantly displaced from the centroid of thesupernova remnant sgr a east, excluding this object with high probability asthe dominant source of the vhe gamma-ray emission.

1004.2124	first detection of vhe gamma-rays from sn 1006 by h.e.s.s	recent theoretical predictions of the lowest very high energy (vhe)luminosity of sn 1006 are only a factor 5 below the previously publishedh.e.s.s. upper limit, thus motivating further in-depth observations of thissource. deep observations at vhe energies (above 100 gev) were carried out withthe high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) of cherenkov telescopes from2003 to 2008. more than 100 hours of data have been collected and subjected toan improved analysis procedure. observations resulted in the detection of vhegamma-rays from sn 1006. the measured gamma-ray spectrum is compatible with apower-law, the flux is of the order of 1% of that detected from the crabnebula, and is thus consistent with the previously established h.e.s.s. upperlimit. the source exhibits a bipolar morphology, which is strongly correlatedwith non-thermal x-rays. because the thickness of the vhe-shell is compatiblewith emission from a thin rim, particle acceleration in shock waves is likelyto be the origin of the gamma-ray signal. the measured flux level can beaccounted for by inverse compton emission, but a mixed scenario that includesleptonic and hadronic components and takes into account the ambient matterdensity inferred from observations also leads to a satisfactory description ofthe multi-wavelength spectrum.

0709.0956	the gas density around sn 1006	the density of the ambient medium where the supernova remnant evolves is arelevant parameter for its hydrodynamical evolution, for the mechanism ofparticle acceleration, and for the emission at tev energies. using xmm-newtonx-ray observations, we present a study of the ambient medium density of thehistorical supernova remnant sn 1006. we modelled the post-shock thermalemission to constrain the ambient medium density. our study is focused on thenorth-west and the south-east rims of the remnant, where the thermal emissiondominates. we used a plane-parallel shock plasma model plus another componentfor the ejecta that are not negligible in the regions of our study. theimportance of the synchrotron component is also studied. in order to improvestatistics, we combined several observations of the remnant.  the density found in the south-east rim is low, roughly 0.05 cm-3, and seemsto be representative of the rest of the remnant. however, in the north-west rim(close to the bright optical filament), the density is significantly higher(about 0.15-0.25 cm-3). this confirms a picture of sn 1006 evolving in atenuous ambient medium, except in the north-west where the remnant has recentlyencountered a denser region.  a density this low is compatible with the non-detection of the remnant by thehess gamma-ray observatory. the lower density in the south-east implies ahigher shock speed of 4900 km/s, higher than that of 2890 km/s measured in thenorth-west. this new estimate of the velocity could increase the maximum energythat accelerated particles can reach to energies of about 1 pev.

1111.3331	simultaneous multi-wavelength campaign on pks 2005-489 in a high state	the high-frequency peaked bl lac object pks 2005-489 was the target of amulti-wavelength campaign with simultaneous observations in the tev gamma-ray(h.e.s.s.), gev gamma-ray (fermi/lat), x-ray (rxte, swift), uv (swift) andoptical (atom, swift) bands. this campaign was carried out during a high fluxstate in the synchrotron regime. the flux in the optical and x-ray bandsreached the level of the historical maxima. the hard gev spectrum observed withfermi/lat connects well to the very high energy (vhe, e&gt;100gev) spectrummeasured with h.e.s.s. with a peak energy between ~5 and 500 gev. compared toobservations with contemporaneous coverage in the vhe and x-ray bands in 2004,the x-ray flux was ~50 times higher during the 2009 campaign while the tevgamma-ray flux shows marginal variation over the years. the spectral energydistribution during this multi-wavelength campaign was fit by a one zonesynchrotron self-compton model with a well determined cutoff in x-rays. theparameters of a one zone ssc model are inconsistent with variability timescales. the variability behaviour over years with the large changes insynchrotron emission and small changes in the inverse compton emission does notwarrant an interpretation within a one-zone ssc model despite an apparentlysatisfying fit to the broadband data in 2009.

1204.5690	h.e.s.s. observations of the carina nebula and its enigmatic colliding  wind binary eta carinae	the massive binary system eta carinae and the surrounding hii complex, thecarina nebula, are potential particle acceleration sites from whichvery-high-energy (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) \gamma-ray emission could be expected. thispaper presents data collected during vhe \gamma-ray observations with theh.e.s.s. telescope array from 2004 to 2010, which cover a full orbit of etacarinae. in the 33.1-hour data set no hint of significant \gamma-ray emissionfrom eta carinae has been found and an upper limit on the \gamma-ray flux of7.7 x 10-13 ph cm-2 s-1 (99% confidence level) is derived above the energythreshold of 470 gev. together with the detection of high-energy (he; 0.1 gev &gt;e &gt; 100 gev) \gamma-ray emission by the fermi-lat up to 100 gev, and assuming acontinuation of the average he spectral index into the vhe domain, theseresults imply a cut-off in the \gamma-ray spectrum between the he and vhe\gamma-ray range. this could be caused either by a cut-off in the acceleratedparticle distribution or by severe \gamma-\gamma\ absorption losses in the windcollision region. furthermore, the search for extended \gamma-ray emission fromthe carina nebula resulted in an upper limit on the \gamma-ray flux of 4.2 x10-12 ph cm-2 s-1 (99% confidence level). the derived upper limit of ~23 on thecosmic-ray enhancement factor is compared with results found for the old-agemixed-morphology supernova remnant w 28.

1209.0582	gamma-ray signatures of cosmic ray acceleration, propagation, and  confinement in the era of cta	galactic cosmic rays are commonly believed to be accelerated at supernovaremnants via diffusive shock acceleration. despite the popularity of this idea,a conclusive proof for its validity is still missing. gamma-ray astronomyprovides us with a powerful tool to tackle this problem, because gamma rays areproduced during cosmic ray interactions with the ambient gas. the detection ofgamma rays from several supernova remnants is encouraging, but still does notconstitute a proof of the scenario, the main problem being the difficulty indisentangling the hadronic and leptonic contributions to the emission. oncereleased by their sources, cosmic rays diffuse in the interstellar medium, andfinally escape from the galaxy. the diffuse gamma-ray emission from thegalactic disk, as well as the gamma-ray emission detected from a few galaxiesis largely due to the interactions of cosmic rays in the interstellar medium.on much larger scales, cosmic rays are also expected to permeate theintracluster medium, since they can be confined and accumulated within clustersof galaxies for cosmological times. thus, the detection of gamma rays fromclusters of galaxies, or even upper limits on their emission, will allow us toconstrain the cosmic ray output of the sources they contain, such as normalgalaxies, agns, and cosmological shocks. in this paper, we describe the impactthat the cherenkov telescope array, a future ground-based facility forvery-high energy gamma-ray astronomy, is expected to have in this field ofresearch.

1303.1628	discovery of tev gamma-ray emission from pks 0447-439 and derivation of  an upper limit on its redshift	very high-energy gamma-ray emission from pks 0447-439 was detected with theh.e.s.s. cherenkov telescope array in december 2009. this blazar is one of thebrightest extragalactic objects in the fermi bright source list and has a hardspectrum in the mev to gev range. in the tev range, a photon index of 3.89 +-0.37 (stat) +- 0.22 (sys) and a flux normalisation at 1 tev, phi(1 tev) = (3.5+- 1.1 (stat) +- 0.9 (sys)) x 10^{-13} cm^{-2} s^{-1} tev^{-1}, were found. thedetection with h.e.s.s. triggered observations in the x-ray band with the swiftand rxte telescopes. simultaneous uv and optical data from swift uvot and datafrom the optical telescopes atom and rotse are also available. the spectrum andlight curve measured with h.e.s.s. are presented and compared to themulti-wavelength data at lower energies. a rapid flare is seen in the swift xrtand rxte data, together with a flux variation in the uv band, at a time scaleof the order of one day. a firm upper limit of z &lt; 0.59 on the redshift of pks0447-439 is derived from the combined fermi-lat and h.e.s.s. data, given theassumptions that there is no upturn in the intrinsic spectrum above thefermi-lat energy range and that absorption on the extragalactic backgroundlight (ebl) is not weaker than the lower limit provided by current models. thespectral energy distribution is well described by a simple one-zone synchrotronself-compton (ssc) scenario, if the redshift of the source is less than z &lt;~0.4.

1506.02307	study of tev shell supernova remnants at gamma-ray energies	the breakthrough developments of cherenkov telescopes in the last decade haveled to angular resolution of 0.1{\deg} and an unprecedented sensitivity. thishas allowed the current generation of cherenkov telescopes to discover apopulation of supernova remnants (snrs) radiating in very-high-energy (vhe,e&gt;100 gev) gamma-rays. a number of those vhe snrs exhibit a shell-typemorphology spatially coincident with the shock front of the snr. the members ofthis vhe shell snr club are rx j1713.7-3946, vela jr, rcw 86, sn 1006, and hessj1731-347. the latter two objects have been poorly studied in high-energy (he,0.1&lt;e&lt;100 gev) gamma-rays and need to be investigated in order to draw theglobal picture of this class of snrs and constrain the characteristics of theunderlying population of accelerated particles. using 6 years of fermi p7reprocessed data, we studied the he counterpart of the snrs hess j1731-347 andsn 1006. the two snrs are not detected in the data and given that there is nohint of detection, we do not expect any detection in the coming years from thesnrs. however in both cases, we derived upper limits that significantlyconstrain the gamma-ray emission mechanism and can rule out a standard hadronicscenario with a confidence level &gt; 5 sigma. with this fermi analysis, we nowhave a complete view of the he to vhe gamma-ray emission of tev shell snrs. allfive sources have a hard he photon index (&lt;1.8) suggesting a common scenariowhere the bulk of the emission is produced by accelerated electrons radiatingfrom radio to vhe gamma-rays through synchrotron and inverse compton processes.in addition when correcting for the distance, all snrs show a surprisinglysimilar gamma-ray luminosity supporting the idea of a common emissionmechanism. while the gamma-ray emission is likely to be leptonic dominated,this does not rule out efficient hadron acceleration in those snrs.

1507.03633	the first fermi-lat snr catalog snr and cosmic ray implications	galactic cosmic ray (crs) sources, classically proposed to be supernovaremnants (snrs), must meet the energetic particle content required by directmeasurements of high energy crs. indirect gamma-ray measurements of snrs withthe fermi large area telescope (lat) have now shown directly that at leastthree snrs accelerate protons. with the first fermi lat snr catalog, we havesystematically characterized the gev gamma-rays emitted by 279 snrs knownprimarily from radio surveys. we present these sources in a multiwavelengthcontext, including studies of correlations between gev and radio size, flux,and index, tev index, and age and environment tracers, in order to betterunderstand effects of evolution and environment on the gev emission. we showthat previously sufficient models of snrs' gev emission no longer adequatelydescribe the data. to address the question of cr origins, we also examine thesnrs' maximal cr contribution assuming the gev emission arises solely fromproton interactions. improved breadth and quality of multiwavelength data,including distances and local densities, and more, higher resolution gamma-raydata with correspondingly improved galactic diffuse models will strengthen thisconstraint.
