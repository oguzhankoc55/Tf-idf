0902.0363	aegis: the clustering of x-ray agn relative to galaxies at z~1	we measure the clustering of non-quasar x-ray agn at z=0.7-1.4 in the aegisfield. using the cross-correlation of 113 chandra-selected agn, with a medianlog l_x=42.8 erg s^-1, with ~5,000 deep2 galaxies, we find that the x-ray agnare fit by a power law with a clustering scale length of r_0=5.95 +/-0.90 h^-1mpc and slope gamma=1.66 +/-0.22. x-ray agn have a similar clustering amplitudeas red, quiescent and `green' transition galaxies at z~1 and are significantlymore clustered than blue, star-forming galaxies. the x-ray agn clusteringstrength is primarily determined by the host galaxy color; agn in red hostgalaxies are significantly more clustered than agn in blue host galaxies, witha relative bias that is similar to that of red to blue deep2 galaxies. wedetect no dependence of clustering on optical brightness, x-ray luminosity, orhardness ratio within the ranges probed here. we find evidence for galaxieshosting x-ray agn to be more clustered than a sample of galaxies with matchingjoint optical color and magnitude distributions. this implies that galaxieshosting x-ray agn are more likely to reside in groups and more massive darkmatter halos than galaxies of the same color and luminosity without an x-rayagn. in comparison to optically-selected quasars in the deep2 fields, we findthat x-ray agn at z~1 are more clustered than optically-selected quasars (witha 2.6-sigma significance) and therefore likely reside in more massive darkmatter halos. our results are consistent with galaxies undergoing a quasarphase while in the blue cloud before settling on the red sequence with alower-luminosity x-ray agn, if they are similar objects at differentevolutionary stages.

0903.3404	understanding the astrophysics of galaxy evolution: the role of  spectroscopic surveys in the next decade	over the last decade optical spectroscopic surveys have characterized the lowredshift galaxy population and uncovered populations of star-forming galaxiesback to z ~ 7. this work has shown that the primary epoch of galaxy buildingand black hole growth occurs at redshifts of 2 to 3. the establishment of theconcordance lcdm cosmology shifted the focus of galaxy population studies fromconstraining cosmological parameters to characterizing the processes whichregulate the formation and evolution of galaxies.in the next decade, highredshift observers will attempt to formulate a coherent evolutionary pictureconnecting galaxies in the high redshift universe to galaxies today. in orderto link galaxy populations at different redshifts, we must not onlycharacterize their evolution in a systematic way, we must establish whichphysical processes are responsible for it. considerable progress has alreadybeen made in understanding how galaxies evolved from z ~ 1 to the present day.large spectroscopic surveys in the near infrared are required to push thesestudies back towards the main epoch of galaxy building. only then will weunderstand the full story of the formation of l* galaxies like our own milkyway. a large near-ir spectroscopic survey will also provide the calibrationneeded to avoid systematics in the large photometric programs proposed to studythe nature of dark matter and dark energy. we provide an outline design for amulti-object 0.4 to 1.8 micron spectrograph, which could be placed on anexisting telescope, and which would allow a full characterization of the galaxypopulation out to z ~ 2. we strongly recommend a serious further study todesign a real instrument, which will be required for galaxy formation studiesto advance to the next frontier.

0706.4089	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: the role of galaxy environment in the  cosmic star-formation history	using galaxy samples drawn from the sloan digital sky survey and the deep2galaxy redshift survey, we study the relationship between star formation andenvironment at z ~ 0.1 and z ~ 1. we estimate the total star-formation rate(sfr) and specific star-formation rate (ssfr) for each galaxy according to themeasured [o ii] nebular line luminosity, corrected using empirical calibrationsto match more robust sfr indicators. echoing previous results, we find that inthe local universe star formation depends on environment such that galaxies inregions of higher overdensity, on average, have lower star-formation rates andlonger star-formation timescales than their counterparts in lower-densityregions. at z ~ 1, we show that the relationship between specific sfr andenvironment mirrors that found locally. however, we discover that therelationship between total sfr and overdensity at z ~ 1 is inverted relative tothe local relation. this observed evolution in the sfr-density relation isdriven, in part, by a population of bright, blue galaxies in dense environmentsat z ~ 1. this population, which lacks a counterpart at z ~ 0, is thought toevolve into members of the red sequence from z ~ 1 to z ~ 0. finally, weconclude that environment does not play a dominant role in the cosmicstar-formation history at z &lt; 1: the dependence of the mean galaxy sfr on localgalaxy density at constant redshift is small compared to the decline in theglobal sfr space density over the last 7 gyr.

0907.1903	groups of galaxies in aegis: the 200 ksec chandra extended x-ray source  catalogue	we present the discovery of seven x-ray emitting groups of galaxies selectedas extended x-ray sources in the 200 ksec chandra coverage of theall-wavelength extended groth strip international survey (aegis). in addition,we report on agn activity associated to these systems. using the deep2 galaxyredshift survey coverage, we identify optical counterparts and determinevelocity dispersions. in particular, we find three massive high-redshift groupsat z&gt;0.7, one of which is at z=1.13, the first x-ray detections ofspectroscopically selected deep2 groups. we also present a first look at thethe l_x-t, l_x-sigma, and sigma-t scaling relations for high-redshift massivegroups. we find that the properties of these x-ray selected systems agree wellwith the scaling relations of similar systems at low redshift, although thereare x-ray undetected groups in the deep2 catalogue with similar velocitydispersions. the other three x-ray groups with identified redshifts areassociated with lower mass groups at z~0.07 and together form part of a largestructure or "supergroup" in the southern portion of the aegis field. all ofthe low-redshift systems are centred on massive elliptical galaxies, and all ofthe high-redshift groups have likely central galaxies or galaxy pairs. all ofthe central group galaxies host x-ray point sources, radio sources, and/or showoptical agn emission. particularly interesting examples of central agn activityinclude a bent-double radio source plus x-ray point source at the center of agroup at z=0.74, extended radio and double x-ray point sources associated tothe central galaxy in the lowest-redshift group at z=0.066, and a bright greenvalley galaxy (part of a pair) in the z=1.13 group which shows optical agnemission lines.

0708.0004	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: color and luminosity dependence of  galaxy clustering at z~1	we present measurements of the color and luminosity dependence of galaxyclustering at z~1 in the deep2 galaxy redshift survey. using volume-limitedsubsamples in bins of both color and luminosity, we find that: 1) theclustering dependence is much stronger with color than with luminosity and isas strong with color at z~1 as is found locally. we find no dependence of theclustering amplitude on color for galaxies on the red sequence, but asignificant dependence on color for galaxies within the blue cloud. 2) forgalaxies in the range l/l*~0.7-2, a stronger large-scale luminosity dependenceis seen for all galaxies than for red and blue galaxies separately. thesmall-scale clustering amplitude depends significantly on luminosity for bluegalaxies, with brighter samples having a stronger rise on scales r_p&lt;0.5 mpc/h.3) redder galaxies exhibit stronger small-scale redshift-space distortions("fingers of god"), and both red and blue populations show large-scaledistortions in xi(r_p,pi) due to coherent infall. 4) while the clusteringlength, r_0, increases smoothly with galaxy color (in narrow bins), itspower-law exponent, gamma, exhibits a sharp jump from the blue cloud to the redsequence. the intermediate color `green' galaxy population likely includestransitional galaxies moving from the blue cloud to the red sequence; on largescales green galaxies are as clustered as red galaxies but show infallkinematics and a small-scale correlation slope akin to the blue galaxypopulation. 5) we compare our results to a semi-analytic galaxy formation modelapplied to the millenium run simulation. differences between the data and themodel suggest that in the model star formation is shut down too efficiently insatellite galaxies.

1007.1967	absence of evidence is not evidence of absence: the color-density  relation at fixed stellar mass persists to z ~ 1	we use data drawn from the deep2 galaxy redshift survey to investigate therelationship between local galaxy density, stellar mass, and rest-frame galaxycolor. at z ~ 0.9, we find that the shape of the stellar mass function at thehigh-mass (log (m*/msun) &gt; 10.1) end depends on the local environment, withhigh-density regions favoring more massive systems. accounting for this stellarmass-environment relation (i.e., working at fixed stellar mass), we find asignificant color-density relation for galaxies with 10.6 &lt; log(m*/msun) &lt; 11.1and 0.75 &lt; z &lt; 0.95. this result is shown to be robust to variations in thesample selection and to extend to even lower masses (down to log(m*/msun) ~10.4). we conclude by discussing our results in comparison to recent works inthe literature, which report no significant correlation between galaxyproperties and environment at fixed stellar mass for the same redshift andstellar mass domain. the non-detection of environmental dependence found inother data sets is largely attributable to their smaller samples size and lowersampling density, as well as systematic effects such as inaccurate redshiftsand biased analysis techniques. ultimately, our results based on deep2 dataillustrate that the evolutionary state of a galaxy at z ~ 1 is not exclusivelydetermined by the stellar mass of the galaxy. instead, we show that localenvironment appears to play a distinct role in the transformation of galaxyproperties at z &gt; 1.

1007.3494	aegis: demographics of x-ray and optically selected agns	we develop a new diagnostic method to classify galaxies into agn hosts,star-forming galaxies, and absorption-dominated galaxies by combining the [oiii]/hbeta ratio with rest-frame u-b color. this can be used to robustly selectagns in galaxy samples at intermediate redshifts (z&lt;1). we compare the resultof this optical agn selection with x-ray selection using a sample of 3150galaxies with 0.3&lt;z&lt;0.8 and i_ab&lt;22, selected from the deep2 galaxy redshiftsurvey and the all-wavelength extended groth strip international survey(aegis). among the 146 x-ray sources in this sample, 58% are classifiedoptically as emission-line agns, the rest as star-forming galaxies orabsorption-dominated galaxies. the latter are also known as "x-ray bright,optically normal galaxies" (xbongs). analysis of the relationship betweenoptical emission lines and x-ray properties shows that the completeness ofoptical agn selection suffers from dependence on the star formation rate andthe quality of observed spectra. it also shows that xbongs do not appear to bea physically distinct population from other x-ray detected, emission-line agns.on the other hand, x-ray agn selection also has strong bias. about 2/3 of allemission-line agns at l_bol&gt;10^44 erg/s in our sample are not detected in our200 ks chandra images, most likely due to moderate or heavy absorption by gasnear the agn. the 2--7 kev detection rate of seyfert 2s at z~0.6 suggests thattheir column density distribution and compton-thick fraction are similar tothat of local seyferts. multiple sample selection techniques are needed toobtain as complete a sample as possible.

1011.3114	local gravity versus local velocity: solutions for $\beta$ and nonlinear  bias	(abridged) we perform a reconstruction of the cosmological large scale flowsin the nearby universe using two complementary observational sets. the first,the sfi++ sample of tully-fisher (tf) measurements of galaxies, provides adirect probe of the flows. the second, the whole sky distribution of galaxiesin the 2mass redshift survey (2mrs), yields a prediction of the flows given thecosmological density parameter, $\omega$, and a biasing relation between massand galaxies. we aim at an unbiased comparison between the peculiar velocityfields extracted from the two data sets and its implication on the cosmologicalparameters and the biasing relation. we expand the fields in a set oforthonormal basis functions, each representing a plausible realization of acosmological velocity field. our analysis completely avoids the strong errorcovariance in the smoothed tf velocities by the use of orthonormal basisfunctions and employs elaborate realistic mock data sets to extensivelycalibrate the errors in 2mrs predicted velocities. we relate the 2mrs galaxydistribution to the mass density field by a linear bias factor, $b$, andinclude a luminosity dependent, $\propto l^\alpha$, galaxy weighting. we assessthe agreement between the fields as a function of $\alpha$ and$\beta=f(\omega)/b$, where $f$ is the growth factor of linear perturbations.the agreement is excellent with a reasonable $\chi^2$ per degree of freedom.for $\alpha=0$, we derive $0.28&lt;\beta&lt;0.37$ and $0.24&lt;\beta&lt;0.43$,respectively, at the 68.3% and 95.4% confidence levels (cls). for $\beta=0.33$,we get $\alpha&lt;0.25$ and $\alpha&lt;0.5$, respectively, at the 68.3% and 95.4%cls. we set a constraint on the fluctuation normalization, finding $\sigma_8 =0.73 \pm 0.1$, in very good agreement with the latest wmap results.

1101.1650	the cosmological bulk flow: consistency with $\lambda$cdm and $z\approx  0$ constraints on $\sigma_8$ and $\gamma$	we derive estimates for the cosmological bulk flow from the sfi++tully-fisher (tf) catalog. for a sphere of radius $40 \hmpc$ centered on themw, we derive a bulk flow of $333 \pm 38\kms $ towards galactic $(l,b)=(276^\circ,14^\circ)$ within a $3^\circ$ $1\sigma$ error. within a $100\hmpc$ we get $ 257\pm 44\kms$ towards $(l,b)=(279^\circ, 10^\circ)$ withina $6^\circ$ error. these directions are at a $40^\circ$ with the supergalacticplane, close to the apex of the motion of the local group of galaxies after thevirgocentric infall correction. our findings are consistent with the$\lambda$cdm model with the latest wmap best fit cosmological parameters. butthe bulk flow allows independent constraints. for wmap inferred hubbleparameter $h=0.71$ and baryonic mean density parameter $\omega_b=0.0449$, theconstraint from the bulk flow on the matter density $\omega_m$, thenormalization of the density fluctuations, $\sigma_8$, and the growth index,$\gamma$, can be expressed as$\sigma_8\omega_m^{\gamma-0.55}(\omega_m/0.266)^{0.28}=0.86\pm 0.11$ (for$\omega_m\approx 0.266$). fixing $\sigma_8=0.8$ and $\omega_m=0.266$ as favoredby wmap, we get $\gamma=0.495\pm 0.096$. the constraint derived here rules outpopular dgp models at more than the 99% confidence level. our results are basedon a method termed \ace\ (all space constrained estimate) which reconstructsthe bulk flow from an all space three dimensional peculiar velocity fieldconstrained to match the tf measurements. at large distances \ace\ generates arobust bulk flow from the sfi++ that is insensitive to the assumed prior. forcomparison, a standard straightforward maximum likelihood estimate leads tovery similar results.

1102.4189	bulk flows from galaxy luminosities: application to 2mass redshift  survey and forecast for next-generation datasets	we present a simple method for measuring cosmological bulk flows from largeredshift surveys, based on the apparent dimming or brightening of galaxies dueto their peculiar motion. it is aimed at estimating bulk flows of cosmologicalvolumes containing large numbers of galaxies. constraints on the bulk flow areobtained by minimizing systematic variations in galaxy luminosities withrespect to a reference luminosity function measured from the whole survey. thismethod offers two advantages over more popular bulk flow estimators: it isindependent of error-prone distance indicators and of the poorly-known galaxybias. we apply the method to the 2mass redshift survey (2mrs) to measure thelocal bulk flows of spherical shells centered on the milky way (mw). the resultis consistent with that obtained by nusser and davis (2011) using the sfi++catalogue of tully-fisher distance indicators.  we also make an assessment of the ability of the method to constrain bulkflows at larger redshifts ($z=0.1-0.5$) from next generation datasets. as acase study we consider the planned euclid survey. using this method we will beable to measure a bulk motion of $ \sim 200 \kms$ of $10^6$ galaxies withphotometric redshifts, at the $3\sigma$ level for both $z\sim 0.15$ and $z\sim0.5$. thus the method will allow us to put strong constraints on dark energymodels as well as alternative theories for structure formation.

1105.3880	autocorrelations of stellar light and mass at z~0 and ~1: from sdss to  deep2	we present measurements of projected autocorrelation functions w_p(r_p) forthe stellar mass of galaxies and for their light in the u, b and v bands, usingdata from the third data release of the deep2 galaxy redshift survey and thefinal data release of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). we investigate theclustering bias of stellar mass and light by comparing these to projectedautocorrelations of dark matter estimated from the millennium simulations (ms)at z=1 and 0.07, the median redshifts of our galaxy samples. all of theautocorrelation and bias functions show systematic trends with spatial scaleand waveband which are impressively similar at the two redshifts. this showsthat the well-established environmental dependence of stellar populations inthe local universe is already in place at z=1. the recent ms-based galaxyformation simulation of guo et al. (2011) reproduces the scale-dependentclustering of luminosity to an accuracy better than 30% in all bands and atboth redshifts, but substantially overpredicts mass autocorrelations atseparations below about 2 mpc. further comparison of the shapes of our stellarmass bias functions with those predicted by the model suggests that both thesdss and deep2 data prefer a fluctuation amplitude of sigma_8 0.8 rather thanthe sigma_8=0.9 assumed by the ms.

1106.6145	a new method for the determination of the growth rate from galaxy  redshift surveys	given a redshift survey of galaxies with measurements of apparent magnitudes,we present a novel method for measuring the growth rate $f(\omega)$ ofcosmological linear perturbations. we use the galaxy distribution within thesurvey to solve for the peculiar velocity field which depends in linearperturbation theory on $\beta=f(\omega)/b$, where $b$ is the bias factor of thegalaxy distribution. the recovered line-of-sight peculiar velocities aresubtracted from the redshifts to derive the distances, which thus allows anestimate of the absolute magnitude of each galaxy. a constraint on $\beta$ isthen found by minimizing the spread of the estimated magnitudes from theirdistribution function. we apply the method to the all sky $k = 11.25$ two-massredhsift survey (2mrs) and derive $\beta=0.35\pm 0.1$ at $z\sim 0$, remarkablyconsistent with our previous estimate from the velocity-velocity comparison.the method could easily be applied to subvolumes extracted from the sdss surveyto derive the growth rate at $z \sim 0.1$. further, it should also beapplicable to ongoing and future spectroscopic redshift surveys to trace theevolution of $f(\omega)$ to $z\sim1$. constraints obtained from this method areentirely independent from those obtained from the two-dimensional distortion of$\xi(s)$ and provide an important check on $f(\omega)$, as alternative gravitymodels predict observable differences.

1203.1625	dependence of galaxy quenching on halo mass and distance from its centre	we study the dependence of star-formation quenching on galaxy mass andenvironment, in the sdss (z~0.1) and the aegis (z~1). it is crucial that wedefine quenching by low star-formation rate rather than by red colour, giventhat one third of the red galaxies are star forming. we address stellar massm*, halo mass mh, density over the nearest n neighbours deltan, and distance tothe halo centre d. the fraction of quenched galaxies appears more stronglycorrelated with mh at fixed m* than with m* at fixed mh, while for satellitesquenching also depends on d. we present the m*-mh relation for centrals at z~1.at z~1, the dependence of quenching on m* at fixed mh is somewhat morepronounced than at z~0, but the quenched fraction is low (10%) and the haloesare less massive. for satellites, m*-dependent quenching is noticeable at highd, suggesting a quenching dependence on sub-halo mass for recently capturedsatellites. at small d, where satellites likely fell in more than a few gyrago, quenching strongly depends on mh, and not on m*. the mh-dependence ofquenching is consistent with theoretical wisdom where virial shock heating inmassive haloes shuts down accretion and triggers ram-pressure stripping,causing quenching. the interpretation of deltan is complicated by the fact thatit depends on the number of observed group members compared to n, motivatingthe use of d as a better measure of local environment.

1203.3192	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: design, observations, data reduction,  and redshifts	we describe the design and data sample from the deep2 galaxy redshift survey,the densest and largest precision-redshift survey of galaxies at z ~ 1completed to date. the survey has conducted a comprehensive census of massivegalaxies, their properties, environments, and large-scale structure down toabsolute magnitude m_b = -20 at z ~ 1 via ~90 nights of observation on thedeimos spectrograph at keck observatory. deep2 covers an area of 2.8 deg^2divided into four separate fields, observed to a limiting apparent magnitude ofr_ab=24.1. objects with z &lt; 0.7 are rejected based on bri photometry in threeof the four deep2 fields, allowing galaxies with z &gt; 0.7 to be targeted ~2.5times more efficiently than in a purely magnitude-limited sample. approximatelysixty percent of eligible targets are chosen for spectroscopy, yielding nearly53,000 spectra and more than 38,000 reliable redshift measurements. most of thetargets which fail to yield secure redshifts are blue objects that lie beyond z~ 1.45. the deimos 1200-line/mm grating used for the survey delivers highspectral resolution (r~6000), accurate and secure redshifts, and uniqueinternal kinematic information. extensive ancillary data are available in thedeep2 fields, particularly in the extended groth strip, which has evolved intoone of the richest multiwavelength regions on the sky. deep2 surpasses otherdeep precision-redshift surveys at z ~ 1 in terms of galaxy numbers, redshiftaccuracy, sample number density, and amount of spectral information. we alsoprovide an overview of the scientific highlights of the deep2 survey thus far.this paper is intended as a handbook for users of the deep2 data release 4,which includes all deep2 spectra and redshifts, as well as for thepublicly-available deep2 deimos data reduction pipelines.

0801.2769	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: the red sequence agn fraction and its  environment and redshift dependence	we measure the dependence of the agn fraction on local environment at z~1,using spectroscopic data taken from the deep2 galaxy redshift survey, andchandra x-ray data from the all-wavelength extended groth strip internationalsurvey (aegis). to provide a clean sample of agn we restrict our analysis tothe red sequence population; this also reduces additional colour-environmentcorrelations. we find evidence that high redshift liners in deep2 tend tofavour higher density environments relative to the red population from whichthey are drawn. in contrast, seyferts and x-ray selected agn at z~1 show little(or no) environmental dependencies within the same underlying population. wecompare these results with a sample of local agn drawn from the sdss. contraryto the high redshift behaviour, we find that both liners and seyferts in thesdss show a slowly declining red sequence agn fraction towards high densityenvironments. interestingly, at z~1 red sequence seyferts and liners areapproximately equally abundant. by z~0, however, the red seyfert population hasdeclined relative to the liner population by over a factor of 7. we speculateon possible interpretations of our results.

1402.6566	on the recovery of local group motion from galaxy redshift surveys	there is a $\sim 150 km s^{-1}$ discrepancy between the measured motion ofthe local group of galaxies (lg) with respect to the cmb and the linear theoryprediction based on the gravitational force field of the large scale structurein full-sky redshift surveys. we perform a variety of tests which show that thelg motion cannot be recovered to better than $150-200 km s^{-1}$ in amplitudeand within a $\approx10^\circ$ in direction. the tests rely on catalogs of mockgalaxies identified in the millennium simulation using semi-analytic galaxyformation models. we compare these results to the $k_s=11.75$ two-mass galaxyredshift survey, which provides the deepest, widest and most complete spatialdistribution of galaxies available so far. in our analysis we use a new,concise relation for deriving the lg motion and bulk flow from the truedistribution of galaxies in redshift space. our results show that the mainsource of uncertainty is the small effective depth of surveys like the 2mrsthat prevents a proper sampling of the large scale structure beyond $\sim100h^{-1} mpc$. deeper redshift surveys are needed to reach the "convergencescale" of $\approx 250 h^{-1}mpc $ in a $\lambda$cdm universe. deeper surveywould also mitigate the impact of the "kaiser rocket" which, in a survey like2mrs, remains a significant source of uncertainty. thanks to the quiet andmoderate density environment of the lg, purely dynamical uncertainties of thelinear predictions are subdominant at the level of $\sim 90 km s^{-1}$.finally, we show that deviations from linear galaxy biasing and shot noiseerrors provide a minor contribution to the total error budget.

0805.0004	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: environments of poststarburst galaxies  at z~0.1 and z~0.8	postststarburst (k+a) galaxies are candidates for galaxies in transition froma star-forming phase to a passively-evolving phase. we have spectroscopicallyidentified large samples of k+a galaxies both in the sdss at z~0.1 and in thedeep2 survey at z~0.8, using a robust selection method based on a cut in hbetaemission rather than the more problematic [oii] 3727. based on measurements ofthe overdensity of galaxies around each object, we find that k+a galaxiesbrighter than 0.4l*_b at low-z have a similar, statistically indistinguishableenvironment distribution as blue galaxies, preferring underdense environments,but dramatically different from that of red galaxies. however, at higher-z, theenvironment distribution of k+a galaxies is more similar to red galaxies thanto blue galaxies. we conclude that the quenching of star formation and thebuild-up of the red sequence through the k+a phase is happening in relativelyoverdense environments at z~1 but in relatively underdense environments at z~0.although the relative environments where quenching occurs are decreasing withtime, the corresponding absolute environment may have stayed the same alongwith the quenching mechanisms, because the mean absolute environments of allgalaxies has to grow with time. in addition, we do not find any significantdependence on luminosity in the environment distribution of k+as. the existenceof a large k+a population in the field at both redshifts indicates thatcluster-specific mechanisms cannot be the dominant route by which thesegalaxies are formed. we also demonstrates that studying k+a-environmentrelations by measuring the k+a fraction in different environments is highlynon-robust. statistical comparisons of the overall environment distributions ofdifferent populations are much better behaved.

astro-ph;0004175	detection of a far ir excess with dirbe at 60 and 100 microns	from analysis of the dirbe weekly averaged sky maps, we have detectedsubstantial flux in the 60 and 100 micron channels in excess of expectedzodiacal and galactic emission. two methods are used to separate zodiacal lightfrom more distant emission. method i makes use of the time-dependence of thenorth-south annual variation observed at the ecliptic poles. this method isrobust against errors in the inter-planetary dust (ipd) model, but does notdemonstrate isotropy of the background. method ii measures the eclipticlatitude dependence of the dust over a range of ecliptic latitudes at solarelongation e=90 degrees. this allows the excess to be determined in each weekof the dirbe mission for high redundancy, but the results depend weakly on theipd model. both methods give consistent results at 60 and 100 microns. theobserved signal is consistent with an isotropic background at the level \nui_\nu = 28.1 +- 1.8 +- 7(syst) nw/m^2/sr at 60 microns and 24.6 +- 2.5 +- 8nw/m^2/sr at 100 microns.  the ir excess detected at 140 and 240 microns by these methods agrees withprevious measurements, which are thought to be the cosmic infra-red background(cib). the detections at 60 and 100 microns are new. while this new excess isnot necessarily the cib, we have ruled out all known sources of emission in thesolar system and galaxy. we therefore tentatively interpret this signal as thecib and consider the implications of such energy production from the viewpointof star formation efficiency and black hole accretion efficiency. however, their excess exceeds limits on the cib derived from the inferred opacity of theigm to observed tev photons, thus casting doubt on this interpretation. thereis currently no satisfactory explanation for the 60-100 micron excess.

astro-ph;0004348	stellar populations and galaxy morphology at high redshift	in this article we investigate the morphology and stellar populations ofhigh-redshift galaxies through multi-waveband hst imaging and ground-basedspatially-resolved spectroscopy. we study the redshift evolution of galaxymorphology in the hubble deep field, using the deep idt-nicmos near-infraredhst imaging coupled with spectroscopic and photometric redshifts. using themulti-waveband data to compare the appearance of galaxies at the samerest-frame wavelengths reveals that "morphological k-corrections" (the changein appearance when viewing high-z objects at shorter rest-frame wavelengths)are only important in a minority of cases, and that galaxies were intrinsicallymore peculiar at high redshift. one example of significant morphologicalk-corrections is spiral galaxies, which often show more pronounced barredstructure in the near-infrared than in the optical. therefore, the apparentdecline in the fraction of barred spirals at faint magnitudes in the opticalhdf may be due to band-shifting effects at the higher redshifts, rather thanintrinsic evolution. using such features as the age-sensitive balmer+4000angbreak, the spatially- resolved colours of distant galaxies inoptical/near-infrared imaging can also be used to study their component stellarpopulations. we supplement this with deep keck/lris spectroscopy of twoextended sources: a chain galaxy at z=2.8 (hdf4-555.1, the "hot dog" - thebrightest u-drop lyman-break galaxy in the hdf) and a pair of z=4.04gravitationally lensed arcs behind the cluster abell 2390. the absence ofmeasurable rotation across the z=2.8 chain galaxy implies that it is unikely tobe a disk viewed edge on. with the resolution enhancement from lensing, wedetect stellar populations of different ages in the z=4 arcs.

astro-ph;0011258	high-redshift galaxy outflows and the formation of dwarf galaxies	we examine the effects of galaxy outflows on the formation of dwarf galaxiesin numerical simulations of the high-redshift universe. using a smoothedparticle hydrodynamic code, we conduct two detailed simulations of a (5.2mpc/h)^3 comoving volume of the universe. in both simulations we implementsimple, well-motivated models of galaxy identification and star formation,while our second simulation also includes a simple ``blow-out'' model of galaxyoutflows in which supernova driven winds from newly formed disk galaxiespunch-out and shock the intergalactic medium while leaving the host galaxiesintact. a direct comparison between these simulations suggests that there aretwo major mechanisms by which outflows affect dwarf formation. firstly, theformation of an outflow slows down the further accretion of gas onto a galaxy,causing an overall decrease of approximately 50% in the total gas mass accretedby the objects in our simulations. additionally, our simulations uncover asignificant population of approximately 10^9 solar mass objects whose formationis suppressed by the mechanism of ``baryonic stripping,'' in which outflowsfrom early galaxies strip the gas out of nearby overdense regions that wouldhave otherwise later formed into dwarf galaxies. this mechanism may beimportant in explaining the observed discrepancy between the number of dwarfgalaxies predicted and observed in the local group and provide a naturalexplanation for the formation of empty halos which may be required by theexistence of the extremely gas-poor extra-galactic high-velocity clouds.

astro-ph;0104418	mining the sky with redshift surveys	since the late 1970's, redshift surveys have been vital for progress inunderstanding large-scale structure in the universe. the original cfa redshiftsurvey collected spectra of 20-30 galaxies per clear night on a 1.5 metertelescope; over a two year period the project added ~2000 new redshifts to theliterature. subsequent low-z redshift surveys have been up to an order ofmagnitude larger, and ongoing surveys will yield a similar improvement over thegeneration preceding them. full sky redshift surveys have a special role toplay as predictors of cosmological flows, and deep pencil beam surveys haveprovided fundamental constraints on the evolution of properties of galaxies.with the 2df redshift survey and the sdss survey, our knowledge of thestatistical clustering of low-redshift galaxies will achieve unprecedentedprecision. measurements of clustering in the distant universe are more limitedat present, but will become much better in this decade as the vlt/virmos andkeck/deimos projects produce results. as in so many other fields, progress inlarge scale structure studies, both observational and theoretical, has beenmade possible by improvements in technologies, especially computing. thisreview briefly highlights twenty years of progress in this evolving disciplineand describes a few novel cosmological tests that will be attempted with thekeck/deimos survey.

astro-ph;0106542	the structure of dark matter halos in an annihilating dark matter model	the inability of standard non-interacting cold dark matter (cdm) to accountfor the small scale structure of individual galaxies has led to the suggestionthat the dark matter may undergo elastic and/or inelastic scattering. wesimulate the evolution of an isolated dark matter halo which undergoes bothscattering and annihilation. annihilations produce a core that grows with timedue to adiabatic expansion of the core as the relativistic annihilationproducts flow out of the core, lessening the binding energy. an effectiveannihilation cross section per unit mass equal to $&gt;.03 cm^2 g^{-1} (100 kms^{-1}/v$) with a scattering cross section per unit mass of .6 cm g$^{-1}$produces a 3 kpc core in a 10$^{10}$ m$_{\sun}$ halo that persists for 100dynamical times. the same cross section leads to a core of only 120 pc in arich cluster. in addition to creating to cores, annihilation should erasestructure on scales below $\sim 3\times10^8$ m$_{\sun}$. annihilating darkmatter provides a mechanism for solving some of the problems of non-interactingcdm, at the expense of introducing a contrived particle physics model.

astro-ph;0107541	galaxy correlation statistics of mock catalogs for the deep2 survey	the deep2 project will obtain redshifts for ~60,000 galaxies betweenz~0.7-1.5 in a comoving volume of 7 10^6 mpc/h^3 for an lcdm universe. thesurvey will map four separate 2 by 0.5 degree strips of the sky. to study theexpected clustering, we have constructed mock galaxy catalogs from the gifvirgo consortium simulations. we present two- and three-point correlationanalyses of these mock galaxy catalogs to test how well we will measure thesestatistics in the presence of selection biases which will limit the surfacedensity of galaxies which we can select for spectroscopy. we find that neitherthe two-point nor three-point correlation functions are significantlycompromised. we will be able to make simple corrections to account for thesmall amount of bias introduced. we quantify the expected redshift distortionsdue to random orbital velocities of galaxies within groups and clusters onsmall scales of ~1 mpc/h using the pairwise velocity dispersion sigma_12 andgalaxy-weighted velocity dispersion sigma_1, which we are able to measurewithin ~10%. we also estimate the expected large-scale coherent infall ofgalaxies due to supercluster formation (``kaiser effect''). from this measurewe will be able to constrain beta to within ~0.1 at z=1. for the deep2 surveywe will combine the correlation statistics with galaxy observables such asspectral type, morphology, absolute luminosity, and linewidth to measure therelative biases in different galaxy types. here we use a counts-in-cellsanalysis to measure sigma_8 as a function of redshift and determine therelative bias between galaxy samples based on absolute luminosity. we expect tomeasure sigma_8 to within 10% and detect the evolution of relative bias withredshift at the 4-5 sigma level.

astro-ph;0109130	measuring the cosmic equation of state with counts of galaxies ii: error  budget for the deep2 redshift survey	in a previous paper, we described a new variant on the classical dn/dz testwhich could be performed using upcoming redshift surveys. by observing thevelocity function of galaxies rather than their luminosity function, it ispossible to avoid many of the uncertainties of galaxy evolution while employinga directly measurable quantity. we previously assumed that counting statisticswould dominate the errors in this method. here, we present the results ofincluding cosmic variance and determine the impact of systematic effects onapplication of this test to the upcoming deep2 redshift survey. for deep2,cosmic variance should yield errors roughly twice those predicted from poissonstatistics. through monte carlo simulations we find that if the functionalform, but not the strength, of any of the major systematic effects (baryonicinfall, velocity errors, and incompleteness) is known, the systematic maysuccessfully be corrected for using the observed velocity function, leaving amuch smaller residual error. the total uncertainty from systematics iscomparable to that from cosmic variance, but correlated amongst redshift bins.we find that deep2 can provide a much more precise measurement of the cosmicequation of state parameter w than any available today, albeit weaker than someother proposed tests.

astro-ph;0109131	measuring the cosmic equation of state with galaxy clusters in the deep2  redshift survey	the abundances of groups and clusters of galaxies are expected to havechanged substantially since high redshift, with the strength of this evolutiondependent upon fundamental cosmological parameters. upcoming large redshiftsurveys of distant galaxies will make it possible to measure these quantitiesat z~1; when combined with the results of local redshift surveys currentlyunderway, the evolution of cluster abundances may be determined. the deep2redshift survey, planned to begin in spring 2002, is particularly well-suitedfor this work because of the high spectroscopic resolution to be used; velocitydispersions of groups will be readily measurable. in this paper, we determinethe constraints on dark energy models that counts of deep2 clusters shouldprovide. we find that comparing cosmological models using the simultaneousdistribution of clusters in both velocity dispersion and redshift yieldssignificantly stronger constraints than the redshift distribution alone. themethod can be made more powerful by employing a value of the fluctuationamplitude sigma_8 determined with upcoming techniques (external to deep2) thathave no omega_m degeneracy. the equation-of-state parameter for dark energymodels, w=p/rho, can then be measured to ~0.1 from observations of clustersalone.

astro-ph;0112370	three-dimensional identification and reconstruction of galaxy systems  within deep redshift surveys	we have developed a new geometrical method for identifying and reconstructinga homogeneous and highly complete set of galaxy groups in the next generationof deep, flux-limited redshift surveys. our method combines information fromthe three-dimensional voronoi diagram and its dual, the delaunay triangulation,to obtain group and cluster catalogs that are remarkably robust over wideranges in redshift and degree of density enhancement. using the mock deep2catalogs, we demonstrate that the vdm algorithm can be used to identify ahomogeneous set of groups in a magnitude-limited sample ($i\sbr{ab}\le23.5$)throughout the survey redshift window $0.7 &lt; z &lt; 1.2$. the actual groupmembership can be effectively reconstructed even in the distorted redshiftspace environment for systems with line of sight velocity dispersion$\sigma_{los}$ greater than $\approx 200$ \kms. by comparing the galaxy clustercatalog derived from the mock deep2 observations to the underlying distributionof clusters found in real space with much fainter galaxies included (whichshould more closely trace mass in the cluster), we can assess completeness invelocity dispersion directly. we conclude that the recovered deep2 group andcluster sample should be statistically complete for $\sigma_{los} \gtrsim 400$\kms. finally, we argue that the reconstructed bivariate distribution ofsystems as a function of redshift and velocity dispersion reproduces with highfidelity the underlying real space distribution and can thus be used robustlyto constrain cosmological parameters

0808.3683	constraints on the star formation histories of galaxies from z~1 to z~0	we present a new method to estimate the average star formation rate per unitstellar mass (ssfr) of a stacked population of galaxies. we combine the spectraof 600-1000 galaxies with similar stellar masses and parameterise the starformation history of this stacked population using a set of exponentiallydeclining functions. the strength of the hydrogen balmer absorption line seriesin the rest-frame wavelength range 3750-4150\aa is used to constrain the ssfrby comparing with a library of models generated using the bc03 stellarpopulation code. our method, based on a principal component analysis (pca), canbe applied in a consistent way to spectra drawn from local galaxy surveys andfrom surveys at $z \sim 1$, and is only weakly influenced by attenuation due todust. we apply our method to galaxy samples drawn from sdss and deep2 to studymass-dependent growth of galaxies from $z \sim 1$ to $z \sim 0$. we find that,(1) high mass galaxies have lower ssfrs than low mass galaxies; (2) the averagessfr has decreased from $z=1$ to $z=0$ by a factor of $\sim 3-4$, independentof galaxy mass. additionally, at $z \sim 1$ our average ssfrs are a factor of$2-2.5$ lower than those derived from multi-wavelength photometry using similardatasets. we then compute the average time (in units of the hubble time,$t_{\rm h}(z)$) needed by galaxies of a given mass to form their stars at theircurrent rate. at both $z=0$ and at $z=1$, this timescale decreases stronglywith stellar mass from values close to unity for galaxies with masses $\sim10^{10} m_{\odot}$, to more than ten for galaxies more massive than $ 10^{11}m_{\odot}$. our results are in good agreement with models in which agn feedbackis more efficient at preventing gas from cooling and forming stars in high massgalaxies.

astro-ph;0409305	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: probing the evolution of dark matter  halos around isolated galaxies at z ~ 1	using the first 25% of deep2 redshift survey data, we probe the line-of-sightvelocity dispersion profile for isolated galaxies with absolute b-bandmagnitude -22&lt;m_b-5log(h)&lt;-21 at z=0.7-1.0, using satellite galaxies asluminous tracers of the underlying velocity distribution. measuring thevelocity dispersion beyond a galactocentric radius of ~200 kpc/h (physical)permits us to determine the total mass, including dark matter, around thesebright galaxies. we find a line-of-sight velocity dispersion (sigma_los) of162^{+44}_{-30} km/s at ~110 kpc/h, 136^{+26}_{-20} km/s at ~230 kpc/h, and150^{+55}_{-38} km/s at ~320 kpc/h. assuming an nfw model for the dark matterdensity profile, this corresponds to a mass within r_{200} ofm_200=5.5^{+2.5}_{-2.0} x 10^12 m_sun/h for our sample of satellite hosts withmean luminosity ~2.5l*. roughly $~60% of these host galaxies have early-typespectra and are red in restframe (u-b) color, consistent with the overall deep2sample in the same luminosity and redshift range. the halo mass determined fordeep2 host galaxies is consistent with that measured in the sloan digital skysurvey for host galaxies within a similar luminosity range relative to m*_b.this comparison is insensitive to the assumed halo mass profile, and implies anincrease in the dynamical mass-to-light ratio (m_200/l_b) of isolated galaxieswhich host satellites by a factor of ~2.5 from z ~ 1 to z ~ 0. our results areconsistent with scenarios in which galaxies populate dark matter halossimilarly from z ~ 0 to z ~ 1, except for ~1 magnitude of evolution in theluminosity of all galaxies.

astro-ph;0410721	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: first results on galaxy groups	we use the first 25% of the deep2 galaxy redshift survey spectroscopic datato identify groups and clusters of galaxies in redshift space. the data setcontains 8370 galaxies with confirmed redshifts in the range 0.7 &lt;= z &lt;= 1.4,over one square degree on the sky. groups are identified using an algorithm(the voronoi-delaunay method) that has been shown to accurately reproduce thestatistics of groups in simulated deep2-like samples. we optimize thisalgorithm for the deep2 survey by applying it to realistic mock galaxy catalogsand assessing the results using a stringent set of criteria for measuringgroup-finding success, which we develop and describe in detail here. we find inparticular that the group-finder can successfully identify ~78% of real groupsand that ~79% of the galaxies that are true members of groups can be identifiedas such. conversely, we estimate that ~55% of the groups we find can bedefinitively identified with real groups and that ~46% of the galaxies we placeinto groups are interloper field galaxies. most importantly, we find that it ispossible to measure the distribution of groups in redshift and velocitydispersion, n(sigma,z), to an accuracy limited by cosmic variance, fordispersions greater than 350km/s. we anticipate that such measurements willallow strong constraints to be placed on the equation of state of the darkenergy in the future. finally, we present the first deep2 group catalog, whichassigns 32% of the galaxies to 899 distinct groups with two or more members,153 of which have velocity dispersions above 350km/s. we provide locations,redshifts and properties for this high-dispersion subsample. this catalogrepresents the largest sample to date of spectroscopically detected groups atz~1.

astro-ph;0506518	measuring galaxy environments with deep redshift surveys	we study the applicability of several galaxy environment measures(n^th-nearest-neighbor distance, counts in an aperture, and voronoi volume)within deep redshift surveys. mock galaxy catalogs are employed to mimicrepresentative photometric and spectroscopic surveys at high redshift (z ~ 1).we investigate the effects of survey edges, redshift precision, redshift-spacedistortions, and target selection upon each environment measure. we find thateven optimistic photometric redshift errors (\sigma_z = 0.02) smear out theline-of-sight galaxy distribution irretrievably on small scales; thissignificantly limits the application of photometric redshift surveys toenvironment studies. edges and holes in a survey field dramatically affect theestimation of environment, with the impact of edge effects depending upon theadopted environment measure. these edge effects considerably limit theusefulness of smaller survey fields (e.g. the goods fields) for studies ofgalaxy environment. in even the poorest groups and clusters, redshift-spacedistortions limit the effectiveness of each environment statistic; measuringdensity in projection (e.g. using counts in a cylindrical aperture or aprojected n^th-nearest-neighbor distance measure) significantly improves theaccuracy of measures in such over-dense environments. for the deep2 galaxyredshift survey, we conclude that among the environment estimators tested theprojected n^th-nearest-neighbor distance measure provides the most accurateestimate of local galaxy density over a continuous and broad range of scales.

astro-ph;0508250	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: the evolution of void statistics from  z~1 to z~0	we present measurements of the void probability function (vpf) at z~1 usingdata from the deep2 redshift survey and its evolution to z~0 using data fromthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss). we measure the vpf as a function of galaxycolor and luminosity in both surveys and find that it mimics trends displayedin the two-point correlation function, $\xi$; namely that samples of brighter,red galaxies have larger voids (i.e. are more strongly clustered) than fainter,blue galaxies. we also clearly detect evolution in the vpf with cosmic time,with voids being larger in comoving units at z~0. we find that the reduced vpfmatches the predictions of a `negative binomial' model for galaxies of allcolors, luminosities, and redshifts studied. this model lacks a physicalmotivation, but produces a simple analytic prediction for sources of any numberdensity and integrated two-point correlation function, \bar{\xi}. this impliesthat differences in the vpf across different galaxy populations are consistentwith being due entirely to differences in the population number density and\bar{\xi}. the robust result that all galaxy populations follow the negativebinomial model appears to be due to primarily to the clustering of dark matterhalos. the reduced vpf is insensitive to changes in the parameters of the halooccupation distribution, in the sense that halo models with the same \bar{\xi}will produce the same vpf. for the wide range of galaxies studied, the vpftherefore does not appear to provide useful constraints on galaxy evolutionmodels that cannot be gleaned from studies of \bar{\xi} alone.

astro-ph;0512233	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: clustering of galaxies as a function  of luminosity at z=1	we measure the clustering of deep2 galaxies at z=1 as a function ofluminosity on scales 0.1 mpc/h to 20 mpc/h. drawing from a parent catalog of25,000 galaxies at 0.7&lt;z&lt;1.3 in the full deep2 survey, we create volume-limitedsamples having upper luminosity limits between m_b=-19 and m_b=-20.5, roughly0.2-1 l^* at z=1. we find that brighter galaxies are more strongly clusteredthan fainter galaxies and that the slope of the correlation function does notdepend on luminosity for l&lt;l^*. the brightest galaxies, with l&gt;l^*, have asteeper slope. the clustering scale-length, r_0, varies from 3.69 +/-0.14 forthe faintest sample to 4.43 +/-0.14 for the brightest sample. the relative biasof galaxies as a function of l/l^* is steeper than the relation found locallyfor sdss galaxies (zehavi et al. 2005) over the luminosity range that wesample. the absolute bias of galaxies at z=1 is scale-dependent on scales r_p&lt;1mpc/h, and rises most significantly on small scales for the brightest samples.for a concordance cosmology, the large-scale bias varies from 1.26 +/-0.04 to1.54 +/-0.05 as a function of luminosity and implies that deep2 galaxies residein dark matter halos with a minimum mass of ~1-3 10^12 h^-1 m_sun.

astro-ph;0512446	on the origin of [oii] emission in red sequence and post-starburst  galaxies	we investigate the emission-line properties of galaxies with red rest-framecolors using spectra from sdss dr4. emission lines are detected in more thanhalf of the red galaxies. we focus on the relationship between two emissionlines commonly used as star formation rate indicators: ha 6563 and [oii] 3727.there is a strong bimodality in [oii]/ha ratio in the full sdss sample whichclosely corresponds to the bimodality in rest-frame color. nearly all of theline-emitting red galaxies have line ratios typical of various types of agn --most commonly liners, a small fraction of transition objects and, more rarely,seyferts. only ~6% of red galaxies display star-forming line ratios. a straightline in the [oii]-ha equivalent width plane separates liner-like galaxies fromother categories. quiescent galaxies with no detectable emission lines andliner-like galaxies combine to form a single, tight red sequence incolor-magnitude-concentration space. [oii] ews in liner- and agn-like galaxiescan be as large as in star-forming galaxies. thus, unless objects withagn/liner-like line ratios are excluded, [oii] emission cannot be used directlyas a proxy for star formation rate. lack of [oii] emission is generally used toindicate lack of star formation when post-starburst galaxies are selected athigh redshift. our results imply, however, that these samples have been cut onagn properties as well as star formation, and therefore may provide seriouslyincomplete sets of post-starburst galaxies. furthermore, post-starburstgalaxies identifed in sdss by requiring minimal ha ew generally exhibit weakbut nonzero line emission with ratios typical of agns; few of them showresidual star formation. this suggests that most post-starbursts may harboragns/liners.

astro-ph;0603177	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: the relationship between galaxy  properties and environment at z ~ 1	we study the mean environment of galaxies in the deep2 galaxy redshift surveyas a function of rest-frame color, luminosity, and [oii] equivalent width. thelocal galaxy overdensity for &gt;14,000 galaxies at 0.75 &lt; z &lt; 1.35 is estimatedusing the projected 3rd-nearest-neighbor surface density. of the galaxyproperties studied, mean environment is found to depend most strongly on galaxycolor; all major features of the correlation between mean overdensity andrest-frame color observed in the local universe were already in place at z ~ 1.in contrast to local results, we find a substantial slope in the meandependence of environment on luminosity for blue, star-forming galaxies at z ~1, with brighter blue galaxies being found on average in regions of greateroverdensity. we discuss the roles of galaxy clusters and groups in establishingthe observed correlations between environment and galaxy properties at highredshift, and we also explore the evidence for a ``downsizing of quenching''from z ~ 1 to z ~ 0. our results add weight to existing evidence that themechanism(s) that result in star-formation quenching are efficient in groupenvironments as well as clusters. this work is the first of its kind at highredshift and represents the first in a series of papers addressing the role ofenvironment in galaxy formation at 0 &lt; z &lt; 1.

astro-ph;0607204	evolution in the halo masses of isolated galaxies between z~1 and z~0:  from deep2 to sdss	we measure the evolution in the virial mass-to-light ratio (m_{200}/l_b) andvirial-to-stellar mass ratio (m_{200}/m_\ast) for isolated ~ l* galaxiesbetween z~1 and z~0 by combining data from the deep2 galaxy redshift survey andthe sloan digital sky survey. utilizing the motions of satellite galaxiesaround isolated galaxies, we measure line-of-sight velocity dispersions andderive dark matter halo virial masses for these host galaxies. at both epochsthe velocity dispersion of satellites correlates with host galaxy stellar mass,\sigma\propto m_\ast^{0.4+/-0.1}, while the relation between satellite velocitydispersion and host galaxy b-band luminosity may grow somewhat shallower from\sigma\propto l_b^{0.6+/-0.1} at z~1 to \sigma\propto l_b^{0.4+/-0.1} at z~0.the evolution in m_200/m_\ast from z~1 to z~0 displays a bimodality insofar ashost galaxies with stellar mass below m_\ast ~10^{11} m_sun/h maintain aconstant ratio (the intrinsic increase is constrained to a factor of 1.1+/-0.7)while host galaxies above m_\ast ~10^{11} m_sun/h experience a factor of 4+/-3increase in their virial-to-stellar mass ratio. this result can be easilyunderstood if galaxies below this stellar mass scale continue to form starswhile star formation in galaxies above this scale is quenched and the darkmatter halos of galaxies both above and below this scale grow in accordancewith lcdm cosmological simulations. host galaxies that are red in u-b colorhave larger satellite dispersions and hence reside on average in more massivehalos than blue galaxies at both z~1 and z~0. the redshift and host galaxystellar mass dependence of m_200/m_\ast agrees qualitatively with themillennium run semi-analytic model of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0608569	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: the evolution of the blue fraction in  groups and the field	we explore the behavior of the blue galaxy fraction over the redshift range0.75 &lt;= z &lt;= 1.3 in the deep2 survey, both for field galaxies and for galaxiesin groups. the primary aim is to determine the role that groups play in drivingthe evolution of galaxy colour at high z. the colour segregation observedbetween local group and field samples is already in place at z ~ 1: deep2groups have a significantly lower blue fraction than the field. at fixed z,there is also a correlation between blue fraction and galaxy magnitude, suchthat brighter galaxies are more likely to be red, both in groups and in thefield. in addition, there is a negative correlation between blue fraction andgroup richness. in terms of evolution, the blue fraction in groups and thefield remains roughly constant from z=0.75 to z ~ 1, but beyond this redshiftthe blue fraction in groups rises rapidly with z, and the group and field bluefractions become indistinguishable at z ~ 1.3. careful tests indicate that thiseffect does not arise from known systematic or selection effects. to furtherensure the robustness of this result, we build on previous mock deep2catalogues to develop mock catalogues that reproduce the colour-overdensityrelation observed in deep2 and use these to test our methods. the convergencebetween the group and field blue fractions at z ~ 1.3 implies that deep2 galaxygroups only became efficient at quenching star formation at z ~ 2; this resultis broadly consistent with other recent observations and with current models ofgalaxy evolution and hierarchical structure growth.

astro-ph;9308013	clustering in the 1.2 jy iras galaxy redshift survey ii: redshift  distortions and \xi(r_p,\pi)	we examine the effect of redshift space distortions on the galaxy two-pointcorrelation function $\xi(r_p,\pi)$ as a function of separations parallel($r_p$) and perpendicular ($\pi$) to the line of sight. we find that therelative velocity dispersion of pairs of iras galaxies is $\sigma(r)=317^{+40}_{-49}$ \kms at $r=1 \mpc$, consistent with previous estimates derivedfrom optically selected galaxy catalogues. unfortunately, the use of thisresult to estimate $\omega$ via the cosmic virial theorem is thwarted by largesystematic uncertainties. we also fit for the mean relative streaming velocityof pairs, $v_{12}(r)$, which describes the growth of fluctuations on bothlinear and nonlinear scales. we find that $v_{12}(r) = 167^{+99}_{-67}$ \kms at$r=4$\mpc, so that on average, approximately half the hubble expansion velocityof pairs at this separation is canceled by infall. at $r=10$\mpc, the amplitudeof the streaming is lower and $v_{12}(r) = 109^{+64}_{-47} \kms$. linearperturbation theory then implies that $\omega^{0.6}/b =0.45^{+0.27}_{-0.18}$ onscales $\sim 10-15 \mpc$. the amplitude of $v_{12}(r)$ is sensitive to theassumed shape of $\sigma(r)$; if the latter deviates substantially from avirialized form on small scale, our best fit amplitude of $v_{12}(r)$ candeviate by a factor of two.

astro-ph;9309009	on the prediction of velocity fields from redshift space galaxy samples	we present a new method for recovering the underlying velocity field from anobserved distribution of galaxies in redshift space. the method is based on akinematic zel'dovich relation between the velocity and density fields inredshift space. this relation is expressed in a differential equation slightlymodified from the usual poisson equation, and which depends non-trivially on$\beta \equiv \omega^{0.6}/b$. the linear equation can be readily solved bystandard techniques of separation of variables by means of spherical harmonics.one can also include a term describing the ``rocket effect" discussed by kaiser(1987). from this redshift space information alone, one can generate aprediction of the peculiar velocity field for each harmonic ($l,m$) as afunction of distance. we note that for the quadrupole and higher order moments,the equation is a boundary value problem with solutions dependent on both theinterior and exterior mass distribution. however, for a shell at distance $r$,the dipole, as well as the monopole, of the velocity field in the local groupframe is fully determined by the interior mass distribution. this implies thatthe shear of the measured velocity field, when fit to a dipole distortion,should be aligned and consistent with the gravity field inferred from the welldetermined local galaxy distribution. as a preliminary application we computethe velocity dipole of distant shells as predicted from the 1.2jy iras surveycompared to the measured velocity dipole on shells, as inferred from a recentpotent analysis. the coherence between the two fields is good, yielding a bestestimate of $\beta= 0.6 \pm 0.2$.

astro-ph;9401008	the origin of the magellanic stream	shortened abstract: we present numerical investigations designed tocritically test models of the origin of the magellanic stream. the mostdeveloped model is the tidal model which fails to reproduce several of itscharacteristic properties. we suggest an alternative model for the origin ofthe stream which can explain all of its observed features and dynamics, as wellas provide a strong constraint on the distribution of gas within the halo ofthe milky way. we propose that the stream consists of material which wasram-pressure stripped from the magellanic system during its last passagethrough an extended ionized disk of the galaxy. this collision took place some500 million years ago at a galacto-centric distance of about 65 kpc, and swept$\sim 20$\% of the least bound hi into the stream. the gas with the lowestcolumn density lost the most orbital angular momentum, and is presently at thetip of the stream, having fallen to a distance of $\sim 20$ kpc from the milkyway attaining a negative velocity of 200 \kms. to prevent the stripped materialfrom leading the magellanic clouds and attaining too large an infall velocity,we postulate the existence of an extended dilute halo of diffuse ionized gassurrounding the milky way. if the halo gas is at the virial temperature of thepotential well of the milky way, its thermal emission would contribute $\sim$40\% of the observed diffuse background radiation in the 0.5-1.0 kev (m) band,consistent with recent rosat measurements as well as pulsar dispersionmeasures. ram pressure stripping

astro-ph;9407100	estimation of peculiar velocity from the inverse tully-fisher relation	we present a method for deriving a smoothed estimate of the peculiar velocityfield of a set of galaxies with measured circular velocities $\eta\equiv {\rmlog} \delta v$ and apparent magnitudes $m$. the method is based on minimizingthe scatter of a linear inverse tully-fisher relation $\eta= \eta(m)$ where theabsolute magnitude of each galaxy is inferred from its redshift $z$, correctedby a peculiar velocity field, $m \propto m - 5\log(z-u)$. we describe theradial peculiar velocity field $u({\bf z})$ in terms of a set of orthogonalfunctions which can be derived from any convenient basis set; as an example wetake them to be linear combinations of low order spherical harmonic andspherical bessel functions. the model parameters are then found by maximizingthe likelihood function for measuring a set of observed $\eta$. the predictedpeculiar velocities are free of malmquist bias in the absence ofmulti-streaming, provided no selection criteria are imposed on the measurementof circular velocities. this procedure can be considered as a generalizedsmoothing algorithm of the peculiar velocity field, and is particularly usefulfor comparison to the smoothed gravity field derived from full-sky galaxyredshift catalogs such as the iras surveys. we demonstrate the technique usinga catalog of ``galaxies" derived from an n-body simulation. increasing theresolution of the velocity smoothing beyond a certain level degrades thecorrelation of fitted velocities against the velocities calculated from lineartheory methods, which have finite resolution,

astro-ph;9501025	indications of dark matter derived from large scale flows	recent progress in the measurement of relative distances to galaxies has beenquite substantial, and catalogs of 3000 galaxies with distances are soon tobecome available. the peculiar {\it velocity} field (deviations from hubbleflow) derivable from these catalogs, when compared to the peculiar {\itgravity} field derived from all sky redshift surveys of galaxies such as the1.2jy iras survey, leads to a unique and extremely powerful test of the densityparameter $\beta \equiv \omega^{0.6}/b_i$, where $b_i$ is the possible linearbias of the iras selected galaxies relative to the mass fluctuations. we reviewthe status of these large scale flow measurements and present a new methodologyto describe the two fields by means of an expansion in a set of orthogonalizedfunctions describing a general potential flow to any chosen resolution. theparameters of the flow can be estimated by minimization of the $\chi^2$describing the scatter of observed versus predicted linewidths from an inversetully-fisher relation. by this method one can intercompare the gravity andvelocity fields coefficient by coefficient, deriving a precise fit for thedensity parameter and an assessment of the degree of coherence between thefields. the present situation is transitory-- different analyses of the samedata are not yielding consistent results. until this embarassment is untangled,estimates of $\beta$ should be taken with a large grain of salt.

astro-ph;9505080	galaxy tracers and velocity bias	this paper examines several methods of tracing galaxies in n-body simulationsand their effects on the derived galaxy statistics, especially measurements ofvelocity bias. using two simulations with identical initial conditions, onefollowing dark matter only and the other following dark matter and baryons,both collisionless and collisional methods of tracing galaxies are compared toone another and against a set of idealized criteria. none of the collisionlessmethods proves satisfactory, including an elaborate scheme developed here tocircumvent previously known problems. the main problem is that galacticoverdensities are both secularly and impulsively disrupted while orbiting incluster potentials. with dissipation, the baryonic tracers have much higherdensity contrasts and much smaller cross sections, allowing them to remaindistinct within the cluster potential. the question remains whether theincomplete physical model introduces systematic biases. statistical measuresdetermined from simulations can vary significantly based solely on the galaxytracing method utilized. the two point correlation function differs most onsub-cluster scales with generally good agreement on larger scales. pairwisevelocity dispersions show less uniformity on all scales addressed here. alltracing methods show a velocity bias to varying degrees, but the predictionsare not firm: either the tracing method is not robust or the statisticalsignificance has not been demonstrated. though theoretical arguments suggestthat a mild velocity bias should exist, simulation results are not yetconclusive.

astro-ph;9511005	the optical redshift survey ii: derivation of the luminosity and  diameter functions and of the density field	we quantify the effects of galactic extinction on the derived luminosity anddiameter functions and on the density field of a redshift sample. galaxymagnitudes are more affected by extinction than are diameters, although theeffect on the latter is more variable from galaxy to galaxy, making it moredifficult to quantify. we develop a maximum-likelihood approach to correct theluminosity function, the diameter function and the density field for extinctioneffects. the effects of random and systematic photometric errors are alsoinvestigated. the derived density field is robust to both random and systematicmagnitude errors as long as these are uncorrelated with position on the sky,since biases in the derived selection function and number counts tend to cancelone another. extinction-corrected luminosity and diameter functions are derivedfor several subsamples of the {\it optical redshift survey} (ors). extinctioncorrections for the diameter-limited subsamples are found to be unreliable,possibly due to the superposition of random and systematic errors. the orssubsamples are combined using overall density scaling factors from a full-skyredshift survey of \iras\ galaxies, allowing the reconstruction of the opticalgalaxy density field over most of the sky to 8000 \kms.

astro-ph;9604101	comparison of velocity and gravity fields: the mark iii tully-fisher  catalog versus the iras 1.2 jy survey	we consider a measure of the peculiar velocity field derived from the markiii compilation of 2900 spiral galaxies (willick \etal 1996b), using ananalysis that is substantially free of bias (nusser and davis 1995). we expandthe velocity field in a set of orthogonal, smooth modes, reducing the data to aset of 56 coefficients fitted to a maximum redshift of 6000 km/s, and maximumspherical harmonic of l=3. equivalent mode coefficients can be computed for thegravity field derived from any whole-sky redshift catalog of galaxies, such asthe \iras 1.2 jy survey (fisher \etal 1995). detailed intercomparison shows thetwo independent fields to be remarkably aligned in general. there are, however,systematic discrepancies in the fields that lead to coherence in the residualsbetween them. these residuals take the form of a dipole field in the lg framethat grows with distance; it is not consistent with a bulk flow residual.  a chi-squared analysis of the mode-mode comparison designed to determinewhich value of $\beta\equiv \omega^{0.6}/b$ for the \iras gravity field bestfits the mark iii velocity field shows instead that no value of $\beta$ isacceptable. this is in contrast to the simulated catalogs, and suggests thatthere must be some systematic discrepancy between the two fields.

astro-ph;9604113	redshift z ~ 1 field galaxies observed with the keck telescope and the  hst	we report results based on 35 new spectroscopic redshifts obtained with thekeck telescope for field galaxies that also have photometry and morphology fromsurvey images taken by the refurbished hst. a sample of 24 redshifts forgalaxies fainter than i = 22 has a median redshift of z ~ 0.81. this result isinconsistent with the lower median redshift of z ~ 0.6 predicted by the``maximal merger models'' of carlberg (1996), which otherwise fit existingdata. the data match an extrapolation of the cfrs, as well as predictions ofcertain mild luminosity-evolution models. nearly half of the redshifts lie intwo structures at z ~ 0.81 and z ~ 1.0, showing the presence of high densityconcentrations spanning scales of ~ 1/h mpc, i.e., the size of groups. we findemission lines or the presence of possible neighbors in 7 of 9 otherwiseluminous galaxies with red central regions at redshifts beyond z ~ 0.7. we alsonote a diversity of morphological types among blue galaxies at z ~ 1, includingsmall compact galaxies, ``chains,'' and ``blue nucleated galaxies.'' thesemorphologies are found among local, but generally less luminous, galaxies.distant blue galaxies also include apparently normal late-type spirals. thesefindings could imply modest bursts of star formation caused by mergers orinteractions of small, gas-rich galaxies with each other or with larger,well-formed galaxies. this first glimpse of very faint z ~ 1 field galaxies ofdiverse colors and morphologies suggests that a mixture of physical processesis at work in the formation and evolution of faint field galaxies.

astro-ph;9606153	keck spectroscopy of objects with lens-like morphologies in the hubble  deep field	we present spectroscopy from the keck telescope of three sets of objects inthe hubble deep field which have lens-like morphologies. in the case ofj123641+621204, which is composed of four objects with similar colors and amean separation of &lt;= 0.8", we find at least two distinct components atredshifts of z=3.209 and z=3.220 which are separated by 0.5" spatially. each ofthese components has narrow ly-alpha emission, and possibly nv emission andsiiv and civ in absorption or with a p-cygni profile. the second case isj123652+621227, which has an arc-like feature offset by 1.8" to the southwestof a red elliptical-like galaxy, and a ``counterimage'' offset 1.4" on theopposite side. we tentatively find a single line at 5301 aa at the spatialposition of the counterimage, and no corresponding emission line at theposition of the arc. the colors of the counterimage are consistent with theidentification of this line as ly-alpha at z=3.36. the colors of the arc aredifferent than those of the counterimage, and thus both the colors and spectraindicate that this object is unlikely to be a gravitational lens. for a thirdlensing candidate (j123656+621221), which is a blue arc offset by 0.9" from ared, elliptical-like galaxy, our spectroscopy does not clearly resolve thesystem spatially, complicating the interpretation of the spectrum. we discusspossible identifications of features in the spectrum, and find thatgravitational lensing remains a possibility in this case. we conclude that thefrequency of strong gravitational lensing by galaxies in the hdf appears to bevery low. this result is difficult to reconcile with the introduction of acosmological constant to account for the large number of faint blue galaxiesvia a large volume element at high redshift.

astro-ph;9608001	the two-point correlation function and morphological segregation in the  optical redshift survey	we study the clustering of galaxies in real and redshift space using theoptical redshift survey (ors). we estimate the two point correlation functionin redshift space, $\xi(s)$, for several subsamples of ors, spanning nearly afactor of 30 in volume and detect significant variations in $\xi(s)$ among thesubsamples covering small volumes. for volumes \gtsima $(75 h^{-1} {\rmmpc})^{3}$ the ors subsamples present very similar clustering patterns.powerlaw fits to $\xi(s)$ give best-fit values in the range $1.5 \leq\gamma_{s} \leq 1.7 $ and $6.5 \leq s_{0} \leq 8.8 h^{-1}$ mpc for severalsamples extending to redshifts of 8000 km s$^{-1}$. we find that $\xi(s)$ islarger for the magnitude-limited sample than for diameter-limited one within aradius of 4000 km s$^{-1}$. we interpret this as an indirect result ofmorphological segregation coupled with differences in morphological mix. wesplit ors into morphological subsamples and confirm the existence ofmorphological segregation of galaxies out to scales of $s \sim 10 h^{-1}$ mpc.our results indicate that the relative bias factor between early type galaxiesand late-types may be weakly dependent on scale. if real, this would suggestnon-linear biasing. we also compute correlations as a function of radial andprojected separations, $\xi(r_p, \pi)$ and derive the real space correlationfunction, $\xi(r)$. the results obtained in real space confirm those foundusing $\xi(s)$.

astro-ph;9609159	colors and k-band counts of extremely faint field galaxies	we combine deep k-band (keck) with v- and i-band (ntt) observations of twohigh-galactic latitude fields, surveying a total of ~2 sq. arcmin. the k-bandgalaxy counts continue to rise above k=22, reaching surface densities of few x10^5 per sq. degree. the slope for the counts is (d log(n) per mag per sq.degree) = 0.23 +/- 0.02 between k=18-23, consistent with other deep k surveys.the numbers of galaxies in each mag bin is about two times greater than thegalaxy counts of djorgovski et al. (1995).  the optical and near infrared magnitudes of all objects detected in the v+i+kimage are discussed in the context of grids of isochrone synthesis galaxyevolutionary models (bruzual &amp; charlot 1993, 1995). the colors of most of theobserved galaxies are consistent with a population drawn from a broad redshiftdistribution. a few galaxies at k=19-20 are red in both colors (v-i&gt;3; i-k&gt;2),consistent with being early-type galaxies having undergone a burst of starformation at z&gt;5 and viewed at z~1. at k&gt;20, we find ~8 ``red outlier''galaxies with i-k&gt;4 and v-i&lt;2.5, whose colors are difficult to mimic by asingle evolving or non-evolving stellar population at any redshift. they arelikely either low-metallicity, dusty dwarf galaxies, or old galaxies at highredshift (z&gt;1.2). their surface density is several per square arcminute, whichis so high that they are probably common objects of low luminosity $l&lt;l_*$.

astro-ph;9702152	an estimate of h_0 from keck spectroscopy of the gravitational lens  system 0957+561	we present long-slit lris/keck spectroscopic observations of thegravitational lens system 0957+561. averaged over all of our data, therest-frame velocity dispersion sigma_v of the central lens galaxy g1 is sigma_v= 279 +- 12 km/s. however, there appears to be a significant decrease insigma_v as a function of distance from the center of g1 that is not typical ofbrightest cluster galaxies. within 0.2" of the center of g1, we find theaverage sigma_v = 316+- 14 km/s, whereas for positions &gt; 0.2" from the centerof g1, we find the average sigma_v= 266+-12 km/s. a plausible explanation isthat g1 contains a central massive dark object of mass m_mdo ~ 4x10^9h_100^{-1} m_sun (h_100 = h_0/100km/s/mpc), which contributes to the centralvelocity dispersion, and that the outer value of sigma_v is the appropriatemeasure of the depth of the potential well of g1. the determination of aluminosity-weighted estimate of sigma_v is essential for a determination of h_0from 0957+561; our accurate measurements remove one of the chief uncertaintiesin the assumed form of the mass distribution of the lens. thus, with the recentapparent reduction in the uncertainty in the measurement of the time delay forthe images a and b of 0957+561, delta tau_ba = 417+-3 d (kundic et al. 1996),we obtain an estimate for the hubble constant: h_0 = 62+-7 km/s/mpc. if forsome reason the trend of sigma_v with slit position is spurious and we shoulduse the dispersion averaged along the slit, then the estimate of h_0 increasesto 67+-8 km/s/mpc. these standard errors do not, however, include anycontribution from any errors in the assumed form of the mass distribution ofthe lens. in particular, we used the mass model described by falco, gorenstein&amp; shapiro (1991), as updated by grogin &amp; narayan (1996a, b). the reduced chi^2

astro-ph;9705224	a galaxy-weighted measure of the relative peculiar velocity dispersion	the relative pair dispersion of galaxies has for the past decade been thestandard measure of the thermal energy of fluctuations in the observed galaxydistribution. this statistic is known to be unstable, since it is apair-weighted measure that is very sensitive to rare, rich clusters ofgalaxies. as a more stable alternative, we here present asingle-particle-weighted statistic $\sigma_1$, which can be considered as anestimate of the one-dimensional rms peculiar velocity dispersion of galaxiesrelative to their neighbors, and which can be interpreted by means of afiltered version of the cosmic-energy equation. we calculate this statistic forthe all-sky survey of iras galaxies, finding $\sigma_1=95 \pm 16 $ km/sec. theugc catalog yields a higher value, $\sigma_1=130 \pm 15$ km/s. we calibrate ourprocedure by means of mock catalogs constructed from n-body simulations andfind that our method is stable and has modest biases which can easily becorrected. we use the measured values of $\sigma_1$ in a filtered layzer-irvineequation to obtain an estimate of $\tilde\omega \equiv \omega/b^2$. we findthat $\tilde\omega\approx 0.14 \pm 0.05$ for both the iras and ugc catalogs,which is slightly lower than other recent determinations, but is consistentwith a trend of an effective $\omega$ that increases gradually with scale.

astro-ph;9710327	maps of dust ir emission for use in estimation of reddening and cmbr  foregrounds	we present a full sky 100 micron map that is a reprocessed composite of thecobe/dirbe and iras/issa maps, with the zodiacal foreground and confirmed pointsources removed. before using the issa maps, we remove the remaining artifactsfrom the iras scan pattern. using the dirbe 100 micron and 240 micron data, wehave constructed a map of the dust temperature, so that the 100 micron map canbe converted to a map proportional to dust column density. the result of thesemanipulations is a map with dirbe-quality calibration and iras resolution.  to generate the full sky dust maps, we must first remove zodiacal lightcontamination as well as a possible cosmic infrared background (cib). this isdone via a regression analysis of the 100 micron dirbe map against the leiden-dwingeloo map of h_i emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via asuitable expansion of the dirbe 25 micron flux. for the 100 micron map, nosignificant cib is detected. in the 140 micron and 240 micron maps, where thezodiacal contamination is weaker, we detect the cib at surprisingly high fluxlevels of 32 \pm 13 nw/m^2/sr at 140 micron, and 17 \pm 4 nw/m^2/sr at 240micron (95% confidence). this integrated flux is ~2 times that extrapolatedfrom optical galaxies in the hubble deep field.  the primary use of these maps is likely to be as a new estimator of galacticextinction. we demonstrate that the new maps are twice as accurate as the olderburstein-heiles estimates in regions of low and moderate reddening. these dustmaps will also be useful for estimating millimeter emission that contaminatescmbr experiments and for estimating soft x-ray absorption.

astro-ph;9802173	the velocity field predicted by the optical redshift survey	we have used the optical redshift survey (ors; santiago et al. 1995) toconstruct the gravity field due to fluctuations in the galaxy density field outto distances of 8000 km/s. at large scales where linear theory applies, thecomparison of this gravity field with the observed peculiar velocity fieldoffers a powerful cosmological probe, because the predicted flow field isproportional to the parameter omega^{0.6}/b, where omega is the matter densityand b is the bias of the galaxy distribution. the more densely sampled orsgravity field, to excellent approximation, matches that of the earlier iras1.2-jy redshift survey (fisher et al. 1995), provided beta is reduced by afactor b(opt)/b(iras)=1.4. apart from this scaling, the most significantdifference between the ors and iras fields is induced by differing estimates ofthe over-density of the virgo cluster. neither of these gravity fields isconsistent with the peculiar velocity field constructed from the full mark iii(willick et al. 1997) sample. we find that a simple but plausible non-linearbias algorithm for the galaxy distribution relative to the mass has anegligible effect on the derived fields. we conclude that the substitution ofoptical for iras catalogues cannot alone resolve the discrepancies between theiras gravity field and the mark iii peculiar velocity field.

astro-ph;9904368	a cepheid distance to ngc 4603 in centaurus	in an attempt to use cepheid variables to determine the distance to thecentaurus cluster, we have obtained images of ngc 4603 with the hubble spacetelescope on 9 epochs using wfpc2 and the f555w and f814w filters. this galaxyhas been suggested to lie within the ``cen30'' portion of the cluster and isthe most distant object for which this method has been attempted. previousdistance estimates for cen30 have varied significantly and some have presenteddisagreements with the peculiar velocity predicted from redshift surveys,motivating this investigation. using our observations, we have found 61candidate cepheid variable stars; however, a significant fraction of thesecandidates are likely to be nonvariable stars whose magnitude measurementerrors happen to fit a cepheid light curve of significant amplitude for somechoice of period and phase. through a maximum likelihood technique, wedetermine that we have observed 43 +/- 7 real cepheids and that ngc 4603 has adistance modulus of 32.61 +0.11/-0.10 (random, 1 sigma) +0.24/-0.25(systematic, adding in quadrature), corresponding to a distance of 33.3 mpc.this is consistent with a number of recent estimates of the distance to ngc4603 or cen30 and implies a small peculiar velocity consistent with predictionsfrom the iras 1.2 jy redshift survey if the galaxy lies in the foreground ofthe cluster.

astro-ph;9905128	extrapolation of galactic dust emission at 100 microns to cmbr  frequencies using firas	we present predicted full-sky maps of submillimeter and microwave emissionfrom the diffuse interstellar dust in the galaxy. these maps are extrapolatedfrom the 100 micron emission and 100/240 micron flux ratio maps that schlegel,finkbeiner, &amp; davis (1998; sfd98) generated from iras and cobe/dirbe data.results are presented for a number of physically plausible emissivity models.  we find that no power law emissivity function fits the firas data from 200 -2100 ghz. in this paper we provide a formalism for a multi-component model forthe dust emission. a two-component model with a mixture of silicate andcarbon-dominated grains (motivated by pollack et al., 1994}) provides a fit toan accuracy of about 15% to all the firas data over the entire high-latitudesky. small systematic differences are found between the atomic and molecularphases of the ism.  our predictions for the thermal (vibrational) emission from galactic dust at\nu &lt; 3000 ghz are available for general use. these full-sky predictions can bemade at the dirbe resolution of 40' or at the higher resolution of 6.1 arcminfrom the sfd98 dirbe-corrected iras maps.

astro-ph;9909030	the galaxy-weighted small-scale velocity dispersion of the las campanas  redshift survey	the pair-weighted relative velocity dispersion of galaxies provides a measureof the thermal energy of fluctuations of the observed galaxy distribution, butthe measure is difficult to interpret and is very sensitive to the existence ofrare, rich clusters of galaxies. several alternative statistical procedureshave recently been suggested to relieve these problems. we apply a variant ofthe object-weighted statistical method of davis, miller, &amp; white (1997) to thelas campanas redshift survey (lcrs), which is the largest and deepest existingredshift survey that is nearly fully sampled. the derived one-dimensionaldispersion on scales ~ 1 mpc/h is quite low: sigma_1 = 126 +/- 10 km/s, with amodest decrease at larger scales. the statistic is very stable; the sixindependent slices of the lcrs all yield consistent results. we apply the samestatistical procedure to halos in numerical simulations of an open cosmologicalmodel and flat models with and without a cosmological constant. in contrast tothe lcrs, all the models show a dispersion which increases for scales &gt; 1mpc/h; it is uncertain whether this is a numerical artifact or a real physicaleffect. the standard cluster-normalized cold dark matter model with omega_m = 1as well as a tilted variant with n = 0.8 yield dispersions substantially hotterthan the lcrs value, while models with low matter density (omega_m = 0.3) arebroadly consistent with the lcrs data. using a filtered cosmic energy equation,we measure omega_m ~ 0.2, with small-scale bias factors b = 1.0--1.5 forhigh-density models and b = 0.7--1.1 for low-density models.

astro-ph;9912366	measuring the cosmic equation of state with counts of galaxies	the classical dn/dz test allows the determination of fundamental cosmologicalparameters from the evolution of the cosmic volume element. this test isapplied by measuring the redshift distribution of a tracer whose evolution innumber density is known. in the past, ordinary galaxies have been used as sucha tracer; however, in the absence of a complete theory of galaxy formation,that method is fraught with difficulties. in this paper, we propose studyinginstead the evolution of the apparent abundance of dark matter halos as afunction of their circular velocity, observable via the linewidths or rotationspeeds of visible galaxies. upcoming redshift surveys will allow the linewidthdistribution of galaxies to be determined at both z~1 and the present day. inthe course of studying this test, we have devised a rapid, improvedsemi-analytic method for calculating the circular velocity distribution of darkhalos based upon the analytic mass function of sheth et al. (1999) and theformation time distribution of lacey &amp; cole (1993). we find that if selectioneffects are well-controlled and minimal external constraints are applied, theplanned deep redshift survey should allow the measurement of the cosmicequation-of-state parameter w to 10% (as little as 3% if omega_m has beenwell-determined from other observations). this type of test has the potentialalso to provide a constraint on any evolution of w such as that predicted by``tracker'' models.

0810.3235	inspiralling supermassive black holes: a new signpost for galaxy mergers	we present a new technique for observationally identifying galaxy mergersspectroscopically rather than through host galaxy imaging. our techniqueexploits the dynamics of supermassive black holes (smbhs) powering activegalactic nuclei (agns) in merger-remnant galaxies. because structure in theuniverse is built up through galaxy mergers and nearly all galaxies host acentral smbh, some galaxies should possess two smbhs near their centers as theresult of a recent merger. these smbhs spiral to the center of the resultantmerger-remnant galaxy, and one or both of the smbhs may power agns. using thedeep2 galaxy redshift survey, we have examined 1881 red galaxies, of which 91exhibit [o iii] and hbeta emission lines indicative of seyfert 2 activity. ofthese, 32 agns have [o iii] emission-line redshifts significantly differentfrom the redshifts of the host galaxies' stars, corresponding to velocityoffsets of ~50 km/s to ~300 km/s. two of these agns exhibit double-peaked [oiii] emission lines, while the remaining 30 agns each exhibit a single set ofvelocity-offset [o iii] emission lines. after exploring a variety of physicalmodels for these velocity offsets, we argue that the most likely explanation isinspiralling smbhs in merger-remnant galaxies. based on this interpretation, wefind that roughly half of the red galaxies hosting agns are also mergerremnants, which implies that mergers may trigger agn activity in red galaxies.the agn velocity offsets we find imply a merger fraction of ~30% and a mergerrate of ~3 mergers/gyr for red galaxies at redshifts 0.34 &lt; z &lt; 0.82.
