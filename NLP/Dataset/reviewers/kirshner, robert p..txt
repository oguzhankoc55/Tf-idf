0901.4787	cfa3: 185 type ia supernova light curves from the cfa	we present multi-band photometry of 185 type-ia supernovae (sn ia), with over11500 observations. these were acquired between 2001 and 2008 at the f. l.whipple observatory of the harvard-smithsonian center for astrophysics (cfa).this sample contains the largest number of homogeneously-observed and reducednearby sn ia (z &lt; 0.08) published to date. it more than doubles the nearbysample, bringing sn ia cosmology to the point where systematic uncertaintiesdominate. our natural system photometry has a precision of 0.02 mag or betterin bvrir'i' and roughly 0.04 mag in u for points brighter than 17.5 mag. wealso estimate a systematic uncertainty of 0.03 mag in our sn ia standard systembvrir'i' photometry and 0.07 mag for u. comparisons of our standard systemphotometry with published sn ia light curves and comparison stars, whereavailable for the same sn, reveal agreement at the level of a few hundredthsmag in most cases. we find that 1991bg-like sn ia are sufficiently distinctfrom other sn ia in their color and light-curve-shape/luminosity relation thatthey should be treated separately in light-curve/distance fitter trainingsamples. the cfa3 sample will contribute to the development of betterlight-curve/distance fitters, particularly in the few dozen cases wherenear-infrared photometry has been obtained and, together, can help disentanglehost-galaxy reddening from intrinsic supernova color, reducing the systematicuncertainty in sn ia distances due to dust.

0901.4804	improved dark energy constraints from ~100 new cfa supernova type ia  light curves	we combine the cfa3 supernova type ia (sn ia) sample with samples from theliterature to calculate improved constraints on the dark energy equation ofstate parameter, w. the cfa3 sample is added to the union set of kowalski etal. (2008) to form the constitution set and, combined with a bao prior,produces 1+w=0.013 +0.066/-0.068 (0.11 syst), consistent with the cosmologicalconstant. the cfa3 addition makes the cosmologically-useful sample of nearby snia between 2.6 and 2.9 times larger than before, reducing the statisticaluncertainty to the point where systematics play the largest role. we use fourlight curve fitters to test for systematic differences: salt, salt2, mlcs2k2(r_v=3.1), and mlcs2k2 (r_v=1.7). salt produces high-redshift hubble residualswith systematic trends versus color and larger scatter than mlcs2k2. mlcs2k2overestimates the intrinsic luminosity of sn ia with 0.7 &lt; delta &lt; 1.2. mlcs2k2with r_v=3.1 overestimates host-galaxy extinction while r_v=1.7 does not. ourinvestigation is consistent with no hubble bubble. we also find that, afterlight-curve correction, sn ia in scd/sd/irr hosts are intrinsically fainterthan those in e/s0 hosts by 2 sigma, suggesting that they may come fromdifferent populations. we also find that sn ia in scd/sd/irr hosts have lowscatter (0.1 mag) and reddening. current systematic errors can be reduced byimproving sn ia photometric accuracy, by including the cfa3 sample to retrainlight-curve fitters, by combining optical sn ia photometry with near-infraredphotometry to understand host-galaxy extinction, and by determining ifdifferent environments give rise to different intrinsic sn ia luminosity aftercorrection for light-curve shape and color.

0902.2794	sn 2008ha: an extremely low luminosity and extremely low energy  supernova	we present ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared photometry as well asoptical spectra of the peculiar supernova (sn) 2008ha. sn 2008ha had a very lowpeak luminosity, reaching only m_v = -14.2 mag, and low line velocities of only~2000 km/s near maximum brightness, indicating a very small kinetic energy perunit mass of ejecta. spectroscopically, sn 2008ha is a member of the sn2002cx-like class of sne, a peculiar subclass of sne ia; however, sn 2008ha isthe most extreme member, being significantly fainter and having lower linevelocities than the typical member, which is already ~2 mag fainter and hasline velocities ~5000 km/s smaller (near maximum brightness) than a normal snia. sn 2008ha had a remarkably short rise time of only ~10 days, significantlyshorter than either sn 2002cx-like objects (~15 days) or normal sne ia (~19.5days). the bolometric light curve of sn 2008ha indicates that sn 2008ha peakedat l_peak = (9.5 +/- 1.4) x 10^40 ergs/s, making sn 2008ha perhaps the leastluminous sn ever observed. from its peak luminosity and rise time, we inferthat sn 2008ha generated (3.0 +/- 0.9) x 10^-3 m_sun of 56ni, had a kineticenergy of ~2 x 10^48 ergs, and ejected 0.15 m_sun of material. we classifythree new (and one potential) members of the sn 2002cx-like class, expandingthe sample to 14 (and one potential) members. the host-galaxy morphologydistribution of the class is consistent with that of sne ia, ib, ic, and ii.several models for generating low-luminosity sne can explain the observationsof sn 2008ha; however, if a single model is to describe all sn 2002cx-likeobjects, either electron capture in ne-mg white dwarfs causing a core collapse,or deflagration of c-o white dwarfs with sn 2008ha being a partial deflagrationand not unbinding the progenitor star, are preferred. abridged.

0706.2663	chandra acis survey of m33 (chasem33): x-ray imaging spectroscopy of  m33snr21, the brightest x-ray supernova remnant in m33	we present and interpret new x-ray data for m33snr21, the brightest x-raysupernova remnant (snr) in m33. the snr is in seen projection against (andappears to be interacting with) the bright hii region ngc592. data for thissource were obtained as part of the chandra acis survey of m33 (chasem33) verylarge project. the nearly on-axis chandra data resolve the snr into a ~5"diameter (20 pc at our assumed m33 distance of 817+/-58 kpc) slightlyelliptical shell. the shell is brighter in the east, which suggests that it isencountering higher density material in that direction. the optical emission iscoextensive with the x-ray shell in the north, but extends well beyond thex-ray rim in the southwest. modeling the x-ray spectrum with an absorbed sedovmodel yields a shock temperature of 0.46(+0.01,-0.02) kev, an ionizationtimescale of n_e t = $2.1 (+0.2,-0.3) \times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$ s, andhalf-solar abundances (0.45 (+0.12, -0.09)). assuming sedov dynamics gives anaverage preshock h density of 1.7 +/- 0.3 cm$^{-3}$. the dynamical age estimateis 6500 +/- 600 yr, while the best fit $n_e t$ value and derived $n_e$ gives8200 +/- 1700 yr; the weighted mean of the age estimates is 7600 +/- 600 yr. weestimate an x-ray luminosity (0.25-4.5 kev) of (1.2 +/- 0.2) times $10^{37}$ergs s$^{-1}$ (absorbed), and (1.7 +/- 0.3) times $10^{37}$ ergs s$^{-1}$(unabsorbed), in good agreement with the recent xmm-newton determination. nosignificant excess hard emission was detected; the luminosity $\le 1.2\times10^{35}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ (2-8 kev) for any hard point source.

0907.1083	variable sodium absorption in a low-extinction type ia supernova	recent observations have revealed that some type ia supernovae exhibitnarrow, time-variable na i d absorption features. the origin of the absorbingmaterial is controversial, but it may suggest the presence of circumstellar gasin the progenitor system prior to the explosion, with significant implicationsfor the nature of the supernova progenitors. we present the third detection ofsuch variable absorption, based on six epochs of high-resolution spectroscopyof the type ia supernova sn 2007le from keck and the het. the data span ~3months, from 5 days before maximum light to 90 days after maximum. we find thatone component of the na d absorption lines strengthened significantly withtime, indicating a total column density increase of ~2.5 x 10^12 cm^-2. thechanges are most prominent after maximum light rather than at earlier timeswhen the uv flux from the sn peaks. as with sn 2006x, we detect no change inthe ca ii h&amp;k lines over the same time period, rendering line-of-sight effectsimprobable and suggesting a circumstellar origin for the absorbing material.unlike the previous two sne exhibiting variable absorption, sn 2007le is nothighly reddened (e_b-v = 0.27 mag), also pointing toward circumstellar ratherthan interstellar absorption. photoionization models show that the data areconsistent with a dense (10^7 cm^-3) cloud or clouds of gas located ~0.1 pcfrom the explosion. these results broadly support the single-degeneratescenario previously proposed to explain the variable absorption, with mass lossfrom a nondegenerate companion star responsible for providing the circumstellargas. we also present tentative evidence for narrow halpha emission associatedwith the sn, which will require followup observations at late times to confirm.[abridged]

0908.0536	type ia supernova light curve inference: hierarchical bayesian analysis  in the near infrared	we present a comprehensive statistical analysis of the properties of type iasn light curves in the near infrared using recent data from pairitel and theliterature. we construct a hierarchical bayesian framework, incorporatingseveral uncertainties including photometric error, peculiar velocities, dustextinction and intrinsic variations, for coherent statistical inference. sn ialight curve inferences are drawn from the global posterior probability ofparameters describing both individual supernovae and the population conditionedon the entire sn ia nir dataset. the logical structure of the hierarchicalmodel is represented by a directed acyclic graph. fully bayesian analysis ofthe model and data is enabled by an efficient mcmc algorithm exploiting theconditional structure using gibbs sampling. we apply this framework to thejhk_s sn ia light curve data. a new light curve model captures the observedj-band light curve shape variations. the intrinsic variances in peak absolutemagnitudes are: sigma(m_j) = 0.17 +/- 0.03, sigma(m_h) = 0.11 +/- 0.03, andsigma(m_ks) = 0.19 +/- 0.04. we describe the first quantitative evidence forcorrelations between the nir absolute magnitudes and j-band light curve shapes,and demonstrate their utility for distance estimation. the average residual inthe hubble diagram for the training set sn at cz &gt; 2000 km/s is 0.10 mag. thenew application of bootstrap cross-validation to sn ia light curve inferencetests the sensitivity of the model fit to the finite sample and estimates theprediction error at 0.15 mag. these results demonstrate that sn ia nir lightcurves are as effective as optical light curves, and, because they are lessvulnerable to dust absorption, they have great potential as precise andaccurate cosmological distance indicators.

0912.0263	sn 2006bt: a perplexing, troublesome, and possibly misleading type ia  supernova	sn 2006bt displays characteristics unlike those of any other known type iasupernova (sn ia). we present optical light curves and spectra of sn 2006btwhich demonstrate the peculiar nature of this object. sn 2006bt has broad,slowly declining light curves indicative of a hot, high-luminosity sn, butlacks a prominent second maximum in the i band as do low-luminosity sne ia. itsspectra are similar to those of low-luminosity sne ia, containing features thatare only present in cool sn photospheres. light-curve fitting methods suggestthat sn 2006bt is reddened by a significant amount of dust; however, itoccurred in the outskirts of its early-type host galaxy and has no strong na dabsorption in any of its spectra, suggesting a negligible amount of host-galaxydust absorption. c ii is possibly detected in our pre-maximum spectra, but at amuch lower velocity than other elements. the progenitor was likely very old,being a member of the halo population of a galaxy that shows no signs of recentstar formation. sne ia have been very successfully modeled as a one-parameterfamily, and this is fundamental to their use as cosmological distanceindicators. sn 2006bt is a challenge to that picture, yet its relatively normallight curves allowed sn 2006bt to be included in cosmological analyses. wegenerate mock sn ia datasets which indicate that contamination by similarobjects will both increase the scatter of a sn ia hubble diagram andsystematically bias measurements of cosmological parameters. however, spectraand rest-frame i-band light curves should provide a definitive way to identifyand eliminate such objects.

0912.0732	early and late-time observations of sn 2008ha: additional constraints  for the progenitor and explosion	we present a new maximum-light optical spectrum of the the extremely lowluminosity and exceptionally low energy type ia supernova (sn ia) 2008ha,obtained one week before the earliest published spectrum. previous observationsof sn 2008ha were unable to distinguish between a massive star and white dwarforigin for the sn. the new maximum-light spectrum, obtained one week before theearliest previously published spectrum, unambiguously shows featurescorresponding to intermediate mass elements, including silicon, sulfur, andcarbon. although strong silicon features are seen in some core-collapse sne,sulfur features, which are a signature of carbon/oxygen burning, have alwaysbeen observed to be weak in such events. it is therefore likely that sn 2008hawas the result of a thermonuclear explosion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf.carbon features at maximum light show that unburned material is present tosignificant depths in the sn ejecta, strengthening the case that sn 2008ha wasa failed deflagration. we also present late-time imaging and spectroscopy thatare consistent with this scenario.

0912.0929	hubble residuals of nearby type ia supernovae are correlated with host  galaxy masses	from sloan digital sky survey u'g'r'i'z' imaging, we estimate the stellarmasses of the host galaxies of 70 low redshift sn ia (0.015 &lt; z &lt; 0.08) fromthe hosts' absolute luminosities and mass-to-light ratios. these nearby sn werediscovered largely by searches targeting luminous galaxies, and we find thattheir host galaxies are substantially more massive than the hosts of sndiscovered by the flux-limited supernova legacy survey. testing four separatelight curve fitters, we detect ~2.5{\sigma} correlations of hubble residualswith both host galaxy size and stellar mass, such that sn ia occurring inphysically larger, more massive hosts are ~10% brighter after light curvecorrection. the hubble residual is the deviation of the inferred distancemodulus to the sn, calculated from its apparent luminosity and light curveproperties, away from the expected value at the sn redshift. marginalizing overlinear trends in hubble residuals with light curve parameters shows that thecorrelations cannot be attributed to a light curve-dependent calibration error.combining 180 higher-redshift essence, snls, and higherz sn with 30 nearby snwhose host masses are less than 10^10.8 solar masses in a cosmology fit yields1+w=0.22 +0.152/-0.143, while a combination where the 30 nearby sn instead havehost masses greater than 10^10.8 solar masses yields 1+w=-0.03 +0.217/-0.108.progenitor metallicity, stellar population age, and dust extinction correlatewith galaxy mass and may be responsible for these systematic effects. hostgalaxy measurements will yield improved distances to sn ia.

1002.1839	the chandra acis survey of m33: x-ray, optical and radio properties of  the supernova remnants	m33 contains a large number of emission nebulae identified as supernovaremnants (snrs) based on the high [s ii]:ha ratios characteristic of shockedgas. using chandra data from the chasem33 survey with a 0.35-2 kev sensitivityof about 2 x 10**34 ergs/s, we have detected 82 of 137 snr candidates, yieldingconfirmation of (or at least strongly support for) their snr identifications.this provides the largest sample of remnants detected at optical and x-raywavelengths in any galaxy, including the milky way. a spectral analysis of theseven x-ray brightest snrs reveals that two, g98-31 and g98-35, have spectrathat appear to indicate enrichment by ejecta from core-collapse supernovaexplosions. in general, the x-ray detected snrs have soft x-ray spectracompared to the vast majority of sources detected along the line of sight tom33. it is unlikely that there are any other undiscovered thermally dominatedx-ray snrs with luminosities in excess of about 4 x 10**35 ergs/s in theportions of m33 covered by the chasem33 survey. we have used a combination ofnew and archival optical and radio observations to attempt to better understandwhy some objects are detected as x-ray sources and others are not. we have alsodeveloped a morphological classification scheme for the optically-identifiedsnrs, and discuss the efficacy of this scheme as a predictor of x-raydetectability. finally, we have compared the snrs found in m33 to those thathave been observed in the galaxy and the magellanic clouds. there are no closeanalogs of cas a, kepler's snr, tycho's snr or the crab nebula in the regionsof m33 surveyed, but we have found an x-ray source with a power law spectrumcoincident with a small-diameter radio source that may be the first pulsar-windnebula recognized in m33.

1004.2262	spectroscopic discovery of the broad-lined type ic supernova 2010bh  associated with the low-redshift grb 100316d	we present the spectroscopic discovery of a broad-lined type ic supernova (sn2010bh) associated with the nearby long-duration gamma-ray burst (grb) 100316d.at z = 0.0593, this is the third-nearest grb-sn. nightly optical spectraobtained with the magellan telescopes during the first week after explosionreveal the gradual emergence of very broad spectral features superposed on ablue continuum. the supernova features are typical of broad-lined sne ic andare generally consistent with previous supernovae associated with low-redshiftgrbs. however, the inferred velocities of sn 2010bh at 21 days after explosionare a factor of ~2 times larger than those of the prototypical sn 1998bw atsimilar epochs, with v ~ 26,000 km/s, indicating a larger explosion energy or adifferent ejecta structure. a near-infrared spectrum taken 13.8 days afterexplosion shows no strong evidence for he i at 1.083 microns, implying that theprogenitor was largely stripped of its helium envelope. the host galaxy is oflow luminosity (m_r ~ -18.5 mag) and low metallicity (z &lt; 0.4 z_solar), similarto the hosts of other low-redshift grb-sne.

1006.3757	the type ia supernova rate in redshift 0.5--0.9 galaxy clusters	supernova (sn) rates are potentially powerful diagnostics of metal enrichmentand sn physics, particularly in galaxy clusters with their deep,metal-retaining potentials and relatively simple star-formation histories. wehave carried out a survey for supernovae (sne) in galaxy clusters, at aredshift range 0.5&lt;z&lt;0.9, using the advanced camera for surveys (acs) on thehubble space telescope. we reimaged a sample of 15 clusters that werepreviously imaged by acs, thus obtaining two to three epochs per cluster, inwhich we discovered five likely cluster sne, six possible cluster sne ia, twohostless sn candidates, and several background and foreground events. keckspectra of the host galaxies were obtained to establish cluster membership. weconducted detailed efficiency simulations, and measured the stellarluminosities of the clusters using subaru images. we derive a cluster sn rateof 0.35 snub +0.17/-0.12 (statistical) \pm0.13 (classification) \pm0.01(systematic) [where snub = sne (100 yr 10^10 l_b_sun)^-1] and 0.112 snum+0.055/-0.039 (statistical) \pm0.042 (classification) \pm0.005 (systematic)[where snum = sne (100 yr 10^10 m_sun)^-1]. as in previous measurements ofcluster sn rates, the uncertainties are dominated by small-number statistics.the sn rate in this redshift bin is consistent with the sn rate in clusters atlower redshifts (to within the uncertainties), and shows that there is, atmost, only a slight increase of cluster sn rate with increasing redshift. thelow and fairly constant sn ia rate out to z~1 implies that the bulk of the ironmass in clusters was already in place by z~1. the recently observed doubling ofiron abundances in the intracluster medium between z=1 and 0, if real, islikely the result of redistribution of existing iron, rather than newproduction of iron.

1007.4842	the absolute magnitudes of type ia supernovae in the ultraviolet	we examine the absolute magnitudes and light-curve shapes of 14nearby(redshift z = 0.004--0.027) type ia supernovae (sne~ia) observed in theultraviolet (uv) with the swift ultraviolet/optical telescope. colors andabsolute magnitudes are calculated using both a standard milky way (mw)extinction law and one for the large magellanic cloud that has been modified bycircumstellar scattering. we find very different behavior in the near-uvfilters (uvw1_rc covering ~2600-3300 a after removing optical light, and u~3000--4000 a) compared to a mid-uv filter (uvm2 ~2000-2400 a). the uvw1_rc-bcolors show a scatter of ~0.3 mag while uvm2-b scatters by nearly 0.9 mag.similarly, while the scatter in colors between neighboring filters is small inthe optical and somewhat larger in the near-uv, the large scatter in theuvm2-uvw1 colors implies significantly larger spectral variability below 2600a. we find that in the near-uv the absolute magnitudes at peak brightness ofnormal sne ia in our sample are correlated with the optical decay rate with ascatter of 0.4 mag, comparable to that found for the optical in our sample.however, in the mid-uv the scatter is larger, ~1 mag, possibly indicatingdifferences in metallicity. we find no strong correlation between either the uvlight-curve shapes or the uv colors and the uv absolute magnitudes. with largersamples, the uv luminosity might be useful as an additional constraint to helpdetermine distance, extinction, and metallicity in order to improve the utilityof sne ia as standardized candles.

1011.5910	type ia supernova light curve inference: hierarchical models in the  optical and near infrared	we have constructed a comprehensive statistical model for type ia supernova(sn ia) light curves spanning optical through near infrared (nir) data. ahierarchical framework coherently models multiple random and uncertain effects,including intrinsic supernova light curve covariances, dust extinction andreddening, and distances. an improved bayesn mcmc code computes probabilisticinferences for the hierarchical model by sampling the global probabilitydensity of parameters describing individual supernovae and the population. wehave applied this hierarchical model to optical and nir data of 127 sn ia frompairitel, cfa3, csp, and the literature. we find an apparent populationcorrelation between the host galaxy extinction a_v and the the ratio oftotal-to-selective dust absorption r_v. for sn with low dust extinction, a_v &lt;0.4, we find r_v = 2.5 - 2.9, while at high extinctions, a_v &gt; 1, low values ofr_v &lt; 2 are favored. the nir luminosities are excellent standard candles andare less sensitive to dust extinction. they exhibit low correlation withoptical peak luminosities, and thus provide independent information ondistances. the combination of nir and optical data constrains the dustextinction and improves the predictive precision of individual sn ia distancesby about 60%. using cross-validation, we estimate an rms distance modulusprediction error of 0.11 mag for sn with optical and nir data versus 0.15 magfor sn with optical data alone. continued study of sn ia in the nir isimportant for improving their utility as precise and accurate cosmologicaldistance indicators.

1012.0005	do spectra improve distance measurements of type ia supernovae?	[abridged] we investigate the use of a wide variety of spectroscopicmeasurements to determine distances to low-redshift type ia supernovae (sn ia).we consider linear models for predicting distances to sn ia using light-curvewidth and color parameters (determined using the salt2 light-curve fitter) anda spectroscopic indicator, and evaluate the resulting hubble diagram scatterusing a cross-validation procedure. we confirm the ability of spectral fluxratios alone at maximum light to reduce the scatter of hubble residuals by ~10%with respect to the standard combination of light-curve width and color. whenused in combination with the salt2 color parameter, the color-corrected fluxratio r^c(6420/5290) at maximum light leads to an even lower scatter, althoughthe improvement has low statistical significance (&lt;2 sigma) given the size ofour sample (26 sn ia). we highlight the importance of an accurate relative fluxcalibration and the failure of this method for highly-reddened objects.comparison with synthetic spectra from 2d delayed-detonation explosion modelsshows that the correlation of r(6630/4400) with sn ia absolute magnitudes canbe largely attributed to intrinsic color variations and not to reddening bydust in the host galaxy. we consider flux ratios at other ages, as well as theuse of pairs of flux ratios, revealing the presence of small-scale intrinsicspectroscopic variations in the iron-group dominated absorption features around~4300 a and ~4800 a. the best flux ratio overall is the color-correctedr^c(4610/4260) at t=-2.5d from maximum light, which leads to ~30% lower scatterwith respect to the standard combination of light-curve width and color. weexamine other spectroscopic indicators related to line-profile morphology, butnone appear to lead to a significant improvement over the standard light-curvewidth and color parameters.

1101.1298	peculiar type ii supernovae from blue supergiants	the vast majority of type ii supernovae (sne) are produced by red supergiants(rsgs), but sn 1987a revealed that blue supergiants (bsgs) can produce membersof this class as well, albeit with some peculiar properties. this best studiedevent revolutionized our understanding of sne, and linking it to the bulk oftype ii events is essential. we present here optical photometry andspectroscopy gathered for sn 2000cb, which is clearly not a standard type ii snand yet is not a sn 1987a analog. the light curve of sn 2000cb is reminiscentof that of sn 1987a in shape, with a slow rise to a late optical peak, but onsubstantially different time scales. spectroscopically, sn 2000cb resembles anormal sn ii but with ejecta velocities that far exceed those measured for sn1987a or normal sne ii, above 18000 km/s for h-alpha at early times. the redcolours, high velocities, late photometric peak, and our modeling of thisobject all point toward a scenario involving the high-energy explosion of asmall-radius star, most likely a bsg, producing 0.1 solar masses of ni-56.adding a similar object to the sample, sn 2005ci, we derive a rate of about 2%of the core-collapse rate for this loosely defined class of bsg explosions.

1106.3968	the most slowly declining type ia supernova 2001ay	we present optical and near-infrared photometry, as well as ground-basedoptical spectra and hubble space telescope ultraviolet spectra, of the type iasupernova (sn) 2001ay. at maximum light the si ii and mg ii lines indicatedexpansion velocities of 14,000 km/sec, while si iii and s ii showed velocitiesof 9,000 km/sec there is also evidence for some unburned carbon at 12,000km/sec. sn 2001ay exhibited a decline-rate parameter delta m_15(b) = 0.68 \pm0.05 mag; this and the b-band photometry at t &gt; +25 d past maximum make it themost slowly declining type ia sn yet discovered. three of foursuper-chandrasekhar-mass candidates have decline rates almost as slow as this.after correction for galactic and host-galaxy extinction, sn 2001ay had m_b =-19.19 and m_v = -19.17 mag at maximum light; thus, it was not overluminous inoptical bands. in near-infrared bands it was overluminous only at the 2-sigmalevel at most. for a rise time of 18 d (explosion to bolometric maximum) theimplied ni-56 yield was (0.58 \pm 0.15)/alpha m_sun, with alpha = l_max/e_niprobably in the range 1.0 to 1.2. the ni-56 yield is comparable to that of manytype ia supernovae. the "normal" ni-56 yield and the typical peak opticalbrightness suggest that the very broad optical light curve is explained by thetrapping of the gamma rays in the inner regions.

1107.3555	velocity evolution and the intrinsic color of type ia supernovae	to understand how best to use observations of type ia supernovae (sne ia) toobtain precise and accurate distances, we investigate the relations betweenspectra of sne ia and their intrinsic colors. using a sample of 1630 opticalspectra of 255 sne, based primarily on data from the cfa supernova program, weexamine how the velocity evolution and line strengths of si ii 6355 and ca iih&amp;k are related to the b-v color at peak brightness. we find that themaximum-light velocity of si ii 6355 and ca ii h&amp;k and the maximum-lightpseudo-equivalent width of si ii 6355 are correlated with intrinsic color, withintrinsic color having a linear relation with the si ii 6355 measurements. caii h&amp;k does not have a linear relation with intrinsic color, but lower-velocitysne tend to be intrinsically bluer. combining the spectroscopic measurementsdoes not improve intrinsic color inference. the intrinsic color scatter islarger for higher-velocity sne ia --- even after removing a linear trend withvelocity --- indicating that lower-velocity sne ia are more "standard crayons."employing information derived from sn ia spectra has the potential to improvethe measurements of extragalactic distances and the cosmological propertiesinferred from them.

1110.1377	core-collapse supernovae and host galaxy stellar populations	we have used images and spectra of the sloan digital sky survey to examinethe host galaxies of 519 nearby supernovae. the colors at the sites of theexplosions, as well as chemical abundances, and specific star formation ratesof the host galaxies provide circumstantial evidence on the origin of eachsupernova type. we examine separately sn ii, sn iin, sn iib, sn ib, sn ic, andsn ic with broad lines (sn ic-bl). for host galaxies that have multiplespectroscopic fibers, we select the fiber with host radial offset most similarto that of the sn. type ic sn explode at small host offsets, and their hostshave exceptionally strongly star-forming, metal-rich, and dusty stellarpopulations near their centers. the sn ic-bl and sn iib explode inexceptionally blue locations, and, in our sample, we find that the host spectrafor sn ic-bl show lower average oxygen abundances than those for sn ic. sn iibhost fiber spectra are also more metal-poor than those for sn ib, although asignificant difference exists for only one of two strong-line diagnostics. snic-bl host galaxy emission lines show strong central specific star formationrates. in contrast, we find no strong evidence for different environments forsn iin compared to the sites of sn ii. because our supernova sample isconstructed from a variety of sources, there is always a risk that samplingmethods can produce misleading results. we have separated the supernovaediscovered by targeted surveys from those discovered by galaxy-impartialsearches to examine these questions and show that our results do not dependsensitively on the discovery technique.

1110.5809	evidence for type ia supernova diversity from ultraviolet observations  with the hubble space telescope	we present ultraviolet (uv) spectroscopy and photometry of four type iasupernovae (sne 2004dt, 2004ef, 2005m, and 2005cf) obtained with the uv prismof the advanced camera for surveys on the hubble space telescope. this datasetprovides unique spectral time series down to 2000 angstrom. significantdiversity is seen in the near maximum-light spectra (~ 2000--3500 angstrom) forthis small sample. the corresponding photometric data, together with archivaldata from swift ultraviolet/optical telescope observations, provide furtherevidence of increased dispersion in the uv emission with respect to theoptical. the peak luminosities measured in uvw1/f250w are found to correlatewith the b-band light-curve shape parameter dm15(b), but with much largerscatter relative to the correlation in the broad-band b band (e.g., ~0.4 magversus ~0.2 mag for those with 0.8 &lt; dm15 &lt; 1.7 mag). sn 2004dt is found as anoutlier of this correlation (at &gt; 3 sigma), being brighter than normal sne iasuch as sn 2005cf by ~0.9 mag and ~2.0 mag in the uvw1/f250w and uvm2/f220wfilters, respectively. we show that different progenitor metallicity orline-expansion velocities alone cannot explain such a large discrepancy.viewing-angle effects, such as due to an asymmetric explosion, may have asignificant influence on the flux emitted in the uv region. detailed modelingis needed to disentangle and quantify the above effects.

1111.1735	hst-cos observations of hydrogen, helium, carbon and nitrogen emission  from the sn 1987a reverse shock	we present the most sensitive ultraviolet observations of supernova 1987a todate. imaging spectroscopy from the hubble space telescope-cosmic originsspectrograph shows many narrow (dv \sim 300 km/s) emission lines from thecircumstellar ring, broad (dv \sim 10 -- 20 x 10^3 km/s) emission lines fromthe reverse shock, and ultraviolet continuum emission. the high signal-to-noise(&gt; 40 per resolution element) broad lya emission is excited by soft x-ray andeuv heating of mostly neutral gas in the circumstellar ring and outer supernovadebris. the ultraviolet continuum at \lambda &gt; 1350a can be explained by hi2-photon emission from the same region. we confirm our earlier, tentativedetection of nv \lambda 1240 emission from the reverse shock and we present thefirst detections of broad heii \lambda1640, civ \lambda1550, and niv]\lambda1486 emission lines from the reverse shock. the helium abundance in thehigh-velocity material is he/h = 0.14 +/- 0.06. the nv/h-alpha line ratiorequires partial ion-electron equilibration (t_{e}/t_{p} \approx 0.14 - 0.35).we find that the n/c abundance ratio in the gas crossing the reverse shock issignificantly higher than that in the circumstellar ring, a result that may beattributed to chemical stratification in the outer envelope of the supernovaprogenitor. the n/c abundance ratio may have been stratified prior to the ringexpulsion, or this result may indicate continued cno processing in theprogenitor subsequent to the expulsion of the circumstellar ring.

1201.2470	a type ia supernova at redshift 1.55 in hubble space telescope infrared  observations from candels	we report the discovery of a type ia supernova (snia) at redshift z=1.55 withthe infrared detector of the wide field camera 3 (wfc3-ir) on the hubble spacetelescope (hst). this object was discovered in candels imaging data of thehubble ultra deep field, and followed as part of the candels+clash supernovaproject, comprising the sn search components from those two hst multi-cycletreasury programs. this is the highest redshift snia with direct spectroscopicevidence for classification. it is also the first sn ia at z&gt;1 found andfollowed in the infrared, providing a full light curve in rest-frame opticalbands. the classification and redshift are securely defined from a combinationof multi-band and multi-epoch photometry of the sn, ground-based spectroscopyof the host galaxy, and wfc3-ir grism spectroscopy of both the sn and host.this object is the first of a projected sample at z&gt;1.5 that will be discoveredby the candels and clash programs. the full candels+clash sn ia sample willenable unique tests for evolutionary effects that could arise due todifferences in sn ia progenitor systems as a function of redshift. this high-zsample will also allow measurement of the sn ia rate out to z~2, providing acomplementary constraint on sn ia progenitor models.

1202.3140	the low-velocity, rapidly fading type ia supernova 2002es	sn 2002es is a peculiar subluminous type ia supernova (sn ia) with acombination of observed characteristics never before seen in a sn ia. atmaximum light, sn 2002es shares spectroscopic properties with the underluminoussn 1991bg subclass of sne ia, but with substantially lower expansion velocities(~6000 km/s) more typical of the sn 2002cx subclass. photometrically, sn 2002esdiffers from both sn 1991bg-like and sn 2002cx-like supernovae. although atmaximum light it is subluminous (m_b=-17.78 mag), sn 2002es has a relativelybroad light curve (dm15(b)=1.28 +/- 0.04 mag), making it a significant outlierin the light-curve width vs. luminosity relationship. we estimate a 56ni massof 0.17 +/- 0.05 m_sun synthesized in the explosion, relatively low for a snia. one month after maximum light, we find an unexpected plummet in thebolometric luminosity. the late-time decay of the light curves is inconsistentwith our estimated 56ni mass, indicating that either the light curve was notcompletely powered by 56ni decay or the ejecta became optically thin togamma-rays within a month after maximum light. the host galaxy is classified asan s0 galaxy with little to no star formation, indicating the progenitor of sn2002es is likely from an old stellar population. we also present a lessextensive dataset for sn 1999bh, an object which shares similar observedproperties. both objects were found as part of the lick observatory supernovasearch, allowing us to estimate that these objects should account for ~2.5% ofsne ia within a fixed volume. we find that current theoretical models areunable to explain the observed of characteristics of sn 2002es.

1202.5301	the first maximum-light ultraviolet through near-infrared spectrum of a  type ia supernova	we present the first maximum-light ultraviolet (uv) through near-infrared(nir) type ia supernova (sn ia) spectrum. this spectrum of sn 2011iv wasobtained nearly simultaneously by the hubble space telescope at uv/opticalwavelengths and the magellan baade telescope at nir wavelengths. these dataprovide the opportunity to examine the entire maximum-light sn iaspectral-energy distribution. since the uv region of a sn ia spectrum isextremely sensitive to the composition of the outer layers of the explosion,which are transparent at longer wavelengths, this unprecedented spectrum canprovide strong constraints on the composition of the sn ejecta, and similarlythe sn explosion and progenitor system. sn 2011iv is spectroscopically normal,but has a relatively fast decline (delta m_15 (b) = 1.69 +/- 0.05 mag). wecompare sn 2011iv to other sne ia with uv spectra near maximum light andexamine trends between uv spectral properties, light-curve shape, and ejectavelocity. we tentatively find that sne with similar light-curve shapes butdifferent ejecta velocities have similar uv spectra, while those with similarejecta velocities but different light-curve shapes have very different uvspectra. through a comparison with explosion models, we find that both asolar-metallicity w7 and a zero-metallicity delayed-detonation model provide areasonable fit to the spectrum of sn 2011iv from the uv to the nir.

1203.2916	linking type ia supernova progenitors and their resulting explosions	comparing the ejecta velocities at maximum brightness and narrowcircumstellar/interstellar na d absorption line profiles of a sample of 23 typeia supernovae (sne ia), we determine that the properties of sn ia progenitorsystems and explosions are intimately connected. as demonstrated by sternberget al. (2011), half of all sne ia with detectable na d absorption at thehost-galaxy redshift in high-resolution spectroscopy have na d line profileswith significant blueshifted absorption relative to the strongest absorptioncomponent, which indicates that a large fraction of sn ia progenitor systemshave strong outflows. in this study, we find that sne ia with blueshiftedcircumstellar/interstellar absorption systematically have higher ejectavelocities and redder colors at maximum brightness relative to the rest of thesn ia population. this result is robust at a 98.9-99.8% confidence level,providing the first link between the progenitor systems and properties of theexplosion. this finding is further evidence that the outflow scenario is thecorrect interpretation of the blueshifted na d absorption, adding additionalconfirmation that some sne ia are produced from a single-degenerate progenitorchannel. an additional implication is that either sn ia progenitor systems havehighly asymmetric outflows that are also aligned with the sn explosion or sneia come from a variety of progenitor systems where sne ia from systems withstrong outflows tend to have more kinetic energy per unit mass than those fromsystems with weak or no outflows.

1205.4493	cfa4: light curves for 94 type ia supernovae	we present multi-band optical photometry of 94 spectroscopically-confirmedtype ia supernovae (sn ia) in the redshift range 0.0055 to 0.073, obtainedbetween 2006 and 2011. there are a total of 5522 light curve points. we showthat our natural system sn photometry has a precision of roughly 0.03 mag orbetter in bvr'i', 0.06 mag in u', and 0.07 mag in u for points brighter than17.5 mag and estimate that it has a systematic uncertainty of 0.014, 0.010,0.012, 0.014, 0.046, and 0.073 mag in bvr'i'u'u, respectively. comparisons ofour standard system photometry with published sn ia light curves and comparisonstars reveal mean agreement across samples in the range of ~0.00-0.03 mag. wediscuss the recent measurements of our telescope-plus-detector throughput bydirect monochromatic illumination by cramer et al (in prep.). this techniquemeasures the whole optical path through the telescope, auxiliary optics,filters, and detector under the same conditions used to make sn measurements.extremely well-characterized natural-system passbands (both in wavelength andover time) are crucial for the next generation of sn ia photometry to reach the0.01 mag accuracy level. the current sample of low-z sn ia is now sufficientlylarge to remove most of the statistical sampling error from the dark energyerror budget. but pursuing the dark-energy systematic errors by determininghighly-accurate detector passbands, combining optical and near-infrared (nir)photometry and spectra, using the nearby sample to illuminate the populationproperties of sn ia, and measuring the local departures from the hubble flowwill benefit from larger, carefully measured nearby samples.

0711.1815	using quantitative spectroscopic analysis to determine the properties  and distances of type ii-plateau supernovae: sne 2005cs and 2006bp	we analyze the type ii plateau supernovae (sn ii-p) 2005cs and 2006bp withthe non-lte model atmosphere code cmfgen. we fit 13 spectra in the first monthfor sn 2005cs and 18 for sn 2006bp. {\sl swift} ultraviolet photometry andground-based optical photometry calibrate each spectrum. our analysis showsboth objects were discovered less than 3 days after they exploded, making thesethe earliest sn ii-p spectra ever studied. they reveal broad and very weaklines from highly-ionized fast ejecta with an extremely steep density profile.we identify he{\sc ii} 4686\aa emission in the sn 2006bp ejecta. days later,the spectra resemble the prototypical type ii-p sn 1999em, which had asupergiant-like photospheric composition. despite the association of sn 2005cswith possible x-ray emission, the emergent uv and optical light comes from thephotosphere, not from circumstellar emission.  we surmise that the very steep density fall-off we infer at early times maybe a fossil of the combined actions of the shock wave passage and radiationdriving at shock breakout. based on tailored cmfgen models, the direct-fittingtechnique and the expanding photosphere method both yield distances andexplosion times that agree within a few percent. we derive a distance to ngc5194, the host of sn 2005cs, of 8.9$\pm$0.5 mpc and 17.5$\pm$0.8 mpc for sn2006bp in ngc 3953. the luminosity of sn 2006bp is 1.5 times that of sn 1999em,and 6 times that of sn 2005cs. reliable distances to type ii-p supernovae thatdo not depend on a small range in luminosity provide an independent route tothe hubble constant and improved constraints on other cosmological parameters.

0711.2068	type ia supernovae are good standard candles in the near infrared:  evidence from pairitel	we have obtained 1087 nir (jhks) measurements of 21 sne ia using pairitel,nearly doubling the number of well-sampled nir sn ia light curves. these datastrengthen the evidence that sne ia are excellent standard candles in the nir,even without correction for optical light-curve shape. we construct fiducialnir templates for normal sne ia from our sample, excluding only the three knownpeculiar sne ia: sn 2005bl, sn 2005hk, and sn 2005ke. the h-band absolutemagnitudes in this sample of 18 sne ia have an intrinsic rms of only 0.15 magwith no correction for light-curve shape. we found a relationship between theh-band extinction and optical color excess of ah=0.2e(b-v). this variation isas small as the scatter in distance modulus measurements currently used forcosmology based on optical light curves after corrections for light-curveshape. combining the homogeneous pairitel measurements with 23 sne ia from theliterature, these 41 sne ia have standard h-band magnitudes with an rms scatterof 0.16 mag. the good match of our sample with the literature sample suggeststhere are few systematic problems with the photometry. we present a nearby nirhubble diagram that shows no correlation of the residuals from the hubble linewith light-curve properties. future samples that account for optical and nirlight-curve shapes, absorption, spectroscopic variation, or host-galaxyproperties may reveal effective ways to improve the use of sne ia as distanceindicators. since systematic errors due to dust absorption in optical bandsremain the leading difficulty in the cosmological use of supernovae, the goodbehavior of sn ia nir light curves and their relative insensitivity toreddening make these objects attractive candidates for future cosmologicalwork.

1212.5051	the morphology of the ejecta in supernova 1987a: a study over time and  wavelength	we present a study of the morphology of the ejecta in supernova 1987a basedon images and spectra from the hst as well as integral field spectroscopy fromvlt/sinfoni. the hst observations were obtained between 1994 - 2011 andprimarily probe the outer hydrogen-rich zones of the ejecta. the sinfoniobservations were obtained in 2005 and 2011 and instead probe the [si i]/[feii] emission from the inner regions. we find a strong temporal evolution of themorphology in the hst images, from a roughly elliptical shape before ~5,000days, to a more irregular, edge-brightened morphology thereafter. thistransition is a natural consequence of the change in the dominant energy sourcepowering the ejecta, from radioactive decay before ~5,000 days to x-ray inputfrom the circumstellar interaction thereafter. the [si i]/[fe ii] imagesdisplay a more uniform morphology, which may be due to a remaining significantcontribution from radioactivity in the inner ejecta and the higher abundance ofthese elements in the core. both the h-alpha and the [si i]/[fe ii] lineprofiles show that the ejecta are distributed fairly close to the plane of theinner circumstellar ring, which is assumed to define the rotational axis of theprogenitor. the h-alpha emission extends to higher velocities than [si i]/[feii] as expected. there is no clear symmetry axis for all the emission and weare unable to model the ejecta distribution with a simple ellipsoid model witha uniform distribution of dust. instead, we find that the emission isconcentrated to clumps and that the emission is distributed somewhat closer tothe ring in the north than in the south. this north-south asymmetry may bepartially explained by dust absorption. we compare our results with explosionmodels and find some qualitative agreement, but note that the observations showa higher degree of large-scale asymmetry.

1212.5052	late spectral evolution of the ejecta and reverse shock in sn1987a	we present observations with vlt and hst of the broad emission lines from theinner ejecta and reverse shock of sn 1987a from 1999 until 2012 (days 4381 --9100 after explosion). we detect broad lines from h-alpha, h-beta, mg i], na i,[o i], [ca ii] and a feature at 9220 a. we identify the latter line with mg ii9218, 9244,most likely pumped by ly-alpha fluorescence. h-alpha, and h-betaboth have a centrally peaked component, extending to 4500 km/s and a very broadcomponent extending to 11,000 km/s, while the other lines have only the centralcomponent. the low velocity component comes from unshocked ejecta, heatedmainly by x-rays from the circumstellar ring collision, whereas the broadcomponent comes from faster ejecta passing through the reverse shock. thereverse shock flux in h-alpha has increased by a factor of 4-6 from 2000 to2007. after that there is a tendency of flattening of the light curve, similarto what may be seen in soft x-rays and in the optical lines from the shockedring. the core component seen in h-alpha, [ca ii] and mg ii has experienced asimilar increase, consistent with that found from hst photometry. the ring-likemorphology of the ejecta is explained as a result of the x-ray illumination,depositing energy outside of the core of the ejecta. the energy deposition inthe ejecta of the external x-rays illumination is calculated using explosionmodels for sn 1987a and we predict that the outer parts of the unshocked ejectawill continue to brighten because of this. we finally discuss evidence for dustin the ejecta from line asymmetries.

1302.3537	high-velocity line forming regions in the type ia supernova 2009ig	we report measurements and analysis of high-velocity (&gt; 20,000 km/s) andphotospheric absorption features in a series of spectra of the type iasupernova (sn) 2009ig obtained between -14d and +13d with respect to the timeof maximum b-band luminosity. we identify lines of si ii, si iii, s ii, ca iiand fe ii that produce both high-velocity (hvf) and photospheric-velocity (pvf)absorption features. sn 2009ig is unusual for the large number of lines withdetectable hvf in the spectra, but the light-curve parameters correspond to aslightly overluminous but unexceptional sn ia (m_b = -19.46 mag and delta_m15(b) = 0.90 mag). similarly, the si ii lambda_6355 velocity at the time of b-maxis greater than "normal" for a sn ia, but it is not extreme (v_si = 13,400km/s). the -14d and -13d spectra clearly resolve hvf from si ii lambda_6355 asseparate absorptions from a detached line forming region. at these very earlyphases, detached hvf are prevalent in all lines. from -12d to -6d, hvf and pvfare detected simultaneously, and the two line forming regions maintain aconstant separation of about 8,000 km/s. after -6d all absorption features arepvf. the observations of sn 2009ig provide a complete picture of the transitionfrom hvf to pvf. most sn ia show evidence for hvf from multiple lines inspectra obtained before -10d, and we compare the spectra of sn 2009ig toobservations of other sn. we show that each of the unusual line profiles for siii lambda_6355 found in early-time spectra of sn ia correlate to a specificphase in a common development sequence from hvf to pvf.

1302.4479	metallicity differences in type ia supernova progenitors inferred from  ultraviolet spectra	two "twin" type ia supernovae (sne ia), sne 2011by and 2011fe, have extremelysimilar optical light-curve shapes, colors, and spectra, yet have differentultraviolet (uv) continua as measured in hubble space telescope spectra andmeasurably different peak luminosities. we attribute the difference in the uvcontinua to significantly different progenitor metallicities. this is the firstrobust detection of different metallicities for sn ia progenitors. theoreticalreasoning suggests that differences in metallicity also lead to differences inluminosity. sne ia with higher progenitor metallicities have lower 56ni yields,and lower luminosities, for the same light-curve shape. sne 2011by and 2011fehave different peak luminosities (delta m_v = 0.6 mag), which correspond todifferent 56ni yields: m_11fe(56ni)/m_11by(56ni) = 1.7^+0.7_-0.5. fromtheoretical models that account for different neutron to proton ratios inprogenitors, the differences in 56ni yields for sne 2011by and 2011fe implythat their progenitor stars were above and below solar metallicity,respectively. although we can distinguish progenitor metallicities in aqualitative way from uv data, the quantitative interpretation in terms ofabundances is limited by the present state of theoretical models.

1304.0768	the discovery of the most distant known type ia supernova at redshift  1.914	we present the discovery of a type ia supernova (sn) at redshift $z = 1.914$from the candels multi-cycle treasury program on the \textit{hubble spacetelescope (hst)}. this sn was discovered in the infrared using the wide-fieldcamera 3, and it is the highest-redshift type ia sn yet observed. we classifythis object as a sn\,ia by comparing its light curve and spectrum with those ofa large sample of type ia and core-collapse supernovae (sne). its apparentmagnitude is consistent with that expected from the $\lambda$cdm concordancecosmology. we discuss the use of spectral evidence for classification of $z &gt;1.5$ sne\,ia using {\it hst} grism simulations, finding that spectral dataalone can frequently rule out sne\,ii, but distinguishing between sne\,ia andsne\,ib/c can require prohibitively long exposures. in such cases, aquantitative analysis of the light curve may be necessary for classification.our photometric and spectroscopic classification methods can aid thedetermination of sn rates and cosmological parameters from the fullhigh-redshift candels sn sample.

1312.6617	high density circumstellar interaction in the luminous type iin sn  2010jl: the first 1100 days	hst and ground based observations of the type iin sn 2010jl are analyzed,including photometry, spectroscopy in the ultraviolet, optical and nir bands,26-1128 days after first detection. at maximum the bolometric luminosity was$\sim 3\times10^{43}$ erg/s and even at 850 days exceeds $10^{42}$ erg/s. a nirexcess, dominating after 400 days, probably originates in dust in thecircumstellar medium (csm). the total radiated energy is $&gt; 6.5\times10^{50}$ergs, excluding the dust component. the spectral lines can be separated intoone broad component due to electron scattering, and one narrow with expansionvelocity $\sim 100$ km/s from the csm. the broad component is initiallysymmetric around zero velocity but becomes blueshifted after $\sim 50$ days,while remaining symmetric about a shifted centroid velocity. dust absorption inthe ejecta is unlikely to explain the line shifts, and we attribute the shiftinstead to acceleration by the sn radiation. from the optical lines and thex-ray and dust properties, there is strong evidence for large scale asymmetriesin the csm. the ultraviolet lines indicate cno processing in the progenitor,while the optical shows a number of narrow coronal lines excited by the x-rays.the bolometric light curve is consistent with a radiative shock in an $r^{-2}$csm with a mass loss rate of $\sim 0.1$ m_sun/yr. the total mass lost is $&gt; 3$m_sun. these properties are consistent with the sn expanding into a csmcharacteristic of an lbv progenitor with a bipolar geometry. the apparentabsence of nuclear processing is attributed to a csm still opaque to electronscattering.

1401.7978	type ia supernova rate measurements to redshift 2.5 from candels :  searching for prompt explosions in the early universe	the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey (candels)was a multi-cycle treasury program on the hubble space telescope (hst) thatsurveyed a total area of ~0.25 deg^2 with ~900 hst orbits spread across 5fields over 3 years. within these survey images we discovered 65 supernovae(sn) of all types, out to z~2.5. we classify ~24 of these as type ia sn (sn ia)based on host-galaxy redshifts and sn photometry (supplemented by grismspectroscopy of 6 sn). here we present a measurement of the volumetric sn iarate as a function of redshift, reaching for the first time beyond z=2 andputting new constraints on sn ia progenitor models. our highest redshift binincludes detections of sn that exploded when the universe was only ~3 gyr oldand near the peak of the cosmic star-formation history. this gives the candelshigh-redshift sample unique leverage for evaluating the fraction of sn ia thatexplode promptly after formation (&lt;500 myr). combining the candels rates withall available sn ia rate measurements in the literature we find that thisprompt sn ia fraction is fp=0.53 +0.09 -0.10 (stat) +0.10 -0.26 (sys),consistent with a delay time distribution that follows a simple t^{-1} powerlaw for all times t&gt;40 myr. however, a mild tension is apparent betweenground-based low-z surveys and space-based high-z surveys. in both candels andthe sister hst program clash, we find a low rate of sn ia at z&gt;1. this could bea hint that prompt progenitors are in fact relatively rare, accounting for only~20% of all sn ia explosions -- though further analysis and larger samples willbe needed to examine that suggestion.

1402.7079	type ia supernova colors and ejecta velocities: hierarchical bayesian  regression with non-gaussian distributions	we investigate the statistical dependence of the peak intrinsic colors oftype ia supernovae (sn ia) on their expansion velocities at maximum light,measured from the si ii 6355 spectral feature. we construct a new hierarchicalbayesian regression model, accounting for the random effects of intrinsicscatter, measurement error, and reddening by host galaxy dust, and implement agibbs sampler and deviance information criteria to estimate the correlation.the method is applied to the apparent colors from bvri light curves and si iivelocity data for 79 nearby sne ia. the apparent color distributions of high(hv) and normal velocity (nv) supernovae exhibit significant discrepancies forb-v and b-r, but not other colors. hence, they are likely due to intrinsiccolor differences originating in the b-band, rather than dust reddening. themean intrinsic b-v and b-r color differences between hv and nv groups are 0.06+/- 0.02 and 0.09 +/- 0.02 mag, respectively. a linear model finds significantslopes of -0.021 +/- 0.006 and -0.030 +/- 0.009 mag/(1000 km/s) for intrinsicb-v and b-r colors versus velocity, respectively. since the ejecta velocitydistribution is skewed towards high velocities, these effects implynon-gaussian intrinsic color distributions with skewness up to +0.3. accountingfor the intrinsic color-velocity correlation results in corrections to a_vextinction estimates as large as -0.12 mag for hv sne ia and +0.06 mag for nvevents. velocity measurements from sn ia spectra have potential to diminishsystematic errors from the confounding of intrinsic colors and dust reddeningaffecting supernova distances.

1408.1089	a luminous, blue progenitor system for a type-iax supernova	type-iax supernovae (sn iax) are stellar explosions that arespectroscopically similar to some type-ia supernovae (sn ia) at maximum light,except with lower ejecta velocities. they are also distinguished by lowerluminosities. at late times, their spectroscopic properties diverge from othersn, but their composition (dominated by iron-group and intermediate-masselements) suggests a physical connection to normal sn ia. these are not rare;sn iax occur at a rate between 5 and 30% of the normal sn ia rate. the leadingmodels for sn iax are thermonuclear explosions of accreting carbon-oxygen whitedwarfs that do not completely unbind the star, implying they are "lesssuccessful" cousins of normal sn ia, where complete disruption is observed.here we report the detection of the luminous, blue progenitor system of thetype-iax sn 2012z in deep pre-explosion imaging. its luminosity, colors,environment, and similarity to the progenitor of the galactic helium nova v445puppis, suggest that sn 2012z was the explosion of a white dwarf accreting froma helium-star companion. observations in the next few years, after sn 2012z hasfaded, could test this hypothesis, or alternatively show that this supernovawas actually the explosive death of a massive star.

1502.05403	mapping high-velocity h-alpha and lyman-alpha emission from supernova  1987a	we present new {\it hubble space telescope} images of high-velocityh-$\alpha$ and lyman-$\alpha$ emission in the outer debris of sn~1987a. theh-$\alpha$ images are dominated by emission from hydrogen atoms crossing thereverse shock. for the first time we observe emission from the reverse shocksurface well above and below the equatorial ring, suggesting a bipolar orconical structure perpendicular to the ring plane. using the h$\alpha$ imaging,we measure the mass flux of hydrogen atoms crossing the reverse shock front, inthe velocity intervals ($-$7,500~$&lt;$~$v_{obs}$~$&lt;$~$-$2,800 km s$^{-1}$) and(1,000~$&lt;$~$v_{obs}$~$&lt;$~7,500 km s$^{-1}$), $\dot{m_{h}}$ =1.2~$\times$~10$^{-3}$ m$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. we also present the firstlyman-$\alpha$ imaging of the whole remnant and new $chandra$ x-rayobservations. comparing the spatial distribution of the lyman-$\alpha$ andx-ray emission, we observe that the majority of the high-velocitylyman-$\alpha$ emission originates interior to the equatorial ring. theobserved lyman-$\alpha$/h-$\alpha$ photon ratio, $\langle$$r(l\alpha /h\alpha)$$\rangle$ $\approx$~17, is significantly higher than the theoreticallypredicted ratio of $\approx$ 5 for neutral atoms crossing the reverse shockfront. we attribute this excess to lyman-$\alpha$ emission produced by x-rayheating of the outer debris. the spatial orientation of the lyman-$\alpha$ andx-ray emission suggests that x-ray heating of the outer debris is the dominantlyman-$\alpha$ production mechanism in sn 1987a at this phase in its evolution.

astro-ph;0001384	tests of the accelerating universe with near-infrared observations of a  high-redshift type ia supernova	we have measured the rest-frame b,v, and i-band light curves of ahigh-redshift type ia supernova (sn ia), sn 1999q (z=0.46), using hst andground-based near-infrared detectors.  a goal of this study is the measurement of the color excess, e_{b-i}, whichis a sensitive indicator of interstellar or intergalactic dust which couldaffect recent cosmological measurements from high-redshift sne ia. ourobservations disfavor a 30% opacity of sn ia visual light by dust as analternative to an accelerating universe. this statement applies to bothgalactic-type dust  (rejected at the 3.4 sigma confidence level) and greyer dust (grain size &gt;0.1 microns; rejected at the 2.3 to 2.6 sigma confidence level) as proposed byaguirre (1999). the rest-frame $i$-band light cur ve shows the secondarymaximum a month after b maximum typical of nearby sne ia of normal luminosi ty,providing no indication of evolution as a function of redshift out to z~0.5. an expanded set of similar observations could improve the constraints on anycontribution of extragalactic dust to the dimming of high-redshift sne ia.

astro-ph;0001476	young stellar populations around sn1987a	we present the results of a study of the stellar population in a region of 30pc radius around sn1987a, based on an analysis of multi-band hst-wfpc2 images.  the effective temperature, radius and, possibly, reddening of each star weredetermined for 21,955 stars by fitting the measured broad band magnitudes tothe ones calculated with model atmospheres. in addition, we have identified allstars with halpha equivalent widths in excess of 8 a, amounting to a total of492 stars.  an inspection to the hr diagram reveals the presence of several generationsof young stars, with ages between 1 and 150 myrs, superposed on a much olderfield population (0.6-6 gyrs). a substantial fraction of young stars have agesaround 12 myrs which is the stellar generation coeval to sn 1987a progenitor.the youngest stars in the field appear to be strong-line t tauri stars. thisconstitute the first positive detection of low mass (about 1-2 mo) pre mainsequence (pms) stars outside the milky way. their positions in the hr diagramappear to require that star formation in the lmc occurs with accretion ratesabout 10 times higher than in the milky way, i.e. ~10^{-4} mo/yr.  sn1987a appears to belong to a loose, young cluster 12+/-2 myrs old, in whichthe slope of the present mass function is almost identical to salpeter's formasses above 3 mo, but becomes much flatter for lower masses. on a large scale,we find that the spatial distribution of massive stars and low-mass pms starsare conclusively different. this results casts doubts on the validity of an imfconcept on a small scale (say, less than 10 pc). a preliminary analysis, donefor the whole field as a single entity, shows that the imf slope for the youngpopulation present over the entire region is steeper than gamma ~ -1.7.

astro-ph;0105490	the luminosity of sn 1999by in ngc 2841 and the nature of `peculiar'  type ia supernovae	we present ubvrijhk photometry and optical spectroscopy of the so-called'peculiar' type ia supernova 1999by in ngc 2841. the observations began oneweek before visual maximum light which is well-defined by daily observations.the light curves and spectra are similar to those of the prototypicalsubluminous event sn 1991bg. we find that maximum light in b occurred on 1999may 10.3 ut (jd 2,451,308.8 +/- 0.3) with b=13.66 +/- 0.02 mag and a color ofb_max-v_max=0.51 +/- 0.03 mag. the late-time color implies minimal dustextinction from the host galaxy. our photometry, when combined with the recentcepheid distance to ngc 2841 (macri et al. 2001), gives a peak absolutemagnitude of m_b=-17.15 +/- 0.23 mag, making sn 1999by one of the leastluminous type ia events ever observed. we estimate a decline rate parameter ofdm15(b)=1.90 mag, versus 1.93 for sn 1991bg, where 1.10 is typical forso-called 'normal' events. we compare sn 1999by with other subluminous eventsand find that the b_max-v_max color correlates strongly with the decline rateand may be a more sensitive indicator of luminosity than the fading rate forthese objects. we find a good correlation between luminosity and the depth ofthe spectral feature at 580 nm, which had been attributed solely to si ii. weshow that in cooler photospheres the 580 nm feature is dominated by ti ii,which provides a simple physical explanation for the correlation. using onlysubluminous type ia supernovae we derive a hubble parameter of h_0=75 +12 -11km/s mpc, consistent with values found from brighter events.

astro-ph;0203346	modelling the hubble space telescope ultraviolet and optical spectrum of  spot 1 on the circumstellar ring of sn 1987a	we report and interpret hst/stis long-slit observations of the optical andultraviolet (1150 - 10270 angstrom) emission-line spectra of the rapidlybrightening spot 1 on the equatorial ring of sn 1987a between 1997 septemberand 1999 october (days 3869 -- 4606 after outburst). the emission is caused byradiative shocks created where the supernova blast wave strikes dense gasprotruding inward from the equatorial ring. we measure and tabulate lineidentifications, fluxes and, in some cases, line widths and shifts. we computeflux correction factors to account for substantial interstellar line absorptionof several emission lines. nebular analysis shows that optical emission linescome from a region of cool (t_e ~ 10^4 k) and dense (n_e ~ 10^6 cm^-3) gas inthe compressed photoionized layer behind the radiative shock. the observed linewidths indicate that only shocks with shock velocities v_s &lt; 250 km/s havebecome radiative, while line ratios indicate that much of the emission musthave come from yet slower (v_s &lt; 135 k/ms) shocks. we are able to fit the uvfluxes with an idealized radiative shock model consisting of two shocks (v_s =135 and 250 km/s). the observed uv flux increase with time can be explained bythe increase in shock surface areas as the blast wave overtakes more of theprotrusion. the observed flux ratios of optical to highly-ionized uv lines aregreater by a factor of ~ 2 -- 3 than predictions from the radiative shockmodels and we discuss the possible causes. we also present models for theobserved h-alpha line widths and profiles, which suggests that a chaotic flowexists in the photoionized regions of these shocks. we discuss what can belearned with future observations of all the spots present on the equatorialring.

(2001, 2002) in light ofthese results. following the same procedures, but using the new data presentedhere, we arrive at a less restrictive upper mass limit of 15^{+5}_{-3} m_{sun}for the progenitor. the increased upper limit results mainly from the largerdistance derived through the epm than was assumed by the smartt et al.analyses, which relied on less precise (and less recent) distance measurementsto ngc 3184.

(1998a) and perlmutter et al. (1999) that supernovaluminosity distances imply an accelerating universe. more importantly, theyextend the redshift range of consistently observed sn ia to z~1, where thesignature of cosmological effects has the opposite sign of some plausiblesystematic effects. consequently, these measurements not only provide anotherquantitative confirmation of the importance of dark energy, but also constitutea powerful qualitative test for the cosmological origin of cosmic acceleration.we find a rate for sn ia of 1.4+/-0.5e-04 h^3/mpc^3/yr at a mean redshift of0.5. we present distances and host extinctions for 230 sn ia. these place thefollowing constraints on cosmological quantities: if the equation of stateparameter of the dark energy is w=-1, then h0 t0 = 0.96+/-0.04, and o_l - 1.4o_m = 0.35+/-0.14. including the constraint of a flat universe, we find o_m =0.28+/-0.05, independent of any large-scale structure measurements. adopting aprior based on the 2df redshift survey constraint on o_m and assuming a flatuniverse, we find that the equation of state parameter of the dark energy liesin the range -1.48&lt;w&lt;-0.72 at 95% confidence. if we further assume that w&gt;-1,we obtain w&lt;-0.73 at 95% confidence. these constraints are similar in precisionand in value to recent results reported using the wmap satellite, also incombination with the 2df redshift survey.

astro-ph;0409338	the late-time light curve of the type ia supernova 2000cx	we have conducted a systematic and comprehensive monitoring programme of thetype ia supernova 2000cx at late phases using the vlt and hst. the vltobservations cover phases 360 to 480 days past maximum brightness and includephotometry in the bvrijh bands, together with a single epoch in each of u andks. while the optical bands decay by about 1.4 mag per 100 days, we find thatthe near-ir magnitudes stay virtually constant during the observed period. thismeans that the importance of the near-ir to the bolometric light curveincreases with time. the finding is also in agreement with our detailedmodeling of a type ia supernova in the nebular phase. in these models, theincreased importance of the near-ir is a temperature effect. we note that thiscomplicates late-time studies where often only the v band is well monitored. inparticular, it is not correct to assume that any optical band follows thebolometric light curve at these phases, and any conclusions based on suchassumptions, e.g., regarding positron-escape, must be regarded as premature. avery simple model where all positrons are trapped can reasonably well accountfor the observations. the nickel mass deduced from the positron tail of thislight curve is lower than found from the peak brightness, providing an estimateof the fraction of late-time emission that is outside of the observedwavelength range. our detailed models show the signature of an infraredcatastrophe at these epochs, which is not supported by the observations.

astro-ph;0503159	cepheid calibrations from the hubble space telescope of the luminosity  of two recent type ia supernovae and a re-determination of the hubble  constant	we report observations of two nearby type ia supernovae (sne ia) for whichobservations of cepheid variables in the host galaxies have been obtained withthe hubble space telescope: sn 1994ae in ngc 3370 and sn 1998aq in ngc 3982.for ncg 3370, we used the advanced camera for surveys to observe 64 cepheidsthat yield a distance of 29 mpc, the farthest direct measurement of cepheids.we have measured emission lines from h ii regions in both host galaxies whichprovide metallicity-dependent corrections to their period-luminosity relations.these two sne ia double the sample of ``ideal'' luminosity calibrators: objectswith well-observed and well-calibrated light curves of typical shape and withlow reddening. by comparing them to all similarly well-measured sne ia in thehubble flow, we find that h_0 = 73 +/- 4 (statistical) +/- 5 (systematic). adetailed analysis demonstrates that most of the past disagreement over thevalue of h_0 as determined from sne ia is abated by the replacement of past,problematic data by more accurate and precise, modern data.

astro-ph;0601495	sn 1987a after 18 years: mid-infrared gemini and spitzer observations of  the remnant	we present high resolution 11.7 and 18.3um mid-ir images of sn 1987a obtainedon day 6526 with t-recs attached to the gemini telescope. the 11.7um flux hasincreased significantly since our last observations on day 6067. the imagesclearly show that all the emission arises from the equatorial ring (er).spectra obtained with spitzer, on day 6184 with mips at 24um, on day 6130 withirac in the 3.6-8um region, and on day 6190 with irs in the 12-37um region showthat the emission consists of thermal emission from silicate dust thatcondensed out in the red giant wind of the progenitor star. the dusttemperature is ~166k, and the emitting dust mass is ~2.6 x 10-6 msun. lines of[ne ii]12.82um and [ne iii]15.56um are clearly present, as well as a weak [siii]34.8um line. we also detect two lines near 26um which we tentatively ascribeto [fe ii]25.99um and [o iv]25.91um. comparison of the gemini 11.7um image withx-ray images from chandra, uv-optical images from hst, and radio synchrotronimages obtained by the atca show generally good correlation of the imagesacross all wavelengths. because of the limited resolution of the mid-ir imageswe cannot uniquely determine the location or heating mechanism of the dustgiving rise to the emission. the dust could be collisionally heated by thex-ray emitting plasma, providing a unique diagnostic of plasma conditions.alternatively, the dust could be radiatively heated in the dense uv-opticalknots that are overrun by the advancing supernova blast wave. in either casethe dust-to-gas mass ratio in the circumstellar medium around the supernova issignificantly lower than that in the general ism of the lmc, suggesting eithera low condensation efficiency in the wind of the progenitor star, or theefficient destruction of the dust by the sn blast wave.

astro-ph;0603151	evolution of the reverse shock emission from snr 1987a	we present new (2004 july) g750l and g140l space telescope imagingspectrograph (stis) data of the h-alpha and ly-alpha emission from supernovaremnant (snr) 1987a. with the aid of earlier data, from oct 1997 to oct 2002,we track the local evolution of ly-alpha emission and both the local and globalevolution of h-alpha emission. in addition to emission which we can clearlyattribute to the surface of the reverse shock, we also measure comparableemission, in both h-alpha and ly-alpha, which appears to emerge from supernovadebris interior to the surface. new observations taken through slits positionedslightly eastward and westward of a central slit show a departure fromcylindrical symmetry in the h-alpha surface emission. using a combination ofold and new observations, we construct a light curve of the total h-alpha flux,f, from the reverse shock, which has increased by a factor ~ 4 over about 8years. however, due to large systematic uncertainties, we are unable to discernbetween the two limiting behaviours of the flux - f ~ t (self-similarexpansion) and f ~ t^5 (halting of the reverse shock). such a determination isrelevant to the question of whether the reverse shock emission will vanish inless than about 7 years (smith et al. 2005). future deep, low- ormoderate-resolution spectra are essential for accomplishing this task.

astro-ph;0611572	new hubble space telescope discoveries of type ia supernovae at z &gt; 1:  narrowing constraints on the early behavior of dark energy	we have discovered 21 new type ia supernovae (sne ia) with the hubble spacetelescope (hst) and have used them to trace the history of cosmic expansionover the last 10 billion years. these objects, which include 13spectroscopically confirmed sne ia at z &gt; 1, were discovered during 14 epochsof reimaging of the goods fields north and south over two years with theadvanced camera for surveys on hst. together with a recalibration of ourprevious hst-discovered sne ia, the full sample of 23 sne ia at z &gt; 1 providesthe highest-redshift sample known. combined with previous sn ia datasets, wemeasured h(z) at discrete, uncorrelated epochs, reducing the uncertainty ofh(z&gt;1) from 50% to under 20%, strengthening the evidence for a cosmic jerk--thetransition from deceleration in the past to acceleration in the present. theunique leverage of the hst high-redshift sne ia provides the first meaningfulconstraint on the dark energy equation-of-state parameter at z &gt;1.  the result remains consistent with a cosmological constant (w(z)=-1), andrules out rapidly evolving dark energy (dw/dz &gt;&gt;1). the defining property ofdark energy, its negative pressure, appears to be present at z&gt;1, in the epochpreceding acceleration, with ~98% confidence in our primary fit. moreover, thez&gt;1 sample-averaged spectral energy distribution is consistent with that of thetypical sn ia over the last 10 gyr, indicating that any spectral evolution ofthe properties of sne ia with redshift is still below our detection threshold.

astro-ph;0612541	early ultraviolet, optical and x-ray observations of the type iip sn  2005cs in m51 with swift	we report early photospheric-phase observations of the type iip supernova(sn) 2005cs obtained by swift's ultraviolet-optical and x-ray telescopes.observations started within two days of discovery and continued regularly forthree weeks. during this time the v-band magnitude remained essentiallyconstant, while the uv was initially bright but steadily faded until below thebrightness of an underlying uv-bright hii region. this uv decay is similar tosne ii observed by the international ultraviolet explorer. uv grism spectrashow the p-cygni absorption of mgii 2798a, indicating a photospheric origin ofthe uv flux. based on non-lte model atmosphere calculations with the cmfgencode, we associate the rapid evolution of the uv flux with the cooling of theejecta, the peak of the spectral energy distribution (sed) shifting from ~700aon june 30th to ~1200a on july 5th. furthermore, the correspondingrecombination of the ejecta, e.g., the transition from feiii to feii, inducesconsiderable strengthening of metal line-blanketing at and above thephotosphere, blocking more effectively this fading uv flux. sn2005cs was notdetected in x-rays, and the upper limit to the x-ray luminosity yields a limitto the mass loss rate of the progenitor of about 10^-5 solar masses per year.overall, swift presents a unique opportunity to capture the early and fastevolution of type ii sne in the uv, providing additional constraints on thereddening, the sed shortward of 4000a, and the ionization state and temperatureof the photon-decoupling regions.

astro-ph;0612666	improved distances to type ia supernovae with multicolor light curve  shapes: mlcs2k2	we present an updated version of the multicolor light curve shape method tomeasure distances to type ia supernovae (sn ia), incorporating new proceduresfor k-correction and extinction corrections. we also develop a simple model todisentangle intrinsic color variations and reddening by dust, and expand themethod to incorporate u-band light curves and to more easily accommodate priorconstraints on any of the model parameters. we apply this method to 133 nearbysn ia, including 95 objects in the hubble flow (cz &gt;= 2500 km/s), which give anintrinsic dispersion of less than 7% in distance. the hubble flow sample, whichis of critical importance to all cosmological uses of sn ia, is the largestever presented with homogeneous distances. we find the hubble flow supernovaewith hd &gt;= 7400 km/s yield an expansion rate that is 6.5 +/- 1.8% lower thanthe rate determined from supernovae within that distance, and this can have alarge effect on measurements of the dark energy equation of state with sn ia.peculiar velocities of sn ia host galaxies in the rest frame of the local groupare consistent with the dipole measured in the cosmic microwave background.direct fits of sn ia that are significantly reddened by dust in their hostgalaxies suggest their mean extinction law may be described by r_v ~= 2.7, butoptical colors alone provide weak constraints on r_v.

astro-ph;9407097	sn~1991t: reflections of past glory	we have obtained photometry and spectra of sn~1991t which extend more than1000 days past maximum light, by far the longest a sn~ia has been followed.although sn~1991t exhibited nearly normal photometric behavior in the first 400days following maximum, by 600 days its decline had slowed, and by 950~days thesupernova brightness was consistent with a constant apparent magnitude of$m_b=21.30$. spectra near maximum showed minor variations on the sn~ia themewhich grew less conspicuous during the exponential decline. at 270 days thenebular spectrum was composed of fe and co lines common to sne~ia. however, by750 days past maximum light, these lines had shifted in wavelength, and weresuperimposed on a strong blue continuum. the luminosity of sn~1991t at 950 daysis more than $9.0\times10^{38}(d/13~{\rm mpc})^2$~ergs~s$^{-1}$ with a rate ofdecline of less than $0.04$ mags/100~days. we show that this emission is likelyto be light that was emitted by sn~1991t near maximum light which has reflectedfrom foreground dust, much like the light echos observed around sn~1987a.

astro-ph;9412017	determining the motion of the local group using sn ia light curve shapes	we have measured our galaxy's motion relative to distant galaxies in whichtype ia supernovae (sn ia) have been observed. the effective recession velocityof this sample is 7000 km s$^{-1}$, which approaches the depth of the survey ofbrightest cluster galaxies by lauer and postman (1994). we use the light curveshape (lcs) method for deriving distances to sn ia, providing relative distanceestimates to individual supernovae with a precision of $\sim$ 5\% (riess,press, \&amp; kirshner 1995). analyzing the distribution on the sky of velocityresiduals from a pure hubble flow for 13 recent sn ia drawn primarily from thecal\'{a}n/tololo survey (hamuy 1993a, 1994, 1995a, 1995b, maza et al. 1994), wefind the best solution for the motion of the local group in this frame is 600$\pm 350$ km s$^{-1}$ in the direction b=260$\deg$ {\it l}=+54$\deg$ with a 1$\sigma$ error ellipse that measures 90$\deg$ by 25$\deg$. this solution isconsistent with the rest frame of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) asdetermined by the cosmic background explorer (cobe) measurement of the dipoletemperature anisotropy (smoot et al. 1992). it is inconsistent with thevelocity observed by lauer and postman.

astro-ph;9602064	the luminosity function of galaxies in the las campanas redshift survey	we present the $r$-band luminosity function for a sample of 18678 galaxies,with average redshift $z = 0.1$, from the las campanas redshift survey. theluminosity function may be fit by a schechter function with $m^* = -20.29 \pm0.02 + 5 \log h$, $\alpha = -0.70 \pm 0.05$, and $\phi^* = 0.019 \pm 0.001 \h^3$~mpc$^{-3}$, for absolute magnitudes $-23.0 \leq m - 5 \log h \leq -17.5$.we compare our luminosity function to that from other redshift surveys; inparticular our normalization is consistent with that of the stromlo-apm survey,and is therefore a factor of two below that implied by the $b_j \approx 20$bright galaxy counts. our normalization thus indicates that much more evolutionis needed to match the faint galaxy count data, compared to minimal evolutionmodels which normalize at $b_j \approx 20$. also, we show that our faint-endslope $\alpha = -0.7$, though ``shallower'' than typical previous values$\alpha = -1$, results primarily from fitting the detailed shape of the lcrsluminosity function, rather than from any absence of intrinsically faintgalaxies from our survey. finally, using [oii] 3727 equivalent width$w_{\lambda} = 5$~\aa \ as the dividing line, we find significant differencesin the luminosity functions of emission and non-emission galaxies, particularlyin their $\alpha$ values. emission galaxies have schechter parameters $m^* =-20.03 \pm 0.03 + 5 \log h$ and $\alpha = -0.9 \pm 0.1$, while non-emissiongalaxies are described by $m^* = -20.22 \pm 0.02 + 5 \log h$ and $\alpha = -0.3\pm 0.1$.

astro-ph;9602157	hubble space telescope spectroscopic observations of the ejecta of sn  1987a at 2000 days	we have used the faint object spectrograph on the hubble space telescope toobserve the spectra of sn 1987a over the wavelength range 2000 -- 8000\ \aa\ ondates 1862 and 2210 days after the supernova outburst. even these pre-costarobservations avoid much of the contamination from the bright stars nearby andprovide a very useful set of line strengths and shapes for analysis. thespectrum is formed in an unusual physical setting: cold gas which is excitedand ionized by energetic electrons from the radioactive debris of the supernovaexplosion. the spectra of sn 1987a at this phase are surprisingly similar tothose of the nova shells of cp puppis and t pyxidis decades after outburst. sn1987a and the novae are characterized by emission from material with electrontemperatures of only a few hundred degrees kelvin, and show narrow balmercontinuum emission and strong emission lines from o$^+$. the balmer continuumshape requires the electron temperature in the supernova ejecta to be as low as500 k on day 1862 and 400 k on day 2210 after outburst. the \oiiuv\ doublet issurprisingly strong and is plausibly powered by collisional ionization ofneutral oxygen to excited states of o$^+$.  the line intensity ratio of the \oid\ doublet obtained from gaussian fits ofthe line profiles is 1.8$\pm0.2$, contrary to the optically thin limit of 3.this ratio is {\it not} due to an optical depth effect, but rather is anartifact of assuming a gaussian profile to fit the \oid\ doublet profile.specifying the line ratio $r\, = \, f([{\rm oi}]6300)/f([{\rm oi}]6364)$ = 3 isconsistent with the data and allows a calculation of the decomposed lineprofile.  all the observed strong lines are found to be blueshifted by a similar amount

astro-ph;9604167	the las campanas redshift survey	the las campanas redshift survey (lcrs) consists of 26418 redshifts ofgalaxies selected from a ccd-based catalog obtained in the $r$ band. the surveycovers over 700 square degrees in 6 strips, each 1.5$\arcdeg$ x 80$\arcdeg$,three each in the north and south galactic caps. the median redshift in thesurvey is about 30000 km~s$^{-1}$. essential features of the galaxy selectionand redshift measurement methods are described and tabulated here. thesedetails are important for subsequent analysis of the lcrs data. two dimensionalrepresentations of the redshift distributions reveal many repetitions of voids,on the scale of about 5000 km~s$^{-1}$, sharply bounded by large walls ofgalaxies as seen in nearby surveys. statistical investigations of the meangalaxy properties and of clustering on the large scale are reported elsewhere.these include studies of the luminosity function, power spectrum in two andthree dimensions, correlation function, pairwise velocity distribution,identification of large scale structures, and a group catalog. the lcrsredshift catalog will be made available to interested investigators at aninternet web site and in archival form as an astrophysical journal cd-rom.

astro-ph;9606055	the power spectrum of galaxy clustering in the las campanas redshift  survey	the las campanas redshift survey (lcrs) contains 23697 galaxies, with anaverage redshift $z = 0.1$, distributed over six $1.5\arcdeg$ by $80\arcdeg$slices in the north and south galactic caps. we have computed the powerspectrum $p(k)$ for lcrs galaxies over wavelengths $\lambda = 2\pi / k = 5 -400\ h^{-1}$~mpc. the lcrs $p(k)$ may be approximated as $\propto k^{-1.8 \pm0.1}$ for small scales $\lambda = 5 - 30\ h^{-1}$~mpc, changing to $\proptok^{1 \pm 1}$ for large scales $\lambda \approx 200 - 400\ h^{-1}$~mpc. theoverall amplitude corresponds to $\sigma_8 = 1.0 \pm 0.1$ in redshift space.comparisons to the power spectra of other redshift surveys will be presented;the lcrs results agree best with those from the combined center forastrophysics and southern sky redshift surveys. we find evidence for type-dependent clustering differences in the lcrs, such that galaxies brighter thanabout $m^* - 1$ appear about 50\% more strongly clustered than those fainter,and that a sample of emission galaxies shows 30\% weaker clustering than thefull lcrs sample. on large scales $\lambda \gtrsim 40\ h^{-1}$~mpc, we havealso fit the lcrs results to various linear cdm models, and find that a numberof them could meet the constraints set by the lcrs power spectrum, the hubbleconstant range $0.5 \lesssim h \lesssim 0.8$, the abundance of galaxy clusters,and the reasonable assumption that lcrs galaxies are roughly unbiased tracersof the mass, relative to the normalization provided by the 4-year cobe dmrdata. the possibilites include open cdm or flat non-zero cosmological-constantcdm models with $\omega_0 \approx 0.4-0.6$ and shape parameter $\gamma \approx0.2-0.3$, as well as flat $\omega_0 = 1$ models with massive neutrino density$\omega_\nu \approx 0.2-0.3$ or a spectral tilt $n \approx 0.7-0.8$.

astro-ph;9711227	spectral classification and luminosity function of galaxies in the las  campanas redshift survey	we construct a spectral classification scheme for the galaxies of the lascampanas redshift survey (lcrs) based on a principal component analysis of themeasured galaxy spectra. we interpret the physical significance of our sixspectral types and conclude that they are sensitive to morphological type andthe amount of active star formation. in this first analysis of the lcrs toinclude spectral classification, we estimate the general luminosity function,expressed as a weighted sum of the type-specific luminosity functions. in ther-band magnitude range of -23 &lt; m &lt;= -16.5, this function exhibits a broadshoulder centered near m = -20, and an increasing faint-end slope whichformally converges on an alpha value of about -1.8 in the faint limit. theschechter parameterization does not provide a good representation in this case,a fact which may partly explain the reported discrepancy between the luminosityfunctions of the lcrs and other redshift catalogs such as the century survey(geller et al. 1997). the discrepancy may also arise from environmental effectssuch as the density-morphology relationship for which we see strong evidence inthe lcrs galaxies. however, the schechter parameterization is more effectivefor the luminosity functions of the individual spectral types. the data show asignificant, progressive steepening of the faint-end slope, from alpha = +0.5for early-type objects, to alpha = -1.8 for the extreme late-type galaxies. theextreme late-type population has a sufficiently high space density that itscontribution to the general luminosity function is expected to dominate fainterthan m = -16. we conclude that an evaluation of type-dependence is essential toany assessment of the general luminosity function.

astro-ph;9802252	a local hubble bubble from sne ia?	we analyze the monopole in the peculiar velocities of 44 type ia supernovae(sne ia) to test for a local void. the sample extends from 20 to 300 mpc/h,with distances, deduced from light-curve shapes, accurate to ~6%. assumingomega_m=1 and omega_lambda=0, the most significant deviation we find from thehubble law is an outwards flow of (6.6+/-2.2)% inside a sphere of radius 70mpc/h as would be produced by a void of ~20% underdensity surrounded by a denseshell. this shell roughly coincides with the local great walls. monte carloanalyses, using gaussian errors or bootstrap resampling, show the probabilityfor chance occurrence of this result out of a pure hubble flow to be ~2%. themonopole could be contaminated by higher moments of the velocity field,especially a quadrupole, which are not properly probed by the current limitedsky coverage. the void would be less significant if omega_m is low andomega_lambda is high. it would be more significant if one outlier is removedfrom the sample, or if the size of the void is constrained a-priori. thisputative void is not in significant conflict with any of the standardcosmological scenarios. it suggests that the hubble constant as determinedwithin 70 mpc/h could be overestimated by ~6% and the local value of omega maybe underestimated by ~20%. while the present evidence for a local void ismarginal in this data set, the analysis shows that the accumulation of sne iadistances will soon provide useful constraints on elusive and important aspectsof regional cosmic dynamics.

astro-ph;9805200	the high-z supernova search: measuring cosmic deceleration and global  cur vature of the universe using type ia supernovae	the high-z supernova search is an international collaboration to discover andmonitor type ia supernovae (sn ia) at $z &gt; 0.2$ with the aim of measuringcosmic deceleration and global curvature. our collaboration has pursued a basicunderstanding of supernovae in the nearby universe, discovering and observing alarge sample of objects, and developing methods to measure accurate distanceswith sn ia. this paper describes the extension of this program to $z \geq 0.2$,outlining our search techniques and follow-up program. we have devisedhigh-throughput filters which provide accurate two-color restframe $b$ and $v$light curves of sn ia, enabling us to produce precise, extinction-correctedluminosity distances in the range $0.25 &lt; z &lt; 0.55$. sources of systematicerror from k-corrections, extinction, selection effects, and evolution areinvestigated, and their effects estimated. we present photometric and spectralobservations of sn 1995k, our program's first supernova, and use the data toobtain a precise measurement of the luminosity distance to the $z=0.479$ hostgalaxy. this object, when combined with a nearby sample of sn, yields anestimate for the matter density of the universe of $\omega_m =-0.2^{+1.0}_{-0.8}$ if $\omega_\lambda = 0$. for a spatially flat universecomposed of normal matter and a cosmological constant, we find $\omega_m =0.4^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$, $\omega_\lambda = 0.6^{+0.4}_{-0.5}$. we demonstrate thatwith a sample of $\sim 30$ objects, we should be able to determine relativeluminosity distances over the range $0 &lt; z&lt; 0.5$ with sufficient precision tomeasure $\omega_m$ with an uncertainty of $\pm 0.2$.
