0902.2959	first agile catalog of high confidence gamma-ray sources	we present the first catalog of high-confidence gamma-ray sources detected bythe agile satellite during observations performed from july 9, 2007 to june 30,2008. catalogued sources are detected by merging all the available data overthe entire time period. agile, launched in april 2007, is an asi missiondevoted to gamma-ray observations in the 30 mev - 50 gev energy range, withsimultaneous x-ray imaging capability in the 18-60 kev band. this catalog isbased on gamma-ray imaging detector (grid) data for energies greater than 100mev. for the first agile catalog we adopted a conservative analysis, with ahigh-quality event filter optimized to select gamma-ray events within thecentral zone of the instrument field of view (radius of 40 degrees). this is asignificance-limited (4 sigma) catalog, and it is not a complete flux-limitedsample due to the non-uniform first year agile sky coverage. the catalogincludes 47 sources, 21 of which are associated with confirmed or candidatepulsars, 13 with blazars (7 fsrq, 4 bl lacs, 2 unknown type), 2 with hmxrbs, 2with snrs, 1 with a colliding-wind binary system, 8 with unidentified sources.

0908.1908	agile detection of delayed gamma-ray emission from the short gamma-ray  burst grb 090510	short gamma-ray bursts (grbs), typically lasting less than 2 s, are a specialclass of grbs of great interest. we report the detection by the agile satelliteof the short grb 090510 which shows two clearly distinct emission phases: aprompt phase lasting ~ 200 msec and a second phase lasting tens of seconds. theprompt phase is relatively intense in the 0.3-10 mev range with a spectrumcharacterized by a large peak/cutoff energy near 3 mev, in this phase, nosignificant high-energy gamma-ray emission is detected. at the end of theprompt phase, intense gamma-ray emission above 30 mev is detected showing apower-law time decay of the flux of the type t^-1.3 and a broad-band spectrumremarkably different from that of the prompt phase. it extends from sub-mev tohundreds of mev energies with a photon index alpha ~ 1.5. grb 090510 providesthe first case of a short grb with delayed gamma-ray emission. we present thetiming and spectral data of grb 090510 and briefly discuss its remarkableproperties within the current models of gamma-ray emission of short grbs.

0909.3484	agile detection of a rapid gamma-ray flare from the blazar pks 1510-089  during the gasp-webt monitoring	we report the detection by the agile satellite of a rapid gamma-ray flarefrom the powerful gamma-ray quasar pks 1510-089, during a pointing centered onthe galactic center region from 1 march to 30 march 2008. this source has beencontinuosly monitored in the radio-to-optical bands by the glast-agile supportprogram (gasp) of the whole earth blazar telescope (webt). moreover, thegamma-ray flaring episode triggered three too observations by the swiftsatellite in three consecutive days, starting from 20 march 2008. in the period1-16 march 2008, agile detected gamma-ray emission from pks 1510-089 at asignificance level of 6.2-sigma with an average flux over the entire period of(84 +/- 17) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} for photon energies above 100 mev.after a predefined satellite re-pointing, between 17 and 21 march 2008, agiledetected the source at a significance level of 7.3-sigma, with an average flux(e &gt; 100 mev) of (134 +/- 29) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} and a peak levelof (281 +/- 68) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} with daily integration. duringthe observing period january-april 2008, the source also showed an intense andvariable optical activity, with several flaring episodes and a significantincrease of the flux was observed at millimetric frequencies. moreover, in thex-ray band the swift/xrt observations seem to show an harder-when-brighterbehaviour of the source spectrum. the spectral energy distribution of mid-march2008 is modelled with a homogeneous one-zone synchrotron self compton emissionplus contributions from inverse compton scattering of external photons fromboth the accretion disc and the broad line region. indeed, some features in theoptical-uv spectrum seem to indicate the presence of seyfert-like components,such as the little blue bump and the big blue bump.

0910.4883	multiwavelength observations of 3c 454.3 ii. the agile 2007 december  campaign	we report on the second agile multiwavelength campaign of the blazar 3c 454.3during the first half of december 2007. this campaign involved agile, spitzer,swift,suzaku,the webt consortium,the rem and mitsume telescopes,offering abroad band coverage that allowed for a simultaneous sampling of the synchrotronand inverse compton (ic) emissions.the 2-week agile monitoring was accompaniedby radio to optical monitoring by webt and rem and by sparse observations inmid-infrared and soft/hard x-ray energy bands performed by means of target ofopportunity observations by spitzer, swift and suzaku, respectively.the sourcewas detected with an average flux of~250x10^{-8}ph cm^-2s^-1 above 100mev,typical of its flaring states.the simultaneous optical and gamma-raymonitoring allowed us to study the time-lag associated with the variability inthe two energy bands, resulting in a possible ~1-day delay of the gamma-rayemission with respect to the optical one. from the simultaneous optical andgamma-ray fast flare detected on december 12, we can constrain the delaybetween the gamma-ray and optical emissions within 12 hours. moreover, weobtain three spectral energy distributions (seds) with simultaneous data for2007 december 5, 13, 15, characterized by the widest multifrequency coverage.we found that a model with an external compton on seed photons by a standarddisk and reprocessed by the broad line regions does not describe in asatisfactory way the seds of 2007 december 5, 13 and 15. an additionalcontribution, possibly from the hot corona with t=10^6 k surrounding the jet,is required to account simultaneously for the softness of the synchrotron andthe hardness of the inverse compton emissions during those epochs.

0910.5344	discovery of extreme particle acceleration in the microquasar cygnus x-3	the study of relativistic particle acceleration is a major topic ofhigh-energy astrophysics. it is well known that massive black holes in activegalaxies can release a substantial fraction of their accretion power intoenergetic particles, producing gamma-rays and relativistic jets. galacticmicroquasars (hosting a compact star of 1-10 solar masses which accretes matterfrom a binary companion) also produce relativistic jets. however, no directevidence of particle acceleration above gev energies has ever been obtained inmicroquasar ejections, leaving open the issue of the occurrence and timing ofextreme matter energization during jet formation. here we report the detectionof transient gamma-ray emission above 100 mev from the microquasar cygnus x-3,an exceptional x-ray binary which sporadically produces powerful radio jets.four gamma-ray flares (each lasting 1-2 days) were detected by the agilesatellite simultaneously with special spectral states of cygnus x-3 during theperiod mid-2007/mid-2009. our observations show that very efficient particleacceleration and gamma-ray propagation out of the inner disk of a microquasarusually occur a few days before major relativistic jet ejections. flaringparticle energies can be thousands of times larger than previously detectedmaximum values (with lorentz factors of 105 and 102 for electrons and protons,respectively). we show that the transitional nature of gamma-ray flares andparticle acceleration above gev energies in cygnus x-3 is clearly linked tospecial radio/x-ray states preceding strong radio flares. thus gamma-raysprovide unique insight into the nature of physical processes in microquasars.

1001.5150	direct evidence for hadronic cosmic-ray acceleration in the supernova  renmant ic 443	the supernova remnant (snr) ic 443 is an intermediate-age remnant well knownfor its radio, optical, x-ray and gamma-ray energy emissions. in this letter westudy the gamma-ray emission above 100 mev from ic 443 as obtained by the agilesatellite. a distinct pattern of diffuse emission in the energy range 100 mev-3gev is detected across the snr with its prominent maximum (source "a")localized in the northeastern shell with a flux f = (47 \pm 10) 10^{-8} photonscm^{-2} s^{-1} above 100 mev. this location is the site of the strongest shockinteraction between the snr blast wave and the dense circumstellar medium.source "a" is not coincident with the tev source located 0.4 degree away andassociated with a dense molecular cloud complex in the snr central region. fromour observations, and from the lack of detectable diffuse tev emission from itsnortheastern rim, we demonstrate that electrons cannot be the main emitters ofgamma-rays in the range 0.1-10 gev at the site of the strongest snr shock. theintensity, spectral characteristics, and location of the most prominentgamma-ray emission together with the absence of co-spatial detectable tevemission are consistent only with a hadronic model of cosmic-ray accelerationin the snr. a high-density molecular cloud (cloud "e") provides a remarkable"target" for nucleonic interactions of accelerated hadrons: our results showenhanced gamma-ray production near the molecular cloud/shocked shellinteraction site. ic 443 provides the first unambiguous evidence of cosmic-rayacceleration by snrs.

1005.0784	agile detection of gev gamma-ray emission from the snr w28	supernova remnants (snrs) are believed to be the main sources of galacticcosmic rays. molecular clouds associated with snrs can produce gamma-rayemission through the interaction of accelerated particles with the concentratedgas. the middle aged snr w28, for its associated system of dense molecularclouds, provides an excellent opportunity to test this hypothesis. we presentthe agile/grid observations of snr w28, and compare them with observations atother wavelengths (tev and 12co j=1--&gt;0 molecular line emission). the gamma-rayflux detected by agile from the dominant source associated with w28 is (14 +-5) 10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 for e &gt; 400 mev. this source is positionally wellcorrelated with the tev emission observed by the hess telescope. the localvariations of the gev to tev flux ratio suggest a difference between the crspectra of the north-west and south molecular cloud complexes. a model based ona hadronic-induced interaction and diffusion with two molecular clouds atdifferent distances from the w28 shell can explain both the morphological andspectral features observed by agile in the mev-gev energy range and by the hesstelescope in the tev energy range. the combined set of agile and h.e.s.s. datastrongly support a hadronic model for the gamma-ray production in w28.

1103.3647	agile detection of extreme gamma-ray activity from the blazar pks  1510-089 during march 2009. multifrequency analysis	we report on the extreme gamma-ray activity from the fsrq pks 1510-089observed by agile in march 2009. in the same period a radio-to-opticalmonitoring of the source was provided by the gasp-webt and rem. moreover,several swift too observations were triggered, adding important information onthe source behaviour from optical/uv to hard x-rays. we paid particularattention to the calibration of the swift/uvot data to make it suitable to theblazars spectra. simultaneous observations from radio to gamma rays allowed usto study in detail the correlation among the emission variability at differentfrequencies and to investigate the mechanisms at work. in the period 9-30 march2009, agile detected an average gamma-ray flux of (311+/-21)x10^-8 ph cm^-2s^-1 for e&gt;100 mev, and a peak level of (702+/-131)x10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 ondaily integration. the gamma-ray activity occurred during a period ofincreasing activity from near-ir to uv, with a flaring episode detected on26-27 march 2009, suggesting that a single mechanism is responsible for theflux enhancement observed from near-ir to uv. by contrast, swift/xrtobservations seem to show no clear correlation of the x-ray fluxes with theoptical and gamma-ray ones. however, the x-ray observations show a harderphoton index (1.3-1.6) with respect to most fsrqs and a hint ofharder-when-brighter behaviour, indicating the possible presence of a secondemission component at soft x-ray energies. moreover, the broad band spectrumfrom radio-to-uv confirmed the evidence of thermal features in the optical/uvspectrum of pks 1510-089 also during high gamma-ray state. on the other hand,during 25-26 march 2009 a flat spectrum in the optical/uv energy band wasobserved, suggesting an important contribution of the synchrotron emission inthis part of the spectrum during the brightest gamma-ray flare, therefore asignificant shift of the synchrotron peak.

1103.5677	a search for very high energy gamma-ray emission from scorpius x-1 with  the magic telescopes	the acceleration of particles up to gev or higher energies in microquasarshas been the subject of considerable theoretical and observational efforts inthe past few years. sco x-1 is a microquasar from which evidence of highlyenergetic particles in the jet has been found when it is in the so-calledhorizontal branch (hb), a state when the radio and hard x-ray fluxes are higherand a powerful relativistic jet is present. here we present the first very highenergy gamma-ray observations of sco x-1 obtained with the magic telescopes. ananalysis of the whole dataset does not yield a significant signal, with 95% clflux upper limits above 300 gev at the level of 2.4x10^{-12} ph/cm^2/s.simultaneous rxte observations were conducted to search for tev emission duringparticular x-ray states of the source. a selection of the gamma-ray dataobtained during the hb based on the x-ray colors did not yield a signal either,with an upper limit of 3.4x10^{-12} ph/cm^2/s. these upper limits place aconstraint on the maximum tev luminosity to non-thermal x-ray luminosity ofl_{vhe}/l_{ntx}&lt;0.02, that can be related to a maximum tev luminosity to jetpower ratio of l_{vhe}/l_{j}&lt;10^{-3}. our upper limits indicate that theunderlying high-energy emission physics in sco x-1 must be inherently differentfrom that of the hitherto detected gamma-ray binaries.

1106.1589	mrk 421 active state in 2008: the magic view, simultaneous  multi-wavelength observations and ssc model constrained	context: the blazar markarian 421 is one of the brightest tev gamma-raysources of the northern sky. from december 2007 until june 2008 it wasintensively observed in the very high energy (vhe, e &gt; 100 gev) band by thesingle-dish major atmospheric gamma-ray imaging cherenkov telescope (magic-i).aims: we aimed to measure the physical parameters of the emitting region of theblazar jet during active states. methods: we performed a dense monitoring ofthe source in vhe with magic-i, and also collected complementary data in softx-rays and optical-uv bands; then, we modeled the spectral energy distributions(sed) derived from simultaneous multi-wavelength data within the synchrotronself--compton (ssc) framework. results: the source showed intense and prolongedgamma-ray activity during the whole period, with integral fluxes (e &gt; 200 gev)seldom below the level of the crab nebula, and up to 3.6 times this value.eight datasets of simultaneous optical-uv (kva, swift/uvot), soft x-ray(swift/xrt) and magic-i vhe data were obtained during different outburstphases. the data constrain the physical parameters of the jet, once thespectral energy distributions obtained are interpreted within the framework ofa single-zone ssc leptonic model. conclusions: the main outcome of the study isthat within the homogeneous model high doppler factors (40 &lt;= delta &lt;= 80) areneeded to reproduce the observed sed; but this model cannot explain theobserved short time-scale variability, while it can be argued thatinhomogeneous models could allow for less extreme doppler factors, more intensemagnetic fields and shorter electron cooling times compatible with hour orsub-hour scale variability.

1106.5162	the brightest gamma-ray flaring blazar in the sky: agile and  multi-wavelength observations of 3c 454.3 during november 2010	since 2005, the blazar 3c 454.3 has shown remarkable flaring activity at allfrequencies, and during the last four years it has exhibited more than onegamma-ray flare per year, becoming the most active gamma-ray blazar in the sky.we present for the first time the multi-wavelength agile, swift, integral, andgasp-webt data collected in order to explain the extraordinary gamma-ray flareof 3c 454.3 which occurred in november 2010. on 2010 november 20 (mjd 55520),3c 454.3 reached a peak flux (e&gt;100 mev) of f_gamma(p) = (6.8+-1.0)e-5 ph/cm2/son a time scale of about 12 hours, more than a factor of 6 higher than the fluxof the brightest steady gamma-ray source, the vela pulsar, and more than afactor of 3 brighter than its previous super-flare on 2009 december 2-3. themulti-wavelength data make a thorough study of the present event possible: thecomparison with the previous outbursts indicates a close similarity to the onethat occurred in 2009. by comparing the broadband emission before, during, andafter the gamma-ray flare, we find that the radio, optical and x-ray emissionvaries within a factor 2-3, whereas the gamma-ray flux by a factor of 10. thisremarkable behavior is modeled by an external compton component driven by asubstantial local enhancement of soft seed photons.

1108.5391	observations of the crab pulsar between 25 gev and 100 gev with the  magic i telescope	we report on the observation of $\gamma$-rays above 25\,gev from the crabpulsar (psr b0532+21) using the magic i telescope. two data sets fromobservations during the winter period 2007/2008 and 2008/2009 are used. inorder to discuss the spectral shape from 100\,mev to 100\,gev, one year ofpublic {\it fermi} large area telescope ({\it fermi}-lat) data are alsoanalyzed to complement the magic data. the extrapolation of the exponentialcutoff spectrum determined with the fermi-lat data is inconsistent with magicmeasurements, which requires a modification of the standard pulsar emissionmodels. in the energy region between 25 and 100\,gev, the emission in the p1phase (from -0.06 to 0.04, location of the main pulse) and the p2 phase (from0.32 to 0.43, location of the interpulse) can be described by power laws withspectral indices of $-3.1 \pm 1.0_{stat} \pm 0.3_{syst}$ and $-3.5 \pm0.5_{stat} \pm 0.3_{syst}$, respectively. assuming an asymmetric lorentzian forthe pulse shape, the peak positions of the main pulse and the interpulse areestimated to be at phases $-0.009 \pm 0.007$ and $0.393 \pm 0.009$, while thefull widths at half maximum are $0.025 \pm 0.008$ and $0.053 \pm 0.015$,respectively.

1109.6124	phase-resolved energy spectra of the crab pulsar in the range of 50-400  gev measured with the magic telescopes	we use 73 h of stereoscopic data taken with the magic telescopes toinvestigate the very high-energy (vhe) gamma-ray emission of the crab pulsar.our data show a highly significant pulsed signal in the energy range from 50 to400 gev in both the main pulse (p1) and the interpulse (p2) phase regions. weprovide the widest spectra to date of the vhe components of both peaks, andthese spectra extend to the energy range of satellite-borne observatories. thegood resolution and background rejection of the stereoscopic magic systemallows us to cross-check the correctness of each spectral point of the pulsarby comparison with the corresponding (strong and well-known) crab nebula flux.the spectra of both p1 and p2 are compatible with power laws with photonindices of 4.0 \pm 0.8 (p1) and 3.42 \pm 0.26 (p2), respectively, and the ratiop1/p2 between the photon counts of the two pulses is 0.54 \pm 0.12. the vheemission can be understood as an additional component produced by the inversecompton scattering of secondary and tertiary e\pm pairs on ir-uv photons.

1111.4960	agile detection of cygnus x-3 {\gamma}-ray active states during the  period mid-2009/mid-2010	cygnus x-3 (cyg x-3) is a well-known microquasar producing variable emissionat all wavelengths. cyg x-3 is a prominent x-ray binary producing relativisticjets, and studying its high energy emission is crucial for the understanding ofthe fundamental acceleration processes in accreting compact objects. aims. ourgoal is to study extreme particle acceleration and {\gamma}-ray productionabove 100 mev during special spectral states of cyg x- 3 usually characterizedby a low hard x-ray flux and enhanced soft x-ray states. we observed cyg x-3with the agile satellite in extended time intervals from 2009 jun.-jul., and2009 nov.-2010 jul. we report here the results of the agile {\gamma}-raymonitoring of cyg x-3 as well as the results from extensive multiwavelengthcampaigns involving radio (ratan-600, ami-la and mets\"{a}hovi radioobservatories) and x-ray monitoring data (xte and swift). we detect a series ofrepeated {\gamma}-ray flaring activity from cyg x-3 that correlate with thesoft x-ray states and episodes of decreasing or non-detectable hard x-rayemission. furthermore, we detect {\gamma}-ray enhanced emission that tends tobe associated with radio flares greater than 1 jy at 15 ghz, confirming a trendalready detected in previous observations. the source remained active above 100mev for an extended period of time (almost 1.5 months in 2009 jun.-jul. and 1month in 2010 may). we study in detail the short timescale {\gamma}-ray flaresthat occurred before or near the radio peaks. our results confirm the transientnature of the extreme particle acceleration from the microquasar cyg x-3. aseries of repeated {\gamma}-ray flares shows correlations with radio and x-rayemission confirming a well established trend of emission. we compare ourresults with fermi-lat and magic tev observations of cyg x-3.

1111.5544	constraining cosmic rays and magnetic fields in the perseus galaxy  cluster with tev observations by the magic telescopes	galaxy clusters are being assembled today in the most energetic phase ofhierarchical structure formation which manifests itself in powerful shocks thatcontribute to a substantial energy density of cosmic rays (crs). hence,clusters are expected to be luminous gamma-ray emitters since they also act asenergy reservoirs for additional cr sources, such as active galactic nuclei andsupernova-driven galactic winds. to detect the gamma-ray emission from crinteractions with the ambient cluster gas, we conducted the deepest to dateobservational campaign targeting a galaxy cluster at very high-energygamma-rays and observed the perseus cluster with the magic cherenkov telescopesfor a total of ~85 hr of effective observing time. this campaign resulted inthe detection of the central radio galaxy ngc 1275 at energies e &gt; 100 gev witha very steep energy spectrum. here, we restrict our analysis to energies e &gt;630 gev and detect no significant gamma-ray excess. this constrains the averagecr-to-thermal pressure ratio to be &lt;= 1-2%, depending on assumptions and themodel for cr emission. comparing these gamma-ray upper limits to predictionsfrom cosmological cluster simulations that include crs constrains the maximumcr acceleration efficiency at structure formation shocks to be &lt; 50%.alternatively, this may argue for non-negligible cr transport processes such ascr streaming and diffusion into the outer cluster regions. finally, we derivelower limits on the magnetic field distribution assuming that the perseus radiomini-halo is generated by secondary electrons/positrons that are created inhadronic cr interactions: assuming a spectrum of e^-2.2 around tev energies asimplied by cluster simulations, we limit the central magnetic field to be &gt; 4-9microg, depending on the rate of decline of the magnetic field strength towardlarger radii.

1207.1634	high zenith angle observations of pks 2155-304 with the magic-i  telescope	the high frequency peaked bl lac pks 2155-304 with a redshift of z=0.116 wasdiscovered in 1997 in the very high energy (vhe, e &gt;100gev) gamma-ray range bythe university of durham mark vi gamma-ray cherenkov telescope in australiawith a flux corresponding to 20% of the crab nebula flux. it was later observedand detected with high significance by the southern cherenkov observatoryh.e.s.s. detection from the northern hemisphere is difficult due to challengingobservation conditions under large zenith angles. in july 2006, the h.e.s.s.collaboration reported an extraordinary outburst of vhe gamma-emission. duringthe outburst, the vhe gamma-ray emission was found to be variable on the timescales of minutes and with a mean flux of ~7 times the flux observed from thecrab nebula. follow-up observations with the magic-i standalone cherenkovtelescope were triggered by this extraordinary outburst and pks 2155-304 wasobserved between 28 july to 2 august 2006 for 15 hours at large zenith angles.here we present our studies on the behavior of the source after itsextraordinary flare and an enhanced analysis method for data taken at highzenith angles. we developed improved methods for event selection that led to abetter background suppression. the averaged energy spectrum we derived has aspectral index of -3.5 +/- 0.2 above 400gev, which is in good agreement withthe spectral shape measured by h.e.s.s. during the major flare on mjd 53944.furthermore, we present the spectral energy distribution modeling of pks2155-304. with our observations we increased the duty cycle of the sourceextending the light curve derived by h.e.s.s. after the outburst. finally, wefind night-by-night variability with a maximal amplitude of a factor three tofour and an intranight variability in one of the nights (mjd 53945) with asimilar amplitude.

1302.2321	differential frequency-dependent delay from the pulsar magnetosphere	some radio pulsars show clear drifting subpulses, in which subpulses are seento drift in pulse longitude in a systematic pattern. here we examine how thedrifting subpulses of psr b0809+74 evolve with time and observing frequency. weshow that the subpulse period (p3) is constant on timescales of days, monthsand years, and between 14-5100 mhz. despite this, the shapes of the driftbandschange radically with frequency. previous studies have concluded that, whilethe subpulses appear to move through the pulse window approximately linearly atlow frequencies (&lt; 500 mhz), a discrete step of 180 degrees in subpulse phaseis observed at higher frequencies (&gt; 820 mhz) near to the peak of the averagepulse profile. we use lofar, gmrt, gbt, wsrt and effelsberg 100-m data toexplore the frequency-dependence of this phase step. we show that the size ofthe subpulse phase step increases gradually, and is observable even at lowfrequencies. we attribute the subpulse phase step to the presence of twoseparate driftbands, whose relative arrival times vary with frequency - onedriftband arriving 30 pulses earlier at 20 mhz than it does at 1380 mhz, whilstthe other arrives simultaneously at all frequencies. the drifting pattern whichis observed here cannot be explained by either the rotating carousel model orthe surface oscillation model, and could provide new insight into the physicalprocesses happening within the pulsar magnetosphere.

1303.6230	calibrating high-precision faraday rotation measurements for lofar and  the next generation of low-frequency radio telescopes	faraday rotation measurements using the current and next generation oflow-frequency radio telescopes will provide a powerful probe of astronomicalmagnetic fields. however, achieving the full potential of these measurementsrequires accurate removal of the time-variable ionospheric faraday rotationcontribution. we present ionfr, a code that calculates the amount ofionospheric faraday rotation for a specific epoch, geographic location, andline-of-sight. ionfr uses a number of publicly available, gps-derived totalelectron content maps and the most recent release of the internationalgeomagnetic reference field. we describe applications of this code for thecalibration of radio polarimetric observations, and demonstrate the highaccuracy of its modeled ionospheric faraday rotations using lofar pulsarobservations. these show that we can accurately determine some of thehighest-precision pulsar rotation measures ever achieved. precision rotationmeasures can be used to monitor rotation measure variations - either intrinsicor due to the changing line-of-sight through the interstellar medium. thiscalibration is particularly important for nearby sources, where the ionospherecan contribute a significant fraction of the observed rotation measure. we alsodiscuss planned improvements to ionfr, as well as the importance of ionosphericfaraday rotation calibration for the emerging generation of low-frequency radiotelescopes, such as the ska and its pathfinders.

1408.5272	lofar observations of psr b0943+10: profile evolution and discovery of a  systematically changing profile delay in bright mode	we present broadband, low-frequency (25-80 mhz and 110-190 mhz) lofarobservations of psr b0943+10, with the goal of better illuminating the natureof its enigmatic mode-switching behaviour. this pulsar shows two relativelystable states: a bright (b) and quiet (q) mode, each with differentcharacteristic brightness, profile morphology, and single-pulse properties. wemodel the average profile evolution both in frequency and time from the onsetof each mode, and highlight the differences between the two modes. in bothmodes, the profile evolution can be well explained by radius-to-frequencymapping at altitudes within a few hundred kilometres of the stellar surface. ifboth b and q-mode emission originate at the same magnetic latitude, then wefind that the change of emission height between the modes is less than 6%. wealso find that, during b-mode, the average profile is gradually shiftingtowards later spin phase and then resets its position at the next q-to-btransition. the observed b-mode profile delay is frequency-independent (atleast from 25-80 mhz) and asymptotically changes towards a stable value ofabout 0.004 in spin phase by the end of mode instance, much too large to be dueto changing spin-down rate. such a delay can be interpreted as a gradualmovement of the emission cone against the pulsar's direction of rotation, withdifferent field lines being illuminated over time. another interestingexplanation is a possible variation of accelerating potential inside the polargap. this explanation connects the observed profile delay to the graduallyevolving subpulse drift rate, which depends on the gradient of the potentialacross the field lines.

1501.03312	pulsar polarisation below 200 mhz: average profiles and propagation  effects	we present the highest-quality polarisation profiles to date of 16non-recycled pulsars and four millisecond pulsars, observed below 200 mhz withthe lofar high-band antennas. based on the observed profiles, we perform aninitial investigation of expected observational effects resulting from thepropagation of polarised emission in the pulsar magnetosphere and theinterstellar medium.  the predictions of magnetospheric birefringence in pulsars have been testedusing spectra of the pulse width and fractional polarisation frommultifrequency data. the derived spectra offer only partial support for theexpected effects of birefringence on the polarisation properties, with onlyabout half of our sample being consistent with the model's predictions. it isnoted that for some pulsars these measurements are contaminated by the effectsof interstellar scattering. for a number of pulsars in our sample, we haveobserved significant variations in the amount of faraday rotation as a functionof pulse phase, which is possibly an artefact of scattering. these variationsare typically two orders of magnitude smaller than that observed at 1400 mhz bynoutsos et al. (2009), for a different sample of southern pulsars. in thispaper we present a possible explanation for the difference in magnitude of thiseffect between the two frequencies, based on scattering. finally, we haveestimated the magnetospheric emission heights of low-frequency radiation fromfour pulsars, based on the phase lags between the flux-density and the paprofiles, and the theoretical framework of blaskiewicz, cordes &amp; wasserman(1991). these estimates yielded heights of a few hundred km; at least for psrb1133+16, this is consistent with emission heights derived based onradius-to-frequency mapping, but is up to a few times larger than the recentupper limit based on pulsar timing.

1505.03064	lofar discovery of a quiet emission mode in psr b0823+26	psr b0823+26, a 0.53-s radio pulsar, displays a host of emission phenomenaover timescales of seconds to (at least) hours, including nulling, subpulsedrifting, and mode-changing. studying pulsars like psr b0823+26 providesfurther insight into the relationship between these various emission phenomenaand what they might teach us about pulsar magnetospheres. here we report on thelofar discovery that psr b0823+26 has a weak and sporadically emitting 'quiet'(q) emission mode that is over 100 times weaker (on average) and has a nullingfraction forty-times greater than that of the more regularly-emitting 'bright'(b) mode. previously, the pulsar has been undetected in the q-mode, and wasassumed to be nulling continuously. psr b0823+26 shows a further decrease inaverage flux just before the transition into the b-mode, and perhaps trulyturns off completely at these times. furthermore, simultaneous observationstaken with the lofar, westerbork, lovell, and effelsberg telescopes between 110mhz and 2.7 ghz demonstrate that the transition between the q-mode and b-modeoccurs within one single rotation of the neutron star, and that it isconcurrent across the range of frequencies observed.
