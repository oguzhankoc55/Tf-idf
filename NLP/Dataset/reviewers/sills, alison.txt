0901.2345	a binary origin for blue stragglers in globular clusters	blue stragglers in globular clusters are abnormally massive stars that shouldhave evolved off the stellar main sequence long ago. there are two knownprocesses that can create these objects: direct stellar collisions and binaryevolution. however, the relative importance of these processes has remainedunclear. in particular, the total number of blue stragglers found in a givencluster does not seem to correlate with the predicted collision rate, providingindirect support for the binary-evolution model. yet the radial distributionsof blue stragglers in many clusters are bimodal, with a dominant central peak:this has been interpreted as an indication that collisions do dominate bluestraggler production, at least in the high-density cluster cores. here wereport that there is a clear, but sublinear, correlation between the number ofblue stragglers found in a cluster core and the total stellar mass containedwithin it. from this we conclude that most blue stragglers, even those found incluster cores, come from binary systems. the parent binaries, however, maythemselves have been affected by dynamical encounters. this may be the key toreconciling all of the seemingly conflicting results found to date.

1004.4166	multiple populations in globular clusters: the possible contributions of  stellar collisions	globular clusters were thought to be simple stellar populations, but recentphotometric and spectroscopic evidence suggests that the clusters' earlyformation history was more complicated. in particular, clusters showstar-to-star abundance variations, and multiple sequences in theircolour-magnitude diagrams. these effects seem to be restricted to globularclusters, and are not found in open clusters or the field. in this paper, wecombine the two competing models for these multiple populations and include aconsideration of the effects of stellar collisions. collisions are one of thefew phenomena which occur solely in dense stellar environments like(proto-)globular clusters. we find that runaway collisions between massivestars can produce material which has abundances comparable to the observedsecond generations, but that very little total mass is produced by thischannel. we then add the contributions of rapidly-rotating massive stars (underthe assumption that massive stars are spun up by collisions and interactions),and the contribution of asymptotic giant branch stars. we find that collisionscan help produce the extreme abundances which are seen in some clusters.however, the total amount of material produced in these generations is stilltoo small (by at least a factor of 10) to match the observations. we concludewith a discussion of the additional effects which probably need to beconsidered to solve this particular problem.

1006.3079	multiple stellar populations and their influence on blue stragglers	it has become clear in recent years that globular clusters are not simplestellar populations, but may host chemically distinct sub-populations,typically with an enhanced helium abundance. these helium-rich populations canmake up a substantial fraction of all cluster stars.  one of the proposed formation channels for blue straggler stars is thephysical collision and merger of two stars. in the context of multiplepopulations, collisions between stars with different helium abundances shouldoccur and contribute to the observed blue straggler population. this willaffect the predicted blue straggler colour and luminosity function.  we quantify this effect by calculating models of mergers resulting fromcollisions between stars with different helium abundances and using thesemodels to model a merger population. we then compare these results to fourobserved clusters, ngc 1851, ngc 2808, ngc 5634 and ngc 6093.  as in previous studies our models deviate from the observations, particularlyin the colour distributions. however, our results are consistent withobservations of multiple populations in these clusters. in ngc 2808, our bestfitting models include normal and helium enhanced populations, in agreementwith helium enhancement inferred in this cluster. the other three clusters showbetter agreement with models that do not include helium enhancement. we discussfuture prospects to improve the modelling of blue straggler populations and therole that the models we present here can play in such a study.

1009.0461	an analytic technique for constraining the dynamical origins of multiple  star systems containing merger products	we present a technique to identify the most probable dynamical formationscenario for an observed binary or triple system containing one or more mergerproducts or, alternatively, to rule out the possibility of a dynamical origin.our method relies on an analytic prescription for energy conservation duringstellar encounters. with this, observations of the multiple star systemcontaining the merger product(s) can be used to work backwards in order toconstrain the initial orbital energies of any single, binary or triple systemsthat went into the encounter. the initial semi-major axes of the orbits providean estimate for the collisional cross section and therefore the time-scale forthe encounter to occur in its host cluster. we have applied our analyticprescription to observed binary and triple systems containing blue stragglers,in particular the triple system s1082 in m67 and the period distribution of theblue straggler binaries in ngc 188. we have shown that both s1082 and most ofthe blue straggler binaries in ngc 188 could have a dynamical origin, and thatencounters involving triples could be a significant contributor to bspopulations in old open clusters. in general, our results suggest thatencounters involving triples could make up a significant fraction of thosedynamical interactions that result in stellar mergers, in particular encountersthat produce multiple star systems containing one or more blue stragglers.

1011.2204	mass transfer in binary stars using sph. ii. eccentric binaries	despite numerous efforts to better understand binary star evolution, someaspects of it remain poorly constrained. in particular, the evolution ofeccentric binaries has remained elusive mainly because the roche lobe formalismderived for circular binaries does not apply. here, we report the results ofour smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of mass transfer in eccentricbinaries using an alternate method in which we model only the outermost layersof the stars with appropriate boundary conditions. using this technique, alongwith properly relaxed model stars, we characterize the mass transfer episodesof binaries with various orbital parameters. in particular, we show that theseepisodes can be described by gaussians with a fwmh of ~0.12 p_orb and that thepeak rates occur after periastron, at an orbital phase of ~0.58, independentlyof the eccentricity and mass of the stars. the accreted material is observed toform a rather sparse envelope around either or both stars. although the fate ofthis envelope is not modeled in our simulations, we show that a constantfraction (~5%) of the material transferred is ejected from the systems. wediscuss this result in terms of the non-conservative mass transfer scenario. wesuggest our results could be incorporated in analytical and binary populationsynthesis studies to help better understand the evolution of eccentric binariesand the formation of exotic stellar populations.

1011.2211	mass transfer in binary stars using sph. i. numerical method	close interactions and mass transfer in binary stars can lead to theformation of many different exotic stellar populations, but detailed modelingof mass transfer is a computationally challenging problem. here, we present analternate smoothed particle hydrodynamics approach to the modeling of masstransfer in binary systems that allows a better resolution of the flow ofmatter between main-sequence stars. our approach consists of modeling only theoutermost layers of the stars using appropriate boundary conditions and ghostparticles. we arbitrarily set the radius of the boundary and find that ourboundary treatment behaves physically and conserves energy well. in particular,when used with our binary relaxation procedure, our treatment of boundaryconditions is also shown to evolve circular binaries properly for many orbits.the results of our first simulation of mass transfer are also discussed andused to assess the strengths and limitations of our method. we conclude that itis well suited for the modeling of interacting binary stars. the methodpresented here represents a convenient alternative to previous hydrodynamicaltechniques aimed at modeling mass transfer in binary systems since it can beused to model both the donor and the accretor while maintaining the densityprofiles taken from realistic stellar models.

1105.3192	dissecting the colour-magnitude diagram: a homogeneous catalogue of  stellar populations in globular clusters	we present a homogeneous catalogue for blue straggler, red giant branch,horizontal branch and main-sequence turn-off stars in a sample of 35 clusterstaken from the acs survey for globular clusters. as a result of the superiorphotometry and relatively large field of view offered by the acs data, this newcatalogue is a significant improvement upon the one presented in leigh, sills &amp;knigge (2007). using our catalogue, we study and compare the radialdistributions of the different stellar populations.  we have confirmed our previous result (knigge, leigh &amp; sills 2009) that thereis a clear, but sub-linear, correlation between the number of blue stragglersfound in the cluster core and the total stellar mass contained within it. byconsidering a larger spatial extent than just the core, our results suggestthat mass segregation is not the dominant effect contributing to the observedsub-linearity. we also investigate the radial distributions of the differentstellar populations in our sample of clusters. our results are consistent witha linear relationship between the number of stars in these populations and thetotal mass enclosed within the same radius. therefore, we conclude that thecluster dynamics does not significantly affect the relative distributions ofthese populations in our sample.

1105.5388	an analytic model for blue straggler formation in globular clusters	we present an analytic model for blue straggler formation in globularclusters. we assume that blue stragglers are formed only through stellarcollisions and binary star evolution, and compare our predictions to observedblue straggler numbers taken from the catalogue of leigh, sills &amp; knigge(2011). we can summarize our key results as follows: (1) binary star evolutionconsistently dominates blue straggler production in all our best-fittingmodels. (2) in order to account for the observed sub-linear dependence of bluestraggler numbers on the core masses (knigge, leigh &amp; sills 2009), the corebinary fraction must be inversely proportional to the total cluster luminosityand should always exceed at least a few percent. (3) in at least some clusters,blue straggler formation must be enhanced by dynamical encounters (either viadirect collisions or by stimulating mass-transfer to occur by altering thedistribution of binary orbital parameters) relative to what is expected byassuming a simple population of binaries evolving in isolation. (4) theagreement between the predictions of our model and the observations can beimproved by including blue stragglers that form outside the core but latermigrate in due to dynamical friction. (5) longer blue straggler lifetimes arepreferred in models that include blue stragglers formed outside the core sincethis increases the fraction that will have sufficient time to migrate in viadynamical friction.

1201.1058	the observational and theoretical tidal radii of globular clusters in  m87	globular clusters have linear sizes (tidal radii) which theory tells us aredetermined by their masses and by the gravitational potential of their hostgalaxy. to explore the relationship between observed and expected radii, weutilize the globular cluster population of the virgo giant m87. unusually deep,high signal-to-noise images of m87 are used to measure the effective andlimiting radii of approximately 2000 globular clusters. to compare with theseobservations, we simulate a globular cluster population that has the samecharacteristics as the observed m87 cluster population. placing these simulatedclusters in the well-studied tidal field of m87, the orbit of each cluster issolved and the theoretical tidal radius of each cluster is determined. wecompare the predicted relationship between cluster size and projectedgalactocentric distance to observations. we find that for an isotropicdistribution of cluster velocities, theoretical tidal radii are approximatelyequal to observed limiting radii for rgc &lt; 10 kpc. however, the isotropicsimulation predicts a steep increase in cluster size at larger radii, which isnot observed in large galaxies beyond the milky way. to minimize thediscrepancy between theory and observations, we explore the effects of orbitalanisotropy on cluster sizes, and suggest a possible orbital anisotropy profilefor m87 which yields a better match between theory and observations. finally,we suggest future studies which will establish a stronger link betweentheoretical tidal radii and observed radii.

1202.2851	quantifying the universality of the stellar initial mass function in old  star clusters	we present a new technique to quantify cluster-to-cluster variations in theobserved present-day stellar mass functions of a large sample of star clusters.our method quantifies these differences as a function of both the stellar massand the total cluster mass, and offers the advantage that it is insensitive tothe precise functional form of the mass function. we applied our technique todata taken from the acs survey for globular clusters, from which we obtainedcompleteness-corrected stellar mass functions in the mass range 0.25-0.75m$_{\odot}$ for a sample of 27 clusters. the results of our observationalanalysis were then compared to monte carlo simulations for globular clusterevolution spanning a range of initial mass functions, total numbers of stars,concentrations, and virial radii.  we show that the present-day mass functions of the clusters in our sample canbe reproduced by assuming an universal initial mass function for all clusters,and that the cluster-to-cluster differences are consistent with what isexpected from two-body relaxation. a more complete exploration of the initialcluster conditions will be needed in future studies to better constrain theprecise functional form of the initial mass function. this study is a firststep toward using our technique to constrain the dynamical histories of a largesample of old galactic star clusters and, by extension, star formation in theearly universe.

1207.5535	connecting the dots: analyzing synthetic observations of star-forming  clumps in molecular clouds	in this paper, we investigate the extent to which observations of molecularclouds can correctly identify and measure star-forming clumps. we produced asynthetic column density map and a synthetic spectral-line data cube from thesimulated collapse of a 5000 m$_{\odot}$ molecular cloud. by correlating theclumps found in the simulation to those found in the synthetic observations,clump masses derived from spectral-line data cubes were found to be quite closeto the true physical properties of the clumps. we also find that the `observed'clump mass function derived from the column density map is shifted by a factorof ~ 3 higher than the true clump mass function, due to projection oflow-density material along the line of sight. alves et al. (2007) firstproposed that a shift of a clump mass function to higher masses by a factor of3 can be attributed to a star formation efficiency of 30 %. our resultsindicate that this finding may instead be due to an overestimate of clumpmasses determined from column density observations.

1210.0542	the origins of blue stragglers and binarity in globular clusters	(abridged) we use newly available empirical binary fractions for globularclusters to carry out a direct test of the binary evolution hypothesis, and ofcollisional channels that involve binary stars. more specifically, using thepreviously reported correlation between blue straggler numbers and core mass asa benchmark, we test for correlations with the number of binary stars, as wellas with the rates of single-single, single-binary, and binary-binaryencounters. surprisingly, we find that the simple correlation with core massremains by far the strongest predictor of blue straggler population size, evenin our joint models. this is despite the fact that the binary fractionsthemselves strongly anti-correlate with core mass, just as expected in thebinary evolution model. at first sight, these results do not fit neatly witheither binary evolution or collisional models in their simplest forms. arguablythe simplest and most intriguing possibility to explain this unexpected resultis that observational errors on the core binary fractions are larger than thetrue intrinsic dispersion associated with their dependence on core mass. in thecontext of the binary evolution model, this would explain why the combinationof binary fraction and core mass is a poorer predictor of blue stragglernumbers than core mass alone. it would also imply that core mass is aremarkably clean predictor of core binary fractions. this would be ofconsiderable importance for the dynamical evolution of globular clusters, andprovides an important benchmark for models attempting to understand theirpresent-day properties.

1301.0626	the influence of orbital eccentricity on tidal radii of star clusters	we have performed n-body simulations of star clusters orbiting in aspherically symmetric smooth galactic potential. the model clusters cover arange of initial half-mass radii and orbital eccentricities in order to testthe historical assumption that the tidal radius of a cluster is imposed atperigalacticon. the traditional assumption for globular clusters is that sincethe internal relaxation time is larger than its orbital period, the cluster istidally stripped at perigalacticon. instead, our simulations show that acluster with an eccentric orbit does not need to fully relax in order toexpand. after a perigalactic pass, a cluster re-captures previously unboundstars, and the tidal shock at perigalacticon has the effect of energizing innerregion stars to larger orbits. therefore, instead of the limiting radius beingimposed at perigalacticon, it more nearly traces the instantaneous tidal radiusof the cluster at any point in the orbit. we present a numerical correctionfactor to theoretical tidal radii calculated at perigalacticon which takes intoconsideration both the orbital eccentricity and current orbital phase of thecluster.

1302.7284	stellar collisions and blue straggler stars in dense globular clusters	blue straggler stars (bss) are abundantly observed in all galactic globularclusters (ggc) where data exist. however, observations alone cannot reveal therelative importance of various formation channels or the typical formationtimes for this well studied population of anomalous stars. using astate-of-the-art h\'enon-type monte carlo code that includes all relevantphysical processes, we create 128 models with properties typical of theobserved ggcs. these models include realistic numbers of single and binarystars, use observationally motivated initial conditions, and span large rangesin central density, concentration, binary fraction, and mass. their propertiescan be directly compared with those of observed ggcs. we can easily identifythe bsss in our models and determine their formation channels and birth times.we find that for central densities above ~10^3 msun/pc^3 the dominant formationchannel is stellar collisions while for lower density clusters, mass transferin binaries provides a significant contribution (up to ~ 60% in our models).the majority of these collisions are binary-mediated, occurring during 3-bodyand 4-body interactions. as a result a strong correlation between the specificfrequency of bsss and the binary fraction in a cluster can be seen in ourmodels. we find that the number of bsss in the core shows only a weakcorrelation with the collision rate estimator \gamma traditionally used byobservers, in agreement with the latest hubble space telescope (acs) data.using an idealized "full mixing" prescription for collision products, ourmodels indicate that the bsss observed today may have formed several gyrs ago.however, denser clusters tend to have younger (~1 gyr) bsss.

1303.2667	mock observations of blue stragglers in globular cluster models	we created artificial color-magnitude diagrams of monte carlo dynamicalmodels of globular clusters, and then used observational methods to determinethe number of blue stragglers in those clusters. we compared these bluestragglers to various cluster properties, mimicking work that has been done forblue stragglers in milky way globular clusters to determine the dominantformation mechanism(s) of this unusual stellar population. we find that amass-based prescription for selecting blue stragglers will choose approximatelytwice as many blue stragglers than a selection criterion that was developed forobservations of real clusters. however, the two numbers of blue stragglers arewell-correlated, so either selection criterion can be used to characterize theblue straggler population of a cluster. we confirm previous results that thesimplified prescription for the evolution of a collision or merger product inthe bse code overestimates their lifetimes. we show that our model bluestragglers follow similar trends with cluster properties (core mass, binaryfraction, total mass, collision rate) as the true milky way blue stragglers, aslong as we restrict ourselves to model clusters with an initial binary fractionhigher than 5%. we also show that, in contrast to earlier work, the number ofblue stragglers in the cluster core does have a weak dependence on thecollisional parameter gamma in both our models and in milky way globularclusters.

1305.3275	modifying two-body relaxation in n-body systems by gas accretion	we consider the effects that accretion from the interstellar medium onto theparticles of an n-body system has on the rate of two-body relaxation. to thisend, we derive an accretion-modified relaxation time by adapting spitzer'stwo-component model to include the damping effects of accretion. we considerseveral different mass-dependencies and efficiency factors for the accretionrate, as well as different mass ratios for the two components of the model.  the net effect of accretion is to accelerate mass segregation by increasingthe average mass $\bar{m}$, since the relaxation time is inversely proportionalto $\bar{m}$. under the assumption that the accretion rate increases with theaccretor mass, there are two additional effects that accelerate masssegregation. first, accretion acts to increase the range of any initial massspectrum, quickly driving the heaviest members to even higher masses. second,accretion acts to reduce the velocities of the accretors due to conservation ofmomentum, and it is the heaviest members that are affected the most. using ourtwo-component model, we quantify these effects as a function of the accretionrate, the total cluster mass, and the component masses. we conclude bydiscussing the implications of our results for the dynamical evolution ofprimordial globular clusters, primarily in the context of black holes formedfrom the most massive stellar progenitors.

1309.7054	the state of globular clusters at birth: emergence from the gas-embedded  phase	in this paper, we discuss the origin of the observed correlation betweencluster concentration c and present-day mass function (pdmf) slope {\alpha}reported by de marchi, paresce &amp; pulone. this relation can either be reproducedfrom universal initial conditions combined with some dynamical mechanism(s)that alter(s) the cluster structure and mass function over time, or it mustarise early on in the cluster lifetime, such as during the gas-embedded phaseof cluster formation. using a combination of monte carlo and n-body models forglobular cluster evolution performed with the mocca and nbody6 codes,respectively, we explore a number of dynamical mechanisms that could affect theobserved relation.  for the range of initial conditions considered here, our results areconsistent with an universal initial binary fraction \approx 10% (which doesnot, however, preclude 100%) and an universal initial stellar mass functionresembling the standard kroupa distribution. most of the dispersion observed inthe c-{\alpha} relation can be attributed to two-body relaxation and galactictides. however, dynamical processes alone could not have reproduced thedispersion in concentration, and we require at least some correlation betweenthe initial concentration and the total cluster mass. we argue that the originof this trend could be connected to the gas-embedded phase of clusterevolution.

1310.4834	globular cluster scale sizes in giant galaxies: the case of m87 and the  role of orbital anisotropy and tidal filling	we present new hubble space telescope imaging of the outer regions of m87 inorder to study its globular cluster (gc) population out to large galactocentricdistances. we discuss particularly the relationship between gc effective radii$r_h$ and projected galactocentric distance $r_{gc}$. the observations suggesta shallow trend $r_h \propto r_{gc}^{0.14}$ out to $r_{gc} \sim 100$ kpc, inagreement with studies of other giant elliptical galaxies. to theoreticallyreproduce this relationship we simulate gc populations with variousdistributions of orbits. for an isotropic distribution of cluster orbits wefind a steeper trend of $r_h \propto r_{gc}^{0.4}$. instead we suggest that (a)if the cluster system has an orbital anisotropy profile, where orbits becomepreferentially radial with increasing galactocentric distance, and (b) ifclusters become more tidally under-filling with galactocentric distance, theobserved relationship can be recovered. we also apply this approach to the redand blue gc populations separately and predict that red clusters arepreferentially under-filling at large $r_{gc}$ and have a more isotropicdistribution of orbits than blue clusters.

1401.7653	the celestial buffet: multiple populations and globular cluster  formation in dwarf galaxies	we present a framework that explains the commonly observed variation in lightelement abundances in globular clusters. if globular clusters form in thecentres of dwarf galaxies, they will be pumped onto larger orbits as starformation progresses. the potential well will only retain the moderate velocityagb ejecta, the expected source of enrichment, but not supernova ejecta. thereis no need to increase the initial cluster mass, a requirement ofself-enrichment scenarios, as all the stars within the dwarf can contribute. asthe clusters move through the dwarf centre they sweep up a mix of agb ejectaand in-falling pristine gas to form a second generation of stars. the specificmix will vary in time and is thus able to explain the spread in secondgeneration abundances observed in different clusters. the globular clusterswill survive to the present day or be stripped as part of the hierarchicalmerging process of larger galaxies. we illustrate how this process may operateusing a high-resolution simulation of a dwarf galaxy at high redshift.

1405.3285	the effect of orbital eccentricity on the dynamical evolution of star  clusters	we use n-body simulations to explore the influence of orbital eccentricity onthe dynamical evolution of star clusters. specifically we compare the mass lossrate, velocity dispersion, relaxation time, and the mass function of starclusters on circular and eccentric orbits. for a given perigalactic distance,increasing orbital eccentricity slows the dynamical evolution of a cluster dueto a weaker mean tidal field. however, we find that perigalactic passes andtidal heating due to an eccentric orbit can partially compensate for thedecreased mean tidal field by energizing stars to higher velocities andstripping additional stars from the cluster, accelerating the relaxationprocess. we find that the corresponding circular orbit which best describes theevolution of a cluster on an eccentric orbit is much less than its semi-majoraxis or time averaged galactocentric distance. since clusters spend themajority of their lifetimes near apogalacticon, the properties of clusterswhich appear very dynamically evolved for a given galactocentric distance canbe explained by an eccentric orbit. additionally we find that the evolution ofthe slope of the mass function within the core radius is roughlyorbit-independent, so it could place additional constraints on the initial massand initial size of globular clusters with solved orbits. we use our results todemonstrate how the orbit of milky way globular clusters can be constrainedgiven standard observable parameters like galactocentric distance and the slopeof the mass function. we then place constraints on the unsolved orbits of ngc1261,ngc 6352, ngc 6496, and ngc 6304 based on their positions and massfunctions.

1406.3491	models of individual blue stragglers	this chapter describes the current state of models of individual bluestragglers. stellar collisions, binary mergers (or coalescence), and partial orongoing mass transfer have all been studied in some detail. the products ofstellar collisions retain memory of their parent stars and are not fully mixed.very high initial rotation rates must be reduced by an unknown process to allowthe stars to collapse to the main sequence. the more massive collision productshave shorter lifetimes than normal stars of the same mass, while productsbetween low mass stars are long-lived and look very much like normal stars oftheir mass. mass transfer can result in a merger, or can produce another binarysystem with a blue straggler and the remnant of the original primary. theproducts of binary mass transfer cover a larger portion of the colour-magnitudediagram than collision products for two reasons: there are more possibleconfigurations which produce blue stragglers, and there are differingcontributions to the blended light of the system. the effects of rotation maybe substantial in both collision and merger products, and could result insignificant mixing unless angular momentum is lost shortly after the formationevent. surface abundances may provide ways to distinguish between the formationmechanisms, but care must be taking to model the various mixing mechanismsproperly before drawing strong conclusions. avenues for future work areoutlined.

1409.0879	the effects of orbital inclination on the scale size and evolution of  tidally filling star clusters	we have performed n-body simulations of tidally filling star clusters with arange of orbits in a milky way-like potential to study the effects of orbitalinclination and eccentricity on their structure and evolution. at smallgalactocentric distances rgc, a non-zero inclination results in increased massloss rates. tidal heating and disk shocking, the latter sometimes consisting oftwo shocking events as the cluster moves towards and away from the disk, helpremove stars from the cluster. clusters with inclined orbits at large rgc havedecreased mass loss rates than the non-inclined case, since the strength thedisk potential decreases with rgc. clusters with inclined and eccentric orbitsexperience increased tidal heating due to a constantly changing potential,weaker disk shocks since passages occur at higher rgc, and an additional tidalshock at perigalacticon. the effects of orbital inclination decrease withorbital eccentricity, as a highly eccentric cluster spends the majority of itslifetime at a large rgc. the limiting radii of clusters with inclined orbitsare best represented by the rt of the cluster when at its maximum height abovethe disk, where the cluster spends the majority of its lifetime and the rate ofchange in rt is a minimum. conversely, the effective radius is independent ofinclination in all cases.

1409.2540	evolving molecular cloud structure and the column density probability  distribution function	the structure of molecular clouds can be characterized with the probabilitydistribution function (pdf) of the mass surface density. in particular, theproperties of the distribution can reveal the nature of the turbulence and starformation present inside the molecular cloud. in this paper, we explore howthese structural characteristics evolve with time and also how they relate tovarious cloud properties as measured from a sample of synthetic column densitymaps of molecular clouds. we find that, as a cloud evolves, the peak of itscolumn density pdf will shift to surface densities below the observationalthreshold for detection, resulting in an underlying lognormal distributionwhich has been effectively lost at late times. our results explain why certainobservations of actively star-forming, dynamically older clouds, such as theorion molecular cloud, do not appear to have any evidence of a lognormaldistribution in their column density pdfs. we also study the evolution of theslope and deviation point of the power-law tails for our sample of simulatedclouds and show that both properties trend towards constant values, thuslinking the column density structure of the molecular cloud to the surfacedensity threshold for star formation.

1409.5150	the size of star clusters accreted by the milky way	we perform n-body simulations of a cluster that forms in a dwarf galaxy andis then accreted by the milky way to investigate how a cluster's structure isaffected by a galaxy merger. we find that the cluster's half mass radius willrespond quickly to this change in potential. when the cluster is placed on anorbit in the milky way with a stronger tidal field the cluster experiences asharp decrease in size in response to increased tidal forces. conversely, whenplaced on an orbit with a weaker tidal field the cluster expands since tidalforces decrease and stars moving outwards due to internal effects remain boundat further distances than before. in all cases, we find that the cluster's halfmass radius will eventually be indistinguishable from a cluster that has alwayslived in the milky way on that orbit. these adjustments occur within 1-2 halfmass relaxation times of the cluster in the dwarf galaxy. we also find thiseffect to be qualitatively independent of the time that the cluster is takenfrom the dwarf galaxy. in contrast to the half mass radius, we show the coreradius of the cluster is not affected by the potential the cluster lives in.our work suggests that structural properties of accreted clusters are notdistinct from clusters born in the milky way. other cluster properties, such asmetallicity and horizontal branch morphology, may be the only way to identifyaccreted star clusters in the milky way.

1410.0693	the blue straggler star population in ngc 1261: evidence for a  post-core-collapse bounce state	we present a multi-passband photometric study of the blue straggler star(bss) population in the galactic globular cluster (gc) ngc\,1261, usingavailable space- and ground-based survey data.~the inner bss population isfound to have two distinct sequences in the color-magnitude diagram, similar todouble bss sequences detected in other gcs. these well defined sequences arepresumably linked to single short-lived events such as core collapse, which areexpected to boost the formation of bsss.~in agreement with this, we find a bsssequence in ngc\,1261 which can be well reproduced individually by atheoretical model prediction of a 2 gyr old population of stellar collisionproducts, which are expected to form in the denser inner regions duringshort-lived core contraction phases.~additionally, we report the occurrence ofa group of bsss with unusually blue colours in the cmd, which are consistentwith a corresponding model of a 200 myr old population of stellar collisionproducts.~the properties of the ngc\,1261 bss populations, including theirspatial distributions, suggest an advanced dynamical evolutionary state of thecluster, but the core of this gc does not show the classical signatures ofcore-collapse.~we argue these apparent contradictions provide evidence for apost-core-collapse bounce state seen in dynamical simulations of old gcs.

1410.2248	the state of globular clusters at birth ii: primordial binaries	(abridged) in this paper, we constrain the properties of primordial binarypopulations in galactic globular clusters using the mocca monte carlo code forcluster evolution. our results are compared to the observations of milone etal. (2012) using the photometric binary populations as proxies for the trueunderlying distributions, in order to test the hypothesis that the data areconsistent with an universal initial binary fraction near unity and the binaryorbital parameter distributions of kroupa (1995). with the exception of a fewpossible outliers, we find that the data are to first-order consistent with theuniversality hypothesis. specifically, the present-day binary fractions insidethe half-mass radius r$_{\rm h}$ can be reproduced assuming either high initialbinary fractions near unity with a dominant soft binary component as in thekroupa distribution combined with high initial densities (10$^4$-10$^6$m$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-3}$), or low initial binary fractions ($\sim$ 5-10%) with adominant hard binary component combined with moderate initial densities neartheir present-day values (10$^2$-10$^3$ m$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-3}$). this apparentdegeneracy can be broken using the binary fractions outside r$_{\rm h}$- onlyhigh initial binary fractions with a significant soft component combined withhigh initial densities can contribute to reproducing the observedanti-correlation between the binary fractions outside r$_{\rm h}$ and the totalcluster mass. we further illustrate using the simulated present-day binaryorbital parameter distributions and the technique introduced in leigh et al.(2012) that the relative fractions of hard and soft binaries can be used tofurther constrain the initial cluster density and mass-density relation. ourresults favour an initial mass-density relation of the form r$_{\rm h} \propto$m$_{\rm clus}^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha &lt;$ 1/3.

1507.05653	the spatial structure of young stellar clusters. iii. physical  properties and evolutionary states	we analyze the physical properties of stellar clusters that are detected inmassive star-forming regions in the mystix project--a comparative,multiwavelength study of young stellar clusters within 3.6 kpc that contain atleast one o-type star. tabulated properties of subclusters in these regionsinclude physical sizes and shapes, intrinsic numbers of stars, absorptions bythe molecular clouds, and median subcluster ages. physical signs of dynamicalevolution are present in the relations of these properties, includingstatistically significant correlations between subcluster size, centraldensity, and age, which are likely the result of cluster expansion after gasremoval. we argue that many of the subclusters identified in paper i aregravitationally bound because their radii are significantly less than whatwould be expected from freely expanding clumps of stars with a typical initialstellar velocity dispersion of ~3 km/s for star-forming regions. we explore amodel for cluster formation in which structurally simpler clusters are built uphierarchically through the mergers of subclusters--subcluster mergers areindicated by an inverse relation between the numbers of stars in a subclusterand their central densities (also seen as a density vs. radius relation that isless steep than would be expected from pure expansion). we discuss implicationsof these effects for the dynamical relaxation of young stellar clusters.

1509.02428	the dynamics of multiple populations in the globular cluster ngc 6362	we investigate how the milky way tidal field can affect the spatial mixing ofmultiple stellar populations in the globular cluster ngc 6362. we use $n$-bodysimulations of multiple population clusters on the orbit of this cluster aroundthe milky way. models of the formation of multiple populations in globularclusters predict that the second population should initially be more centrallyconcentrated than the first. however, ngc 6362 is comprised of two chemicallydistinct stellar populations having the same radial distribution. we show thatthe high mass loss rate experienced on this cluster's orbit significantlyaccelerates the spatial mixing of the two populations expected from two bodyrelaxation. we also find that for a range of initial second populationconcentrations, cluster masses, tidal filling factors and fraction of firstpopulation stars, a cluster with two populations should be mixed when it haslost 70-80 per cent of its initial mass. these results fully account for thecomplete spatial mixing of ngc 6362, since, based on its shallow present daymass function, independent studies estimate that the cluster has lost 85 percent of its initial mass.

1510.04290	implications for the formation of blue straggler stars from hst  ultraviolet observations of ngc 188	we present results of a hubble space telescope far-ultraviolet (fuv) surveysearching for white dwarf (wd) companions to blue straggler stars (bsss) inopen cluster ngc 188. the majority of ngc 188 bsss (15 of 21) are single-linedbinaries with properties suggestive of mass-transfer formation via roche lobeoverflow, specifically through an asymptotic giant branch star transferringmass to a main sequence secondary, yielding a bss binary with a wd companion.in ngc 188, a bss formed by this mechanism within the past 400 myr will have awd companion hot and luminous enough to be directly detected as a fuvphotometric excess with hst. comparing expected bss fuv emission to observedphotometry reveals four bsss with wd companions above 12,000 k (younger than250 myr) and three wd companions with temperatures between 11,000-12,000 k.these bss+wd binaries all formed through recent mass transfer. the location ofthe young bsss in an optical color-magnitude diagram (cmd) indicates thatdistance from the zero-age main sequence does not necessarily correlate withbss age. there is no clear cmd separation between mass transfer-formed bsss andthose likely formed through other mechanisms, such as collisions. the sevendetected wd companions place a lower limit on the mass-transfer formationfrequency of 33%. we consider other possible formation mechanisms by comparingproperties of the bss population to theoretical predictions. we conclude that14 bss binaries likely formed from mass transfer, resulting in an inferredmass-transfer formation frequency of approximately 67%.

1510.08187	the properties of bound and unbound molecular cloud populations formed  in galactic disc simulations	we explore the effect of galactic environment on properties of molecularclouds. using clouds formed in a large-scale galactic disc simulation, wemeasure the observable properties from synthetic column density maps. weconfirm that a significant fraction of unbound clouds forms naturally in agalactic disc environment and that a mixed population of bound and unboundclouds can match observed scaling relations and distributions for extragalacticmolecular clouds. by dividing the clouds into inner and outer disc populations,we compare their distributions of properties and test whether there arestatistically significant differences between them. we find that clouds in theouter disc have lower masses, sizes, and velocity dispersions as compared tothose in the inner disc for reasonable choices of the inner/outer boundary. weattribute the differences to the strong impact of galactic shear on the discstability at large galactocentric radii. in particular, our toomre analysis ofthe disc shows a narrowing envelope of unstable masses as a function of radius,resulting in the formation of smaller, lower mass fragments in the outer disc.we also show that the star formation rate is affected by the environment of theparent cloud, and is particularly influenced by the underlying surface densityprofile of the gas throughout the disc. our work highlights the strengths ofusing galaxy-scale simulations to understand the formation and evolution ofcloud properties - and the star formation within them - in the context of theirenvironment.

1510.08533	a hubble space telescope study of the enigmatic milky way halo globular  cluster crater	we analyze the resolved stellar populations of the faint stellar system,crater, based on deep optical imaging taken with the hubble space telescope.the hst/acs-based color-magnitude diagram (cmd) of crater extends $\sim$4magnitudes below the oldest main sequence turnoff, providing excellent leverageon crater's physical properties. structurally, crater has a half-light radiusof $\sim$20 pc and shows no evidence for tidal distortions. crater iswell-described by a simple stellar population with an age of $\sim$7.5 gyr,[m/h]$\sim-1.65$, a m$_{\star}\sim10^4$ m$_{\odot}$, m$_{\rm v}\sim -5.3$,located at a distance of d$\sim$ 145 kpc, with modest uncertainties in theseproperties due to differences in the underlying stellar evolution models. thesparse sampling of stars above the turnoff and sub-giant branch are likely tobe 1.0-1.4 m$_{\odot}$ binary star systems (blue stragglers) and their evolveddescendants, as opposed to intermediate age main sequence stars. confusion ofthese populations highlights a substantial challenge in accuratelycharacterizing sparsely populated stellar systems. our analysis shows thatcrater is not a dwarf galaxy, but instead is an unusually young cluster givenits location in the milky way's very outer stellar halo. crater is similar tosmc cluster lindsay 38, and its position and velocity are in good agreementwith observations and models of the magellanic stream debris, suggesting it mayhave accreted from the magellanic clouds. however, its age and metallicity arealso in agreement with the age-metallicity relationships of lower mass dwarfgalaxies such as leo i or carina. despite uncertainty over its progenitorsystem, crater appears to have been incorporated into the galaxy more recentlythan $z\sim1$ (8 gyr ago), providing an important new constraint on theaccretion history of the milky way.

1511.04122	the dynamical evolution of accreted star clusters in the milky way	we perform $n$-body simulations of star clusters in time-dependant galacticpotentials. since the milky way was built-up through mergers with dwarfgalaxies, its globular cluster population is made up of clusters formed bothduring the initial collapse of the galaxy and in dwarf galaxies that were lateraccreted. throughout a dwarf-milky way merger, dwarf galaxy clusters aresubject to a changing galactic potential. building on our previous work, weinvestigate how this changing galactic potential affects the evolution of acluster's half mass radius. in particular, we simulate clusters on circularorbits around a dwarf galaxy that either falls into the milky way or evaporatesas it orbits the milky way. we find that the dynamical evolution of a starcluster is determined by whichever galaxy has the strongest tidal field at theposition of the cluster. thus, clusters entering the milky way undergo changesin size as the milky way tidal field becomes stronger and that of the dwarfdiminishes. we find that ultimately accreted clusters quickly become the samesize as a cluster born in the milky way on the same orbit. assuming theirinitial sizes are similar, clusters born in the galaxy and those that areaccreted cannot be separated based on their current size alone.

astro-ph;0001065	the angular momentum evolution of very low mass stars	we present theoretical models of the angular momentum evolution of very lowmass stars (0.1 - 0.5 m_sun) and solar analogues (0.6 - 1.1 m_sun). weinvestigate the effect of rotation on the effective temperature and luminosityof these stars. we find that the decrease in t_eff and l can be significant atthe higher end of our mass range, but becomes negligible below 0.4 m_sun.formulae for relating t_eff to mass and v_rot are presented.  we compare our models to rotational data from young open clusters ofdifferent ages to infer the rotational history of low mass stars, and thedependence of initial conditions and rotational evolution on mass. we find thatthe qualitative conclusions for stars below 0.6 m_sun do not depend on theassumptions about internal angular momentum transport, which makes these lowmass stars ideal candidates for the study of the angular momentum loss law anddistribution of initial conditions. we find that neither models with solid bodynor differential rotation can simultaneously reproduce the observed stellarspin down in the 0.6 to 1.1 m_sun mass range and for stars between 0.1 and 0.6m_sun. the most likely explanation is that the saturation threshold drops moresteeply at low masses than would be predicted with a simple rossby scaling. inyoung clusters there is a systematic increase in the mean rotation rate withdecreased temperature below 3500 k (0.4 m_sun). this suggests eitherinefficient angular momentum loss or mass-dependent initial conditions forstars near the fully convective boundary.

astro-ph;0008254	evolution of stellar collision products in globular clusters - ii.  off-axis collision	we continue our exploration of collisionally merged stars in the bluestraggler region of the color-magnitude diagram. we report the results of newsph calculations of parabolic collisions between two main-sequence stars, withthe initial structure and composition profiles of the parent stars having beendetermined from stellar evolution calculations. parallelization of the sph codehas permitted much higher numerical resolution of the hydrodynamics. we alsopresent evolutionary tracks for the resulting collision products, which emergeas rapidly rotating blue stragglers. the rotating collision products arebrighter, bluer and remain on the main sequence longer than their non-rotatingcounterparts. in addition, they retain their rapid rotation rates throughouttheir main sequence lifetime. rotationally-induced mixing strongly affects theevolution of the collision products, although it is not sufficient to mix theentire star. we discuss the implications of these results for studies of bluestraggler populations in clusters. this work shows that off-axis collisionproducts cannot become blue stragglers unless they lose a large fraction oftheir initial angular momentum. the mechanism for this loss is not apparent,although some possibilities are discussed.

astro-ph;0107388	stellar collisions and the interior structure of blue stragglers	collisions of main sequence stars occur frequently in dense star clusters. inopen and globular clusters, these collisions produce merger remnants that maybe observed as blue stragglers. detailed theoretical models of this processrequire lengthy hydrodynamic computations in three dimensions. however, a lesscomputationally expensive approach, which we present here, is to approximatethe merger process (including shock heating, hydrodynamic mixing, massejection, and angular momentum transfer) with simple algorithms based onconservation laws and a basic qualitative understanding of the hydrodynamics.these algorithms have been fine tuned through comparisons with the results ofour previous hydrodynamic simulations. we find that the thermodynamic andchemical composition profiles of our simple models agree very well with thosefrom recent sph (smoothed particle hydrodynamics) calculations of stellarcollisions, and the subsequent stellar evolution of our simple models alsomatches closely that of the more accurate hydrodynamic models. our algorithmshave been implemented in an easy to use software package, which we are makingpublicly available (see http://vassun.vassar.edu/~lombardi/mmas/). thissoftware could be used in combination with realistic dynamical simulations ofstar clusters that must take into account stellar collisions.

astro-ph;0309461	theoretical examination of the lithium depletion boundary	we explore the sensitivity in open cluster ages obtained by the lithiumdepletion boundary (ldb) technique to the stellar model input physics. the ldbage technique is limited to open clusters with ages ranging from 20 to 200 myr.effective 1-sig errors in the ldb technique due to uncertain input physics areroughly 3% at the oldest age increasing to 8% at the youngest age. bolometriccorrection uncertainties add an additional 10 to 6% error to the ldb agetechnique for old and young clusters, respectively. rotation rates matching theobserved fastest rotators in the pleiades affect ldb ages by less than 2%. therange of rotation rates in an open cluster are expected to ``smear'' the ldblocation by only 0.02 mag for a pleiades age cluster increasing to 0.06 mag fora 20 myr cluster. thus, the observational error of locating the ldb (~7-10%)and the bolometric correction uncertainty currently dominate the error in ldbages. for our base case, we formally derive a ldb age of 148 +- 19 myr for thepleiades, where the error includes 8, 3, and 9% contributions fromobservational, theoretical, and bolometric correction sources, respectively. amaximally plausible 0.3 magnitude shift in the i-band bolometric correction toreconcile main sequence isochrone fits with the observed (v-i) color for thelow mass pleiades members results in an age of 126 +- 11 myr, where the errorincludes observational and theoretical errors only. upper main-sequence-fittingages that do not include convective core overshoot for the pleiades (~75 myr)are ruled out by the ldb age technique.

astro-ph;0502126	modeling star formation in dwarf spheroidal galaxies: a case for  extended dark matter halos	we propose a simple model for the formation of dwarf spheroidal galaxies, inwhich stars are assumed to have formed from isothermal gas in hydrostaticequilibrium inside extended dark matter halos. after expelling the leftovergas, the stellar system undergoes a dynamical relaxation inside the dark matterhalo. these models can adequately describe the observed properties of three(draco, sculptor, and carina) out of four galactic dwarf spheroidal satellitesstudied in this paper. we suggest that the fourth galaxy (fornax), which cannotbe fitted well with our model, is observed all the way to its tidal radius. ourbest fitting models have virial masses of ~10^9 m_sun, halo formation redshiftsconsistent with the age of oldest stars in these dwarfs, and shallow inner darkmatter density profiles (with slope gamma -0.5...0). the inferred temperatureof gas is ~10^4 k. in our model, the "extratidal" stars observed in thevicinity of some dwarf spheroidal galaxies are gravitationally bound to thegalaxies and are a part of the extended stellar halos. the inferred virialmasses make galactic dwarf spheroidals massive enough to alleviate the "missingsatellites" problem of lcdm cosmologies.

astro-ph;0511567	constraining global properties of the draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy	by fitting a flexible stellar anisotropy model to the observed surfacebrightness and line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles of draco we derive asequence of cosmologically plausible two-component (stars + dark matter) modelsfor this galaxy. the models are consistent with all the available observationsand can have either cuspy navarro-frenk-white or flat-cored dark matter densityprofiles. the dark matter halos either formed relatively recently (at z~2...7)and are massive (up to ~5x10^9 m_sun), or formed before the end of thereionization of the universe (z~7...11) and are less massive (down to ~7x10^7m_sun). our results thus support either of the two popular solutions of the"missing satellites" problem of lambda cold dark matter cosmology - that dwarfspheroidals are either very massive, or very old. we carry out high-resolutionsimulations of the tidal evolution of our two-component draco models in thepotential of the milky way. the results of our simulations suggest that theobservable properties of draco have not been appreciably affected by thegalactic tides after 10 gyr of evolution. we rule out draco being a "tidaldwarf" - a tidally disrupted dwarf galaxy. almost radial draco orbits (with thepericentric distance &lt;15 kpc) are also ruled out by our analysis. the case of aharmonic dark matter core can be consistent with observations only for a verylimited choice of draco orbits (with the apocentric-to-pericentric distancesratio of &lt;2.5).

astro-ph;0607053	tracing the dynamical history of the globular cluster 47 tucanae	we use two stellar populations in the globular cluster 47 tucanae to traceits dynamical history: blue stragglers and low mass main sequence stars. weassumed that the blue stragglers were formed through stellar collisions in allregions of the cluster. we find that in the core of the cluster, models ofcollisional blue stragglers agree well with the observations as long as bluestragglers are still continuing to form and the mass function in the cluster isextremely biased towards massive stars (x=-8 where a salpeter mass function hasx=+1.35). we show that such an extreme mass function is supported by directmeasurements of the luminosity function of main sequence stars in the centre ofthe cluster. in the middle region of our dataset (25'' to 130'' from thecluster centre), blue straggler formation seems to have stopped about half agyr ago. in the outskirts of the cluster, our models are least successful atreproducing the blue straggler data. taken at face value, they indicate thatblue straggler formation has been insignificant over the past billion years,and that a salpeter mass function applies. however, it is more likely that thedominant formation mechanism in this part of the cluster is not the collisionalone, and that our models are not appropriate for this region of the cluster. weconclude that blue stragglers can be used as tracers of dynamics in globularclusters, despite our incomplete understanding of how and where they wereformed.

astro-ph;0702349	where the blue stragglers roam: searching for a link between formation  and environment	the formation of blue stragglers is still not completely understood,particularly the relationship between formation environment and mechanism. weuse a large, homogeneous sample of blue stragglers in the cores of 57 globularclusters to investigate the relationships between blue straggler populationsand their environments. we use a consistent definition of "blue straggler"based on position in the color-magnitude diagram, and normalize the populationrelative to the number of red giant branch stars in the core. we find that thepreviously determined anti-correlation between blue straggler frequency andtotal cluster mass is present in the purely core population. we find some weakcorrelations with central velocity dispersion and with half-mass relaxationtime. the blue straggler frequency does not show any trend with any othercluster parameter. even though collisions may be expected to be a dominant bluestraggler formation process in globular cluster cores, we find no correlationbetween the frequency of blue stragglers and the collision rate in the core. wealso investigated the blue straggler luminosity function shape, and found norelationship between any cluster parameter and the distribution of bluestragglers in the color-magnitude diagram. our results are inconsistent withsome recent models of blue straggler formation that include collisionalformation mechanisms, and may suggest that almost all observed blue stragglersare formed in binary systems.

astro-ph;0702716	the dynamical implications of multiple stellar formation events in  galactic globular clusters	various galactic globular clusters display abundance anomalies that affectthe morphology of their colour-magnitude diagrams. in this paper we considerthe possibility of helium enhancement in the anomalous horizontal branch of ngc2808. we examine the dynamics of a self-enrichment scenario in which an initialgeneration of stars with a top-heavy initial mass function enriches theinterstellar medium with helium via the low-velocity ejecta of its asymptoticgiant branch stars. this enriched medium then produces a second generation ofstars which are themselves helium-enriched. we use a direct n-body approach toperform five simulations and conclude that such two-generation clusters areboth possible and would not differ significantly from their single-generationcounterparts on the basis of dynamics. we find, however, that the stellarpopulations of such clusters would differ from single-generation clusters witha standard initial mass function and in particular would be enhanced in whitedwarf stars. we conclude, at least from the standpoint of dynamics, thattwo-generation globular clusters are feasible.

astro-ph;9705019	evolution of stellar collision products in globular clusters -- i.  head-on collisions	we explore the evolution of collisionally merged stars in the blue stragglerregion of the hr diagram. the starting models for our stellar evolutioncalculations are the results of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph)simulations of parabolic collisions between main sequence stars performed bylombardi, rasio and shapiro (1996). since sph and stellar evolution codesemploy different and often contradictory approximations, it is necessary totreat the evolution of these products carefully. the mixture and disparity ofthe relevant timescales (hydrodynamic, thermal relaxation and nuclear burning)and of the important physical assumptions between the codes makes the combinedanalysis of the problem challenging, especially during the initial thermalrelaxation of the star. in particular, the treatment of convection isimportant, and semiconvection must be modeled in some detail.  the products of seven head-on collisions are evolved through their initialthermal relaxation, and then through the main sequence phase to the base of thegiant branch. their evolutionary tracks are presented. in contrast to theassumptions in previous work, these collision products do not developsubstantial convective regions during their thermal relaxation, and thereforeare not mixed significantly after the collision.

astro-ph;9805137	the distribution of collisionally induced blue stragglers in the  colour-magnitude diagram	a primary production mechanism for blue stragglers in globular clusters isthought to be collisionally-induced mergers, perhaps mediated by dynamicalencounters involving binary stars. we model the formation and evolution of suchblue stragglers, and produce theoretical distributions of them in thecolour-magnitude diagram. we use a crude representation of cluster dynamics anddetailed binary-single star encounter simulations to produce cross sections andrates for a variety of collisions. the results of the collisions are determinedbased on sph simulations of realistic star models. the evolution of thecollision products are then followed in detail.  we use our results to explore the effects of a variety of input assumptionson the number and kind of blue stragglers created by collisions. in particular,we describe the changes in the blue straggler distribution that result fromusing realistic collision products rather than the ``fully-mixed'' assumption,and from changes in assumptions about the number and orbital perioddistribution of the primordial binary population. we then apply our models toexisting data from the core of m3, where the large blue straggler population isthought to be dominated by collision products. we find that we have difficultysuccessfully modeling the observed blue stragglers under a single consistentset of assumptions. however, if 3 particularly bright blue stragglers areconsidered to be part of a different observed population, the remainder can besuccessfully modeled using realistic encounter products and assuming a 20%binary fraction with plausible period distribution.

astro-ph;9807290	tests of spurious transport in smoothed particle hydrodynamics	we have performed a series of systematic tests to evaluate the effects ofspurious transport in three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph)calculations. our tests investigate (i) particle diffusion, (ii) shock heating,(iii) numerical viscosity, and (iv) angular momentum transport. the results areuseful for quantifying the accuracy of the sph scheme, especially for problemswhere shear flows or shocks are present, as well as for problems where truehydrodynamic mixing is relevant.  we examine the different forms of artificial viscosity (av) which have beenproposed by monaghan, by hernquist &amp; katz, and by balsara. for each form, ourtests suggest a single set of values for the av parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$(coefficients of the linear and quadratic terms) which are appropriate in alarge number of situations. we also discuss how these parameters should beadjusted depending on the goals of the particular application. we find thatboth the hernquist &amp; katz and balsara forms introduce relatively small amountsof numerical viscosity. furthermore, both monaghan's and balsara's av do wellat treating shocks and at limiting the amount of spurious mixing. for thesereasons, we endorse the balsara av for use in a broad range of applications.

astro-ph;9911507	rotational velocities of low-mass stars in the pleiades and hyades	we have obtained high-resolution spectra of 89 m dwarf members of thepleiades and hyades and have derived radial velocities, h-alpha equivalentwidths, and spectroscopic rotational velocities for these stars. typical massesof the newly-observed pleiades and hyades stars are ~ 0.4 m_{\sun} and ~ 0.2m_{\sun}, respectively. we combine our new observations with previouslypublished data to explore the rotational evolution of young stars with m &lt; 0.4m_\sun. the average rotation rate in the hyades (age 600 myr) is about 0.4 thatof the pleiades (110 myr), and the mean equivalent widths of h-alpha are alsolower. as found in previous studies, the correlation between rotation andchromospheric activity is identical in both clusters, implying that the loweractivity in the hyades is a result of the lower rotation rates. we show that asimple scaling of the pleiades rotational distribution for m \leq 0.4 m_{\sun},corrected for the effects of structural evolution, matches that of the hyadesif the average angular momentum loss from the pleiades to the hyades age isfactor of \approx 6. this suggests that the distribution of initial angularmomenta and disk-locking lifetimes for the lowest mass stars was similar inboth clusters. we argue that this result provides further evidence for asaturation of the angular momentum loss rate at high rotational velocities.
