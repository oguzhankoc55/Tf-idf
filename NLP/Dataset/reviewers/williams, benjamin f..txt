0902.3460	the detection of inside-out disk growth in m33	we present resolved stellar photometry of 4 fields along the major axis ofthe m33 disk from images taken with the advanced camera for surveys aboard thehubble space telescope. the photometry provides a detailed census of the redclump in all fields and reaches the ancient main sequence in the outermostfield. through detailed modeling of the color-magnitude diagrams, we find thatthe percentage of the stellar mass formed prior to z=1 changes from 71 +/- 9%in the innermost field to 16 +/- 6% in the outermost field. the disk shows aclear trend of increasing scale-length with time, evolving from 1.0 +/- 0.1 kpc10 gyr ago to 1.8 +/- 0.1 kpc at times more recent than 5 gyr ago, in agreementwith analytical predictions for disk growth. beyond the disk truncation radius,however, the stellar density profile steepens with time and the age gradientreverses, in agreement with recent simulations. the late and slow growth of thestellar disk may be due in part to the low mass of m33.

0905.3737	the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury	the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury (angst) is a systematic survey toestablish a legacy of uniform multi-color photometry of resolved stars for avolume-limited sample of nearby galaxies (d&lt;4 mpc). the survey volumeencompasses 69 galaxies in diverse environments, including close pairs, small &amp;large groups, filaments, and truly isolated regions. the galaxies include anearly complete range of morphological types spanning a factor of ~10^4 inluminosity and star formation rate. the survey data consists of images takenwith acs on hst, supplemented with archival data and new wfpc2 imaging takenafter the failure of acs. survey images include wide field tilings covering thefull radial extent of each galaxy, and single deep pointings in uncrowdedregions of the most massive galaxies in the volume. the new wide field imagingin angst reaches median 50% completenesses of m_f475w=28.0 mag, m_f606w=27.3mag, and m_f814w=27.3 mag, several magnitudes below the tip of the red giantbranch (trgb). the deep fields reach magnitudes sufficient to fully resolve thestructure in the red clump. the resulting photometric catalogs are publiclyaccessible and contain over 34 million photometric measurements of &gt;14 millionstars. in this paper we present the details of the sample selection, imaging,data reduction, and the resulting photometric catalogs, along with an analysisof the photometric uncertainties (systematic and random), for both the acs andwfpc2 imaging. we also present uniformly derived relative distances measuredfrom the apparent magnitude of the trgb.

0907.0710	the ngc 300 transient: an alternative method for measuring progenitor  masses	we present an alternative technique for measuring the precursor masses oftransient events in stars undergoing late stage stellar evolution. we use thewell-established techniques of stellar population modeling to age-date thestars surrounding the site of the recent transient event in ngc 300 (ngc 300ot2008-1). the surrounding stars must share a common turnoff mass with thetransient, since almost all stars form in stellar clusters that remainphysically associated for periods longer than the lifetime of the most massivestars. we find that the precursor of ngc 300 ot2008-1 is surrounded by starsthat formed in a single burst between 8-13 myr ago, with 70% confidence. thetransient was therefore likely to be due to a progenitor whose mass fallsbetween the main sequence turnoff mass (12 msun) and the maximum stellar mass(25 msun) found for isochrones bounding this age range. we characterize thegeneral applicability of this technique in identifying precursor masses ofhistoric and future transients and supernovae (sne), noting that it requiresneither precursor imaging nor sub-arcsecond accuracy in the position of thetransient. it is also based on the well-understood physics of the mainsequence, and thus may be a more reliable source of precursor masses thanfitting evolutionary tracks to precursor magnitudes. we speculate that if theprogenitor mass is close to 17 msun, there may be a connection between opticaltransients such as ngc 300 ot2008-1 and the missing type ii-p sne, known as the"red supergiant problem."

0911.4121	the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury iv. the star formation history of  ngc 2976	we present resolved stellar photometry of ngc 2976 obtained with the advancedcamera for surveys (acs) as part of the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury(angst) program. the data cover the radial extent of the major axis of the diskout to 6 kpc, or ~6 scale lengths. the outer disk was imaged to a depth ofm_f606w ~ 1, and an inner field was imaged to the crowding limit at a depth ofm_f606w ~ -1. through detailed analysis and modeling of these cmds we havereconstructed the star formation history of the stellar populations currentlyresiding in these portions of the galaxy, finding similar ancient populationsat all radii but significantly different young populations at increasing radii.in particular, outside of the well-measured break in the disk surfacebrightness profile, the age of the youngest population increases with distancefrom the galaxy center, suggesting that star formation is shutting down fromthe outside-in. we use our measured star formation history, along with h isurface density measurements, to reconstruct the surface density profile of thedisk during previous epochs. comparisons between the recovered star formationrates and reconstructed gas densities at previous epochs are consistent withstar formation following the schmidt law during the past 0.5 gyrs, but with adrop in star formation efficiency at low gas densities, as seen in localgalaxies at the present day. the current rate and gas density suggest thatrapid star formation in ngc 2976 is currently in the process of ceasing fromthe outside-in due to gas depletion. this process of outer disk gas depletionand inner disk star formation was likely triggered by an interaction with thecore of the m81 group &gt;~1 gyr ago that stripped the gas from the galaxy haloand/or triggered gas inflow from the outer disk toward the galaxy center.

1002.1743	the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury v. radial star formation history  of ngc 300	we present new hubble space telescope (hst) observations of ngc 300 taken aspart of the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury (angst). individual stars areresolved in these images down to an absolute magnitude of m_f814w = 1.0 (belowthe red clump). we determine the star formation history of the galaxy in 6radial bins by comparing our observed color-magnitude diagrams (cmds) withsynthetic cmds based on theoretical isochrones. we find that the stellar diskout to 5.4 kpc is primarily old, in contrast with the outwardly similar galaxym33. we determine the scale length as a function of age and find evidence forinside-out growth of the stellar disk: the scale length has increased from 1.1+/- 0.1 kpc 10 gyr ago to 1.3 +/- 0.1 kpc at present, indicating a buildup inthe fraction of young stars at larger radii. as the scale length of m33 hasrecently been shown to have increased much more dramatically with time, ourresults demonstrate that two galaxies with similar sizes and morphologies canhave very different histories. with an n-body simulation of a galaxy designedto be similar to ngc 300, we determine that the effects of radial migrationshould be minimal. we trace the metallicity gradient as a function of time andfind a present day metallicity gradient consistent with that seen in previousstudies. consistent results are obtained from archival images covering the sameradial extent but differing in placement and filter combination.

1009.4618	the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury ix. constraining asymptotic giant  branch evolution with old metal-poor galaxies	in an attempt to constrain evolutionary models of the asymptotic giant branch(agb) phase at the limit of low masses and low metallicities, we have examinedthe luminosity functions and number ratio between agb and red giant branch(rgb) stars from a sample of resolved galaxies from the acs nearby galaxysurvey treasury (angst). this database provides hst optical photometry togetherwith maps of completeness, photometric errors, and star formation histories fordozens of galaxies within 4 mpc. we select 12 galaxies characterized bypredominantly metal-poor populations as indicated by a very steep and blue rgb,and which do not present any indication of recent star formation in theircolor--magnitude diagrams. thousands of agb stars brighter than the tip of thergb (trgb) are present in the sample (between 60 and 400 per galaxy), hence thepoisson noise has little impact in our measurements of the agb/rgb ratio. wemodel the photometric data with a few sets of thermally pulsing agb (tp-agb)evolutionary models with different prescriptions for the mass loss. thistechnique allows us to set stringent constraints to the tp-agb models oflow-mass metal-poor stars (with m&lt;1.5 msun, [fe/h]&lt;~-1.0). indeed, those whichsatisfactorily reproduce the observed agb/rgb ratios have tp-agb lifetimesbetween 1.2 and 1.8 myr, and finish their nuclear burning lives with massesbetween 0.51 and 0.55 msun. this is also in good agreement with recentobservations of white dwarf masses in the m4 old globular cluster. theseconstraints can be added to those already derived from magellanic cloud starclusters as important mileposts in the arduous process of calibrating agbevolutionary models.

1104.0981	a deep chandra view of the ngc 404 central engine	we present the results of a 100 ks {\it chandra} observation of the ngc 404nuclear region. the long exposure and excellent spatial resolution of {\itchandra} has enabled us to critically examine the nuclear environment of ngc404, which is known to host a nuclear star cluster and potentially anintermediate-mass black hole (on the order of a few times $10^5$ \msun). wefind two distinct x-ray sources: a hard, central point source coincident withthe optical and radio centers of the galaxy, and a soft extended region that iscoincident with areas of high h$\alpha$ emission and likely recent starformation. when we fit the 0.3-8 kev spectra of each region separately, we findthe hard nuclear point source to be dominated by a power law (\pl = 1.88),while the soft off-nuclear region is best fit by a thermal plasma model ($kt$ =0.67 kev). we therefore find evidence for both a power law component and hotgas in the nuclear region of ngc 404. we estimate the 2-10 kev luminosity to be1.3$^{+0.8}_{-0.5}\times10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$. a low-level of diffuse x-rayemission is detected out to $\sim$15\as ($\sim$0.2 kpc) from the nucleus. wecompare our results to the observed relationships between power law photonindex and eddington ratio for both x-ray binaries and low luminosity activegalaxies and find ngc 404 to be consistent with other low luminosity activegalaxies. we therefore favor the conclusion that ngc 404 harbors anintermediate-mass black hole accreting at a very low level.

1105.2571	the history of star formation in galaxy disks in the local volume as  measured by the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury	we present a measurement of the age distribution of stars residing in spiraldisks and dwarf galaxies. we derive a complete star formation history of the~140 mpc^3 covered by the volume-limited sample of galaxies in the advancedcamera for surveys (acs) nearby galaxy survey treasury (angst). the total starformation rate density history is dominated by the large spirals in the volume,although the sample consists mainly of dwarf galaxies. our measurement shows afactor of ~3 drop at z~2, in approximate agreement with results from othermeasurement techniques. while our results show that the overall star formationrate density has decreased since z~1, the measured rates during this epoch arehigher than those obtained from other measurement techniques. this enhancedrecent star formation rate appears to be largely due to an increase in thefraction of star formation contained in low-mass disks at recent times.finally, our results indicate that despite the differences at recent times, theepoch of formation of ~50% of the stellar mass in dwarf galaxies was similar tothat of ~50% of the stellar mass in large spiral galaxies (z&gt;~2), despite theobserved galaxy-to-galaxy diversity among the dwarfs.

1201.4859	the star formation history of leo t from hubble space telescope imaging	we present the star formation history (sfh) of the faintest knownstar-forming galaxy, leo t, based on imaging taken with the hubble spacetelescope (hst) wide field planetary camera 2 (wfpc2). the hst/wfpc2color-magnitude diagram (cmd) of leo t is exquisitely deep, extending ~ 2magnitudes below the oldest main sequence turnoff, permitting excellentconstraints on star formation at all ages. we use a maximum likelihood cmdfitting technique to measure the sfh of leo t assuming three different sets ofstellar evolution models: padova (solar-scaled metallicity) and basti (bothsolar-scaled and alpha-enhanced metallicities). the resulting sfhs areremarkably consistent at all ages, indicating that our derived sfh is robust tothe choice of stellar evolution model. from the lifetime sfh of leo t, we findthat 50% of the total stellar mass formed prior to z ~ 1 (7.6 gyr ago).subsequent to this epoch, the sfh of leo t is roughly constant until the mostrecent ~ 25 myr, where the sfh shows an abrupt drop. this decrease could be dueto a cessation of star formation or stellar initial mass function samplingeffects, but we are unable to distinguish between the two scenarios. overall,our measured sfh is consistent with previously derived sfhs of leo t. however,the hst-based solution provides improved age resolution and reduceduncertainties at all epochs. the sfh, baryonic gas fraction, and location ofleo t are unlike any of the other recently discovered faint dwarf galaxies inthe local group, and instead bear strong resemblance to gas-rich dwarf galaxies(irregular or transition), suggesting that gas-rich dwarf galaxies may sharecommon modes of star formation over a large range of stellar mass (~ 10^5-10^9msun).

1202.4783	the contribution of tp-agb and rheb stars to the near-ir luminosity of  local galaxies: implications for stellar mass measurements of high redshift  galaxies	using high spatial resolution hst wfc3 and acs imaging of resolved stellarpopulations, we constrain the contribution of thermally-pulsing asymptoticgiant branch (tp-agb) stars and red helium burning (rheb) stars to the 1.6 umnear-infrared (nir) luminosities of 23 nearby galaxies. the tp-agb phasecontributes as much as 17% of the integrated f160w flux, even when the redgiant branch is well populated. the rheb population contribution can match oreven exceed the tp-agb contribution, providing as much as 21% of the integratedf160w light. the nir mass-to-light (m/l) ratio should therefore be expected tovary significantly due to fluctuations in the star formation rate overtimescales from 25 myr to several gyr. we compare our observational results topredictions based on optically derived star formation histories and stellarpopulation synthesis (sps) models, including models based on the padovaisochrones (used in popular sps programs). the sps models generally reproducethe expected numbers of tp-agb stars in the sample. the same sps models,however, give a larger discrepancy in the f160w flux contribution from thetp-agb stars, over-predicting the flux by a weighted mean factor of 2.3 +/-0.8.this larger offset is driven by the prediction of modest numbers of highluminosity tp-agb stars at young (&lt;300 myrs) ages. the best-fit sps modelssimultaneously tend to under-predict the numbers and fluxes of stars on therheb sequence, typically by a factor of 2.0+/-0.6 for galaxies with significantnumbers of rhebs. coincidentally, over-prediction of the tp-agb andunder-prediction of the rhebs result in a nir m/l ratio largely unchanged for arapid star formation rate. however, the nir-to-optical flux ratio of galaxiescould be significantly smaller than agb-rich models would predict, an outcomethat has been observed in some intermediate redshift post-starburst galaxies.(abridged)

1205.2732	observational constraints on the molecular gas content in nearby  starburst dwarf galaxies	using star formation histories derived from optically resolved stellarpopulations in nineteen nearby starburst dwarf galaxies observed with thehubble space telescope, we measure the stellar mass surface densities of starsnewly formed in the bursts. by assuming a star formation efficiency (sfe), wethen calculate the inferred gas surface densities present at the onset of thestarbursts. assuming a sfe of 1%, as is often assumed in normal star-forminggalaxies, and assuming that the gas was purely atomic, translates to very highhi surface densities (~10^2-10^3 msun pc^-2), which are much higher than havebeen observed in dwarf galaxies. this implies either higher values of sfe inthese dwarf starburst galaxies or the presence of significant amounts of h_2 indwarfs (or both). raising the assumed sfes to 10% or greater (in line withobservations of more massive starbursts associated with merging galaxies),still results in hi surface densities higher than observed in 10 galaxies.thus, these observations appear to require that a significant fraction of thegas in these dwarf starbursts galaxies was in the molecular form at the onsetof the bursts. our results imply molecular gas column densities in the range10^19-10^21 cm^-2 for the sample. in those galaxies where co observations havebeen made, these densities correspond to values of the co-h_2 conversion factor(x_co) in the range &gt;3-80x10^20 cm^-2 (k km s^-1)^-1, or up to 40x greater thangalactic x_co values.

1206.4045	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury i: bright uv stars in the  bulge of m31	as part of the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury (phat) multi-cycleprogram, we observed a 12' \times 6.5' area of the bulge of m31 with thewfc3/uvis filters f275w and f336w. from these data we have assembled a sampleof \sim4000 uv-bright, old stars, vastly larger than previously available. weuse updated padova stellar evolutionary tracks to classify these hot stars intothree classes: post-agb stars (p-agb), post-early agb (pe-agb) stars andagb-manqu\'e stars. p-agb stars are the end result of the asymptotic giantbranch (agb) phase and are expected in a wide range of stellar populations,whereas pe-agb and agb-manqu\'e (together referred to as the hotpost-horizontal branch; hp-hb) stars are the result of insufficient envelopemasses to allow a full agb phase, and are expected to be particularly prominentat high helium or {\alpha} abundances when the mass loss on the rgb is high.our data support previous claims that most uv-bright sources in the bulge arelikely hot (extreme) horizontal branch stars (ehb) and their progeny. weconstruct the first radial profiles of these stellar populations, and show thatthey are highly centrally concentrated, even more so than the integrated uv oroptical light. however, we find that this uv-bright population does notdominate the total uv luminosity at any radius, as we are detecting only theprogeny of the ehb stars that are the likely source of the uvx. we calculatethat only a few percent of ms stars in the central bulge can have gone throughthe hp-hb phase and that this percentage decreases strongly with distance fromthe center. we also find that the surface density of hot uv-bright stars hasthe same radial variation as that of low-mass x-ray binaries. we discuss age,metallicity, and abundance variations as possible explanations for the observedradial variation in the uv-bright population.

1209.2416	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury ii. tracing the inner m31  halo with blue horizontal branch stars	we attempt to constrain the shape of m31's inner stellar halo by tracing thesurface density of blue horizontal branch (bhb) stars at galactocentricdistances ranging from 2 kpc to 35 kpc. our measurements make use of resolvedstellar photometry from a section of the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury(phat) survey, supplemented by several archival hubble space telescopeobservations. we find that the ratio of bhb to red giant stars is relativelyconstant outside of 10 kpc, suggesting that the bhb is as reliable a tracer ofthe halo population as the red giant branch. in the inner halo, we do notexpect bhb stars to be produced by the high metallicity bulge and disk, makingbhb stars a good candidate to be a reliable tracer of the stellar halo to muchsmaller galactocentric distances. if we assume a power-law profile r^(-\alpha)for the 2-d projected surface density bhb distribution, we obtain ahigh-quality fit with a 2-d power-law index of \alpha=2.6^{+0.3}_{-0.2} outsideof 3 kpc, which flattens to \alpha&lt;1.2 inside of 3 kpc. this slope isconsistent with previous measurements but is anchored to a radial baseline thatextends much farther inward. finally, assuming azimuthal symmetry and aconstant mass-to-light ratio, the best-fitting profile yields a total halostellar mass of 2.1^{+1.7}_{-0.4} x 10^9 m_sun. these properties are comparablewith both simulations of stellar halo formation formed by satellite disruptionalone, and with simulations that include some in situ formation of halo stars.

1210.6353	supernova remnant progenitor masses in m31	using hst photometry, we age-date 59 supernova remnants (snrs) in the spiralgalaxy m31 and use these ages to estimate zero-age main sequence masses (mzams)for their progenitors. to accomplish this, we create color-magnitude diagrams(cmds) and use cmd fitting to measure the recent star formation history (sfh)of the regions surrounding cataloged snr sites. we identify any young coevalpopulation that likely produced the progenitor star and assign an age anduncertainty to that population. application of stellar evolution models allowsus to infer the mzams from this age. because our technique is not contingent onprecise location of the progenitor star, it can be applied to the location ofany known snr. we identify significant young sf around 53 of the 59 snrs andassign progenitor masses to these, representing a factor of 2 increase overcurrently measured progenitor masses. we consider the remaining 6 snrs aseither probable type ia candidates or the result of core-collapse progenitorsthat have escaped their birth sites. the distribution of recovered progenitormasses is bottom heavy, showing a paucity of the most massive stars. if weassume a single power law distribution, dn/dm proportional to m^alpha, we finda distribution that is steeper than a salpeter imf (alpha=-2.35). inparticular, we find values of alpha outside the range -2.7 to -4.4 inconsistentwith our measured distribution at 95% confidence. if instead we assume adistribution that follows a salpeter imf up to some maximum mass, we find thatvalues of m_max greater than 26 msun are inconsistent with the measureddistribution at 95% confidence. in either scenario, the data suggest that somefraction of massive stars may not explode. the result is preliminary andrequires more snrs and further analysis. in addition, we use our distributionto estimate a minimum mass for core collapse between 7.0 and 7.8 msun.

1211.6105	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury iv. a probabilistic approach  to inferring the high mass stellar initial mass function and other power-law  functions	we present a probabilistic approach for inferring the parameters of thepresent day power-law stellar mass function (mf) of a resolved young starcluster. this technique (a) fully exploits the information content of a givendataset; (b) accounts for observational uncertainties in a straightforward way;(c) assigns meaningful uncertainties to the inferred parameters; (d) avoids thepitfalls associated with binning data; and (e) is applicable to virtually anyresolved young cluster, laying the groundwork for a systematic study of thehigh mass stellar mf (m &gt; 1 msun). using simulated clusters and markov chainmonte carlo sampling of the probability distribution functions, we show thatestimates of the mf slope, {\alpha}, are unbiased and that the uncertainty,{\delta}{\alpha}, depends primarily on the number of observed stars and stellarmass range they span, assuming that the uncertainties on individual masses andthe completeness are well-characterized. using idealized mock data, we computethe lower limit precision on {\alpha} and provide an analytic approximation for{\delta}{\alpha} as a function of the observed number of stars and mass range.we find that ~ 3/4 of quoted literature uncertainties are smaller than thetheoretical lower limit. by correcting these uncertainties to the theoreticallower limits, we find the literature studies yield &lt;{\alpha}&gt;=2.46 with a1-{\sigma} dispersion of 0.35 dex. we verify that it is impossible for apower-law mf to obtain meaningful constraints on the upper mass limit of theimf. we show that avoiding substantial biases in the mf slope requires: (1)including the mf as a prior when deriving individual stellar mass estimates;(2) modeling the uncertainties in the individual stellar masses; and (3) fullycharacterizing and then explicitly modeling the completeness for stars of agiven mass.

1301.3955	observations of the wasp-2 system by the apostle program	we present transit observations of the wasp-2 exoplanet system by the apachepoint survey of transit lightcurves of exoplanets (apostle) program. modelfitting to these data allows us to improve measurements of the hot-jupiterexoplanet wasp-2b and its orbital parameters by a factor of ~2 over priorstudies; we do not find evidence for transit depth variations. we do findreduced chi^2 values greater than 1.0 in the observed minus computed transittimes. a sinusoidal fit to the residuals yields a timing semi-amplitude of 32seconds and a period of 389 days. however, random rearrangements of the dataprovide similar quality fits, and we cannot with certainty ascribe the timingvariations to mutual exoplanet interactions. this inconclusive result isconsistent with the lack of incontrovertible transit timing variations (ttvs)observed in other hot-jupiter systems. this outcome emphasizes that uniquerecognition of ttvs requires dense sampling of the libration cycle (e.g.continuous observations from space-based platforms). however, even in systemsobserved with the kepler spacecraft, there is a noted lack of transitingcompanions and ttvs in hot-jupiter systems. this result is more meaningful, andindicates that hot-jupiter systems, while they are easily observable from theground, do not appear to be currently configured in a manner favorable to thedetection of ttvs. the future of ground-based ttv studies may reside inresolving secular trends, and/or implementation at extreme quality observingsites to minimize atmospheric red noise.

1305.7243	measuring galaxy star formation rates from integrated photometry:  insights from color-magnitude diagrams of resolved stars	we use empirical star formation histories (sfhs), measured from hst-basedresolved star color-magnitude diagrams, as input into population synthesiscodes to model the broadband spectral energy distributions (seds) of ~50 nearbydwarf galaxies (6.5 &lt; log m/m_* &lt; 8.5, with metallicities ~10% solar). in thepresence of realistic sfhs, we compare the modeled and observed seds from theultraviolet (uv) through near-infrared (nir) and assess the reliability ofwidely used uv-based star formation rate (sfr) indicators. in the fuv through ibands, we find that the observed and modeled seds are in excellent agreement.in the spitzer 3.6micron and 4.5micron bands, we find that modeled sedssystematically over-predict observed luminosities by up to ~0.2 dex, dependingon treatment of the tp-agb stars in the synthesis models. we assess thereliability of uv luminosity as a sfr indicator, in light of independentlyconstrained sfhs. we find that fluctuations in the sfhs alone can cause factorof ~2 variations in the uv luminosities relative to the assumption of aconstant sfh over the past 100 myr. these variations are not stronglycorrelated with uv-optical colors, implying that correcting uv-based sfrs forthe effects of realistic sfhs is difficult using only the broadband sed.additionally, for this diverse sample of galaxies, we find that stars olderthan 100 myr can contribute from &lt;5% to100% of the present day uv luminosity,highlighting the challenges in defining a characteristic star formationtimescale associated with uv emission. we do find a relationship between uvemission timescale and broadband uv-optical color, though it is different thanpredictions based on exponentially declining sfh models. our findings havesignificant implications for the comparison of uv-based sfrs acrosslow-metallicity populations with diverse sfhs.

1306.2420	timescales on which star formation affects the neutral ism	turbulent neutral hydrogen (hi) line widths are often thought to be drivenprimarily by star formation (sf), but the timescale for converting sf energy tohi kinetic energy is unclear. as a complication, studies on the connectionbetween hi line widths and sf in external galaxies often use broadband tracersfor the sf rate, which must implicitly assume that sf histories (sfhs) havebeen constant over the timescale of the tracer. in this paper, we comparemeasures of hi energy to time-resolved sfhs in a number of nearby dwarfgalaxies. we find that hi energy surface density is strongly correlated onlywith sf that occurred 30-40 myr ago. this timescale corresponds to theapproximate lifetime of the lowest mass supernova progenitors (~ 8 msun). thisanalysis suggests that the coupling between sf and the neutral ism is strongeston this timescale, due either to an intrinsic delay between the release of thepeak energy from sf or to the coherent effects of many sne during thisinterval. at \sigma_sfr &gt; 10^-3 msun yr^-1 kpc^-2, we find a mean couplingefficiency between sf energy and hi energy of \epsilon = 0.11 +/- 0.04 usingthe 30-40 myr timescale. however, unphysical efficiencies are required in lower\sigma_sfr systems, implying that sf is not the primary driver of hi kinematicsat \sigma_sfr &lt; 10^-3 msun yr^-1 kpc^-2.

1310.4179	a new approach to detailed structural decomposition from the splash and  phat surveys: kicked-up disk stars in the andromeda galaxy?	we characterize the bulge, disk, and halo subcomponents in the andromedagalaxy (m31) over the radial range 4 &lt; r_proj &lt; 225 kpc. the cospatial natureof these subcomponents renders them difficult to disentangle using surfacebrightness (sb) information alone, especially interior to ~20 kpc. our newdecomposition technique combines information from the luminosity function (lf)of over 1.5 million bright (20 &lt; m_814w &lt; 22) stars from the panchromatichubble andromeda treasury (phat) survey, radial velocities of over 5000 redgiant branch stars in the same magnitude range from the spectroscopic andphotometric landscape of andromeda's stellar halo (splash) survey, andintegrated i-band sb profiles from various sources. we use an affine-invariantmarkov chain monte carlo algorithm to fit an appropriate toy model to thesethree data sets. the bulge, disk, and halo sb profiles are modeled as a sersic,exponential, and cored power-law, respectively, and the lfs are modeled asbroken power-laws. we present probability distributions for each of 32parameters describing the sb profiles and lfs of the three subcomponents. wefind that the number of stars with a disk-like lf is ~5% larger than the thenumber with disk-like (dynamically cold) kinematics, suggesting that some starsborn in the disk have been dynamically heated to the point that they arekinematically indistinguishable from halo members. this is the firstkinematical evidence for a "kicked-up disk" halo population in m31. thefraction of kicked-up disk stars is consistent with that found in simulations.we also find evidence for a radially varying disk lf, consistent with anegative metallicity gradient in the stellar disk.

1410.0018	the supernova progenitor mass distributions of m31 and m33: further  evidence for an upper mass limit	using hubble space telescope (hst) photometry to measure star formationhistories, we age-date the stellar populations surrounding supernova remnants(snrs) in m31 and m33. we then apply stellar evolution models to the ages toinfer the corresponding masses for their supernova progenitor stars. we analyze33 m33 snr progenitors and 29 m31 snr progenitors in this work. we then combinethese measurements with 53 previously published m31 snr progenitor measurementsto bring our total number of progenitor mass estimates to 115. to quantify themass distributions, we fit power laws of the form $dn/dm \propto m^{-\alpha}$.our new, larger sample of m31 progenitors follows a distribution with $\alpha =4.4\pm 0.4$, and the m33 sample follows a distribution with $\alpha =3.8^{+0.4}_{-0.5}$. thus both samples are consistent within the uncertainties,and the full sample across both galaxies gives $\alpha = 4.2\pm 0.3$. both theindividual and full distributions display a paucity of massive stars whencompared to a salpeter initial mass function (imf), which we would expect toobserve if all massive stars exploded as sn that leave behind observable snr.if we instead fix $\alpha = 2.35$ and treat the maximum mass as a freeparameter, we find $m_{max} \sim 35-45m_{sun}$, indicative of a potentialmaximum cutoff mass for sn production. our results suggest that either snrsurveys are biased against finding objects in the youngest (&lt;10 myr old)regions, or the highest mass stars do not produce sne.

1501.06631	tracing the metal-poor m31 stellar halo with blue horizontal branch  stars	we have analyzed new hst/acs and hst/wfc3 imaging in f475w and f814w of twopreviously-unobserved fields along the m31 minor axis to confirm our previousconstraints on the shape of m31's inner stellar halo. both of these newdatasets reach a depth of at least f814w$&lt;$27 and clearly detect the bluehorizontal branch (bhb) of the field as a distinct feature of thecolor-magnitude diagram. we measure the density of bhb stars and the ratio ofbhb to red giant branch stars in each field using identical techniques to ourprevious work. we find excellent agreement with our previous measurement of apower-law for the 2-d projected surface density with an index of2.6$^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ outside of 3 kpc, which flattens to $\alpha &lt;$1.2 inside of3 kpc. our findings confirm our previous suggestion that the field bhb stars inm31 are part of the halo population. however, the total halo profile is nowknown to differ from this bhb profile, which suggests that we have isolated themetal-poor component. this component appears to have an unbroken power-lawprofile from 3-150 kpc but accounts for only about half of the total halostellar mass. discrepancies between the bhb density profile and othermeasurements of the inner halo are therefore likely due to the differentprofile of the metal-rich halo component, which is not only steeper than theprofile of the met al-poor component, but also has a larger core radius. theseprofile differences also help to explain the large ratio of bhb/rgb stars inour observations.

1502.03820	a clear age-velocity dispersion correlation in andromeda's stellar disk	the stellar kinematics of galactic disks are key to constraining diskformation and evolution processes. in this paper, for the first time, wemeasure the stellar age-velocity dispersion correlation in the inner 20 kpc(3.5 disk scale lengths) of m31 and show that it is dramatically different fromthat in the milky way. we use optical hubble space telescope/advanced camerafor surveys photometry of 5800 individual stars from the panchromatic hubbleandromeda treasury (phat) survey and keck/deimos radial velocity measurementsof the same stars from the spectroscopic and photometric landscape ofandromeda's stellar halo (splash) survey. we show that the averageline-of-sight velocity dispersion is a steadily increasing function of stellarage exterior to r=10 kpc, increasing from 30 km/s for the young upper mainsequence stars to 90 km/s for the old red giant branch stars. this monotonicincrease implies that a continuous or recurring process contributed to theevolution of the disk. both the slope and normalization of the dispersion vs.age relation are significantly larger than in the milky way, allowing for thepossibility that the disk of m31 has had a more violent history than the diskof the milky way, more in line with cosmological predictions. we also findevidence for an inhomogeneous distribution of stars from a second kinematicalcomponent in addition to the dominant disk component. one of the largest andhottest high-dispersion patches is present in all age bins, and may be thesignature of the end of the long bar.

1502.06621	the high-mass stellar initial mass function in m31 clusters	we have undertaken the largest systematic study of the high-mass stellarinitial mass function (imf) to date using the optical color-magnitude diagrams(cmds) of 85 resolved, young (4 myr &lt; t &lt; 25 myr), intermediate mass starclusters (10^3-10^4 msun), observed as part of the panchromatic hubbleandromeda treasury (phat) program. we fit each cluster's cmd to measure itsmass function (mf) slope for stars &gt;2 msun. for the ensemble of clusters, thedistribution of stellar mf slopes is best described by$\gamma=+1.45^{+0.03}_{-0.06}$ with a very small intrinsic scatter. the dataalso imply no significant dependencies of the mf slope on cluster age, mass,and size, providing direct observational evidence that the measured mfrepresents the imf. this analysis implies that the high-mass imf slope in m31clusters is universal with a slope ($\gamma=+1.45^{+0.03}_{-0.06}$) that issteeper than the canonical kroupa (+1.30) and salpeter (+1.35) values. usingour inference model on select milky way (mw) and lmc high-mass imf studies fromthe literature, we find $\gamma_{\rm mw} \sim+1.15\pm0.1$ and $\gamma_{\rm lmc}\sim+1.3\pm0.1$, both with intrinsic scatter of ~0.3-0.4 dex. thus, while thehigh-mass imf in the local group may be universal, systematics in literatureimf studies preclude any definitive conclusions; homogenous investigations ofthe high-mass imf in the local universe are needed to overcome this limitation.consequently, the present study represents the most robust measurement of thehigh-mass imf slope to date. we have grafted the m31 high-mass imf slope ontowidely used sub-solar mass kroupa and chabrier imfs and show that commonly useduv- and halpha-based star formation rates should be increased by a factor of~1.3-1.5 and the number of stars with masses &gt;8 msun are ~25% fewer thanexpected for a salpeter/kroupa imf.

1503.05195	the star formation histories of local group dwarf galaxies iii.  characterizing quenching in low-mass galaxies	we explore the quenching of low-mass galaxies (10^4 &lt; mstar &lt; 10^8 msun) as afunction of lookback time using the star formation histories (sfhs) of 38 localgroup dwarf galaxies. the sfhs were derived from analyzing color-magnitudediagrams of resolved stellar populations in archival hubble spacetelescope/wide field planetary camera 2 imaging. we find: (1) lower massgalaxies quench earlier than higher mass galaxies; (2) inside of virial radiusthere is no correlation between a satellite's current proximity to a massivehost and its quenching epoch; (3) there are hints of systematic differences inquenching times of m31 and milky way (mw) satellites, although the samplesample size and uncertainties in the sfhs of m31 dwarfs prohibit definitiveconclusions. combined with literature results, we qualitatively consider theredshift evolution (z=0-1) of the quenched galaxy fraction over ~7 dex instellar mass (10^4 &lt; mstar &lt; 10^11.5 msun). the quenched fraction of allgalaxies generally increases toward the present, with both the lowest andhighest mass systems exhibiting the largest quenched fractions at allredshifts. in contrast, galaxies between mstar ~ 10^8-10^10 msun have thelowest quenched fractions. we suggest that such intermediate-mass galaxies arethe least efficient at quenching. finally, we compare our quenching times withpredictions for infall times of low-mass galaxies associated with the mw. wefind that some of the lowest-mass satellites (e.g., cvn ii, leo iv) may havebeen quenched before infall while higher mass satellites (e.g., leo i, fornax)typically quench ~1-4 gyr after infall.

1503.05240	a deep xmm-newton survey of m33: point source catalog, source detection  and characterization of overlapping fields	we have obtained a deep 8-field xmm-newton mosaic of m33 covering the galaxyout to the d$_{25}$ isophote and beyond to a limiting 0.2--4.5 kev unabsorbedflux of 5$\times$10$^{-16}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ (l${&gt;}$4$\times$10$^{34}$erg s$^{-1}$ at the distance of m33). these data allow complete coverage of thegalaxy with high sensitivity to soft sources such as diffuse hot gas andsupernova remnants. here we describe the methods we used to identify andcharacterize 1296 point sources in the 8 fields. we compare our resultingsource catalog to the literature, note variable sources, construct hardnessratios, classify soft sources, analyze the source density profile, and measurethe x-ray luminosity function. as a result of the large effective area ofxmm-newton below 1 kev, the survey contains many new soft x-ray sources. theradial source density profile and x-ray luminosity function for the sourcessuggests that only $\sim$15% of the 391 bright sources withl${&gt;}$3.6$\times$10$^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$ are likely to be associated with m33,and more than a third of these are known supernova remnants. the log(n)--log(s)distribution, when corrected for background contamination, is a relatively flatpower-law with a differential index of 1.5, which suggests many of the otherm33 sources may be high-mass x-ray binaries. finally, we note the discovery ofan interesting new transient x-ray source, which we are unable to classify.

1504.03338	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury xi: the spatially-resolved  recent star formation history of m31	we measure the recent star formation history (sfh) across m31 using opticalimages taken with the \texit{hubble space telescope} as part of thepanchromatic hubble andromeda treasury (phat). we fit the color-magnitudediagrams in ~9000 regions that are ~100 pc $\times$ 100 pc in projected size,covering a 0.5 square degree area (~380 kpc$^2$, deprojected) in the nequadrant of m31. we show that the sfhs vary significantly on these smallspatial scales but that there are also coherent galaxy-wide fluctuations in thesfh back to ~500 myr, most notably in m31's 10-kpc star-forming ring. we findthat the 10-kpc ring is at least 400 myr old, showing ongoing star formationover the past ~500 myr. this indicates the presence of molecular gas in thering over at least 2 dynamical times at this radius. we also find that thering's position is constant throughout this time, and is stationary at thelevel of 1 km/s, although there is evidence for broadening of the ring due todiffusion of stars into the disk. based on existing models of m31's ringfeatures, the lack of evolution in the ring's position makes a purelycollisional ring origin highly unlikely. we find that the global sfr has beenfairly constant over the last ~500 myr, though it does show a small increase at50 myr that is 1.3 times the average sfr over the past 100 myr. during the last~500 myr, ~60% of all sf occurs in the 10-kpc ring. finally, we find that inthe past 100 myr, the average sfr over the phat survey area is $0.28\pm0.03$m$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ with an average deprojected intensity of $7.3 \times10^{-4}$ m$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$, which yields a total sfr of ~0.7m$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ when extrapolated to the entire area of m31's disk. thissfr is consistent with measurements from broadband estimates.

1506.01097	photometric evidence of an intermediate-age stellar population in the  inner bulge of m31	we explore the assembly history of the m31 bulge within a projectedmajor-axis radius of 180" (~680 pc) by studying its stellar populations inhubble space telescope wfc3 and acs observations. colors formed by comparingnear-ultraviolet vs. optical bands are found to become bluer with increasingmajor-axis radius, which is opposite to that predicted if the sole sources ofnear-ultraviolet light were old extreme horizontal branch stars with a negativeradial gradient in metallicity. spectral energy distribution fits require ametal-rich intermediate-age stellar population (300 myr to 1 gyr old, ~solarmetallicity) in addition to the dominant old population. the radial gradientsin age and metallicity of the old stellar population are consistent with thosein previous works. for the intermediate-age population, we find an increase inage with radius and a mass fraction that increases up to 2% at 680 pc away fromthe center. we exclude contamination from the m31 disk and/or halo as the mainorigin for this population. our results thus suggest that intermediate-agestars exist beyond the central 5" (19 pc) of m31 and contribute ~1% of thetotal stellar mass in the bulge. these stars could be related to the seculargrowth of the m31 bulge.

1506.03092	energy-dependent orbital phases in ngc 300 x-1	ngc~300 x-1 is a wolf rayet + black hole binary that exhibits periodicdecreases in x-ray flux. we present two new observations of ngc~300 x-1 fromthe chandra x-ray observatory (totaling $\sim$130 ks) along with acs imagingdata from the hubble space telescope. we observe significant short-termvariability in the x-ray emission that is inconsistent with an occultation bythe donor star, but is consistent with structure in the outer accretion disk orthe wind of the donor star. we simultaneously fit a partially-covered diskblackbody and comptonized corona model to the eclipse egress and non-eclipsingportions of the x-ray spectrum. we find that the only model parameters thatvaried between the eclipse egress and non-eclipsing portions of the spectrawere the partial covering fraction ($\sim$86% during eclipse egress and$\sim$44% during non-eclipse) and absorbing column ($\sim$12.3$\times10^{22}$cm$^{-2}$ during eclipse egress, compared to $\sim$1.4$\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$during non-eclipse). the x-ray spectra are consistent with the movement of thex-ray source through the dense stellar winds of the companion star. from ournew hst imaging, we find the wr star within the x-ray error circle, along withadditional optical sources including an agb star and an early-type mainsequence star. finally, we use our egress measurement to rephase previousradial velocity measurements reported in the literature, and find evidence thatthe velocities are strongly affected by the ionization of the wind by thecompact object. thus, we argue the inferred mass of the black hole may not bereliable.

1507.06687	a spectroscopic and photometric exploration of the c/m ratio in the disk  of m31	we explore the ratio (c/m) of carbon-rich to oxygen-rich thermally pulsingasymptotic giant branch(tp-agb) stars in the disk of m31 using a combination ofmoderate-resolution optical spectroscopy from the spectroscopic landscape ofandromeda's stellar halo (splash) survey and six-filter hubble space telescopephotometry from the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury (phat) survey.carbonstars were identified spectroscopically. oxygen-rich m-stars were identifedusing three different photometric definitions designed to mimic, and thusevaluate, selection techniques common in the literature. we calculate the c/mratio as a function of galactocentric radius, present-day gas-phase oxygenabundance, stellar metallicity, age (via proxy defined as the ratio of tp-agbstars to red giant branch, rgb, stars), and mean star formation rate over thelast 400 myr. we find statistically significant correlations between log(c/m)and all parameters. these trends are consistent across different m-starselection methods, though the fiducial values change. of particular note is ourobserved relationship between log(c/m) and stellar metallicity, which is fullyconsistent with the trend seen across local group satellite galaxies. the factthat this trend persists in stellar populations with very different starformation histories indicates that the c/m ratio is governed by stellarproperties alone.

1509.06988	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury viii: a wide-area,  high-resolution map of dust extinction in m31	we map the distribution of dust in m31 at 25pc resolution, using stellarphotometry from the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury. we develop a newmapping technique that models the nir color-magnitude diagram (cmd) of redgiant branch (rgb) stars. the model cmds combine an unreddened foreground ofrgb stars with a reddened background population viewed through a log-normalcolumn density distribution of dust. fits to the model constrain the medianextinction, the width of the extinction distribution, and the fraction ofreddened stars. the resulting extinction map has &gt;4 times better resolutionthan maps of dust emission, while providing a more direct measurement of thedust column. there is superb morphological agreement between the new map andmaps of the extinction inferred from dust emission by draine et al. 2014.however, the widely-used draine &amp; li (2007) dust models overpredict theobserved extinction by a factor of ~2.5, suggesting that m31's true dust massis lower and that dust grains are significantly more emissive than assumed indraine et al. (2014). the discrepancy we identify is consistent with similarfindings in the milky way by the planck collaboration (2015), but has a morecomplex dependence on parameters from the draine &amp; li (2007) dust models. wealso show that the discrepancy with the draine et al.

1511.00006	panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury xii. mapping stellar metallicity  distributions in m31	we present a study of spatial variations in the metallicity of old red giantbranch stars in the andromeda galaxy. photometric metallicity estimates arederived by interpolating isochrones for over seven million stars in thepanchromatic hubble andromeda treasury (phat) survey. this is the firstsystematic study of stellar metallicities over the inner 20 kpc of andromeda'sgalactic disk. we see a clear metallicity gradient of $-0.020\pm0.004$ dex/kpcfrom $\sim4-20$ kpc assuming a constant rgb age. this metallicity gradient isderived after correcting for the effects of photometric bias and completenessand dust extinction and is quite insensitive to these effects. the unknown agegradient in m31's disk creates the dominant systematic uncertainty in ourderived metallicity gradient. however, spectroscopic analyses of galaxiessimilar to m31 show that they typically have small age gradients that make thissystematic error comparable to the 1$\sigma$ error on our metallicity gradientmeasurement. in addition to the metallicity gradient, we observe an asymmetriclocal enhancement in metallicity at radii of 3-6 kpc that appears to beassociated with andromeda's elongated bar. this same region also appears tohave an enhanced stellar density and velocity dispersion.

astro-ph;0306149	the recent star formation history of the m31 disk	the star formation history of the northern and southern m31 disk is measuredusing samples of bv photometry for 4' x 4' regions taken from the kpno/ctiolocal group survey (massey et al. 2001). the distances, mean reddening values,and age distributions of the stars in these regions were measured using theroutines of dolphin (1997, 2002). independent measurements of overlappingfields show that the results are stable for most samples. a slight distancegradient is seen across the major axis of the southern disk, and a meandistance of 24.47+/-0.03 is found by combining the results. higher meanreddening values follow the spiral structure. the stellar age distributions areconsistent with episodic star formation confined mainly to the gas-rich armregions. if these episodes were caused by propagating density waves, the wavesdid not cause significant star formation episodes in the gas-poor interarmregions. combination of all of the results provides the total star formationrate for 1.4 square degrees of the m31 disk for six epochs. these resultssuggest that star formation in the disk declined by ~50% from ~250 to ~50 myrago. the lowest star formation rate occurred ~25 myr ago followed by a ~20%increase to the present. the mean star formation rate for this large portion ofm31 over the past 60 myr is 0.63+/-0.07 solar masses per year, suggesting atotal mean rate for the disk of ~1 solar masses per year.

astro-ph;0601287	a catalog of transient x-ray sources in m31	from october 1999 to august 2002, 45 transient x-ray sources were detected inm31 by chandra and xmm-newton. we have performed spectral analysis of allxmm-newton and chandra acis detections of these sources, as well as fluxmeasurements of chandra hrc detections. the result is absorption-correctedx-ray lightcurves for these sources covering this 2.8 year period, along withspectral parameters for several epochs of the outbursts of most of thetransient sources. we supply a catalog of the locations, outburst dates, peakobserved luminosities, decay time estimates, and spectral properties of thetransient sources, and we discuss similarities with galactic x-ray novae. dutycycle estimates are possible for 8 of the transients and range from 40% to 2%;upper limits to the duty cycles are estimated for an additional 15 transientsand cover a similar range. we find 5 transients which have rapid decay timesand may be ultra-compact x-ray binaries. spectra of three of the transientssuggest they may be faint galactic foreground sources. if even one is aforeground source, this suggests a surface density of faint transient x-raysources of &gt;~1 deg$^{-2}$.

astro-ph;0609211	virgo's intracluster globular clusters as seen by the advanced camera  for surveys	we report the discovery of 4 candidate intracluster globular clusters (igcs)in a single deep hst acs field of the virgo cluster. we show that each clusteris roughly spherical, has a magnitude near the peak of the virgo globularcluster luminosity function, has a radial profile that is best-fit by a kingmodel, and is surrounded by an excess of point sources which have the colorsand magnitudes of cluster red giant stars. despite the fact that two of our igccandidates have integrated colors redder than the mean of the m87 globularcluster system, we propose that all of the objects are metal-poor with [m/h] &lt;-1. we show that the tidal radii of our intracluster globulars are all largerthan the mean for milky way clusters, and suggest that the clusters haveundergone less tidal stress than their galactic counterparts. finally, wenormalize our globular cluster observations to the luminosity of intraclusterstars, and derive a value of s_n ~ 6 for the specific frequency of virgointracluster globular clusters. we use these data to constrain the origins ofvirgo's intracluster population, and suggest that globular clusters in ourintracluster field have a different origin than globular clusters in thevicinity of m87. in particular, we argue that dwarf elliptical galaxies may bean important source of intracluster stars.

astro-ph;0610386	the metallicity distribution of intracluster stars in virgo	we have used the hubble space telescope's advanced camera for surveys (acs)to detect and measure ~5300 stars in a single intracluster field in the virgocluster. by performing f606w and f814w photometry on these stars, we havedetermined their metallicity distribution function, and constrained the typesof stars present in this portion of virgo's intracluster space. based on thesmall number of stars detected brighter than the red giant branch (rgb) tip, wesuggest that in this region, virgo's intracluster stars are mostly old (&gt;~10gyr). through analysis of the rgb stars themselves, we determine that thepopulation contains the full range of metallicities probed (-2.3&lt;[m/h]&lt;0.0). wealso present evidence that the younger (&lt;10 gyr) component of the population ismore metal-rich, with [m/h]&gt;-0.5. the spatial distribution of the mostmetal-poor stars in the field shows significantly more structure than that ofthe metal-rich stars, indicating that the intracluster population is notwell-mixed. we discuss the implications these observations have for theproduction of intracluster stars and the dynamical evolution of the virgocluster.

astro-ph;0611180	the resolved stellar populations of a dwarf spheroidal galaxy in the  virgo cluster	we report on the discovery of a faint (m_v ~ -10.6 +/- 0.2) dwarf spheroidalgalaxy on deep f606w and f814w hubble space telescope images of a virgointracluster field. the galaxy is easily resolved in our images, as our colormagnitude diagram (cmd) extends &gt; 1 magnitude beyond the tip of the red giantbranch (rgb). thus, it is the deepest cmd for a small dwarf galaxy inside acluster environment. using the colors of the rgb stars, we derive a metalabundance for the dwarf of [m/h]= -2.3 +/- 0.3, and show that the metallicitydispersion is less than 0.6 dex at 95% confidence. we also use the galaxy'slack of agb stars and the absence of objects brighter than m_bol ~ -4.1 +/- 0.2to show that the system is old (t &gt;~10 gyr). finally, we derive the object'sstructural parameters, and show that the galaxy displays no obvious evidence oftidal threshing. since the tip of the red giant branch distance ((m-m)_0 =31.23 +/- 0.17 or d = 17.6 +/- 1.4 mpc) puts the galaxy near the core of thevirgo cluster, one might expect the object to have undergone some tidalprocessing. yet the chemical and morphological similarity between the dwarf andthe dsph galaxies of the local and m81 group demonstrates that the object isindeed pristine, and not the shredded remains of a much larger galaxy. wediscuss the possible origins of this galaxy, and suggest that it is just nowfalling into virgo for the first time.

0810.0266	the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury ii. young stars and their relation  to halpha and uv emission timescales in the m81 outer disk	we have obtained resolved stellar photometry from hubble space telescope(hst) advanced camera for surveys (acs) observations of a field in the outerdisk of m81 as part of the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury (angst). motivatedby the recent discovery of extended uv (xuv) disks around many nearby spiralgalaxies, we use the observed stellar population to derive the recent starformation histories of five ~0.5 kpc-sized regions within this field. theseregions were selected on the basis of their uv luminosity from galex andinclude two hii regions, two regions which are uv-bright but halpha-faint, andone "control" region faint in both uv and halpha. we estimate our effective sfrdetection limit at ~2 x 10^-4 msun/yr, which is lower than that of galex forregions of this size. as expected, the hii regions contain massive mainsequence stars (in the mass range 18-27 msun, based on our best extinctionestimates), while similar massive main sequence stars are lacking in theuv-bright/halpha-faint regions. the observations are consistent with stellarages &lt;10 myr in the hii regions, and &gt;16 myr in the uv-bright/halpha-faintregions. all regions but the control have formed ~10^4 msun of stars over thepast ~65 myr. thus, our results, for at least one small area in the outer diskof m81, are consistent with an age difference being sufficient to explain theobserved discrepancy between star-forming regions detected in halpha and thosedetected exclusively in uv. however, our data cannot conclusively rule outother explanations, such as a strongly truncated initial mass function (imf).

0810.2557	the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury i. the star formation history of  the m81 outer disk	the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury (angst) is a large hubble spacetelescope (hst) advanced camera for surveys (acs) treasury program to obtainresolved stellar photometry for a volume-limited sample of galaxies out to 4mpc. as part of this program, we have obtained deep acs imaging of a field inthe outer disk of the large spiral galaxy m81. the field contains the outskirtsof a spiral arm as well as an area containing no current star formation. ourimaging results in a color-magnitude diagram (cmd) reaching to f814w = 28.8 andf606w = 29.5, one magnitude fainter than the red clump. through detailedmodeling of the full cmd, we quantify the age and metallicity distribution ofthe stellar populations contained in the field. the mean metallicity in thefield is -1&lt;[m/h]&lt;0 and only a small fraction of stars have ages &lt;~1 gyr. theresults show that most of the stars in this outer disk field were formed by z~1and that the arm structure at this radius has a lifetime of &gt;~100 myr. wediscuss the measured evolution of the m81 disk in the context of surveys ofhigh-redshift disk galaxies and deep stellar photometry of other nearbygalaxies. all of these indicate that massive spiral disks are mostly formed byz~1 and that they have experienced rapid metal enrichment.
