0812.3947	mojave: monitoring of jets in agn with vlba experiments. v. multi-epoch  vlba images	we present images from a long term program (mojave: monitoring of jets in agnwith vlba experiments) to survey the structure and evolution of parsec-scalejet phenomena associated with bright radio-loud active galaxies in the northernsky. the observations consist of 2424 15 ghz vlba images of a completeflux-density limited sample of 135 agn above declination -20 degrees, spanningthe period 1994 august to 2007 september. these data were acquired as part ofthe mojave and 2 cm survey programs, and from the vlba archive. the sampleselection criteria are based on multi-epoch parsec-scale (vlba) flux density,and heavily favor highly variable and compact blazars. the sample includesnearly all the most prominent blazars in the northern sky, and is well-suitedfor statistical analysis and comparison with studies at other wavelengths. ourmulti-epoch and stacked-epoch images show 94% of the sample to have apparentone-sided jet morphologies, most likely due to the effects of relativisticbeaming. of the remaining sources, five have two-sided parsec-scale jets, andthree are effectively unresolved by the vlba at 15 ghz, with essentially all ofthe flux density contained within a few tenths of a milliarcsecond.

0902.0810	full polarization spectra of 3c 279	we report the results of parsec-scale, multi-frequency vlba observations ofthe core region of 3c 279 in stokes i, linear polarization, and circularpolarization. these full polarization spectra are modeled by radiative transfersimulations to constrain the magnetic field and particle properties of theparsec-scale jet in 3c 279. the polarization properties of the core region,including the amount of linear polarization, the amount and sign of faradayrotation, and the amount and sign of circular polarization can be explained bya consistent physical picture. the base of the jet is modeled as aninhomogeneous blandford-konigl style conical jet dominated by a vector-orderedpoloidal magnetic field along the jet axis, and we estimate its net magneticflux. this poloidal field is responsible for the linear and circularpolarization from this inhomogeneous component. farther down the jet themagnetic field in two homogeneous features is dominated by local shocks and asmaller fraction of vector-ordered poloidal field remains along the jet axis.in this picture, we find the jet to be kinetically dominated by protons withthe radiating particles being dominated by electrons at an approximate fractionof &gt;~ 75%. based on the amounts of faraday conversion deduced for thehomogeneous components, we find a plausible range for the lower cutoff in therelativistic particle energy spectrum to be 5 &lt;~ gamma_l &lt;~ 35. the physicalpicture described here is not unique if the observed faraday rotation anddepolarization occur in screens external to the jet; however, we find the jointexplanation of linear and circular polarization observations from a single setof magnetic fields and particle properties internal to the jet to be compellingevidence for this picture.

0902.2085	on the relation between agn gamma-ray emission and parsec-scale radio  jets	we have compared the radio emission from a sample of parsec-scale agn jets asmeasured by the vlba at 15 ghz, with their associated gamma-ray properties thatare reported in the fermi lat 3-month bright source list. we find in ourradio-selected sample that the gamma-ray photon flux correlates well with thequasi-simultaneously measured compact radio flux density. the lat-detected jetsin our radio-selected complete sample generally have higher compact radio fluxdensities, and their parsec-scale cores are brighter (i.e., have higherbrightness temperature) than the jets in the lat non-detected objects. thissuggests that the jets of bright gamma-ray agn have preferentially higherdoppler-boosting factors. in addition, agn jets tend to be found in a moreactive radio state within several months from lat-detection of their stronggamma-ray emission. this result becomes more pronounced for confirmed gamma-rayflaring sources. we identify the parsec-scale radio core as a likely locationfor both the gamma-ray and radio flares, which appear within typical timescalesof up to a few months of each other.

0904.1904	fermi discovery of gamma-ray emission from ngc 1275	we report the discovery of high-energy (e&gt;100 mev) gamma-ray emission fromngc 1275, a giant elliptical galaxy lying at the center of the perseus clusterof galaxies, based on observations made with the large area telescope (lat) ofthe fermi gamma ray space telescope. the positional center of the gamma-raysource is only ~3' away from the ngc 1275 nucleus, well within the 95% laterror circle of ~5'.the spatial distribution of gamma-ray photons is consistentwith a point source. the average flux and power-law photon index measured withthe lat from 2008 august 4 to 2008 december 5 are f_gamma = (2.10+-0.23)x10^{-7} ph (&gt;100 mev) cm^{-2} s^{-1} and gamma = 2.17+-0.05, respectively. themeasurements are statistically consistent with constant flux during thefour-month lat observing period.previous egret observations gave an upper limitof f_gamma &lt; 3.72x 10 ^{-8} ph (&gt;100 mev) cm^{-2} s^{-1} to the gamma-ray fluxfrom ngc 1275. this indicates that the source is variable on timescales ofyears to decades, and therefore restricts the fraction of emission that can beproduced in extended regions of the galaxy cluster. contemporaneous andhistorical radio observations are also reported. the broadband spectrum of ngc1275 is modeled with a simple one-zone synchrotron/synchrotron self-comptonmodel and a model with a decelerating jet flow.

0909.3484	agile detection of a rapid gamma-ray flare from the blazar pks 1510-089  during the gasp-webt monitoring	we report the detection by the agile satellite of a rapid gamma-ray flarefrom the powerful gamma-ray quasar pks 1510-089, during a pointing centered onthe galactic center region from 1 march to 30 march 2008. this source has beencontinuosly monitored in the radio-to-optical bands by the glast-agile supportprogram (gasp) of the whole earth blazar telescope (webt). moreover, thegamma-ray flaring episode triggered three too observations by the swiftsatellite in three consecutive days, starting from 20 march 2008. in the period1-16 march 2008, agile detected gamma-ray emission from pks 1510-089 at asignificance level of 6.2-sigma with an average flux over the entire period of(84 +/- 17) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} for photon energies above 100 mev.after a predefined satellite re-pointing, between 17 and 21 march 2008, agiledetected the source at a significance level of 7.3-sigma, with an average flux(e &gt; 100 mev) of (134 +/- 29) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} and a peak levelof (281 +/- 68) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} with daily integration. duringthe observing period january-april 2008, the source also showed an intense andvariable optical activity, with several flaring episodes and a significantincrease of the flux was observed at millimetric frequencies. moreover, in thex-ray band the swift/xrt observations seem to show an harder-when-brighterbehaviour of the source spectrum. the spectral energy distribution of mid-march2008 is modelled with a homogeneous one-zone synchrotron self compton emissionplus contributions from inverse compton scattering of external photons fromboth the accretion disc and the broad line region. indeed, some features in theoptical-uv spectrum seem to indicate the presence of seyfert-like components,such as the little blue bump and the big blue bump.

0910.2607	long-term variability of radio-bright bl lacertae objects	radio-bright bl lacertae objects (blos) are typically variable and exhibitprominent flaring. we use a sample of 24 blos to get a clear idea of theirflaring behavior and to find possible commonalities in their variabilitypatterns. our goal was to compare the results given by computational timescales and the observed variability parameters determined directly from theflux curves. also, we wanted to find out if the blo flares adhere to thegeneralized shock model. we use long-term monitoring data from 4.8, 8, 14.5,22, 37, 90 and 230 ghz. the structure function, discrete correlation functionand lomb-scargle periodogram time scales, calculated in a previous study, areanalyzed in more detail. we determine flare durations, rise and decay times,absolute and relative peak fluxes from the monitoring data. we find that blosdemonstrate a wide range of variability behavior. blos include sources withfast and strong variability, such as oj 287, pks 1749+096 and bl lac, but alsosources with more rolling fluctuations like pks 0735+178. the most extremeflares can last for up to 13 years or have peak fluxes of approximately 12 jyin the observer's frame. when the doppler boosting effect is taken intoaccount, the peak flux of a flare does not depend on the duration of the flare.a rough analysis of the time lags and peak flux evolution indicates that bloflares in the mm - cm wavelengths are high-peaking, i.e., are in the adiabaticstage. thus, the results concur with the generalized shock model.

0708.3219	doppler boosting, superluminal motion, and the kinematics of agn jets	we discuss results from a decade long program to study the fine-scalestructure and the kinematics of relativistic agn jets with the aim of betterunderstanding the acceleration and collimation of the relativistic plasmaforming agn jets. from the observed distribution of brightness temperature,apparent velocity, flux density, time variability, and apparent luminosity, theintrinsic properties of the jets including lorentz factor, luminosity,orientation, and brightness temperature are discussed. special attention isgiven to the jet in m87, which has been studied over a wide range ofwavelengths and which, due to its proximity, is observed with excellent spatialresolution.  most radio jets appear quite linear, but we also observe curved non-linearjets and non-radial motions. sometimes, different features in a given jetappear to follow the same curved path but there is evidence for ballistictrajectories as well. the data are best fit with a distribution of lorentzfactors extending up to gamma ~30 and intrinsic luminosity up to ~10^26 w/hz.in general, gamma-ray quasars may have somewhat larger lorentz factors than nongamma-ray quasars. initially the observed brightness temperature near the baseof the jet extend up to ~5x10^13 k which is well in excess of the inversecompton limit and corresponds to a large excess of particle energy overmagnetic energy. however, more typically, the observed brightness temperaturesare ~2x10^11 k, i.e., closer to equipartition.

1009.2604	another look at the bl lacertae flux and spectral variability	the glast-agile support program (gasp) of the whole earth blazar telescope(webt) monitored bl lacertae in 2008-2009 at radio, near-ir, and opticalfrequencies. during this period, high-energy observations were performed byxmm-newton, swift, and fermi. we analyse these data with particular attentionto the calibration of swift uv data, and apply a helical jet model to interpretthe source broad-band variability. the gasp-webt observations show an opticalflare in 2008 february-march, and oscillations of several tenths of mag on afew-day time scale afterwards. the radio flux is only mildly variable. the uvdata from both xmm-newton and swift seem to confirm a uv excess that is likelycaused by thermal emission from the accretion disc. the x-ray data fromxmm-newton indicate a strongly concave spectrum, as well as moderate fluxvariability on an hour time scale. the swift x-ray data reveal fast (interday)flux changes, not correlated with those observed at lower energies. we comparethe spectral energy distribution (sed) corresponding to the 2008 low-brightnessstate, which was characterised by a synchrotron dominance, to the 1997 outburststate, where the inverse-compton emission was prevailing. a fit with aninhomogeneous helical jet model suggests that two synchrotron components are atwork with their self inverse-compton emission. most likely, they represent theradiation from two distinct emitting regions in the jet. we show that thedifference between the source seds in 2008 and 1997 can be explained in termsof pure geometrical variations. the outburst state occurred when thejet-emitting regions were better aligned with the line of sight, producing anincrease of the doppler beaming factor. our analysis demonstrates that the jetgeometry can play an extremely important role in the bl lacertae flux andspectral variability.

1101.2047	planck early results. xv. spectral energy distributions and radio  continuum spectra of northern extragalactic radio sources	spectral energy distributions (seds) and radio continuum spectra arepresented for a northern sample of 104 extragalactic radio sources, based onthe planck early release compact source catalogue (ercsc) and simultaneousmultifrequency data. the nine planck frequencies, from 30 to 857 ghz, arecomplemented by a set of simultaneous observations ranging from radio togamma-rays. this is the first extensive frequency coverage in the radio andmillimetre domains for an essentially complete sample of extragalactic radiosources, and it shows how the individual shocks, each in their own phase ofdevelopment, shape the radio spectra as they move in the relativistic jet. theseds presented in this paper were fitted with second and third degreepolynomials to estimate the frequencies of the synchrotron and inverse compton(ic) peaks, and the spectral indices of low and high frequency radio data,including the planck ercsc data, were calculated. sed modelling methods arediscussed, with an emphasis on proper, physical modelling of the synchrotronbump using multiplecomponents. planck ercsc data also suggest that the originalaccelerated electron energy spectrum could be much harder than commonlythought, with power-law index around 1.5 instead of the canonical 2.5. theimplications of this are discussed for the acceleration mechanisms effective inblazar shock. furthermore in many cases the planck data indicate that gamma-rayemission must originate in the same shocks that produce the radio emission.

1108.1114	simultaneous planck, swift, and fermi observations of x-ray and  gamma-ray selected blazars	we present simultaneous planck, swift, fermi, and ground-based data for 105blazars belonging to three samples with flux limits in the soft x-ray, hardx-ray, and gamma-ray bands. our unique data set has allowed us to demonstratethat the selection method strongly influences the results, producing biasesthat cannot be ignored. almost all the bl lac objects have been detected byfermi-lat, whereas ~40% of the flat-spectrum radio quasars (fsrqs) in theradio, soft x-ray, and hard x-ray selected samples are still below thegamma-ray detection limit even after integrating 27 months of fermi-lat data.the radio to sub-mm spectral slope of blazars is quite flat up to ~70ghz, abovewhich it steepens to &lt;\alpha&gt;~-0.65. bl lacs have significantly flatter spectrathan fsrqs at higher frequencies. the distribution of the rest-framesynchrotron peak frequency (\nups) in the sed of fsrqs is the same in all theblazar samples with &lt;\nups&gt;=10^13.1 hz, while the mean inverse-compton peakfrequency, &lt;\nupic&gt;, ranges from 10^21 to 10^22 hz. the distributions of \nupsand of \nupic of bl lacs are much broader and are shifted to higher energiesthan those of fsrqs and strongly depend on the selection method. the comptondominance of blazars ranges from ~0.2 to ~100, with only fsrqs reaching values&gt;3. its distribution is broad and depends strongly on the selection method,with gamma-ray selected blazars peaking at ~7 or more, and radio-selectedblazars at values ~1, thus implying that the assumption that the blazar poweris dominated by high-energy emission is a selection effect. simple ssc modelscannot explain the seds of most of the gamma-ray detected blazars in allsamples. the sed of the blazars that were not detected by fermi-lat may insteadbe consistent with ssc emission. our data challenge the correlation betweenbolometric luminosity and \nups predicted by the blazar sequence.

1205.0490	faraday rotation in the mojave blazars: connection with gamma-ray  studies	we have conducted a survey of faraday rotation in a sample of 191 compactradio-loud agns as part of the mojave (monitoring of jets in active galacticnuclei with vlba experiments) project. the observations were carried out withthe vlba at 8.1, 8.4, 12.1 and 15.3 ghz over 12 epochs in 2006. we detectsufficiently strong linear polarization in 159 out of 211 observations tocalculate the rotation measure values, resulting in a large enough sample forstatistical analysis of the faraday rotation in blazars. these faraday rotationmeasures can be used to study the intrinsic magnetic field order andorientation in parsec-scale blazar jets. our sample includes 119 sources listedin the 1fgl or 2fgl catalogs and we detect rotation measure values in 111 outof 131 maps. of the 72 sources that are not in the gamma-ray catalogs we detectrm in 48 out of 80 maps. the median rm values of the lat-detected sources donot differ significantly from the non-lat-detected sources. nine of the sourcesin our sample have resolved enough jets to study the transverse faradayrotation structure, and we detect significant transverse rotation measuregradients in four sources. in two of these (3c~273 and 3c~454.3) there isadditional evidence to support helical magnetic field in the parsec-scale jets.the two others (0923+392 and 2230+114) require further observations to identifythe nature of the gradient. it is interesting that three of the four sourceswith significant rotation measure gradients are sources that have shown largegamma-ray flares.

1205.6746	mojave: monitoring of jets in active galactic nuclei with vlba  experiments. viii. faraday rotation in parsec-scale agn jets	we report observations of faraday rotation measures (rms) for a sample of 191extragalactic radio jets observed within the mojave program. multifrequencyvlba observations were carried out over twelve epochs in 2006 at fourfrequencies between 8 and 15 ghz. we detect parsec-scale faraday rms in 149sources and find the quasars to have larger rms on average than bl lac objects.the median core rms are significantly higher than in the jet components. thisis especially true for quasars where we detect a significant negativecorrelation between the magnitude of the rm and the de-projected distance fromthe core. we perform detailed simulations of the observational errors of totalintensity, polarization and faraday rotation, and concentrate on the errors oftransverse faraday rm gradients in unresolved jets. our simulations show thatthe finite image restoring beam size has a significant effect on the observedrm gradients, and spurious gradients can occur due to noise in the data if thejet is less than two beams wide in polarization. we detect significanttransverse rm gradients in four sources (0923+392, 1226+023, 2230+114 and2251+158). in 1226+023 the rm is for the first time seen to change sign frompositive to negative over the transverse cuts, which supports the presence of ahelical magnetic field in the jet. in this source we also detect variations inthe jet rm over a time scale of three months, which are difficult to explainwith external faraday screens and suggest internal faraday rotation. bycomparing fractional polarization changes in jet components between the fourfrequency bands to depolarization models we find that an external purely randomfaraday screen viewed through only a few lines of sight can explain most of ourpolarization observations but in some sources, such as 1226+023 and 2251+158,internal faraday rotation is needed.

1206.0745	the structure and emission model of the relativistic jet in the quasar  3c 279 inferred from radio to high-energy gamma-ray observations in 2008-2010	we present time-resolved broad-band observations of the quasar 3c 279obtained from multi-wavelength campaigns conducted during the first two yearsof the fermi gamma-ray space telescope mission. while investigating thepreviously reported gamma-ray/optical flare accompanied by a change in opticalpolarization, we found that the optical emission appears delayed with respectto the gamma-ray emission by about 10 days. x-ray observations reveal a pair of`isolated' flares separated by ~90 days, with only weak gamma-ray/opticalcounterparts. the spectral structure measured by spitzer reveals a synchrotroncomponent peaking in the mid-infrared band with a sharp break at thefar-infrared band during the gamma-ray flare, while the peak appears in themm/sub-mm band in the low state. selected spectral energy distributions arefitted with leptonic models including comptonization of external radiationproduced in a dusty torus or the broad-line region. adopting the interpretationof the polarization swing involving propagation of the emitting region along acurved trajectory, we can explain the evolution of the broad-band spectraduring the gamma-ray flaring event by a shift of its location from ~ 1 pc to ~4 pc from the central black hole. on the other hand, if the gamma-ray flare isgenerated instead at sub-pc distance from the central black hole, thefar-infrared break can be explained by synchrotron self-absorption. we alsomodel the low spectral state, dominated by the mm/sub-mm peaking synchrotroncomponent, and suggest that the corresponding inverse-compton componentexplains the steady x-ray emission.

1207.2932	multi-wavelength observations of blazar ao 0235+164 in the 2008-2009  flaring state	the blazar ao 0235+164 (z = 0.94) has been one of the most active objectsobserved by fermi large area telescope (lat) since its launch in summer 2008.in addition to the continuous coverage by fermi, contemporaneous observationswere carried out from the radio to {\gamma} -ray bands between 2008 septemberand 2009 february. in this paper, we summarize the rich multi-wavelength datacollected during the campaign (including f-gamma, gasp- webt, kanata, ovro,rxte, smarts, swift, and other instruments), examine the cross-correlationbetween the light curves measured in the different energy bands, and interpretthe resulting spectral energy distributions in the context of well-known blazaremission models. we find that the {\gamma} -ray activity is well correlatedwith a series of near-ir/optical flares, accompanied by an increase in theoptical polarization degree. on the other hand, the x-ray light curve shows adistinct 20 day high state of unusually soft spectrum, which does not match theextrapolation of the optical/uv synchrotron spectrum. we tentatively interpretthis feature as the bulk compton emission by cold electrons contained in thejet, which requires an accretion disk corona with an effective covering factorof 19% at a distance of 100 rg . we model the broadband spectra with a leptonicmodel with external radiation dominated by the infrared emission from the dustytorus.

1207.3979	variability of the blazar 4c 38.41 (b3 1633+382) from ghz frequencies to  gev energies	the quasar-type blazar 4c 38.41 (b3 1633+382) experienced a large outburst in2011, which was detected throughout the entire electromagnetic spectrum. wepresent the results of low-energy multifrequency monitoring by the gasp projectof the webt consortium and collaborators, as well as those ofspectropolarimetric/spectrophotometric monitoring at the steward observatory.we also analyse high-energy observations of the swift and fermi satellites. inthe optical-uv band, several results indicate that there is a contribution froma qso-like emission component, in addition to both variable and polarised jetemission. the unpolarised emission component is likely thermal radiation fromthe accretion disc that dilutes the jet polarisation. we estimate itsbrightness to be r(qso) ~ 17.85 - 18 and derive the intrinsic jet polarisationdegree. we find no clear correlation between the optical and radio lightcurves, while the correlation between the optical and \gamma-ray fluxapparently fades in time, likely because of an increasing optical to \gamma-rayflux ratio. as suggested for other blazars, the long-term variability of 4c38.41 can be interpreted in terms of an inhomogeneous bent jet, where differentemitting regions can change their alignment with respect to the line of sight,leading to variations in the doppler factor \delta. under the hypothesis thatin the period 2008-2011 all the \gamma-ray and optical variability on aone-week timescale were due to changes in \delta, this would range between ~ 7and ~ 21. if the variability were caused by changes in the viewing angle\theta\ only, then \theta\ would go from ~ 2.6 degr to ~ 5 degr. variations inthe viewing angle would also account for the dependence of the polarisationdegree on the source brightness in the framework of a shock-in-jet model.

1301.7087	radio to gamma-ray variability study of blazar s5 0716+714	we present the results of a series of radio, optical, x-ray and gamma-rayobservations of the bl lac object s50716+714 carried out between april 2007 andjanuary 2011. the multi-frequency observations were obtained using severalground and space based facilities. the intense optical monitoring of the sourcereveals faster repetitive variations superimposed on a long-term variabilitytrend at a time scale of ~350 days. episodes of fast variability recur on timescales of ~ 60-70 days. the intense and simultaneous activity at optical andgamma-ray frequencies favors the ssc mechanism for the production of thehigh-energy emission. two major low-peaking radio flares were observed duringthis high optical/gamma-ray activity period. the radio flares are characterizedby a rising and a decaying stage and are in agreement with the formation of ashock and its evolution. we found that the evolution of the radio flaresrequires a geometrical variation in addition to intrinsic variations of thesource. different estimates yield a robust and self-consistent lower limits of\delta &gt; 20 and equipartition magnetic field b_eq &gt; 0.36 g. causality argumentsconstrain the size of emission region \theta &lt; 0.004 mas. we found asignificant correlation between flux variations at radio frequencies with thoseat optical and gamma-rays. the optical/gev flux variations lead the radiovariability by ~65 days. the longer time delays between low-peaking radiooutbursts and optical flares imply that optical flares are the precursors ofradio ones. an orphan x-ray flare challenges the simple, one-zone emissionmodels, rendering them too simple. here we also describe the spectral energydistribution modeling of the source from simultaneous data taken throughdifferent activity periods.

0801.0617	the trails of superluminal jet components in 3c111	in 1996, a major radio flux-density outburst occured in the broad-line radiogalaxy 3c111. it was followed by a particularly bright plasma ejectionassociated with a superluminal jet component, which has shaped the parsec-scalestructure of 3c111 for almost a decade. here, we present results from 18 epochsof very long baseline array (vlba) observations conducted since 1995 as part ofthe vlba 2 cm survey and mojave monitoring programs. this major event allows usto study a variety of processes associated with outbursts of radio-loud agn inmuch greater detail than has been possible in other cases: the primaryperturbation gives rise to the formation of a leading and a followingcomponent, which are interpreted as a forward and a backward-shock. bothcomponents evolve in characteristically different ways and allow us to drawconclusions about the work flow of jet-production events; the expansion,acceleration and recollimation of the ejected jet plasma in an environment withsteep pressure and density gradients are revealed; trailing components areformed in the wake of the primary perturbation possibly as a result of couplingto kelvin-helmholtz instability pinching modes from the interaction of the jetwith the external medium. the interaction of the jet with its ambient medium isfurther described by the linear-polarization signature of jet componentstraveling along the jet and passing a region of steep pressure/densitygradients.

1305.6005	vlba observations of a rare multiple quasar imaging event caused by  refraction in the interstellar medium	we report on the first detection of the theoretically-predicted rarephenomenon of multiple parsec-scale imaging of an active galactic nucleusinduced by refractive effects due to localized foreground electron densityenhancements, e.g., in an au-scale plasma lens(es) in the ionized component ofthe galactic interstellar medium. we detected multiple imaging in the lowgalactic latitude (b=-2 deg) quasar 2023+335 from the 15.4 ghz mojaveobservations when the source was undergoing an ese. while the parsec-scale jetof the source normally extends along pa -20 deg, in the 28 may 2009 and 23 july2009 images a highly significant multi-component pattern of secondary images isstretched out nearly along the constant galactic latitude line with a local pa40 deg, indicating that the direction of relative motion of the plasma lens isclose to orbital. weaker but still detectable imaging patterns at similarposition angles are sporadically manifest at several other epochs. modeling theese that occurred in early 2009 and lasted ~0.14 yr, we determined that theforeground screen has a double-lens structure, with proper motion (~6.8mas/yr), and angular size (~0.27 mas). we also found that the angularseparation between the two brightest sub-images roughly follows awavelength-squared dependence expected from plasma scattering. furthermore, byanalyzing archival non-simultaneous vlba observations covering a wide frequencyrange from 1.4 to 86 ghz, we found that the scattered angular size of the vlbicore follows a $\nu^{-1.89}$ dependence, implying the presence of a turbulent,refractive dominated scattering screen that has a confined structure or istruncated transverse to the line of sight toward 2023+335.

1404.0014	mojave: monitoring of jets in active galactic nuclei with vlba  experiments. xi. spectral distributions	we have obtained milliarcsecond-scale spectral index distributions for asample of 190 extragalactic radio jets through the mojave project. the sourceswere observed in 2006 at 8.1, 8.4, 12.1, and 15.4 ghz, and we study thefour-frequency spectrum in individual jet features. we performed detailedsimulations to study the effects of image alignment and (u,v)-plane coverage onthe spectral index maps to verify our results. the core spectral indices are onaverage flat, while the jet spectrum is in general steep with a mean index of-1.04. a simple power-law fit is often inadequate for the core regions, asexpected if the cores are partially self-absorbed. the overall jet spectrumsteepens at a rate of about -0.001 to -0.004 per deprojected parsec when movingfurther out from the core with flat spectrum radio quasars having significantlysteeper spectra than the bl lac objects. the spectrum in both types of objectsflattens at the locations of the jet components indicating particleacceleration or density enhancements along the jet. the mean spectral index atthe component locations of -0.81 corresponds to a power-law index of ~2.6 forthe electron energy distribution. we find a significant trend that jetcomponents with linear polarization parallel to the jet (magnetic fieldperpendicular to the jet) have flatter spectra, as expected for transverseshocks. compared to quasars, bl lacs have more jet components withperpendicular magnetic field alignment, which may explain their generallyflatter spectra. the overall steepening of the spectra with distance can beexplained with radiative losses if the jets are collimating or with theevolution of the high-energy cutoff in the electron spectrum if the jets areconical. this interpretation is supported by a significant correlation with theage of the component and the spectral index, with older components havingsteeper spectra.

1410.6391	multiwavelength observations of mrk 501 in 2008	mrk 501 is one of the brightest blazars at tev energies and has beenextensively studied since its first vhe detection in 1996. our goal is tocharacterize in detail the source gamma-ray emission, together with theradio-to-x-ray emission, during the non-flaring (low) activity, which is lessoften studied than the occasional flaring (high) activity. we organized amultiwavelength (mw) campaign on mrk 501 between march and may 2008. thismulti-instrument effort included the most sensitive vhe gamma-ray instrumentsin the northern hemisphere, namely the imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopesmagic and veritas, as well as swift, rxte, the f-gamma, gasp-webt, and othercollaborations and instruments. mrk 501 was found to be in a low state ofactivity during the campaign, with a vhe flux in the range of 10%-20% of thecrab nebula flux. nevertheless, significant flux variations were detected withvarious instruments, with a trend of increasing variability with energy. thebroadband spectral energy distribution during the two different emission statesof the campaign can be adequately described within the homogeneous one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model, with the (slightly) higher state described byan increase in the electron number density. this agrees with previous studiesof the broadband emission of this source during flaring and non-flaring states.we report for the first time a tentative x-ray-to-vhe correlation during a lowvhe activity. although marginally significant, this positive correlationbetween x-ray and vhe, which has been reported many times during flaringactivity, suggests that the mechanisms that dominate the x-ray/vhe emissionduring non-flaring-activity are not substantially different from those that areresponsible for the emission during flaring activity.

1412.3576	unprecedented study of the broadband emission of mrk 421 during flaring  activity in march 2010	a flare from the tev blazar mrk 421, occurring in march 2010, was observedfor 13 consecutive days from radio to very high energy (vhe, e &gt; 100 gev)gamma-rays with magic, veritas, whipple, fermilat, maxi, rxte, swift,gasp-webt, and several optical and radio telescopes. we model the day-scaleseds with one-zone and two-zone synchrotron self-compton (ssc) models,investigate the physical parameters, and evaluate whether the observedbroadband sed variability can be associated to variations in the relativisticparticle population.  flux variability was remarkable in the x-ray and vhe bands while it was minoror not significant in the other bands. the one-zone ssc model can describereasonably well the sed of each day for the 13 consecutive days. this flaringactivity is also very well described by a two-zone ssc model, where one zone isresponsible for the quiescent emission while the other smaller zone, which isspatially separated from the first one, contributes to the daily-variableemission occurring in x-rays and vhe gamma-rays.  both the one-zone ssc and the two-zone ssc models can describe the daily sedsvia the variation of only four or five model parameters, under the hypothesisthat the variability is associated mostly to the underlying particlepopulation. this shows that the particle acceleration and cooling mechanismproducing the radiating particles could be the main one responsible for thebroadband sed variations during the flaring episodes in blazars. the two-zonessc model provides a better agreement to the observed sed at the narrow peaksof the low- and high-energy bumps during the highest activity, although thereported one-zone ssc model could be further improved by the variation of theparameters related to the emitting region itself ($\delta$, $b$ and $r$), inaddition to the parameters related to the particle population.

1502.02650	the 2009 multiwavelength campaign on mrk 421: variability and  correlation studies	we performed a 4.5-month multi-instrument campaign (from radio to vhe gammarays) on mrk421 between january 2009 and june 2009, which included vlba,f-gamma, gasp-webt, swift, rxte, fermi-lat, magic, and whipple, among otherinstruments and collaborations. mrk421 was found in its typical (non-flaring)activity state, with a vhe flux of about half that of the crab nebula, yet thelight curves show significant variability at all wavelengths, the highestvariability being in the x-rays. we determined the power spectral densities(psd) at most wavelengths and found that all psds can be described bypower-laws without a break, and with indices consistent with pink/red-noisebehavior. we observed a harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra andmeasured a positive correlation between vhe and x-ray fluxes with zero timelag. such characteristics have been reported many times during flaringactivity, but here they are reported for the first time in the non-flaringstate. we also observed an overall anti-correlation between optical/uv andx-rays extending over the duration of the campaign.  the harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra and the measuredpositive x-ray/vhe correlation during the 2009 multi-wavelength campaignsuggests that the physical processes dominating the emission during non-flaringstates have similarities with those occurring during flaring activity. inparticular, this observation supports leptonic scenarios as being responsiblefor the emission of mrk421 during non-flaring activity. such a temporallyextended x-ray/vhe correlation is not driven by any single flaring event, andhence is difficult to explain within the standard hadronic scenarios. thehighest variability is observed in the x-ray band, which, within the one-zonesynchrotron self-compton scenario, indicates that the electron energydistribution is most variable at the highest energies.

0805.1283	long-term radio variability of agn: flare characteristics	we have studied the flare characteristics of 55 agn at 8 different frequencybands between 4.8 and 230 ghz. our extensive database enables us to study thevarious observational properties of flares in these sources and compare ourresults with theoretical models. we visually extracted 159 individual flaresfrom the flux density curves and calculated different parameters, such as thepeak flux density and duration, in all the frequency bands. the selection offlares is based on the 22 and 37 ghz data from mets\"ahovi radio observatoryand 90 and 230 ghz data from the sest telescope. additional lower frequency4.8, 8, and 14.5 ghz data are from the university of michigan radioobservatory. we also calculated variability indices and compared them withearlier studies. the observations seem to adhere well to the shock model, butthere is still large scatter in the data. especially the time delays betweendifferent frequency bands are difficult to study due to the incomplete samplingof the higher frequencies. the average duration of the flares is 2.5 years at22 and 37 ghz, which shows that long-term monitoring is essential forunderstanding the typical behaviour in these sources. it also seems that theenergy release in a flare is independent of the duration of the flare.

1506.07137	frequency dependent core shifts and parameter estimation for the blazar  3c 454.3	we study the core shift effect in the parsec scale jet of the blazar 3c 454.3using the 4.8 ghz - 36.8 ghz radio light curves obtained from three decades ofcontinuous monitoring. from a piecewise gaussian fit to each flare, time lags$\delta t$ between the observation frequencies $\nu$ and spectral indices$\alpha$ based on peak amplitudes $a$ are determined. from the fit $\delta t\propto \nu^{1/k_r}$, $k_r = 1.10 \pm 0.18$ indicating equipartition betweenthe magnetic field energy density and the particle energy density. from the fit$a \propto \nu^\alpha$, $\alpha$ is in the range $-0.24$ to $1.52$. a meanmagnetic field strength at 1 pc, $b_1 = 0.5 \pm 0.2$ g, and at the core,$b_{\rm core} = 46 \pm 16$ mg, are inferred, consistent with previousestimates. the measure of core position offset is $\omega_{r\nu} = 6.4 \pm 2.8$pc ghz$^{1/k_r}$ when averaged over all frequency pairs. based on thestatistical trend shown by the measured core radius $r_{\rm core}$ as afunction of $\nu$, we infer that the synchrotron opacity model may not be validfor all cases. a fourier periodogram analysis yields power law slopes in therange $-1.6$ to $-3.5$ describing the power spectral density shape and givesbend timescales in the range $0.52 - 0.66~$yr. this result, and both positiveand negative $\alpha$, indicate that the flares originate from multiple shocksin a small region. important objectives met in our study include: thedemonstration of the computational efficiency and statistical basis of thepiecewise gaussian fit; consistency with previously reported results; evidencefor the core shift dependence on observation frequency and its utility in jetdiagnostics in the region close to the resolving limit of very long baselineinterferometry observations.

1507.03022	high radio frequency properties and variability of brightest cluster  galaxies	we consider the high radio frequency (15 ghz - 353 ghz) properties andvariability of 35 brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs). these are the mostcore-dominated sources drawn from a parent sample of more than 700 x-rayselected clusters, thus allowing us to relate our results to the generalpopulation. we find that &gt;6.0% of our parent sample (&gt;15.1% if only cool-coreclusters are considered) contain a radio-source at 150 ghz of at least 3mjy(~1x10^23 w/hz at our median redshift of z~0.13). furthermore, &gt;3.4% of thebcgs in our parent sample contain a peaked component (gigahertz peakedspectrum, gps) in their spectra that peaks above 2 ghz, increasing to &gt;8.5% ifonly cool-core clusters are considered. we see little evidence for strongvariability at 15 ghz on short (week-month) time-scales although we seevariations greater than 20% at 150 ghz over 6-month times-frames for 4 of the23 sources with multi-epoch observations. much more prevalent is long-term(year-decade time-scale) variability, with average annual amplitude variationsgreater than 1% at 15 ghz being commonplace. there is a weak trend towardshigher variability as the peak of the gps-like component occurs at higherfrequency. we demonstrate the complexity that is seen in the radio spectra ofbcgs and discuss the potentially significant implications of these high-peakingcomponents for sunyaev-zel'dovich cluster searches.

0805.3411	the multiwavelength variability of 3c 273	we present an update of 3c 273's database hosted by the isdc, completed withdata from radio to gamma-ray observations over the last 10 years. we use thislarge data set to study the multiwavelength properties of thisquasar,especially focussing on its variability behaviour. we study theamplitude of the variations and the maximum variability time scales across thebroad-band spectrum and correlate the light curves in different bands,specifically with the x-rays, to search for possible connections between theemission at different energies. 3c 273 shows variability at all frequencies,with amplitudes and time scales strongly depending on the energy and being thesignatures of the different emission mechanisms. the variability properties ofthe x-ray band imply the presence of either two separate components (possibly aseyfert-like and a blazar-like) or at least two parameters with distinct timingproperties to account for the x-ray emission below and above ~20 kev. thedominant hard x-ray emission is most probably not due to electrons acceleratedby the shock waves in the jet as their variability does not correlate with theflaring millimeter emission, but seems to be associated to long-timescalevariations in the optical. this optical component is consistent with beingoptically thin synchrotron radiation from the base of the jet and the hardx-rays would be produced through inverse compton processes (ssc and/or ec) bythe same electron population. we show evidence that this synchrotron componentextends from the optical to the near-infrared domain, where it is blended byemission of heated dust that we find to be located within about 1 light-yearfrom the ultraviolet source.

1508.00959	optical and radio variability of bl lacertae	we observed the prototype blazar, bl lacertae, extensively in optical andradio bands during an active phase in the period 2010--2013 when the sourceshowed several prominent outbursts. we searched for possible correlations andtime lags between the optical and radio band flux variations usingmultifrequency data to learn about the mechanisms producing variability. duringan active phase of bl lacertae, we searched for possible correlations and timelags between multifrequency light curves of several optical and radio bands. wetried to estimate any possible variability timescales and inter-band lags inthese bands. we performed optical observations in b, v, r and i bands fromseven telescopes in bulgaria, georgia, greece and india and obtained radio dataat 36.8, 22.2, 14.5, 8 and 4.8 ghz frequencies from three telescopes inukraine, finland and usa. significant cross-correlations between optical andradio bands are found in our observations with a delay of cm-fluxes withrespect to optical ones of ~250 days. the optical and radio light curves do notshow any significant timescales of variability. bl lacertae showed many optical'mini-flares' on short time-scales. variations on longer term timescales aremildly chromatic with superposition of many strong optical outbursts. in radiobands, the amplitude of variability is frequency dependent. flux variations athigher radio frequencies lead the lower frequencies by days or weeks.  the optical variations are consistent with being dominated by a geometricscenario where a region of emitting plasma moves along a helical path in arelativistic jet. the frequency dependence of the variability amplitudesupports an origin of the observed variations intrinsic to the source.

0705.3293	statistical analyses of long-term variability of agn at high radio  frequencies	we present a study of variability time scales in a large sample of activegalactic nuclei at several frequencies between 4.8 and 230 ghz. we investigatethe differences of various agn types and frequencies and correlate the measuredtime scales with physical parameters such as the luminosity and the lorentzfactor. our sample consists of both high and low polarization quasars, bllacertae objects and radio galaxies. the basis of this work is the 22 ghz, 37ghz and 87 ghz monitoring data from the metsahovi radio observatory spanningover 25 years. in addition,we used higher 90 ghz and 230 ghz frequency dataobtained with the sest-telescope between 1987 and 2003. further lower frequencydata at 4.8 ghz, 8 ghz and 14.5 ghz from the university of michigan monitoringprogramme have been used. we have applied three different statistical methodsto study the time scales: the structure function, the discrete correlationfunction and the lomb-scargle periodogram. we discuss also the differences andrelative merits of these three methods. our study reveals that smaller fluxdensity variations occur in these sources on short time scales of 1-2 years,but larger outbursts happen quite rarely, on the average only once in every 6years. we do not find any significant differences in the time scales betweenthe source classes. the time scales are also only weakly related to theluminosity suggesting that the shock formation is caused by jet instabilitiesrather than the central black hole.

astro-ph;0203379	broadband spectra and variability of bl lacertae in 2000	we have organized an extensive multiwavelength campaign on bl lacertae in thesecond half of 2000. simultaneous or quasi-simultaneous observations were takenat radio frequencies, in the optical - carried out by the webt collaboration -,in x-rays - using bepposax and rxte -, and at vhe gamma-rays with the cat andhegra cherenkov telescope facilities. in this paper, we are presenting firstresults from this campaign. the webt optical campaign achieved an unprecedentedtime coverage, virtually continuous over several 10 - 20 hour segments, andrevealed intraday variability on time scales of ~ 1.5 hours. the x-rayobservations of nov. 1 - 2, 2000, revealed significant variability on similartime scales, and provided evidence for the synchrotron spectrum extending outto ~ 10 kev during that time. at higher energies, the onset of the hardpower-law commonly observed in radio-loud quasars and radio-selected bl lacobjects is seen. from the energy-resolved x-ray variability patterns, we findevidence that electron cooling might not be dominated by one single radiationmechanism; rather, a combination of synchrotron and compton cooling seems to berequired.

0808.2194	correlated multi-waveband variability in the blazar 3c~279 from 1996 to  2007	we present the results of extensive multi-waveband monitoring of the blazar3c~279 between 1996 and 2007 at x-ray energies (2-10 kev), optical r band, and14.5 ghz, as well as imaging with the very long baseline array (vlba) at 43ghz. in all bands the power spectral density corresponds to "red noise" thatcan be fit by a single power law over the sampled time scales. variations influx at all three wavebands are significantly correlated. the time delaybetween high and low frequency bands changes substantially on time scales ofyears. a major multi-frequency flare in 2001 coincided with a swing of the jettoward a more southerly direction, and in general the x-ray flux is modulatedby changes in the position angle of the jet near the core. the flux density inthe core at 43 ghz--increases in which indicate the appearance of newsuperluminal knots--is significantly correlated with the x-ray flux.  we decompose the x-ray and optical light curves into individual flares,finding that x-ray leads optical variations (xo) in 6 flares, the reverseoccurs in 3 flares (ox), and there is essentially zero lag in 4 flares. uponcomparing theoretical expectations with the data, we conclude that (1) xoflares can be explained by gradual acceleration of radiating electrons to thehighest energies; (2) ox flares can result from either light-travel delays ofthe seed photons (synchrotron self-compton scattering) or gradients in maximumelectron energy behind shock fronts; and (3) events with similar x-ray andoptical radiative energy output originate well upstream of the 43 ghz core,while those in which the optical radiative output dominates occur at ordownstream of the core.

astro-ph;0210636	oblique polarization structures in agn and qso radio jets	we interpret the linear polarization structures observed in extragalacticradio sources, even those oriented at oblique angles to the jet flows, to bedue to oblique, relativistic shock fronts in the emitting regions. many sourcesexhibit indications of such oblique structures, and the goal of thisinvestigation is to test this hypothesis quantitatively. a selected group often highly-variable extragalactic sources were observed with the vlba at 15 and43 ghz, on nine epochs spanning a 30-month period; five of these objects werealso observed at 8.0 and 22 ghz. the integrated total flux densities and linearpolarizations of the selected objects were also observed several times a monthat 4.8, 8.0 and 14.5 ghz with the university of michigan 26-meter telescope.all objects exhibited variability with several exhibiting more than oneindependent outburst during the period. we show the evolution of the polarizedcomponents with time and discuss the relativistic shock parameters required tomatch the observed polarization structures. even cases where the magnetic fieldis apparently oriented along the jet flow can be fit by oblique shock modelswhen relativistic aberration effects are included.
