0901.2347	the xmm-newton wide-field survey in the cosmos field. the point-like  x-ray source catalogue	the cosmos survey is a multiwavelength survey aimed to study the evolution ofgalaxies, agn and the large scale structure. the xmm-cosmos is a deep x-raysurvey over the full 2 deg2 of the cosmos area. it consists of 55 xmm-newtonpointings for a total exposure of ~1.5 ms with an average vignetting correcteddepth of 40 ks across the field of view and a sky coverage of 2.13 deg2. wepresent the catalogue of point-like x-ray sources detected with the epic ccdcameras, the logn-logs relations and the x-ray colour-colour diagrams. theanalysis was performed in the 0.5-2 kev, 2-10 kev and 5-10 kev energy bands.the completeness of the catalogue as well as logn-logs have been calibratedusing monte carlo simulations. the catalogs contains a total of 1887 uniquesources detected in at least one band. the survey, that shows unprecedentedhomogeneity, has a flux limit of ~1.7x10-15 erg cm-2 s-1, ~9.3x10-15 erg cm-2s-1 and ~1.3x10-14 erg cm-2 s-1 over 90% of the area (1.92 deg2) in the 0.5-2kev, 2-10 kev and 5-10 kev energy band, respectively. thanks to the ratherhomogeneous exposure over a large area, the derived logn-logs relations arevery well determined over the flux range sampled by xmm-cosmos. these relationshave been compared with xrb synthesis models, which reproduce the observationswith an agreement of ~10% in the 5-10 kev and 2-10 kev band, while in the 0.5-2kev band the agreement is of the order of ~20%. the hard x-ray colors confirmedthat the majority of the extragalactic sources, in a bright subsample, areactually type i or type ii agn. about 20% of the sources have x-ray luminositytypical of agn (l_x &gt;1042 erg/s) although they do not show any clear signatureof nuclear activity in the optical spectrum.

0903.2062	the chandra cosmos survey, i: overview and point source catalog	the chandra cosmos survey (c-cosmos) is a large, 1.8 ms, chandra} programthat has imaged the central 0.5 sq.deg of the cosmos field (centered at 10h,+02deg) with an effective exposure of ~160ksec, and an outer 0.4sq.deg. areawith an effective exposure of ~80ksec. the limiting source detection depths are1.9e-16 erg cm(-2) s(-1) in the soft (0.5-2 kev) band, 7.3e(-16) erg cm^-2 s^-1in the hard (2-10 kev) band, and 5.7e(-16) erg cm(-2) s(-1) in the full (0.5-10kev) band. here we describe the strategy, design and execution of the c-cosmossurvey, and present the catalog of 1761 point sources detected at a probabilityof being spurious of &lt;2e(-5) (1655 in the full, 1340 in the soft, and 1017 inthe hard bands). by using a grid of 36 heavily (~50%) overlapping pointingpositions with the acis-i imager, a remarkably uniform (to 12%) exposure acrossthe inner 0.5 sq.deg field was obtained, leading to a sharply defined lowerflux limit. the widely different psfs obtained in each exposure at each pointin the field required a novel source detection method, because of theoverlapping tiling strategy, which is described in a companion paper. (puccettiet al. paper ii). this method produced reliable sources down to a 7-12 counts,as verified by the resulting logn-logs curve, with sub-arcsecond positions,enabling optical and infrared identifications of virtually all sources, asreported in a second companion paper (civano et al. paper iii). the fullcatalog is described here in detail, and is available on-line.

0907.4155	galaxy zoo green peas: discovery of a class of compact extremely  star-forming galaxies	we investigate a class of rapidly growing emission line galaxies, known as"green peas", first noted by volunteers in the galaxy zoo project because oftheir peculiar bright green colour and small size, unresolved in sdss imaging.their appearance is due to very strong optical emission lines, namely [o iii]5007 a, with an unusually large equivalent width of up to ~1000 a. we discuss awell-defined sample of 251 colour-selected objects, most of which are stronglystar forming, although there are some agn interlopers including 8 newlydiscovered narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies. the star-forming peas are low massgalaxies (m~10^8.5 - 10^10 m_sun) with high star formation rates (~10m_sun/yr), low metallicities (log[o/h] + 12 ~ 8.7) and low reddening (e(b-v) &lt;0.25) and they reside in low density environments. they have some of thehighest specific star formation rates (up to ~10^{-8} yr^{-1}) seen in thelocal universe, yielding doubling times for their stellar mass of hundreds ofmyrs. the few star-forming peas with hst imaging appear to have several clumpsof bright star-forming regions and low surface density features that mayindicate recent or ongoing mergers. the peas are similar in size, mass,luminosity and metallicity to luminous blue compact galaxies. they are alsosimilar to high redshift uv-luminous galaxies, e.g., lyman-break galaxies andlyman-alpha emitters, and therefore provide a local laboratory with which tostudy the extreme star formation processes that occur in high-redshiftgalaxies. studying starbursting galaxies as a function of redshift is essentialto understanding the build up of stellar mass in the universe.

0910.4540	multiwavelength monitoring of the enigmatic narrow-line seyfert 1 pmn  j0948+0022 in march-july 2009	following the recent discovery of gamma rays from the radio-loud narrow-lineseyfert 1 galaxy pmn j0948+0022 (z=0.5846), we started a multiwavelengthcampaign from radio to gamma rays, which was carried out between the end ofmarch and the beginning of july 2009. the source displayed activity at all theobserved wavelengths: a general decreasing trend from optical to gamma-rayfrequencies was followed by an increase of radio emission after less than twomonths from the peak of the gamma-ray emission. the largest flux change, abouta factor of about 4, occurred in the x-ray band. the smallest was atultraviolet and near-infrared frequencies, where the rate of the detectedphotons dropped by a factor 1.6-1.9. at optical wavelengths, where the samplingrate was the highest, it was possible to observe day-scale variability, withflux variations up to a factor of about 3. the behavior of pmn j0948+0022observed in this campaign and the calculated power carried out by its jet inthe form of protons, electrons, radiation and magnetic field are quite similarto that of blazars, specifically of flat-spectrum radio quasars. these resultsconfirm the idea that radio-loud narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies hostrelativistic jets with power similar to that of average blazars.

0911.0003	heavily obscured agn in star-forming galaxies at z~2	we study the properties of a sample of 211 heavily-obscured active galacticnucleus (agn) candidates in the extended chandra deep field-south selectingobjects with f_24/f_r&gt;1000 and r-k&gt;4.5. of these, 18 were detected in x-raysand found to be obscured agn with neutral hydrogen column densities of ~10^23cm^-2. in the x-ray undetected sample, the following evidence suggests a largefraction of heavily-obscured (compton thick) agn: (i) the stacked x-ray signalof the sample is strong, with an observed ratio of soft to hard x-ray countsconsistent with a population of ~90% heavily obscured agn combined with 10%star-forming galaxies. (ii) the x-ray to mid-ir ratios for these sources aresignificantly larger than that of star-forming galaxies and ~2 orders ofmagnitude smaller than for the general agn population, suggesting columndensities of n_h&gt;5x10^24 cm^-2. (iii) the spitzer near- and mid-ir colors ofthese sources are consistent with those of the x-ray-detected sample if theeffects of dust self-absorption are considered. spectral fitting to therest-frame uv/optical light (dominated by the host galaxy) returns stellarmasses of ~10^11 m_sun and &lt;e(b-v)&gt; =0.5, and reveals evidence for asignificant young stellar population, indicating that these sources areexperiencing considerable star-formation. this sample of heavily-obscured agncandidates implies a space density at z~2 of ~10^-5 mpc^-3, finding a strongevolution in the number of l_x&gt;10^44 erg/s sources from z=1.5 to 2.5, possiblyconsistent with a short-lived heavily-obscured phase before an unobscuredquasar is visible.

0707.3980	deep chandra and multicolor hst observations of the jets of 3c 371 and  pks 2201+044	this paper presents multiwavelength imaging and broad-band spectroscopy ofthe relativistic jets in the two nearby radio galaxies 3c 371 and pks 2201+044,acquired with chandra, hst, vla, and merlin. radio polarization images are alsoavailable. the two sources stand out as "intermediate'' between fris and friis;their cores are classified as bl lacs, although broad and narrow opticalemission lines were detected at times. the multiwavelength images show jetmorphologies with the x-ray emission peaking closer to the nucleus than thelonger wavelengths. the jets are resolved at all wavelengths in a directionperpendicular to the jet axis. the jets seds are consistent with a singlespectral component from radio to x-rays, interpreted as synchrotron emission.the seds show a progressive softening from the inner to the outer regions ofthe jet, indicating that the electron break energy moves to lower energies withdistance from the core. overall, the x-ray and multiwavelength properties ofthe jets of 3c 371 and pks 2201+044 appear intermediate between those of frisand friis.

0709.0806	the uv colours of high-redshift early-type galaxies: evidence for recent  star formation and stellar mass assembly over the last 8 billion years	we combine deep ubvrizjk photometry from the multiwavelength survey byyale-chile (musyc) with redshifts from the combo-17 survey to perform alarge-scale study of the rest-frame ultraviolet (uv) properties of 674high-redshift (0.5&lt;z&lt;1) early-type galaxies, drawn from the extended chandradeep field south (e-cdfs). galaxy morphologies are determined through visualinspection of hubble space telescope (hst) images taken from the gems survey.we harness the sensitivity of the uv to young (&lt;1 gyr old) stars to quantifythe recent star formation history of early-type galaxies across a range ofluminosities (-23.5 &lt; m(v) &lt; -18). comparisons to simple stellar populationsforming at high redshift indicate that only ~1.1 percent of early-types in thissample are consistent with purely passive ageing since z=2. parametrising therecent star formation (rsf) in terms of the mass fraction of stars less than agyr old, we find that the early-type population as a whole shows a typical rsfbetween 5 and 13% in the redshift range 0.5&lt;z&lt;1. early-types on the uv redsequence show rsf values less than 5% while the reddest early-types arevirtually quiescent with rsf values of ~1%. we find compelling evidence thatearly-types of all luminosities form stars over the lifetime of the universe,although the bulk of their star formation is already complete at high redshift.this tail-end of star formation is measurable and not negligible, with luminous(-23&lt;m(v)&lt;-20.5) early-types potentially forming 10-15% of their mass sincez=1, with their less luminous (m(v)&gt;-20.5) counterparts potentially forming30-60 percent of their mass in the same redshift range.

1101.3815	similarity of the optical-ir and gamma-ray time variability of fermi  blazars	we present the time variability properties of a sample of six blazars, ao0235+164, 3c 273, 3c 279, pks 1510-089, pks 2155-304, and 3c 454.3, atoptical-ir as well as gamma-ray energies. these observations were carried outas a part of the yale/smarts program during 2008-2010 that has followed thevariations in emission of the bright fermi-lat-monitored blazars in thesouthern sky with closely-spaced observations at bvrjk bands. we find theoptical/ir time variability properties of these blazars to be remarkablysimilar to those at the gamma-ray energies. the power spectral density (psd)functions of the r-band variability of all six blazars are fit well by simplepower-law functions with negative slope such that there is higher amplitudevariability on longer timescales. no clear break is identified in the psd ofany of the sources. the average slope of the psd of r-band variability of theseblazars is similar to what was found by the fermi team for the gamma-rayvariability of a larger sample of bright blazars. this is consistent withleptonic models where the optical-ir and gamma-ray emission is generated by thesame population of electrons through synchrotron and inverse-compton processes,respectively. the prominent flares present in the optical-ir as well as thegamma-ray light curves of these blazars are predominantly symmetric, i.e., havesimilar rise and decay timescales, indicating that the long-term variability isdominated by the crossing time of radiation or a disturbance through theemission region rather than by the acceleration or energy-loss timescales ofthe radiating electrons. in the blazar 3c 454.3, which has the highest-qualitylight curves, the location of a large gamma-ray outburst during 2009 decemberis consistent with being in the jet at ~18 pc from the central engine. thisposes strong constraints on the models of high energy emission in the jets ofblazars.

1104.2619	obscured goods agn and their host galaxies at z &lt; 1.25: the slow black  hole growth phase	we compute black hole masses and bolometric luminosities for 87 obscured agnin the redshift range 0.25 &lt; z &lt; 1.25, selected from the goods deepmulti-wavelength survey fields via their x-ray emission. we fit the opticalimages and obtain morphological parameters for the host galaxy, separating thegalaxy from its central point source, thereby obtaining a four-band optical sedfor each active nucleus. we calculate bolometric luminosities for these agn byreddening a normalized mean sed of goods broad-line agn to match the observedcentral point-source sed of each obscured agn. this estimate of lbol has asmaller spread than simple bolometric corrections to the x-ray luminosity ordirect integration of the observed multi-wavelength sed, suggesting it is abetter measure. we estimate central black hole masses from the bulgeluminosities. the black hole masses span a wide range, 7 x 10^6 m_sun to 6 x10^9 m_sun; the median black hole mass is 5 x 10^8 m_sun. the majority of theseagn have l/l_edd &lt; 0.01, and we detect no significant evolution of the meaneddington ratio to z = 1.25. this implies that the bulk of black hole growth inthese obscured agn must have occurred at z &gt; 1 and that we are observing theseagn in a slow- or no-growth state.

1201.4380	smarts optical and infrared monitoring of 12 gamma-ray bright blazars	we present multiwavelength data for twelve blazars observed from 2008-2010 aspart of an ongoing optical-infrared photometric monitoring project. sourceswere selected to be bright, southern (dec &lt; 20 deg) blazars observed by thefermi gamma-ray space telescope, with daily and weekly gamma-ray fluxes madeavailable from the start of the fermi mission. light curves are presented forthe twelve blazars in bvrjk at near-daily cadence. we find that optical andinfrared fluxes are well correlated in all sources. gamma-ray bright flatspectrum radio quasars (fsrqs) in our sample have optical/infrared emissioncorrelated with gamma-rays consistent with inverse compton-scattering modelsfor gev emission. in fsrqs, the variability amplitude decreases towardsoptical/ir wavelengths, consistent with the presence of a thermal emissioncomponent from the accretion disk varying on significantly longer timescalesthan the jet synchrotron emission. in bl lac objects, variability is mainlyconstant across wavelengths, consistent with a weak or radiatively inefficientdisk. fsrqs have redder optical-infrared colors when they are brighter, whilebl lac objects show no such trend. several objects show complicatedcolor-magnitude behavior: ao 0235+164 appears in two different states dependingon whether it is gamma-ray bright or not. oj 287 and 3c 279 show somehysteresis tracks in their color-magnitude diagrams. individual flares may beachromatic or otherwise depart from the trend, suggesting different jetcomponents becoming important at different times. we present a time-dependentspectral energy distribution of the bright fsrq 3c 454.3 during its december2009 flare, which is well fit by an external compton model in the bright state,although day to day changes pose challenges to a simple one-zone model. alldata from the smarts monitoring program are publicly available on our website.

1207.2932	multi-wavelength observations of blazar ao 0235+164 in the 2008-2009  flaring state	the blazar ao 0235+164 (z = 0.94) has been one of the most active objectsobserved by fermi large area telescope (lat) since its launch in summer 2008.in addition to the continuous coverage by fermi, contemporaneous observationswere carried out from the radio to {\gamma} -ray bands between 2008 septemberand 2009 february. in this paper, we summarize the rich multi-wavelength datacollected during the campaign (including f-gamma, gasp- webt, kanata, ovro,rxte, smarts, swift, and other instruments), examine the cross-correlationbetween the light curves measured in the different energy bands, and interpretthe resulting spectral energy distributions in the context of well-known blazaremission models. we find that the {\gamma} -ray activity is well correlatedwith a series of near-ir/optical flares, accompanied by an increase in theoptical polarization degree. on the other hand, the x-ray light curve shows adistinct 20 day high state of unusually soft spectrum, which does not match theextrapolation of the optical/uv synchrotron spectrum. we tentatively interpretthis feature as the bulk compton emission by cold electrons contained in thejet, which requires an accretion disk corona with an effective covering factorof 19% at a distance of 100 rg . we model the broadband spectra with a leptonicmodel with external radiation dominated by the infrared emission from the dustytorus.

1207.4190	galaxy zoo: bulgeless galaxies with growing black holes	the growth of supermassive black holes appears to be driven by galaxymergers, violent merger-free processes and/or `secular' processes. in order toquantify the effects of secular evolution on black hole growth, we study asample of active galactic nuclei (agn) in galaxies with a calm formationhistory free of significant mergers, a population that heretofore has beendifficult to locate. here we present an initial sample of 13 agn in massive(m_* &gt;~ 1e10 m_sun) bulgeless galaxies -- which lack the classical bulgesbelieved inevitably to result from mergers -- selected from the sloan digitalsky survey using visual classifications from galaxy zoo. parametricmorphological fitting confirms the host galaxies lack classical bulges; anycontributions from pseudobulges are very small (typically &lt; 5%). we computeblack hole masses for the two broad-line objects in the sample (4.2e6 and 1.2e7m_sun) and place lower limits on black hole masses for the remaining sample(typically m_bh &gt;~ 1e6 m_sun), showing that significant black hole growth mustbe possible in the absence of mergers or violent disk instabilities.  the black hole masses are systematically higher than expected fromestablished bulge-black hole relations. however, if the mean eddington ratio ofthe systems with measured black hole masses (l/l_edd = 0.065) is typical, 10 of13 sources are consistent with the correlation between black hole mass andtotal stellar mass. that pure disk galaxies and their central black holes maybe consistent with a relation derived from elliptical and bulge-dominatedgalaxies with very different formation histories implies the details of stellargalaxy evolution and dynamics may not be fundamental to the co-evolution ofgalaxies and black holes.

1303.2095	the contrasting nature of gamma-ray/optical variability in the blazar  pks 0208-512 during successive outbursts	the yale/smarts optical-near-ir monitoring program has followed thevariations in emission of the fermi-lat monitored blazars in the southern skywith closely spaced observations since 2008. we report the discovery of anoptical-near-ir (oir) outburst with no accompanying gamma-rays in the blazarpks 0208-512, one of the targets of this program. while the source undergoesthree outbursts of 1 mag or more at oir wavelengths lasting for longer than 3months during 2008-2011, only interval 1 and 3 have corresponding bright phasesin gev energies lasting longer than 1 month. the oir outburst during interval 2is comparable in brightness and temporal extent to the oir flares duringintervals 1 and 3 which do have gamma-ray counterparts. gamma-ray and oirvariability are very well-correlated in most cases in the fermi blazars and thelack of correlation in this case is anomalous. by analyzing the gamma-ray, oir,and supporting multi-wavelength variability data in details, we speculate thatthe location of the outburst in the jet during interval 2 was closer to theblack hole where the jet is more compact and the magnetic field strength ishigher, and the bulk lorentz factor of the material in the jet is smaller.these result in a much lower compton dominance and no observable gamma-rayoutburst during interval 2.

1309.4494	first results from nustar observations of mkn 421	mkn 421 is a nearby active galactic nucleus dominated at all wavelengths by avery broad non-thermal continuum thought to arise from a relativistic jet seenat a small angle to the line of sight. its spectral energy distribution peaksin the x-ray and tev gamma-ray bands, where the energy output is dominated bycooling of high-energy electrons in the jet. in order to study the electrondistribution and its evolution, we carried out a dedicated multi-wavelengthcampaign, including extensive observations by the recently launched highlysensitive hard x-ray telescope nustar, between december 2012 and may 2013. herewe present some initial results based on nustar data from january through march2013, as well as calibration observations conducted in 2012. although theobservations cover some of the faintest hard x-ray flux states ever observedfor mkn 421, the sensitivity is high enough to resolve intra-day spectralvariability. we find that in this low state the dominant flux variations aresmooth on timescales of hours, with typical intra-hour variations of less than5%. we do not find evidence for either a cutoff in the hard x-ray spectrum, ora rise towards a high-energy component, but rather that at low flux thespectrum assumes a power law shape with a photon index of approximately 3. thespectrum is found to harden with increasing brightness.

1402.2666	nustar observations of heavily obscured quasars at z ~ 0.5	we present nustar hard x-ray (3-79 kev) observations of three type 2 quasarsat z ~ 0.4-0.5, optically selected from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss).although the quasars show evidence for being heavily obscured compton-thicksystems on the basis of the 2-10 kev to [oiii] luminosity ratio andmultiwavelength diagnostics, their x-ray absorbing column densities (n_h) arepoorly known. in this analysis: (1) we study x-ray emission at &gt;10 kev, wherex-rays from the central black hole are relatively unabsorbed, in order tobetter constrain n_h; (2) we further characterize the physical properties ofthe sources through broad-band near-uv to mid-ir spectral energy distribution(sed) analyses. one of the quasars is detected with nustar at &gt;8 kev with ano-source probability of &lt;0.1%, and its x-ray band ratio suggests nearcompton-thick absorption with n_h \gtrsim 5 x 10^23 cm^-2. the other twoquasars are undetected, and have low x-ray to mid-ir luminosity ratios in boththe low energy (2-10 kev) and high energy (10-40 kev) x-ray regimes that areconsistent with extreme, compton-thick absorption (n_h \gtrsim 10^24 cm^-2). wefind that for quasars at z ~ 0.5, nustar provides a significant improvementcompared to lower energy (&lt;10 kev) chandra and xmm-newton observations alone,as higher column densities can now be directly constrained.

1406.3345	the 2-79 kev x-ray spectrum of the circinus galaxy with nustar,  xmm-newton and chandra: a fully compton-thick agn	the circinus galaxy is one of the nearest obscured agn, making it an idealtarget for detailed study. combining archival chandra and xmm-newton data withnew nustar observations, we model the 2-79 kev spectrum to constrain theprimary agn continuum and to derive physical parameters for the obscuringmaterial. chandra's high angular resolution allows a separation of nuclear andoff-nuclear galactic emission. in the off-nuclear diffuse emission we findsignatures of strong cold reflection, including high equivalent-width neutralfe lines. this compton-scattered off-nuclear emission amounts to 18% of thenuclear flux in the fe line region, but becomes comparable to the nuclearemission above 30 kev. the new analysis no longer supports a prominenttransmitted agn component in the observed band. we find that the nuclearspectrum is consistent with compton-scattering by an optically-thick torus,where the intrinsic spectrum is a powerlaw of photon index $\gamma = 2.2-2.4$,the torus has an equatorial column density of $n_{\rm h} =(6-10)\times10^{24}$cm$^{-2}$ and the intrinsic agn $2-10$ kev luminosity is$(2.3-5.1)\times 10^{42}$ erg/s. these values place circinus along the samerelations as unobscured agn in accretion rate-vs-$\gamma$ and $l_x$-vs-$l_{ir}$phase space. nustar's high sensitivity and low background allow us to study theshort time-scale variability of circinus at x-ray energies above 10 kev for thefirst time. the lack of detected variability favors a compton-thick absorber,in line with the the spectral fitting results.

1407.1844	nustar unveils a compton-thick type 2 quasar in mrk 34	we present nustar 3-40 kev observations of the optically selected type 2quasar (qso2) sdss j1034+6001 or mrk 34. the high-quality hard x-ray spectrumand archival xmm-newton data can be fitted self-consistently with areflection-dominated continuum and strong fe kalpha fluorescence line withequivalent-width &gt;1 kev. prior x-ray spectral fitting below 10 kev showed thesource to be consistent with being obscured by compton-thin column densities ofgas along the line-of-sight, despite evidence for much higher columns frommultiwavelength data. nustar now enables a direct measurement of this column,and shows that nh lies in the compton-thick (ct) regime. the new data also showa high intrinsic 2-10 kev luminosity of l_{2-10}~10^{44} erg/s, in contrast toprevious low-energy x-ray measurements for which l_{2-10}&lt;~10^{43} erg/s (i.e.x-ray selection below 10 kev does not pick up this source as an intrinsicallyluminous obscured quasar). both the obscuring column and the intrinsic powerare about an order of magnitude (or more) larger than inferred from pre-nustarx-ray spectral fitting. mrk34 is thus a 'gold standard' ct qso2 and is thenearest non-merging system in this class, in contrast to the other local ctquasar ngc6240 which is currently undergoing a major merger coupled with strongstar-formation. for typical x-ray bolometric correction factors, the accretionluminosity of mrk34 is high enough to potentially power the total infraredluminosity. x-ray spectral fitting also shows that thermal emission related tostar-formation is unlikely to drive the observed bright soft component below ~3kev, favoring photionization instead.

0804.1363	the accuracy of morphological decomposition of active galactic nucleus  host galaxies	in order to assess the accuracy with which we can determine the morphologiesof agn host galaxies, we have simulated more than 50,000 acs images of galaxieswith z &lt; 1.25, using image and noise properties appropriate for the goodssurvey. we test the effect of central point-source brightness on host galaxyparameter recovery with a set of simulated agn host galaxies made by addingpoint sources to the centers of normal galaxies. we extend this analysis andalso quantify the recovery of intrinsic morphological parameters of agn hostgalaxies with a set of fully simulated inactive and agn host galaxies.  we can reliably separate good from poor fit results using a combination ofreasonable error cuts, in the regime where l_{host}:l_{ps} &gt; 1:4. we givequantitative estimates of parameter errors as a function ofhost-to-point-source ratio. in general, we separate host and point-sourcemagnitudes reliably at all redshifts; point sources are well recovered morethan 90% of the time, although spurious detection of central point sources canbe as high as 25% for bulge-dominated sources. we find a general correlationbetween sersic index and intrinsic bulge-to-total ratio, such that a hostgalaxy with sersic n &lt; 1.5 generally has at least 80% of its light from a diskcomponent. likewise, "bulge-dominated" galaxies with n &gt; 4 typically derive atleast 70% of their total host galaxy light from a bulge, but this number can beas low as 55%. single-component sersic fits to an agn host galaxy arestatistically very reliable to z &lt; 1.25 (for acs survey data like ours). incontrast, two-component fits involving separate bulge and disk components tendto over-estimate the bulge fraction by ~10%, with uncertainty of order 50%.

1502.01018	the smarts multi-epoch optical spectroscopy atlas (samosa): using  emission line variability to probe the location of the blazar gamma-emitting  region	we present multi-epoch optical spectroscopy of seven southern fermi-monitoredblazars from 2008 - 2013 using the small and medium aperture research telescopesystem (smarts), with supplemental spectroscopy and polarization data from thesteward observatory. we find that the emission lines are much less variablethan the continuum; 4 of 7 blazars had no detectable emission line variabilityover the 5 years. this is consistent with photoionization primarily by anaccretion disk, allowing us to use the lines as a probe of disk activity.comparing optical emission line flux with fermi $\gamma$-ray flux and opticalpolarized flux, we investigate whether relativistic jet variability is relatedto the accretion flow. in general, we see no such dependence, suggesting thejet variability is likely caused by internal processes like turbulence or shockacceleration rather than a variable accretion rate. however, three sourcesshowed statistically significant emission line flares in close temporalproximity to very large fermi $\gamma$-ray flares. while we do not havesufficient emission line data to quantitatively assess their correlation withthe $\gamma$-ray flux, it appears that in some cases, the jet might provideadditional photoionizing flux to the broad line region, which implies somegamma-rays are produced within the broad line region, at least for these largeflares.

1502.04699	rapid variability of blazar 3c 279 during flaring states in 2013-2014  with joint fermi-lat, nustar, swift, and ground-based multi-wavelength  observations	we report the results of a multi-band observing campaign on the famous blazar3c 279 conducted during a phase of increased activity from 2013 december to2014 april, including first observations of it with nustar. the $\gamma$-rayemission of the source measured by fermi-lat showed multiple distinct flaresreaching the highest flux level measured in this object since the beginning ofthe fermi mission, with $f(e &gt; 100\,{\rm mev})$ of $10^{-5}$ photons cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, and with a flux doubling time scale as short as 2 hours. the$\gamma$-ray spectrum during one of the flares was very hard, with an index of$\gamma_\gamma = 1.7 \pm 0.1$, which is rarely seen in flat spectrum radioquasars. the lack of concurrent optical variability implies a very high comptondominance parameter $l_\gamma/l_{\rm syn} &gt; 300$. two 1-day nustar observationswith accompanying swift pointings were separated by 2 weeks, probing differentlevels of source activity. while the 0.5$-$70 kev x-ray spectrum obtainedduring the first pointing, and fitted jointly with swift-xrt is well-describedby a simple power law, the second joint observation showed an unusual spectralstructure: the spectrum softens by $\delta\gamma_{\rm x} \simeq 0.4$ at $\sim$4kev. modeling the broad-band sed during this flare with the standardsynchrotron plus inverse compton model requires: (1) the location of the$\gamma$-ray emitting region is comparable with the broad line region radius,(2) a very hard electron energy distribution index $p \simeq 1$, (3) total jetpower significantly exceeding the accretion disk luminosity $l_{\rm j}/l_{\rmd} \gtrsim 10$, and (4) extremely low jet magnetization with $l_{\rm b}/l_{\rmj} \lesssim 10^{-4}$. we also find that single-zone models that match theobserved $\gamma$-ray and optical spectra cannot satisfactorily explain theproduction of x-ray emission.

1504.02111	major mergers host the most luminous red quasars at z ~ 2: a hubble  space telescope wfc3/ir study	we used the hubble space telescope wfc3 near-infrared camera to image thehost galaxies of a sample of eleven luminous, dust-reddened quasars at z ~ 2 --the peak epoch of black hole growth and star formation in the universe -- totest the merger-driven picture for the co-evolution of galaxies and theirnuclear black holes. the red quasars come from the first+2mass red quasarsurvey and a newer, deeper, ukidss+first sample. these dust-reddened quasarsare the most intrinsically luminous quasars in the universe at all redshifts,and may represent the dust-clearing transitional phase in the merger-drivenblack hole growth scenario. probing the host galaxies in rest-frame visiblelight, the hst images reveal that 8/10 of these quasars have actively merginghosts, while one source is reddened by an intervening lower redshift galaxyalong the line-of-sight. we study the morphological properties of the quasarhosts using parametric sersic fits as well as the non-parametric estimators(gini coefficient, m_{20} and asymmetry). their properties are heterogeneousbut broadly consistent with the most extreme morphologies of local mergingsystems such as ultraluminous infrared galaxies. the red quasars have aluminosity range of log(l_bol) = 47.8 - 48.3 (erg/s) and the merger fraction oftheir agn hosts is consistent with merger-driven models of luminous agnactivity at z=2, which supports the picture in which luminous quasars andgalaxies co-evolve through major mergers that trigger both star formation andblack hole growth.

1510.04477	the hard x-ray emission of the luminous infrared galaxy ngc 6240 as  observed by nustar	we present a broad-band (~0.3-70 kev) spectral and temporal analysis ofnustar observations of the luminous infrared galaxy ngc 6240, combined witharchival chandra, xmm-newton and bepposax data. ngc 6240 is a galaxy in arelatively early merger state with two distinct nuclei separated by ~1."5.previous chandra observations have resolved the two nuclei, showing that theyare both active and obscured by compton-thick material. although they cannot beresolved by nustar, thanks to the unprecedented quality of the nustar data atenergies &gt;10 kev, we clearly detect, for the first time, both the primary andthe reflection continuum components. the nustar hard x-ray spectrum isdominated by the primary continuum piercing through an absorbing column densitywhich is mildly optically thick to compton scattering (tau ~ 1.2, n_h ~ 1.5 x10^(24) cm^-2). we detect moderate hard x-ray (&gt; 10 kev) flux variability up to20% on short (15-20 ksec) timescales. the amplitude of the variability ismaximum at ~30 kev and is likely to originate from the primary continuum of thesouthern nucleus. nevertheless, the mean hard x-ray flux on longer timescales(years) is relatively constant. moreover, the two nuclei remain compton-thick,although we find evidence of variability of the material along the line ofsight with column densities n_h &lt;~ 2 x 10^(23) cm-2 over long (~3-15 years)timescales. the observed x-ray emission in the nustar energy range is fullyconsistent with the sum of the best-fit models of the spatially resolvedchandra spectra of the two nuclei.

1512.02235	multiwavelength study of quiescent states of mrk 421 with unprecedented  hard x-ray coverage provided by nustar in 2013	we present coordinated multiwavelength observations of the bright, nearby bllac object mrk 421 taken in 2013 january-march, involving gasp-webt, swift,nustar, fermi-lat, magic, veritas, and other collaborations and instruments,providing data from radio to very-high-energy (vhe) gamma-ray bands. nustaryielded previously unattainable sensitivity in the 3-79 kev range, revealingthat the spectrum softens when the source is dimmer until the x-ray spectralshape saturates into a steep power law with a photon index of approximately 3,with no evidence for an exponential cutoff or additional hard components up toabout 80 kev. for the first time, we observed both the synchrotron and theinverse-compton peaks of the spectral energy distribution (sed) simultaneouslyshifted to frequencies below the typical quiescent state by an order ofmagnitude. the fractional variability as a function of photon energy shows adouble-bump structure which relates to the two bumps of the broadband sed. ineach bump, the variability increases with energy which, in the framework of thesynchrotron self-compton model, implies that the electrons with higher energiesare more variable. the measured multi-band variability, the significantx-ray-to-vhe correlation down to some of the lowest fluxes ever observed inboth bands, the lack of correlation between optical/uv and x-ray flux, the lowdegree of polarization and its significant (random) variations, the shortestimated electron cooling time, and the significantly longer variabilitytimescale observed in the nustar light curves point toward in-situ electronacceleration, and suggest that there are multiple compact regions contributingto the broadband emission of mrk 421 during low-activity states.

astro-ph;0008505	complex spectral variability from intensive multi-wavelength monitoring  of mrk421 in 1998	we conducted a multi-frequency campaign for the tev blazar mrk~421 in 1998april. the campaign started from a pronounced high amplitude flare recorded bysax and whipple; asca observation started three days later. in the x-ray data,we detected multiple flares, occuring on time scales of about one day. ascadata clearly reveal spectral variability. the comparison of the data from asca,euve and rxte indicates that the variability amplitudes in the low energysynchrotron component are larger at higher photon energies. in tev gamma-rays,large intra-day variations -- which were correlated with the x-ray flux -- wereobserved when results from three cherenkov telescopes are combined. the rmsvariability of tev gamma--rays was similar to that observed in hard x-rays,above 10 kev. the x-ray light curve reveals flares which are almost symmetricfor most of cases, implying the dominant time scale is the light crossing timethrough the emitting region. the structure function analysis based on thecontinuous x-ray light curve of seven days indicates that the characteristictime scale is ~0.5 day. the analysis of asca light curves in various energybands appears to show both soft (positive) and hard (negative) lags. these maynot be real, as systematic effects could also produce these lags, which are allmuch smaller than an orbit. if the lags of both signs are real, these implythat the particle acceleration and x-ray cooling time scales are similar.

0808.1727	mapping the dark matter from uv light at high redshift: an empirical  approach to understand galaxy statistics	we present a simple formalism to interpret two galaxy statistics, the uvluminosity function and two-point correlation functions for star-forminggalaxies at z~4, 5, 6 in the context of lcdm cosmology. both statistics are theresult of how star formation takes place in dm halos, and thus are used toconstrain how uv light depends on halo properties such as mass. the twomeasures were taken from the goods data, thus ideal for joint analysis. the twophysical quantities we explore are the sf duty cycle, and the range of l_uvthat a halo of mass m can have (mean and variance). the former addresses thetypical duration of sf activity in halos while the latter addresses theaveraged sf history and regularity of gas inflow into these systems. we explorevarious physical models consistent with data, and find the following: 1) thetypical duration of sf observed in the data is &lt;0.4 gyr (1 sig), 2) theinferred scaling law between l_uv and halo mass m from the observed slope ofthe lfs is roughly linear at all redshifts, and 3) l_uv for a fixed halo massdecreases with time, implying that the sf efficiency (after dust extinction) ishigher at earlier times. we explore several physical scenarios relating starformation to halo mass, but find that these scenarios are indistinguishable dueto the limited range of halo mass probed by our data. in order to discriminatebetween different scenarios, we discuss constraining the bright-faint galaxycross-correlation functions and luminosity-dependence of galaxy bias.(abridged)

astro-ph;0207355	broad-band continuum and line emission of the gamma-ray blazar pks  0537-441	pks 0537-441, a bright gamma-ray emitting blazar, was observed at radio,optical, uv and x-ray frequencies during various egret pointings, oftenquasi-simultaneously. in 1995 the object was found in an intense emission stateat all wavelengths. bepposax observations made in 1998, non-simultaneously withexposures at other frequencies, allow us to characterize precisely the spectralshape of the high energy blazar component, which we attribute to inversecompton scattering. the optical-to-gamma-ray spectral energy distributions atthe different epochs show that the gamma-ray luminosity dominates thebolometric output. this, together with the presence of optical and uv lineemission, suggests that, besides the synchrotron self-compton mechanism, thecompton upscattering of photons external to the jet (e.g., in the broad lineregion) may have a significant role for high energy radiation. themultiwavelength variability can be reproduced by changes of the plasma bulklorentz factor. the spectrum secured by iue in 1995 appears to be partiallyabsorbed shortward of ~1700 a. however, this signature is not detected in thehst spectrum taken during a lower state of the source. the presence ofintervening absorbers is not supported by optical imaging and spectroscopy ofthe field.

astro-ph;0302265	chandra observations of nuclear x-ray emission from a sample of radio  sources	we present the x-ray properties of a sample of 17 radio sources observed withthe chandra x-ray observatory as part of a project aimed at studying the x-rayemission from their radio jets. in this paper, we concentrate on the x-rayproperties of the unresolved cores. the sample includes 16 quasars (11core-dominated and 5 lobe-dominated) in the redshift range z=0.30--1.96, andone low-power radio-galaxy at z=0.064. no diffuse x-ray emission is presentaround the cores of the quasars, except for the nearby low-power galaxy thathas diffuse emission on a scale and with a luminosity consistent with otherfris. no high-amplitude, short-term variability is detected within therelatively short chandra exposures. however, 1510-089 shows low-amplitude fluxchanges with a timescale of $\sim$25 minutes. the x-ray spectra of the quasarcores are generally well described by a single power law model with galacticabsorption. however, in six quasars we find soft x-ray excess emission below1.6 kev. interestingly, we detect an fe k-shell emission line, consistent withfluorescent kalpha emission from cold iron, in one lobe- and two core-dominatedsources. the average x-ray photon index for the quasars in the sample isgamma=1.66 and dispersion, sigma=0.23. the average spectral slope for oursample is flatter than the slope found for radio-quiet quasars and forradio-loud agns with larger jet orientations; this indicates that beamingaffects the x-ray emission from the cores in our sample of quasars.

astro-ph;0304244	bepposax observations of centaurus a: the hard continuum and the iron  line feature	the radio galaxy centaurus a was observed by the bepposax satellite fivetimes from 1997 to 2000. from july 6 1999 to august 17 1999, the source wasalso simultaneously pointed by comptel on-board of the satellite cgro.centaurus a has a complex spectrum with multiple extended components and astrongly absorbed (n_h\sim 10^{23}$ cm${-2}) nucleus well fitted by a power law(\gamma \sim 1.8) which bends at high energies. when the bepposax and comptelobservations are combined together, an exponential cutoff with e-folding energy\sim 1000 kev gives an adequate description of the spectral steepening. acomplex feature in emission at 6-7 kev is resolved into two fe components, onenarrow cold line and an ionized line centred at 6.8 kev. significant variationshave been observed in the iron feature, with the less prominent ionized lineseemingly being the only one responsible for them: its variations do not appearto correlate with the strength of the continuum. the high energy cutoff and thefe feature suggest the presence of an accretion flow in the centaurus anucleus. however the absence of a significant reflection, the narrowness of thecold line as well as the lack of correlation between the continuum and 6.8 kevline variations disfavour a standard cold/ionized thin disk (at least in theinner regions). a more plausible configuration might be a hot thick opticallythin accretion flow surrounded by material with different opacities.  finally, we note that high energy break observed by bepposax and comptelcould be also reasonably explained by inverse compton radiation from a jet. ifthis is the case, a structured jet with outer slow layers surrounding a beamedinner region is necessary to explain the strong fe feature observed bybepposax.

astro-ph;0401475	a survey of extended radio jets with chandra and hst	we present the results from an x-ray and optical survey of a sample of 17radio jets in agn performed with chandra and hst. the sample was selected fromthe radio and is unbiased toward detection at shorter wavelengths, butpreferentially it includes beamed sources. we find that x-ray emission iscommon on kpc-scales, with over half radio jets exhibiting at least one x-rayknot on the chandra images. the distributions of the radio-to-x-ray andradio-to-optical spectral indices for the detected jets are similar to thelimits for the non-detections,suggesting all bright radio jets have x-raycounterparts which will be visible in longer observations. comparing the radioand x-ray morphologies shows that the majority of the x-ray jets havestructures that closely map the radio. analysis of the sed of the jet knotssuggest the knots in which the x-ray and radio morphologies track each otherproduce x-rays by ic scattering of the cosmic microwave background. theremaining knots produce x-rays by the synchrotron process. spectral changes aredetected along the jets, with the ratio of the x-ray-to-radio andoptical-to-radio flux densities decreasing from the inner to the outer regions.this suggests the presence of an additional contribution to the x-ray flux inthe jet's inner part, either from synchrotron or ic of the stellar light.alternatively, in a pure ic/cmb scenario, the plasma decelerates as it flowsfrom the inner to the outer regions. finally, the x-ray spectral indices forthe brightest knots are flat, indicating that the bulk of the luminosity of thejets is emitted at gev energies, and raising the interesting possibility offuture detections with glast.

astro-ph;0408099	obscured agn and the x-ray, optical and far-infrared number counts of  agn in the goods fields	the deep x-ray, optical, and far-infrared fields that constitute goods aresensitive to obscured agn (n_h&gt;10^{22} cm^{-2}) at the quasar epoch (z~2-3), aswell as to unobscured agn as distant as z~7. luminous x-ray emission is a signof accretion onto a supermassive black hole and thus reveals all but the mostheavily obscured agn. we combine x-ray luminosity functions with appropriatespectral energy distributions for agn to model the x-ray, optical andfar-infrared flux distributions of the x-ray sources in the goods fields. asimple model based on the unified paradigm for agn, with ~3 times as manyobscured agn as unobscured, successfully reproduces the z-band fluxdistributions measured in the deep hst acs observations on the goods north andsouth fields. this model is also consistent with the observed spectroscopic andphotometric redshift distributions once selection effects are considered. thepreviously reported discrepancy between observed spectroscopic redshiftdistributions and the predictions of population synthesis models for the x-raybackground can be explained by bias against the most heavily obscured agngenerated both by x-ray observations and the identification of sources viaoptical spectroscopy. we predict the agn number counts for spitzer mips 24 umand irac 3.6-8 um observations in the goods fields, which will verify whethermost agn in the early universe are obscured in the optical. such agn should bevery bright far-infrared sources and include some obscured agn missed even byx-ray observations.

astro-ph;0505300	agn unification and the x-ray background	active galactic nuclei (agn) unification, which implies a large number ofobscured agn, can explain the optical, infrared and x-ray content of deepmultiwavelength surveys. here, we show that the same model also successfullyexplains the spectral shape and intensity of the x-ray background. the simplestpossible unified model assumes a constant ratio of obscured to unobscured agn,independent of redshift or luminosity. with almost no free parameters, thepredicted x-ray background agrees remarkably well with observations. both theobserved properties of deep agn samples and the x-ray background can beexplained by the same model without invoking different evolution for obscuredand unobscured agn. recent observational evidence shows that the ratio ofobscured to unobscured agn may depend on luminosity. an agn unification modelthat allows for such a dependence also fits the x-ray background spectrum, andthe predicted numbers counts in the 2-10 kev x-ray band are in good agreementwith observations. we present predictions for the source counts in hard x-rays(10-100 kev), which indicate that future missions like the black hole finderwill observe thousands of heavily obscured agn.

astro-ph;0506316	black hole masses and host galaxy evolution of radio-loud active  galactic nuclei	we report stellar velocity dispersion measurements for a sample of 28 agnhost galaxies including our previous work. using the mass-dispersion($m_{\bullet}-\sigma$) and the fundamental plane relations, we estimate theblack hole mass for a sample of 66 bl lac objects and investigate the role ofblack hole mass in the energetics of bl lac objects. the black hole mass rangefor different bl lac spectral types is similar, $10^{7} &lt; m_{\bullet} &lt; 4\times 10^{9}$. neither x-ray nor radio luminosity correlates with black holemass. low-frequency-peaked bl lac objects have higher eddington ratios onaverage, because of either more beaming or higher intrinsic power. for theblack hole mass range $3 \times 10^{7} &lt; m_{\bullet} &lt; 10^{9}$, the radioluminosity of bl lac objects and flat-spectrum radio quasars spans over 4orders of magnitude, with bl lac objects being low-power agns. we alsoinvestigate the evolution of host galaxies for 39 agns out to $z \approx 0.5$with measuredstellar velocity dispersions. comparing the mass-to-light ratioevolution in the observed frame with population synthesis models, we find thatsingle burst star formation models with $z_{form} = 1.4^{+0.9}_{-0.2} $ areconsistent with the observations. from our $z_{form}=1.4$ model, we estimatedthe intrinsic mass-to-light ratio evolution in the cousins $r$ band, $\deltalog (m/l)/ \delta z = -0.502 \pm 0.08$, consistent with that of normal earlytype galaxies.

astro-ph;0605530	shedding new light on the 3c 273 jet with the spitzer space telescope	we have performed infrared imaging of the jet of the quasar 3c 273 atwavelengths 3.6 and 5.8 microns with the infrared array camera (irac) on thespitzer space telescope. when combined with the radio, optical and x-raymeasurements, the irac photometry clearly shows that the optical emission isdominated by the high-energy component of the jet, not by the radio synchrotroncomponent, as had been assumed to date. the high-energy component may be due toa second synchrotron component or to ic scattering of ambient photons. in theformer case, we argue that the acceleration of protons exceeding 10^16 ev orpossibly even to 10^19 ev would be taking place in the jet. in contrast, the icmodel, into which highly relativistic doppler beaming has to be incorporated,requires very low-energy electrons (~ 1 mev). the present polarization data inthe radio and optical would favor the former interpretation in the case of the3c 273 jet. sensitive and detailed measurements of optical polarization areimportant to establish the radiation mechanism responsible for the high-energyemission. the present study offers new clues as to the controversial origin ofthe x-ray emission seen in many quasar jets.

astro-ph;9902333	the hst survey of bl lac objects: gravitational lens candidates and  other unusual sources	we present hst observations of seven unusual objects from the hst ``snapshotsurvey'' of bl lac objects, of which four are gravitational lens candidates. inthree cases a double point sources is observed: 0033+595, with 1.58 arcsecseparation, and 0502+675 and 1440+122, each with $\sim 0.3$ arcsec separation.the last two also show one or more galaxies, which could be either host orlensing galaxies. if any are confirmed as lenses, these bl lac objects areexcellent candidates for measuring h$_0$ via gravitational time delay becauseof their characteristic rapid, high amplitude variability. an additionaladvantage is that, like other blazars, they are likely superluminal radiosources, in which case the source plane is mapped out over a period of years,providing strong additional constraints on the lensing mass distribution. thefourth gravitational lens candidate is 1517+656, which is surrounded by threearclets forming an almost perfect ring of radius 2.4 arcsec. if this is indeedan einstein ring, it is most likely a background source gravitationally lensedby the bl lac object host galaxy and possibly a surrounding group or cluster.in the extreme case that all four candidates are true lenses, the derivedfrequency of gravitational lensing in this bl lac sample would be an order ofmagnitude higher than in comparable quasar samples.  we also report on three other remarkable bl lac objects: 0138-097, which issurrounded by a large number of close companion galaxies; 0806+524, whose hostgalaxy contains an uncommon arc-like structure; and 1959+650, which is hostedby a gas rich elliptical galaxy with a prominent dust lane of $\sim 5\times10^5 m_\odot$.

astro-ph;9903321	spectral evolution of pks 2155-304 observed with bepposax during an  active gamma-ray phase	we present the results of bepposax observations of pks 2155-304 during anintense gamma-ray flare. the source was in a high x-ray state. a temporalanalysis of the data reveals a tendency of the amplitude of variations toincrease with energy, and the presence of a soft lag with a timescale of theorder 10^3 s. a curved continuum spectrum, with no evidence of spectralfeatures, extends up to ~50 kev, while there is indication of a flattercomponent emerging at higher energies, consistent with the interpretation ofthe broad band spectral energy distribution (sed) as due to synchrotronself-compton (ssc) emission from a single region. notably, the fitting of thesed with such a model is consistent with an interpretation of the detected softlag as due to radiative cooling, supporting the idea that radiation losses playan important role in variability. the observed shifts of the sed peaks betweenthe lowest and highest flux levels can be accounted for by an increase of thebreak energy in the relativistic particle spectrum. the model predicts emissionat tev energies in good agreement with the recently reported detection.

astro-ph;9906326	ultraviolet and multiwavelength variability of the blazar 3c 279:  evidence for thermal emission	the gamma-ray blazar 3c 279 was monitored on a nearly daily basis with iue,rosat and egret for three weeks between december 1992 and january 1993. duringthis period, the blazar was at a historical minimum at all wavelengths. here wepresent the uv data obtained during the above multiwavelength campaign. amaximum uv variation of ~50% is detected, while during the same period thex-ray flux varied by no more than 13%. at the lowest uv flux level the averagespectrum in the 1230-2700 a interval is unusually flat for this object(&lt;alpha_uv&gt;~1). the flattening could represent the lowest energy tail of theinverse compton component responsible for the x-ray emission, or could be dueto the presence of a thermal component at ~20000 k possibly associated with anaccretion disk. the presence of an accretion disk in this blazar object, likelyobservable only in very low states and otherwise hidden by the beamed, variablesynchrotron component, would be consistent with the scenario in which the seedphotons for the inverse compton mechanism producing the gamma-rays are externalto the relativistic jet. we further discuss the long term correlation of the uvflux with the x-ray and gamma-ray fluxes obtained at various epochs. all uvarchival data are included in the analysis. both the x- and gamma-ray fluxesare generally well correlated with the uv flux, approximately with square rootand quadratic dependences, respectively.

astro-ph;9908090	variability pattern and the spectral evolution of the bl lacertae object  pks 2155-304	the tev blazar pks 2155-304 was monitored with the x-ray satellite asca in1994 may, as part of a multiwavelength campaign from the radio to x-ray bands.at the beginning of the two-day continuous observation, we detected a largeflare, where the 2-10 kev flux changed by a factor of 2 on a time scale of 3 x10^4 sec. during the flare, the increase in the hard x-ray flux clearlypreceded that observed in the soft x-rays, the spectral evolution tracking a`clockwise loop' in the flux versus photon index plane. ascribing theenergy-dependent variability to differential synchrotron cooling ofrelativistic electrons, we estimate the magnetic field b in the emissionregion. we tested two different methods of comparing the time series in variousx-ray bands: (i) fitting the light curves to a gaussian and searching for thetime shift of the peak of the flare, and (ii) calculating the discretecorrelation function. both methods yielded a consistent solution of b ~ 0.1 g.we also found that the flare amplitude becomes larger as the photon energyincreases, while the duration of the flare stays roughly constant through theasca energy band (0.7-7.5 kev). in the framework of the time dependentsynchrotron self-compton model in a homogeneous region, we consider a flarewhere the maximum lorentz factor (gmax) of the injected electrons increasesuniformly throughout the emission volume. the temporal evolution of spectra aswell as the light curves were reproduced with the physical parametersself-consistently determined from seven observables. we obtain b ~ 0.1-0.2 gand a region size r ~ 10^-2 pc, for relativistic beaming with a doppler factorof d ~ 20-30. we discuss the significance of light travel time effects.

0810.3917	optical spectroscopy of x-ray sources in the extended chandra deep field  south	we present the first results of our optical spectroscopy program aimed toprovide redshifts and identifications for the x-ray sources in the extendedchandra deep field south. a total of 339 sources were targeted using the imacsspectrograph at the magellan telescopes and the vimos spectrograph at the vlt.we measured redshifts for 186 x-ray sources, including archival data and aliterature search. we find that the agn host galaxies have on average redderrest-frame optical colors than non-active galaxies, and that they live mostlyin the "green valley". the dependence of the fraction of agn that are obscuredon both luminosity and redshift is confirmed at high significance and theobserved agn space density is compared with the expectations from existingluminosity functions. these agn show a significant difference in the mid-ir tox-ray flux ratio for obscured and unobscured agn, which can be explained by theeffects of dust self-absorption on the former. this difference is larger forlower luminosity sources, which is consistent with the dust opening angledepending on agn luminosity.
