0902.3025	structure and substructure of galactic spheroids	the full spatio-chemo-dynamical structure of galaxies of all types andenvironments at low redshift provides a critical accompaniment to observationsof galaxy formation at high redshift. the next decade brings the observationalopportunity to strongly constrain nearby galaxies' histories of star formationand assembly, especially in the spheroids that comprise the large majority ofthe stellar mass in the universe but have until now been difficult to study. inorder to constrain the pathways to building up the spheroidal "red-sequence",various standard techniques in photometry and spectroscopy, particularly withresolved tracer populations like globular clusters and planetary nebulae, canbe scaled up to comprehensive surveys as improved wide-field instrumentation isincreasingly available. at the same time, progress in adaptive optics on gianttelescopes could for the first time permit deep, resolved photometric andspectroscopic analysis of large samples of individual stars in these systems,thereby revolutionizing galaxy studies. strong theoretical support is needed inorder to understand the new observational constraints via detailed modeling andself-consistent simulations of star and galaxy formation throughout cosmictime.

0902.3219	strong gravitational lensing probes of the particle nature of dark  matter	there is a vast menagerie of plausible candidates for the constituents ofdark matter, both within and beyond extensions of the standard model ofparticle physics. each of these candidates may have scattering (and other)cross section properties that are consistent with the dark matter abundance,bbn, and the most scales in the matter power spectrum; but which may havevastly different behavior at sub-galactic "cutoff" scales, below which darkmatter density fluctuations are smoothed out. the only way to quantitativelymeasure the power spectrum behavior at sub-galactic scales at distances beyondthe local universe, and indeed over cosmic time, is through probes available inmultiply imaged strong gravitational lenses. gravitational potentialperturbations by dark matter substructure encode information in the observedrelative magnifications, positions, and time delays in a strong lens. each ofthese is sensitive to a different moment of the substructure mass function andto different effective mass ranges of the substructure. the time delayperturbations, in particular, are proving to be largely immune to thedegeneracies and systematic uncertainties that have impacted exploitation ofstrong lenses for such studies. there is great potential for a coordinatedtheoretical and observational effort to enable a sophisticated exploitation ofstrong gravitational lenses as direct probes of dark matter properties. thisopportunity motivates this white paper, and drives the need for: a) strongsupport of the theoretical work necessary to understand all astrophysicalconsequences for different dark matter candidates; and b) tailoredobservational campaigns, and even a fully dedicated mission, to obtain therequisite data.

0905.1144	gev gamma-ray attenuation and the high-redshift uv background	we present new calculations of the evolving uv background out to the epoch ofcosmological reionization and make predictions for the amount of gev gamma-rayattenuation by electron-positron pair production. our results are based onrecent semi-analytic models of galaxy formation, which provide predictions ofthe dust-extinguished uv radiation field due to starlight, and empiricalestimates of the contribution due to quasars. we account for the reprocessingof ionizing photons by the intergalactic medium. we test whether our models canreproduce estimates of the ionizing background at high redshift from fluxdecrement analysis and proximity effect measurements from quasar spectra, andidentify a range of models that can satisfy these constraints. pair-productionagainst soft diffuse photons leads to a spectral cutoff feature for gamma raysobserved between 10 and 100 gev. this cutoff varies with redshift and theassumed star formation and quasar evolution models. we find only negligibleamounts of absorption for gamma rays observed below 10 gev for any emissionredshift. with observations of high-redshift sources in sufficient numbers bythe fermi gamma-ray space telescope and new ground-based instruments it shouldbe possible to constrain the extragalactic background light in the uv andoptical portion of the spectrum.

0908.2830	modeling gamma-ray burst observations by fermi and magic including  attenuation due to diffuse background light	gamma rays from extragalactic sources are attenuated by pair-productioninteractions with diffuse photons of the extragalactic background light (ebl).gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are a source of high-redshift photons above 10 gev, andcould be therefore useful as a probe of the evolving uv background radiation.in this paper, we develop a simple phenomenological model for the number andredshift distribution of gamma-ray bursts that can be seen at gev energies withthe fermi satellite and magic atmospheric cherenkov telescope. we estimate theobserved number of gamma rays per year, and show how this result is modified byconsidering interactions with different realizations of the evolving ebl. wealso discuss the bright fermi grb 080916c in the context of this model. we findthat the lat on fermi can be expected to see a small number of photons above 10gev each year from distant grbs. annual results for ground-based instrumentslike magic are highly variable due to the low duty cycle and sky coverage ofthe telescope. however, successfully viewing a bright or intermediate grb fromthe ground could provide hundreds of photons from high redshift, which wouldalmost certainly be extremely useful in constraining both grb physics and thehigh-redshift ebl.

0912.1590	the effect of mass ratio on the morphology and time-scales of disc  galaxy mergers	the majority of galaxy mergers are expected to be minor mergers. theobservational signatures of minor mergers are not well understood, thus thereexist few constraints on the minor merger rate. this paper seeks to addressthis gap in our understanding by determining if and when minor mergers exhibitdisturbed morphologies and how they differ from the morphology of majormergers. we simulate a series of unequal-mass moderate gas-fraction disc galaxymergers. with the resulting g-band images, we determine how the time-scale foridentifying galaxy mergers via projected separation and quantitative morphology(the gini coefficient g, asymmetry a, and the second-order moment of thebrightest 20% of the light m20) depends on the merger mass ratio, relativeorientations and orbital parameters. we find that g-m20 is as sensitive to 9:1baryonic mass ratio mergers as 1:1 mergers, with observability time-scales ~0.2-0.4 gyr. in contrast, asymmetry finds mergers with baryonic mass ratiosbetween 4:1 and 1:1 (assuming local disc galaxy gas-fractions). asymmetrytime-scales for moderate gas-fraction major disc mergers are ~ 0.2-0.4 gyr, andless than 0.06 gyr for moderate gas-fraction minor mergers. the relativeorientations and orbits have little effect on the time-scales for morphologicaldisturbances. observational studies of close pairs often select major mergersby choosing paired galaxies with similar luminosities and/or stellar masses.therefore, the various ways of finding galaxy mergers (g-m20, a, close pairs)are sensitive to galaxy mergers of different mass ratios. by comparing thefrequency of mergers selected by different techniques, one may place empiricalconstraints on the major and minor galaxy merger rates.

0912.1593	the effect of gas fraction on the morphology and time-scales of disc  galaxy mergers	gas-rich galaxy mergers are more easily identified by their disturbedmorphologies than mergers with less gas. because the typical gas fraction ofgalaxy mergers is expected to increase with redshift, the under-counting of lowgas-fraction mergers may bias morphological estimates of the evolution ofgalaxy merger rate. to understand the magnitude of this bias, we explore theeffect of gas fraction on the morphologies of a series of simulated disc galaxymergers. with the resulting g-band images, we determine how the time-scale foridentifying major and minor galaxy mergers via close projected pairs andquantitative morphology (the gini coefficient g, the second-order moment of thebrightest 20% of the light m20, and asymmetry a) depends on baryonic gasfraction f(gas). strong asymmetries last significantly longer in highgas-fraction mergers of all mass ratios, with time-scales ranging from &gt;= 300myr for f(gas) ~ 20% to &gt;= 1 gyr for f(gas) ~ 50%. therefore the strongevolution with redshift observed in the fraction of asymmetric galaxies mayreflect evolution in the gas properties of galaxies rather than the globalgalaxy merger rate. on the other hand, the time-scale for identifying a galaxymerger via g-m20 is weakly dependent on gas-fraction (~ 200-400 myr),consistent with the weak evolution observed for g-m20 mergers.

1011.6373	statistics of satellite galaxies around milky way-like hosts	we calculate the probability that a milky-way-like halo in the standardcosmological model has the observed number of magellanic clouds (mcs). thestatistics of the number of mcs in the lcdm model are in good agreement withobservations of a large sample of sdss galaxies. under the sub-halo abundancematching assumption of a relationship with small scatter between galaxy r-bandluminosities and halo internal velocities v_max, we make detailed comparisonsto similar measurements using sdss dr7 data by liu et al. (2010). models andobservational data give very similar probabilities for having zero, one, andtwo mc-like satellites. in both cases, milky way-luminosity hosts have just a\sim 10% chance of hosting two satellites similar to the magellanic clouds. inaddition, we present a prediction for the probability for a host galaxy to havensats satellite galaxies as a function of the magnitudes of both the host andsatellite. this probability and its scaling with host properties issignificantly different from that of mass-selected objects because of scatterin the mass- luminosity relation and because of variations in the starformation efficiency with halo mass.

1103.2130	absorption line systems in simulated galaxies fed by cold streams	hydro cosmological simulations reveal that massive galaxies at high redshiftare fed by long narrow streams of merging galaxies and a smoother component ofcold gas. we post-process seven high-resolution simulated galaxies withradiative transfer to study the absorption characteristics of the gas ingalaxies and streams, in comparison with the statistics of observedabsorption-line systems. we find that much of the stream gas is ionized by uvradiation from background and local stellar sources, but still optically thick(n_hi &gt; 10^17 cm^-2) so that the streams appear as lyman-limit systems (llss).at z&gt;3, the fraction of neutral gas in streams becomes non-negligible, givingrise to damped lyman-alpha (dla) absorbers as well. the gas in the central andincoming galaxies remains mostly neutral, responsible for dlas. within one(two) virial radii, the covering factor of optically thick gas is &lt;25% (10%)for llss and &lt;5% (1%) for dlas, slowly declining with time following theuniversal expansion. nevertheless, galaxies and their cold streams in thestudied mass range, m_vir = 10^10 - 10^12 msun, account for &gt;30% of theobserved absorbers in the foreground of quasars, the rest possibly arising fromsmaller galaxies or the intergalactic medium. the mean metallicity in thestreams is ~1% solar, much lower than in the galaxies. the simulated galaxiesreproduce the lyalpha-absorption equivalent widths observed around lyman-breakgalaxies, but they severely underpredict the equivalent widths in metal lines,suggesting that the latter may arise from outflows. we conclude that theobserved metal-poor llss are likely detections of the predicted cold streams.revised analysis of the observed llss kinematics and simulations with moremassive outflows in conjunction with the inflows may enable a clearerdistinction between the signatures of the various gas modes.

0709.3511	the effect of galaxy mass ratio on merger--driven starbursts	we employ numerical simulations of galaxy mergers to explore the effect ofgalaxy mass ratio on merger--driven starbursts. our numerical simulationsinclude radiative cooling of gas, star formation, and stellar feedback tofollow the interaction and merger of four disk galaxies. the galaxy models spana factor of 23 in total mass and are designed to be representative of typicalgalaxies in the local universe. we find that the merger--driven star formationis a strong function of merger mass ratio, with very little, if any, inducedstar formation for large mass ratio mergers. we define a burst efficiency thatis useful to characterize the merger--driven star formation and test that it isinsensitive to uncertainties in the feedback parameterization. in accord withprevious work we find that the burst efficiency depends on the structure of theprimary galaxy. in particular, the presence of a massive stellar bulgestabilizes the disk and suppresses merger--driven star formation for large massratio mergers. direct, co--planar merging orbits produce the largest tidaldisturbance and yield that most intense burst of star formation. contrary tonaive expectations, a more compact distribution of gas or an increased gasfraction both decrease the burst efficiency. owing to the efficient feedbackmodel and the newer version of sph employed here, the burst efficiencies of themergers presented here are smaller than in previous studies.

1107.2566	extragalactic background light and gamma-ray attenuation	data from (non-) attenuation of gamma rays from active galactic nuclei (agn)and gamma ray bursts (grbs) give upper limits on the extragalactic backgroundlight (ebl) from the uv to the mid-ir that are only a little above the lowerlimits from observed galaxies. these upper limits now rule out some ebl modelsand purported observations, with improved data likely to provide even strongerconstraints. we present ebl calculations both based on multiwavelengthobservations of thousands of galaxies and also based on semi-analytic models,and show that they are consistent with these lower limits from observedgalaxies and with the gamma-ray upper limit constraints. such comparisons"close the loop" on cosmological galaxy formation models, since they accountfor all the light, including that from galaxies too faint to see. we compareour results with those of other recent works, and discuss the implications ofthese new ebl calculations for gamma ray attenuation. catching a few grbs withgroundbased atmospheric cherenkov telescope (act) arrays or water cherenkovdetectors could provide important new constraints on the high-redshift starformation history of the universe.

1108.2508	the major and minor galaxy merger rates at z &lt; 1.5	calculating the galaxy merger rate requires both a census of galaxiesidentified as merger candidates, and a cosmologically-averaged `observability'timescale t_obs(z) for identifying galaxy mergers. while many have countedgalaxy mergers using a variety of techniques, t_obs(z) for these techniqueshave been poorly constrained. we address this problem by calibrating threemerger rate estimators with a suite of hydrodynamic merger simulations andthree galaxy formation models. we estimate t_obs(z) for (1) close galaxy pairswith a range of projected separations, (2) the morphology indicator g-m20, and(3) the morphology indicator asymmetry a. then we apply these timescales to theobserved merger fractions at z &lt; 1.5 from the recent literature. when ourphysically-motivated timescales are adopted, the observed galaxy merger ratesbecome largely consistent. the remaining differences between the galaxy mergerrates are explained by the differences in the range of mass-ratio measured bydifferent techniques and differing parent galaxy selection. the major mergerrate per unit co-moving volume for samples selected with constant numberdensity evolves much more strongly with redshift (~ (1+z)^(+3.0 \pm 1.1)) thansamples selected with constant stellar mass or passively evolving luminosity (~(1+z)^(+0.1 \pm 0.4)). we calculate the minor merger rate (1:4 &lt;m_{sat}/m_{primary} &lt;~ 1:10) by subtracting the major merger rate from closepairs from the `total' merger rate determined by g-m20. the implied minormerger rate is ~3 times the major merger rate at z ~ 0.7, and shows littleevolution with redshift.

1201.0010	iact observations of gamma-ray bursts: prospects for the cherenkov  telescope array	gamma rays at rest frame energies as high as 90 gev have been reported fromgamma-ray bursts (grbs) by the fermi large area telescope (lat). there isconsiderable hope that a confirmed grb detection will be possible with theupcoming cherenkov telescope array (cta), which will have a larger effectivearea and better low-energy sensitivity than current-generation imagingatmospheric cherenkov telescopes (iacts). to estimate the likelihood of such adetection, we have developed a phenomenological model for grb emission between1 gev and 1 tev that is motivated by the high-energy grb detections offermi-lat, and allows us to extrapolate the statistics of grbs seen by lowerenergy instruments such as the swift-bat and batse on the compton gamma-rayobservatory. we show a number of statistics for detected grbs, and describe howthe detectability of grbs with cta could vary based on a number of parameters,such as the typical observation delay between the burst onset and the start ofground observations. we also consider the possibility of using gbm on fermi asa finder of grbs for rapid ground follow-up. while the uncertainty of gbmlocalization is problematic, the small field-of-view for iacts can potentiallybe overcome by scanning over the gbm error region. overall, our resultsindicate that cta should be able to detect one grb every 20 to 30 months withour baseline instrument model, assuming consistently rapid pursuit of grbalerts, and provided that spectral breaks below 100 gev are not a commonfeature of the bright grb population. with a more optimistic instrument model,the detection rate can be as high as 1 to 2 grbs per year.

1205.0253	the radius of baryonic collapse in disc galaxy formation	in the standard picture of disc galaxy formation, baryons and dark matterreceive the same tidal torques, and therefore approximately the same initialspecific angular momentum. however, observations indicate that disc galaxiestypically have only about half as much specific angular momentum as their darkmatter haloes. we argue this does not necessarily imply that baryons lose thismuch specific angular momentum as they form galaxies. it may instead indicatethat galaxies are most directly related to the inner regions of their hosthaloes, as may be expected in a scenario where baryons in the inner parts ofhaloes collapse first. a limiting case is examined under the idealisedassumption of perfect angular momentum conservation. namely, we determine thedensity contrast delta, with respect to the critical density of the universe,by which dark matter haloes need to be defined in order to have the sameaverage specific angular momentum as the galaxies they host. under theassumption that galaxies are related to haloes via their characteristicrotation velocities, the necessary delta is ~600. this delta corresponds to anaverage halo radius and mass which are ~60% and ~75%, respectively, of thevirial values (i.e., for delta = 200). we refer to this radius as the radius ofbaryonic collapse r_bc, since if specific angular momentum is conservedperfectly, baryons would come from within it. it is not likely a simple stepfunction due to the complex gastrophysics involved, therefore we regard it asan effective radius. in summary, the difference between the predicted initialand the observed final specific angular momentum of galaxies, which isconventionally attributed solely to angular momentum loss, can more naturallybe explained by a preference for collapse of baryons within r_bc, with possiblysome later angular momentum transfer.

1205.2533	on galaxies and homology	the definition of homology for single-component galaxies is clear, but formulti-component (luminous and dark matter) galaxies there is some ambiguity. weattempt to clarify the situation by carefully separating the different conceptsof homology that have been used to date. we argue that the most usefuldefinition is that a set of galaxies is homologous if they are the same in allrespects up to a set of three dimensional scaling constants which may differfrom one galaxy to the next. noting that we are free to choose the dimensionalconstants, we find that a set of hydrodynamic simulated galaxy merger remnantsis significantly closer to homologous when the dimensional length constant istaken to be the radius containing equal amounts of dark and baryonic matterrather than the usual observationally motivated choice of the baryonichalf-mass radius. once the correct dimensional scaling constants are used, thestellar velocity dispersion anisotropy is essentially the sole source of thevariation in the kinematic structure of these simulated merger remnants. inorder to facilitate the use of these scaling constants to analyse observedgalaxies, we calculated the relationship between our preferred dimensionalscaling constants and the typical observationally accessible quantities.

1206.5000	candels: the progenitors of compact quiescent galaxies at z~2	we combine high-resolution hst/wfc3 images with multi-wavelength photometryto track the evolution of structure and activity of massive (log(m*) &gt; 10)galaxies at redshifts z = 1.4 - 3 in two fields of the cosmic assemblynear-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey (candels). we detect compact,star-forming galaxies (csfgs) whose number densities, masses, sizes, and starformation rates qualify them as likely progenitors of compact, quiescent,massive galaxies (cqgs) at z = 1.5 - 3. at z &gt; 2 most csfgs have specificstar-formation rates (ssfr = 10^-9 yr^-1) half that of typical, massive sfgs atthe same epoch, and host x-ray luminous agn 30 times (~30%) more frequently.these properties suggest that csfgs are formed by gas-rich processes (mergersor disk-instabilities) that induce a compact starburst and feed an agn, which,in turn, quench the star formation on dynamical timescales (few 10^8 yr). thecsfgs are continuously being formed at z = 2 - 3 and fade to cqgs by z = 1.5.after this epoch, csfgs are rare, thereby truncating the formation of new cqgs.meanwhile, down to z = 1, existing cqgs continue to enlarge to match local qgsin size, while less-gas-rich mergers and other secular mechanisms shepherd(larger) sfgs as later arrivals to the red sequence. in summary, we propose twoevolutionary scenarios of qg formation: an early (z &gt; 2), fast-formation pathof rapidly-quenched csfgs that evolve into cqgs that later enlarge within thequiescent phase, and a slow, late-arrival (z &lt; 2) path for sfgs to form qgswithout passing through a compact state.

1308.2669	the agora high-resolution galaxy simulations comparison project	we introduce the agora project, a comprehensive numerical study ofwell-resolved galaxies within the lcdm cosmology. cosmological hydrodynamicsimulations with force resolutions of ~100 proper pc or better will be run witha variety of code platforms to follow the hierarchical growth, star formationhistory, morphological transformation, and the cycle of baryons in and out of 8galaxies with halo masses m_vir ~= 1e10, 1e11, 1e12, and 1e13 msun at z=0 andtwo different ("violent" and "quiescent") assembly histories. the numericaltechniques and implementations used in this project include the smoothedparticle hydrodynamics codes gadget and gasoline, and the adaptive meshrefinement codes art, enzo, and ramses. the codes will share common initialconditions and common astrophysics packages including uv background,metal-dependent radiative cooling, metal and energy yields of supernovae, andstellar initial mass function. these are described in detail in the presentpaper. subgrid star formation and feedback prescriptions will be tuned toprovide a realistic interstellar and circumgalactic medium using anon-cosmological disk galaxy simulation. cosmological runs will besystematically compared with each other using a common analysis toolkit, andvalidated against observations to verify that the solutions are robust - i.e.,that the astrophysical assumptions are responsible for any success, rather thanartifacts of particular implementations. the goals of the agora project are,broadly speaking, to raise the realism and predictive power of galaxysimulations and the understanding of the feedback processes that regulategalaxy "metabolism." the proof-of-concept dark matter-only test of theformation of a galactic halo with a z=0 mass of m_vir ~= 1.7e11 msun by 9different versions of the participating codes is also presented to validate theinfrastructure of the project.

1310.2239	mergers and mass accretion for infalling halos both end well outside  cluster virial radii	we find that infalling dark matter halos (i.e., the progenitors of satellitehalos) begin losing mass well outside the virial radius of their eventual hosthalos. the peak mass occurs at a range of clustercentric distances, with medianand 68th percentile range of 1.8 +2.3/-1.0 r_(vir,host) for progenitors of z=0satellites. the peak circular velocity for infalling halos occurs atsignificantly larger distances (3.7 +3.3/-2.2 r_(vir,host) at z=0). thisdifference arises because different physical processes set peak circularvelocity (typically, ~1:5 and larger mergers which cause transient circularvelocity spikes) and peak mass (typically, smooth accretion) for infallinghalos. we find that infalling halos also stop having significant mergers wellbefore they enter the virial radius of their eventual hosts. mergers largerthan a 1:40 ratio in halo mass end for infalling halos at similarclustercentric distances (~ 1.9 r_(vir,host)) as the end of overall massaccretion. however, mergers larger than 1:3 typically end for infalling halosat more than 4 virial radial away from their eventual hosts. this limits theability of mergers to affect quenching and morphology changes in clusters. wealso note that the transient spikes which set peak circular velocity may leadto issues with abundance matching on that parameter, including unphysicalgalaxy stellar mass growth profiles near clusters; we propose a simpleobservational test to check if a better halo proxy for galaxy stellar massexists.

1402.0866	bulge growth and quenching since z = 2.5 in candels/3d-hst	exploiting the deep high-resolution imaging of all 5 candels fields, andaccurate redshift information provided by 3d-hst, we investigate the relationbetween structure and stellar populations for a mass-selected sample of 6764galaxies above 10^10 msun, spanning the redshift range 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5. for thefirst time, we fit 2-dimensional models comprising a single sersic fit andtwo-component (i.e., bulge + disk) decompositions not only to the h-band lightdistributions, but also to the stellar mass maps reconstructed from resolvedstellar population modeling. we confirm that the increased bulge prominenceamong quiescent galaxies, as reported previously based on rest-opticalobservations, remains in place when considering the distributions of stellarmass. moreover, we observe an increase of the typical sersic index andbulge-to-total ratio (with median b/t reaching 40-50%) among star-forminggalaxies above 10^11 msun. given that quenching for these most massive systemsis likely to be imminent, our findings suggest that significant bulge growthprecedes a departure from the star-forming main sequence. we demonstrate thatthe bulge mass (and ideally knowledge of the bulge and total mass) is a morereliable predictor of the star-forming versus quiescent state of a galaxy thanthe total stellar mass. the same trends are predicted by the state-of-the-artsemi-analytic model by somerville et al. in the latter, bulges and black holesgrow hand in hand through merging and/or disk instabilities, and agn-feedbackshuts off star formation. further observations will be required to pin downstar formation quenching mechanisms, but our results imply they must beinternal to the galaxies and closely associated with bulge growth.

1407.0594	understanding the structural scaling relations of early-type galaxies	we use a large suite of hydrodynamical simulations of binary galaxy mergersto construct and calibrate a physical prescription for computing the effectiveradii and velocity dispersions of spheroids. we implement this prescriptionwithin a semi-analytic model embedded in merger trees extracted from thebolshoi lambda-cdm n-body simulation, accounting for spheroid growth via majorand minor mergers as well as disk instabilities. we find that without diskinstabilities, our model does not predict sufficient numbers of intermediatemass early-type galaxies in the local universe. spheroids also form earlier inmodels with spheroid growth via disk instabilities. our model correctlypredicts the normalization, slope, and scatter of the low-redshift size-massand fundamental plane relations for early type galaxies. it predicts a degreeof curvature in the faber-jackson relation that is not seen in localobservations, but this could be alleviated if higher mass spheroids have morebottom-heavy initial mass functions. the model also correctly predicts theobserved strong evolution of the size-mass relation for spheroids out to higherredshifts, as well as the slower evolution in the normalization of thefaber-jackson relation. we emphasize that these are genuine predictions of themodel since it was tuned to match hydrodynamical simulations and not theseobservations.

1407.4812	simulating multiple merger pathways to the central kinematics of  early-type galaxies	two-dimensional integral field surveys such as atlas^3d are producing richobservational data sets yielding insights into galaxy formation. these newkinematic observations have highlighted the need to understand the evolutionarymechanisms leading to a spectrum of fast-rotators and slow-rotators inearly-type galaxies. we address the formation of slow and fast rotators througha series of controlled, comprehensive hydrodynamical simulations samplingidealized galaxy merger scenarios constructed from model spiral galaxies.idealized and controlled simulations of this sort complement the more'realistic' cosmological simulations by isolating and analyzing the effects ofspecific parameters, as we do in this paper. we recreate minor and major binarymergers, binary merger trees with multiple progenitors, and multiple sequentialmergers. within each of these categories of formation history, we correlateprogenitor gas fraction, mass ratio, orbital pericenter, orbital ellipticity,and spin with remnant kinematic properties. we create kinematic profiles ofthese 95 simulations comparable to atlas^3d data. by constructing remnantprofiles of the projected specific angular momentum (lambda_r = &lt;r|v|&gt; /&lt;sqrt(v^2+sigma^2)&gt;, triaxiality, and measuring the incidences of kinematictwists and kinematically decoupled cores, we distinguish between varyingformation scenarios. we find that binary mergers nearly always form fastrotators. slow rotators can be formed from zero initial angular momentumconfigurations and gas-poor mergers, but are not as round as the atlas^3dgalaxies. remnants of binary merger trees are triaxial slow rotators.sequential mergers form round slow rotators that most resemble the atlas^3drotators.

1410.7398	clumpy galaxies in candels. i. the definition of uv clumps and the  fraction of clumpy galaxies at 0.5&lt;z&lt;3	although giant clumps of stars are crucial to galaxy formation and evolution,the most basic demographics of clumps are still uncertain, mainly because thedefinition of clumps has not been thoroughly discussed. in this paper, we studythe basic demographics of clumps in star-forming galaxies (sfgs) at 0.5&lt;z&lt;3,using our proposed physical definition that uv-bright clumps are discretestar-forming regions that individually contribute more than 8% of therest-frame uv light of their galaxies. clumps defined this way aresignificantly brighter than the hii regions of nearby large spiral galaxies,either individually or blended, when physical spatial resolution andcosmological dimming are considered. under this definition, we measure thefraction of sfgs that contain at least one off-center clump (fclumpy) and thecontributions of clumps to the rest-frame uv light and star formation rate ofsfgs in the candels/goods-s and uds fields, where our mass-complete sampleconsists of 3239 galaxies with axial ratio q&gt;0.5. the redshift evolution offclumpy changes with the stellar mass (m*) of the galaxies. low-mass(log(m*/msun)&lt;9.8) galaxies keep an almost constant fclumpy of about 60% fromz~3.0 to z~0.5. intermediate-mass and massive galaxies drop their fclumpy from55% at z~3.0 to 40% and 15%, respectively, at z~0.5. we find that (1) the trendof disk stabilization predicted by violent disk instability matches the fclumpytrend of massive galaxies; (2) minor mergers are a viable explanation of thefclumpy trend of intermediate-mass galaxies at z&lt;1.5, given a realisticobservability timescale; and (3) major mergers are unlikely responsible for thefclumpy trend in all masses at z&lt;1.5. the clump contribution to the rest-frameuv light of sfgs shows a broad peak around galaxies with log(m*/msun)~10.5 atall redshifts, possibly linked to the molecular gas fraction of the galaxies.(abridged)

1505.02821	cosmological structure formation	lcdm is remarkably successful in predicting the cosmic microwave backgroundand large-scale structure, and lcdm parameters have been determined with onlymild tensions between different types of observations. hydrodynamicalsimulations starting from cosmological initial conditions are increasingly ableto capture the complex interactions between dark matter and baryonic matter ingalaxy formation. simulations with relatively low resolution now succeed indescribing the overall galaxy population. for example, the eagle simulation involumes up to 100 cubic mpc reproduces the observed local galaxy mass functionnearly as well as semi-analytic models. it once seemed that galaxies are prettysmooth, that they generally grow in size as they evolve, and that they are acombination of disks and spheroids. but recent hst observations combined withhigh-resolution hydrodynamic simulations are showing that most star-forminggalaxies are very clumpy; that galaxies often undergo compaction which reducestheir radius and increases their central density; and that most lower-massstar-forming galaxies are not spheroids or disks but are instead elongated whentheir centers are dominated by dark matter. we also review lcdm challenges onsmaller scales: cusp-core, "too big to fail," and substructure issues. althoughstarbursts can rapidly drive gas out of galaxy centers and thereby reduce thedark matter density, it remains to be seen whether this or other baryonicphysics can explain the observed rotation curves of the entire population ofdwarf and low surface brightness galaxies. if not, perhaps more complicatedphysics such as self-interacting dark matter may be needed. but standard lcdmappears to be successful in predicting the dark matter halo substructure thatis now observed via gravitational lensing and breaks in cold stellar streams,and any alternative theory must do at least as well.

0805.1246	galaxy merger morphologies and time-scales from simulations of  equal-mass gas-rich disc mergers	a key obstacle to understanding the galaxy merger rate and its role in galaxyevolution is the difficulty in constraining the merger properties andtime-scales from instantaneous snapshots of the real universe.the most commonway to identify galaxy mergers is by morphology, yet current theoreticalcalculations of the time-scales for galaxy disturbances are quite crude. wepresent a morphological analysis of a large suite of gadgetn-body/hydro-dynamical equal-mass gas-rich disc galaxy mergers which have beenprocessed through the monte-carlo radiative transfer code sunrise. with theresulting images, we examine the dependence of quantitative morphology (g, m20,c, a) in the sdss g-band on merger stage, dust, viewing angle, orbitalparameters, gas properties, supernova feedback, and total mass. we find thatmergers appear most disturbed in g-m20 and asymmetry at the first pass and atthe final coalescence of their nuclei, but can have normal quantitativemorphologies at other merger stages. the merger observability time-scalesdepend on the method used to identify the merger as well as the gas fraction,pericentric distance, and relative orientation of the merging galaxies.enhanced star formation peaks after and lasts significantly longer than strongmorphological disturbances. despite their massive bulges, the majority ofmerger remnants appear disc-like and dusty in g-band light because of thepresence of a low-mass star-forming disc.

1508.04842	is main sequence galaxy star formation controlled by halo mass  accretion?	the galaxy stellar-to-halo mass relation (shmr) is nearly time-independentfor $z &lt; 4$. we therefore construct a time-independent shmr model for centralgalaxies, wherein the in-situ star formation rate (sfr) is determined by thehalo mass accretion rate (mar), which we call stellar-halo accretion ratecoevolution (sharc). we show that the $\sim0.3$ dex dispersion of the halo marmatches the observed dispersion of the sfr on the star-formation main sequence(ms). in the context of "bathtub"-type models of galaxy formation, sharc leadsto mass-dependent constraints on the relation between sfr and mar. despite itssimplicity and the simplified treatment of mass growth from mergers, the sharcmodel is likely to be a good approximation for central galaxies with $m_*=10^9-10^{10.5}m_\odot$ that are on the ms, representing most of the star formationin the universe. sharc predictions agree with observed sfrs for galaxies on thems at low redshifts, agree fairly well at $z\sim4$, but exceed observations at$z&gt;4$. assuming that the interstellar gas mass is constant for each galaxy (the"equilibrium condition" in bathtub models), the sharc model allows calculationof net mass loading factors for inflowing and outflowing gas. with assumptionsabout preventive feedback based on simulations, sharc allows calculation ofgalaxy metallicity evolution. if galaxy sfrs indeed track halo mars, especiallyat low redshifts, that may help explain the success of models linking galaxyproperties to halos (including age-matching) and the similarities betweentwo-halo galaxy conformity and halo mass accretion conformity.

1511.02862	satellite quenching and galactic conformity at 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 2.5	we measure the evolution of the quiescent fraction and quenching efficiencyof satellites around star-forming and quiescent central galaxies with stellarmass $\log(m_{\mathrm{cen}}/m_{\odot})&gt;10.5$ at $0.3&lt;z&lt;2.5$. we combine imagingfrom three deep near-infrared-selected surveys (zfourge/candels, uds, andultravista), which allows us to select a stellar-mass complete sample ofsatellites with $\log(m_{\mathrm{sat}}/m_{\odot})&gt;9.3$. satellites for bothstar-forming and quiescent central galaxies have higher quiescent fractionscompared to field galaxies matched in stellar mass at all redshifts. we alsoobserve "galactic conformity": satellites around quiescent centrals are morelikely to be quenched compared to the satellites around star-forming centrals.in our sample, this conformity signal is significant at $\gtrsim3\sigma$ for$0.6&lt;z&lt;1.6$, whereas it is only weakly significant at $0.3&lt;z&lt;0.6$ and$1.6&lt;z&lt;2.5$. therefore, conformity (and therefore satellite quenching) has beenpresent for a significant fraction of the age of the universe. the satellitequenching efficiency increases with increasing stellar mass of the central, butdoes not appear to depend on the stellar mass of the satellite to the masslimit of our sample. when we compare the satellite quenching efficiency ofstar-forming centrals with stellar masses 0.2 dex higher than quiescentcentrals (which should account for any difference in halo mass), the conformitysignal decreases, but remains statistically significant at $0.6&lt;z&lt;0.9$. this isevidence that satellite quenching is connected to the star-formation propertiesof the central as well as to the mass of the halo. we discuss physical effectsthat may contribute to galactic conformity, and emphasize that they must allowfor continued star-formation in the central galaxy even as the satellites arequenched.

astro-ph;0002449	what damped ly-alpha systems tell us about the radial distribution of  cold gas at high redshift	we investigate the properties of damped lyman-alpha systems (dlas) insemi-analytic models, focusing on whether the models can reproduce thekinematic properties of low-ionization metal lines described by prochaska &amp;wolfe (1997b, 1998). we explore a variety of approaches for modelling theradial distribution of the cold neutral gas associated with the galaxies in ourmodels, and find that our results are very sensitive to this ingredient. if weuse an approach based on fall &amp; efstathiou (1980), in which the sizes of thediscs are determined by conservation of angular momentum, we find that themajority of the dlas correspond to a single galactic disc. these modelsgenerically fail to reproduce the observed distribution of velocity widths. inalternative models in which the gas discs are considerably more extended, asignificant fraction of dlas arise from lines of sight intersecting multiplegas discs in a common halo. these models produce kinematics that fit theobservational data, and also seem to agree well with the results of recenthydrodynamical simulations. thus we conclude that cold dark matter based modelsof galaxy formation can be reconciled with the kinematic data, but only at theexpense of the standard assumption that dlas are produced by rotationallysupported gas discs whose sizes are determined by conservation of angularmomentum. we suggest that the distribution of cold gas at high redshift may bedominated by another process, such as tidal streaming due to mergers.

astro-ph;0005323	velocity and mass functions of galactic halos: evolution and  environmental dependence	we study the distribution functions of mass and circular velocity for darkmatter halos in n-body simulations of the $\lambda$cdm cosmology, addressingredshift and environmental dependence. the dynamical range enables us toresolve subhalos and distinguish them from "distinct" halos. the mass functionis compared to analytic models, and is used to derive the more observationallyrelevant circular velocity function. the distribution functions in the velocityrange 100--500 km/s are well fit by a power-law with two parameters, slope andamplitude. we present the parameter dependence on redshift and provide usefulfitting formulae. the amplitudes of the mass functions decrease with z, but,contrary to naive expectation, the comoving density of halos of a fixedvelocity ~200 km/s actually increases out to z=5. this is because high-z halosare denser, so a fixed velocity corresponds to a smaller mass. the slope of thevelocity function at z=0 is as steep as ~ -4, and the mass and velocityfunctions of distinct halos steepen with increasing z, while the functions ofsubhalos do not steepen with $z$, and become even flatter at z&gt;2. a simpleobservable prediction is that the slope of the velocity function of isolatedgalaxies is steeper than that of galaxies in groups by as much as unity,reflecting the density biasing of high-velocity halos. we confirm that thepress-schechter approximation typically overestimates the halo mass function bya factor of ~2, while modified approximations provide improved predictions.

astro-ph;0010222	interaction rates of dark-matter halos and subhalos	[abridged] the interaction rates of dark-matter halos and subhalos, arecomputed using high-resolution cosmological n-body simulations of thelambda-cdm model. although the number fraction of subhalos of mass$&gt;2x10^{11}\hsolmass$ is only ~10%, we find that the interaction rate of suchsubhalos is relatively high because they reside in high density environments.at low redshift, the subhalo collisions dominate the total collision rate, andeven at z=3 they are involved in more than 30% of all collisions. about 40% ofthe "major" mergers are between subhalos. therefore subhalo interactions mustbe incorporated in models of structure formation. we find that the collisionrate between halos in physical density units, is $\propto (1+z)^\delta $, with$\delta = 3-4$, in agreement with earlier simulations and most observationaldata. we test previous analytic estimates of the interaction rates of subhalosbased on statistical models, which could be very inaccurate because of thesmall number of subhalos and the variation of conditions within small hosthalos. we find that, while such statistical estimates may severely overestimatethe rate within hosts $&lt; 10^{13} \hsolmass$, typical of high redshifts, theyare valid for larger hosts regardless of the number of subhalos in them. wefind the makino &amp; hut (1997) estimate of the subhalo merger rate to be validfor hosts $ &gt; 6x10^{11}\hsolmass$ at all redshifts. the collision rate betweensubhalos and the central object of their host halo is approximated relativelywell using the timescale for dynamical friction in circular orbits. thisapproximation fails in ~40% of the cases, partly because of deviations from theassumption of circular orbits and partly because of the invalidity of theassumption that the subhalo mass is negligible.

astro-ph;0010223	origin and destiny of dark matter halos: cosmological matter exchange  and metal enrichment	[abridged] we analyze the exchange of dark matter between halos, subhalos,and their environments in a high-resolution cosmological n-body simulation of alambda cdm cosmology. at each analyzed redshift z we divide the dark matterparticles into 4 components: (i) isolated galactic halos, (ii) subhalos, (iii)the diffuse medium of group and cluster halos, and (iv) the background outsideof virialized halos. we follow the time evolution of the mass distribution andflows between these components and provide fitting functions for the exchangerates. we use our derived exchange rates to gauge the importance of metalredistribution in the universe due solely to gravity-induced interactions. thediffuse metallicity in clusters is predicted to be ~40% that in isolatedgalaxies (~55% of groups) at z=0, and should be lower only slightly by z=1,consistent with observations. the metallicity of the diffuse media in poorgroups is expected to be lower by a factor of 5 by z~2, in agreement with theobserved metallicity of damped ly$\alpha$ systems. the metallicity of thebackground igm is predicted to be (1-3)x10^{-4} that of z=0 clusters, alsoconsistent with observations. the agreement of predicted and observed trendsindicates that gravitational interaction alone may play an important role inmetal enrichment of the intra-cluster and intergalactic media.

astro-ph;0010248	evolution of mass distribution in cdm halos	on the basis of a new convergence study of high-resolution n-bodysimulations, my colleagues and i now agree that the navarro, frenk, &amp; white(1996) density profile $\rho_{nfw}(r) \propto r^{-1} (r+r_s)^{-2}$ is a goodrepresentation of typical dark matter halos of galactic mass. comparingsimulations of the same halo with numbers of particles ranging from $\sim10^3$to $\sim10^6$, we have also shown that $r_s$, the radius where the log-slope is-2, can be determined accurately for halos with as few as $\sim10^3$ particles.based on a study of thousands of halos at many redshifts in an adaptiverefinement tree (art) simulation of a cosmological volume in a $\lambda$cdmcosmology, we have found that the concentration $\cvir \equiv \rvir/\rs$ has alog-normal distribution, with $1\sigma$ $\delta (\log \cvir) = 0.18$ at a givenmass, corresponding to a scatter in maximum rotation velocities of $\delta\vmax/\vmax = 0.12$. the average concentration declines with redshift at fixedmass as $\cvir(z) \propto (1+z)^{-1}$. this may have important implications forgalaxy rotation curves. finally, we have found that the velocity functiondetermined from galaxy luminosity functions plus luminosity-velocity relationsagrees with the predictions from our $\lambda$cdm simulations. but we also notethat the very limited evolution with redshift of the velocity functionpredicted by $\lambda$cdm conflicts with the data that is becoming available onthe number density of bright galaxies unless there is significant evolution ofthe luminosity-velocity relation at $z&gt;1$.

astro-ph;0011001	a universal angular momentum profile for galactic halos	[abridged] we study the angular-momentum profiles of a statistical sample ofhalos drawn from a high-resolution n-body simulation of the lcdm cosmology. wefind that the cumulative mass distribution of specific angular momentum, j, ina halo of mass mv is well fit by a universal function, m(&lt;j) = mv \muj/(j_0+j). this profile is defined by one shape parameter (\mu or j_0) inaddition to the global spin parameter \lambda. it follows a power-law over mostof the mass, and flattens at large j, with the flattening more pronounced forsmall values of \mu. compared to a uniform sphere in solid-body rotation, mosthalos have a higher fraction of their mass in the low- and high-j tails of thedistribution. the spatial distribution of angular momentum in halos tends to becylindrical and is well-aligned within each halo for ~80% of the halos. weinvestigate two ideas for the origin of this profile. the first is based on arevised version of linear tidal-torque theory combined with extendedpress-schechter mass accretion, and the second focuses on j transport in minormergers. finally, we briefly explore implications of the m(&lt;j) profile on theformation of galactic disks assuming that j is conserved during an adiabaticbaryonic infall. the implied gas density profile deviates from an exponentialdisk, with a higher density at small radii and a tail extending to large radii.the steep central density profiles may imply disk scale lengths that aresmaller than observed. this is reminiscent of the "angular-momentum problem"seen in hydrodynamic simulations, even though we have assumed perfect jconservation. a possible solution is to associate the central excesses withbulge components and the outer regions with extended gaseous disks.

astro-ph;0011261	galaxy formation at z~3: constraints from spatial clustering	we use n-body simulations combined with semi-analytic models to compute theclustering properties of modeled galaxies at z~3, and confront thesepredictions with the clustering properties of the observed population oflyman-break galaxies (lbgs). several scenarios for the nature of lbgs areexplored, which may be broadly categorized into models in which high-redshiftstar formation is driven by collisional starbursts and those in which quiescentstar formation dominates. for each model, we make predictions for the lbgoverdensity distribution, the variance of counts-in-cells, the correlationlength, and close pair statistics. models which assume a one-to-onerelationship between massive dark-matter halos and galaxies are disfavored byclose pair statistics, as are models in which colliding halos are associatedwith galaxies in a simplified way. however, when modeling of gas consumptionand star formation is included using a semi-analytic treatment, the quiescentand collisional starburst models predict similar clustering properties and noneof these models can be ruled out based on the available clustering data. noneof the ``realistic'' models predict a strong dependence of clustering amplitudeon the luminosity threshold of the sample, in apparent conflict with someobservational results.

astro-ph;0108151	concentrations of dark halos from their assembly histories	(abridged) we study the relation between the density profiles of dark matterhalos and their mass assembly histories, using a statistical sample of halos ina high-resolution n-body simulation of the lcdm cosmology. for each halo atz=0, we identify its merger-history tree, and determine concentrationparameters c_vir for all progenitors, thus providing a structural merger treefor each halo. we fit the mass accretion histories by a universal function withone parameter, the formation epoch a_c, defined when the log mass accretionrate dlogm/dloga falls below a critical value s. we find that late forminggalaxies tend to be less concentrated, such that c_vir ``observed'' at anyepoch a_o is strongly correlated with a_c via c_vir=c_1*a_o/a_c. scatter aboutthis relation is mostly due to measurement errors in c_v and a_c, implying thatthe actual spread in c_vir for halos of a given mass can be mostly attributedto scatter in a_c. we demonstrate that this relation can also be used topredict the mass and redshift dependence of c_v, and the scatter about themedian c_vir(m,z), using accretion histories derived from the extendedpress-schechter (eps) formalism, after adjusting for a constant offset betweenthe formation times as predicted by eps and as measured in the simulations;thisnew ingredient can thus be easily incorporated into semi-analytic models ofgalaxy formation. the correlation found between halo concentration and massaccretion rate suggests a physical interpretation: for high mass infall ratesthe central density is related to the background density; when the mass infallrate slows, the central density stays approximately constant and the haloconcentration just grows as r_vir. the tight correlation demonstrated hereprovides an essential new ingredient for galaxy formation modeling.

astro-ph;0112504	the masses of lyman break galaxies	data on galaxies at high redshift, identified by the lyman-break photometrictechnique, can teach us about how galaxies form and evolve. the stellar massesand other properties of such lyman break galaxies (lbgs) depend sensitively onthe details of star formation. in this paper we consider three different starformation prescriptions, and use semi-analytic methods applied to thenow-standard $\lambda$cdm theory of hierarchical structure formation to showhow these assumptions about star formation affect the predicted masses of thestars in these galaxies and the masses of the dark matter halos that host them.we find that, within the rather large uncertainties, recent estimates of thestellar masses of lbgs from multi-color photometry are consistent with thepredictions of all three models. however, the estimated stellar masses are moreconsistent with the predictions of two of the models in which star formation isaccelerated at high redshifts $z\gsim3$, and of these models the one in whichmany of the lbgs are merger-driven starbursts is also more consistent withindications that many high redshift galaxies are gas rich. the clusteringproperties of lbgs have put some constraints on the masses of their host halos,but due to similarities in the halo occupation of the three models we considerand degeneracies between model parameters, current constraints are not yetsufficient to distinguish between realistic models.

astro-ph;0211231	damped lyman alpha systems and galaxy formation models - ii. high ions  and lyman limit systems	we investigate a model for the high-ionization state gas associated withobserved damped lyman-alpha systems, based on a semi-analytic model of galaxyformation set within the paradigm of hierarchical structure formation. in ourmodel, the hot gas in halos and sub-halos gives rise to civ absorption, whilethe low-ionization state gas is associated with the cold gas in galaxies. themodel matches the distribution of civ column densities and leads naturally tokinematic properties that are in good agreement with the data.  we examine the contribution of both hot and cold gas to sub-damped systemsand suggest that the properties of these systems can be used as an importanttest of the model. we expect that sub-dla systems will generally be composed ofa single gas disk and thus predict that they should have markedly differentkinematics than the damped systems.  finally, we find that hot halo gas produces less than one third of lymanlimit systems at redshift three. we model the contribution of mini-halos (haloswith virial velocities &lt; 35 km/s) to lyman limit systems and find that they maycontain as much gas as is observed in these systems. however, if we adoptrealistic models of the gas density distribution we find that these systems arenot a significant source of lyman limit absorption. instead we suggest thatuncollapsed gas outside of virialized halos is responsible for most of thelyman limit systems at high redshift.

astro-ph;0308519	the dark side of the halo occupation distribution	we analyze the halo occupation distribution (hod), the probability for a haloof mass m to host a number of subhalos n, and two-point correlation function ofgalaxy-size dark matter halos using high-resolution dissipationless simulationsof the concordance flat lcdm model. the halo samples include both the hosthalos and the subhalos, distinct gravitationally-bound halos within thevirialized regions of larger host systems. we find that the first moment of thehod, &lt;n&gt;(m), has a complicated shape consisting of a step, a shoulder, and apower law high-mass tail. the hod can be described by a poisson statistics athigh halo masses but becomes sub-poisson for &lt;n&gt;&lt;4. we show that the hod can beunderstood as a combination of the probability for a halo of mass m to host acentral galaxy and the probability to host a given number ns of satellitegalaxies. the former can be approximated by a step-like function, while thelatter can be well approximated by a poisson distribution, fully specified byits first moment &lt;ns&gt;(m). we find that &lt;ns&gt;~m^b with b~1 for a wide range ofnumber densities, redshifts, and different power spectrum normalizations. thisformulation provides a simple but accurate model for the halo occupationdistribution found in simulations. at z=0, the two-point correlation function(cf) of galactic halos can be well fit by a power law down to ~100/h kpc withan amplitude and slope similar to those of observed galaxies. at redshiftsz&gt;~1, we find significant departures from the power-law shape of the cf atsmall scales. if the deviations are as strong as indicated by our results, theassumption of the single power law often used in observational analyses ofhigh-redshift clustering is likely to bias the estimates of the correlationlength and slope of the correlation function.

astro-ph;0402210	dark energy and dark matter halos	we investigate the effect of dark energy on the density profiles of darkmatter haloes with a suite of cosmological n-body simulations and use ourresults to test analytic models. we consider constant equation of state models,and allow both w&gt;-1 and w&lt;-1. using five simulations with w ranging from -1.5to -0.5, and with more than ~1600 well-resolved haloes each, we show that thehalo concentration model of bullock et al. (2001) accurately predicts themedian concentrations of haloes over the range of w, halo masses, and redshiftsthat we are capable of probing. we find that the bullock et al. (2001) modelworks best when halo masses and concentrations are defined relative to an outerradius set by a cosmology-dependent virial overdensity. for a fixed powerspectrum normalization and fixed-mass haloes, larger values of w lead to higherconcentrations and higher halo central densities, both because collapse occursearlier and because haloes have higher virial densities. while precisepredictions of halo densities are quite sensitive to various uncertainties, wemake broad comparisons to galaxy rotation curve data. at fixed power spectrumnormalization (fixed sigma_8), w&gt;-1 quintessence models seem to exacerbate thecentral density problem relative to the standard w=-1 model. meanwhile w&lt;-1models help to reduce the apparent discrepancy. we confirm that the jenkins etal. (2001) halo mass function provides an excellent approximation to theabundance of haloes in our simulations and extend its region of validity toinclude models with w&lt;-1.

astro-ph;0404168	modeling galaxy-mass correlations in dissipationless simulations	we use high-resolution dissipationless simulations of the concordance flatlcdm model to make predictions for the galaxy--mass (gm) correlations andcompare them to the recent sdss weak lensing measurements.we use a simpleobservationally motivated scheme to assign luminosities and colors to thehalos.this allows us to closely match the selection criteria used to defineobservational samples.the simulations reproduce the observed gm correlationfunction and its observed dependencies on luminosity and color.the luminositydependence of the correlation function is primarily determined by the changingrelative contribution of central and satellite galaxies at differentluminosities. the color dependence of the gm correlations reflects thedifference in the typical environments of blue and red galaxies. we also findagreement between the predicted and observed cross-bias, b_x=b/r,at all probedscales.the gm correlation coefficient, r, is close to unity on scales &gt;1/hmpc.the cross bias is thus expected to measure the actual bias of galaxyclustering on these scales.the aperture mass-to-light ratio is independent ofgalaxy color.the aperture mass scales approximately linearly with luminosity atl_r&gt;10^{10}h^{-2} lsun, while at lower luminosities the scaling is shallower:l_r^{0.5}. we show that most of the luminous galaxies (m_r&lt;-21) are near thecenters of their halos and their gm correlation function at r&lt;100/h kpc cantherefore be interpreted as the average dark matter density profile of thesegalaxies. we find that for galaxies in a given narrow luminosity range, thereis a broad and possibly non-gaussian distribution of halo virial masses.therefore, the average relation between mass and luminosity derived from theweak lensing analyses should be interpreted with caution.

astro-ph;0412112	simulations of dust in interacting galaxies	a new monte-carlo radiative-transfer code, sunrise, is used to study theeffects of dust in n-body/hydrodynamic simulations of interacting galaxies.dust has a profound effect on the appearance of the simulated galaxies. at peakluminosities, about 90% of the bolometric luminosity is absorbed, and the dustobscuration scales with luminosity in such a way that the brightness atuv/visual wavelengths remains roughly constant. a general relationship betweenthe fraction of energy absorbed and the ratio of bolometric luminosity tobaryonic mass is found. comparing to observations, the simulations are found tofollow a relation similar to the observed irx-beta relation found by meurer etal (1999) when similar luminosity objects are considered. thehighest-luminosity simulated galaxies depart from this relation and occupy theregion where local (u)lirgs are found. this agreement is contingent on thepresence of milky-way-like dust, while smc-like dust results in far too red auv continuum slope to match observations. the simulations are used to study theperformance of star-formation indicators in the presence of dust. thefar-infrared luminosity is found to be reliable. in contrast, the h-alpha andfar-uv luminosity suffer severely from dust attenuation, and dust correctionscan only partially remedy the situation.

astro-ph;0503135	simulations of dust in interacting galaxies i: dust attenuation	a new monte-carlo radiative-transfer code, sunrise, is used in conjunctionwith hydrodynamic simulations of major galaxy mergers to calculate the effectsof dust in such systems. the simulations are in good agreement withobservations of dust absorption in starburst galaxies, and the dust has aprofound effect on their appearance. the dust attenuation increases withluminosity such that at peak luminosities ~90% of the bolometric luminosity isabsorbed by dust. in general, the detailed appearance of the merging eventdepends on the stage of the merger and the geometry of the encounter. thefraction of bolometric energy absorbed by the dust, however, is a robustquantity that can be predicted from the intrinsic properties bolometricluminosity, baryonic mass, star-formation rate, and metallicity of the system.this paper presents fitting formulae, valid over a wide range of masses andmetallicities, from which the absorbed fraction of luminosity (and consequentlyalso the infrared dust luminosity) can be predicted. the attenuation of theluminosity at specific wavelengths can also be predicted, albeit with a largerscatter due to the variation with viewing angle. these formulae for dustattenuation appear to be valid for both isolated and interacting galaxies, areconsistent with earlier studies, and would be suitable for inclusion intheoretical models, e.g. semi-analytic models of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;9611106	non-gaussian fluctuations and primordial black holes from inflation	we explore the role of non-gaussian fluctuations in primordial black hole(pbh) formation and show that the standard gaussian assumption, used in all pbhformation papers to date, is not justified. since large spikes in power areusually associated with flat regions of the inflaton potential, quantumfluctuations become more important in the field dynamics, leading to mode-modecoupling and non-gaussian statistics. moreover, pbh production requires severalsigma (rare) fluctuations in order to prevent premature matter dominance of theuniverse, so we are necessarily concerned with distribution tails, where anyintrinsic skewness will be especially important. we quantify this argument byusing the stochastic slow-roll equation and a relatively simple analytic methodto obtain the final distribution of fluctuations. we work out several exampleswith toy models that produce pbh's, and show that the naive gaussian assumptioncan result in errors of many orders of magnitude. for models with spikes inpower, our calculations give sharp cut-offs in the probability of largepositive fluctuations, meaning that gaussian distributions would vastlyover-produce pbh's. the standard results that link inflation-produced powerspectra and pbh number densities must then be reconsidered, since they relyquite heavily on the gaussian assumption. we point out that since theprobability distributions depend on the nature of the potential, it isimpossible to obtain results for general models. however, calculating thedistribution of fluctuations for any specific model seems to be relativelystraightforward, at least in the single inflaton case.

astro-ph;9707285	dark matter and structure formation in the universe	this chapter aims to present an introduction to current research on thenature of the cosmological dark matter and the origin of galaxies and largescale structure within the standard theoretical framework: gravitationalcollapse of fluctuations as the origin of structure in the expanding universe.general relativistic cosmology is summarized, and the data on the basiccosmological parameters ($t_o$ and $h_0 \equiv 100 h \kmsmpc$, $\omega_0$,$\omega_\lambda$ and $\omega_b$) are reviewed. various particle physicscandidates for hot, warm, and cold dark matter are briefly reviewed, togetherwith current constraints and experiments that could detect or eliminate them.also included is a very brief summary of the theory of cosmic defects, and asomewhat more extended exposition of the idea of cosmological inflation with asummary of some current models of inflation. the remainder is a discussion ofobservational constraints on cosmological model building, emphasizing models inwhich most of the dark matter is cold and the primordial fluctuations are thesort predicted by inflation. it is argued that the simplest models that have ahope of working are cold dark matter with a cosmological constant($\lambda$cdm) if the hubble parameter is high ($h \gsim 0.7$), and cold + hotdark matter (chdm) if the hubble parameter and age permit an $\omega=1$cosmology, as seems plausible in light of the data from the hipparcosastrometric satellite. the most attractive variants of these models and thecritical tests for each are discussed.

astro-ph;9708176	the cores of dark matter dominated galaxies: theory vs. observations	we use the rotation curves of a sample of dark matter dominated dwarf andlow-surface brightness (lsb) late-type galaxies to study their radial massdistributions. we find that the shape of the rotation curves is remarkablysimilar for all (both dwarf and lsb) galaxies in the sample, suggesting aself-similar density distribution of their dark matter (dm) halos. this shapecan be reproduced well by a density profile with a shallow central cusp(rho(r)\propto 1/r^gamma, gamma\approx 0.2-0.4), corresponding to a steeplyrising velocity curve (v(r)\propto r^g, g\approx 0.9-0.8). we further show thatthe observed shape of the rotation curves is well matched by the densityprofiles of dm halos formed in very high resolution simulations of the cdm,lcdm, and chdm models of structure formation. this is surprising in light ofseveral previous studies which suggested that the structure of simulated dmhalos is inconsistent with the dynamics of dwarf galaxies. we discuss possibleexplanations for this discrepancy. we show that although the mass distributionin the hierarchically formed halos is on average consistent with the shape ofrotation curves of dark matter dominated galaxies, the scatter of theindividual profiles around the average is substantial and should not beneglected in comparisons with the data. finally, we show that the dm halos inour hierarchical simulations and the real galaxies in our sample exhibit asimilar decrease in their characteristic densities with increasingcharacteristic radial scales, and increase in their maximum rotation velocitieswith increasing radii at which their maximum velocity occurs.

astro-ph;9712141	implications of spikes in the redshift distribution of $z\sim3$ galaxies	we address the high peaks found by steidel et al (1997) in the redshiftdistribution of ``lyman-break'' objects (lbos) at redshift z~3. the highestspike represents a relative overdensity of 2.6 in the distribution of lbos inpixels of comoving size ~10mpc/h. we examine the likelihood of such a spike inthe redshift distribution within a suite of models for the evolution ofstructure in the universe, including models with omega=1 (scdm and chdm) andwith omega=0.4-0.5 (lcdm and ocdm). using high-resolution dissipationlessn-body simulations, we analyze deep pencil-beam surveys from these models inthe same way that they are actually observed, identifying lbos with the mostmassive dark matter halos. we find that all the models (with scdm as a marginalexception) have a substantial probability of producing spikes similar to thoseobserved, because the massive halos are much more clumped than the underlyingmatter -- i.e., they are biased. therefore, the likelihood of such a spike isnot a good discriminator among these models. we find in these models that themean biasing parameter b of lbos with respect to dark matter varies within arange b ~2-5 on a scale of ~10mpc/h. we also compute the two-body correlationfunctions of lbos predicted in these models. the lbo correlation functions areless steep than galaxies today (gamma ~1.4), but show similar or slightlylonger correlation lengths.

astro-ph;9712142	cdm-variant cosmological models - i: simulations and preliminary  comparisons	we present two matched sets of five simulations each, covering five presentlyfavored simple modifications to the standard cold dark matter (cdm) scenario.one simulation suite, with a linear box size of 75 mpc/h, is designed for highresolution and good statistics on the group/poor cluster scale, and the other,with a box size of 300 mpc/h, is designed for good rich cluster statistics. allruns had 57 million cold particles, and models with massive neutrinos had anadditional 113 million hot particles. we consider separately models withmassive neutrinos, tilt, curvature, and a nonzero cosmological constant inaddition to the standard cdm model. we find that our tiltedomega+omega_lambda=1 (tlcdm) model produces too much small-scale power by afactor of ~3, and our open lambda=0 (ocdm) model also exceeds observedsmall-scale power by a factor of 2. in addition, we take advantage of the largedynamic range in detectable halo masses our simulations allow to check theshape of the press-schechter approximation. we find good fits at cluster massesfor delta_c=1.27--1.35 for a gaussian filter and delta_c=1.57--1.73 for atophat filter. however, press-schechter overpredicts the number density ofhalos compared to the simulations in the high resolution suite by a weaklycosmology-dependent factor of 1.5--2 at galaxy and group masses, which cannotbe fixed by adjusting delta_c within reasonable bounds. an appendix generalizesthe spherical collapse model to any isotropic cosmology.

astro-ph;9806263	the nature of lyman-break galaxies	using semi-analytic models of galaxy formation, we investigate the propertiesof $z\sim3$ galaxies and compare them with the observed population oflyman-break galaxies (lbgs). in addition to the usual quiescent mode of starformation, we introduce a physical model for starbursts triggered bygalaxy-galaxy interactions. we find that with the merger rate that arisesnaturally in the cdm-based merging hierarchy, a significant fraction of brightgalaxies identified at high redshift ($z \ga 2$) are likely to be low-mass,bursting satellite galaxies. the abundance of lbgs as a function of redshiftand the luminosity function of lbgs both appear to be in better agreement withthe data when the starburst mode is included, especially when effects of dustextinction are considered. the objects that we identify as lbgs have observableproperties including low velocity dispersions that are in good agreement withthe available data. in this ``bursting satellite'' scenario, quiescent starformation at $z\ga2$ is relatively inefficient and most of the observed lbgsare starbursts triggered by satellite mergers within massive halos. inhigh-resolution n-body simulations, we find that the most massive dark matterhalos cluster at redshift $z\sim 3$ much as the lbgs are observed to do. thisis true for both the $\omega=1$ chdm model and low-$\omega$ \lcdm and ocdmmodels, all of which have fluctuation power spectra $p(k)$ consistent with thedistribution of low-redshift galaxies. the bursting satellite scenario canresolve the apparent paradox of lbgs that cluster like massive dark matterhalos but have narrow linewidths and small stellar masses.

astro-ph;9810204	cold + hot dark matter after super-kamiokande	the recent atmospheric neutrino data from super-kamiokande provide strongevidence of neutrino oscillations and therefore of non-zero neutrino mass.these data imply a lower limit on the hot dark matter (i.e., light neutrino)contribution to the cosmological density $\omega_\nu &gt;~ 0.001$ --- almost asmuch as that of all the stars in the universe --- and permit higher$\omega_\nu$. the ``standard'' cobe-normalized critical-matter-density (i.e.,$\omega_m=1$) cold dark matter (cdm) model has too much power on small scales.but adding to cdm neutrinos with mass of about 5 ev, corresponding to$\omega_\nu \approx 0.2$, results in a much improved fit to data on the nearbygalaxy and cluster distribution. indeed, the resulting cold + hot dark matter(chdm) cosmological model is arguably the most successful $\omega_m=1$ modelfor structure formation. however, other recent data has begun to make the casefor $\omega_m &lt;~ 0.6$ fairly convincing. in light of all this new data, wereconsider whether cosmology still provides evidence favoring neutrino mass ofa few ev in flat models with cosmological constant $\omega_\lambda = 1 -\omega_m$. we find that the possible improvement of the low-$\omega_m$ flat(lcdm) cosmological models with the addition of light neutrinos appears to berather limited.

astro-ph;9811001	the star formation history in a hierarchical universe	observations now probe the star formation history of the universe back to aredshift of $z\sim5$. we investigate whether the predictions of semi-analyticmodels of galaxy formation based on hierarchical cold dark matter (cdm) typemodels are in agreement with these direct observations and also with the``fossil'' evidence contained in constraints on the ages of present dayearly-type galaxies. previous models predicted that the star formation ratedensity falls off rather steeply at $z\ga 2$, and correspondingly that themajority of the stars in the universe formed at relatively low redshift. weinvestigate the effect of including a bursting mode of star formation, assumingthat galaxy-galaxy mergers trigger starbursts and using the merger rate thatarises naturally in the cdm merging hierarchy. the resulting starburstssubstantially increase the global star formation rate at high redshift, leadingto predictions that are in good agreement with the star formation rate densityat $z\sim3$ obtained from sub-millimeter observations (scuba) and optical/uvestimates after correction for dust extinction. the mass of stars formed at $z\ge 3$ is correspondingly in better agreement with the fossil evidence. we alsoinvestigate complementary global quantities such as the mass of cold gas andthe average metallicity of cold gas as a function of redshift, and theintegrated extra-galactic background light. we argue that these observations,taken together, provide strong constraints on the star formation history of theuniverse, and that hierarchical models of the cdm type are in reasonableagreement with these observations when starbursts are included.

astro-ph;9812368	cosmological implications of lyman-break galaxy clustering	we review our analysis of the clustering properties of ``lyman-break''galaxies (lbgs) at redshift z~3, previously discussed in wechsler et al (1998).we examine the likelihood of spikes found by steidel et al (1998) in theredshift distribution of lbgs, within a suite of models for the evolution ofstructure in the universe. using high-resolution dissipationless n-bodysimulations, we analyze deep pencil-beam surveys from these models in the sameway that they are actually observed, identifying lbgs with the most massivedark matter halos. we find that all the models (with scdm as a marginalexception) have a substantial probability of producing spikes similar to thoseobserved, because the massive halos are much more clumped than the underlyingmatter -- i.e., they are biased. therefore, the likelihood of such a spike isnot a good discriminator among these models. the lbg correlation functions areless steep than galaxies today (gamma~1.4), but show similar or slightly longercorrelation lengths. we have extened this analysis and include a preliminarycomparison to the new data presented in adelberger et al (1998). we alsodiscuss work in progress, in which we use semi-analytic models to identifylyman-break galaxies within dark-matter halos.

astro-ph;9812369	making damped lyman alpha systems in semi-analytic models	the velocity profiles of weak metal absorption lines can be used toobservationally probe the kinematic state of gas in damped lyman-alpha systems.prochaska and wolfe have argued that the flat distribution of velocity widthscombined with the asymmetric line profiles indicate that the dlas are diskswith large rotation velocities. an alternative explanation has been proposed byhaehnelt, steinmetz, and rauch, in which the observed large velocity widths andasymmetric profiles can be produced by lines of sight passing through two ormore clumps each having relatively small internal velocity dispersions. weinvestigate the plausibility of this scenario in the context of semi-analyticmodels based on hierarchical merging trees and including simple treatments ofgas dynamics, star formation, supernova feedback, and chemical evolution. wefind that all the observed properties of the metal-line systems including thedistribution of velocities and the asymmetric profiles, can be reproduced bylines of sight passing through sub-clumps that are bound within largervirialized dark matter halos. in order to produce enough multiple hits, we findthat the cold gas must be considerably more extended than the optical radius ofthe proto-galaxies, perhaps even beyond the tidal radius of the sub-halo. thiscould occur due to tidal stripping or supernova-driven outflows.

astro-ph;9908075	the velocity function of galaxies	we present a galaxy circular velocity function, psi(log v), derived fromexisting luminosity functions and luminosity-velocity relations. such avelocity function is desirable for several reasons. first, it enables anobjective comparison of luminosity functions obtained in different bands andfor different galaxy morphologies, with a statistical correction for dustextinction. in addition, the velocity function simplifies comparison ofobservations with predictions from high-resolution cosmological n-bodysimulations.  we derive velocity functions from five different data sets and find roughagreement among them, but about a factor of 2 variation in amplitude. thesevelocity functions are then compared with n-body simulations of a lcdm model(corrected for baryonic infall) in order to demonstrate both the utility andcurrent limitations of this approach. the number density of dark matter halosand the slope of the velocity function near v_*, the circular velocitycorresponding to an ~l_* spiral galaxy, are found to be comparable to that ofobserved galaxies. the primary sources of uncertainty in construction ofpsi(log v) from observations and n-body simulations are discussed andexplanations are suggected to account for these discrepancies.

astro-ph;9908159	profiles of dark haloes: evolution, scatter, and environment	we study dark-matter halo density profiles in a high-resolution n-bodysimulation of an lcdm cosmology. our statistical sample contains ~5000 haloesin the range 10^{11}-10^{14} m_sun. the profiles are parameterized by an nfwform with two parameters, an inner radius r_s and a virial radius r_v, and wedefine the halo concentration c_v = r_v/r_s. first, we find that, for a givenhalo mass, the redshift dependence of the median concentration is c_v ~1/(1+z), corresponding to a roughly constant r_s with redshift. we present animproved analytic treatment of halo formation that fits the measured relationsbetween halo parameters and their redshift dependence. the implications arethat high-redshift galaxies are predicted to be more extended and dimmer thanexpected before. second, we find that the scatter in log(c_v) is ~0.18,corresponding to a scatter in maximum rotation velocities of dv/v ~ 0.12. wediscuss implications for modelling the tully-fisher relation, which has asmaller reported intrinsic scatter. third, haloes in dense environments tend tobe more concentrated than isolated haloes. these results suggest that c_v is anessential parameter for the theory of galaxy modelling, and we briefly discussimplications for the universality of the tully-fisher relation, the formationof low surface brightness galaxies, and the origin of the hubble sequence.

0811.1984	modeling gamma-ray attenuation in high-redshift gev spectra	we present two models for the cosmological uv background light, and calculatethe opacity of gev gamma--rays out to redshift 9. the contributors to thebackground include 2 possible quasar emissivities, and output fromstar--forming galaxies as determined by recent a semi--analytic model (sam) ofstructure formation. the sam used in this work is based upon a hierarchicalbuild-up of structure in a $\lambda$cdm universe and is highly successful inreproducing a variety of observational parameters. above 1 rydberg energy,ionizing radiation is subject to reprocessing by the igm, which we treat usingour radiative transfer code, cuba. the two models for quasar emissivitydiffering above z = 2.3 are chosen to match the ionization rates observed usingflux decrement analysis and the higher values of the line-of-sight proximityeffect. we also investigate the possibility of a flat star formation ratedensity at z $&gt;5$. we conclude that observations of gamma--rays from 10 to 100gev by fermi (glast) and the next generation of ground based experiments shouldconfirm a strongly evolving opacity from $1&lt;$ z $&lt;4$. observation ofattenuation in the spectra of gamma--ray bursts at higher redshift couldconstrain emission of uv radiation at these early times, either from a flat orincreasing star-formation density or an unobserved population of sources.
