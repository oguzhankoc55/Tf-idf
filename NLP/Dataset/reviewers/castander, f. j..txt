0902.2403	near-ir galaxy counts and evolution from the wide-field alhambra survey	the alhambra survey aims to cover 4 square degrees using a system of 20contiguous, equal width, medium-band filters spanning the range 3500 a to 9700a plus the standard jhks filters. here we analyze deep near-ir number counts ofone of our fields (alh08) for which we have a relatively large area (0.5 squaredegrees) and faint photometry (j=22.4, h=21.3 and k=20.0 at the 50% of recoveryefficiency for point-like sources). we find that the logarithmic gradient ofthe galaxy counts undergoes a distinct change to a flatter slope in each band:from 0.44 at [17.0, 18.5] to 0.34 at [19.5, 22.0] for the j band; for the hband 0.46 at [15.5, 18.0] to 0.36 at [19.0, 21.0], and in ks the change is from0.53 in the range [15.0, 17.0] to 0.33 in the interval [18.0, 20.0]. theseobservations together with faint optical counts are used to constrain modelsthat include density and luminosity evolution of the local type-dependentluminosity functions. our models imply a decline in the space density ofevolved early-type galaxies with increasing redshift, such that only 30% - 50%of the bulk of the present day red-ellipticals was already in place at z~1.

0911.1069	3d spectroscopy of local luminous compact blue galaxies: kinematics of  ngc 7673	the kinematic properties of the ionized gas of local luminous compact bluegalaxy (lcbg) ngc 7673 are presented using three dimensional data taken withthe ppak integral field unit at the 3.5-m telescope in the centro astron\'omicohispano alem\'an. our data reveal an asymmetric rotating velocity field with apeak to peak difference of 60 km s$^{-1}$. the kinematic centre is found to beat the position of a central velocity width maximum ($\sigma=54\pm1$ kms$^{-1}$), which is consistent with the position of the luminosity-weightedcentroid of the entire galaxy. the position angle of the minor rotation axis is168$^{\circ}$ as measured from the orientation of the velocity field contours.at least two decoupled kinematic components are found. the first one is compactand coincides with the position of the second most active star formation region(clump b). the second one is extended and does not have a clear opticalcounterpart. no evidence of active galactic nuclei activity or supernovaegalactic winds powering any of these two components has been found. our data,however, show evidence in support of a previously proposed minor mergerscenario in which a dwarf galaxy, tentatively identified with clump b, isfalling into ngc 7673. and triggers the starburst. finally, it is shown thatthe dynamical mass of this galaxy may be severely underestimated when using thederived rotation curve or the integrated velocity width, under the assumptionof virialization.

0912.3283	the evolution of luminous compact blue galaxies: disks or spheroids?	luminous compact blue galaxies (lcbgs) are a diverse class of galaxiescharacterized by high luminosities, blue colors, and high surface brightnesses.residing at the high luminosity, high mass end of the blue sequence, lcbgs sitat the critical juncture of galaxies that are evolving from the blue to the redsequence. yet we do not understand what drives the evolution of lcbgs, nor howthey will evolve. based on single-dish hi observations, we know that they havea diverse range of properties. lcbgs are hi-rich with m(hi)=10^{9-10.5} m(sun),have moderate m(dyn)=10^{10-12} m(sun), and 80% have gas depletion timescalesless than 3 gyr. these properties are consistent with lcbgs evolving intolow-mass spirals or high mass dwarf ellipticals or dwarf irregulars. however,lcbgs do not follow the tully-fisher relation, nor can most evolve onto it,implying that many lcbgs are not smoothly rotating, virialized systems. gmrtand vla hi maps confirm this conclusion revealing signatures of recentinteractions and dynamically hot components in some local lcbgs, consistentwith the formation of a thick disk or spheroid. such signatures and the highincidence of close companions around lcbgs suggest that star formation in locallcbgs is likely triggered by interactions. the dynamical masses and apparentspheroid formation in lcbgs combined with previous results from opticalspectroscopy are consistent with virial heating being the primary mechanism forquenching star formation in these galaxies.

0708.2703	the nature of nearby counterparts to intermediate-redshift luminous  compact blue galaxies. iii. interferometric observations of neutral atomic  and molecular gas	we present the results of a vla and ovro-mma follow-up to our single-dishsurveys of the neutral atomic and molecular gas in a sample of nearby luminouscompact blue galaxies (lcbgs). these luminous, blue, high surface brightness,starbursting galaxies were selected using criteria similar to that used todefine lcbgs at higher redshifts. the surveys were undertaken to study thenature and evolutionary possibilities of lcbgs, using dynamical masses and gasdepletion time scales as constraints. here we present nearly resolved vla h imaps of four lcbgs, as well as results from the literature for a fifth lcbg. inaddition, we present ovro-mma maps of co(j=1-0) in two of these lcbgs. we haveused the resolved h i maps to separate the h i emission from target galaxiesand their companions to improve the accuracy of our gas and dynamical massestimates. for this sub-sample of lcbgs, we find that the dynamical massesmeasured with the single-dish telescope and interferometer are in agreement.however, we find that we have overestimated the mass of h i in two galaxies bya significant amount, possibly as much as 75%, when compared to the single-dishestimates. these two galaxies have companions within a few arc minutes; we findthat our single-dish and interferometric measurements of h i masses are inreasonable agreement for galaxies with more distant companions. the h ivelocity fields indicate that all five galaxies are clearly rotating yetdistorted, likely due to recent interactions. our measurements of the gas anddynamical masses of lcbgs point towards evolution into low mass galaxies suchas dwarf ellipticals, irregulars, and low mass spirals, consistent with studiesof lcbgs at higher redshifts.

1008.1753	herschel fir counterparts of selected ly-alpha emitters at z~2.2. fast  evolution since z~3 or missed obscured agns?	ly-alpha emitters (laes) are seen everywhere in the redshift domain fromlocal to z~7. far-infrared (fir) counterparts of laes at different epochs couldprovide direct clues on dust content, extinction, and spectral energydistribution (sed) for these galaxies. we search for fir counterparts of laesthat are optically detected in the goods-north field at redshift z~2.2 usingdata from the herschel space telescope with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs). the lae candidates were isolated via color-magnitudediagram using the medium-band photometry from the alhambra survey, ancillarydata on goods-north, and stellar population models. according to the fitting ofthese spectral synthesis models and fir/optical diagnostics, most of them seemto be obscured galaxies whose spectra are agn-dominated. from the analysis ofthe optical data, we have observed a fraction of agn or composite over sourcetotal number of ~0.75 in the lae population at z~2.2, which is marginallyconsistent with the fraction previously observed at z=2.25 and even at lowredshift (0.2&lt;z&lt;0.45), but significantly different from the one observed atredshift ~3, which could be compatible either with a scenario of rapid changein the agn fraction between the epochs involved or with a non detection ofobscured agn in other z=2-3 lae samples due to lack of deep fir observations.we found three robust fir (pacs) counterparts at z~2.2 in goods-north. thisdemonstrates the possibility of finding dust emission in laes even at higherredshifts.

1008.2354	colour gradients within sdss dr7 galaxies: hints of recent evolution	the evolutionary path followed by a galaxy shapes its internal structure,and, in particular, its internal colour variation. we present a study of theinternal colour variation within galaxies from the seventh data release of thesloan digital sky survey (sdss dr7). we statistically study the connectionbetween the internal colour variation and global galactic properties, lookingfor hints of the recent galactic evolution. considering only galaxies with goodphotometry and spectral measurements, we define four luminosity-thresholdsamples within the redshift range 0.01&lt;z&lt;0.17, each containing more than 48000galaxies. colour gradients are calculated for these galaxies from the surfacebrightness measurements provided by the sdss dr7. possible systematic effectsin their determination have been analysed. we find that, on average, galaxieshave redder cores than their external parts. we also find that it is morelikely to find steep colour gradients among late-type galaxies. this resultholds for a range of classifications based on both morphological and spectralcharacteristics. in fact, our results relate, on average, steep colourgradients to a higher presence of young stars within a galaxy. our results alsosuggest that nuclear activity is a marginal driver for creating steep colourgradients in massive galaxies. we have selected pairs of interacting galaxies,with a separation of 5 arcsec, in projected radius, and a difference inredshift of 100 km/s, finding that they present steeper gradients than theaverage population, skewed towards bluer cores. our analysis implies thatcolour gradients can be useful for selecting galaxies that have suffered arecent (minor) burst of star formation.

1101.3290	the evolution of luminous compact blue galaxies: disks or spheroids?	luminous compact blue galaxies (lcbgs) are a diverse class of galaxiescharacterized by high luminosity, blue color, and high surface brightness thatsit at the critical juncture of galaxies evolving from the blue to the redsequence. as part of our multi-wavelength survey of local lcbgs, we have beenstudying the hi content of these galaxies using both single-dish telescopes andinterferometers. our goals are to determine if single-dish hi observationsrepresent a true measure of the dynamical mass of lcbgs and to look forsignatures of recent interactions that may be triggering star formation inlcbgs. our data show that while some lcbgs are undergoing interactions, manyappear isolated. while all lcbgs contain hi and show signatures of rotation,the population does not lie on the tully-fisher relation nor can it evolve ontoit. furthermore, the hi maps of many lcbgs show signatures of dynamically hotcomponents, suggesting that we are seeing the formation of a thick disk orspheroid in at least some lcbgs. there is good agreement between the hi andh-alpha kinematics for lcbgs, and both are similar in appearance to the h-alphakinematics of high redshift star-forming galaxies. our combined data suggestthat star formation in lcbgs is primarily quenched by virial heating,consistent with model predictions.

1108.2994	3d spectroscopy of local luminous compact blue galaxies: kinematic maps  of a sample of 22 objects	we use three dimensional optical spectroscopy observations of a sample of 22local luminous compact blue galaxies (lcbgs) to create kinematic maps. by meansof these, we classify the kinematics of these galaxies into three differentclasses: rotating disk (rd), perturbed rotation (pr), and complex kinematics(ck). we find 48% are rds, 28% are prs, and 24% are cks. rds show rotationalvelocities that range between $\sim50$ and $\sim200 km s^{-1}$, and dynamicalmasses that range between $\sim1\times10^{9}$ and $\sim3\times10^{10}m_{\odot}$. we also address the following two fundamental questions through thestudy of the kinematic maps: \emph{(i) what processes are triggering thecurrent starbust in lcbgs?} we search our maps of the galaxy velocity fieldsfor signatures of recent interactions and close companions that may beresponsible for the enhanced star formation in our sample. we find 5% ofobjects show evidence of a recent major merger, 10% of a minor merger, and 45%of a companion. this argues in favor of ongoing interactions with closecompanions as a mechanism for the enhanced star formation activity in thesegalaxies. \emph{(ii) what processes may eventually quench the current starbustin lcbgs?} velocity and velocity width maps, together with emission line ratiomaps, can reveal signatures of active galactic nuclei (agn) activity orsupernova (sn) driven galactic winds that could halt the current burst. we findonly 5% of objects with clear evidence of agn activity, and 27% with kinematicsconsistent with sn-driven galactic winds. therefore, a different mechanism maybe responsible for quenching the star formation in lcbgs. finally, from ouranalysis, we find that the velocity widths of rds, rather than accountingexclusively for the rotational nature of these objects, may account as well forother kinematic components, and may not be good tracers of their dynamicalmasses.

1202.3397	quasi-stellar objects in the alhambra survey. i. photometric redshift  accuracy based on a 23 optical-nir filter photometry	we characterize the ability of the alhambra survey to assign accuratephoto-z's to blagn and qsos based on their alhambra very-low-resolutionoptical-nir spectroscopy. a sample of 170 spectroscopically identified blagnand qsos have been used together with a library of templates (including sedsfrom agn, normal, starburst galaxies and stars) in order to fit the 23photometric data points provided by alhambra in the optical and nir (20medium-band optical filters plus the standard jhks). we find that the alhambraphotometry is able to provide an accurate photo-z and spectral classificationfor ~88% of the spectroscopic sources over 2.5 deg^2 in different areas of thesurvey, all of them brighter than m678=23.5 (equivalent to r(sloan)~24.0). thederived photo-z accuracy is better than 1% and comparable to the most recentresults in other cosmological fields. the fraction of outliers (~12%) is mainlycaused by the larger photometric errors for the faintest sources and theintrinsic variability of the blagn/qso population. a small fraction of outliersmay have an incorrectly assigned spectroscopic redshift. the definition of thealhambra survey in terms of the number of filters, filter properties, areacoverage and depth is able to provide photometric redshifts for blagn/qsos witha precision similar to any previous survey that makes use of medium-bandoptical photometry. in agreement with previous literature results, our analysisalso reveals that, in the 0&lt;z&lt;4 redshift interval, very accurate photo-z can beobtained without the use of near-ir broadband photometry at the expense of aslight increase of outliers. the nir importance is expected to increase athigher redshifts (z&gt;4). these results are relevant for the design of futureoptical follow-ups of surveys with a large fraction of blagn, as it is the casefor x-rays or radio surveys.

1306.1121	lyman break and uv-selected galaxies at z ~ 1: ii. pacs-100um/160um fir  detections	we report the pacs-100um/160um detections of a sample of 42 galex-selectedand fir-detected lyman break galaxies (lbgs) at z ~ 1 located in the cosmosfield and analyze their ultra-violet (uv) to far-infrared (fir) properties. thedetection of these lbgs in the fir indicates that they have a dust content highenough so that its emission can be directly detected. according to a spectralenergy distribution (sed) fitting with stellar population templates to theiruv-to-near-ir observed photometry, pacs-detected lbgs tend to be bigger, moremassive, dustier, redder in the uv continuum, and uv-brighter thanpacs-undetected lbgs. pacs-detected lbgs at z ~ 1 are mostly disk-like galaxiesand are located over the green-valley and red sequence of the color-magnitudediagram of galaxies at their redshift. by using their uv and ir emission, wefind that pacs-detected lbgs tend to be less dusty and have slightly highertotal star-formation rates (sfrs) than other pacs-detected uv-selected galaxieswithin their same redshift range. as a consequence of the selection effect dueto the depth of the fir observations employed, all our pacs-detected lbgs arelirgs. however, none of them are in the ulirg regime, where the firobservations are complete. the finding of ulirgs-lbgs at higher redshiftssuggests an evolution of the fir emission of lbgs with cosmic time. in anirx-$\beta$ diagram, pacs-detected lbgs at z ~ 1 tend to be located around therelation for local starburst similarly to other uv-selected pacs-detectedgalaxies at their same redshift. consequently, the dust-correction factorsobtained with their uv continuum slope allow to determine their total sfr,unlike at higher redshifts. however, the dust attenuation derived from uv tonir sed fitting overestimates the total sfr for most of our pacs-detected lbgsin age-dependent way: the overestimation factor is higher in younger galaxies.

1307.5117	the alhambra survey: discovery of a faint qso at z = 5.41	we aim to illustrate the potentiality of the advanced large, homogeneousarea, medium-band redshift astronomical (alhambra) survey to investigate thehigh redshift universe through the detection of quasi stellar objects (qsos) atredshifts larger than 5. the search for z&gt;5 qsos candidates was done by fittingan extensive library of spectral energy distributions --including active andnon-active galaxy templates as well as stars-- to the photometric database ofthe alhambra survey (composed of 20 optical medium-band plus the 3 broad-bandjhks filters). our selection over ~1 square degree of alhambra data (~1/4 ofthe total area covered by the survey), combined with gtc/osiris spectroscopy,has yielded the identification of an optically faint qso at very high redshift(z = 5.41). the qso has an absolute magnitude of ~-24 at the 1450{\aa}continuum, a bolometric luminosity of ~2x10^46 erg/s and an estimated blackhole mass of ~10^8 msolar. this qso adds itself to a reduced number of known uvfaint sources at these redshifts. the preliminary derived space density iscompatible with the most recent determinations of the high-z qso luminosityfunctions (qlf). this new detection shows how alhambra, as well as forthcomingwell designed photometric surveys, can provide a wealth of information on theorigin and early evolution of this kind of objects.

1401.4993	the alhambra survey: an empirical estimation of the cosmic variance for  merger fraction studies based on close pairs	our goal is to estimate empirically, for the first time, the cosmic variancethat affects merger fraction studies based on close pairs. we compute themerger fraction from photometric redshift close pairs with 10h^-1 kpc &lt;= rp &lt;=50h^-1 kpc and dv &lt;= 500 km/s, and measure it in the 48 sub-fields of thealhambra survey. we study the distribution of the measured merger fractions,that follow a log-normal function, and estimate the cosmic variance sigma_v asthe intrinsic dispersion of the observed distribution. we develop a maximumlikelihood estimator to measure a reliable sigma_v and avoid the dispersion dueto the observational errors (including the poisson shot noise term). the cosmicvariance of the merger fraction depends mainly on (i) the number density of thepopulations under study, both for the principal (n_1) and the companion (n_2)galaxy in the close pair, and (ii) the probed cosmic volume v_c. we find asignificant dependence on neither the search radius used to define closecompanions, the redshift, nor the physical selection (luminosity or stellarmass) of the samples. we provide a parametrisation of the cosmic variance withn_1, n_2, and v_c, sigma_v = 0.48 n_1^{-0.54} v_c^{-0.48} (n_2/n_1)^{-0.37}.thanks to this prescription, future merger fraction studies based on closepairs could account properly for the cosmic variance on their results.

1411.3286	an algorithm to build mock galaxy catalogues using mice simulations	we present a method to build mock galaxy catalogues starting from a halocatalogue that uses halo occupation distribution (hod) recipes as well as thesubhalo abundance matching (sham) technique. combining both prescriptions weare able to push the absolute magnitude of the resulting catalogue to fainterluminosities than using just the sham technique and can interpret our resultsin terms of the hod modelling. we optimize the method by populating withgalaxies friends-of-friends dark matter haloes extracted from the marenostruminstitut de ci\`{e}ncies de l'espai (mice) dark matter simulations andcomparing them to observational constraints. our resulting mock galaxycatalogues manage to reproduce the observed local galaxy luminosity functionand the colour-magnitude distribution as observed by the sloan digital skysurvey. they also reproduce the observed galaxy clustering properties as afunction of luminosity and colour. in order to achieve that, the algorithm alsoincludes scatter in the halo mass - galaxy luminosity relation derived fromdirect sham and a modified nfw mass density profile to place satellite galaxiesin their host dark matter haloes. improving on general usage of the hod thatfits the clustering for given magnitude limited samples, our catalogues areconstructed to fit observations at all luminosities considered and thereforefor any luminosity subsample. overall, our algorithm is an economic procedureof obtaining galaxy mock catalogues down to faint magnitudes that are necessaryto understand and interpret galaxy surveys.

1504.03002	wide-field lensing mass maps from des science verification data:  methodology and detailed analysis	weak gravitational lensing allows one to reconstruct the spatial distributionof the projected mass density across the sky. these "mass maps" provide apowerful tool for studying cosmology as they probe both luminous and darkmatter. in this paper, we present a weak lensing mass map reconstructed fromshear measurements in a 139 sq. deg area from the dark energy survey (des)science verification (sv) data. we compare the distribution of mass with thatof the foreground distribution of galaxies and clusters. the overdensities inthe reconstructed map correlate well with the distribution of opticallydetected clusters. we demonstrate that candidate superclusters and voids alongthe line of sight can be identified, exploiting the tight scatter of thecluster photometric redshifts. we cross-correlate the mass map with aforeground magnitude-limited galaxy sample from the same data. our measurementgives results consistent with mock catalogs from n-body simulations thatinclude the primary sources of statistical uncertainties in the galaxy,lensing, and photo-z catalogs. the statistical significance of thecross-correlation is at the 6.8-sigma level with 20 arcminute smoothing. amajor goal of this study is to investigate systematic effects arising from avariety of sources, including psf and photo-z uncertainties. we make mapsderived from twenty variables that may characterize systematics and find theprincipal components. we find that the contribution of systematics to thelensing mass maps is generally within measurement uncertainties. in this work,we analyze less than 3% of the final area that will be mapped by the des; thetools and analysis techniques developed in this paper can be applied toforthcoming larger datasets from the survey.

1507.05353	joint analysis of galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy clustering:  methodology and forecasts for des	the joint analysis of galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy clustering is apromising method for inferring the growth function of large scale structure.this analysis will be carried out on data from the dark energy survey (des),with its measurements of both the distribution of galaxies and the tangentialshears of background galaxies induced by these foreground lenses. we develop apractical approach to modeling the assumptions and systematic effects affectingsmall scale lensing, which provides halo masses, and large scale galaxyclustering. introducing parameters that characterize the halo occupationdistribution (hod), photometric redshift uncertainties, and shear measurementerrors, we study how external priors on different subsets of these parametersaffect our growth constraints. degeneracies within the hod model, as well asbetween the hod and the growth function, are identified as the dominant sourceof complication, with other systematic effects sub-dominant. the impact of hodparameters and their degeneracies necessitate the detailed joint modeling ofthe galaxy sample that we employ. we conclude that des data will providepowerful constraints on the evolution of structure growth in the universe,conservatively/optimistically constraining the growth function to 7.9\%/4.8\%with its first-year data that covered over 1000 square degrees, and to3.9\%/2.3\% with its full five-year data that will survey 5000 square degrees,including both statistical and systematic uncertainties.

1507.05360	galaxy clustering, photometric redshifts and diagnosis of systematics in  the des science verification data	we study the clustering of galaxies detected at $i&lt;22.5$ in the scienceverification observations of the dark energy survey (des). two-pointcorrelation functions are measured using $2.3\times 10^6$ galaxies over acontiguous 116 deg$^2$ region in five bins of photometric redshift width$\delta z = 0.2$ in the range $0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.2.$ the impact of photometricredshift errors are assessed by comparing results using a template-basedphoto-$z$ algorithm (bpz) to a machine-learning algorithm (tpz). a companionpaper (leistedt et al 2015) presents maps of several observational variables(e.g. seeing, sky brightness) which could modulate the galaxy density. here wecharacterize and mitigate systematic errors on the measured clustering whicharise from these observational variables, in addition to others such asgalactic dust and stellar contamination. after correcting for systematiceffects we measure galaxy bias over a broad range of linear scales relative tomass clustering predicted from the planck $\lambda$cdm model, finding agreementwith cfhtls measurements with $\chi^2$ of 4.0 (8.7) with 5 degrees of freedomfor the tpz (bpz) redshifts. we test a "linear bias" model, in which the galaxyclustering is a fixed multiple of the predicted non-linear dark-matterclustering. the precision of the data allow us to determine that the linearbias model describes the observed galaxy clustering to $2.5\%$ accuracy down toscales at least $4$ to $10$ times smaller than those on which linear theory isexpected to be sufficient.

1507.05552	cosmology from cosmic shear with des science verification data	we present the first constraints on cosmology from the dark energy survey(des), using weak lensing measurements from the preliminary scienceverification (sv) data. we use 139 square degrees of sv data, which is lessthan 3\% of the full des survey area. using cosmic shear 2-point measurementsover three redshift bins we find $\sigma_8 (\omega_{\rm m}/0.3)^{0.5} = 0.81\pm 0.06$ (68\% confidence), after marginalising over 7 systematics parametersand 3 other cosmological parameters. we examine the robustness of our resultsto the choice of data vector and systematics assumed, and find them to bestable. about $20$\% of our error bar comes from marginalising over shear andphotometric redshift calibration uncertainties. the current state-of-the-artcosmic shear measurements from cfhtlens are mildly discrepant with thecosmological constraints from planck cmb data; our results are consistent withboth datasets. our uncertainties are $\sim$30\% larger than those from cfhtlenswhen we carry out a comparable analysis of the two datasets, which we attributelargely to the lower number density of our shear catalogue. we investigateconstraints on dark energy and find that, with this small fraction of the fullsurvey, the des sv constraints make negligible impact on the planckconstraints. the moderate disagreement between the cfhtlens and planck valuesof $\sigma_8 (\omega_{\rm m}/0.3)^{0.5}$ is present regardless of the value of$w$.

1507.05846	the impact from survey depth and resolution on the morphological  classification of galaxies	we consistently analyse for the first time the impact of survey depth andspatial resolution on the most used morphological parameters for classifyinggalaxies through non-parametric methods: abraham and conselice-bershadyconcentration indices, gini, m20 moment of light, asymmetry, and smoothness.three different non-local datasets are used, alhambra and sxds (examples ofdeep ground-based surveys), and cosmos (deep space-based survey). we used asample of 3000 local, visually classified galaxies, measuring theirmorphological parameters at their real redshifts (z ~ 0). then we simulatedthem to match the redshift and magnitude distributions of galaxies in thenon-local surveys. the comparisons of the two sets allow to put constraints onthe use of each parameter for morphological classification and evaluate theeffectiveness of the commonly used morphological diagnostic diagrams. allanalysed parameters suffer from biases related to spatial resolution and depth,the impact of the former being much stronger. when including asymmetry andsmoothness in classification diagrams, the noise effects must be taken intoaccount carefully, especially for ground-based surveys. m20 is significantlyaffected, changing both the shape and range of its distribution at allbrightness levels.we suggest that diagnostic diagrams based on 2 - 3 parametersshould be avoided when classifying galaxies in ground-based surveys,independently of their brightness; for cosmos they should be avoided forgalaxies fainter than f814 = 23.0. these results can be applied directly tosurveys similar to alhambra, sxds and cosmos, and also can serve as anupper/lower limit for shallower/deeper ones.

1507.05909	redshift distributions of galaxies in the des science verification shear  catalogue and implications for weak lensing	we present photometric redshift estimates for galaxies used in the weaklensing analysis of the dark energy survey science verification (des sv) data.four model- or machine learning-based photometric redshift methods -- annz2,bpz calibrated against bcc-ufig simulations, skynet, and tpz -- are analysed.for training, calibration, and testing of these methods, we construct acatalogue of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies matched against des sv data.the performance of the methods is evaluated against the matched spectroscopiccatalogue, focusing on metrics relevant for weak lensing analyses, withadditional validation against cosmos photo-zs. from the galaxies in the des svshear catalogue, which have mean redshift $0.72\pm0.01$ over the range$0.3&lt;z&lt;1.3$, we construct three tomographic bins with means of $z=\{0.45, 0.67,1.00\}$. these bins each have systematic uncertainties $\delta z \lesssim 0.05$in the mean of the fiducial skynet photo-z $n(z)$. we propagate the errors inthe redshift distributions through to their impact on cosmological parametersestimated with cosmic shear, and find that they cause shifts in the value of$\sigma_8$ of approx. 3%. this shift is within the one sigma statistical errorson $\sigma_8$ for the des sv shear catalog. we further study the potentialimpact of systematic differences on the critical surface density,$\sigma_{\mathrm{crit}}$, finding levels of bias safely less than thestatistical power of des sv data. we recommend a final gaussian prior for thephoto-z bias in the mean of $n(z)$ of width $0.05$ for each of the threetomographic bins, and show that this is a sufficient bias model for thecorresponding cosmology analysis.

1508.02861	the alhambra survey : estimation of the clustering signal encoded in the  cosmic variance	the relative cosmic variance ($\sigma_v$) is a fundamental source ofuncertainty in pencil-beam surveys and, as a particular case of count-in-cellstatistics, can be used to estimate the bias between galaxies and theirunderlying dark-matter distribution. our goal is to test the significance ofthe clustering information encoded in the $\sigma_v$ measured in the alhambrasurvey. we measure the cosmic variance of several galaxy populations selectedwith $b-$band luminosity at $0.35 \leq z &lt; 1.05$ as the intrinsic dispersion inthe number density distribution derived from the 48 alhambra subfields. wecompare the observational $\sigma_v$ with the cosmic variance of the darkmatter expected from the theory, $\sigma_{v,{\rm dm}}$. this provides anestimation of the galaxy bias $b$. the galaxy bias from the cosmic variance isin excellent agreement with the bias estimated by two-point correlationfunction analysis in alhambra. this holds for different redshift bins, for redand blue subsamples, and for several $b-$band luminosity selections. we findthat $b$ increases with the $b-$band luminosity and the redshift, as expectedfrom previous work. moreover, red galaxies have a larger bias than bluegalaxies, with a relative bias of $b_{\rm rel} = 1.4 \pm 0.2$. our resultsdemonstrate that the cosmic variance measured in alhambra is due to theclustering of galaxies and can be used to characterise the $\sigma_v$ affectingpencil-beam surveys. in addition, it can also be used to estimate the galaxybias $b$ from a method independent of correlation functions.

astro-ph;0004091	cfht optical pdcs survey ii: evolution in the space density of clusters  of galaxies	we present the first dynamical study of the optically selected palomardistant cluster survey (pdcs). we show that eleven out of twelve pdcs clusterswe observed are real over-densities of galaxies. most clusters have velocitydispersions appropriate for clusters of galaxies. however, we find a fraction(1/3) of objects in the pdcs which have velocity dispersions in the range ofgroups of galaxies (200 +/- 100 km/s) but have richnesses appropriate forclusters of galaxies.  we measure the richness function, x-ray luminosity function (using both thedetections and upper limits), and the mass function derived from our velocitydispersions. we confirm that the space density, as a function of richness, ofclusters of galaxies in the pdcs is ~5 times that of the abell catalog.excluding the above fraction of 1/3 of objects with low velocity dispersions,we measure a space density ~3 times that of the abell catalog for equivalentmass clusters of galaxies. our space density estimates are in agreement withother low-redshift, optically-selected cluster surveys such as the edcc, apmand edcc2, which raises the possibility that the abell catalog is incomplete.our x-ray luminosity function agrees with other measurements based on bothx-ray and optically selected samples, so we find that the pdcs does not missclusters of galaxies that would be found in an x-ray selected survey. ourresulting mass function, centered around 10e14 msun/h, agrees with theexpectations from such surveys as the canadian network for observationalcosmology cluster survey, though errors on our mass measurements are too largeto constrain cosmological parameters.

astro-ph;0110344	early-type galaxies in the sdss	a sample of nearly 9000 early-type galaxies, in the redshift range0.01&lt;z&lt;0.3, was selected from the sloan digital sky survey using morphologicaland spectral criteria. the sample was used to study how early-type galaxyobservables, including luminosity l, effective radius r, surface brightness i,color, and velocity dispersion v, are correlated with one another. measurementbiases are understood with mock catalogs which reproduce all of the observedscaling relations. at any given redshift, the intrinsic distribution ofluminosities, sizes and velocity dispersions in our sample are allapproximately gaussian. in the r* band l ~ v^3.91, l ~ r^1.58, r ~ i^(-0.75),and the fundamental plane relation is r ~ v^(1.49) i^(-0.75). these relationsare approximately the same in the g*, i* and z* bands. at fixed luminosity, themass-to-light ratio scales as m/l ~ l^0.14. the g*-r* color scales as v^0.25.color also correlates with magnitude and size, but these correlations areentirely due to the l-v and r-v relations. chemical evolution and starformation histories are investigated using co-added spectra of similar objectsin our sample. chemical abundances correlate primarily with velocitydispersion. at fixed v, the higher redshift population is bluer, is weaker inmg2, and is stronger in hbeta than the population nearby. in addition, thepopulation at higher redshifts is slightly more luminous. these differences areconsistent with that of a passively evolving population which formed the bulkof its stars about 9 gyrs ago. the fundamental plane suggests that galaxies indense regions are slightly different from those in less dense regions, but theco-added spectra and color--magnitude relations show no statisticallysignificant dependence on environment.

astro-ph;0301584	high redshift x-ray selected quasars: cxocy j125304.0-090737 joins the  club	we present a new x-ray selected high redshift quasar cxocy j125304.0-090737at z=4.179, discovered by the calan-yale deep extragalactic research (cyder)survey. this quasar is the fifth x-ray selected high redshift radio quietquasar ($z&gt;4$) found so far. here, we present its observed properties which arecharacterized by its relative optical and x-ray faintness, its x-ray hardnessand its x-ray strength compared to optically selected quasars at high redshift.we also compare the x-ray selected high redshift radio quiet quasars to theiroptically selected counterparts. we find that the optical to x-ray spectralslope, $\alpha_{ox}$, is statistically harder (more x-ray luminous) for thex-ray selected radio quiet quasars than for the optically selected ones. thisresult, given the different range of rest frame ultraviolet luminositiesstudied and the selection of the samples, is consistent with the previouslyfound correlation between x-ray and rest frame ultraviolet luminosities andwould extend that result to a much wider luminosity range at high redshift.finally, we discuss the prospects of unveiling the quasar luminosity functionat high redshifts using x-ray surveys. the discovery of a high redshift objectin the first field of our survey program provides suggestive evidence thatx-ray selected surveys may identify more such objects than would be expectedfrom an extrapolation of the optical luminosity function.

astro-ph;0310809	exploring the selection of galaxy clusters and groups: an optical survey  for x-ray dark clusters	data from a new, wide field, coincident optical and x-ray survey, the x-raydark cluster survey (xdcs) are presented. this survey comprises simultaneousand independent searches for clusters of galaxies in the optical and x-raypassbands. optical cluster detection algorithms implemented on the data aredetailed. two distinct optically selected catalogues are constructed, one basedon i-band overdensity, the other on overdensities of colour-selected galaxies.the superior accuracy of the colour-selection technique over that of the singlepassband method is demonstrated, via internal consistency checks and comparisonwith external spectroscopic redshift information. this is compared with anx-ray selected cluster catalogue. in terms of gross numbers, the survey yields185 i-band selected, 290 colour selected and 15 x-ray selected systems,residing in ~11deg^2 of optical + x-ray imaging. the relationship betweenoptical richness/ luminosity and x-ray luminosity is examined, by measuringx-ray luminosities at the positions of our 290 colour-selected systems. powerlaw correlations between the optical richness/ luminosity versus x-rayluminosity are fitted, both exhibiting approximately 0.2 dex of intrinsicscatter. interesting outliers in these correlations are discussed in greaterdetail. spectroscopic follow up of a subsample of x-ray underluminous systemsconfirms their reality.

astro-ph;0310857	the neutral ism in nearby luminous compact blue galaxies	we observed 20 nearby luminous compact blue galaxies (lcbgs) in hi andco(j=2-1) with the gbt and jcmt. these ~l^star galaxies are blue, high surfacebrightness, starbursting, high metallicity galaxies with an underlying olderstellar population. they are common at z~1, but rare in the local universe. ithas been proposed that intermediate redshift lcbgs may be the progenitors oflocal dwarf ellipticals or low luminosity spirals, or that they may be moremassive disks forming from the center outward to become l^star galaxies. todiscriminate among various possible evolutionary scenarios, we have measuredthe dynamical masses and gas depletion time scales of this sample of nearbylcbgs.  we find that local lcbgs span a wide range of dynamical masses, from 4 x 10^9to 1 x 10^11 m_solar (measured within r_25). molecular gas in local lcbgs isdepleted quite quickly, in 30 to 200 million years. the molecular plus atomicgas is depleted in 30 million to 10 billion years; however, ~80% of the locallcbgs deplete their gas in less than 5 billion years. as lcbgs areheterogeneous in both dynamical mass and gas depletion time scales, they arenot likely to evolve into one homogeneous galaxy class.

astro-ph;0312427	a gravitationally lensed quasar with quadruple images separated by 14.62  arcseconds	gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for the study of the distribution ofdark matter in the universe. the cold-dark-matter model of the formation oflarge-scale structures predicts the existence of quasars gravitationally lensedby concentrations of dark matter so massive that the quasar images would besplit by over 7 arcsec. numerous searches for large-separation lensed quasarshave, however, been unsuccessful. all of the roughly 70 lensed quasars known,including the first lensed quasar discovered, have smaller separations that canbe explained in terms of galaxy-scale concentrations of baryonic matter.although gravitationally lensed galaxies with large separations are known,quasars are more useful cosmological probes because of the simplicity of theresulting lens systems. here we report the discovery of a lensed quasar, sdssj1004+4112, which has a maximum separation between the components of 14.62arcsec. such a large separation means that the lensing object must be dominatedby dark matter. our results are fully consistent with theoretical expectationsbased on the cold-dark-matter model.

astro-ph;0501171	detection of the baryon acoustic peak in the large-scale correlation  function of sdss luminous red galaxies	we present the large-scale correlation function measured from a spectroscopicsample of 46,748 luminous red galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey. thesurvey region covers 0.72 h^{-3} gpc^3 over 3816 square degrees and0.16&lt;z&lt;0.47, making it the best sample yet for the study of large-scalestructure. we find a well-detected peak in the correlation function at100h^{-1} mpc separation that is an excellent match to the predicted shape andlocation of the imprint of the recombination-epoch acoustic oscillations on thelow-redshift clustering of matter. this detection demonstrates the lineargrowth of structure by gravitational instability between z=1000 and the presentand confirms a firm prediction of the standard cosmological theory. theacoustic peak provides a standard ruler by which we can measure the ratio ofthe distances to z=0.35 and z=1089 to 4% fractional accuracy and the absolutedistance to z=0.35 to 5% accuracy. from the overall shape of the correlationfunction, we measure the matter density omega_mh^2 to 8% and find agreementwith the value from cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropies. independentof the constraints provided by the cmb acoustic scale, we find omega_m = 0.273+- 0.025 + 0.123 (1+w_0) + 0.137 omega_k. including the cmb acoustic scale, wefind that the spatial curvature is omega_k=-0.010+-0.009 if the dark energy isa cosmological constant. more generally, our results provide a measurement ofcosmological distance, and hence an argument for dark energy, based on ageometric method with the same simple physics as the microwave backgroundanisotropies. the standard cosmological model convincingly passes these new androbust tests of its fundamental properties.

astro-ph;0501442	the dark clump near abell 1942: dark matter halo or statistical fluke?	weak lensing surveys provide the possibility of identifying dark matter halosbased on their total matter content rather than just the luminous mattercontent. on the basis of two sets of observations carried out with the cfht,erben et al. (2000) presented the first candidate dark clump, i.e. a darkmatter concentration identified by its significant weak lensing signal withouta corresponding galaxy overdensity or x-ray emission.  we present a set of hst mosaic observations which confirms the presence of analignment signal at the dark clump position. the signal strength, however, isweaker than in the ground-based data. it is therefore still unclear whether thesignal is caused by a lensing mass or is just a chance alignment. we alsopresent chandra observations of the dark clump, which fail to reveal anysignificant extended emission.  a comparison of the ellipticity measurements from the space-based hst dataand the ground-based cfht data shows a remarkable agreement on average,demonstrating that weak lensing studies from high-quality ground-basedobservations yield reliable results.

astro-ph;9508042	the deficit of distant galaxy clusters in the rixos x-ray survey	clusters of galaxies are the largest gravitationally bound systems andtherefore provide an important way of studying the formation and evolution ofthe large scale structure of the universe. cluster evolution can be inferredfrom observations of the x-ray emission of the gas in distant clusters, butinterpreting these data is not straightforward. in a simplified view, clustersgrow from perturbations in the matter distribution: their intracluster gas iscompressed and shock-heated by the gravitational collapse$^{1}$. the resultingx-ray emission is determined by the hydrostatic equilibrium of the gas in thechanging gravitational potential. however, if processes such as radiativecooling or pre-collapse heating of the gas are important, then the x-rayevolution will be strongly influenced by the thermal history of the gas. herewe present the first results from a faint flux-limited sample of x-ray selectedclusters compiled as part of the rosat international x-ray and optical survey(rixos). very few distant clusters have been identified. most importantly,their redshift distribution appears to be inconsistent with simple models basedon the evolution of the gravitational potential. our results suggest thatradiative cooling or non-gravitational heating of the intracluster gas mustplay an important role in the evolution of clusters.

astro-ph;9705099	a dynamical study of optically selected distant clusters	we present a programme of spectroscopic observations of galaxies in a sampleof optically-selected clusters taken from the catalogue of couch et al (1991).previous rosat observations of these clusters have shown them to have lowerx-ray luminosities, given their optical richness, than might be expected on thebasis of local samples. in the present paper we extend this work by determiningvelocity dispersions of a subsample of the clusters. we confirm the dynamicalreality of all but one of the original sample, and find velocity dispersionscomparable with present-day clusters of equivalent comoving space density.thus, in the context of the $l_x-\sigma$ relation for present-day clusters,there is evidence for a higher velocity dispersion at fixed x-ray luminosity.  a key question is whether the high velocity dispersions are indicative of thegravitational potential. if they are, the x-ray luminosities measured in boweret al., 1994 (paper i), would then imply an implausibly low efficiency of x-raygeneration. alternatively, the discrepancy could be explained if the clusterswere systems of lower virial temperature, in which the apparent velocitydispersion is inflated by an infalling, unrelaxed halo. this might resulteither from an increase with redshift in the infall rate for clusters, or fromthe preferential selection of clusters embedded in filaments oriented along theline of sight. since clusters with similar properties can be found in localoptically selected catalogues, we suggest that the latter explanation is morelikely.

astro-ph;9802153	a deficit of high-redshift, high-luminosity x-ray clusters: evidence for  a high value of omega_m?	from the press-schechter mass function and the empirical x-ray clusterluminosity-temperature (l-t) relation, we construct an x-ray cluster luminosityfunction that can be applied to the growing number of high-redshift, x-raycluster luminosity catalogs to constrain cosmological parameters. in thispaper, we apply this luminosity function to the einstein medium sensitivitysurvey (emss) and the rosat brightest cluster sample (bcs) luminosity functionto constrain the value of omega_m. in the case of the emss, we find a factor of4 - 5 fewer x-ray clusters at redshifts above z = 0.4 than below this redshiftat luminosities above l_x = 7 x 10^44 erg s^-1 (0.3 - 3.5 kev), which suggeststhat the x-ray cluster luminosity function has evolved above l_*. at lowerluminosities, this luminosity function evolves only minimally, if at all. usingbayesian inference, we find that the degree of evolution at high luminositiessuggests that omega_m = 0.96(+0.36,-0.32), given the best-fit l-t relation ofreichart, castander, &amp; nichol (1998). when we account for the uncertainty inhow the empirical l-t relation evolves with redshift, we find that omega_m isapproximately 1.0 +/- 0.4. however, it is unclear to what degree systematiceffects may affect this and similarly obtained results.

0812.3568	optimal filter systems for photometric redshift estimation	in the next years, several cosmological surveys will rely on imaging data toestimate the redshift of galaxies, using traditional filter systems with 4-5optical broad bands; narrower filters improve the spectral resolution, butstrongly reduce the total system throughput. we explore how photometricredshift performance depends on the number of filters n_f, characterizing thesurvey depth through the fraction of galaxies with unambiguous redshiftestimates. for a combination of total exposure time and telescope imaging areaof 270 hrs m^2, 4-5 filter systems perform significantly worse, both incompleteness depth and precision, than systems with n_f &gt;= 8 filters. ourresults suggest that for low n_f, the color-redshift degeneracies overwhelm theimprovements in photometric depth, and that even at higher n_f, the effectivephotometric redshift depth decreases much more slowly with filter width thannaively expected from the reduction in s/n. adding near-ir observationsimproves the performance of low n_f systems, but still the system whichmaximizes the photometric redshift completeness is formed by 9 filters withlogarithmically increasing bandwidth (constant resolution) and half-bandoverlap, reaching ~0.7 mag deeper, with 10% better redshift precision, than 4-5filter systems. a system with 20 constant-width, non-overlapping filtersreaches only ~0.1 mag shallower than 4-5 filter systems, but has a precisionalmost 3 times better, dz = 0.014(1+z) vs. dz = 0.042(1+z). we briefly discussa practical implementation of such a photometric system: the alhambra survey.
