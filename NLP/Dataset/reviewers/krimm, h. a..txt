0902.1985	disentangling the system geometry of the supergiant fast x-ray transient  igr j11215-5952 with swift	igr j11215-5952 is a hard x-ray transient discovered in 2005 april byintegral and a member of the new class of hmxb, the supergiant fast x-raytransients (sfxts). while integral and rxte observations have shown that theoutbursts occur with a periodicity of ~330 days, swift data have recentlydemonstrated that the true outburst period is ~165 days. igr j11215-5952 is thefirst discovered sfxt displaying periodic outbursts, which are possibly relatedto the orbital period. we performed a guest investigator observation with swiftthat lasted 20ks and several follow-up target of opportunity (too)observations, for a total of ~32ks, during the expected "apastron" passage(defined assuming an orbital period of ~330 days), between 2008 june 16 andjuly 4. the characteristics of this "apastron'' outburst are quite similar tothose previously observed during the "periastron'' outburst of 2007 february 9.the mean spectrum of the bright peaks can be fit with an absorbed power lawmodel with a photon index of 1 and an absorbing column of 1e22 cm^-2. thisoutburst reached luminosities of ~1e36 erg/s (1-10kev), comparable with theones measured in 2007. the light curve can be modelled with the parametersobtained by sidoli et al. (2007) for the 2007 february 9 outburst, althoughsome differences can be observed in its shape. the properties of the rise tothis new outburst and the comparison with the previous outbursts allow us tosuggest that the true orbital period of igr j11215-5952 is very likely 164.6days, and that the orbit is eccentric, with the different outbursts produced atthe periastron passage, when the neutron star crosses the inclined equatorialwind from the supergiant companion. based on a too observation performed on2008 march 25-27, we can exclude that the period is 165/2 days.

0902.1988	swift and supergiant fast x-ray transients: a novel monitoring approach	we describe our monitoring strategy which best exploits the sensitivity andflexibility of swift to study the long-term behaviour of supergiant fast x-raytransients (sfxts). we present observations of the recent outbursts from twoobjects of this class. igr j16479-4514, underwent an outburst on 2008 march 19,reaching a peak luminosity of about 6e37 erg/s (0.5-100kev; at a distance of4.9 kpc). we obtained a simultaneous broad-band spectrum (0.3-100 kev), thefirst for the sfxt class, which is fit with a heavily absorbed (column density5e22 cm^-2) hard power-law with a high energy cut-off at about 7kev. thisspectrum shows properties similar to the ones of accreting pulsars, although nox-ray pulsations were found. igr j11215-5952, one of the only two periodic sfxtknown to date, was observed with swift several times, first with an intense23-day long monitoring campaign around the 2007 february 9 outburst; then witha 26-day long monitoring around the unexpected july 24 outburst; finally with adeep exposure during the 2008 june 16 outburst. we present the whole dataset,which also includes observations which allowed us to firmly establish theoutburst period at p~165 days. thanks to our combined observations commoncharacteristics to this class of objects are emerging, i.e., outburst lengthswell in excess of hours, often with a multiple peaked structure, dynamic range~3 orders of magnitude, and periodicities are starting to be found.

0904.0261	looking into the fireball: rotse-iii and swift observations of early grb  afterglows	we report on a complete set of early optical afterglows of gamma-ray bursts(grbs) obtained with the rotse-iii telescope network from march 2005 throughjune 2007. this set is comprised of 12 afterglows with early optical andswift/xrt observations, with a median rotse-iii response time of 45 s after thestart of gamma-ray emission (8 s after the gcn notice time). these afterglowsspan four orders of magnitude in optical luminosity, and the contemporaneousx-ray detections allow multi-wavelength spectral analysis. excluding x-rayflares, the broadband synchrotron spectra show that the optical and x-rayemission originate in a common region, consistent with predictions of theexternal forward shock in the fireball model. however, the fireball model isinadequate to predict the temporal decay indices of the early afterglows, evenafter accounting for possible long-duration continuous energy injection. wefind that the optical afterglow is a clean tracer of the forward shock, and weuse the peak time of the forward shock to estimate the initial bulk lorentzfactor of the grb outflow, and find 100&lt;gamma_0&lt;1000, consistent withexpectations.

0905.2815	supergiant fast x-ray transients in outburst: new swift observations of  xtej1739-302, igrj17544-2619, and igrj08408-4503	we report on new x-ray outbursts observed with swift from three supergiantfast x-ray transients (sfxts): xtej1739-302, igrj17544-2619 and igrj08408-4503.the former two outbursts were caught during the monitoring campaign we havebeen performing with the swift satellite since october 2007: xtej1739-302underwent a new outburst on 2008, august 13, igrj17544-2619 on 2008, september4, while igrj08408-4503 on 2008, september 21. while xtej1739-302 andigrj08408-4503 bright emission triggered the swift/burst alert telescope,igrj17544-2619 did not, thus we could perform a spectral investigation only ofthe spectrum below 10 kev. the broad band spectra from xtej1739-302 andigrj08408-4503 were compatible with the x-ray spectral shape displayed duringthe previous flares. a variable absorbing column density during the flare wasobserved in xtej1739-302 for the first time. the broad band spectrum ofigrj08408-4503 requires the presence of two distinct photon populations, a coldone (0.3 kev) most likely from a thermal halo around the neutron star and ahotter one (1.4-1.8 kev) from the accreting column. the outburst fromxtej1739-302 could be monitored with a very good sampling, thus revealing ashape which can be explained with a second wind component in this sfxt, inanalogy to what we have suggested in the periodic sfxt igrj11215-5952. theoutburst recurrence timescale in igrj17544-2619 during our monitoring campaignwith swift suggests a long orbital period of ~150 days (in an highly eccentricorbit), compatible with what previously observed with integral.

0906.1577	a glimpse of the end of the dark ages: the gamma-ray burst of 23 april  2009 at redshift 8.3	it is thought that the first generations of massive stars in the universewere an important, and quite possibly dominant, source of the ultra-violetradiation that reionized the hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium (igm); astate in which it has remained to the present day. measurements of cosmicmicrowave background anisotropies suggest that this phase-change largely tookplace in the redshift range z=10.8 +/- 1.4, while observations of quasars andlyman-alpha galaxies have shown that the process was essentially completed byz=6. however, the detailed history of reionization, and characteristics of thestars and proto-galaxies that drove it, remain unknown. further progress inunderstanding requires direct observations of the sources of ultra-violetradiation in the era of reionization, and mapping the evolution of the neutralhydrogen fraction through time. the detection of galaxies at such redshifts ishighly challenging, due to their intrinsic faintness and high luminositydistance, whilst bright quasars appear to be rare beyond z~7. here we reportthe discovery of a gamma-ray burst, grb 090423, at redshift z=8.26 -0.08 +0.07.this is well beyond the redshift of the most distant spectroscopicallyconfirmed galaxy (z=6.96) and quasar (z=6.43). it establishes that massivestars were being produced, and dying as grbs, ~625 million years after the bigbang. in addition, the accurate position of the burst pinpoints the location ofthe most distant galaxy known to date. larger samples of grbs beyond z~7 willconstrain the evolving rate of star formation in the early universe, whilerapid spectroscopy of their afterglows will allow direct exploration of theprogress of reionization with cosmic time.

0907.1289	monitoring supergiant fast x-ray transients with swift. results from the  first year	swift has allowed the possibility to give supergiant fast x-ray transients(sfxts), the new class of high mass x-ray binaries discovered by integral, nonserendipitous attention throughout all phases of their life. we present ourresults based on the first year of intense swift monitoring of four sfxts, igrj16479-4514, xte j1739-302, igr j17544-2619 and ax j1841.0-0536. we obtain thefirst assessment of how long each source spends in each state using asystematic monitoring with a sensitive instrument. the duty-cycle of inactivityis 17, 28, 39, 55% (5% uncertainty), for igr j16479-4514, ax j1841.0-0536, xtej1739-302, and igr j17544-2619, respectively, so that true quiescence is a rarestate. this demonstrates that these transients accrete matter throughout theirlife at different rates. ax j1841.0-0536 is the only source which has notundergone a bright outburst during our campaign. although individual sourcesbehave somewhat differently, common x-ray characteristics of this class areemerging such as outburst lengths well in excess of hours, with a multiplepeaked structure. a high dynamic range (including bright outbursts) of 4 ordersof magnitude has been observed. we performed out-of-outburst intensity-basedspectroscopy. spectral fits with an absorbed blackbody always result inblackbody radii of a few hundred meters, consistent with being emitted from asmall portion of the neutron star surface, very likely the neutron star polarcaps. we also present the uvot data of these sources.

0907.4041	the first broad-band x-ray study of the supergiant fast x-ray transient  saxj1818.6-1703 in outburst	the supergiant fast x-ray transient (sfxt) saxj1818.6-1703 underwent anoutburst on 2009 may 6 and was observed with swift. we report on theseobservations which, for the first time, allow us to study the broad-bandspectrum from soft to hard x-rays of this source. no x-ray spectral informationwas available on this source before the swift monitoring. the spectrum can bedeconvolved well with models usually adopted to describe the emission from highmass x-ray binary x-ray pulsars, and is characterized by a very highabsorption, a flat power law (photon index ~0.1-0.5) and a cutoff at about 7-12kev. alternatively, the saxj1818.6-1703 emission can be described with acomptonized emission from a cold and optically thick corona, with an electrontemperature kte=5-7 kev, a hot seed photon temperature, kt0, of 1.3-1.4 kev,and an optical depth for the comptonizing plasma of about 10. the 1-100 kevluminosity at the peak of the flare is 3e36 erg/s (assuming the opticalcounterpart distance of 2.5 kpc). these properties of saxj1818.6-1703 resemblethose of the prototype of the sfxt class, xtej1739-302. the monitoring withswift/xrt reveals an outburst duration of about 5 days, similarly to othermembers of the class of sfxts, confirming saxj1818.6-1703 as a member of thisclass.

0908.1335	testing the epeak - eiso relation for grbs detected by swift and  suzaku-wam	one of the most prominent, yet controversial associations derived from theensemble of prompt-phase observations of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) is theapparent correlation in the source frame between the peak energy epeak) of thenu-f(nu) spectrum and the isotropic radiated energy, eiso. since most gamma-raybursts (grbs) have epeak above the energy range (15-150 kev) of the burst alerttelescope (bat) on swift, determining accurate epeak values for large numbersof swift bursts has been difficult. however, by combining data from swift/batand the suzaku wide-band all-sky monitor (wam), which covers the energy rangefrom 50-5000 kev, for bursts which are simultaneously detected, one canaccurately fit epeak and eiso and test the relationship between them for theswift sample. between the launch of suzaku in july 2005 and the end of april2009, there were 48 gamma-ray bursts (grbs) which triggered both swift/bat andwam and an additional 48 bursts which triggered swift and were detected by wam,but did not trigger. a bat-wam team has cross-calibrated the two instrumentsusing grbs, and we are now able to perform joint fits on these bursts todetermine their spectral parameters. for those bursts with spectroscopicredshifts, we can also calculate the isotropic energy. here we present theresults of joint swift/bat-suzaku/wam spectral fits for 91 of the burstsdetected by the two instruments. we show that the distribution of spectral fitparameters is consistent with distributions from earlier missions and confirmthat swift bursts are consistent with earlier reported relationships betweenepeak and isotropic energy. we show through time-resolved spectroscopy thatindividual burst pulses are also consistent with this relationship.

0911.5544	discovery of a new soft gamma repeater: sgr j0418+5729	on 2009 june 5, the gamma-ray burst monitor (gbm) onboard the fermi gamma-rayspace telescope triggered on two short, and relatively dim bursts with spectralproperties similar to soft gamma repeater (sgr) bursts. independentlocalizations of the bursts by triangulation with the konus-rf and with theswift satellite, confirmed their origin from the same, previously unknown,source. the subsequent discovery of x-ray pulsations with the rossi x-raytiming explorer (rxte), confirmed the magnetar nature of the new source, sgrj0418+5729. we describe here the fermi/gbm observations, the discovery and thelocalization of this new sgr, and our infrared and chandra x-ray observations.we also present a detailed temporal and spectral study of the two gbm bursts.sgr j0418+5729 is the second source discovered in the same region of the sky inthe last year, the other one being sgr j0501+4516. both sources lie in thedirection of the galactic anti-center and presumably at the nearby distance of~2 kpc (assuming they reside in the perseus arm of our galaxy). thenear-threshold gbm detection of bursts from sgr j0418+5729 suggests that theremay be more such dim sgrs throughout our galaxy, possibly exceeding thepopulation of bright sgrs. finally, using sample statistics, we conclude thatthe implications of the new sgr discovery on the number of observable activemagnetars in our galaxy at any given time is &lt;10, in agreement with our earlierestimates.

1001.1965	disentangling jet and disc emission from the 2005 outburst of xte  j1118+480	the black hole x-ray transient, xte j1118+480, has now twice been observed inoutburst - 2000 and 2005 - and on both occasions remained in the low/hard x-rayspectral state. here we present radio, infrared, optical, soft x-ray and hardx-ray observations of the more recent outburst. we find that the lightcurveshave very different morphologies compared with the 2000 event and the opticaldecay is delayed relative to the x-ray/radio. we attribute this lesser degreeof correlation to contributions of emission from multiple components, inparticular the jet and accretion disc. whereas the jet seemed to dominate thebroadband spectrum in 2000, in 2005 the accretion disc seems to be moreprominent and we use an analysis of the lightcurves and spectra to distinguishbetween the jet and disc emission. there also appears to be an optically thincomponent to the radio emission in the 2005 data, possibly associated withmultiple ejection events and decaying as the outburst proceeds. these resultsadd to the discussion that the term "low/hard state'" covers a wider range ofproperties than previously thought, if it is to account for xte j1118+480during these two outbursts.

1002.0581	grb 081008: from burst to afterglow and the transition phase in between	we present a multi-wavelength study of grb 081008, at redshift 1.967, byswift, rotse-iii and grond. compared to other swift grbs, grb 081008 has atypical gamma-ray isotropic equivalent energy output (10^53 erg) during theprompt phase, and displayed two temporally separated clusters of pulses. theearly x-ray emission seen by the swift/xrt was dominated by the softening tailof the prompt emission, producing multiple flares during and after theswift/bat detections. optical observations that started shortly after the firstactive phase of gamma-ray emission showed two consecutive peaks. we interpretthe first optical peak as the onset of the afterglow associated with the earlyburst activities. a second optical peak, coincident with the later gamma-raypulses, imposes a small modification to the otherwise smooth lightcurve andthus suggests a minimal contribution from a probable internal component. wesuggest the early optical variability may be from continuous energy injectioninto the forward shock front by later shells producing the second epoch ofburst activities. these early observations thus provide a potential probe forthe transition from prompt to the afterglow phase. the later lightcurve of grb081008 displays a smooth steepening in all optical bands and x-ray. thetemporal break is consistent with being achromatic at the observed wavelengths.our broad energy coverage shortly after the break constrains a spectral breakwithin optical. however, the evolution of the break frequency is not observed.we discuss the plausible interpretations of this behavior.

0707.4626	the first swift bat gamma-ray burst catalog	we present the first swift burst alert telescope (bat) catalog of gamma-raybursts (grbs), which contains bursts detected by the bat between 2004 december19 and 2007 june 16. this catalog (hereafter bat1 catalog) contains bursttrigger time, location, 90% error radius, duration, fluence, peak flux, andtime averaged spectral parameters for each of 237 grbs, as measured by the bat.the bat-determined position reported here is within 1.75' of the swift x-raytelescope (xrt)-determined position for 90% of these grbs. the bat t_90 andt_50 durations peak at 80 and 20 seconds, respectively. from thefluence-fluence correlation, we conclude that about 60% of the observed peakenergies, epeak, of bat grbs could be less than 100 kev. we confirm that grbfluence to hardness and grb peak flux to hardness are correlated for bat burstsin analogous ways to previous missions' results. the correlation between thephoton index in a simple power-law model and epeak is also confirmed. we alsoreport the current status for the on-orbit bat calibrations based onobservations of the crab nebula.

1011.4079	search for gravitational wave bursts from six magnetars	soft gamma repeaters (sgrs) and anomalous x-ray pulsars (axps) are thought tobe magnetars: neutron stars powered by extreme magnetic fields. these rareobjects are characterized by repeated and sometimes spectacular gamma-raybursts. the burst mechanism might involve crustal fractures and excitation ofnon-radial modes which would emit gravitational waves (gws). we present theresults of a search for gw bursts from six galactic magnetars that is sensitiveto neutron star f-modes, thought to be the most efficient gw emittingoscillatory modes in compact stars. one of them, sgr 0501+4516, is likely ~1kpc from earth, an order of magnitude closer than magnetars targeted inprevious gw searches. a second, axp 1e 1547.0-5408, gave a burst with anestimated isotropic energy &gt;10^{44} erg which is comparable to the giantflares. we find no evidence of gws associated with a sample of 1279electromagnetic triggers from six magnetars occurring between november 2006 andjune 2009, in gw data from the ligo, virgo, and geo600 detectors. our lowestmodel-dependent gw emission energy upper limits for band- and time-limitedwhite noise bursts in the detector sensitive band, and for f-mode ringdowns (at1090 hz), are 3.0x10^{44} d_1^2 erg and 1.4x10^{47} d_1^2 erg respectively,where d_1 = d_{0501} / 1 kpc and d_{0501} is the distance to sgr 0501+4516.these limits on gw emission from f-modes are an order of magnitude lower thanany previous, and approach the range of electromagnetic energies seen in sgrgiant flares for the first time.

1012.0028	confirmation of the supergiant fast x-ray transient nature of ax  j1841.0-0536 from swift outburst observations	swift observed an outburst from the supergiant fast x-ray transients (sfxt)ax j1841.0-0536 on 2010 june 5, and followed it with xrt for 11 days. the x-raylight curve shows an initial flare followed by a decay and subsequent increase,as often seen in other sfxts, and a dynamical range of ~1600. our observationsallow us to analyse the simultaneous broad-band (0.3-100 kev) spectrum of thissource, for the first time down to 0.3 kev, can be fitted well with modelsusually adopted to describe the emission from accreting neutron stars inhigh-mass x-ray binaries, and is characterized by a high absorption(n_h~2x10^22 cm-2), a flat power law (gamma~0.2), and a high energy cutoff. allof these properties resemble those of the prototype of the class, igrj17544-2619, which underwent an outburst on 2010 march 4, whose observations wealso discuss. we show how well ax j1841.0-0536 fits in the sfxt class, based onits observed properties during the 2010 outburst, its large dynamical range inx-ray luminosity, the similarity of the light curve (length and shape) to thoseof the other sfxts observed by swift, and the x-ray broad-band spectralproperties.

0709.1693	discovery of the accretion-powered millisecond pulsar swift j1756.9-2508  with a low-mass companion	we report on the discovery by the swift gamma-ray burst explorer of theeighth known transient accretion-powered millisecond pulsar, swiftj1756.9-2508, as part of routine observations with the swift burst alerttelescope hard x-ray transient monitor. the pulsar was subsequently observed byboth the x-ray telescope on swift and the rossi x-ray timing explorerproportional counter array. it has a spin frequency of 182 hz (5.5 ms) and anorbital period of 54.7 minutes. the minimum companion mass is between 0.0067and 0.0086 solar masses, depending on the mass of the neutron star, and theupper limit on the mass is 0.030 solar masses (95% confidence level). such alow mass is inconsistent with brown dwarf models, and comparison with whitedwarf models suggests that the companion is a he-dominated donor whose thermalcooling has been at least modestly slowed by irradiation from the accretionflux. no x-ray bursts, dips, eclipses or quasi-periodic oscillations weredetected. the current outburst lasted approximately 13 days and no earlieroutbursts were found in archival data.

1101.6055	swift follow-up observations of maxi discovered galactic transients	we describe the results of the first year of a program to localize newgalactic transient sources discovered by maxi with nasa's swift mission. swiftis ideally suited for follow-up of maxi discovered transients as its x-raytelescope (xrt) field of view (~0.2 degrees radius) is closely matched to thetypical maxi error circle. the xrt is capable of localizing new sources to anaccuracy of up to 1.5 arc-seconds radius (90% confidence), and the swiftoptical/uv telescope also provides optical imaging of any optical counterpartof the x-ray source. if no optical counterpart is found with swift (usually dueto absorption), the xrt position is good enough to allow for ground based irtelescopes to positively identify the optical counterpart. althoughlocalization and identification of maxi transients is the main aim of theprogram, these are often followed up by long term monitoring of the source. wepresent here results from 2 of these monitoring programs: the black-holecandidate maxi j1659-152, and the be/x-ray binary candidate maxi j1409-619.

1103.3647	agile detection of extreme gamma-ray activity from the blazar pks  1510-089 during march 2009. multifrequency analysis	we report on the extreme gamma-ray activity from the fsrq pks 1510-089observed by agile in march 2009. in the same period a radio-to-opticalmonitoring of the source was provided by the gasp-webt and rem. moreover,several swift too observations were triggered, adding important information onthe source behaviour from optical/uv to hard x-rays. we paid particularattention to the calibration of the swift/uvot data to make it suitable to theblazars spectra. simultaneous observations from radio to gamma rays allowed usto study in detail the correlation among the emission variability at differentfrequencies and to investigate the mechanisms at work. in the period 9-30 march2009, agile detected an average gamma-ray flux of (311+/-21)x10^-8 ph cm^-2s^-1 for e&gt;100 mev, and a peak level of (702+/-131)x10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 ondaily integration. the gamma-ray activity occurred during a period ofincreasing activity from near-ir to uv, with a flaring episode detected on26-27 march 2009, suggesting that a single mechanism is responsible for theflux enhancement observed from near-ir to uv. by contrast, swift/xrtobservations seem to show no clear correlation of the x-ray fluxes with theoptical and gamma-ray ones. however, the x-ray observations show a harderphoton index (1.3-1.6) with respect to most fsrqs and a hint ofharder-when-brighter behaviour, indicating the possible presence of a secondemission component at soft x-ray energies. moreover, the broad band spectrumfrom radio-to-uv confirmed the evidence of thermal features in the optical/uvspectrum of pks 1510-089 also during high gamma-ray state. on the other hand,during 25-26 march 2009 a flat spectrum in the optical/uv energy band wasobserved, suggesting an important contribution of the synchrotron emission inthis part of the spectrum during the brightest gamma-ray flare, therefore asignificant shift of the synchrotron peak.

1104.0796	swift observations of black hole candidate xte j1752-223 during outburst	here we summarise the swift broadband observations of the recently discoveredx-ray transient and black hole candidate, xte j1752-223,obtained over theperiod of outburst from october 2009 to june 2010. we offer a phenomenologicaltreatment of the spectra as an indication of the canonical spectral state ofthe source during different periods of the outburst. we find that the highenergy hardness-intensity diagrams over two separate bands follows thecanonical behavior, confirming the spectral states. from swift-uvot data weconfirm the presence of an optical counterpart which displays variabilitycorrelated, in the soft state, to the x-ray emission observed by swift-xrt. theoptical counterpart also displays hysteretical behaviour between the states notnormally observed in the optical bands, suggesting a possible contribution froma synchrotron emitting jet to the optical emission in the rising hard state.our xrt timing analysis shows that in the hard state there is significantvariability below 10hz which is more pronounced at low energies, while duringthe soft state the level of variability is consistent with being minimal.theseproperties of xte j1752-223 support its candidacy as a black hole in thegalactic centre region.

1104.4689	the second swift bat gamma-ray burst catalog	we present the second swift burst alert telescope (bat) catalog of gamma-raybursts (grbs), which contains 476 bursts detected by the bat between 2004december 19 and 2009 december 21. this catalog (hereafter the bat2 catalog)presents burst trigger time, location, 90% error radius, duration, fluence,peak flux, time-averaged spectral parameters and time-resolved spectralparameters measured by the bat. in the correlation study of various observedparameters extracted from the bat prompt emission data, we distinguish amonglong-duration grbs (l-grbs), short-duration grbs (s-grbs), and short-durationgrbs with extended emission (s-grbs with e.e.) to investigate differences inthe prompt emission properties. the fraction of l-grbs, s-grbs and s-grbs withe.e. in the catalog are 89%, 8% and 2% respectively. we compare the bat promptemission properties with the batse, bepposax and hete-2 grb samples. we alsocorrelate the observed prompt emission properties with the redshifts for thegrbs with known redshift. the bat t90 and t50 durations peak at 70 s and 30 s,respectively. we confirm that the spectra of the bat s-grbs are generallyharder than those of the l-grbs. the time-averaged spectra of the bat s-grbswith e.e. are similar to those of the l-grbs. whereas, the spectra of theinitial short spikes of the s-grbs with e.e. are similar to those of thes-grbs. we show that the bat grb samples are significantly softer than thebatse bright grbs, and that the time-averaged epeak of the bat grbs peaks at 80kev which is significantly lower energy than those of the batse sample whichpeak at 320 kev. the time-averaged spectral properties of the bat grb sampleare similar to those of the hete-2 grb samples. by time-resolved spectralanalysis, we find that only 10% of the bat observed photon indices are outsidethe allowed region of the synchrotron shock model.

1104.4787	discovery of the onset of rapid accretion by a dormant massive black  hole	massive black holes are believed to reside at the centres of most galaxies.they can be- come detectable by accretion of matter, either continuously from alarge gas reservoir or impulsively from the tidal disruption of a passing star,and conversion of the gravitational energy of the infalling matter to light.continuous accretion drives active galactic nuclei (agn), which are known to bevariable but have never been observed to turn on or off. tidal disruption ofstars by dormant massive black holes has been inferred indirectly but the on-set of a tidal disruption event has never been observed. here we report thefirst discovery of the onset of a relativistic accretion-powered jet in the newextragalactic transient, swift j164449.3+573451. the behaviour of this newsource differs from both theoretical models of tidal disruption events andobservations of the jet-dominated agn known as blazars. these differences maystem from transient effects associated with the onset of a powerful jet. suchan event in the massive black hole at the centre of our milky way galaxy couldstrongly ionize the upper atmosphere of the earth, if beamed towards us.

1104.4801	discovery and evolution of the new black hole candidate swift  j1539.2-6227 during its 2008 outburst	we report on the discovery by the swift gamma-ray burst explorer of the blackhole candidate swift j1539.2-6227 and the subsequent course of an outburstbeginning in november 2008 and lasting at least seven months. the source wasdiscovered during normal observations with the swift burst alert telescope(bat) on 2008 november 25. an extended observing campaign with the rossi x-raytiming explorer (rxte) and swift provided near-daily coverage over 176 days,giving us a good opportunity to track the evolution of spectral and timingparameters with fine temporal resolution through a series of spectral states.the source was first detected in a hard state during which strong low-frequencyquasi-periodic oscillations (qpos) were detected. the qpos persisted for about35 days and a signature of the transition from the hard to soft intermediatestates was seen in the timing data. the source entered a short-lived thermalstate about 40 days after the start of the outburst. there were variations inspectral hardness as the source flux declined and returned to a hard state atthe end of the outburst. the progression of spectral states and the nature ofthe timing features provide strong evidence that swift j1539.2-6227 is acandidate black hole in a low-mass x-ray binary system.

1104.5228	swift observations of maxi j1659-152: a compact binary with a black hole  accretor	we report on the detection and follow-up high cadence monitoring observationsof maxi j1659-152, a bright galactic x-ray binary transient with a likelyblack-hole accretor, by swift over a 27 day period after its initial outburstdetection. maxi j1659-152 was discovered almost simultaneously by swift andmaxi on 2010 sept 25, and was monitored intensively from the early stages ofthe outburst through the rise to a brightness of ~0.5 crab by the swift xrt,uvot, and bat. we present temporal and spectral analysis of the swiftobservations. the broadband light-curves show variability characteristic ofblack-hole candidate transients. we present the evolution of thermal andnon-thermal components of the 0.5-150 kev combined x-ray spectra during theoutburst. maxi j1659-152 displays accretion state changes typically associatedwith black-hole binaries, transitioning from its initial detection in the hardstate, to the steep power-law state, followed by a slow evolution towards thethermal state, signified by an increasingly dominant thermal componentassociated with the accretion disk, although this state change did not completebefore swift observations ended. we observe an anti-correlation between theincreasing temperature and decreasing radius of the inner edge of the accretiondisk, suggesting that the inner edge of the accretion disk in-falls towards theblack-hole as the disk temperature increases. we observed significant evolutionin the absorption column during the initial rise of the outburst, with theabsorption almost doubling, suggestive of the presence of an evolving wind fromthe accretion disk. we detect quasi- periodic oscillations that evolve with theoutburst, as well as irregular shaped dips that recur with a period of2.42\pm0.09 hours, strongly suggesting an orbital period that would make maxij1659-152 the shortest period black-hole binary yet known.

1201.1678	disc-jet coupling in the 2009 outburst of the black hole candidate  h1743-322	we present an intensive radio and x-ray monitoring campaign on the 2009outburst of the galactic black hole candidate x-ray binary h1743-322. with thehigh angular resolution of the very long baseline array, we resolve the jetejection event and measure the proper motions of the jet ejecta relative to theposition of the compact core jets detected at the beginning of the outburst.this allows us to accurately couple the moment when the jet ejection eventoccurred with x-ray spectral and timing signatures. we find that x-ray timingsignatures are the best diagnostic of the jet ejection event in this outburst,which occurred as the x-ray variability began to decrease and the type cquasi-periodic oscillations disappeared from the x-ray power density spectrum.however, this sequence of events does not appear to be replicated in all blackhole x-ray binary outbursts, even within an individual source. in ourobservations of h1743-322, the ejection was contemporaneous with a quenching ofthe radio emission, prior to the start of the major radio flare. thiscontradicts previous assumptions that the onset of the radio flare marks themoment of ejection. the jet speed appears to vary between outbursts, with apossible positive correlation with outburst luminosity. the compact core radiojet reactivated on transition to the hard intermediate state at the end of theoutburst, and not when the source reached the low hard spectral state.comparison with the known near-infrared behaviour of the compact jets suggestsa gradual evolution of the compact jet power over a few days near the beginningand end of an outburst.

1301.3522	the interplanetary network supplement to the fermi gbm catalog of cosmic  gamma-ray bursts	we present interplanetary network (ipn) data for the gamma-ray bursts in thefirst fermi gamma-ray burst monitor (gbm) catalog. of the 491 bursts in thatcatalog, covering 2008 july 12 to 2010 july 11, 427 were observed by at leastone other instrument in the 9-spacecraft ipn. of the 427, the localizations of149 could be improved by arrival time analysis (or triangulation). for anygiven burst observed by the gbm and one other distant spacecraft, triangulationgives an annulus of possible arrival directions whose half-width varies betweenabout 0.4' and 32 degrees, depending on the intensity, time history, andarrival direction of the burst, as well as the distance between the spacecraft.we find that the ipn localizations intersect the 1 sigma gbm error circles inonly 52% of the cases, if no systematic uncertainty is assumed for the latter.if a 6 degree systematic uncertainty is assumed and added in quadrature, thetwo localization samples agree about 87% of the time, as would be expected. ifwe then multiply the resulting error radii by a factor of 3, the two samplesagree in slightly over 98% of the cases, providing a good estimate of the gbm 3sigma error radius. the ipn 3 sigma error boxes have areas between about 1square arcminute and 110 square degrees, and are, on the average, a factor of180 smaller than the corresponding gbm localizations. we identify two bursts inthe ipn/gbm sample that did not appear in the gbm catalog. in one case, the gbmtriggered on a terrestrial gamma flash, and in the other, its origin was givenas uncertain. we also discuss the sensitivity and calibration of the ipn.

1304.3510	an evolving compact jet in the black hole x-ray binary maxi j1836-194	we report striking changes in the broadband spectrum of the compact jet ofthe black hole transient maxi j1836-194 over state transitions during itsdiscovery outburst in 2011. a fading of the optical-infrared (ir) flux occurredas the source entered the hard-intermediate state, followed by a brightening asit returned to the hard state. the optical-ir spectrum was consistent with apower law from optically thin synchrotron emission, except when the x-rayspectrum was softest. by fitting the radio to optical spectra with a brokenpower law, we constrain the frequency and flux of the optically thick/thinbreak in the jet synchrotron spectrum. the break gradually shifted to higherfrequencies as the source hardened at x-ray energies, from ~ 10^11 to ~ 4 x10^13 hz. the radiative jet luminosity integrated over the spectrum appeared tobe greatest when the source entered the hard state during the outburst decay(although this is dependent on the high energy cooling break, which is not seendirectly), even though the radio flux was fading at the time. the physicalprocess responsible for suppressing and reactivating the jet (neither of whichare instantaneous but occur on timescales of weeks) is uncertain, but couldarise from the varying inner accretion disk radius regulating the fraction ofaccreting matter that is channeled into the jet. this provides an unprecedentedinsight into the connection between inflow and outflow, and has implicationsfor the conditions required for jets to be produced, and hence their launchingprocess.

1308.4332	broadband monitoring tracing the evolution of the jet and disk in the  black hole candidate x-ray binary maxi j1659-152	maxi j1659-152 was discovered on 2010 september 25 as a new x-ray transient,initially identified as a gamma-ray burst, but was later shown to be a newx-ray binary with a black hole as the most likely compact object. dips in thex-ray light curves have revealed that maxi j1659-152 is the shortest periodblack hole candidate identified to date. here we present the results of a largeobserving campaign at radio, sub-millimeter, near-infrared (nir), optical andultraviolet (uv) wavelengths. we have combined this very rich data set with theavailable x-ray observations to compile a broadband picture of the evolution ofthis outburst. we have performed broadband spectral modeling, demonstrating thepresence of a spectral break at radio frequencies and a relationship betweenthe radio spectrum and x-ray states. also, we have determined physicalparameters of the accretion disk and put them into context with respect to theother parameters of the binary system. finally, we have investigated theradio-x-ray and nir/optical/uv-x-ray correlations up to ~3 years after theoutburst onset to examine the link between the jet and the accretion disk, andfound that there is no significant jet contribution to the nir emission whenthe source is in the soft or intermediate x-ray spectral state, consistent withour detection of the jet break at radio frequencies during these states.

1309.4926	the evolving polarised jet of black hole candidate swift j1745-26	swift j1745-26 is an x-ray binary towards the galactic centre that wasdetected when it went into outburst in september 2012. this source is thoughtto be one of a growing number of sources that display "failed outbursts", inwhich the self-absorbed radio jets of the transient source are never fullyquenched and the thermal emission from the geometrically-thin inner accretiondisk never fully dominates the x-ray flux. we present multifrequency data fromthe very large array, australia telescope compact array and karoo arraytelescope (kat- 7) radio arrays, spanning the entire period of the outburst.our rich data set exposes radio emission that displays a high level of largescale variability compared to the x-ray emission and deviations from thestandard radio--x-ray correlation that are indicative of an unstable jet andconfirm the outburst's transition from the canonical hard state to anintermediate state. we also observe steepening of the spectral index and anincrease of the linear polarization to a large fraction (~50%) of the totalflux, as well as a rotation of the electric vector position angle. these areconsistent with a transformation from a self-absorbed compact jet tooptically-thin ejecta -- the first time such a discrete ejection has beenobserved in a failed outburst -- and may imply a complex magnetic fieldgeometry.

0801.4319	global properties of x-ray flashes and x-ray-rich gamma-ray bursts  observed by swift	we describe and discuss the spectral and temporal characteristics of theprompt emission and x-ray afterglow emission of x-ray flashes (xrfs) andx-ray-rich gamma-ray bursts (xrrs) detected and observed by swift betweendecember 2004 and september 2006. we compare these characteristics to a sampleof conventional classical gamma-ray bursts (c-grbs) observed during the sameperiod. we confirm the correlation between epeak_obs and fluence noted byothers and find further evidence that xrfs, xrrs and c-grbs form a continuum.we also confirm that our known redshift sample is consistent with thecorrelation between the peak energy in the grb rest frame (epeak_src) and theisotropic radiated energy (eiso), so called the epeak_src-eiso relation. thespectral properties of x-ray afterglows of xrfs and c-grbs are similar, but thetemporal properties of xrfs and c-grbs are quite different. we found that thelight curves of c-grb afterglows show a break to steeper indices(shallow-to-steep break) at much earlier times than do xrf afterglows.moreover, the overall luminosity of xrf x-ray afterglows is systematicallysmaller by a factor of two or more compared to that of c-grbs. these distinctdifferences between the x-ray afterglows of xrfs and c-grbs may be the key tounderstanding not only the mysterious shallow-to-steep break in x-ray afterglowlight curves, but also the unique nature of xrfs.

1311.4164	long-term variability of agn at hard x-rays	variability at all observed wavelengths is a distinctive property of agn.hard x-rays provide us with a view of the innermost regions of agn, mostlyunbiased by absorption along the line of sight. swift/bat offers the uniqueopportunity to follow, on time scales of days to years and with a regularsampling, the 14-195 kev emission of the largest agn sample available up todate for this kind of investigation. we study the amplitude of the variations,and their dependence on sub-class and on energy, for a sample of 110 radioquiet and radio loud agn selected from the bat 58-month survey. about 80% ofthe agn in the sample are found to exhibit significant variability on months toyears time scales, radio loud sources being the most variable. the amplitude ofthe variations and their energy dependence are incompatible with variabilitybeing driven at hard x-rays by changes of the absorption column density. ingeneral, the variations in the 14-24 and 35-100 kev bands are well correlated,suggesting a common origin of the variability across the bat energy band.however, radio quiet agn display on average 10% larger variations at 14-24 kevthan at 35-100 kev and a softer-when-brighter behavior for most of the seyfertgalaxies with detectable spectral variability on month time scale. in addition,sources with harder spectra are found to be more variable than softer ones.these properties are generally consistent with a variable power law continuum,in flux and shape, pivoting at energies &gt;~ 50 kev, to which a constantreflection component is superposed. when the same time scales are considered,the timing properties of agn at hard x-rays are comparable to those at lowerenergies, with at least some of the differences possibly ascribable tocomponents contributing differently in the two energy domains (e.g.,reflection, absorption).

1311.5734	the ultraluminous grb 110918a	grb 110918a is the brightest long grb detected by konus-wind during its 19years of continuous observations and the most luminous grb ever observed sincethe beginning of the cosmological era in 1997. we report on the final ipnlocalization of this event and its detailed multiwavelength study with a numberof space-based instruments. the prompt emission is characterized by a typicalduration, a moderare $e_{peak}$ of the time-integrated spectrum, and stronghard-to-soft evolution. the high observed energy fluence yields, at z=0.984, ahuge isotropic-equivalent energy release $e_{iso}=(2.1\pm0.1)\times10^{54}$erg. the record-breaking energy flux observed at the peak of the short, bright,hard initial pulse results in an unprecedented isotropic-equivalent luminosity$l_{iso}=(4.7\pm0.2)\times10^{54}$erg s$^{-1}$. a tail of the soft gamma-rayemission was detected with temporal and spectral behavior typical of thatpredicted by the synchrotron forward-shock model. swift/xrt and swift/uvotobserved the bright afterglow from 1.2 to 48 days after the burst and revealedno evidence of a jet break. the post-break scenario for the afterglow ispreferred from our analysis, with a hard underlying electron spectrum andism-like circumburst environment implied. we conclude that, among multiplereasons investigated, the tight collimation of the jet must have been a keyingredient to produce this unusually bright burst. the inferred jet openingangle of 1.7-3.4 deg results in reasonable values of the collimation-correctedradiated energy and the peak luminosity, which, however, are still at the topof their distributions for such tightly collimated events. we estimate adetection horizon for a similar ultraluminous grb of $z\sim7.5$ for konus-wind,and $z\sim12$ for swift/bat, which stresses the importance of grbs as probes ofthe early universe.

1312.4955	the 100-month swift catalogue of supergiant fast x-ray transients i. bat  on-board and transient monitor flares	we investigate the characteristics of bright flares for a sample ofsupergiant fast x-ray transients and their relation to the orbital phase. wehave retrieved all swift/bat transient monitor light curves, and collected alldetections in excess of $5\sigma$ from both daily- and orbital-averaged lightcurves in the time range of 2005-feb-12 to 2013-may-31. we also considered allon-board detections as recorded in the same time span and selected those within4 arcmin of each source in our sample and in excess of $5\sigma$. we present acatalogue of over a thousand bat flares from 11 sfxts, down to 15-150kev fluxesof $\sim6\times10^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ (daily timescale) and$\sim1.5\times10^{-9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ (orbital timescale, averaging$\sim800$s) and spanning 100 months. the great majority of these flares areunpublished. this population is characterized by short (a few hundred seconds)and relatively bright (in excess of 100mcrab, 15-50kev) events. in the hardx-ray, these flares last in general much less than a day. clustering of hardx-ray flares can be used to indirectly measure the length of an outburst, evenwhen the low-level emission is not detected. we construct the distributions offlares, of their significance (in terms of sigma) and their flux as a functionof orbital phase, to infer the properties of these binary systems. inparticular, we observe a trend of clustering of flares at some phases as$p_{\rm orb}$ increases, as consistent with a progression from tight, circularor mildly eccentric orbits at short periods, to wider and more eccentric orbitsat longer orbital periods. finally, we estimate the expected number of flaresfor a given source for our limiting flux and provide the recipe for calculatingthem for the limiting flux of future hard x-ray observatories.

1403.6639	search for gravitational waves associated with gamma-ray bursts detected  by the interplanetary network	we present the results of a search for gravitational waves associated with223 gamma-ray bursts (grbs) detected by the interplanetary network (ipn) in2005-2010 during ligo's fifth and sixth science runs and virgo's first, secondand third science runs. the ipn satellites provide accurate times of the burstsand sky localizations that vary significantly from degree scale to hundreds ofsquare degrees. we search for both a well-modeled binary coalescence signal,the favored progenitor model for short grbs, and for generic, unmodeledgravitational wave bursts. both searches use the event time and skylocalization to improve the gravitational-wave search sensitivity as comparedto corresponding all-time, all-sky searches. we find no evidence of agravitational-wave signal associated with any of the ipn grbs in the sample,nor do we find evidence for a population of weak gravitational-wave signalsassociated with the grbs. for all ipn-detected grbs, for which a sufficientduration of quality gravitational-wave data is available, we place lower boundson the distance to the source in accordance with an optimistic assumption ofgravitational-wave emission energy of $10^{-2}m_{\odot}c^2$ at 150 hz, and finda median of 13 mpc. for the 27 short-hard grbs we place 90% confidenceexclusion distances to two source models: a binary neutron star coalescence,with a median distance of 12mpc, or the coalescence of a neutron star and blackhole, with a median distance of 22 mpc. finally, we combine this search withpreviously published results to provide a population statement for grb searchesin first-generation ligo and virgo gravitational-wave detectors, and aresulting examination of prospects for the advanced gravitational-wavedetectors.

1502.02650	the 2009 multiwavelength campaign on mrk 421: variability and  correlation studies	we performed a 4.5-month multi-instrument campaign (from radio to vhe gammarays) on mrk421 between january 2009 and june 2009, which included vlba,f-gamma, gasp-webt, swift, rxte, fermi-lat, magic, and whipple, among otherinstruments and collaborations. mrk421 was found in its typical (non-flaring)activity state, with a vhe flux of about half that of the crab nebula, yet thelight curves show significant variability at all wavelengths, the highestvariability being in the x-rays. we determined the power spectral densities(psd) at most wavelengths and found that all psds can be described bypower-laws without a break, and with indices consistent with pink/red-noisebehavior. we observed a harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra andmeasured a positive correlation between vhe and x-ray fluxes with zero timelag. such characteristics have been reported many times during flaringactivity, but here they are reported for the first time in the non-flaringstate. we also observed an overall anti-correlation between optical/uv andx-rays extending over the duration of the campaign.  the harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra and the measuredpositive x-ray/vhe correlation during the 2009 multi-wavelength campaignsuggests that the physical processes dominating the emission during non-flaringstates have similarities with those occurring during flaring activity. inparticular, this observation supports leptonic scenarios as being responsiblefor the emission of mrk421 during non-flaring activity. such a temporallyextended x-ray/vhe correlation is not driven by any single flaring event, andhence is difficult to explain within the standard hadronic scenarios. thehighest variability is observed in the x-ray band, which, within the one-zonesynchrotron self-compton scenario, indicates that the electron energydistribution is most variable at the highest energies.

1503.08634	radio monitoring of the hard state jets in the 2011 outburst of maxi  j1836-194	maxi j1836-194 is a galactic black hole candidate x-ray binary that wasdiscovered in 2011 when it went into outburst. in this paper, we present thefull radio monitoring of this system during its `failed' outburst, in which thesource did not complete a full set of state changes, only transitioning as faras the hard intermediate state. observations with the karl g. jansky very largearray (vla) and australia telescope compact array (atca) show that the jetproperties changed significantly during the outburst. the vla observationsdetected linearly polarised emission at a level of ~1% early in the outburst,increasing to ~3% as the outburst peaked. high-resolution images with the verylong baseline array (vlba) show a ~15 mas jet along the position angle $-21 \pm2^\circ$, in agreement with the electric vector position angle found from ourpolarisation results ($-21 \pm 4^\circ$), implying that the magnetic field isperpendicular to the jet. astrometric observations suggest that the systemrequired an asymmetric natal kick to explain its observed space velocity.comparing quasi-simultaneous x-ray monitoring with the 5 ghz vla observationsfrom the 2011 outburst shows an unusually steep hard-state radio/x-raycorrelation of $l_{\rm r} \propto l_{\rm x}^{1.8\pm0.2}$, where $l_{\rm r}$ and$l_{\rm x}$ denote the radio and x-ray luminosities, respectively. with atcaand swift monitoring of the source during a period of re-brightening in 2012,we show that the system lay on the same steep correlation. due to the lowinclination of this system, we then investigate the possibility that theobserved correlation may have been steepened by variable doppler boosting.

1506.01141	radio polarimetry as a probe of unresolved jets: the 2013 outburst of  xte j1908+094	xte j1908+094 is an x-ray transient black hole candidate in the galacticplane that was observed in outburst in 2002 and 2013. here we presentmulti-frequency radio and x-ray data, including radio polarimetry, spanning theentire period of the 2013 outburst. we find that the x-ray behaviour of xtej1908+094 traces the standard black hole hardness-intensity path, evolving froma hard state, through a soft state, before returning to a hard state andquiescence. its radio behaviour is typical of a compact jet that becomesquenched before discrete ejecta are launched during the late stages of x-raysoftening. the radio and x-ray fluxes, as well as the light curve morphologies,are consistent with those observed during the 2002 outburst of this source. thepolarisation angle during the rise of the outburst infers a jet orientation inagreement with resolved observations but also displays a gradual drift, whichwe associate with observed changes in the structure of the discrete ejecta. wealso observe an unexpected 90deg rotation of the polarisation angle associatedwith a second component.

astro-ph;0503508	a contemporaneous infrared flash from a long gamma-ray burst: an echo  from the central engine	the explosion that results in a cosmic gamma-ray burst (grb) is thought toproduce emission from two physical processes -- the activity of the centralengine gives rise to the high-energy emission of the burst through internalshocking and the subsequent interaction of the flow with the externalenvironment produces long-wavelength afterglow. while afterglow observationscontinue to refine our understanding of grb progenitors and relativisticshocks, gamma-ray observations alone have not yielded a clear picture of theorigin of the prompt emission nor details of the central engine. only oneconcurrent visible-light transient has been found and was associated withemission from an external shock. here we report the discovery of infrared (ir)emission contemporaneous with a grb, beginning 7.2 minutes after the onset ofgrb 041219a. our robotic telescope acquired 21 images during the active phaseof the burst, yielding the earliest multi-colour observations of anylong-wavelength emission associated with a grb. analysis of an initial ir pulsesuggests an origin consistent with internal shocks. this opens a newpossibility to study the central engine of grbs with ground-based observationsat long wavelengths.

astro-ph;0503521	a link between prompt optical and prompt gamma-ray emission in gamma-ray  bursts	the prompt optical emission that arrives with gamma-rays from a cosmicgamma-ray burst (grb) is a signature of the engine powering the burst, theproperties of the ultra-relativistic ejecta of the explosion, and the ejecta'sinteractions with the surroundings. until now, only grb 990123 had beendetected at optical wavelengths during the burst phase. its prompt opticalemission was variable and uncorrelated with the prompt gamma-ray emission,suggesting that the optical emission was generated by a reverse shock arisingfrom the ejecta's collision with the surrounding material. here we reportprompt optical emission from grb 041219a. it is variable and correlated withthe prompt gamma-rays, indicating a common origin for the optical light and thegamma-rays. within the context of the standard fireball model of grbs, weattribute this new optical component to internal shocks driven into the burstejecta by variations of the inner engine. the correlated optical emission is adirect probe of the jet isolated from the medium. the timing of theuncorrelated optical emission is strongly dependent on the nature of themedium.

astro-ph;0506453	prompt and afterglow early x-ray phases in the comoving frame. evidence  for universal properties?	we analyze the swift xrt light curves and spectra of the gamma-ray bursts(grbs) for which the redshift has been measured. the sample consists of sevengrbs. the soft x-ray light curves of all these grbs are separated into at leasttwo morphological classes: 1) those starting off with a very steep light curvedecay and 2) those showing a rather mild initial decay. this initial decay isfollowed by a flattening and by a further steepening. during these transitionsthe soft x-ray spectrum of these grbs remains constant within the observationalerrors (except for one case, grb050319). for the first time we are able toexploit the early light curve of grb afterglows in the comoving frame. besidesthe temporal and spectral behavior we find that the energy of the afterglowemitted in the (rest frame) time interval 20-200 s and 1300-12600 s after thetrigger correlates with the mean energy of the prompt emission, hinting at aclose link between the two. averaging over the bursts that have a rather wellsampled light curve and starting immediately after the prompt phase, the energyemitted in the soft x-rays is about 3% of the energy emitted during the promptphase, except for grb050315, where the soft x-ray emission is as high as 14% ofthe prompt emission.

astro-ph;0507410	the burst alert telescope (bat) on the swift midex mission	the burst alert telescope (bat) is one of 3 instruments on the swift midexspacecraft to study gamma-ray bursts (grbs). the bat first detects the grb andlocalizes the burst direction to an accuracy of 1-4 arcmin within 20 sec afterthe start of the event. the grb trigger initiates an autonomous spacecraft slewto point the two narrow field-of-view (fov) instruments at the burst locationwithin 20-70 sec so to make follow-up x-ray and optical observations. the batis a wide-fov, coded-aperture instrument with a cdznte detector plane. thedetector plane is composed of 32,768 pieces of cdznte (4x4x2mm), and thecoded-aperture mask is composed of approximately 52,000 pieces of lead(5x5x1mm) with a 1-m separation between mask and detector plane. the batoperates over the 15-150 kev energy range with approximately 7 kev resolution,a sensitivity of approximately 10e-8 erg*cm^-2*s^-1, and a 1.4 sr (half-coded)fov. we expect to detect &gt;100 grbs/yr for a 2-year mission. the bat alsoperforms an all-sky hard x-ray survey with a sensitivity of approximately 2mcrab (systematic limit) and it serves as a hard x-ray transient monitor.

astro-ph;0611148	swift discovery of gamma-ray bursts without jet break feature in their  x-ray afterglows	we analyze swift gamma-ray bursts (grbs) and x-ray afterglows for three grbswith spectroscopic redshift determinations -- grb 050401, xrf 050416a, and grb050525a. we find that the relation between spectral peak energy and isotropicenergy of prompt emissions (the amati relation) is consistent with that for thebursts observed in pre-swift era. however, we find that the x-ray afterglowlightcurves, which extend up to 10-70 days, show no sign of the jet break thatis expected in the standard framework of collimated outflows. we do so byshowing that none of the x-ray afterglow lightcurves in our sample satisfiesthe relation between the spectral and temporal indices that is predicted forthe phase after jet break. the jet break time can be predicted by inverting thetight empirical relation between the peak energy of the spectrum and thecollimation-corrected energy of the prompt emission (the ghirlanda relation).we find that there are no temporal breaks within the predicted time intervalsin x-ray band. this requires either that the ghirlanda relation has a largerscatter than previously thought, that the temporal break in x-rays is masked bysome additional source of x-ray emission, or that it does not happen because ofsome unknown reason.

astro-ph;0702603	grb 060714: no clear dividing line between prompt emission and x-ray  flares	the long gamma-ray burst grb 060714 was observed to exhibit a series of fivex-ray flares beginning ~70 s after the burst trigger t0 and continuing until t0+ ~200 s. the first two flares were detected by the burst alert telescope (bat)on the swift satellite, before swift had slewed to the burst location, whilethe last three flares were strongly detected by the x-ray telescope (xrt) butonly weakly detected by the bat. this burst provides an unusual opportunity totrack a complete sequence of flares over a wide energy range. the flares werevery similar in their light curve morphology, showing power-law rise and fallcomponents, and in most cases significant sub-structure. the flares also showedstrong evolution with time, both spectrally and temporally. the small timescale and large amplitude variability observed are incompatible with anexternal shock origin for the flares, and support instead late time sporadicactivity either of the central source or of localized dissipation events withinthe outflow. we show that the flares in grb 060714 cannot be the result ofinternal shocks in which the contrast in the lorentz factor of the collidingshells is very small, and that this mechanism faces serious difficulties inmost swift grbs. the morphological similarity of the flares and the promptemission and the gradual and continual evolution of the flares with time makesit difficult and arbitrary to draw a dividing line between the prompt emissionand the flares.

0810.1180	multiple flaring activity in the supergiant fast x-ray transient igr  j08408-4503 observed with swift	igr j08408-4503 is a supergiant fast x-ray transient discovered in 2006 witha confirmed association with a o8.5ib(f) supergiant star, hd 74194. we reporton the analysis of two outbursts caught by swift/bat on 2006 october 4 and 2008july 5, and followed up at softer energies with swift/xrt. the 2008 xrt lightcurve shows a multiple-peaked structure with an initial bright flare thatreached a flux of ~1e-9 erg/cm2/s (2-10 kev), followed by two equally brightflares within 75 ks. the spectral characteristics of the flares differdramatically, with most of the difference, as derived via time-resolvedspectroscopy, being due to absorbing column variations. we observe a gradualdecrease of the nh, derived with a fit using absorbed power law model, as timepasses. we interpret these nh variations as due to an ionization effectproduced by the first flare, resulting in a significant decrease in themeasured column density towards the source. the durations of the flares, aswell as the times of the outbursts suggest that the orbital period is ~35 days,if the flaring activity is interpreted within the framework of the sidoli et al2007 model with the outbursts triggered by the neutron star passage inside anequatorial wind inclined with respect to the orbital plane.

0810.5446	swift monitoring of supergiant fast x-ray transients: the  out-of-outburst behaviour and the flares from igrj17544-2916 and xtej1739-302	supergiant fast x-ray transients (sfxts) are a sub-class of high mass x-raybinaries (hmxbs) associated with ob supergiant companions and displayingtransient x-ray activity. this behaviour is quite surprising since hmxbshosting supergiants were known to be persistent sources, until the integraldiscoveries obtained by means of the monitoring of the galactic plane. we havebeen performing a monitoring campaign with swift of four sfxts with the mainaim of characterizing both the long-term behaviour of these transients and theproperties during bright outbursts. here we discuss the properties of the x-rayemission observed outside the outbursts as well as the flares observed from twosfxts: igrj17544-2916 and xtej1739-302. contrarily to what previously thought,swift allowed us to discover that sfxts spend most of the time in accretion ata low level, even outside the bright outbursts, with an accretion luminosity of1e33-1e34 erg/s, and that the quiescent level at ~1e32 erg/s is a much rarerstate.

0811.3401	epeak estimator for gamma-ray bursts observed by the swift burst alert  telescope	we report a correlation based on a spectral simulation study of the promptemission spectra of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) detected by the swift burst alerttelescope (bat). the correlation is between the epeak energy, which is the peakenergy in the \nu f_\nu spectrum, and the photon index (\gamma) derived from asimple power-law model. the epeak - \gamma relation, assuming the typicalsmoothly broken power-law spectrum of grbs, is \log epeak = 3.258 - 0.829\gamma(1.3 &lt; \gamma &lt; 2.3). we take into account not only a range of epeak energiesand fluences, but also distributions for both the low-energy photon index andthe high-energy photon index in the smoothly broken power-law model. thedistribution of burst durations in the bat grb sample is also included in thesimulation. our correlation is consistent with the index observed by bat andepeak measured by the bat, and by other grb instruments. since about 85% ofgrbs observed by the bat are acceptably fit with the simple power-law modelbecause of the relatively narrow energy range of the bat, this relationship canbe used to estimate epeak when it is located within the bat energy range.

0706.1257	detection of grb 060927 at z = 5.47: implications for the use of  gamma-ray bursts as probes of the end of the dark ages	we report on follow-up observations of the grb 060927 using the rotse-iiiatelescope and a suite of larger aperture ground-based telescopes. an opticalafterglow was detected 20 s after the burst, the earliest rest-frame detectionof optical emission from any grb. spectroscopy performed with the vlt about 13hours after the trigger shows a continuum break at lambda ~ 8070 a produced byneutral hydrogen absorption at z~5.6. we also detect an absorption line at 8158a which we interpret as siii at z=5.467. hence, grb 060927 is the second mostdistant grb with a spectroscopically measured redshift. the shape of the redwing of the spectral break can be fitted by a damped lyalpha profile with acolumn density with log(n_hi/cm^-2) ~ 22.5. we discuss the implications of thiswork for the use of grbs as probes of the end of the dark ages and draw threemain conclusions: i) grb afterglows originating from z&gt;6 should be relativelyeasy to detect from the ground, but rapid nir monitoring is necessary to ensurethat they are found; ii) the presence of large hi column densities in some grbshost galaxies at z&gt;5 makes the use of grbs to probe the reionization epoch viaspectroscopy of the red damping wing challenging; iii) grbs appear crucial tolocate typical star-forming galaxies at z&gt;5 and therefore the type of galaxiesresponsible for the reionization of the universe.
