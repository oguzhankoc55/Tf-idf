1001.4639	the scaling relation between richness and mass of galaxy clusters: a  bayesian approach	we use a sample of 53 galaxy clusters at 0.03 &lt; z &lt; 0.1 with available massesderived from the caustic technique and with velocity dispersions computed using208 galaxies on average per cluster, in order to investigate the scalingbetween richness, mass and velocity dispersion. a tight scaling betweenrichness and mass is found, with an intrinsic scatter of only 0.19 dex in massand with a slope one, i.e. clusters which have twice as many galaxies are twiceas massive. when richness is measured without any knowledge of the cluster massor linked parameters (such as r200), it can predict mass with an uncertainty of0.29+/-0.01 dex. as a mass proxy, richness competes favourably with both directmeasurements of mass given by the caustic method, which has typically 0.14 dexerrors (vs 0.29) and x-ray luminosity, which offers a similar 0.30 dexuncertainty. the similar performances of x-ray luminosity and richness inpredicting cluster masses has been confirmed using cluster masses derived fromvelocity dispersion fixed by numerical simulations. these results suggest thatcluster masses can be reliably estimated from simple galaxy counts, at least atthe redshift and masses explored in this work. this has important applicationsin the estimation of cosmological parameters from optical cluster surveys,because in current surveys clusters detected in the optical range outnumber, byat least one order of magnitude, those detected in x-ray. our analysis isrobust from astrophysical and statistical perspectives. the data and code usedfor the stochastic computation is distributed with the paper.

1004.2785	the stellar mass fraction and baryon content of galaxy clusters and  groups	[abridged] the analysis of a sample of 52 clusters with precise andhypothesis-parsimonious measurements of mass shows that low mass clusters andgroups are not simple scaled-down versions of their massive cousins in terms ofstellar content: lighter clusters have more stars per unit cluster mass. thesame analysis also shows that the stellar content of clusters and groupsdisplays an intrinsic spread at a given cluster mass, i.e. clusters are notsimilar each other in the amount of stars they contain, not even at a fixedcluster mass. the stellar mass fraction depends on halo mass with (logarithmic)slope -0.55+/-0.08 and with 0.15+/-0.02 dex of intrinsic scatter at a fixedcluster mass. the intrinsic scatter at a fixed cluster mass we determine forgas mass fractions is smaller, 0.06+/-0.01 dex. the intrinsic scatter in boththe stellar and gas mass fractions is a distinctive signature that the regionsfrom which clusters and groups collected matter, a few tens of mpc, are yet notrepresentative, in terms of gas and baryon content, of the mean matter contentof the universe. the observed stellar mass fraction values are in markeddisagreement with gasdynamics simulations with cooling and star formation ofclusters and groups. we found the the baryon (gas+stellar) fraction is fairlyconstant for clusters and groups with 13.7&lt;lg(mass)&lt;15.0 solar masses and it isoffset from the wmap-derived value by about 6 sigmas. the offset could berelated to the possible non universality of the baryon fraction pointed out byour measurements of the intrinsic scatter. our analysis is the first that doesnot assume that clusters are identically equal at a given halo mass and it isalso more accurate in many aspects. the data and code used for the stochasticcomputation are distributed with the paper.

1007.2853	galaxy clusters at z&gt;=1: gas constraints from the sunyaev-zel'dovich  array	we present gas constraints from sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect measurementsin a sample of eleven x-ray and infrared (ir) selected galaxy clusters at z&gt;=1, using data from the sunyaev-zel'dovich array (sza). the cylindricallyintegrated compton-y parameter, y , is calculated by fitting the data to atwo-parameter gas pressure profile. where possible, we also determine thetemperature of the hot intra-cluster plasma from chandra and xmm-newton data,and constrain the gas mass within the same aperture (r_2500 ) as y . the szeffect is detected in the clusters for which the x-ray data indicate gas massesabove ~ 10^13 msun, including xmmu j2235-2557 at redshift z = 1.39, which todate is one of the most distant clusters detected using the sz effect. none ofthe ir-selected targets are detected by the sza measurements, indicating lowgas masses for these objects. for these and the four other undetected clusters,we quote upper limits on y and mgas_sz , with the latter derived from scalingrelations calibrated with lower redshift clusters. we compare the constraintson y and x-ray derived gas mass mgas_x-ray to self-similar scaling relationsbetween these observables determined from observations of lower redshiftclusters, finding consistency given the measurement error.

1012.1951	red sequence determination of the redshift of the cluster of galaxies  jkcs041: z~2.2	this paper aims at robustly determining the redshift of the cluster ofgalaxies jkcs041 and at putting constraints on the formation epoch of thecolor-magnitude sequence in two very high redshift clusters. new deep z'-j datashow a clear narrow red sequence that is co-centered with, and similarlyconcentrated on, the extended x-ray emission of the cluster of galaxiesjkcs041. the jkcs041 red sequence is 0.32+/-0.06 mag redder in z'-j than thered sequence of the zspec=1.62 irc0218a cluster, putting jkcs041 at z&gt;&gt;1.62 andruling out z&lt;~1.49 the latter claimed by a recent paper. the color differenceof the two red sequences gives a red-sequence-based redshift of z=2.20+/-0.11for jkcs041, where the uncertainty accounts for uncertainties in stellarsynthesis population models, in photometric calibration, and in the redsequence color of both jkcs041 and irc0218a clusters. we do not observe anysign of truncation of the red sequence for both clusters down to j=23 mag(1.0e+11 solar masses), which suggests that it is already in place in clustersrich and massive enough to heat and retain hot gas at these high redshifts.

1012.3034	cluster x-ray luminosity-temperature relation at z&gt;~1.5	the evolution of the properties of the hot gas that fills the potential wellof galaxy clusters is poorly known, since models are unable to give robustpredictions and observations lack a sufficient redshift leverage and areaffected by selection effects. here, with just two high redshift, z approx 1.8,clusters avoiding selection biases, we obtain a significant extension of theredshift range and we begin to constrain the possible evolution of the x-rayluminosity vs temperature relation. the two clusters, jkc041 at z=2.2 andiscsj1438+3414 at z=1.41, are respectively the most distant cluster overall,and the second most distant that can be used for studying scaling relations.their location in the x-ray luminosity vs temperature plane, with an x-rayluminosity 5 times lower than expected, suggests at the 95 % confidence thatthe evolution of the intracluster medium has not been self-similar in the lastthree quarters of the universe age. our conclusion is reinforced by data on athird, x-ray selected, high redshift cluster, too faint for its temperaturewhen compared to a sample of similarly selected objects. our data suggest thatnon-gravitational effects, such as the baryon physics, influence the evolutionof galaxy cluster. precise knowledge of evolution is central for using galaxyclusters as cosmological probes in planned x-ray surveys such as wfxt or jdem.

0709.1950	the xmm-lss survey: the class 1 cluster sample over the initial 5 square  degrees and its cosmological modelling	we present a sample of 29 galaxy clusters from the xmm-lss survey over anarea of some 5deg2 out to a redshift of z=1.05. the sample clusters, whichrepresent about half of the x-ray clusters identified in the region, followwell defined x-ray selection criteria and are all spectroscopically confirmed.for all clusters, we provide x-ray luminosities and temperatures as well asmasses. the cluster distribution peaks around z=0.3 and t =1.5 kev, half of theobjects being groups with a temperature below 2 kev. our l-t(z) relation pointstoward self-similar evolution, but does not exclude other physically plausiblemodels. assuming that cluster scaling laws follow self-similar evolution, ournumber density estimates up to z=1 are compatible with the predictions of theconcordance cosmology and with the findings of previous rosat surveys. our wellmonitored selection function allowed us to demonstrate that the inclusion ofselection effects is essential for the correct determination of the evolutionof the l-t relation, which may explain the contradictory results from previousstudies. extensive simulations show that extending the survey area to 10deg2has the potential to exclude the non-evolution hypothesis, but that constraintson more refined icm models will probably be limited by the large intrinsicdispersion of the l-t relation. we further demonstrate that increasing thedispersion in the scaling laws increases the number of detectable clusters,hence generating further degeneracy [in addition to sigma8, omega_m, l(m,z) andt(m,z)] in the cosmological interpretation of the cluster number counts. weprovide useful empirical formulae for the cluster mass-flux and mass-count-raterelations as well as a comparison between the xmm-lss mass sensitivity and thatof forthcoming sz surveys.

0709.2300	testing the galaxy cluster mass-observable relations at z = 1 with  xmm-newton and chandra observations of xlssj022403.9-041328	we present an analysis of deep xmm-newton and chandra observations of thez=1.05 galaxy cluster xlssj022403.9-041328 (hereafter xlssc 029), detected inthe xmm-newton large scale structure survey. density and temperature profilesof the x-ray emitting gas were used to perform a hydrostatic mass analysis ofthe system. this allowed us to measure the total mass and gas fraction in thecluster and define overdensity radii r500 and r2500. the global properties ofxlssc 029 were measured within these radii and compared with those of the localpopulation. the gas mass fraction was found to be consistent with localclusters. the mean metal abundance was 0.18 +0.17 -0.15 zsol, with the clustercore regions excluded, consistent with the predicted and observed evolution.the properties of xlssc 029 were then used to investigate the position of thecluster on the m-kt, yx-m, and lx-m scaling relations. in all cases theobserved properties of xlssc 029 agreed well with the simple self-similarevolution of the scaling relations. this is the first test of the evolution ofthese relations at z &gt; 1 and supports the use of the scaling relations incosmological studies with distant galaxy clusters.

1103.4249	the extreme synchronicity of stellar ages of red galaxies in the jkcs041  cluster at z=2.2	above redshift z ~ 1.4, we known little or nothing about the stellar ages ofred galaxies in clusters, yet at these high redshifts important changes arepredicted by current renditions of galaxy formation models embedded in thestandard hierarchical paradigm of structure formation. red-sequence galaxies inthe cluster jkcs041 at z=2.2 show a tight distribution in colour that indicatesa star formation history that is highly synchronized across galaxies.specifically, we measure a spread in stellar age of 160+/-30 myr, in markeddisagreement with the current understanding of how massive red galaxies form inclusters, i.e. if they are produced somewhat stochastically in merging episodesthat sometimes involve gas, hence star formation. the existence of a tightdistribution in colour when the universe was at one quarter of its current ageimplies that mechanisms that have not yet been implemented in current galaxyformation scenarios long ago began to shape the star formation history of redcluster galaxies.

0710.1023	scaling relations of the colour-detected cluster rzcs 052 at z=1.016 and  of some other high redshift clusters	we report on the discovery of the z=1.016 cluster rzcs 052 using a modifiedred sequence method, followup spectroscopy and x-ray imaging. this cluster hasa velocity dispersion of 710+-150 km/s, a virial mass of 4.0e14 msol (based on21 spectroscopically confirmed members) and an x-ray luminosity of (0.68+-0.47)e44 ergs/s in the [1-4] kev band. this optically selected cluster appearsto be of richness class 3 and to follow the known l_x-sigma_v relation for highredshift x-ray selected clusters. using these data, we find that the halooccupation number for this cluster is only marginally consistent with whatexpected assuming a self-similar evolution of cluster scaling relations,suggesting perhaps a break of them at z~1. we also rule out a strong galaxymerging activity between z=1 and today. finally, we present a bayesian approachto measuring cluster velocity dispersions and x-ray luminosities in thepresence of a background: we critically reanalyze recent claims for x-rayunderluminous clusters using these techniques and find that the clusters can beaccommodated within the existing l_x -sigma_v relation.

1109.4031	do x-ray dark or underluminous galaxy clusters exist?	[abridged] we study the x-ray properties of a color-selected sample ofclusters at 0.1&lt;z&lt;0.3, to quantify the real aboundance of the population ofx-ray dark or underluminous clusters and at the same time the spuriousdetection contamination level of color-selected cluster catalogs. a carefulselection allowed us to have an x-ray-unbiased sample of 33 clusters to measurethe lx-richness relation. swift 1.4 ms x-ray observations show that at least89% of the color-detected clusters are real objects with a potential well deepenough to heat and retain an intracluster medium. the percentage rises to 94 %when one includes the single spectroscopically confirmed color-selected clusterwhose x-ray emission is not secured. looking at our results from the oppositeperspective, the percentage of x-ray dark clusters among color-selectedclusters is very low: at most about 11 per cent (at 90 % confidence).supplementing our data with those from literature, we conclude that x-ray- andcolor- cluster surveys sample the same population and consequently that in thisregard we can safely use clusters selected with any of the two methods forcosmological purposes. this is an essential and promising piece of informationfor upcoming surveys in both the optical/ir (des, euclid) and x-ray (erosita).richness correlates with x-ray luminosity with a large scatter, 0.51+/-0.08(0.44+/-0.07) dex in lglx at a given richness, when lx is measured in a 500(1070) kpc aperture. we release data and software to estimate the x-ray flux,or its upper limit, of a source with over-poisson background fluctuations(found in this work to be ~20% on cluster angular scales) and to fit x-rayluminosity vs richness if there is an intrinsic scatter. these bayesianapplications rigorously account for boundaries (e.g. the x-ray luminosity andthe richness cannot be negative).

1110.6446	star formation and environment in clusters up to z~2.2	the dependence of galaxy star formation activity on environment - especiallyin clusters - at high redshift is still poorly understood, as illustrated bythe still limited number of z&gt;1.4 clusters on the one hand, and by the stilldebated star formation-density relation at high redshift on the other hand. thezphot~2.2 jkcs041 cluster allows to probe such environmental dependence of starformation activity at an unprecedented combination of redshifts andenvironments. its study permits to enlarge the knowledge of high redshiftclusters and to put strong leverage on observational constraints for galaxyevolution models. we analyze deep u\astg'r'i'z'jhks images from thecfhtls/wirds surveys, which cover jkcs041 cluster field. we first estimatephotometric redshifts based on multi-wavelength photometry. we then lead acareful analysis to test the presence of a butcher-oemler effect. we work ongalaxies within 2\timesr200 and with masses &gt;1.34\times10^11 msun, and use twocomparison clusters at z=0 and z=1 of similar mass. we estimate the radialprofiles of the fraction of blue galaxies, taking into account the star agingwith decreasing redshift. after confirming the high redshift nature of jkcs041,we find no evidence for a butcher-oemler effect between z~2.2 and z~0 forgalaxies more massive than 1.34\times10^11 msun. in the cluster center, achange greater than \deltafblue/\deltaz=0.16 between z~0 and z~2.2 would beeasily detected. we also find that jkcs041 shows a consistent and systematicincrease of the fraction of star-forming galaxies with cluster-centricdistance, hence with decreasing density, for both a m&gt;1.34\times10^11 msunselected sample and a lower mass sample. in particular, very few (less than15%) star-forming galaxies are found within r200/2 among high mass(m&gt;1.34\times10^11 msun) galaxies. our results show that the present-day starformation-density relation is already in place at z~2.2.

1112.3652	understanding better (some) astronomical data using bayesian methods	current analysis of astronomical data are confronted with the daunting taskof modeling the awkward features of astronomical data, among whichheteroscedastic (point-dependent) errors, intrinsic scatter, non-ignorable datacollection (selection effects), data structure, non-uniform populations (oftencalled malmquist bias), non-gaussian data, and upper/lower limits. this chaptershows, by examples, how modeling all these features using bayesian methods. inshort, one just need to formalize, using maths, the logical link between theinvolved quantities, how the data arise and what we already known on thequantities we want to study. the posterior probability distribution summarizeswhat we known on the studied quantities after the data, and we should not beafraid about their actual numerical computation, because it is left to(special) monte carlo programs such as jags. as examples, we show how topredict the mass of a new object disposing of a calibrating sample, how toconstraint cosmological parameters from supernovae data and how to check if thefitted data are in tension with the adopted fitting model. examples are givenwith their coding. these examples can be easily used as template for completelydifferent analysis, on totally unrelated astronomical objects, requiring tomodel the same awkward data features.

1205.4021	galaxy mass, cluster-centric distance and secular evolution: their role  in the evolution of galaxies in clusters in the last 10 gyr	galaxy mass and environment are known to play a key role in galaxy evolution:looking at galaxy colors at different redshifts, fixed galaxy mass andenvironment, offers a powerful diagnosis to disentangle the role of each. inthis work, we study the simulateneous dependence of the fraction of bluegalaxies fblue on secular evolution, environment and galaxy mass with awell-controlled cluster sample. we are thus able to study the evolution andrespective role of the cessation of star formation history (sfh) in clustersdue to galaxy mass ("mass quenching") or to environment ("environmentalquenching"). we define an homogenous x-ray selected cluster sample (25 clusterswith 0 &lt; z &lt; 1 and one cluster at z \sim 2.2), having similar masses andwell-defined sizes. using multicolor photometry and a large spectroscopicsample to calibrate photometric redshifts, we carefully estimate fblue for eachcluster at different galaxy mass and cluster-centric distance bins. we then fitwith a simple model the dependence of fblue on redshift (z), environment(r/r200) and galaxy mass (m). fblue increases with cluster-centric distancewith a slope $1.2^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$, decreases with galaxy mass with a slope$-3.8^{+0.6}_{-0.5}$, and increases with redshift with a slope$3.2^{+0.7}_{-0.5}$. the data also require for the first time a differentialevolution with galaxy mass of fblue with redshift, with lower mass galaxiesevolving slower by a factor $-4.1^{+1.1}_{-0.9}$. our study shows that theprocesses responsible for the cessation of star formation in clusters areeffective at all epochs (z&lt;2.2), and more effective in denser environments andfor more massive galaxies. we found that the mass and environmental quenchingsare separable, that environmental quenching does not change with epoch, andthat mass quenching is a dynamical process, i.e. its evolutionary rate ismass-dependent.

1206.4263	the vista deep extragalactic observations (video) survey	in this paper we describe the first data release of the the visible andinfrared survey telescope for astronomy (vista) deep extragalactic observations(video) survey. video is a ~12degree^2 survey in the near-infrared z,y,j,h andk_s bands, specifically designed to enable the evolution of galaxies and largestructures to be traced as a function of both epoch and environment from thepresent day out to z=4, and active galactic nuclei (agn) and the most massivegalaxies up to and into the epoch of reionization. with its depth and area,video will be able to fully explore the period in the universe where agn andstarburst activity were at their peak and the first galaxy clusters werebeginning to virialize. video therefore offers a unique data set with which toinvestigate the interplay between agn, starbursts and environment, and the roleof feedback at a time when it was potentially most crucial.  we provide data over the video-xmm3 tile, which also covers thecanada-france-hawaii-telescope legacy survey deep-1 field (cfhtls-d1). thereleased video data reach a 5-sigma ab-magnitude depth of z=25.7, y=24.5,j=24.4, h=24.1 and k_s=23.8 in 2 arcsec diameter apertures (the full depth ofy=24.6 will be reached within the full integration time in future releases).the data are compared to previous surveys over this field and we find goodastrometric agreement with the two-micron all sky survey, and source counts inagreement with the recently released ultravista survey data. the addition ofthe video data to the cfhtls-d1 optical data increases the accuracy ofphotometric redshifts and significantly reduces the fraction of catastrophicoutliers over the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;1 from 5.8 to 3.1 per cent in the absenceof an i-band luminosity prior.

1209.0565	the enrichment history of the intracluster medium: a bayesian approach	this work measures the evolution of the iron content in galaxy clusters by arigorous analysis of the data of 130 clusters at 0.1&lt;z&lt;1.3. this task is madedifficult by a) the low signal-to-noise ratio of abundance measurements and theupper limits, b) possible selection effects, c) boundaries in the parameterspace, d) non-gaussian errors, e) the intrinsic variety of the objects studied,and f) abundance systematics. we introduce a bayesian model to address allthese issues at the same time, thus allowing cross-talk (covariance). onsimulated data, the bayesian fit recovers the input enrichment history, unlikein standard analysis. after accounting for a possible dependence on x-raytemperature, for metal abundance systematics, and for the intrinsic variety ofstudied objects, we found that the present-day metal content is not reachedeither at high or at low redshifts, but gradually over time: iron abundanceincreases by a factor 1.5 in the 7 gyr sampled by the data. therefore, feedbackin metal abundance does not end at high redshift. evolution is established witha moderate amount of evidence, 19 to 1 odds against faster or slower metalenrichment histories. we quantify, for the first time, the intrinsic spread inmetal abundance, 18+/-3 %, after correcting for the effect of evolution, x-raytemperature, and metal abundance systematics. finally, we also present ananalytic approximation of the x-ray temperature and metal abundance likelihoodfunctions, which are useful for other regression fitting involving theseparameters. the data for the 130 clusters and code used for the stochasticcomputation are provided with the paper.

1209.5938	richness-mass relation self-calibration for galaxy clusters	this work attains a threefold objective: first, we derived the richness-massscaling in the local universe from data of 53 clusters with individualmeasurements of mass. we found a 0.46+-0.12 slope and a 0.25+-0.03 dex scattermeasuring richness with a previously developed method. second, we showed on areal sample of 250 0.06&lt;z&lt;0.9 clusters, most of which are at z&lt;0.3, withspectroscopic redshift that the colour of the red sequence allows us to measurethe clusters' redshift to better than delta z=0.02. third, we computed thepredicted prior of the richness-mass scaling to forecast the capabilities offuture wide-field-area surveys of galaxy clusters to constrain cosmologicalparameters. we computed the uncertainty and the covariance matrix of the(evolving) richness-mass scaling of a panstarrs 1+euclid-like survey accountingfor a large suite of sources of errors. we find that the richness-mass scalingparameters, which are the input ingredients of cosmological forecasts usingcluster counts, can be determined 10^5 times better than estimated in previousworks that did not use weak-lensing mass estimates. the better knowledge of thescaling parameters likely has a strong impact on the relative importance of thedifferent probes used to constrain cosmological parameters. richness-massscaling parameters were recovered, but only if the cluster mass function andthe weak-lensing redshift-dependent selection function were accounted for inthe fitting of the mass-richness scaling. this emphasizes the limitations ofoften adopted simplifying assumptions, such as having a mass-completeredshift-independent sample. the fitting code used for computing the predictedprior, including the treatment of the mass function and of the weak-lensingselection function, is provided in the appendix.

1211.0790	a low-scatter survey-based mass proxy for clusters of galaxies	estimates of cosmological parameters using galaxy clusters have the scatterin the observable at a given mass as a fundamental parameter. this workcomputes the amplitude of the scatter for a newly introduced mass proxy, theproduct of the cluster total luminosity times the mass-to-light ratio, usuallyreferred as stellar mass. the analysis of 12 galaxy clusters with excellenttotal masses shows a tight correlation between the stellar mass, or stellarfraction, and total mass within r500 with negligible intrinsic scatter: the 90%upper limit is 0.06 dex, the posterior mean is 0.027 dex. this scatter issimilar to the one of best-determined mass proxies, such as yx, i.e. theproduct of x-ray temperature and gas mass. the size of the cluster sample usedto determine the intrinsic scatter is small, as in previous works proposinglow-scatter proxies because very accurate masses are needed to infer very smallvalues of intrinsic scatter. three-quarters of the studied clusters have lgm&lt;~14 msol, which is advantageous from a cosmological perspective because theseclusters are far more abundant than more massive clusters. at the difference ofother mass proxies such as yx, stellar mass can be determined with survey dataup to at least z=0.9 using upcoming optical near-infrared surveys, such as desand euclid, or even with currently available surveys, covering however smallersolid angles. on the other end, the uncertainty about the predicted mass of asingle cluster is large, 0.21 to 0.32 dex, depending on cluster richness. thisis largely because the proxy itself has ~0.10 dex errors for clusters of lgm&lt;~14 msol mass.

1304.2963	observational evidence that massive cluster galaxies were forming stars  at z~2.5 and did not grow in mass at later times	using spitzer 3.6 micron data we derived the luminosity function and the massfunction of galaxies in five z&gt;1.4 clusters selected to have a firmintracluster medium detection. the five clusters differ in richness(iscsj1438.1+3414 and xmmxcsj2215.9-1738 are twice as rich as iscsj1432.4+3250,idcsj1426.5+3508, and jkcs041) and morphological appareance. at the medianredshift z=1.5, from the 150 member galaxies of the five clusters, we derived acharacteristic magnitude of 16.92+/-0.13 in the [3.6] band and a characteristicmass of lgm*=11.30+/-0.05 msol. we find that the characteristic luminosity andmass does not evolve between z=1 and 1.4&lt;z&lt;1.8, directly ruling out ongoingmass assembly between these epochs because massive galaxies are already presentup to z=1.8. lower-redshift build-up epochs have already been ruled out byprevious works, leaving only z&gt;1.8 as a possible epoch for the mass build up.however, the observed values of m^* at very high redshift are too bright forgalaxies without any star formation immediately preceding the observed redshiftand therefore imply a star formation episode not earlier than z_f=2.5. for thefirst time, mass/luminosity functions are able to robustly distinguish tinydifferences between formation redshifts and to set {\it upper} limits to theepoch of the last star-formation episode.

1311.4361	jkcs041: a coma cluster progenitor at z=1.803	using deep two-color near-infrared hst imaging and unbiased grismspectroscopy we present a detailed study of the z=1.803 jkcs041 cluster.uniquely, for a high redshift cluster, we confirm a mass of $\log m=14.2$ insolar units using four different techniques based on the x-ray temperature, thex-ray luminosity and the cluster richness. jkcs041 is thus a progenitor of alocal system like the coma cluster. our rich dataset and the abundantpopulation of 14 spectroscopically-confirmed red sequence galaxies allows us toexplore the past star formation history of this system in unprecedented detail.remarkably, we find a prominent red sequence down to stellar masses as low as$\log m=9.8$, corresponding to a mass range of 2 dex. these quiescent galaxiesare concentrated around the cluster center with a core radius of 330 kpc. bluemembers are few and avoid the cluster center. in jkcs041 quenching wastherefore largely completed by a look-back time of 10 gyr and we can constrainthe epoch at which this occurred via spectroscopic age-dating of the individualgalaxies. most galaxies were quenched about 1.1 gyr prior to the epoch ofobservation. the less massive quiescent galaxies are somewhat younger,corresponding to a decrease in age of 650 myr per mass dex, but the scatter inage at fixed mass is only 380 myr (at $\log m=11$). the size-mass relation ofquiescent galaxies in jkcs041 is consistent with that observed for localclusters within our uncertainties. comparing our data on jkcs041 with 41clusters at lower redshift, we find that the form of the mass function of redsequence galaxies has hardly evolved in the past 10 gyr, both in terms of itsfaint end slope and characteristic mass. despite observing jkcs041 soon afterits quenching and the three fold expected increase in mass in the next 10 gyr,it is already remarkably similar to present-day clusters.

1406.1651	the insignificant evolution of the richness-mass relation of galaxy  clusters	we analysed the richness--mass scaling of 23 very massive clusters at$0.15&lt;z&lt;0.55$ with homogenously measured weak-lensing masses and richnesseswithin a fixed aperture of $0.5$ mpc radius. we found that the richness--massscaling is very tight (the scatter is $&lt;0.09$ dex with 90 \% probability) andindependent of cluster evolutionary status and morphology. this implies a closeassociation between infall and evolution of dark matter and galaxies in thecentral region of clusters. we also found that the evolution of therichness-mass intercept is minor at most, and, given the minor mass evolutionacross the studied redshift range, the richness evolution of individual massiveclusters also turns out to be very small. finally, it was paramount to accountfor the cluster mass function and the selection function. ignoring them wouldled to biases larger than the (otherwise quoted) errors. our study benefitsfrom: a) weak-lensing masses instead of proxy-based masses thereby removing theambiguity between a real trend and one induced by an accounted evolution of theused mass proxy; b) the use of projected masses that simplify the statisticalanalysis thereby not requiring consideration of the unknown covariance inducedby the cluster orientation/triaxiality; c) the use of aperture masses as theyare free of the pseudo-evolution of mass definitions anchored to the evolvingdensity of the universe; d) a proper accounting of the sample selectionfunction and of the malmquist-like effect induced by the cluster mass function;e) cosmological simulations for the computation of the cluster mass function,its evolution, and the mass growth of each individual cluster.

1409.0307	chemical evolution on the scale of clusters of galaxies: a conundrum?	the metal content of clusters of galaxies and its relation to their stellarcontent is revisited making use of a cluster sample for which all four basicparameters are homogeneously measured within consistent radii, namelycore-excised mass-weighted metallicity plus total, stellar and icm masses. forclusters of total mass $m_{500} &gt;$ $\sim 10^{14}$ $m_{\odot}$ nice agreement isfound between their iron content and what expected from empirical supernovayields. for the same clusters, there also appears to be at least as much ironin the intracluster medium (icm) as there is still locked into stars (i.e., theicm/stars metal share is about unity). however, for more massive clusters thestellar mass fraction appears to drop substantially without being accompaniedby a drop in the icm metallicity, thus generating a major tension with thenucleosynthesis expectation and inflating the metal share to extremely highvalues (up to $\sim 6$). various possible solutions of this conundrum arediscussed, but are all considered either astrophysically implausible, orlacking an independent observational support. for this reason we stillentertain the possibility that even some of the best cluster data may befaulty, though we are not able to identify any obvious bias. finally, based onthe stellar mass-metallicity relation for local galaxies we estimate thecontribution of galaxies to the icm enrichment as a function of their mass,concluding that even the most massive galaxies must have lost a major fractionof the metals they have produced.

1409.4416	do cluster properties affect the quenching rate?	the quenching rate is known to depend on galaxy stellar mass and environment,however, possible dependences on the hosting halo properties, such as mass,richness, and dynamical status, are still debated. the determination of thesedependences is hampered by systematics, induced by noisy estimates of clustermass or by the lack of control on galaxy stellar mass, which may mask existingtrends or introduce fake trends. we studied a sample of local clusters (20 with0.02&lt;z&lt;0.1 and log(m200/msun)&gt;14), selected independent of the galaxyproperties under study, having homogeneous optical photometry and x-rayestimated properties. using those top quality measurements of cluster mass,hence of cluster scale, richness, iron abundance, and cooling time/presence ofa cool-core, we study the simultaneous dependence of quenching on these clusterproperties on galaxy stellar mass m and normalised cluster-centric distancer/r200. we found that the quenching rate can be completely described by twovariables only, galaxy stellar mass and normalised cluster-centric distance,and is independent of halo properties (mass, richness, iron abundance, presenceof a cool-core, and central cooling time). these halo properties change, inmost cases, by less than 3% the probability that a galaxy is quenched, once themass-size (m200-r200) scaling relation is accounted for through cluster-centricdistance normalisation.

1501.01814	relative distribution of dark matter and stellar mass in three massive  galaxy clusters	this work observationally addresses the relative distribution of total andoptically luminous matter in galaxy clusters by computing the radial profile ofthe stellar-to-total mass ratio. we adopt state-of-the-art accurate lensingmasses free from assumptions about the mass radial profile and we use extremelydeep multicolor wide--field optical images to distinguish star formation fromstellar mass, to properly calculate the mass in galaxies of low mass, thoseoutside the red sequence, and to allow a contribution from galaxies of low massthat is clustercentric dependent. we pay special attention to issues andcontributions that are usually underrated, yet are major sources ofuncertainty, and we present an approach that allows us to account for all ofthem. here we present the results for three very massive clusters at$z\sim0.45$, macsj1206.2-0847, macsj0329.6-0211, and rxj1347.5-1145. we findthat stellar mass and total matter are closely distributed on scales from about150 kpc to 2.5 mpc: the stellar-to-total mass ratio is radially constant. wefind that the characteristic mass stays constant across clustercentric radiiand clusters, but that the less-massive end of the galaxy mass function isdependent on the environment.

1509.00589	making the observational parsimonious richness a working mass proxy	richness, i.e., the number of bright cluster galaxies, is known to correlatewith the cluster mass, however, to exploit it as mass proxy we need a way toestimate the aperture in which galaxies should be counted that minimizes thescatter between mass and richness. in this work, using a sample of 39 clusterswith accurate caustic masses at 0.1&lt;z&lt;0.22, we first show that the scatterbetween mass and richness derived from survey data is negligibly small, assmall as best mass proxies. the scatter turns out to be smaller than in someprevious works and has a 90% upper limit of 0.05 dex in mass. the currentsample, adjoining 76 additional clusters analyzed in previous works,establishes an almost scatterless, minimally evolving (if at all),mass-richness scaling in the redshift range 0.03&lt;z&lt;0.55. we then exploit thisnegligible scatter to derive the reference aperture to be used to computerichness and to predict the mass of cluster samples. these predicted masseshave a total 0.16 dex scatter with caustic mass, about half of which is notintrinsic to the proxy, but related to the noisiness of the caustic masses usedfor test proxy performances. these results make richness-based masses of bestquality and available for large samples at a low observational cost.

1511.04195	the amazing diversity in the hot gas content of an x-ray unbiased  massive galaxy clusters sample	we aim to determine the intrinsic variety, at a given mass, of the propertiesof the intracluster medium in clusters of galaxies. this requires a clustersample selected independently of the intracluster medium content for whichreliable masses and subsequent x-ray data can be obtained. we present one suchsample, consisting of 34 galaxy clusters selected independently of their x-rayproperties in the nearby ($0.050&lt;z&lt;0.135$) universe and mostly with $14&lt;\logm_{500}/m_\odot \lesssim 14.5$, where masses are dynamically estimated. wecollected the available x-ray observations from the archives and then observedthe remaining clusters with the low-background swift x-ray telescope, which isextremely useful for sampling a cluster population expected to have low surfacebrightness. we found that clusters display a large range (up to a factor 50) inx-ray luminosities within $r_{500}$ at a given mass, whether or not the centralemission ($r&lt;0.15 r_{500}$) is excised, unveiling a wider cluster populationthan seen in sunayev-zeldovich surveys or inferred from the population seen inx-ray surveys. the measured dispersion is $0.5$ dex in $l_x$ at a given mass.

astro-ph;0002280	use of dposs data to study globular cluster halos: an application to m  92	we exploited the large areal coverage offered by the dposs to analyze theoutermost regions of the galactic globular cluster m 92. two independentphotometric reduction programs (skicat and daophot) were used to construct acolor-magnitude diagram and a surface density profile for this cluster, basedon j- and f-band dposs plates. a strong similarity has been found in theperformance of the two programs in the low--crowded outermost cluster regions.after removing the background contribution, we obtained the cluster outersurface density profile down to a surface brightness magnitude of mu_v ~ 31mag/sq.arcsec and matched it with the inner profile of trager et al. 1995. theprofile shapes match very well: since our data are uncalibrated, the shift inmagnitude between the profiles has been also used to calibrate our profile. theanalysis shows that the cluster has an extra tidal halo extending out to ~ 30arcmin from the cluster center at a 3 sigma level over the background noise.this halo is revealed to be almost circular.

astro-ph;0009382	deep near-infrared luminosity function of a cluster of galaxies at z=0.3	the deep near-infrared luminosity function of ac118, a cluster of galaxies atz=0.3, is presented. ac118 is a bimodal cluster, as evidenced both by ournear-infrared images of lensed galaxies, by public x-ray rosat images and bythe spatial distribution of bright galaxies. taking advantage of the extensionand depth of our data, which sample an almost unexplored region in the depthvs. observed area diagram, we derive the luminosity function (lf), down to thedwarf regime (m*+5), computed in several cluster portions. the overall lf,computed on a 2.66 mpc2 areas (h_0=50 km/s/mpc), has an intermediate slope(alpha=-1.2). however, the lf parameters depend on the surveyed cluster region:the central concentration has 2.6^{+5.1}_{-1.7} times more bright galaxies and5.3^{+7.2}_{-2.3} times less dwarfs per typical galaxy than the outer region,which includes galaxies at an average projected distance of ~580 kpc (errorsare quoted at the 99.9 % confidence level). the lf in the secondary ac118 clumpis intermediate between the central and outer one. in other words, thenear-infrared ac118 lf steepens going from high to low density regions. at anaverage clustercentric distance of ~580 kpc, the ac118 lf is statisticallyindistinguishable from the lf of field galaxies at similar redshift, thussuggesting that the hostile cluster environment plays a minor role in shapingthe lf at large clustercentric distances, while it strongly affects the lf athigher galaxy density.

astro-ph;0009431	the coma cluster luminosity function from ultraviolet to near-infrared	[abridged] the coma cluster luminosity function (lf) from ultraviolet (2000aa) to the near-infrared (h band) is summarized. in the uv the lf is verysteep, much steeper than in the optical. the steep coma uv lf implies thatfaint and bright galaxies give similar contributions to the total uv flux andto the total metal production rate. the coma uv lf is dominated by star forminggalaxies, not by massive and large galaxies. the optical coma lf is relativelysteep (alpha=-1.4) over the 11 magnitudes sampled. we found a clear steeping ofthe fl going from b to r bands, indicative of the presence of a large number ofred dwarfs, as faint as three bright globular clusters. furthermore, usinghubble space telescope images, we discover that blends of globular clusters,not resolved in individual components due to seeing, look like dwarf galaxieswhen observed from the ground and are numerous and bright. the existence ofthese fake extended sources increases the steepness of the lf at faintmagnitudes, if not deal on. the near-infrared lf was computed on anear-infrared selected sample of galaxies which photometry is complete down tothe typical dwarf (m^*+5) luminosity. the coma lf can be described by aschechter function with intermediate slope (alpha~-1.3), plus a dip at m_h~-22mag. the shape of the coma lf in h band is quite similar to the one found inthe b band. the similarity of the lf in the optical and h bands implies that inthe central region of coma there is no new population of galaxies which is toofaint to be observed in the optical band (because dust enshrouded, forinstance), down to the magnitudes of dwarfs.

astro-ph;0012219	luminosity function of clusters of galaxies	the composite galaxy luminosity function (hereafter lf) of 39 abell clustersof galaxies is derived by computing the statistical excess of galaxy counts inthe cluster direction with respect to control fields. due to the wide fieldcoverage of the digitised poss-ii plates, we can measure field counts aroundeach cluster in a fully homogeneous way. furthermore, the availability ofvirtually unlimited sky coverage allows us to directly compute the lf errorswithout having to rely on the estimated variance of the background. the widefield coverage also allows us to derive the lf of the whole cluster, includinggalaxies located in the cluster outskirts. the global composite lf has a slopealpha ~ -1.1+/-0.2 with minor variations from blue to red filters, and m* ~-21.7,-22.2,-22.4 mag (h_0=50 km/s/mpc) in g, r and i filters, respectively.these results are in quite good agreement with several previous determinationsand in particular with the lf determined for the inner region of a largelyoverlapping set of clusters, but derived making use of a completely differentmethod for background subtraction. the similarity of the two lfs suggests theexistence of minor differences between the lf in the cluster outskirts and inthe central region, or a negligible contribution of galaxies in the clusteroutskirts to the global lf.

astro-ph;0111528	dissecting the luminosity function of the coma cluster of galaxies using  cfht wide field images	[abridged] we determined the luminosity function (lf) of the coma clustergalaxies selected by luminosity, and the lf bi-variate in central brightness.the coma cluster and control fields were imaged using the cfh12k (42x28 arcmin)and uh8k (28x28 arcmin) wide-field cameras at the cfht. selected hst imageswere used for testing. quantities were derived from measurements in at leasttwo colors, which have the following features: (1) galaxies as faint as threetimes the luminosity of the brightest globular clusters are in the completenessregion of our data. (2) we have a complete census (in the explored region) oflow surface brightness galaxies with central surface brightness galaxies almostas low as the faintest so far cataloged ones. (3) the explored area is amongthe largest ever sampled with ccds at comparable depth for any cluster ofgalaxies. (4) the error budget includes all sources of errors known to date.using hst images we also discovered that blends of globular clusters, notresolved in individual components due to seeing, look like dwarf galaxies whenobserved from the ground and are numerous and bright. the derived coma lf isrelatively steep (alpha=-1.4) over the 11 magnitudes sampled, but the slope andshape depend on color. a large population of faint low surface brightnessgalaxies was discovered, representing the largest contributor (in number) tothe lf at faint magnitudes. we found a clear progression for a faintening ofthe lf from high surface brightness galaxies (mu~20 mag/arcsec2) to galaxies ofvery faint central brightnesses (mu~24.5 mag/arcsec2), and some evidence for asteepening. compact galaxies, usually classified as stars and therefore notincluded in the lf, are found to be a minor population in coma.

astro-ph;0112471	k-band luminosity (mass) segregation in ac118 at z=0.31	using new observations of the galaxy cluster a118 at intermediate redshift(z=0.31) in the ks band, we were able to detect the cluster from the center tohalf the abell radius (1.5 mpc, ho=50 km/s/mpc) and possibly to 2.0 mpc. theanalysis of both the spatial distribution of galaxies of various luminositiesand of the luminosity function (lf) of galaxies in different cluster locationsstrongly confirms and extends to larger clustercentric radii the luminositysegregation found in a previous analysis of this cluster restricted to asmaller cluster area: there is an excess of bright galaxies in the cluster core(inside 250 kpc) or a deficit of dwarfs in the remain part of the cluster.outside the cluster core and as far as 1.5 or even 2 mpc, the giant-to-dwarfratio is constant. because of the luminosity segregation, the lf of the ac118shows a larger number of bright galaxies per unit dwarf in the core than inother cluster locations. all non-core lfs, computed at several clusterlocations, are compatible each other. these results hold both including orexcluding the galaxies located in an overdensity found in the far south ofac118 and in the second clump in galaxy density at the cluster north-west.since the near-infrared emission is a good tracer of the stellar mass, weinterpret the segregation found as a mass segregation.

astro-ph;0601167	the butcher--oemler effect at z~0.35: a change in perspective	the present paper focuses on the much debated butcher-oemler effect: theincrease with redshift of the fraction of blue galaxies in clusters.considering a representative cluster sample made of seven group/clusters atz~0.35, we have measured the blue fraction from the cluster core to the clusteroutskirts and the field mainly using wide field ctio images. this samplerepresents a random selection of a volume complete x-ray selected clustersample, selected so that there is no physical connection with the studiedquantity (blue fraction), to minimize observational biases. in order tostatistically assess the significance of the butcher-oemler effect, weintroduce the tools of bayesian inference. furthermore, we modified the bluefraction definition in order to take into account the reduced age of theuniverse at higher redshifts, because we should no longer attempt to reject anunphysical universe in which the age of the universe does depend on redshift,whereas the age of its content does not. we measured the blue fraction from thecluster center to the field and we find that the cluster affects the propertiesof the galaxies up to two virial radii at z~0.35. data suggest that during thelast 3 gyrs no evolution of the blue fraction, from the cluster core to thefield value, is seen beyond the one needed to account for the varying age withredshift of the universe and of its content. the agreement of the radialprofiles of the blue fraction at z=0 and z~0.35 implies that the pattern infalldid not change over the last 3 gyr, or, at least, its variation has noobservational effect on the studied quantity.

astro-ph;0602576	the buildup of stellar mass and the 3.6 micron luminosity function in  clusters from z=1.25 to z=0.2	we have measured the 3.6 micron luminosity evolution of about 1000 galaxiesin 32 clusters at 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.25, without any a priori assumption about luminosityevolution, i.e. in a logically rigorous way. we find that the luminosity of ourgalaxies evolves as an old and passively evolving population formed at highredshift without any need for additional redshift-dependent evolution. modelswith a prolonged stellar mass growth are rejected by the data with highconfidence. the data also reject models in which the age of the stars is thesame at all redshifts. similarly, the characteristic stellar mass evolves, inthe last two thirds of the universe age, as expected for a stellar populationformed at high redshift. together with the old age of stellar populationsderived from fundamental plane studies, our data seems to suggest thatearly-type cluster galaxies have been completely assembled at high redshift,and not only that their stars are old. the quality of the data allows us toderive the lf and mass evolution homogeneously over the whole redshift range,using a single estimator. the schechter function describes the galaxyluminosity function well. the characteristic luminosity at z=0.5 is is found tobe 16.30 mag, with an uncertainty of 10 per cent.

astro-ph;0603605	the build-up of the red sequence in the galaxy cluster ms1054-0321 at  z=0.831	using one of the deepest datasets available, we determine that the redsequence of the massive cluster ms1054-0321 at z=0.831 is well populated at allstudied magnitudes, showing no deficit of faint (down to m^*+3.5) red galaxies:the faint end of the colour-magnitude relation is neither empty norunderpopulated. the effect is quantified by the computation of the luminosityfunction (lf) of red galaxies. we found a flat slope, showing that theabundance of red galaxies is similar at faint and at intermediate magnitudes.comparison with present-day and z~0.4 lfs suggests that the slope of the lf isnot changed, within the errors, between z=0.831 and z=0. therefore, theanalysis of the lf shows no evidence for a decreasing (with magnitude orredshift) number of faint red galaxies. the presence of faint red galaxies inhigh redshift clusters disfavours scenarios where the evolution of red galaxiesis mass-dependent, because the mass dependency should differentiallydepauperate the red sequence, while the ms1054-0321 colour-magnitude relationis populated as in nearby clusters and as in z~0.4 clusters. the presence ofabundant faint red galaxies in the high redshift cluster ms1054-0321 restrictsthe room for allocating descendants of butcher-oemler galaxies, because theyshould change the faint end slope of the lf of red galaxies, while instead thesame faint end slopes are observed in ms1054-0321, at z~0 and at z~0.4. in therich ms1054-0321 cluster, the colour-magnitude relation seems to be fully inplace at z=0.831 and therefore red galaxies of all magnitudes were whollyassembled at higher redshift.

astro-ph;0606710	new evidence for a linear colour-magnitude relation and a single  schechter function for red galaxies in a nearby cluster of galaxies down to  m*+8	the colour and luminosity distributions of red galaxies in the cluster abell1185 (z=0.0325) were studied down to m*+8 in the b, v and r bands. thecolour-magnitude (hereafter cm) relation is linear without evidence for asignificant bending down to absolute magnitudes which are seldom probed inliterature (m_r=-12.5 mag). the cm relation is thin (+/-0.04 mag) and itsthickness is quite independent from the magnitude. the luminosity function ofred galaxies in abell 1185 is adequately described by a schechter function,with a characteristic magnitude and a faint end slope that also well describethe lf of red galaxies in other clusters. there is no passband dependency ofthe lf shape other than an obvious m* shift due to the colour of the consideredpopulation. finally, we conclude that, based on colours and luminosity, redgalaxies form an homogeneous population over four decades in stellar mass,providing a second evidence against faint red galaxies being a recent clusterpopulation.

astro-ph;0703255	spectral energy distributions of hard x-ray selected agns in the xmds  survey	we present the spectral energy distributions (seds) of a hard x-ray selectedsample. the sample contains 136 sources with f(2-10 kev)&gt;10^-14 erg/cm^2/s and132 are agns. the sources are detected in a 1 square degree area of thexmm-newton-medium deep survey where optical data from the vvds, cfhtls surveys,and infrared data from the swire survey are available. based on a sed fittingtechnique we derive photometric redshifts with sigma(1+z)=0.11 and 6% ofoutliers and identify agn signatures in 83% of the objects. this fraction ishigher than derived when a spectroscopic classification is available. theremaining 17+9-6% of agns shows star-forming galaxy seds (sf class). thesources with agn signatures are divided in two classes, agn1 (33+6-1%) and agn2(50+6-11). the agn1 and agn2 classes include sources whose seds are fitted bytype 1 and type 2 agn templates, respectively. on average, agn1s show softx-ray spectra, consistent with being unabsorbed, while agn2s and sfs show hardx-ray spectra, consistent with being absorbed. the analysis of the average sedsas a function of x-ray luminosity shows a reddening of the ir seds, consistentwith a decreasing contribution from the host galaxy at higher luminosities. theagns in the sf classes are likely obscured in the mid-infrared, as suggested bytheir low l(3-20micron)/lcorr(0.5-10 kev) ratios. we confirm the previouslyfound correlation for agns between the radio luminosity and the x-ray and themid-infrared luminosities. the x-ray-radio correlation can be used to identifyheavily absorbed agns. however, the estimated radio fluxes for the missing agnpopulation responsible for the bulk of the background at e&gt;10 kev are too faintto be detected even in the deepest current radio surveys.

astro-ph;0703263	obscured and unobscured agn populations in a hard-x-ray selected sample  of the xmds survey	our goal is to probe the populations of obscured and unobscured agninvestigating their optical-ir and x-ray properties as a function of x-rayflux, luminosity and redshift within a hard x-ray selected sample of 136 x-raysources in the xmm medium deep survey (xmds) with wide multiwavelengthcoverage. the xmds area is covered with optical photometry from the vvds andcfhtls surveys and infrared spitzer data. based on the x-ray luminosity andx-ray to optical ratio, 132 sources are likely agn, of which 122 haveunambiguous optical - ir identification. the observed optical and ir spectralenergy distributions of sources are fitted with agn/galaxy templates in orderto classify them and compute photometric redshifts. 70% of the agn are fittedby a type 2 agn or a star forming galaxy template and are grouped together in asingle class of ``optically obscured'' agn. they have ``red'' optical colorsand generally show significant x-ray absorption from x-ray spectra or hardnessratios (n$_h &gt; 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$). sources with seds typical of type 1 agnhave ``blue'' optical colors and exhibit x-ray absorption in about 30% ofcases. we performed a stacking analysis for obscured and type 1 agn. thestacked x-ray spectrum of obscured agn is flatter than that of type 1 agn andhas an average spectral slope of gamma = 1.6. the subsample of objects fittedby a galaxy template has an even harder stacked spectrum, with gamma = 1.2 -1.3. the obscured fraction is larger at lower fluxes, lower redshifts and lowerluminosities. x-ray absorption is less common than ``optical'' obscuration andits incidence is nearly constant with redshift and luminosity. this impliesthat x-ray absorption is not necessarily related to optical obscuration.

astro-ph;9901137	is the butcher-oemler effect a function of the cluster redshift ?	using pspc {\it rosat} data, we measure x-ray surface brightness profiles,size and luminosity of the butcher-oemler (bo) sample of clusters of galaxies.the cluster x-ray size, as measured by the petrosian r_{\eta=2} radius, doesnot change with redshift and is independent from x-ray luminosity. on the otherhand, the x-ray luminosity increases with redshift. considering that fairsamples show no-evolution, or negative luminosity evolution, we conclude thatthe bo sample is not formed from the same class of objects observed atdifferent look-back times. this is in conflict with the usual interpretation ofthe butcher-oemler as an evolutionary (or redshift-dependent) effect, based onthe assumption that we are comparing the same class of objects at differentredshifts. other trends present in the bo sample reflect selection criteriarather than differences in look-back time, as independently confirmed by thefact that trends loose strength when we enlarge the sample with x-ray selectedsample of clusters. the variety of optical sizes and shapes of the clusters inthe butcher-oemler sample, and the malmquist-like bias, are the reasons forthese selection effects that mimic the trends usually interpreted as changesdue to evolution.

astro-ph;9909223	uv (2000 a) luminosity function of coma cluster galaxies	the uv (2000 a) luminosity function (hereafter uv lf) of coma clustergalaxies, based on more than 120 members, is computed as the statisticaldifference between counts in the coma direction and in the field. our uv lf isan up-date of a preliminary constrain on the uv lf previously computed withoutthe essential background counts. the uv lf is well described by a power lawwith slope alpha~0.46, or equivalently, by a schechter function with m* muchbrighter than the brightest cluster galaxy and with a slope alpha_s~-2.0 orlarger. in spite of what happens in the optical band, low luminosity galaxiesgive a large contribution to the integral luminosity, and by inference, to thetotal metal production rate. galaxies blue in uv-b and/or b-r dominate the comacluster uv lf, both in number and luminosity. the major source of error in theestimate of the uv lf cames from the background determination in the comadirection, which is still uncertain, even though constrained at high and lowamplitudes by redshift surveys covering the studied field.

astro-ph;9911329	near-infrared luminosity function in the coma cluster	we present the near-infrared h band luminosity function (hereafter lf) of thecoma cluster of galaxies. it is the deepest ever computed in the near-infrared,for any type of environment, extending over 7 magnitudes, down to ~m_h*+6. thelf was computed on a near-infrared selected sample of galaxies whichphotometry, complete down to the typical dwarf luminosity, is presented in acompanion paper. the coma lf can be described by a schechter function withintermediate slope (alpha~-1.3), plus a dip at m_h~-22 mag. the shape of thecoma lf in h band is quite similar to the one found in the b band and, withless confidence, to the r band lf as well. the similarity of the lf in theoptical and h bands implies that in the central region of coma there is no newpopulation of galaxies which is too faint to be observed in the optical band(because dust enshrouded, for instance), down to the magnitudes of dwarfs. theexponential cut of the lf at the bright end is in good agreement with the onederived from shallower near-infrared samples of galaxies, both in clusters andin the field. this fact is suggestive of a similarity of the tip of the massfunction of galaxies, irrespective of the environment where they are found. thedip at m_h~-22 mag is instead unique among all the so far measurednear-infrared lf, although several published observations are not deep enoughor spanning a suitable wide field to distinctly detect this feature. the faintend of the lf, reaching m_h~-19 mag (roughly m_b~-15), is steep, but less thanpreviously suggested from shallower near-infrared observations of an adjacentregion in the coma cluster. the differences between our measured lf and thatmeasured previously in other regions suggests a dependency on environment ofthe faint end of the mass function (below m*+2.5).

0810.2795	the population of early-type galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;2 - new clues on their  formation and evolution	[abridged]we present the morphological analysis based on hst-nicmosobservations in the f160w filter of a sample of 32 early-type galaxies (etgs)at 1&lt;z&lt;2 with spectroscopic confirmation of their redshift and spectral type.we find that etgs at are composed of two distinct populations, an olderpopulation (oetgs) and a younger population (yetgs) whose mean ages differ byabout 1.5-2 gyr. young etgs are not denser than local ones since they followthe size-mass relation of local etgs and luminosity evolution brings them ontothe local kormendy and size-luminosity relations. on the constrary, old etgs donot follow the size-mass relation of local etgs and luminosity evolution doesnot account for the discrepancy they show with respect to the localsize-luminosity and kormendy relations. an increase of their effective radiusr_e by a factor 2.5-3 (a density decrease by a factor 15-30) from z~1.5-2 toz~0 is required to bring these galaxies onto the local scaling relations. thedifferent behaviour shown by the two populations implies different formationand evolution scenarios. the older population must have formed at higher-z in asort of dissipative gas-rich collapse ables to produce remnants which at z~2are old and compact. the size evolution they must experience from z~2 to z~0has to leave unchanged their mass to not exceed the local number of high-massetgs. thus, major merging cannot fit this requirement. the younger populationof etgs can be formed later through subsequent episodes of merging whichincreased progressively their size and assembled their mass down to z~2. at z&lt;2they evolve purely in luminosity since episodes of major merging would bringthem far from the local scaling relations.
