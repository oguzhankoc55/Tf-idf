0909.2875	a search for additional planets in the nasa epoxi observations of the  exoplanet system gj 436	we present time series photometry of the m dwarf transiting exoplanet systemgj 436 obtained with the the epoch (extrasolar planet observation andcharacterization) component of the nasa epoxi mission. we conduct a search ofthe high-precision time series for additional planets around gj 436, whichcould be revealed either directly through their photometric transits, orindirectly through the variations these second planets induce on the transitsof the previously known planet. in the case of gj 436, the presence of a secondplanet is perhaps indicated by the residual orbital eccentricity of the knownhot neptune companion. we find no candidate transits with significance higherthan our detection limit. from monte carlo tests of the time series, we ruleout transiting planets larger than 1.5 r_earth interior to gj 436b with 95%confidence, and larger than 1.25 r_earth with 80% confidence. assumingcoplanarity of additional planets with the orbit of gj 436b, we cannot expectthat putative planets with orbital periods longer than about 3.4 days willtransit. however, if such a planet were to transit, we rule out planets largerthan 2.0 r_earth with orbital periods less than 8.5 days with 95% confidence.we also place dynamical constraints on additional bodies in the gj 436 system.our analysis should serve as a useful guide for similar analyses for whichradial velocity measurements are not available, such as those discovered by thekepler mission. these dynamical constraints on additional planets with periodsfrom 0.5 to 9 days rule out coplanar secular perturbers as small as 10 m_earthand non-coplanar secular perturbers as small as 1 m_earth in orbits close in togj 436b. we present refined estimates of the system parameters for gj 436. wealso report a sinusoidal modulation in the gj 436 light curve that we attributeto star spots.

0909.3073	detection of planetary emission from the exoplanet tres-2 using spitzer  /irac	we present here the results of our observations of tres-2 using the infraredarray camera on spitzer. we monitored this transiting system during twosecondary eclipses, when the planetary emission is blocked by the star. theresulting decrease in flux is 0.127%+-0.021%, 0.230%+-0.024%, 0.199%+-0.054%,and 0.359%+-0.060%, at 3.6 microns, 4.5 microns, 5.8 microns, and 8.0 microns,respectively. we show that three of these flux contrasts are well fit by ablack body spectrum with t_{eff}=1500 k, as well as by a more detailed modelspectrum of a planetary atmosphere. the observed planet-to-star flux ratios inall four irac channels can be explained by models with and without a thermalinversion in the atmosphere of tres-2, although with different atmosphericchemistry. based on the assumption of thermochemical equilibrium, the chemicalcomposition of the inversion model seems more plausible, making it a morefavorable scenario. tres-2 also falls in the category of highly irradiatedplanets which have been theoretically predicted to exhibit thermal inversions.however, more observations at infrared and visible wavelengths would be neededto confirm a thermal inversion in this system. furthermore, we find that thetimes of the secondary eclipses are consistent with previously published timesof transit and the expectation from a circular orbit. this implies that tres-2most likely has a circular orbit, and thus does not obtain additional thermalenergy from tidal dissipation of a non-zero orbital eccentricity, a proposedexplanation for the large radius of this planet.

0909.5221	the broadband infrared emission spectrum of the exoplanet tres-3	we use the spitzer space telescope to estimate the dayside thermal emissionof the exoplanet tres-3 integrated in the 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 micronbandpasses of the infrared array camera (irac) instrument. we observe twosecondary eclipses and find relative eclipse depths of 0.00346 +/- 0.00035,0.00372 +/- 0.00054, 0.00449 +/- 0.00097, and 0.00475 +/- 0.00046, respectivelyin the 4 irac bandpasses. we combine our results with the earlier k bandmeasurement of de mooij et al. (2009), and compare them with models of theplanetary emission. we find that the planet does not require the presence of aninversion layer in the high atmosphere. this is the first very stronglyirradiated planet that does not have a temperature inversion, which indicatesthat stellar or planetary characteristics other than temperature have animportant impact on temperature inversion. de mooij &amp; snellen (2009) alsodetected a possible slight offset in the timing of the secondary eclipse in kband. however, based on our 4 spitzer channels, we place a 3sigma upper limitof |ecos(w)| &lt; 0.0056 where e is the planets orbital eccentricity and w is thelongitude of the periastron. this result strongly indicates that the orbit iscircular, as expected from tidal circularization theory.

0911.2218	spitzer irac secondary eclipse photometry of the transiting extrasolar  planet hat-p-1b	we report spitzer/irac photometry of the transiting giant exoplanet hat-p-1bduring its secondary eclipse. this planet lies near the postulated boundarybetween the pm and pl-class of hot jupiters, and is important as a test ofmodels for temperature inversions in hot jupiter atmospheres. we derive eclipsedepths for hat-p-1b, in units of the stellar flux, that are: 0.080% +/-0.008%,[3.6um], 0.135% +/- 0.022%,[4.5um],0.203% +/- 0.031%,[5.8um], and$0.238% +/- 0.040%,[8.0um]. these values are best fit using an atmosphere witha modest temperature inversion, intermediate between the archetype invertedatmosphere (hd209458b) and a model without an inversion. the observations alsosuggest that this planet is radiating a large fraction of the available stellarirradiance on its dayside, with little available for redistribution bycirculation. this planet has sometimes been speculated to be inflated by tidaldissipation, based on its large radius in discovery observations, and on anon-zero orbital eccentricity allowed by the radial velocity data. the timingof the secondary eclipse is very sensitive to orbital eccentricity, and we findthat the central phase of the eclipse is 0.4999 +/- 0.0005. the differencebetween the expected and observed phase indicates that the orbit is close tocircular, with a 3-sigma limit of |e cosw| &lt; 0.002.

0707.2778	spitzer transit and secondary eclipse photometry of gj 436b	we report the results of infrared (8 micron) transit and secondary eclipsephotometry of the hot neptune exoplanet, gj436b using spitzer. the nearlyphoton-limited precision of these data allow us to measure an improved radiusfor the planet, and to detect the secondary eclipse. the transit (centered athjd = 2454280.78149 +/-0.00016) shows the flat-bottomed shape typical ofinfrared transits, and it precisely defines the planet-to-star radius ratio(0.0839 +/-0.0005), independent of the stellar properties. however, we obtainthe planetary radius, as well as the stellar mass and radius, by fitting to thetransit curve simultaneously with an empirical mass-radius relation form-dwarfs (m=r). we find rs=ms=0.47 +/-0.02 in solar units, and rp=27,600+/-1170 km (4.33 +/-0.18 earth radii). this radius significantly exceeds theradius of a naked ocean planet, and requires a gasesous hydrogen-heliumenvelope. the secondary eclipse occurs at phase 0.587 +/-0.005, proving asignificant orbital eccentricity (e=0.15 +/-0.012). the amplitude of theeclipse (5.7 +/-0.8e-4) indicates a brightness temperature for the planet oft=712 +/-36k. if this is indicative of the planet's physical temperature, itsuggests the occurrence of tidal heating in the planet. an uncharacterizedsecond planet likely provides ongoing gravitational perturbations, to maintaingj436b's orbit eccentricity over long time scales.

0912.2132	studying the atmosphere of the exoplanet hat-p-7b via secondary eclipse  measurements with epoxi, spitzer and kepler	the highly irradiated transiting exoplanet, hat-p-7b, currently provides oneof the best opportunities for studying planetary emission in the optical andinfrared wavelengths. we observe six near-consecutive secondary eclipses ofhat-p-7b at optical wavelengths with the epoxi spacecraft. we place an upperlimit on the relative eclipse depth of 0.055% (95% confidence). we also analyzespitzer observations of the same target in the infrared, obtaining secondaryeclipse depths of 0.098+/-0.017%, 0.159+/-0.022%, 0.245+/-0.031% and0.225+/-0.052% in the 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8.0 micron irac bands respectively. wecombine these measurements with the recently published kepler secondary eclipsemeasurement, and generate atmospheric models for the day-side of the planetthat are consistent with both the optical and infrared measurements. the dataare best fit by models with a temperature inversion, as expected from the highincident flux. the models predict a low optical albedo of ~&lt; 0.13, withsubsolar abundances of na, k, tio and vo. we also find that the best fittingmodels predict that 10% of the absorbed stellar flux is redistributed to thenight side of the planet, which is qualitatively consistent with theinefficient day-night redistribution apparent in the kepler phase curve. modelswithout thermal inversions fit the data only at the 1.25 sigma level, and alsorequire an overabundance of methane, which is not expected in the very hotatmosphere of hat-p-7b. we also analyze the eight transits of hat-p-7b presentin the epoxi dataset and improve the constraints on the system parameters,finding a period of p = 2.2047308+/-0.0000025 days, a stellar radius of r* =1.824+/-0.089rsun, a planetary radius of rp = 1.342+/-0.068rjup and aninclination of i = 85.7+3.5-2.2 deg.

1003.2763	on the orbit of exoplanet wasp-12b	we observed two secondary eclipses of the exoplanet wasp-12b using theinfrared array camera on the spitzer space telescope. the close proximity ofwasp-12b to its g-type star results in extreme tidal forces capable of inducingapsidal precession with a period as short as a few decades. this precessionwould be measurable if the orbit had a significant eccentricity, leading to anestimate of the tidal love number and an assessment of the degree of centralconcentration in the planetary interior. an initial ground-based secondaryeclipse phase reported by lopez-morales et al. (0.510 +/- 0.002) impliedeccentricity at the 4.5 sigma level. the spectroscopic orbit of hebb et al. haseccentricity 0.049 +/- 0.015, a 3 sigma result, implying an eclipse phase of0.509 +/- 0.007. however, there is a well documented tendency of spectroscopicdata to overestimate small eccentricities. our eclipse phases are 0.5010 +/-0.0006 (3.6 and 5.8 microns) and 0.5006 +/- 0.0007 (4.5 and 8.0 microns). anunlikely orbital precession scenario invoking an alignment of the orbit duringthe spitzer observations could have explained this apparent discrepancy, butthe final eclipse phase of lopez-morales et al. (0.510 -0.006 / +0.007) isconsistent with a circular orbit at better than 2 sigma. an orbit fit to allthe available transit, eclipse, and radial-velocity data indicates precessionat &lt;1 sigma; a non-precessing solution fits better. we also comment on analysisand reporting for spitzer exoplanet data in light of recent re-analyses.

1010.4591	possible thermochemical disequilibrium in the atmosphere of the  exoplanet gj 436b	the nearby extrasolar planet gj 436b--which has been labelled as a 'hotneptune'--reveals itself by the dimming of light as it crosses in front of andbehind its parent star as seen from earth. respectively known as the primarytransit and secondary eclipse, the former constrains the planet's radius andmass, and the latter constrains the planet's temperature and, with measurementsat multiple wavelengths, its atmospheric composition. previous work usingtransmission spectroscopy failed to detect the 1.4-\mu m water vapour band,leaving the planet's atmospheric composition poorly constrained. here we reportthe detection of planetary thermal emission from the dayside of gj 436b atmultiple infrared wavelengths during the secondary eclipse. the best-fitcompositional models contain a high co abundance and a substantial methane(ch4) deficiency relative to thermochemical equilibrium models for thepredicted hydrogen-dominated atmosphere. moreover, we report the presence ofsome h2o and traces of co2. because ch4 is expected to be the dominantcarbon-bearing species, disequilibrium processes such as vertical mixing andpolymerization of methane into substances such as ethylene may be required toexplain the hot neptune's small ch4-to-co ratio, which is at least 10^5 timessmaller than predicted.

1011.1019	warm spitzer photometry of the transiting exoplanets corot-1 and corot-2  at secondary eclipse	we measure secondary eclipses of the hot giant exoplanets corot-1 at 3.6 and4.5 microns, and corot-2 at 3.6 microns, both using warm spitzer. we find thatthe warm spitzer mission is working very well for exoplanet science. forconsistency of our analysis we also re-analyze archival cryogenic spitzer datafor secondary eclipses of corot-2 at 4.5 and 8 microns. we compare the totaldata for both planets, including optical eclipse measurements by the corotmission, and ground-based eclipse measurements at 2 microns, to existingmodels. both planets exhibit stronger eclipses at 4.5 than at 3.6 microns,which is often indicative of an atmospheric temperature inversion. the spectrumof corot-1 is best reproduced by a 2460k blackbody, due either to a highaltitude layer that strongly absorbs stellar irradiance, or an isothermalregion in the planetary atmosphere. the spectrum of corot-2 is unusual becausethe 8 micron contrast is anomalously low. non-inverted atmospheres couldpotentially produce the corot-2 spectrum if the planet exhibits line emissionfrom co at 4.5 microns, caused by tidal-induced mass loss. however, theviability of that hypothesis is questionable because the emitting region cannotbe more than about 30-percent larger than the planet's transit radius, based onthe ingress and egress times at eclipse. an alternative possibility to accountfor the spectrum of corot-2 is an additional opacity source that acts stronglyat wavelengths less than 5 microns, heating the upper atmosphere while allowingthe deeper atmosphere seen at 8 microns to remain cooler. we obtain a similarresult as gillon et al. for the phase of the secondary eclipse of corot-2,implying an eccentric orbit with e*cos(omega)=-0.0030 +/- 0.0004.

(2010). we also find no evidence for an offset in the timing of thesecondary eclipse and place a 2 sigma upper limit on |ecos(omega)| of 0.0024,which constrains the range of tidal heating models that could explain thisplanet's inflated radius.

1012.1603	high c/o ratio and weak thermal inversion in the very hot atmosphere of  exoplanet wasp-12b	the carbon-to-oxygen ratio (c/o) in a planet provides critical informationabout its primordial origins and subsequent evolution. a primordial c/o greaterthan 0.8 causes a carbide-dominated interior as opposed to a silicate-dominatedcomposition as found on earth, and the atmospheres can also differ from thosein the solar system. the solar c/o is 0.54. here we report an analysis ofdayside multi-wavelength photometry of the transiting hot-jupiter wasp-12b thatreveals c/o &gt;= 1 in its atmosphere. the atmosphere is abundant in co. it isdepleted in water vapor and enhanced in methane by over two orders of magnitudeeach compared to a solar-abundance chemical-equilibrium model at the expectedtemperatures. we also find that the extremely irradiated atmosphere (t &gt; 2,500k) of wasp-12b lacks a prominent thermal inversion, or a stratosphere, and hasvery efficient day- night energy circulation. the absence of a strong thermalinversion is in stark contrast to theoretical predictions for the most highlyirradiated hot-jupiter atmospheres.

1102.4345	rotational variability of earth's polar regions: implications for  detecting snowball planets	we have obtained the first time-resolved, disc-integrated observations ofearth's poles with the deep impact spacecraft as part of the epoxi mission ofopportunity. these data mimic what we will see when we point next-generationspace telescopes at nearby exoplanets. we use principal component analysis(pca) and rotational lightcurve inversion to characterize color inhomogeneitiesand map their spatial distribution from these unusual vantage points, as acomplement to the equatorial views presented in cowan et al. (2009). we alsoperform the same pca on a suite of simulated rotational multi-band lightcurvesfrom nasa's virtual planetary laboratory 3d spectral earth model. thisnumerical experiment allows us to understand what sorts of surface features pcacan robustly identify. we find that the epoxi polar observations have similarbroadband colors as the equatorial earth, but with 20-30% greater apparentalbedo. this is because the polar observations are most sensitive tomid-latitudes, which tend to be more cloudy than the equatorial latitudesemphasized by the original epoxi earth observations. the cloudiness of themid-latitudes also manifests itself in the form of increased variability atshort wavelengths in the polar observations, and as a dominant gray eigencolorin the south polar observation. we construct a simple reflectance model for asnowball earth. by construction, our model has a higher bond albedo than themodern earth; its surface albedo is so high that rayleigh scattering does notnoticeably affect its spectrum. the rotational color variations occur at shortwavelengths due to the large contrast between glacier ice and bare land inthose wavebands. thus we find that both the broadband colors and diurnal colorvariations of such a planet would be easily distinguishable from the modern-dayearth, regardless of viewing angle.

1104.2901	a spitzer transmission spectrum for the exoplanet gj 436b, evidence for  stellar variability, and constraints on dayside flux variations	in this paper we describe a uniform analysis of eight transits and elevensecondary eclipses of the extrasolar planet gj 436b obtained in the 3.6, 4.5,and 8.0 micron bands using the irac instrument on the spitzer space telescopebetween ut 2007 june 29 and ut 2009 feb 4. we find that the best-fit transitdepths for visits in the same bandpass can vary by as much as 8% of the total(4.7 sigma significance) from one epoch to the next. although we cannotentirely rule out residual detector effects or a time-varying, high-altitudecloud layer in the planet's atmosphere as the cause of these variations, weconsider the occultation of active regions on the star in a subset of thetransit observations to be the most likely explanation. we reconcile thepresence of magnetically active regions with the lack of significant visible orinfrared flux variations from the star by proposing that the star's spin axisis tilted with respect to our line of sight, and that the planet's orbit istherefore likely to be misaligned. these observations serve to illustrate thechallenges associated with transmission spectroscopy of planets orbitinglate-type stars; we expect that other systems, such as gj 1214, may displaycomparably variable transit depths. our measured 8 micron secondary eclipsedepths are consistent with a constant value, and we place a 1 sigma upper limitof 17% on changes in the planet's dayside flux in this band. averaging over theeleven visits gives us an improved estimate of 0.0452% +/- 0.0027% for thesecondary eclipse depth. we combine timing information from our observationswith previously published data to produce a refined orbital ephemeris, anddetermine that the best-fit transit and eclipse times are consistent with aconstant orbital period.

1105.4647	kepler-10c, a 2.2-earth radius transiting planet in a multiple system	the kepler mission has recently announced the discovery of kepler-10 b, thesmallest exoplanet discovered to date and the first rocky planet found by thespacecraft. a second, 45-day period transit-like signal present in thephotometry from the first eight months of data could not be confirmed as beingcaused by a planet at the time of that announcement. here we apply thelight-curve modeling technique known as blender to explore the possibility thatthe signal might be due to an astrophysical false positive (blend). to aid inthis analysis we report the observation of two transits with the spitzer spacetelescope at 4.5 {\mu}m. when combined they yield a transit depth of 344 \pm 85ppm that is consistent with the depth in the kepler passband (376 \pm 9 ppm,ignoring limb darkening), which rules out blends with an eclipsing binary of asignificantly different color than the target. using these observations alongwith other constraints from high resolution imaging and spectroscopy we areable to exclude the vast majority of possible false positives. we assess thelikelihood of the remaining blends, and arrive conservatively at a false alarmrate of 1.6 \times 10-5 that is small enough to validate the candidate as aplanet (designated kepler-10 c) with a very high level of confidence. theradius of this object is measured to be rp = 2.227+0.052 -0.057 earth radii.kepler-10 c represents another example (with kepler-9 d and kepler-11 g) ofstatistical "validation" of a transiting exoplanet, as opposed to the usual"confirmation" that can take place when the doppler signal is detected ortransit timing variations are measured. it is anticipated that many of kepler'ssmaller candidates will receive a similar treatment since dynamicalconfirmation may be difficult or impractical with the sensitivity of currentinstrumentation.

1107.2977	kepler and ground-based transits of the exo-neptune hat-p-11b	we analyze 26 archival kepler transits of the exo-neptune hat-p-11b,supplemented by ground-based transits observed in the blue (b-band) and near-ir(j-band). both the planet and host star are smaller than previously believed;our analysis yields rp=4.31 +/-0.06 earth-radii, and rs = 0.683 +/-0.009 solarradii, both about 3-sigma smaller than the discovery values. our ground-basedtransit data at wavelengths bracketing the kepler bandpass serve to check thewavelength dependence of stellar limb darkening, and the j-band transitprovides a precise and independent constraint on the transit duration. both thelimb darkening and transit duration from our ground-based data are consistentwith the new kepler values for the system parameters. our smaller radius forthe planet implies that its gaseous envelope can be less extensive thanpreviously believed, being very similar to the h-he envelope of gj436b andkepler-4b. hat-p-11 is an active star, and signatures of star spot crossingsare ubiquitous in the kepler transit data. we develop and apply a methodologyto correct the planetary radius for the presence of both crossed and uncrossedstar spots. star spot crossings are concentrated at phases -0.002 and +0.006.this is consistent with inferences from rossiter-mclaughlin measurements thatthe planet transits nearly perpendicular to the stellar equator. we identifythe dominant phases of star spot crossings with active latitudes on the star,and we infer that the stellar rotational pole is inclined at about 12 +/-5degrees to the plane of the sky. we point out that precise transit measurementsover long durations could in principle allow us to construct a stellarbutterfly diagram, to probe the cyclic evolution of magnetic activity on thisactive k-dwarf star.

1107.5750	the hot-jupiter kepler-17b: discovery, obliquity from stroboscopic  starspots, and atmospheric characterization	this paper reports the discovery and characterization of the transiting hotgiant exoplanet kepler-17b. the planet has an orbital period of 1.486 days, andradial velocity measurements from the hobby-eberly telescope (het) show adoppler signal of 420+/-15 m.s-1. from a transit-based estimate of the hoststar's mean density, combined with an estimate of the stellar effectivetemperature t_eff=5630+/-100 k from high-resolution spectra, we infer a stellarhost mass of 1.061+/-0.067 m_sun and a stellar radius of 1.019+/-0.033 r_jup.we estimate the planet mass and radius to be mp=2.450+/-0.114 m_jup andrp=1.312+/-0.018 r_jup and a planet density near 1.35 g.cm-3. the host star isactive, with dark spots that are frequently occulted by the planet. thecontinuous monitoring of the star reveals a stellar rotation period of 11.89days, 8 times the the planet's orbital period; this period ratio producesstroboscopic effects on the occulted starspots. the temporal pattern of thesespot-crossing events shows that the planet's orbit is prograde and the star'sobliquity is smaller than 15 deg. we detected planetary occultations ofkepler-17b with both the kepler and spitzer space telescopes. we use theseobservations to constrain the eccentricity, e, and find that it is consistentwith a circular orbit (e&lt;0.0011). the brightness temperatures of the planet theinfrared bandpasses are t_3.6um=1880+/-100 k and t4.5um=1770+/-150 k. wemeasure the optical geometric albedo a_g in the kepler bandpass and find a_g =0.10+/-0.02. the observations are best described by atmospheric models forwhich most of the incident energy is re-radiated away from the day side.

1109.1611	discovery and atmospheric characterization of giant planet kepler-12b:  an inflated radius outlier	we report the discovery of planet kepler-12b (koi-20), which at 1.695\pm0.030rj is among the handful of planets with super-inflated radii above 1.65 rj.orbiting its slightly evolved g0 host with a 4.438-day period, this0.431\pm0.041 mj planet is the least-irradiated within thislargest-planet-radius group, which has important implications for planetaryphysics. the planet's inflated radius and low mass lead to a very low densityof 0.111\pm0.010 g cm-3. we detect the occultation of the planet at asignificance of 3.7{\sigma} in the kepler bandpass. this yields a geometricalbedo of 0.14\pm0.04; the planetary flux is due to a combination of scatteredlight and emitted thermal flux. we use multiple observations with warm spitzerto detect the occultation at 7{\sigma} and 4{\sigma} in the 3.6 and 4.5 {\mu}mbandpasses, respectively. the occultation photometry timing is consistent witha circular orbit, at e &lt; 0.01 (1{\sigma}), and e &lt; 0.09 (3{\sigma}). theoccultation detections across the three bands favor an atmospheric model withno dayside temperature inversion. the kepler occultation detection providessignificant leverage, but conclusions regarding temperature structure arepreliminary, given our ignorance of opacity sources at optical wavelengths inhot jupiter atmospheres. if kepler-12b and hd 209458b, which intercept similarincident stellar fluxes, have the same heavy element masses, the interiorenergy source needed to explain the large radius of kepler-12b is three timeslarger than that of hd 209458b. this may suggest that more than oneradius-inflation mechanism is at work for kepler-12b, or that it is lessheavy-element rich than other transiting planets.

1110.0820	kepler 18-b, c, and d: a system of three planets confirmed by transit  timing variations, lightcurve validation, spitzer photometry and radial  velocity measurements	we report the detection of three transiting planets around a sunlike star,which we designate kepler-18. the transit signals were detected in photometricdata from the kepler satellite, and were confirmed to arise from planets usinga combination of large transit-timing variations, radial-velocity variations,warm-spitzer observations, and statistical analysis of false-positiveprobabilities. the kepler-18 star has a mass of 0.97m_sun, radius 1.1r_sun,effective temperature 5345k, and iron abundance [fe/h]= +0.19. the planets haveorbital periods of approximately 3.5, 7.6 and 14.9 days. the innermost planet"b" is a "super-earth" with mass 6.9 \pm 3.4m_earth, radius 2.00 \pm0.10r_earth, and mean density 4.9 \pm 2.4 g cm^-3. the two outer planets "c"and "d" are both low-density neptune-mass planets. kepler-18c has a mass of17.3 \pm 1.9m_earth, radius 5.49 \pm 0.26r_earth, and mean density 0.59 \pm0.07 g cm^-3, while kepler-18d has a mass of 16.4 \pm 1.4m_earth, radius 6.98\pm 0.33r_earth, and mean density 0.27 \pm 0.03 g cm^-3. kepler-18c andkepler-18d have orbital periods near a 2:1 mean-motion resonance, leading tolarge and readily detected transit timing variations.

1111.5858	warm spitzer photometry of xo-4b, hat-p-6b and hat-p-8b	we have analyzed warm spitzer/irac observations of the secondary eclipses ofthree planets, xo-4b, hat-p-6b and hat-p-8b. we measure secondary eclipseamplitudes at 3.6{\mu}m and 4.5{\mu}m for each target. xo-4b exhibits astronger eclipse depth at 4.5{\mu}m than at 3.6{\mu}m, which is consistent withthe presence of a temperature inversion. hat-p-8b shows a stronger eclipseamplitude at 3.6{\mu}m, and is best-described by models without a temperatureinversion. the eclipse depths of hat-p-6b can be fitted with models with asmall or no temperature inversion. we consider our results in the context of apostulated relationship between stellar activity and temperature inversions anda relationship between irradiation level and planet dayside temperature, asdiscussed by knutson et al. (2010) and cowan &amp; agol (2011), respectively. ourresults are consistent with these hypotheses, but do not significantlystrengthen them. to measure accurate secondary eclipse central phases, werequire accurate ephemerides. we obtain primary transit observations andsupplement them with publicly available observations to update the orbitalephemerides of the three planets. based on the secondary eclipse timing, we setupper boundaries for e cos(\omega) for hat-p-6b, hat-p-8b and xo-4b and findthat the values are consistent with circular orbits.

0710.4145	observations of extrasolar planets during the non-cryogenic spitzer  space telescope mission	precision infrared photometry from spitzer has enabled the first directstudies of light from extrasolar planets, via observations at secondary eclipsein transiting systems. current spitzer results include the first longitudinaltemperature map of an extrasolar planet, and the first spectra of theiratmospheres. spitzer has also measured a temperature and precise radius for thefirst transiting neptune-sized exoplanet, and is beginning to make precisetransit timing measurements to infer the existence of unseen low mass planets.the lack of stellar limb darkening in the infrared facilitates precise radiusand transit timing measurements of transiting planets. warm spitzer will becapable of a precise radius measurement for earth-sized planets transitingnearby m-dwarfs, thereby constraining their bulk composition. it will continueto measure thermal emission at secondary eclipse for transiting hot jupiters,and be able to distinguish between planets having broad band emission versusabsorption spectra. it will also be able to measure the orbital phase variationof thermal emission for close-in planets, even non-transiting planets, andthese measurements will be of special interest for planets in eccentric orbits.warm spitzer will be a significant complement to kepler, particularly asregards transit timing in the kepler field. in addition to studying close-inplanets, warm spitzer will have significant application in sensitive imagingsearches for young planets at relatively large angular separations from theirparent stars.

1202.1562	spitzer/mips 24 micron observations of hd 209458b: 3 eclipses, 2.5  transits, and a phase curve corrupted by instrumental sensitivity variations	we report the results of an analysis of all spitzer/mips 24 micronobservations of hd 209458b, one of the touchstone objects in the study ofirradiated giant planet atmospheres. altogether we analyze 2.5 transits, 3eclipses, and a 58-hour near-continuous observation designed to detect theplanet's thermal phase curve. the results of our analysis are: (1) a meantransit depth of 1.484% +/- 0.035%, consistent with previous measurements andshowing no evidence of variability in transit depth at the 3% level. (2) a meaneclipse depth of 0.332% +/- 0.026%, somewhat higher than that previouslyreported for this system; this new value brings observations into betteragreement with models. the dayside flux shows no evidence of variability at the12% level. (3) eclipses in the system occur 32 s +/- 129 s earlier than wouldbe expected from a circular orbit, which constrains the orbital quantity (e cosomega) to be 0.00004 +/- 0.00033. this result is fully consistent with acircular orbit and sets an upper limit of 140 m/s (3 sigma) on anyeccentricity-induced velocity offset during transit. the phase curveobservations (including one of the transits) exhibit an anomalous trend similarto the detector ramp seen in previous spitzer/irac observations; by modelingthis ramp we recover the system parameters. the photometry which follows theramp and transit exhibits a gradual, ~0.2% decrease in flux, similar to thatseen in pre-launch calibration data. the large uncertainties associated withthis poorly-understood, likely instrumental effect prevent us from usefullyconstraining the planet's thermal phase curve. our observations highlight theneed for a thorough understanding of detector-related instrumental effects onlong time scales when making the high-precision mid-infrared measurementsplanned for future missions such as echo, spica, and jwst.

1205.1766	detection of thermal emission from a super-earth	we report on the detection of infrared light from the super-earth 55 cnc e,based on four occultations obtained with warm spitzer at 4.5 microns. our dataanalysis consists of a two-part process. in a first step, we perform individualanalyses of each dataset and compare several baseline models to optimallyaccount for the systematics affecting each lightcurve. we apply independentphotometric correction techniques, including polynomial detrending andpixel-mapping, that yield consistent results at the 1-sigma level. in a secondstep, we perform a global mcmc analysis including all four datasets, thatyields an occultation depth of 131+-28ppm, translating to a brightnesstemperature of 2360+-300 k in the irac-4.5 micron channel. this occultationdepth suggests a low bond albedo coupled to an inefficient heat transport fromthe planetary dayside to the nightside, or else possibly that the 4.5-micronobservations probe atmospheric layers that are hotter than the maximumequilibrium temperature (i.e., a thermal inversion layer or a deep hot layer).the measured occultation phase and duration are consistent with a circularorbit and improves the 3-sigma upper limit on 55 cnc e's orbital eccentricityfrom 0.25 to 0.06.

1206.0774	infrared eclipses of the strongly irradiated planet wasp-33b, and  oscillations of its host star	we observe two secondary eclipses of the strongly irradiated transitingplanet wasp-33b in the ks band, and one secondary eclipse each at 3.6- and 4.5microns using warm spitzer. this planet orbits an a5v delta-scuti star that isknown to exhibit low amplitude non-radial p-mode oscillations at about0.1-percent semi-amplitude. we detect stellar oscillations in all of ourinfrared eclipse data, and also in one night of observations at j-band out ofeclipse. the oscillation amplitude, in all infrared bands except ks, is aboutthe same as in the optical. however, the stellar oscillations in ks band haveabout twice the amplitude as seen in the optical, possibly because thebrackett-gamma line falls in this bandpass. we use our best-fit values for theeclipse depth, as well as the 0.9 micron eclipse observed by smith et al., toexplore possible states of the exoplanetary atmosphere, based on the method ofmadhusudhan and seager. on this basis we find two possible states for theatmospheric structure of wasp-33b. one possibility is a non-invertedtemperature structure in spite of the strong irradiance, but this modelrequires an enhanced carbon abundance (c/o&gt;1). the alternative model has solarcomposition, but an inverted temperature structure. spectroscopy of the planetat secondary eclipse, using a spectral resolution that can resolve the watervapor band structure, should be able to break the degeneracy between these verydifferent possible states of the exoplanetary atmosphere. however, both ofthose model atmospheres absorb nearly all of the stellar irradiance withminimal longitudinal re-distribution of energy, strengthening the hypothesis ofcowan et al. that the most strongly irradiated planets circulate energy poorly.our measurement of the central phase of the eclipse yields e*cos(omega)=0.0003+/-0.00013, which we regard as being consistent with a circular orbit.

(2011). in total,we analyse 14 transits of gj1214b at 4.5 microns, 3 transits at 3.6 microns,and 7 new ground-based transits in the i+z band. our new spitzer data bythemselves eliminate cloudless solar composition atmospheres for gj1214b, andmethane-rich models from howe &amp; burrows (2012). using our new spitzermeasurements to anchor the observed transit radii of gj1214b at longwavelengths, and adding new measurements in i+z, we evaluate models frombenneke &amp; seager (2012) and howe &amp; burrows (2012) using a chi-squared analysis.we find that the best-fit model exhibits an increase in transit radius at shortwavelengths due to rayleigh scattering. pure water atmospheres are alsopossible. however, a flat line (no atmosphere detected) remains among the bestof the statistically acceptable models, and better than pure water atmospheres.we explore the effect of systematic differences among results from differentobservational groups, and we find that the howe &amp; burrows (2012) tholin-hazemodel remains the best fit, even when systematic differences among observersare considered.

1302.1141	infrared transmission spectroscopy of the exoplanets hd209458b and xo-1b  using the wide field camera-3 on the hubble space telescope	exoplanetary transmission spectroscopy in the near-infrared usinghubble/nicmos is currently ambiguous because different observational groupsclaim different results from the same data, depending on their analysismethodologies. spatial scanning with hubble/wfc3 provides an opportunity toresolve this ambiguity. we here report wfc3 spectroscopy of the giant planetshd209458b and xo-1b in transit, using spatial scanning mode for maximumphoton-collecting efficiency. we introduce an analysis technique that derivesthe exoplanetary transmission spectrum without the necessity of explicitlydecorrelating instrumental effects, and achieves nearly photon-limitedprecision even at the high flux levels collected in spatial scan mode. ourerrors are within 6-percent (xo-1) and 26-percent (hd209458b) of thephoton-limit at a spectral resolving power of 70, and are better than0.01-percent per spectral channel. both planets exhibit water absorption ofapproximately 200 ppm at the water peak near 1.38 microns. our result for xo-1bcontradicts the much larger absorption derived from nicmos spectroscopy. theweak water absorption we measure for hd209458b is reminiscent of the weaknessof sodium absorption in the first transmission spectroscopy of an exoplanetatmosphere by charbonneau et al. (2002). model atmospheres havinguniformly-distributed extra opacity of 0.012 cm^2 per gram accountapproximately for both our water measurement and the sodium absorption in thisplanet. our results for hd209458b support the picture advocated by pont et al.(2013) in which weak molecular absorptions are superposed on a transmissionspectrum that is dominated by continuous opacity due to haze and/or dust.however, the extra opacity needed for hd209458b is grayer than for hd189733b,with a weaker rayleigh component.

1401.0022	clouds in the atmosphere of the super-earth exoplanet gj 1214b	recent surveys have revealed that planets intermediate in size between earthand neptune ("super-earths") are among the most common planets in the galaxy.atmospheric studies are the next step toward developing a comprehensiveunderstanding of this new class of object. much effort has been focused onusing transmission spectroscopy to characterize the atmosphere of thesuper-earth archetype gj 1214b, but previous observations did not havesufficient precision to distinguish between two interpretations for theatmosphere. the planet's atmosphere could be dominated by relatively heavymolecules, such as water (e.g., a 100% water vapor composition), or it couldcontain high-altitude clouds that obscure its lower layers. here we report ameasurement of the transmission spectrum of gj 1214b at near-infraredwavelengths that definitively resolves this ambiguity. these data, obtainedwith the hubble space telescope, are sufficiently precise to detect absorptionfeatures from a high mean molecular mass atmosphere. the observed spectrum,however, is featureless. we rule out cloud-free atmospheric models with water-,methane-, carbon monoxide-, nitrogen-, or carbon dioxide-dominated compositionsat greater than 5$\sigma$ confidence. the planet's atmosphere must containclouds to be consistent with the data.

1401.4464	the emergent 1.1-1.7 micron spectrum of the exoplanet corot-2b as  measured using the hubble space telescope	we have used hubble/wfc3 and the g141 grism to measure the secondary eclipseof the transiting very hot jupiter corot-2b in the 1.1-1.7$\mu$m spectralregion. we find an eclipse depth averaged over this band equal to$395^{+69}_{-45}$ parts per million, equivalent to a blackbody temperature of$1788\pm18$k. we study and characterize several wfc3 instrumental effects,especially the "hook" phenomenon described by deming et al. (2013). we use datafrom several transiting exoplanet systems to find a quantitative relationbetween the amplitude of the hook and the exposure level of a given pixel.although the uncertainties in this relation are too large to allow us todevelop an empirical correction for our data, our study provides a useful guidefor optimizing exposure levels in future wfc3 observations. we derive theplanet's spectrum using a differential method. the planet-to-star contrastincreases to longer wavelength within the wfc3 bandpass, but without waterabsorption or emission to a $3\sigma$ limit of 85 ppm. the slope of the wfc3spectrum is significantly less than the slope of the best-fit blackbody. wecompare all existing eclipse data for this planet to a blackbody spectrum, andto spectra from both solar abundance and carbon-rich (c/o=1) models. ablackbody spectrum is an acceptable fit to the full dataset. extra continuousopacity due to clouds or haze, and flattened temperature profiles, are strongcandidates to produce quasi-blackbody spectra, and to account for the amplitudeof the optical eclipses. our results show ambiguous evidence for a temperatureinversion in this planet.

1403.1266	atmospheric characterization of 5 hot jupiters with wide field camera 3  on the hubble space telescope	we probe the structure and composition of the atmospheres of 5 hot jupiterexoplanets using the hubble space telescope wide field camera 3 (wfc3)instrument. we use the g141 grism (1.1-1.7 $\mu$m) to study tres-2b, tres-4b,and corot-1b in transit, tres-3b in secondary eclipse, and wasp-4b in both.this wavelength region includes a predicted absorption feature from water at1.4 $\mu$m, which we expect to be nondegenerate with the other molecules thatare likely to be abundant for hydrocarbon-poor (e.g. solar composition) hotjupiter atmospheres. we divide our wavelength regions into 10 bins. for eachbin we produce a spectrophotometric light curve spanning the time of transitand/or eclipse. we correct these light curves for instrumental systematicswithout reference to an instrument model. for our transmission spectra, ourmean $1-\sigma$ precision per bin corresponds to variations of 2.1, 2.8, and3.0 atmospheric scale heights for tres-2b, tres-4b, and corot-1b, respectively.we find featureless spectra for these three planets. we are unable to extract arobust transmission spectrum for wasp-4b. for our dayside emission spectra, ourmean $1-\sigma$ precision per bin corresponds to a planet-to-star flux ratio of$1.5\times10^{-4}$ and $2.1\times10^{-4}$ for wasp-4b and tres-3b,respectively. we combine these estimates with previous broadband measurementsand conclude that for both planets isothermal atmospheres are disfavored. wefind no signs of features due to water. we confirm that wfc3 is suitable forstudies of transiting exoplanets, but in staring mode multi-visit campaigns arenecessary to place strong constraints on water abundance.

1405.5923	the 4.5 $\mu$m full-orbit phase curve of the hot jupiter hd 209458b	the hot jupiter hd 209458b is particularly amenable to detailed study as itis among the brightest transiting exoplanet systems currently known (v-mag =7.65; k-mag = 6.308) and has a large planet-to-star contrast ratio. hd 209458bis predicted to be in synchronous rotation about its host star with a hot spotthat is shifted eastward of the substellar point by superrotating equatorialwinds. here we present the first full-orbit observations of hd 209458b, inwhich its 4.5 $\mu$m emission was recorded with $spitzer$/irac. our studyrevises the previous 4.5 $\mu$m measurement of hd 209458b's secondary eclipseemission downward by $\sim$35% to $0.1391%^{+0.0072%}_{-0.0069%}$, changing ourinterpretation of the properties of its dayside atmosphere. we find that thehot spot on the planet's dayside is shifted eastward of the substellar point by$40.9^{\circ}\pm{6.0^{\circ}}$, in agreement with circulation models predictingequatorial superrotation. hd 209458b's dayside (t$_{bright}$ = 1499 $\pm$ 15 k)and nightside (t$_{bright}$ = 972 $\pm$ 44 k) emission indicates a day-to-nightbrightness temperature contrast smaller than that observed for more highlyirradiated exoplanets, suggesting that the day-to-night temperature contrastmay be partially a function of the incident stellar radiation. the observedphase curve shape deviates modestly from global circulation model predictionspotentially due to disequilibrium chemistry or deficiencies in the current hotch$_{4}$ line lists used in these models. observations of the phase curve atadditional wavelengths are needed in order to determine the possible presenceand spatial extent of a dayside temperature inversion, as well as to improveour overall understanding of this planet's atmospheric circulation.

1407.1313	constraints on the atmospheric circulation and variability of the  eccentric hot jupiter xo-3b	we report secondary eclipse photometry of the hot jupiter xo-3b in the4.5~$\mu$m band taken with the infrared array camera (irac) on the spitzerspace telescope. we measure individual eclipse depths and center of eclipsetimes for a total of twelve secondary eclipses. we fit these datasimultaneously with two transits observed in the same band in order to obtain aglobal best-fit secondary eclipse depth of $0.1580\pm 0.0036\%$ and a center ofeclipse phase of $0.67004\pm 0.00013 $. we assess the relative magnitude ofvariations in the dayside brightness of the planet by measuring the size of theresiduals during ingress and egress from fitting the combined eclipse lightcurve with a uniform disk model and place an upper limit of 0.05$\%$. the newsecondary eclipse observations extend the total baseline from one and a halfyears to nearly three years, allowing us to place an upper limit on theperiastron precession rate of $2.9\times 10^{-3}$ degrees/day the tightestconstraint to date on the periastron precession rate of a hot jupiter. we usethe new transit observations to calculate improved estimates for the systemproperties, including an updated orbital ephemeris. we also use the largenumber of secondary eclipses to obtain the most stringent limits to date on theorbit-to-orbit variability of an eccentric hot jupiter and demonstrate theconsistency of multiple-epoch spitzer observations.

1407.6054	h2o abundances in the atmospheres of three hot jupiters	the core accretion theory for giant planet formation predicts enrichment ofelemental abundances in planetary envelopes caused by runaway accretion ofplanetesimals, which is consistent with measured super-solar abundances of c,n, p, s, xe, and ar in jupiter's atmosphere. however, the abundance of o whichis expected to be the most dominant constituent of planetesimals is unknown forsolar system giant planets, owing to the condensation of water in theirultra-cold atmospheres, thereby posing a key unknown in solar system formation.on the other hand, hundreds of extrasolar hot jupiters are known with very hightemperatures (&gt;~1000 k) making them excellent targets to measure h2o abundancesand, hence, oxygen in their atmospheres. we constrain the atmospheric h2oabundances in three hot jupiters (hd 189733b, hd 209458b, and wasp-12b),spanning a wide temperature range (1200-2500 k), using their near-infraredtransmission spectra obtained using the hst wfc3 instrument. we reportconclusive measurements of h2o in hd 189733b and hd 209458b, while that inwasp-12b is not well constrained by present data. the data allow nearly solaras well as significantly sub-solar abundances in hd 189733b and wasp-12b.however, for hd 209458b, we report the most precise h2o measurement in anexoplanet to date that suggests a ~20-135 sub-solar h2o abundance. we discussthe implications of our results on the formation conditions of hot jupiters andon the likelihood of clouds in their atmospheres. our results highlight thecritical importance of high-precision spectra of hot jupiters for derivingtheir h2o abundances.

1408.6234	statistical eclipses of close-in kepler sub-saturns	we present a method to detect small atmospheric signals in kepler's planetcandidate light curves by averaging light curves for multiple candidates withsimilar orbital and physical characteristics. our statistical method allows usto measure unbiased physical properties of kepler's planet candidates, even forcandidates whose individual signal-to-noise precludes the detection of theirsecondary eclipse. we detect a secondary eclipse depth of 3.83 +1.10/-1.11 ppmfor a group of 31 sub-saturn (r &lt; 6 earth radii) planet candidates with thegreatest potential for a reflected light signature ((r_p/a)^2 &gt; 10 ppm).including kepler-10b in this group increases the depth to 5.08 +0.71/-0.72 ppm.for a control group with (r_p/a)^2 &lt; 1 ppm, we find a depth of 0.36 +/- 0.37ppm, consistent with no detection. we also analyze the light curve ofkepler-10b and find an eclipse depth of 7.08 +/- 1.06 ppm. if the eclipses aredue solely to reflected light, this corresponds to a geometric albedo of 0.22+/- 0.06 for our group of close-in sub-saturns, 0.37 +/- 0.05 if includingkepler-10b in the group, and 0.60 +/- 0.09 for kepler-10b alone. including athermal emission model does not change the geometric albedo appreciably,assuming the bond albedo is 2/3 the geometric albedo. our result for kepler-10bis consistent with previous works. our result for close-in sub-saturns showsthat kepler-10b is unusually reflective, but our analysis is consistent withthe results of demory (2014) for super-earths. our results also indicate thathot neptunes are typically more reflective than hot jupiters.

1409.4000	water vapor in the spectrum of the extrasolar planet hd 189733b: 2. the  eclipse	spectroscopic observations of exoplanets are crucial to infer the compositionand properties of their atmospheres. hd 189733b is one of the most extensivelystudied exoplanets and is a corner stone for hot jupiter models. in this paper,we report the day-side emission spectrum of hd 189733b in the wavelength range1.1 to 1.7 $\mu$m obtained with the hubble space telescope wide field camera 3in spatial scan mode. the quality of the data is such that even astraightforward analysis yields a high precision poisson noise limitedspectrum: the median 1-$\sigma$ uncertainty is 57 ppm per 0.02 $\mu$m bin. wealso build a white-light curve correcting for systematic effects and derive anabsolute eclipse depth of 96$\pm$39 ppm. the resulting spectrum shows marginalevidence for water vapor absorption, but can also be well explained by ablackbody spectrum. however, the combination of these wfc3 data with previousspitzer photometric observations is best explained by a day-side atmosphere ofhd 189733b with no thermal inversion and a nearly solar or sub-solar h$_2$oabundance in a cloud-free atmosphere. alternatively, this apparent sub-solarabundance may be the result of clouds or hazes which future studies need toinvestigate.

1409.8349	water vapour absorption in the clear atmosphere of an exo-neptune	transmission spectroscopy to date has detected atomic and molecularabsorption in jupiter-sized exoplanets, but intense efforts to measuremolecular absorption in the atmospheres of smaller (neptune-sized) planetsduring transits have revealed only featureless spectra. from this it wasconcluded that the majority of small, warm planets evolve to sustain high meanmolecular weights, opaque clouds, or scattering hazes in their atmospheres,obscuring our ability to observe the composition of these atmospheres. here wereport observations of the transmission spectrum of hat-p-11b (~4 earth radii)from the optical to the infrared. we detected water vapour absorption at 1.4micrometre wavelength. the amplitude of the water absorption (approximately 250parts-per- million) indicates that the planetary atmosphere is predominantlyclear down to ~1 mbar, and sufficiently hydrogen-rich to exhibit a large scaleheight. the spectrum is indicative of a planetary atmosphere with an upperlimit of ~700 times the abundance of heavy elements relative to solar. this isin good agreement with the core accretion theory of planet formation, in whichgas giant planets acquire their atmospheres by directly accreting hydrogen-richgas from the protoplanetary nebulae onto a large rocky or icy core.

1411.7404	spitzer secondary eclipses of the dense, modestly-irradiated, giant  exoplanet hat-p-20b using pixel-level decorrelation	hat-p-20b is a giant exoplanet that orbits a metal-rich star. the planetitself has a high total density, suggesting that it may also have a highmetallicity in its atmosphere. we analyze two eclipses of the planet in each ofthe 3.6- and 4.5 micron bands of warm spitzer. these data exhibit intra-pixeldetector sensitivity fluctuations that were resistant to traditionaldecorrelation methods. we have developed a simple, powerful, and radicallydifferent method to correct the intra-pixel effect for warm spitzer data, whichwe call pixel-level decorrelation (pld). pld corrects the intra-pixel effectvery effectively, but without explicitly using - or even measuring - thefluctuations in the apparent position of the stellar image. we illustrate andvalidate pld using synthetic and real data, and comparing the results toprevious analyses. pld can significantly reduce or eliminate red noise inspitzer secondary eclipse photometry, even for eclipses that have proven to beintractable using other methods. our successful pld analysis of four hat-p-20beclipses shows a best-fit blackbody temperature of 1134 +/-29k, indicatinginefficient longitudinal transfer of heat, but lacking evidence for strongmolecular absorption. we find sufficient evidence for variability in the 4.5micron band that the eclipses should be monitored at that wavelength byspitzer, and this planet should be a high priority for jwst spectroscopy. allfour eclipses occur about 35 minutes after orbital phase 0.5, indicating aslightly eccentric orbit. a joint fit of the eclipse and transit times withextant rv data yields e(cos{omega}) = 0.01352 (+0.00054, -0.00057), andestablishes the small eccentricity of the orbit to high statistical confidence.given the existence of a bound stellar companion, hat-p-20b is anotherexcellent candidate for orbital evolution via kozai migration or otherthree-body mechanism.

1503.03173	low false-positive rate of kepler candidates estimated from a  combination of spitzer and follow-up observations	(abridged) nasa's kepler mission has provided several thousand transitingplanet candidates, yet only a small subset have been confirmed as true planets.therefore, the most fundamental question about these candidates is the fractionof bona fide planets. estimating the rate of false positives of the overallkepler sample is necessary to derive the planet occurrence rate. we present theresults from two large observational campaigns that were conducted with thespitzer telescope during the the kepler mission. these observations arededicated to estimating the false positive rate (fpr) amongst the keplercandidates. we select a sub-sample of 51 candidates, spanning wide ranges instellar, orbital and planetary parameter space, and we observe their transitswith spitzer at 4.5 microns. we use these observations to measures thecandidate's transit depths and infrared magnitudes. a bandpass-dependent depthalerts us to the potential presence of a blending star that could be the sourceof the observed eclipse: a false-positive scenario. for most of the candidates(85%), the transit depths measured with kepler are consistent with the depthsmeasured with spitzer as expected for planetary objects, while we find that themost discrepant measurements are due to the presence of unresolved stars thatdilute the photometry. the spitzer constraints on their own yield fprs between5-40%, depending on the kois. by considering the population of the kepler fieldstars, and by combining follow-up observations (imaging) when available, wefind that the overall fpr of our sample is low. the measured upper limit on thefpr of our sample is 8.8% at a confidence level of 3 sigma. this observationalresult, which uses the achromatic property of planetary transit signals that isnot investigated by the kepler observations, provides an independent indicationthat kepler's false positive rate is low.

1505.03158	3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m phase curves of the highly-irradiated eccentric hot  jupiter wasp-14b	we present full-orbit phase curve observations of the eccentric ($e\sim0.08$) transiting hot jupiter wasp-14b obtained in the 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m bandsusing the \textit{spitzer space telescope}. we use two different methods forremoving the intrapixel sensitivity effect and compare their efficacy indecoupling the instrumental noise. our measured secondary eclipse depths of$0.1882\%\pm 0.0048\%$ and $0.2247\%\pm 0.0086\%$ at 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m,respectively, are both consistent with a blackbody temperature of $2402\pm 35$k. we place a $2\sigma$ upper limit on the nightside flux at 3.6 $\mu$m andfind it to be $9\%\pm 1\%$ of the dayside flux, corresponding to a brightnesstemperature of 1079 k. at 4.5 $\mu$m, the minimum planet flux is $30\%\pm 5\%$of the maximum flux, corresponding to a brightness temperature of $1380\pm 65$k. we compare our measured phase curves to the predictions of one-dimensionalradiative transfer and three-dimensional general circulation models. we findthat wasp-14b's measured dayside emission is consistent with a model atmospherewith equilibrium chemistry and a moderate temperature inversion. these samemodels tend to over-predict the nightside emission at 3.6 $\mu$m, whileunder-predicting the nightside emission at 4.5 $\mu$m. we propose that thisdiscrepancy might be explained by an enhanced global c/o ratio. in addition, wefind that the phase curves of wasp-14b ($7.8 m_{\mathrm{jup}}$) are consistentwith a much lower albedo than those of other jovian mass planets with thermalphase curve measurements, suggesting that it may be emitting detectable heatfrom the deep atmosphere or interior processes.

1508.00902	spitzer secondary eclipse observations of five cool gas giant planets  and empirical trends in cool planet emission spectra	in this work we present spitzer 3.6 and 4.5 micron secondary eclipseobservations of five new cool (&lt;1200 k) transiting gas giant planets:hat-p-19b, wasp-6b, wasp-10b, wasp-39b, and wasp-67b. we compare our measuredeclipse depths to the predictions of a suite of atmosphere models and toeclipse depths for planets with previously published observations in order toconstrain the temperature- and mass-dependent properties of gas giant planetatmospheres. we find that the dayside emission spectra of planets less massivethan jupiter require models with efficient circulation of energy to the nightside and/or increased albedos, while those with masses greater than that ofjupiter are consistently best-matched by models with inefficient circulationand low albedos. at these relatively low temperatures we expect the atmosphericmethane to co ratio to vary as a function of metallicity, and we therefore useour observations of these planets to constrain their atmospheric metallicities.we find that the most massive planets have dayside emission spectra that arebest-matched by solar metallicity atmosphere models, but we are not able toplace strong constraints on metallicities of the smaller planets in our sample.interestingly, we find that the ratio of the 3.6 and 4.5 micron brightnesstemperatures for these cool transiting planets is independent of planettemperature, and instead exhibits a tentative correlation with planet mass. ifthis trend can be confirmed, it would suggest that the shape of these planets'emission spectra depends primarily on their masses, consistent with thehypothesis that lower-mass planets are more likely to have metal-richatmospheres.

1511.06064	spectral eclipse timing	we utilize multi-dimensional simulations of varying equatorial jet strengthto predict wavelength dependent variations in the eclipse times of gas-giantplanets. a displaced hot-spot introduces an asymmetry in the secondary eclipselight curve that manifests itself as a measured offset in the timing of thecenter of eclipse. a multi-wavelength observation of secondary eclipse, oneprobing the timing of barycentric eclipse at short wavelengths and anotherprobing at longer wavelengths, will reveal the longitudinal displacement of thehot-spot and break the degeneracy between this effect and that associated withthe asymmetry due to an eccentric orbit. the effect of time offsets was firstexplored in the irac wavebands by williams et. al (2006). here we improve upontheir methodology, extend to a broad ranges of wavelengths, and demonstrate ourtechnique on a series of multi-dimensional radiative-hydrodynamical simulationsof hd 209458b with varying equatorial jet strength and hot-spot displacement.simulations with the largest hot-spot displacement result in timing offsets ofup to 100 seconds in the infrared. though we utilize a particular radiativehydrodynamical model to demonstrate this effect, the technique is modelindependent. this technique should allow a much larger survey of hot-spotdisplacements with jwst then currently accessible with time-intensive phasecurves, hopefully shedding light on the physical mechanisms associated withthermal energy advection in irradiated gas-giants.

1512.04341	a continuum from clear to cloudy hot-jupiter exoplanets without  primordial water depletion	thousands of transiting exoplanets have been discovered, but spectralanalysis of their atmospheres has so far been dominated by a small number ofexoplanets and data spanning relatively narrow wavelength ranges (such as 1.1to 1.7 {\mu}m). recent studies show that some hot-jupiter exoplanets have muchweaker water absorption features in their near-infrared spectra than predicted.the low amplitude of water signatures could be explained by very low waterabundances, which may be a sign that water was depleted in the protoplanetarydisk at the planet's formation location, but it is unclear whether this levelof depletion can actually occur. alternatively, these weak signals could be theresult of obscuration by clouds or hazes, as found in some optical spectra.here we report results from a comparative study of ten hot jupiters coveringthe wavelength range 0.3-5 micrometres, which allows us to resolve both theoptical scattering and infrared molecular absorption spectroscopically. ourresults reveal a diverse group of hot jupiters that exhibit a continuum fromclear to cloudy atmospheres. we find that the difference between the planetaryradius measured at optical and infrared wavelengths is an effective metric fordistinguishing different atmosphere types. the difference correlates with thespectral strength of water, so that strong water absorption lines are seen inclear-atmosphere planets and the weakest features are associated with cloudsand hazes. this result strongly suggests that primordial water depletion duringformation is unlikely and that clouds and hazes are the cause of weakerspectral signatures.

astro-ph;0007216	a sensitive search for methane in the infrared spectrum of tau bootis	we have searched for a methane signature in the infrared spectrum of taubootis, produced by the planetary companion. the observations comprise 598low-noise, high resolution spectra near 3.28 microns, which we analyze bycross-correlating with a modeled planetary spectrum based on the work ofburrows and sharp (1999), and sudarsky et al. (2000). the 3-sigma random noiselevel of our analysis is 0.00006 stellar continuum flux units, and theconfusion noise limit - measuring the resemblence of a cross-correlationfeature to the spectrum of methane - is 0.00025.  we find a significant cross-correlation amplitude of 0.00033 continuum unitsat a velocity near that of the star. this is likely due to methane from alow-mass companion in a long-period orbit. fischer, butler and marcy (2000)report a long-term velocity drift indicative of such a companion. but thesystem is known to be a visual binary with an eccentric orbit, and is rapidlyapproaching periastron. whether the visual companion can account for ourobservations and the fischer et al. velocity drift depends on knowing the orbitmore precisely. the stability of planetary orbits in this system also dependscrucially on the properties of the binary orbit. a second cross-correlationfeature, weaker and much more diffuse, has intensity amplitude 0.0002 continuumunits and occurs at a velocity amplitude of 71 +/-10 km/sec, in agreement withthe orbit claimed for the planet by cameron et al.

astro-ph;0105035	models of the sl9 impacts i. ballistic monte-carlo plume	we model the comet shoemaker-levy 9 - jupiter impact plumes to calculatesynthetic plume views, atmospheric infall fluxes, and debris patterns. ourplume is a swarm of ballistic particles with one of several mass-velocitydistributions (mvd). the swarm is ejected instantaneously and uniformly into acone from its apex. upon falling to the ejection altitude, particles slide withhorizontal deceleration following one of several schemes. the model ignoreshydrodynamic and coriolis effects. we adjust plume tilt, opening angle, andminimum velocity, and choose mvd and sliding schemes, to create impact patternsthat match observations. our best match uses the power-law mvd from thenumerical impact model of zahnle and mac low, with velocity cutoffs at 4.5 and11.8 km/sec, cone opening angle of 75 degrees, cone tilt of 30 degrees fromvertical, and a sliding constant deceleration of 1.74 m/sec^2. amathematically-derived feature of zahnle and mac low's published cumulative mvdis a thin shell of mass at the maximum velocity, corresponding to the formeratmospheric shock front. this vanguard contains 22% of the mass and 45% of theenergy of the plume, and accounts for several previously-unexplainedobservations, including the large, expanding ring seen at 3.2 microns bymcgregor et al. and the ``third precursors'' and ``flare'' seen near 300 and1000 sec, respectively, in the infrared lightcurves. we present synthetic viewsof the plumes in flight and after landing and derive infall fluxes of mass,energy, and vertical momentum as a function of time and position on thesurface. these fluxes initialize a radiative-hydrodynamic atmosphere model(paper ii of this series) that calculates the thermal and dynamical response ofthe atmosphere and produces synthetic lightcurves.

astro-ph;0105039	models of the sl9 impacts ii. radiative-hydrodynamic modeling of the  plume splashback	we model the plume "splashback" phase of the sl9 collisions with jupiterusing the zeus-3d hydrodynamic code. we modified the zeus code to include grayradiative transport, and we present validation tests. we couple the infallingmass and momentum fluxes of sl9 plume material (from paper i) to a jovianatmospheric model. a strong and complex shock structure results. the modeledshock temperatures agree well with observations, and the structure andevolution of the modeled shocks account for the appearance of high excitationmolecular line emission after the peak of the continuum light curve. thesplashback region cools by radial expansion as well as by radiation. themorphology of our synthetic continuum light curves agree with observations overa broad wavelength range (0.9 to 12 microns). a feature of our ballistic plumeis a shell of mass at the highest velocities, which we term the "vanguard".portions of the vanguard ejected on shallow trajectories produce a lateralshock front, whose initial expansion accounts for the "third precursors" seenin the 2-micron light curves of the larger impacts, and for hot methaneemission at early times. continued propagation of this lateral shockapproximately reproduces the radii, propagation speed, and centroid positionsof the large rings observed at 3-4 microns by mcgregor et al. the portion ofthe vanguard ejected closer to the vertical falls back with high z-componentvelocities just after maximum light, producing co emission and the "flare" seenat 0.9 microns. the model also produces secondary maxima ("bounces") whoseamplitudes and periods are in agreement with observations.

astro-ph;0112116	solar magnetic field studies using the 12-micron emission lines. iv.  observations of a delta-region solar flare	we have recently developed the capability to make solar vector (stokes iquv)magnetograms using the infrared line of mgi at 12.32 microns. on 24 april 2001,we obtained a vector magnetic map of solar active region noaa 9433,fortuitously just prior to the occurrence of an m2 flare. examination of asequence of soho/mdi magnetograms, and comparison with ground-based h-alphaimages, shows that the flare was produced by the cancellation of newly emergentmagnetic flux outside of the main sunspot. the very high zeeman-sensitivity ofthe 12-micron data allowed us to measure field strengths on a spatial scalewhich was not directly resolvable. at the flare trigger site, opposite polarityfields of 2700 and 1000 gauss occurred within a single 2 arc-sec resolutionelement, as revealed by two resolved zeeman splittings in a single spectrum.our results imply an extremely high horizontal field strength gradient (5 g/km)prior to the flare, significantly greater than seen in previous studies. wealso find that the magnetic energy of the cancelling fields was more thansufficient to account for the flare's x-ray luminosity.

astro-ph;0309361	detection of close-in extrasolar giant planets using the fourier-kelvin  stellar interferometer	we evaluate the direct detection of extrasolar giant planets with atwo-aperture nulling infrared interferometer, working at angles${\theta}&lt;{\lambda}/2b$, and using a new `ratio-of-two-wavelengths' technique.simple arguments suggest that interferometric detection and characterizationshould be quite possible for planets much closer than the conventional innerworking angle, or angular resolution limit. we show that the peak signal from anulling infrared interferometer of baseline ($\lesssim 40$ meters) will oftenoccur `inside the null', and that the signal variations from path-differencefluctuations will cancel to first order in the ratio of two wavelengths. usinga new interferometer simulation code, we evaluate the detectability of all theknown extrasolar planets as observed using this two-color method with theproposed {\it fourier kelvin stellar interferometer (fksi)}. in its minimumconfiguration {\it fksi} uses two 0.5-meter apertures on a 12.5-meter baseline,and a $\pm 20^{\circ}$ field-of-regard. we predict that $\sim 7$ knownextrasolar planets are directly detectable using {\it fksi}, withlow-resolution spectroscopy ($r \sim 20$) being possible in the most favorablecases. spaceborne direct detection of extrasolar giant planets is possible with$\sim 12$ meter baselines, and does not require the much longer baselinesprovided by formation flying.

astro-ph;0311608	spectroscopy of molecular hydrogen emission from kh 15d	we report infrared spectroscopy of the unusual eclipsing pre-main sequenceobject kh 15d, obtained using nirspec on keck ii. during eclipse, observationsusing low spectral resolution (1000) reveal the presence of prominent molecularhydrogen emission in 5 lines near 2 microns. the relative line strengths areconsistent with thermal excitation at t = 2800 +/-300k. observations out ofeclipse, at both low and high spectral resolution (20,000), show reducedcontrast with the stellar continuum. the change in contrast for the strongestline, 1-0 s(1), is consistent with an approximately constant emission linesuperposed on a variable stellar continuum. emission in the 1-0 s(1) line isobserved to extend by more than 4 arc-sec both east and west of the stellarpoint spread function (more than 3000 au). observed at high spectralresolution, the velocity and intensity structure of the 1-0 s(1) profile areboth asymmetric. east of the stellar psf (by 1.1 - 2.3 arc-sec) the emission isblueshifted (-63 km/sec), and has significantly greater intensity than themarginally redshifted component (+2 km/sec, consistent with zero) whichdominates west of the stellar psf. the spatial extent of the emission, and theexcitation temperature, suggest shock-excitation of ambient gas by a bipolaroutflow from the star and/or disk. however, it is difficult to account for theobserved radial velocity unless the outflow axis is inclined significantly tothe plane of the sky.

astro-ph;0412436	a new search for carbon monoxide absorption in the transmission spectrum  of the extrasolar planet hd 209458b	we have revisited the search for carbon monoxide absorption features intransmission during the transit of the extrasolar planet hd 209458b. weacquired 1077 high resolution spectra at 2 microns using nirspec on keck iiduring three transits. our sensitivity is sufficient to test the degree of coabsorption in the first overtone bands during transit, based on plausiblemodels of the planetary atmosphere. we compare to theoretical tangent geometryabsorption spectra, computed by adding height-invariant ad hoc temperaturepertubations to the model atmosphere of sudarsky et al., and by treating cloudheight as an adjustable parameter. we do not detect co absorption. our analysisindicates a weakening similar to the case of sodium, suggesting that a generalmasking mechanism is at work in the planetary atmosphere. if this masking isprovided by high clouds, our analysis defines the maximum cloud top pressure(i.e., minimum height) as a function of the model atmospheric temperature. forthe relatively hot model used by charbonneau et al. to interpret their sodiumdetection, our co limit requires cloud tops at or above 3.3 mbar, and theseclouds must be opaque at a wavelength of 2 microns. high clouds comprised ofsubmicron-sized particles are already present in some models, but may notprovide sufficient opacity to account for our co result. cooler modelatmospheres, having smaller atmospheric scale heights and lower co mixingratios, may alleviate this problem to some extent. however, even models 500kcooler that the sudarsky et al. model require clouds above the 100 mbar levelto be consistent with our observations. our null result therefore requires thatclouds exist at an observable level in the atmosphere of hd 209458b, unlessthis planet is dramatically colder than current belief.

astro-ph;0503554	infrared radiation from an extrasolar planet	a class of extrasolar giant planets - the so-called `hot jupiters' - orbitwithin 0.05 au of their primary stars. these planets should be hot and so emitdetectable infrared radiation. the planet hd 209458b is an ideal candidate forthe detection and characterization of this infrared light because it iseclipsed by the star. this planet has an anomalously large radius (1.35 timesthat of jupiter), which may be the result of ongoing tidal dissipation, butthis explanation requires a non-zero orbital eccentricity (~0.03), maintainedby interaction with a hypothetical second planet. here we report detection ofinfrared (24 micron) radiation from hd 209458b, by observing the decrement influx during secondary eclipse, when the planet passes behind the star. theplanet's 24 micron flux is 55 +/- 10 micro-jy (1 sigma), with a brightnesstemperature of 1130 +/- 150 kelvins, confirming the predicted heating bystellar irradiation. the secondary eclipse occurs at the midpoint betweentransits of the planet in front of the star (to within +/- 7 min, 1 sigma),which means that a dynamically significant orbital eccentricity is unlikely.

astro-ph;0602443	strong infrared emission from the extrasolar planet hd189733b	we report detection of strong infrared thermal emission from the nearby (d=19pc) transiting extrasolar planet hd189733b, by measuring the flux decrementduring its prominent secondary eclipse. a 6-hour photometric sequence usingspitzer's infrared spectrograph in peak-up imaging mode at 16-microns shows thesecondary eclipse depth to be 0.551 +/-0.030%, with accuracy limited byinstrumental baseline uncertainties, but with 32-sigma precision (0.017%) onthe detection. the 16-micron brightness temperature of this planet (1117+/-42k)is very similar to the spitzer detections of tres-1 and hd209458b, but theobserved planetary flux (660 micro-jy) is an order of magnitude greater. thislarge signal will allow a detailed characterization of this planet in theinfrared. our photometry has sufficient signal-to-noise (~400 per point) tomotivate a search for structure in the ingress/egress portions of the eclipsecurve, caused by putative thermal structure on the disk of the planet. we showthat by binning our 6-second sampling down to 6-minute resolution, we detectthe modulation in the intensity derivative during ingress/egress due to theoverall shape of the planet, but our sensitivity is not yet sufficient todistinguish between realistic models of the temperature distribution across theplanet's disk. we point out the potential for extending spitzer secondaryeclipse detections down to the regime of transiting hot neptunes, if suchsystems are discovered among nearby lower main sequence stars.

astro-ph;0604079	shoemaker-levy 9 impact modeling: i. high-resolution 3d bolides	we have run high-resolution, three-dimensional, hydrodynamic simulations ofthe impact of comet shoemaker-levy 9 into the atmosphere of jupiter. we findthat the energy deposition profile is largely similar to the previoustwo-dimensional calculations of mac low and zahnle (1994), though perhapssomewhat broader in the range of height over which the energy is deposited. aswith similar calculations for impacts into the venusian atmosphere, there isconsiderable sensitivity in the results to small changes in the initialconditions, indicating dynamical chaos. we calculated the median depth ofenergy deposition (the height z at which 50% of the bolide's energy has beenreleased) per run. the mean value among runs is approx 70 km below the 1-barlevel, for a 1-km diameter impactor of porous ice of density rho=0.6 g cm^{-3}.the standard deviation among these runs is 14 km. we find little evidence of atrend in these results with the resolution of the calculations (up to 57 cellsacross the impactor radius, or 8.8-m resolution), suggesting that resolutionsas low as 16 grid cells across the radius of the bolide may yield good resultsfor this particular quantity.

astro-ph;0609799	a re-appraisal of the habitability of planets around m dwarf stars	stable, hydrogen-burning, m dwarf stars comprise about 75% of all stars inthe galaxy. they are extremely long-lived and because they are much smaller inmass than the sun (between 0.5 and 0.08 msun), their temperature and stellarluminosity are low and peaked in the red. we have re-examined what is known atpresent about the potential for a terrestrial planet forming within, ormigrating into, the classic liquid-surface-water habitable zone close to an mdwarf star. observations of protoplanetary disks suggest that planet-buildingmaterials are common around m dwarfs, but n-body simulations differ in theirestimations of the likelihood of potentially-habitable, wet planets residingwithin their habitable zones, which are only ~ 1/5 to 1/50 of the width of thatfor a g star. particularly in light of the claimed detection of the planetswith masses as small as 5.5 and 7.5 mearth orbiting m stars, there seems noreason to exclude the possibility of terrestrial planets. tidally lockedsynchronous rotation within the narrow habitable zone doesn't necessarily leadto atmospheric collapse, and active stellar flaring may not be as much of anevolutionarily disadvantageous factor as has previously been supposed. weconclude that m dwarf stars may indeed be viable hosts for planets on which theorigin and evolution of life can occur. a number of planetary processes such ascessation of geothermal activity, or thermal and non-thermal atmospheric lossprocesses may limit the duration of planetary habitability to periods farshorter than the extreme lifetime of the m dwarf star. nevertheless, it makessense to include m dwarf stars in programs that seek to find habitable worldsand evidence of life.

0705.4288	a ground-based search for thermal emission from the exoplanet tres-1	eclipsing planetary systems give us an important window on extrasolar planetatmospheres. by measuring the depth of the secondary eclipse, when the planetmoves behind the star, we can estimate the strength of the thermal emissionfrom the day side of the planet. attaining a ground-based detection of one ofthese eclipses has proven to be a significant challenge, as time-dependentvariations in instrument throughput and atmospheric seeing and absorptionoverwhelm the small signal of the eclipse at infrared wavelengths. we gathereda series of simultaneous l grism spectra of the transiting planet system tres-1and a nearby comparison star of comparable brightness, allowing us to correctfor these effects in principle. combining the data from two eclipses, wedemonstrate a detection sensitivity of 0.15% in the eclipse depth relative tothe stellar flux. this approaches the sensitivity required to detect theplanetary emission, which theoretical models predict should lie between0.05-0.1% of the stellar flux in our 2.9-4.3 micron bandpass. we explore thefactors that ultimately limit the precision of this technique, and discusspotential avenues for future improvements.

0706.1047	the dynamics-based approach to studying terrestrial exoplanets	one of the great quests of astronomy is to obtain the spectrum of aterrestrial planet orbiting within the habitable zone of its star, and thedominant challenge in doing so is to isolate the light of the planet from thatof the star. dynamics-based methods separate these signals temporally, whereasimaging techniques do so spatially. in light of the overwhelming dominance ofdynamics-based methods over the past decade, we challenge the notion thatspectra of terrestrial planets necessarily require extreme imaging methods. weadvocate that some resources be committed to refining the proven technologiesof radial-velocity measurements, transit photometry, and occultationspectroscopy (i.e. emergent infrared spectra obtained at secondary eclipse). wesee a particularly attractive opportunity in m-dwarfs, for which the habitablezone is close to the star, increasing the probability and frequency oftransits, and the amplitude of the induced radial-velocity variation. suchplanets could be discovered by a dedicated ground-based transit survey of the10,000 nearest m-dwarfs. the favorable planet-star contrast ratio would makethese planets ideal targets for the study of their atmospheres with thetechnique of occultation spectroscopy.
