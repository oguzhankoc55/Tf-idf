0706.3780	the magellanic squall: gas replenishment from the small to large  magellanic cloud	we first show that a large amount of metal-poor gas is stripped from thesmall magellanic cloud (smc) and fallen into the large magellanic cloud (lmc)during the tidal interaction between the smc, the lmc, and the galaxy over thelast 2 gyrs. we propose that this metal-poor gas can closely be associated withthe origin of lmc's young and intermediate-age stars and star clusters withdistinctively low-metallicities with [fe/h] &lt; -0.6. we numerically investigatewhether gas initially in the outer part of the smc's gas disk can be strippedduring the lmc-smc-galaxy interaction and consequently can pass through thecentral region (r&lt;7.5 kpc) of the lmc. we find that about 0.7 % and 18 % of thesmc's gas can pass through the central region of the lmc about 1.3 gyr ago and0.2 gyr ago, respectively. the possible mean metallicity of the replenished gasfrom the smc to lmc is about [fe/h] = -0.9 to -1.0 for the two interactingphases. these results imply that the lmc can temporarily replenish gas suppliesthrough the sporadic accretion and infall of metal-poor gas from the smc. thesefurthermore imply that if these gas from the smc can collide with gas in thelmc to form new stars in the lmc, the metallicities of the stars can besignificantly lower than those of stars formed from gas initially within thelmc.

0906.3545	chemical signature of a major merger in the early formation of small  magellanic cloud	the formation history of the small magellanic cloud (smc) is unraveled basedon the results of our new chemical evolution models constructed for the smc,highlighting the observed anomaly in the age-metallicity relation for starclusters in the smc. we first propose that evidence of a major merger isimprinted in the age-metallicity relation as a dip in [fe/h]. our modelspredict that the major merger with a mass ratio of 1:1 to 1:4 occurred at ~7.5gyr ago, with a good reproduction of the abundance distribution function offield stars in the smc. furthermore, our models predict a relatively largescatter in [mg/fe] for -1.4 &lt; [fe/h] &lt;-1.1 as a reflection of a looping featureresulting from the temporally inverse progress of chemical enrichment, whichcan be tested against future observational results. given that the observedvelocity dispersion (~30 km/s) of the smc is much smaller than that (~160 km/s)of the galactic halo, our finding strongly implies that the predicted mergerevent happened in a small group environment that was far from the galaxy andcontained a number of small gas-rich dwarfs comparable to the smc. thistheoretical view is extensively discussed in the framework that considers aconnection with the formation history of the large magellanic cloud.

0906.5117	dark impact and galactic star formation: origin of the gould belt	the milky way has a giant stellar structure in the solar neighborhood, whichhas a size of $\sim 1$ kpc, a mass of $\sim 10^6 {\rm m}_{\odot}$, and aring-like distribution of young stars. fundamental physical properties of thislocal enigmatic structure, known as the gould belt (gb), have not beenreproduced by previously proposed models. we first show that the localenigmatic structure can be formed about 30 myr ago as a result of a high-speed,oblique collision between a gas cloud with a mass of $\sim 10^6 {\rmm}_{\odot}$ and a dark matter clump with a mass of $\sim 10^7 {\rm m}_{\odot}$based on numerical simulations of the collision. we find that strong dynamicalimpact of the clump transforms the flattened cloud into a ring-like stellarstructure after induced star formation within the cloud. our simulationsfurthermore demonstrate that the stellar structure is moderately elongated andsignificantly inclined with respect to the disk of the milky way owing to thestrong tidal torque by the colliding clump. we thus suggest that the gb is oneof stellar substructures formed from collisions between gas clouds and darkmatter clumps predicted in the hierarchical clustering scenario of galaxyformation. we also suggest that collisions of dark matter clumps with theirhost galaxies can significantly change star formation histories for some oftheir gas clouds thus influence galactic global star formation histories tosome extent.

0907.4409	ram pressure stripping of halo gas in disk galaxies: implications on  galactic star formation in different environments	we numerically investigate evolution of gaseous halos around disk galaxies indifferent environments ranging from small groups to rich clusters in order tounderstand galaxy evolution in these environments. our simulationsself-consistently incorporate effects of ram pressure of intergalactic medium(igm) on disk and halo gas of galaxies and hydrodynamical interaction betweendisk and halo gas so that mass fractions of halos gas stripped by ram pressureof igm (f_strip) can be better estimated. we mainly investigate how f_stripdepends on total masses of their host environments (m_host}), galactic masses(m_gal), densities and temperature of igm (t_igm and rho_igm, respectively),relative velocities between igm and galaxies (v_r), and physical properties ofdisks (e.g., gas mass fraction). we find that typically 60-80% of halo gas canbe efficiently stripped from milky way-type disk galaxies by ram pressure inclusters with m_host 10^{14} m_sun we also find that f_strip depends on m_hostsuch that f_strip is higher for larger m_host. furthermore it is found thatf_strip can be higher in disk galaxies with smaller m_gal for a givenenvironment. our simulations demonstrate that the presence of disk gas cansuppress ram pressure stripping of halo gas owing to hydrodynamical interactionbetween halo and disk gas. ram pressure stripping of halo gas is found to beefficient (i.e., f_strip&gt;0.5) even in small and/or compact groups, if rho_igm ~10^5 m_sun/kpc^3 and v_r ~ 400 km/s. based on the derived radial distributionsof remaining halo gas after ram pressure stripping, we propose that truncationof star formation after halo gas stripping can occur outside-in in diskgalaxies.

0707.2188	on the origin of the kinematical differences between the stellar halo  and the old globular cluster system in the large magellanic cloud	we discuss structural and kinematical properties of the stellar halo and theold globular cluster system (gcs) in the large magellanic cloud (lmc) based onnumerical simulations of the lmc formation. we particularly discuss theobserved possible gcs's rotational kinematics (v/sigma &gt; 2) that appears to besignificantly different from the stellar halo's one with a large velocitydispersion (~50 km/s). we consider that both halo field stars and old gcs canoriginate from low-mass subhalos virialized at high redshifts (z &gt;6). weinvestigate the final dynamical properties of the two old components in thelmc's halo formed from merging of low-mass subhalos with field stars and gcs.we find that the gcs composed of old globular clusters (gcs) formed at highredshifts (z &gt; 6) has little rotation (v/sigma ~0.4) and structure andkinematics similar to those of the stellar halo. this inconsistency between thesimulated gcs's kinematics and the observed one is found to be seen in modelswith different parameters. this inconsistency therefore implies that if old,metal-poor gcs in the lmc have rotational kinematics, they are highly unlikelyto originate from the low-mass subhalos that formed the stellar halo. we thusdiscuss a scenario in which the stellar halo was formed from low-mass subhaloswith no/few gcs whereas the gcs was formed at the very early epoch of the lmc'sdisk formation via dissipative minor and major merging of gas-rich subhalos andgas infall. we suggest that there can be a threshold subhalo mass above whichgcs can be formed within subhalos at high redshifts and thus that thisthreshold causes differences in physical properties between stellar halos andgcss in less luminous galaxies like the lmc.

0707.2566	the environments and clustering properties of 2dfgrs-selected starburst  galaxies	we investigate the environments and clustering properties of starburstgalaxies selected from the 2df galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) in order todetermine which, if any, environmental factors play a role in triggering astarburst. we quantify the local environments, clustering properties andluminosity functions of our starburst galaxies and compare to random controlsamples. the starburst galaxies are also classified morphologically in terms oftheir broad hubble type and evidence of tidal merger/interaction signatures. wefind the starburst galaxies to be much less clustered on large (5-15 mpc)scales compared to the overall 2dfgrs galaxy population. in terms of theirenvironments, we find just over half of the starburst galaxies to reside in lowto intermediate luminosity groups, and a further ~30 per cent residing in theoutskirts and infall regions of rich clusters. their luminosity functions alsodiffer significantly from that of the overall 2dfgrs galaxy population, withthe sense of the difference being critically dependent on the way their starformation rates are measured. in terms of pin-pointing what might trigger thestarburst, it would appear that factors relating to their local environment aremost germane. specifically, we find clear evidence that the presence of a nearneighbour of comparable luminosity/mass within 20 kpc is likely to be importantin triggering a starburst. we also find that a significant fraction (20-30 percent) of our starburst galaxies have morphologies indicative of either anongoing or recent tidal interaction and/or merger. these findingsnotwithstanding, there remain a significant portion of starburst galaxies wherelocal environmental influences are not in any obvious way playing a triggeringrole, leading us to conclude that starbursts can also be internally driven.

0911.5461	dynamical friction of star clusters against disk field stars in  galaxies: implications on stellar nucleus formation and globular cluster  luminosity functions	we numerically investigate orbital evolution of star clusters (scs) under theinfluence of dynamical friction by field stars of their host disk galaxiesembedded in dark matter halos. we find that scs with masses larger than 2 *10^5 m_sun can show significant orbital decay within less than 1 gyr due todynamical friction by disk field stars in galaxies with disk masses m_d lessthan 10^9 m_sun. we also find that orbital decay of scs due to dynamicalfriction is more remarkable in disk galaxies with smaller m_d and highermass-ratios of disks to dark matter halos. the half-number radii r_h, sc andmean masses within r_h,sc of the sc systems (scss) in low-mass disk galaxieswith m_d &lt; 10^9 m_sun are found to evolve significantly with time owing todynamical friction of scs. more massive scs that can spiral-in to the centralregions of disks can form multiple sc systems with smaller velocity dispersionsso that they can merge with one another to form single stellar nuclei withtheir masses comparable to ~0.4% of their host disk masses. based on theseresults, we suggest that luminosity functions (lfs) for more massive globularclusters (gcs) with masses larger than 2 * 10^5 m_sun can steepen owing totransformation of the more massive gcs into single stellar nuclei through gcmerging in less luminous galaxies. we also suggest that the half-number radiiof gc systems can evolve owing to dynamical friction only for galaxies withtheir total masses smaller than ~ 10^{10} m_sun.

0912.2476	origin of rotational kinematics in the globular cluster system of m31: a  new clue to the bulge formation	we propose that the rotational kinematics of the globular cluster system(gcs) in m31 can result from a past major merger event that could have formedits bulge component. we numerically investigate kinematical properties ofglobular clusters (gcs) in remnants of galaxy mergers between two disks withgcs in both their disk and halo components. we find that the gcs formed duringmajor merging can show strongly rotational kinematics with the maximumrotational velocities of 140 - 170 km/s for a certain range of orbitalparameters of merging. we also find that a rotating stellar bar, which can bemorphologically identified as a boxy bulge if seen edge-on, can be formed inmodels for which the gcss show strongly rotational kinematics. we thus suggestthat the observed rotational kinematics of gcs with different metallicities inm31 can be closely associated with the ancient major merger event. we discusswhether the formation of the rotating bulge/bar in m31 can be due to theancient merger.

0707.4563	origin of lower velocity dispersions of ultra-compact dwarf galaxy  populations in clusters of galaxies	recent observations have revealed that velocity dispersions of``ultra-compact dwarf'' (ucd) galaxies are significantly smaller than those ofother galaxy populations in the fornax and the virgo clusters of galaxies. inorder to understand the origin of the observed lower velocity dispersions ofucds, we numerically investigate line-of-sight velocity dispersion (sigma_los)of galaxy populations with variously different orbits in clusters of galaxieswith the total masses of m_cl. we particularly investigate radial velocitydispersion profiles (sigma_los(r)) and velocity dispersions within the central200 kpc of a cluster model (sigma_m) for galaxies with different pericenterdistances (r_p) and orbital eccentricities (e) in the model with m_cl = 7.0 x10^13 m_sun reasonable for the fornax cluster. we find that sigma_los(r) andsigma_m of galaxies with smaller r_p are steeper and smaller, respectively, fora given initial e distribution of galaxies. for example, we find that sigma_mis ~ 260 km/s for galaxies with r_p &lt;50 kpc and ~ 336 km/s for all galaxies inthe model with the mean e of 0.6. these results imply that the observed lowervelocity dispersion of ucd population is consistent with the ucds havingsignificantly smaller r_p than other galaxy populations in the fornax. wediscuss these results in the context of the ``galaxy threshing'' scenario inwhich ucds originate from nuclei of nucleated dwarf galaxies. we suggest thatthe observed differences in kinematical properties between ucds and other dwarfgalaxy populations in clusters of galaxies can be understood in terms of thedifferences in orbital properties between ucds and the dwarf populations.

1004.3627	on the transition from nuclear-cluster to black-hole dominated galaxy  cores	giant elliptical galaxies, believed to be built from the merger of lessergalaxies, are known to house a massive black hole at their center rather than acompact star cluster. if low- and intermediate-mass galaxies do indeed partakein the hierarchical merger scenario, then one needs to explain why their densenuclear star clusters are not preserved in merger events. a valuable clue maythe recent revelation that nuclear star clusters and massive black holesfrequently co-exist in intermediate mass bulges and elliptical galaxies. in aneffort to understand the physical mechanism responsible for the disappearanceof nuclear star clusters, we have numerically investigated the evolution ofmerging star clusters with seed black holes. using black holes that are 1-5% oftheir host nuclear cluster mass, we reveal how their binary coalescence duringa merger dynamically heats the newly wed star cluster, expanding it,significantly lowering its central stellar density, and thus making itsusceptible to tidal destruction during galaxy merging. moreover, thismechanism provides a pathway to explain the observed reduction in thenucleus-to-galaxy stellar mass ratio as one proceeds from dwarf to giantelliptical galaxies.

1007.2532	origin of optically passive spiral galaxies with dusty star-forming  regions: outside-in truncation of star formation?	recent observations have revealed that red, optically--passive spiralgalaxies with little or no optical emission lines, harbour significant amountsof dust-obscured star formation. we propose that these observational resultscan be explained if the spatial distributions of the cold gas and star-formingregions in these spiral galaxies are significantly more compact than those inblue star-forming spirals. our numerical simulations show that if the sizes ofstar-forming regions in spiral galaxies with disk sizes of r_d are ~ 0.3r_d,such galaxies appear to have lower star formation rates as well as higherdegrees of dust extinction. this is mainly because star formation in thesespirals occurs only in the inner regions where both the gas densities andmetallicities are higher, and hence the dust extinction is also significantlyhigher. we discuss whether star formation occurring preferentially in the innerregions of spirals is closely associated with the stripping of halo and diskgas via some sort of environmental effect. we suggest that the "outside-intruncation of star formation" is the key to a better understanding ofapparently optically--passive spirals with dusty star-forming regions.

1008.1318	origin of the unusually low nitrogen abundances in young populations of  the large magellanic cloud	it is a longstanding problem that hii regions and very young stellarpopulations in the large magellanic cloud (lmc) have the nitrogen abundances  ([n/h]) by a factor of ~7 lower than the solar value. we here discuss a newscenario in which the observed unusually low nitrogen abundances can be closelyassociated with recent collision and subsequent accretion of hi high velocityclouds (hvcs) that surround the galaxy and have low nitrogen abundances. weshow that if the observed low [n/h] is limited to very young stars with agesless than ~10^7 yr, then the collision/accretion rate of the hvcs onto the lmcneeds to be ~ 0.2 m_sun/yr (corresponding to the total hvc mass of 10^6-10^7m_sun) to dilute the original interstellar medium (ism) before star formation.the required accretion rate means that even if the typical mass of hvcsaccreted onto the lmc is ~ 10^7 m_sun, the galaxy needs to have ~2500 massivehvcs within the lmc's orbital radius with respect to the galactic center. therequired rather large number of massive hvcs drives us to suggest that the hvcsare not likely to efficiently dilute the ism of the lmc and consequently lowerthe [n/h]. we thus suggest the transfer of gas with low [n/h] from the smallmagellanic cloud (smc) to the lmc as a promising scenario that can explain theobserved low [n/h].

1010.3841	rotation and multiple stellar population in globular clusters	we investigate structure and kinematics of the second generation of stars(sg) formed from gaseous ejecta of the first generation of stars (fg) informing globular clusters (gcs). we consider that sg can be formed from gaseousejecta from agb stars of fg with the initial total mass of 10^6-10^8 m_sun toexplain the present masses of the galactic gcs. our 3d hydrodynamicalsimulations with star formation show that sg formed in the central regions offg can have a significant amount of rotation (v/sigma ~0.8-2.5). the rotationalamplitude of sg can depend strongly on the initial kinematics of fg. we thuspropose that some gcs composed of fg and sg had a significant amount ofrotation when they were formed. we also suggest that although later long-term(~10 gyr) dynamical evolution of stars can smooth out the initial structuraland kinematical differences between fg and sg to a large extent, initialflattened structures and rotational kinematics of sg can be imprinted on shapesand internal rotation of the present gcs. we discuss these results in terms ofinternal rotation observed in the galactic gcs.

1011.5956	secondary star formation within massive star clusters: origin of  multiple stellar populations in globular clusters	we numerically investigate whether and how gaseous ejecta from agb stars canbe converted into new stars within originally massive star clusters (mscs) inorder to understand the origin of multiple stellar populations in globularclusters (gcs). we adopt a scenario in which (i) mscs with masses of m_s can beformed from high-mass, high-density giant molecular clouds (gmcs) in their hostgalactic building blocks embedded in dark matter halos at high redshifts and(ii) their evolution therefore can be significantly influenced by m_s, theirinitial locations, and physical properties of their hosts. our 3dhydrodynamical simulations show that gaseous ejecta from agb stars can beretained within mscs and consequently converted into new stars very efficientlyin the central regions of mscs, only if m_s exceed a threshold mass (m_th) of~10^6 m_sun. the new stars can correspond to the ``second generation (sg)'' ofstars with higher na and lower o abundances observed in gcs. star formationefficiencies during the formation of sg stars within mscs with m_s &gt; m_th canbe rather high (0.3-0.9) so that very compact new clusters within original mscscan be formed. m_s should be as large as 10^6-10^7 m_sun to explain theobserved large fraction of sg stars in the present ordinary galactic gcs,because new stars can consist of only 1-4% among all stars for the standardimf. nuclear mscs are found to retain much more effectively the agb ejecta andconvert more efficiently the gas into new stars owing to much deepergravitational potential of their hosts. we suggest that both m_s and theirlocations within their hosts can determine whether abundance spread can be seenonly in light elements or even in heavy ones.

1101.2500	constraining the orbital history of the magellanic clouds: a new bound  scenario suggested by the tidal origin of the magellanic stream	bound orbits have traditionally been assigned to the large and smallmagellanic clouds (lmc and smc, respectively) in order to provide a formationscenario for the magellanic stream (ms) and its leading arm (la), two prominentneutral hydrogen (hi) features connected to the lmc and smc. however, hubblespace telescope (hst) measurements of the proper motions of the lmc and smchave challenged the plausibility of bound orbits, causing the origin of the msto re-emerge as a contested issue. we present a new tidal model in whichstructures resembling the bifurcated ms and elongated la are able to form in abound orbit consistent with the hst proper motions. the lmc and smc haveremained bound to each other only recently in our model despite beingseparately bound to the milky way for more than 5 gyr. we find that the ms andla are able to form as a consequence of lmc-dominated tidal stripping duringthe recent dynamical coupling of the lmc and smc. our orbital model depends onour assumption that the milky way has a constant circular velocity of v_cir=250km/s up to 160 kpc, which implies a massive isothermal halo that is notcompletely rejected by observations.

1102.1504	on interpretation of recent proper motion data for the large magellanic  cloud	recent observational studies using the hubble space telescope (hst) havederived the center-of-mass proper motion (cmpm) of the large magellanic cloud(lmc). although these studies carefully treated both rotation and perspectiveeffects in deriving the proper motion for each of the sampled fields, they didnot consider the effects of local random motion in the derivation. this meansthat the average pm of the fields (i.e., the observed cmpm) could significantlydeviate from the true cmpm, because the effect of local random motion can notbe close to zero in making the average pm for the small number of the fields(~10). we discuss how significantly the observationally derived cmpm candeviate from the true cmpm by applying the same method as used in theobservations for a dynamical model of the lmc with a known true cmpm. we findthat the deviation can be as large as ~ 50 km/s (~0.21 mas/yr), if the lmc hasa thick disk and a maximum circular velocity of ~120$ km/s. we also find thatthe deviation depends both on the total number of the sampled fields and onstructure and kinematics of the lmc. we therefore suggest that there is apossibility that the observed cmpm of the lmc deviates from the true one tosome extent. we also show that a simple mean of pm for a large number of thelmc fields (~1000) can be much closer to the true cmpm.

1105.0531	transformation from spirals into s0s with bulge growth in groups of  galaxies	recent observations have revealed that the time evolution of the s0 numberfraction at intermediate and high redshifts (0.2&lt;z&lt;0.8) is more dramatic ingroups of galaxies than in clusters. in order to understand the origin of s0sin groups, we investigate numerically the morphological transformation ofspirals into s0s through group-related physical processes. our chemodynamicalsimulations show that spirals in group environments can be strongly influencedby repetitive slow encounters with group member galaxies so that those withthin disks and prominent spiral arm structures can be transformed into s0s withthick disks and without prominent spiral arm structure. such tidal interactionscan also trigger repetitive starbursts within the bulges of spirals andconsequently increase significantly the masses of their bulges. owing to rapidconsumption of gas initially in spirals during the bulge growth, the s0s canbecome gas-poor. the s0s transformed from spirals in this way have young andmetal-rich stellar populations in the inner regions of their bulges. thesimulated s0s have lower maximum rotational velocities and flatter radialline-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles in comparison to their progenitorspirals. the formation processes of s0s due to tidal interactions depend notonly on the masses and orbits of the progenitor spirals, but also on groupmass. a significant fraction (10-30%) of stars and gas can be stripped duringthis spiral to s0 morphological transformation so that intragroup stars and gascan be formed. based on these results, we discuss structures, kinematics,chemical properties, and the tully-fisher relation of s0s in groups.

1105.5864	origin of chemical and dynamical properties of the galactic thick disk	we adopt a scenario in which the galactic thick disk was formed by minormerging between the first generation of the galactic thin disk (fgtd) and adwarf galaxy about 9 gyr ago and thereby investigate chemical and dynamicalproperties of the galactic thick disk. in this scenario, the dynamicalproperties of the thick disk have long been influenced both by the mass growthof the second generation of the galactic thin disk (i.e., the present thindisk) and by its non-axisymmetric structures. on the other hand, the early starformation history and chemical evolution of the thin disk was influenced by theremaining gas of the thick disk. based on n-body simulations and chemicalevolution models, we investigate the radial metallicity gradient, structuraland kinematical properties, and detailed chemical abundance patterns of thethick disk. our numerical simulations show that the ancient minor merger eventcan significantly flatten the original radial metallicity gradient of the fgtd,in particular, in the outer part, and also can be responsible for migration ofinner metal-rich stars into the outer part (r&gt;10kpc). the simulations show thatthe central region of the thick disk can develop a bar due to dynamical effectsof a separate bar in the thin disk. the simulated orbital eccentricitydistributions in the thick disk for models with higher mass-ratios (~0.2) andlower orbital eccentricities (~ 0.5) of minor mergers are in good agreementwith the corresponding observations. the simulated v_{phi}-|z| relation of thethick disk in models with low orbital inclination angles of mergers are also ingood agreement with the latest observational results. our galactic chemicalevolution models can explain both the observed metallicity distributionfunctions (mdfs) and correlations between [mg/fe] and [fe/h] for the two disksin a self-consistent manner.

1106.2379	when was the large magellanic cloud accreted onto the galaxy ?	using fully self-consistent n-body models for the dynamical evolution of thelarge magellanic cloud (lmc) in the galaxy, we show that if the lmc initiallyhas an extended old stellar halo before its commencement of tidal interactionwith the galaxy, physical properties of the stars stripped from the lmc stellarhalo can have fossil information as to when and where the lmc was accreted ontothe galaxy for the first time. if the epoch of the first lmc accretion onto thegalaxy from outside its viriral radius is more than ~4 gyr ago (i.e., at leasttwo pericenter passages), the stars stripped from the stellar halo of the lmccan form an irregular polar ring or a thick disk with a size of ~100 kpc androtational kinematics. on the other hand, if the lmc was first accreted ontothe galaxy quite recently (~ 2 gyr ago), the stripped stars form shorterleading and trailing stellar stream at r=50-120 kpc. also distributions of thestripped stars in phase space between the two cases can be significantlydifferent. the derived differences in structure and kinematics of the strippedstars therefore suggest that if we compare the observed three-dimensional (3d)distribution and kinematics of the outer galactic stellar halo along thepolar-axis, then we can give strong constraints on the past orbit of the lmc.we find that the orbital properties of the lmc in the successful formationmodels of the magellanic stream (ms) are consistent with those predicted fromrecent lambdacdm cosmological simulations. we conclude that the lmc wasaccreted onto the galaxy more than ~4 gyr ago so that interaction between thelmc, the small magellanic cloud (smc), and the galaxy could form the ms and itsleading arms (las).

1106.4363	formation of the galactic bulge from a two-component stellar disk:  explaining cylindrical rotation and vertical metallicity gradient	recent observational studies have revealed that the galactic bulge hascylindrical rotation and a steeper vertical metallicity gradient. we adopt tworepresentative models for the bulge formation and thereby investigate whetherthe two models can explain both the observed cylindrical rotation and verticalmetallicity gradient in a self-consistent manner. one is the "pure diskscenario" (pds) in which the bulge is formed from a pure thin stellar diskthrough spontaneous bar instability. the other is the "two-component diskscenario" (tcds) in which the bulge is formed from a disk composed of thin andthick disks through bar instability. our numerical simulations show thatalthough pds can reproduce the cylindrical rotation, it shows a rather flattervertical metallicity gradient that is inconsistent with observations. thederived flatter metallicity gradient is due to the vertical mixing of starswith different initial metallicities by the stellar bar. this result impliesthat the bulge can not be simply formed from a pure thin stellar disk. on theother hand, the bulge formed from the two-component disk in tcds can explainboth the observed cylindrical rotation and vertical metallicity gradient of thegalactic bulge reasonably well. in tcds, more metal-poor stars at higher |z|(vertical distance) which originate from the already dynamically hotter thickdisk can not be strongly influenced by vertical mixing of the bar so that theycan stay in situ for longer timescales and thus keep the lower metallicity athigher |z|. consequently, the vertical metallicity gradient of the bulgecomposed of initially thin and thick disk stars can not be so flattened, evenif the gradient of the thin disk can be flattened significantly by the bar intcds.

1109.4463	on the origin of the stellar halo and multiple stellar populations in  the globular cluster ngc 1851	we propose that the observed stellar halo around the globular cluster (gc)ngc 1851 is evidence for its formation in the central region of its defuncthost dwarf galaxy. we numerically investigate the long-term dynamical evolutionof a nucleated dwarf galaxy embedded in a massive dark matter halo under thestrong tidal field of the galaxy. the dwarf galaxy is assumed to have a stellarnucleus (or a nuclear star cluster) that could be the progenitor for ngc 1851.we find that although the dark matter halo and the stellar envelope of the hostdwarf of ngc 1851 can be almost completely stripped during its orbitalevolution around the galaxy, a minor fraction of stars in the dwarf can remaintrapped by the gravitational field of the nucleus. the stripped nucleus can beobserved as ngc 1851 with no/little dark matter whereas stars around thenucleus can be observed as a diffuse stellar halo around ngc 1851. thesimulated stellar halo has a symmetric distribution with a power-law densityslope of ~ -2 and shows no tidal tails within ~200pc from ngc 1851. we showthat two gcs can merge with each other to form a new nuclear gc embedded infield stars owing to the low stellar velocity dispersion of the host dwarf.this result makes no assumption on the ages and/or chemical abundances of thetwo merging gcs. thus the observed stellar halo and characteristic multiplestellar populations in ngc 1851 suggest that ngc 1851 could have formedinitially in the central region of an ancient dwarf galaxy.

1111.3371	stellar population gradients in the cores of nearby field e+a galaxies	we have selected a sample of local e+a galaxies from the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) data release 7 for follow up integral field spectroscopy with thewide field spectrograph (wifes) on the anu 2.3-m telescope. the sample wasselected using the halpha line in place of the [oii]3727 line as the indicatorof on-going star formation (or lack thereof). this allowed us to select a lowerredshift sample of galaxies than available in the literature since the[oii]3727 falls off the blue end of the wavelength coverage in the sdss for thevery lowest redshift objects. this low redshift selection means that thegalaxies have a large angular to physical scale which allows us to resolve thecentral ~1kpc region of the galaxies; the region where stellar populationgradients are expected. such observations have been difficult to make usingother higher redshift samples because even at redshifts z~0.1 the angular tophysical scale is similar to the resolution provided by ground based seeing.our integral field spectroscopy has enabled us to make the first robustdetections of balmer line gradients in the centres of e+a galaxies. six out ofour sample of seven, and all the galaxies with regular morphologies, areobserved to have compact and centrally-concentrated balmer line absorption.this is evidence for compact young cores and stellar population gradients whichare predicted from models of mergers and tidal interactions which funnel gasinto the galaxy core. given the generally isolated nature of our sample thisargues for the galaxies being seen in the late stage of a merger where theprogenitors have already coalesced.

1112.3710	formation of massive globular clusters with heavy element abundance  spread in the galactic building blocks	a growing number of recent observations have revealed that the galacticglobular cluster (gc) omega cen is not the only gc that shows abundance spreadin heavy elements (e.g., fe). in order to understand the origin of the galacticgcs with heavy element abundance spread ("heas"), we investigate the formationprocesses of massive gcs (mgcs) with masses larger than 10^6 m_sun in gas-richdwarf galaxies interacting and merging with the very young galaxy. we find thatmassive and compact stellar clumps with masses larger than 10^6 m_sun, whichcan be regarded as progenitors of mgcs, can form from massive gas clumps thatare developed through merging of gaseous regions initially at different regionsand thus with different metallicities. therefore it is inevitable that mgcsformed in dwarfs have heas. the abundance spread in each individual mgc dependson the radial metallicity gradient of the host dwarf such that it can be largerfor the steeper metallicity gradient. for example, mgcs formed in a dwarf witha central metallicity of [fe/h]=-1.1 and the radial gradient of -0.2 dexkpc^{-1} can have the abundance spread of delta [fe/h] ~.2. the simulated mgcsappear to be significantly flattened owing to their dissipative formation fromgas disks of their host dwarfs. based on these results, we discuss possiblydiverse formation mechanisms for the galactic gcs such as m22, m54, ngc 2419,omega cen, and terzan 5.

1112.5240	a possible physical connection between helium-rich stellar populations  of massive globular clusters and the uv upturn of galactic spheroids	we discuss a possible physical connection between helium-rich (y &gt; 0.35)stellar populations of massive globular clusters (gcs) and the ultraviolet (uv)upturn of galactic spheroids by using analytical and numerical models. in ourmodel, all stars are initially formed as bound or unbound star clusters (scs)formed from giant molecular clouds (gmcs) and the scs can finally become gcs,open clusters, and field stars depending on physical properties of their hostgmcs. an essential ingredient of the model is that helium-rich stars are formedalmost purely from gas ejected from massive asymptotic giant branch (agb)stars. the helium-rich star formation is assumed to occur within massive scs ifthe masses of the progenitor gmcs are larger than a threshold mass (m_thres).these massive scs can finally become either massive gcs or helium-rich fieldstars depending on whether they are disintegrated or not. using this model, weshow that if the initial mass functions (imfs) in galactic spheroids are mildlytop-heavy, then the mass fractions of helium-rich main-sequence stars (f_he)can be as large as ~ 0.1 for m_thres=10^7 m_sun. f_he is found to depend onimfs and m_thres such that it can be larger for shallower imfs and smallerm_thres. the inner regions of galactic spheroids show larger f_he in almost allmodels. based on these results, we suggest that if the uv upturn of ellipticalgalaxies is due to the larger fractions of helium-rich stars, then the origincan be closely associated with top-heavy imfs in the galaxies.

1112.6191	the tidal origin of the magellanic stream and the possibility of a  stellar counterpart	we present an n-body model that reproduces the morphology and kinematics ofthe magellanic stream (ms), a vast neutral hydrogen (hi) structure that trailsbehind the large and small magellanic clouds (lmc and smc, respectively) intheir orbit about the milky way. after investigating 8 million possible orbitsconsistent with the latest proper motions, we adopt an orbital history in whichthe lmc and smc have only recently become a strongly interacting binary pair.we find that their first close encounter 2 gyr ago provides the necessary tidalforces to disrupt the disk of the smc and thereby create the ms. the model alsoreproduces the on-sky bifurcation of the two filaments of the ms, and wesuggest that a bound association with the milky way is required to reproducethe bifurcation. additional hi structures are created during the tidalevolution of the smc disk, including the magellanic bridge, the"counter-bridge", and two branches of leading material. insights into thechemical evolution of the lmc are also provided, as a substantial fraction ofthe material stripped away from the smc is engulfed by the lmc. lastly wecompare three different n-body realizations of the stellar component of thesmc, which we model as a pressure-supported spheroid motivated by recentkinematical observations. we find that an extended spheroid is better able toexplain the stellar periphery of the smc, and the tidal evolution of thespheroid may imply the existence of a stellar stream akin to the gaseous ms.

1201.1019	two-component galactic bulge probed with renewed galactic chemical  evolution model	results of recent observations of the galactic bulge demand that we discard asimple picture of its formation, suggesting the presence of two stellarpopulations represented by two peaks of stellar metallicity distribution (mdf)in the bulge. to assess this issue, we construct galactic chemical evolutionmodels that have been updated in two respects: first, the delay timedistribution (dtd) of type ia supernovae (sne ia) recently revealed byextensive sn ia surveys is incorporated into the models. second, thenucleosynthesis clock, the s-processing in asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars,is carefully considered in this study. this novel model first shows that thegalaxy feature tagged by the key elements, mg, fe, ba for the bulge as well asthin and thick disks is compatible with a short-delay sn ia. we present asuccessful modeling of a two-component bulge including the mdf and theevolutions of [mg/fe] and [ba/mg], and reveal its origin as follows. ametal-poor component (&lt;[fe/h]&gt;~-0.5) is formed with a relatively shorttimescale of ~1 gyr. these properties are identical to the thick disk'scharacteristics in the solar vicinity. subsequently from its remaining gasmixed with a gas flow from the disk outside the bulge, a metal-rich component(&lt;[fe/h]&gt;~+0.3) is formed with a longer timescale (~4 gyr) together with atop-heavy initial mass function that might be identified with the thin diskcomponent within the bulge.

1202.0358	the influences of the magellanic clouds on the galaxy: pole shift, warp,  and star formation history	we investigate how the large magellanic cloud (lmc) influences the evolutionof the galaxy after the lmc enters into the virial radius of the dark matterhalo of the galaxy for the first time. both the galaxy and the lmc are modeledas n-body particles in our models so that the dynamical influences of the lmcon the galaxy can be investigated in a fully self-consistent manner.furthermore, the orbital parameters for the lmc are carefully chosen such thatthe present location of the lmc in the galaxy can be rather preciselyreproduced in our simulations. we particularly investigate the influences ofthe lmc on the precession rate, the outer stellar and gaseous structures, andthe star formation history of the galaxy. our principals results are summarizedas follows. the lmc-galaxy dynamical interaction can cause "pole shift" (orirregular precession/nutation) of the galaxy and the typical rate of pole shift(dot {\theta}_{d}) is ~2 degree gyr^{-1} corresponding to ~ 7 muas yr^{-1}. thelmc-galaxy interaction induces the formation of the outer warp structures ofthe galaxy, which thus confirms the results of previous numerical simulationson the formation of the galactic warp. the lmc-galaxy interaction also inducesthe formation of outer (r&gt;20 kpc) spiral arms and increases the verticalvelocity dispersion of the outer disk significantly. the mean star formationrate of the galaxy for the last several gyrs can be hardly influenced by thelmc's tidal force. the age and metallicity distribution of stars in thesolar-neighborhood (7 kpc &lt; r &lt; 10 kpc) for the last several gyr can be onlyslightly changed by the past lmc-galaxy interaction. based on these results, wediscuss how the possible ongoing galactic pole shift with 10 muas yr^{-1} canbe detected by future observational studies by gaia.

1204.4213	first evidence of globular cluster formation from the ejecta of prompt  type ia supernovae	recent spectroscopic observations of globular clusters (gcs) in the largemagellanic cloud (lmc) have discovered that one of the intermediate-age gc, ngc1718 with [fe/h]=-0.7 has an extremely low [mg/fe] ratio of ~-0.9. we proposethat ngc 1718 was formed from the ejecta of type ia supernovae (sne ia) mixedwith very metal-poor ([fe/h] &lt;-1.3) gas about ~ 2 gyr ago. the proposedscenario is shown to be consistent with the observed abundances of fe-groupelements such as cr, mn, and ni. in addition, compelling evidence forasymptotic giant branch stars playing a role in chemical enrichment during thisgc formation is found. we suggest that the origin of the metal-poor gas isclosely associated with the efficient gas-transfer from the outer gas disk ofthe small magellanic cloud to the lmc disk. we anticipate that the outer partof the lmc disk contains field stars exhibiting significantly low [mg/fe]ratios, formed through the same process as ngc 1718.

0711.3515	the magellanic impact: collision between the outer galactic hi disk and  the leading arms of the magellanic stream	we show that collisions between the outer galactic hi disk and the leadingarms (las) of the magellanic stream (ms) can create giant hi holes andchimney-like structures in the disk. based on the results of our n-bodysimulations on the last 2.5 gyr evolution of the large and small magellanicclouds (lmc and smc, respectively) interacting with the galaxy, we investigatewhen and where the las can pass through the galactic plane after the msformation. we then investigate hydrodynamical interaction between las and thegalactic hi disk (``the magellanic impact'') by using our new hydrodynamicalsimulations with somewhat idealized models of the las. we find that about 1-3%of the initial gas mass of the smc, which consists of the las, can pass throughthe outer part (r=20-35 kpc) of the galactic hi disk about 0.2 gyr ago. we alsofind that the magellanic impact can push out some fraction (~1%) of the outergalactic hi disk to form 1-10 kpc-scale hi holes and chimney-like bridgesbetween the las and the disk.

1210.2475	feedback effects of aspherical supernovae explosions on galaxies	we investigate how explosions of aspherical supernovae (a-sne) can influencestar formation histories and chemical evolution of dwarf galaxies by using anew chemodynamical model. we mainly present the numerical results of twocomparative models so that the a-sn feedback effects on galaxies can be moreclearly seen. sne originating from stars with masses larger than 30m_sun area-sne in the "asn" model whereas all sne are spherical ones (s-sne) in the"ssn" model. each s-sn and a-sn are assumed to release feedback energy of10^{51} erg and 10^{52} erg, respectively, and chemical yields and feedbackenergy of a-sn ejecta depend on angles between the axis of symmetry and theejection directions. we find that star formation can become at least by afactor of ~3 lower in the asn model in comparison with the ssn one owing to themore energetic feedback of a-sne. as a result of this, chemical evolution canproceed very slowly in the asn model. a-sn feedback effects can play asignificant role in the formation of giant gaseous holes and energetic gaseousoutflow and unique chemical abundances (e.g., high [mg/ca]). based on theseresults, we provide a number of implications of the a-sn feedback effects ongalaxy formation and evolution.

1210.3968	chemical evolution of the large magellanic cloud	we adopt a new chemical evolution model for the large magellanic cloud (lmc)and thereby investigate its past star formation and chemical enrichmenthistories. the delay time distribution of type ia supernovae recently revealedby type ia supernova surveys is incorporated self-consistently into the newmodel. the principle results are summarized as follows. the present gas massfraction and stellar metallicity as well as the higher [ba/fe] in metal-poorstars at [fe/h]&lt;-1.5 can be more self-consistently explained by models withsteeper initial mass functions. the observed higher [mg/fe] (&gt; 0.3) at [fe/h] ~-0.6 and higher [ba/fe] (&gt;0.5) at [fe/h] ~ -0.3 can be due to significantlyenhanced star formation about 2 gyr ago. the observed overall [ca/fe]-[fe/h]relation and remarkably low [ca/fe] (&lt;-0.2) at [fe/h]&gt;-0.6 are consistent withmodels with short-delay supernova ia and with the more efficient loss of capossibly caused by an explosion mechanism of type ii supernovae. although themetallicity distribution functions do not show double peaks in the models witha starburst about 2 gyr ago, they show characteristic double peaks in themodels with double starbursts at ~200 myr and ~2 gyr ago. the observed apparentdip of [fe/h] around ~1.5 gyr ago in the age--metallicity relation can bereproduced by models in which a large amount (~10^9 m_{sun}) of metal-poor([fe/h]&lt;-1) gas can be accreted onto the lmc.

1301.7128	evolution of the high-mass end of the stellar initial mass functions in  starburst galaxies	we investigate the time evolution and spatial variation of the stellarinitial mass function (imf) in star-forming disk galaxies by usingchemodynamical simulations with an imf model depending both on local densitiesand metallicities ([fe/h]) of the interstellar medium (ism). we find that theslope (alpha) of a power-law imf (n(m) ~ m^-alpha) for stellar masses largerthan 1m_sun evolves from the canonical salpeter imf (alpha ~ 2.35) to bemoderately top-heavy one (alpha ~ 1.9) in the simulated disk galaxies withstarbursts triggered by galaxy interaction. we also find that alpha instar-forming regions correlates with star formation rate densities (sigma_sfrin units of m_sun yr^{-1} kpc^{-2}). feedback effects of type ia and iisupernovae are found to prevent imfs from being too top-heavy (alpha &lt; 1.5).the simulation predicts alpha ~ 0.23 log sigma_sfr + 1.7 for log sigma_sfr &gt; -2(i.e., more top-heavy in higher sigma_sfr), which is reasonably consistent wellwith corresponding recent observational results. the present study alsopredicts that inner regions of starburst disk galaxies have smaller alpha thusare more top-heavy (d alpha/d r ~ 0.07 kpc^{-1} for r &lt; 5 kpc). the predictedradial alpha gradient can be tested against future observational studies of thealpha variation in star-forming galaxies.

1304.1633	coevolution of dust, gas, and stars in galaxies - i. spatial  distributions and scaling-relations of dust and molecular hydrogen	we investigate the time evolution of dust properties, molecular hydrogen(h_2) contents, and star formation histories in galaxies by using our originalchemodynamical simulations. the simulations include the formation of dust inthe stellar winds of supernovae (sne) and asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars,the growth and destruction processes of dust in the interstellar medium (ism),the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) dust in carbon-rich agbstars, the h_2 formation on dust grains, and the h_2 photo-dissociation due tofar ultra-violet (fuv) light in a self-consistent manner. we focus mainly ondisk galaxies with different total masses in this preliminary study. theprinciple results are as follows: the star formation histories of disk galaxiescan be regulated by the time evolution of interstellar dust, mainly because theformation rates of h_2 can be controlled by dust properties. the observedcorrelation between dust-to-gas-ratios (d) and gas-phase oxygen abundances (a_o= 12+log(o/h)) can be reproduced reasonably well in the present models. thedisks show negative radial gradients (i.e., larger in inner regions) of h_2fraction (f_h2), pah-to-dust mass ratio (f_pah), d, and a_o and these gradientsevolve with time. the surface-mass densities of dust (sigma_dust) arecorrelated more strongly with the total surface gas densities than with thoseof h_2. local gaseous regions with higher d are more likely to have higher f_h2in individual disks and total h_2 masses correlate well with total dust masses.more massive disk galaxies are more likely to have higher d, f_pah, and f_h2and smaller dust-to-stellar mass ratios. we also compare between galactic starformation histories in the metallicity-dependent and dust-dependent starformation models and find no major differences.

1304.7938	choirs, hi galaxy groups: catalogue and detection of star-forming dwarf  group members	h{\alpha} observations centred on galaxies selected from the hi parkes allsky survey (hipass, barnes et al. 2001) typically show one and sometimes twostar-forming galaxies within the approximately 15-arcminute beam of the parkes64-m hi detections. in our survey of ionization in neutral gas galaxies (singg,meurer et al. 2006) we found fifteen cases of hipass sources containing four ormore emission line galaxies (elgs). we name these fields choir groups. in themost extreme case we found a field with at least nine elgs. in this paper wepresent a catalogue of choir group members in the context of the wider singgsample. the dwarf galaxies in the choir groups would not be individuallydetectable in hipass at the observed distances if they were isolated, but aredetected in singg narrow-band imaging due to their membership of groups withsufficiently large total hi mass. the elgs in these groups are similar to thewider singg sample in terms of size, h{\alpha} equivalent width, and surfacebrightness. eight of these groups have two large spiral galaxies with severaldwarf galaxies and may be thought of as morphological analogues of the localgroup. however, on average our groups are not significantly hi-deficient,suggesting that they are at an early stage of assembly, and more like the m81group. the choir groups are very compact at typically only 190 kpc in projecteddistance between the two brightest members. they are very similar to singgfields in terms of star formation efficiency (the ratio of star formation rateto hi mass; sfe), showing an increasing trend in sfe with stellar mass.

1309.0526	stripping of nitrogen-rich agb ejecta from interacting dwarf irregular  galaxies	dwarf irregular galaxies (dirrs) including the magellanic clouds in the localuniverse, in many cases, exhibit an unusually low n/o abundance ratio (log n/o~ -1.5) in h ii regions as compared with the solar value (~-0.9). this ratio isbroadly equivalent to the average level of extremely metal-poor stars in thegalactic halo, suggesting that n released from asymptotic giant branch (agb)stars is missing in the present-day interstellar matter of these dirrs. we findevidence for past tidal interactions in the properties of individual dirrsexhibiting low n/o ratios, while a clear signature of interactions is unseenfor dirrs with high n/o ratios. accordingly, we propose that the ejecta ofmassive agb stars that correspond to a major production site of n can bestripped from dirrs that have undergone a strong interaction with a luminousgalaxy. the physical process of its stripping is made up of two stages: (i) theejecta of massive agb stars in a dirr are first merged with those of thebursting prompt sne ia and pushed up together to the galaxy halo, and (ii)subsequently through tidal interactions with a luminous galaxy, these ejectaare stripped from a dwarf galaxy's potential well. our new chemical evolutionmodels with stripping of agb ejecta succeed in reproducing the observed low n/oratio. furthermore, we perform n-body + hydrodynamical simulations to trace thefate of agb ejecta inside a dirr orbiting the milky way, and confirm that atidal interaction is responsible for the efficient stripping of agb ejecta fromdirrs.

1309.3878	simulating galaxy evolution with a non-universal stellar initial mass  function	we consider that the stellar initial mass function (imf) depends on physicalproperties of star-forming molecular clouds in galaxies and thereby investigatehow such a non-universal imf (nuimf) influences galaxy evolution. weincorporate a nuimf model into galaxy-scale chemodynamical simulations in orderto investigate the differences in chemical and dynamical evolution of diskgalaxies between the nuimf and universal imf (uimf) models. in the adoptednuimf model, the three slopes of the kroupa imf depend independently ondensities and metallicities ([fe/h]) of molecular gas clouds, and productionrates of metals and dust from massive and agb stars can vary according to thetime evolution of the three imf slopes. the preliminary results of thesimulations are as follows. star formation rates in actively star-forming diskgalaxies can be significantly lower in the nuimf model than in the uimf model,and the differences between the two models can be more remarkable in galaxieswith higher sfrs. chemical enrichment can proceed more rapidly in the nuimfmodel and [mg/fe] for a given metallicity is higher in the nuimf model. theevolution of h2 fraction (f_h2) and dust-to-gas ratio (d) is more rapid in thenuimf model so that the final f_h2 and $d$ can be higher in the nuimf model.formation of massive stellar clumps in gas-rich disks is more stronglysuppressed owing to the stronger sn feedback effect in the nuimf model. theradial density profiles of new stars within the central 1kpc are shallower inthe nuimf model.

0705.0780	massive stars and globular cluster formation	we first present chemodynamical simulations to investigate how stellar windsof massive stars influence early dynamical and chemical evolution of formingglobular clusters (gcs). in our numerical models, gcs form inturbulent,high-density giant molecular clouds (gmcs), which are embedded in amassive dark matter halo at high redshifts. we show how high-density, compactstellar systems are formed from gmcs influenced both by physical processesassociated with star formation and by tidal fields of their host halos. we alsoshow that chemical pollution of gc-forming gmcs by stellar winds from massivestars can result in star-to-star abundance inhomogeneities among light elements(e.g., c, n, and o) of stars in gcs. the present model with a canonical initialmass function (imf) also shows a c-n anticorrelation that stars with smaller[c/fe] have larger [n/fe] in a gc. although these results imply that``self-pollution'' of gc-forming gmcs by stellar winds from massive stars cancause abundance inhomogeneities of gcs, the present models with differentparameters and canonical imfs can not show n-rich stars with [n/fe] ~ 0.8observed in some gcs (e.g., ngc 6752). we discuss this apparent failure in thecontext of massive star formation preceding low-mass one within gc-forming gmcs(``bimodal star formation scenario''). we also show that although almost allstars (~97%) show normal he abundances (y) of ~0.24 some stars later formed ingmcs can have y as high as ~0.3 in some models. the number fraction of he-richstars with y &gt;0.26 is however found to be small (~10^-3) for most models.

1311.1633	origin of a bottom-heavy stellar initial mass function in elliptical  galaxies	we investigate the origin of a bottom-heavy stellar initial mass function(imf) recently observed in elliptical galaxies by using chemical evolutionmodels with a non-universal imf. we adopt the kroupa imf with the three slopes(alpha_1, alpha_2, and alpha_3) dependent on metallicities ([fe/h]) anddensities (rho_g) of star-forming gas clouds and thereby search for the bestimf model that can reproduce (i) the observed steep imf slope (alpha_2 ~ 3,i.e., bottom-heavy) for low stellar masses (m &lt; 1 m_sun) and (ii) thecorrelation of alpha_2 with chemical properties of elliptical galaxies in aself-consistent manner. we find that if the imf slope alpha_2 depends both on[fe/h] and rho_g, then elliptical galaxies with higher [mg/fe] can have steeperalpha_2 (~3) in our models. we also find that the observed positive correlationof stellar mass-to-light ratios (m/l) with [mg/fe] in elliptical galaxies canbe quantitatively reproduced in our models with alpha_2 = beta[fe/h]}+gamma logrho_g, where beta ~ 0.5 and gamma ~ 2. we discuss whether the imf slopes forlow-mass (alpha_2) and high-mass stars (alpha_3) need to vary independentlyfrom each other to explain a number of imf-related observational resultsself-consistently. we also briefly discuss why alpha_2 depends differently on[fe/h] in dwarf and giant elliptical galaxies.

1311.3010	galactic star formation enhanced and quenched by ram pressure in groups  and clusters	we investigate how ram pressure of intragroup and intracluster medium caninfluence the spatial and temporal variations of star formation (sf) of diskgalaxies with halo masses (m_h) ranging from 10^10 m_sun to 10^12 m_sun (i.e.,from dwarf irregular to milky way-type) in groups and clusters with 10^13 &lt;m_h/m_sun &lt; 10^15 by using numerical simulations with a new model fortime-varying ram pressure. the long-term evolution of sf rates and h_alphamorphologies corresponding to the distributions of star-forming regions areparticularly investigated for different model parameters. the principal resultsare as follows. whether ram pressure can enhance or reduce sf depends on m_h ofdisk galaxies and inclination angles of gas disks with respect to their orbitaldirections for a given orbit and a given environment. for example, sf can bemoderately enhanced in disk galaxies with m_h=10^12 m_sun at the pericenterpassages in a cluster with m_h=10^14 m_sun whereas it can be completely shutdown (`quenching') for low-mass disks with m_h=10^10 m_sun. ram pressure canreduce the h_alpha-to-optical-disk-size ratios of disks and the revel of thereduction depends on m_h and orbits of disk galaxies for a given environment.disk galaxies under strong ram pressure show characteristic h_alphamorphologies such as ring-like, one-sided, and crescent-like distributions.

1401.0955	choirs hi galaxy groups: the metallicity of dwarf galaxies	we present a recalibration of the luminosity-metallicity relation forgas-rich, star-forming dwarfs to magnitudes as faint as m$_r$ ~ -13. we use thedopita et al. (2013) metallicity calibrations to calibrate the relation for allof the data in this analysis. in metallicity-luminosity space we find twosub-populations within a sample of high-confidence sdss dr8 star-forminggalaxies; 52% are metal-rich giants and 48% are metal-medium galaxies.metal-rich dwarfs classified as tidal dwarf galaxy (tdg) candidates in theliterature are typically of metallicity 12 + log(o/h) = 8.70 $\pm$ 0.05, whilesdss dwarfs fainter than m$_r$ = -16 have a mean metallicity of 12 + log(o/h) =8.28 $\pm$ 0.10, regardless of their luminosity, indicating that there is anapproximate floor to the metallicity of low luminosity galaxies. ourhydrodynamical simulations predict that tdgs should have metallicities elevatedabove the normal luminosity-metallicity relation. metallicity can therefore bea useful diagnostic for identifying tdg candidate populations in the absence oftidal tails. at magnitudes brighter than m$_r$ ~ -16 our sample of 53star-forming galaxies in 9 hi gas-rich groups is consistent with the normalrelation defined by the sdss sample. at fainter magnitudes there is an increasein dispersion in metallicity of our sample, suggestive of a wide range of hicontent and environment. in our sample we identify three (16% of dwarfs) strongtdg candidates (12 + log(o/h) &gt; 8.6), and four (21%) very metal poor dwarfs (12+ log(o/h) &lt; 8.0), which are likely gas-rich dwarfs with recently ignited starformation.

1401.3055	tidal-induced lopsidedness in magellanic-type galaxies	we investigate the tidally-induced conversion of barred late-type spirals tomagellanic-type discs with numerical simulations, to establish how the lifetimeof lopsidedness (asymmetry) varies with numerical parametrizations. using areference model based on observed properties of the large magellanic cloud(lmc), we show that its off-centre bar, one-arm spiral and one-sided starformation can be induced by a brief tidal interaction. we thereafter perform adetailed parameter study, and find that at the dynamical mass of lmc-type discs($\sim$10$^{\rm 10}$ \md{}), stellar lopsidedness (as quantified by the m$=$1fourier mode) and bar off-centredness can vary widely in amplitude, but aregenerally short-lived ($\sim$gyr). tidal interactions induce more persistentlopsidedness in lower mass galaxies (several gyr), in particular those withlarge halo-to-disc mass ratios as implied by recent halo occupation models. wesuggest that the tidal interactions play a larger role in the observed ubiquityof lopsidedness than the presently favoured gas accretion mechanism for lowermass galaxies. other characteristics of magellanic-type galaxies, such asone-sided star formation, are quantified and tend to arise more prominently indiscs with later-type spiral structure (more halo dominated inner disc, weakerbars) following retrograde orbital encounters.

1406.1259	the vmc survey. xi. radial stellar population gradients in the galactic  globular cluster 47 tucanae	we present a deep near-infrared color--magnitude diagram of the galacticglobular cluster 47 tucanae, obtained with the visible and infrared surveytelescope for astronomy (vista) as part of the vista near-infrared y, j, k_ssurvey of the magellanic system (vmc). the cluster stars comprising both thesubgiant and red-giant branches exhibit apparent, continuous variations incolor--magnitude space as a function of radius. subgiant-branch stars at largerradii are systematically brighter than their counterparts closer to the clustercore; similarly, red-giant-branch stars in the cluster's periphery are bluerthan their more centrally located cousins. the observations can very well bedescribed by adopting an age spread of ~0.5 gyr as well as radial gradients inboth the cluster's helium abundance (y) and metallicity (z), which changegradually from y = 0.28, z = 0.005 in the cluster core to y = 0.25, z = 0.003in its periphery. we conclude that the cluster's inner regions host asignificant fraction of second-generation stars, which decreases withincreasing radius; the stellar population in the 47 tuc periphery is wellapproximated by a simple stellar population.

1406.1642	evolution of dust and molecular hydrogen in the magellanic system	we investigate the evolution of the interstellar medium (ism) inself-consistent, chemodynamical simulations of the magellanic clouds (mcs)during their recent (z&lt;0.3) past. an explicit modelling of dust and molecularhydrogen lifecycles enables the comparison of our models against the observedproperties of the ism, including elemental depletion from the gas-phase.combining this model with a tidal-dominated paradigm for the formation for themagellanic stream and bridge, we reproduce the age-metallicity relations, longgas depletion timescales, and presently observed dust and molecular hydrogenmasses of the mcs to within their respective uncertainties. we find that thesemodels' enrichment depends sensitively on the processing of dust within the ismand the dynamical influence of external tides/stellar bars. the ratio ofcharacteristic dust destruction timescales in our smc and lmc models, agoverning parameter of our models' evolution, is consistent with estimatesbased on observed supernova (sn) rates. our reference mc models tend to exhibitthe disputed universal dust-to-metal ratio, which we argue stems from theadoption of high sne ii condensation efficiencies. our models are the first toreproduce the one-tenth solar metallicity of the stream/leading arm followingtidal stripping of the smc; the hypothesis that the lmc contributes ametal-rich filament to the stream, as implied by recent kinematic and abundanceanalyses, is also appraised in this study.

1407.6468	formation and evolution of molecular hydrogen in disk galaxies with  different masses and hubble types	we investigate the physical properties of molecular hydrogen (h2) in isolatedand interacting disk galaxies with different masses and hubble types by usingchemodynamical simulations with h2 formation on dust grains and dust growth anddestruction in interstellar medium (ism). we particularly focus on thedependences of h2 gas mass fractions (f_h2), spatial distributions of hi andh2, and local h2-scaling relations on initial halo masses (m_h), baryonicfractions (f_bary), gas mass fractions (f_g), and hubble types. the principalresults are as follows. the final f_h2 can be larger in disk galaxies withhigher m_h, f_bary, and f_g. some low-mass disk models with m_h smaller than10^10 m_sun show extremely low f_h2 and thus no/little star formation, even ifinitial f_g is quite large (&gt;0.9). big galactic bulges can severely suppressthe formation of h2 from hi on dust grains whereas strong stellar bars can notonly enhance f_h2 but also be responsible for the formation of h2-dominatedcentral rings. the projected radial distributions of h2 are significantly morecompact than those of hi and the simulated radial profiles of h2-to-hi-ratios(r_mol) follow roughly r^-1.5 in mw-type disk models. galaxy interaction cansignificantly increase f_h2 and total h2 mass in disk galaxies. the localsurface mass densities of h2 can be correlated with those of dust in a galaxy.the observed correlation between r_mol and gas pressure (r_mol ~ p_g^0.92) canbe well reproduced in the simulated disk galaxies.

1408.5197	chemical evolution of galaxies with radiation-driven dust wind	we discuss how the removal of interstellar dust by radiation pressure ofstars influences the chemical evolution of galaxies by using a new one-zonechemical evolution models with dust wind. the removal efficiency of an element(e.g., fe, mg, and ca) through radiation-driven dust wind in a galaxy isassumed to depend both on the dust depletion level of the element ininterstellar medium and the total luminosity of the galaxy in the new model. weparticularly focus on the time evolution of [alpha/fe] and its dependence onmodel parameters for dust wind in this study. the principal results are asfollows. the time evolution of [ca/fe] is significantly different betweenmodels with and without dust wind in the sense that [ca/fe] can besystematically lower in the models with dust wind. the time evolution of[mg/fe], on the other hand, can not be so different between the models with andwithout dust wind owing to the lower level of dust depletion for mg. as aresult of this, [mg/ca] can be systematically higher in the models with dustwind. we compare these results with the observed elemental features of stars inthe large magellanic cloud (lmc), because a growing number of observationalstudies on [alpha/fe] for the lmc have been recently accumulated for a detailedcomparison. based on the present new results, we also discuss the origins of[alpha/fe] in the fornax dwarf galaxy and elliptical galaxies in the context ofradiation-driven dust wind.

1412.1239	cosmic evolution of dust in galaxies: methods and preliminary results	we investigate the redshift (z) evolution of dust properties, its dependenceson initial conditions of galaxy formation, and physical correlations betweendust, gas, and stellar contents at different z based on our originalchemodynamical simulations of galaxy formation with dust growth anddestruction. in this preliminary investigation, we first determine thereasonable ranges of the most important two parameters for dust evolution,i.e., the timescales of dust growth and destruction, by comparing the observedand simulated dust properties and molecular hydrogen h2 content of the galaxy.we then investigate the z-evolution of dust-to-gas-ratios (d) and, h2 gasfraction (f_h2), and gas-phase chemical abundances (e.g., a_o=12+log(o/h)) inthe simulated disk and dwarf galaxies. the principal results are as follows.both d and f_h2 can rapidly increase during the early dissipative formation ofgalactic disks (z ~ 2-3) and the z-evolution of these depends on initial massdensities, spin parameters, and masses of galaxies. the observed a_o-d relationcan be qualitatively reproduced, but the simulated dispersion of d at a givena_o is smaller. the simulated galaxies with larger total dust masses showlarger h2 and stellar masses and higher f_h2. disk galaxies show negativeradial gradients of d and the gradients are steeper for more massive galaxies.both dust-to-metal ratios and gas-phase [s/fe] can be significantly differentwithin a single galaxy and between different galaxies at different z, whichmeans that fixed dust-to-metal ratios should not be used in investigating h2contents and spectral energy distributions of galaxies.

1501.05347	the vmc survey - xiv. first results on the look-back time star-formation  rate tomography of the small magellanic cloud	we analyse deep images from the vista survey of the magellanic clouds in theyjks filters, covering 14 sqrdeg (10 tiles), split into 120 subregions, andcomprising the main body and wing of the small magellanic cloud (smc). we applya colour--magnitude diagram reconstruction method that returns theirbest-fitting star formation rate sfr(t), age-metallicity relation (amr),distance and mean reddening, together with 68% confidence intervals. thedistance data can be approximated by a plane tilted in the east-west directionwith a mean inclination of 39 deg, although deviations of up to 3 kpc suggest adistorted and warped disk. after assigning to every observed star a probabilityof belonging to a given age-metallicity interval, we build high-resolutionpopulation maps. these dramatically reveal the flocculent nature of the youngstar-forming regions and the nearly smooth features traced by older stellargenerations. they document the formation of the smc wing at ages &lt;0.2 gyr andthe peak of star formation in the smc bar at 40 myr. we clearly detect periodsof enhanced star formation at 1.5 gyr and 5 gyr. the former is possibly relatedto a new feature found in the amr, which suggests ingestion of metal-poor gasat ages slightly larger than 1 gyr. the latter constitutes a major period ofstellar mass formation. we confirm that the sfr(t) was moderately low at evenolder ages.

1501.05459	dust-regulated galaxy formation and evolution:a new chemodynamical model  with live dust particles	interstellar dust plays decisive roles in the conversion of neutral tomolecular hydrogen (h_2), the thermodynamical evolution of interstellar medium(ism), and the modification of spectral energy distributions (seds) ofgalaxies. these important roles of dust have not been self-consistentlyincluded in previous numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.we have therefore developed a new model by which one can investigate whetherand how galaxy formation and evolution can be influenced by dust-relatedphysical processes such as photo-electric heating, h_2 formation on dust, andstellar radiation pressure on dust in detail. a novel point of the model isthat different dust species in a galaxy are represented by `live dust'particles (i.e., not test particles). therefore, dust particles in a galaxy notonly interact gravitationally with all four components of the galaxy (i.e.,dark matter, stars, gas, and dust) but also are grown and destroyed throughphysical processes of ism. first we describe a way to include dust-relatedphysical processes in nbody+hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy evolution indetail. then we show some preliminary results of dust-regulated galaxyevolution. the preliminary results suggest that the evolution of dustdistributions driven by radiation pressure of stars is very important for theevolution of star formation rates, chemical abundances, h_2 fractions, and gasdistributions in galaxies.

0804.4563	formation of the small magellanic cloud: ancient major merger as a  solution to the kinematical differences between old stars and hi gas	recent observations of the small magellanic cloud (smc) have revealed thatthe hi gas shows a significant amount of rotation (v_c 60 km/s), while no orlittle rotation is evident for the old stellar populations. we suggest thatthis unique kinematical difference between these components in the smc can becaused by a major merger event which occurred in the early stage of the smcformation. our simulations show that dissipative dwarf-dwarf merging cantransform two gas-rich dwarf irregulars into a new dwarf, which consists of aspheroidal stellar component and a rotating extended hi disk. the remnant ofthis dwarf-dwarf merging shows significantly different kinematics between starsand gas, in the sense that a gas disk rotates rapidly while a stellar componentshows little rotation. we thus suggest that the simulated dwarf having adynamically hot spheroid and an extended gas disk finally evolves into thepresent smc after efficient stripping of the outer gas via tidal fields of thegalaxy and the large magellanic cloud. we also suggest that spatialdistributions and kinematics of rgb and agb stars with different ages in thepossible spheroidal component of the smc can provide valuable information onwhether and when a past major merger event really occurred in the smc.

0805.0662	formation of blue compact dwarf galaxies from merging and interacting  gas-rich dwarfs	we present the results of numerical simulations which show the formation ofblue compact dwarf (bcd) galaxies from merging between very gas-rich dwarfswith extended hi gas disks. we show that dwarf-dwarf merging can triggercentral starbursts and form massive compact cores dominated by young stellarpopulations. we also show that the pre-existing old stellar components inmerger precursor dwarfs can become diffuse low surface brightness componentsafter merging. the compact cores dominated by younger stellar populations andembedded in more diffusely distributed older ones can be morphologicallyclassified as bcds. since new stars can be formed from gas transferred from theouter part of the extended gas disks of merger precursors, new stars can bevery metal-poor ([fe/h] &lt; -1). owing to very high gaseous pressure exceeding10^5 k_b (where k_b is the boltzmann constant) during merging, compact starclusters can be formed in forming bcds. the bcds formed from merging can stillhave extended hi gas disks surrounding their blue compact cores. we discusswhether tidal interaction of gas-rich dwarfs without merging can also formbcds.

0805.2208	origin of dwarf irregular galaxies with outer early-type structures	recent observations have reported that some gas-rich dwarf irregular (dirr)galaxies appear to have spherical distributions in the outer underlying old andintermediate-age stellar populations (e.g., ngc 6822). these observations implythat some dirr's have two distinct (or ``two-component'') structures, i.e.,inner disky and outer spherical ones, though the number fraction of dirr's withsuch structures remains observationally unclear. we discuss how such twodistinct structures are formed during dirr formation based on observations andsimulations. our numerical simulations show that the remnants of mergersbetween two gas-rich dirr's with initially extended gas disks can have bothextended spheroids composed of older stellar populations and disks composedmostly of gas and young stars. the simulated remnants with two distinctstructures can be still identified as dirr's owing to the presence ofstar-forming regions. the structural properties of outer spherical structuresin dirr's formed from dirr-dirr merging depend on initial conditions ofmerging, which suggests that outer structures in dirr's can be diverse. we alsodiscuss other possible physical mechanisms for the formation of outer sphericalstructures composed of older stars in dirr's.

1507.03327	the origin of dust extinction curves with or without the 2175 a bump in  galaxies: the case of the magellanic clouds	the large and small magellanic clouds (lmc and smc, respectively) areobserved to have characteristic dust extinction curves that are quite differentfrom those of the galaxy (e.g., strength of the 2175 a bump). although the dustcomposition and size distribution of the magellanic clouds (mcs) that canself-consistently explain their observed extinction curves have been alreadyproposed, it remain unclear whether and how the required dust properties can beachieved in the formation histories of the mcs. we therefore investigate thetime evolution of the dust properties of the mcs and thereby derive theirextinction curves using one-zone chemical evolution models with formation andevolution of small and large silicate and carbonaceous dust grains and dustywinds associated with starburst events. we find that the observed smcextinction curve without a conspicuous 2175 a bump can be reproduced well byour smc model, if the small carbon grains can be selectively lost through thedust wind during the latest starburst about 0.2 gyr ago. we also find that thelmc extinction curve with a weak 2175 a bump can be reproduced by our lmc modelwith less efficient removal of dust through dust wind. we discuss possiblephysical reasons for different dust wind efficiencies between silicate andgraphite and among galaxies.

1507.04104	the transformation and quenching of simulated gas-rich dwarf satellites  within a group environment	the underlying mechanisms driving the quenching of dwarf-mass satellitegalaxies remain poorly constrained, but recent studies suggest they areparticularly inefficient for those satellites with stellar mass 10$^{\rm 9}$m$_{\odot}$. we investigate the characteristic evolution of these systems withchemodynamical simulations and idealised models of their tidal/hydrodynamicinteractions within the 10$^{\rm 13-13.5}$ m$_{\odot}$ group-mass hosts inwhich they are preferentially quenched. our fiducial simulations highlight therole played by secular star formation and stellar bars, and demonstrate atransition from a gas-rich to passive, hi-deficient state (i.e.$\delta$sfr$\le$-1, def$_{\rm hi}$$\ge$0.5) within 6 gyr of first infall.furthermore, in the 8-10 gyr in which these systems have typically beenresident within group hosts, the bulge-to-total ratio of an initially bulgelessdisc can increase to 0.3$&lt;$b/t$&lt;$0.4, its specific angular momentum$\lambda_{\rm r}$ reduce to $\sim$0.5, and strong bisymmetries formed.ultimately, this scenario yields satellites resembling dwarf s0s, a result thatholds for a variety of infall inclinations/harassments albeit with broadscatter. the key assumptions here lie in the rapid removal of the satellite'sgaseous halo upon virial infall, and the satellite's local intra-group mediumdensity being defined by the host's spherically-averaged profile. wedemonstrate how quenching can be greatly enhanced if the satellite lies in anoverdensity, consistent with recent cosmological-scale simulations butcontrasting with observationally-inferred quenching mechanisms/timescales; anappraisal of these results with respect to the apparent preferential formationof ds0s/s0s in groups is also given.

1509.00827	the vmc survey - xvi. spatial variation of the cluster-formation  activity in the innermost regions of the large magellanic cloud	we present results based on $yjk_{\rm s}$ photometry of star clusters in thelarge magellanic cloud (lmc), distributed throughout the central part of thegalaxy's bar and the 30 doradus region. we analysed the field-stardecontaminated colour--magnitude diagrams of 313 clusters to estimate theirreddening values and ages. the clusters are affected by a mean reddening of$e(b-v) \in [0.2,0.3]$ mag, where the average internal lmc reddening amounts to$\sim$ 0.1--0.2 mag. the region covering 30 doradus includes clusters withreddening values in excess of $e(b-v)$ = 0.4 mag. our cluster sample spans theage range $7.0 \le \log(t$ yr$^{-1}) &lt; 9.0$, represents an increase of 30 percent in terms of the number of clusters with robust age estimates and comprisesa statistically complete sample in the lmc regions of interest here. theresulting cluster frequencies suggest that the outermost regions of the lmc barfirst experienced enhanced cluster formation -- $\log(t$ yr$^{-1}) \in[8.5,9.0]$ -- before the activity proceeded, although in a patchy manner, tothe innermost regions, for $\log(t$ yr$^{-1}) &lt; 7.7$. cluster frequencies inthe 30 doradus region show that the area is dominated by very recent clusterformation. the derived star-formation frequencies suggest that the cluster andfield-star populations do not seem to have fully evolved as fully coupledsystems during the last $\sim$ 100 myr.

1509.03947	formation of emission line dots and extremely metal-deficient dwarfs  from almost dark galaxies	recent observations have discovered a number of extremely gas-rich very faintdwarf galaxies possibly embedded in low-mass dark matter halos. we investigatestar formation histories of these gas-rich dwarf ("almost dark") galaxies bothfor isolated and interacting/merging cases. we find that although starformation rates (sfrs) are very low (&lt;10^-5 m_sun/yr) in the simulated dwarfsin isolation for the total halo masses (m_h) of 10^8-10^9 m_sun, they can bedramatically increased to be ~ 10^{-4} m_sun/yr when they interact or mergewith other dwarfs. these interacting faint dwarfs with central compact hiiregions can be identified as isolated emission line dots ("eldots") owing totheir very low surface brightness envelopes of old stars. the remnant of theseinteracting and merging dwarfs can finally develop central compact stellarsystems with very low metallicities (z/z_sun&lt;0.1), which can be identified asextremely metal-deficient ("xmd") dwarfs. these results imply that althoughthere would exist many faint dwarfs that can be hardly detected in the currentoptical observations, they can be detected as isolated eldots or xmd dwarfs,when they interact with other galaxies and their host environments. we predictthat nucleated ultra-faint dwarfs formed from merging of almost dark dwarfs canbe identified as globular clusters owing to the very low surface brightnessstellar envelopes, if they are distant objects.

1510.04388	formation of ultra-compact blue dwarf galaxies and their evolution into  nucleated dwarfs	we propose that there is an evolutionary link between ultra-compact bluedwarf galaxies (ucbds) with active star formation and nucleated dwarfs based onthe results of numerical simulations of dwarf-dwarf merging. we consider theobservational fact that low-mass dwarfs can be very gas-rich, and therebyinvestigate the dynamical and chemical evolution of very gas-rich, dissipativedwarf-dwarf mergers. we find that the remnants of dwarf-dwarf mergers can bedominated by new stellar populations formed from the triggered starbursts andconsequently can have blue colors and higher metallicities (z~[0.2-1]z_sun). wealso find that the remnants of these mergers can have rather highmass-densities (10^4 m_sun pc^-3) within the central 10 pc and small half-lightradii (40-100 pc). the radial stellar structures of some merger remnants aresimilar to those of nucleated dwarfs. star formation can continue in nucleargas disks (r&lt;100 pc) surrounding stellar galactic nuclei (sgns) so that thesgns can finally have multiple stellar populations with different ages andmetallicities. these very compact blue remnants can be identified as ucbds soonafter merging and as nucleated dwarfs after fading of young stars. we discussthese results in the context of the origins of metal-rich ultra-compact dwarfs(ucds) and sgns.

1510.05504	new quasars behind the magellanic clouds. spectroscopic confirmation of  near-infrared selected candidates	quasi--stellar objects (quasars) located behind nearby galaxies provide anexcellent absolute reference system for astrometric studies, but they aredifficult to identify because of fore- and background contamination. deepwide--field, high angular resolution surveys spanning the entire area of nearbygalaxies are needed to obtain a complete census of such quasars. we embarked ona program to expand the quasar reference system behind the large and the smallmagellanic clouds, the magellanic bridge, and the magellanic stream, connectingthe clouds with the milky way. hundreds of quasar candidates were selectedbased on their near--infrared colors and variability properties from theongoing public eso vista magellanic clouds survey. a subset of 49 objects wasfollowed up with optical spectroscopy. we confirmed the quasar nature of 37objects (34 new identifications), four are low redshift objects, three areprobably stars, and the remaining three lack prominent spectral features for asecure classification; bona fide quasars, judging from their broad absorptionlines are located, as follows: 10 behind the lmc, 13 behind the smc, and 14behind the bridge. the quasars span a redshift range from z~0.5 to z~4.1. uponcompletion the vmc survey is expected to yield a total of ~1500 quasars withy&lt;19.32 mag, j&lt;19.09 mag, and ks&lt;18.04 mag.

0807.1161	formation of a giant hi bridge between m31 and m33 from their tidal  interaction	recent observations have discovered a giant hi bridge that appears to connectbetween the outer halo regions of m31 and m33. we propose that this hi bridgecan be formed as a result of the past interaction between m31 and m33 based ontest particle simulations with different orbits of m31 and m33 for the last ~ 9gyr. we show that strong tidal interaction between m31 and m33 about 4-8 gyrago can strip hi gas from m33 to form hi streams around m31 which can beobserved as a hi bridge if they are projected onto the sky. we show that thenumber fraction of models reproducing well the observed hi distribution of thebridge is only ~0.01% (i.e., ~10 among ~10^5 models) and thus suggest that theobserved structure and kinematics of the hi bridge can give some constraints onthe past orbits of m31 and m33. we suggest that the observed outer hi warp inm33 could be fossil evidence for the past m31-m33 interaction. we also suggestthat some of high velocity clouds (hvcs) recently found in m31 could be hi gasoriginating from m33. we briefly discuss other possible scenarios for theformation of the hi bridge.

0807.1956	a possible common halo of the magellanic clouds	recent observational and theoretical studies on the three-dimensional (3d)space motions of the large and the small magellanic clouds (lmc and smc,respectively) have strongly suggested that the latest proper motionmeasurements of the magellanic clouds (mcs) are consistent with their orbitalevolution models in which the mcs have arrived in the galaxy quite recently forthe first time. the suggested orbital models appear to be seriouslyinconsistent with the tidal interaction models in which the magellanic stream(ms) can be formed as a result of the mutual tidal interaction between the mcsand the galaxy for the last ~2 gyr. based on orbital models of the mcs, wepropose that if the mcs have a common diffuse dark halo with the mass largerthan ~ 2 * 10^{10} m_sun, the mcs can not only have the present 3d velocitiesconsistent with the latest proper motion measurements but also interactstrongly with each other and with the galaxy for the last 2 gyr.these resultsimply that if the observed proper motions of the mcs are true ones of thecenters of mass for the mcs, the common halo of the mcs would need to beconsidered in constructing self-consistent ms formation models. we discusswhether the origin of the possible common halo can be closely associated eitherwith the past binary formation or with the mcs having been in a small group.

0807.2102	the total mass and dark halo properties of the small magellanic cloud	we discuss the total mass and dark halo properties of the small magellaniccloud (smc) for reasonable $v$-band stellar-to-mass-to-light ratios ($m_{\rms}/l_{\rm v}$) based on the high-resolution neutral hydrogen (hi) observationsof the smc. we adopt both the burkert and the nfw profiles for the dark matterhalo of the smc in order to model the radial profile of the observed rotationcurve. we show that the mass ($m_{\rm dm}$) and the mean density (${\rho}_{\rmdm}$) of the dark matter halo within the optical radius ($\sim 3$ kpc) of thesmc can be significantly low for $m_{\rm s}/l_{\rm v}=2-4$ reasonable for agalaxy dominated by older stellar populations. for example, the estimated$m_{\rm dm}$ and ${\rho}_{\rm dm}$ are $7.5 \times 10^7 {\rm m}_{\odot}$ and$6.7 \times 10^{-4} {\rm m}_{\odot}$ pc$^{-3}$, respectively, for $m_{\rms}/l_{\rm v} = 3.8$. the models with lower $m_{\rm s}/l_{\rm v}$ ($&lt;1.0$) canshow higher $m_{\rm dm}$ and ${\rho}_{\rm dm}$ yet have difficulties inreproducing the inner rotation curve profile both for the burkert and the nfwprofiles. the burkert profile with a larger core radius ($&gt;1$ kpc) (thus a lowdensity) and a large mass (${\rm m}_{\rm dm} &gt; 3 \times 10^9 {\rm m}_{\odot}$)can be better fit to the observed slowly rising rotation curve than the nfw onefor a reasonable $m_{\rm s}/l_{\rm v} \sim2$. this means that most of the darkhalo mass can be initially located outside the optical radius in the smc andthus that the dark halo would have already lost a significant fraction of itsoriginal mass due to the strong tidal interactions with the galaxy and possiblywith the large magellanic cloud (lmc).

astro-ph;0012308	gas fueling and nuclear disk formation in merging between a central  black hole and a gas clump	we numerically investigate dynamical evolution of a merger between a centralmassive black hole (mbh) and a gas clump with the mass of $10^6$ $-$ $10^7$$m_{\odot}$ in the central tens pc of a galactic bulge. we found that strongtidal gravitational field of the mbh transforms the initial spherical clumpinto a moderately thick gaseous disk (or torus) around the mbh. the developeddisk is also found to show rotation, essentially because the tidal fieldchanges efficiently the orbital angular momentum of the clump into intrinsicangular momentum of the disk. furthermore about a few percent of gas mass(corresponding to a few $10^5$ $m_{\odot}$) in the clump is found to betransferred to the central sub-parsec region around the mbh within an order of$10^6$ yr. we thus suggest that successive merging of gas clumps onto a mbh cannot only be associated closely with the formation of nuclear disk around thembh but also can provide gas fuel for the mbh.

astro-ph;0012312	alma and high redshift dusty starburst mergers	by using a new numerical code for deriving the spectral energy distributionsof galaxies, we have investigated the time evolution of morphologicalproperties, the star formation rate, and the submillimeter flux at 850 $\mu$min high-redshift ($z$) dusty starburst mergers with mass ratio ($m_{2}$) of twodisks ranging from 0.1 (minor merger) to 1.0 (major one). we found that themaximum star-formation rate, the degree of dust extinction, and the 850 $\mu$mflux are larger for mergers with larger $m_{2}$. the 850 $\mu$m flux frommergers at 1.5 $\le z \le$ 3.0 in the observer frame is found to be a few mjyfor major merger cases, and at most $\sim$ 100 $\mu$jy for minor ones. thisresult suggests that only high-redshift major mergers are now detected by scubawith the current 850 $\mu m$ detection limit of a few mjy. these results implythat lmsa (alma) with the expected detection limit of the order of 10 $\mu$jyat 850 $\mu m$ can be used to study high-redshift mergers with variouslydifferent $m_2$, and thus provide an important clue to the formation ofgalaxies in a high-redshift universe.

astro-ph;0012363	starbursts in multiple galaxy mergers	we numerically investigate stellar and gaseous dynamical evolution of mergersbetween five identical late-type disk galaxies with the special emphasis onstar formation history and chemical evolution of multiple galaxy mergers. wefound that multiple encounter and merging can trigger repetitive massivestarbursts (typically $\sim$ 100 $m_{\odot}$ ${\rm yr}^{-1}$) owing to thestrong tidal disturbance and the resultant gaseous dissipation during merging.the magnitude of the starburst is found to depend on initial virial ratio(i.e., the ratio of total kinematical energy to total potential energy) suchthat the maximum star formation rate is larger for the merger with smallervirial ratio. furthermore we found that the time interval between the epochs ofthe triggered starbursts is longer for the merger with the larger virial ratio.the remnant of a multiple galaxy merger with massive starbursts is found tohave metal-poor gaseous halo that is formed by tidal stripping during themerging. we accordingly suggest that metal-poor gaseous halo in a fieldelliptical galaxy is a fossil record of the past multiple merging events forthe galaxy.

astro-ph;0012365	photometric evolution of dusty starburst mergers:on the nature of  ultra-luminous infrared galaxies	by performing n-body simulations of chemodynamical evolution of galaxies withdusty starbursts, we investigate photometric evolution of gas-rich majormergers in order to explore the nature of ultraluminous infrared galaxies(ulirgs) with the total infrared luminosity ($l_{\rm ir}$ for $8\sim 1000$$\mu$m) of $\sim$ $10^{12}$ $l_{\odot}$. main results are the following three.(1) global colors and absolute magnitudes the during dusty starburst of a majormerger do not change with time significantly, because interstellar dust heavilyobscures young starburst populations that could cause rapid evolution ofphotometric properties of the merger. (2) dust extinction of stellarpopulations in a galaxy merger with large infrared luminosity ($l_{\rm ir}$ $&gt;$$10^{11}$ $l_{\odot}$) is selective in the sense that younger stellarpopulations are preferentially obscured by dust than old ones. this is becauseyounger populations are located in the central region where a larger amount ofdusty interstellar gas can be transferred from the outer gas-rich regions ofthe merger. (3) both $l_{\rm ir}$ and the ratio of $l_{\rm ir}$ to $b$ bandluminosity $(l_{\rm b}$) increases as the star formation rate increase duringthe starburst of the present merger model, resulting in the positivecorrelation between $l_{\rm ir}$ and $l_{\rm ir}/l_{\rm b}$.

astro-ph;0012366	formation and evolution of e+a galaxies in dusty starburst galaxies	the formation and evolution of the ``e+a'' (also named ``k+a'' and ``a+k''types by dressler et al. 1999) galaxies found in significant numbers in thecores of intermediate redshift clusters has been extensively discussed by manyauthors. in this paper, we model the spectral, dynamical and morphologicalevolution of a prime candidate for producing this spectral signature: a dustystarburst associated with a major galaxy merger. we show that as this systemevolves dynamically, its spectral type changes from and ``e(a)'' type(exhibiting strong h$\delta$ absorption and modest [oii] emission -- theidentifying features of local dusty starburst galaxies) to a k+a type and thenfinally to a passive ``k'' type. this result shows that galaxies with an e(a)spectral type can be precursors to the k+a systems and that dynamical evolutiongreatly controls the spectral evolution in these merger cases. our simulationsalso show that a merger with very high infrared luminosity ($l_{\rm ir}$ $&gt;$$10^{11}$ $l_{\odot}$) is more likely to show an e(a) spectrum, which impliesthat spectral types can be correlated with infrared fluxes in dusty starburstgalaxies. based on these results, we discuss the origin of the evolution ofk+a/a+k galaxies in distant clusters and the role merging is likely to have.

astro-ph;0012367	merging between a central massive black hole and a compact stellar  system: a clue to the origin of m31's nucleus	the central bulge of m31 is observed to have two distinct brightness peakswith the separation of $\sim$ 2 pc. tremaine (1995) recently proposed a newidea that the m31's nucleus is actually a single thick eccentric disksurrounding the central super-massive black hole. in order to explore theorigin of the proposed eccentric disk, we numerically investigate the dynamicalevolution of a merger between a central massive black hole with the mass of$\sim$ $10^7$ $m_{\odot}$ and a compact stellar system with the mass of $\sim$$10^6$ $m_{\odot}$ and the size of a few pc in the central 10 pc of a galacticbulge. we found that the stellar system is destroyed by strong tidal field ofthe massive black hole and consequently forms a rotating nuclear thick stellardisk. the orbit of each stellar component in the developed disk is rathereccentric with the mean eccentricity of $\sim$ 0.5. these results imply thatthe m31's nuclear eccentric disk proposed by tremaine (1995) can be formed bymerging between a central massive black hole and a compact stellar system. wefurthermore discuss when and how a compact stellar system is transferred intothe nuclear region around a massive black hole.

astro-ph;0106401	tidal truncation of gas replenishment and global suppression of galactic  star formation in distant clusters	recent spectroscopic observations of galaxies in distant clusters haverevealed that the rate of star formation in star-forming galaxies issignificantly suppressed with respect to their counterparts in the field at asimilar redshift. it is, however, highly uncertain which physical processes areresponsible for this suppression. we present the results of a numericalinvestigation of how the global tidal field of a cluster dynamically influencesthe reservoir of halo gas surrounding a disk galaxy as it falls into thecluster from the surrounding field. we find that the tidal field of the clusterefficiently removes the halo gas from the galaxy, thereby halting its accretiononto the disk, and thus the fueling of star formation within. this effectivelytruncates the galaxy's star formation. we also find that this tidal truncationdoes not depend very strongly on the orbit of the disk with respect to thecenter of the cluster.  these results suggest that the global tidal field of clusters is capable ofcausing a widespread and uniform suppression of star formation in galaxiesaccreted by the cluster. in light of these results, we discuss the importanceof this tidal truncation of the gas supply in the formation of s0 galaxies inclusters.

astro-ph;0106402	galaxy threshing and the formation of ultra-compact dwarf galaxies	recent spectroscopic and morphological observational studies of galaxiesaround ngc 1399 in the fornax cluster (drinkwater et al. 2000b) have discoveredseveral `ultra-compact dwarf' galaxies with intrinsic sizes of $\sim$ 100 pcand absolute $b$ band magnitudes ranging from -13 to -11 mag. in order toelucidate the origin of these enigmatic objects, we perform numericalsimulations on the dynamical evolution of nucleated dwarf galaxies orbiting ngc1399 and suffering from its strong tidal gravitational field. adopting aplausible scaling relation for dwarf galaxies, we find that the outer stellarcomponents of a nucleated dwarf are totally removed. this is due to them beingtidally stripped over the course of several passages past the central region ofngc 1399. the nucleus, however, manages to survive. we also find that the sizeand luminosity of the remnant are similar to those observed for ultra-compactdwarf galaxies, if the simulated precursor nucleated dwarf has a mass of $\sim$$10^8$ $m_{\odot}$. these results suggest that ultra-compact dwarf galaxiescould have previously been more luminous dwarf spheroidal or ellipticalgalaxies with rather compact nuclei.

astro-ph;0106403	spectroscopic evolution of dusty starburst galaxies	by using a one-zone chemical and spectrophotometric evolution model of a diskgalaxy undergoing a dusty starburst, we investigate, numerically, the opticalspectroscopic properties in order to explore galaxy evolution in distantclusters. we adopt an assumption that the degree of dust extinction(represented by $a_v$) depends on the ages of starburst populations in such away that younger stars have larger $a_v$ (originally referred to as selectivedust extinction by poggianti &amp; wu 2000). in particular, we investigate how thetime evolution of the equivalent widths of [oii]$\lambda$3727 and h$\delta$ iscontrolled by the adopted age dependence. this leads to three main results: (1)if a young stellar population (with the age of $\sim$ $10^6$ yr) is moreheavily obscured by dust than an old one ($&gt;$ $10^8$ yr), the galaxy can showan ``e(a)'' spectrum characterized by strong h$\delta$ absorption andrelatively modest [oii] emission. (2) a dusty starburst galaxy with an e(a)spectrum can evolve into a poststarburst galaxy with an a+k (or k+a) spectrum0.2 gyr after the starburst and then into a passive one with a k-type spectrum1 gyr after the starburst. this result clearly demonstrates an evolutionarylink between galaxies with different spectral classes (i.e., e(b), e(a), a+k,k+a, and k). (3) a dusty starburst galaxy can show an a+k or k+a spectrum evenin the dusty starburst phase if the age-dependence of dust extinction is ratherweak, i.e., if young starburst populations with different ages ($\le$ $10^7$yr) are uniformly obscured by dust.

astro-ph;0106523	formation of the galactic stellar halo i. structure and kinematics	we perform numerical simulations for the formation of the galactic stellarhalo, based on the currently favored cold dark matter (cdm) theory of galaxyformation. our numerical models, taking into account both dynamical andchemical evolution processes in a consistent manner, are aimed at explainingobserved structure and kinematics of the stellar halo in the context ofhierarchical galaxy formation. the main results of the present simulations aresummarized as follows. (1) basic physical processes involved in the formationof the stellar halo, composed of metal-deficient stars with [fe/h] $\le$ -1.0,are described by both dissipative and dissipationless merging of subgalacticclumps and their resultant tidal disruption in the course of gravitationalcontraction of the galaxy at high redshift ($z$ $&gt;$ 1). (2) the simulated halohas the density profile similar to the observed power-law form of $\rho (r)$$\sim$ $r^{-3.5}$, and has also the similar metallicity distribution to theobservations. the halo virtually shows no radial gradient for stellar ages andonly small gradient for metallicities. (3) the dual nature of the halo, i.e.,its inner flattened and outer spherical density distribution, is reproduced, atleast qualitatively, by the present model. the outer spherical halo is formedvia essentially dissipationless merging of small subgalactic clumps, whereasthe inner flattened one is formed via three different mechanisms, i.e.,dissipative merging between larger, more massive clumps, adiabatic contractiondue to the growing galactic disk, and gaseous accretion onto the equatorialplane.

astro-ph;0107117	a new formation model for m32: a threshed early-type spiral?	the origin of the closest compact elliptical galaxy (ce) m32 is alongstanding problem of galaxy formation in the local group. our n-body/sphsimulations suggest a new scenario in which the strong tidal field of m31 cantransform a spiral galaxy into a compact elliptical. as a low luminosity spiralgalaxy plunges into the central region of m31, most of the outer stellar andgaseous components of its disk are dramatically stripped due to m31's tidalfield the central bulge component, on the other hand, is just weakly influencedby the tidal field owing to its compact configuration, and retains itsmorphology. m31's strong tidal field also induces rapid gas transfer to thecentral region, triggers a nuclear starburst, and consequently forms thecentral high density and more metal-rich stellar populations with relativelyyoung ages. thus, in this scenario, m32 was previously the bulge of a spiraltidally interacting with m31 several gyr ago. furthermore, we suggest ces likem32 are rare, the result of both the rather narrow parameter space for tidalinteractions which morphologically transform spirals into ces and the veryshort time scale ($&lt;$ a few $10^9$ yr) for ces to be swallowed.

astro-ph;0202269	formation of the galactic disk globular clusters in early dissipative  minor merging	the origin of metal-rich, highly flattened, and rapidly rotating diskglobular cluster system in the galaxy is one of longstanding issues in thecontext of the galaxy formation. our numerical simulations suggest a new``two-fold'' scenario that the disk globular clusters are firstly formed in thehigh-pressure, dense central region of a gas-rich dwarf galaxy, as inducedduring the tidal interaction with the pre-existing, young thin disk of thegalaxy, and then dispersed into the disk region owing to the final tidaldestruction of the merging dwarf. we also demonstrate that spatialdistribution, total number, and metallicity distribution of the clusters formedin this minor merging depend on the mass ratio of the host to dwarf galaxy andthe orbital configuration of merging. based on these results, we discusswhether a minor merging event about 10 gyr ago can explain both the galacticthick disk and the disk globular clusters. several other implications for thepossible relation between the properties of disk galaxies and their diskglobular clusters are also discussed.

astro-ph;0202291	spectrophotometric evolution of spiral galaxies with truncated star  formation: an evolutionary link between spirals and s0s in distant clusters	a one-zone chemo-spectro-photometric model is used to investigate the timeevolution of disk galaxies whose star formation is truncated, and to determinethe dependence of this evolution on the previous star formation history and thetruncation epoch. truncated spirals show red colors $\sim 1$ gyr aftertruncation, and evolve spectrally from an e(b) type, down through the e(a),a+k, and k+a classes, to finally become a k type. the exact behavior in thisphase depends on the truncation epoch and the star formation history prior totruncation. for example, earlier type disks show redder colors and do not showa+k-type spectra after truncation of star formation. we also discuss a possibleevolutionary link between the k-type galaxies with spiral morphology found indistant clusters, and present-day s0s, by investigating whether truncatedspirals reproduce the infrared color-magnitude relation of coma galaxies. wesuggest that only less luminous, later-type disk galaxies whose star formationis truncated at intermediate and high redshifts can reproduce the red $i-k$colors observed for s0s in the coma cluster.

astro-ph;0206207	passive spiral formation from halo gas starvation: gradual  transformation into s0s	recent spectroscopic and high resolution $hst$-imaging observations haverevealed significant numbers of ``passive'' spiral galaxies in distantclusters, with all the morphological hallmarks of a spiral galaxy (inparticular, spiral arm structure), but with weak or absent star formation.exactly how such spiral galaxies formed and whether they are the progenitors ofpresent-day s0 galaxies is unclear. based on analytic arguments and numericalsimulations of the hydrodynamical evolution of a spiral galaxy's halo gas(which is a likely candidate for the source of gas replenishment for starformation in spirals), we show that the origin of passive spirals may well beassociated with halo gas stripping. such stripping results mainly from thehydrodynamical interaction between the halo gas and the hot intracluster gas.our numerical simulations demonstrate that even if a spiral orbits a clusterwith a pericenter distance $\sim$ 3 times larger than the cluster core radius,$\sim$ 80 % of the halo gas is stripped within a few gyr and, accordingly,cannot be accreted by the spiral. furthermore, our study demonstrates that thisdramatic decline in the gaseous infall rate leads to a steady increase in the$q$ parameter for the disk, with the spiral arm structure, although persisting,becoming less pronounced as the star formation rate gradually decreases. theseresults suggest that passive spirals formed in this way, gradually evolve intored cluster s0s.

astro-ph;0212545	origin of the metallicity distribution of the ngc 5128 stellar halo	recent {\it hubble space telescope} photometry in the nearby ellipticalgalaxy ngc 5128 shows that its halo field star population is dominated bymoderately metal-rich stars, with a peak at [m/h] $\simeq$ -0.4 and with a verysmall fraction of metal-poor ([m/h] $&lt;$ -1.0) stars. in order to investigatethe physical processes which may have produced this metallicity distributionfunction (mdf), we consider a model in which ngc 5128 is formed by merging oftwo major spiral galaxies. we find that the halo of an elliptical formed thisway is predominantly populated by moderately metal-rich stars with [m/h] $\sim$-0.4 which were initially within the outer parts of the two merging discs andwere tidally stripped during the merger. to match the ngc 5128 data, we findthat the progenitor spiral discs must have rather steep metallicity gradientssimilar to the one defined by the milky way open clusters, as well as sparsemetal-poor haloes (5% or less of the disc mass). very few stars from thecentral bulges of the spiral galaxies end up in the halo, so the results arenot sensitive to the relative sizes (bulge-to-disc ratios) or metallicities ofthe initial bulges. finally, we discuss the effects on the globular clustersystem (gcs). the emergent elliptical will end up with metal-poor halo clustersfrom the original spiral haloes, but with moderately metal-rich halo stars fromthe progenitor discs, thus creating a mean offset between the mdfs of the halostars and the gcs.

astro-ph;0308264	starbursts from strong compression of galactic molecular clouds due to  the high pressure of the intracluster medium	we demonstrate that the high pressure of the hot intracluster medium (icm)can trigger the collapse of molecular clouds in a spiral galaxy, leading to aburst of star formation in the clouds. our hydrodynamical simulations show thatthe high gaseous (ram pressure and static thermal) pressure of the icm stronglycompresses a self-gravitating gas cloud within a short time scale ($\sim$$10^{7}$ yr), dramatically increasing the central gas density, and consequentlycausing efficient star formation within the cloud. the stars developed in thecloud form a compact, gravitationally bound, star cluster. the star formationefficiency within such a cloud is found to depend on the temperature and thedensity of the icm and the relative velocity of the galaxy with respect to it.based on these results, we discuss the origin of starburst/poststarburstpopulations observed in distant clusters, the enhancement of star formation forgalaxies in merging clusters, and the isolated compact hii regions recentlydiscovered in the virgo cluster.

astro-ph;0401229	formation of giant globular cluster g1 and the origin of the m31 stellar  halo	we first demonstrate that globular cluster g1 could have been formed by tidalinteraction between m31 and a nucleated dwarf galaxy (de,n). our fullyself-consistent numerical simulations show that during tidal interactionbetween m31 and g1's progenitor de,n with $m_{\rm b}$ $\sim$ -15 mag and itsnucleus mass of $\sim$ $10^7$ $m_{\odot}$, the dark matter and the outerstellar envelope of the de,n are nearly completely stripped whereas the nucleuscan survive the tidal stripping because of its initially compact nature. thenaked nucleus (i.e., g1) has orbital properties similar to those of itsprogenitor de,n. the stripped stars form a metal-poor ([fe/h] $\sim$ -1)stellar halo around m31 and its structure and kinematics depend strongly on theinitial orbit of g1's progenitor de,n. we suggest that the observed largeprojected distance of g1 from m31 ($\sim$ 40 kpc) can give some strongconstraints on the central density of the dark matter halo of de,n. we discussthese results in the context of substructures of m31's stellar halo recentlyrevealed by ferguson et al.

astro-ph;0406442	cluster cannibalism and scaling relations of galactic stellar nuclei	recently, very massive compact stellar systems have been discovered in theintracluster regions of galaxy clusters and in the nuclear regions of late-typedisk galaxies. it is unclear how these compact stellar systems -- known as``ultra-compact dwarf'' (ucd) galaxies or ``nuclear clusters'' (ncs) -- formand evolve. by adopting a formation scenario where these stellar systems arethe product of multiple merging of star clusters in the central regions ofgalaxies, we investigate, numerically, their physical properties. we find thatphysical correlations between velocity dispersion, luminosity, effectiveradius, and average surface brightness in the stellar merger remnants are quitedifferent from those observed in globular clusters. we also find that theremnants have triaxial shapes with or without figure rotation, and these shapesand their kinematics depend strongly on the initial number and distribution ofthe progenitor clusters. these specific predictions can be compared with thecorresponding results of ongoing and future observations of ucds and ncs,thereby providing a better understanding of the origin of these enigmaticobjects.

astro-ph;0408536	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: the local e+a galaxy population	we select a sample of low-redshift (z ~ 0.1) e+a galaxies from the 2df galaxyredshift survey (2dfgrs). the spectra of these objects are defined by stronghydrogen balmer absorption lines (h-delta, h-gamma, h-beta) combined with alack of [oii] 3727a emission, together implying a recently-truncated burst ofstar formation. the e+a spectrum is thus a signpost to galaxies in the processof evolution. we quantify the local environments, clustering properties andluminosity function of the e+a galaxies. we find that the environments areconsistent with the ensemble of 2dfgrs galaxies: low-redshift e+a systems arelocated predominantly in the field, existing as isolated objects or in poorgroups. however, the luminosity distribution of galaxies selected using threebalmer absorption lines h-delta-gamma-beta appears more typical of ellipticals.indeed, morphologically these galaxies are preferentially spheroidal (e/s0)systems. in a small but significant number we find evidence for recent majormergers, such as tidal tails. we infer that major mergers are one importantformation mechanism for e+a galaxies, as suggested by previous studies. at lowredshift the merger probability is high in the field and low in clusters, thusthese recently-formed spheroidal systems do not follow the usualmorphology-density relation for ellipticals. regarding the selection of e+agalaxies: we find that basing the balmer-line criterion solely on h-deltaabsorption leads to a significant sub-population of disk systems withdetectable h-alpha emission. in these objects the [oii] emission is presumablyeither obscured by dust or present with a low signal-to-noise ratio, whilst the(h-gamma, h-beta) absorption features are subject to emission-filling.

astro-ph;0505548	fossil records of cosmic reionization in galactic stellar halos	galactic stellar halos have long been considered to contain fossilinformation on early dynamical and chemical evolution of galaxies. we proposethat the surface brightness distributions of old stellar halos contain theinfluence of reionization on early formation histories of galaxies. by assumingthat reionization significantly suppresses star formation in small subgalacticclumps virialized after reionization redshift ($z_{\rm reion}$), we firstnumerically investigate how structural and kinematical properties of stellarhalos formed from merging of these subgalactic clumps depend on $z_{\rmreion}$. we then discuss what observable properties of galactic stellar halosoffer us the fossil records of reionization influence on hierarchical formationof halos based on the current results of numerical simulations. we particularlysuggest that both the half-light radius of stellar halos and the slope of theirsurface brightness profile contain useful information on when star formation insubgalactic clumps were significantly influenced by reionization. by using thesimulated surface brightness distributions of galactic stellar halos for modelswith different $z_{\rm reion}$, we also discuss how wide-field imaging studiesof extragalactic halos will help us to elucidate the epoch of cosmicreionization.

astro-ph;0506529	the galactic globular cluster system as a fossil record of reionization	we propose that structural, kinematical, and chemical properties of thegalactic globular clusters (gcs) can contain fossil information of the cosmicreionization history. we first summarize possible observational evidences forthe influence of reionization on the galactic gc formation. we then show howstructural properties of the gc system (gcs) in the galaxy can be influenced bysuppression of gc formation due to reionization during the galaxy formationthrough hierarchical merging of subgalactic clumps, by using numericalsimulations with and without suppression of gc formation by reionization. inparticular, we show that if gc formation in dwarf galaxies that are buildingblocks of the galaxy and virialized after reionization era ($z_{reion}$) arecompletely suppressed, the present-day radial distribution of the galactic gcsdepends strongly on $z_{reion}$. our numerical results imply that if gcformation after $z_{reion}$ $\sim$ 15 is strongly suppressed, the origin of theobserved structural properties of the galactic gcs can be more naturallyexplained in the framework of the hierarchical clustering scenario.

astro-ph;0509522	on the structure of globular cluster systems in elliptical galaxies	it has long been known that the radial density profiles of globular clustersystems (gcss) in elliptical galaxies vary with the total luminosities of theirhost galaxies. in order to elucidate the origin of this structural non-homologyin gcss, we numerically investigate the structural properties of gcss inelliptical galaxies formed from a sequence of major dissipationless galaxymerging. we find that the radial density profiles of gcss in ellipticalgalaxies become progressively flatter as the galaxies experience more majormerger events. the density profiles of gcss in ellipticals are well describedas power-laws with slopes (${\alpha}_{\rm gc}$) ranging from -2.0 to -1.0. theyare flatter than, and linearly proportional to, the slopes (${\alpha}_{\rm s}$)of the stellar density profiles of their host galaxies. we also find that thegcs core radii ($r_{\rm c}$) of the density profiles are larger in ellipticalsthat experienced more mergers. by applying a reasonable scaling relationbetween luminosities and sizes of galaxies to the simulation results, we showthat ${\alpha}_{\rm gc} \approx -0.36 m_{\rm v}-9.2$, $r_{\rm c} \approx -1.85m_{\rm v}$, and ${\alpha}_{\rm gc} \approx 0.93 {\alpha}_{\rm s}$, where$m_{\rm v}$ is the total $v$-band absolute magnitude of a galaxy.

astro-ph;0512385	the origin of the double main sequence in omega centauri: helium  enrichment due to gas fueling from its ancient host galaxy ?	recent observational studies of $\omega$ centauri by {\it hubble spacetelescope} have discovered a double main sequence in the color magnitudediagrams (cmds) of its stellar populations. the stellar population with theblue main sequence (bms) is observationally suggested to have a heliumabundance much larger, by $\delta y\sim 0.12$, than that of the red mainsequence (rms). by using somewhat idealized models in which stars of the bmsare formed from gas ejected from those of the rms, we quantitativelyinvestigate whether the helium overabundance of the bms can result fromself-enrichment from massive agb stars, from mass loss of very massive youngstars, or from type ii supernovae within $\omega$ cen. we show that as long asthe helium enrichment is due to ejecta from the rms formed earlier than thebms, none of the above three enrichment scenarios can explain the observedproperties of the bms self-consistently for reasonable imfs. the common,serious problem in all cases is that the observed number fraction of the bmscan not be explained without assuming unusually top-heavy imfs. this failure ofthe self-enrichment scenarios implies that most of the helium-enriched gasnecessary for the formation of the bms originated from other external sources.we thus suggest a new scenario that most of the second generation of stars(i.e., the bms) in $\omega$ cen could be formed from gas ejected from fieldstellar populations that surrounded $\omega$ cen when it was a nucleus of anancient dwarf galaxy.

astro-ph;0512386	impact of dark matter subhalos on extended hi disks of galaxies:  possible formation of hi fine structures and stars	recent observations have discovered star formation activities in the extremeouter regions of disk galaxies. however it remains unclear what physicalmechanisms are responsible for triggering star formation in such low-densitygaseous environments of galaxies. in order to understand the origin of theseouter star-forming regions, we numerically investigate how the impact of darkmatter subhalos orbiting a gas-rich disk galaxy embedded in a massive darkmatter halo influences the dynamical evolution of outer hi gas disk of thegalaxy. we find that if the masses of the subhalos ($m_{\rm sb}$) in a galaxywith an extended hi gas disk are as large as $10^{-3} \times m_{\rm h}$, where$m_{\rm h}$ is the total mass of the galaxy's dark halo, local fine structurescan be formed in the extended hi disk. we also find that the gas densities ofsome apparently filamentary structures can exceed a threshold gas density forstar formation and thus be likely to be converted into new stars in the outerpart of the hi disk in some models with larger $m_{\rm sb}$. these results thusimply that the impact of dark matter subhalos (``dark impact'') can beimportant for better understanding the origin of recent star formationdiscovered in the extreme outer regions of disk galaxies. we also suggest thatcharacteristic morphologies of local gaseous structures formed by the darkimpact can indirectly prove the existence of dark matter subhalos in galaxies.we discuss the origin of giant hi holes observed in some gas-rich galaxies(e.g., ngc 6822) in the context of the dark impact.

astro-ph;0512467	primordial pollution of globular clusters within their host dwarfs  embedded in dark matter halos at high redshifts	recent observational studies have revealed star-to-star abundanceinhomogeneity among light elements (e.g., c, n, o, na, and al) of stars on themain sequence in the galactic globular clusters (gcs). one of promisinginterpretations for this result is that the observed abundance inhomogeneity isdue to the second generation of stars formed from ejecta of the firstgeneration of evolved stars (e.g., agb stars) within gcs. however it remainsunclear whether and how this primordial pollution can occur within gcs. we herepropose a new scenario in which primordial pollution of gcs is highly likely tooccur if gcs are located in the central regions of high redshift dark mattersubhalos that can host low-mass dwarf galaxies. in this scenario, gas ejectedfrom the first generation of stars of gcs can be effectively trapped in thedeep gravitational potential of their host halos and consequently can beconsumed for the formation of the second generation of stars without losing asignificant amount of gas by ram pressure stripping of interstellar andintergalactic medium. during merging of these halos with the proto-galaxy, thehalos are completely destroyed owing to the strong tidal field of the galaxy.the self-polluted gcs located initially in the central regions of the halos cansurvive from tidal destruction owing to their compactness and finally becomethe galactic halo gcs. in this scenario, ejecta of field stars surrounding thecentral gcs can be also converted into stars within their host dwarfs andfinally become the second generation of stars of gcs. we also discuss theorigin of the difference in the degree of abundance inhomogeneity betweendifferent gcs, such as $\omega$ centauri and ngc 6752, in terms of thedifference in physical properties between host halos from which gc originate.

astro-ph;0604340	dissipative transformation of non-nucleated dwarf galaxies into  nucleated systems	recent photometric observations by the {\it hubble space telescope (hst)}have revealed the physical properties of stellar galactic nuclei in nucleateddwarf galaxies in the virgo cluster of galaxies. in order to elucidate theformation processes of nucleated dwarfs, we numerically investigate gasdynamics, star formation, and chemical evolution within the central 1 kpc ofgas disks embedded within the galactic stellar components of non-nucleateddwarfs. we find that high density, compact stellar systems can be formed in thecentral regions of dwarfs as a result of dissipative, repeated merging ofmassive stellar and gaseous clumps developed from nuclear gaseous spiral armsas a result of local gravitational instability. the central stellar componentsare found to have stellar masses which are typically $~$5% of their host dwarfsand show very flattened shapes, rotational kinematics, and central velocitydispersions significantly smaller than those of their host dwarfs. we also findthat more massive dwarfs can develop more massive, more metal-rich, and higherdensity stellar systems in their central regions, because star formation andchemical enrichment proceed more efficiently owing to the less dramaticsuppression of star formation by supernovae feedback effects in more massivedwarfs. based on these results, we suggest that gas-rich, non-nucleated dwarfscan be transformed into nucleated ones as a result of dissipative gas dynamicsin their central regions. we discuss the origin of the observed correlationsbetween physical properties of stellar galactic nuclei and those of their hostgalaxies.

astro-ph;0606546	stellar halos and elliptical galaxy formation: origin of dynamical  properties of the planetary nebular systems	recent spectroscopic observations of planetary nebulae (pne) in severalelliptical galaxies have revealed structural and kinematical properties of theouter stellar halo regions. in order to elucidate the origin of the propertiesof these planetary nebula systems (pnss), we consider the merger scenario inwhich an elliptical galaxy is formed by merging of spiral galaxies. usingnumerical simulations, we particularly investigate radial profiles of projectedpne number densities, rotational velocities, and velocity dispersions of pnssextending to the outer halo regions of elliptical galaxies formed from majorand unequal-mass merging. we find that the radial profiles of the projectnumber densities can be fitted to the power-law and the mean number density inthe outer halos of the ellipticals can be more than an order of magnitudehigher than that of the original spiral's halo. the pnss are found to show asignificant amount of rotation (v/sigma &gt;0.5) in the outer halo regions ($r$$&gt;$ $5r_{\rm e}$) of the ellipticals. two-dimensional velocity fields of pnssare derived from the simulations and their dependences on model parameters ofgalaxy merging are discussed in detail. we compare the simulated kinematics ofpnss with that of the pns observed in ngc 5128 and thereby discuss advantagesand disadvantages of the merger model in explaining the observed kinematics ofthe pns. we also find that the kinematics of pnss in elliptical galaxies arequite diverse depending on the orbital configurations of galaxy merging, themass ratio of merger progenitor spirals, and the viewing angle of the galaxies.this variation translates directly into possible biases by a factor of morethan two in observational mass estimation (abridged). ~ ~

astro-ph;0607349	numerical simulations on the relative importance of starbursts and agn  in ultra-luminous infrared galaxies	we investigate the relative importance of starbursts and agn in nuclearactivities of ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) based on chemodynamicalsimulations combined with spectrophotometric synthesis codes. we numericallyinvestigate both the gas accretion rates (m_acc) onto super massive black holes(smbhs) and the star formation rates (m_sf) in ulirgs formed by gas-rich galaxymergers and thereby discuss what powers ulirgs. our principal results, whichcan be tested against observations, are as follows. (1) ulirgs powered by agncan be formed by major merging between luminous, gas-rich disk galaxies withprominent bulges containing smbhs, owing to the efficient gas fuelling m_acc &gt;1 m_sun/yr of the smbh. agn in these ulirgs can be surrounded by compactpoststarburst stellar populations (e.g., a-type stars). (2) ulirgs powered bystarbursts with m_sf ~ 100 m_sun/yr can be formed by merging between gas-richdisk galaxies with small bulges having the bulge-to-disk-ratio (f_b) as smallas 0.1. (3) the relative importance of starbursts and agn can depend onphysical properties of merger progenitor disks, such as f_b, gas mass fraction,and total masses. for example, more massive galaxy mergers are more likely tobecome agn-dominated ulirgs. (4) for most models, major mergers can becomeulirgs, powered either by starbursts or by agn, only when the two bulgesfinally merge. interacting disk galaxies can become ulirgs with well separatedtwo cores (&gt; 20kpc) at their pericenter when they are very massive and havesmall bulges. (5) irrespective of the choice of model, interacting/merginggalaxies show the highest accretion rates onto the central smbhs, and theresultant rapid growth of the smbhs occur when their star formation rates arevery high.

astro-ph;0608238	on spatial distributions of old globular clusters in clusters of  galaxies	we investigate structural properties of old, metal-poor globular clusters(gcs) formed at high redshifts (z&gt;6) and located inside and outside virializedgalaxy-scale halos in clusters of galaxies with the total masses of m_cl basedon high-resolution cosmological simulations with models of gc formation. wemainly derive the parameter dependences of physical properties of intraclustergcs (icgcs) based on the results of 14 models. our principle results aresummarized as follows. (1) the projected radial density profiles (sigma_gc) oficgcs in clusters with different m_cl can be diverse, though icgcs haveinhomogeneous, asymmetric, and somewhat elongated distributions in most models.if sigma_gc (r) ~ r^alpha, alpha ranges from -1.5 to -2.5 for gcs in clusters.(2) although total number of gcs within the central 0.05 mpc (n_gc,0.05) and0.2 mpc (n_gc,0.2) are diverse in different clusters, they can depend weakly onm_cl in such a way that both n_gc,0.05 and n_gc,0.2 are likely to be larger forclusters with larger m_cl. (3) total number of gcs per cluster masses (specificfrequency of gcs for clusters of galaxies) are more likely to be larger in moremassive clusters, mainly because a larger number of earlier virialized objectscan be located in more massive clusters. (4) spatial distributions of old gcsin clusters can depend on the truncation epoch of gc formation (z_trun) suchthat they can be steeper and more compact in the models with higher z_trun. (5)the mean metallicity of icgcs in a cluster can be smaller than that of gcswithin the cluster member galaxy-scale halos by ~ 0.3 in [fe/h]. metallicitydistribution functions (mdfs) of icgcs show peak values around [fe/h] ~ -1.6and do not have remarkable bimodality.

astro-ph;0609470	triggered star formation in the magellanic clouds	we discuss how tidal interaction between the large magellanic cloud (lmc),the small magellanic cloud (smc), and the galaxy triggers galaxy-wide starformation in the clouds for the last ~0.2 gyr based on our chemodynamicalsimulations on the clouds. our simulations demonstrate that the tidalinteraction induces the formation of asymmetric spiral arms with high gasdensities and consequently triggers star formation within the arms in the lmc.star formation rate in the present lmc is significantly enhanced just above theeastern edge of the lmc's stellar bar owing to the tidal interaction. thelocation of the enhanced star formation is very similar to the observedlocation of 30 doradus, which suggests that the formation of 30 doradus isclosely associated with the last magellanic collision about 0.2 gyr ago. thetidal interaction can dramatically compress gas initially within the outer partof the smc so that new stars can be formed from the gas to become intergalacticyoung stars in the inter-cloud region (e.g., the magellanic bridge). themetallicity distribution function of the newly formed stars in the magellanicbridge has a peak of [fe/h] ~ -0.8, which is significantly lower than thestellar metallicity of the smc.

astro-ph;9804182	formation of metal-poor gaseous halo in gas-rich galaxy mergers	we numerically investigate chemodynamical evolution of interstellar medium(ism) in gas-rich disk-disk galaxy mergers in order to explore the origin offundamental chemical properties of halo ism observed in elliptical galaxies.main results obtained in this chemodynamical study are the following three. (1)elliptical galaxies formed by gas-rich mergers show steep negative metallicitygradients of ism especially in the outer part of galaxies. the essential reasonfor this is that chemical evolution of ism in mergers proceeds in such aninhomogeneous way that in the central part of mergers, metal-enrichment of ismis more efficient owing to radial inflow of metal-enriched ism duringdissipative galaxy merging, whereas in the outer part, metal-enrichment is lessefficient owing to a larger amount of metal-enriched ism tidally stripped awayfrom mergers. this result provides a clue to the origin of gaseous metallicitygradients of elliptical halo recently revealed by asca. (2) because ofinhomogeneous chemical evolution of ism in mergers, some merger remnants showmean gaseous metallicity discernibly smaller than mean stellar one. the degreeof difference in mean stellar and gaseous metallicity in a merger remnantdepends on chemical mixing length, galactic mass, and the effectiveness ofsupernova feedback. (3) elliptical galaxies formed by multiple mergers are morelikely to have metal-poor gaseous halo components and steep gaseous metallicitygradients than those formed by pair mergers. this is principally because alarger amount of less-metal enriched ism can be tidally stripped away moreefficiently from galaxies in multiple mergers.

astro-ph;9804221	tightness of the color-magnitude relation of elliptical galaxies and the  epoch of major galaxy merging	we investigate a one-zone chemophotometric evolution model of disk-diskgalaxy mergers in order to clarify whether or not galaxy mergers with thewidely spread merging epoch can reproduce reasonably well the observed smallscatter of the color-magnitude (c-m) relation in cluster ellipticals at low andintermediate redshift (z&lt;1). we consider that merger progenitor disks begin toconsume interstellar gas at moderate rate from z ~ 5 and then merge to form anelliptical with the secondary starburst at z=z_merge. we find that even if theepoch of galaxy merging is rather extended (0.3&lt;z_merge&lt;3.0), the dispersion inthe rest-frame u-v color among galaxy mergers is well within the observed one(~0.05 mag at z = 0). we also find that the z_merge is required to be within acertain range to keep the observed c-m relation tight at a given z. forexample, the required range of z_merge in galaxy mergers between sa disks is1.3&lt;z_merge&lt;3.0 for cluster ellipticals at z = 0.895, 0.9&lt;z_merge&lt;3.0 for z =0.55, and 0.3&lt;z_merge&lt;3.0 for z = 0. the main reason for the derived smallscatter is that younger stellar populations, which are formed during thesecondary starburst of galaxy mergers, are formed preferentially from moremetal-enriched interstellar gas. this result reinforces the worthey'ssuggestion (worthey et al. 1996) that the age-metallicity conspiracy, whichmeans that younger stellar populations are preferentially more metal-enriched,can operate to keep the tight c-m relation. these numerical results imply thatthe observed small scatter in the c-m relation at low and intermediate redshift(z &lt; 1) does not necessarily require the coevality of elliptical galaxies inclusters or their formation at high z, which has been conventionally believedin the classical passive evolution picture.

(2) the absolute magnitude of negative metallicitygradients developed in galaxy mergers is more likely to be larger for massiveellipticals.  absolute magnitude of metallicity gradient correlates with that of agegradient in ellipticals in the sense that an elliptical with steeper negativemetallicity gradient is more likely to show steeper age gradient. (3) bothm/l_b and m/l_k, where m, l_b, and l_k are total stellar mass of galaxymergers, b-band luminosity, and k-band one, respectively, depend on galacticmass in such a way that more massive ellipticals have larger m/l_b and smallerm/l_k.

0811.3279	formation of the off-center bar in the large magellanic cloud: a  collision with a dark satellite ?	recent observations on structural properties of the large magellanic cloud(lmc) based on the deep near-infrared southern sky survey (denis) and twomicron all-sky survey (2mass) have revealed that the lmc has an off-center bareven in the older stellar populations. previous dynamical models includingtidal interaction between the lmc, the small magellanic cloud (smc), and thegalaxy, however, did not reproduce so well the older off-center bar. we hereshow that the off-center bar can be formed if the lmc with an already existingbar can collide with a low-mass galactic subhalo as massive as 5 * 10^8 m_sun(corresponding roughly to a few % of the lmc mass). the simulated stellardistribution after the collision appears to show an ``off-center bar'', notbecause the center of the bar significantly deviates from the dynamical centerof the lmc, but because the underlying stellar distribution of the disk issignificantly asymmetric with respect to the center of the bar. we discusswhether off-center bars observed in magellanic-type dwarf galaxies can beformed as a result of tidal interaction with low-mass halos with no or littlevisible matters.
