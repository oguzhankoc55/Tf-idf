0904.3752	phase transitions and he-synthesis driven winds in neutrino cooled  accretion disks: prospects for late flares in short gamma-ray bursts	we consider the long term evolution of debris following the tidal disruptionof compact stars in the context of short gamma ray bursts (sgrbs). the initialencounter impulsively creates a hot, dense, neutrino-cooled disk capable ofpowering the prompt emission. after a long delay, we find that powerful windsare launched from the surface of the disk, driven by the recombination of freenucleons into alpha particles. the associated energy release depletes the masssupply and eventually shuts off activity of the central engine. as a result,the luminosity and mass accretion rate deviate from the earlier self-similarbehavior expected for an isolated ring with efficient cooling. this thenenables a secondary episode of delayed activity to become prominent as anobservable signature, when material in the tidal tails produced by the initialencounter returns to the vicinity of the central object. the time scale of thenew accretion event can reach tens of seconds to minutes, depending on thedetails of the system. the associated energies and time scales are consistentwith those occurring in x-ray flares.

0908.0030	limits on radioactive-powered emission associated with a short-hard grb  070724a in a star-forming galaxy	we present results of an extensive observing campaign of the short duration,hard spectrum gamma-ray burst (grb) 070724a, aimed at detecting theradioactively-powered emission that might follow from a binary merger orcollapse involving compact objects. our multi-band observations span the rangein time over which this so-called li-paczynski mini-supernova could be active,beginning within 3 hours of the grb trigger, and represent some of the deepestand most comprehensive searches for such emission. we find no evidence for suchactivity and place limits on the abundances and the lifetimes of the possibleradioactive nuclides that could form in the rapid decompression ofnuclear-density matter. furthermore, our limits are significantly fainter thanthe peak magnitude of any previously detected broad-lined type ic supernova(sn) associated with other grbs, effectively ruling out a long grb-like sn forwith this event. given the unambiguous redshift of the host galaxy (z=0.456),grb 070724a represents one of a small, but growing, number of short-hard grbsfor which firm physical/restframe quantities currently exist. the host of grb070724a is a moderately star-forming galaxy with an older stellar populationcomponent and a relatively high metallicity of 12+log(o/h)_kd02=9.1. we find nosignificant evidence for large amounts of extinction along the line of sightthat could mask the presence of a sn explosion and estimate a small probabilityfor chance alignment with the putative host. we discuss how our derivedconstraints fit into the evolving picture of short-hard grbs, their potentialprogenitors, and the host environments in which they are thought to beproduced.

0909.2884	short gamma-ray bursts from dynamically-assembled compact binaries in  globular clusters: pathways, rates, hydrodynamics and cosmological setting	we present a detailed assessment of the dynamical pathways leading to thecoalescence of compact objects in globular clusters (gcs) and short gamma-rayburst (sgrb) production. we consider primordial binaries, dynamically formedbinaries (through tidal two-body and three-body exchange interactions) anddirect impacts of compact objects (wd/ns/bh). we show that if the primordialbinary fraction is small, close encounters dominate the production rate ofcoalescing compact systems. we find that the two dominant channels are theinteraction of field nss with dynamically formed binaries, and two-bodyencounters. we then estimate the redshift distribution and host galaxydemographics of sgrb progenitors, and find that gcs can provide a significantcontribution to the overall observed rate.  we have carried out hydrodynamical modeling of evolution of close stellarencounters with wd/ns/bh, and show that there is no problem in accounting forthe energy budget of a typical sgrb. the particulars of each encounter arevariable and lead to interesting diversity: the encounter characteristics aredependent on the impact parameter, in contrast to the merger scenario; thenature of the compact star itself can produce very different outcomes; thepresence of tidal tails in which material falls back onto the central object atlater times is a robust feature of these calculations, with the mass involvedbeing larger than for binary mergers. it is thus possible to accountgenerically in this scenario for a prompt episode of energy release, as well asfor activity many dynamical time scales later (abridged).

0910.1593	halo retention and evolution of coalescing compact binaries in  cosmological simulations of structure formation: implications for short  gamma-ray bursts	merging compact binaries are the one source of gravitational radiation so faridentified. because short-period systems which will merge in less than a hubbletime have already been observed as binary pulsars, they are important both asgravitational wave sources for observatories such as ligo but also asprogenitors for short gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs). the fact that these systemsmust have large systemic velocities implies that by the time they merge, theywill be far from their formation site. the locations of merging sites dependsensitively on the gravitational potential of the galaxy host, which until nowhas been assumed to be static. here we refine such calculations to incorporatethe temporal evolution of the host's gravitational potential as well as that ofits nearby neighbors using cosmological simulations of structure formation.this results in merger site distributions that are more diffusively distributedwith respect to their putative hosts, with locations extending out to distancesof a few mpc for lighter halos. the degree of mixing between neighboringcompact binary populations computed in this way is severely enhanced inenvironments with a high number density of galaxies. we find that sgrb redshiftestimates based solely on the nearest galaxy in projection can be veryinaccurate, if progenitor systems inhere large systematic kicks at birth.

0911.0416	surface detonations in double degenerate binary systems triggered by  accretion stream instabilities	we present three-dimensional simulations on a new mechanism for thedetonation of a sub-chandrasekhar co white dwarf in a dynamically unstablesystem where the secondary is either a pure he white dwarf or a he/co hybrid.for dynamically unstable systems where the accretion stream directly impactsthe surface of the primary, the final tens of orbits can have mass accretionrates that range from $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-3} m_{\odot}$ s$^{-1}$, leading to therapid accumulation of helium on the surface of the primary. after $\sim10^{-2}$ $m_{\odot}$ of helium has been accreted, the ram pressure of the hothelium torus can deflect the accretion stream such that the stream no longerdirectly impacts the surface. the velocity difference between the stream andthe torus produces shearing which seeds large-scale kelvin-helmholtzinstabilities along the interface between the two regions. these instabilitieseventually grow into dense knots of material that periodically strike thesurface of the primary, adiabatically compressing the underlying helium torus.if the temperature of the compressed material is raised above a criticaltemperature, the timescale for triple-$\alpha$ reactions becomes comparable tothe dynamical timescale, leading to the detonation of the primary's heliumenvelope. this detonation drives shockwaves into the primary which tend toconcentrate at one or more focal points within the primary's co core. if arelatively small amount of mass is raised above a critical temperature anddensity at these focal points, the co core may itself be detonated.

0911.5358	optical transients from the unbound debris of tidal disruption	in the tidal disruption of a star by a black hole, roughly half of thestellar mass becomes bound and falls into the black hole, while the other halfis ejected at high velocity. several previous studies have considered theemission resulting from the accretion of bound material; we consider thepossibility that the unbound debris may also radiate once it has expanded andbecome transparent. we show that the gradual energy input from hydrogenrecombination compensates for adiabatic loses over significant expansionfactors. the opacity also drops dramatically with recombination, and theinternal energy can be radiated by means of a cooling-transparency wavepropagating from the surface layers inward. the result is a brief opticaltransient occurring ~1 week after disruption and lasting 3-5 days with peakluminosities of 10^40-10^42 ergs/s, depending on the mass of the disruptedstar. these recombination powered transients should accompany thex-ray/ultraviolet flare from the accretion of bound material, and so may be auseful signature for discriminating tidal disruption events, especially forlower and intermediate mass black holes.

1006.3897	local absorption of high-energy emission from gamma-ray bursts	high-energy photons emitted from gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are subject topair-production interactions with lower energy photons, leading to an effectiveoptical depth. in this letter, we estimate the opacity resulting from photonfields located at various distances from long grb sites: that of the binarycompanion to the massive stellar progenitor, that of the star-forming molecularcloud containing the grb, and the total photon field of the host galaxy. thefirst two photon fields are found to be transparent for most reasonable sets ofassumptions about these systems. in the case of galactic radiation fields, wehave performed several numerical simulations to calculate the expectedopacities for different line-of-sight geometries through the host galaxy, andinclude a full accounting of the infrared radiation produced by the absorptionand re-radiation of starlight by dust. the optical depth for gev gamma-rays,due to direct starlight is less than unity for all host galaxies. at higherenergies, $&gt;$10 tev, a spectral cutoff can occur due to the rapidly increasingnumber of mid- to far-ir intra-galactic photons reradiated by dust. photons inthe extragalactic background light therefore remain the only relevant source ofphoton-photon opacity for ongoing grb observations with fermi lat, andpotential future detections with ground-based gamma-ray telescopes.

1008.2383	what drives the expansion of giant hii regions?: a study of stellar  feedback in 30 doradus	observations show that star formation is an inefficient and slow process.this result can be attributed to the injection of energy and momentum by starsthat prevents free-fall collapse of molecular clouds. the mechanism of thisstellar feedback is debated theoretically: possible sources of pressure includethe classical warm hii gas, the hot gas generated by shock-heating from stellarwinds and supernovae, direct radiation of stars, and the dust-processedradiation field trapped inside the hii shell. in this paper, we measureobservationally the pressures associated with each component listed aboveacross the giant hii region 30 doradus in the large magellanic cloud. weexploit high-resolution, multi-wavelengh images (radio, infrared, optical, andx-ray) to map these pressures as a function of position. we find that radiationpressure dominates within 75 pc of the central star cluster, r136, while thehii gas pressure dominates at larger radii. by contrast, the dust-processedradiation pressure and hot gas pressure are generally weak and not dynamicallyimportant, although the hot gas pressure may have played a more significantrole at early times. based on the low x-ray gas pressures, we demonstrate thatthe hot gas is only partially confined and must be leaking out the hii shell.additionally, we consider the implications of a dominant radiation pressure onthe early dynamics of 30 doradus.

1011.0731	using the x-ray morphologies of young supernova remnants to constrain  explosion type, ejecta distribution, and chemical mixing	supernova remnants (snrs) are a complex class of sources, and theirheterogeneous nature has hindered the characterization of their generalobservational properties. to overcome this challenge, we use statistical toolsto analyze the chandra x-ray images of galactic and large magellanic cloudsnrs. we apply two techniques, a power-ratio method (a multipole expansion) andwavelet-transform analysis, to measure the global and local morphologicalproperties of the x-ray line and thermal emission in twenty-four snrs. we findthat type ia snrs have statistically more spherical and mirror symmetricthermal x-ray emission than core-collapse (cc) snrs. the ability to type snrsbased on thermal emission morphology alone enables, for the first time, thetyping of snrs with weak x-ray lines or with low-resolution spectra. weidentify one source, snr g344.7-0.1, as originating from a cc explosion thatwas previously unknown, and we confirm the tentative type ia classifications ofg337.2-0.7 and g272.2-3.2. although the global morphology is indicative of theexplosion type, the relative morphology of the x-ray line emission within snrsis not: all sources in our sample have well-mixed ejecta, irrespective ofstellar origin. in particular, we find that 90% of the bright metal-lineemitting substructures are spatially coincident and have similar scales, evenif the metals arise from different burning processes. moreover, the overallx-ray line morphologies within each snr are the same, with &lt;6% differences.these findings reinforce that hydrodynamical instabilities can efficiently mixejecta in type ia and cc snrs. the only exception is w49b, which is likely fromits jet-driven/bipolar sn explosion. finally, we describe observationalconstraints that can be used to test hydrodynamical models of snr evolution;notably, the filling factor of x-ray emission decreases with snr age.

1011.1256	the distribution of coalescing compact binaries in the local universe:  prospects for gravitational-wave observations	merging compact binaries are the most viable and best studied candidates forgravitational wave (gw) detection by the fully operational network ofground-based observatories. in anticipation of the first detections, theexpected distribution of gw sources in the local universe is of considerableinterest. here we investigate the full phase space distribution of coalescingcompact binaries at $z = 0$ using dark matter simulations of structureformation. the fact that these binary systems acquire large barycentricvelocities at birth ("kicks") results in merger site distributions that aremore diffusely distributed with respect to their putative hosts, with mergersoccurring out to distances of a few mpc from the host halo. redshift estimatesbased solely on the nearest galaxy in projection can, as a result, beinaccurate. on the other hand, large offsets from the host galaxy could aid thedetection of faint optical counterparts and should be considered when designingstrategies for follow-up observations. the degree of isotropy in the projectedsky distributions of gw sources is found to be augmented with increasing kickvelocity and to be severely enhanced if progenitor systems possess large kicksas inferred from the known population of pulsars and double compact binaries.even in the absence of observed electromagnetic counterparts, the differencesin sky distributions of binaries produced by disparate kick-velocity modelscould be discerned by gw observatories, within the expected accuracies anddetection rates of advanced ligo--in particular with the addition of moreinterferometers.

1012.2382	consequences of the ejection and disruption of giant planets	the discovery of jupiter-mass planets in close orbits about their parentstars has challenged models of planet formation. recent observations have shownthat a number of these planets have highly inclined, sometimes retrogradeorbits about their parent stars, prompting much speculation as to their origin.it is known that migration alone cannot account for the observed population ofthese misaligned hot jupiters, which suggests that dynamical processes afterthe gas disc dissipates play a substantial role in yielding the observedinclination and eccentricity distributions. one particularly promisingcandidate is planet-planet scattering, which is not very well understood in thenon-linear regime of tides. through three-dimensional hydrodynamicalsimulations of multi-orbit encounters, we show that planets that are scatteredinto an orbit about their parent stars with closest approach distance beingless than approximately three times the tidal radius are either destroyed orcompletely ejected from the system. we find that as few as 5 and as many as 18of the currently known hot jupiters have a maximum initial apastron forscattering that lies well within the ice line, implying that these planets musthave migrated either before or after the scattering event that brought them totheir current positions. if stellar tides are unimportant $(q_\ast \gtrsim10^7)$, disk migration is required to explain the existence of the hot jupiterspresent in these systems. additionally, we find that the disruption and/orejection of jupiter-mass planets deposits a sun's worth of angular momentumonto the host star. for systems in which planet-planet scattering is common, wepredict that planetary hosts have up to a 35% chance of possessing an obliquityrelative to the invariable plane of greater than 90 degrees.

1101.5132	prelude to a double degenerate merger: the onset of mass transfer and  its impact on gravitational waves and surface detonations	we present the results of a systematic numerical study of the onset of masstransfer in double degenerate binary systems and its impact on the subsequentevolution. all investigated systems belong to the regime of direct impact,unstable mass transfer. in all of the investigated cases, even those consideredunstable by conventional stability analysis, we find a long-lived mass transferphase continuing for as many as several dozen orbital periods. this settles arecent debate sparked by a discrepancy between earlier sph calculations thatshowed disruptions after a few orbital periods and newer grid-based studies inwhich mass transfer continued for tens of orbits. as we show that thesebinaries can survive at small separation for hundreds of orbital periods, theirassociated gravitational wave signal should be included when calculating thegravitational wave foreground (although expected to below lisa's sensitivity atthese high frequencies). we also show that the inclusion of the entropyincrease associated with shock-heating of the accreted material reduces thenumber of orbits a binary survives given the same initial conditions, althoughthe effect is not as pronounced when using the appropriate initial conditions.the use of accurate initial conditions and a correct treatment of shock heatingallows for a reliable time evolution of the temperature, density, and angularmomentum, which are important when considering thermonuclear events that mayoccur during the mass transfer phase and/or after merger. our treatment allowsus to accurately identify when surface detonations may occur in the lead-up tothe merger, as well as the properties of final merger products.

1104.3140	external mass accumulation onto core potentials: implications for star  clusters, galaxies and galaxy clusters	accretion studies have been focused on the flow around bodies with point massgravitational potentials, but few general results are available for non-pointmass distributions. here, we study the accretion flow onto non-divergent, corepotentials moving through a background medium. we use plummer and hernquistpotentials as examples to study gas accretion onto star clusters, dwarf andlarge galaxy halos and galaxy clusters in a variety of astrophysicalenvironments. the general conditions required for a core potential tocollectively accrete large quantities of gas from the external medium arederived using both simulations and analytic results. the consequences of largemass accumulation in galaxy nuclei, dwarf galaxies and star clusters aretwofold. first, if the gas cools effectively star formation can be triggered,generating new stellar members in the system. second, if the collectivepotential of the system is able to alter the ambient gas properties before thegas is accreted onto the individual core members, the augmented mass supplyrates could significantly alter the state of the various accreting stellarpopulations and result in an enhanced central black hole accretion luminosity.

1104.5504	electromagnetic transients powered by nuclear decay in the tidal tails  of coalescing compact binaries	the possibility that long tidal tails formed during compact object mergersmay power optical transients through the decay of freshly synthesized r-processmaterial is investigated. precise modeling of the merger dynamics allows for arealistic determination of the thermodynamic conditions in the ejected debris.the results of hydrodynamic and full nuclear network calculations are combinedto calculate the resultant r-process abundances and the heating of the materialby their decays. the subsequent homologous structure is mapped into a radiativetransfer code to synthesize emergent model light curves and determine how theirproperties (variability and color evolution) depend on the mass ratio andorientation of the merging binary. the radiation emanating from the ejecteddebris, though less spectacular than a typical supernova, should be observablein transient surveys and we estimate the associated detection rates. the casefor (or against) compact object mergers as the progenitors of short gamma-raybursts can be tested if such electromagnetic transients are detected (or not)in coincidence with some bursts, although they may be obscured by on-axisafterglows.

1111.6667	simulations of grb jets in a stratified external medium: dynamics,  afterglow lightcurves, jet breaks and radio calorimetry	the dynamics of grb jets during the afterglow phase is most reliably andaccurately modelled using hydrodynamic simulations. all published simulations,however, have considered only a uniform external medium, while a stratifiedexternal medium is expected around long duration grb progenitors. here wepresent simulations of the dynamics of grb jets and the resulting afterglowemission for both uniform and stratified external media with $\rho \proptor^{-k}$ for k = 0, 1, 2. the simulations are performed in 2d using the specialrelativistic version of the mezcal code. the dynamics for stratified externalmedia are broadly similar to those derived for expansion into a uniformexternal medium. the jet half-opening angle start increasing logarithmicallywith time once the lorentz factor drops below 1/theta_0. for larger k valuesthe lateral expansion is faster at early times and slower at late times withthe jet expansion becoming newtonian and slowly approaching spherical symmetryover progressively longer timescales. we find that contrary to analyticexpectations, there is a reasonably sharp jet break in the lightcurve for k = 2although the shape of the break is affected more by the viewing angle than bythe slope of the external density profile. steeper density profiles are foundto produce more gradual jet breaks while larger viewing angles cause smootherand later appearing jet breaks. the counter-jet becomes visible as it becomessub-relativistic, and for k=0 this results in a clear bump-like feature in thelight curve. however, for larger k values the jet decelerates more gradually,causing only a mild flattening in the radio light curve that might be hard todiscern when k=2. late time radio calorimetry is likely to consistentlyover-estimate the true energy by up to a factor of a few for k=2, and eitherover-predict or under-predict it by a smaller factor for k = 0,1.

1111.6890	gamma-ray burst dynamics and afterglow radiation from adaptive mesh  refinement, special relativistic hydrodynamic simulations	we report on the development of mezcal-srhd, a new adaptive mesh refinement,special relativistic hydrodynamics (srhd) code, developed with the aim ofstudying the highly relativistic flows in gamma-ray burst sources. the srhdequations are solved using finite volume conservative solvers. the correctimplementation of the algorithms is verified by one-dimensional (1d) shock tubeand multidimensional tests. the code is then applied to study the propagationof 1d spherical impulsive blast waves expanding in a stratified medium with$\rho \propto r^{-k}$, bridging between the relativistic and newtonian phases,as well as to a two-dimensional (2d) cylindrically symmetric impulsive jetpropagating in a constant density medium. it is shown that the deceleration tonon-relativistic speeds in one-dimension occurs on scales significantly largerthan the sedov length. this transition is further delayed with respect to thesedov length as the degree of stratification of the ambient medium isincreased. this result, together with the scaling of position, lorentz factorand the shock velocity as a function of time and shock radius, is explainedhere using a simple analytical model based on energy conservation. the methodused for calculating the afterglow radiation by post-processing the results ofthe simulations is described in detail. the light curves computed using theresults of 1d numerical simulations during the relativistic stage correctlyreproduce those calculated assuming the self-similar blandford-mckee solutionfor the evolution of the flow. the jet dynamics from our 2d simulations and theresulting afterglow lightcurves, including the jet break, are in good agreementwith those presented in previous works. finally, we show how the details of thedynamics critically depend on properly resolving the structure of therelativistic flow.

1201.2406	how the merger of two white dwarfs depends on their mass ratio: orbital  stability and detonations at contact	despite their unique astrophysical relevance, the outcome of white dwarfbinary mergers has so far only been studied for a very restricted number ofsystems. here we present the results of a survey with more than two hundredsimulations systematically scanning the white dwarf binary parameter space. weconsider white dwarf masses ranging from 0.2 to 1.2 $m_\odot$ and account fortheir different chemical compositions. we find excellent agreement with theorbital evolution predicted by mass transfer stability analysis. much of oureffort in this paper is dedicated to determining which binary systems are proneto a thermonuclear explosion just prior to merger or at surface contact. wefind that a large fraction of he-accreting binary systems explode: alldynamically unstable systems with accretor masses below 1.1 $m_\odot$ and donormasses above $\sim$ 0.4 $m_\odot$ are found to trigger a helium detonation atsurface contact. a substantial fraction of these systems could explode atearlier times via detonations induced by instabilities in the accretion stream,as we have demonstrated in our previous work. we do not find definitiveevidence for an explosion prior to merger or at surface contact in any of thestudied double carbon-oxygen systems. although we cannot exclude theiroccurrence if some helium is present, the available parameter space for asuccessful detonation in a white dwarf binary of pure carbon-oxygen compositionis small. we demonstrate that a wide variety of dynamically unstable systemsare viable type ia candidates. the next decade thus holds enormous promise forthe study of these events, in particular with the advent of wide-field synopticsurveys allowing a detailed characterization of their explosive properties.

1201.4186	what sets the initial rotation rates of massive stars?	the physical mechanisms that set the initial rotation rates in massive starsare a crucial unknown in current star formation theory. observations of young,massive stars provide evidence that they form in a similar fashion to theirlow-mass counterparts. the magnetic coupling between a star and its accretiondisk may be sufficient to spin down low-mass pre-main sequence (pms) stars towell below breakup at the end stage of their formation when the accretion rateis low. however, we show that these magnetic torques are insufficient to spindown massive pms stars due to their short formation times and high accretionrates. we develop a model for the angular momentum evolution of stars over awide range in mass, considering both magnetic and gravitational torques. wefind that magnetic torques are unable to spin down either low or high massstars during the main accretion phase, and that massive stars cannot be spundown significantly by magnetic torques during the end stage of their formationeither. spin-down occurs only if massive stars' disk lifetimes aresubstantially longer or their magnetic fields are much stronger than currentobservations suggest.

1203.4085	no snow-plough mechanism during the rapid hardening of supermassive  black hole binaries	we present two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of the tidalinteraction between a supermassive black hole binary with moderate mass ratio,and the fossil gas disc where it is embedded. our study extends previousone-dimensional height-integrated disc models, which predicted that the densityof the gas disc between the primary and the secondary black holes should risesignificantly during the ultimate stages of the binary's hardening driven bythe gravitational radiation torque. this snow-plough mechanism, as we call it,would lead to an increase in the bolometric luminosity of the system prior tothe binary merger, which could be detected in conjunction with thegravitational wave signal. we argue here that the snow-plough mechanism isunlikely to occur. in two-dimensions, when the binary's hardening timescaledriven by gravitational radiation becomes shorter than the disc's viscous drifttimescale, fluid elements in the inner disc get funneled to the outer discthrough horseshoe trajectories with respect to the secondary. mass leakageacross the secondary's gap is thus found to be effective and, as a result, thepredicted accretion disc luminosity will remain at roughly the same level priorto merger.

1205.1507	the dynamics, appearance and demographics of relativistic jets triggered  by tidal disruption of stars in quiescent supermassive black holes	we examine the consequences of a model in which relativistic jets can betriggered in quiescent massive black holes when a geometrically thick and hotaccretion disk forms as a result of the tidal disruption of a star. to estimatethe power, thrust and lifetime of the jet, we use the mass accretion historyonto the black hole as calculated by detailed hydrodynamic simulations of thetidal disruption of stars. we go on to determine the states of the interstellarmedium in various types of quiescent galactic nuclei, and describe how thisexternal matter can affect jets propagating through it. we use thisinformation, together with a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model of thestructure of the relativistic flow, to study the dynamics of the jet, thepropagation of which is regulated by the density stratification of theenvironment and by its injection history. the breaking of symmetry involved intransitioning from one to two dimensions is crucial and leads to qualitativelynew phenomena. many of the observed properties of the swift 1644+57/grb 110328aevent can be understood as resulting from accretion onto and jets driven by a$10^6 m_\odot$ central mass black hole following the disruption of sun-likestar. with the inclusion of a stochastic contribution to the luminosity due tovariations in the feeding rate driven by instabilities near the tidal radius,we find that our model can explain the x-ray light curve without invoking ararely-occurring deep encounter. in conjunction with the number density ofblack holes in the local universe, we hypothesize that the conditions requiredto produce the swift event are not anomalous, but are in fact representative ofthe jet-driven flare population arising from tidal disruptions.

1206.2350	hydrodynamical simulations to determine the feeding rate of black holes  by the tidal disruption of stars: the importance of the impact parameter and  stellar structure	the disruption of stars by supermassive black holes has been linked to morethan a dozen flares in the cores of galaxies out to redshift $z \sim 0.4$.modeling these flares properly requires a prediction of the rate of mass returnto the black hole after a disruption. through hydrodynamical simulation, weshow that aside from the full disruption of a solar mass star at the exactlimit where the star is destroyed, the common assumptions used to estimate$\dot{m}(t)$, the rate of mass return to the black hole, are largely invalid.while the analytical approximation to tidal disruption predicts that theleast-centrally concentrated stars and the deepest encounters should have morequickly-peaked flares, we find that the most-centrally concentrated stars havethe quickest-peaking flares, and the trend between the time of peak and theimpact parameter for deeply-penetrating encounters reverses beyond the criticaldistance at which the star is completely destroyed. we also show that themost-centrally concentrated stars produced a characteristic drop in$\dot{m}(t)$ shortly after peak when a star is only partially disrupted, withthe power law index $n$ being as extreme as -4 in the months immediatelyfollowing the peak of a flare. additionally, we find that $n$ asymptotes to$\simeq -2.2$ for both low- and high-mass stars for approximately half of allstellar disruptions. both of these results are significantly steeper than thetypically assumed $n = -5/3$. as these precipitous decay rates are only seenfor events in which a stellar core survives the disruption, they can be used todetermine if an observed tidal disruption flare produced a surviving remnant.these results should be taken into consideration when flares arising from tidaldisruptions are modeled.

1206.2922	the tidal disruption of giant stars and their contribution to the  flaring supermassive black hole population	sun-like stars are thought to be regularly disrupted by supermassive blackholes (smbhs) within galactic nuclei. yet, as stars evolve off the mainsequence their vulnerability to tidal disruption increases drastically as theydevelop a bifurcated structure consisting of a dense core and a tenuousenvelope. here we present the first hydrodynamic simulations of the tidaldisruption of giant stars and show that the core has a substantial influence onthe star's ability to survive the encounter. stars with more massive coresretain large fractions of their envelope mass, even in deep encounters.accretion flares resulting from the disruption of giant stars should last fortens to hundreds of years. their characteristic signature in transient searcheswould not be the $t^{-5/3}$ decay typically associated with tidal disruptionevents, but a correlated rise over many orders of magnitude in brightness onmonths to years timescales. we calculate the relative disruption rates of starsof varying evolutionary stages in typical galactic centers, then use ourresults to produce monte carlo realizations of the expected flaring eventpopulations. we find that the demographics of tidal disruption flares arestrongly dependent on both stellar and black hole mass, especially near thelimiting smbh mass scale of $\sim 10^8 m_\odot$. at this black hole mass, wepredict a sharp transition in the smbh flaring diet beyond which all observabledisruptions arise from evolved stars, accompanied by a dramatic cutoff in theoverall tidal disruption flaring rate. black holes less massive than thislimiting mass scale will show observable flares from both main sequence andevolved stars, with giants contributing up to 10% of the event rate. therelative fractions of stars disrupted at different evolutionary states canconstrain the properties and distributions of stars in galactic nuclei otherthan our own.

1209.3027	electromagnetic transients as triggers in searches for gravitational  waves from compact binary mergers	the detection of an electromagnetic transient which may originate from abinary neutron star merger can increase the probability that a given segment ofdata from the ligo-virgo ground-based gravitational-wave detector networkcontains a signal from a binary coalescence. additional information containedin the electromagnetic signal, such as the sky location or distance to thesource, can help rule out false alarms, and thus lower the necessary thresholdfor a detection. here, we develop a framework for determining how muchsensitivity is added to a gravitational-wave search by triggering on anelectromagnetic transient. we apply this framework to a variety of relevantelectromagnetic transients, from short grbs to signatures of r-process heatingto optical and radio orphan afterglows. we compute the expected rates ofmulti-messenger observations in the advanced detector era, and find thatsearches triggered on short grbs --- with current high-energy instruments, suchas fermi --- and nucleosynthetic `kilonovae' --- with future optical surveys,like lsst --- can boost the number of multi-messenger detections by 15% and40%, respectively, for a binary neutron star progenitor model. short grbtriggers offer precise merger timing, but suffer from detection rates decreasedby beaming and the high a priori probability that the source is outside theligo-virgo sensitive volume. isotropic kilonovae, on the other hand, could becommonly observed within the ligo-virgo sensitive volume with an instrumentroughly an order of magnitude more sensitive than current optical surveys. wepropose that the most productive strategy for making multi-messengergravitational-wave observations is using triggers from future deep, opticalall-sky surveys, with characteristics comparable to lsst, which could make asmany as ten such coincident observations a year.

1211.1971	on the survivability and metamorphism of tidally disrupted giant  planets: the role of dense cores	a large population of planetary candidates in short-period orbits have beenfound through transit searches. radial velocity surveys have also revealedseveral jupiter-mass planets with highly eccentric orbits. measurements of therossiter-mclaughlin effect indicate some misaligned planetary systems. thisdiversity could be induced by post-formation dynamical processes such asplanet-planet scattering, the kozai effect, or secular chaos which bringsplanets to the vicinity of their host stars. in this work, we propose a novelmechanism to form close-in super-earths and neptune-like planets through thetidal disruption of giant planets as a consequence of these dynamicalprocesses. we model the core-envelope structure of giant planets with compositepolytropes. using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of closeencounters between planets and their host stars, we find that the presence of acore with a mass more than ten earth masses can significantly increase thefraction of envelope which remains bound to it. after the encounter, planetswith cores are more likely to be retained by their host stars in contrast withprevious studies which suggested that coreless planets are often ejected. as asubstantial fraction of their gaseous envelopes is preferentially lost whilethe dense incompressible cores retain most of their original mass, theresulting metallicity of the surviving planets is increased. our resultssuggest that some gas giant planets can be effectively transformed into eithersuper-earths or neptune-like planets after multiple close stellar passages.finally, we analyze the orbits and structure of known planets and keplercandidates and find that our model is capable producing some of theshortest-period objects.

1302.6235	conditions for successful helium detonations in astrophysical  environments	several models for type ia-like supernovae events rely on the production of aself-sustained detonation powered by nuclear reactions. in the absence ofhydrogen, the fuel that powers these detonations typically consists of eitherpure helium (he) or a mixture of carbon and oxygen (c/o). studies thatsystematically determine the conditions required to initiate detonations in c/omaterial exist, but until now no analogous investigation of he matter has beenconducted. we perform one-dimensional reactive hydrodynamical simulations at avariety of initial density and temperature combinations and find criticallength scales for the initiation of he detonations that range between 1 -$10^{10}$ cm. a simple estimate of the length scales over which the totalconsumption of fuel will occur for steady-state detonations is provided by thechapman-jouguet (cj) formalism. our initiation lengths are consistently smallerthan the corresponding cj length scales by a factor of $\sim 100$, providingopportunities for thermonuclear explosions in a wider range of low-mass whitedwarfs (wds) than previously thought possible. we find that virialized wds withas little mass as 0.24 $m_\odot$ can be detonated, and that even less massivewds can be detonated if a sizable fraction of their mass is raised to a higheradiabat. that the initiation length is exceeded by the cj length implies thatcertain systems may not reach nuclear statistical equilibrium within the timeit takes a detonation to traverse the object. in support of this hypothesis, wedemonstrate that incomplete burning will occur in the majority of he wddetonations and that $^{40}$ca, $^{44}$ti, or $^{48}$cr, rather than $^{56}$ni,is the predominant burning product for many of these events. we anticipate that...

1304.2317	local radiation-driven instabilities in post-main sequence massive stars	late in their evolution, massive stars may undergo periods of violentinstability and mass loss, but the mechanism responsible for these episodes hasnot been identified. we study one potential contributor: the development oflocal radiation-driven instabilities in the outer layers of main sequence (ms)and post-ms massive stars. we construct a sequence of massive stellar evolutionmodels and investigate where they are subject to local radiative instabilities,both in the presence of magnetic fields and without them,and at a range ofmetallicities. we find that these types of instabilities do not occur insolar-metallicity ms stars up to 100\,m$_\odot$, but they set in immediatelypost-ms for stars heavier than $\sim 25$\,m$_\odot$. once an instabilityappears, it involves a significant amount of mass in the star's upper layers(up to $\sim 1$ per cent of the initial stellar mass), suggesting thatradiation-driven instabilities are a potentially viable mechanism for dynamicmass loss. we find that the presence of magnetic fields at strengths low enoughnot to disturb the hydrostatic balance of the star does not alter theseresults. stars with sub-solar metallicity also show instability, but theirinstabilities involve less mass and appear later in the star's evolution.

1304.6397	ps1-10jh: the disruption of a main-sequence star of near-solar  composition	when a star comes within a critical distance to a supermassive black hole(smbh), immense tidal forces disrupt the star, resulting in a stream of debristhat falls back onto the smbh and powers a luminous flare. in this paper, weperform hydrodynamical simulations of the disruption of a main-sequence star bya smbh to characterize the evolution of the debris stream after a tidaldisruption. we demonstrate that this debris stream is confined by self-gravityin the two directions perpendicular to the original direction of the star'stravel, and as a consequence has a negligible surface area and makes almost nocontribution to either the continuum or line emission. we therefore proposethat any observed emission lines are not the result of photoionization in thisunbound debris, but are produced in the region above and below the formingelliptical accretion disk, analogous to the broad-line region (blr) insteadily-accreting active galactic nuclei. as each line within a blr isobservationally linked to a particular location in the accretion disk, wesuggest that the absence of a line indicates that the accretion disk does notyet extend to the distance required to produce that line. this model can beused to understand the spectral properties of the tidal disruption event (tde)ps1-10jh, for which he ii lines are observed, but the balmer series and he iare not. using a maximum likelihood analysis, we show that the disruption of amain-sequence star of near-solar composition can reproduce this event.

1305.4634	turbovelocity stars: kicks resulting from the tidal disruption of  solitary stars	the centers of most known galaxies host supermassive black holes (smbhs). inorbit around these black holes are a centrally-concentrated distribution ofstars, both in single and in binary systems. occasionally, these stars areperturbed onto orbits that bring them close to the smbh. if the star is in abinary system, the three-body interaction with the smbh can lead to largechanges in orbital energy, depositing one of the two stars on a tightly-boundorbit, and its companion into a hyperbolic orbit that may escape the galaxy. inthis letter, we show that the disruption of solitary stars can also lead tolarge positive increases in orbital energy. the kick velocity depends on theamount of mass the star loses at pericenter, but not on the ratio of black holeto stellar mass, and are at most the star's own escape velocity. we find thatthese kicks are usually too small to result in the ejection of stars from themilky way, but can eject the stars from the black hole's sphere of influence,reducing their probability of being disrupted again. we estimate that ~10^5stars, ~1% of all stars within 10 pc of the galactic center, are likely to havehad mass removed by the central black hole through tidal interaction, andspeculate that these "turbovelocity" stars will at first be redder, buteventually bluer, and always brighter than their unharrassed peers.

1305.4660	the burst cluster: dark matter in a cluster merger associated with the  short gamma ray burst, grb 050509b	we have identified a merging galaxy cluster with evidence of two distinctsub-clusters. the x-ray and optical data suggest that the subclusters aremoving away from each other after closest approach. this cluster merger wasdiscovered from observations of the well localized short-duration gamma-rayburst (grb), grb 050509b. the swift/burst alert telescope (bat) source positionis coincident with a cluster of galaxies zwcl 1234.0+02916. the subsequentswift/x-ray telescope (xrt) localization of the x-ray afterglow found the grbcoincident with 2masx j12361286+2858580, a giant red elliptical galaxy in thecluster. deep multi-epoch optical images were obtained to constrain theevolution of the grb afterglow, including a 27480s exposure in the f814w bandwith hubble space telescope advanced camera for surveys (acs), among thedeepest imaging ever obtained towards a known galaxy cluster in a singlepassband. we perform a weak gravitational lensing analysis, including mappingthe total mass distribution of the merger system. combined with chandra x-rayobservatory and swift/xrt observations, we investigate the dynamical state ofthe merger to probe the nature of the dark matter component. our weakgravitational lensing measurements reveal a separation of the x-ray centroid ofthe western subcluster from the center of the mass and galaxy lightdistributions, similar to that of the famous "bullet cluster". we conclude thatthe "burst cluster" is another candidate merger system for determining thenature of dark matter and for studying the environment of short grbs. wediscuss connections between the cluster dynamical state and/or mattercomposition and compact object mergers, the leading model for the origin ofshort grbs. finally, we present results from a weak lensing survey based onarchival very large telescope (vlt) images in the areas of 5 other short grbs.

1306.3503	constraining explosion type of young supernova remnants using 24 micron  emission morphology	determination of the explosion type of supernova remnants (snrs) can bechallenging, as snrs are hundreds to thousands of years old and supernovae(sne) are classified based on spectral properties days after explosion.previous studies of thermal x-ray emission from milky way and large magellaniccloud (lmc) snrs have shown that type ia and core-collapse (cc) snrs havestatistically different symmetries, and thus these sources can be typed basedon their x-ray morphologies. in this paper, we extend the same technique, amultipole expansion technique using power ratios, to infrared (ir) images ofsnrs to test whether they can be typed using the symmetry of their warm dustemission as well. we analyzed archival spitzer space telescope multibandimaging photometer (mips) 24 micron observations of the previously used x-raysample, and we find that the two classes of snrs separate according to their irmorphologies. the type ia snrs are statistically more circular and mirrorsymmetric than the cc snrs, likely due to the different circumstellarenvironments and explosion geometries of the progenitors. broadly, our workindicates that the ir emission retains information of the explosive origins ofthe snr and offers a new method to type snrs based on ir morphology.

1307.2900	spoon-feeding giant stars to supermassive black holes: episodic mass  transfer from evolving stars and their contribution to the quiescent activity  of galactic nuclei	stars may be tidally disrupted if, in a single orbit, they are scattered tooclose to a supermassive black hole (smbh). tidal disruption events are thoughtto power luminous but short-lived accretion episodes that can light upotherwise quiescent smbhs in transient flares. here we explore a more gradualprocess of tidal stripping where stars approach the tidal disruption radius bystellar evolution while in an eccentric orbit. after the onset of masstransfer, these stars episodically transfer mass to the smbh every pericenterpassage giving rise to low-level flares that repeat on the orbital timescale.giant stars, in particular, will exhibit a runaway response to mass loss and"spoon-feed" material to the black hole for tens to hundreds of orbitalperiods. in contrast to full tidal disruption events, the duty cycle of thisfeeding mode is of order unity for black holes with mass greater thanapproximately 10 million solar masses. this mode of quasi-steady smbh feedingis competitive with indirect smbh feeding through stellar winds, and spoon-fedgiant stars may play a significant role in determining the quiescent luminosityof local smbhs.

1308.2964	the formation of eccentric compact binary inspirals and the role of  gravitational wave emission in binary-single stellar encounters	the inspiral and merger of eccentric binaries leads to gravitationalwaveforms distinct from those generated by circularly merging binaries.dynamical environments can assemble binaries with high eccentricity and peakfrequencies within the {\it ligo} band. in this paper, we study binary-singlestellar scatterings occurring in dense stellar systems as a source ofeccentrically-inspiraling binaries. many interactions between compact binariesand single objects are characterized by chaotic resonances in which thebinary-single system undergoes many exchanges before reaching a final state.during these chaotic resonances, a pair of objects has a non-negligibleprobability of experiencing a very close passage. significant orbital energyand angular momentum are carried away from the system by gravitational wave(gw) radiation in these close passages and in some cases this implies aninspiral time shorter than the orbital period of the bound third body. wederive the cross section for such dynamical inspiral outcomes throughanalytical arguments and through numerical scattering experiments including gwlosses. we show that the cross section for dynamical inspirals grows withincreasing target binary semi-major axis, $a$, and that for equal-mass binariesit scales as $a^{2/7}$. thus, we expect wide target binaries to predominantlycontribute to the production of these relativistic outcomes. we estimate thateccentric inspirals account for approximately one percent of dynamicallyassembled non-eccentric merging binaries. while these events are rare, we showthat binary-single scatterings are a more effective formation channel thansingle-single captures for the production of eccentrically-inspiralingbinaries, even given modest binary fractions.

1309.1464	unraveling the origin of overionized plasma in the galactic supernova  remnant w49b	recent observations have shown several supernova remnants (snrs) haveoverionized plasmas, those where ions are stripped of more electrons than theywould be if in equilibrium with the electron temperature. rapid electroncooling is necessary to produce this situation, yet the physical origin of thatcooling remains uncertain. to assess the cooling scenario responsible foroverionization, in this paper, we identify and map the overionized plasma inthe galactic snr w49b based on a 220 ks chandra advanced ccd imagingspectrometer (acis) observation. we performed a spatially-resolvedspectroscopic analysis, measuring the electron temperature by modeling thecontinuum and comparing it to the temperature given by the flux ratio of thehe-like and h-like lines of sulfur and of argon. using these results, we findthat w49b is overionized in the west, with a gradient of increasingoverionization from east to west. as the ejecta expansion is impeded bymolecular material in the east but not in the west, our overionization mapssuggest the dominant cooling mechanism is adiabatic expansion of the hotplasma.

1309.2645	understanding the unusual x-ray emission properties of the massive,  close binary wr 20a: a high energy window into the stellar wind initiation  region	the problem of explaining the x-ray emission properties of the massive, closebinary wr 20a is discussed. located near the cluster core of westerlund 2, wr20a is composed of two nearly identical wolf- rayet stars of 82 and 83 solarmasses orbiting with a period of only 3.7 days. although chandra observationswere taken during the secondary optical eclipse, the x-ray light curve shows nosigns of a flux decrement. in fact, wr 20a appears slightly more x-ray luminousand softer during the optical eclipse, opposite to what has been observed inother binary systems. to aid in our interpretation of the data, we compare withthe results of hydrodynamical simulations using the adaptive mesh refinementcode mezcal that includes radiative cooling and a radiative acceleration forceterm. it is shown that the x-ray emission can be successfully explained inmodels where the wind-wind collision interface in this system occurs while theoutflowing material is still being accelerated. consequently, wr 20a serves asa critical test-case for how radiatively-driven stellar winds initiate andinteract. our models not only procure a robust description of current chandradata, which cover the orbital phases between 0.3 to 0.6, but provide detailedpredictions over the entire orbit.

1309.5421	the role of stellar feedback in the dynamics of hii regions	stellar feedback is often cited as the biggest uncertainty in galaxyformation models today. this uncertainty stems from a dearth of observationalconstraints as well as the great dynamic range between the small scales (&lt;1 pc)where the feedback occurs and the large scales of galaxies (&gt;1 kpc) that areshaped by this feedback. to bridge this divide, in this paper we aim to assessobservationally the role of stellar feedback at the intermediate scales of hiiregions. in particular, we employ multiwavelength data to examine severalstellar feedback mechanisms in a sample of 32 hii regions in the large andsmall magellanic clouds (lmc and smc, respectively). using optical, infrared,radio, and x-ray images, we measure the pressures exerted on the shells fromthe direct stellar radiation, the dust-processed radiation, the warm ionizedgas, and the hot x-ray emitting gas. we find that the warm ionized gasdominates over the other terms in all of the sources, although two havecomparable dust-processed radiation pressures to their warm gas pressures. thehot gas pressures are comparatively weak, while the direct radiation pressuresare 1-2 orders of magnitude below the other terms. we discuss the implicationsof these results, particularly highlighting evidence for hot gas leakage fromthe hii shells and regarding the momentum deposition from the dust-processedradiation to the warm gas. furthermore, we emphasize that similar observationalwork should be done on very young hii regions to test whether direct radiationpressure and hot gas can drive the dynamics at early times.

1309.7049	the morphology and dynamics of jet-driven supernova remnants: the case  of w49b	the circumstellar medium (csm) of a massive star is modified by its windsbefore a supernova (sn) explosion occurs, and thus the evolution of theresulting supernova remnant (snr) is influenced by both the geometry of theexplosion as well as the complex structure of the csm. motivated by recent worksuggesting the snr w49b was a jet-driven sn expanding in a complex csm, weexplore how the dynamics and the metal distributions in a jet-driven explosionare modified by the interaction with the surrounding environment. inparticular, we perform hydrodynamical calculations to study the dynamics andexplosive nucleosynthesis of a jet-driven sn triggered by the collapse of a 25solar masses wolf-rayet star and its subsequent interaction with the csm up toseveral hundred years following the explosion. we find that although the csmhas small-scale effects on the structure of the snr, the overall morphology andabundance patterns are reflective of the initial asymmetry of the sn explosion.thus, we predict that jet-driven snrs, such as w49b, should be identifiablebased on morphology and abundance patterns at ages up to several hundred years,even if they expand into a complex csm environment.

1310.4498	identification of a jet-driven supernova remnant in the small magellanic  cloud: possible evidence for the enhancement of bipolar explosions at low  metallicity	recent evidence has suggested that the supernova remnant (snr) 0104-72.3 inthe small magellanic cloud (smc) may be the result of a prompt type ia sn basedon enhanced iron abundances and its association with a star-forming region. inthis paper, we present evidence that snr 0104-72.3 arose from a jet-drivenbipolar core-collapse sn. specifically, we use serendipitous chandra x-rayobservatory data of snr 0104-72.3 taken due to its proximity to the calibrationsource snr e0102-72.3. we analyze 56 advanced ccd imaging spectrometer (acis)observations of snr 0104-72.3 to produce imaging and spectra with an effectiveexposure of 528.6 ks. we demonstrate that snr 0104-72.3 is highly ellipticalrelative to other nearby young snrs, suggesting a core-collapse sn origin.furthermore, we compare ejecta abundances derived from spectral fits tonucleosynthetic yields of type ia and core-collapse (cc) sne, and we find thatthe iron, neon, and silicon abundances are consistent with either a sphericalcc sn of a 18-20 solar mass progenitor or an aspherical cc sn of a 25 solarmass progenitor. we show that the star-formation history at the site of snr0104-72.3 is also consistent with a cc origin. given the bipolar morphology ofthe snr, we favor the aspherical cc sn scenario. this result may suggestjet-driven sne occur frequently in the low-metallicity environment of the smc,consistent with the observational and theoretical work on broad-line type icsne and long-duration gamma-ray bursts.

1401.2990	possible origin of the g2 cloud from the tidal disruption of a known  giant star by sgr a*	the discovery of the gas cloud g2 on a near-radial orbit about sgr a* hasprompted much speculation on its origin. in this letter, we propose that g2formed out of the debris stream produced by the removal of mass from the outerenvelope of a nearby giant star. we perform hydrodynamical simulations of thereturning tidal debris stream with cooling, and find that the stream condensesinto clumps that fall periodically onto sgr a*. we propose that one of theseclumps is the observed g2 cloud, with the rest of the stream being detectableat lower br-$\gamma$ emissivity along a trajectory that would trace from g2 tothe star that was partially disrupted. by simultaneously fitting the orbits ofs2, g2, and $\sim$ 2,000 candidate stars, and by fixing the orbital plane ofeach candidate star to g2 (as is expected for a tidal disruption), we find thatseveral stars have orbits that are compatible with the notion that one of themwas tidally disrupted to produce g2. if one of these stars were indeeddisrupted, it last encountered sgr a* hundreds of years ago, and has likelyencountered sgr a* repeatedly. however, while these stars are compatible withthe giant disruption scenario given their measured positions and propermotions, their radial velocities are currently unknown. if one of these stars'radial velocity is measured to be compatible with a disruptive orbit, it wouldstrongly suggest its disruption produced g2.

1401.7986	interpreting short gamma ray burst progenitor kicks and time delays  using the host galaxy-dark matter halo connection	nearly 20% of short gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs) have no observed host galaxies.combining this finding with constraints on galaxies' dark matter halo potentialwells gives strong limits on the natal kick velocity distribution for sgrbprogenitors. for the best-fitting velocity distribution, one in five sgrbprogenitors receives a natal kick above 150 km/s, consistent with mergingneutron star models but not with merging white dwarf binary models. thisprogenitor model constraint is robust to a wide variety of systematicuncertainties, including the sgrb progenitor time-delay model, the swiftredshift sensitivity, and the shape of the natal kick velocity distribution. wealso use constraints on the galaxy-halo connection to determine the host haloand host galaxy demographics for sgrbs, which match extremely well withavailable data. most sgrbs are expected to occur in halos near 10^12 msun andin galaxies near 5x10^10 msun (l_*); unobserved faint and high-redshift hostgalaxies contribute a small minority of the observed hostless sgrb fraction. wefind that sgrb redshift distributions and host galaxy stellar masses weaklyconstrain the progenitor time-delay model; the active vs. passive fraction ofsgrb host galaxies may offer a stronger constraint. finally, we discuss howsearches for gravitational wave optical counterparts in the local universe canreduce followup times using these findings.

1404.0383	necessary conditions for short gamma-ray burst production in binary  neutron star mergers	the central engine of short gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs) is hidden from directview, operating at a scale much smaller than that probed by the emittedradiation. thus we must infer its origin not only with respect to the formationof the {\it trigger} - the actual astrophysical configuration that is capableof powering a sgrb - but also from the consequences that follow from thevarious evolutionary pathways that may be involved in producing it. consideringbinary neutron star mergers we critically evaluate, analytically and throughnumerical simulations, whether the neutrino-driven wind produced by the newlyformed hyper-massive neutron star can allow the collimated relativistic outflowthat follows its collapse to actually produce a sgrb or not. upon comparisonwith the observed sgrb duration distribution, we find that collapse cannot besignificantly delayed (&lt;=100 ms) before the outflow is choked, thus limitingthe possibility that long-lived hyper-massive remnants can account for theseevents. in the case of successful breakthrough of the jet through theneutrino-driven wind, the energy stored in the cocoon could contribute to theprecursor and extended emission observed in sgrbs.

1405.0010	diversity of short gamma-ray burst afterglows from compact binary  mergers hosting pulsars	short gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs) are widely believed to result from the mergersof compact binaries. this model predicts an afterglow that bears thecharacteristic signatures of a constant, low density medium, including a smoothprompt-afterglow transition, and a simple temporal evolution. however, theseexpectations are in conflict with observations for a non-negligible fraction ofsgrb afterglows. in particular, the onset of the afterglow phase for some ofthese events appears to be delayed and, in addition, a few of them exhibitlate- time rapid fading in their lightcurves. we show that these peculiarobservations can be explained independently of ongoing central engine activityif some sgrb progenitors are compact binaries hosting at least one pulsar. thepoynting flux emanating from the pulsar companion can excavate a bow-shockcavity surround- ing the binary. if this cavity is larger than the shockdeceleration length scale in the undisturbed interstellar medium, then theonset of the afterglow will be delayed. should the deceleration occur entirelywithin the swept-up thin shell, a rapid fade in the lightcurve will ensue. weidentify two types of pulsar that can achieve the conditions necessary foraltering the afterglow: low field, long lived pulsars, and high field pulsars.we find that a sizable fraction (~20-50%) of low field pulsars are likely toreside in neutron star binaries based on observations, while their high fieldcounterparts are not. hydrodynamical calculations motivated by this model areshown to be in good agreement with observations of sgrb afterglow lightcurves.

1405.1426	illuminating massive black holes with white dwarfs: orbital dynamics and  high energy transients from tidal interactions	white dwarfs (wds) can be tidally disrupted only by massive black holes(mbhs) with masses less than $\sim10^5 m_\odot$. these tidal interactions feedmaterial to the mbh well above its eddington limit, with the potential tolaunch a relativistic jet. the corresponding beamed emission is a promisingsignpost to an otherwise quiescent mbh of relatively low mass. we show that themass transfer history, and thus the lightcurve, are quite different when thedisruptive orbit is parabolic, eccentric, or circular. the mass lost each orbitexponentiates in the eccentric-orbit case leading to the destruction of the wdafter several tens of orbits. we examine the stellar dynamics of clusterssurrounding mbhs to show that single-passage wd disruptions are substantiallymore common than repeating encounters. the $10^{49}$ erg s$^{-1}$ peakluminosity of these events makes them visible to cosmological distances. theymay be detectible at rates of as many as tens per year by instruments likeswift. in fact, wd-disruption transients significantly outshine theirmain-sequence star counterparts, and are the most likely tidal interaction tobe detected arising from mbhs with masses less than $10^5 m_\odot$. thedetection or non-detection of such wd-disruption transients by swift is,therefore, a powerful tool to constrain lower end of the mbh mass function. theemerging class of ultra-long gamma ray bursts all have peak luminosities anddurations reminiscent of wd disruptions, offering a hint that wd-disruptiontransients may already be present in existing datasets.

1405.1427	gone with the wind: where is the missing stellar wind energy from  massive star clusters?	star clusters larger than $\sim 10^{3}$ $m_\odot$ contain multiple hot starsthat launch fast stellar winds. the integrated kinetic energy carried by thesewinds is comparable to that delivered by supernova explosions, suggesting thatat early times winds could be an important form of feedback on the surroundingcold material from which the star cluster formed. however, the interaction ofthese winds with the surrounding clumpy, turbulent, cold gas is complex andpoorly understood. here we investigate this problem via an accounting exercise:we use empirically determined properties of four well-studied massive starclusters to determine where the energy injected by stellar winds ultimatelyends up. we consider a range of kinetic energy loss channels, includingradiative cooling, mechanical work on the cold interstellar medium, thermalconduction, heating of dust via collisions by the hot gas, and bulk advectionof thermal energy by the hot gas. we show that, for at least some of theclusters, none of these channels can account for more than a small fraction ofthe injected energy. we suggest that turbulent mixing at the hot-cold interfaceor physical leakage of the hot gas from the hii region can efficiently removethe kinetic energy injected by the massive stars in young star clusters. evenfor the clusters where we are able to account for all the injected kineticenergy, we show that our accounting sets strong constraints on the importanceof stellar winds as a mechanism for feedback on the cold interstellar medium.

1407.3796	the history of r-process enrichment in the milky way	we investigate the production sites and the enrichment history of $r$-processelements in the galaxy, as traced by the [eu/fe] ratio, using the highresolution, cosmological zoom-in simulation `eris'. at $z=0$, eris represents aclose analog to the milky way, making it the ideal laboratory to understand thechemical evolution of our galaxy. eris formally traces the production of oxygenand iron due to type-ia and type-ii supernovae. we include in post-processingthe production of $r$-process elements from compact binary mergers. unlikeprevious studies, we find that the nucleosynthetic products from compact binarymergers can be incorporated into stars of very low metallicity and at earlytimes, even with a minimum delay time of 100 myr. this conclusion is relativelyinsensitive to modest variations in the merger rate, minimum delay time, andthe delay time distribution. by implementing a first-order prescription formetal-mixing, we can further improve the agreement between our model and thedata for the chemical evolution of both [$\alpha$/fe] and [eu/fe].we argue thatcompact binary mergers could be the dominant source of $r$-processnucleosynthesis in the galaxy.

1410.3467	compact stellar binary assembly in the first nuclear star clusters and  r-process synthesis in the early universe	investigations of elemental abundances in the ancient and most metaldeficient stars are extremely important because they serve as tests of variablenucleosynthesis pathways and can provide critical inferences of the type ofstars that lived and died before them. the presence of r-process elements in ahandful of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (cemp-r) stars, which are assumed to beclosely connected to the chemical yield from the first stars, is hard toreconcile with standard neutron star mergers. here we show that the productionrate of dynamically assembled compact binaries in high-z nuclear star clusterscan attain a sufficient high value to be a potential viable source of heavyr-process material in cemp-r stars. the predicted frequency of such events inthe early galaxy, much lower than the frequency of type ii supernovae but withsignificantly higher mass ejected per event, can naturally lead to a high levelof scatter of eu as observed in cemp-r stars.

1410.3823	asymmetric accretion flows within a common envelope	this paper examines flows in the immediate vicinity of stars and compactobjects dynamically inspiralling within a common envelope (ce). flow in thevicinity of the embedded object is gravitationally focused leading to drag andpotential to gas accretion. this process has been studied numerically andanalytically in the context of hoyle-lyttleton accretion (hla). yet, within ace, accretion structures may span a large fraction of the envelope radius, andin so doing sweep across a substantial radial gradient of density. we quantifythese gradients using detailed stellar evolution models for a range of ceencounters. we provide estimates of typical scales in ce encounters thatinvolve main sequence stars, white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes withgiant-branch companions of a wide range of masses. we apply these typicalscales to hydrodynamic simulations of 3d hla with an upstream density gradient.this density gradient breaks the symmetry that defines hla flow, and imposes anangular momentum barrier to accretion. material that is focused into thevicinity of the embedded object thus may not be able to accrete. as a result,accretion rates drop dramatically, by 1-2 orders of magnitude, while drag ratesare only mildly affected. we provide fitting formulae to thenumerically-derived rates of drag and accretion as a function of the densitygradient. the reduced ratio of accretion to drag suggests that objects that canefficiently gain mass during ce evolution, such as black holes and neutronstars, may grow less than implied by the hla formalism.

1410.5421	on the accretion-fed growth of neutron stars during common envelope	this paper models the orbital inspiral of a neutron star (ns) through theenvelope of its giant-branch companion during a common envelope (ce) episode.these ce episodes are necessary to produce close pairs of nss that can inspiraland merge due to gravitational wave losses in less than a hubble time. becausecooling by neutrinos can be very efficient, nss have been predicted toaccumulate significant mass during ce events, perhaps enough to lead them tocollapse to black holes. we revisit this conclusion with the additionalconsideration of ce structure, particularly density gradients across theembedded ns's accretion radius. this work is informed by our recent numericalsimulations that find that the presence of a density gradient strongly limitsaccretion by imposing a net angular momentum to the flow around the ns. ourcalculations suggest that nss should survive ce encounters. they accrete onlymodest amounts of envelope material, $\lesssim 0.1m_\odot$, which is broadlyconsistent with mass determinations of double ns binaries. with less mass gain,nss must spiral deeper to eject their ce, leading to a potential increase inmergers. the survival of nss in ce events has implications for the formationmechanism of observed double ns binaries, as well as for predicted rates of nsbinary gravitational wave inspirals and their electromagnetic counterparts.

1501.05306	a dark year for tidal disruption events	the disruption of a main-sequence star by a supermassive black hole resultsin the initial production of an extended debris stream that winds repeatedlyaround the black hole, producing a complex three-dimensional figure that mayself-intersect. both analytical work and simulations have shown that typicalencounters generate streams that are extremely thin. in this paper we show thatthis implies that even small relativistic precessions attributed to black holespin can induce deflections that prevent the stream from self-intersecting evenafter many windings. additionally, hydrodynamical simulations have demonstratedthat energy is deposited very slowly via hydrodynamic processes alone,resulting in the liberation of very little gravitational binding energy in theabsence of stream-stream collisions. this naturally leads to a "dark period" inwhich the flare is not observable for some time, persisting for up to a dozenorbital periods of the most bound material, which translates to years fordisruptions around black holes with mass $\sim 10^{7} m_{\odot}$. we find thatmore-massive black holes tend to have more violent stream self-intersections,resulting in short viscous times that lead to prompt accretion onto the blackhole. for these tidal disruption events (tdes), the accretion rate onto theblack hole should still closely follow the original fallback rate after a fixeddelay time $t_{\rm delay}$. for lower black hole masses ($m_{\rm h} \lesssim10^{6}$), we find that flares are typically slowed down by about an order ofmagnitude, and because the accretion rates for tdes about higher-mass blackhole are already sub-eddington, this results in the majority of tdes beingsub-eddington at peak. this also implies that current searches for tdes arebiased towards prompt flares, with slowed flares likely having beenunidentified.

1504.00007	the past and future of detached double white dwarfs with helium donors	we present a method for modeling the evolution of detached double white dwarf(dwd) binaries hosting helium donors from the end of the common envelope (ce)phase to the onset of roche lobe overflow (rlof). this is achieved by combiningdetailed stellar evolution calculations of extremely low mass (elm) helium wdspossessing hydrogen envelopes with the the orbital shrinking of the binarydriven by gravitational radiation. we show that the consideration of hydrogenfusion in these systems is crucial, as a significant fraction ($\approx$50%) offuture donors are expected to still be burning when mass transfer commences. weapply our method to two detached eclipsing dwd systems, sdss j0651+2844 andnltt-11748, in order to demonstrate the effect that carbon-nitrogen-oxygen(cno) flashes have on constraining the evolutionary history of such systems. wefind that when cno flashes are absent on the low mass wd ($m_{2}$ &lt; $0.18m_{\odot}$), such as in nltt-11748, we are able to self consistently solve forthe donor conditions at ce detachment given a reliable cooling age from themassive wd companion. when cno flashes occur (0.18 $m_{\odot}$ &lt; $m_{2}$ &lt; 0.36$m_{\odot}$), such as in sdss j0651+2844, the evolutionary history iseradicated and we are unable to comment on the detachment conditions. we findthat for any donor mass our models are able to predict the conditions atreattachment and comment on the stabilizing effects of hydrogen envelopes. thismethod can be applied to a population of detached dwds with measured donorradii and masses.

1504.07605	the fate of the compact remnant in neutron star mergers	neutron star (binary neutron star and neutron star - black hole) mergers arebelieved to produce short-duration gamma-ray bursts. they are also believed tobe the dominant source of gravitational waves to be detected by the advancedligo and the dominant source of the heavy r-process elements in the universe.whether or not these mergers produce short-duration grbs depends sensitively onthe fate of the core of the remnant (whether, and how quickly, it forms a blackhole). in this paper, we combine the results of merger calculations andequation of state studies to determine the fate of the cores of neutron starmergers. using population studies, we can determine the distribution of thesefates to compare to observations. we find that black hole cores form quicklyonly for equations of state that predict maximum non-rotating neutron starmasses below 2.3-2.4 solar masses. if quick black hole formation is essentialin producing gamma-ray bursts, ligo observed rates compared to grb rates couldbe used to constrain the equation of state for dense nuclear matter.

1505.06737	initial-final mass relation for 3 to 4 m$_\odot$ progenitors of white  dwarfs from the single cluster ngc 2099	we have expanded the sample of observed white dwarfs in the rich open clusterngc 2099 (m37) with the keck low-resolution imaging spectrometer. of 20 whitedwarf candidates, the spectroscopy shows 19 to be true white dwarfs with 14 ofthese having high s/n. we find 11 of these 14 to be consistent with singlyevolved cluster members. they span a mass range of $\sim$0.7 to 0.95 m$_\odot$,excluding a low-mass outlier, corresponding to progenitor masses of $\sim$3 to4 m$_\odot$. this region of the initial final mass relation (ifmr) has largescatter and a slope that remains to be precisely determined. with this largesample of white dwarfs that belong to a single age and metallicity population,we find an initial-final mass relation of (0.171$\pm$0.057)m$_{\rminitial}$+0.219$\pm$0.187 m$_\odot$, significantly steeper than the linearrelation adopted over the full observed white dwarf mass range in many previousstudies. comparison of this new relation from the solar metallicity ngc 2099 to18 white dwarfs in the metal-rich hyades and praesepe shows that their ifmralso has a consistently steep slope. this strong consistency also suggests thatthere is no significant metallicity dependence of the ifmr at this mass andmetallicity range. as a result, the ifmr can be more reliably determined withthis broad sample of 29 total white dwarfs giving m$_{\rmfinal}$=(0.163$\pm$0.022)m$_{\rm initial}$+0.238$\pm$0.071 m$_\odot$ fromm$_{\rm initial}$ of 3 to 4 m$_\odot$. a steep ifmr in this mass rangeindicates that the full ifmr is nonlinear.

1508.02402	thermonuclear detonations ensuing white dwarf mergers	the merger of two white dwarfs (wds) has for many years not been consideredas the favoured model for the progenitor system of type ia supernovae (sne ia).but recent years have seen a change of opinion as a number of studies, bothobservational and theoretical, have concluded that they should contributesignificantly to the observed type ia supernova rate. in this paper, we studythe ignition and propagation of detonation through post-merger remnants and wefollow the resulting nucleosynthesis up to the point where a homologousexpansion is reached. in our study we cover the entire range of wd masses andcompositions. for the emergence of a detonation we study three differentsetups. the first two are guided by the merger remnants from our earliersimulations (dan et al. 2014}, while for the third one the ignitions were setby placing hotspots with properties determined by spatially resolvedcalculations taken from the literature. there are some caveats to our approachwhich we investigate. we carefully compare the nucleosynthetic yields ofsuccessful explosions with sn ia observations. only three of our models areconsistent with all the imposed constraints and potentially lead to a standardtype ia event. the first one, a $0.45\,m_\odot\ {\rm helium\ (he)} + 0.9\,m_\odot$ carbon-oxygen (co) wd system produces a sub-luminous, sn 1991bg-likeevent while the other two, a $0.45\,m_\odot\ {\rm he} + 1.1\,m_\odot$oxygen-neon (one) wd system and a $1.05+1.05\,m_\odot$ system with two co wds,are good candidates for common sne ia.

0806.0399	a survey for nv absorption at z~z_grb in grb afterglow spectra: clues to  gas near the progenitor star	we survey nv absorption in the afterglow spectra of long-duration gamma-raybursts (grbs) with the intent to study highly ionized gas in the galaxieshosting these events. we identify a high incidence (6/7) of spectra exhibitingnv gas with z~z_grb and the majority show large column densities nv &gt; 10^14cm^-2. with one exception, the observed line-profiles are kinematically `cold',i.e. they are narrow and have small velocity offset (dv &lt; 20 km/s) fromabsorption lines associated with neutral gas. in addition, the nv absorptionhas similar velocity as the uv-pumped fine-structure lines indicating thesehigh ions are located within ~1kpc of the grb afterglow. these characteristicsare unlike those for nv gas detected in the halo/disk of the milky way or alongsightlines through high z damped lya systems but resemble the narrow absorptionline systems associated with quasars and some high z starbursts. we demonstratethat grb afterglows photoionize nitrogen to nv at r~10pc. this process canproduce nv absorption with characteristics resembling the majority of oursample and and we argue it is the principal mechanism for nv along grbsightlines. therefore, the observations provide a snapshot of the physicalconditions at this distance. in this scenario, the observations imply theprogenitor's stellar wind is confined to r&lt;10pc which suggests the grbprogenitors occur within dense (n &gt; 10^3 cm^-3) environments, typical ofmolecular clouds. the observations, therefore, primarily constrain the physicalconditions -- metallicity, density, velocity fields -- of the gas within the(former) molecular cloud region surrounding the grb.

1510.06348	flows of x-ray gas reveal the disruption of a star by a massive black  hole	tidal forces close to massive black holes can violently disrupt stars thatmake a close approach. these extreme events are discovered via bright x-ray andoptical/uv flares in galactic centers. prior studies based on modeling decayingflux trends have been able to estimate broad properties, such as the massaccretion rate. here we report the detection of flows of highly ionized x-raygas in high-resolution x-ray spectra of a nearby tidal disruption event.variability within the absorption-dominated spectra indicates that the gas isrelatively close to the black hole. narrow line widths indicate that the gasdoes not stretch over a large range of radii, giving a low volume fillingfactor. modest outflow speeds of a few hundred kilometers per second areobserved, significantly below the escape speed from the radius set byvariability. the gas flow is consistent with a rotating wind from the inner,super-eddington region of a nascent accretion disk, or with a filament ofdisrupted stellar gas near to the apocenter of an elliptical orbit. flows ofthis sort are predicted by fundamental analytical theory and more recentnumerical simulations.

0808.0462	gamma ray burst production and supernova signatures in slowly rotating  collapsars	we consider accretion onto newborn black holes following the collapse ofrotating massive stellar cores, at the threshold where a centrifugallysupported disk gives way to nearly radial inflow for low angular momentum. forrealistic initial conditions taken from pre-supernova (pre-sn) evolutioncalculations, the densities and temperatures involved require the use of adetailed equation of state and neutrino cooling processes, as well as aqualitative consideration of the effects of general relativity. throughtwo-dimensional dynamical calculations we show how the energy release isaffected by the rotation rate and the strength of angular momentum transport,giving rise to qualitatively different solutions in limits of high and lowangular momentum, each being capable of powering a gamma-ray burst (grb). weexplore the likelihood of producing fe-group elements in the two regimes andsuggest that while large and massive centrifugally supported disks are capableof driving strong outflows with a possible sn-like signature, quasi-radialflows lack such a feature and may produce a grb without such an accompanyingfeature, as seen in grb060505.

astro-ph;0004302	a possible cepheid-like luminosity estimator for the long gamma-ray  bursts	we present a possible cepheid-like luminosity estimator for the longgamma-ray bursts based on the variability of their light curves. to constructthe luminosity estimator, we use cgro/batse data for 13 bursts, wind/konus datafor 5 bursts, ulysses/grb data for 1 burst, and near/xgrs data for 1 burst.spectroscopic redshifts, peak fluxes, and high resolution light curves areavailable for 11 of these bursts; partial information is available for theremaining 9 bursts. we find that the isotropic-equivalent luminosities l ofthese bursts positively correlate with a rigorously-constructed measure v ofthe variability of their light curves. we fit a model to these data thataccommodates both intrinsic scatter (statistical variance) and extrinsicscatter (sample variance). if one excludes grb 980425 from the fit on thegrounds that its association with sn 1998bw at a redshift of z = 0.0085 is notsecure, the luminosity estimator spans approx. 2.5 orders of magnitude in l,and the slope of the correlation between l and v is positive with a probabilityof 1 - 1.4 x 10^-4 (3.8 sigma). although grb 980425 is excluded from this fit,its l and v values are consistent with the fitted model, which suggests thatgrb 980425 may well be associated with sn 1998bw, and that grb 980425 and thecosmological bursts may share a common physical origin. if one includes grb980425 in the fit, the luminosity estimator spans approx. 6.3 orders ofmagnitude in l, and the slope of the correlation is positive with a probabilityof 1 - 9.3 x 10^-7 (4.9 sigma). independently of whether or not grb 980425should be included in the fit, its light curve is unique in that it is muchless variable than the other approx. 17 light curves in our sample for whichthe signal-to-noise is reasonably good.

astro-ph;0010545	completely dark galaxies: their existence, properties, and strategies  for finding them	there are a number of theoretical and observational hints that large numbersof low-mass galaxies composed entirely of dark matter exist in the field. thetheoretical considerations follow from the prediction of cold dark mattertheory that there exist many low-mass galaxies for every massive one. theobservational considerations follow from the observed paucity of these low-massgalaxies in the field but not in dense clusters of galaxies; this suggests thatthe lack of small galaxies in the field is due to the inhibition of starformation in the galaxies as opposed to the fact that their small dark matterhalos do not exist. in this work we outline the likely properties of low-massdark galaxies, and describe observational strategies for finding them, andwhere in the sky to search. the results are presented as a function of theglobal properties of dark matter, in particular the presence or absence of asubstantial baryonic dark matter component. if the dark matter is purely coldand has a navarro, frenk and white density profile, directly detecting darkgalaxies will only be feasible with present technology if the galaxy has amaximum velocity dispersion in excess of 70 km/s, in which case the darkgalaxies could strongly lens background objects. this is much higher than themaximum velocity dispersions in most dwarf galaxies. if the dark matter ingalaxy halos has a baryonic component close to the cosmic ratio, thepossibility of directly detecting dark galaxies is much more realistic; theoptimal method of detection will depend on the nature of the dark matter. anumber of more indirect methods are also discussed.

astro-ph;0010588	cosmic gamma-ray bursts as a probe of star formation history	the cosmic gamma-ray burst (grb) formation rate, as derived from thevariability-luminosity relation for long-duration grbs, is compared with thecosmic star formation rate. if grbs are related to the collapse of massivestars, one expects the grb rate to be approximately proportional to the starformation rate. we found that these two rates have similar slopes at lowredshift. this suggests that grbs do indeed track the star formation rate ofthe universe, which in turn implies that the formation rate of massive starsthat produce grbs is proportional to the total star formation rate. it alsoimplies that we might be able to use grbs as a probe of the cosmic starformation rate at high redshift. we find that the cosmic star formation rateinferred from the variability-luminosity relation increases steeply withredshift at z &gt; 3. this is in apparent contrast to what is derived frommeasurements of the cosmic star formation rate at high redshift from opticalobservations of field galaxies, suggesting that much high-z star formation isbeing missed in the optical surveys, even after corrections for dust extinctionhave been made.

astro-ph;0012396	winds from massive stars: implications for the afterglows of gamma-ray  bursts	recent observations suggest that long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) andtheir afterglows are produced by highly relativistic jets emitted incore-collapse explosions. the pre-explosive ambient medium provides a naturaltest for the most likely progenitors of grbs. those stars that shed theirenvelopes most readily have short jet crossing times and are more likely toproduce a grb. we construct a simple computational scheme to explore theexpected contribution of the presupernova ejecta of single wolf-rayet (wr)stars to the circumstellar environment. using detailed stellar tracks for theevolution of massive stars, we discuss the effects that the initial mainsequence mass, metallicity, rotation and membership in a binary system have onthe ambient medium. we extend the theory of grb afterglows in winds to considerthe effect of the relativistic fireball propagating through the wr ejecta. wemake specific predictions for the interaction of the relativistic blast wavewith the density bumps that arise when the progenitor star rapidly loses alarge fraction of its initial mass or when the ejected wind interacts with theexternal medium and decelerates. a re-brightening of the afterglow with aspectrum redder than the typical synchrotron spectrum (as seen in grb 970508,grb 980326 and grb 000911) is predicted. we also calculate the luminosity ofthe reflected echo that arises when circumstellar material compton-scatters theprompt radiation and examine the spectral signatures expected from theinteraction of the grb afterglow with the ejected medium.

astro-ph;0103239	extinction of gamma-ray burst afterglows as a diagnostic of the location  of cosmic star formation	the properties of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) and their afterglows are used toinvestigate the location of star formation activity through the history of theuniverse. this approach is motivated by the following: (i) grbs are thought tobe associated with the deaths of massive stars and so the grb rate ought tofollow the massive star formation rate, (ii) grbs are the final evolutionaryphase of these short-lived stars, which do not travel far from theirbirthplace, and so should be located where the stars formed, and (iii) thedifferential effects of dust extinction on grb afterglows between the x-ray andoptical wavebands can reveal whether or not large amounts of gas and dust arepresent in grb host galaxies. from recent evidence, we estimate that asignificant fraction (about 75%) of stars in the universe formed in galaxiesthat are brightest at rest-frame far-infrared (ir) wavelengths. this value ismarginally consistent with observations: 60 +/- 15% of grbs have no detectedoptical afterglow, whereas almost all have an x-ray afterglow. if the x-rayafterglows of a large number of grbs disappear at soft x-ray wavelengths (&lt;2kev), then this would provide strong evidence for dominant heavily obscuredstar-formation activity. far-ir and submillimetre studies of grb hosts wouldalso test this idea: about 20% of hosts should be detectable using scuba.

astro-ph;0108200	cosmological aspects of gamma-ray bursts: luminosity evolution and an  estimate of the star formation rate at high redshifts	using 220 gamma-ray burst (grb) redshifts and luminosities derived from theluminosity-variability relationship of fenimore &amp; ramirez-ruiz (2000), we showthat there exists a significant correlation between the grb luminosity andredshift. in particular, we find that the evolution of the average luminositycan be parameterized as l ~ (1+z)^(1.4 +- 0.5), where z is the burst redshift.we discuss the possible reasons behind this evolution and compare it to otherknown sources that exhibit similar behavior. in addition, we use non-parametricstatistical techniques to independently estimate the distributions of theluminosity and redshift of bursts, accounting for the evolution (in contrast toprevious studies which have assumed that the luminosity function is independentof redshift). we present these distributions and discuss their implications.most significantly, we find a co-moving rate density of grbs that continues toincrease to (1+z) ~ 10. from this estimate of the grb rate density, we then usethe population synthesis codes of fryer et al. (1999) to estimate the starformation rate at high redshifts, based on different progenitor models of grbs.we find that no matter what the progenitor or population synthesis model, thestar formation rate increases or remains constant to very high redshifts (z ~10).

astro-ph;0108324	iron k-alpha emission from x-ray reflection: predictions for gamma-ray  burst models	recent observations of several gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglows have shownevidence for a large amount of x-ray line emitting material, possibly arisingfrom ionized iron. a significant detection of an x-ray spectral feature, suchas that found in the chandra observation of grb 991216, may provide importantconstraints on the immediate environment of the burst and hence on progenitormodels. the large fe k-alpha equivalent widths inferred from the x-rayobservations favor models in which the line is produced when the primary x-rayemission from the source strikes thomson-thick material and compton scattersinto our line of sight. we present such reflection spectra here, computed in afully self-consistent manner, and discuss the range of ionization parametersthat may be relevant to different models of grbs. we argue that the presence ofa strong hydrogen-like k-alpha line is unlikely, because fe-xxvi photons wouldbe trapped resonantly and removed from the line core by compton scattering. incontrast, a strong narrow emission line from he-like fe-xxv is prominent in themodel spectra. we briefly discuss how these constraints may affect the lineenergy determination in grb 991216.

astro-ph;0203447	beam models for gamma-ray bursts sources: outflow structure, kinematics  and emission mechanisms	the variety of gamma-ray burst phenomenology could be largely attributable todifferences in the opening angle of an isotropic outflow or to a standard typeof event viewed from different orientations. motivated by this currentlypopular idea, we study the effects of varying the energy per unit solid anglein the unsteady expelled outflow by an increase either in the bulk lorentzfactor or in the baryon loading. we apply these models to interpret theobserved correlations between variability, luminosity and spectral peak energyand find that while the latter scenario fails to provide a good description,bursts produced by collisions between similar mass shells but with increasinglylarge lorentz factors are both more variable and have larger peak spectralenergies. we present detailed internal shock calculations confirming thisinterpretation and discuss the roles various timescales, radii and the opticalthickness of the wind play in determining this wide range of behaviors.finally, we discuss the variety of scenarios in which large variations of thesource expansion velocity are naturally expected.

astro-ph;0204350	gamma-ray bursts in normal and extreme star-forming galaxies	we discuss how gamma-ray burst (grb) optical afterglows and multiwavelengthobservations of their host galaxies can be used to obtain information about therelative amounts of star formation happening in optical and submillimetregalaxies. that such an analysis will be possible follows from thecurrently-favoured idea that grbs are closely linked with high-mass starformation. studying grb host galaxies offers a method of finding low-luminositysubmillimetre galaxies, which cannot be identified either in optical lymanbreak surveys, because so much of their star formation is hidden by dust, or insubmillimetre surveys, because their submillimetre fluxes are close to or belowthe confusion limit. much of the star formation in the universe could haveoccurred in such objects, so searching for them is an important exercise. fromcurrent observations, grb host galaxies appear to be neither optically-luminousclass-2 scuba galaxies like smm j02399$-$0136 or smm j14011+0252, nor galaxiescontaining dense molecular cores like local ultraluminous infrared galaxies(uligs), but rather some intermediate kind of galaxy. the host galaxy of grb980703 is a prototype of this kind of galaxy.

astro-ph;0205108	events in the life of a cocoon surrounding a light, collapsar jet	according to the collapsar model, gamma-ray bursts are thought to be producedin shocks that occur after the relativistic jet has broken free from thestellar envelope. if the mass density of the collimated outflow is less thanthat of the stellar envelope, the jet will then be surrounded by a cocoon ofrelativistic plasma. this material would itself be able to escape along thedirection of least resistance, which is likely to be the rotation axis of thestellar progenitor, and accelerate in approximately the same way as animpulsive fireball. we discuss how the properties of the stellar envelope havea decisive effect on the appearance of a cocoon propagating through it. therelativistic material that accumulated in the cocoon would have enough kineticenergy to substantially alter the structure of the relativistic outflow, if notin fact provide much of the observed explosive power. shock waves within thisplasma can produce gamma-ray and x-ray transients, in addition to the standardafterglow emission that would arise from the deceleration shock of the cocoonfireball.

astro-ph;0205127	on the spectral energy dependence of gamma-ray burst variability	the variable activity of a gamma-ray burst (grb) source is thought to becorrelated with its absolute peak luminosity - a relation that, if confirmed,can be used to derive an independent estimate of the redshift of a grb. we findthat bursts with highly variable light curves have greater nu-f_nu spectralpeak energies, when we transform these energies to the cosmological rest frameusing the redshift estimates derived either from optical spectral features orfrom the luminosity-variability distance indicator itself. this positivecorrelation between peak energy and variability spans ~ 2 orders of magnitudeand appears to accommodate grb 980425, lending credibility to the associationof this burst with sn 1998bw. the existence of such a correlation not onlyprovides an interesting clue to the nature of this luminosity indicator butpotentially reinforces the validity of the redshift estimates derived from thismethod. it also implies that the rest frame grb peak energy is correlated withthe intrinsic luminosity of the burst, as has been suggested in the past as anexplanation of the observed hardness-intensity correlation in grbs.

astro-ph;0206011	accretion disks around black holes: dynamical evolution, meridional  circulations and gamma ray bursts	we study the hydrodynamical evolution of massive accretion disks around blackholes, formed when a neutron star is disrupted by a black hole in a binarysystem. initial conditions are taken from 3d calculations of coalescingbinaries. assuming azimuthal symmetry, we follow the time dependence of thedisk structure for 0.2 seconds. we use an ideal gas e.o.s., and assume that allthe dissipated energy is radiated away. the disks evolve due to viscousstresses, modeled with an alpha law. we study the disk structure, and thestrong meridional circulations that are established and persist throughout ourcalculations. these consist of strong outflows along the equatorial plane thatreverse direction close to the surface of the disk and converge on theaccretor. in the context of grbs, we estimate the energy released from thesystem in neutrinos and through magnetic-dominated mechanisms, and find it canbe as high as 10^52 erg and 10^51 erg respectively, during an estimatedtimescale of 0.1-0.2 seconds. neutrino-anti neutrino annihilation is likely toproduce bursts from only an impulsive energy input (the annihilation luminosityscales as t^(-5/2)) and so would be unable to account for a large fraction ofbursts with complicated light curves. however a gas mass ~0.1-0.25 msunsurvives in the orbiting debris, enabling strong magnetic fields (~10^16 gauss)to be anchored in the dense matter long enough to power short grbs. we alsoinvestigate the continuous energy injection that arises as the black holeslowly swallows the rest of the disk and discuss its consequences on the grbafterglow emission.

astro-ph;0207576	jets, winds and bursts from coalescing neutron stars	recent high-resolution calculations of neutron star coalescences are used toinvestigate whether nu bar{nu} annihilation can provide sufficient energy topower gamma-ray bursts, especially those belonging to the short durationcategory. late time slices of the simulations, where the neutrino emission hasreached a maximum, stationary level are analyzed to address this question. wefind that nu bar{nu} annihilation can provide the necessary driving stressesthat lead to relativistic jet expansion. maximum lorentz factors of the orderof 15 are found along the binary rotation axis, but larger values are expectedto arise from higher numerical resolution. yet the accompanying neutrino-drivenwind must be absent from the axis when the burst occurs or prohibitive baryonloading may occur. we argue that even under the most favorable conditions, nubar{nu} annihilation is unlikely to power a burst in excess of ~ 10^{48} erg.unless the emission is beamed into less than one percent of the solid angle,which we argue is improbable if it is collimated by gas pressure, this may failto satisfy the apparent isotropic energies inferred at cosmological distances.this mechanism may nonetheless drive a precursor fireball, thereby evacuating acavity into which a later magnetic driven jet could expand. a large range oftime delays between the merger and the black hole formation are to be expected.if the magnetic driven jet occurs after the black hole has formed, a time spanas long as weeks could pass between the neutrino powered precursor and themagnetic driven grb.

astro-ph;0306418	high resolution calculations of merging neutron stars iii: gamma-ray  bursts	recent three dimensional, high-resolution simulations of neutron starcoalescences are analysed to assess whether short gamma-ray bursts (grbs) couldoriginate from such encounters. the two most popular modes of energy extraction-- namely the annihilation of $\nu\bar{\nu}$ and magnetohydrodynamic processes-are explored in order to investigate their viability in launching grbs. we findthat $\nu\bar{\nu}$ annihilation can provide the necessary stresses to drive ahighly relativistic expansion. but unless the outflow is beamed into less thanone percent of the solid angle this mechanism may fail to explain the apparentisotropized energies implied for short grbs at cosmological distances. we arguethat the energetic, neutrino-driven wind that accompanies the merger event willhave enough pressure to provide adequate collimation to the$\nu\bar{\nu}$-annihilation-driven jet, thereby comfortably satisfyingconstraints on event rate and apparent luminosity. we also assess magneticmechanisms to transform the available energy into a grb. if the central objectdoes not collapse immediately into a black hole it will be convective and it isexpected to act as an effective large scale dynamo amplifying the seed magneticfields to a few times $10^{17}$ g within a small fraction of a second. theassociated spindown time scale is 0.2 s, coinciding with the typical durationof a short grb. the efficiencies of the various assessed magnetic processes arehigh enough to produce isotropized luminosities in excess of $10^{52}$ ergs/seven without beaming.

0808.3448	the hydrodynamics of gamma-ray burst remnants	this paper reports on the results of a numerical investigation designed toaddress how the initially anisotropic appearance of a grb remnant is modifiedby the character of the circumburst medium and by the possible presence of anaccompanying supernova (sn). axisymmetric hydrodynamical calculations of light,impulsive jets propagating in both uniform and inhomogeneous external media arepresented, which show that the resulting dynamics of their remnants since theonset of the non-relativistic phase is different from the standard self-similarsolutions. because massive star progenitors are expected to have their close-insurroundings modified by the progenitor winds, we consider both free winds andshocked winds as possible external media for grb remnant evolution. abundantconfirmation is provided here of the important notion that the morphology andvisibility of grb remnants are determined largely by their circumstellarenvironments. for this reason, their detectability is highly biased in favor ofthose with massive star progenitors; although, in this class of models, thebeamed component may be difficult to identify because the grb ejecta iseventually swept up by the accompanying sn. the number density of asymmetricgrb remnants in the local universe could be, however, far larger if they expandin a tenuous interstellar medium, as expected for some short grb progenitormodels. in these sources, the late size of the observable, asymmetric remnantcould extend over a wide, possibly resolvable angle and may be easier toconstrain directly.

astro-ph;0311463	formation rates of core collapse sne and grbs	we study the evolution of stars that may be the progenitors of long-softgamma-ray burst (grbs) -- rotating naked helium stars presumed to have losttheir envelopes to winds or companions. our aim is to investigate the formationand development of single and binary systems and from this population evaluatethe rates of interesting individual species. using a rapid binary evolutionalgorithm, that enables us to model the most complex binary systems and toexplore the effect of metallicity on grb production, we draw the followingconclusions. first we find that, if we include an approximate treatment ofangular momentum transport by mass loss, the resulting spin rates for singlestars become too low to form a centrifugally supported disc that can drive agrb engine. second massive stars in binaries result in enough angular momentum-- due to spin-orbit tidal interactions -- to form a centrifugally supporteddisc and are thus capable of supplying a sufficient number of progenitors. thisholds true even if only a small fraction of bursts are visible to a givenobserver and the grb rate is several hundred times larger than the observedrate. third low-metallicity stars aid the formation of a rapidly rotating,massive helium cores at collapse and so their evolution is likely to beaffected by the local properties of the ism. this effect could increase the grbformation rate by a factor of 5-7 at z=z_solar/200. finally we quantify theeffects of mass loss, common-envelope evolution and black-hole formation andshow that more stringent constraints to many of these evolution parameters areneeded in order to draw quantitative conclusions from population synthesiswork.

astro-ph;0403039	identifying young gamma-ray burst fossils	the recent reports of temporal and spectral peculiarities in the early stagesof some afterglows suggest that we may be wrong in postulating a central enginewhich becomes dormant after the burst itself. a continually decreasingpostburst relativistic outflow, such as put out by a decaying magnetar, maycontinue to be emitted for periods of days or longer, and we argue that it canbe efficiently reprocessed by the ambient soft photon field radiation. photonsproduced either by the postexplosion expansion of the progenitor stellarenvelope or by a binary companion provide ample targets for the relativisticoutflow to interact and produce high energy gamma-rays. the resultant signalmay yield luminosities high enough to be detected with the recently launchedintegral and the glast experiment now under construction. its detection willsurely offer important clues for identifying the nature of the progenitor andpossibly constraining whether some route other than single star evolution isinvolved in producing a rapidly rotating helium core which in turn, atcollapse, triggers a burst.

astro-ph;0403421	the case for a misaligned relativistic jet from sn 2001em	sn 2001em, identified as a type ic supernova, has recently been detected inthe radio and x-rays, $\gtrsim$ 2 yr after the explosion. the high luminositiesat such late times might arise from a relativistic jet viewed substantiallyoff-axis that becomes visible only when it turns mildly relativistic and itsemission is no longer strongly beamed away from us. alternatively, the emissionmight originate from the interaction of the sn shell with the circumstellarmedium. we find that the latter scenario is hard to reconcile with the observedrapid rise in the radio flux and optically thin spectrum,$f_\nu\propto\nu^{-0.36\pm 0.16}t^{1.9\pm 0.4}$, while these features arisenaturally from a misaligned relativistic jet. the high x-ray luminosityprovides an independent and more robust constraint -- it requires $\sim10^{51}$ erg in mildly relativistic ejecta. the source should thereforecurrently have a large angular size ($\sim$ 2 mas) which could be resolved inthe radio with vlba. it is also expected to be bipolar and is thus likely toexhibit a large degree of linear polarization ($\sim 10%-20%$). the presence ofa relativistic outflow in sn 2001em would have interesting implications. itwould suggest that several percent of sne ib/c produce mildly relativisticjets, with an initial lorentz factor $\gamma_0\gtrsim 2$, while the fractionthat produce grb jets (with $\gamma_0\gtrsim 100$) is $\sim 100$ times smaller.this could considerably increase the expected number of transients similar toorphan grb afterglows in the radio, and to a lesser extent in the optical andx-rays, if there is a continuous distribution in $\gamma_0$. furthermore, thismay give further credence to the idea that core collapse sne, and in particularsne type ib/c, are triggered by bipolar jets.

astro-ph;0405123	compton echoes from gamma-ray bursts: unveiling misaligned jets in  nearby type ib/c supernovae	there is now compelling evidence of a link between long-duration gamma-raybursts (grbs) and type ib/c supernovae (sne). these core-collapse explosionsare conjectured to radiate an anisotropic, beamed component associated with adecelerating, relativistic outflow and an unbeamed, isotropic componentassociated with the slowly expanding stellar debris. the anisotropic emissionremains at a very low level until the doppler cone of the beam intersects theobserver's line of sight, making off-axis grb jets directly detectable only atlong wavelengths and late times. circumstellar material, however, will comptonscatter the prompt gamma-ray and afterglow radiation flux and give rise to areflection echo. we show that the compton echo of a misaligned grb carries anx-ray luminosity that may exceed by many orders of magnitude that produced bythe underlying subrelativistic sn during the first few weeks. bright scatteringechoes may therefore provide a means for detecting a population of misalignedgrbs associated with nearby type ib/c sne and yield crucial information on theenvironment surrounding a massive star at the time of its death. the questionof whether the interpretation of grb980425 as an ordinary grb observed off-axisis consistent with the lack of an x-ray echo is addressed, along with theconstraints derived on the possible existence of misaligned grb jets insn1993j, sn1994i, sn1999em, and sn2002ap.

0808.3847	the star ingesting luminosity of intermediate mass black holes in  globular clusters	the dynamics of stars in the inner regions of nearby globular clusters (gcs)such as g1 indicate the presence of central concentrated dark masses, and onewould like to know whether these are indeed intermediate mass black holes(imbhs). as the number of surrounding stars, and their motions, are roughlyknown, the capture rate can be estimated; the question then arises of whetherthe apparent quiescence of the nuclei of these gcs is compatible with theimbh's presence. the role of debris from disrupted stars in activatingquiescent nuclei of gcs is studied here employing three-dimensionalhydrodynamics simulations. it is argued that when individual stars aredisrupted, the bulk of the debris would be swallowed or expelled rapidlycompared with the interval between successive disruptions. only a smallfraction of the tightly bound mass is likely to be swallowed, yieldingradiation with high efficiency, the surplus being expelled in aradiation-driven wind. a transient (predominantly of soft x-ray emission)signal could persist steadily with l ~ l_edd =10^{41}(m_h/10^3m_sun) erg/s forat most tens of years; thereafter the flare would rapidly fade. while theinfall rate declines as t^{-5/3}, some material may be stored for a longer timein an accretion disk. the imbh luminosity could then remain as high as l_x &gt;10^{39} erg/s for several hundreds of years after disruption. in a givenobject, this ultraluminous x-ray activity would have a duty cycle of order10^{-4}. quiescent gcs, those with imbhs now starved of fuel, should greatlyoutnumber active ones; observational constraints would not then be stringentuntil we had observed enough candidates to constitute a proper ensembleaverage.(abridged)

astro-ph;0407051	supernova 1993j: a veiled pulsar in a binary system?	the recent report of a binary companion to the progenitor of supernova 1993jmay provide important clues for identifying the nature of the nascent compactobject. given the estimates of the progenitor mass, the potential power sourceis probably a pulsar rather than an accreting black hole. if there is a pulsar,one would expect the rotational luminosity to be stored and reprocessed by thesupernova remnant, but no pulsar nebula has yet been seen. the lack ofdetection of an x-ray synchrotron nebula should be taken as strong evidenceagainst the presence of a bright pulsar. this is because absorption by thesurrounding supernova gas should be negligible for the light of the companionstar to have been detected. a model is developed here for the luminosity of thepulsar nebula in sn 1993j, which is then used to predict the spin-down power ofthe putative pulsar. if one exists, it can be providing no more than about 6 x10^{39} erg/s. with an initial rotation period of 10-30 ms, as extrapolatedfrom young galactic pulsars, the nascent neutron star can have either a weakmagnetic field, b &lt; 10^{11} g, or one so strong, b &gt; 10^{15} g, that its spinwas rapidly slowed down. the companion star, if bound to the neutron star,should provide ample targets for the pulsar wind to interact and producehigh-energy gamma-rays. the expected non-pulsed, gev signal is calculated; itcould be detected by current and future experiments provided that the pulsarwind velocity is similar to that of the crab nebula.

astro-ph;0410560	a deep search with hst for late time supernova signatures in the hosts  of xrf 011030 and xrf 020427	x-ray flashes (xrfs) are, like gamma-ray bursts (grbs), thought to signal thecollapse of massive stars in distant galaxies. many models posit that theisotropic equivalent energies of xrfs are lower than those for grbs, such thatthey are visible from a reduced range of distances when compared with grbs.here we present the results of two epoch hubble space telescope imaging of twoxrfs. these images taken approximately 45 and 200 days post burst reveal noevidence for an associated supernova in either case. supernovae such as sn1998bw would have been visible out to z ~1.5 in each case, while faintersupernovae such as sn 2002ap would have been visible to z ~ 1. if the xrfs lieat such large distances, their energies would not fit the observed correlationbetween the grb peak energy and isotropic energy release, in which soft burstsare less energetic. we conclude that, should these xrfs reside at low redshifts($z&lt;0.6$), either their line of sight is heavily extinguished, or they areassociated with extremely faint supernovae, or, unlike grbs, these xrfs do nothave temporally coincident supernovae.

astro-ph;0502300	afterglow observations shed new light on the nature of x-ray flashes	x-ray flashes (xrfs) and x-ray rich gamma-ray bursts (xrgrbs) share manyobservational characteristics with long duration grbs, but the reason for whichtheir prompt emission peaks at lower photon energies, $e_p$, is still underdebate. although many different models have been invoked in order to explainthe lower $e_p$ values, their implications for the afterglow emission were notconsidered in most cases, mainly because observations of xrf afterglows havebecome available only recently. here we examine the predictions of the variousxrf models for the afterglow emission, and test them against the observationsof xrf 030723 and xrgrb 041006, the events with the best monitored afterglowlight curves in their respective class. we show that most existing xrf modelsare hard to reconcile with the observed afterglow light curves, which are veryflat at early times. such light curves are, however, naturally produced by aroughly uniform jet with relatively sharp edges that is viewed off-axis (i.e.from outside of the jet aperture). this type of model self consistentlyaccommodates both the observed prompt emission and the afterglow light curvesof xrgrb 041006 and xrf 030723, implying viewing angles $\theta_{obs}$ from thejet axis of $(\theta_{obs}-\theta_0)\sim 0.15\theta_0$ and $\sim \theta_0$,respectively, where $\theta_0\sim 3$ deg is the jet half-opening angle. thissuggests that grbs, xrgrbs and xrfs are intrinsically similar relativistic jetsviewed from different angles, corresponding to $\gamma(\theta_{obs}-\theta_0)$of less than 1, between 1 and a few, and more than a few, respectively, where$\gamma$ is the lorentz factor. future observations with swift could help testthis unification scheme in which grbs, xrgrbs and xrfs share the same basicphysics and differ only by their orientation relative to our line of sight.

astro-ph;0504257	supernovae and gamma-ray bursts powered by hot neutrino-cooled coronae	cosmological explosions such as core-collapse supernovae (sne) and gamma-raybursts (grbs) are thought to be powered by the rapid conversion of roughly asolar mass' worth of gravitational binding energy into a comparatively smallamount of outgoing observable kinetic energy. a fractional absorption of theemitted neutrinos, the particles which carry away the binding energy, by theexpelled matter is a widely discussed mechanism for powering such explosions.previous work addressing neutrino emission from core-collapse like environmentsassumes that the outgoing neutrino spectrum closely resembles a black bodywhose effective temperature is determined by both the rate of energy releaseand the surface area of the entire body. unfortunately, this assumptionminimizes the net efficiency for both neutrino-driven explosion mechanisms.motivated by this fact, we qualitatively outline a scenario where a hot coronadeforms the neutrino spectrum away from that of a cool thermal emitter. ourprimary result is that in principle, a coronal-driven explosion mechanism canenhance the net efficiency of neutrino-driven sne and grbs by more than anorder of magnitude.

astro-ph;0505496	the redshift distribution of gamma-ray bursts revisited	in this letter, we calculate the redshift distribution of gamma-ray burstsassuming that they trace (i) the globally averaged star formation rate or (ii)the average metallicity in the universe. while at redshifts 5 and below, boththe star formation rate and metallicity are observationally determined modulosome uncertainties, at higher redshifts there are few constraints. weextrapolate the star formation rate and metallicity to higher redshifts andexplore models that are broadly consistent with bounds on the optical depthfrom wmap results. in addition, we also include parametric descriptions of theluminosity function, and the typical spectrum for grbs. with these essentialingredients included in the modeling, we find that a substantial fraction 75%of grbs are expected to originate at redshifts below 4, in variance with someprevious estimates. conversely, if we assume as expected for the collapsarmodel that gamma-ray bursts favour a low metallicity environment and therefore,relate the grb rate to a simple model of the average metallicity as a functionof redshift, we find that a higher fraction of bursts, about 40% originate fromredshifts greater than 4. we conclude with the implications of swift grbdetections.

astro-ph;0506121	dynamical evolution of neutrino--cooled accretion disks: detailed  microphysics, lepton-driven convection, and global energetics	we present a detailed, two dimensional numerical study of the microphysicalconditions and dynamical evolution of accretion disks around black holes whenneutrino emission is the main source of cooling. such structures are likely toform after the gravitational collapse of massive rotating stellar cores, or thecoalescence of two compact objects in a binary (e.g., the hulse--taylorsystem). the physical composition is determined self consistently byconsidering two regimes: neutrino--opaque and neutrino--transparent, with adetailed equation of state which takes into account neutronization, nuclearstatistical equilibrium of a gas of free nucleons and alpha particles,blackbody radiation and a relativistic fermi gas of arbitrary degeneracy.various neutrino emission processes are considered, with electron/positroncapture onto free nucleons providing the dominant contribution to the coolingrate. we find that important temporal and spatial scales, related to theoptically thin/optically thick transition are present in the disk, and manifestthemselves clearly in the energy output in neutrinos. this transition producesan inversion of the lepton gradient in the innermost regions of the flow whichdrives convective motions, and affects the density and disk scale height radialprofiles. the electron fraction remains low in the region close to the blackhole, and if preserved in an outflow, could give rise to heavy elementnucleosynthesis. our specific initial conditions arise from the binary mergercontext, and so we explore the implications of our results for the productionof gamma ray bursts.

astro-ph;0509307	accretion modes in collapsars - prospects for grb production	we explore low angular momentum accretion flows onto black holes formed afterthe collapse of massive stellar cores. in particular, we consider the state ofthe gas falling quasi-spherically onto stellar-mass black holes in thehypercritical regime, where the accretion rates are in the range 0.001 - 0.5solar masses per second and neutrinos dominate the cooling. previous studieshave assumed that in order to have a black hole switch to a luminous state, thecondition l &gt;&gt; r_g c, where l is the specific orbital angular momentum of theinfalling gas and r_g is the schwarszchild radius, needs to be fulfilled. weargue that flows in hyperaccreting, stellar mass disks around black holes arelikely to transition to a highly radiative state when their angular momentum isjust above the threshold for disk formation, l ~ 2 r_g c. in a range where llies between r_g c and 2 r_g c, a dwarf disk forms in which gas spirals rapidlyinto the black hole due to general relativistic effects, without any help fromhorizontal viscous stresses. for high rotation rates with l greater than 2 r_gc, the luminosity is supplied by large, hot equatorial bubbles around the blackhole. the highest neutrino luminosities are obtained for l ~ 2 r_g c, and thisvalue of angular momentum also produces the most energetic neutrinos, and thusalso the highest energy deposition rates. given the range of l explored in thiswork, we argue that, as long as l is greater than 2 r_g c, low angular momentumcores may in fact be better suited for producing neutrino--driven explosionsfollowing core collapse in supernovae and gamma ray bursts.

astro-ph;0601622	deducing the lifetime of short gamma-ray burst progenitors from host  galaxy demography	the frequency of short gamma-ray bursts (grbs) in galaxies with distinct starformation histories can be used to constrain the lifetime of the progenitorsystems. as an illustration, we consider here the constraints that can bederived from separating the host galaxies into early and late types. onaverage, early-type galaxies have their stars formed earlier than late-typegalaxies, and this difference, together with the time delay between progenitorformation and short grb outburst, leads to different burst rates in the twotypes of hosts. presently available data suggest, but not yet prove, that thelocal short grb rate in early-type galaxies may be comparable to that inlate-type galaxies. this suggests that, unlike type ia supernovae, at leasthalf of the short grb progenitors that can outburst within a hubble time havelifetimes greater than about 7 gyr. models of the probability distribution oftime delays, here parametrized as p(\tau) \propto \tau^n, with n &gt; -1 arefavored. this apparent long time delay and the fact that early-type galaxies inclusters make a substantial contribution to the local stellar mass inventorycan explain the observed preponderance of short grbs in galaxy clusters.

astro-ph;0608313	no supernovae associated with two long-duration gamma ray bursts	it is now accepted that long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are producedduring the collapse of a massive star. the standard "collapsar" model predictsthat a broad-lined and luminous type ic core-collapse supernova (sn)accompanies every long-duration grb. this association has been confirmed inobservations of several nearby grbs. here we present observations of two nearbylong-duration grbs that challenge this simple view. in the grbs 060505 and060614 we demonstrate that no sn emission accompanied these long-durationbursts, down to limits hundreds of times fainter than the archetypal sn 1998bwthat accompanied grb 980425, and fainter than any type ic sn ever observed.multi-band observations of the early afterglows, as well as spectroscopy of thehost galaxies, exclude the possibility of significant dust obscuration and showthat the bursts originated in star-forming regions. the absence of a sn to suchdeep limits is qualitatively different from all previous nearby long grbs andsuggests a new phenomenological type of massive stellar death. from thesupplementary material: now we have observed sn-less grbs in star-formingregions, suggesting that a non-detection of a sn does not preclude a massiveprogenitor. the position of the grb, i.e. in a star-forming region or in anolder component, may be the only way to discriminate between merging compactobjects and massive stars as progenitors. in fact, several host galaxies forshort grbs have been found to be as actively star-forming as some host galaxiesof long-duration grbs. the grb labels "long" and "short" have become synonymouswith "massive stars" and "other progenitors". these distinctions may need to berelaxed.

astro-ph;0608379	a simple test of the external shock model for the prompt emission in  gamma-ray bursts	it is demonstrated here that if the prompt grb emission is produced by thesimplest version of the external shock model, a specific relation shouldprevail between the observed duration, isotropic equivalent energy, and photonpeak energy. in essence, this relation arises because both the burst durationand the typical energy of the emitted synchrotron photons depend on the samecombination of the, usually poorly constrained, external density at thedeceleration radius, $n_{dec}$, and initial bulk lorentz factor, $\gamma_0$.this has the fortunate consequence of making the relation independent of both$\gamma_0$ and $n_{dec}$. unless the efficiency of electron acceleration isvery low, synchrotron gamma-rays from the external shock would fail to meet thecurrent observational constraints for the vast majority of grbs, includingthose with a smooth, single peak temporal profile. this argues either againstan external shock origin for the prompt emission in grbs or for changes in ourunderstanding of the microphysical and radiation processes occurring within theshocked region.

0811.1370	three-dimensional simulations of tidally disrupted solar-type stars and  the observational signatures of shock breakout	we describe a three-dimensional simulation of a $1 m_{\odot}$ solar-type starapproaching a $10^{6} m_{\odot}$ black hole on a parabolic orbit with apericenter distance well within the tidal radius. while falling towards theblack hole, the star is not only stretched along the orbital direction but evenmore severely compressed at right angles to the orbit. the overbearing degreeof compression achieved shortly after pericenter leads to the production ofstrong shocks which largely homogenize the temperature profile of the star,resulting in surface temperatures comparable to the initial temperature of thestar's core. this phenomenon, which precedes the fallback accretion phase,gives rise to a unique double-peaked x-ray signature that, if detected, may beone of the few observable diagnostics of how stars behave under the influenceof strong gravitational fields. if $\sim 10^{6} m_{\odot}$ black holes wereprevalent in small or even dwarf galaxies, the nearest of such flares may bedetectable by exist from no further away than the virgo cluster.
