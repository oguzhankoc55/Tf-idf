0901.2499	the nature of the asca/integral source ax j183039-1002: a new  compton-thick agn?	we report on the identification of the x/soft gamma-ray source axj183039-1002 detected with asca and integral/ibis. the source, which has anobserved 20-100 kev flux of about 8.6 x 10^-11 erg/cm^2/s, is inside a diffuseradio supernova remnant (snr) and is spatially coincident with a compact radiosource. we analyzed archival chandra and xmm-newton observations in order toidentify the asca/integral source. a point-like chandra x-ray object was foundto be positionally coincident with the compact radio source and within theerror circle of the asca and integral sources. although the association of acompact radio/x-ray source with a radio supernova remnant could be indicativeof a pulsar wind nebula (pwn), the xmm-newton x-ray spectrum is compatible withan absorbed, seyfert-2 like agn, since it provides evidence for an ironemission line of about 1 kev equivalent width; furthermore the x-ray sourcespectrum is similar to that of other compton thick agn where the &lt;2 kev dataare associated to a warm reflector and the &gt;10 kev one to a cold reflector.

0903.5218	high energy emission and polarisation limits for the integral burst grb  061122	(abridged) grb 061122 is one of the brightest grbs detected within integral'sfield of view to date. the two gamma-ray detectors on integral were used toinvestigate the spectral characteristics of grb 061122. a search for linearpolarisation in the prompt emission was carried out using the spi multipleevent data in the energy range 100 kev-1 mev.  the prompt spectrum was best fit by a combination of a blackbody and apower--law model (the quasithermal model), with evidence for high energyemission continuing above 8 mev. a pseudo-redshift value of pz = 0.95 +/- 0.18was determined using the spectral fit parameters. the isotropic energy at thispseudo-redshift is 8.5 x 10^{52} erg. the jet opening angle was estimated to besmaller than 2.8 deg or larger than 11.9 deg from the x-ray lightcurve. anupper limit of 60% polarisation was determined for the prompt emission of grb061122, using the multiple event data.  the high energy emission observed in the spectrum may be due to the reverseshock interacting with the grb ejecta when it is decelerated by the circumburstmedium. this behaviour has been observed in a small fraction of grbs to date,but is expected to be more commonly observed by the fermi gamma-ray spacetelescope. the conditions for polarisation are met if the jet opening angle isless than 2.8 deg, but further constraints on the level of polarisation are notpossible.

0706.3460	the agn nature of 11 out of 12 swift/rxte unidentified sources through  optical and x-ray spectroscopy	the swift burst alert telescope (bat) is performing a high galactic latitudesurvey in the 14-195 kev band at a flux limit of ~10^{-11} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1},leading to the discovery of new high energy sources, most of which have not sofar been properly classified. a similar work has also been performed with therxte slew survey leading to the discovery of 68 sources detected above 8 kev,many of which are still unclassified. follow-up observations with the swiftx-ray telescope (xrt) provide, for many of these objects, source localizationwith a positional accuracy of few arcsec, thus allowing the search for opticalcounterparts to be more efficient and reliable. we present the results ofoptical/x-ray follow-up studies of 11 swift bat detections and one agn detectedin the rxte slew survey, aimed at identifying their counterparts and atassessing their nature. these data allowed, for the first time, the opticalclassification of 8 objects and a distance determination for 3 of them. foranother object, a more refined optical classification than that available inthe literature is also provided. for the remaining sources, opticalspectroscopy provides a characterization of the source near in time to thex-ray measurement. the sample consists of 6 seyfert 2 galaxies, 5 seyferts ofintermediate type 1.2-1.8, and one object of galactic nature - an intermediatepolar (i.e., magnetic) cataclysmic variable. out of the 11 agns, 8 (~70%)including 2 seyferts of type 1.2 and 1.5, are absorbed with nh &gt; 10^{22}cm^{-2}. up to 3 objects could be compton thick (i.e. nh &gt; 1.5 x 10^{24}cm^{-2}), but only in one case (swift j0609.1-8636) does all the observationalevidence strongly suggests this possibility.

0909.5345	accurate classification of 17 agns detected with swift/bat	through an optical campaign performed at 5 telescopes located in the northernand the southern hemispheres, plus archival data from two on line sky surveys,we have obtained optical spectroscopy for 17 counterparts of suspected orpoorly studied hard x-ray emitting active galactic nuclei (agns) detected withswift/bat in order to determine or better classify their nature. we find that 7sources of our sample are type 1 agns, 9 are type 2 agns, and 1 object is anx-ray bright optically normal galaxy; the redshifts of these objects lie in arange between 0.012 and 0.286. for all these sources, x-ray data analysis wasalso performed to estimate their absorption column and to search for possiblecompton thick candidates. among our type 2 objects, we did not find any clearcompton thick agn, but at least 6 out of 9 of them are highly absorbed (n_h &gt;10^23 cm^-2), while one does not require intrinsic absorption; i.e., it appearsto be a naked seyfert 2 galaxy.

0910.0954	hard x-ray properties of magnetic cataclysmic variables	hard x-ray surveys have proven remarkably efficient in detecting intermediatepolars and asynchronous polars, two of the rarest type of cataclysmic variable(cv). here we present a global study of hard x-ray selected intermediate polarsand asynchronous polars, focusing particularly on the link between hard x-rayproperties and spin/orbital periods. to this end, we first construct a newsample of these objects by cross-correlating candidate sources detected inintegral/ibis observations against catalogues of known cvs. we find 23cataclysmic variable matches, and also present an additional 9 (of which 3 aredefinite) likely magnetic cataclysmic variables (mcvs) identified by othersthrough optical follow-ups of ibis detections. we also include in our analysishard x-ray observations from swift/bat and suzaku/hxd in order to make ourstudy more complete. we find that most hard x-ray detected mcvs havep_{spin}/p_{orb}&lt;0.1 above the period gap. in this respect we also point outthe very low number of detected systems in any band betweenp_{spin}/p_{orb}=0.3 and p_{spin}/p_{orb}=1 and the apparent peak of thep_{spin}/p_{orb} distribution at about 0.1. the observational features of thep_{spin} - p_{orb} plane are discussed in the context of mcv evolutionscenarios. we also present for the first time evidence for correlations betweenhard x-ray spectral hardness and p_{spin}, p_{orb} and p_{spin}/p_{orb}. anattempt to explain the observed correlations is made in the context of mcvevolution and accretion footprint geometries on the white dwarf surface.

1006.4513	unveiling the nature of integral objects through optical spectroscopy.  viii. identification of 44 newly detected hard x-ray sources	(abridged) hard x-ray surveys performed by the integral satellite havediscovered a conspicuous fraction (up to 30%) of unidentified objects among thedetected sources. here we continue our identification program by selectingprobable optical candidates using positional cross-correlation with soft x-ray,radio, and/or optical archives, and performing optical spectroscopy on them. asa result, we identified or more accurately characterized 44 counterparts ofintegral sources: 32 active galactic nuclei, with redshift 0.019 &lt; z &lt; 0.6058,6 cataclysmic variables (cvs), 5 high-mass x-ray binaries (2 of which in thesmall magellanic cloud), and 1 low-mass x-ray binary. this was achieved byusing 7 telescopes of various sizes and archival data from two onlinespectroscopic surveys. the main physical parameters of these hard x-ray sourceswere also determined using the available multiwavelength information. agns arethe most abundant population among hard x-ray objects, and our results confirmthis tendency when optical spectroscopy is used as an identification tool. thedeeper sensitivity of recent integral surveys enables one to begin detectinghard x-ray emission above 20 kev from sources such as liner-type agns andnon-magnetic cvs.

1010.5713	an x-ray view of the integral/ibis blazars	aim of this work is a broad-band study with integral, swift and xmm-newtonsatellites of a sample of 9 blazars (7 fsrq and 2 bl lac) with redshift up toabout 4. the spectral analysis has shown clear evidence of a flattening of thecontinuum towards the low energies ($e&lt;3$ kev observer frame). this behaviouris well reproduced both with an absorbed power-law model($n_h\sim10^{20}$-$10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ in the rest-frame of the sources) or abroken power-law continuum model (with an energy break below 3 kev in theobserver-frame). no compton reflection features, fe $k\alpha$ line and hump athigh energies, have been detected, with the exception of the source igrj22517+2218 that shows the presence of a weak iron line. in this work we alsoinvestigate a possible correlation between the absorption column density $n_h$and the red-shift. we confirm the existence of a $n_h$-z trend, with the higherabsorption at z$&gt;$2 for a larger sample compared to previous results. thedistribution of the $n_h$ and the photon index $\gamma$ is also presented. thehard x-ray data allow us to detect highly absorbed sources (with$n_h\ge10^{23}$cm$^{-2}$ in rest-frame of the source) characterized by photonindex distribution peaked at harder values ($\gamma\sim1.4$) with respect tothat obtained with xmm data only ($\gamma\sim2$).

0709.1895	broadband x-ray spectrum of the newly discovered broad line radio galaxy  igr j21247+5058	in this paper we present radio and high energy observations of the integralsource igr j21247+5058, a broad line emitting galaxy obscured by the galacticplane. archival vla radio data indicate that igr j21247+5058 can be classifiedas an frii broad line radio galaxy. the spectrum between 610 mhz and 15 ghz istypical of synchrotron self-absorbed radiation with a peak at 8 ghz and a lowenergy turnover; the core fraction is 0.1 suggestive of a moderate dopplerboosting of the base of the jet. the high energy broad-band spectrum wasobtained by combining xmm-newton and swift/xrt observation with integral/ibisdata. the 0.4-100 kev spectrum is well described by a power law, with slope$\gamma$=1.5, characterised by complex absorption due to two layers of materialpartially covering the source and a high energy cut-off around 70-80 kev.features such as a narrow iron line and a compton reflection component, ifpresent, are weak, suggesting that reprocessing of the power law photons in theaccretion disk plays a negligible role in the source.

1201.1906	unveiling the nature of integral objects through optical spectroscopy.  ix. 22 more identifications, and a glance into the far hard x-ray universe	(abridged) since its launch in october 2002, the integral satellite hasrevolutionized our knowledge of the hard x-ray sky thanks to its unprecedentedimaging capabilities and source detection positional accuracy above 20 kev.nevertheless, many of the newly-detected sources in the integral sky surveysare of unknown nature. the combined use of available information at longerwavelengths (mainly soft x-rays and radio) and of optical spectroscopy on theputative counterparts of these new hard x-ray objects allows us to pinpointtheir exact nature. continuing our long-standing program that has been runningsince 2004, and using 6 different telescopes of various sizes, we report theclassification through optical spectroscopy of 22 more unidentified or poorlystudied high-energy sources detected with the ibis instrument onboard integral.we found that 16 of them are active galactic nuclei (agns), while the remaining6 objects are within our galaxy. among the identified extragalactic sources, 14are type 1 agns; of these, 6 lie at redshift larger than 0.5 and one has z =3.12, which makes it the second farthest object detected in the integralsurveys up to now. the remaining agns are of type 2, and one of them is a pairof interacting seyfert 2 galaxies. the galactic objects are identified as twocataclysmic variables, one high-mass x-ray binary, one symbiotic binary and twochromospherically active stars. we thus still find that agns are the mostabundant population among hard x-ray objects identified through opticalspectroscopy. moreover, we note that the higher sensitivity of the more recentintegral surveys is now enabling the detection of high-redshift agns, thusallowing the exploration of the most distant hard x-ray emitting sources andpossibly of the most extreme blazars.

0711.0648	integral observations of psr j1811-1925 and its associated pulsar wind  nebula	we present spectral measurements made in the soft (20-100 kev) gamma-ray bandof the region containing the composite supernova remnant g11.2-0.3 and itsassociated pulsar psr j1811-1925. analysis of integral/ibis data allowscharacterisation of the system above 10 kev. the ibis spectrum is best fittedby a power law having photon index of 1.8^{+0.4}_{-0.3} and a 20-100 kev fluxof 1.5e{-11} erg/cm^2/s. analysis of archival chandra data over differentenergy bands rules out the supernova shell as the site of the soft gamma-rayemission while broad band (1-200 kev) spectral analysis strongly indicates thatthe integral/ibis photons originate in the central zone of the system whichcontains both the pulsar and its nebula. the composite x-ray and soft gamma-rayspectrum indicates that the pulsar provides around half of the emission seen inthe soft gamma-ray domain; its spectrum is hard with no sign of a cut off up toat least 80 kev. the other half of the emission above 10 kev comes from thepwn; with a power law slope of 1.7 its spectrum is softer than that of thepulsar. from the ibis/isgri mosaics we are able to derive 2 sigma upper limitsfor the 20-100 kev flux from the location of the nearby tev source hessj1809-193 to be 4.8e{-12} erg/cm^2/s. we have also examined the likelihood ofan association between psr j1811-1925 and hess j1809-193. although psrj1811-1925 is the most energetic pulsar in the region, the only one detectedabove 10 kev and thus a possible source of energy to fuel the tev fluxes, thereis no morphological evidence to support this pairing, making it an unlikelycounterpart.

0805.0496	integral and swift/xrt observations of the sfxt igr j16479-4514: from  quiescence to fast flaring activity	context: igr j16479-4514 is a fast x-ray transient known to display flareslasting typically a few hours. recently, its counterpart has been identifiedwith a supergiant star, therefore the source can be classified as member of thenewly discovered class of supergiant fast x-ray transients (sfxts),specifically it is the one with the highest duty cycle. aims: to characterizethe quiescent x-ray behaviour of the source and to compare its broad bandspectrum to that during fast x-ray flares. methods: we performed an analysis ofibis and jem-x data with osa 5.1 as well as an analysis of archival swift/xrtdata. results: we present results from a long term monitoring of igrj16479-4514 with detailed spectral and timing informations on 19 bright fastx-ray flares, 10 of which newly discovered. we also report for the first timeresults on the quiescent x-ray emission; the typical luminosity value (about10^34 erg s^-1) is about 2 orders of magnitude greater than that typical ofsfxts while its broad band x-ray spectrum has a shape very similar to thatduring fast x-ray transient activity, i.e. a rather steep power law withgamma=2.6. conclusions: igr j16479$-$4514 is characterized by a quiescent x-rayluminosity higher than that typical of other known sfxts but lower thanpersistent emission from classical sgxbs. we suggest that such source is a kindof transition object between these two systems, supporting the idea that thereis a continuum of behaviours between the class of sfxts and that of classicalpersistent sgxbs.

0806.4824	first high energy observations of narrow line seyfert 1s with  integral/ibis	narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies (nls1) are very interesting objects whichdisplay peculiar properties when compared to their broad line analogues (bls1).although well studied in many wavebands, their behaviour at &gt;10 kev is poorlystudied and yet important to discriminate between models invoked to explain thecomplexity observed in the x-ray band. here we present for the first time highenergy observations (17-100 kev) of five nls1 galaxies (3 bona fide and 2candidates) detected by integral/ibis and provide for all of them a broad bandspectral analysis using data obtained by swift/xrt below 10 kev. the combinedintegral spectrum is found to be steeper (gamma=2.6 +/- 0.3) than those ofclassical seyfert 1 objects. this is due to a high energy cutoff, which isrequired in some individual fits as in the average broad band spectrum. thelocation of this high energy cutoff is at lower energies (e &lt; 60 kev) thantypically seen in classical type 1 agns; a reflection component may also bepresent but its value (r &lt; 0.8) is compatible with those seen in standardseyfert 1s. we do not detect a soft excess in individual objects but only intheir cumulative spectrum. our results suggest a lower plasma temperature forthe accreting plasma which combined to the high accretion rates (close to theeddington rate) point to different nuclear conditions in broad and narrow lineseyfert 1 galaxies, likely related to different evolutionary stages.

astro-ph;0101035	flat-fielding batse occultation data for use in a hard x-ray all sky  survey	the batse mission aboard cgro can be used to observe hard x-ray sources byusing the earth occultation method. this method relies on measuring a step inthe count rate profile in each batse detector as a source rises above or setsbelow the earth's limb. a major problem in determining the step sizes (andhence the flux) is in extracting the steps from the varying background. atechnique for flat-fielding the response of gamma ray detectors has beendeveloped at southampton. the technique uses a dynamic monte-carlo model tosimulate the dominant components of the gamma-ray background encountered by theexperiment at any point in its orbit. a maximum likelihood imaging method isalso being developed that will be used to make a sky survey with all 9 years ofthe batse continuous data set in the 20 - 500 kev range. an all sky map of 25 -35 kev emission has been made using 60 days of data and has a 3 sigma fluxsensitivity of 14 mcrab.

astro-ph;0211424	a mass model for estimating the gamma ray background of the burst and  transient source experiment	orbiting x-ray and gamma ray instruments are subject to large backgroundcount rates due to local particle fluxes in the space environment. the abilityof an instrument to make calibrated measurements of the flux from a source ofinterest is highly dependent on accurately determining the background level. wepresent here a method of calculating the energy dependent background flux forany point in the complete data set recorded by the burst and transient sourceexperiment (batse) in its nine year mission. the batse mass model (bamm) uses amonte carlo mass modelling approach to produce a data base of the gamma raybackground which is then filtered to simulate the background count rate with a2.048 second time resolution. this method is able to reduce the variations inthe background flux by a factor of 8 - 10, effectively `flat-fielding' thedetector response. with flat-fielded batse data it should be possible to usethe earth occultation technique to produce a hard x-ray all sky survey to the1-2 mcrab sensitivity limit. bamm is also capable of estimating thecontribution to the spectra measured from gamma ray sources due to thereprocessing of source photons in inactive material surrounding a gamma raydetector. possible applications of this aspect of the model in the area ofgamma ray burst spectral analysis are discussed.

astro-ph;0304133	bepposax average spectra of seyfert galaxies	we have studied the average 3-200 kev spectra of seyfert galaxies of type 1and 2, using data obtained with bepposax. the average seyfert 1 spectrum iswell-fitted by a power law continuum with photon spectral index gamma~1.9, acompton reflection component r~0.6-1 (depending on the inclination anglebetween the line of sight and the reflecting material) and a high-energy cutoffat around 200 kev; there is also an iron line at 6.4 kev characterized by anequivalent width of 120 ev. seyfert 2's on the other hand show stronger neutralabsorption (nh=3-4 x 10^{22} atoms cm-2) as expected but are also characterizedby an x-ray power law which is substantially harder (gamma~1.75) and with acut-off at lower energies (e_c~130 kev); the iron line parameters are insteadsubstantially similar to those measured in type 1 objects. there are only twopossible solutions to this problem: to assume more reflection in seyfert 2galaxies than observed in seyfert 1 or more complex absorption than estimatedin the first instance. the first possibility is ruled out by the seyfert 2 toseyfert 1 ratio while the second provides an average seyfert 2 intrinsicspectrum very similar to that of the seyfert 1. the extra absorber is likely anartifact due to summing spectra with different amounts of absorption, althoughtwe cannot exclude its presence in at least some individual sources. our resultargues strongly for a very similar central engine in both type of galaxies asexpected under the unified theory.

astro-ph;0504137	the broad-band x-ray spectrum of the blazar pks b1830-211 by chandra and  integral	in this paper we present a broad-band study of the x-ray emission of theblazar pks1830-211 based on chandra and integral observations. notwithstandingthe high redshift (z=2.507), it is a bright x-ray source (f(2-10 kev)~10^{-11}erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}), due to gravitational lensing by an intervening galaxy atz=0.89. previous x-ray observations attribute the observed absorption at e&lt;2kev to the lensing galaxy. our analysis, although not in contrast with thishypothesis, suggests also the possibility of an intrinsic (ionized) absorption,taking place at the front side of the jet. this scenario is also supported bysome evidence, in the same data, of a feature observed at 2.15 kev which can beinterpreted as a blueshifted iron line (v/c ~ 0.18). the sed of pks1830-211 canbe well modelled by combining a synchrotron self-compton component and anexternal source of photons to be scattered up to \gamma-ray energies byrelativistic electrons moving outward in the jet. the main source of low energyphotons is a dust torus at the temperature of 10^3 k as expected in mevblazars.

astro-ph;0603756	unveiling supergiant fast x-ray transient sources with integral	supergiant high mass x-ray binaries (sgxbs) are believed to be rare objects,as stars in the supergiant phase have a very short lifetime and to date onlyabout a dozen of them have been discovered. they are known to be persistent andbright x-ray sources. integral is changing this classical picture as itsobservations are revealing the presence of a new subclass of sgxbs which havebeen labelled as supergiant fast x-ray transients (sfxts) as they are stronglycharacterized by fast x-ray outbursts lasting less than a day, typically a fewhours. we report on ibis detections of newly discovered fast x-ray outburstsfrom 10 sources, four of which have been recently optically identified assupergiant high mass x-ray binaries. in particular for one of them, igrj11215-5952, we observe fast x-ray transient behaviour for the first time. theremaining six sources (igr j16479-4514, igr j16418-4532, xte j1743-363, igrj16195-4945=ax j161929-4945, ax j1749.1-2733, igr j17407-2808) are stillunclassified, however they can be considered as candidate sfxts because oftheir similarity to the known sfxts.

astro-ph;0702738	polarisation studies of the prompt gamma-ray emission from grb 041219a  using the spectrometer aboard integral	the spectrometer aboard integral, spi, has the capability to detect thesignature of polarised emission from a bright gamma-ray source. grb 041219a isthe most intense burst localised by integral and is an ideal candidate for sucha study. polarisation can be measured using multiple events scattered intoadjacent detectors because the compton scatter angle depends on thepolarisation of the incoming photon. a search for linear polarisation in themost intense pulse of duration 66 seconds and in the brightest 12 seconds ofgrb 041219a was performed in the 100-350kev, 100-500kev and 100kev-1mev energyranges. the multiple event data from the spectrometer was analysed and comparedwith the predicted instrument response obtained from monte-carlo simulationsusing the geant 4 integral mass model. the chi^2 distribution between the realand simulated data as a function of the percentage polarisation andpolarisation angle was calculated for all three energy ranges. the degree oflinear polarisation in the brightest pulse of duration 66s was found to be63+/-31% at an angle of 70+/-14 degrees in the 100-350kev energy range. thedegree of polarisation was also constrained in the brightest 12s of the grb anda polarisation fraction of 96+/-40% at an angle of 60+/-14 degrees wasdetermined over the same energy range. however, despite extensive analysis andsimulations, a systematic effect that could mimic the weak polarisation signalcould not be definitively excluded. our results over several energy ranges andtime intervals are consistent with a polarisation signal of about 60% at a lowlevel of significance (2 sigma). we conclude that the procedure described heredemonstrates the effectiveness of using spi as a polarimeter, and is a viablemethod of measuring polarisation levels in intense gamma--ray bursts.

astro-ph;0703150	swift detection of all previously undetected blazars in a micro-wave  flux-limited sample of wmap foreground sources	almost the totality of the bright foreground sources in the wmap cmb maps areblazars, a class of sources that show usually also x-ray emission. however, 23objects in a flux-limited sample of 140 blazars of the wmap catalog (firstyear) were never reported before as x-ray sources. we present here the resultsof 41 swift observations which led to the detection of all these 23 blazars inthe 0.3-10 kev band. we conclude that all micro-wave selected blazars are x-rayemitters and that the distribution of the micro-wave to x-ray spectral slope$\alpha_{mu x}$ of lbl blazars is very narrow, confirming that the x-ray fluxof most blazars is a very good estimator of their micro-wave emission. thex-ray spectral shape of all the objects that were observed long enough to allowspectral analysis is flat and consistent with inverse compton emission withinthe commonly accepted view where the radiation from blazars is emitted in asychrotron-inverse-compton scenario. we predict that all blazars and most radiogalaxies above the sensitivity limit of the wmap and of the planck cmb missionsare x-ray sources detectable by the present generation of x-ray satellites. anhypothetical all-sky soft x-ray survey with sensitivity of approximately$10^{-15}$ erg/s would be crucial to locate and remove over 100,000 blazarsfrom cmb temperature and polarization maps and therefore accurately clean theprimordial cmb signal from the largest population of extragalactic foregroundcontaminants.

0811.4085	unveiling the nature of integral objects through optical spectroscopy.  vii. identification of 20 galactic and extragalactic hard x-ray sources	within the framework of our program of assessment of the nature ofunidentified or poorly known integral sources, we present here spectroscopy ofoptical objects, selected through positional cross-correlation with soft x-raydetections (afforded with satellites such as swift, rosat, chandra and/orxmm-newton) as putative counterparts of hard x-ray sources detected with theibis instrument onboard integral. using 6 telescopes of various sizes andarchival data from two on-line spectroscopic surveys we are able to identify,either for the first time or independent of other groups, the nature of 20integral hard x-ray sources. our results indicate that: 11 of these objects areactive galactic nuclei (agns) at redshifts between 0.014 and 0.978, 7 of whichdisplay broad emission lines, 2 show narrow emission lines only, and 2 haveunremarkable or no emission lines (thus are likely compton thick agns); 5 arecataclysmic variables (cvs), 4 of which are (possibly magnetic) dwarf novae andone is a symbiotic star; and 4 are galactic x-ray binaries (3 with high-masscompanions and one with a low-mass secondary). it is thus again found that themajority of these sources are agns or magnetic cvs, confirming our previousfindings. when possible, the main physical parameters for these hard x-raysources are also computed using the multiwavelength information available inthe literature. these identifications support the importance of integral in thestudy of the hard x-ray spectrum of all classes of x-ray emitting objects, andthe effectiveness of a strategy of multi-catalogue cross-correlation plusoptical spectroscopy to securely pinpoint the actual nature of unidentifiedhard x-ray sources.
