hep-th;0105120	coproduct and star product in field theories on lie-algebra  non-commutative space-times	we propose a new approach to field theory on $\kappa$-minkowskinon-commutative space-time, a popular example of lie-algebra space-time. ourproposal is essentially based on the introduction of a star product, atechnique which is proving to be very fruitful in analogous studies ofcanonical non-commutative space-times, such as the ones recently found to playa role in the description of certain string-theory backgrounds. we find to beincorrect the expectation, previously reported in the literature, that the lackof symmetry of the $\kappa$-poincare' coproduct should lead to interactionvertices that are not symmetric under exchanges of the momenta of identicalparticles entering the relevant processes. we show that in $\kappa$-minkowskithe coproduct and the star product must indeed treat momenta in a non-symmetricway, but the overall structure of interaction vertices is symmetric underexchange of identical particles. we also show that in $\kappa$-minkowski fieldtheories it is convenient to introduce the concepts of "planar" and"non-planar" feynman loop-diagrams, again in close analogy with thecorresponding concepts previously introduced in the study of field theories incanonical non-commutative space-times.

hep-th;0109191	phenomenology of particle production and propagation in string-motivated  canonical noncommutative spacetime	we outline a phenomenological programme for the search of effects induced by(string-motivated) canonical noncommutative spacetime. the tests we propose arebased, in analogy with a corresponding programme developed over the last fewyears for the study of lie-algebra noncommutative spacetimes, on the role ofthe noncommutativity parameters in the $e(p)$ dispersion relation. we focus onthe role of deformed dispersion relations in particle-production collisionprocesses, where the noncommutativity parameters would affect the thresholdequation, and in the dispersion of gamma rays observed from distantastrophysical sources. we emphasize that the studies here proposed have theadvantage of involving particles of relatively high energies, and may thereforebe less sensitive to "contamination" (through ir/uv mixing) from the uv sectorof the theory. we also explore the possibility that the relevant deformation ofthe dispersion relations could be responsible for the experimentally-observedviolations of the gzk cutoff for cosmic rays and could have a role in theobservation of hard photons from distant astrophysical sources.

hep-th;0211022	group velocity in noncommutative spacetime	the realization that forthcoming experimental studies, such as the onesplanned for the glast space telescope, will be sensitive to planck-scaledeviations from lorentz symmetry has increased interest in noncommutativespacetimes in which this type of effects is expected. we focus here on$\kappa$-minkowski spacetime, a much-studied example of lie-algebranoncommutative spacetime, but our analysis appears to be applicable to a moregeneral class of noncommutative spacetimes. a technical controversy which hassignificant implications for experimental testability is the one concerning the$\kappa$-minkowski relation between group velocity and momentum. a largemajority of studies adopted the relation $v = de(p)/dp$, where $e(p)$ is the$\kappa$-minkowski dispersion relation, but recently some authors advocatedalternative formulas. while in these previous studies the relation betweengroup velocity and momentum was introduced through ad hoc formulas, we rely ona direct analysis of wave propagation in $\kappa$-minkowski. our results leadconclusively to the relation $v = de(p)/dp$. we also show that the previousproposals of alternative velocity/momentum relations implicitly relied on aninconsistent implementation of functional calculus on $\kappa$-minkowski and/oron an inconsistent description of spacetime translations.

hep-th;0306013	hopf-algebra description of noncommutative-spacetime symmetries	in the study of certain noncommutative versions of minkowski spacetime thereis still a large ambiguity concerning the characterization of their symmetries.adopting as our case study the kappaminkowski noncommutative space-time, onwhich a large literature is already available, we propose a line of analysis ofnoncommutative-spacetime symmetries that relies on the introduction of a weylmap (connecting a given function in the noncommutative minkowski with acorresponding function in commutative minkowski) and of a compatible notion ofintegration in the noncommutative spacetime. we confirm (and we establish morerobustly) previous suggestions that the commutative-spacetime notion oflie-algebra symmetries must be replaced, in the noncommutative-spacetimecontext, by the one of hopf-algebra symmetries. we prove that in kappaminkowskiit is possible to construct an action which is invariant under a poincare-likehopf algebra of symmetries with 10 generators, in which the noncommutativitylength scale has the role of relativistic invariant. the approach here adopteddoes leave one residual ambiguity, which pertains to the description of thetranslation generators, but our results, independently of this ambiguity, aresufficient to clarify that some recent studies (gr-qc/0212128 andhep-th/0301061), which argued for an operational indistiguishability betweentheories with and without a length-scale relativistic invariant, implicitlyassumed that the underlying spacetime would be classical.

hep-th;0306134	quantum symmetry, the cosmological constant and planck scale  phenomenology	we present a simple algebraic argument for the conclusion that the low energylimit of a quantum theory of gravity must be a theory invariant, not under thepoincare group, but under a deformation of it parameterized by a dimensionalparameter proportional to the planck mass. such deformations, calledkappa-poincare algebras, imply modified energy-momentum relations of a typethat may be observable in near future experiments. our argument applies in both2+1 and 3+1 dimensions and assumes only 1) that the low energy limit of aquantum theory of gravity must involve also a limit in which the cosmologicalconstant is taken very small with respect to the planck scale and 2) that in3+1 dimensions the physical energy and momenta of physical elementary particlesis related to symmetries of the full quantum gravity theory by appropriaterenormalization depending on lambda l^2_{planck}. the argument makes use of thefact that the cosmological constant results in the symmetry algebra of quantumgravity being quantum deformed, as a consequence when the limit \lambdal^2_{planck} -&gt; 0 is taken one finds a deformed poincare invariance. we arealso able to isolate what information must be provided by the quantum theory inorder to determine which presentation of the kappa-poincare algebra is relevantfor the physical symmetry generators and, hence, the exact form of the modifiedenergy-momentum relations. these arguments imply that lorentz invariance ismodified as in proposals for doubly special relativity, rather than broken, intheories of quantum gravity, so long as those theories behave smoothly in thelimit the cosmological constant is taken to be small.

hep-th;0407227	action functional for kappa-minkowski noncommutative spacetime	we examine some alternative possibilities for an action functional for$\kappa$-minkowski noncommutative spacetime, with an approach which should beapplicable to other spacetimes with coordinate-dependent commutators of thespacetime coordinates ($[x_\mu,x_\nu]=f_{\mu,\nu}(x)$). early works on$\kappa$-minkowski focused on $\kappa$-poincar\'e covariance and the dependenceof the action functional on the choice of weyl map, renouncing to invarianceunder cyclic permutations of the factors composing the argument of the actionfunctional. a recent paper (hep-th/0307149), by dimitrijevic, jonke, moller,tsouchnika, wess and wohlgenannt, focused on a specific choice of weyl map and,setting aside the issue of $\kappa$-poincar\'e covariance of the actionfunctional, introduced in implicit form a cyclicity-inducing measure. weprovide an explicit formula for (and derivation of) a choice of measure whichindeed ensures cyclicity of the action functional, and we show that the samechoice of measure is applicable to all the most used choices of weyl map. wefind that this ``cyclicity-inducing measure'' is not covariant under$\kappa$-poincar\'e transformations. we also notice that the cyclicity-inducingmeasure can be straightforwardly derived using a map which connects the$\kappa$-minkowski spacetime coordinates and the spacetime coordinates of a``canonical'' noncommutative spacetime, with coordinate-independentcommutators.

hep-th;0607221	generalizing the noether theorem for hopf-algebra spacetime symmetries	over these past few years several quantum-gravity research groups have beenexploring the possibility that in some planck-scale nonclassical descriptionsof spacetime one or another form of nonclassical spacetime symmetries mightarise. one of the most studied scenarios is based on the use of hopf algebras,but previous attempts were not successful in deriving constructively theproperties of the conserved charges one would like to obtain from the hopfstructure, and this in turn did not allow a crisp physical characterization ofthe new concept of spacetime symmetry. working within the example of$\kappa$-minkowski noncommutative spacetime, known to be particularlytroublesome from this perspective, we observe that these past failures in thesearch of the charges originated from not recognizing the crucial role that thenoncommutative differential calculus plays in the symmetry analysis. we showthat, if the properties of the $\kappa$-minkowski differential calculus arecorrectly taken into account, one can easily perform all the steps of thenoether analysis and obtain an explicit formula relating fields andenergy-momentum charges. our derivation also exposes the fact that an apparentsource of physical ambiguity in the description of the hopf-algebra rules ofaction, which was much emphasized in the literature, actually only amounts to achoice of conventions and in particular does not affect the formulas for thecharges.

0904.3201	a constraint on planck-scale modifications to electrodynamics with cmb  polarization data	we show that the cosmic microwave background (cmb) polarization data gatheredby the boomerang 2003 flight and wmap provide an opportunity to investigate{\it in-vacuo} birefringence, of a type expected in some quantum pictures ofspace-time, with a sensitivity that extends even beyond the desiredplanck-scale energy. in order to render this constraint more transparent werely on a well studied phenomenological model of quantum-gravity-inducedbirefringence, in which one easily establishes that effects introduced at theplanck scale would amount to values of a dimensionless parameter, denoted by$\xi$, with respect to the planck energy which are roughly of order 1. bycombining boomerang and wmap data we estimate $\xi \simeq -0.110 \pm 0.076$ atthe 68% c.l. moreover, we forecast on the sensitivity to $\xi$ achievable byfuture cmb polarization experiments (planck, spider, epic), which, in theabsence of systematics, will be at the 1-$\sigma$ confidence of $8.5 \times10^{-4}$ (planck), $6.1 \times 10^{-3}$ (spider), and $1.0 \times 10^{-5}$(epic) respectively. the cosmic variance-limited sensitivity from cmb is$6.1\times 10^{-6}$.

0906.3731	prospects for constraining quantum gravity dispersion with near term  observations	we discuss the prospects for bounding and perhaps even measuring quantumgravity effects on the dispersion of light using the highest energy photonsproduced in gamma ray bursts measured by the fermi telescope. these prospectsare brigher than might have been expected as in the first 10 months ofoperation fermi has reported so far eight events with photons over 100 mev seenby its large area telescope (lat). we review features of these events which maybear on planck scale phenomenology and we discuss the possible implications forthe alternative scenarios for in-vacua dispersion coming from breaking ordeforming of poincare invariance. among these are semi-conservative bounds,which rely on some relatively weak assumptions about the sources, on subluminaland superluminal in-vacuo dispersion. we also propose that it may be possibleto look for the arrival of still higher energy photons and neutrinos from grb'swith energies in the range 10^14 - 10^17 ev. in some cases the quantum gravitydispersion effect would predict these arrivals to be delayed or advanced bydays to months from the grb, giving a clean separation of astrophysical sourceand spacetime propagation effects.

0911.1020	constraining the energy-momentum dispersion relation with planck-scale  sensitivity using cold atoms	we use the results of ultra-precise cold-atom-recoil experiments to constrainthe form of the energy-momentum dispersion relation, a structure that isexpected to be modified in several quantum-gravity approaches. our strategy ofanalysis applies to the nonrelativistic (small speeds) limit of the dispersionrelation, and is therefore complementary to an analogous ongoing effort ofinvestigation of the dispersion relation in the ultrarelativistic regime usingobservations in astrophysics. for the leading correction in the nonrelativisticlimit the exceptional sensitivity of cold-atom-recoil experiments remarkablyallows us to set a limit within a single order of magnitude of the desiredplanck-scale level, thereby providing the first example of planck-scalesensitivity in the study of the dispersion relation in controlled laboratoryexperiments. for the next-to-leading term we obtain a limit which is a feworders of magnitude away from the planck scale, but still amounts to the bestlimit on a class of lorentz-symmetry test theories that has been extensivelyused to investigate the hypothesis of "deformation" (rather than breakdown) ofspacetime symmetries.

1003.0878	planck-scale modifications to electrodynamics characterized by a  space-like symmetry-breaking vector	in the study of planck-scale ("quantum-gravity induced") violations oflorentz symmetry, an important role was played by the deformed-electrodynamicsmodel introduced by myers and pospelov. its reliance on conventional effectivequantum field theory, and its description of symmetry-violation effects simplyin terms of a four-vector with nonzero component only in the time-direction,rendered it an ideal target for experimentalists and a natural concept-testingground for many theorists. at this point however the experimental limits on thesingle myers-pospelov parameter, after improving steadily over these past fewyears, are "super-planckian", {\it i.e.} they take the model out of actualinterest from a conventional quantum-gravity perspective. in light of this wehere argue that it may be appropriate to move on to the next level ofcomplexity, still with vectorial symmetry violation but adopting a genericfour-vector. we also offer a preliminary characterization of the phenomenologyof this more general framework, sufficient to expose a rather significantincrease in complexity with respect to the original myers-pospelov setup. mostof these novel features are linked to the presence of spatial anisotropy, whichis particularly pronounced when the symmetry-breaking vector is space-like, andthey are such that they reduce the bound-setting power of certain types ofobservations in astrophysics.

1004.0575	modifications to lorentz invariant dispersion in relatively boosted  frames	we investigate the implications of energy-dependence of the speed of photons,one of the candidate effects of quantum-gravity theories that has been moststudied recently, from the perspective of observations in different referenceframes. we examine how a simultaneous burst of photons would be measured by twoobservers with a relative velocity, establishing some associated conditions forthe consistency of theories. for scenarios where the lorentz transformationsremain valid these consistency conditions allow us to characterize theviolations of lorentz symmetry through an explicit description of themodification of the quantum-gravity scale in boosted frames with respect to itsdefinition in a preferred frame. when applied to relativistic scenarios with adeformation of lorentz invariance that preserves the equivalence of inertialobservers, we find an insightful characterization of the necessity to adopt insuch frameworks non-classical features of spacetime geometry, e.g. events thatare at the same spacetime point for one observer cannot be considered at thesame spacetime point for other observers. our findings also suggest that, atleast in principle (and perhaps one day even in practice), measurements of thedispersion of photons in relatively boosted frames can be particularly valuablefor the purpose of testing these scenarios.

1004.1110	interplay between curvature and planck-scale effects in astrophysics and  cosmology	several recent studies have considered the implications for astrophysics andcosmology of some possible nonclassical properties of spacetime at the planckscale. the new effects, such as a planck-scale-modified energy-momentum(dispersion) relation, are often inferred from the analysis of some quantumversions of minkowski spacetime, and therefore the relevant estimates dependheavily on the assumption that there could not be significant interplay betweenplanck-scale and curvature effects. we here scrutinize this assumption, usingas guidance a quantum version of de sitter spacetime with known inonu-wignercontraction to a quantum minkowski spacetime. and we show that, contrary tocommon (but unsupported) beliefs, the interplay between planck-scale andcurvature effects can be significant. within our illustrative example, in theminkowski limit the quantum-geometry deformation parameter is indeed given bythe planck scale, while in the de sitter picture the parameter of quantizationof geometry depends both on the planck scale and the curvature scalar. for themuch-studied case of planck-scale effects that intervene in the observation ofgamma-ray bursts we can estimate the implications of "quantum spacetimecurvature" within robust simplifying assumptions. for cosmology at the presentstage of the development of the relevant mathematics one cannot go beyondsemiheuristic reasoning, and we here propose a candidate approximatedescription of a quantum frw geometry, obtained by patching together pieces(with different spacetime curvature) of our quantum de sitter. thissemiheuristic picture, in spite of its limitations, provides rather robustevidence that in the early universe the interplay between planck-scale andcurvature effects could have been particularly significant.

1004.3352	string-inspired ultraviolet/infrared mixing and preliminary evidence of  a violation of the de broglie relation for nonrelativistic neutrons	we advocate a novel perspective on the phenomenology of a framework withspacetime noncommutativity which is of established relevance for string theory.our analysis applies to cases in which the noncommutativity parameters arearranged according to the criteria of "light-like noncommutativity" andultraviolet supersymmetry is assumed, so that the implications of thecharacteristic mechanism of ultraviolet/infrared mixing are relatively soft. wealso observe that an analogous case of soft ultraviolet-infrared mixing ispresent in a previously-proposed loop-quantum-gravity-inspired description ofquantum spacetime. and we show that soft ultraviolet-infrared mixing producesan anomaly for the nonrelativistic de broglie relation $\lambda v = h/m$, withcorrection term governed by a single (but particle-dependent) parameter $\chi$.we test this hypothesis by comparing a determination of the fine structureconstant that relies on the de broglie relation for nonrelativistic neutrons toother independent determinations of the fine structure constant, and we obtainan estimate of $\chi$ that differs from 0 with four-standard-deviationsignificance.

1102.4637	speed of particles and a relativity of locality in $\kappa$-minkowski  quantum spacetime	the last decade of research on $\kappa$-minkowski noncommutative spacetimehas been strongly characterized by a controversy concerning the speed ofpropagation of massless particles. most arguments suggested that this speedshould depend on the momentum of the particle strongly enough to be of interestfor some ongoing experimental studies. but the only explicit derivations ofworldlines in $\kappa$-minkowski predicted no momentum dependence for the speedof massless particles. we return to this controversy equipped with the recentunderstanding (arxiv:1006.2126, arxiv:1007.0718, arxiv:1008.2962,arxiv:1101.0931) that in some quantum spacetimes coincidences of eventsassessed by an observer who is distant from the events can be artifactual, andparticularly smolin's thesis (arxiv:1007.0718) that $\kappa$-minkowski shouldbe an example of such a spacetime. we therefore set up our investigation insuch a way that we never rely on the assessment of coincidences of events bydistant observers. this allows us to verify explicitly that in$\kappa$-minkowski simultaneously-emitted massless particles of differentmomentum are detected at different times, and establish a linear dependence ofthe detection times on momentum.

1107.1724	relative-locality distant observers and the phenomenology of  momentum-space geometry	we study the translational invariance of the relative-locality frameworkproposed in arxiv:1101.0931, which had been previously established only for thecase of a single interaction. we provide an explicit example of boundaryconditions at endpoints of worldlines, which indeed ensures the desiredtranslational invariance for processes involving several interactions, evenwhen some of the interactions are causally connected (particle exchange). weillustrate the properties of the associated relativistic description of distantobservers within the example of a $\kappa$-poincar\'e-inspired momentum-spacegeometry, with de sitter metric and parallel transport governed by a non-metricand torsionful connection. we find that in such a theory simultaneously-emittedmassless particles do not reach simultaneously a distant detector, as expectedin light of the findings of arxiv:1103.5626 on the implications of non-metricconnections. we also show that the theory admits a free-particle limit, wherethe relative-locality results of arxiv:1102.4637 are reproduced. we establishthat the torsion of the $\kappa$-poincar\'e connection introduces a small (butobservably-large) dependence of the time of detection, forsimultaneously-emitted particles, on some properties of the interactionsproducing the particles at the source.

1109.5172	opera-reassessing data on the energy dependence of the speed of  neutrinos	we offer a preliminary exploration of the two sides of the challenge providedby the recent opera data on superluminal neutrinos. on one side we stress thatsome aspects of this result are puzzling even from the perspective of the wildquantum-gravity literature, where arguments in favor of the possibility ofsuperluminal propagation have been presented, but not considering thepossibility of such a sizeable effect for neutrinos of such low energies. wefeel this must encourage particularly severe scrutiny of the opera result. onthe other side, we notice that the opera result is reasonably consistent with$\mu$-neutrino-speed data previously obtained at fermilab, reported in papersof 2007 and 1979. and it is intriguing that these fermilab79 and fermilab07results, when combined with the new opera result, in principle provide a windowon $\mu$-neutrino speeds at different energies broad enough to comparealternative phenomenological models. we test the discriminating power of suchan approach by using as illustrative examples the case of special-relativistictachyons, the case of "coleman-glashow-type" momentum-independent violations ofthe special-relativistic speed law, and the cases of linear and quadraticenergy dependence of the speed of ultrarelativistic muon neutrinos. even justusing $\mu$-neutrino data in the range from $\sim$ 3 gevs to $\sim$ 200 gevsthe special-relativistic tachyon and the quadratic-dependence case are clearlydisfavoured. the linear-dependence case gives a marginally consistent pictureand the coleman-glashow scenario fits robustly the data. we also comment onsupernova 1987a and its relevance for consideration of other neutrino species,also in relation with some scenarios that appeared in the large-extra-dimensionliterature.

1110.5081	on the fate of lorentz symmetry in relative-locality momentum spaces	the most studied doubly-special-relativity scenarios, theories with both thespeed-of-light scale and a length/inverse-momentum scale as non-trivialrelativistic invariants, have concerned the possibility of enforcingrelativistically some nonlinear laws on momentum space. for the"relative-locality framework" recently proposed in arxiv:1101.0931 a centralrole is played by nonlinear laws on momentum space, with the guiding principlethat they should provide a characterization of the geometry of momentum space.building on previous doubly-special-relativity results i here identify acriterion for establishing whether or not a given geometry of therelative-locality momentum space is "dsr compatible", i.e. compatible with anobserver-independent formulation of theories on that momentum space. i findthat given some chosen parametrization of momentum-space geometry the criteriontakes the form of an elementary algorithm. i show that relative-localitymomentum spaces that fail my criterion definitely "break" lorentz invariance,i.e. theories on such momentum spaces necessarily are observer-dependent"ether" theories. by working out a few examples i provide evidence that whenthe criterion is instead satisfied one does manage to produce a relativisticformulation. the examples i use to illustrate the applicability of my criterionalso have some intrinsic interest, including two particularly noteworthy casesof $\kappa$-poincar\'e-inspired momentum spaces.

1111.0993	weakness of accelerator bounds on electron superluminality without a  preferred frame	the reference laboratory bounds on superluminality of the electron areobtained from the absence of in-vacuo cherenkov processes and thedeterminations of synchrotron radiated power for lep electrons. it is usuallyassumed that these analyses establish the validity of a standardspecial-relativistic description of the electron with accuracy of at least afew parts in $10^{14}$, and in particular this is used to exclude electronsuperluminality with such an accuracy. we observe that these bounds relycrucially on the availability of a preferred frame. in-vacuo-cherenkovprocesses are automatically forbidden in any theory with "deformed lorentzsymmetry", relativistic theories that, while different from special relativity,preserve the relativity of inertial frames. determinations of the synchrotronradiated power can be used to constrain the possibility of lorentz-symmetrydeformation, but provide rather weak bounds, which in particular for electronsuperluminality we establish to afford us no more constraining power than foran accuracy of a few parts in $10^4$. we argue that this observation can haveonly a limited role in the ongoing effort of analysis of the anomalytentatively reported by the opera collaboration, but we stress that it couldprovide a valuable case study for assessing the limitations of "indirect" testsof fundamental laws of physics.

1111.5643	particle-dependent deformations of lorentz symmetry	i here investigate what is arguably the most significant residual challengefor the proposal of phenomenologically viable "dsr deformations" ofrelativistic kinematics, which concerns the description of composite particles,such as atoms. in some approaches to the formalization of possible scenariosfor dsr-deformation of lorentz symmetry it emerges that composite particlesshould have relativistic properties different from the ones of theirconstituent "fundamental particles", but these previous results provided noclue as to how the mismatch of relativistic properties could be consistentlyimplemented. i show that it is possible to implement a fully consistentdsr-relativistic description of kinematics endowing different types ofparticles with suitably different deformed-lorentz-symmetry properties. i alsocontemplate the possibility that some types of particles (or macroscopicbodies) behave according to completely undeformed special relativity, which inparticular might apply to the dsr description of the macroscopic bodies thatconstitute measuring devices ("observers"). the formalization is alsoapplicable to cases where different fundamental particles have differentrelativistic properties, leading to a type of phenomenology which i illustrateby considering possible applications to the ongoing analyses of the"lorentz-symmetry anomaly" that was recently tentatively reported by the operacollaboration. some of the new elements here introduced in the formulation ofrelativistic kinematics appear to also provide the starting point for thedevelopment of a correspondingly novel mathematical formulation ofspacetime-symmetry algebras.

1201.6496	third road to the opera: a tunnel after all?	the debate on opera focused on two extremes: either "opera is wrong" or ourformulation of the laws of physics needs a major overhaul. i here argue thatsome effort should be directed toward manifestations of laws that are alreadyknown, but whose implications are poorly understood in opera-type contexts. mypreferred example of this sort is that the opera result might be the firstobservation of a previously unnoticed effect, belonging to a family of effectswhich includes those responsible for the well-known peculiar properties of the"tunneling time". tentative support for this specific hypothesis comes from thepresence of evanescence and "postselection", and the observation that thefraction of neutrinos absorbed in rock on the way from cern to lngs is of a fewparts in $10^5$, i.e. comparable to the fraction of the overall travel time bywhich opera neutrinos are found to reach lngs earlier than expected. this leadsme to stress that the opera result is still consistent with subluminality of asuitably "postselection-corrected" velocity. adopting the popular (but heredisfavored) interpretation of the opera result as a "signal velocity" one couldobtain superluminal values of the postselection-corrected velocity in sometechnologically feasible opera-like setups, a prediction which i propose totest. i also propose a semi-heuristic formula for the "rock dwell time" andfind that it gives a result in rough agreement with the opera travel-timemeasurements. this suggests that effects similar to the ones found for opera'smuon neutrinos should also be found, but with tangibly different magnitude, formuon anti-neutrinos under similar experimental conditions. and i argue that,whether or not they end up being relevant for the opera anomaly, the effectshere considered should be significant in the planck-scale realm.

1205.1636	born's prophecy leaves no space for quantum gravity	i stress that spacetime is a redundant abstraction, since describing thephysical content of all so-called "space-time measurements" only requirestiming (by a physical/material clock) of particle detections (at aphysical/material detector). it is interesting then to establish which aspectsof our current theories afford us the convenient abstraction of a spacetime. iemphasize the role played by the assumed triviality of the geometry of momentumspace, which makes room for an observer-independent notion of locality. this isrelevant for some recent studies of the quantum-gravity problem that stumbledupon hints of a nontrivial geometry of momentum space, something which had beenstrikingly envisaged for quantum gravity already in 1938 by max born. if indeedmomentum space has nontrivial geometry then the abstraction of a spacetimebecomes more evidently redundant and less convenient: one may still abstract aspacetime but only allowing for the possibility of a relativity of spacetimelocality. i also provide some examples of how all this could affect ourattitude toward the quantum-gravity problem, including some for the program ofemergent gravity and emergent spacetime and an indication of triviality of theholographic description of black holes. and in order to give an illustrativeexample of possible logical path for the "disappearance of spacetime" i rely onformulas inspired by the $\kappa$-poincar\'e framework.

1206.3805	relative locality in a quantum spacetime and the pregeometry of  $\kappa$-minkowski	we develop a new description of the much-studied $\kappa$-minkowskinoncommutative spacetime, centered on representing on a single hilbert spacenot only the $\kappa$-minkowski coordinates, but also the associateddifferential calculus and the $\kappa$-poincar\'e symmetry generators.  in this "pregeometric" representation the relevant operators act on thekinematical hilbert space of the covariant formulation of quantum mechanics,which we argue is the natural framework for studying the implications of thestep from commuting spacetime coordinates to the $\kappa$-minkowski case, wherethe spatial coordinates do not commute with the time coordinate. theempowerment provided by this kinematical-hilbert space representation allows usto give a crisp characterization of the "fuzziness" of $\kappa$-minkowskispacetime, whose most striking aspect is a relativity of spacetime locality. weshow that relative locality, which had been previously formulated exclusivelyin classical-spacetime setups, for a quantum spacetime takes the shape of adependence of the fuzziness of a spacetime point on the distance at which anobserver infers properties of the event that marks the point.

1206.4949	fundamental quantum optics experiments conceivable with satellites --  reaching relativistic distances and velocities	physical theories are developed to describe phenomena in particular regimes,and generally are valid only within a limited range of scales. for example,general relativity provides an effective description of the universe at largelength scales, and has been tested from the cosmic scale down to distances assmall as 10 meters. in contrast, quantum theory provides an effectivedescription of physics at small length scales. direct tests of quantum theoryhave been performed at the smallest probeable scales at the large hadroncollider, ${\sim} 10^{-20}$ meters, up to that of hundreds of kilometers. yet,such tests fall short of the scales required to investigate potentiallysignificant physics that arises at the intersection of quantum and relativisticregimes. we propose to push direct tests of quantum theory to larger and largerlength scales, approaching that of the radius of curvature of spacetime, wherewe begin to probe the interaction between gravity and quantum phenomena. inparticular, we review a wide variety of potential tests of fundamental physicsthat are conceivable with artificial satellites in earth orbit and elsewhere inthe solar system, and attempt to sketch the magnitudes of potentiallyobservable effects. the tests have the potential to determine the applicabilityof quantum theory at larger length scales, eliminate various alternativephysical theories, and place bounds on phenomenological models motivated byideas about spacetime microstructure from quantum gravity. from a morepragmatic perspective, as quantum communication technologies such as quantumkey distribution advance into space towards large distances, some of thefundamental physical effects discussed here may need to be taken into accountto make such schemes viable.

1206.5315	deformed lorentz symmetry and relative locality in a curved/expanding  spacetime	the interest of part of the quantum-gravity community in the possibility ofplanck-scale-deformed lorentz symmetry is also fueled by the opportunities fortesting the relevant scenarios with analyses, from a signal-propagationperspective, of observations of bursts of particles from cosmologicaldistances. in this respect the fact that so far the implications of deformedlorentz symmetry have been investigated only for flat (minkowskian) spacetimesrepresents a very significant limitation, since for propagation overcosmological distances the curvature/expansion of spacetime is evidentlytangible. we here provide a significant step toward filling this gap byexhibiting an explicit example of planck-scale-deformed relativistic symmetriesof a spacetime with constant rate of expansion (desitterian). technically weobtain the first ever example of a relativistic theory of worldlines ofparticles with 3 nontrivial relativistic invariants: a large speed scale("speed-of-light scale"), a large distance scale (inverse of the"expansion-rate scale"), and a large momentum scale ("planck scale"). weaddress some of the challenges that had obstructed success for previousattempts by exploiting the recent understanding of the connection betweendeformed lorentz symmetry and relativity of spacetime locality. we also offer apreliminary analysis of the differences between the scenario we here proposeand the most studied scenario for broken (rather than deformed) lorentzsymmetry in expanding spacetimes.

1303.1826	possible relevance of quantum spacetime for neutrino-telescope data  analyses	one of the primary goals of neutrino telescopes, such as icecube, is thediscovery of neutrinos emitted by gamma-ray bursts (grbs). another source ofinterest in the results obtained by these telescopes is their possible use fortests of the applicability of einstein's special relativity to neutrinos,particularly with respect to modifications that lead to lorentz invarianceviolation that have been conjectured by some models of quantum space-time. weexamine here the fascinating scenario in which these two aspects ofneutrino-telescope physics require a combined analysis. we discuss howneutrinos that one would not associate to a grb, when assuming a classicalspacetime picture, may well be grb neutrinos if the possibility that lorentzinvariance is broken at very high energies is taken into account. as anillustrative example we examine three icecube high energy neutrinos thatarrived hours before grbs (but from the same direction) and we find that theavailable, icecube data, while inconclusive, is compatible with a scenario inwhich one or two of these neutrinos were grb neutrinos and their earlierarrival reflects lorentz invariance violation.  we outline how future analyses of neutrino data should be done in order tosystematically test this possibility.

1304.7271	challenge to macroscopic probes of quantum spacetime based on  noncommutative geometry	over the last decade a growing number of quantum-gravity researchers has beenlooking for opportunities for the first ever experimental evidence of aplanck-length quantum property of spacetime. these studies are usually based onthe analysis of some candidate indirect implications of spacetime quantization,such as a possible curvature of momentum space. some recent proposals haveraised hope that we might also gain direct experimental access to quantumproperties of spacetime, by finding evidence of limitations to themeasurability of the center-of-mass coordinates of some macroscopic bodies.however i here observe that the arguments that originally lead to speculatingabout spacetime quantization do not apply to the localization of the center ofmass of a macroscopic body. and i also analyze some popular formalizations ofthe notion of quantum spacetime, finding that when the quantization ofspacetime is planckian for the constituent particles then for the compositemacroscopic body the quantization of spacetime is much weaker than planckian.these results show that finding evidence of spacetime quantization with studiesof macroscopic bodies is extremely unlikely. and they also raise someconceptual challenges for theories of mechanics in quantum spacetime, in whichfor example free protons and free atoms should feel the effects of spacetimequantization differently.

1304.7630	predictive description of planck-scale-induced spacetime fuzziness	several approaches to the quantum-gravity problem predict that spacetimeshould be "fuzzy", but have been so far unable to provide a crisp physicalcharacterization of this notion. an intuitive picture of spacetime fuzzinesshas been proposed on the basis of semi-heuristic arguments, and in particularinvolves an irreducible planck-scale contribution to the uncertainty of theenergy of a particle. these arguments also inspired a rather activephenomenological programme looking for blurring of images of distantastrophysical sources that would result from such energy uncertainties. we herereport the first ever physical characterization of spacetime fuzziness derivedconstructively within a quantum picture of spacetime, the one provided byspacetime noncommutativity. our results confirm earlier heuristic argumentssuggesting that spacetime fuzziness, while irrelevantly small on terrestrialscales, could be observably large for propagation of particles overcosmological distances. however, we find no planck-scale-induced lower bound onthe uncertainty of the energy of particles, and we observe that this changeshow we should picture a quantum spacetime and also imposes a reanalysis of theassociated phenomenology.

1305.2626	quantum-spacetime scenarios and soft spectral lags of the remarkable  grb130427a	we process the fermi lat data on grb130427a using the fermi science tools,and we summarize some of the key facts that render this observation trulyremarkable, especially concerning the quality of information on high-energyemission by grbs. we then exploit this richness for a search of spectral lags,of the type that has been recently of interest for its relevance inquantum-spacetime research. we do find some evidence of systematic softspectral lags: when confining the analysis to photons of energies greater than5 gev there is an early hard development of minibursts within this long burst.the effect turns out to be well characterized quantitatively by a lineardependence, within such a miniburst, of the detection time on energy. with theguidance of our findings for grb130427a we can then recognize that some supportfor these features is noticeable also in earlier fermi-lat grbs, particularlyfor the presence of hard minibursts whose onset is marked by the highest-energyphoton observed for the grb. a comparison of these features for grbs atdifferent redshifts provides some encouragement for a redshift dependence ofthe effects of the type expected for a quantum-spacetime interpretation, butother aspects of the analysis appear to invite the interpretation as intrinsicproperties of grbs.

1305.3153	dimensional reduction in the sky	we explore the cosmological implications of a mechanism found in severalapproaches to quantum-gravity, whereby the spectral dimension of spacetime runsfrom the standard value of 4 in the infrared (ir) to a smaller value in theultraviolet (uv). specifically, we invoke the picture where the phenomenon isassociated with modified dispersion relations. with minimal assumptions, wefind that uv behaviour leading to 2 spectral dimensions results in an exactlyscale-invariant spectrum of vacuum scalar and tensor fluctuations, regardlessof the equation of state. the fluctuation production mechanism is analogous tothe one known for varying speed of sound/light models and, unlike in inflation,the spectrum is already scale-invariant before leaving the horizon, remainingso after freeze-in. in the light of planck's recent results we also discussscenarios that break exact scale-invariance, such as the possibility that thespectral dimension runs down to a value slightly higher than 2, or runs down to2 but with an extremely slow transient. we further show that the tensor toscalar ratio is fixed by the uv ratio between the speed of gravity and thespeed of light. not only does our model not require inflation, but at its mostminimal it seems incompatible with it. in contrast, we find that runningspectral dimensions can improve the outlook of the cyclic/ekpyrotic scenario,solving the main problems present in its simplest and most appealingrealisations.

1305.5062	dual redshift on planck-scale-curved momentum spaces	several approaches to the investigation of the quantum-gravity problem haveprovided "theoretical evidence" of a role for the planck scale incharacterizing the geometry of momentum space. one of the main obstructions fora full exploitation of this scenario is the understanding of the role of theplanck-scale-curved geometry of momentum space in the correlations betweenemission and detection times, the "travel times" for a particle to go from agiven emitter to a given detector. these travel times appear to receiveplanck-scale corrections for which no standard interpretation is applicable,and the associated implications for spacetime locality gave rise to the notionof "relative locality" which is still in the early stages of investigation. wehere show that these planck-scale corrections to travel times can be describedas "dual redshift" (or "lateshift"): they are manifestations of momentum-spacecurvature of the same type already known for ordinary redshift produced byspacetime curvature. in turn we can identify the novel notion of "relativemomentum-space locality" as a known but under-appreciated feature associated toordinary redshift produced by spacetime curvature, and this can be described incomplete analogy with the relative spacetime locality that became of interestin the recent quantum-gravity literature. we also briefly comment on how thesefindings may be relevant for an approach to the quantum-gravity problemproposed by max born in 1938 and centered on born duality.

1307.7988	pathways to relativistic curved momentum spaces: de sitter case study	several arguments suggest that the planck scale could be the characteristicscale of curvature of momentum space. as other recent studies we assume thatthe metric of momentum space determines the condition of on-shellness while themomentum-space affine connection governs the form of the law of composition ofmomenta. we show that the possible choices of laws of composition of momentaare more numerous than the possible choices of affine connection on a momentumspace. this motivates us to propose a new prescription for associating anaffine connection to momentum composition, which we compare to the one mostused in the recent literature. we find that the two prescriptions lead to thesame picture of the so-called $\kappa$-momentum space, with de sitter metricand $\kappa$-poincar\'e connection. we also examine in greater detail than everbefore the dsr-relativistic properties of $\kappa$-momentum space, particularlyin relation to its noncommutative law of composition of momenta. we then showthat in the case of "proper de sitter momentum space", with the de sittermetric and its levi-civita connection, the two prescriptions are inequivalent.our novel prescription leads to a picture of proper de sitter momentum spacewhich is dsr-relativistic and is characterized by a commutative law ofcomposition of momenta, a possibility for which no explicitcurved-momentum-space picture had been previously found. we argue that ourconstruction provides a natural test case for the study of momentum spaces withcommutative, and yet deformed, laws of composition of momenta. moreover, it canserve as laboratory for the exploration of the properties of dsr-relativistictheories which are not connected to group-manifold momentum spaces and hopfalgebras.

1309.3999	the measure matters	we adopt a framework where quantum-gravity's dynamical dimensional reductionof spacetime at short distances is described in terms of modified dispersionrelations. we observe that by subjecting such models to a momentum-spacediffeomorphism one obtains a "dual picture" with unmodified dispersionrelations, but a modified measure of integration over momenta. we then findthat the uv {\it hausdorff} dimension of momentum space which can be inferredfrom this modified integration measure coincides with the short-distance {\itspectral} dimension of spacetime. this result sheds light into whyscale-invariant fluctuations are obtained if the original model for two uvspectral dimensions is combined with einstein gravity. by studying theproperties of the inner product we derive the result that it is only in 2energy-momentum dimensions that microphysical vacuum fluctuations arescale-invariant. this is true ignoring gravity, but then we find that ifeinstein gravity is postulated in the original frame, in the dual picturegravity switches off, since all matter becomes conformally coupled. we arguethat our findings imply that the following concepts are closely connected:scale-invariance of vacuum quantum fluctuations, conformal invariance of thegravitational coupling, uv reduction to spectral dimension 2 in position spaceand uv reduction to hausdorff dimension 2 in energy-momentum space.

1407.7891	planck-scale soccer-ball problem: a case of mistaken identity	over the last decade it has been found that nonlinear laws of composition ofmomenta are predicted by some alternative approaches to "real" 4d quantumgravity, and by all formulations of dimensionally-reduced (3d) quantum gravitycoupled to matter. the possible relevance for rather different quantum-gravitymodels has motivated several studies, but this interest is being tempered byconcerns that a nonlinear law of addition of momenta might inevitably produce apathological description of the total momentum of a macroscopic body. i hereshow that such concerns are unjustified, finding that they are rooted infailure to appreciate the differences between two roles for laws composition ofmomentum in physics. previous results relied exclusively on the role of a lawof momentum composition in the description of spacetime locality. however, thenotion of total momentum of a multi-particle system is not a manifestation oflocality, but rather reflects translational invariance. by working within anillustrative example of quantum spacetime i show explicitly that spacetimelocality is indeed reflected in a nonlinear law of composition of momenta, buttranslational invariance still results in an undeformed linear law of additionof momenta building up the total momentum of a multi-particle system.

1412.2054	planck-scale phenomenology with anti-de sitter momentum space	we investigate the anti-de sitter (ads) counterpart to the well studied desitter (ds) model for energy-momentum space, viz "$\kappa$-momentum space"space (with a structure based on the properties of the $\kappa$-poincar\'e hopfalgebra). on the basis of previous preliminary results one might expect the twomodels to be "dual": ds exhibiting an invariant maximal spatial momentum butunbounded energy, ads a maximal energy but unbounded momentum. if that were thecase ads momentum space could be used to implement a principle of maximalplanck-scale energy, just as several studies use ds momentum space to postulateof maximal planck-scale spatial momentum. however several unexpected featuresare uncovered in this paper, which limit the scope of the expected duality, andinterestingly they take different forms in different coordinatizations of adsmomentum space. "cosmological" ads coordinates mimic the ds construction usedfor $\kappa$-momentum space, and produce a carrol limit in the ultraviolet.however, unlike the $\kappa$-momentum space, the boundary of the covered patchbreaks lorentz invariance, thereby introducing a preferred frame. in"horospherical" coordinates we achieve full consistency with frame independenceas far as boost transformations are concerned, but find that rotationalsymmetry is broken, leading to an anisotropic model for the speed of light.finally, in "static" coordinates we find a way of deforming relativistictransformations that successfully enforces frame invariance and isotropy, andproduces a carrol limit in the ultraviolet. however, the phenomenologicalimplications appear to be too weak for any realistic chance of detection. ourresults are also relevant for a long-standing debate on whether or notcoordinate redefinitions in momentum space lead to physically equivalenttheories: our three proposals are evidently physically inequivalent (abridged)

1505.05021	vacuum fluctuations in theories with deformed dispersion relations	we examine vacuum fluctuations in theories with modified dispersion relationswhich represent dimensional reduction at high energies. by changing units ofenergy and momentum we can obtain a description rendering the dispersionrelations undeformed and transferring all the non-trivial effects to theintegration measure in momentum space. using this description we propose ageneral quantization procedure, which should be applicable whether or not thetheory explicitly introduces a preferred frame. based on this scheme weevaluate the power spectrum of quantum vacuum fluctuations. we find that in{\it all} theories which run to 2 dimensions in the ultraviolet the vacuumfluctuations, in the ultraviolet regime, are scale-invariant. this is true inflat space but also for "inside the horizon" modes in an expanding universe. wespell out the conditions upon the gravity theory for this scale-invariance tobe preserved as the modes are frozen-in outside the horizon. we also digress onthe meaning of dimensionality (in momentum and position space) and suggest thatthe spectral index could itself provide an operational definition ofdimensionality.

1507.02056	planck-scale-modified dispersion relations in frw spacetime	in recent years planck-scale modifications of the dispersion relation havebeen attracting increasing interest also from the viewpoint of possibleapplications in astrophysics and cosmology, where spacetime curvature cannot beneglected. nonetheless the interplay between planck-scale effects and spacetimecurvature is still poorly understood, particularly in cases where curvature isnot constant. these challenges have been so far postponed by relying on anansatz, first introduced by jacob and piran. we here propose a general strategyof analysis of the effects of modifications of dispersion relation in frwspacetimes, applicable both to cases where the relativistic equivalence offrames is spoiled ("preferred-frame scenarios") and to the alternativepossibility of "dsr-relativistic theories", theories that are fullyrelativistic but with relativistic laws deformed so that the modifieddispersion relation is observer independent. we show that the jacob-piranansatz implicitly assumes that spacetime translations are not affected by theplanck-scale, while under rather general conditions the same planck-scalequantum-spacetime structures producing modifications of the dispersion relationalso affect translations. through the explicit analysis of one of the effectsproduced by modifications of the dispersion relation, an effect amounting toplanck-scale corrections to travel times, we show that our concerns are notmerely conceptual but rather can have significant quantitative implications.

astro-ph;0008107	planck-scale deformation of lorentz symmetry as a solution to the uhecr  and the tev-$\gamma$ paradoxes	one of the most puzzling current experimental physics paradoxes is thearrival on earth of ultra high energy cosmic rays with energies above the gzkthreshold. the recent observation of 20tev photons from mk 501 is anothersomewhat similar paradox. several models have been proposed for the uhecrparadox. no solution has yet been proposed for the tev-$\gamma$ paradox.remarkably, the drastic assumption of a violation of ordinary lorentzinvariance would resolve both paradoxes. we present a formalism for thedescription of the type of lorentz-invariance deformation (lid) that could beinduced by non-trivial short-distance structure of space-time, and we show thatthis formalism is well suited for comparison of experimental data with lidpredictions. we use the uhecr and tev-$\gamma$ data, as well as bounds ontime-of-flight differences between photons of different energies, to constrainthe lid parameter space. a model with only two parameters, an energy scale anda dimensionless parameter characterizing the functional dependence on theenergy scale, is shown to be sufficient to solve both the uhecr and thetev-$\gamma$ threshold anomalies while satisfying the time-of-flight bounds.the allowed region of the two-parameter space is relatively small, but,remarkably, it fits perfectly the expectations of the quantum-gravity-motivatedspace-time models known to support such deformations of lorentz invariance:integer value of the dimensionless parameter and characteristic energy scaleconstrained to a narrow interval in the neighborhood of the planck scale.

astro-ph;0209232	kinematical solution of the uhe-cosmic-ray puzzle without a preferred  class of inertial observers	among the possible explanations for the puzzling observations of cosmic raysabove the gzk cutoff there is growing interest in the ones that representkinematical solutions, based either on general formulations of particle physicswith small violations of lorentz symmetry or on a quantum-gravity-motivatedscheme for the breakup of lorentz symmetry. an unappealing aspect of thesecosmic-ray-puzzle solutions is that they require the existence of a preferredclass of inertial observers. here i propose a new kinematical solution of thecosmic-ray puzzle, which does not require the existence of a preferred class ofinertial observers. my proposal is a new example of a type of relativistictheories, the so-called "doubly-special-relativity" theories, which havealready been studied extensively over the last two years. the core ingredientof the proposal is a deformation of lorentz transformations in which also theplanck scale $e_p$ (in addition to the speed-of-light scale $c$) is describedas an invariant. just like the introduction of the invariant $c$ requires adeformation of the galileian transformations into the lorentz transformations,the introduction of the invariant $e_p$ requires a deformation of the lorentztransformations, but there is no special class of inertial observers. thepierre auger observatory and the glast space telescope should play a key rolein future developments of these investigations. i also emphasize that thedoubly-special-relativity theory here proposed, besides being the first one toprovide a solution for the cosmic-ray puzzle, is also the first one in which anatural description of macroscopic bodies is achieved, and may findapplications in the context of a recently-proposed dark-energy scenario.

gr-qc;0104005	phenomenological description of space-time foam	the expectation that it should not be possible to gain experimental insighton the structure of space-time at planckian distance scales has been recentlychallenged by several studies. with respect to space-time fluctuations, one ofthe conjectured features of quantum-gravity foam, the experiments that have thebest sensitivity are the ones which were originally devised for searches of theclassical-physics phenomenon of gravity waves. in experiments searching forclassical gravity waves the presence of space-time fluctuations would introducea source of noise just like the ordinary (non-gravitational) quantum propertiesof the photons composing the laser beam used in interferometry introduce asource of noise. earlier studies of the noise induced by quantum properties ofspace-time have shown that certain simple pictures of fluctuations ofspace-time occuring genuinely at the planck scale would lead to an observablylarge effect. experimentalists would benefit from the guidance of detaileddescription of this noise, but quantum-gravity theories are not yet developedto the point of allowing such detailed analysis of physical processes. ipropose a new phenomenological approach to the description of foam-inducednoise.

gr-qc;0201012	quantum space-time: deformed symmetries versus broken symmetries	several recent studies have concerned the faith of classical symmetries inquantum space-time. in particular, it appears likely that quantum (discretized,noncommutative,...) versions of minkowski space-time would not enjoy theclassical lorentz symmetries. i compare two interesting cases: the case inwhich the classical symmetries are "broken", i.e. at the quantum level someclassical symmetries are lost, and the case in which the classical symmetriesare "deformed", i.e. the quantum space-time has as many symmetries as itsclassical counterpart but the nature of these symmetries is affected by thespace-time quantization procedure. while some general features, such as theemergence of deformed dispersion relations, characterize both thesymmetry-breaking case and the symmetry-deformation case, the two scenarios arealso characterized by sharp differences, even concerning the nature of the neweffects predicted. i illustrate this point within an illustrative calculationconcerning the role of space-time symmetries in the evaluation ofparticle-decay amplitudes. the results of the analysis here reported also showthat the indications obtained by certain dimensional arguments, such as theones recently considered in hep-ph/0106309 may fail to uncover some keyfeatures of quantum space-time symmetries.

gr-qc;0205125	on the fate of lorentz symmetry in loop quantum gravity and  noncommutative spacetimes	i analyze the deformation of lorentz symmetry that holds in certainnoncommutative spacetimes and the way in which lorentz symmetry is broken inother noncommutative spacetimes. i also observe that discretization of areasdoes not necessarily require departures from lorentz symmetry. this is due tothe fact that lorentz symmetry has no implications for exclusive measurement ofthe area of a surface, but it governs the combined measurements of the area andthe velocity of a surface. in a quantum-gravity theory lorentz symmetry can beconsistent with area discretization, but only when the observables ``area ofthe surface" and "velocity of the surface" enjoy certain special properties. iargue that the status of lorentz symmetry in the loop-quantum-gravity approachrequires careful scrutiny, since areas are discretized within a formalism that,at least presently, does not include an observable "velocity of the surface".in general it may prove to be very difficult to reconcile lorentz symmetry witharea discretization in theories of canonical quantization of gravity, because aproper description of lorentz symmetry appears to require that thefundamental/primary role be played by the surface's world-sheet, whose"projection" along the space directions of a given observer describes theobservable area, whereas the canonical formalism only allows the introductionas primary entities of observables defined at a fixed (common) time, and theobservers that can be considered must share that time variable.

gr-qc;0309054	the three perspectives on the quantum-gravity problem and their  implications for the fate of lorentz symmetry	each approach to the quantum-gravity problem originates from expertise in oneor another area of theoretical physics. the particle-physics perspectiveencourages one to attempt to reproduce in quantum gravity as much as possibleof the successes of the standard model of particle physics, and therefore, asdone in string theory, the core features of quantum gravity are described interms of graviton-like exchange in a background classical spacetime. from thegeneral-relativity perspective it is natural to renounce to any reference to abackground spacetime, and to describe spacetime in a way that takes intoaccount the in-principle limitations of measurements. the loop quantum gravityapproach and the approaches based on noncommutative geometry originate fromthis general-relativity perspective. the condensed-matter perspective, whichhas been adopted in a few recent quantum-gravity proposals, naturally leads toscenarios in which some familiar properties of spacetime are only emergent,just like, for example, some emergent collective degrees of freedom arerelevant to the description of certain physical systems only near a criticalpoint. both from the general-relativity perspective and from thecondensed-matter perspective it is natural to explore the possibility thatquantum gravity might have significant implications for the fate of lorentzsymmetry in the planckian regime. from the particle-physics perspective thereis instead no obvious reason to renounce to exact lorentz symmetry, although(``spontaneous'') lorentz symmetry breaking is of course possible. afast-growing phenomenological programme looking for planck-scale departuresfrom lorentz symmetry can contribute to this ongoing debate.

gr-qc;0312124	phenomenology of doubly special relativity	investigations of the possibility that some novel ``quantum" properties ofspacetime might induce a modification dispersion relation focused at first onscenarios with planck-scale violations of lorentz symmetry. more recentlyseveral studies have considered the possibility of a ``doubly specialrelativity", in which the modification of the dispersion relation emerges froma framework with both the planck scale and the speed-of-light scale ascharacteristic scales of a deformation of the lorentz transformations. for theschemes with broken lorentz symmetry at the planck scale there is a largeliterature on the derivation of experimental limits. we provide here acorresponding analysis for the doubly-special-relativity framework. we findthat the analyses of photon stability, synchrotron radiation, and thresholdconditions for particle production in collision processes, the three contextswhich are considered as most promising for constraining thebroken-lorentz-symmetry scenario, cannot provide significant constraints ondoubly-special-relativity parameter space. however, certain types of analysesof gamma-ray bursts are sensitive to the symmetry deformation. a key element ofour study is an observation that removes a possible sign ambiguity for thedoubly-special-relativity framework. this result also allows us to characterizemore sharply the differences between the doubly-special-relativity frameworkand the framework of k-poincare hopf algebras, two frameworks which are oftenconfused with each other in the literature.

gr-qc;0402092	some encouraging and some cautionary remarks on doubly special  relativity in quantum gravity	the idea of a role for dsr (doubly-special relativity) in quantum gravityfinds some encouragement in a few scenarios, but in order to explore some keyconceptual issues it is necessary to find a well-understood toy-quantum-gravitymodel that is fully compatible with the dsr principles. perhaps the mostsignificant source of encouragement comes from the recent proposal of a pathfor the emergence of dsr in loop quantum gravity, which however relies on a fewassumptions on the results of some computations that we are still unable toperform. indications in favor of the possibility of using some elements of$\kappa$-poincar\'e hopf algebras (and of the related $\kappa$-minkowskinoncommutative spacetime) for the construction of a dsr theory have beendiscussed extensively, but a few stubborn open issues must still be resolved,especially in the two-particle sector. it has been recently observed thatcertain structures encountered in a formulation of 2+1-dimensionalclassical-gravity models would fit naturally in a dsr framework, but some keyelements of these 2+1-dimensional models, including the description ofobservers, might be incompatible with the dsr principles.

hep-ph;0006210	cosmic rays and tev photons as probes of quantum properties of space-time	it has been recently observed that small violations of lorentz invariance, ofa type which may arise in quantum gravity, could explain both the observationsof cosmic rays above the gzk cutoff and the observations of 20-tev gamma raysfrom markarian 501. we show here that different pictures of the short-distancestructure of space-time would lead to different manifestations oflorentz-invariance violation. specifically, the deformation of lorentzinvariance needed to resolve these observational paradoxes can only arisewithin commutative short-distance pictures of space-time. in noncommutativespace-times there is no anomalous effect, at least at leading order. alsoexploiting the fact that arrival-time delays between high energy photons withdifferent energies would arise in both the commutative and the noncommutativelorentz-violation pictures, we describe an experimental programme, based ontime-of-arrival analysis of high energy photons and searches of violations ofgzk and tev-photon limits, which could discriminate between alternativescenarios of lorentz-invariance breakdown and could provide and unexpectedwindow on the (quantum) nature of space-time at very short distances.

0812.2675	on the distance observable in the moyal plane and in a novel  two-dimensional space with string-theory pregeometry	motivation for the study of spacetime noncommutativity comes primarily fromits possible use in investigations of (planck-scale) spacetime fuzziness, butmost work focuses on s-matrix/field-theory observables and still very littlehas been established for geometric observables. we argue that it might beuseful to exploit the "pregeometric" formulation of spacetime noncommutativity,which in particular describes the coordinates of the moyal plane in terms ofthe phase-space coordinates of a point particle "living" in aauxiliary/fictitious spacetime ($\{x_1,x_2\}_{moyal} \equiv\{q,p\}_{particle}$). this leads us straightforwardly to a distance operatorfor the moyal plane, and allows us to expose some limitations of a previousattempt to describe the "area of a disc" in the moyal plane. we also observethat from our pregeometric perspective it is rather natural to contemplate aspacetime whose pregeometric picture is based on the phase-space coordinates(fields) of a string. the fact that such "stringspaces" essentially providespacetime points with extendedness is relevant for the fuzziness of geometricspacetime observables in ways that we preliminarily characterize through ananalysis of the distance observable on a two-dimensional stringspace andthrough the observation that by implementing theamati-ciafaloni-veneziano/gross-mende uncertainty relation in the phase spaceof the pregeometric string one could have stringspaces with a novel type offuzzy coordinates.
