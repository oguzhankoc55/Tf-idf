1106.4410	1 um excess sources in the ukidss - i. three t dwarfs in the sdss  southern equatorial stripe	we report the discovery of two field brown dwarfs, ulas j0128-0041 and ulasj0321+0051, and the rediscovery of ulas j0226+0051 (ifa 0230-z1), in the sloandigital sky survey (sdss) southern equatorial stripe. they are found in thecourse of our follow-up observation program of 1 um excess sources in theunited kingdom infrared telescope infrared deep sky survey. the geminimulti-object spectrographs spectra at red optical wavelengths (6500-10500 a)are presented, which reveal that they are early-t dwarfs. the classification isalso supported by their optical to near-infrared colors. it is noted that ulasj0321+0051 is one of the faintest currently known t dwarfs. the estimateddistances to the three objects are 50-110 pc, thus they are among the mostdistant field t dwarfs known. dense temporal coverage of the target fieldsachieved by the sdss-ii supernova survey allows us to perform a simpletime-series analysis, which leads to the finding of significant proper motionsof 150-290 mas/yr or the transverse velocities of 40-100 km/s for ulasj0128-0041 and ulas j0226+0051. we also find that there are no detectable,long-term (a-few-year) brightness variations above a few times 0.1 mag for thetwo brown dwarfs.

1303.0938	diffuse galactic light in the field of the translucent high galactic  latitude cloud mbm32	we have conducted b, g, v, and r-band imaging in a 45x40 arcmin^2 fieldcontaining part of the high galactic latitude translucent cloud mbm32, andcorrelated the intensity of diffuse optical light s_\nu(\lambda) with that of100 micron emission s_\nu(100um). a chi^2 minimum analysis is applied to fit alinear function to the measured correlation and derive the slope parameterb(\lambda)= \delta s_\nu(\lambda) / \delta s_\nu(100um) of the best-fit linearfunction. compiling a sample by combining our b(\lambda) and published ones, weshow that the b(\lambda) strength varies from cloud to cloud by a factor of 4.finding that b(\lambda) decreases as s_\nu(100um) increases in the sample, wesuggest that a non-linear correlation including a quadratic term ofs_\nu(100um)^2 should be fitted to the measured correlation. the variation ofoptical depth, which is a_v = 0.16 - 2.0 in the sample, can change b(\lambda)by a factor of 2 - 3. there would be some contribution to the large b(\lambda)variation from the forward-scattering characteristic of dust grains which iscoupled to the non-isotropic interstellar radiation field (isrf). models of thescattering of diffuse galactic light (dgl) underestimate the b(\lambda) valuesby a factor of 2. this could be reconciled by deficiency in uv photons in theisrf or by a moderate increase in dust albedo. our b(\lambda) spectrum favors acontribution from extended red emission (ere) to the diffuse optical light;b(\lambda) rises from b to v faster than the models, seems to peak around 6000\aa, and decreases towards long wavelengths. such a characteristic is expectedfrom the models in which the dgl is combined with ere.

1403.1693	a new method for measuring extragalactic distances	we have pioneered a new method for the measurement of extragalacticdistances. this method uses the time-lag between variations in the shortwavelength and long wavelength light from an active galactic nucleus (agn),based on a quantitative physical model of dust reverberation that relates thetime-lag to the absolute luminosity of the agn. we use the large homogeneousdata set from intensive monitoring observations in optical and near-infraredwavelength bands with the dedicated 2-m magnum telescope to obtain thedistances to 17 agns in the redshift range z=0.0024 to z=0.0353. these distancemeasurements are compared with distances measured using cepheid variable stars,and are used to infer that h_0= 73 +- 3 (random) km/s/mpc. the systematic errorin h_0 is examined, and the uncertainty in the size distribution of dust grainsis the largest source of the systematic error, which is much reduced for asample of agns for which their parameter values in the model of dustreverberation are individually measured. this agn time-lag method can be usedbeyond 30 mpc, the farthest distance reached by extragalactic cepheids, and canbe extended to high-redshift quasi-stellar objects.

1406.2078	reverberation measurements of the inner radius of the dust torus in 17  seyfert galaxies	we present the results of a dust reverberation survey for 17 nearby seyfert 1galaxies, which provides the largest homogeneous data collection for the radiusof the innermost dust torus. a delayed response of the k-band light curve afterthe v-band light curve was found for all targets, and 49 measurements of lagtimes between the flux variation of the dust emission in the k band and that ofthe optical continuum emission in the v band were obtained. the lag timesstrongly correlated with the optical luminosity in the luminosity range ofm_v=-16 to -22 mag, and the regression analysis was performed to obtain thecorrelation log $\delta t$ (days) = -2.11 -0.2 m_v assuming $\delta t \proptol^{0.5}$, which was theoretically expected. we discuss the possible origins ofthe intrinsic scatter of the dust lag-luminosity correlation, which wasestimated to be about 0.13 dex, and we find that the difference of internalextinction and delayed response of changes in lag times to the flux variationscould have partly contributed to intrinsic scatter. however, we could notdetect any systematic change of the correlation with the subclass of theseyfert type or the eddington ratio. finally, we compare the dust reverberationradius with the near-infrared interferometric radius of the dust torus and thereverberation radius of broad balmer emission lines. the interferometric radiusin the k band was found to be systematically larger than the dust reverberationradius in the same band by about a factor of two, which could be interpreted bythe difference between the flux-weighted radius and the response-weightedradius of the innermost dust torus. the reverberation radius of the broadbalmer emission lines was found to be systematically smaller than the dustreverberation radius by about a factor of 4-5, which strongly supports theunified scheme of the seyfert type of active galactic nuclei.

0806.1434	optical to near-ir spectrum of a massive evolved galaxy at z = 1.26	we present the optical to near-infrared (ir) spectrum of the galaxy tspsj1329-0957, a red and bright member of the class of extremely red objects(eros) at z = 1.26. this galaxy was found in the course of the tokyo-stromlophotometry survey (tsps) which we are conducting in the southern sky. thespectroscopic observations were carried out with the gemini multi-objectspectrograph (gmos) and the gemini near infra-red spectrograph (gnirs) mountedon the gemini-south telescope. the wide wavelength coverage of 0.6 - 2.3 umprovides useful clues as to the nature of eros while most published spectra arelimited to a narrower spectral range which is dictated by the need forefficient redshift determination in a large survey. we compare our spectrumwith several optical composite spectra obtained in recent large surveys, andwith stellar population synthesis models. the effectiveness of using near-irbroad-band data, instead of the spectral data, in deriving the galaxyproperties are also investigated. we find that tsps j1329-0957 formed when theuniverse was 2 - 3 gyr old, and subsequently evolved passively to become one ofthe most massive galaxies found in the z = 1 - 2 universe. its early type andestimated stellar mass of m* = 10^{11.5} msun clearly point to this galaxybeing a direct ancestor of the brightest elliptical and spheroidal galaxies inthe local universe.

astro-ph;0001272	the macho project: microlensing results from 5.7 years of lmc  observations	we report on our search for microlensing towards the large magellanic cloud(lmc). analysis of 5.7 years of photometry on 11.9 million stars in the lmcreveals 13 - 17 microlensing events. this is significantly more than the $\sim$2 to 4 events expected from lensing by known stellar populations. thetimescales ($\that$) of the events range from 34 to 230 days. we estimate themicrolensing optical depth towards the lmc from events with $2 &lt; \that &lt; 400$days to be 1.2 ^{+0.4}_ {-0.3} \ten{-7}$, with an additional 20% to 30% ofsystematic error. the spatial distribution of events is mildly inconsistentwith lmc/lmc disk self-lensing, but is consistent with an extended lensdistribution such as a milky way or lmc halo. interpreted in the context of agalactic dark matter halo, consisting partially of compact objects, a maximumlikelihood analysis gives a macho halo fraction of 20% for a typical halo modelwith a 95% confidence interval of 8% to 50%. a 100% macho halo is ruled out atthe 95% c.l. for all except our most extreme halo model. interpreted as agalactic halo population, the most likely macho mass is between $ 0.15 \msun$and $ 0.9 \msun$, depending on the halo model, and the total mass in machos outto 50 kpc is found to be 9+4-3 10^{10} msun, independent of the halo model.these results are marginally consistent with our previous results, but arelower by about a factor of two. besides a larger data set, this work alsoincludes an improved efficiency determination, improved likelihood analysis,and more thorough testing of systematic errors, especially with respect to thetreatment of potential backgrounds to microlensing, such as supernovae ingalaxies behind the lmc.

astro-ph;0001435	the macho project 9 million star color-magnitude diagram of the large  magellanic cloud	we present a 9 million star color-magnitude diagram (9m cmd) of the lmc bar.the 9m cmd reveals a complex superposition of different age and metallicitystellar populations, with important stellar evolutionary phases occurring over3 orders of magnitude in number density. first, we count the non-variablesupergiants, the associated cepheids, and measure the effective temperaturesdefining the instability strip. lifetime predictions of stellar evolutiontheory are tested, with implications for the origin of low-luminosity cepheids.the highly-evolved agb stars have a bimodal distribution in brightness, whichwe interpret as discrete old populations (&gt;1 gyr). the faint agb may bemetal-poor and very old. we identify the clusters ngc 411 and m3 as templatesfor the admixture of old stellar populations. however, there are indicationsthat the old and metal-poor field population has a red hb morphology: the rrlyraes lie on the red edge of the instability strip, the agb-bump is very red,and the ratio of agb-bump stars to rr lyraes is quite large. if the hb secondparameter is age, the old and metal-poor field population likely formed afterthe oldest clusters. lifetime predictions of stellar evolution theory lead usto associate a significant fraction of the red hb clump giants with the sameold and metal-poor population producing the rr lyraes and the agb-bump. in thiscase, compared to the age-dependent luminosity predictions of stellar evolutiontheory, the red hb clump is too bright relative to the rr lyraes and agb-bump.last, the surface density profile of rr lyraes is fit by an exponential,favoring a disk-like rather than spheroidal distribution. we conclude that theage of the lmc disk is probably similar to the age of the galactic disk.(abridged)

astro-ph;0002510	the macho project: microlensing optical depth towards the galactic bulge  from difference image analysis	we present the microlensing optical depth towards the galactic bulge based onthe detection of 99 events found in our difference image analysis (dia) survey.this analysis encompasses three years of data, covering ~ 17 million stars in ~4 deg^2, to a source star baseline magnitude limit of v = 23. the dia techniqueimproves the quality of photometry in crowded fields, and allows us to detectmore microlensing events with faint source stars. we find this method increasesthe number of detection events by 85% compared with the standard analysistechnique. dia light curves of the events are presented and the microlensingfit parameters are given. the total microlensing optical depth is estimated tobe tau_(total)= 2.43^(+0.39/-0.38) x 10^(-6) averaged over 8 fields centered atl=2.68 and b=-3.35. for the bulge component we findtau_(bulge)=3.23^(+0.52/-0.50) x 10^(-6) assuming a 25% stellar contributionfrom disk sources. these optical depths are in good agreement with the pastdeterminations of the macho alcock et al. (1997) and ogle udalski et al. (1994)groups, and are higher than predicted by contemporary galactic models. we showthat our observed event timescale distribution is consistent with thedistribution expected from normal mass stars, if we adopt the stellar massfunction of scalo (1986) as our lens mass function. however, we note that asthere is still disagreement about the exact form of the stellar mass function,there is uncertainty in this conclusion. based on our event timescaledistribution we find no evidence for the existence of a large population ofbrown dwarfs in the direction of the galactic bulge.

astro-ph;0003392	the macho project: microlensing detection efficiency	the macho project is a search for dark matter in the form of massive compacthalo objects (machos). the project has photometrically monitored tens ofmillions of stars in the large magellanic cloud (lmc), small magellanic cloud(smc), and galactic bulge in search of rare gravitational microlensing eventscaused by these otherwise invisible objects. in 5.7 years of observationstoward the lmc some 13-17 microlensing events have been observed by the machosurvey, allowing powerful statements to be made about the nature of the darkpopulation in the halo of our galaxy. a critical component of these statementsis an accurate determination of the survey's detection efficiency. thedetection efficiency is a complicated function of temporal sampling, stellarcrowding (the luminosity function), image quality, photometry, time-seriesanalysis, and criteria used to select the microlensing candidates. such acomplex interdependence is most naturally solved using a monte carlo approach.here we describe the details of the monte carlo used to calculate theefficiency presented in the macho 5.7-year lmc results. here we correct severalshortcomings of past determinations, including (1) adding fainter source stars(2.5 magnitudes below our faintest detected "stars"), (2) an up-to-dateluminosity function for the lmc, (3) better sampling of real images in bothstellar density and observing conditions, (4) an improved scheme for addingartificial microlensing onto a random sample of real lightcurves, and manyother improvements.

astro-ph;0008282	the macho project hubble space telescope follow-up: preliminary results  on the location of the large magellanic cloud microlensing source stars	we attempt to determine whether the macho microlensing source stars are drawnfrom the average population of the lmc or from a population behind the lmc byexamining the hst color-magnitude diagram (cmd) of microlensing source stars.we present wfpc2 hst photometry of eight macho microlensing source stars andthe surrounding fields in the lmc. the microlensing source stars are identifiedby deriving accurate centroids in the ground-based macho images usingdifference image analysis (dia) and then transforming the dia coordinates tothe hst frame. we consider in detail a model for the background population ofsource stars based on that presented by zhao, graff &amp; guhathakurta. in thismodel, the source stars have an additional reddening &lt;e(b-v)&gt; = 0.13 mag and aslightly larger distance modulus &lt;delta mu&gt; ~ 0.3 mag than the average lmcpopulation. we also investigate a series of source star models, varying therelative fraction of source stars drawn from the average and backgroundpopulations and the displacement of the background population from the lmc. dueto the small number of analyzed events the distribution of probabilities ofdifferent models is rather flat. a shallow maximum occurs at a fraction s_lmc ~0.8 of the source stars in the lmc. this is consistent with the interpretationthat a significant fraction of observed microlensing events are due to lensesin the milky way halo, but does not definitively exclude other models.

astro-ph;0106430	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: the population of nearby radio galaxies  at the 1 mjy level	we use redshift determinations and spectral analysis of galaxies in the 2dfgalaxy redshift survey to study the properties of local radio sources with$s\ge 1$ mjy. 557 objects drawn from the first survey, corresponding to 2.3 percent of the total radio sample, are found in the 2dfgrs cataloge within thearea $9^h 48^m \simlt {\rm ra}({\rm 2000}) \simlt 14^h 32^m$ and $-2.77^\circ\simlt {\rm dec}({\rm 2000}) \simlt 2.25^\circ$, down to a magnitude limit$b_j= 19.45$. the excellent quality of 2df spectra allows us to divide thesesources into classes, according to their optical spectra. radio galaxies (i.e.absorption systems, mainly belonging to the class of fr i sources, whosespectra may or may not show emission lines due to agn activity) make up 63 percent of the spectroscopic sample; they are characterized by relatively highradio-to-optical ratios, red colours and luminosities $10^{21}\simlt p_{1.4{\rmghz}} w hz^${-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ \simlt 10^{24}$. actively star-forming galaxiesinstead contribute with 30 per cent to the total sample. these objects --principally found at low redshifts ($z \simlt 0.1$) -- in general show lowradio-to-optical ratios, blue colours and low radio luminosities. we also found18 seyfert 2 galaxies and 4 seyfert 1's. analysis of the local radio luminosityfunction shows that radio galaxies are well described by models that assumepure luminosity evolution, at least down to radio powers $p_{1.4{\rmghz}}\simlt 10^{20.5} w hz$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ late-type galaxies, whose relativecontribution to the rlf is found to be lower than was predicted by previouswork, present a luminosity function which is compatible with the iras galaxylf, and therefore plausibly constitute the radio counterpart of the dustyspirals and starbursts that dominate the counts at 60 $\mu$m.

astro-ph;0109467	gravitational microlensing events due to stellar mass black holes	we present an analysis of the longest timescale microlensing eventsdiscovered by the macho collaboration during a 7 year survey of the galacticbulge. we find 6 events that exhibit very strong microlensing parallax signalsdue, in part, to accurate photometric data from the gman and mpscollaborations. the microlensing parallax fit parameters are used in alikelihood analysis, which is able to estimate the distance and masses of thelens objects based upon a standard model of the galactic velocity distribution.this analysis indicates that the most likely masses of 5 of the 6 lenses are &gt;1 msun, which suggests that a substantial fraction of the galactic lenses maybe massive stellar remnants. this could explain the observed excess of longtimescale microlensing events. the lenses for events macho-96-blg-5 andmacho-98-blg-6 are the most massive, with mass estimates of m/msun = 6 +10/-3and m/msun = 6 +7/-3, respectively. the observed upper limits on the absolutebrightness of main sequence stars for these lenses are &lt; 1 lsun, so both lensesare black hole candidates. the black hole interpretation is also favored by alikelihood analysis with a bayesian prior using a conventional model for thelens mass function. we consider the possibility that the source stars for someof these 6 events may lie in the foreground or background of the galacticbulge, but we find that this is unlikely. future hst observations of theseevents can either confirm the black hole lens hypothesis or detect the lensstars and provide a direct measurement of their masses. future observations ofsimilar events by sim or the keck or vlti interferometers will allow directmeasurements of the lens masses for stellar remnant lenses as well.

astro-ph;0110676	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: constraints on cosmic star-formation  history from the cosmic spectrum	we present the first results on the history of star formation in the universebased on the `cosmic spectrum', in particular, the volume-averaged,luminosity-weighted, stellar absorption line spectrum of present day galaxiesfrom the 2dfgrs. this method is novel in that unlike previous studies it is notan estimator based on total luminosity density. the cosmic spectrum is fittedwith models of population synthesis, tracing the history of star formationprior to the epoch of the observed galaxies, using a method we have developedwhich decouples continuum and spectral-line variations and is robust againstspectrophotometric uncertainties. the cosmic spectrum can only be fitted withmodels incorporating chemical evolution and indicates there was a peak ofstar-formation rate in the past of at least three times the current value andthat the increase back to z=1, assuming it scales as (1+z)^beta, has a strongupper limit of beta&lt;5. we find in the general case there is some modeldegeneracy between star formation at low and high redshift. however, if weincorporate previous work on star formation at z&lt;1 we can put strong upperlimits on the sfr at z&gt;1: e.g., if beta&gt;2 then the sfr for 1&lt;z&lt;5 scales as(1+z)^alpha with alpha&lt;2. this is equivalent to stating that no more than 80%of stars in the universe formed at z&gt;1. our results are consistent with thebest-fit results from compilations of cosmic sfr estimates based on uvluminosity density, which give 1.8&lt;beta&lt;2.9 and -1.0&lt;alpha&lt;0.7, and are alsoconsistent with estimates of omega_stars based on the k-band luminositydensity.

astro-ph;0112043	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: the dependence of galaxy clustering on  luminosity and spectral type	we investigate the dependence of galaxy clustering on luminosity and spectraltype using the 2df galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs). spectral types are assignedusing the principal component analysis of madgwick et al. we divide the sampleinto two broad spectral classes: galaxies with strong emission lines(`late-types'), and more quiescent galaxies (`early-types'). we measure theclustering in real space, free from any distortion of the clustering patterndue to peculiar velocities, for a series of volume-limited samples. theprojected correlation functions of both spectral types are well described by apower law for transverse separations in the range 2 &lt; (sigma/mpc/h) &lt; 15, witha marginally steeper slope for early-types than late-types. both early and latetypes have approximately the same dependence of clustering strength onluminosity, with the clustering amplitude increasing by a factor of ~2.5between l* and 4 l*. at all luminosities, however, the correlation functionamplitude for the early-types is ~50% higher than that of the late-types. theseresults support the view that luminosity, and not type, is the dominant factorin determining how the clustering strength of the whole galaxy populationvaries with luminosity.

astro-ph;0112161	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: the bias of galaxies and the density of  the universe	we compute the bispectrum of the 2df galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) and useit to measure the bias parameter of the galaxies. this parameter quantifies thestrength of clustering of the galaxies relative to the mass in the universe. byanalysing 80 million triangle configurations in the wavenumber range 0.1 &lt; k &lt;0.5 h/mpc (i.e. on scales roughly between 5 and 30 mpc/h) we find that thelinear bias parameter is consistent with unity: b_1=1.04 pm 0.11, and thequadratic (nonlinear) bias is consistent with zero: b_2=-0.054 pm 0.08. thus,at least on large scales, optically-selected galaxies do indeed trace theunderlying mass distribution. the bias parameter can be combined with the2dfgrs measurement of the redshift distortion parameter beta =omega_m^{0.6}/b_1, to yield omega_m = 0.27 pm 0.06 for the matter density ofthe universe, a result which is determined entirely from this survey,independently of other datasets. our measurement of the matter density of theuniverse should be interpreted as omega_m at the effective redshift of thesurvey (z=0.17).

astro-ph;0303668	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: galaxy clustering per spectral type	we have calculated the two-point correlation functions in redshift space,xi(sigma,pi), for galaxies of different spectral types in the 2df galaxyredshift survey. using these correlation functions we are able to estimatevalues of the linear redshift-space distortion parameter, beta = omega_m^0.6/b,the pairwise velocity dispersion, a, and the real-space correlation function,xi(r), for galaxies with both relatively low star-formation rates (for whichthe present rate of star formation is less than 10% of its past averaged value)and galaxies with higher current star-formation activity. at small separations,the real-space clustering of passive galaxies is very much stronger than thatof the more actively star-forming galaxies; the correlation-function slopes arerespectively 1.93 and 1.50, and the relative bias between the two classes is adeclining function of radius. on scales larger than 10 h^-1 mpc there isevidence that the relative bias tends to a constant, b(passive)/b(active) ~ 1.this result is consistent with the similar degrees of redshift-spacedistortions seen in the correlation functions of the two classes -- thecontours of xi(sigma,pi) require beta(active)=0.49+/-0.13, andbeta(passive)=0.48+/-0.14. the pairwise velocity dispersion is highlycorrelated with beta. however, despite this a significant difference is seenbetween the two classes. over the range 8-20 h^-1 mpc, the pairwise velocitydispersion has mean values 416+/-76 km/s and 612+/-92 km/s for the active andpassive galaxy samples respectively. this is consistent with the expectationfrom morphological segregation, in which passively evolving galaxiespreferentially inhabit the cores of high-mass virialised regions.

astro-ph;0304464	recent microlensing results from the macho project	we describe a few recent microlensing results from the macho collaboration.the aim of the macho project was the identification and quantitativedescription of dark and luminous matter in the milky way using microlensingtoward the magellanic clouds and galactic bulge. we start with a discussion ofthe hst follow-up observations of the microlensing events toward the lmcdetected in the first 5 years of the experiment. using color-magnitude diagramswe attempt to distinguish between two possible locations of the microlensingsources: 1) in the lmc or 2) behind the lmc. we conclude that unless theextinction is extremely patchy, it is very unlikely that most of the lmc eventshave sources behind the lmc. during an examination of the hst images of the 13lmc events we found a very red object next to the source star of event lmc-5.astrometry, microlensing parallax fit, and a spectrum suggest that in this casewe directly image the lens - a low-mass disk star.  then we focus on the majority of events observed by the macho project, whichare detected toward the galactic bulge. we argue that the microlensing opticaldepth toward the bulge is best measured using events that have clump giantsources, which are almost unaffected by blending. from this sample we derive alow optical depth toward the galactic bulge of (1.4 +/- 0.3) x 10^{-6}, in goodagreement with other observational constraints and with theoretical models. thepresence of many long-duration events among the bulge candidates allows us toinvestigate the microlensing parallax effect. events with the strongestparallax signal are probably due to massive remnants. events macho-96-blg-5 andmacho-98-blg-6 might have been caused by the 6-solar-mass black holes.

astro-ph;0401405	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: hierarchical galaxy clustering	we use the two-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) to test thehierarchical scaling hypothesis: namely, that the $p$-point galaxy correlationfunctions can be written in terms of the two point correlation function orvariance. this scaling is expected if an initially gaussian distribution ofdensity fluctuations evolves under the action of gravitational instability. wemeasure the volume averaged $p$-point correlation functions using a counts incells technique applied to a volume limited sample of 44,931 $l_*$ galaxies. wedemonstrate that $l_{*}$ galaxies display hierarchical clustering up to order$p=6$ in redshift space. the variance measured for $l_{*}$ galaxies is inexcellent agreement with the predictions from a $\lambda$-cold dark mattern-body simulation. this applies to all cell radii considered,$0.3&lt;(r/h^{-1}{\rm mpc})&lt;30$. however, the higher order correlation functionsof $l_*$ galaxies have a significantly smaller amplitude than is predicted forthe dark matter for $r&lt;10h^{-1}$mpc. this disagreement implies that anon-linear bias exists between the dark matter and $l_*$ galaxies on thesescales. we also show that the presence of two rare, massive superclusters inthe 2dfgrs has an impact on the higher-order clustering moments measured onlarge scales.

astro-ph;0501174	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: power-spectrum analysis of the final  dataset and cosmological implications	we present a power spectrum analysis of the final 2df galaxy redshift survey,employing a direct fourier method. the sample used comprises 221,414 galaxieswith measured redshifts. we investigate in detail the modelling of the sampleselection. a new angular mask is derived, based on revisions to the photometriccalibration. the redshift selection function is determined by dividing thesurvey according to rest-frame colour, and deducing a self-consistent treatmentof k-corrections and evolution for each population. the covariance matrix forthe power-spectrum estimates is determined using two different approaches tothe construction of mock surveys which are used to demonstrate that the inputcosmological model can be correctly recovered. we are confident that the 2dfgrspower spectrum can be used to infer the matter content of the universe. onlarge scales, our estimated power spectrum shows evidence for the `baryonoscillations' that are predicted in cdm models. fitting to a cdm model,assuming a primordial $n_{s}=1$ spectrum, $h=0.72$ and negligible neutrinomass, the preferred parameters are $\omega_{m} h = 0.168 \pm 0.016$ and abaryon fraction $\omega_{b} /\omega_{m} = 0.185\pm0.046$ (1$\sigma$ errors).the value of $\omega_{m} h$ is $1\sigma$ lower than the $0.20 \pm 0.03$ in our2001 analysis of the partially complete 2dfgrs. this shift is largely due tothe signal from the newly-sampled regions of space, rather than the refinementsin the treatment of observational selection. this analysis therefore implies adensity significantly below the standard $\omega_{m} =0.3$: in combination withcmb data from wmap, we infer $\omega_{m} =0.231\pm 0.021$.

astro-ph;0505107	the afterglows, redshifts, and properties of swift gamma-ray bursts	we present optical, near-ir, and radio follow up of sixteen swift bursts,including our discovery of nine afterglows and a redshift determination forthree. these observations, supplemented by data from the literature, provide anafterglow recovery rate of 60% in the optical/near-ir, much higher than inprevious missions (bepposax, hete-2, integral, and ipn). the optical/near-irafterglows of swift events are on average 1.7 mag fainter at t=12 hr than thoseof previous missions. the x-ray afterglows are similarly fainter compared tothose of pre-swift bursts. in the radio the limiting factor is the vlathreshold and the detection rate for swift bursts is similar to that for pastmissions. the redshift distribution of pre-swift bursts peaked at z~1, whereasthe five swift bursts with measured redshifts are distributed evenly between1.3 and 3.2. from these results we conclude that (i) the pre-swiftdistributions were biased in favor of bright events and low redshift events,(ii) the higher sensitivity and accurate positions of swift result in a betterrepresentation of the true burst redshift and brightness distributions (whichare higher and dimmer, respectively), and (iii) as many as 1/3 of the burstscan be optically dark, as a result of a high redshift and/or dust extinction.we remark that the apparent lack of low redshift, low luminosity swift bursts,and the lower event rate compared to pre-launch estimates (90 vs. 150 peryear), are the result of a threshold that is similar to that of batse. in viewof these inferences, afterglow observers may find it advisable to makesignificant changes in follow up strategies of swift events.

astro-ph;0508115	the afterglow and elliptical host galaxy of the short gamma-ray burst  grb 050724	despite a rich phenomenology, gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are divided into twoclasses based on their duration and spectral hardness -- the long-soft and theshort-hard bursts. the discovery of afterglow emission from long grbs was awatershed event, pinpointing their origin to star forming galaxies, and hencethe death of massive stars, and indicating an energy release of about 10^51erg. while theoretical arguments suggest that short grbs are produced in thecoalescence of binary compact objects (neutron stars or black holes), theprogenitors, energetics, and environments of these events remain elusivedespite recent localizations. here we report the discovery of the first radioafterglow from a short burst, grb 050724, which unambiguously associates itwith an elliptical galaxy at a redshift, z=0.257. we show that the burst ispowered by the same relativistic fireball mechanism as long grbs, with theejecta possibly collimated in jets, but that the total energy release is10-1000 times smaller. more importantly, the nature of the host galaxydemonstrates that short grbs arise from an old (&gt;1 gyr) stellar population,strengthening earlier suggestions, and providing support for coalescing compactobject binaries as the progenitors.

astro-ph;0510566	swift and optical observations of grb 050401	we present the results of the analysis of gamma-ray and x-ray data of grb050401 taken with the swift satellite, together with a series of ground-basedfollow-up observations. the swift x-ray light curve shows a clear break atabout 4900 seconds after the grb. the decay indices before and after the breakare consistent with a scenario of continuous injection of radiation from the'central engine' of the grb to the fireball. alternatively, this behaviourcould result if ejecta are released with a range of lorentz factors with theslower shells catching up the faster at the afterglow shock position. the twoscenarios are observationally indistinguishable. the grb 050401 afterglow isquite bright in the x-ray band but weak in the optical, with an optical tox-ray flux ratio similar to those of 'dark bursts'. we detect a significantamount of absorption in the x-ray spectrum, with n_h = (1.7 +/- 0.2) x 10^22cm^-2 at a redshift of z=2.9, which is typical of a dense circumbust medium.such high column density implies an unrealistic optical extinction of 30magnitudes if we adopt the galactic extinction law, which would not consistentwith optical detection of the afterglow. this suggests that the extinction lawis different from the galactic one.

astro-ph;0511697	reverberation measurements of the inner radius of the dust torus in  nearby seyfert 1 galaxies	the most intense monitoring observations yet made in the optical (ubv) andnear-infrared (jhk) wave bands were carried out for nearby seyfert1 galaxies ofngc 5548, ngc 4051, ngc 3227, and ngc 7469. over three years of observationswith magnum telescope since early 2001, clear time-delayed response of thek-band flux variations to the v-band flux variations was detected for all ofthese galaxies. their h-k color temperature was estimated to be 1500-1800 kfrom the observed flux variation gradients, which supports a view that the bulkof the k flux should originate in the thermal radiation of hot dust thatsurrounds the central engine. cross-correlation analysis was performed toquantify the lag time corresponding to the light-travel distance of the hotdust region from the central engine. the measured lag time is 47-53 days forngc 5548, 11-18 days for ngc 4051, about 20 days for ngc 3227, and 65-87 daysfor ngc 7469. we found that the lag time is tightly correlated with the opticalluminosity as expected from dust reverberation ($\delta t \propto l^{0.5}$),while only weakly with the central virial mass, which suggests that an innerradius of the dust torus around the active nucleus has a one-to-onecorrespondence to central luminosity. in the lag time versus central luminositydiagram, the k-band lag times place an upper boundary on the similar lag timesof broad-emission lines in the literature. this not only supports the unifiedscheme of agns, but also implies a physical transition from the blr out to thedust torus that encircles the blr. furthermore, our v-band flux variations ofngc 5548 on timescales of up to 10 days are found to correlate with x-rayvariations and delay behind them by one or two days, indicating the thermalreprocessing of x-ray emission by the central accretion flow.

astro-ph;0603689	hst and spitzer observations of the host galaxy of grb 050904: a  metal-enriched, dusty starburst at z=6.295	we present deep hubble space telescope and spitzer space telescopeobservations of the host galaxy of grb 050904 at z=6.295. the host is detectedin the h-band and marginally at 3.6 micron. from these detections, and limitsin the z'-band and 4.5 micron, we infer an extinction-corrected absolutemagnitude, m(uv)=-20.7 mag, or ~l*, a substantial star formation rate of 15solar masses per year, and a stellar mass of a few 10^9 solar masses. acomparison to the published sample of spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies atz&gt;5.5 reveals that the host of grb 050904 would evade detection and/orconfirmation in any of the current surveys due to the lack of detectablely-alpha emission, which is likely the result of dust extinction (a[1200]~1.5mag). this suggests that not all luminous starburst galaxies at z~6 arecurrently being accounted for. most importantly, using the metallicity ofz~0.05 solar inferred from the afterglow absorption spectrum, our observationsindicate for the first time that the observed evolution in the mass- andluminosity-metallicity relations from z=0 to z~2 continues on to z&gt;6. the easeof measuring redshifts and metallicities from the afterglow emission suggeststhat in tandem with the next generation ground- and space-based telescopes, agrb mission with dedicated near-ir follow-up can provide unique information onthe evolution of stars and galaxies through the epoch of re-ionization.

astro-ph;0604093	physics of the grb 030328 afterglow and its environment	we report on the photometric, spectroscopic and polarimetric, monitoring ofthe optical afterglow of gamma-ray burst (grb) 030328 detected by hete-2.photometry, collected at 7 different telescopes, shows that a smoothly brokenpowerlaw decay, with indices alpha_1 = 0.76 +/- 0.03, alpha_2 = 1.50 +/- 0.07and a break at t_b = 0.48 +/- 0.03 days after the grb, provides the best fit ofthe optical afterglow decline. this shape is interpreted as due to collimatedemission, for which we determine a jet opening angle theta_{jet} of about 3.2degrees. an achromatic bump starting around 0.2 d after the grb is possiblymarginally detected in the optical light curves. optical spectroscopy shows thepresence of two rest-frame ultraviolet metal absorption systems at z = 1.5216+/- 0.0006 and at z = 1.295 +/- 0.001, the former likely associated with thegrb host galaxy. analysis of the absorption lines at z = 1.5216 suggests thatthe host of this grb may be a damped lyman-alpha absorber. the optical v-bandafterglow appears polarized, with p= (2.4 +/- 0.6) % and theta = (170 +/- 7)degrees, suggesting an asymmetric blastwave expansion. an x-ray-to-opticalspectral flux distribution of the grb 030328 afterglow was obtained at 0.78days after the grb and fitted using a broken powerlaw, with an optical spectralslope beta_{opt} = 0.47 +/- 0.15, and an x-ray slope beta_{x} = 1.0 +/- 0.2.the discussion of these results in the context of the "fireball model" showsthat the preferred scenario for this afterglow is collimated structured jetwith fixed opening angle in a homogeneous medium.

astro-ph;0611128	a new population of high redshift short-duration gamma-ray bursts	the redshift distribution of the short-duration grbs is a crucial, butcurrently fragmentary, clue to the nature of their progenitors. here we presentoptical observations of nine short grbs obtained with gemini, magellan, and thehubble space telescope. we detect the afterglows and host galaxies of two shortbursts, and host galaxies for two additional bursts with known opticalafterglow positions, and five with x-ray positions (&lt;6'' radius). in eight ofthe nine cases we find that the most probable host galaxies are faint,r~23-26.5 mag, and are therefore starkly different from the first few short grbhosts with r~17-22 mag and z&lt;0.5. indeed, we measure spectroscopic redshifts ofz~0.4-1.1 for the four brightest hosts. a comparison to large field galaxysamples, as well as the hosts of long grbs and previous short grbs, indicatesthat the fainter hosts likely reside at z&gt;1. our most conservative limit isthat at least half of the five hosts without a known redshift reside at z&gt;0.7(97% confidence level), suggesting that about 1/3-2/3 of all short grbsoriginate at higher redshifts than previously determined. this has twoimportant implications: (i) we constrain the acceptable age distributions to awide lognormal (sigma&gt;1) with tau~4-8 gyr, or to a power law, p(tau)~tau^n,with -1&lt;n&lt;0; and (ii) the inferred isotropic energies,e_{gamma,iso}~10^50-10^52 erg, are significantly larger than ~10^48-10^49 ergfor the low redshift short grbs, indicating a large spread in energy release orjet opening angles. finally, we re-iterate the importance of short grbs aspotential gravitational wave sources and find a conservative advanced ligodetection rate of ~2-6 yr^-1.

astro-ph;9309052	possible gravitational microlensing of a star in the large magellanic  cloud	there is now abundant evidence for the presence of large quantities of unseenmatter surrounding normal galaxies, including our own$^{1,2}$. the nature ofthis `dark matter' is unknown, except that it cannot be made of normal stars,dust, or gas, as they would be easily detected. exotic particles such asaxions, massive neutrinos or other weakly interacting massive particles(collectively known as wimps) have been proposed)$^{3,4}$, but have yet to bedetected. a less exotic alternative is normal matter in the form of bodies withmasses ranging from that of a large planet to a few $ \msun$. such objects,known collectively as massive compact halo objects$^5$ (machos) might be browndwarfs or `jupiters' (bodies too small to produce their own energy by fusion),neutron stars, old white dwarfs, or black holes. paczynski$^6$ suggested thatmachos might act as gravitational microlenses, occasionally causing theapparent brightness of distant background stars temporarily to increase. we areconducting a microlensing experiment to determine whether the dark matter haloof our galaxy is made up of machos. here we report a candidate for amicrolensing event, detected by monitoring the light curves of 1.8 millionstars in the large magellanic cloud for one year. the light curve shows novariation for most of the year of data taking, and an upward excursion lastingover 1 month, with a maximum increase of $\approx \bf 2$ mag. the most probablelens mass, inferred from the duration of the event, is $\bf \sim 0.1 \,\msun$.

astro-ph;9411019	theory of exploring the dark halo with microlensing 1: power--law models	the detection of microlensing has opened the way for the development of newmethods in galactic astronomy. this series of papers investigates whatmicrolensing can teach us about the structure and shape of the dark halo. inthis paper we present formulas for the microlensing rate, optical depth andevent duration distributions for a simple set of axisymmetric disk-halo models.the halos are based on the "power--law models" which have simple velocitydistributions. using these models, we show that there is a large uncertainty inthe predicted microlensing rate because of uncertainty in the halo parameters.for example, models which reproduce the measured galactic observables to withintheir errors still differ in microlensing rate towards the magellanic clouds bymore than a factor of ten. we find that while the more easily computed opticaldepth correlates well with microlensing rate, the ratio of optical depth torate can vary by a factor of two (or greater if the disk is maximal).comparison of microlensing rates towards the large and small magellanic clouds(lmc and smc) and m31 can be used to aid determinations of the halo flatteningand rotation curve slope. for example, the ratio of microlensing rates towardsthe lmc and smc is $\sim 0.7-0.8$ for e0 halos and $\sim 1.0 - 1.2$ for e7halos (c.f. sackett \&amp; gould 1993). once the flattening has been established,the ratio of microlensing rates towards m31 and the lmc may help to distinguishbetween models with rising, flat or falling rotation curves. comparison ofrates along lmc and galactic bulge lines-of-sight gives useful information onthe halo core radius, although this may not be so easy to extract in practice.maximal disk models provide substantially smaller halo optical depths, shorterevent durations and even larger model uncertainties.

astro-ph;9505099	the stromlo-apm redshift survey iii. redshift space distortions, omega  and bias	galaxy redshift surveys provide a distorted picture of the universe due tothe non-hubble component of galaxy motions. by measuring such distortions inthe linear regime one can constrain the quantity $\beta = \omega^{0.6}/b$ where$\omega$ is the cosmological density parameter and $b$ is the (linear) biasfactor for optically-selected galaxies. in this paper we apply two techniquesfor estimating $\beta$ from the stromlo-apm redshift survey --- (1) measuringthe anisotropy of the redshift space correlation function in sphericalharmonics and (2) comparing the amplitude of the direction-averaged redshiftspace correlation function to the real space correlation function. we test thevalidity of these techniques, particularly whether the assumption of lineartheory is justified, using two sets of large $n$-body simulations. we find thatthe first technique is affected by non-linearities on scales up to $\sim 30\hmpc$. the second technique is less sensitive to non-linear effects and so ismore useful for existing redshift surveys. the stromlo-apm survey data favoursa low value for $\beta$, with $\beta \simlt 0.6$. a bias parameter $b \approx2$ is thus required if $\omega \equiv 1$. however, higher-order correlationsmeasured from the apm galaxy survey (gazta\~{n}aga and frieman 1994) indicate alow value for the bias parameter $b \approx 1$, requiring that $\omega \simlt0.5$. we also measure the relative bias for samples of galaxies of variousluminosity and morphological type and find that low-luminosity galaxies areroughly three times less biased than $l^*$ galaxies. for the galaxy populationas a whole, we measure a real space variance of galaxy counts in $8 \hmpc$spheres of $(\sigma^2_8)_g = 0.89 \pm 0.05$.

astro-ph;9604177	the macho project lmc variable star inventory: iii. new r coronae  borealis stars	we report the discovery of two new r coronae borealis (rcb) stars in thelarge magellanic cloud (lmc) using the macho project photometry database. theidentification of both stars has been confirmed spectroscopically. one is acool rcb star (t_eff about 5000 k) characterized by very strong swan bands ofc_2 and violet bands of cn, and weak or absent balmer lines, g-band and 12c-13cbands. the second star is an example of a hot rcb star of which only 3 werepreviously known to exist in the galaxy and none in the lmc. its spectrum ischaracterized by several c ii lines in emission. both stars have shown deepdeclines of delta v &gt; 4 mag in brightness. the new stars are significantlyfainter at maximum light than the three previously known lmc rcb stars. theamount of reddening toward these stars is somewhat uncertain but both seem tohave absolute magnitudes, m_v, about half a magnitude fainter than the otherthree stars. estimates of m_bol find that the hot rcb star lies in the range ofthe other three stars while the cool rcb star is fainter. the two cool lmc rcbstars are the faintest at m_bol. the discovery of these two new stars brings tofive the number of known rcb stars in the lmc and demonstrates the utility ofthe macho photometric database for the discovery of new rcb stars.

astro-ph;9606012	a binary lensing event toward the lmc: observations and dark matter  implications	the macho collaboration has recently analyzed 2.1 years of photometric datafor about 8.5 million stars in the large magellanic cloud (lmc). this analysishas revealed 8 candidate microlensing events and a total microlensing opticaldepth of $\tau_{meas} = 2.9 +1.4/-0.9 \times 10^{-7}$. this significantlyexceeds the number of events (1.1) and the microlensing optical depth predictedfrom known stellar populations: $\tau_{back} = 5.4\times 10^{-8}$, but it isconsistent with models in which about half of the standard dark halo mass iscomposed of machos of mass $\sim 0.5 \msun$. one of these 8 events appears tobe a binary lensing event with a caustic crossing that is partially resolvedwhich allows us to estimate the distance to the lenses. if the source star isnot a short period binary star, then we show that the lens system is verylikely to reside in the lmc. however, if we assume that the optical depth forlmc-lmc lensing is large enough to account for our entire lensing signal, thenthe binary event does not appear to be consistent with lensing of a single lmcsource star by a binary residing in the lmc. thus, while the binary lens mayindeed reside in the lmc, there is no indication that most of the lenses residein the lmc.

astro-ph;9606134	the macho project 2nd year lmc microlensing results and dark matter  implications	the macho project is searching for galactic dark matter in the form ofmassive compact halo objects (machos). millions of stars in the largemagellanic cloud (lmc), small magellanic cloud (smc), and galactic bulge arephotometrically monitored in an attempt to detect rare gravitationalmicrolensing events caused by otherwise invisible machos. analysis of two yearsof photometry on 8.5 million stars in the lmc reveals 8 candidate microlensingevents, far more than the $\sim1$ event expected from lensing by low-mass starsin known galactic populations. from these eight events we estimate the opticaldepth towards the lmc from events with $2 &lt; \that &lt; 200$ days to be$\tau_2^{200} \approx 2.9 ^{+1.4}_{-0.9} \ten{-7}$. this exceeds the opticaldepth of $0.5\ten{-7}$ expected from known stars and is to be compared with anoptical depth of $4.7\ten{-7}$ predicted for a ``standard'' halo composedentirely of machos. the total mass in this lensing population is $\approx2^{+1.2}_{-0.7} \ten{11} \msun$ (within 50 kpc from the galactic center). eventtimescales yield a most probable macho mass of $0.5^{+0.3}_{-0.2}\msun$,although this value is quite model dependent.

astro-ph;9606165	the macho project lmc microlensing results from the first two years and  the nature of the galactic dark halo	the macho project is a search for dark matter in the form of massive compacthalo objects (machos). photometric monitoring of millions of stars in the largemagellanic cloud (lmc), small magellanic cloud (smc), and galactic bulge isused to search for gravitational microlensing events caused by these otherwiseinvisible objects. analysis of the first 2.1 years of photometry of 8.5 millionstars in the lmc reveals 8 candidate microlensing events. this is substantiallymore than the number expected ($\sim 1.1$) from lensing by known stellarpopulations. the timescales ($\that$) of the events range from 34 to 145 days.we estimate the total microlensing optical depth towards the lmc from eventswith $2 &lt; \that &lt; 200$ days to be $\tau_2^{200} = 2.9 ^{+1.4}_{-0.9} \ten{-7}$based upon our 8 event sample. this exceeds the optical depth, $\tau_{\rmbackgnd} = 0.5 \ten{-7}$, expected from known stars, and the difference is tobe compared with the optical depth predicted for a ``standard" halo composedentirely of machos: $\tau_{halo} = 4.7\ten{-7}$. likelihood analysis gives afairly model independent estimate of the halo mass in machos within 50 kpc of$2.0^{+1.2}_{-0.7} \ten{11} \msun$, about half of the ``standard halo" value.we also find a most probable macho mass of $0.5^{+0.3}_{-0.2}\msun$, althoughthis value is strongly model dependent. additionally, the absence of shortduration events places stringent upper limits on the contribution of low-massmachos: objects from $10^{-4} \msun$ to $0.03 \msun$ contribute $\simlt 20\%$of the ``standard" dark halo.

astro-ph;9608036	the macho project lmc variable star inventory iv: multimode rr lyrae  stars, distance to the lmc and age of the oldest stars	we report the discovery of 73 double-mode rr lyrae (rrd) stars in fields nearthe bar of the lmc. the stars are detected among the macho database ofshort-period variables that currently contains about 7900 rr lyrae stars.fundamental periods (p_0) for these stars are found in the range 0.46-0.55 daysand first overtone-to-fundamental period ratios are found to be in the range0.742 &lt; p_1/p_0 &lt; 0.748. a significant fraction of our current sample haveperiod ratios smaller than any previously discovered rrd variables. we presentmean magnitudes, colors, and lightcurve properties for all lmc rrd starsdetected to date. the range in period ratios is unexpectedly large.  we present a determination of absolute magnitudes for these stars basedprimarily on pulsation theory and the assumption that all observed stars are atthe fundamental blue edge (fbe) of the instability strip. comparison of thecalibrated macho v and r_kc photometry with these derived absolute magnitudesyields an absorption-corrected distance modulus to the lmc of 18.57 +/- 0.19mag which is in good agreement with that found (18.5) through comparison ofgalactic and lmc cepheids.  adopting this luminosity calibration, we derive an increase in the distancemodulus, and thus a reduction in the age found via isochrone fitting for m15 ofabout 33% and discuss the implications for cosmology.

(1995).  the optical and near infrared magnitudes of all objects detected in the v+i+kimage are discussed in the context of grids of isochrone synthesis galaxyevolutionary models (bruzual &amp; charlot 1993, 1995). the colors of most of theobserved galaxies are consistent with a population drawn from a broad redshiftdistribution. a few galaxies at k=19-20 are red in both colors (v-i&gt;3; i-k&gt;2),consistent with being early-type galaxies having undergone a burst of starformation at z&gt;5 and viewed at z~1. at k&gt;20, we find ~8 ``red outlier''galaxies with i-k&gt;4 and v-i&lt;2.5, whose colors are difficult to mimic by asingle evolving or non-evolving stellar population at any redshift. they arelikely either low-metallicity, dusty dwarf galaxies, or old galaxies at highredshift (z&gt;1.2). their surface density is several per square arcminute, whichis so high that they are probably common objects of low luminosity $l&lt;l_*$.

astro-ph;9702199	macho alert 95-30 : first real-time observation of extended source  effects in gravitational microlensing	we present analysis of macho alert 95-30, a dramatic gravitationalmicrolensing event towards the galactic bulge whose peak magnification departssignificantly from the standard point-source microlensing model. alert 95-30was observed in real-time by the global microlensing alert network (gman),which obtained densely sampled photometric and spectroscopic data throughoutthe event. we interpret the light-curve ``fine structure'' as indicatingtransit of the lens across the extended face of the source star. this signifiesresolution of a star several kpc distant. we find a lens angular impactparameter theta_{min}/theta_{source} = 0.715 +/- 0.003. this information, alongwith the radius and distance of the source, provides an additional constrainton the lensing system. spectroscopic and photometric data indicate the sourceis an m4 iii star of radius 61 +/- 12 rsun, located on the far side of thebulge at 9 kpc. we derive a lens angular velocity, relative to the source, of21.5 +/- 4.9 km/s/kpc, where the error is dominated by uncertainty in thesource radius. likelihood analysis yields a median lens mass of0.67{+2.53}{-0.46} msun, located with 80% probability in the galactic bulge ata distance of 6.93{+1.56}{-2.25} kpc. if the lens is a main-sequence star, wecan include constraints on the lens luminosity. this modifies our estimates tom_lens = 0.53{+0.52}{-0.35} msun and d_lens = 6.57{+0.99}{-2.25} kpc. spectrataken during the event show that the absorption line equivalent widths of halpha and the tio bands near 6700 a vary, as predicted for microlensing of anextended source. this is most likely due to center-to-limb variation in thestellar spectral lines. these data demonstrate the feasibility of usingmicrolensing limb crossings as a tool to probe stellar atmospheres directly.

astro-ph;9806175	discovery of the peculiar supernova 1998bw in the error box of grb980425	the discovery of x-ray, optical and radio afterglows of gamma-ray bursts(grbs) and the measurements of the distances to some of them have establishedthat these events come from gpc distances and are the most powerful photonemitters known in the universe, with peak luminosities up to 10^52 erg/s. wehere report the discovery of an optical transient, in the bepposax wide fieldcamera error box of grb980425, which occurred within about a day of thegamma-ray burst. its optical light curve, spectrum and location in a spiral armof the galaxy eso 184-g82, at a redshift z = 0.0085, show that the transient isa very luminous type ic supernova, sn1998bw. the peculiar nature of sn1998bw isemphasized by its extraordinary radio properties which require that the radioemitter expand at relativistical speed. since sn1998bw is very different fromall previously observed afterglows of grbs, our discovery raises thepossibility that very different mechanisms may give rise to grbs, which differlittle in their gamma-ray properties.

astro-ph;9807163	discovery and characterization of a caustic crossing microlensing event  in the smc	we present photometric observations and analysis of the second microlensingevent detected towards the small magellanic cloud (smc), macho alert 98-smc-1.this event was detected early enough to allow intensive observation of thelightcurve. these observations revealed 98-smc-1 to be the first causticcrossing, binary microlensing event towards the magellanic clouds to bediscovered in progress.  frequent coverage of the evolving lightcurve allowed an accurate predictionfor the date of the source crossing out of the lens caustic structure. thecaustic crossing temporal width, along with the angular size of the sourcestar, measures the proper motion of the lens with respect to the source, andthus allows an estimate of the location of the lens. lenses located in thegalactic halo would have a velocity projected to the smc of v^hat ~1500 km/s,while an smc lens would typically have v^hat ~60 km/s.  we have performed a joint fit to the macho/gman data presented here,including recent eros data of this event. these joint data are sufficient toconstrain the time for the lens to move an angle equal to the source angularradius; 0.116 +/- 0.010 days. we estimate a radius for the lensed source of 1.4+/- 0.1 r_sun. this yields a projected velocity of v^hat = 84 +/- 9 km/s. only0.15% of halo lenses would be expected to have a v^hat value at least as smallas this, while 31% of smc lenses would be expected to have v^hat as large asthis. this implies that the lensing system is more likely to reside in the smcthan in the galactic halo.

(1995) discovered many sources with unusuallyred optical continua among the quasars of this sample and interpreted thisresult in terms of extinction by dust. although the x-ray spectra in general donot show excess absorption, we find that low-redshift optically red quasarshave significantly lower soft x-ray luminosities on average than objects withblue optical continua. the difference disappears for higher redshifts, as isexpected for intrinsic absorption by cold gas associated with the dust.alternative explanations are briefly discussed. we conclude, however, that dustdoes play an important role in some of the radio-loud quasars with red opticalcontinua.

astro-ph;9905151	on planetary companions to the macho-98-blg-35 microlens star	we present observations of microlensing event macho-98-blg-35 which reached apeak magnification factor of almost 80. these observations by the microlensingplanet search (mps) and the moa collaborations place strong constraints on thepossible planetary system of the lens star and show intriguing evidence for alow mass planet with a mass fraction $4\times 10^{-5} \leq \epsilon \leq2\times 10^{-4}$. a giant planet with $\epsilon = 10^{-3}$ is excluded from 95%of the region between 0.4 and 2.5 $r_e$ from the lens star, where $r_e$ is theeinstein ring radius of the lens. this exclusion region is more extensive thanthe generic "lensing zone" which is $0.6 - 1.6 r_e$. for smaller mass planets,we can exclude 57% of the "lensing zone" for $\epsilon = 10^{-4}$ and 14% ofthe lensing zone for $\epsilon = 10^{-5}$. the mass fraction $\epsilon =10^{-5}$ corresponds to an earth mass planet for a lensing star of mass $\sim0.3 \msun$. a number of similar events will provide statistically significantconstraints on the prevalence of earth mass planets. in order to put our limitsin more familiar terms, we have compared our results to those expected for asolar system clone averaging over possible lens system distances andorientations. we find that such a system is ruled out at the 90% confidencelevel. a copy of the solar system with jupiter replaced by a second saturn massplanet can be ruled out at 70% confidence. our low mass planetary signal (fewearth masses to neptune mass) is significant at the $4.5\sigma$ confidencelevel. if this planetary interpretation is correct, the macho-98-blg-35 lenssystem constitutes the first detection of a low mass planet orbiting anordinary star without gas giant planets.
