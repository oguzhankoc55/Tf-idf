0912.0201	lsst science book, version 2.0	a survey that can cover the sky in optical bands over wide fields to faintmagnitudes with a fast cadence will enable many of the exciting scienceopportunities of the next decade. the large synoptic survey telescope (lsst)will have an effective aperture of 6.7 meters and an imaging camera with fieldof view of 9.6 deg^2, and will be devoted to a ten-year imaging survey over20,000 deg^2 south of +15 deg. each pointing will be imaged 2000 times withfifteen second exposures in six broad bands from 0.35 to 1.1 microns, to atotal point-source depth of r~27.5. the lsst science book describes the basicparameters of the lsst hardware, software, and observing plans. the bookdiscusses educational and outreach opportunities, then goes on to describe abroad range of science that lsst will revolutionize: mapping the inner andouter solar system, stellar populations in the milky way and nearby galaxies,the structure of the milky way disk and halo and other objects in the localvolume, transient and variable objects both at low and high redshift, and theproperties of normal and active galaxies at low and high redshift. it thenturns to far-field cosmological topics, exploring properties of supernovae toz~1, strong and weak lensing, the large-scale distribution of galaxies andbaryon oscillations, and how these different probes may be combined toconstrain cosmological models and the physics of dark energy.

0912.3253	a search for asteroids, moons, and rings orbiting white dwarfs	do white dwarfs host asteroid systems? although several lines of argumentsuggest that white dwarfs may be orbited by large populations of asteroids,transits would provide the most direct evidence. we demonstrate that the keplermission has the capability to detect transits of white dwarfs by asteroids.because white-dwarf asteroid systems, if they exist, are likely to contain manyasteroids orbiting in a spatially extended distribution, discoveries ofasteroid transits can be made by monitoring only a small number of whitedwarfs, compatible with kepler's primary mission, which is to monitor starswith potentially habitable planets. possible future missions that survey tentimes as many stars with similar sensitivity and minute-cadence monitoring canestablish the characteristics of asteroid systems around white dwarfs, such asthe distribution of asteroid sizes and semimajor axes. transits by planetswould be more dramatic, but the probability that they will occur is lower.ensembles of planetary moons and/or the presence of rings around planets canalso produce transits detectable by kepler. the presence of moons and rings cansignificantly increase the probability that kepler will discover planetsorbiting white dwarfs, even while monitoring only a small number of them.

1001.0416	discovery and rossiter-mclaughlin effect of exoplanet kepler-8b	we report the discovery and the rossiter-mclaughlin effect of kepler-8b, atransiting planet identified by the nasa kepler mission. kepler photometry andkeck-hires radial velocities yield the radius and mass of the planet aroundthis f8iv subgiant host star. the planet has a radius rp = 1.419 rj and a mass,mp = 0.60 mj, yielding a density of 0.26 g cm^-3, among the lowest densityplanets known. the orbital period is p = 3.523 days and orbital semima jor axisis 0.0483+0.0006/-0.0012 au. the star has a large rotational v sin i of 10.5+/- 0.7 km s^-1 and is relatively faint (v = 13.89 mag), both propertiesdeleterious to precise doppler measurements. the velocities are indeed noisy,with scatter of 30 m s^-1, but exhibit a period and phase consistent with theplanet implied by the photometry. we securely detect the rossiter-mclaughlineffect, confirming the planet's existence and establishing its orbit asprograde. we measure an inclination between the projected planetary orbitalaxis and the projected stellar rotation axis of lambda = -26.9 +/- 4.6 deg,indicating a moderate inclination of the planetary orbit. rossiter-mclaughlinmeasurements of a large sample of transiting planets from kepler will provide astatistically robust measure of the true distribution of spin-orbitorientations for hot jupiters in general.

1005.3890	modeling multi-wavelength stellar astrometry. i. sim lite observations  of interacting binaries	interacting binaries consist of a secondary star which fills or is very closeto filling its roche lobe, resulting in accretion onto the primary star, whichis often, but not always, a compact object. in many cases, the primary star,secondary star, and the accretion disk can all be significant sources ofluminosity. sim lite will only measure the photocenter of an astrometrictarget, and thus determining the true astrometric orbits of such systems willbe difficult. we have modified the eclipsing light curve code (orosz &amp;hauschildt 2000) to allow us to model the flux-weighted reflex motions ofinteracting binaries, in a code we call reflux. this code gives us sufficientflexibility to investigate nearly every configuration of interacting binary. wefind that sim lite will be able to determine astrometric orbits for allsufficiently bright interacting binaries where the primary or secondary stardominates the luminosity. for systems where there are multiple components thatcomprise the spectrum in the optical bandpass accessible to sim lite, we findit is possible to obtain absolute masses for both components, althoughmulti-wavelength photometry will be required to disentangle the multiplecomponents. in all cases, sim lite will at least yield accurate inclinations,and provide valuable information that will allow us to begin to understand thecomplex evolution of mass-transferring binaries. it is critical that sim litemaintains a multi-wavelength capability to allow for the proper deconvolutionof the astrometric orbits in multi-component systems.

1006.1796	quiescent superhumps detected in the dwarf nova v344 lyrae by kepler	the timing capabilities and sensitivity of kepler, nasa's observatory to findearth-sized planets within the habitable zone of stars, are well matched to thetimescales and amplitudes of accretion disk variability in cataclysmicvariables. this instrumental combination provides an unprecedented opportunityto test and refine stellar accretion paradigms with high-precision, uniformdata, containing none of the diurnal or season gaps that limit ground-basedobservations. we present a 3-month, 1 minute cadence kepler light curve of v344lyr, a faint, little-studied dwarf nova within the kepler field. the lightcurve samples v344 lyr during five full normal outbursts and one superoutburst.surprisingly, the superhumps found during superoutburst continue to be detectedduring the following quiescent state and normal outburst. the fractional excessof superhump period over the presumed orbital period suggests a relatively highbinary mass ratio in a system where the radius of the accretion disk must varyby less than 2% in order to maintain tidal precession throughout the extendedepisode of superhumping. disk radius is less restricted if the quiescent signalidentified tentatively as the orbital period is a negative superhump, generatedby a retrograde-precessing accretion disk, tilted with respect to the binaryorbital plane.

1006.2763	five kepler target stars that show multiple transiting exoplanet  candidates	we present and discuss five candidate exoplanetary systems identified withthe kepler spacecraft. these five systems show transits from multiple exoplanetcandidates. should these objects prove to be planetary in nature, then thesefive systems open new opportunities for the field of exoplanets and provide newinsights into the formation and dynamical evolution of planetary systems. wediscuss the methods used to identify multiple transiting objects from thekepler photometry as well as the false-positive rejection methods that havebeen applied to these data. one system shows transits from three distinctobjects while the remaining four systems show transits from two objects. threesystems have planet candidates that are near mean motioncommensurabilities---two near 2:1 and one just outside 5:2. we discuss theimplications that multitransiting systems have on the distribution of orbitalinclinations in planetary systems, and hence their dynamical histories; as wellas their likely masses and chemical compositions. a monte carlo study indicatesthat, with additional data, most of these systems should exhibit detectabletransit timing variations (ttv) due to gravitational interactions---though noneare apparent in these data. we also discuss new challenges that arise in ttvanalyses due to the presence of more than two planets in a system.

1008.4393	modeling kepler transit light curves as false positives: rejection of  blend scenarios for kepler-9, and validation of kepler-9d, a super-earth-size  planet in a multiple system	light curves from the kepler mission contain valuable information on thenature of the phenomena producing the transit-like signals. to assist inexploring the possibility that they are due to an astrophysical false positive,we describe a procedure (blender) to model the photometry in terms of a "blend"rather than a planet orbiting a star. a blend may consist of a background orforeground eclipsing binary (or star-planet pair) whose eclipses are attenuatedby the light of the candidate and possibly other stars within the photometricaperture. we apply blender to the case of kepler-9, a target harboring twopreviously confirmed saturn-size planets (kepler-9b and kepler-9c) showingtransit timing variations, and an additional shallower signal with a 1.59-dayperiod suggesting the presence of a super-earth-size planet. using blendertogether with constraints from other follow-up observations we are able to ruleout all blends for the two deeper signals, and provide independent validationof their planetary nature. for the shallower signal we rule out a largefraction of the false positives that might mimic the transits. the false alarmrate for remaining blends depends in part (and inversely) on the unknownfrequency of small-size planets. based on several realistic estimates of thisfrequency we conclude with very high confidence that this small signal is dueto a super-earth-size planet (kepler-9d) in a multiple system, rather than afalse positive. the radius is determined to be 1.64 (+0.19/-0.14) r(earth), andcurrent spectroscopic observations are as yet insufficient to establish itsmass.

1105.4647	kepler-10c, a 2.2-earth radius transiting planet in a multiple system	the kepler mission has recently announced the discovery of kepler-10 b, thesmallest exoplanet discovered to date and the first rocky planet found by thespacecraft. a second, 45-day period transit-like signal present in thephotometry from the first eight months of data could not be confirmed as beingcaused by a planet at the time of that announcement. here we apply thelight-curve modeling technique known as blender to explore the possibility thatthe signal might be due to an astrophysical false positive (blend). to aid inthis analysis we report the observation of two transits with the spitzer spacetelescope at 4.5 {\mu}m. when combined they yield a transit depth of 344 \pm 85ppm that is consistent with the depth in the kepler passband (376 \pm 9 ppm,ignoring limb darkening), which rules out blends with an eclipsing binary of asignificantly different color than the target. using these observations alongwith other constraints from high resolution imaging and spectroscopy we areable to exclude the vast majority of possible false positives. we assess thelikelihood of the remaining blends, and arrive conservatively at a false alarmrate of 1.6 \times 10-5 that is small enough to validate the candidate as aplanet (designated kepler-10 c) with a very high level of confidence. theradius of this object is measured to be rp = 2.227+0.052 -0.057 earth radii.kepler-10 c represents another example (with kepler-9 d and kepler-11 g) ofstatistical "validation" of a transiting exoplanet, as opposed to the usual"confirmation" that can take place when the doppler signal is detected ortransit timing variations are measured. it is anticipated that many of kepler'ssmaller candidates will receive a similar treatment since dynamicalconfirmation may be difficult or impractical with the sensitivity of currentinstrumentation.

1106.3570	the palomar transient factory orion project: eclipsing binaries and  young stellar objects	the palomar transient factory (ptf) orion project is an experiment within thebroader ptf survey, a systematic automated exploration of the sky for opticaltransients. taking advantage of the wide field of view available using the ptfcamera at the palomar 48" telescope, 40 nights were dedicated in december2009-january 2010 to perform continuous high-cadence differential photometry ona single field containing the young (7-10myr) 25 ori association. the primarymotivation for the project is to search for planets around young stars in thisregion. the unique data set also provides for much ancillary science. in thisfirst paper we describe the survey and data reduction pipeline, and presentinitial results from an inspection of the most clearly varying stars relatingto two of the ancillary science objectives: detection of eclipsing binaries andyoung stellar objects. we find 82 new eclipsing binary systems, 9 of which weare candidate 25 ori- or orion ob1a-association members. of these, 2 arepotential young w uma type systems. we report on the possible low-mass (m-dwarfprimary) eclipsing systems in the sample, which include 6 of the candidateyoung systems. 45 of the binary systems are close (mainly contact) systems; oneshows an orbital period among the shortest known for w uma binaries, at0.2156509 \pm 0.0000071d, with flat-bottomed primary eclipses, and a deriveddistance consistent with membership in the general orion association. one ofthe candidate young systems presents an unusual light curve, perhapsrepresenting a semi-detached binary system with an inflated low-mass primary ora star with a warped disk, and may represent an additional young orion member.finally, we identify 14 probable new classical t-tauri stars in our data, alongwith one previously known (cvso 35) and one previously reported as a candidateweak-line t-tauri star (sdss j052700.12+010136.8).

1109.1611	discovery and atmospheric characterization of giant planet kepler-12b:  an inflated radius outlier	we report the discovery of planet kepler-12b (koi-20), which at 1.695\pm0.030rj is among the handful of planets with super-inflated radii above 1.65 rj.orbiting its slightly evolved g0 host with a 4.438-day period, this0.431\pm0.041 mj planet is the least-irradiated within thislargest-planet-radius group, which has important implications for planetaryphysics. the planet's inflated radius and low mass lead to a very low densityof 0.111\pm0.010 g cm-3. we detect the occultation of the planet at asignificance of 3.7{\sigma} in the kepler bandpass. this yields a geometricalbedo of 0.14\pm0.04; the planetary flux is due to a combination of scatteredlight and emitted thermal flux. we use multiple observations with warm spitzerto detect the occultation at 7{\sigma} and 4{\sigma} in the 3.6 and 4.5 {\mu}mbandpasses, respectively. the occultation photometry timing is consistent witha circular orbit, at e &lt; 0.01 (1{\sigma}), and e &lt; 0.09 (3{\sigma}). theoccultation detections across the three bands favor an atmospheric model withno dayside temperature inversion. the kepler occultation detection providessignificant leverage, but conclusions regarding temperature structure arepreliminary, given our ignorance of opacity sources at optical wavelengths inhot jupiter atmospheres. if kepler-12b and hd 209458b, which intercept similarincident stellar fluxes, have the same heavy element masses, the interiorenergy source needed to explain the large radius of kepler-12b is three timeslarger than that of hd 209458b. this may suggest that more than oneradius-inflation mechanism is at work for kepler-12b, or that it is lessheavy-element rich than other transiting planets.

1112.1640	kepler-22b: a 2.4 earth-radius planet in the habitable zone of a  sun-like star	a search of the time-series photometry from nasa's kepler spacecraft revealsa transiting planet candidate orbiting the 11th magnitude g5 dwarf kic 10593626with a period of 290 days. the characteristics of the host star are wellconstrained by high-resolution spectroscopy combined with an asteroseismicanalysis of the kepler photometry, leading to an estimated mass and radius of0.970 +/- 0.060 msun and 0.979 +/- 0.020 rsun. the depth of 492 +/- 10ppm forthe three observed transits yields a radius of 2.38 +/- 0.13 rearth for theplanet. the system passes a battery of tests for false positives, includingreconnaissance spectroscopy, high-resolution imaging, and centroid motion. afull blender analysis provides further validation of the planet interpretationby showing that contamination of the target by an eclipsing system would rarelymimic the observed shape of the transits. the final validation of the planet isprovided by 16 radial velocities obtained with hires on keck 1 over a one yearspan. although the velocities do not lead to a reliable orbit and massdetermination, they are able to constrain the mass to a 3{\sigma} upper limitof 124 mearth, safely in the regime of planetary masses, thus earning thedesignation kepler-22b. the radiative equilibrium temperature is 262k for aplanet in kepler-22b's orbit. although there is no evidence that kepler-22b isa rocky planet, it is the first confirmed planet with a measured radius toorbit in the habitable zone of any star other than the sun.

1112.4506	the kepler light curves of v1504 cygni and v344 lyrae: a study of the  outburst properties	we examine the kepler light curves of v1504 cyg and v344 lyr, encompassing~736 d at 1 min cadence. during this span each system exhibited ~64-65outbursts, including six superoutbursts. we find that, in both systems, thenormal outbursts between two superoutbursts increase in duration over time by afactor ~1.2-1.9, and then reset to a small value after the followingsuperoutburst. in both systems the trend of quiescent intervals between normaloutbursts is to increase to a local maximum about half way through thesupercycle - the interval from one superoutburst to the next - and then todecrease back to a small value by the time of the next superoutburst. this isinconsistent with osaki's thermal-tidal model, which predicts a monotonicincrease in the quiescent intervals between normal outbursts during asupercycle. also, most of the normal outbursts have an asymmetric,fast-rise/slower-decline shape, consistent with outbursts triggered at largeradii. the exponential rate of decay of the plateau phase of the superoutburstsis 8 d/mag for v1504 cyg and 12 d/mag for v344 lyr. this time scale gives adirect measure of the viscous time scale in the outer accretion disk given theexpectation that the entire disk is in the hot, viscous state duringsuperoutburst. the resulting constraint on the shakura-sunyaev parameter,alpha_{hot} ~ 0.1, is consistent with the value inferred from the fast dwarfnova decays. by looking at the slow decay rate for superoutbursts, which occurin systems below the period gap, in combination with the slow decay rate in onelong outburst above the period gap (in u gem), we infer a steep dependence ofthe decay rate on orbital period for long outbursts. this implies a steepdependence of alpha_{cold} on orbital period, consistent with tidal torquing asbeing the dominant angular momentum transport mechanism in quiescent disks ininteracting binary systems.

1112.4550	two earth-sized planets orbiting kepler-20	since the discovery of the first extrasolar giant planets around sun-likestars, evolving observational capabilities have brought us closer to thedetection of true earth analogues. the size of an exoplanet can be determinedwhen it periodically passes in front of (transits) its parent star, causing adecrease in starlight proportional to its radius. the smallest exoplanethitherto discovered has a radius 1.42 times that of the earth's radius (rearth), and hence has 2.9 times its volume. here we report the discovery of twoplanets, one earth-sized (1.03r earth) and the other smaller than the earth(0.87r earth), orbiting the star kepler-20, which is already known to hostthree other, larger, transiting planets. the gravitational pull of the newplanets on the parent star is too small to measure with currentinstrumentation. we apply a statistical method to show that the likelihood ofthe planetary interpretation of the transit signals is more than three ordersof magnitude larger than that of the alternative hypothesis that the signalsresult from an eclipsing binary star. theoretical considerations imply thatthese planets are rocky, with a composition of iron and silicate. the outerplanet could have developed a thick water vapour atmosphere.

1201.5409	transit timing observations from kepler: ii. confirmation of two  multiplanet systems via a non-parametric correlation analysis	we present a new method for confirming transiting planets based on thecombination of transit timingn variations (ttvs) and dynamical stability.correlated ttvs provide evidence that the pair of bodies are in the samephysical system. orbital stability provides upper limits for the masses of thetransiting companions that are in the planetary regime. this paper describes anon-parametric technique for quantifying the statistical significance of ttvsbased on the correlation of two ttv data sets. we apply this method to ananalysis of the transit timing variations of two stars with multiple transitingplanet candidates identified by kepler. we confirm four transiting planets intwo multiple planet systems based on their ttvs and the constraints imposed bydynamical stability. an additional three candidates in these same systems arenot confirmed as planets, but are likely to be validated as real planets oncefurther observations and analyses are possible. if all were confirmed, thesesystems would be near 4:6:9 and 2:4:6:9 period commensurabilities. our resultsdemonstrate that ttvs provide a powerful tool for confirming transitingplanets, including low-mass planets and planets around faint stars for whichdoppler follow-up is not practical with existing facilities. continued keplerobservations will dramatically improve the constraints on the planet masses andorbits and provide sensitivity for detecting additional non-transiting planets.if kepler observations were extended to eight years, then a similar analysiscould likely confirm systems with multiple closely spaced, small transitingplanets in or near the habitable zone of solar-type stars.

1201.5424	almost all of kepler's multiple planet candidates are planets	we present a statistical analysis that demonstrates that the overwhelmingmajority of kepler candidate multiple transiting systems (multis) indeedrepresent true, physically-associated transiting planets. binary stars providethe primary source of false positives among kepler planet candidates, implyingthat false positives should be nearly randomly-distributed among keplertargets. in contrast, true transiting planets would appear clustered around asmaller number of kepler targets if detectable planets tend to come in systemsand/or if the orbital planes of planets encircling the same star arecorrelated. there are more than one hundred times as many kepler planetcandidates in multi-candidate systems as would be predicted from a randomdistribution of candidates, implying that the vast majority are true planets.most of these multis are multiple planet systems orbiting the kepler targetstar, but there are likely cases where (a) the planetary system orbits afainter star, and the planets are thus significantly larger than has beenestimated, or (b) the planets orbit different stars within a binary/multiplestar system. we use the low overall false positive rate among kepler multis,together with analysis of kepler spacecraft and ground-based data, to validatethe closely-packed kepler-33 planetary system, which orbits a star that hasevolved somewhat off of the main sequence. kepler-33 hosts five transitingplanets with periods ranging from 5.67 to 41 days.

1204.3955	the transiting circumbinary planets kepler-34 and kepler-35	most sun-like stars in the galaxy reside in gravitationally-bound pairs ofstars called "binary stars". while long anticipated, the existence of a"circumbinary planet" orbiting such a pair of normal stars was not definitivelyestablished until the discovery of kepler-16. incontrovertible evidence wasprovided by the miniature eclipses ("transits") of the stars by the planet.however, questions remain about the prevalence of circumbinary planets andtheir range of orbital and physical properties. here we present two additionaltransiting circumbinary planets, kepler-34 and kepler-35. each is a low-densitygas giant planet on an orbit closely aligned with that of its parent stars.kepler-34 orbits two sun-like stars every 289 days, while kepler-35 orbits apair of smaller stars (89% and 81% of the sun's mass) every 131 days. due tothe orbital motion of the stars, the planets experience large multi-periodicvariations in incident stellar radiation. the observed rate of circumbinaryplanets implies &gt; ~1% of close binary stars have giant planets in nearlycoplanar orbits, yielding a galactic population of at least several million.

1207.1224	kepler observations of v447 lyr: an eclipsing u gem cataclysmic variable	we present the results of an analysis of data covering 1.5 years of the dwarfnova v447 lyr. we detect eclipses of the accretion disk by the mass donatingsecondary star every 3.74 hrs which is the binary orbital period. v447 lyr istherefore the first dwarf nova in the kepler field to show eclipses. we alsodetect five long outbursts and six short outbursts showing v447 lyr is a u gemtype dwarf nova. we show that the orbital phase of the mid-eclipse occursearlier during outbursts compared to quiescence and that the width of theeclipse is greater during outburst. this suggests that the bright spot is moreprominent during quiescence and that the disk is larger during outburst thanquiescence. this is consistent with an expansion of the outer disk radius dueto the presence of high viscosity material associated with the outburst,followed by a contraction in quiescence due to the accretion of low angularmomentum material. we note that the long outbursts appear to be triggered by ashort outburst, which is also observed in the super-outbursts of su uma dwarfnovae as observed using kepler.

1207.3093	demystifying kepler data: a primer for systematic artifact mitigation	the kepler spacecraft has collected data of high photometric precision andcadence almost continuously since operations began on 2009 may 2. primarilydesigned to detect planetary transits and asteroseismological signals fromsolar-like stars, kepler has provided high quality data for many areas ofinvestigation. unconditioned simple aperture time-series photometry are howeveraffected by systematic structure. examples of these systematics aredifferential velocity aberration, thermal gradients across the spacecraft, andpointing variations. while exhibiting some impact on kepler's primary science,these systematics can critically handicap potentially ground-breakingscientific gains in other astrophysical areas, especially over long timescalesgreater than 10 days. as the data archive grows to provide light curves for$10^5$ stars of many years in length, kepler will only fulfill its broadpotential for stellar astrophysics if these systematics are understood andmitigated. post-launch developments in the kepler archive, data reductionpipeline and open source data analysis software have occurred to remove orreduce systematic artifacts. this paper provides a conceptual primer for usersof the kepler data archive to understand and recognize systematic artifactswithin light curves and some methods for their removal. specific examples ofartifact mitigation are provided using data available within the archive.through the methods defined here, the kepler community will find a road map tomaximizing the quality and employment of the kepler legacy archive.

1303.2150	the mass of koi-94d and a relation for planet radius, mass, and incident  flux	we measure the mass of a modestly irradiated giant planet, koi-94d. we wishto determine whether this planet, which is in a 22-day orbit and receives 2700times as much incident flux as jupiter, is as dense as jupiter or rarefied likeinflated hot jupiters. koi-94 also hosts 3 smaller transiting planets, all ofwhich were detected by the kepler mission. with 26 radial velocities of koi-94from the w. m. keck observatory and a simultaneous fit to the kepler lightcurve, we measure the mass of the giant planet and determine that it is notinflated. support for the planetary interpretation of the other threecandidates comes from gravitational interactions through transit timingvariations, the statistical robustness of multi-planet systems against falsepositives, and several lines of evidence that no other star resides within thephotometric aperture. the radial velocity analyses of koi-94b and koi-94e offermarginal (&gt;2\sigma) mass detections, whereas the observations of koi-94c offeronly an upper limit to its mass. using the koi-94 system and other planets withpublished values for both mass and radius (138 exoplanets total, including 35with m &lt; 150 earth masses), we establish two fundamental planes for exoplanetsthat relate their mass, incident flux, and radius from a few earth masses up toten jupiter masses. these equations can be used to predict the radius or massof a planet.

1307.5842	the same frequency of planets inside and outside open clusters of stars	most stars and their planets form in open clusters. over 95 per cent of suchclusters have stellar densities too low (less than a hundred stars per cubicparsec) to withstand internal and external dynamical stresses and fall apartwithin a few hundred million years. older open clusters have survived by virtueof being richer and denser in stars (1,000 to 10,000 per cubic parsec) whenthey formed. such clusters represent a stellar environment very different fromthe birthplace of the sun and other planet-hosting field stars. so far morethan 800 planets have been found around sun-like stars in the field. the fieldplanets are usually the size of neptune or smaller. in contrast, only fourplanets have been found orbiting stars in open clusters, all with massessimilar to or greater than that of jupiter. here we report observations of thetransits of two sun-like stars by planets smaller than neptune in thebillion-year-old open cluster ngc6811. this demonstrates that small planets canform and survive in a dense cluster environment, and implies that the frequencyand properties of planets in open clusters are consistent with those of planetsaround field stars in the galaxy.

1307.8128	kepler-63b: a giant planet in a polar orbit around a young sun-like star	we present the discovery and characterization of a giant planet orbiting theyoung sun-like star kepler-63 (koi-63, $m_{\rm kp} = 11.6$, $t_{\rm eff} =5576$ k, $m_\star = 0.98\, m_\odot$). the planet transits every 9.43 days, withapparent depth variations and brightening anomalies caused by large starspots.the planet's radius is $6.1 \pm 0.2 r_{\earth}$, based on the transit lightcurve and the estimated stellar parameters. the planet's mass could not bemeasured with the existing radial-velocity data, due to the high level ofstellar activity, but if we assume a circular orbit we can place a rough upperbound of $120 m_{\earth}$ (3$\sigma$). the host star has a high obliquity($\psi$ = $104^{\circ}$), based on the rossiter-mclaughlin effect and ananalysis of starspot-crossing events. this result is valuable because almostall previous obliquity measurements are for stars with more massive planets andshorter-period orbits. in addition, the polar orbit of the planet combined withan analysis of spot-crossing events reveals a large and persistent polarstarspot. such spots have previously been inferred using doppler tomography,and predicted in simulations of magnetic activity of young sun-like stars.

1501.01101	validation of twelve small kepler transiting planets in the habitable  zone	we present an investigation of twelve candidate transiting planets fromkepler with orbital periods ranging from 34 to 207 days, selected from initialindications that they are small and potentially in the habitable zone (hz) oftheir parent stars. few of these objects are known. the expected dopplersignals are too small to confirm them by demonstrating that their masses are inthe planetary regime. here we verify their planetary nature by validating themstatistically using the blender technique, which simulates large numbers offalse positives and compares the resulting light curves with the keplerphotometry. this analysis was supplemented with new follow-up observations(high-resolution optical and near-infrared spectroscopy, adaptive opticsimaging, and speckle interferometry), as well as an analysis of the fluxcentroids. for eleven of them (koi-0571.05, 1422.04, 1422.05, 2529.02, 3255.01,3284.01, 4005.01, 4087.01, 4622.01, 4742.01, and 4745.01) we show that thelikelihood they are true planets is far greater than that of a false positive,to a confidence level of 99.73% (3 sigma) or higher. for koi-4427.01 theconfidence level is about 99.2% (2.6 sigma). with our accurate characterizationof the gkm host stars, the derived planetary radii range from 1.1 to 2.7r_earth. all twelve objects are confirmed to be in the hz, and nine are smallenough to be rocky. excluding three of them that have been previously validatedby others, our study doubles the number of known rocky planets in the hz.koi-3284.01 (kepler-438b) and koi-4742.01 (kepler-442b) are the planets mostsimilar to the earth discovered to date when considering their size andincident flux jointly.

1501.03798	a nearby m star with three transiting super-earths discovered by k2	small, cool planets represent the typical end-products of planetaryformation. studying the archi- tectures of these systems, measuring planetmasses and radii, and observing these planets' atmospheres during transitdirectly informs theories of planet assembly, migration, and evolution. here wereport the discovery of three small planets orbiting a bright (ks = 8.6 mag) m0dwarf using data collected as part of k2, the new transit survey using there-purposed kepler spacecraft. stellar spectroscopy and k2 photometry indicatethat the system hosts three transiting planets with radii 1.5-2.1 r_earth,straddling the transition region between rocky and increasinglyvolatile-dominated compositions. with orbital periods of 10-45 days the planetsreceive just 1.5-10x the flux incident on earth, making these some of thecoolest small planets known orbiting a nearby star; planet d is located nearthe inner edge of the system's habitable zone. the bright, low-mass star makesthis system an excellent laboratory to determine the planets' masses viadoppler spectroscopy and to constrain their atmospheric compositions viatransit spectroscopy. this discovery demonstrates the ability of k2 and futurespace-based transit searches to find many fascinating objects of interest.

1503.00363	observations of binary stars with the differential speckle survey  instrument. v. toward an empirical metal-poor mass-luminosity relation	in an effort to better understand the details of the stellar structure andevolution of metal poor stars, the gemini north telescope was used on twooccasions to take speckle imaging data of a sample of known spectroscopicbinary stars and other nearby stars in order to search for and resolve closecompanions. the observations were obtained using the differential specklesurvey instrument, which takes data in two filters simultaneously. the resultspresented here are of 90 observations of 23 systems in which one or morecompanions was detected, and 6 stars where no companion was detected to thelimit of the camera capabilities at gemini. in the case of the binary andmultiple stars, these results are then further analyzed to make first orbitdeterminations in five cases, and orbit refinements in four other cases. massinformation is derived, and since the systems span a range in metallicity, astudy is presented that compares our results with the expected trend in totalmass as derived from the most recent yale isochrones as a function of metalabundance. these data suggest that metal-poor main-sequence stars are lessmassive at a given color than their solar-metallicity analogues in a mannerconsistent with that predicted from the theory.

1503.03516	understanding the effects of stellar multiplicity on the derived planet  radii from transit surveys: implications for kepler, k2, and tess	we present a study on the effect of undetected stellar companions on thederived planetary radii for the kepler objects of interest (kois). the currentproduction of the koi list assumes that the each koi is a single star. notaccounting for stellar multiplicity statistically biases the planets towardssmaller radii. the bias towards smaller radii depends on the properties of thecompanion stars and whether the planets orbit the primary or the companionstars. defining a planetary radius correction factor $x_r$, we find that if thekois are assumed to be single, then, {\it on average}, the planetary radii maybe underestimated by a factor of $\langle x_r \rangle \approx 1.5$. if typicalradial velocity and high resolution imaging observations are performed and nocompanions are detected, this factor reduces to $\langle x_r \rangle \approx1.2$. the correction factor $\langle x_r \rangle$ is dependent upon the primarystar properties and ranges from $\langle x_r \rangle \approx 1.6$ for a and fstars to $\langle x_r \rangle \approx 1.2$ for k and m stars. for missions likek2 and tess where the stars may be closer than the stars in the kepler targetsample, observational vetting (primary imaging) reduces the radius correctionfactor to $\langle x_r \rangle \approx 1.1$. finally, we show that if thestellar multiplicity rates are not accounted for correctly, occurrence ratecalculations for earth-sized planets may overestimate the frequency of smallplanets by as much as $15-20$\%.

1508.06502	a comparison of spectroscopic versus imaging techniques for detecting  close companions to kepler objects of interest	(abbreviated) kepler planet candidates require both spectroscopic and imagingfollow-up observations to rule out false positives and detect blended stars.[...] in this paper, we examine a sample of 11 kepler host stars withcompanions detected by two techniques -- near-infrared adaptive optics and/oroptical speckle interferometry imaging, and a new spectroscopic deblendingmethod. we compare the companion teff and flux ratios (f_b/f_a, where a is theprimary and b is the companion) derived from each technique, and find no caseswhere both companion parameters agree within 1sigma errors. in 3/11 cases thecompanion teff values agree within 1sigma errors, and in 2/11 cases thecompanion f_b/f_a values agree within 1sigma errors. examining each keplersystem individually considering multiple avenues (isochrone mapping, contrastcurves, probability of being bound), we suggest two cases for which thetechniques most likely agree in their companion detections (detect the samecompanion star). overall, our results support the advantage the spectroscopicdeblending technique has for finding very close-in companions ($\theta\lesssim$0.02-0.05") that are not easily detectable with imaging. however, wealso specifically show how high-contrast ao and speckle imaging observationsdetect companions at larger separations ($\theta \geq$0.02-0.05") that aremissed by the spectroscopic technique, provide additional information forcharacterizing the companion and its potential contamination (e.g., pa,separation, $\delta$m), and cover a wider range of primary star effectivetemperatures. the investigation presented here illustrates the utility ofcombining the two techniques to reveal higher-order multiples in knownplanet-hosting systems.

1511.00934	detailed abundances of stars with small planets discovered by kepler i:  the first sample	we present newly derived stellar parameters and the detailed abundances of 19elements of seven stars with small planets discovered by nasa's kepler mission.each star save one has at least one planet with a radius &lt;= 1.6 r_earth,suggesting a primarily rocky composition. the stellar parameters and abundancesare derived from high signal-to-noise ratio, high-resolution echellespectroscopy obtained with the 10-m keck i telescope and hires spectrometerusing standard spectroscopic techniques. the metallicities of the seven starsrange from -0.32 dex to +0.13 dex, with an average metallicity that issubsolar, supporting previous suggestions that, unlike jupiter-type giantplanets, small planets do not form preferentially around metal-rich stars. theabundances of elements other than iron are in line with a population ofgalactic disk stars, and despite our modest sample size, we find hints that thecompositions of stars with small planets are similar to stars without knownplanets and with neptune-size planets, but not to those of stars with giantplanets. this suggests that the formation of small planets does not requireexceptional host-star compositions and that small planets may be ubiquitous inthe galaxy. we compare our derived abundances (which have typical uncertaintiesof &lt;= 0.04 dex) to the condensation temperature of the elements; a correlationbetween the two has been suggested as a possible signature of rocky planetformation. none of the stars demonstrate the putative rocky planet signature,despite at least three of the stars having rocky planets estimated to containenough refractory material to produce the signature, if real. more detailedabundance analyses of stars known to host small planets are needed to verifyour results and place ever more stringent constraints on planet formationmodels.

(2013) aresolar-like in their properties and each harbors at least one exoplanet (orcandidate) of radius $\le$2.5\re. the variability timescale examined is typicalfor habitable zone planets orbiting solar-like stars and we note that thediscovery of the smallest exoplanets ($\le$1.2\re) with corresponding transitdepths of less than $\sim$0.18 mmag, occur for the brightest, photometricallyquietest stars. thus, these detections are quite rare in $kepler$ observations.some brighter and more evolved stars (subgiants), the latter which often showlarge radial velocity jitter, are found to be among the photometricallyquietest solar-like stars in our sample and the most likely small planettransit hunting grounds. the sun is discussed as a solar-like star proxy toprovide insights into the nature and cause of photometric variability. it isshown that $kepler's$ broad, visible light observations are insensitive tovariability caused by chromospheric activity that may be present in theobserved stars.

astro-ph;0005435	an exploration of the paradigm for the 2-3 hour period gap in  cataclysmic variables	we critically examine the basic paradigm for the origin of the 2-3 hr periodgap in cataclysmic variables (cvs). we carry out an extensive populationsynthesis study of cvs starting from ~ 3 x 10^6 primordial binaries, andevolving some ~ 2 x 10^4 surviving systems through their cv phase. inparticular we study current-epoch distributions of cvs in the $\dot m-p_{orb}$,r_{2}-p_{orb}, m_{2}-p_{orb}, q-p_{orb}, t_{eff}-p_{orb}, and l_{2}-p_{orb}planes, where $\dot m$ is the mass transfer rate, q is the mass ratio m_2/m_1,and m_2, r_2, t_{eff}, and l_2 are the donor star mass, radius, effectivetemperature, and luminosity, respectively. this work presents a new perspectiveon theoretical studies of the long-term evolution of cvs. in particular, weshow that if the current paradigm is correct, the secondary masses in cvs justabove the period gap should be as much as ~ 50% lower than would be inferred ifone assumes a main-sequence radius-mass relation for the donor star.

astro-ph;0309418	x-ray and uv observations of the dwarf nova vw hyi in quiescence	we present an analysis of x-ray and ultra-violet data of the dwarf nova vwhyi that were obtained with xmm-newton during the quiescent state. the x-rayspectrum indicates the presence of an optically thin plasma in the boundarylayer that cools as it settles onto the white dwarf. the plasma has acontinuous temperature distribution that is well described by a power-law or acooling flow model with a maximum temperature of 6-8 kev. we estimate from thex-ray spectrum a boundary layer luminosity of 8*10^30 erg/s, which is only 20per cent of the disk luminosity. the rate of accretion onto the white dwarf is5*10^-12 solar masses per year, about half of the rate in the disk. from thehigh-resolution x-ray spectra, we estimate that the x-ray emitting part of theboundary layer is rotating with a velocity of 540 km/s, which is close therotation velocity of the white dwarf but significantly smaller than thekeplerian velocity. we detect a 60-s quasi-periodic oscillation of the x-rayflux that is likely due to the rotation of the boundary layer. the x-ray andthe ultra-violet flux show strong variability on a time scale of ~1500 s. wefind that the variability in the two bands is correlated and that the x-rayfluctuations are delayed by ~100 s. the correlation indicates that the variableultra-violet flux is emitted near the transition region between the disk andthe boundary layer and that accretion rate fluctuations in this region arepropagated to the x-ray emitting part of the boundary layer within ~100 s. anorbital modulation of the x-ray flux suggests that the inner accretion disk istilted with respect to the orbital plane. the elemental abundances in theboundary layer are close to their solar values.

astro-ph;0607140	mass determination and detection of the onset of chromospheric activity  for the sub-stellar object in ef eridani	ef eri is a magnetic cataclysmic variable that has been in a low accretionstate for the past nine years. low state optical spectra reveal the underlyingzeeman-split white dwarf absorption lines. these features are used to determinea value of 13-14 mg as the white dwarf field strength. recently, 5-7 years intothe low state, balmer and other emission lines have appeared in the optical. ananalysis of the h$\alpha$ emission line yields the first radial velocitysolution for ef eri, leading to a spectroscopic ephemeris for the binary and,using the best available white dwarf mass of 0.6m${\odot}$, a mass estimate forthe secondary of 0.055m${\odot}$. for a white dwarf mass of 0.95m${\odot}$, theaverage for magnetic white dwarfs, the secondary mass increases to0.087m${\odot}$. at ef eri's orbital period of 81 minutes, this higher masssecondary could not be a normal star and still fit within the roche lobe. thesource of the balmer and other emission lines is confirmed to be from thesub-stellar secondary and we argue that it is due to stellar activity. wecompare ef eri's emission line spectrum and activity behavior to that recentlyobserved in am her and vv pup and attributed to stellar activity. we exploreobservations and models originally developed for v471 tau, for the rs cvnbinaries, and for extra-solar planets. we conclude that irradiation of thesecondary in ef eri and similar systems is unlikely and, in polars, themagnetic field interaction between the two stars (with a possible tidalcomponent) is a probable mechanism which would concentrate chromosphericactivity on the secondary near the sub-stellar point of the white dwarf.

astro-ph;0608083	spitzer observations of var her 04: possible detection of dust formation  in a super-outbursting toad	we present four mips (24 \micron) and two irac (3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0\micron) spitzer observations of the newly discovered tremendous outburstamplitude dwarf nova (toad) var her 04 during decline from super-outburst. thefour mips observations span 271 days and the two irac observations span 211days. along the line-of-sight to var her 04, there is a foreground m-starwithin 1\arcsec of the variable; as a result, all of the spitzer photometrypresented in this paper is a blend of the foreground m-star and var her 04. weestimate the quiescent level of the toad to be $\delta v=4-5$ magnitudes belowthat of the m-star. based upon the spectral energy distribution and the 2masscolors, we find the m-star to be an m3.5v dwarf at a distance of 80-130 pc.based upon its outburst amplitude and quiescent apparent magnitude, we estimatethe distance to var her 04 to be 200-400 pc, suggesting that the line-of-sightforeground star is physically unrelated to the cataclysmic variable. all of thespitzer photometry is consistent with the photospheric emission of theline-of-sight m3.5v star, except for one 24 \micron observation obtained afterthe variable re-brightened. this 24 \micron flux density is 75 $\mu$jy($4\sigma$) above the preceding and following mips observations. we tentativelysuggest that the mid-infrared brightening of 75 $\mu$jy may be associated witha dust formation event in the super-outburst ejecta. assuming a dusttemperature of 100-400 k, we have estimated the amount of dust required. wefind $10^{-13}-10^{-11}$ m$_\odot$ of dust is needed, consistent with amountsof mass ejection in toads expected during super-outburst, and possibly makingtoads important contributors to the recycling of the interstellar medium.

astro-ph;0609535	the nature of the secondary star in the black hole x-ray transient v616  mon (=a0620-00)	we have used nirspec on keck ii to obtain $k$-band spectroscopy of the lowmass x-ray binary v616 mon (= a0620$-$00). v616 mon is the proto-typical softx-ray transient containing a black hole primary. as such it is important toconstrain the masses of the binary components. the modeling of the infraredobservations of ellipsoidal variations in this system lead to a derived mass of11.0 m$_{\sun}$ for the black hole. the validity of this derivation has beencalled into question due to the possiblity that the secondary star's spectralenergy distribution is contaminated by accretion disk emission (acting todilute the variations). our new $k$-band spectrum of v616 mon reveals alate-type k dwarf secondary star, but one that has very weak $^{\rm 12}$coabsorption features. comparison of v616 mon with ss cyg leads us to estimatethat the accretion disk supplies only a small amount of $k$-band flux, and theellipsoidal variations are not seriously contaminated. if true, the derivedorbital inclination of v616 mon is not greatly altered, and the mass of theblack hole remains large. a preliminary stellar atmosphere model for the$k$-band spectrum of v616 mon reveals that the carbon abundance isapproximately 50% of the solar value. we conclude that the secondary star inv616 mon has either suffered serious contamination from the accretion ofsupernova ejecta that created the black hole primary, or it is the strippedremains of a formerly more massive secondary star, one in which the cno cyclehad been active.

astro-ph;9805182	the three dimensional structure of euv accretion regions in am herculis  stars: modeling of euv photometric and spectroscopic observations	we have developed a model of the high-energy accretion region for magneticcataclysmic variables and applied it to {\it extreme ultraviolet explorer}observations of 10 am herculis type systems. the major features of the euvlight curves are well described by the model. the light curves exhibit a largevariety of features such as eclipses of the accretion region by the secondarystar and the accretion stream, and dips caused by material very close to theaccretion region. while all the observed features of the light curves arehighly dependent on viewing geometry, none of the light curves are consistentwith a flat, circular accretion spot whose lightcurve would vary solely fromprojection effects. the accretion region immediately above the wd surface is asource of euv radiation caused by either a vertical extent to the accretionspot, or compton scattering off electrons in the accretion column, or, verylikely, both. our model yields spot sizes averaging 0.06 r$_{wd}$, or $f \sim 1\times 10^{-3}$ the wd surface area, and average spot heights of 0.023r$_{wd}$. spectra extracted during broad dip phases are softer than spectraduring the out-of-dip phases. this spectral ratio measurement leads to theconclusion that compton scattering, some absorption by a warm absorber,geometric effects, an asymmetric temperature structure in the accretion regionand an asymmetric density structure of the accretion columnare all importantcomponents needed to fully explain the data. spectra extracted at phases wherethe accretion spot is hidden behind the limb of the wd, but with the accretioncolumn immediately above the spot still visible, show no evidence of emissionfeatures characteristic of a hot plasma.

0809.5041	vv pup in a low state: secondary-star irradiation or stellar activity?	aims. emission lines in polars show complex profiles with multiple componentsthat are typically ascribed to the accretion stream, threading region,accretion spot, and the irradiated secondary-star. in low-state polars thefractional contribution by the accretion stream, and the accretion spot isgreatly reduced offering an opportunity to study the effect of thesecondary-star irradiation or stellar activity. we observed vv pup during anexceptional low-state to study and constrain the properties of the line-formingregions and to search for evidence of chromospheric activity and/orirradiation. methods. we obtained phase-resolved optical spectra at the esovlt+fors1 with the aim of analyzing the emission line profile and radialvelocity as a function of the orbital period. we also tailored irradiatedsecondary-star models to compare the predicted and the observed emission linesand to establish the nature of the line-forming regions. results. ourobservations and data analysis, when combined with models of the irradiatedsecondary-star, show that, while the weak low ionization metal lines (fei andmgi) may be consistent with irradiation processes, the dominant balmer hemission lines, as well as nai and hei, cannot be reproduced by the irradiatedsecondary-star models. we favor the secondary-star chromospheric activity asthe main forming region and cause of the observed h, nai, and he emissionlines, though a threading region very close to the l1 point cannot be excluded.

0811.0363	observations of v592 cassiopeiae with the spitzer space telescope - dust  in the mid-infrared	we present the ultraviolet-optical-infrared spectral energy distribution ofthe low inclination novalike cataclysmic variable v592 cassiopeiae, includingnew mid-infrared observations from 3.5-24 microns obtained with the spitzerspace telescope. at wavelengths shortward of 8 microns, the spectral energydistribution of v592 cas is dominated by the steady state accretion disk, butthere is flux density in excess of the summed stellar components and accretiondisk at longer wavelengths. reproducing the observed spectral energydistribution from ultraviolet to mid-infrared wavelengths can be accomplishedby including a circumbinary disk composed of cool dust, with a maximum inneredge temperature of ~500 k. the total mass of circumbinary dust in v592 cas(~10^21 g) is similar to that found from recent studies of infrared excess inmagnetic cvs, and is too small to have a significant effect on the long-termsecular evolution of the cataclysmic variable. the existence of circumbinarydust in v592 cas is possibly linked to the presence of a wind outflow in thissystem, which can provide the necessary raw materials to replenish thecircumbinary disk on relatively short timescales, and/or could be a remnantfrom the common envelope phase early in the formation history of the system.

0812.2013	periodic variables in the open cluster ngc 2301	we present the results of a search for periodic variables within 4078time-series light curves and an analysis of the period-color plane for stars inthe field of the open cluster ngc2301. one hundred thirty-eight periodicvariables were discovered, of which five are eclipsing binary candidates withunequal minima. the remaining 133 periodic variables appear to consist mainlyof late-type stars whose variation is due to rotation modulated by star spotactivity. the determined periods range from less than a day to over 14 days andhave nearly unreddened b-r colors in the range of 0.8 to 2.8. the barnes (2003)interpretation of the period-color plane of late type stars is tested with ourdata. our data did not show distinct i and c sequences, likely due to nonmemberfield stars contaminating in the background, as we estimate the totalcontamination to be 43%. using different assumptions, the gyrochronological ageof the cluster is calculated to be 210+/-25 myr, which falls in the range ofage values (164-250 myr) determined by previous studies. finally, we presentevidence which nullifies the earlier suggestion that two of the variable starsin ngc2301 might be white dwarfs.
