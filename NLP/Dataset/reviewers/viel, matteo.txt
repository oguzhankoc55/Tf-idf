0901.0605	early dark energy at high redshifts: status and perspectives	early dark energy models, for which the contribution to the dark energydensity at high redshifts is not negligible, influence the growth of cosmicstructures and could leave observable signatures that are different from thestandard cosmological constant cold dark matter ($\lambda$cdm) model. in thispaper, we present updated constraints on early dark energy using geometricaland dynamical probes. from wmap five-year data, baryon acoustic oscillationsand type ia supernovae luminosity distances, we obtain an upper limit of thedark energy density at the last scattering surface (lss), $\omega_{\rmede}(z_{\rm lss})&lt;2.3\times10^{-2}$ (95% c.l.). when we include higher redshiftobservational probes, such as measurements of the linear growth factors,gamma-ray bursts (grbs) and lyman-$\alpha$ forest (\lya), this limit improvessignificantly and becomes $\omega_{\rm ede}(z_{\rm lss})&lt;1.4\times10^{-3}$ (95%c.l.). furthermore, we find that future measurements, based on thealcock-paczy\'nski test using the 21cm neutral hydrogen line, on grbs and onthe \lya forest, could constrain the behavior of the dark energy component anddistinguish at a high confidence level between early dark energy models andpure $\lambda$cdm. in this case, the constraints on the amount of early darkenergy at the last scattering surface improve by a factor ten, when compared topresent constraints. we also discuss the impact on the parameter $\gamma$, thegrowth rate index, which describes the growth of structures in standard and inmodified gravity models.

0904.3545	damped lyman-alpha systems in high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations	we investigate the properties of damped lyman-alpha systems (dlas) usinghigh-resolution and large box-size cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of alambdacdm model. the numerical code used is a modification of gadget-2 with aself consistent implementation of the metal enrichment mechanism (tornatore etal. 2007). we explore the numerical convergence of some relevant physicalquantities and we vary the parameters describing the properties of galacticwinds; the initial stellar mass function; the linear dark matter power spectrumand the metal enrichment pattern of the igm (intergalactic medium) around dlas.we find that strong galactic winds with speed of about 600 km/s, in anenergy-driven wind scenario, are needed in order to match the observed columndensity distribution function for dlas and the evolution of the neutralhydrogen content with redshift. the momentum-driven implementation of thegalactic wind model, that relates the speed and mass load in the wind to theproperties of the dark matter haloes, shows a behaviour which is intermediatebetween the energy-driven galactic winds of small (100 km/s) and large (600km/s) velocities. at z=3 the contribution of haloes of masses between 10^9 and10^10 h^-1 m_sun, for dlas below 10^20.8 cm^-2, to the column densitydistribution function, is significant. by interpolating physical quantitiesalong line-of-sights through massive haloes we qualitatively show how differentgalactic wind models impact on the igm around dlas. furthermore, we analysestatistics related to the velocity widths of siii associated to dlas: themetallicity in the wind seems to be rather clumpy and this produces anunderestimation of the observed velocity widths. we outline possible solutionsto this problem.

0907.4753	the high redshift integrated sachs-wolfe effect	in this paper we rely on the quasar (qso) catalog of the sloan digital skysurvey data release six (sdss dr6) of about one million photometricallyselected qsos to compute the integrated sachs-wolfe (isw) effect at highredshift, aiming at constraining the behavior of the expansion rate and thusthe behaviour of dark energy at those epochs. this unique sample significantlyextends previous catalogs to higher redshifts while retaining high efficiencyin the selection algorithm. we compute the auto-correlation function (acf) ofqso number density from which we extract the bias and the stellarcontamination. we then calculate the cross-correlation function (ccf) betweenqso number density and cosmic microwave background (cmb) temperaturefluctuations in different subsamples: at high z&gt;1.5 and low z&lt;1.5 redshifts andfor two different choices of qso in a conservative and in a more speculativeanalysis. we find an overall evidence for a cross-correlation different fromzero at the 2.7\sigma level, while this evidence drops to 1.5\sigma at z&gt;1.5.we focus on the capabilities of the isw to constrain the behaviour of the darkenergy component at high redshift both in the \lambdacdm and early dark energycosmologies, when the dark energy is substantially unconstrained byobservations. at present, the inclusion of the isw data results in a poorimprovement compared to the obtained constraints from other cosmologicaldatasets. we study the capabilities of future high-redshift qso survey and findthat the isw signal can improve the constraints on the most importantcosmological parameters derived from planck cmb data, including the highredshift dark energy abundance, by a factor \sim 1.5.

0910.4125	cross-correlations of the lyman-alpha forest with weak lensing  convergence i: analytical estimates of s/n and implications for neutrino mass  and dark energy	we expect a detectable correlation between two seemingly unrelatedquantities: the four point function of the cosmic microwave background (cmb)and the amplitude of flux decrements in quasar (qso) spectra. the amplitude ofcmb convergence in a given direction measures the projected surface density ofmatter. measurements of qso flux decrements trace the small-scale distributionof gas along a given line-of-sight. while the cross-correlation between thesetwo measurements is small for a single line-of-sight, upcoming large surveysshould enable its detection. this paper presents analytical estimates for thesignal to noise (s/n) for measurements of the cross-correlation between theflux decrement and the convergence and for measurements of thecross-correlation between the variance in flux decrement and the convergence.for the ongoing boss (sdss iii) and planck surveys, we estimate an s/n of 30and 9.6 for these two correlations. for the proposed bigboss and actpolsurveys, we estimate an s/n of 130 and 50 respectively. since thecross-correlation between the variance in flux decrement and the convergence isproportional to the fourth power of $\sigma_8$, the amplitude of thesecross-correlations can potentially be used to measure the amplitude of$\sigma_8$ at z~2 to 2.5% with boss and planck and even better with future datasets. these measurements have the potential to test alternative theories fordark energy and to constrain the mass of the neutrino. the large potentialsignal estimated in our analytical calculations motivate tests with non-linearhydrodynamical simulations and analyses of upcoming data sets.

0911.0699	the impact of feedback on the low redshift intergalactic medium	we analyse the evolution of the properties of the low-redshift intergalacticmedium (igm) using high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations that include adetailed chemical evolution model. we focus on the effects that two differentforms of energy feedback, strong galactic winds driven by supernova explosionand active galactic nuclei (agn) powered by gas accretion onto super-massiveblack holes (bhs), have on the thermo- and chemo-dynamical properties of of thelow redshift igm. we find that feedback associated to winds (w) and bhs leavedistinct signatures in both the chemical and thermal history of the baryons,especially at redshift z&lt;3 [..] we present results for the enrichment in termsof mass and metallicity distributions for the whim phase, both as a function ofdensity and temperature. finally, we compute the evolution of the relativeabundances between different heavy elements, namely oxygen, carbon and iron.while both c/o and o/fe evolve differently at high redshifts for differentfeedback models, their values are similar at z=0 [..]. the sensitivity of whimproperties on the implemented feedback scheme could be important both fordiscriminating between different feedback physics and for detecting the whimwith future far-uv and x-ray telescopes.

0911.1249	high-redshift cosmography	we constrain the parameters describing the kinematical state of the universeusing a cosmographic approach, which is fundamental in that it requires a veryminimal set of assumptions (namely to specify a metric) and does not rely onthe dynamical equations for gravity. on the data side, we consider the mostrecent compilations of supernovae and gamma ray bursts catalogues. this allowsto further extend the cosmographic fit up to $z = 6.6$, i.e. up to redshift forwhich one could start to resolve the low z degeneracy among competingcosmological models. in order to reliably control the cosmographic approach athigh redshifts, we adopt the expansion in the improved parameter $y = z/(1+z)$.this series has the great advantage to hold also for $z &gt; 1$ and hence it isthe appropriate tool for handling data including non-nearby distanceindicators. we find that gamma ray bursts, probing higher redshifts thansupernovae, have constraining power and do require (and statistically allow) acosmographic expansion at higher order than supernovae alone. exploiting theset of data from union and grbs catalogues, we show (for the first time in apurely cosmographic approach parametrized by deceleration $q_0$, jerk $j_0$,snap $s_0$) a definitively negative deceleration parameter $q_0$ up to the3$\sigma$ confidence level. we present also forecasts for realistic data setsthat are likely to be obtained in the next few years.

1003.2422	the effect of neutrinos on the matter distribution as probed by the  intergalactic medium	we present a suite of full hydrodynamical cosmological simulations thatquantitatively address the impact of neutrinos on the (mildly non-linear)spatial distribution of matter and in particular on the neutral hydrogendistribution in the intergalactic medium (igm), which is responsible for theintervening lyman-alpha absorption in quasar spectra. the free-streaming ofneutrinos results in a (non-linear) scale-dependent suppression of powerspectrum of the total matter distribution at scales probed by lyman-alphaforest data which is larger than the linear theory prediction by about 25% andstrongly redshift dependent. by extracting a set of realistic mock quasarspectra, we quantify the effect of neutrinos on the flux probabilitydistribution function and flux power spectrum. the differences in the matterpower spectra translate into a ~2.5% (5%) difference in the flux power spectrumfor neutrino masses with sigma m_{\nu} = 0.3 ev (0.6 ev). this rather smalleffect is difficult to detect from present lyman-alpha forest data and nearlyperfectly degenerate with the overall amplitude of the matter power spectrum ascharacterised by sigma_8. if the results of the numerical simulations arenormalized to have the same sigma_8 in the initial conditions, then neutrinosproduce a smaller suppression in the flux power of about 3% (5%) for sigmam_{\nu} = 0.6$ ev (1.2 ev) when compared to a simulation without neutrinos. wepresent constraints on neutrino masses using the sloan digital sky survey fluxpower spectrum alone and find an upper limit of sigma m_{\nu} &lt; 0.9$ ev (2sigma c.l.), comparable to constraints obtained from the cosmic microwavebackground data or other large scale structure probes.

1003.3451	primordial non-gaussianity and the nrao vla sky survey	the nrao vla sky survey (nvss) is the only dataset that allows an accuratedetermination of the auto-correlation function (acf) on angular scales ofseveral degrees for active galactic nuclei (agns) at typical redshifts $z\simeq 1$. surprisingly, the acf is found to be positive on such large scaleswhile, in the framework of the standard hierarchical clustering scenario withgaussian primordial perturbations it should be negative for aredshift-independent effective halo mass of order of that found foroptically-selected quasars. we show that a small primordial non-gaussianity canadd sufficient power on very large scales to account for the observed nvss acf.the best-fit value of the parameter $f_{\rm nl}$, quantifying the amplitude ofprimordial non-gaussianity of local type is $f_{\rm nl}=62 \pm 27$ ($1\,\sigma$error bar) and $25&lt;f_{\rm nl}&lt;117$ ($2\,\sigma$ confidence level),corresponding to a detection of non-gaussianity significant at the $\sim3\,\sigma$ confidence level. the minimal halo mass of nvss sources is found tobe $m_{\rm min}=10^{12.47\pm0.26}h^{-1}m_{\odot}$ ($1\,\sigma$) strikinglyclose to that found for optically selected quasars. we discuss caveats andpossible physical and systematic effects that can impact on the results.

1007.1969	constraining primordial non-gaussianity with high-redshift probes	we present an analysis of the constraints on the amplitude of primordialnon-gaussianity of local type described by the dimensionless parameter $f_{\rmnl}$. these constraints are set by the auto-correlation functions (acfs) of twolarge scale structure probes, the radio sources from nrao vla sky survey (nvss)and the quasar catalogue of sloan digital sky survey release six (sdss dr6qsos), as well as by their cross-correlation functions (ccfs) with the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) temperature map (integrated sachs-wolfe effect).several systematic effects that may affect the observational estimates of theacfs and of the ccfs are investigated and conservatively accounted for. ourapproach exploits the large-scale scale-dependence of the non-gaussian halobias. the derived constraints on {$f_{\rm nl}$} coming from the nvss ccf andfrom the qso acf and ccf are weaker than those previously obtained from thenvss acf, but still consistent with them. finally, we obtain the constraints on$f_{\rm nl}=53\pm25$ ($1\,\sigma$) and $f_{\rm nl}=58\pm24$ ($1\,\sigma$) fromnvss data and sdss dr6 qso data, respectively.

1007.3736	the impact of coupled dark energy cosmologies on the high-redshift  intergalactic medium	we present an analysis of high-resolution hydrodynamical n-body simulationsof coupled dark energy cosmologies which focusses on the statistical propertiesof the transmitted lyman-alpha flux in the high-redshift intergalactic medium(igm). in these models the growth of the diffuse cosmic web differs from thestandard lcdm case: the density distribution is skewed towards underdenseregions and the matter power spectra are typically larger (in a scale dependentway). these differences are also appreciable in the lyman-alpha flux and arelarger than 5% (10%) at z=2-4 in the flux probability distribution function(pdf) for high transmissivity regions and for values of the coupling parameter\beta = 0.08 (\beta = 0.2). the flux power spectrum is also affected at the ~2%(~ 5-10%) level for \beta = 0.08 (\beta = 0.2) in a redshift dependent way. weinfer the behaviour of flux pdf and flux power for a reasonable range ofcouplings and present constraints using present high and low resolution datasets. we find an upper limit \beta &lt; 0.15 (at 2 sigma confidence level), whichis obtained using only igm data and is competitive with those inferred fromother large scale structure probes.

1010.1519	minimally parametric power spectrum reconstruction from the lyman-alpha  forest	current results from the lyman alpha forest assume that the primordial powerspectrum of density perturbations follows a simple power law form, withrunning. we present the first analysis of lyman alpha data to study the effectof relaxing this strong assumption on primordial and astrophysical constraints.we perform a large suite of numerical simulations, using them to calibrate aminimally parametric framework for describing the power spectrum. combined withcross-validation, a statistical technique which prevents over-fitting of thedata, this framework allows us to reconstruct the power spectrum shape withoutstrong prior assumptions. we find no evidence for deviation fromscale-invariance; our analysis also shows that current lyman alpha data do nothave sufficient statistical power to robustly probe the shape of the powerspectrum at these scales. in contrast, the ongoing baryon oscillation skysurvey (boss) will be able to do so with high precision. furthermore, thisnear-future data will be able to break degeneracies between the power spectrumshape and astrophysical parameters.

1011.1959	the impact of spatial fluctuations in the ultra-violet background on  intergalactic carbon and silicon	spatial inhomogeneities in the spectral shape of the ultra-violet background(uvb) at the tail-end of heii reionisation are thought to be the primary causeof the large fluctuations observed in the heii to hi ly-a forest optical depthratio, tau_heii/tau_hi, at z~2-3. these spectral hardness fluctuations willalso influence the ionisation balance of intergalactic metals; we extractrealistic quasar absorption spectra from a large hydrodynamical simulation toexamine their impact on intergalactic siiv and civ absorbers. using a varietyof toy uvb models, we find that while the predicted spatial inhomogeneities inspectral hardness have a significant impact on tau_heii/tau_hi, the longer meanfree path for photons with frequencies above and below the heii ionisation edgemeans these fluctuations have less effect on the siiv and civ ionisationbalance. furthermore, uvb models which produce the largest fluctuations inspecific intensity at the heii ionisation edge also have the softest ionisingspectra, and thus result in photo-ionisation rates which are too low to producesignificant fluctuations in the observed tau_siiv/tau_civ. instead, we findspatial variations in the igm metallicity will dominate any scatter intau_siiv/tau_civ. our results suggest that observational evidence forhomogeneity in the observed tau_siiv/tau_civ distribution does not rule out thepossibility of significant fluctuations in the uvb spectral shape at z~2-3. onthe other hand, the scatter in metallicity inferred from observations ofintergalactic civ and siiv absorption at z~2-3 using spatially uniformionisation corrections is likely intrinsic, and therefore provides a valuableconstraint on intergalactic metal enrichment scenarios at these redshifts.

1011.2116	studying the warm-hot intergalactic medium in emission	we assess the possibility to detect the warm-hot intergalactic medium (whim)in emission and to characterize its physical conditions and spatialdistribution through spatially resolved x-ray spectroscopy, in the framework ofthe recently proposed dios, edge, xenia, and origin missions, all of which areequipped with microcalorimeter-based detectors. for this purpose we analyze alarge set of mock emission spectra, extracted from a cosmologicalhydrodynamical simulation. these mock x-ray spectra are searched for emissionfeatures showing both the ovii k alpha triplet and oviii ly alpha line, whichconstitute a typical signature of the warm hot gas. our analysis shows that 1ms long exposures and energy resolution of 2.5 ev will allow us to detect about400 such features per deg^2 with a significance &gt;5 sigma and reveals that theseemission systems are typically associated with density ~100 above the mean. thetemperature can be estimated from the line ratio with a precision of ~20%. thecombined effect of contamination from other lines, variation in the level ofthe continuum, and degradation of the energy resolution reduces theseestimates. yet, with an energy resolution of 7 ev and all these effects takeninto account, one still expects about 160 detections per deg^2. these linesystems are sufficient to trace the spatial distribution of the line-emittinggas, which constitute an additional information, independent from linestatistics, to constrain the poorly known cosmic chemical enrichment historyand the stellar feedback processes.

1101.3319	galactic winds and extended lya emission from the host galaxies of high  column density qso absorption systems	we present 3d resonant radiative transfer simulations of the spatial andspectral diffusion of the lya radiation from a central source in the hostgalaxies of high column density absorption systems at z ~ 3. the radiativetransfer simulations are based on a suite of cosmological galaxy formationsimulations that reproduce a wide range of observed properties of damped lyaabsorption systems. the lya emission is predicted to be spatially extended upto several arcsec, and the spectral width of the lya emission is broadened toseveral hundred (in some case more than thousand) km/s. the distribution andthe dynamical state of the gas in the simulated galaxies is complex, the latterwith significant contributions from rotation and both in- and out-flows. theemerging lya radiation extends to gas with column densities of n_hi ~ 10^{18}cm^{-2} and its spectral shape varies strongly with viewing angle. the strongdependence on the central \hi column density and the hi velocity field suggeststhat the lya emission will also vary strongly with time on timescales of a fewdynamical times of the central region. such variations with time should beespecially pronounced at times where the host galaxy undergoes a major mergerand/or starburst. depending on the pre-dominance of in- or out-flow along agiven sightline and the central column density, the spectra show prominent bluepeaks, red peaks or double-peaked profiles. both spatial distribution andspectral shape are very sensitive to details of the galactic windimplementation. stronger galactic winds result in more spatially extended lyaemission and - somewhat counterintuitively - a narrower spectral distribution.

1103.0278	effects of massive neutrinos on the large-scale structure of the  universe	cosmological neutrinos strongly affect the evolution of the largeststructures in the universe, i.e. galaxies and galaxy clusters. we use largebox-size full hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the non-linear effectsthat massive neutrinos have on the spatial properties of cold dark matter (cdm)haloes. we quantify the difference with respect to the concordance lambdacdmmodel of the halo mass function and of the halo two-point correlation function.we model the redshift-space distortions and compute the errors on the lineardistortion parameter beta introduced if cosmological neutrinos are assumed tobe massless. we find that, if not taken correctly into account and depending onthe total neutrino mass, these effects could lead to a potentially fakesignature of modified gravity. future nearly all-sky spectroscopic galaxysurveys will be able to constrain the neutrino mass if it is larger than 0.6ev, using beta measurements alone and independently of the value of the matterpower spectrum normalisation. in combination with other cosmological probes,this will strengthen neutrino mass constraints and help breaking parameterdegeneracies.

1103.0378	cosmography beyond standard candles and rulers	we perform a cosmographic analysis using several cosmological observablessuch as the luminosity distance moduli, the volume distance, the angulardiameter distance and the hubble parameter. these quantities are determinedusing different data sets: supernovae type ia and gamma ray bursts, thebaryonic acoustic oscillations, the cosmic microwave background power spectrumand the hubble parameter as measured from surveys of galaxies. this data setallows to put constraints on the cosmographic expansion with unprecedentedprecision. we also present forecasts for the coefficients of the kinematicexpansion using future but realistic data sets: constraints on the coefficientsof the expansions are likely to improve by a factor ten with the upcoming largescale structure probes. finally, we derive the set of the cosmographicparameters for several cosmological models (including $\lambda$cdm) and comparethem with our best fit set. while distance measurements are unable todiscriminate among these models, we show that the inclusion of the hubble dataset leads to strong constraints on the lowest order coefficients and inparticular it is incompatible with $\lambda$cdm at 3-$\sigma$ confidence level.we discuss the reliability of this determination and suggest furtherobservations which might be of crucial importance for the viability ofcosmographic tests in the next future.

1103.4861	a cross-correlation study of the fermi-lat $\gamma$-ray diffuse  extragalactic signal	in this work, starting from 21 months of data from the fermi-large areatelescope, we derive maps of the residual isotropic gamma-ray emission, arelevant fraction of which is expected to be contributed by the extragalacticdiffuse gamma-ray background. we compute the angular two-point auto-correlationfunction of the residual fermi-lat maps at energies e&gt;1gev, e&gt;3gev and e&gt;30gevwell above the galactic plane and find no significant correlation signal. thisis, indeed, what is expected if the egb were contributed by bl lacertae, flatspectrum radio quasars or star-forming galaxies, since, in this case, thepredicted signal is very weak. then, we search for the integrated sachs-wolfesignature by cross-correlating the fermi-lat maps with the wmap7-cosmicmicrowave background map. we find a cross-correlation consistent with zero,even though the expected signal is larger than that of the egbauto-correlation. finally, in an attempt to constrain the nature of thegamma-ray background we cross-correlate the fermi-lat maps with the angulardistributions of objects that may contribute to the egb: qsos in the sdss-dr6catalog, nvss galaxies, 2mass galaxies and lrg in the sdss catalog. thecross-correlation is always consistent with zero, in agreement with theoreticalexpectations, but we find (with low statistical significance) some interestingfeatures that may indicate that some specific classes of objects contribute tothe egb. a chi2 analysis confirms that the correlation properties of the21-month data do not provide strong constraints of the egb origin. however, theresults suggest that the situation will significantly improve with the 5- and10-year fermi-lat data. the future egb analysis will then allow placingsignificant constraints on the nature of the egb and might provide in additiona detection of the isw signal.

1106.2543	neutrino signatures on the high transmission regions of the lyman-alpha  forest	we quantify the impact of massive neutrinos on the statistics of low densityregions in the intergalactic medium (igm) as probed by the lyman-alpha forestat redshifts z=2.2--4. based on mock but realistic quasar (qso) spectraextracted from hydrodynamic simulations with cold dark matter, baryons andneutrinos, we find that the probability distribution of weak lyman-alphaabsorption features, as sampled by lyman-alpha flux regions at hightransmissivity, is strongly affected by the presence of massive neutrinos. weshow that systematic errors affecting the lyman-alpha forest reduce but do noterase the neutrino signal. using the fisher matrix formalism, we conclude thatthe sum of the neutrino masses can be measured, using the method proposed inthis paper, with a precision smaller than 0.4 ev using a catalog of 200 highresolution (s/n~100) qso spectra. this number reduces to 0.27 ev by making useof reasonable priors in the other parameters that also affect the statistics ofthe high transitivity regions of the lyman-alpha forest. the constraintsobtained with this method can be combined with independent bounds from the cmb,large scale structures and measurements of the matter power spectrum from thelyman-alpha forest to produce tighter upper limits on the sum of the masses ofthe neutrinos.

1108.5203	coarse-grained cosmological perturbation theory	semi-analytical methods, based on eulerian perturbation theory, are apromising tool to follow the time evolution of cosmological perturbations atsmall redshifts and at mildly nonlinear scales. all these schemes are based ontwo approximations: the existence of a smoothing scale and the single-streamapproximation, where velocity dispersion of the dark matter fluid, as well ashigher moments of the particle distributions, are neglected. despite beingwidely recognized, these two assumptions are, in principle, incompatible, sinceany finite smoothing scale gives rise to velocity dispersion and higher momentsat larger scales. we describe a new approach to perturbation theory, where thevlasov and fluid equations are derived in presence of a finite coarse-grainingscale: this allows a clear separation between long and short distance modes andleads to a hybrid approach where the former are treated perturbatively and theeffect of the latter is encoded in external source terms for velocity, velocitydispersion, and all the higher order moments, which can be computed from n-bodysimulations. we apply the coarse-grained perturbation theory to the computationof the power spectrum and the cross-spectrum between density and velocitydispersion, and compare the results with n-body simulations, finding goodagreement.

1109.4416	massive neutrinos and the non-linear matter power spectrum	we perform an extensive suite of n-body simulations of the matter powerspectrum, incorporating massive neutrinos in the range m = 0.15-0.6 ev, probingthe non-linear regime at scales k &lt; 10 hmpc-1 at z &lt; 3. we extend the widelyused halofit approximation to account for the effect of massive neutrinos onthe power spectrum. in the strongly non-linear regime halofit systematicallyover-predicts the suppression due to the free-streaming of the neutrinos. themaximal discrepancy occurs at k ~ 1 hmpc-1, and is at the level of 10% of thetotal suppression. most published constraints on neutrino masses based onhalofit are not affected, as they rely on data probing the matter powerspectrum in the linear or mildly non-linear regime. however, predictions forfuture galaxy, lyman-alpha forest and weak lensing surveys extending to morenon-linear scales will benefit from the improved approximation to thenon-linear matter power spectrum we provide. our approximation reproduces theinduced neutrino suppression over the targeted scales and redshiftssignificantly better. we test its robustness with regard to changingcosmological parameters and a variety of modelling effects.

1112.4334	the statistics of cosmological lyman-alpha absorption	we study the effect of the non-gaussianity induced by gravitational evolutionupon the statistical properties of absorption in quasar (qso) spectra. usingthe generic hierarchical ansatz and the lognormal approximation we derive theanalytical expressions for the one-point pdf as well as for the joint two-pointprobability distribution (2pdf) of transmitted fluxes in two neighbouring qsos.these flux pdfs are constructed in 3d as well as in projection (i.e. in 2d).the pdfs are constructed by relating the lower-order moments, i.e. cumulantsand cumulant correlators, of the fluxes to the 3d neutral hydrogen distributionwhich is, in turn, expressed as a function of the underlying dark matterdistribution. the lower-order moments are next modelled using a generatingfunction formalism in the context of a {\em minimal tree-model} for thehigher-order correlation hierarchy. these different approximations give nearlyidentical results for the range of redshifts probed, and we also find a verygood agreement between our predictions and outputs of hydrodynamicalsimulations. the formalism developed here for the joint statistics offlux-decrements concerning two lines of sight can be extended to multiple linesof sight, which could be particularly important for the 3d reconstruction ofthe cosmic web from qso spectra (e.g. in the boss survey). these statisticsprobe the underlying projected neutral hydrogen field and are thus linked to"hot-spots" of absorption. the results for the pdf and the bias presented hereuse the same functional forms of scaling functions that have previously beenemployed for the modelling of other cosmological observation such as thesunyaev-zel'dovich effect.

(2011). this data-set spans 11,000 square degrees andprobes a volume of $3h^{-3} \rm{gpc}^3$, making it the largest volume ever usedfor galaxy clustering measurements. we present a novel treatment of theobservational systematics and its applications to the clustering signals fromthe data set. in this paper, we measure the angular clustering using an optimalquadratic estimator at 4 redshift slices with an accuracy of ~15% with bin sizeof delta_l = 10 on scales of the baryon acoustic oscillations (bao) (atl~40-400). we derive cosmological constraints using the full-shape of thepower-spectra. for a flat lambda cdm model, when combined with cosmic microwavebackground wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe 7 (wmap7) and h_0 constraintsfrom 600 cepheids observed by hst, we find \omega_\lambda = 0.73 +/- 0.019 andh_0 to be 70.5 +/- 1.6 km/s/mpc. for an open lambda cdm model, when combinedwith wmap7 + hst, we find $\omega_k = 0.0035 +/- 0.0054, improved overwmap7+hst alone by 40%. for a wcdm model, when combined with wmap7+hst+sn, wefind w = -1.071 +/- 0.078, and h_0 to be 71.3 +/- 1.7 km/s/mpc, which iscompetitive with the latest large scale structure constraints from largespectroscopic surveys such as sdss data release 7 (dr7) (reid et al. 2010,percival et al. 2010, montesano et al. 2011) and wigglez (blake et al. 2011).the sdss-iii data release 8 (sdss-iii dr8) angular clustering data allows awide range of investigations into the cosmological model, cosmic expansion (viabao), gaussianity of initial conditions and neutrino masses.

1203.5105	constraints on massive neutrinos from the cfhtls angular power spectrum	we use the galaxy angular power spectrum at $z\sim0.5-1.2$ from thecanada-france-hawaii-telescope legacy survey wide fields (cfhtls-wide) toconstrain separately the total neutrino mass $\sum{m_\nu}$ and the effectivenumber of neutrino species $n_{\rm{eff}}$. this survey has recently benefitedfrom an accurate calibration of the redshift distribution, allowing newmeasurements of the (non-linear) matter power spectrum in a unique range ofscales and redshifts sensitive to neutrino free streaming. our analysis makesuse of a recent model for the effect of neutrinos on the weakly non-linearmatter power spectrum derived from accurate n-body simulations. we show thatcfhtls, combined with wmap7 and a prior on the hubble constant provides anupper limit of $\sum{m_\nu}&lt;0.29\,$ev and $n_{\rm{eff}} =4.17^{+1.62}_{-1.26}$(2$\,\sigma$ confidence levels). if we omit smaller scales which may beaffected by non-linearities, these constraints become $\sum{m_\nu}&lt;0.41\,$evand $n_{\rm{eff}} =3.98^{+2.02}_{-1.20}$ (2$\,\sigma$ confidence levels).finally we show that the addition of other large scale structures probes canfurther improve these constraints, demonstrating that high redshift largevolumes surveys such as cfhtls are complementary to other cosmological probesof the neutrino mass.

1207.6567	the impact of feedback from galaxy formation on the lyman-alpha  transmitted flux	the forest of lyman-alpha absorption lines seen in the spectra of distantquasars has become an important probe of the distribution of matter in theuniverse. we use large, hydrodynamical simulations from the owls project toinvestigate the effect of feedback from galaxy formation on the probabilitydistribution function and the power spectrum of the lyman-alpha transmittedflux. while metal-line cooling is unimportant, both galactic outflows frommassive galaxies driven by active galactic nuclei and winds from low-massgalaxies driven by supernovae have a substantial impact on the flux statistics.at redshift z=2.25, the effects on the flux statistics are of a similarmagnitude as the statistical uncertainties of published data sets. the changesin the flux statistics are not due to differences in the temperature-densityrelation of the photo-ionised gas. instead, they are caused by changes in thedensity distribution and in the fraction of hot, collisionally ionised gas. itmay be possible to disentangle astrophysical and cosmological effects by takingadvantage of the fact that they induce different redshift dependencies. inparticular, the magnitude of the feedback effects appears to decrease rapidlywith increasing redshift. analyses of lyman-alpha forest data from surveys thatare currently in process, such as boss/sdss-iii and x-shooter/vlt, must takegalactic winds into account.

1210.2194	neutrino masses and cosmological parameters from a euclid-like survey:  markov chain monte carlo forecasts including theoretical errors	we present forecasts for the accuracy of determining the parameters of aminimal cosmological model and the total neutrino mass based on combined mockdata for a future euclid-like galaxy survey and planck. we consider twodifferent galaxy surveys: a spectroscopic redshift survey and a cosmic shearsurvey. we make use of the monte carlo markov chains (mcmc) technique andassume two sets of theoretical errors. the first error is meant to account foruncertainties in the modelling of the effect of neutrinos on the non-lineargalaxy power spectrum and we assume this error to be fully correlated infourier space. the second error is meant to parametrize the overall residualuncertainties in modelling the non-linear galaxy power spectrum at smallscales, and is conservatively assumed to be uncorrelated and to increase withthe ratio of a given scale to the scale of non-linearity. it hence increaseswith wavenumber and decreases with redshift. with these two assumptions for theerrors and assuming further conservatively that the uncorrelated error risesabove 2% at k = 0.4 h/mpc and z = 0.5, we find that a future euclid-like cosmicshear/galaxy survey achieves a 1-sigma error on mnu close to 32 mev/25 mev,sufficient for detecting the total neutrino mass with good significance. if theresidual uncorrelated errors indeed rises rapidly towards smaller scales in thenon-linear regime as we have assumed here then the data on non-linear scalesdoes not increase the sensitivity to the total neutrino mass. assuming insteada ten times smaller theoretical error with the same scale dependence, the erroron the total neutrino mass decreases moderately from sigma(mnu) = 18 mev to 14mev when mildly non-linear scales with 0.1 h/mpc &lt; k &lt; 0.6 h/mpc are includedin the analysis of the galaxy survey data.

1211.2616	baryon acoustic oscillations in the ly-\alpha\ forest of boss quasars	we report a detection of the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) feature in thethree-dimensional correlation function of the transmitted flux fraction in the\lya forest of high-redshift quasars. the study uses 48,640 quasars in theredshift range $2.1\le z \le 3.5$ from the baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey (boss) of the third generation of the sloan digital sky survey(sdss-iii). at a mean redshift $z=2.3$, we measure the monopole and quadrupolecomponents of the correlation function for separations in the range$20\hmpc&lt;r&lt;200\hmpc$. a peak in the correlation function is seen at aseparation equal to $(1.01\pm0.03)$ times the distance expected for the baopeak within a concordance $\lambda$cdm cosmology. this first detection of thebao peak at high redshift, when the universe was strongly matter dominated,results in constraints on the angular diameter distance $\da$ and the expansionrate $h$ at $z=2.3$ that, combined with priors on $h_0$ and the baryon density,require the existence of dark energy. combined with constraints derived fromcosmic microwave background (cmb) observations, this result implies$h(z=2.3)=(224\pm8){\rm km\,s^{-1}mpc^{-1}}$, indicating that the timederivative of the cosmological scale parameter $\dot{a}=h(z=2.3)/(1+z)$ issignificantly greater than that measured with bao at $z\sim0.5$. thisdemonstrates that the expansion was decelerating in the range $0.7&lt;z&lt;2.3$, asexpected from the matter domination during this epoch. combined withmeasurements of $h_0$, one sees the pattern of deceleration followed byacceleration characteristic of a dark-energy dominated universe.

1211.3741	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: weighing the neutrino mass using the galaxy power  spectrum of the cmass sample	we measure the sum of the neutrino particle masses using thethree-dimensional galaxy power spectrum of the sdss-iii baryon oscillationspectroscopic survey (boss) data release 9 (dr9) cmass galaxy sample. combinedwith the cosmic microwave background (cmb), supernova (sn) and additionalbaryonic acoustic oscillation (bao) data, we find upper 95 percent confidencelimits of the neutrino mass $\sigma m_{\nu}&lt;0.340$ ev within a flat$\lambda$cdm background, and $\sigma m_{\nu}&lt;0.821$ ev, assuming a more generalbackground cosmological model. the number of neutrino species is measured to be$n_{\rm eff}=4.308\pm0.794$ and $n_{\rm eff}=4.032^{+0.870}_{-0.894}$ for thesetwo cases respectively. we study and quantify the effect of several factors onthe neutrino measurements, including the galaxy power spectrum bias model, theeffect of redshift-space distortion, the cutoff scale of the power spectrum,and the choice of additional data. the impact of neutrinos with unknown masseson other cosmological parameter measurements is investigated. the fractionalmatter density and the hubble parameter are measured to be$\omega_m=0.2796\pm0.0097$, $h_0=69.72^{+0.90}_{-0.91}$ km/s/mpc (flat$\lambda$cdm) and $\omega_m=0.2798^{+0.0132}_{-0.0136}$,$h_0=73.78^{+3.16}_{-3.17}$ km/s/mpc (more general background model). based ona chevallier-polarski-linder (cpl) parametrisation of the equation-of-state $w$of dark energy, we find that $w=-1$ is consistent with observations, evenallowing for neutrinos. similarly, the curvature \omega_k and the running ofthe spectral index $\alpha_s$ are both consistent with zero. thetensor-to-scaler ratio is constrained down to $r&lt;0.198$ (95 percent cl, flat$\lambda$ cdm) and $r&lt;0.440$ (95 percent cl, more general background model).

1211.5146	the boss lyman-alpha forest sample from sdss data release 9	we present the boss lyman-alpha (lya) forest sample from sdss data release 9,comprising 54,468 quasar spectra with zqso &gt; 2.15 suitable for lya forestanalysis. this data set probes the intergalactic medium with absorptionredshifts 2.0 &lt; z_alpha &lt; 5.7 over an area of 3275 square degrees, andencompasses an approximate comoving volume of 20 h^-3 gpc^3. with eachspectrum, we have included several products designed to aid in lya forestanalysis: improved sky masks that flag pixels where data may be unreliable,corrections for known biases in the pipeline estimated noise, masks for thecores of damped lya systems and corrections for their wings, and estimates ofthe unabsorbed continua so that the observed flux can be converted to afractional transmission. the continua are derived using a principal componentfit to the quasar spectrum redwards of restframe lya (lambda &gt; 1216 ang),extrapolated into the forest region and normalized by a linear function to fitthe expected evolution of the lya forest mean-flux. the estimated continuumerrors are ~5% rms. we also discuss possible systematics arising from uncertainspectrophotometry and artifacts in the flux calibration; global corrections forthe latter are provided. our sample provides a convenient starting point forusers to analyze clustering in boss lya forest data, and it provides a fiducialdata set that can be used to compare results from different analyses of baryonacoustic oscillations in the lya forest. the full data set is available fromthe sdss-iii dr9 web site.

1212.4855	non-linear evolution of the cosmic neutrino background	we investigate the non-linear evolution of the relic cosmic neutrinobackground by running large box-size, high resolution n-body simulations. ourset of simulations explore the properties of neutrinos in a reference$\lambda$cdm model with total neutrino masses between 0.05-0.60 ev in cold darkmatter haloes of mass $10^{11}-10^{15}$ $h^{-1}$m$_{\odot}$, over a redshiftrange $z=0-2$. we compute the halo mass function and show that it is reasonablywell fitted by the sheth-tormen formula. more importantly, we focus on the cdmand neutrino properties of the density and peculiar velocity fields in thecosmological volume, inside and in the outskirts of virialized haloes. thedynamical state of the neutrino particles depends strongly on their momentum:whereas neutrinos in the low velocity tail behave similarly to cdm particles,neutrinos in the high velocity tail are not affected by the clustering of theunderlying cdm component. we find that the neutrino (linear) unperturbedmomentum distribution is modified and mass and redshift dependent deviationsfrom the expected fermi-dirac distribution are in place both in thecosmological volume and inside haloes. the neutrino density profiles aroundvirialized haloes have been carefully investigated and a simple fitting formulais provided. the neutrino profile, unlike the cold dark matter one, is found tobe cored with core size and central density that depend on the neutrino mass,redshift and mass of the halo, for halos of masses larger than $\sim10^{13.5}h^{-1}$m$_{\odot}$. for lower masses the neutrino profile is bestfitted by a simple power-law relation in the range probed by the simulations.our findings are particularly important in view of upcoming large-scalestructure surveys, like euclid, that are expected to probe the non-linearregime at the percent level with lensing and clustering observations.

1301.3459	measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations in the lyman-alpha forest  fluctuations in boss data release 9	we use the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) data release 9(dr9) to detect and measure the position of the baryonic acoustic oscillation(bao) feature in the three-dimensional correlation function in the lyman-alphaforest flux fluctuations at a redshift z=2.4. the feature is clearly detectedat significance between 3 and 5 sigma (depending on the broadband model andmethod of error covariance matrix estimation) and is consistent withpredictions of the standard lcdm model. we assess the biases in our method,stability of the error covariance matrix and possible systematic effects. wefit the resulting correlation function with several models that decouple thebroadband and acoustic scale information. for an isotropic dilation factor, wemeasure 100x(alpha_iso-1) = -1.6 ^{+2.0+4.3+7.4}_{-2.0-4.1-6.8} (stat.) +/- 1.0(syst.) (multiple statistical errors denote 1,2 and 3 sigma confidence limits)with respect to the acoustic scale in the fiducial cosmological model (flatlcdm with omega_m=0.27, h=0.7). when fitting separately for the radial andtransversal dilation factors we find marginalised constraints 100x(alpha_par-1)= -1.3 ^{+3.5+7.6 +12.3}_{-3.3-6.7-10.2} (stat.) +/- 2.0 (syst.) and100x(alpha_perp-1) = -2.2 ^{+7.4+17}_{-7.1-15} +/- 3.0 (syst.). the dilationfactor measurements are significantly correlated with cross-correlationcoefficient of ~ -0.55. errors become significantly non-gaussian for deviationsover 3 standard deviations from best fit value. because of the data cuts andanalysis method, these measurements give tighter constraints than a previousbao analysis of the boss dr9 lyman-alpha forest sample, providing an importantconsistency test of the standard cosmological model in a new redshift regime.

0801.1105	on the importance of high redshift intergalactic voids	we investigate the properties of one--dimensional flux ``voids'' (connectedregions in the flux distribution above the mean flux level) by comparinghydrodynamical simulations of large cosmological volumes with a set of observedhigh--resolution spectra at z ~ 2. after addressing the effects of box size andresolution, we study how the void distribution changes when the mostsignificant cosmological and astrophysical parameters are varied. we find thatthe void distribution in the flux is in excellent agreement with predictions ofthe standard lcdm cosmology, which also fits other flux statistics remarkablywell. we then model the relation between flux voids and the correspondingone--dimensional gas density field along the line--of--sight and make apreliminary attempt to connect the one--dimensional properties of the gasdensity field to the three--dimensional dark matter distribution at the sameredshift. this provides a framework that allows statistical interpretations ofthe void population at high redshift using observed quasar spectra, andeventually it will enable linking the void properties of the high--redshiftuniverse with those at lower redshifts, which are better known.

1306.5896	the one-dimensional ly-alpha forest power spectrum from boss	we have developed two independent methods to measure the one-dimensionalpower spectrum of the transmitted flux in the lyman-$\alpha$ forest. the firstmethod is based on a fourier transform, and the second on a maximum likelihoodestimator. the two methods are independent and have different systematicuncertainties. the determination of the noise level in the data spectra wassubject to a novel treatment, because of its significant impact on the derivedpower spectrum.  we applied the two methods to 13,821 quasar spectra from sdss-iii/boss dr9selected from a larger sample of over 60,000 spectra on the basis of their highquality, large signal-to-noise ratio, and good spectral resolution. the powerspectra measured using either approach are in good agreement over all twelveredshift bins from $&lt;z&gt; = 2.2$ to $&lt;z&gt; = 4.4$, and scales from 0.001$\rm(km/s)^{-1}$ to $0.02 \rm(km/s)^{-1}$. we determine the methodological andinstrumental systematic uncertainties of our measurements.  we provide a preliminary cosmological interpretation of our measurementsusing available hydrodynamical simulations. the improvement in precision overpreviously published results from sdss is a factor 2--3 for constraints onrelevant cosmological parameters. for a $\lambda$cdm model and using aconstraint on $h_0$ that encompasses measurements based on the local distanceladder and on cmb anisotropies, we infer $\sigma_8 =0.83\pm0.03$ and $n_s=0.97\pm0.02$ based on \ion{h}{i} absorption in the range $2.1&lt;z&lt;3.7$.

1308.4411	a consistent determination of the temperature of the intergalactic  medium at redshift z=2.4	we present new measurements of the thermal state of the intergalactic medium(igm) at $z\sim2.4$ derived from absorption line profiles in the ly$\alpha$forest. we use a large set of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations tocalibrate the relationship between the temperature-density ($t$--$\delta$)relation in the igm and the distribution of hi column densities, $n_{\rm hi}$,and velocity widths, $b_{\rm hi}$, of discrete ly$\alpha$ forest absorbers.this calibration is then applied to the measurement of the lower cut-off of the$b_{\rm hi}$--$n_{\rm hi}$ distribution recently presented by rudie et al.(2012). we infer a power-law $t$--$\delta$ relation,$t=t_{0}\delta^{\gamma-1}$, with a temperature at mean density,$t_{0}=[1.00^{+0.32}_{-0.21}]\times10^{4}\rm\,k$ and slope$(\gamma-1)=0.54\pm0.11$. the slope is fully consistent with that advocated bythe analysis of rudie et al (2012); however, the temperature at mean density islower by almost a factor of two, primarily due to an adjustment in therelationship between column density and physical density assumed by theseauthors. these new results are in excellent agreement with the recenttemperature measurements of becker et al.

1311.0866	cosmology with massive neutrinos i: towards a realistic modeling of the  relation between matter, haloes and galaxies	by using a suite of large box-size n-body simulations that incorporatemassive neutrinos as an extra set of particles, we investigate the impact ofneutrino masses on the spatial distribution of dark matter haloes and galaxies.we compute the bias between the spatial distribution of dark matter haloes andthe overall matter and cold dark matter distributions using statistical toolssuch as the power spectrum and the two-point correlation function. overall wefind a scale-dependent bias on large scales for the cosmologies with massiveneutrinos. however, our results indicate that the scale-dependence in the biasis reduced if the latter is computed with respect to the cold dark matterdistribution only. we find that the value of the bias on large scales isreasonably well reproduced by the tinker fitting formula once the linear colddark matter power spectrum is used, instead of the total matter power spectrum.we investigate whether scale-dependent bias really comes from purely neutrino'seffect or from nonlinear gravitational collapse of haloes. for this purpose, weaddress the $\omega_\nu$-$\sigma_8$ degeneracy and find that such degeneracy isnot perfect, implying that neutrinos imprint a slight scale dependence on thelarge-scale bias. finally, by using a simple halo occupation distribution (hod)model, we investigate the impact of massive neutrinos on the distribution ofgalaxies within dark matter haloes. we use the main galaxy sample in the sloandigital sky survey ii data release 7 to investigate if the small-scale galaxyclustering alone can be used to discriminate among different cosmologicalmodels with different neutrino masses. our results suggest that differentchoices of the hod parameters can reproduce the observational measurementsrelatively well, and we quantify the difference between the values of the hodparameters between massless and massive neutrino cosmologies.

1311.1514	cosmology with massive neutrinos iii: the halo mass function and an  application to galaxy clusters	we use a suite of n-body simulations that incorporate massive neutrinos as anextra-set of particles to investigate their effect on the halo mass function.we show that for cosmologies with massive neutrinos the mass function of darkmatter haloes selected using the spherical overdensity (so) criterion is wellreproduced by the fitting formula of tinker et al. (2008) once the cold darkmatter power spectrum is considered instead of the total matter power, as it isusually done. the differences between the two implementations, i.e. using$p_{\rm cdm}(k)$ instead of $p_{\rm m}(k)$, are more pronounced for largevalues of the neutrino masses and in the high end of the halo mass function: inparticular, the number of massive haloes is higher when $p_{\rm cdm}(k)$ isconsidered rather than $p_{\rm m}(k)$. as a quantitative application of ourfindings we consider a planck-like sz-clusters survey and show that thedifferences in predicted number counts can be as large as $30\%$ for $\summ_\nu = 0.4$ ev. finally, we use the planck-sz clusters sample, with anapproximate likelihood calculation, to derive planck-like constraints oncosmological parameters. we find that, in a massive neutrino cosmology, ourcorrection to the halo mass function produces a shift in the$\sigma_8(\omega_{\rm m}/0.27)^\gamma$ relation which can be quantified as$\delta \gamma \sim 0.05$ and $\delta \gamma \sim 0.14$ assuming one($n_\nu=1$) or three ($n_\nu=3$) degenerate massive neutrino, respectively. theshift results in a lower mean value of $\sigma_8$ with $\delta \sigma_8 = 0.01$for $n_\nu=1$ and $\delta \sigma_8 = 0.02$ for $n_\nu=3$, respectively. suchdifference, in a cosmology with massive neutrinos, would increase the tensionbetween cluster abundance and planck cmb measurements.

1311.2588	cosmic degeneracies i: joint n-body simulations of modified gravity and  massive neutrinos	we present the first suite of cosmological n-body simulations thatsimultaneously include the effects of two different and theoreticallyindependent extensions of the standard $\lambda$cdm cosmological scenario -namely an $f(r)$ theory of modified gravity (mg) and a cosmological backgroundof massive neutrinos - with the aim to investigate their possible observationaldegeneracies. we focus on three basic statistics of the large-scale matterdistribution, more specifically the nonlinear matter power spectrum, the halomass function, and the halo bias, for which we determine the deviation withrespect to the fiducial $\lambda$cdm cosmology in the context of both separateand combined simulations of $f(r)$ mg and massive neutrinos scenarios. ourresults show that while these two extended models separately determine veryprominent and potentially detectable features in all the three statistics, whenwe allow them to be simultaneously at work these features are stronglysuppressed, resulting in much weaker deviations from the standard model'spredictions. in particular, when an $f(r)$ gravity model with $f_{r0}=-1\times10^{-4}$ is combined with a total neutrino mass of $\sigma _{i}m_{\nu_{i}}=0.4$ ev, the resulting matter power spectrum, halo mass function, andbias at z=0 are found to be consistent with the standard model's predictions atthe 10%, 20%, and 5% accuracy levels, respectively. therefore, our resultsimply an intrinsic theoretical limit to the effective discriminating power ofpresent and future observational data sets with respect to these widelyconsidered extensions of the standard cosmological scenario in the absence ofindependent measurements of the neutrino masses from laboratory experiments,even though the high-redshift evolution might still allow to partially breakthe degeneracy [abridged].

1311.5223	lyman-{\alpha} forest and cosmic weak lensing in a warm dark matter  universe	we review the current state of the theory of large scale structure in a warmdark matter (wdm) cosmological model. in particular, we focus on the non-linearmodelling of the matter power spectrum and on the mass function of dark matterhaloes. we describe the results of n-body simulations with wdm and mention theeffects that could be induced by baryonic physics. we also examine the halomodel of large scale structure and its recently suggested modifications for awdm cosmology, which account for the small scale smoothness of the initialmatter density field and better fit the results of n-body simulations. havingdescribed the theoretical models, we discuss the current lower limits on thewdm particle mass, m_w, which correspond to upper limits on the wdm temperatureunder the assumption that the particles are thermal relics. the best suchconstraints come from the ly{\alpha} forest and exclude all masses below 3.3kev at the 2{\sigma} confidence level. we finally review the forecasts forfuture lensing surveys, which will be of the same order of magnitude as thealready existing constraints from the ly{\alpha} forest data but explore adifferent redshift regime.

1312.5310	simulated star formation rate functions at z~4-7, and the role of  feedback in high-z galaxies	we study the role of feedback from supernovae and black holes in theevolution of the star formation rate function (sfrf) of z~4-7 galaxies. we usea new set of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, angus (australian gadget-3early universe simulations), run with a modified and improved version of theparallel treepm-smoothed particle hydrodynamics code gadget-3 calledp-gadget3(xxl), that includes a self-consistent implementation of stellarevolution and metal enrichment. in our simulations both supernova (sn) drivengalactic winds and active galactic nuclei (agn) act simultaneously in a complexinterplay. the sfrf is insensitive to feedback prescription at z&gt;5, meaningthat it cannot be used to discriminate between feedback models duringreionisation. however, the sfrf is sensitive to the details of feedbackprescription at lower redshift. by exploring different sn driven windvelocities and regimes for the agn feedback, we find that the key factor forreproducing the observed sfrfs is a combination of "strong" sn winds and earlyagn feedback in low mass galaxies. conversely, we show that the choice ofinitial mass function and inclusion of metal cooling have less impact on theevolution of the sfrf. when variable winds are considered, we find that anon-aggressive wind scaling is needed to reproduce the sfrfs at z&gt;4. otherwise,the amount of objects with low sfrs is greatly suppressed and at the same timewinds are not effective enough in the most massive systems.

1401.6464	suite of hydrodynamical simulations for the lyman-alpha forest with  massive neutrinos	the signature left in quasar spectra by the presence of neutral hydrogen inthe universe allows one to constrain the sum of the neutrino masses withimproved sensitivity, with respect to laboratory experiments, and may shed anew light on the neutrino mass hierarchy and on the absolute mass scale ofneutrinos. constraints on cosmological parameters and on the dark energyequation of state can also be derived, from a joint parameter estimationprocedure. however, this requires a detailed modeling of the line-of-sightpower spectrum of the transmitted flux in the lyman-alpha (lya) forest onscales ranging from a few to hundreds of mpcs, which in turns demands theinclusion and careful treatment of cosmological neutrinos. to this end, wepresent here a suite of state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations with colddark matter, baryons and massive neutrinos, specifically targeted for modelingthe low-density regions of the igm as probed by the lya forest athigh-redshift. the simulations span volumes ranging from (25 mpc/h)^3 to (100mpc/h)^3, and are made using either 3 x 192^3~21 millions or 3 x 768^3~1.4billion particles. the resolution of the various runs can be further enhanced,so that we can reach the equivalent of 3 x 3072^3~87 billion particles in a(100 mpc/h)^3 box size. the chosen cosmological parameters are compatible withthe latest planck (2013) results, although we also explore the effect of slightvariations in the main cosmological and astrophysical parameters. we adopt aparticle-type implementation of massive neutrinos, and consider threedegenerate species having masses m_nu =0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.8 ev,respectively. we improve on previous studies in several ways, in particularwith updated routines for igm radiative cooling and heating processes, andinitial conditions based on 2lpt rather than the zeldovich approximation.

1405.1072	igm constraints from the sdss-iii/boss dr9 ly-alpha forest flux  probability distribution function	the ly$\alpha$ forest transmission probability distribution function (pdf) isan established probe of the intergalactic medium (igm) astrophysics, especiallythe temperature-density relationship of the igm. we measure the transmissionpdf from 3393 baryon oscillations spectroscopic survey (boss) quasars from sdssdata release 9, and compare with mock spectra that include careful modeling ofthe noise, continuum, and astrophysical uncertainties. the boss transmissionpdfs, measured at $\langle z \rangle = [2.3,2.6,3.0]$, are compared with pdfscreated from mock spectra drawn from a suite of hydrodynamical simulations thatsample the igm temperature-density relationship, $\gamma$, and temperature atmean-density, $t_0$, where $t(\delta) = t_0 \delta^{\gamma-1}$. we find that asignificant population of partial lyman-limit systems with a column-densitydistribution slope of $\beta_\mathrm{plls} \sim -2$ are required to explain thedata at the low-transmission end of transmission pdf, while uncertainties inthe mean ly$\alpha$ forest transmission affect the high-transmission end. aftermodelling the llss and marginalizing over mean-transmission uncertainties, wefind that $\gamma=1.6$ best describes the data over our entire redshift range,although constraints on $t_0$ are affected by systematic uncertainties. withinour model framework, isothermal or inverted temperature-density relationships($\gamma \leq 1$) are disfavored at a significance of over 4$\sigma$, althoughthis could be somewhat weakened by cosmological and astrophysical uncertaintiesthat we did not model.

1405.6713	modeling the neutral hydrogen distribution in the post-reionization  universe: intensity mapping	we model the distribution of neutral hydrogen (hi) in the post-reionizationera and investigate its detectability in 21 cm intensity mapping with thefuture ska radio telescope. we rely on high resolution hydrodynamical n-bodysimulations. the hi is assigned a-posteriori to the gas particles following twodifferent approaches: a halo-based method in which hi is assigned only to gasparticles residing within dark matter halos; a particle-based method thatassigns hi to all gas particles using a prescription based on the physicalproperties of the particles. the hi statistical properties are then compared tothe observational properties of damped lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers (dlas) and oflower column density systems and reasonable good agreement is found for all thecases. among the halo-based method, we further consider two different schemesthat aim at reproducing the observed properties of dlas by distributing hiinside halos: one of this results in a much higher bias for dlas, in agreementwith recent observations, which boosts the 21 cm power spectrum by a factor$\sim 4$ with respect to the other recipe. we compute the 21 cm power spectrumfrom the simulated hi distribution and calculate the expected signal for bothska1-mid and ska1-low configurations at $2.4 \leq z \leq 4$. we find that skawill be able to detect the 21 cm power spectrum, in the non-linear regime, upto $k\sim 1\,h$/mpc for ska1-mid and $k\sim 5\,h$/mpc for ska1-low with 100hours of observations. we also investigate the perspective of imaging the hidistribution. our findings indicate that ska1-low could detect the most massivehi peaks with a signal to noise ratio (snr) higher than 5 for an observationtime of about 1000 hours at $z=4$, for a synthesized beam width of $2'$.detection at redshifts $z\geqslant2.4$ with ska1-mid would instead require amuch longer observation time to achieve a comparable snr level.

1407.1342	a coarse grained perturbation theory for the large scale structure, with  cosmology and time independence in the uv	standard cosmological perturbation theory (spt) for the large scale structure(lss) of the universe fails at small scales (uv) due to strong nonlinearitiesand to multistreaming effects. in pietroni et al. 2011 a new framework wasproposed in which the large scales (ir) are treated perturbatively while theinformation on the uv, mainly small scale velocity dispersion, is obtained bynonlinear methods like n-body simulations. here we develop this approach,showing that it is possible to reproduce the fully nonlinear power spectrum(ps) by combining a simple (and fast) 1-loop computation for the ir scales andthe measurement of a single, dominant, correlator from n-body simulations forthe uv ones. we measure this correlator for a suite of seven differentcosmologies, and we show that its inclusion in our perturbation schemereproduces the fully non-linear ps with percent level accuracy, for wavenumbers up to $k\sim 0.4\, h~{\rm mpc^{-1}}$ down to $z=0$. we then show that,once this correlator has been measured in a given cosmology, there is no needto run a new simulation for a different cosmology in the suite. indeed, byrescaling this correlator by a proper function computable in spt, thereconstruction procedure works also for the other cosmologies and for allredshifts, with comparable accuracy. finally, we clarify the relation of thisapproach to the effective field theory methods recently proposed in the lsscontext.

1409.6309	semi-analytic galaxy formation in massive neutrino cosmologies	the constraints on neutrino masses led to the revision of their cosmologicalrole, since the existence of a cosmological neutrino background is a clearprediction of the standard cosmological model. in this paper, we study theimpact of such background on the spatial distribution of both dark matter (dm)and galaxies, by coupling $n$-body numerical simulations with semi-analyticmodels (sams) of galaxy formation. cosmological simulations including massiveneutrinos predict a slower evolution of dm perturbations with respect to the$\lambda$cdm runs with the same initial conditions and a suppression on thematter power spectrum on small and intermediate scales, thus impacting on thepredicted properties of galaxy populations. we explicitly show that most ofthese deviations are driven by the different $\sigma_8$ predicted forcosmologies including a massive neutrino background. we conclude thatindependent estimates of $\sigma_8$ are needed, in order to unambiguouslycharacterise the effect of this background on the growth of structures. galaxyproperties alone are a weak tracer of deviations with respect to the$\lambda$cdm run, but their combination with the overall matter distribution atall scales allows to disentangle between different cosmological models.moreover, these deviations go on opposite direction with respect to competingmodels like modified gravity, thus weakening any detectable cosmologicalsignal. given the ubiquitous presence of a neutrino background, these effectshave to be taken into account in future missions aimed at constraining theproperties of the "dark" components of the universe.

1409.6321	the lyman-beta forest as a cosmic thermometer	we present a comprehensive analysis of high resolution hydrodynamicsimulations in terms of lyman-alpha and lyman-beta one dimensional flux powerspectra ($p_{\alpha\alpha}$ and $p_{\beta\beta}$). in particular, we focus onthe behaviour that the flux auto-power spectra and cross-power spectra($p_{\alpha\beta}$) display when the intergalactic medium (igm) thermal historyis changed in a range of values that bracket a reference model, whilecosmological parameters are kept fixed to best fit the cosmic microwavebackground data. we present empirical fits that describe at the sub-percentlevel the dependence of the power spectra on the thermal parameters. at thelargest scales, the power spectra show a constant bias between each other thatis set by the parameters describing the igm thermal state. the cross-powerspectrum has an oscillatory pattern and crosses zero at a scale which dependson $t_0$, the igm temperature at the mean density, for reasonable values of thepower-law index $\gamma$ of the igm temperature-density relation($t=t_0(1+\delta)^{\gamma-1}$). by performing a fisher matrix analysis, we findthat the power spectrum $p_{\beta\beta}$ is more sensitive to the thermalhistory than $p_{\alpha\alpha}$ alone, due to the fact that it probes denserregions than lyman-alpha. when we combine the power and cross spectra theconstraints on $\gamma$ can be improved by a factor $\sim 4$, while theconstraints on $t_0$ improve by a factor of $\sim 2$. we address the role ofsignal-to-noise and resolution by mocking realistic observations and weconclude that the framework presented in this work can significantly improvethe knowledge of the igm thermal state, which will in turn guarantee betterconstraints on igm-derived cosmological parameters.

1409.6718	the first billion years of a warm dark matter universe	we present results of cosmological n-body hydrodynamic chemistry simulationsof primordial structure growth and evolution in a scenario with warm darkmatter (wdm) having a mass of 3 kev (thermal relic) and compare with a modelconsisting of standard cold dark matter (cdm). we focus on the high-redshiftuniverse ($z&gt;6$), where the structure formation process should better reflectthe primordial (linear) differences in terms of matter power spectrum. we findthat early epochs can be exceptional probes of the dark-matter nature.non-linear wdm power spectra and mass functions are up to 2 dex lower than incdm and show spreads of factor of a few persisting in the whole first gyr.runaway molecular cooling in wdm haloes results severely inhibited because ofthe damping of power at large $k$ modes and hence cosmic (population iii andii-i) star formation rate (sfr) is usually suppressed with respect to cdmpredictions. luminous objects formed in a wdm background are very rare at$z&gt;10$, due to the sparser and retarded evolution of early wdm mini-haloesduring the dark ages and their lack can be fitted with a simple analyticalformula depending only on magnitude and redshift. future high-$z$ observationsof faint galaxies have the potential to discriminate between cdm and wdmscenarios by means of cosmic stellar mass density (smd) and specific sfr, aswell. when compared to the effects of alternative cosmologies (e.g.non-gaussian or dark-energy models) or of high-order corrections at large $z$(e.g. primordial streaming motions or changes in the pristine imf) the onescaused by wdm are definitely more dramatic.

1410.7244	constraint on neutrino masses from sdss-iii/boss ly$\alpha$ forest and  other cosmological probes	we present constraints on the parameters of the $\lambda$cdm cosmologicalmodel in the presence of massive neutrinos, using the one-dimensionally$\alpha$ forest power spectrum obtained with the baryon oscillationspectroscopic survey (boss) of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) bypalanque-delabrouille et al. (2013), complemented by additional cosmologicalprobes. the interpretation of the measured ly$\alpha$ spectrum is done using asecond-order taylor expansion of the simulated power spectrum. boss  ly$\alpha$ data alone provide better bounds than previous ly$\alpha$ results,but are still poorly constraining, especially for the sum of neutrino masses$\sum m_\nu$, for which we obtain an upper bound of 1.1~ev (95\% cl), includingsystematics for both data and simulations. ly$\alpha$ constraints on$\lambda$cdm parameters and neutrino masses are compatible with cmb bounds fromthe planck collaboration. interestingly, the combination of ly$\alpha$ with cmbdata reduces the uncertainties significantly, due to very different directionsof degeneracy in parameter space, leading to the strongest cosmological boundto date on the total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.15$~ev at 95\% cl (with abest-fit in zero). adding recent bao results further tightens this constraintto $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.14$~ev at 95\% cl. this bound is nearly independent of thestatistical approach used, and of the different combinations of cmb and baodata sets considered in this paper in addition to ly$\alpha$. given themeasured values of the two squared mass differences $\delta m^2$, this resulttends to favor the normal hierarchy scenario against the inverted hierarchyscenario for the masses of the active neutrino species.

1410.7393	cross-correlating 21cm intensity maps with lyman break galaxies in the  post-reionization era	we investigate the cross-correlation between the spatial distribution oflyman break galaxies (lbgs) and the 21cm intensity mapping signal at$z\sim[3-5]$. at these redshifts, galactic feedback is supposed to onlymarginally affect the matter power spectrum, and the neutral hydrogendistribution is independently constrained by quasar spectra. using a highresolution n-body simulation, populated with neutral hydrogen a posteriori, weforecast for the expected lbg-21cm cross-spectrum and its error for a 21cmfield observed by the square kilometre array (ska1-low and ska1-mid), combinedwith a spectroscopic lbg survey with the same volume. the cross power can bedetected with a signal-to-noise ratio (snr) up to ~10 times higher (and down to~4 times smaller scales) than the 21cm auto-spectrum for this set-up, with thesnr depending only very weakly on redshift and the lbg population. we also showthat while both the 21cm auto- and lbg-21cm cross-spectra can be reliablyrecovered after the cleaning of smooth-spectrum foreground contamination, onlythe cross-power is robust to problematic non-smooth foregrounds like polarizedsynchrotron emission.

1411.1409	galactic outflow and diffuse gas properties at z&gt;=1 using different  baryonic feedback models	we measure and quantify properties of galactic outflows and diffuse gas at $z\geq 1$ in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. our novel sub-resolutionmodel, muppi, implements supernova feedback using fully local gas properties,where the wind velocity and mass loading are not given as input. we find thefollowing trends at $z = 2$ by analysing central galaxies having a stellar masshigher than $10^{9} m_{\odot}$. the outflow velocity and mass outflow rate($\dot{m}_{\rm out}$) exhibit positive correlations with galaxy mass and withthe star formation rate (sfr). however, most of the relations present a largescatter. the outflow mass loading factor ($\eta$) is between $0.2 - 10$. thecomparison effective model generates a constant outflow velocity, and anegative correlation of $\eta$ with halo mass. the number fraction of galaxieswhere outflow is detected decreases at lower redshifts, but remains more than$80 \%$ over $z = 1 - 5$. high sf activity at $z \sim 2 - 4$ drives strongoutflows, causing the positive and steep correlations of velocity and$\dot{m}_{\rm out}$ with sfr. the outflow velocity correlation with sfr becomesflatter at $z = 1$, and $\eta$ displays a negative correlation with halo massin massive galaxies. our study demonstrates that both the muppi and effectivemodels produce significant outflows at $\sim 1 / 10$ of the virial radius; atthe same time shows that the properties of outflows generated can be differentfrom the input speed and mass loading in the effective model. our muppi model,using local properties of gas in the sub-resolution recipe, is able to developgalactic outflows whose properties correlate with global galaxy properties, andconsistent with observations.

1501.03821	measuring redshift-space distortions with future ska surveys	the peculiar motion of galaxies can be a particularly sensitive probe ofgravitational collapse. as such, it can be used to measure the dynamics of darkmatter and dark energy as well the nature of the gravitational laws at play oncosmological scales. peculiar motions manifest themselves as an overallanisotropy in the measured clustering signal as a function of the angle to theline-of-sight, known as redshift-space distortion (rsd). limiting factors inthis measurement include our ability to model non-linear galaxy motions onsmall scales and the complexities of galaxy bias. the anisotropy in themeasured clustering pattern in redshift-space is also driven by the unknowndistance factors at the redshift in question, the alcock-paczynski distortion.this weakens growth rate measurements, but permits an extra geometric probe ofthe hubble expansion rate. in this chapter we will briefly describe thescientific background to the rsd technique, and forecast the potential of theska phase 1 and the ska2 to measure the growth rate using both galaxycatalogues and intensity mapping, assessing their competitiveness with currentand future optical galaxy surveys.

1501.03989	cosmology with a ska hi intensity mapping survey	hi intensity mapping (im) is a novel technique capable of mapping thelarge-scale structure of the universe in three dimensions and deliveringexquisite constraints on cosmology, by using hi as a biased tracer of the darkmatter density field. this is achieved by measuring the intensity of theredshifted 21cm line over the sky in a range of redshifts without therequirement to resolve individual galaxies. in this chapter, we investigate thepotential of ska1 to deliver hi intensity maps over a broad range offrequencies and a substantial fraction of the sky. by pinning down the baryonacoustic oscillation and redshift space distortion features in the matter powerspectrum -- thus determining the expansion and growth history of the universe-- these surveys can provide powerful tests of dark energy models andmodifications to general relativity. they can also be used to probe physics onextremely large scales, where precise measurements of spatial curvature andprimordial non-gaussianity can be used to test inflation; on small scales, bymeasuring the sum of neutrino masses; and at high redshifts where non-standardevolution models can be probed. we discuss the impact of foregrounds as well asvarious instrumental and survey design parameters on the achievableconstraints. in particular we analyse the feasibility of using the ska1autocorrelations to probe the large-scale signal.

1502.06961	warm dark matter signatures on the 21cm power spectrum: intensity  mapping forecasts for ska	we investigate the impact that warm dark matter (wdm) has in terms of 21cmintensity mapping in the post-reionization universe at z = 3 - 5. we performhydrodynamic simulations for 5 different models: cold dark matter and wdm with1,2,3,4 kev (thermal relic) mass and assign the neutral hydrogen a-posterioriusing two different methods that both reproduce observations in terms of columndensity distribution function of neutral hydrogen systems. contrary to naiveexpectations, the suppression of power present in the linear and non-linearmatter power spectra, results in an increase of power in terms of neutralhydrogen and 21cm power spectra. this is due to the fact that there is a lackof small mass halos in wdm models with respect to cold dark matter: in order todistribute a total amount of neutral hydrogen within the two cosmologicalmodels, a larger quantity has to be placed in the most massive halos, that aremore biased compared to the cold dark matter cosmology. we quantify this effectand address significance for the telescope ska1-low, including a realisticnoise modeling. the results indicate that we will be able to rule out a 4 kevwdm model with 5000 hours of observations at z &gt; 3, with a statisticalsignificance of &gt; 3 sigma, while a smaller mass of 3 kev, comparable to presentday constraints, can be ruled out at more than 2 sigma confidence level with1000 hours of observations at z &gt; 5.

1503.05918	tomography of the fermi-lat gamma-ray diffuse extragalactic signal via  cross-correlations with galaxy catalogs	building on our previous cross-correlation analysis (xia et al. 2011) betweenthe isotropic gamma-ray background (igrb) and different tracers of thelarge-scale structure of the universe, we update our results using 60-months ofdata from the large area telescope (lat) on board the fermi gamma-ray spacetelescope. we perform a cross-correlation analysis between the igrb and objectsthat may trace the astrophysical sources of the igrb: sdss-dr6 qsos, thesdss-dr8 main galaxy sample, luminous red galaxies (lrgs) in the sdss catalog,2mass galaxies, and radio nvss galaxies. the benefit of correlating thefermi-lat signal with catalogs of objects at various redshifts is to providetomographic information on the igrb which is crucial to separate the variouscontributions and to clarify its origin. we observe a significant (&gt;3.5 sigma)cross-correlation signal on angular scales smaller than 1 deg in the nvss,2mass and qso cases and, at lower statistical significance (~3.0 sigma), withsdss galaxies. these results are robust against the choice of the statisticalestimator, estimate of errors, map cleaning procedure and instrumental effects.finally, we test the hypothesis that the igrb observed by fermi-lat originatesfrom the summed contributions of three types of unresolved extragalacticsources: bl lacs, fsrqs and star-forming galaxies (sfgs). we find that a modelin which the igrb is mainly produced by sfgs ($72^{+23}_{-37}$% with 2 sigmaerrors), with bl lacs and fsrqs giving a minor contribution, provides a goodfit to the data. we also consider a possible contribution from misalignedactive galactic nuclei, and we find that, depending on the details of the modeland its uncertainty, they can also provide a substantial contribution, partlydegenerate with the sfg one.

1503.05922	particle dark matter searches outside the local group	if dark matter (dm) is composed by particles which are non-gravitationallycoupled to ordinary matter, their annihilations or decays in cosmic structurescan result in detectable radiation. we show that the most powerful technique todetect a particle dm signal outside the local group is to study the angularcross-correlation of non-gravitational signals with low-redshift gravitationalprobes. this method allows to enhance signal-to-noise from the regions of theuniverse where the dm-induced emission is preferentially generated. wedemonstrate the power of this approach by focusing on gev-tev dm and on therecent cross-correlation analysis between the 2mass galaxy catalogue and thefermi-lat gamma-ray maps. we show that this technique is more sensitive thanother extragalactic gamma-ray probes, such as the energy spectrum and angularautocorrelation of the extragalactic background, and emission from clusters ofgalaxies. intriguingly, we find that the measured cross-correlation can be wellfitted by a dm component, with thermal annihilation cross section and massbetween 10 and 100 gev, depending on the small-scale dm properties andgamma-ray production mechanism. this solicits further data collection anddedicated analyses.

1504.04088	large-scale clustering of lyman-alpha emission intensity from sdss/boss	(abridged) we detect the large-scale structure of lya emission in theuniverse at redshifts z=2-3.5 by measuring the cross-correlation of lya surfacebrightness with quasars in sdss/boss. we use a million spectra targetingluminous red galaxies at z&lt;0.8, after subtracting a best fit model galaxyspectrum from each one, as an estimate of the high-redshift lya surfacebrightness. the quasar-lya emission cross-correlation we detect has a shapeconsistent with a lambdacdm model with omega_m =0.30^+0.10-0.07. the predictedamplitude of this cross-correlation is proportional to the product of the meanlya surface brightness, &lt;mu_alpha&gt;, the amplitude of mass fluctuations, and thequasar and lya emission bias factors. using known values, we infer&lt;mu_alpha&gt;(b_alpha/3) = (3.9 +/- 0.9) x 10^-21 erg/s cm^-2 a^-1 arcsec^-2,where b_alpha is the lya emission bias factor. if the dominant sources of lyaemission are star forming galaxies, we infer rho_sfr = (0.28 +/- 0.07)(3/b_alpha) /yr/mpc^3 at z=2-3.5. for b_alpha=3, this value is a factor of21-35 above previous estimates from individually detected lya emitters,although consistent with the total rho_sfr derived from dust-corrected,continuum uv surveys. 97% of the lya emission in the universe at theseredshifts is therefore undetected in previous surveys of lya emitters. ourmeasurement is much greater than seen from stacking analyses of faint halossurrounding previously detected lya emitters, but we speculate that it arisesfrom similar lya halos surrounding all luminous star-forming galaxies. we alsodetect redshift space anisotropy of the quasar-lya emission cross-correlation,finding evidence at the 3.0 sigma level that it is radially elongated,consistent with distortions caused by radiative-transfer effects (zheng et al.(2011)). our measurements represent the first application of the intensitymapping technique to optical observations.

0805.0600	the relation between lyman-alpha absorbers and gas--rich galaxies in the  local universe	we use high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the spatialcorrelation between weak (n(hi) &lt;10^{15} cm^{-2}) ly-alpha absorbers andgas-rich galaxies in the local universe. we confirm that ly-alpha absorbers arepreferentially expected near gas-rich galaxies and that the degree ofcorrelation increases with the column density of the absorber. the real-spacegalaxy auto-correlation is stronger than the cross-correlation (correlationlengths r_{0,gg}=3.1 \pm 0.1 mpc/h and r_{0,ag}=1.4 \pm 0.1 mpc/h,respectively), in contrast with the recent results of ryan-weber (2006, rw06),and the auto-correlation of absorbers is very weak. these results are robust tothe presence of strong galactic winds in the hydrodynamical simulations. inredshift-space a further mismatch arises since at small separations thedistortion pattern of the simulated galaxy-absorber cross-correlation functionis different from the one measured by rw06. however, when sampling theintergalactic medium along a limited number of lines-of-sight, as in the realdata, uncertainties in the cross correlation estimates are large enough toaccount for these discrepancies. our analysis suggests that the statisticalsignificance of difference between the cross-correlation and auto-correlationsignal in current datasets is ~ 1-sigma only.

1505.07477	the effect of massive neutrinos on the bao peak	we study the impact of neutrino masses on the shape and height of the baopeak of the matter correlation function, both in real and redshift space. inorder to describe the nonlinear evolution of the bao peak we run n-bodysimulations and compare them with simple analytic formulae. we show that theevolution with redshift of the correlation function and its dependence on theneutrino masses is well reproduced in a simplified version of the zel'dovichapproximation, in which the mode-coupling contribution to the power spectrum isneglected. while in linear theory the bao peak decreases for increasingneutrino masses, the effect of nonlinear structure formation goes in theopposite direction, since the peak broadening by large scale flows is lesseffective. as a result of this combined effect, the peak decreases by $\sim 0.6\%$ for $ \sum m_\nu = 0.15$ ev and increases by $\sim1.2 \%$ for $ \sum m_\nu= 0.3$ ev, with respect to a massless neutrino cosmology with equal value ofthe other cosmological parameters. we extend our analysis to redshift space andto halos, and confirm the agreement between simulations and the analyticformulae. we argue that all analytical approaches having the zel'dovichpropagator in their lowest order approximation should give comparableperformances, irrespectively to their formulation in lagrangian or in eulerianspace.

1506.01030	dark matter searches in the gamma-ray extragalactic background via  cross-correlations with galaxy catalogues	we compare the measured angular cross-correlation between the fermi-latgamma-ray sky and catalogues of extra-galactic objects with the expected signalinduced by weakly interacting massive particle (wimp) dark matter (dm). weinclude a detailed description of the contribution of astrophysical gamma-rayemitters such as blazars, misaligned agn and star forming galaxies, and performa global fit to the measured cross-correlation. five catalogues are considered:sdss-dr6 quasars, 2mass galaxies, nvss radio galaxies, sdss-dr8 luminous redgalaxies and sdss-dr8 main galaxy sample. to model the cross-correlation signalwe use the halo occupation distribution formalism to estimate the number ofgalaxies of a given catalogue in dm halos and their spatial correlationproperties. we discuss uncertainties in the predicted cross-correlation signalarising from the dm clustering and wimp microscopic properties, which set thedm gamma-ray emission. the use of different catalogues probing objects atdifferent redshifts reduces significantly, though not completely, thedegeneracy among the different gamma-ray components. we find that the presenceof a significant wimp dm signal is allowed by the data but not significantlypreferred by the fit, although this is mainly due to a degeneracy with themisaligned agn component. with modest substructure boost, the sensitivity ofthis method excludes thermal annihilation cross sections at 95% c.l. for wimpmasses up to few tens of gev. constraining the low-redshift properties ofastrophysical populations with future data will further improve the sensitivityto dm.

1506.03088	voids in massive neutrino cosmologies	cosmic voids are a promising environment to characterize neutrino-inducedeffects on the large-scale distribution of matter in the universe. we perform acomprehensive numerical study of the statistical properties of voids,identified both in the matter and galaxy distributions, in massive and masslessneutrino cosmologies. the matter density field is obtained by running severalindependent $n$-body simulations with cold dark matter and neutrino particles,while the galaxy catalogs are modeled by populating the dark matter halos insimulations via a halo occupation distribution (hod) model to reproduce theclustering properties observed by the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) ii datarelease 7. we focus on the impact of massive neutrinos on the following voidstatistical properties: number density, ellipticities, two-point statistics,density and velocity profiles. considering the matter density field, we findthat voids in massive neutrino cosmologies are less evolved than those in thecorresponding massless neutrinos case: there is a larger number of small voidsand a smaller number of large ones, their profiles are less evacuated, and theypresent a lower wall at the edge. moreover, the degeneracy between $\sigma_8$and $\omega_{\nu}$ is broken when looking at void properties. in terms of thegalaxy density field, we find that differences among cosmologies are difficultto detect because of the small number of galaxy voids in the simulations.differences are instead present when looking at the matter density and velocityprofiles around these voids.

1506.04519	the non-linear power spectrum of the lyman alpha forest	the lyman alpha forest power spectrum has been measured on large scales bythe boss survey in sdss-iii at $z\sim 2.3$, has been shown to agree well withlinear theory predictions, and has provided the first measurement of baryonacoustic oscillations at this redshift. however, the power at small scales,affected by non-linearities, has not been well examined so far. we presentresults from a variety of hydrodynamic simulations to predict the redshiftspace non-linear power spectrum of the lyman alpha transmission for severalmodels, testing the dependence on resolution and box size. a new fittingformula is introduced to facilitate the comparison of our simulation resultswith observations and other simulations. the non-linear power spectrum has ageneric shape determined by a transition scale from linear to non-linearanisotropy, and a jeans scale below which the power drops rapidly. in addition,we predict the two linear bias factors of the lyman alpha forest and provide abetter physical interpretation of their values and redshift evolution. thedependence of these bias factors and the non-linear power on the amplitude andslope of the primordial fluctuations power spectrum, the temperature-densityrelation of the intergalactic medium, and the mean lyman alpha transmission, aswell as the redshift evolution, is investigated and discussed in detail. apreliminary comparison to the observations shows that the predicted redshiftdistortion parameter is in good agreement with the recent determination ofblomqvist et al., but the density bias factor is lower than observed. we makeall our results publicly available in the form of tables of the non-linearpower spectrum that is directly obtained from all our simulations, andparameters of our fitting formula.

(2013) from sdss-iii/boss, complemented by planck2015 cosmic microwave background (cmb) data and other cosmological probes. thispaper improves on the previous analysis by palanque-delabrouille et al. (2015)by using a more powerful set of calibrating hydrodynamical simulations thatreduces uncertainties associated with resolution and box size, by adopting amore flexible set of nuisance parameters for describing the evolution of theintergalactic medium, by including additional freedom to account for systematicuncertainties, and by using planck 2015 constraints in place of planck 2013.  fitting ly$\alpha$ data alone leads to cosmological parameters in excellentagreement with the values derived independently from cmb data, except for aweak tension on the scalar index $n_s$. combining boss ly$\alpha$ with planckcmb constrains the sum of neutrino masses to $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.12$ ev (95\% c.l.)including all identified systematic uncertainties, tighter than our previouslimit (0.15 ev) and more robust. adding ly$\alpha$ data to cmb data reduces theuncertainties on the optical depth to reionization $\tau$, through thecorrelation of $\tau$ with $\sigma_8$. similarly, correlations betweencosmological parameters help in constraining the tensor-to-scalar ratio ofprimordial fluctuations $r$. the tension on $n_s$ can be accommodated byallowing for a running ${\mathrm d}n_s/{\mathrm d}\ln k$. allowing running as afree parameter in the fits does not change the limit on $\sum m_\nu$. wediscuss possible interpretations of these results in the context of slow-rollinflation.

1510.04277	neutral hydrogen in galaxy clusters: impact of agn feedback and  implications for intensity mapping	by means of zoom-in hydrodynamic simulations we quantify the amount ofneutral hydrogen (hi) hosted by groups and clusters of galaxies. oursimulations, which are based on an improved formulation of smoothed particlehydrodynamics (sph), include radiative cooling, star formation, metalenrichment and supernova feedback, and can be split in two different groups,depending on whether feedback from active galactic nuclei (agn) is turned on oroff. simulations are analyzed to account for hi self-shielding and the presenceof molecular hydrogen. we find that the mass in neutral hydrogen of dark matterhalos monotonically increases with the halo mass and can be well described by apower-law of the form $m_{\rm hi}(m,z)\propto m^{3/4}$. our results point outthat agn feedback reduces both the total halo mass and its hi mass, although itis more efficient in removing hi. we conclude that agn feedback reduces theneutral hydrogen mass of a given halo by $\sim50\%$, with a weak dependence onhalo mass and redshift. the spatial distribution of neutral hydrogen withinhalos is also affected by agn feedback, whose effect is to decrease thefraction of hi that resides in the halo inner regions. by extrapolating ourresults to halos not resolved in our simulations we derive astrophysicalimplications from the measurements of $\omega_{\rm hi}(z)$: halos with circularvelocities larger than $\sim25~{\rm km/s}$ are needed to host hi in order toreproduce observations. we find that only the model with agn feedback iscapable of reproducing the value of $\omega_{\rm hi}b_{\rm hi}$ derived fromavailable 21cm intensity mapping observations.

astro-ph;0509262	expansion and collapse in the cosmic web	we study the kinematics of the gaseous cosmic web at high redshift with lymanalpha forest absorption in multiple qso sightlines. using a simple analyticmodel and a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation we constrain the underlyingthree-dimensional distribution of velocities from the observed line-of-sightdistribution of velocity shear across the plane of the sky. the distribution isfound to be in good agreement with the intergalactic medium (igm) undergoinglarge scale motions dominated by the hubble flow. modeling the lyman alphaclouds analytically and with a hydrodynamics simulation, the average expansionvelocity of the gaseous structures causing the lyman alpha forest in the lowerredshift (z = 2) sample appears about 20 percent lower than the local hubbleexpansion velocity. we interpret this as tentative evidence for some cloudsundergoing gravitational collapse. however, the distribution of velocities ishighly skewed, and the majority of clouds at redshifts from 2 to 3.8 expandtypically about 5 - 20 percent faster than the hubble flow. this behavior isexplained if most absorbers in the column density range typically detectableare expanding filaments that stretch and drain into more massive nodes. we findno evidence for the observed distribution of velocity shear being significantlyinfluenced by processes other than hubble expansion and gravitationalinstability, like galactic winds. to avoid overly disturbing the igm, winds maybe old and/or limp by the time we observe them in the lyman alpha forest, orthey may occupy only an insignificant volume fraction of the igm.

astro-ph;0604310	the lyman-alpha forest and wmap year three	a combined analysis of cosmic microwave background (cmb) and lyman-a forestdata allows to constrain the matter power spectrum from small scales of about 1mpc/h all the way to the horizon scale. the long lever arm and complementarityprovided by such an analysis has previously led to a significant tightening ofthe constraints on the shape and the amplitude of the power spectrum ofprimordial density fluctuations. we present here a combined analysis of thewmap three year results with lyman-a forest data. the amplitude of the matterpower spectrum sigma_8 and the spectral index ns inferred from the jointanalysis with high resolution lyman-a forest data and low resolution lyman-aforest data as analyzed by viel &amp; haehnelt (2006) are consistent with the newwmap results to within 1 sigma. the joint analysis with the mainly lowresolution data as analysed by mcdonald et al. (2005) suggests a value ofsigma_8 which is ~ 2 sigma higher than that inferred from the wmap three yeardata alone. the joint analysis of the three year wmap and the lyman-a forestdata also does not favour a running of the spectral index. the best fit valuesfor a combined analysis of the three year wmap data, other cmb data, 2df andthe lyman-a forest data are (sigma_8, ns) = (0.78\pm 0.03,0.96 \pm 0.01).

astro-ph;0606638	numerical simulations of the lyman-alpha forest - a comparison of  gadget-2 and enzo	we compare simulations of the lyman-alpha forest performed with two differenthydrodynamical codes, gadget-2 and enzo. a comparison of the dark matter powerspectrum for simulations run with identical initial conditions show differencesof 1-3% at the scales relevant for quantitative studies of the lyman-alphaforest. this allows a meaningful comparison of the effect of the differentimplementations of the hydrodynamic part of the two codes. using the samecooling and heating algorithm in both codes the differences in the temperatureand the density probability distribution function are of the order of 10%.these differences can be mainly attributed to a slight mismatch in theresolution. the differences are smaller than or equal to the effects of boxsizeand resolution on these statistics. once resolution effects are taken intoaccount the differences in the flux power spectrum - the statistics most widelyused for estimating the matter power spectrum and cosmological parameters fromlyman-alpha forest data - are about 5%. this is again smaller than or equal tothe effects of boxsize and resolution. numerical uncertainties due to aparticular implementation of solving the hydrodynamic or gravitationalequations appear therefore to contribute only moderately to the error budget inestimates of the flux power spectrum from numerical simulations. we furtherfind that the differences in the flux power spectrum for enzo simulations runwith and without adaptive mesh refinement are also of order 5% or smaller. thelatter require 10 times less cpu time making the cpu time requirement similarto that of a version of gadget-2 that is optimised for lyman-alpha forestsimulations.

astro-ph;0701153	strong mgii systems in quasar and gamma-ray burst spectra	the incidence of strong mgii systems in gamma-ray burst (grb) spectra is afew times higher than in quasar (qso) spectra. we investigate several possibleexplanations for this effect, including: dust obscuration bias, clustering ofthe absorbers, different beam sizes of the sources, multiband magnificationbias of grbs, association of the absorbers with the grb event or thecircumburst environment. we find that: i) the incidence rate of mgii systems inqso spectra could be underestimated by a factor 1.3-2 due to dust obscuration;ii) the equivalent-width distribution of the mgii absorbers along grbs isconsistent with that observed along qsos thus suggesting that the absorbers aremore extended than the beam sizes of the sources; iii) on average, grbafterglows showing more than one mgii system are a factor of 1.7 brighter thanthe others, suggesting a lensing origin of the observed discrepancy; iv)gravitational lensing (in different forms, from galaxy lensing to microlensing)can bias high the counts of mgii systems along grbs if the luminosity functionsof the prompt gamma-ray emission and of the optical afterglows have a meanfaint-end slope approaching -5/3 -- -2; v) some of the absorbers can beassociated with the circumburst environment or produced by supernova remnantsunrelated to the grb event itself but lying in the same star-forming region.with the possible exception of magnification bias, it is unlikely that one ofthese effects on its own can fully account for the observed counts. however,the combined action of some of them can substantially reduce the statisticalsignificance of the discrepancy.

0706.0856	is the concentration of dark matter halos at virialization universal ?	several recent studies suggest a correlation between dark matter halo massand the shape of the density profile. we re-analyze simulations from ricotti(2003) in which such a correlation was proposed. we use a standard analysis ofthe halo density profiles and compare the old simulations to new ones performedwith gadget2, including higher resolution runs. we confirm ricotti's resultthat, at virialization, the central log slopes alpha, at 5%-10% of the virialradius are correlated with the halo mass and that the halo concentration is auniversal constant. our results do not contradict the majority of publishedpapers: when using a split power law to fit the density profiles, due to thealpha-concentration degeneracy, the fits are consistent with halos having auniversal shape with alpha=1 or 1.5 and concentrations that depend on the mass,in agreement with results published elsewhere.  recently, several groups have found no evidence for convergence of the innerhalo profile to a constant power law. the choice of a split power lawparameterization used in this letter is motivated by the need to compare ourresults to previous ones and is formally valid because we are not able toresolve regions where the slope of the fitting function reaches its asymptoticconstant value. using a non-parameterized technique, we also show that thedensity profiles of dwarf galaxies at z ~ 10 have a log slope shallower than0.5 within 5% of the virial radius.

0812.0010	lyman-alpha constraints on warm and on warm-plus-cold dark matter models	we revisit lyman-alpha bounds on the dark matter mass in lambda warm darkmatter (lambda-wdm) models, and derive new bounds in the case of mixed coldplus warm models (lambda-cwdm), using a set up which is a good approximationfor several theoretically well-motivated dark matter models. we combine wmap5results with two different lyman-alpha data sets, including observations fromthe sloan digital sky survey. we pay a special attention to systematics, testvarious possible sources of error, and compare the results of differentstatistical approaches. expressed in terms of the mass of a non-resonantlyproduced sterile neutrino, our bounds read m_nrp &gt; 8 kev (frequentist 99.7%confidence limit) or m_nrp &gt; 12.1 kev (bayesian 95% credible interval) in thepure lambda-wdm limit. for the mixed model, we obtain limits on the mass as afunction of the warm dark matter fraction f_wdm. within the mass range studiedhere (5 kev &lt; m_nrp &lt; infinity), we find that any mass value is allowed whenf_wdm &lt; 0.6 (frequentist 99.7% confidence limit); similarly, the bayesian jointprobability on (f_wdm, 1/m_nrp) allows any value of the mass at the 95%confidence level, provided that f_wdm &lt; 0.35.

0812.0333	the impact of simulations in cosmology and galaxy formation a summary of  the workshop novicosmo 2008	in the study of the process of cosmic structure formation numericalsimulations are crucial tools to interface observational data to theoreticalmodels and to investigate issues otherwise unexplored. enormous advances havebeen achieved in the last years thanks to the availability of sophisticatedcodes, now allowing to tackle the problem of cosmic structure formation andsubsequent evolution by covering larger and larger dynamical ranges. moreover,computational cosmology is the ideal interpretative framework for theoverwhelming amount of new data from extragalactic surveys and from largesample of individual objects. the workshop novicosmo 2008 "the impact ofsimulations in cosmology and galaxy formation' held in sissa was aimed atproviding the state-of-the-art on the latest numerical simulations in cosmologyand in galaxy formation. particular emphasis was given to the implementation ofnew physical processes in simulation codes, to the comparison between differentcodes and numerical schemes and how to use best supercomputing facilities ofthe next generation. finally, the impact on our knowledge on the physics of theuniverse brought by this new channel of investigation has also been focused.the workshop was divided in three sections corresponding (roughly) to threemain areas of study: reionization and intergalactic medium; dark and luminousmatter in galaxies; clusters of galaxies and large scale structures. this paperwill provide i) a short resume' of the scientific results of the workshop ii)the complete list of the talks and the instructions on how to retrieve the .pdfof the related (powerpoint) presentations iii) a brief presentation of theassociated exhibition "space art"
