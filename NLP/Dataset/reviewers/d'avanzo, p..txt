0901.4038	the optical afterglows and host galaxies of three short/hard gamma-ray  bursts	short grbs are commonly thought to originate from the merging of doublecompact object binaries but direct evidence for this scenario is still missing.optical observations of short grbs allow us to measure redshifts, firmlyidentify host galaxies, characterize their properties, and accurately localizegrbs within them. multiwavelength observations of grb afterglows provide usefulinformation on the emission mechanisms at work. these are all key issues thatallow one to discriminate among different models of these elusive events. wecarried out photometric observations of the short/hard grb 051227, grb 061006,and grb 071227 with the eso-vlt starting from several hours after the explosiondown to the host galaxy level several days later. for grb 061006 and grb 071227we also obtained spectroscopic observations of the host galaxy. we compared theresults obtained from our optical observations with the available x-ray data ofthese bursts. for all the three above bursts, we discovered optical afterglowsand firmly identified their host galaxies. about half a day after the burst,the optical afterglows of grb 051227 and grb 061006 present a decaysignificatly steeper than in the x-rays. in the case of grb 051227, the opticaldecay is so steep that it likely indicates different emission mechanisms in thetwo wavelengths ranges. the three hosts are blue, star forming galaxies atmoderate redshifts and with metallicities comparable to the solar one. theprojected offsets of the optical afterglows from their host galaxies centersspan a wide range, but all afterglows lie within the light of their hosts andpresent evidence for local absorption in their x-ray spectra. we discuss ourfindings in light of the current models of short grb progenitors.

0901.4100	near-infrared follow-up to the may 2008 activation of sgr 1627-41	on 28 may 2008, the swift satellite detected the first reactivation of sgr1627-41 since its discovery in 1998.  following this event we began an observing campaign in near infraredwavelengths to search for a possible counterpart inside the error circle ofthis sgr, which is expected to show flaring activity simultaneous to the highenergy flares or at least some variability as compared to the quiescent state.  for the follow-up we used the 0.6m rem robotic telescope at la sillaobservatory, which allowed a fast response within 24 hours and, throughdirector discretionary time, the 8.2m very large telescope at paranalobservatory. there, we observed with naco to produce high angular resolutionimaging with the aid of adaptive optics.  these observations represent the fastest near infrared observations after anactivation of this sgr and the deepest and highest spatial resolutionobservations of the chandra error circle.  5 sources are detected in the immediate vicinity of the most precise x-raylocalisation of this source. for 4 of them we do not detect variability,although the x-ray counterpart experimented a significant decay during ourobservation period. the 5th source is only detected in one epoch, where we havethe best image quality, so no variability constrains can be imposed and remainsas the only plausible counterpart. we can impose a limit of ks &gt; 21.6magnitudes to any other counterpart candidate one week after the onset of theactivity. our adaptive optics imaging, with a resolution of 0.2" provides areference frame for subsequent studies of future periods of activity.

0903.2958	rise and fall of the x-ray flash 080330: an off-axis jet?	x-ray flashes (xrfs) are a class of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) with the peakenergy of the time-integrated spectrum, ep, below 30 kev, whereas classicalgrbs have ep of a few hundreds kev. apart from ep and the lower luminosity, theproperties of xrfs are typical of the classical grbs. yet, the nature of xrfsand the differences from that of grbs are not understood. in addition, there isno consensus on the interpretation of the shallow decay phase observed in mostx-ray afterglows of both xrfs and grbs. we examine in detail the case of xrf080330 discovered by swift at the redshift of 1.51. this burst isrepresentative of the xrf class and exhibits an x-ray shallow decay. the richand broadband (from nir to uv) photometric data set we collected across thisphase makes it an ideal candidate to test the off-axis jet interpretationproposed to explain both the softness of xrfs and the shallow decay phase. wepresent prompt gamma-ray, early and late ir/visible/uv and x-ray observationsof the xrf 080330. we derive a sed from nir to x-ray bands across the plateauphase with a power-law index of 0.79 +- 0.01 and negligible rest-frame dustextinction. the multi-wavelength evolution of the afterglow is achromatic from~10^2 s out to ~8x10^4 s. we describe the temporal evolution of themulti-wavelength afterglow within the context of the standard afterglow modeland show that a single-component jet viewed off-axis explains the observations(abriged).

0903.4476	the x-ray afterglow of grb 081109a: clue to the wind bubble structure	we present the prompt bat and afterglow xrt data of swift-discoveredgrb081109a up to ~ 5\times 10^5 sec after the trigger, and the earlyground-based optical follow-ups. the temporal and spectral indices of the x-rayafterglow emission change remarkably. we interpret this as the grb jet firsttraversing the freely expanding supersonic stellar wind of the progenitor withdensity varying as $\rho \propto r^{-2}$. then after approximately 300 sec thejet traverses into a region of apparent constant density similar to thatexpected in the stalled-wind region of a stellar wind bubble or theinterstellar medium (ism). the optical afterglow data are generally consistentwith such a scenario. our best numerical model has a wind density parameter{$a_{*} \sim 0.02$, a density of the stalled wind $n\sim 0.12 {\rm cm}^{-3}$,and a transition radius $ \sim 4.5 \times 10^{17}$ cm}. such a transitionradius is smaller than that predicted by numerical simulations of the stellarwind bubbles and may be due to a rapidly evolving wind of the progenitor closeto the time of its core-collapse.

0903.4714	detailed radio to soft gamma-ray studies of the 2005 outburst of the new  x-ray transient xte j1818-245	xte j1818-245 is an x-ray nova that experienced an outburst in 2005, firstseen by the rxte satellite. the source was observed simultaneously at variouswavelengths up to soft gamma-rays with the integral satellite, from 2005february to september. x-ray novae are extreme systems that often harbor ablack hole, and are known to emit throughout the electromagnetic spectrum whenin outburst. we analyzed radio, (n)ir, optical, x-ray and soft gamma-rayobservations and constructed simultaneous broad-band x-ray spectra. analyzingboth the light curves in various energy ranges and the hardness-intensitydiagram enabled us to study the long-term behavior of the source. spectralparameters were typical of the soft intermediate states and the high softstates of a black hole candidate. the source showed relatively small spectralvariations in x-rays with considerable flux variation in radio. spectralstudies showed that the accretion disc cooled down from 0.64 to 0.27 kev in 100days and that the total flux decreased while the relative flux of the hotmedium increased. radio emission was detected several times, and,interestingly, five days after entering the hss. modeling the spectral energydistribution from the radio to the soft gamma-rays reveals that the radioflares arise from several ejection events. xte j1818-245 is likely a black holecandidate transient source that might be closer than the galactic bulge. theresults from the data analysis trace the physical changes that took place inthe system at a maximum bolometric luminosity of (0.4-0.9)e38 erg/s (assuming adistance between 2.8-4.3 kpc) and they are discussed within the context of discand jet models.

0906.3187	uves/vlt high resolution absorption spectroscopy of the grb080330  afterglow: a study of the grb host galaxy and intervening absorbers	we study the gamma ray burst (grb) environment and intervening absorbers byanalyzing the optical absorption features produced by gas surrounding the grbor along its line of sight. we analyzed high resolution spectroscopicobservations (r=40000, s/n=3 - 6) of the optical afterglow of grb080330, takenwith uves at the vlt ~ 1.5 hours after the grb trigger. the spectrumillustrates the complexity of the ism of the grb host galaxy at z = 1.51 whichhas at least four components in the main absorption system. we detect strongfeii, siii, and niii excited absorption lines associated with the bluemostcomponent only. in addition to the host galaxy, at least two more absorberslying along the line of sight to the afterglow have been detected in theredshift range 0.8 &lt; z &lt; 1.1, each exhibiting mgii absorption. for the bluemostcomponent in the host galaxy, we derive information about its distance from thesite of the grb explosion. we do so by assuming that the excited absorptionlines are produced by indirect uv pumping, and compare the data with a timedependent photo-excitation code. the distance of this component is found to be280+40-50 pc, which is lower than found for other grbs (1 - 6 kpc). we identifytwo additional mgii absorbers, one of them with a rest frame equivalent widthlarger than 1a. the distance between the grb and the absorber measured in thispaper confirms that the power of the grb radiation can influence the conditionsof the interstellar medium up to a distance of at least several hundred pc. forthe intervening absorbers, we confirm the trend that on average one strongintervening system is found per afterglow, as has been noted in studiesexhibiting an excess of strong mgii absorbers along grb sightlines compared toquasars.

0906.3191	non variability of intervening absorbers observed in the uves spectra of  the "naked-eye" grb080319	the aim of this paper is to investigate the properties of the interveningabsorbers lying along the line of sight of gamma-ray burst (grb) 080319bthrough the analysis of its optical absorption features. to this purpose, weanalyze a multi-epoch, high resolution spectroscopic observations (r=40000,corresponding to 7.5 km/s) of the optical afterglow of grb080319b (z=0.937),taken with uves at the vlt. thanks to the rapid response mode (rrm), weobserved the afterglow just 8m:30s after the grb onset when the magnitude was r~ 12. this allowed us to obtain the best signal-to-noise, high resolutionspectrum of a grb afterglow ever (s/n per resolution element ~ 50). two furtherrrm and target of opportunity observations were obtained starting 1.0 and 2.4hours after the event, respectively. four mgii absorption systems lying alongthe line of sight to the afterglow have been detected in the redshift range 0.5&lt; z &lt; 0.8, most of them showing a complex structure featuring severalcomponents. absorptions due to feii, mgi and mnii are also present; they appearin four, two and one intervening absorbers, respectively. one out of foursystems show a mgii2796 rest frame equivalent width larger than 1a. thisconfirms the excess of strong mgii absorbers compared to quasars, with dn/dz =0.9, ~ 4 times larger than the one observed along quasar lines of sight. inaddition, the analysis of multi-epoch, high-resolution spectra allowed us toexclude a significant variability in the column density of the singlecomponents of each absorber. combining this result with estimates of the sizeof the emitting region, we can reject the hypothesis that the differencebetween grb and qso mgii absorbers is due to a different size of the emittingregions.

0911.2516	the optical counterparts of accreting millisecond x-ray pulsars during  quiescence	eight accreting millisecond x-ray pulsars (amxps) are known to date. opticaland nir observations carried out during quiescence give a unique opportunity toconstrain the nature of the donor star and to investigate the origin of theobserved quiescent luminosity at long wavelengths. using data obtained with theeso-very large telescope, we performed a deep optical and nir photometric studyof the fields of xte j1814-338 and of the ultracompact systems xte j0929-314and xte j1807-294 during quiescence in order to look for the presence of avariable counterpart. if suitable candidates were found, we also carried outoptical spectroscopy. we present here the first multi-band (vr) detection ofthe optical counterpart of xte j1814-338 in quiescence together with itsoptical spectrum. the optical light curve shows variability in both bandsconsistent with a sinusoidal modulation at the known 4.3 hr orbital period andpresents a puzzling decrease of the v-band flux around superior conjunctionthat may be interpreted as a partial eclipse. the marginal detection of thevery faint counterpart of xte j0929-314 and deep upper limits for theoptical/nir counterpart of xte j1807-294 are also reported. we also brieflydiscuss the results reported in the literature for the optical/nir counterpartof xte j1751-305. our findings are consistent with amxps being systemscontaining an old, weakly magnetized neutron star, reactivated as a millisecondradio pulsar during quiescence which irradiates the low-mass companion star.the absence of type i x-ray bursts and of hydrogen and helium lines in outburstspectra of ultracompact (p_orb &lt; 1 hr) amxps suggests that the companion starsare likely evolved dwarf stars.

1004.0901	unveiling the origin of x-ray flares in gamma-ray bursts	we present an updated catalog of 113 x-ray flares detected by swift in the~33% of the x-ray afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (grb). 43 flares have ameasured redshift. for the first time the analysis is performed in 4 differentx-ray energy bands, allowing us to constrain the evolution of the flaretemporal properties with energy. we find that flares are narrower at higherenergies: their width follows a power-law relation w~e^{-0.5} reminiscent ofthe prompt emission. flares are asymmetric structures, with a decay time whichis twice the rise time on average. both time scales linearly evolve with time,giving rise to a constant rise-to-decay ratio: this implies that both timescales are stretched by the same factor. as a consequence, the flare widthlinearly evolves with time to larger values: this is a key point that clearlydistinguishes the flare from the grb prompt emission. the flare 0.3-10 kev peakluminosity decreases with time, following a power-law behaviour with largescatter: l_{pk}~ t_{pk}^{-2.7}. when multiple flares are present, a globalsoftening trend is established: each flare is on average softer than theprevious one. the 0.3-10 kev isotropic energy distribution is a log-normalpeaked at 10^{51} erg, with a possible excess at low energies. the flareaverage spectral energy distribution (sed) is found to be a power-law withspectral energy index beta~1.1. these results confirmed that the flares aretightly linked to the prompt emission. however, after considering variousmodels we conclude that no model is currently able to account for the entireset of observations.

1004.2042	on the offset of short gamma-ray bursts	short gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs) are expected to form from the coalescence ofcompact binaries, either of primordial origin or from dynamical interactions inglobular clusters. in this paper, we investigate the possibility that theoffset and afterglow brightness of a sgrb can help revealing the origin of itsprogenitor binary. we find that a sgrb is likely to result from the primordialchannel if it is observed within 10 kpc from the center of a massive galaxy andshows a detectable afterglow. the same conclusion holds if it is 100 kpc awayfrom a small, isolated galaxy and shows a weak afterglow. on the other hand, adynamical origin is suggested for those sgrbs with observable afterglow eitherat a large separation from a massive, isolated galaxy or with an offset of10-100 kpc from a small, isolated galaxy. we discuss the possibility that sgrbsfrom the dynamical channel are hosted in intra-cluster globular clusters andfind that grb 061201 may fall within this scenario.

1005.1569	the sooner: a large robotic telescope	the approach of observational astronomy is mainly aimed at the constructionof larger aperture telescopes, more sensitive detectors and broader wavelengthcoverage. certainly fruitful, this approach turns out to be not completelyfulfilling the needs when phenomena related to the formation of black holes(bh), neutron stars (ns) and relativistic stars in general are concerned.recently, mainly through the vela, beppo-sax and swift satellites, we reached areasonable knowledge of the most violent events in the universe and of some ofthe processes we believe are leading to the formation of black holes (bh). weplan to open a new window of opportunity to study the variegated physics ofvery fast astronomical transients, particularly the one related to extremecompact objects. the innovative approach is based on three cornerstones: 1) thedesign (the conceptual design has been already completed) of a 3m robotictelescope and related focal plane instrumentation characterized by the uniquefeatures: "no telescope points faster"; 2) simultaneous multi-wavelengthsobservations (photometry, spectroscopy o\&amp; polarimetry); 3) high timeresolution observations. the conceptual design of the telescope and relatedinstrumentation is optimized to address the following topics: high frequencya-periodic variability, polarization, high z grbs, short grbs, grb-supernovaeassociation, multi-wavelengths simultaneous photometry and rapid low dispersionspectroscopy. this experiment will turn the "exception" (like the opticalobservations of grb 080319b) to "routine".

1006.0800	the afterglow and host galaxy of grb 090205: evidence for a ly-alpha  emitter at z=4.65	gamma-ray bursts have been proved to be detectable up to distances muchlarger than any other astrophysical object, providing the most effective way,complementary to ordinary surveys, to study the high redshift universe. to thisend, we present here the results of an observational campaign devoted to thestudy of the high-z grb 090205. we carried out optical/nir spectroscopy andimaging of grb 090205 with the eso-vlt starting from hours after the event upto several days later to detect the host galaxy. we compared the resultsobtained from our optical/nir observations with the available swift high-energydata of this burst. our observational campaign led to the detection of theoptical afterglow and host galaxy of grb 090205 and to the first measure of itsredshift, z=4.65. similar to other, recent high-z grbs, grb 090205 has a shortduration in the rest-frame with t_{90,rf}=1.6 s, which suggests the possibilitythat it might belong to the short grbs class. the x-ray afterglow of grb 090205shows a complex and interesting behaviour with a possible rebrightening at500-1000s from the trigger time and late flaring activity. photometricobservations of the grb 090205 host galaxy argue in favor of a starburst galaxywith a stellar population younger than ~ 150 myr. moreover, the metallicity ofz &gt; 0.27 z_sun derived from the grb afterglow spectrum is among the highestderived from grb afterglow measurement at high-z, suggesting that the burstoccurred in a rather enriched envirorment. finally, a detailed analysis of theafterglow spectrum shows the existence of a line corresponding to lyman-alphaemission at the redshift of the burst. grb 090205 is thus hosted in a typicallyman-alpha emitter (lae) at z=4.65. this makes the grb 090205 host thefarthest grb host galaxy, spectroscopically confirmed, detected to date.

1006.4469	searching for differences in swift's intermediate grbs	gamma-ray bursts are usually classified through their high-energy emissioninto short-duration and long-duration bursts, which presumably reflect twodifferent types of progenitors. however, it has been shown on statisticalgrounds that a third, intermediate population is needed in this classificationscheme, although an extensive study of the properties of this class has so farnot been done. the large amount of follow-up studies generated during the swiftera allows us to have a suficient sample to attempt a study of this thirdpopulation through the properties of their prompt emission and theirafterglows. our study is focused on a sample of grbs observed by swift duringits first four years of operation. the sample contains those bursts withmeasured redshift since this allows us to derive intrinsic properties.intermediate bursts are less energetic and have dimmer afterglows than longgrbs, especially when considering the x-ray light curves, which are on averageone order of magnitude fainter than long bursts. there is a less significanttrend in the redshift distribution that places intermediate bursts closer thanlong bursts. except for this, intermediate bursts show similar properties tolong bursts. in particular, they follow the epeak vs. eiso correlation andhave, on average, positive spectral lags with a distribution similar to that oflong bursts. like long grbs, they normally have an associated supernova,although some intermediate bursts have shown no supernova component. this studyshows that intermediate bursts are different from short bursts and, in spite ofsharing many properties with long bursts, there are some differences betweenthem as well. we suggest that the physical difference between intermediate andlong bursts could be that for the first the ejecta are thin shells while forthe latter they are thick shells.

1104.4787	discovery of the onset of rapid accretion by a dormant massive black  hole	massive black holes are believed to reside at the centres of most galaxies.they can be- come detectable by accretion of matter, either continuously from alarge gas reservoir or impulsively from the tidal disruption of a passing star,and conversion of the gravitational energy of the infalling matter to light.continuous accretion drives active galactic nuclei (agn), which are known to bevariable but have never been observed to turn on or off. tidal disruption ofstars by dormant massive black holes has been inferred indirectly but the on-set of a tidal disruption event has never been observed. here we report thefirst discovery of the onset of a relativistic accretion-powered jet in the newextragalactic transient, swift j164449.3+573451. the behaviour of this newsource differs from both theoretical models of tidal disruption events andobservations of the jet-dominated agn known as blazars. these differences maystem from transient effects associated with the onset of a powerful jet. suchan event in the massive black hole at the centre of our milky way galaxy couldstrongly ionize the upper atmosphere of the earth, if beamed towards us.

1104.5141	xrf 100316d / sn 2010bh and the nature of gamma ray burst supernovae	we present ground-based and hst optical and infrared observations of xrf100316d / sn 2010bh. it is seen that the optical light curves of sn 2010bhevolve at a faster rate than the archetype grb-sn 1998bw, but at a similar rateto sn 2006aj, a supernova that was spectroscopically linked with xrf 060218,and at a similar rate to non-grb associated type ic sn 1994i. we estimate therest-frame extinction of this event from our optical data to be e(b-v)=0.18 +/-0.08 mag. we find the v-band absolute magnitude of sn 2010bh to be m_{v}=-18.62+/- 0.08, which is the faintest peak v-band magnitude observed to-date for aspectroscopically-confirmed grb-sne. when we investigate the origin of the fluxat t-t_{o}=0.598 days, it is shown that the light is not synchrotron in origin,but is likely coming from the supernova shock break-out. we then use ouroptical and infrared data to create a quasi-bolometric light curve of sn 2010bhwhich we model with a simple analytical formula. the results of our modelingimply that sn 2010bh synthesized a nickel mass of m_{ni} \approx 0.10 m_{sun},ejected m_{ej} \approx 2.2 m_{sun} and has an explosion energy of e_{k} \approx1.4 x 10^{52} erg. finally, for a sample 22 grb-sne we check for a correlationbetween the stretch factors and luminosity factors in the r band and concludethat no statistically-significant correlation exists.

1105.4915	a photometric redshift of z ~ 9.4 for grb 090429b	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) serve as powerful probes of the early universe, withtheir luminous afterglows revealing the locations and physical properties ofstar forming galaxies at the highest redshifts, and potentially locating firstgeneration (population iii) stars. since grb afterglows have intrinsically verysimple spectra, they allow robust redshifts from low signal to noisespectroscopy, or photometry. here we present a photometric redshift of z~9.4for the swift-detected grb 090429b based on deep observations withgemini-north, the very large telescope, and the grb optical and near-infrareddetector. assuming a small magellanic cloud dust law (which has been found in amajority of grb sight-lines), the 90% likelihood range for the redshift is 9.06&lt; z &lt; 9.52, although there is a low-probability tail to somewhat lowerredshifts. adopting milky way or large magellanic cloud dust laws leads to verysimilar conclusions, while a maiolino law does allow somewhat lower redshiftsolutions, but in all cases the most likely redshift is found to be z&gt;7. thenon-detection of the host galaxy to deep limits (y_ab &gt;~ 28 mag, which wouldcorrespond roughly to 0.001 l* at z=1) in our late time optical and infraredobservations with the hubble space telescope strongly supports the extremeredshift origin of grb 090429b, since we would expect to have detected anylow-z galaxy, even if it were highly dusty. finally, the energetics of grb090429b are comparable to those of other grbs, and suggest that its progenitoris not greatly different to those of lower redshift bursts.

1108.6277	a search for the near-infrared counterpart of the eclipsing millisecond  x-ray pulsar swift j1749.4-2807	swift j1749.4-2807 is a transient accreting millisecond x-ray pulsars, thefirst that displayed x-ray eclipses. therefore it holds a great potential foraccurate mass measurements in a low mass x-ray binary system. the determinationof the companion star radial velocity would make it possible to fully resolvethe system and to accurately measure the mass of the neutron star based ondynamical measurements. unfortunately, no optical/nir counterpart has beenidentified to date for this system, either in outburst or in quiescence. weperformed a photometric study of the field of swift j1749.4-2807 duringquiescence in order to search for the presence of a variable counterpart. thesource direction lies on the galactic plane, making any search for itsoptical/nir counterpart challenging. to minimize the effects of field crowdingand interstellar extinction, we carried out our observations using the adaptiveoptics near-infrared imager naco mounted at the eso very large telescope. fromthe analysis of swift x-ray data obtained during outburst, we derived the mostprecise (1.6" radius) position for this source. due to the extreme stellarcrowding of the field, 41 sources are detected in our vlt images within thex-ray error circle, with some of them possibly showing variability consistentwith the expectations. we carried out the first deep imaging campaign devotedto the search of the quiescent nir counterpart of swift j1749.4-2807. ourresults allow to provide constraints on the nature of the companion star ofthis system. furthermore, they suggest that future phase-resolved nirobservations (performed with large aperture telescopes and adaptive optics)covering the full orbital period of the system are likely to identify thequiescent counterpart of swift j1749.4-2807, through the measure of its orbitalvariability, opening the possibility of dynamical studies of this uniquesource.

1109.4143	a variable mid-infrared synchrotron break associated with the compact  jet in gx 339-4	many x-ray binaries remain undetected in the mid-infrared, a regime whereemission from their compact jets is likely to dominate. here, we report thedetection of the black hole binary gx 339-4 with the wide-field infrared surveyexplorer (wise) during a very bright, hard accretion state in 2010. combinedwith a rich contemporaneous multiwavelength dataset, clear spectral curvatureis found in the infrared, associated with the peak flux density expected fromthe compact jet. an optically-thin slope of ~-0.7 and a jet radiative power of&gt;6x10^{35} erg/s (d/8 kpc)^2 are measured. a ~24 h wise light curve showsdramatic variations in mid-infrared spectral slope on timescales at least asshort as the satellite orbital period ~95 mins. there is also significantchange during one pair of observations spaced by only 11 s. these variationsimply that the spectral break associated with the transition from self-absorbedto optically-thin jet synchrotron radiation must be varying across the fullwavelength range of ~3-22 microns that wise is sensitive to, and more. based onfour-band simultaneous mid-infrared detections, the break lies at ~5x10^{13} hzin at least two epochs of observation, consistent with a magnetic fieldb~1.5x10^4 g assuming a single-zone synchrotron emission region. the observedvariability implies that either b, or the size of the acceleration zone abovethe jet base, are being modulated by factors of ~10 on relatively-shorttimescales.

1109.4312	overview of an extensive multi-wavelength study of gx 339-4 during the  2010 outburst	the microquasar gx 339-4 experienced a new outburst in 2010: it was observedsimultaneously at various wavelengths from radio up to soft gamma-rays. wefocused on observations that are quasi-simultaneous with those made with theintegral and rxte satellites: these were collected in 2010 march-april duringour integral target of opportunity program, and during some of the otherintegral observing programs with gx 339-4 in the field-of-view. x-raytransients are extreme systems that often harbour a black hole, and are knownto emit throughout the whole electromagnetic spectrum when in outburst. thegoals of our program are to understand the evolution of the physical processesclose to the black hole and to study the connections between the accretion andejection. we analysed radio, nir, optical, uv, x-ray and soft gamma-rayobservations. we studied the source evolution in detail by producing lightcurves, hardness-intensity diagrams and spectra. we fitted the broadband datawith phenomenological, then physical, models to study the emission coming fromthe distinct components. based on the energy spectra, the source evolved fromthe canonical hard state to the canonical soft state. the source showed x-rayspectral variations that were correlated with changes in radio, nir and opticalemission. the bolometric flux increased from 0.8 to 2.9*10^{-8} erg cm^{-2}s^{-1} while the relative flux and contribution of the hot medium globallydecreased. reprocessing in the disc was likely to be strong at the end of ourobservations. the source showed a behaviour similar to that of previousoutbursts, with some small deviations in the hard x-rays parameters' evolution.the radio, nir and optical emission from jets was detected, and seen to fade asthe source softened. the results are discussed within the context of disc andjet models.

1111.6946	the nature of the x-ray transient maxi j0556-332	phase-resolved spectroscopy of the newly discovered x-ray transient maxij0556-332 has revealed the presence of narrow emission lines in the bowenregion that most likely arise on the surface of the mass donor star in this lowmass x-ray binary. a period search of the radial velocities of these linesprovides two candidate orbital periods (16.43+/-0.12 and 9.754+/-0.048 hrs),which differ from any potential x-ray periods reported. assuming that maxij0556-332 is a relatively high inclination system that harbors a precessingaccretion disk in order to explain its x-ray properties, it is only possible toobtain a consistent set of system parameters for the longer period. theseassumptions imply a mass ratio of q~0.45, a radial velocity semi-amplitude ofthe secondary of k_2~190 km/s and a compact object mass of the order of thecanonical neutron star mass, making a black hole nature for maxi j0556-332unlikely. we also report the presence of strong n iii emission lines in thespectrum, thereby inferring a high n/o abundance. finally we note that thestrength of all emission lines shows a continuing decay over the ~1 month ofour observations.

1112.0018	a minor body falling onto a neutron star as an explanation for the  unusual gamma-ray burst grb 101225a	the tidal disruption of a solar mass star around a supermassive black holehas been extensively studied analytically and numerically. in these events thestar develops into an elongated banana-shaped structure. after completing aneccentric orbit, the bound debris fall onto the black hole, forming anaccretion disk and emitting radiation. the same process may occur on planetaryscales, if a minor body orbits too close to its star. in the solar system,comets fall directly onto our sun or onto planets. if the star is a compactobject, the minor body can become tidally disrupted. indeed, one of the firstmechanisms invoked to produce strong gamma-ray emission involved accretion ofcomets onto neutron stars in our galaxy. here we report that the peculiaritiesof the `christmas' gamma-ray burst (grb 101225a) can be explained by a tidaldisruption event of a minor body around a galactic isolated neutron star. thisresult would indicate either that minor bodies can be captured by compactstellar remnants more frequently than it occurs in our solar system or thatminor body formation is relatively easy around millisecond radio pulsars. apeculiar supernova associated to a grb may provide an alternative explanation.

1112.1700	a complete sample of bright swift long gamma-ray bursts: sample  presentation, luminosity function and evolution	we present a carefully selected sub-sample of swift long gamma-ray bursts(grbs), that is complete in redshift. the sample is constructed by consideringonly bursts with favorable observing conditions for ground-based follow-upsearches, that are bright in the 15-150 kev swift/bat band, i.e. with 1-s peakphoton fluxes in excess to 2.6 ph s^-1 cm^-2. the sample is composed by 58bursts, 52 of them with redshift for a completeness level of 90%, while anothertwo have a redshift constraint, reaching a completeness level of 95%. for onlythree bursts we have no constraint on the redshift. the high level of redshiftcompleteness allows us for the first time to constrain the grb luminosityfunction and its evolution with cosmic times in a unbiased way. we find thatstrong evolution in luminosity (d_l=2.3\pm 0.6) or in density (d_d=1.7\pm 0.5)is required in order to account for the observations. the derived redshiftdistribution in the two scenarios are consistent with each other, in spite oftheir different intrinsic redshift distribution. this calls for otherindicators to distinguish among different evolution models. complete samplesare at the base of any population studies. in future works we will use thisunique sample of swift bright grbs to study the properties of the population oflong grbs.

1112.4480	the dark bursts population in a complete sample of bright swift long  gamma-ray bursts	we study the properties of the population of optically dark events present ina carefully selected complete sample of bright swift long gamma-ray bursts. thehigh level of completeness in redshift of our sample (52 objects out of 58)allow us to establish the existence of a genuine dark population and we areable to estimate the maximum fraction of dark burst events (~30%) expected forthe whole class of long gamma-ray burst. the redshift distribution of thispopulation of dark bursts is similar to the one of the whole sample.interestingly, the rest-frame x-ray luminosity (and the de-absorbed x-ray flux)of the sub-class of dark bursts is slightly higher than the average luminosityof the non-dark events. at the same time the prompt properties do not differand the optical flux of dark events is at the lower tail of the optical fluxdistribution, corrected for galactic absorption. all these properties suggestthat dark bursts events generate in much denser environments with respect tonormal bright events. we can therefore exclude the high-z and the low-densityscenarios and conclude that the major cause of the origin of optically darkevents is the dust extinction.

1112.5111	the x-ray absorbing column density of a complete sample of bright swift  gamma-ray bursts	a complete sample of bright swift gamma-ray bursts (grbs) has been recentlyselected by salvaterra et al.

1203.0003	the impact of selection biases on the ep-liso correlation of gamma ray  bursts	we study the possible effects of selection biases on the ep-liso correlationcaused by the unavoidable presence of flux-limits in the existing samples ofgamma ray bursts (grbs). we consider a well defined complete sample of swiftgrbs and perform monte carlo simulations of the grb population under differentassumptions for their luminosity functions. if we assume that there is nocorrelation between the peak energy ep and the isotropic luminosity liso, weare unable to reproduce it as due to the flux limit threshold of the swiftcomplete sample. we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no intrinsiccorrelation between ep and liso at more than 2.7 sigma level of confidence.this result is robust against the assumptions of our simulations and it isconfirmed if we consider, instead of swift, the trigger threshold of the batseinstrument. therefore, there must be a physical relation between these twoquantities. our simulations seem to exclude, at a lower confidence level of 1.6sigma, the possibility that the observed ep-liso correlation among differentbursts is caused by a boundary, i.e. such that for any given ep, we see onlythe largest liso, which has a flux above the threshold of the currentinstruments.

1203.1864	on the environment of short gamma-ray bursts	in this paper we present a sample of 10 short gamma-ray bursts (grbs) with arobust redshift determination, discovered by the swift satellite up to january2011. we measure their x-ray absorbing column densities and collect data on thehost galaxy offsets. we find evidence for intrinsic absorption and nocorrelation between the intrinsic absorbing column density and the projectedoffset of the grb from its host galaxy center. we find that the properties inthe gamma regime (t90, fluence and 1-s peak photon flux) of short grbs with"bright" and "faint" x-ray afterglow likely disfavour different prompt emissionmechanisms. host galaxy offset and grb duration (t90) do not correlate.instead, there is a hint of anti-correlation between the effective radiusnormalised host galaxy offset and t90. finally, we examine the properties ofshort grbs with short-lived and long-lived x-ray afterglows, finding that someshort grbs with short-lived x-ray afterglows have their optical afterglowdetected. in light of this, the x-ray afterglow duration does not seem to be anunique indicator of a specific progenitor and/or environment for short grbs.

1206.2357	a complete sample of bright swift gamma-ray bursts: x-ray afterglow  luminosity and its correlation with the prompt emission	we investigate wheter there is any correlation between the x-ray afterglowluminosity and the prompt emission properties of a carefully selectedsub-sample of bright swift long gamma-ray bursts (grbs) nearly complete inredshift (~90%). being free of selection effects (except flux limit), thissample provides the possibility to compare the rest frame physical propertiesof grb prompt and afterglow emission in an unbiased way. the afterglow x-rayluminosities are computed at four different rest frame times (5 min, 1 hr, 11hr and 24 hr after trigger) and compared with the prompt emission isotropicenergy e_iso, the isotropic peak luminosity l_iso and the rest frame peakenergy e_peak. we find that the rest frame afterglow x-ray luminosity docorrelate with these prompt emission quantities, but the significance of eachcorrelation decreases over time. this result is in agreement with the idea thatthe grb x-ray light curve can be described as the result of a combination ofdifferent components whose relative contribution and weight change with time,with the prompt and afterglow emission dominating at early and late time,respectively. in particular, we found evidence that the plateau and the shallowdecay phase often observed in grb x-ray light curves are powered by activityfrom the central engine. the existence of the l_x-e_iso correlation at latetimes (t_rf &gt; 11 hr) suggests a similar radiative efficiency among differentbursts with on average about 6% of the total kinetic energy powering the promptemission.

1210.1215	the faster the narrower: characteristic bulk velocities and jet opening  angles of gamma ray bursts	the jet opening angle theta_jet and the bulk lorentz factor gamma_0 arecrucial parameters for the computation of the energetics of gamma ray bursts(grbs). from the ~30 grbs with measured theta_jet or gamma_0 it is known that:(i) the real energetic e_gamma, obtained by correcting the isotropic equivalentenergy e_iso for the collimation factor ~theta_jet^2, is clustered around10^50-10^51 erg and it is correlated with the peak energy e_p of the promptemission and (ii) the comoving frame e'_p and e'_gamma are clustered aroundtypical values. current estimates of gamma_0 and theta_jet are based onincomplete data samples and their observed distributions could be subject tobiases. through a population synthesis code we investigate whether differentassumed intrinsic distributions of gamma_0 and theta_jet can reproduce a set ofobservational constraints. assuming that all bursts have the same e'_p ande'_gamma in the comoving frame, we find that gamma_0 and theta_jet cannot bedistributed as single power-laws. the best agreement between our simulation andthe available data is obtained assuming (a) log-normal distributions fortheta_jet and gamma_0 and (b) an intrinsic relation between the peak values oftheir distributions, i.e theta_jet^2.5*gamma_0=const. on average, larger valuesof gamma_0 (i.e. the "faster" bursts) correspond to smaller values of theta_jet(i.e. the "narrower"). we predict that ~6% of the bursts that point to usshould not show any jet break in their afterglow light curve since they havesin(theta_jet)&lt;1/gamma_0. finally, we estimate that the local rate of grbs is~0.3% of all local snib/c and ~4.3% of local hypernovae, i.e. snib/c withbroad-lines.

1211.2062	grbs have preferred jet opening angles and bulk lorentz factors	we recently found that gamma ray burst energies and luminosities, in theircomoving frame, are remarkably similar. this, coupled with the clustering ofenergetics once corrected for the collimation factor, suggests the possibilitythat all bursts, in their comoving frame, have the same peak energy e'peak (ofthe order of a few kev) and the same energetics of the prompt emission e'gamma(of the order of 2e48 erg). the large diversity of bursts energies is then dueto the different bulk lorentz factor gamma and jet aperture angle theta_jet. weinvestigated, through a population synthesis code, what are the distributionsof gamma and theta_jet compatible with the observations. both quantities musthave preferred values, with log-normal best fitting distributions and &lt;gamma0&gt;~ 275 and &lt;\theta_jet&gt; ~ 8.7 degree. moreover, the peak values of the gamma andtheta_jet distributions must be related - theta_jet^2.5 gamma =const: thenarrower the jet angle, the larger the bulk lorentz factor. we predict that ~6%of the bursts that point to us should not show any jet break in their afterglowlight curve since they have sin(theta_jet)&lt;1/gamma. finally, we estimate thatthe local rate of grbs is ~0.3% of all local snib/c and ~2.5% of localhypernovae, i.e. snib/c with broad absorption lines.

0712.2186	the afterglows of swift-era gamma-ray bursts. i. comparing pre-swift and  swift era long/soft (type ii) grb optical afterglows	we have gathered optical photometry data from the literature on a largesample of swift-era gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglows including grbs up toseptember 2009, for a total of 76 grbs, and present an additional threepre-swift grbs not included in an earlier sample. furthermore, we publish 840additional new photometry data points on a total of 42 grb afterglows,including large data sets for grbs 050319, 050408, 050802, 050820a, 050922c,060418, 080413a and 080810. we analyzed the light curves of all grbs in thesample and derived spectral energy distributions for the sample with the bestdata quality, allowing us to estimate the host galaxy extinction. wetransformed the afterglow light curves into an extinction-corrected z=1 systemand compared their luminosities with a sample of pre-swift afterglows. theresults of a former study, which showed that grb afterglows clustered andexhibited a bimodal distribution in luminosity space, is weakened by the largersample. we found that the luminosity distribution of the two afterglow samples(swift-era and pre-swift) are very similar, and that a subsample for which wewere not able to estimate the extinction, which is fainter than the mainsample, can be explained by assuming a moderate amount of line-of-sight hostextinction. we derived bolometric isotropic energies for all grbs in oursample, and found only a tentative correlation between the prompt energyrelease and the optical afterglow luminosity at one day after the grb in thez=1 system. a comparative study of the optical luminosities of grb afterglowswith echelle spectra (which show a high number of foreground absorbing systems)and those without reveals no indication that the former are statisticallysignificantly more luminous.

1303.4743	dust extinction for an unbiased sample of grb afterglows	in this paper we compute rest-frame extinctions for the afterglows of asample of gamma-ray bursts complete in redshift. the selection criteria of thesample are based on observational high-energy parameters of the prompt emissionand therefore our sample should not be biased against dusty sight-lines. it istherefore expected that our inferences hold for the general population ofgamma-ray bursts. our main result is that the optical/near-infrared extinctionof gamma-ray burst afterglows in our sample does not follow a singledistribution. 87% of the events are absorbed by less than 2 mag, and 50% sufferfrom less than 0.3-0.4 mag extinction. the remaining 13% of the afterglows arehighly absorbed. the true percentage of gamma-ray burst afterglows showing highabsorption could be even higher since a fair fraction of the events withoutreliable redshift measurement are probably part of this class. these events maybe due to highly dusty molecular clouds/star forming regions associated withthe gamma-ray burst progenitor or along the afterglow line of sight, and/or tomassive dusty host galaxies. no clear evolution in the dust extinctionproperties is evident within the redshift range of our sample, although thelargest extinctions are at z~1.5-2, close to the expected peak of the starformation rate. those events classified as dark are characterized, on average,by a higher extinction than typical events in the sample. a correlation betweenoptical/near-infrared extinction and hydrogen-equivalent column density basedon x-ray studies is shown although the observed nh appears to be well in excesscompared to those observed in the local group. dust extinction does not seem tocorrelate with grb energetics or luminosity.

1306.0013	how to switch on and off a gamma-ray burst through a magnetar	one of the most elusive features of gamma ray bursts (grbs) is the sporadicemission prior to the main prompt event observed in at least $\sim 15\%$ ofcases. these precursors have spectral and temporal properties similar to themain prompt emission, and smaller, but comparable, energetics. they areseparated from the main event by a quiescent time that may be extremely longand, in some cases, more than one precursor has been observed in the sameburst. precursors are still a puzzle: despite many attempts none of theproposed models can account for all the observed features. based on thecomplete sample of bright long grbs observed by swift (bat6), we propose a newscenario for which precursors are explained by assuming that the central grbengine is a newly born magnetar. in this model the precursor and the promptemission arise from accretion of matter onto the surface of the magnetar. theaccretion process can be halted by the centrifugal drag exerted by the rotatingmagnetosphere onto the in-falling matter, allowing for multiple precursors andvery long quiescent times.

1306.1106	cxou j005047.9-731817: a 292-s x-ray binary pulsar in the small  magellanic cloud	we report on the discovery of a transient x-ray pulsars, located in the smallmagellanic cloud, with a pulse period of 292 s. a series of chandra pointingsfortuitously recorded in 2010 april-may the occurrence of a two-weeks-longoutburst, during which the source luminosity increased by a factor of about100, reaching a peak of ~1e36 erg/s (for a distance of 61 kpc). complex-shapeand energy-dependent pulsations were detected close to the outburst peak andduring the very first part of its decay phase. during the outburst, thephase-averaged spectrum of the pulsar was well described by an absorbed powerlaw with photon index ~0.6, but large variations as a function of phase werepresent. the source was also detected by chandra several times (during 2002,2003, 2006, and 2010) at a quiescent level of ~1e34 erg/s. in 2012 we performedan infrared photometric follow-up of the r ~ 15 mag optical counterpart withthe eso/vlt and a spectroscopic observation by means of the ctio telescope. theoptical spectra suggest a late-oe or early-be v-iii luminosity-class star,though a more evolved companion cannot be ruled out by our data (we can excludea luminosity class i and a spectral type later than b2). finally, we show thatthe outburst main parameters (duration and peak luminosity) can be accountedfor by interpreting the source transient activity as a type i outburst in a bex-ray binary.

1307.7704	radio afterglows of a complete sample of bright swift grbs: predictions  from present days to the ska era	radio observations of gamma ray bursts afterglows are fundamental inproviding insights into their physics and environment, and in constraining thetrue energetics of these sources. nonetheless, radio observations of grbafterglows are presently sparse in the time/frequency domain. starting from acomplete sample of 58 bright swift long bursts (bat6), we constructed ahomogeneous sub-sample of 38 radio detections/upper limits which preserves allthe properties of the parent sample. one half of the bursts have detectionsbetween 1 and 5 days after the explosion with typical fluxes f&gt;100 mujy at 8.4ghz. through a population synthesis code coupled with the standard afterglowhydrodynamical emission model (psyche) we reproduce the radio flux distributionof the radio sub-sample. based on these results we study the detectability inthe time/frequency domain of the entire long grb population by present andfuture radio facilities. we find that the grbs that typically trigger swift canbe detected at 8.4 ghz by jvla within few days with modest exposures even athigh redshifts. the final ska can potentially observe the whole grb populationprovided that there will be a dedicated grb gamma-ray detector more sensitivethan swift. for a sizable fraction (50%) of these bursts, ska will allow us toperform radio-calorimetry, after the trans-relativistic transition (occurring~100 d), providing an estimate of the true (collimation corrected) energeticsof grbs.

1308.2984	spectroscopy of the short-hard grb 130603b: the host galaxy and  environment of a compact object merger	short duration gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs) are thought to be related to theviolent merger of compact objects, such as neutron stars or black holes, whichmakes them promising sources of gravitational waves. the detection of a'kilonova'-like signature associated to the swift-detected grb 130603b hassuggested that this event is the result of a compact object merger. ourknowledge on sgrb has been, until now, mostly based on the absence of supernovasignatures and the analysis of the host galaxies to which they cannot always besecurely associated. further progress has been significantly hampered by thefaintness and rapid fading of their optical counterparts (afterglows), whichhas so far precluded spectroscopy of such events. afterglow spectroscopy is thekey tool to firmly determine the distance at which the burst was produced,crucial to understand its physics, and study its local environment. here wepresent the first spectra of a prototypical sgrb afterglow in which bothabsorption and emission features are clearly detected. together withmultiwavelength photometry we study the host and environment of grb 130603b.from these spectra we determine the redshift of the burst to be z =0.3565+/-0.0002, measure rich dynamics both in absorption and emission, and asubstantial line of sight extinction of a_v = 0.86+/-0.15 mag. the grb waslocated at the edge of a disrupted arm of a moderately star forming galaxy withnear-solar metallicity. unlike for most long grbs (lgrbs), n_hx / a_v isconsistent with the galactic ratio, indicating that the explosion site differsfrom those found in lgrbs. the merger is not associated with the moststar-forming region of the galaxy; however, it did occur in a dense region,implying a rapid merger or a low natal kick velocity for the compact objectbinary.

1309.1167	the obscured hyper-energetic grb 120624b hosted by a luminous compact  galaxy at z = 2.20	gamma-ray bursts are the most luminous explosions that we can witness in theuniverse. studying the most extreme cases of these phenomena allows us toconstrain the limits for the progenitor models. in this letter, we study theprompt emission, afterglow, and host galaxy of grb 120624b, one of thebrightest grbs detected by fermi, to derive the energetics of the event andcharacterise the host galaxy in which it was produced. following thehigh-energy detection we conducted a multi-wavelength follow-up campaign,including near-infrared imaging from hawki/vlt, optical from osiris/gtc, x-rayobservations from the chandra x-ray observatory and atsub-millimetre/millimetre wavelengths from sma. optical/nir spectroscopy wasperformed with x-shooter/vlt. we detect the x-ray and nir afterglow of theburst and determine a redshift of z = 2.1974 +/- 0.0002 through theidentification of emission lines of [oii], [oiii] and h-alpha from the hostgalaxy of the grb. this implies an energy release of eiso = (3.0+/-0.2)x10^54erg, amongst the most luminous ever detected. the observations of the afterglowindicate high obscuration with av &gt; 1.5. the host galaxy is compact, with r1/2&lt; 1.6 kpc, but luminous, at l ~ 1.5 l* and has a star formation rate of 91 +/-6 msol/yr as derived from h-alpha. as other highly obscured grbs, grb 120624bis hosted by a luminous galaxy, which we also proof to be compact, with a veryintense star formation. it is one of the most luminous host galaxies associatedwith a grb, showing that the host galaxies of long grbs are not always bluedwarf galaxies, as previously thought.

1312.2379	a year in the life of the low-mass x-ray transient aql x-1	the swift satellite monitored the quiescence of the low-mass x-ray binarytransient aql x-1 on a weekly basis during the march-november 2012 interval. atotal of 42 observations were carried out in the soft x-ray (0.3-10 kev) bandwith the x-ray telescope on board swift. we investigated the x-ray variabilityproperties of aql x-1 during quiescence by tracking luminosity variations andcharacterising them with a detailed spectral analysis. the source is highlyvariable in this phase and two bright flares were detected, with peakluminosities of ~4x10^{34} erg s^{-1} (0.3-10 kev). quiescent x-ray spectrarequire both a soft thermal component below ~2 kev and a hard component (apower law tail) above ~2 kev. changes in the power law normalisation alone canaccount for the overall observed variability. therefore, based on our data set,the quiescent x-ray emission of aql x-1 is consistent with the cooling of theneutron star core and with mechanisms involving the accretion of matter ontothe neutron star surface or magnetosphere.

1401.1972	a magnetar powering the ordinary monster grb 130427a?	we present the analysis of the extraordinarily bright gamma-ray burst (grb)130427a under the hypothesis that the grb central engine is anaccretion-powered magnetar. in this framework, initially proposed to explaingrbs with precursor activity, the prompt emission is produced by accretion ofmatter onto a newly-born magnetar, and the observed power is related to theaccretion rate. the emission is eventually halted if the centrifugal forces areable to pause accretion. we show that the x-ray and optical afterglow is wellexplained as the forward shock emission with a jet break plus a contributionfrom the spin-down of the magnetar. our modelling does not require anycontribution from the reverse shock, that may still influence the afterglowlight curve at radio and mm frequencies, or in the optical at early times. wederive the magnetic field ($b\sim 10^{16}$ g) and the spin period ($p\sim 20$ms) of the magnetar and obtain an independent estimate of the minimumluminosity for accretion. this minimum luminosity results well below the promptemission luminosity of grb 130427a, providing a strong consistency check forthe scenario where the entire prompt emission is the result of continuousaccretion onto the magnetar. this is in agreement with the relatively long spinperiod of the magnetar. grb 130427a was a well monitored grb showing a verystandard behavior and, thus, is a well-suited benchmark to show that anaccretion-powered magnetar gives a unique view of the properties of long grbs.

1402.6338	grb orphan afterglows in present and future radio transient surveys	orphan afterglows (oa) are slow transients produced by gamma ray bursts seenoff-axis that become visible on timescales of days/years at optical/nir andradio frequencies, when the prompt emission at high energies (x and gamma rays)has already ceased. given the typically estimated jet opening angle of grbstheta_jet ~ 3 deg, for each burst pointing to the earth there should be afactor ~ 700 more grbs pointing in other directions. despite this, no secureoas have been detected so far. through a population synthesis code we study theemission properties of the population of oa at radio frequencies. oas reachtheir emission peak on year-timescales and they last for a comparable amount oftime. the typical peak fluxes (which depend on the observing frequency) are offew micro jy in the radio band with only a few oa reaching the mjy level. thesevalues are consistent with the upper limits on the radio flux of sn ib/cobserved at late times. we find that the oa radio number count distribution hasa typical slope -1.7 at high fluxes and a flatter (-0.4) slope at low fluxeswith a break at a frequency-dependent flux. our predictions of the oa rates areconsistent with the (upper) limits of recent radio surveys and archive searchesfor radio transients. future radio surveys like vast/askap at 1.4 ghz shoulddetect ~ 3x10^-3 oa deg^-2 yr-1, meerkat and evla at 8.4 ghz should see ~3x10^-1 oa deg-2 yr-1. the ska, reaching the micro jy flux limit, could see upto ~ 0.2-1.5 oa deg^-2 yr^-1. these rates also depend on the duration of the oaabove a certain flux limit and we discuss this effect with respect to thesurvey cadence.

1403.3245	optical and x-ray rest-frame light curves of the bat6 sample	we present the rest-frame light curves in the optical and x-ray bands of anunbiased and complete sample of swift long gamma-ray bursts (grbs), namely thebat6 sample. the unbiased bat6 sample (consisting of 58 events) has the highestlevel of completeness in redshift ($\sim$ 95%), allowing us to compute therest-frame x-ray and optical light curves for 55 and 47 objects, respectively.we compute the x-ray and optical luminosities accounting for any possiblesource of absorption (galactic and intrinsic) that could affect the observedfluxes in these two bands. we compare the behaviour observed in the x-ray andin the optical bands to assess the relative contribution of the emission duringthe prompt and afterglow phases. we unarguably demonstrate that the grbsrest-frame optical luminosity distribution is not bimodal, being ratherclustered around the mean value log(l$_{r}$) = 29.9 $\pm$ 0.8 when estimated ata rest frame time of 12 hr. this is in contrast with what found in previousworks and confirms that the grb population has an intrinsic unimodal luminositydistribution. for more than 70% of the events the rest-frame light curves inthe x-ray and optical bands have a different evolution, indicating distinctemitting regions and/or mechanisms. the x-ray light curves normalised to thegrb isotropic energy (e$_{\rm iso}$), provide evidence for x-ray emission stillpowered by the prompt emission until late times ($\sim$ hours after the burstevent). on the other hand, the same test performed for the e$_{\rmiso}$-normalised optical light curves shows that the optical emission is abetter proxy of the afterglow emission from early to late times.

1404.2065	the return to quiescence of aql x-1 following the 2010 outburst	aql x-1 is the most prolific low mass x-ray binary transient hosting aneutron star. in this paper we focus on the return to quiescence following the2010 outburst of the source. this decay was monitored thanks to 11 pointedobservations taken with xmm-newton, chandra and swift. the decay from outburstto quiescence is very fast, with an exponential decay characteristic time scaleof ~2 d. once in quiescence the x-ray flux of aql x-1 remained constant, withno further signs of variability or decay. the comparison with the only otherwell-monitored outburst from aql x-1 (1997) is tail-telling. the luminositiesat which the fast decay starts are fully compatible for the two outbursts,hinting at a mechanism intrinsic to the system and possibly related to theneutron star rotation and magnetic field (i.e., the propeller effect). inaddition, for both outbursts, the decay profiles are also very similar, likelyresulting from the shut-off of the accretion process onto the neutron starsurface. finally, the quiescent neutron star temperatures at the end of theoutbursts are well consistent with one another, suggesting a hot neutron starcore dominating the thermal balance. small differences in the quiescent x-rayluminosity among the two outbursts can be attributed to a different level ofthe power law component.

1404.4051	optical and infrared polarimetry of the transient lmxb cen x-4 in  quiescence	we present the first optical and infrared polarimetric study of the low masstransient x-ray binary cen x-4 during its quiescent phase. this work is aimedto search for an intrinsic linear polarisation component in the system emittedradiation that might be due, e.g., to synchrotron emission from a compact jet,or to thomson scattering with free electrons in an accretion disc. multiband(bvri) optical polarimetric observations were obtained during two nights in2008 at the eso la silla 3.6 m telescope (efosc2) in polarimetric mode. theseobservations cover about the 30% of the 15.1 hours orbital period. j-bandobservations were obtained in 2007 with the nics (tng) instrument at la palma,for a totality of 1 hour observation. we obtained 3-sigma upper limits to thepolarisation degree in all the optical bands, with the most constraining onebeing in the i-band (p&lt;0.5%). no phase-correlated variability has been noticedin all the filters. the j-band observations provided a 6% upper limit on thepolarisation level. the constraining upper limits to the polarisation in theoptical allowed us to evaluate the contribution of the possible emission of arelativistic particles jet to the total system radiation to be less then the10%. this is in agreement with the observation of a spectral energydistribution typical of a single black body of a k-spectral type main sequencestar irradiated from the compact object. due to the low s/n ratio it was notpossible to investigate the possible dependency of the polarisation degree fromthe wavelength, that could be suggestive of polarisation induced by thomsonscattering of radiation with free electrons in the outer part of the accretiondisc. observations with higher s/n ratio are required to examine in depth thishypothesis, searching for significant phase-correlated variability.

1408.4121	grb 140206a: the most distant polarized gamma-ray burst	the nature of the prompt gamma-ray emission of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) isstill far from being completely elucidated. the measure of linear polarizationis a powerful tool that can be used to put further constraints on the contentand magnetization of the grb relativistic outflows, as well as on the radiationprocesses at work.  to date only a handful of polarization measurements are available for theprompt emission of grbs. here we present the analysis of the prompt emission ofgrb 140206a, obtained with integral/ibis, swift/bat, and fermi/gbm. usingintegral/ibis as a compton polarimeter we were able to constrain the linearpolarization level of the second peak of this grb as being larger than 28% at90% c.l.  we also present the grb afterglow optical spectroscopy obtained at thetelescopio nazionale galileo (tng), which allowed us the measure the distanceof this grb, z=2.739. this distance value together with the polarizationmeasure obtained with ibis, allowed us to derive the deepest and most reliablelimit to date (xi &lt;1x10-16) on the possibility of lorentz invariance violation,measured through the vacuum birefringence effect on a cosmological source.

1409.0427	engulfing a radio pulsar: the case of psr j1023+0038	the binary millisecond radio pulsar psr j1023+0038 has been recently thesubject of multiwavelength monitoring campaigns which revealed that anaccretion disc has formed around the neutron star (since 2013 june). we presenthere the results of x-ray and uv observations carried out by the swiftsatellite between 2013 october and 2014 may, and of optical and nirobservations performed with the rem telescope, the liverpool telescope, the2.1-m telescope at the san pedro m\'artir observatory and the 1.52-m telescopeat the loiano observing station. the x-ray spectrum is well described by anabsorbed power law, which is softer than the previous quiescent epoch (up to2013 june). the strong correlation between the x-ray and the uv emissionsindicates that the same mechanism should be responsible for part of theemission in these bands. optical and infrared photometric observations showthat the companion star is strongly irradiated. double-peaked emission lines inthe optical spectra provide compelling evidence for the presence of an outeraccretion disc too. the spectral energy distribution from ir to x-rays is wellmodelled if the contributions from the companion, the disc and the intra-binaryshock emission are all considered. our extensive data set can be interpreted interms of an engulfed radio pulsar: the radio pulsar is still active, butundetectable in the radio band due to a large amount of ionized materialsurrounding the compact object. x-rays and gamma-rays are produced in anintra-binary shock front between the relativistic pulsar wind and matter fromthe companion and an outer accretion disc. the intense spin-down powerirradiates the disc and the companion star, accounting for the uv and opticalemissions.

1409.7064	are lgrbs biased tracers of star formation? clues from the host galaxies  of the swift/bat6 complete sample of lgrbs. i: stellar mass at z&lt;1	lgrbs are associated with massive stars and are therefore linked to starformation. the conditions necessary to produce lgrbs can affect the relationbetween the lgrb rate and star formation. by using the power of a complete lgrbsample, our aim is to understand whether such a bias exists and, if it does,what is its origin. in this first paper, we build the sed of the z&lt;1 hostgalaxies of the bat6 lgrb sample, and determine their stellar masses from sedfitting. we compare the resulting stellar mass distribution (i) withstar-forming galaxies observed in deep surveys (ultravista); (ii) withsemi-analitical models of the z&lt;1 star forming galaxy population and (iii) withnumerical simulations of lgrb hosts having different metallicity thresholds forthe progenitor star environment. we find that at z&lt;1 lgrbs tend to avoidmassive galaxies and are powerful in selecting faint low-mass star-forminggalaxies. the stellar mass distribution of the hosts is not consistent withthat of the ultravista star-forming galaxies weighted for their sfr. thisimplies that, at least at z&lt;1, lgrbs are not unbiased tracers of starformation. to make the two distributions consistent, a much steeper faint-endof the mass function would be required, or a very shallow sfr-mass relation forthe low mass galaxy population. grb host galaxy simulations indicates that, toreproduce the stellar mass distribution, a metallicity threshold of the orderof z_th=0.3-0.5z_sun is necessary. models without a metallicity threshold orwith an extreme threshold of z_th = 0.1z_sun are excluded at z&lt;1. the use ofthe bat6 complete sample makes this result not affected by possible biaseswhich could have influenced past results based on incomplete samples. thepreference for low metallicities (z&lt;~0.5z_sun) can be a consequence of theparticular conditions needed for the progenitor star to produce a grb.(abridged)

1410.5216	comparing the spectral lag of short and long gamma-ray bursts and its  relation with the luminosity	we investigated the rest frame spectral lags of two complete samples ofbright long (50) and short (6) gamma-ray bursts (grb) detected by swift. weanalysed the swift/bat data through a discrete cross-correlation function (ccf)fitted with an asymmetric gaussian function to estimate the lag and theassociated uncertainty. we find that half of the long grbs have a positive lagand half a lag consistent with zero. all short grbs have lags consistent withzero. the distributions of the spectral lags for short and long grbs havedifferent average values. limited by the small number of short grbs, we cannotexclude at more than 2 sigma significance level that the two distributions oflags are drawn from the same parent population. if we consider the entiresample of long grbs, we do not find evidence for a lag-luminosity correlation,rather the lag-luminosity plane appears filled on the left hand side, thussuggesting that the lag-luminosity correlation could be a boundary. short grbsare consistent with the long ones in the lag-luminosity plane.

0804.1959	the afterglows of swift-era gamma-ray bursts ii.: type i grb versus type  ii grb optical afterglows	we use a large sample of grb afterglow and prompt-emission data (addingfurther grb afterglow observations in this work) to compare the opticalafterglows (or the lack thereof) of type i grbs with those of type ii grbs. incomparison to the afterglows of type ii grbs, we find that those of type i grbshave a lower average luminosity and show an intrinsic spread of luminosities atleast as wide. from late and deep upper limits on the optical transients, weestablish limits on the maximum optical luminosity of any associated supernova,confirming older works and adding new results. we use deep upper limits on typei grb optical afterglows to constrain the parameter space of possible mini-snemission associated with a compact-object merger. using the prompt emissiondata, we search for correlations between the parameters of the prompt emissionand the late optical afterglow luminosities. we find tentative correlationsbetween the bolometric isotropic energy release and the optical afterglowluminosity at a fixed time after trigger (positive), and between the hostoffset and the luminosity (negative), but no significant correlation betweenthe isotropic energy release and the duration of the grbs. we also discussthree anomalous grbs, grb 060505, grb 060614, and grb 060121, in the light oftheir optical afterglow luminosities.

1502.02676	accessing the population of high redshift gamma ray bursts	gamma ray bursts (grbs) are a powerful probe of the high redshift universe.we present a tool to estimate the detection rate of high-z grbs by a genericdetector with defined energy band and sensitivity. we base this on a populationmodel that reproduces the observed properties of grbs detected by swift, fermiand cgro in the hard x-ray and gamma-ray bands. we provide the expectedcumulative distributions of the flux and fluence of simulated grbs in differentenergy bands. we show that scintillator detectors, operating at relatively highenergies (e.g. tens of kev to the mev), can detect only the most luminous grbsat high redshifts due to the link between the peak spectral energy and theluminosity (ep-liso) of grbs. we show that the best strategy for catching thelargest number of high-z bursts is to go softer (e.g. in the soft x-ray band)but with a very high sensitivity. for instance, an imaging soft x-ray detectoroperating in the 0.2-5 kev energy band reaching a sensitivity, corresponding toa fluence of ~10^-8 erg cm^-2, is expected to detect ~40 grbs yr^-1 sr^-1 atz&gt;5 (~3 grbs yr^-1 sr^-1 at z&gt;10). once high-z grbs are detected the principalissue is to secure their redshift. to this aim we estimate their nir afterglowflux at relatively early times and evaluate the effectiveness of following themup and construct usable samples of events with any forthcoming grb missiondedicated to explore the high-z universe.

1502.07184	multiple tidal disruption flares in the active galaxy ic 3599	tidal disruption events occur when a star passes too close to a massive blackhole and it is totally ripped apart by tidal forces. it may also happen thatthe star is not close enough to the black hole to be totally disrupted and aless dramatic event might happen. if the stellar orbit is bound and highlyeccentric, just like some stars in the centre of our own galaxy, repeatedflares should occur. when the star approaches the black hole tidal radius atperiastron, matter might be stripped resulting in lower intensity outburstsrecurring once every orbital period. we report on swift observations of arecent bright flare from the galaxy ic 3599 hosting a middle-weight black hole,where a possible tidal disruption event was observed in the early 1990s. bylight curve modelling and spectral fitting we can consistently account for theevents as the non-disruptive tidal stripping of a star into a highly eccentricorbit. the recurrence time is 9.5 yr. ic 3599 is also known to host alow-luminosity active galactic nucleus. tidal stripping from this star overseveral orbital passages might be able to spoon-feed also this activity.

0804.4367	the complex light-curve of the afterglow of grb071010a	we present and discuss the results of an extensive observational campaigndevoted to grb071010a, a long-duration gamma-ray burst detected by the swiftsatellite. this event was followed for almost a month in theoptical/near-infrared (nir) with various telescopes starting from about 2minafter the high-energy event. swift-xrt observations started only later at about0.4d. the light-curve evolution allows us to single out an initial rising phasewith a maximum at about 7min, possibly the afterglow onset in the context ofthe standard fireball model, which is then followed by a smooth decayinterrupted by a sharp rebrightening at about 0.6d. the rebrightening wasvisible in both the optical/nir and x-rays and can be interpreted as an episodeof discrete energy injection, although various alternatives are possible. asteepening of the afterglow light curve is recorded at about 1d. the entireevolution of the optical/nir afterglow is consistent with being achromatic.this could be one of the few identified grb afterglows with an achromatic breakin the x-ray through the optical/nir bands. polarimetry was also obtained atabout 1d, just after the rebrightening and almost coincident with thesteepening. this provided a fairly tight upper limit of 0.9% for thepolarized-flux fraction.

1504.02096	unveiling the population of orphan gamma ray bursts	gamma ray bursts are detectable in the gamma-ray band if their jets areoriented towards the observer. however, for each grb with a typical theta_jet,there should be ~2/theta_jet^2 bursts whose emission cone is oriented elsewherein space. these off-axis bursts can be eventually detected when, due to thedeceleration of their relativistic jets, the beaming angle becomes comparableto the viewing angle. orphan afterglows (oa) should outnumber the currentpopulation of bursts detected in the gamma-ray band even if they have not beenconclusively observed so far at any frequency. we compute the expected flux ofthe population of orphan afterglows in the mm, optical and x-ray bands througha population synthesis code of grbs and the standard afterglow emission model.we estimate the detection rate of oa by on-going and forthcoming surveys. theaverage duration of oa as transients above a given limiting flux is derived anddescribed with analytical expressions: in general oa should appear as dailytransients in optical surveys and as monthly/yearly transients in the mm/radioband. we find that ~ 2 oa yr^-1 could already be detected by gaia and up to 20oa yr^-1 could be observed by the ztf survey. a larger number of 50 oa yr^-1should be detected by lsst in the optical band. for the x-ray band, ~ 26 oayr^-1 could be detected by the erosita. for the large population of oadetectable by lsst, the x-ray and optical follow up of the light curve (for thebrightest cases) and/or the extensive follow up of their emission in the mm andradio band could be the key to disentangle their grb nature from otherextragalactic transients of comparable flux density.

0805.1557	grb 080319b: a naked-eye stellar blast from the distant universe	long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) release copious amounts of energyacross the entire electromagnetic spectrum, and so provide a window into theprocess of black hole formation from the collapse of a massive star. over thelast forty years, our understanding of the grb phenomenon has progresseddramatically; nevertheless, fortuitous circumstances occasionally arise thatprovide access to a regime not yet probed. grb 080319b presented such anopportunity, with extraordinarily bright prompt optical emission that peaked ata visual magnitude of 5.3, making it briefly visible with the naked eye. it wascaptured in exquisite detail by wide-field telescopes, imaging the burstlocation from before the time of the explosion. the combination of these uniqueoptical data with simultaneous gamma-ray observations provides powerfuldiagnostics of the detailed physics of this explosion within seconds of itsformation. here we show that the prompt optical and gamma-ray emissions fromthis event likely arise from different spectral components within the samephysical region located at a large distance from the source, implying anextremely relativistic outflow. the chromatic behaviour of the broadbandafterglow is consistent with viewing the grb down the very narrow inner core ofa two-component jet that is expanding into a wind-like environment consistentwith the massive star origin of long grbs. these circumstances can explain theextreme properties of this grb.

astro-ph;0510368	a log n(hi) = 22.6 dla in a dark gamma-ray burst: the environment of grb  050401	the optical afterglow spectrum of grb050401 (at z=2.8992+/-0.0004) shows thepresence of a dla, with log(nhi)=22.6+/-0.3. this is the highest column densityever observed in a dla, and is about five times larger than the strongest dladetected so far in any qso spectrum. from the optical spectrum, we also find avery large zn column density, allowing us to infer an abundance of[zn/h]=-1.0+/-0.4. these large columns are supported by the x-ray spectrum fromswift-xrt which shows a column density (in excess of galactic) oflog(nh)=22.21^{+0.06}_{-0.08} assuming solar abundances (at z=2.9). thecomparison of this x-ray column density, which is dominated by absorption dueto alpha-chain elements, and the hi column density derived from the ly-alphaabsorption line, allows us to derive a metallicity for the absorbing matter of[alpha/h]=-0.4+/-0.3. the optical spectrum is reddened and can be wellreproduced with a power-law with smc extinction, where a_v=0.62+/-0.06. but thetotal optical extinction can also be constrained in a way which is independentof the shape of the extinction curve: from the optical-to-x-ray spectral energydistribution we find, 0.5&lt;~a_v&lt;~4.5. however, even this upper limit,independent of the shape of the extinction curve, is still well below the dustcolumn that is inferred from the x-ray column density, i.e.a_v=9.1^{+1.4}_{-1.5}. this discrepancy might be explained by a small dustcontent with high metallicity (low dust-to-metals ratio). `grey' extinctioncannot explain the discrepancy since we are comparing the metallicity to ameasurement of the total extinction (without reference to the reddening).little dust with high metallicity may be produced by sublimation of dust grainsor may naturally exist in systems younger than a few hundred myr.

astro-ph;0511579	an origin for short g-ray bursts unassociated with current star  formation	two short (&lt;2 s) g-ray bursts (grbs) have recently been localized and fadingafterglow counterparts detected. the combination of these two results leftunclear the nature of the host galaxies of the bursts, because one was astar-forming dwarf, while the other was probably an elliptical galaxy. here wereport the x-ray localization of a short burst (grb 050724) with unusual g-rayand x-ray properties. the x-ray afterglow lies off the centre of an ellipticalgalaxy at a redshift of z=0.258, coincident with the position determined byground-based optical and radio observations. the low level of star formationtypical for elliptical galaxies makes it unlikely that the burst originated n asupernova explosion. a supernova origin was also ruled out for grb 050709, eventhough that burst took place in a galaxy with current star formation. theisotropic energy for the short bursts is 2-3 orders of magnitude lower han thatfor the long bursts. our results therefore suggest that an alternative sourceof bursts -- the of binary systems of neutron stars or a neutron star-blackhole pair -- are the progenitors of short bursts.

astro-ph;0511722	the weak integral bursts grb040223 and grb040624: an emerging population  of dark afterglows	we report here gamma-ray, x-ray and near-infrared observations of grb040223along with gamma-ray and optical observations of grb040624. grb040223 wasdetected by integral close to the galactic plane and grb040624 at high galacticlatitude. analyses of the prompt emission detected by the ibis instrument onintegral are presented for both bursts. the two grbs have long durations, slowpulses and are weak. the gamma-ray spectra of both bursts are best fit withsteep power-laws, implying they are x-ray rich. grb040223 is among the weakestand longest of integral grbs. the x-ray afterglow of this burst was detected 10hours after the prompt event by xmm-newton. the measured spectral propertiesare consistent with a column density much higher than that expected from thegalaxy, indicating strong intrinsic absorption. we carried out near-infraredobservations 17 hours after the burst with the ntt of eso, which yielded upperlimits. given the intrinsic absorption, we find that these limits arecompatible with a simple extrapolation of the x-ray afterglow properties. forgrb040624, we carried out optical observations 13 hours after the burst withfors 1 and 2 at the vlt, and dolores at the tng, again obtaining upper limits.we compare these limits with the magnitudes of a compilation of promptlyobserved counterparts of previous grbs and show that they lie at the very faintend of the distribution. these two bursts are good examples of a population ofbursts with dark or faint afterglows that are being unveiled through theincreasing usage of large diameter telescopes engaged in comprehensiveobservational programmes.

astro-ph;0607601	anatomy of a dark burst - the afterglow of grb 060108	we report the first detection of an optical afterglow of a grb (060108) thatwould have been classified as 'dark' in the absence of deep, rapid ground-basedoptical imaging with the 2-m robotic faulkes telesscope (ftn). ourmultiwavelength analysis reveals an x-ray light curve typical of many swiftlong grbs (3-segments plus flare). its optical afterglow, however, was alreadyfainter than the detection limit of the uvot within 100s of the burst. opticalimaging in bvri' filters with the ftn began 2.75 minutes after the burst andresulted in the detection of the optical afterglow at 5.3 minutes, with a ukirtk-band identification at ~45 mins. r and i'-band light curves are consistentwith a single power law decay in flux, f(t) prop t^-a where a=0.43+/-0.08, or a2-segment light curve with a steep decay a_1 &lt;0.88, flattening to a_2 ~ 0.31,with evidence for rebrightening at i' band. deep vlt r-band imaging at ~12 daysreveals a faint, extended object (r ~23.5 mag) at the location of theafterglow. although the brightness is compatible with the extrapolation of thea_2 slow decay, significant flux is likely due to a host galaxy. this impliesthat the optical light curve had a break before 12 days, akin to what observedin the x-rays. we derive a maximum photometric redshift z&lt;3.2 for grb 060108and a best-fitting optical-to-x-ray sed at 1000 s after the burst consistentwith a power law with index beta_ox = 0.54 and a small amount of extinction.the unambiguous detection at b-band and the derived photometric redshift ruleout a high redshift as the reason for the optical faintness of grb 060108.instead, the hard opt/x-ray spectral index confirms it as one of theoptically-darkest bursts detected and with modest host extinction explains theuvot non-detection (abridged).

astro-ph;0609580	a search for evidence of irradiation in centaurus x-4 during quiescence	we present a study of the neutron star x-ray transient cen x-4. our aim is tolook for any evidence of irradiation of the companion with a detailed analysisof its radial velocity curve, relative contribution of the donor star anddoppler tomography of the main emission lines. to improve our study all ourdata are compared with a set of simulations that consider different physicalparameters of the system, like the disc aperture angle and the mass ratio. weconclude that neither the radial velocity curve nor the orbital variation ofthe relative donor's contribution to the total flux are affected byirradiation. on the other hand, we do see emission from the donor star ath${\alpha}$ and hei 5876 which we tentatively attribute to irradiation effects.in particular, the h${\alpha}$ emission from the companion is clearlyasymmetric and we suggest is produced by irradiation from the hot-spot.finally, from the velocity of the hei 5876 spot we constrain the disc openingangle to alpha=7-14 deg.

astro-ph;0609825	uves/vlt high resolution spectroscopy of grb 050730 afterglow: probing  the features of the grb environment	we analyze high resolution spectroscopic observations of the opticalafterglow of grb050730, obtained with uves@vlt about hours after the grbtrigger. the spectrum shows that the ism of the grb host galaxy at z = 3.967 iscomplex, with at least five components contributing to the main absorptionsystem. we detect strong cii*, siii*, oi* and feii* fine structure absorptionlines associated to the second and third component. for the first threecomponents we derive information on the relative distance from the site of thegrb explosion. component 1, which has the highest redshift, does not presentany fine structure nor low ionization lines; it only shows very high ionizationfeatures, such as civ and ovi, suggesting that this component is very close tothe grb site. from the analysis of low and high ionization lines and finestructure lines, we find evidences that the distance of component 2 from thesite of the grb explosion is 10-100 times smaller than that of component 3. weevaluated the mean metallicity of the z=3.967 system obtaining values about0.01 of the solar metallicity or less. however, this should not be taken asrepresentative of the circumburst medium, since the main contribution to thehydrogen column density comes from the outer regions of the galaxy while thatof the other elements presumably comes from the ism closer to the grb site.furthermore, difficulties in evaluating dust depletion correction can modifysignificantly these values. the mean [c/fe] ratio agrees well with thatexpected by single star-formation event models. interestingly the [c/fe] ofcomponent 2 is smaller than that of component 3, in agreement with grb dustdestruction scenarios, if component 2 is closer than component 3 to the grbsite.

astro-ph;0610660	the remarkable afterglow of grb 061007: implications for optical flashes  and grb fireballs	we present a multiwavelength analysis of swift grb 061007. the 2-m roboticfaulkes telescope south (fts) began observing 137 s after the onset of thegamma-ray emission, when the optical counterpart was already decaying from r10.3 mag, and continued observing for the next 5.5 hours. these observationsbegin during the final gamma-ray flare and continue through and beyond a long,soft tail of gamma-ray emission whose flux shows an underlying simple power-lawdecay identical to that seen at optical and x-ray wavelengths, with temporalslope alpha 1.7 this remarkably simple decay in all of these bands is rare forswift bursts, which often show much more complex light curves. we suggest theafterglow emission begins as early as 30-100 s and is contemporaneous with theon-going variable prompt emission from the central engine, but originates froma physically distinct region dominated by the forward shock. the afterglowcontinues unabated until at least 10^5 s showing no evidence of a break. theobserved multiwavelength evolution of grb 061007 is explained by an expandingfireball whose optical, x-ray and late-time gamma-ray emission is dominated byemission from a forward shock with typical synchrotron frequency, nu_m, that isalready below the optical band as early as t=137 s and a cooling frequency,nu_c, above the x-ray band to at least t=10^5 s. in contrast, the typicalfrequency of the reverse shock lies in the radio band at early time. we suggestthat the unexpected lack of bright optical flashes from the majority of swiftgrbs may be explained with a low nu_m originating from small microphysicsparameters, epsilon_e and epsilon_b.

astro-ph;0612575	simultaneous multiwavelength observations of the low/hard state of the  x-ray transient source swift j1753.5-0127	we report the results of simultaneous multiwavelength observations of thex-ray transient source swift j1753.5-0127 performed with integral, rxte, ntt,rem and vla on 2005 august 10-12. the source, which underwent an x-ray outburstsince 2005 may 30, was observed during the integral target of opportunityprogram dedicated to new x-ray novae located in the galactic halo. broad-bandspectra and fast timing variability properties of swift j1753.5-0127 areanalyzed together with the optical, near infra-red and radio data. we show thatthe source was significantly detected up to 600 kev with comptonizationparameters and timing properties typical of the so-called low/hard state ofblack hole candidates. we build a spectral energy distribution and we show thatswift j1753.5-0127 does not follow the usual radio/x-ray correlation of x-raybinaries in the low/hard state. we give estimates of distance and mass. weconclude that swift j1753.5-0127 belongs to the x-ray nova class and that it islikely a black hole candidate transient source of the galactic halo whichremained in the low/hard state during its main outburst. we discuss our resultswithin the context of comptonization and jet models.

0706.1273	multicolor observations of the afterglow of the short/hard grb 050724	new information on short/hard gamma-ray bursts (grbs) is being gatheredthanks to the discovery of their optical and x-ray afterglows. however, somekey aspects are still poorly understood, including the collimation level of theoutflow, the duration of the central engine activity, and the properties of theprogenitor systems. we want to constrain the physical properties of the shortgrb 050724 and of its host galaxy, and make some inferences on the global shortgrb population. we present optical observations of the afterglow of grb 050724and of its host galaxy, significantly expanding the existing dataset for thisevent. we compare our results with models, complementing them with availablemeasurements from the literature. we study the afterglow light curve andspectrum including x-ray data. we also present observations of the host galaxy.the observed optical emission was likely related to the large flare observed inthe x-ray light curve. the apparent steep decay was therefore not due to thejet effect. available data are indeed consistent with low collimation, in turnimplying a large energy release, comparable to that of long grbs. the flareproperties also constrain the internal shock mechanism, requiring a largelorentz factor contrast between the colliding shells. this implies that thecentral engine was active at late times, rather than ejecting all shellssimultaneously. the host galaxy has red colors and no ongoing star formation,consistent with previous findings on this grb. however, it is not a pureelliptical, and has some faint spiral structure. grb 050724 provides the mostcompelling case for association between a short burst and a galaxy with oldstellar population. it thus plays a pivotal role in constraining progenitorsmodels, which should allow for long delays between birth and explosion.

0812.3032	phase resolved spectroscopy of the accreting millisecond x-ray pulsar  sax j1808.4-3658 during the 2008 outburst	aims: we obtained phase-resolved spectroscopy of the accreting millisecondx-ray pulsar sax j1808.4-3658 during its outburst in 2008 to find a signatureof the donor star, constrain its radial velocity semi-amplitude (k_2), andderive estimates on the pulsar mass. methods: using doppler images of the bowenregion we find a significant (&gt;8sigma) compact spot at a position where thedonor star is expected. if this is a signature of the donor star, we measurek_em=248+/-20 km/s (1sigma confidence) which represents a strict lower limit tok_2. also, the doppler map of he ii lambda4686 shows the characteristicsignature of the accretion disk, and there is a hint of enhanced emission thatmay be a result of tidal distortions in the accretion disk that are expected invery low mass ratio interacting binaries. results: the lower-limit on k_2 leadsto a lower-limit on the mass function of f(m_1)&gt;0.10m_sun. applying the maximumk-correction gives 228&lt;k_2&lt;322 km/s and a mass ratio of 0.051&lt;q&lt;0.072.conclusions: despite the limited s/n of the data we were able to detect asignature of the donor star in sax j1808.4-3658, although future observationsduring a new outburst are still warranted to confirm this. if the derived k_emis correct, the largest uncertainty in the determination of the mass of theneutron star in sax j1808.4-3658 using dynamical studies lies with the poorlyknown inclination.
