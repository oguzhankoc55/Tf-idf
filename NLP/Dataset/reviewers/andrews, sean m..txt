0903.4455	a spatially resolved inner hole in the disk around gm aurigae	we present 0.3 arcsec resolution observations of the disk around gm aurigaewith the submillimeter array (sma) at a wavelength of 860 um and with theplateau de bure interferometer at a wavelength of 1.3 mm. these observationsprobe the distribution of disk material on spatial scales commensurate with thesize of the inner hole predicted by models of the spectral energy distribution.the data clearly indicate a sharp decrease in millimeter optical depth at thedisk center, consistent with a deficit of material at distances less than ~20au from the star. we refine the accretion disk model of calvet et al. (2005)based on the unresolved spectral energy distribution (sed) and demonstrate thatit reproduces well the spatially resolved millimeter continuum data at bothavailable wavelengths. we also present complementary sma observations of coj=3-2 and j=2-1 emission from the disk at 2" resolution. the observed comorphology is consistent with the continuum model prediction, with twosignificant deviations: (1) the emission displays a larger co j=3-2/j=2-1 lineratio than predicted, which may indicate additional heating of gas in the upperdisk layers; and (2) the position angle of the kinematic rotation patterndiffers by 11 +/- 2 degrees from that measured at smaller scales from the dustcontinuum, which may indicate the presence of a warp. we note thatphotoevaporation, grain growth, and binarity are unlikely mechanisms forinducing the observed sharp decrease in opacity or surface density at the diskcenter. the inner hole plausibly results from the dynamical influence of aplanet on the disk material. warping induced by a planet could also potentiallyexplain the difference in position angle between the continuum and co datasets.

0906.0730	protoplanetary disk structures in ophiuchus	we present a high angular resolution (0.3" = 40 au) sma survey of the 870micron thermal continuum emission from 9 of the brightest, and therefore mostmassive, circumstellar disks in the ~1 myr-old ophiuchus star-forming region.using 2-d radiative transfer calculations, we simultaneously fit the observedcontinuum visibilities and broadband spectral energy distribution for each diskwith a parametric structure model. compared to previous millimeter studies,this survey includes significant upgrades in modeling, data quality, andangular resolution that provide improved constraints on key structureparameters, particularly those that characterize the spatial distribution ofmass in the disks. in the context of a surface density profile motivated bysimilarity solutions for viscous accretion disks, the best-fit models for thesample disks have characteristic radii r_c = 20-200 au, high disk masses m_d =0.005-0.14 m_sun, and a narrow range of radial surface density gradients arounda median $\gamma$ = 0.9. these density structures are used in conjunction withaccretion rate estimates from the literature to help characterize the viscousevolution of the disk material. using the standard prescription for diskviscosities, those combined constraints indicate that $\alpha$ = 0.0005-0.08.three of the sample disks show large (r = 20-40 au) central cavities in theircontinuum emission morphologies, marking extensive zones where dust has beenphysically removed and/or has significantly diminished opacities. based on thecurrent requirements of planet formation models, these emission cavities andthe structure constraints for the sample as a whole suggest that these youngdisks may eventually produce planetary systems, and have perhaps alreadystarted.

0909.1345	stringent limits on the polarized submillimeter emission from  protoplanetary disks	we present arcsecond-resolution submillimeter array (sma) polarimetricobservations of the 880 um continuum emission from the protoplanetary disksaround two nearby stars, hd 163296 and tw hydrae. although previousobservations and theoretical work have suggested that a 2-3% polarizationfraction should be common for the millimeter continuum emission from suchdisks, we detect no polarized continuum emission above a 3-sigma upper limit of7 mjy in each arcsecond-scale beam, or &lt;1% in integrated continuum emission. wecompare the sma upper limits with the predictions from the exploratory cho &amp;lazarian (2007) model of polarized emission from t tauri disks threaded bytoroidal magnetic fields, and rule out their fiducial model at the ~10-sigmalevel. we explore some potential causes for this discrepancy, focusing on modelparameters that describe the shape, magnetic field alignment, and sizedistribution of grains in the disk. we also investigate related effects likethe magnetic field strength and geometry, scattering off of large grains, andthe efficiency of grain alignment, including recent advances in grain alignmenttheory, which are not considered in the fiducial model. we discuss the impacteach parameter would have on the data and determine that the suppression ofpolarized emission plausibly arises from rounding of large grains, reducedefficiency of grain alignment with the magnetic field, and/or some degree ofmagnetic field tangling (perhaps due to turbulence). a poloidal magnetic fieldgeometry could also reduce the polarization signal, particularly for a face-onviewing geometry like the tw hya disk. the data provided here offer the moststringent limits to date on the polarized millimeter-wavelength emission fromdisks around young stars.

1007.5070	protoplanetary disk structures in ophiuchus ii: extension to fainter  sources	we present new results from a significant extension of our previous highangular resolution (0.3" = 40 au) submillimeter array survey of the 880 umcontinuum emission from dusty circumstellar disks in the ~1 myr-old ophiuchusstar-forming region. an expanded sample is constructed to probe disk structuresthat emit significantly lower millimeter luminosities (hence dust masses), downto the median value for t tauri stars. using a monte carlo radiative transfercode, the millimeter visibilities and broadband spectral energy distributionfor each disk are simultaneously reproduced with a two-dimensional parametricmodel for a viscous accretion disk. we find wide ranges of characteristic radii(14-198 au) and disk masses (0.004-0.143 m_sun), but a narrow distribution ofsurface density gradients (0.4-1.1) that is consistent with a uniform value$\gamma$ = 0.9 +/- 0.2 and independent of mass (or millimeter luminosity). inthis sample, we find a correlation between the disk luminosity/mass andcharacteristic radius, such that fainter disks are both smaller and lessmassive. we suggest that this relationship is an imprint of the initialconditions inherited by the disks at their formation epoch, compare theirangular momenta with those of molecular cloud cores, and speculate on howfuture observations can help constrain the distribution of viscous evolutiontimescales. no other correlations between disk and star properties are found.the inferred disk structures are briefly compared with theoretical models forgiant planet formation, although resolution limitations do not permit us todirectly comment on material inside r = 20 au. however, there is somecompelling evidence for dust evolution in the planet formation region: 4/17disks in the sample show resolved regions of significantly reduced opticaldepths within ~20-40 au of their central stars.

1104.1236	disk imaging survey of chemistry with sma: ii. southern sky  protoplanetary disk data and full sample statistics	this is the second in a series of papers based on data from discs, asubmillimeter array observing program aimed at spatially and spectrallyresolving the chemical composition of 12 protoplanetary disks. we present dataon six southern sky sources - im lup, sao 206462 (hd 135344b), hd 142527, as209, as 205 and v4046 sgr - which complement the six sources in the taurus starforming region reported previously. co 2-1 and hco+ 3-2 emission are detectedand resolved in all disks and show velocity patterns consistent with keplerianrotation. where detected, the emission from dco+ 3-2, n2h+ 3-2, h2co 3-2 and4-3,hcn 3-2 and cn 2-1 are also generally spatially resolved. the detectionrates are highest toward the m and k stars, while the f star sao 206462 hasonly weak cn and hcn emission, and h2co alone is detected toward hd 142527.these findings together with the statistics from the previous taurus disks,support the hypothesis that high detection rates of many small molecules dependon the presence of a cold and protected disk midplane, which is less commonaround f and a stars compared to m and k stars. disk-averaged variations in theproposed radiation tracer cn/hcn are found to be small, despite two orders ofmagnitude range of spectral types and accretion rates. in contrast, theresolved images suggest that the cn/hcn emission ratio varies with disk radiusin at least two of the systems. there are no clear observational differences inthe disk chemistry between the classical/full t tauri disks and transitionaldisks. furthermore, the observed line emission does not depend on measuredaccretion luminosities or the number of infrared lines detected, which suggeststhat the chemistry outside of 100 au is not coupled to the physical processesthat drive the chemistry in the innermost few au.

1203.6353	a resolved census of millimeter emission from taurus multiple star  systems	we present a high angular resolution millimeter-wave dust continuum imagingsurvey of circumstellar material associated with individual components of 23multiple star systems in the taurus-auriga young cluster. combined withprevious measurements, these new data permit a comprehensive look at howmillimeter luminosity (a tracer of disk mass) relates to the separation andmass of a stellar companion. approximately one third (28-37%) of individualstars in multiples have detectable millimeter emission, a rate half that forsingle stars (~62%). there is a strong correlation between the luminosity andprojected separation (a_p) of a stellar pair. wide pairs (a_p &gt; 300 au) have asimilar luminosity distribution as single stars, medium pairs (a_p ~ 30-300 au)are a factor of 5 fainter, and close pairs (a_p &lt; 30 au) are ~ 5 times fainteryet (aside from a small population of bright circumbinary disks). in mostcases, the emission is dominated by a disk around the primary (or a widetertiary in triples), but there is no clear relationship between luminosity andstellar mass ratio. a direct comparison of resolved disk sizes with predictionsfrom tidal truncation models yields mixed results; some disks are larger thanexpected given their companion separations. we suggest that the presence of astellar companion impacts disk properties at a level comparable to the internalevolution mechanisms operating in isolated systems, with both the multiple starformation process itself and star-disk tidal interactions likely playingimportant roles in the evolution of disk material. from the perspective of themass content of the disk, we expect that (giant) planet formation is inhibitedaround the components of close pairs or secondaries, but should be as likely asfor single stars around the primaries (or wide tertiaries in hierarchicaltriples) in more widely-separated multiple star systems.

1303.1107	an old disk that can still form a planetary system	from the masses of planets orbiting our sun, and relative elementalabundances, it is estimated that at birth our solar system required a minimumdisk mass of ~0.01 solar masses within ~100 au of the star. the mainconstituent, gaseous molecular hydrogen, does not emit from the disk massreservoir, so the most common measure of the disk mass is dust thermal emissionand lines of gaseous carbon monoxide. carbon monoxide emission generally probesthe disk surface, while the conversion from dust emission to gas mass requiresknowledge of the grain properties and gas-to-dust mass ratio, which likelydiffer from their interstellar values. thus, mass estimates vary by orders ofmagnitude, as exemplified by the relatively old (3--10 myr) star tw hya, withestimates ranging from 0.0005 to 0.06 solar masses. here we report thedetection the fundamental rotational transition of hydrogen deuteride, hd,toward tw hya. hd is a good tracer of disk gas because it follows thedistribution of molecular hydrogen and its emission is sensitive to the totalmass. the hd detection, combined with existing observations and detailedmodels, implies a disk mass &gt;0.05 solar masses, enough to form a planetarysystem like our own.

1305.5262	the mass dependence between protoplanetary disks and their stellar hosts	we present a substantial extension of the mm-wave continuum photometrycatalog for taurus circumstellar dust disks. combining new submillimeter arraydata with measurements in the literature, we construct a mm-wave luminositydistribution for class ii disks that is statistically complete for stellarhosts with spectral types earlier than m8.5 and has a (3-sigma) depth of ~3mjy. the resulting census eliminates a longstanding bias against disks withlate-type hosts, and thereby reveals a strong correlation between l_mm and thehost spectral type. we confirm that this corresponds to a statistically robustrelationship between the masses of dust disks and the stars that host them. abayesian regression technique is used to characterize these relationships: theresults indicate a typical 1.3 mm flux density of 25 mjy for solar mass hostsand a power-law scaling l_mm \propto m_star^1.5-2.0. we suggest that areasonable treatment of dust temperature in the conversion from l_mm to m_diskfavors an inherently linear m_disk \propto m_star scaling, with a typicaldisk-to-star mass ratio of $\sim$0.2--0.6%. the rms dispersion around thisregression is 0.7 dex, suggesting that the combined effects of diverseevolutionary states, dust opacities, and temperatures in these disks imprint afwhm range of a factor of 40 on the inferred m_disk (or l_mm) at any given hostmass. we argue that this relationship between m_disk and m_star likelyrepresents the origin of the inferred correlation between giant planetfrequency and host star mass in the exoplanet population, and provides somebasic support for the core accretion model for planet formation. moreover, wecaution that selection bias must be considered in comparative studies of diskevolution, and illustrate that fact with statistical comparisons of l_mmbetween taurus and other clusters (abridged).

1311.5222	on the outer edges of protoplanetary dust disks	the expectation that aerodynamic drag will force the solids in a gas-richprotoplanetary disk to spiral in toward the host star on short timescales isone of the fundamental problems in planet formation theory. the nominalefficiency of this radial drift process is in conflict with observations,suggesting that an empirical calibration of solid transport mechanisms in adisk is highly desirable. however, the fact that both radial drift and graingrowth produce a similar particle size segregation in a disk (such that largerparticles are preferentially concentrated closer to the star) makes itdifficult to disentangle a clear signature of drift alone. we highlight a newapproach, by showing that radial drift leaves a distinctive "fingerprint" inthe dust surface density profile that is directly accessible to currentobservational facilities. using an analytical framework for dust evolution, wedemonstrate that the combined effects of drift and (viscous) gas drag naturallyproduce a sharp outer edge in the dust distribution (or, equivalently, a sharpdecrease in the dust-to-gas mass ratio). this edge feature forms during theearliest phase in the evolution of disk solids, before grain growth in theouter disk has made much progress, and is preserved over longer timescales whenboth growth and transport effects are more substantial. the key features ofthese analytical models are reproduced in detailed numerical simulations, andare qualitatively consistent with recent millimeter-wave observations that findgas/dust size discrepancies and steep declines in dust continuum emission inthe outer regions of protoplanetary disks.

1312.3817	fast radial flows in transition disk holes	protoplanetary "transition" disks have large, mass-depleted central cavities,yet also deliver gas onto their host stars at rates comparable to disks withoutholes. the paradox of simultaneous transparency and accretion can be explainedif gas flows inward at much higher radial speeds inside the cavity than outsidethe cavity, since surface density (and by extension optical depth) variesinversely with inflow velocity at fixed accretion rate. radial speeds withinthe cavity might even have to approach free-fall values to explain the hugesurface density contrasts inferred for transition disks. we identifyobservational diagnostics of fast radial inflow in channel maps made inoptically thick spectral lines. signatures include (1) twisted isophotes inmaps made at low systemic velocities and (2) rotation of structures observedbetween maps made in high-velocity line wings. as a test case, we apply our newdiagnostic tools to archival alma data on the transition disk hd 142527, anduncover evidence for free-fall radial velocities inside its cavity. althoughthe observed kinematics are also consistent with a disk warp, the radial inflowscenario is preferred because it predicts low surface densities that appearconsistent with recent observations of optically thin co isotopologues in thisdisk. how material in the disk cavity sheds its angular momentum wholesale tofall freely onto the star is an unsolved problem; gravitational torques exertedby giant planets or brown dwarfs are briefly discussed as a candidatemechanism.

1404.5652	resolved multifrequency radio observations of gg tau	we present sub-arcsecond resolution observations of continuum emissionassociated with the gg tau quadruple star system at wavelengths of 1.3, 2.8,7.3, and 50 mm. these data confirm that the gg tau a binary is encircled by acircumbinary ring at a radius of 235 au with a fwhm width of ~60 au. we find noclear evidence for a radial gradient in the spectral shape of the ring,suggesting that the particle size distribution is spatially homogeneous onangular scales of ~0.1". a central point source, likely associated with theprimary component (gg tau aa), exhibits a composite spectrum from dust andfree-free emission. faint emission at 7.3 mm is observed toward the low-massstar gg tau ba, although its origin remains uncertain. using these measurementsof the resolved, multifrequency emission structure of the gg tau a system,models of the far-infrared to radio spectrum are developed to place constraintson the grain size distribution and dust mass in the circumbinary ring. thenon-negligible curvature present in the ring spectrum implies a maximumparticle size of 1-10 mm, although we are unable to place strong constraints onthe distribution shape. the corresponding dust mass is 30-300 m_earth, at atemperature of 20-30 k. we discuss how this significant concentration ofrelatively large particles in a narrow ring at a large radius might be producedin a local region of higher gas pressures (i.e., a particle "trap") locatednear the inner edge of the circumbinary disk.

1504.05198	demographics of transition discs in ophiuchus and taurus	transition disc systems are young stars that appear to be on the verge ofdispersing their protoplanetary discs. we explore the nature of these systemsby comparing the stellar accretion rates and disc masses of transition discsand normal t tauri stars in taurus and ophiuchus. after controlling for theknown dependencies of stellar accretion rate and disc mass and on age, stellaraccretion rate on stellar mass, and disc mass on the presence of stellar orsub-stellar companions, we find that the normal t tauri stars show a trend ofstellar accretion rate increasing with disc mass. the transition discs tend tohave higher average disc masses than normal t tauri stars as well as loweraccretion rates than normal t tauri stars of the same disc mass. these resultsare most consistent with the interpretation that the transition discs haveformed objects massive enough to alter the accretion flow, i.e., single ormultiple giant planets. several ophiuchus t tauri stars that are not knowntransition disc systems also have very low accretion rates for their discmasses. we speculate on the possible nature of these sources.

1505.06347	the cometary composition of a protoplanetary disk as revealed by complex  cyanides	observations of comets and asteroids show that the solar nebula that spawnedour planetary system was rich in water and organic molecules. bombardmentbrought these organics to the young earth's surface, seeding its earlychemistry. unlike asteroids, comets preserve a nearly pristine record of thesolar nebula composition. the presence of cyanides in comets, including 0.01%of methyl cyanide (ch3cn) with respect to water, is of special interest becauseof the importance of c-n bonds for abiotic amino acid synthesis. comet-likecompositions of simple and complex volatiles are found in protostars, and canbe readily explained by a combination of gas-phase chemistry to form e.g. hcnand an active ice-phase chemistry on grain surfaces that advancescomplexity[3]. simple volatiles, including water and hcn, have been detectedpreviously in solar nebula analogues - protoplanetary disks around young stars- indicating that they survive disk formation or are reformed in situ. it hasbeen hitherto unclear whether the same holds for more complex organic moleculesoutside of the solar nebula, since recent observations show a dramatic changein the chemistry at the boundary between nascent envelopes and young disks dueto accretion shocks[8]. here we report the detection of ch3cn (and hcn andhc3n) in the protoplanetary disk around the young star mwc 480. we findabundance ratios of these n-bearing organics in the gas-phase similar tocomets, which suggests an even higher relative abundance of complex cyanides inthe disk ice. this implies that complex organics accompany simpler volatiles inprotoplanetary disks, and that the rich organic chemistry of the solar nebulawas not unique.

1508.07004	the distribution and chemistry of h$_2$co in the dm tau protoplanetary  disk	h$_2$co ice on dust grains is an important precursor of complex organicmolecules (coms). h$_2$co gas can be readily observed in protoplanetary disksand may be used to trace com chemistry. however, its utility as a com probe iscurrently limited by a lack of constraints on the relative contributions of twodifferent formation pathways: on icy grain-surfaces and in the gas-phase. weuse archival alma observations of the resolved distribution of h$_2$co emissionin the disk around the young low-mass star dm tau to assess the relativeimportance of these formation routes. the observed h$_2$co emission has acentrally peaked and radially broad brightness profile (extending out to 500au). we compare these observations with disk chemistry models with and withoutgrain-surface formation reactions, and find that both gas and grain-surfacechemistry are necessary to explain the spatial distribution of the emission.gas-phase h$_2$co production is responsible for the observed central peak,while grain-surface chemistry is required to reproduce the emission exterior tothe co snowline (where h$_2$co mainly forms through the hydrogenation of co icebefore being non-thermally desorbed). these observations demonstrate that bothgas and grain-surface pathways contribute to the observed h$_2$co in disks, andthat their relative contributions depend strongly on distance from the hoststar.

1508.07296	double dco+ rings reveal co ice desorption in the outer disk around im  lup	in a protoplanetary disk, a combination of thermal and non-thermal desorptionprocesses regulate where volatiles are liberated from icy grain mantles intothe gas phase. non-thermal desorption should result in volatile-enriched gas indisk-regions where complete freeze-out is otherwise expected. we present almaobservations of the disk around the young star im lup in 1.4 mm continuum, c18o2-1, h13co+ 3-2 and dco+ 3-2 emission at ~0".5 resolution. the images of thesedust and gas tracers are clearly resolved. the dco+ line exhibits a strikingpair of concentric rings of emission that peak at radii of ~0".6 and 2" (~90and 300 au, respectively). based on disk chemistry model comparison, the innerdco+ ring is associated with the balance of co freeze-out and thermaldesorption due to a radial decrease in disk temperature. the outer dco+ ring isexplained by non-thermal desorption of co ice in the low-column-density outerdisk, repopulating the disk midplane with cold co gas. the co gas then reactswith abundant h2d+ to form the observed dco+ outer ring. these observationsdemonstrate that spatially resolved dco+ emission can be used to traceotherwise hidden cold gas reservoirs in the outmost disk regions, opening a newwindow onto their chemistry and kinematics.

1509.07520	grain growth in the circumstellar disks of the young stars cy tau and  doar 25	we present new results from the disks@evla program for two young stars: cytau and doar 25. we trace continuum emission arising from their circusmtellardisks from spatially resolved observations, down to tens of au scales, at{\lambda} = 0.9, 2.8, 8.0, and 9.8 mm for doar25 and at {\lambda} = 1.3, 2.8,and 7.1 mm for cy tau. additionally, we constrain the amount of emission whoseorigin is different from thermal dust emission from 5 cm observations. directlyfrom interferometric data, we find that observations at 7 mm and 1 cm traceemission from a compact disk while millimeter-wave observations trace anextended disk structure. from a physical disk model, where we characterize thedisk structure of cy tau and doar 25 at wavelengths shorter than 5 cm, we findthat (1) dust continuum emission is optically thin at the observed wavelengthsand over the spatial scales studied, (2) a constant value of the dust opacityis not warranted by our observations, and (3) a high-significance radialgradient of the dust opacity spectral index, {\beta}, is consistent with theobserved dust emission in both disks, with low-{\beta} in the inner disk andhigh-{\beta} in the outer disk. assuming that changes in dust properties arisesolely due to changes in the maximum particle size (amax), we constrain radialvariations of amax in both disks, from cm-sized particles in the inner disk (r&lt; 40 au) to millimeter sizes in the outer disk (r &gt; 80 au). these observationalconstraints agree with theoretical predictions of the radial-drift barrier,however, fragmentation of dust grains could explain our amax(r) constraints ifthese disks have lower turbulence and/or if dust can survive high-velocitycollisions.

1510.00968	chemical imaging of the co snow line in the hd 163296 disk	the condensation fronts (snow lines) of h2o, co and other abundant volatilesin the midplane of a protoplanetary disk affect several aspects of planetformation. locating the co snow line, where the co gas column density isexpected to drop substantially, based solely on co emission profiles ischallenging. this has prompted an exploration of chemical signatures of cofreeze-out. we present alma cycle 1 observations of the n2h+ j=3-2 and dco+j=4-3 emission lines toward the disk around the herbig ae star hd~163296 at~0.5" (60 au) resolution, and evaluate their utility as tracers of the co snowline location. the n2h+ emission is distributed in a ring with an inner radiusat 90 au, corresponding to a midplane temperature of 25 k. this result isconsistent with a new analysis of optically thin c18o data, which implies asharp drop in co abundance at 90 au. thus n2h+ appears to be a robust tracer ofthe midplane co snow line. the dco+ emission also has a ring morphology, butneither the inner nor the outer radius coincides with the co snow line locationof 90 au, indicative of a complex relationship between dco+ emission and cofreeze-out in the disk midplane. compared to tw hya, co freezes out at a highertemperature in the disk around hd 163296 (25 vs. 17 k in the tw hya disk),perhaps due to different ice compositions. this highlights the importance ofactually measuring the co snow line location, rather than assuming a constantco freeze-out temperature for all disks.

1510.01375	weak turbulence in the hd 163296 protoplanetary disk revealed by alma co  observations	turbulence can transport angular momentum in protoplanetary disks andinfluence the growth and evolution of planets. with spatially and spectrallyresolved molecular emission line measurements provided by (sub)millimeterinterferometric observations, it is possible to directly measure non-thermalmotions in the disk gas that can be attributed to this turbulence. we report anew constraint on the turbulence in the disk around hd 163296, a nearby young astar, determined from alma science verification observations of four coemission lines (the co(3-2), co(2-1), 13co(2-1), and c18o(2-1) transitions).the different optical depths for these lines permit probes of non-thermalline-widths at a range of physical conditions (temperature and density) anddepths into the disk interior. we derive stringent limits on the non-thermalmotions in the upper layers of the outer disk such that any contribution to theline-widths from turbulence is &lt;3% of the local sound speed. these limits areapproximately an order of magnitude lower than theoretical predictions forfull-blown mhd turbulence driven by the magneto-rotational instability,potentially suggesting that this mechanism is less efficient in the outer(r&gt;30au) disk than has been previously considered.

1510.05660	dust evolution can produce scattered light gaps in protoplanetary disks	recent imaging of protoplanetary disks with high resolution and contrast haverevealed a striking variety of substructure. of particular interest are caseswhere near-infrared scattered light images show evidence for low-intensityannular "gaps." the origins of such structures are still uncertain, but theinteraction of the gas disk with planets is a common interpretation. we studythe impact that the evolution of the solid material can have on the observableproperties of disks in a simple scenario without any gravitational orhydrodynamical disturbances to the gas disk structure. even with a smooth andcontinuous gas density profile, we find that the scattered light emissionproduced by small dust grains can exhibit ring-like depressions similar tothose presented in recent observations. the physical mechanisms responsible forthese features rely on the inefficient fragmentation of dust particles. theoccurrence and position of the proposed "gap" features depend most strongly onthe dust-to-gas ratio, the fragmentation threshold velocity, the strength ofthe turbulence, and the age of the disk, and should be generic (at some radius)for typically adopted disk parameters. the same physical processes can affectthe thermal emission at optically thin wavelengths ($\sim$1 mm), although thebehavior can be more complex; unlike for disk-planet interactions, a "gap"should not be present at these longer wavelengths.

1510.08890	resolved millimeter-wavelength observations of debris disks around  solar-type stars	the presence of debris disks around young main sequence stars hints at theexistence and structure of planetary systems. millimeter-wavelengthobservations probe large grains that trace the location of planetesimal belts.the feps (formation and evolution of planetary systems) $spitzer$ legacy surveyof nearby young solar analogues yielded a sample of five debris disk-hostingstars with millimeter flux suitable for interferometric follow-up. we presentobservations with the submillimeter array (sma) and the combined array forresearch in millimeter-wave astronomy (carma) at ~2" resolution that spatiallyresolve the debris disks around these nearby ($d\sim$50 pc) stars. two of thefive disks (hd 377, hd 8907) are spatially resolved for the first time and one(hd 104860) is resolved at millimeter wavelengths for the first time. wecombine our new observations with archival sma and atacama largemillimeter/submillimeter array (alma) data to enable a uniform analysis of thefull five-object sample. we simultaneously model the broad-band photometricdata and resolved millimeter visibilities to constrain the dust temperaturesand disk morphologies, and perform an mcmc analysis to fit for basic structuralparameters. we find that the radii and widths of the cold outer belts exhibitproperties consistent with scaled-up versions of the solar system's kuiperbelt. all the disks exhibit characteristic grain sizes comparable to theblowout size, and all the resolved observations of emission from large dustgrains are consistent with an axisymmetric dust distribution to within theuncertainties. these results are consistent with comparable studies carried outat infrared wavelengths.

1511.07149	resolved gas cavities in transitional disks inferred from co  isotopologues with alma	transitional disks around young stars are promising candidates to look forrecently formed, embedded planets. planet-disk interaction models predict thatplanets clear a gap in the gas while trapping dust at larger radii. otherphysical mechanisms could be responsible for cavities as well. previousobservations have revealed that gas is still present inside these cavities, butthe spatial distribution of this gas remains uncertain. we present high spatialresolution observations with the atacama large millimeter/submillimeter array(alma) of 13co and c18o lines of four well-studied transitional disks. theobservations are used to set constraints on the gas surface density,specifically cavity size and density drop inside the cavity. thephysical-chemical model dali is used to analyze the gas images of sr21,hd135344b, doar44 and irs48. the main parameters of interest are the size,depth and shape of the gas cavity. co isotope-selective photodissociation isincluded to properly constrain the surface density in the outer disk from c18oemission. the gas cavities are up to 3 times smaller than those of the dust inall four disks. model fits indicate that the surface density inside the gascavities decreases by a factor of 100-10000 compared with the surface densityprofile derived from the outer disk. a comparison with an analytical model ofgap depths by planet-disk interaction shows that the disk viscosities arelikely low, with a&lt;1e-3 for planet masses &lt;10 mjup. the resolved measurementsof the gas and dust in transition disk cavities support the predictions ofmodels that describe how planet-disk interactions sculpt gas disk structuresand influence the evolution of dust grains. these observed structures stronglysuggest the presence of giant planetary companions in transition disk cavities,although at smaller orbital radii than is typically indicated from the dustcavity radii alone.

1512.05553	steepening of the 820 micron continuum surface-brightness profile  signals dust evolution in tw hya's disk	grain growth in planet-forming disks is the first step toward the formationof planets. the growth of grains and their inward drift leaves a distinctimprint on the dust surface-density distribution and the resultingsurface-brightness profile of the thermal continuum emission. we determine thesurface-brightness profile of the continuum emission using resolvedobservations at millimeter wavelengths of the disk around tw hya, and infer thesignature of dust evolution on the surface density and dust opacity. archivalalma observations at 820 micron on baselines up to 410 kilolambda are comparedto parametrized disk models to determine the surface-brightness profile. underthe assumption of a constant dust opacity, a broken radial power law bestdescribes the dust surface density, with a slope of -0.53 +/- 0.01 from the 4.1au radius of the (already known) inner hole to a turn-over radius of 47.1 +/-0.2 au, steepening to -8.0 +/- 0.1 at larger radii. the emission drops belowthe detection limit beyond ~60 au. the shape of the dust surface density isconsistent with theoretical expectations for grain growth, fragmentation, anddrift, but its total dust content and its turn-over radius are too large for twhya's age of 8-10 myr even when taking into account a radially varying dustopacity. higher resolution imaging with alma of tw hya and other disks isrequired to establish if unseen gaps associated with, e.g., embedded planetstrap grains at large radii or if locally enhanced grain growth associated withthe co snow line explains the extent of the millimeter-continuum surfacebrightness profile. in the latter case, population studies should reveal acorrelation between the location of the co snow line and the extent of themillimeter continuum. in the former case, and if co freeze out promotes planetformation, this correlation should extend to the location of gaps as well.

0806.4163	submillimeter observations of the young low-mass object iras 04158+2805	we present high spatial resolution submillimeter array observations andsupplementary single-dish photometry of the molecular gas and dust around iras04158+2805, a young source with spectral type m5-m6 in the taurus star-formingregion. a bright, highly elongated dust structure that extends 8" (~1120 au) indiameter is revealed in a 883 micron thermal continuum image. this emissiongeometry is in good agreement with optical observations that show a similarstructure in absorption, aligned perpendicular to bipolar scattered lightnebulae. however, the interferometric data also clearly demonstrate that thesubmillimeter continuum emission is not centrally concentrated, but ratherappears to have a toroidal geometry with substantially lower intensities insidea radius of ~250-300 au. spatially resolved emission from the co j=3-2transition exhibits a velocity gradient along the major axis of the duststructure. if this kinematic pattern is interpreted as the signature ofrotation around a central object, a relatively low mass is inferred (m_star =0.3 m_sun, with a ~50% uncertainty). we discuss several possible explanationsfor the observed gas and dust environment around iras 04158+2805, including aflattened envelope with an outflow cavity and a large circumbinary ring. thissource offers unique views of the gas and dust environment surrounding a younglow-mass stellar system. its properties are generally not commensurate withformation scenarios for such low-mass objects that rely on dynamical ejection,but rather confirms that a single mechanism - molecular cloud core collapse andfragmentation - can produce stars over a wide range of stellar masses (at leastan order of magnitude).

astro-ph;0506187	circumstellar dust disks in taurus-auriga: the submillimeter perspective	we present a sensitive, multiwavelength submillimeter continuum survey of 153young stellar objects in the taurus-auriga star formation region. thesubmillimeter detection rate is 61% to a completeness limit of ~10 mjy(3-sigma) at 850 microns. the inferred circumstellar disk masses arelog-normally distributed with a mean mass of ~0.005 solar masses and a largedispersion (0.5 dex). roughly one third of the submillimeter sources have diskmasses larger than the minimal nebula from which the solar system formed. themedian disk to star mass ratio is 0.5%. the empirical behavior of thesubmillimeter continuum is best described as f_nu ~ nu^(2.0 +/- 0.5) between350 microns and 1.3 mm, which we argue is due to the combined effects of thefraction of optically thick emission and a flatter frequency behavior of theopacity compared to the ism. this latter effect could be due to a substantialpopulation of large dust grains, which presumably would have grown throughcollisional agglomeration. in this sample, the only stellar property that iscorrelated with the outer disk is the presence of a companion. we find evidencefor significant decreases in submillimeter flux densities, disk masses, andsubmillimeter continuum slopes along the canonical infrared spectral energydistribution evolution sequence for young stellar objects. the fraction ofobjects detected in the submillimeter is essentially identical to the fractionwith excess near-infrared emission, suggesting that dust in the inner and outerdisk are removed nearly simultaneously.

astro-ph;0610813	high resolution submillimeter constraints on circumstellar disk  structure	we present a high spatial resolution submillimeter continuum survey of 24circumstellar disks in the tau-aur and oph-sco star formation regions using thesma. in the context of a simple model, we use broadband seds and submillimetervisibilities to derive constraints on some basic parameters that describe thestructure of these disks. for the typical disk in the sample we infer a radialsurface density distribution \sigma ~ r^-p with a median p ~ 0.5, althoughconsideration of the systematic effects of some of our assumptions suggest thatsteeper distributions with p ~ 0.7-1.0 are more reasonable. the distribution ofthe outer radii of these disks shows a distinct peak at r_d = 200 au, with onlya few cases where the disk emission is completely unresolved. based on thesedisk structure measurements, the mass accretion rates, and the typical spectraland spatial distributions of submillimeter emission, we show that theobservations are in good agreement with similarity solutions for steadyaccretion disks that have a viscosity parameter alpha ~ 0.01. we provide newestimates of the spectral dependence of the disk opacity with a median spectralindex of ~0.7, corrected for optically thick emission. this typical value isconsistent with model predictions for the collisional growth of solids tomillimeter size scales in the outer disk. although direct constraints on planetformation in these disks are not currently available, the extrapolated densitydistributions inferred here are substantially shallower than those calculatedbased on the solar system or extrasolar planets and typically used in planetformation models. it is possible that we are substantially underestimating diskdensities due to an incomplete submillimeter opacity prescription.
