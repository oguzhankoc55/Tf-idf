0907.3550	hot horizontal branch stars in omega centauri: clues about their origin  from the cluster color magnitude diagram	we investigate a peculiar feature at the hottest, blue end of the horizontalbranch of galactic globular cluster omega centauri, using the high-precisionand nearly complete catalog that has been constructed from a survey taken withthe acs on board the hst, that covers the inner 10x10 arcminutes. it is adensely populated clump of stars with an almost vertical structure in thef435w-(f435w-f625w) plane, that we termed "blue clump". a comparison withtheoretical models leads to the conclusion that this feature must necessarilyharbor either hot flasher stars, or canonical he-rich stars --progeny of theblue main sequence sub population observed in this cluster-- or a mixture ofboth types, plus possibly a component from the normal-he population hosted bythe cluster. a strong constraint coming from theory is that the mass of theobjects in the "blue clump" has to be very finely tuned, with a spread of atmost only $\sim$0.03mo. by comparing observed and theoretical star counts alongboth the h- and he-burning stages we then find that at least 15% of theexpected he-rich horizontal branch stars are missing from the color-magnitudediagram. this missing population could be the progeny of red giants that failedto ignite central he-burning and have produced he-core white dwarfs. ourconclusion supports the scenario recently suggested by calamida et al. (2008)for explaining the observed ratio of white dwarfs to main sequence stars inomega centauri.

1002.2074	on the delta v_hb_bump parameter in globular clusters	we present new empirical estimates of the delta v_hb_bump parameter for 15galactic globular clusters (ggcs) using accurate and homogeneous ground-basedoptical data. together with similar evaluations available in the literature, weended up with a sample of 62 ggcs covering a very broad range in metal content(-2.16&lt;=[m/h]&lt;=-0.58 dex). adopting the homogeneous metallicity scale providedeither by kraft &amp; ivans (2004) or by carretta et al. (2009), we found that theobserved delta v_hb_bump parameters are larger than predicted. in themetal-poor regime ([m/h]&lt;=-1.7, -1.6 dex) 40% of gcs show discrepancies of2sigma (~0.40 mag) or more. evolutionary models that account either for alpha-and cno-enhancement or for helium enhancement do not alleviate the discrepancybetween theory and observations. the outcome is the same if we use the newsolar heavy-element mixture. the comparison between alpha- and cno-enhancedevolutionary models and observations in the carretta et al. metallicity scalealso indicates that observed delta v_hb_bump parameters, in the metal-richregime ([m/h]=&gt;0), might be systematically smaller than predicted.

1005.1791	a large stellar evolution database for population synthesis studies: vi.  white dwarf cooling sequences	we present a new set of cooling models and isochrones for both h- andhe-atmosphere white dwarfs, incorporating accurate boundary conditions fromdetailed model atmosphere calculations, and carbon-oxygen chemical abundanceprofiles based on updated stellar evolution calculations from the basti stellarevolution archive - a theoretical data center for the virtual observatory. wediscuss and quantify the uncertainties in the cooling times predicted by themodels, arising from the treatment of mixing during the central h- andhe-burning phases, number of thermal pulses experienced by the progenitors,progenitor metallicity and the $^{12}c(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}o$ reaction rate. thelargest sources of uncertainty turn out to be related to the treatment ofconvection during the last stages of the progenitor central he-burning phase,and the $^{12}c(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}o$ reaction rate. we compare our new modelsto previous calculations performed with the same stellar evolution code, anddiscuss their application to the estimate of the age of the solar neighborhood,and the interpretation of the observed number ratios between h- andhe-atmosphere white dwarfs. the new white dwarf sequences and an extensive setof white dwarf isochrones that cover a large range of ages and progenitormetallicities are made publicly available at the official basti website.

1010.3879	lithium abundance in the globular cluster m4: from the turn-off to the  rgb bump	we present li and fe abundances for 87 stars in the gc m4,obtained withgiraffe high-resolution spectra. the targets range from the to up to the rgbbump. the li abundance in the to stars is uniform, with an average valuea(li)=2.30+-0.02 dex,consistent with the upper envelope of li content measuredin other gcs and in the halo stars,confirming also for m4 the discrepancy withthe primordial li abundance predicted by wmap+bbns. the iron content of m4 is[fe/h]=-1.10+-0.01 dex, with no systematic offsets between dwarf and giantstars.the behaviour of the li and fe abundance along the entire evolutionarypath is incompatible with models with atomic diffusion, pointing out that anadditional turbulent mixing below the convective region needs to be taken intoaccount,able to inhibit the atomic diffusion.the measured a(li) and itshomogeneity in the to stars allow to put strong constraints on the shape of theli profile inside the m4 to stars. the global behaviour of a(li) with t_{eff}can be reproduced with different pristine li abundances, depending on the kindof adopted turbulent mixing.one cannot reproduce the global trend starting fromthe wmap+bbns a(li) and adopting the turbulent mixing described by richard etal.(2005) with the same efficiency used by korn et al.(2006) to explain the licontent in ngc6397. such a solution is not able to well reproducesimultaneously the li abundance observed in to and rgb stars.otherwise,thewmap+bbns a(li) can be reproduced assuming a more efficient turbulent mixingable to reach deeper stellar regions where the li is burned. the cosmologicalli discrepancy cannot be easily solved with the present,poor understanding ofthe turbulence in the stellar interiors and a future effort to well understandthe true nature of this non-canonical process is needed.

1103.5863	photometric signatures of multiple stellar populations in galactic  globular clusters	we have calculated synthetic spectra for typical chemical element mixtures(i.e., a standard alpha-enhanced distribution, and distributions displaying cnand ona anticorrelations) found in the various subpopulations harboured bygalactic globular clusters. from the spectra we have determined bolometriccorrections to the standard johnson-cousins and stroemgren filters, and finallypredicted colours. these bolometric corrections and colour-transformations,coupled to our theoretical isochrones with the appropriate chemicalcomposition, provide a complete and self-consistent set of theoreticalpredictions for the effect of abundance variations on the observed cluster cmd.cno abundance variations affect mainly wavelengths shorter than 400 nm, due tothe arise of molecular absorption bands in cooler atmospheres. as aconsequence, colour and magnitude changes are largest in the blue filters,independently of using broad or intermediate bandpasses. colour-magnitudediagrams involving uvy and ub filters (and their various possible colourcombinations) are thus the ones best suited to infer photometrically thepresence of multiple stellar generations in individual clusters. they areparticularly sensitive to variations in the n abundance, with the largestvariations affecting the red giant branch (rgb) and lower main sequence (ms).bvi diagrams are expected to display multiple sequences only if the differentpopulations are characterized by variations of the c+n+o sum and heliumabundance, that lead to changes in luminosity and effective temperature, butleave the flux distribution above 400 nm practically unaffected. a variation ofjust the helium abundance, up to the level we investigate here, affectsexclusively the interior structure of stars, and is largely irrelevant for theatmospheric structure and the resulting flux distribution in the wholewavelength range spanned by our analysis.

1104.1618	chemical abundance anticorrelations in globular cluster stars: the  effect on cluster integrated spectra	it is widely accepted that individual galactic globular clusters harbor twocoeval generations of stars, the first one born with the `standard'$\alpha$-enhanced metal mixture observed in field halo objects, the second onecharacterized by an anticorrelated cn-ona abundance pattern overimposed on thefirst generation, $\alpha$-enhanced metal mixture. we have investigated withappropriate stellar population synthesis models how this second generation ofstars affects the integrated spectrum of a typical metal rich galactic globularcluster, like 47\,tuc, focusing our analysis on the widely used lick-typeindices. we find that the only indices appreciably affected by the abundanceanticorrelations are ca4227, g4300, ${\rm cn_1}$, ${\rm cn_2}$ and nad. theage-sensitive balmer line, fe line and the [mgfe] indices widely used todetermine age, fe and total metallicity of extragalactic systems are largelyinsensitive to the second generation population. enhanced he in secondgeneration stars affects also the balmer line indices of the integratedspectra, through the change of the turn off temperature and -- in theassumption that the mass loss history of both stellar generations is the same-- the horizontal branch morphology of the underlying isochrones.

1107.3016	the white dwarf cooling sequence of ngc 6791: a unique tool for stellar  evolution	ngc 6791 is a well-studied, metal-rich open cluster that is so close to usthat can be imaged down to luminosities fainter than that of the termination ofits white dwarf cooling sequence, thus allowing for an in-depth study of itswhite dwarf population. we use a monte carlo simulator that employs up-to-dateevolutionary cooling sequences for white dwarfs with hydrogen-rich andhydrogen-deficient atmospheres, with carbon-oxygen and helium cores. thecooling sequences for carbon-oxygen cores account for the delays introduced byboth ne^22 sedimentation in the liquid phase and by carbon-oxygen phaseseparation upon crystallization. we do not find evidence for a substantialfraction of helium-core white dwarfs, and hence our results support thesuggestion that the origin of the bright peak of the white dwarf luminosityfunction can only be attributed to a population of unresolved binary whitedwarfs. moreover, our results indicate that the number distribution ofsecondary masses of the population of unresolved binaries has to increase withincreasing mass ratio between the secondary and primary components of theprogenitor system. we also find that the observed cooling sequence appears tobe able to constrain the presence of progenitor sub-populations with differentchemical compositions and the fraction of non-da white dwarfs. our simulationsplace interesting constraints on important characteristics of the stellarpopulations of ngc 6791. in particular, we find that the fraction of singlehelium-core white dwarfs must be smaller than 5%, that a sub-population ofstars with zero metallicity must be &lt;12%, while if the adopted metallicity ofthe sub-population is solar the upper limit is ~8%. finally, we also find thatthe fraction of non-da white dwarfs in this particular cluster is surprinsinglysmall &lt;6%.

1109.4589	giants reveal what dwarfs conceal: li abundance in lower rgb stars as  diagnostic of the primordial li	the discrepancy between cosmological li abundance inferred from population iidwarf stars and that derived from wmap/bbns is still far from being solved.weinvestigated, as an alternative route, the use of li abundances in populationii lower rgb stars as empirical diagnostic of the cosmological li. both theoryand observations suggest that the surface a(li) in red giants after thecompletion of the first dredge-up and before the rgb bump, are significantlyless sensitive to the efficiency of atomic diffusion, compared with dwarfstars. standard stellar models computed under different physical assumptionsshow that the inclusion of the atomic diffusion has an impact of 0.07dex in thedetermination of a(li)0 (much smaller than the case of ms stars) and it isbasically unaffected by reasonable variations of other parameters(overshooting, age,initial y, mixing length). we have determined the surface licontent of 17 halo lower rgb stars,in the metallicity range [fe/h]=-3.4 /-1.4dex. the initial li has then been inferred by accounting for the differencebetween initial and post-dredge up a(li) in the appropriate stellar models. itdepends mainly on the used t(eff) scale and is only weakly sensitive to theefficiency of atomic diffusion,so long as one neglects li destruction caused bythe process competing with atomic diffusion. final a(li)0 span a relativelynarrow range (2.28 /2.46 dex), and is 0.3-0.4 dex lower the wmap/bbnspredictions. these values of a(li)0 are corroborated by the analysis of the gcsngc6397, ngc6752 and m4. our result provides an independent quantitativeestimate of the difference with the big bang value and sets a very robustconstraint for the physical processes invoked to resolve this discrepancy.

1201.1772	the na-o anticorrelation in horizontal branch stars. ii. ngc1851	we studied the na-o anti-correlation from moderately high resolution spectrafor 35 stars on the blue hb (bhb), one rr lyrae, and 55 stars are on the red hb(rhb) of ngc1851. we also derived abundances for he and n in bhb stars, and baand upper limits for n in rhb stars. the rhb stars clearly separate into twogroups: the vast majority are o-rich and na-poor, while about 10-15% arena-rich and moderately o-poor. most na-rich rhb stars are also ba-rich andthere is an overall correlation between na and ba abundances within the rhb.the group of ba-rich rhb stars resides on the warmer edge and includes ~10% ofthe rhb stars. we propose that they are the descendant of the stars on the rgbsequence with very red v-y colour. this sequence is known also to consist of baand perhaps cno-rich stars. however, the upper limit we obtain for n([n/fe]&lt;1.55) for one of the ba-rich stars coupled with the low c-abundancesfor rgb ba-rich stars from the literature suggests that the total cno might notbe particularly high ([(c+n+o)/fe]&lt;=0.15). the other na-rich rhb stars are alsoat the warm edge of the rhb and the only rr lyrae is na-rich and moderatelyo-poor. we also find a na-o anticorrelation among bhb stars, partiallyoverlapping that found among rhb stars, though generally bhb stars are morena-rich and o-poor. however, there is no clear correlation between temperatureand na and o abundances within the bhb. the average he abundance in bhb starsis y=0.29+/-0.05. n abundances are quite uniform at [n/fe]=1.16+/-0.14 amongbhb stars, with a small trend with temperature. this value is consistent withnormal cno abundance and excludes that bhb stars are very cno-rich: this leavesan age spread of ~1.5 gyr as the only viable explanation for the split of thesgb.

1211.2691	on the white dwarf cooling sequence with extremely large telescopes	we present new diagnostics of white dwarf (wd) cooling sequences andluminosity functions (lfs) in the near-infrared (nir) bands that will exploitthe sensitivity and resolution of future extremely large telescopes. thecollision-induced absorption (cia) of molecular hydrogen causes a clearlydefined blue turn-off along the wd (wdbto) cooling sequences and a brightsecondary maximum in the wd lfs. these features are independent of age over abroad age range and are minimally affected by metal abundance. this means thatthe nir magnitudes of the wdbto are very promising distance indicators. theinterplay between the cooling time of progressively more massive wds and theonset of cia causes a red turn-off along the wd (wdrto) cooling sequences and awell defined faint peak in the wd lfs. these features are very sensitive to thecluster age, and indeed the k-band magnitude of the faint peak increases by0.2--0.25 mag/gyr for ages between 10 and 14 gyr. on the other hand, the faintpeak in the optical wd lf increases in the same age range by 0.17 (v band) and0.15 (i band) mag/gyr. moreover, we also suggest to use the difference inmagnitude between the main sequence turn-off and either the wdbto (optical) orthe wdrto (nir). this age diagnostic is also independent of distance andreddening. once again the sensitivity in the k band (0.15-0.20 mag/gyr) is onaverage a factor of two higher than in the optical bands (0.10 [v band], 0.07[i band] mag/gyr). finally, we also outline the use of the new diagnostics toconstrain the co phase separation upon crystallization.

1309.5938	the role of dust in models of population synthesis	we have employed state-of-the-art evolutionary models of low andintermediate-mass agb stars, and included the effect of circumstellar dustshells on the spectral energy distribution (sed) of agb stars, to revise thepadua library of isochrones (bertelli et al. 1994). the major revision involvesthe thermally pulsing agb phase, that is now taken from fully evolutionarycalculations by weiss &amp; ferguson (2009). two libraries of about 600 agbdust-enshrouded seds each have also been calculated, one for oxygen-richm-stars and one for carbon-rich c-stars. each library accounts for differentvalues of input parameters like the optical depth {\tau}, dust composition, andtemperature of the inner boundary of the dust shell. these libraries of dustyagb spectra have been implemented into a large composite library of theoreticalstellar spectra, to cover all regions of the hertzsprung-russell diagram (hrd)crossed by the isochrones. with the aid of the above isochrones and librariesof stellar seds, we have calculated the spectro-photometric properties (seds,magnitudes, and colours) of single-generation stellar populations (ssps) forsix metallicities, more than fifty ages (from 3 myr to 15 gyr), and ninechoices of the initial mass function. the new isochrones and ssps have beencompared to the colour-magnitude diagrams (cmds) of field populations in thelmc and smc, with particular emphasis on agb stars, and the integrated coloursof star clusters in the same galaxies, using data from the sage (surveying theagents of galaxy evolution) catalogues. we have also examined the integratedcolours of a small sample of star clusters located in the outskirts of m31. theagreement between theory and observations is generally good. in particular, thenew ssps reproduce the red tails of the agb star distribution in the cmds offield stars in the magellanic clouds.

1404.6123	lithium and oxygen in globular cluster dwarfs and the early disc  accretion scenario	a new scenario --early disc accretion-- has been recently proposed to explainthe discovery of multiple stellar populations in galactic globular clusters.according to this model, the existence of well defined (anti)-correlationsamongst light element abundances (i.e. c, n, o, na) in the photospheres ofstars belonging to the same cluster (and the associated helium enrichment), iscaused by accretion of the ejecta of short lived interacting massive binarysystems (and single fast rotating massive stars) on fully convective pre-mainsequence low- and very low-mass stars, during the early stages of the clusterevolution. we investigated the constraints provided by consideringsimultaneously the observed spread of lithium and oxygen (and when possiblealso sodium) abundances for samples of turn-off stars in ngc6752, ngc6121 (m4),and ngc104 (47tuc), and the helium abundance of their multiple main sequences.these observations provide a very powerful test for the accretion scenario,because the observed o, li and he abundance distributions at the turn off canbe used to constrain the composition (and mass) of the accreted matter, and thetimescales of the polluting stars. in case of ngc6752 we could not find aphysically consistent solution. in case of m4, spectroscopic errors are toolarge compared to the intrinsic spread, to constrain the properties of theaccreted matter. as for 47tuc, we could find a physically consistent solutionfor the abundances of he and o (and na) in the accreted gas, and predict theabundances of these elements in the accreted matter only if pollution happenswith timescales of ~1 myr, hence polluters are objects with masses of the orderof several tens of solar masses (abridged).

1407.7596	the cosmological lithium problem outside the galaxy: the sagittarius  globular cluster m54	the cosmological li problem is the observed discrepancy between li abundance,a(li), measured in galactic dwarf, old and metal-poor stars (traditionallyassumed to be equal to the initial value a(li)_0), and that predicted bystandard big bang nucleosynthesis calculations (a(li)_{bbn}). here we attackthe li problem by considering an alternative diagnostic, namely the surface liabundance of red giant branch stars that in a colour magnitude diagram populatethe region between the completion of the first dredge-up and the red giantbranch bump. we obtained high-resolution spectra with the flames facility atthe very large telescope for a sample of red giants in the globular clusterm54, belonging to the sagittarius dwarf galaxy. we obtain a(li)=+0.93+-0.11dex, translating -- after taking into account the dilution due to the dredgeup-- to initial abundances (a(li)_0) in the range 2.35--2.29 dex, depending onwhether or not atomic diffusion is considered. this is the first measurement ofli in the sagittarius galaxy and the more distant estimate of a(li)_0 in oldstars obtained so far. the a(li)_0 estimated in m54 is lower by ~0.35 dex thana(li)_{bbn}, hence incompatible at a level of ~3sigma. our result shows thatthis discrepancy is a universal problem concerning both the milky way andextra-galactic systems. either modifications of bbn calculations, or acombination of atomic diffusion plus a suitably tuned additional mixing duringthe main sequence, need to be invoked to solve the discrepancy.

1410.8378	the na-o anticorrelation in horizontal branch stars. v. ngc 6723	we used flames+giraffe (medusa mode) at the vlt to obtain moderately highresolution spectra for 30 red horizontal branch (rhb) stars, 4 rr lyraevariables, and 17 blue horizontal branch (bhb) stars in the low-concentration,moderately metal-rich globular cluster ngc6723 ([fe/h]=-1.22+/-0.08 from ourpresent sample). the spectra were optimized to derive o and na abundances. inaddition, we obtained abundances for other elements, including n, fe, mg, ca,ni, and ba. we used these data to discuss the evidence of a connection betweenthe distribution of stars along the horizontal branch (hb) and the multiplepopulations that are typically present in globular clusters. we found that allrhb and most (13 out of 17) bhb stars are o-rich, na-poor, and n-poor; thesestars probably belong to the first stellar generation in this cluster. only thefour warmest observed stars are (moderately) o-poor, na-rich, and n-rich, andthey probably belong to the second generation. while our sample is not fullyrepresentative of the whole hb population in ngc6723, our data suggest that inthis cluster only hb stars warmer than ~9000 k, that is one fourth of thetotal, belong to the second generation, if at all. since in many other clustersthis fraction is about two thirds, we conclude that the fraction offirst/second generation in globular clusters may be strongly variable. inaddition, the wide range in colour of chemically homogeneous first-generationhb stars requires a considerable spread in mass loss (&gt;0.10 mo). the reason forthis spread is yet to be understood. finally, we found a high ba abundance,with a statistically significant radial abundance gradient.

1412.0627	the temperature distribution of horizontal branch stars: methods and  first results	as part of a large project aimed at characterizing the ultraviolet (uv)properties of globular clusters, we present here a theoretical andobservational analysis aimed at setting the framework for the determination ofhorizontal branch (hb) temperature distributions. indeed this is a crucialinformation to understand the physical parameters shaping the hb morphology inglobular clusters and to interpret the uv emission from unresolved stellarsystems. we found that the use of zero age hb color-teff relations is a robustway to derive effective temperatures of individual hb stars. we investigatedthe most suitable colors for temperature estimates, and the effect on thecolor-teff relations of variations of the initial chemical composition, and ofthe evolution off the zero age horizontal branch. as a test case, we appliedour color-teff calibrations to the galactic globular cluster m15. thephotometry of m15 has been obtained with the wide field and planetary camera 2on board the hst. the hb of m15 turned out to have a multimodal distribution,with a main component peaked at teff~8,000 k and confined below teff~10,000 k.the second component is peaked at teff~14,000 k and extends up to teff~20,000k. the vast majority (~95%) of the hb stars in m15 is below 20,000 k, inagreement with the lack of a well populated extreme hb observed in othermetal-poor globular clusters. we also verified that the temperatures derivedwith our analysis are consistent with spectroscopic estimates available in theliterature.

1505.07128	new insights on the galactic bulge initial mass function	we have derived the galactic bulge initial mass function of the sweeps fieldin the mass range 0.15 $&lt; m/m_{\odot}&lt;$ 1.0, using deep photometry collectedwith the advanced camera for surveys on the hubble space telescope.observations at several epochs, spread over 9 years, allowed us to separate thedisk and bulge stars down to very faint magnitudes, f814w $\sim$ 26 mag, with aproper-motion accuracy better than 0.5 mas/yr. this allowed us to determine theinitial mass function of the pure bulge component uncontaminated by disk starsfor this low-reddening field in the sagittarius window. in deriving the massfunction, we took into account the presence of unresolved binaries, errors inphotometry, distance modulus and reddening, as well as the metallicitydispersion and the uncertainties caused by adopting different theoreticalcolor-temperature relations. we found that the galactic bulge initial massfunction can be fitted with two power laws with a break at m $\sim$ 0.56$m_{\odot}$, the slope being steeper ($\alpha$ = -2.41$\pm$0.50) for the highermasses, and shallower ($\alpha$ = -1.25$\pm$0.20) for the lower masses. in thehigh-mass range, our derived mass function agrees well with the mass functionderived for other regions of the bulge. in the low-mass range however, our massfunction is slightly shallower, which suggests that separating the disk andbulge components is particularly important in the low-mass range. the slope ofthe bulge mass function is also similar to the slope of the mass functionderived for the disk in the high-mass regime, but the bulge mass function isslightly steeper in the low-mass regime. we used our new mass function toderive stellar m/l values for the galactic bulge and we obtained 2.1$&lt;m/l_{f814w}&lt;$ 2.4 and 3.1 $&lt; m/l_{f606w}&lt;$ 3.6 according to differentassumptions on the slope of the imf for masses larger than 1 $m_{\odot}$.

1510.01468	the hubble space telescope uv legacy survey of galactic globular  clusters. v. constraints on formation scenarios	we build on the evidence provided by our legacy survey of galactic globularclusters (gc) to submit to a crucial test four scenarios currently entertainedfor the formation of multiple stellar generations in gcs. the observationalconstraints on multiple generations to be fulfilled are manifold, including gcspecificity, ubiquity, variety, predominance, discreteness, supernovaavoidance, p-capture processing, helium enrichment and mass budget. we arguethat scenarios appealing to supermassive stars, fast rotating massive stars andmassive interactive binaries violate in an irreparable fashion two or moreamong such constraints. also the scenario appealing to agb stars as producersof the material for next generation stars encounters severe difficulties,specifically concerning the mass budget problem and the detailed chemicalcomposition of second generation stars. we qualitatively explore ways possiblyallowing one to save the agb scenario, specifically appealing to a possiblerevision of the cross section of a critical reaction rate destroying sodium, oralternatively by a more extensive exploration of the vast parameter spacecontrolling the evolutionary behavior of agb stellar models. still, we cannotensure success for these efforts and totally new scenarios may have to beinvented to understand how gcs formed in the early universe.

0807.0863	stellar models with the ml2 theory of convection	the mixing length theory (mlt) used to compute the temperature gradient insuperadiabatic layers of stellar (interior and atmosphere) models contains inits standard form 4 free parameters. three parameters are fixed a priori (anddefine what we denote as the mlt 'flavour') whereas one (the so-called mixinglength) is calibrated by reproducing observational constraints. the 'classical'b\"ohm-vitense flavour is used in all modern mlt-based stellar modelcomputations and, despite its crude approximations, the resulting $t_{eff}$scale appears -- perhaps surprisingly -- remarkably realistic, once the mixinglength parameter is calibrated with a solar model. model atmospherecomputations employ parameter choices different from what is used in stellarinterior modelling, raising the question of whether a single mlt flavour andmixing length value can be used to compute interiors and atmospheres of starsof all types. as a first step towards addressing this issue, we study whetherthe mlt flavour (the so-called ml2) and mixing length choice that have beenproven adequate to model white dwarf atmospheres, is able to provide, when usedin stellar models, results at least comparable to the use of the 'classical'b\"ohm-vitense flavour. we have computed solar models and evolutionary tracksfor both low- and intermediate-mass population i and ii stars, adopting bothsolar calibrated b\"ohm-vitense and ml2 flavours of the mlt in our stellarevolution code, and state-of-the-art input physics. the two sets of modelsprovide consistent results, with only minor differences. both calibrationsreproduce also the $t_{eff}$ of red giants in a sample of galactic globularclusters.

astro-ph;0001386	atomic diffusion in metal poor stars. the influence on the main sequence  fitting distance scale, subdwarfs ages and the value of delta y/deltaz	the effect of atomic diffusion on the main sequence (ms) of metal-poor lowmass stars is investigated. since diffusion alters the stellar surface chemicalabundances with respect to their initial values, one must ensure - bycalibrating the initial chemical composition of the theoretical models - thatthe surface abundances of the models match the observed ones of the stellarpopulation under scrutiny. since the observed surface abundances of subdwarfsare different from the initial ones due to the effect of diffusion, while theglobular clusters stellar abundances are measured in red giants, which havepractically recovered their initial abundances after the dredge-up, theisochrones to be employed for studying globular clusters and halo subdwarfswith the same observational value of [fe/h] are different and do not coincide.we find, however,that the current ms-fitting distances derived from hipparcossubdwarfs using colour corrections from standard isochrones are basicallyunaltered when diffusion is taken properly into account; on the other hand, theabsolute ages, the age dispersion, the age-metallicity relation for halosubdwarfs, as well as the value of the helium enrichment ratio delta y/delta zobtained from the width of the empirical halo subdwarfs ms, are allsignificantly modified when the properly calibrated isochrones with diffusionare used.

astro-ph;0007031	the ages of very cool hydrogen-rich white dwarfs	the evolution of white dwarfs is essentially a cooling process that dependsprimarily on the energy stored in their degenerate cores and on thetransparency of their envelopes. in this paper we compute accurate coolingsequences for carbon-oxygen white dwarfs with hydrogen dominated atmospheresfor the full range of masses of interest. for this purpose we use the mostaccurate available physical inputs for both the equation of state and opacitiesof the envelope and for the thermodynamic quantities of the degenerate core. wealso investigate the role of the latent heat in the computed cooling sequences.we present separately cooling sequences in which the effects of phaseseparation of the carbon-oxygen binary mixture upon crystallization have beenneglected, and the delay introduced in the cooling times when this mechanism isproperly taken into account, in order to compare our results with otherpublished cooling sequences which do not include a treatment of thisphenomenon. we find that the cooling ages of very cool white dwarfs with purehydrogen atmospheres have been systematically underestimated by roughly 1.5 gyrat log(l/lo)=-4.5 for an otherwise typical 0.6 mo white dwarf, when phaseseparation is neglected. if phase separation of the binary mixture is includedthen the cooling ages are further increased by roughly 10%. cooling tracks andcooling isochrones in several color-magnitude diagrams are presented as well.

astro-ph;0011299	the lmc eclipsing binary hv 2274 revisited	we reanalyse the uv/optical spectrum and optical broad-band data of theeclipsing binary hv 2274 in the lmc, and derive its distance following themethod given by guinan et al. (1998a,b) of fitting theoretical spectra to thestars' uv/optical spectrum plus optical photometry. we describe the method indetail, pointing out the various assumptions that have to be made; moreover, wediscuss the systematic effects of using different sets of model atmospheres anddifferent sets of optical photometric data. it turns out that differentselections of the photometric data, the set of model atmospheres and theconstraints on the value of the ratio of selective to total extinction in the$v$-band, result in a 25% range in distances (although some of these modelshave a large ${\chi}^2$). for our best choice of these quantities the derivedvalue for the reddening to hv 2274 is e(b-v) = 0.103 $\pm$ 0.007, and thede-reddened distance modulus is dm = 18.46 $\pm$ 0.06; the dm to the center ofthe lmc is found to be 18.42 $\pm$ 0.07. this is significantly larger than thedm of 18.30 $\pm$ 0.07 derived by guinan et al.

astro-ph;0103315	on the white dwarf distances to galactic globular clusters	we analyze in detail various possible sources of systematic errors on thedistances of globular clusters derived by fitting a local template da whitedwarf sequence to the cluster counterpart (the so-called wd-fitting technique).we find that the unknown thickness of the hydrogen layer of white dwarfs inclusters plays a non negligible role. for reasonable assumptions - supported bythe few sparse available observational constraints - about the unknown mass andthickness of the hydrogen layer for the cluster white dwarfs, a realisticestimate of the systematic error on the distance is within +-0.10 mag. however,particular combinations of white dwarf masses and envelope thicknesses - whichat present cannot be excluded a priori - could produce larger errors.contamination of the cluster da sequence by non-da white dwarfs introduces avery small systematic error of about -0.03 mag in the mv/(v-i) plane, but inthe mv/(b-v) plane the systematic error amounts to ~ +0.20 mag. contaminationby white dwarfs with helium cores should not influence appreciably thewd-fitting distances. finally, we obtain a derivative d((m-m)v)/d(e(b-v))~ -5.5for the wd-fitting distances, which is very similar to the dependence foundwhen using the main sequence fitting technique.

astro-ph;0105410	on the helium flash in low-mass population iii red giant stars	we investigate the evolution of initially metal-free, low-mass red giantstars through the he core flash at the tip of the red giant branch. the lowentropy barrier between the helium- and hydrogen-rich layers enables apenetration of the helium flash driven convective zone into the inner tail ofthe extinguishing h-burning shell. as a consequence, protons are mixed intohigh-temperature regions triggering a h-burning runaway. the subsequentdredge-up of matter processed by he and h burning enriches the stellar surfacewith large amounts of helium, carbon and nitrogen. extending previous resultsby hollowell et al. (1990) and fujimoto et al. (2000), who claimed that theh-burning runaway is an intrinsic property of extremely metal-poor low-massstars, we found that its occurrence depends on additional parameters like theinitial composition and the treatment of various physical processes.  we perform some comparisons between predicted surface chemical abundances andobservational measurements for extremely metal-deficient stars. as in previousinvestigations, our results disclose that although the described scenarioprovides a good qualitative agreement with observations, considerablediscrepancies still remain. they may be due to a more complex evolutionary pathof `real' stars, and/or some shortcomings in current evolutionary models.  in addition, we analyze the evolutionary properties after the he core flash,during both the central and shell he-burning phases, allowing us to deduce someinteresting differences between models whose red giant branch progenitor hasexperienced the h-flash and canonical models. in particular, the asymptoticgiant branch evolution of extremely metal-deficient stars and the occurrence ofthermal pulses are strongly affected by the previous rgb evolution.

astro-ph;0110247	the shape of the red giant branch bump as a diagnostic of partial mixing  processes in low-mass stars	we suggest to use the shape of the red giant branch (rgb) bump in metal-richglobular clusters as a diagnostic of partial mixing processes between the baseof the convective envelope and the h-burning shell. the bump located along thedifferential luminosity function of cluster rgb stars is a key observable toconstrain the h-profile inside these structures. in fact, standard evolutionarymodels that account for complete mixing in the convective unstable layers andradiative equilibrium in the innermost regions do predict that the firstdredge-up lefts over a very sharp h-discontinuity at the bottom of theconvective region. interestingly enough we found that both atomic diffusion anda moderate convective overshooting at the base of the convective regionmarginally affects the shape of the rgb bump in the differential luminosityfunction (lf). as a consequence, we performed several numerical experiments toestimate whether plausible assumptions concerning the smoothing of theh-discontinuity, due to the possible occurrence of extra-mixing below theconvective boundary, affects the shape of the rgb bump. we found that thedifference between the shape of rgb bump predicted by standard and by smoothedmodels can be detected if the h-discontinuity is smoothed over an enveloperegion whose thickness is equal or larger than 0.5 pressure scale heights.finally, we briefly discuss the comparison between theoretical predictions andempirical data in metal-rich, reddening free galactic globular clusters (ggcs)to constrain the sharpness of the h-profile inside rgb stars.

astro-ph;0111082	an empirical method to estimate the lmc distance using b-stars in  eclipsing binary systems	we present a new method to determine the distance to b-stars in eclipsingbinary systems. the method is completely empirical, and it is based on theexistence of a very tight linear relationship between the v-band ``zeromagnitude angular diameter'' and the stroemgren colour index c1 for b-stars; wehave empirically calibrated this relationship using local single b-stars withaccurate angular diameters, and b-stars in eclipsing binaries with preciseradii and parallax determinations. by studying the differential behaviour ofthis relationship as predicted by theoretical stellar evolution models, we findthat it is independent of the stellar metallicities for a range of [fe/h]values between the solar one and that of young stars in the magellanic clouds.the method, which also provides the value of the reddening to the system, isdiscussed in detail, together with a thorough estimate of the associatederrors. we conclude that accurate stroemgren photometry obtainable with 1.5m-class telescopes of the lmc eclipsing binaries hv 2274 and hv 982 will allowto obtain an empirical lmc distance with an accuracy of the order of 0.13 mag.

astro-ph;0204410	homogeneous age dating of 55 galactic globular clusters. clues to the  galaxy formation mechanisms	we present homogeneous age determinations for a large sample of 55 galacticglobular clusters, which constitute about 30% of the total galactic population.a study of their age distribution reveals that all clusters from the most metalpoor ones up to intermediate metallicities are coeval, whereas at higher [fe/h]an age spread exists, together with an age-metallicity relationship. at thesame time, all clusters within a certain galactocentric distance appear coeval,whereas an age spread is present further away from the galactic centre, withoutany correlation with distance. the precise value of [fe/h] and galactocentricdistance for the onset of the age spread and the slope of the age-metallicityrelationship are strongly affected by the as yet uncertain [fe/h] scale. wediscuss how differences in the adopted [fe/h] scale and cluster sample size mayexplain discrepant results about the clusters age distribution reached bydifferent authors. taking advantage of the large number of objects included inour sample, we also tested the possibility that age is the global secondparameter which determines the horizontal branch morphology, and foundindications that age could explain the global behaviour of the second parametereffect.

astro-ph;0301378	the initial helium content of galactic globular cluster stars from the  r-parameter: comparison with the cmb constraint	recent precise determinations of the primordial he-abundance (y_p) fromcosmic microwave background (cmb) analyses and cosmological nucleosynthesiscomputations, provide y_p=0.248$\pm$0.001. on the other hand, recent works onthe initial he-abundance of galactic globular cluster (ggc) stars, making useof the r parameter as he-indicator, have consistently obtained$y_{ggc}\sim$0.20.  in light of this serious discrepancy that casts doubt on the adequacy of lowmass he-burning stellar models, we have rederived the initial he-abundance forstars in two large samples of ggcs, by employing theoretical models computedusing new and more accurate determinations of the equation of state for thestellar matter, and of the uncertain $^{12}$c$(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}$o reactionrate. our models include semiconvection during the central convectivehe-burning phase, while the breathing pulses are suppressed, in agreement withthe observational constraints coming from the measurements of the r_2 parameterin a sample of clusters. by taking into account the observational errors on theindividual r-parameter values, as well as uncertainties in the ggc [fe/h]scale, treatment of convection and $^{12}$c$(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}$o reactionrate, we have obtained, respectively, a mean $y_{ggc}$=0.243$\pm$0.006 and$y_{ggc}$=0.244$\pm$0.006 for the two studied ggc samples. these estimates arenow fully consistent with y_p obtained from cmb studies. moreover, the trend ofthe individual he-abundances with respect to [fe/h] is consistent with noappreciable he-enrichment along the ggc metallicity range.

astro-ph;0308431	the red giant branch luminosity function bump	we present observational estimates of the magnitude difference between theluminosity function rgb bump and the hb (delta(bump-zahb)), and of star countsin the bump region (r_bump), for a sample of 54 galactic globular clusters(gcs) observed by the hst. the large sample of stars resolved in each cluster,and the high photometric accuracy of the data allowed us to detect the bumpalso in a number of metal poor clusters. to reduce the photometricuncertainties, empirical values are compared with theoretical predictionsobtained from a set of updated canonical stellar evolution models which havebeen transformed directly into the hst flight system. we found an overallqualitative agreement between theory and observations. quantitative estimatesof the confidence level are hampered by current uncertainties on the gcsmetallicity scale, and by the strong dependence of delta(bump-zahb) on thecluster metallicity. in case of the r_bump parameter, which is only weaklyaffected by the metallicity, we find a very good quantitative agreement betweentheoretical canonical models and observations. for our full cluster sample theaverage difference between predicted and observed r_bump values is practicallynegligible, and ranges from -0.002 to -0.028, depending on the employedmetallicity scale. the observed dispersion around these values is entirelyconsistent with the observational errors on r_bump. as a comparison, the valueof r_bump predicted by theory in case of spurious bump detections would be\~0.10 smaller than the observed ones. we have also tested the influence on thepredicted delta(bump-zahb) and r_bump values of an he-enriched component in thecluster stellar population. we find that the predicted delta(bump-zahb) andr_bump values are only marginally affected.

astro-ph;0308529	the distance to the lmc cluster ngc 1866; clues from the cluster cepheid  population	(abridged) recent investigations aimed at estimating the distance to theyoung lmc cluster ngc1866 have made use of red clump stars in the surroundinglmc field, together with empirical and theoretical main-sequence fittingmethods, and have found significantly different distances for the field and thecluster, the latter being closer by in distance modulus by \delta (dm) \sim0.20 mag. in this paper we (re-)consider the cepheid star population ofngc1866, to try to shed some light on this discrepancy. by combining variousextensive photometric datasets in bvi and single-epoch 2mass jhk photometry, plrelationships for the cluster cepheids are obtained. a comparison between thefield lmc and cluster pl relationships for the reddening free wesenheit indexgives a firm determination of the distance between the cluster and the lmc mainbody (0.04 mag in distance modulus, the cluster being more distant) which,coupled to a model for the geometry of the lmc disk, provides \delta (dm)ranging between 0.0 and -0.11 mag. the simultaneous comparison of the plrelationships in bvi for the cluster and lmc field gives an estimate of thecluster reddening, which results to be e(b-v) = 0.12 \pm 0.02. thisdetermination is higher than the canonical value of 0.06 mag used in allprevious studies, but we show that it is not in contradiction with are-analysis of independent estimates. the cluster main sequence fittingdistance obtained with this new reddening is dm = 18.58 \pm 0.08, fullycompatible with the red clump value of dm = 18.53 \pm0.07(random)^{+0.02}_{-0.05} (systematic) and the cepheid constraint on \delta(dm).

astro-ph;0403600	the initial helium abundance of the galactic globular cluster system	we estimate the initial he content in about 30% of the galactic globularclusters (ggcs) from new star counts we have performed on the recentlypublished hst snapshot database of colour magnitude diagrams (piotto et al.2002). more in detail, we use the so-called $r$-parameter and estimate the hecontent from a calibration based on a recently updated set of stellar models.we performed an accurate statistical analysis in order to assess whether ggcsshow a statistically significant spread in their initial he abundances, andwhether there is a correlation with the metallicity. we do not find anysignificant dependence of the he abundance on the gc metallicity; this providesan important constraint for models of galaxy formation and evolution. apartfrom ggcs with the bluest hb morphology, the observed spread in the individualhe abundances is statistically compatible with the individual errors. thismeans that either there is no intrinsic he spread among the ggcs, or that thisis masked by the errors. in the latter case we have estimated a firm 1$\sigma$upper limit of 0.019 to the possible intrinsic spread. in case of the ggcs withthe bluest hb morphology we detect a significant spread towards higherabundances inconsistent with the individual errors. in the hypothesis that theintrinsic dispersion on the individual he abundances is zero, taking intoaccount the errors on the individual r-parameter estimates, as well as theuncertainties on the ggc [m/h] scale and theoretical calibration, we havedetermined an initial he abundance y(ggc)=0.250\pm0.006 a value in perfectagreement with current estimates based on cmb radiation analyses andcosmological nucleosynthesis computations.

astro-ph;0405193	a large stellar evolution database for population synthesis studies. i.  scaled solar models and isochrones	we present a large and updated stellar evolution database for low-,intermediate- and high-mass stars in a wide metallicity range, suitable forstudying galactic and extragalactic simple and composite stellar populationsusing population synthesis techniques. the stellar mass range is between\sim0.5mo and 10mo with a fine mass spacing. the metallicity [fe/h] comprises10 values ranging from -2.27 to 0.40, with a scaled solar metal distribution.the initial he mass fraction ranges from y=0.245, for the more metal-poorcomposition, up to 0.303 for the more metal-rich one, with delta y/delta z\sim1.4. for each adopted chemical composition, the evolutionary models have beencomputed without and with overshooting from the schwarzschild boundary of theconvective cores during the central h-burning phase. the whole set ofevolutionary models can be used to compute isochrones in a wide age range, from\sim30 myr to \sim15gyr. both evolutionary tracks and isochrones are availablein several observational planes, employing updated set of bolometriccorrections and color-te relations computed for this project. the number ofpoints along the models and the resulting isochrones is selected in such a waythat interpolation for intermediate metallicities not contained in the grid isstraightforward. we compare our isochrones with results from different stellarevolution databases and perform some empirical tests for the reliability of ourmodels. since this work is devoted to scaled solar compositions, we focus ourattention on the galactic disk populations, employing multicolor photometry ofunevolved field ms stars with precise hipparcos parallaxes, well-studied openclusters and one eclipsing binary system with precise measurements of masses,radii and [fe/h] of both components.

astro-ph;0409362	the distance to the pleiades: main sequence fitting in the near infrared	hipparcos parallax measurements of stars in the pleiades notoriously resultin a cluster distance of 118 pc; ~10% shorter than the `classical' results ofms-fitting. in an earlier paper we developed a purely empirical ms-fittingmethod to address this problem, which produced conflicting results between the(b-v) and (v-i) colour indices, indicating that the cluster's photometricmetallicity is substantially lower than its (~solar) spectroscopic metallicity.we were able to reconcile the discrepancy by assuming [fe/h]=-0.4 (as indicatedfrom (b-v)/(v-i) colour-colour plots), and the distance moduli obtained fromthe 2 indices were in agreement with the hipparcos result, within the 1sigerrors. with the release of the 2mass all sky catalogue, we now apply ourms-fitting method to the pleiades using the infrared colours, in order to testthe plausibility of our earlier result. fitting in the v/(v-k) and k/(j-k)colour planes, we find that assuming a subsolar metallicity does not producedistances in agreement with the (b-v) and (v-i) results. however the infraredplus (v-i) distances are in mutual agreement when adopting the spectroscopicmetallicity. by considering only stars with mv&lt;=6, the infrared and opticalcolour indices all yield consistent distances using the spectroscopic [fe/h].the concordant distances thus obtained from the (b-v), (v-i), (v-k) and (j-k)indices yield a mean of 133.8+/-3 pc, in excellent agreement with thepre-hipparcos ms-fitting results, and the most recent determinations from othermethods. we conclude that there are two distinct issues affecting the pleiades:the hipparcos parallax is in error by ~10%, as previously claimed; the (b-v)colours of the lower ms are anomalous, and we caution against their use forms-fitting to the pleiades and similarly young open clusters.

astro-ph;0503594	galactic globular cluster relative ages. ii	we present accurate relative ages for a sample of 55 galactic globularclusters. the ages have been obtained by measuring the difference between thehorizontal branch and the turnoff in two, internally photometricallyhomogeneous databases. the mutual consistency of the two data sets has beenassessed by comparing the ages of 16 globular clusters in common between thetwo databases. we have also investigated the consistency of our relative agedetermination within the recent stellar model framework. all clusters with[fe/h]&lt;-1.7 are found to be old, and coeval, with the possible exception of twoobjects, which are marginally younger. the age dispersion for the metal poorclusters is 0.6 gyr (rms), consistent with a null age dispersion. intermediatemetallicity clusters (-1.7&lt;[fe/h]&lt;-0.8) are on average 1.5 gyr younger than themetal poor ones, with an age dispersion of 1.0 gyr (rms), and a total age rangeof ~3 gyr. about 15% of the intermediate metallicity clusters are coeval withthe oldest clusters. all the clusters with [fe/h]&gt;-0.8 are ~1 gyr younger thanthe most metal poor ones, with a relatively small age dispersion, though themetal rich sample is still too small to allow firmer conclusions. there is nocorrelation of the cluster age with the galactocentric distance. we brieflydiscuss the implication of these observational results for the formationhistory of the galaxy.

astro-ph;0512295	optical/near-infrared colours of early-type galaxies and constraints on  their star formation histories	(abridged) we introduce and discuss the properties of a theoretical(b-k)-(j-k) integrated colour diagram for single-age, single-metallicitystellar populations. this combination of integrated colours is able to largelydisentangle the well known age-metallicity degeneracy when the age of thepopulation is greater than ~300 myr. we discuss in detail the effect on thiscolour-colour diagram of alpha-enhanced metal abundance ratios, the presence ofblue horizontal branch stars unaccounted for in the theoretical calibration,and of statistical colour fluctuations in low mass stellar systems. in the caseof populations with multiple stellar generations, the luminosity-weighted meanage obtained from this diagram is shown to be heavily biased towards theyoungest stellar components. we apply this method to several datasets for whichoptical and near-ir photometry are available in the literature. for the twolocal group dwarf galaxies ngc185 and ngc6822, the mean ages derived from theintegrated colours are consistent with the star formation histories inferredindependently from photometric observations of their resolved stellarpopulations. a sample of bright field and virgo cluster elliptical galaxies isfound to exhibit a range of luminosity-weighted mean ages from 3 to 14 gyr,with a mean of 8 gyr, independent of environment, and mean metallicities at orjust above the solar value. colour gradients are found in all of the galaxiesstudied, in the sense that central regions are redder. aperture data for fivevirgo early-type dwarf galaxies show that these galaxies appear to be shiftedto lower mean metallicities and lower mean ages (range 1 to 6 gyr) than theirhigher luminosity counterparts.

astro-ph;0603721	a large stellar evolution database for population synthesis studies. ii.  stellar models and isochrones for an alpha-enhanced metal distribution	[abridged] we present a large, new set of stellar evolution models andisochrones for an alpha-enhanced metal distribution typical of galactic haloand bulge stars; it represents a homogeneous extension of our stellar modellibrary for a distribution already presented in pietrinferni et al.(2004). theeffect of the alpha-element enhancement has been properly taken into account inthe nuclear network, opacity, equation of state and, for the first time, thebolometric corrections, and color transformations. this allows us to avoid theinconsistent use - common to all alpha-enhanced model libraries currentlyavailable - of scaled-solar bolometric corrections and color transformationsfor alpha-enhanced models and isochrones. we show how bolometric corrections tomagnitudes obtained for the u,b portion of stellar spectra for t_{eff}&lt;=6500k,are significantly affected by the metal mixture, especially at the highermetallicities. we also provide complete sets of evolutionary models forlow-mass, he-burning stellar structures covering the whole metallicity range,to enable synthetic horizontal branch simulations. we compare our database withseveral widely used stellar model libraries from different authors, as well aswith various observed color magnitude and color-color diagrams (johnson-cousinsbvi and near infrared magnitudes, stromgren colors) of galactic field stars andglobular clusters. we also test our isochrones comparing integrated opticalcolors and surface brightness fluctuation magnitudes with selected globularcluster data. we find a general satisfactory agreement with the empiricalconstraints.

astro-ph;0605666	alpha-element enhanced opacity tables and low-mass metal-rich stellar  models	we investigate the influence of both a new generation of low-temperatureopacities and of various amounts of alpha-element enhancements on stellarevolution models. new stellar models with two different alpha-element mixturesand two sets of appropriate opacity tables are computed and compared. theinfluence of the different mixtures as well as that of the improved generationof opacity tables is investigated. it is found that around solar metallicitythe new opacity tables have a drastic influence on stellar temperatures, whichis mainly an effect of the new low-temperature tables, and not of variations inalpha-element enhancement factors. the latter, however, influence stellarlifetimes via systematic opacity effects at core temperatures. we trace thereason for the low-temperature table changes to errors in the old tables. weconclude that variations in alpha-element abundance ratios affect themain-sequence properties of super-solar metallicity stars significantly. redgiant branch effective temperatures depend only slightly on the specificmixture. our older low-temperature opacity tables were shown to be erroneousand should no longer be used for stellar models with near- or super-solarmetallicity. corrected tables have already been produced.

astro-ph;9702029	a critical investigation on the discrepancy between the observational  and theoretical red giant luminosity function "bump"	new theoretical evaluations of the rgb luminosity function 'bump' and thezahb luminosity covering the range of metallicities typical of galacticglobular cluster are presented. the variation of the theoretical rgb bump andzahb levels due to the metallicity, original helium content, mixing lengthvalue, age, mass loss, bolometric corrections, opacities and equation of stateadopted in the evolutionary models is also discussed. these new prescriptionshave been taken into account for casting light on a longstanding astrophysicalproblem connected with the red giant branch evolutionary phase, namely thediscrepancy between the observational and the theoretical luminosity of rgbbump. a sample of globular clusters with accurate evaluations of the bumpluminosity and spectroscopical metallicity determinations has been selected.the zero age horizontal branch luminosity at the rr-lyrae instability strip hasbeen evaluated as accurately as possible, and the observational luminositydifference between the rgb bump and the zahb has been compared with thetheoretical values. it is shown that there is no significant disagreementbetween observations and canonical stellar models. the possible applications ofthis result are also briefly discussed.

astro-ph;9805127	fine structure of the red giant clump from hipparcos data, and distance  determinations based on its mean magnitude	the i-band brightness of clump stars has been used recently to determine thedistance to the bulge, the lmc and smc, and to m31. it was assumed to be astandard candle based on the observational fact that it is independent of(v-i)-colour in all observed populations. the calibration was done using nearbyclump stars with hipparcos-parallaxes. the most surprising result of thisprocedure was the claim that the distance to the lmc was only 18.04 mag. in thepresent paper we show that with a population synthesis approach we canreproduce the constancy of m_i with colour for the local hipparcos clumpsample. nevertheless, m_i is not a constant among different populations, butdepends on metallicity. as a result, the determined distance modulus to the lmcof 18.28+-0.18 mag is in better agreement with standard values. this resolves,at least partially, the controversial result obtained by the assumption of auniversal value for m_i. we also find and discuss substructures in the clump:we predict that stars slightly heavier than the maximum mass for developingdegenerate he cores should define a secondary, clumpy structure, about 0.3 magbelow the bluest extremity of the red clump. this secondary clump can beclearly identified in the hipparcos database of stars. we argue that thereremain severe uncertainties in the use of clump stars as a distance indicator.

(1998a) derived by employingthe method of statistical parallax for the {\it identical} sample and using thesame slope.  we point out that a similar difference exists between the ``reducedparallaxes'' method and the statistical parallax method for the cepheids in thehipparcos catalogue.  we also determine the zero point for the $m_{\rm k}$-$\log p_{0}$ relation,and obtain a value of -1.16 $\pm$ 0.27 mag (for a slope of -2.33). the distancemoduli to the hipparcos rr lyrae stars derived from the two relations agreewell.  the derived distance scale is in good agreement with the results from themain sequence fitting distances of galactic globular clusters and with theresults of theoretical horizontal branch models, and implies a distance modulusto the lmc of 18.61 $\pm$ 0.28 mag.
