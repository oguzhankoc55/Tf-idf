0906.2536	abundant circumstellar silica dust and sio gas created by a giant  hypervelocity collision in the ~12 myr hd172555 system	the fine dust detected by ir emission around the nearby beta pic analoguestar hd172555 is very peculiar. the dust mineralogy is composed primarily ofhighly refractory, non-equilibrium materials, with approximately three-quartersof the si atoms in silica (sio2) species. tektite and obsidian lab thermalemission spectra (non-equilibrium glassy silicas found in impact and magmaticsystems) are required to fit the data. the best-fit model size distribution forthe observed fine dust is dn/da = a-3.95 +/- 0.10. this steep a sizedistribution, with abundant micron-sized particles, argues for a fresh sourceof material within the last 0.1 myr. the location of the dust with respect tothe star is at 5.8 +/- 0.6 au (equivalent to 1.9 +/- 0.2 au from the sun),within the terrestrial planet formation region but at the outer edge of anypossible terrestrial habitability zone. the mass of fine dust is 4 x 10^19 - 2x 10^20 kg, equivalent to a 150 - 200 km radius asteroid. significant emissionfeatures centered at 4 and 8 um due to fluorescing sio gas are also found.roughly 10^22 kg of sio gas, formed by vaporizing silicate rock, is alsopresent in the system, and a separate population of very large, cool grains,massing 10^21 - 10^22 kg and equivalent to the largest sized asteroid currentlyfound in the solar system's main asteroid belt, dominates the solidcircumstellar material by mass. the makeup of the observed dust and gas, andthe noted lack of a dense circumstellar gas disk, strong primary x-rayactivity, or an extended disk of beta-meteroids argues that the source of theobserved circumstellar materials is a giant hypervelocity (&gt; 10 km sec^-1)impact between large rocky planetesimals, similar to the ones which formed themoon and which stripped the surface crustal material off of mercury's surface.

0906.3704	resolving the hot dust around hd69830 and eta corvi with midi and visir	most of the known debris discs exhibit cool dust in regions analogous to theedgeworth-kuiper belt. however, a rare subset show hot excess from within a fewau, which is often inferred to be transient. we examine 2 such sources to placelimits on their location to help distinguish between different interpretationsfor their origin. we use midi on the vlti to observe the debris discs aroundeta corvi and hd69830 using baseline lengths from 44-130m. new visirobservations of hd69830 at 18.7um are also presented. these observations arecompared with disc models to place limits on disc size. the visibilityfunctions measured with midi for both sources show significant variation withwavelength across 8-13um in a manner consistent with the disc flux being wellresolved, notably with a dip at 10-11.5um due to the silicate emission feature.the average ratio of visibilities measured between 10-11.5um and 8-9um is0.934+/-0.015 for hd69830 and 0.880+/-0.013 for eta corvi over the 4 baselinesfor each source, a departure of 4 and 9sigma from that expected if the discswere unresolved. hd69830 is unresolved by visir at 18.7um. the combined limitsfrom midi and 8m imaging constrain the warm dust to lie within 0.05-2.4au forhd69830 and 0.16-2.98au for eta corvi. these results represent the firstresolution in the mid-ir of dust around main sequence stars. the constraintsplaced on the location of the dust are consistent with radii predicted by sedmodelling. tentative evidence for a common position angle for the dust at 1.7auwith that at 150au around eta corvi, which might be expected if the hot dust isfed from the outer disc, demonstrates the potential of this technique forconstraining the origin of the dust and more generally for the study of dust inthe terrestrial regions of main sequence stars.

0707.0489	an unbiased survey of 500 nearby stars for debris disks: a jcmt legacy  program	we present the scientific motivation and observing plan for an upcomingdetection survey for debris disks using the james clerk maxwell telescope. thescuba-2 unbiased nearby stars (suns) survey will observe 500 nearby mainsequence and sub-giant stars (100 of each of the a, f, g, k and m spectralclasses) to the 850 micron extragalactic confusion limit to search for evidenceof submillimeter excess, an indication of circumstellar material. the surveydistance boundaries are 8.6, 16.5, 22, 25 and 45 pc for m, k, g, f and a stars,respectively, and all targets lie between the declinations of -40 deg to 80deg. in this survey, no star will be rejected based on its inherent properties:binarity, presence of planetary companions, spectral type or age. this will bethe first unbiased survey for debris disks since iras. we expect to detect ~125debris disks, including ~50 cold disks not detectable in current shorterwavelength surveys. a substantial amount of complementary data will be requiredto constrain the temperatures and masses of discovered disks. high resolutionstudies will likely be required to resolve many of the disks. therefore, thesesystems will be the focus of future observational studies using a variety ofobservatories to characterize their physical properties. for non-detectedsystems, this survey will set constraints (upper limits) on the amount ofcircumstellar dust, of typically 200 times the kuiper belt mass, but as low as10 times the kuiper belt mass for the nearest stars in the sample(approximately 2 pc).

0910.4725	collisional evolution of eccentric planetesimal swarms	models for the steady state collisional evolution of low eccentricityplanetesimal belts identify debris disks with hot dust at 1au, like eta corviand hd69830, as anomalous since collisional processing should have removed mostof the planetesimal mass over their &gt;1 gyr lifetimes. this paper looks at theeffect of large planetesimal eccentricities (e&gt;&gt;0.3) on their collisionallifetime and the amount of mass that can remain at late times m_{late}. for anaxisymmetric planetesimal disk with common pericentres and eccentricities e, wefind that m_{late} \propto e^{-5/3}(1+e)^{4/3}(1-e)^{-3}. for a scattereddisk-like population (i.e., common pericentres), in the absence of dynamicalevolution, the mass evolution at late times would be as if only planetesimalswith the largest eccentricity were present. despite the increased remainingmass, higher eccentricities do not increase the hot emission from thecollisional cascade until e&gt;0.99, partly because most collisions occur nearpericentre thus increasing the dust blow-out diameter. however, at higheccentricities (e&gt;0.97) the blow-out population extending out from pericentremay be detectable above the collisional cascade; higher eccentricities alsoincrease the probability of witnessing a recent collision. all of the imagingand spectroscopic constraints for eta corvi can be explained with a singleplanetesimal population with pericentre at 0.75au, apocentre at 150au, and mass5m_\oplus; however, the origin of such a high eccentricity population remainschallenging. the mid-ir excess to hd69830 can be explained by the ongoingdestruction of a debris belt produced in a recent collision in an eccentricplanetesimal belt, but the lack of far-ir emission requires small bound grainsto be absent from the parent planetesimal belt, possibly due to sublimation.

0707.2733	origin of the metallicity dependence of exoplanet host stars in the  protoplanetary disk mass distribution	the probability of a star hosting a planet that is detectable in radialvelocity surveys increases ppl(z) oc 10^2z, where z is metallicity. coreaccretion models reproduce this trend, since the protoplanetary disk of a highmetallicity star has a high density of solids and so forms cores which accretegas before the primordial gas disk dissipates. this paper considers the originof the form of ppl(z). we introduce a simple model in which detectable planetsform when the mass of solids in the protoplanetary disk, ms, exceeds a criticalvalue. in this model the form of ppl(z) is a direct reflection of thedistribution of protoplanetary disk masses, mg, and the observed ppl(z) isreproduced if p(mg&gt;mg') oc 1/mg'^2. we argue that a protoplanetary disk'ssub-mm dust mass is a pristine indicator of the mass available forplanet-building and find the observed sub-mm disk mass distribution isconsistent with the observed ppl(z) if ms&gt;0.5m_j is required to form detectableplanets. any planet formation model which imposes a critical solid mass forplanet formation would reproduce the observed ppl(z), and core accretion modelsare empirically consistent with a threshold criterion. we identify 7protoplanetary disks which, by rigid application of this criterion, would beexpected to form detectable planets. a testable prediction is that ppl(z)should flatten both for z&gt;0.5dex and as more distant and lower mass planets arediscovered. further, combining this model with one in which the evolution of astar's debris disk is also influenced by the solid mass in its protoplanetarydisk, results in the prediction that debris disks detected around stars withplanets should be more infrared luminous than those around stars withoutplanets in tentative agreement with recent observations.

1002.3469	are debris disks self-stirred?	this paper considers the evidence that debris disks are self-stirred by theformation of plutos. a model for the dust produced during self-stirring isapplied to statistics for a stars. as there is no significant differencebetween excesses of a-stars &lt;50myr old, we focus on reproducing the broadtrends, the "rise and fall" of the fraction of stars with excesses. using apopulation model, we find that the statistics and trends can be reproduced witha self-stirring model of planetesimal belts with radii distributed between15-120au. disks must have this 15au minimum radius to show a peak in diskfraction, rather than a monotonic decline. populations of extended disks withfixed inner and/or outer radii fail to fit the statistics, due mainly to theslow 70um evolution as stirring moves further out in the disk. this conclusion,that debris disks are narrow belts, is independent of the significance of 24umtrends for young a-stars. we show that the statistics can also be reproducedwith a model in which disks are stirred by secular perturbations from a nearbyeccentric planet. detailed imaging is therefore the best way to characterisethe stirring mechanism. from a more detailed look at beta pictoris moving groupand tw hydrae association a-stars we find that the disk around beta pictoris islikely the result of secular stirring by the proposed planet at ~10au; thestructure of the hr 4796a disk also points to sculpting by a planet. the twoother stars with disks, hr 7012 and eta tel, possess transient hot dust, thoughthe outer eta tel disk is consistent with a self-stirred origin. planetformation provides a natural explanation for the belt-like nature of debrisdisks, with inner regions cleared by planets that may also stir the disk, andthe outer edges set by where planetesimals can form.

1007.4517	post-main sequence evolution of a star debris discs	while the population of main sequence debris discs is well constrained,little is known about debris discs around evolved stars. this paper provides atheoretical framework considering the effects of stellar evolution on debrisdiscs, particularly the production and loss of dust within them. here we repeata steady state model fit to disc evolution statistics for main sequence astars, this time using realistic grain optical properties, then evolve thatpopulation to consider its detectability at later epochs. our model predictsthat debris discs around giant stars are harder to detect than on the mainsequence because radiation pressure is more effective at removing small dustaround higher luminosity stars. just 12% of first ascent giants within 100pcare predicted to have discs detectable with herschel at 160um. however this issubject to the uncertain effect of sublimation on the disc, which we proposecan thus be constrained with such observations. our model also finds that therapid decline in stellar luminosity results in only very young white dwarfshaving luminous discs. as such systems are on average at larger distances theyare hard to detect, but we predict that the stellar parameters most likely toyield a disc detection are a white dwarf at 200pc with cooling age of 0.1myr,in line with observations of the helix nebula. our model does not predictclose-in (&lt;0.01au) dust, as observed for some white dwarfs, however we findthat stellar wind drag leaves significant mass (~10^{-2}msolar), in bodies upto ~10m in diameter, inside the disc at the end of the agb phase which mayreplenish these discs.

1102.4341	steady-state evolution of debris disks around solar-type stars	we present an analysis of debris disk data around solar-type stars (spectraltypes f0-k5) using the steady-state analytical model of wyatt et al. (2007).models are fitted to published data from the feps (meyer et al. 2006) projectand various gto programs obtained with mips on the spitzer space telescope at24 micron and 70 micron, and compared to a previously published analysis ofdebris disks around a stars using the same evolutionary model. we find that themodel reproduces most features found in the data sets, noting that the modeldisk parameters for solar-type stars are different to those of a stars.although this could mean that disks around solar-type stars have differentproperties from their counterparts around earlier-type stars, it is alsopossible that the properties of disks around stars of different spectral typesappear more different than they are because the blackbody disk radiusunderestimates the true disk radius by a factor $x_r$ which varies withspectral type. we use results from realistic grain modelling to quantify thiseffect for solar-type stars and for a stars. our results imply thatplanetesimals around solar-type stars are on average larger than around a starsby a factor of a few but that the mass of the disks are lower for disks aroundfgk stars, as expected. we also suggest that discrepancies between theevolutionary timescales of 24 micron statistics predicted by our model and thatobserved in previous surveys could be explained by the presence oftwo-component disks in the samples of those surveys, or by transient eventsbeing responsible for the 24 micron emission of cold disks beyond a few myr.further study of the prevalence of two component disks, and of constraints on$x_r$, and increasing the size of the sample of detected disks, are importantfor making progress on interpreting the evolution of disks around solar-typestars.

1107.0316	multi-wavelength modelling of the beta leo debris disc: 1, 2 or 3  planetesimal populations?	in this paper we present a model of the beta leo debris disc, with anemphasis on modelling the resolved pacs images obtained as part of the herschelkey programme debris. we also present new spire images of the disc at 250microns, as well as new constraints on the disc from scuba-2, mid-ir andscattered light imaging. combining all available observational constraints, wefind three possible models for the beta leo (hd102647) debris disc: (i) a 2component model, comprised of a hot component at 2 au and a cold component from15-70 au. (ii) a 3 component model with hot dust at 2 au, warm dust at 9 au,and a cold component from 30-70 au, is equally valid since the cold emission isnot resolved within 30 au. (iii) a somewhat less likely possibility is that thesystem consists of a single very eccentric planetesimal population, withpericentres at 2 au and apocentres at 65 au. thus, despite the wealth ofobservational constraints significant ambiguities remain; deep mid-ir andscattered light imaging of the dust distribution within 30 au seems the mostpromising method to resolve the degeneracy. we discuss the implications for thepossible planetary system architecture; e.g., the 2 component model suggestsplanets may exist at 2-15 au, while the 3 component model suggests planetsbetween 2-30 au with a stable region containing the dust belt at 9 au, andthere should be no planets between 2-65 au in the eccentric planetesimal model.we suggest that the hot dust may originate in the disintegration of cometsscattered in from the cold disc, and examine all a stars known to harbour bothhot and cold dust to consider the possibility that the ratio of hot and colddust luminosities is indicative of the intervening planetary systemarchitecture.

0710.0839	circumstellar dust created by terrestrial planet formation in hd 113766	we present an analysis of the gas-poor circumstellar material in the hd113766 binary system (f3/f5, 10 - 16 myr), recently observed by the spitzerspace telescope. for our study we have used the infrared mineralogical modelderived from observations of the deep impact experiment. we find the dustdominated by warm, fine (~1 um) particles, abundant in mg-rich olivine,crystalline pyroxenes, amorphous silicates, fe-rich sulfides, amorphous carbon,and colder water-ice. the warm dust material mix is akin to an inner main beltasteroid of s-type composition. the ~440 k effective temperature of the warmdust implies that the bulk of the observed material is in a narrow belt ~1.8 aufrom the 4.4 l_solar central source, in the terrestrial planet-forming regionand habitable zone of the system (equivalent to 0.9 au in the solar system).the icy dust lies in 2 belts, located at 4-9 au and at 30 - 80 au. the lowerbound of warm dust mass in 0.1 - 20 um, dn/da ~ a^-3.5 particles is very large,at least 3 x 10^20 kg, equivalent to a 320 km radius asteroid of 2.5 g cm^-3density. assuming 10m largest particles present, the lower bound of warm dustmass is at least 0.5 m_mars the dust around hd 113766a originates fromcatastrophic disruption of terrestrial planet embryo(s) and subsequent grindingof the fragments, or from collisions in a young, extremely dense asteroid beltundergoing aggregation. the persistence of the strong ir excess over the lasttwo decades argues for a mechanism to provide replenishment of thecircumstellar material on yearly timescales.

1108.4704	multi-epoch observations of hd69830: high resolution spectroscopy and  limits to variability	the main-sequence solar-type star hd69830 has an unusually large amount ofdusty debris orbiting close to three planets found via the radial velocitytechnique. in order to explore the dynamical interaction between the dust andplanets, we have performed multi-epoch photometry and spectroscopy of thesystem over several orbits of the outer dust. we find no evidence for changesin either the dust amount or its composition, with upper limits of 5-7% (1$\sigma$ per spectral element) on the variability of the {\it dust spectrum}over 1 year, 3.3% (1 $\sigma$) on the broad-band disk emission over 4 years,and 33% (1 $\sigma$) on the broad-band disk emission over 24 years. detailedmodeling of the spectrum of the emitting dust indicates that the dust islocated outside of the orbits of the three planets and has a compositionsimilar to main-belt, c-type asteroids asteroids in our solar system.additionally, we find no evidence for a wide variety of gas species associatedwith the dust. our new higher snr spectra do not confirm our previously claimeddetection of h$_2$o ice leading to a firm conclusion that the debris can beassociated with the break-up of one or more c-type asteroids formed in the dry,inner regions of the protoplanetary disk of the hd69830 system. the modeling ofthe spectral energy distribution and high spatial resolution observations inthe mid-infrared are consistent with a $\sim$ 1 au location for the emittingmaterial.

1110.4172	spitzer evidence for a late heavy bombardment and the formation of  urelites in {\eta} corvi at ~1 gyr	we have analyzed spitzer and nasa/irtf 2 - 35 \mum spectra of the warm, ~350k circumstellar dust around the nearby ms star {\eta} corvi (f2v, 1.4 \pm 0.3gyr). the spectra show clear evidence for warm, water- and carbon-rich dust at~3 au from the central star, in the system's terrestrial habitability zone.spectral features due to ultra-primitive cometary material were found, inaddition to features due to impact produced silica and high temperaturecarbonaceous phases. at least 9 x 10^18 kg of 0.1 - 100 \mum warm dust ispresent in a collisional equilibrium distribution with dn/da ~ a^-3.5, theequivalent of a 130 km radius kbo of 1.0 g/cm^3 density and similar to recentestimates of the mass delivered to the earth at 0.6 - 0.8 gyr during the lateheavy bombardment. we conclude that the parent body was a kuiper-belt body orbodies which captured a large amount of early primitive material in the firstmyrs of the system's lifetime and preserved it in deep freeze at ~150 au. at~1.4 gyr they were prompted by dynamical stirring of their parent kuiper beltinto spiraling into the inner system, eventually colliding at 5-10 km/sec witha rocky planetary body of mass \leq mearth at ~3 au, delivering large amountsof water (&gt;0.1% of mearth's oceans) and carbon-rich material. the spitzerspectrum also closely matches spectra reported for the ureilite meteorites ofthe sudan almahata sitta fall in 2008, suggesting that one of the ureiliteparent bodies was a kbo.

1111.1858	the scattering of small bodies in planetary systems: constraints on the  possible orbits of cometary material	the scattering of small bodies by planets is an important dynamical processin planetary systems. we present an analytical model to describe this processusing the simplifying assumption that each particle's dynamics is dominated bya single planet at a time. as such the scattering process can be considered asa series of three body problems during each of which the tisserand parameterwith respect to the relevant planet is conserved. this constrains the orbitalparameter space into which a particle can be scattered. such arguments havepreviously been applied to the process by which comets are scattered to theinner solar system from the kuiper belt. our analysis generalises this for anarbitrary planetary system. for particles scattered from an outer belt directlyalong a chain of planets, based on the initial value of the tisserandparameter, we find that it is possible to (i) determine which planets can ejectthe particles from the system, (ii) define a minimum stellar distance to whichparticles can be scattered, and (iii) constrain range of particle inclinations(and hence the disc height) at different distances. applying this to the solarsystem, we determine that the planets are close to optimally separated forscattering particles between them. concerning warm dust found around stars thatalso have kuiper belt analogues, we show that, if there is to be a dynamicallink between the outer and inner regions, then certain architectures for theintervening planetary system are incapable of producing the observations.furthermore we show that for certain planetary systems, comets can be scatteredfrom an outer belt, or with fewer constraints, from an oort cloud analogue,onto star-grazing orbits, in support of a planetary origin to the metalpollution and dustiness of some nearby white dwarfs.

1201.1911	99 herculis: host to a circumbinary polar-ring debris disk	we present resolved herschel images of a circumbinary debris disk in the 99herculis system. the primary is a late f-type star. the binary orbit is wellcharacterised and we conclude that the disk is misaligned with the binaryplane. two different models can explain the observed structure. the first modelis a ring of polar orbits that move in a plane perpendicular to the binarypericenter direction. we favour this interpretation because it includes theeffect of secular perturbations and the disk can survive for gyr timescales.the second model is a misaligned ring. because there is an ambiguity in theorientation of the ring, which could be reflected in the sky plane, this ringeither has near-polar orbits similar to the first model, or has a 30 degreemisalignment. the misaligned ring, interpreted as the result of a recentcollision, is shown to be implausible from constraints on the collisional anddynamical evolution. because disk+star systems with separations similar to 99herculis should form coplanar, possible formation scenarios involve either aclose stellar encounter or binary exchange in the presence of circumstellarand/or circumbinary disks. discovery and characterisation of systems like 99herculis will help understand processes that result in planetary systemmisalignment around both single and multiple stars.

1205.0004	scars of intense accretion episodes at metal-rich white dwarfs	a re-evaluation of time-averaged accretion rates at dbz-type white dwarfspoints to historical, time-averaged rates significantly higher than thecurrently observed episodes at their daz counterparts. the difference betweenthe ongoing, instantaneous accretion rates witnessed at daz white dwarfs, whichoften exceed 1e8 g/s, and those inferred over the past 1e5-1e6 yr for the dbzstars can be a few orders of magnitude, and therefore must result fromhigh-rate episodes of tens to hundreds of years so they remain undetected todate. this paper explores the likelihood that such brief, intense accretionepisodes of gas-phase material can account for existing data. for reasonableassumptions about the circumstellar gas, accretion rates approaching orexceeding 1e15 g/s are possible, similar to rates observed in quiescentcataclysmic variables, and potentially detectable with future x-ray missions orwide-field monitoring facilities. gaseous debris that is prone to such rapidaccretion may be abundant immediately following a tidal disruption event viacollisions and sublimation, or if additional bodies impinge upon an extantdisk. particulate disk matter accretes at or near the poynting-robertson dragrate for long periods between gas-producing events, consistent with ratesinferred for dusty daz white dwarfs. in this picture, warm daz stars withoutinfrared excesses have rates consistent with accretion from particulate disksthat remain undetected. this overall picture has implications for quasi-steadystate models of accretion and the derived chemical composition of asteroidaldebris in dbz white dwarfs.

1206.2370	herschel imaging of 61 vir: implications for the prevalence of debris in  low-mass planetary systems	this paper describes herschel observations of the nearby (8.5pc) g5vmulti-exoplanet host star 61 vir at 70-500micron carried out by the debrissurvey. these reveal emission that is extended out to &gt;15arcsec with amorphology that can be fitted by a nearly edge-on (77deg inclination) radiallybroad (from 30au to &gt;100au) debris disk of fractional luminosity 2.7x10^-5,with two unrelated sources nearby that are more prominent at longerwavelengths. chance alignment with a background object seen at 1.4ghz providespotential for confusion, but the star's 1.4"/yr proper motion allows spitzer70micron images to confirm that what we are interpreting as disk emissionreally is circumstellar. although the exact shape of the disk's inner edge isnot well constrained, the region inside 30au must be significantly depleted inplanetesimals. this is readily explained if there are additional planets in the0.5-30au region, but is also consistent with collisional erosion. we also findtentative evidence that the presence of detectable debris around nearby starscorrelates with the presence of the lowest mass planets that are detectable incurrent radial velocity surveys. out of an unbiased sample of the nearest 60 gstars, 11 are known to have planets, of which 6 (including 61 vir) have planetsthat are all less massive than saturn, and 4 of these have evidence for debris.the debris toward one of these planet-hosts (hd20794) is reported here for thefirst time. this fraction (4/6) is higher than that expected for nearby fieldstars (15%), and implies that systems that form low-mass planets are also ableto retain bright debris disks. we suggest that this correlation could arisebecause such planetary systems are dynamically stable and include regions thatare populated with planetesimals in the formation process where theplanetesimals can remain unperturbed over gyr timescales.

1207.0521	confusion limited surveys: using wise to quantify the rarity of warm  dust around kepler stars	we describe a search for infra-red excess emission from dusty circumstellarmaterial around 180,000 stars observed by the kepler and wise missions. thisstudy is motivated by i) the potential to find bright warm disks around planethost stars, ii) a need to characterise the distribution of rare warm disks, andiii) the possible identification of candidates for discovering transiting dustconcentrations. we find about 8,000 stars that have excess emission, mostly at12um. the positions of these stars correlate with the 100um background level somost of the flux measurements associated with these excesses are spurious. weidentify 271 stars with plausible excesses by making a 5mjy/sr cut in the iras100um emission. the number counts of these excesses, at both 12 and 22um, havethe same distribution as extra-galactic number counts. thus, although someexcesses may be circumstellar, most can be explained as chance alignments withbackground galaxies. the one exception is a 22um excess associated with arelatively nearby a-type star that we were able to confirm because the diskoccurrence rate is independent of stellar distance. despite our low detectionrate, these results place valuable upper limits on the distribution of largemid-infrared excesses; e.g. fewer than 1:1000 stars have 12um excesses (f_obs/f_star) larger than a factor of five. in contrast to previous studies, wefind no evidence for disks around 1790 stars with candidate planets (weattribute one significant 12um excess to a background galaxy), and no evidencethat the disk distribution around planet hosts is different to the bulkpopulation. higher resolution imaging of stars with excesses is the best way torule out galaxy confusion and identify more reliable disk candidates amongkepler stars. a similar survey to ours that focusses on nearby stars would bewell suited to finding the distribution of rare warm disks.

1208.1759	coplanar circumbinary debris disks	we present resolved herschel images of circumbinary debris disks in the alphacrb (hd139006) and beta tri (hd13161) systems. we find that both disks areconsistent with being aligned with the binary orbital planes. though secularperturbations from the binary can align the disk, in both cases the alignmenttime at the distances at which the disk is resolved is greater than the stellarage, so we conclude that the coplanarity was primordial. neither disk can bemodelled as a narrow ring, requiring extended radial distributions. to satisfyboth the herschel and mid-ir images of the alpha crb disk, we construct a modelthat extends from 1-300au, whose radial profile is broadly consistent with apicture where planetesimal collisions are excited by secular perturbations fromthe binary. however, this model is also consistent with stirring by othermechanisms, such as the formation of pluto-sized objects. the beta tri diskmodel extends from 50-400au. a model with depleted (rather than empty) innerregions also reproduces the observations and is consistent with binary andother stirring mechanisms. as part of the modelling process, we find that theherschel pacs beam varies by as much as 10% at 70um and a few % at 100um. the70um variation can therefore hinder image interpretation, particularly forpoorly resolved objects. the number of systems in which circumbinary debrisdisk orientations have been compared with the binary plane is now four. moresystems are needed, but a picture in which disks around very close binaries(alpha crb, beta tri, and hd 98800, with periods of a few weeks to a year) arealigned, and disks around wider binaries (99 her, with a 50 yr period) aremisaligned, may be emerging. this picture is qualitatively consistent with theexpectation that the protoplanetary disks from which the debris emerged aremore likely to be aligned if their binaries have shorter periods.

1210.6258	a self-consistent model of the circumstellar debris created by a giant  hypervelocity impact in the hd172555 system	spectral modeling of the large infrared excess in the spitzer irs spectra ofhd 172555 suggests that there is more than 10^19 kg of sub-micron dust in thesystem. using physical arguments and constraints from observations, we rule outthe possibility of the infrared excess being created by a magma ocean planet ora circumplanetary disk or torus. we show that the infrared excess is consistentwith a circumstellar debris disk or torus, located at approximately 6 au, thatwas created by a planetary scale hypervelocity impact. we find that radiationpressure should remove submicron dust from the debris disk in less than oneyear. however, the system's mid-infrared photometric flux, dominated bysubmicron grains, has been stable within 4 percent over the last 27 years, fromiras (1983) to wise (2010). our new spectral modeling work and calculations ofthe radiation pressure on fine dust in hd 172555 provide a self-consistentexplanation for this apparent contradiction. we also explore the unconfirmedclaim that 10^47 molecules of sio vapor are needed to explain an emissionfeature at 8 um in the spitzer irs spectrum of hd 172555. we find that unlessthere are 10^48 atoms or 0.05 earth masses of atomic si and o vapor in thesystem, sio vapor should be destroyed by photo-dissociation in less than 0.2years. we argue that a second plausible explanation for the 8 um feature can beemission from solid sio, which naturally occurs in submicron silicate "smokes"created by quickly condensing vaporized silicate.

1211.4898	a debris disk around the planet hosting m-star gj581 spatially resolved  with herschel	debris disks have been found primarily around intermediate and solar massstars (spectral types a-k) but rarely around low mass m-type stars. we havespatially resolved a debris disk around the remarkable m3-type star gj581hosting multiple planets using deep pacs images at 70, 100 and 160 microns aspart of the debris program on the herschel space observatory. this is thesecond spatially resolved debris disk found around an m-type star, after theone surrounding the young star au mic (12 myr). however, gj 581 is much older(2-8 gyr), and is x-ray quiet in the rosat data. we fit an axisymmetric modelof the disk to the three pacs images and found that the best fit model is for adisk extending radially from 25+/-12 au to more than 60 au. such a cold disk isreminiscent of the kuiper belt but it surrounds a low mass star (0.3 m_sol) andits fractional dust luminosity l_dust/l_* of \sim 10^-4 is much higher. theinclination limits of the disk found in our analysis make the masses of theplanets small enough to ensure the long-term stability of the system accordingto some dynamical simulations. the disk is collisionally dominated down tosubmicron-sized grains and the dust cannot be expelled from the system byradiation or wind pressures because of the low luminosity and low x-rayluminosity of gj581. we suggest that the correlation between low-mass planetsand debris disks recently found for g-type stars also applies to m-typestars.finally, the known planets, of low masses and orbiting within 0.3 au fromthe star, cannot dynamically perturb the disk over the age of the star,suggesting that an additional planet exists at larger distance that is stirringthe disk to replenish the dust.

0704.0463	mass and temperature of the twa 7 debris disk	we present photometric detections of dust emission at 850 and 450 micronaround the pre-main sequence m1 dwarf twa 7 using the scuba camera on the jamesclerk maxwell telescope. these data confirm the presence of a cold dust diskaround twa 7, a member of the tw hydrae association. based on the 850 micronflux, we estimate the mass of the disk to be 18 lunar masses (0.2 earth masses)assuming a mass opacity of 1.7 cm^2/g with a temperature of 45 k. this makesthe twa 7 disk (d=55 pc) an order of magnitude more massive than the diskreported around au microscopii (gl 803), the closest (9.9 pc) debris diskdetected around an m dwarf. this is consistent with twa 7 being slightlyyounger than au mic. we find that the mid-ir and submillimeter data require thedisk to be comprised of dust at a range of temperatures. a model in which thedust is at a single radius from the star, with a range of temperaturesaccording to grain size, is as effective at fitting the emission spectrum as amodel in which the dust is of uniform size, but has a range of temperaturesaccording to distance. we discuss this disk in the context of known disks inthe tw hydrae association and around low-mass stars; a comparison of masses ofdisks in the twa reveals no trend in mass or evolutionary state (gas-rich vs.debris) as a function of spectral type.

1309.1466	star - planet - debris disk alignment in the hd 82943 system: is  planetary system coplanarity actually the norm?	recent results suggest that the two planets in the hd 82943 system areinclined to the sky plane by 20 +/- 4deg. here, we show that the debris disk inthis system is inclined by 27 +/- 4deg, thus adding strength to the derivedplanet inclinations and suggesting that the planets and debris disk areconsistent with being aligned at a level similar to the solar system. further,the stellar equator is inferred to be inclined by 28 +/- 4deg, suggesting thatthe entire star - planet - disk system is aligned, the first time suchalignment has been tested for radial velocity discovered planets on ~au wideorbits. we show that the planet-disk alignment is primordial, and not theresult of planetary secular perturbations to the disk inclination. in addition,we note three other systems with planets at &gt;10au discovered by direct imagingthat already have good evidence of alignment, and suggest that empiricalevidence of system-wide star - planet - disk alignment is therefore emerging,with the exception of systems that host hot jupiters. while this alignmentneeds to be tested in a larger number of systems, and is perhaps unsurprising,it is a reminder that the system should be considered as a whole whenconsidering the orientation of planetary orbits.

1312.4531	evolution from protoplanetary to debris discs: the transition disc  around hd 166191	hd 166191 has been identified by several studies as hosting a rare andextremely bright warm debris disc with an additional outer cool disc component.however, an alternative interpretation is that the star hosts a disc that iscurrently in transition between a full gas disc and a largely gas-free debrisdisc. with the help of new optical to mid-ir spectra and herschel imaging, weargue that the latter interpretation is supported in several ways: i) we showthat hd 166191 is co-moving with the ~4 myr-old herbig ae star hd 163296,suggesting that the two have the same age, ii) the disc spectrum of hd 166191is well matched by a standard radiative transfer model of a gaseousprotoplanetary disc with an inner hole, and iii) the hd 166191 mid-ir silicatefeature is more consistent with similarly primordial objects. we note somepotential issues with the debris disc interpretation that should be consideredfor such extreme objects, whose lifetime at the current brightness is mushshorter than the stellar age, or in the case of the outer component requires amass comparable to the solid component of the solar nebula. these aspectsindividually and collectively argue that hd 166191 is a 4-5 myr old star thathosts a gaseous transition disc. though it does not argue in favour of eitherscenario, we find strong evidence for 3-5 um disc variability. we place hd166191 in context with discs at different evolutionary stages, showing that itis a potentially important object for understanding the protoplanetary todebris disc transition.

1312.5315	discovery of the fomalhaut c debris disc	fomalhaut is one of the most interesting and well studied nearby stars,hosting at least one planet, a spectacular debris ring, and two distantlow-mass stellar companions (tw psa and lp 876-10, a.k.a. fomalhaut b &amp; c). weobserved both companions with herschel, and while no disc was detected aroundthe secondary, tw psa, we have discovered the second debris disc in thefomalhaut system, around lp 876-10. this detection is only the second case oftwo debris discs seen in a multiple system, both of which are relatively wide($\gtrsim$3000 au for hd 223352/40 and 158 kau [0.77 pc] for fomalhaut/lp876-10). the disc is cool (24k) and relatively bright, with a fractionalluminosity $l_{\rm disc}/l_\star = 1.2 \times 10^{-4}$, and represents the rareobservation of a debris disc around an m dwarf. further work should attempt tofind if the presence of two discs in the fomalhaut system is coincidental,perhaps simply due to the relatively young system age of 440 myr, or if thestellar components have dynamically interacted and the system is even morecomplex than it currently appears.

1401.6173	stochastic accretion of planetesimals onto white dwarfs: constraints on  the mass distribution of accreted material from atmospheric pollution	this paper explores how the stochastic accretion of planetesimals onto whitedwarfs would be manifested in observations of their atmospheric pollution.archival observations of pollution levels for unbiased samples of da and non-dawhite dwarfs are used to derive the distribution of accretion rates, confirmingthat rates become systematically lower as sinking time is decreased, with nodiscernable dependence on cooling age. the accretion rates expected fromplanetesimals that are all the same mass (ie, a mono-mass distribution) areexplored both analytically and using a monte carlo model, quantifying howmeasured accretion rates inevitably depend on sinking time, since differentsinking times probe different times since the last accretion event. however,that dependence is so dramatic that a mono-mass distribution can be excluded.consideration of accretion from a broad distribution of planetesimal massesuncovers an important conceptual difference: accretion is continuous (ratherthan stochastic) for planetesimals below a certain mass, and the accretion ofsuch planetesimals determines the rate typically inferred from observations;smaller planetesimals dominate the rates for shorter sinking times. areasonable fit to the observationally inferred accretion rate distributions isfound with model parameters consistent with a collisionally evolved massdistribution up to pluto-mass, and an underlying accretion rate distributionconsistent with that expected from descendants of debris discs of main sequencea stars. with these parameters, while both da and non-da white dwarfs accretefrom the same broad planetesimal distribution, this model predicts that thepollution seen in das is dominated by the continuous accretion of &lt;35kmobjects, and that in non-das by &gt;35km objects (though the dominant size variesbetween stars by around an order of magnitude from this value)...

1412.2757	co mass upper limits in the fomalhaut ring - the importance of nlte  excitation in debris discs and future prospects with alma	in recent years, gas has been observed in an increasing number of debrisdiscs, though its nature remains to be determined. here, we analyse comolecular excitation in optically thin debris discs, and search alma cycle-0data for co j=3-2 emission in the fomalhaut ring. no significant line emissionis observed; we set a 3-$\sigma$ upper limit on the integrated line flux of0.16 jy km s$^{-1}$. we show a significant dependency of the co excitation onthe density of collisional partners $n$, on the gas kinetic temperature $t_k$and on the ambient radiation field $j$, suggesting that assumptions widely usedfor protoplanetary discs (e.g. lte) do not necessarily apply to their lowdensity debris counterparts. when applied to the fomalhaut ring, we consider aprimordial origin scenario where h$_2$ dominates collisional excitation of co,and a secondary origin scenario dominated by e$^-$ and h$_2$o. in eitherscenario, we obtain a strict upper limit on the co mass of 4.9 $\times$10$^{-4}$ m$_{\oplus}$. this arises in the non-lte regime, where the excitationof the molecule is determined solely by the well-known radiation field. in thesecondary scenario, assuming any co present to be in steady state allows us toset an upper limit of $\sim$55% on the co/h$_2$o ice ratio in the parentplanetesimals. this could drop to $\sim$3% if lte applies, covering the rangeobserved in solar system comets (0.4-30%). finally, in light of our analysis,we present prospects for co detection and characterisation in debris discs withalma.

1501.03813	does the presence of planets affect the frequency and properties of  extrasolar kuiper belts? results from the herschel debris and dunes surveys	the study of the planet-debris disk connection can shed light on theformation and evolution of planetary systems, and may help predict the presenceof planets around stars with certain disk characteristics. in preliminaryanalyses of the herschel debris and dunes surveys, wyatt et al. (2012) andmarshall et al. (2014) identified a tentative correlation between debris andlow-mass planets. here we use the cleanest possible sample out these surveys toassess the presence of such a correlation, discarding stars without known ages,with ages &lt; 1 gyr and with binary companions &lt;100 au, to rule out possiblecorrelations due to effects other than planet presence. in our sample of 204fgk stars, we do not find evidence that debris disks are more common or moredusty around stars harboring high-mass or low-mass planets compared to acontrol sample without identified planets, nor that debris disks are more orless common (or more or less dusty) around stars harboring multiple planetscompared to single-planet systems. diverse dynamical histories may account forthe lack of correlations. the data show the correlation between the presence ofhigh-mass planets and stellar metallicity, but no correlation between thepresence of low-mass planets or debris and stellar metallicity. comparing theobserved cumulative distribution of fractional luminosity to those expectedfrom a gaussian distribution, we find that a distribution centered on the solarsystem's value fits well the data, while one centered at 10 times this valuecan be rejected. this is of interest in the context of future terrestrialplanet characterization because it indicates that there are good prospects forfinding a large number of debris disk systems (i.e. with evidence of harboringthe building blocks of planets) with exozodiacal emission low enough to beappropriate targets for an atlast-type mission to search for biosignatures.

0804.4580	the nature of mid-infrared excesses from hot dust around sun-like stars	(abridged) studies of debris disks have shown that most systems are analogousto the edgeworth-kuiper belt. however a rare subset of sun-like stars possessdust which lies in the terrestrial planet region. in this study we aim todetermine how many sources with apparent mid-ir excess are truly hosts of warmdust, and investigate where the dust must lie. we observed using mid-ir imagingwith timmi2, visir and michelle a sample of fgk main sequence stars reported tohave hot dust. a new modelling approach was developed to determine theconstraints that can be set on the radial extent of excess emission. we confirmthe presence of warm dust around 3 of the candidates (eta corvi, hd145263 andhd202406), and present constraints on the emitting dust regions. of 2alternative models for the eta corvi excess emission, we find that a model with1 hot dust component at &lt;3 au (combined with the known submm dust population)fits the data better at the 2.6sigma level than an alternative model with 2populations of dust in the mid-ir. we identify several systems which have acompanion (hd65277 and hd79873) or background object (hd53246, hd123356 andhd128400) responsible for their mid-infrared excess, and for 3 other systems wewere able to rule out a point-like source near the star at the level of excessobserved in lower resolution observations (hd12039, hd69830 and hd191089). hotdust sources are either young and possibly primordial or transitional, or haverelatively small radius steady-state planetesimal belts, or they are old andluminous with transient emission. high resolution imaging can be used toconstrain the location of the disk and help to discriminate between differentmodels of disk emission. for some small disks, interferometry is needed toresolve the disk location.

1506.04564	collisional modelling of the au microscopii debris disc	the spatially resolved au mic debris disc is among the most famous andbest-studied debris discs. we aim at a comprehensive understanding of the dustproduction and the dynamics of the disc objects with in depth collisionalmodelling including stellar radiative and corpuscular forces. our models arecompared to a suite of observational data for thermal and scattered lightemission, ranging from the alma radial surface brightness profile at 1.3mm topolarisation measurements in the visible. most of the data can be reproducedwith a planetesimal belt having an outer edge at around 40au and subsequentinward transport of dust by stellar winds. a low dynamical excitation of theplanetesimals with eccentricities up to 0.03 is preferred. the radial width ofthe planetesimal belt cannot be constrained tightly. belts that are 5au and17au wide, as well as a broad 44au-wide belt are consistent with observations.all models show surface density profiles increasing with distance from the staras inferred from observations. the best model is achieved by assuming a stellarmass loss rate that exceeds the solar one by a factor of 50. while the sed andthe shape of the alma profile are well reproduced, the models deviate from thescattered light data more strongly. the observations show a bluer disc colourand a lower degree of polarisation for projected distances &lt;40au than predictedby the models. the problem may be mitigated by irregularly-shaped dust grainswhich have scattering properties different from the mie spheres used. fromtests with a handful of selected dust materials, we derive a preference formixtures of silicate, carbon, and ice of moderate porosity. we address theorigin of the unresolved central excess emission detected by alma and show thatit cannot stem from an additional inner belt alone. instead, it should derive,at least partly, from the chromosphere of the central star.

0807.1272	dynamics of small bodies in planetary systems	the number of stars that are known to have debris disks is greater than thatof stars known to harbour planets. these disks are detected because dust iscreated in the destruction of planetesimals in the disks much in the same waythat dust is produced in the asteroid belt and kuiper belt in the solar system.for the nearest stars the structure of their debris disks can be directlyimaged, showing a wide variety of both axisymmetric and asymmetric structures.a successful interpretation of these images requires a knowledge of thedynamics of small bodies in planetary systems, since this allows the observeddust distribution to be deconvolved to provide information on the distributionof larger objects, such as planetesimals and planets. this chapter reviews thestructures seen in debris disks, and describes a disk dynamical theory whichcan be used to interpret those observations. in this way much of the observedstructures, both axisymmetric and asymmetric, can be explained by a model inwhich the dust is produced in a planetesimal belt which is perturbed by anearby, as yet unseen, planet. while the planet predictions still requireconfirmation, it is clear that debris disks have the potential to provideunique information about the structure of extrasolar planetary systems, sincethey can tell us about planets analogous to neptune and even the earth.significant failings of the model at present are its inability to predict thequantity of small grains in a system, and to explain the origin of thetransient dust seen in some systems. given the complexity of planetary systemdynamics and how that is readily reflected in the structure of a debris disk,it seems inevitable that the study of debris disks will play a vital role inour understanding of extrasolar planetary systems.

astro-ph;0204034	collisional processes in extrasolar planetsimal disks - dust clumps in  fomalhaut's debris disk	this paper presents a model for the outcome of collisions betweenplanetesimals in a debris disk and assesses the impact of collisional processeson the structure and size distribution of the disk. the model is presented byits application to fomalhaut's collisionally replenished dust disk; a recent450 micron image of this disk shows a clump embedded within it with a flux ~5per cent of the total. the following conclusions are drawn: (i) sed modellingis consistent with fomalhaut's disk having a collisional cascade sizedistribution extending from bodies 0.2 m in diameter down to 7 micron-sizeddust. (ii) collisional lifetime arguments imply that the cascade starts withplanetesimals 1.5-4 km in diameter. any larger bodies must be predominantlyprimordial. (iii) constraints on the timescale for the ignition of the cascadeare consistent with these primordial planetesimals having a distribution thatextends up to 1000km, resulting in a disk mass of 5-10 times the minimum masssolar nebula. (iv) the debris disk is expected to be intrinsically clumpy,since planetesimal collisions result in dust clumps. the intrinsic clumpinessof fomalhaut's disk is below current detection limits, but could be detectableby future observatories such as the alma, and could provide the only way ofdetermining the primordial planetesimal population. (v) the observed clumpcould have originated in a collision between two runaway planetesimals, bothlarger than 1400 km diameter. it is unlikely that we should witness such anevent unless both the formation of these runaways and the ignition of thecollisional cascade occurred within the last ~10 myr. (vi) another explanationfor fomalhaut's clump is that ~5 per cent of the planetesimals in the ring aretrapped in 1:2 resonance with a planet orbiting at 80 au.

astro-ph;0308253	resonant trapping of planetesimals by planet migration: debris disk  clumps and vega's similarity to the solar system	this paper describes a model which can explain the observed clumpy structuresof debris disks. clumps arise because after a planetary system forms itsplanets migrate due to angular momentum exchange with the remainingplanetesimals. outward migration of the outermost planet traps planetesimalsoutside its orbit into its resonances and resonant forces cause azimuthalstructure in their distribution. the model is based on numerical simulations ofplanets of different masses, mpl, migrating at different rates, dapl/dt,through a dynamically cold (e&lt;0.01) planetesimal disk initially at a semimajoraxis a. trapping probabilities and the resulting azimuthal structures arepresented for a planet's 2:1, 5:3, 3:2, and 4:3 resonances. seven possibledynamical structures are identified from migrations defined by mu=mpl/mstar andtheta=dapl/dt*sqrt(a/mstar). application of this model to the 850um image ofvega's disk shows its two clumps of unequal brightness can be explained by themigration of a neptune-mass planet from 40 to 65au over 56myr; tightconstraints are set on possible ranges of these parameters. the clumps arecaused by planetesimals in the 3:2 and 2:1 resonances; the asymmetry arisesbecause of the overabundance of planetesimals in the 2:1(u) over the 2:1(l)resonance. the similarity of this migration to that proposed for our ownneptune hints that vega's planetary system may be much more akin to the solarsystem than previously thought. predictions are made which would substantiatethis model, such as the orbital motion of the clumpy pattern, the location ofthe planet, and the presence of lower level clumps.

astro-ph;0311593	sub-mm observations and modelling of vega type stars	we present new sub-mm observations and modelling of vega excess stars, usingrealistic dust grain models. for resolved disks, we find that different objectsrequire very different dust grain properties in order to simultaneously fit theimage data and sed. fomalhaut and vega require solid dust grains, whilst hr4796and hd141569 can only be fitted using porous grains. the older stars tend tohave less porous grains than younger stars, which may indicate that collisionshave compacted the dust grains. eps eri appears to be deficient in small dustgrains compared to our best fitting model. this may be due to factors whichaffect the size distribution of grains close to the radiation pressure blowoutlimit. alternatively, this discrepancy may be due to some external influence onthe disk (e.g. a planet). when the model is applied to unresolved targets, anestimate of the disk size can be made. however, the large diversity in dustcomposition for the resolved disks means that we cannot make a reliableassumption as to the composition of the grains in an unresolved disk, and thereis corresponding uncertainty in the disk size. in addition, the poor fit foreps eri shows that the model cannot always account for the sed even if the disksize is known. these two factors mean that it may not be possible to determinea disk's size without actually resolving it.

astro-ph;0411061	sub-millimeter images of a dusty kuiper belt around eta corvi	we present sub-millimeter and mid-infrared images of the circumstellar diskaround the nearby f2v star eta corvi. the disk is resolved at 850um with a sizeof ~100au. at 450um the emission is found to be extended at all positionangles, with significant elongation along a position angle of 130+-10deg; atthe highest resolution (9.3") this emission is resolved into two peaks whichare to within the uncertainties offset symmetrically from the star at 100auprojected separation. modeling the appearance of emission from a narrow ring inthe sub-mm images shows the observed structure cannot be caused by an edge-onor face-on axisymmetric ring; the observations are consistent with a ring ofradius 150+-20au seen at 45+-25deg inclination. more face-on orientations arepossible if the dust distribution includes two clumps similar to vega; we showhow such a clumpy structure could arise from the migration over 25myr of aneptune mass planet from 80-105au. the inner 100au of the system appearsrelatively empty of sub-mm emitting dust, indicating that this region may havebeen cleared by the formation of planets, but the disk emission spectrum showsthat iras detected an additional hot component with a characteristictemperature of 370+-60k (implying a distance of 1-2au). at 11.9um we found theemission to be unresolved with no background sources which could becontaminating the fluxes measured by iras. the age of this star is estimated tobe ~1gyr. it is very unusual for such an old main sequence star to exhibitsignificant mid-ir emission. the proximity of this source makes it a perfectcandidate for further study from optical to mm wavelengths to determine thedistribution of its dust.

astro-ph;0501038	the insignificance of p-r drag in detectable extrasolar planetesimal  belts	this paper considers a simple model in which dust produced in a planetesimalbelt migrates in toward the star due to p-r drag suffering destructivecollisions with other dust grains on the way. assuming the dust is all of thesame size, the resulting surface density distribution can be derivedanalytically and depends only on the parameter eta0=5000tau*sqrt(mstar/r)/beta;this parameter can be determined observationally with the hypothesis thatbeta=0.5. for massive belts in which eta0&gt;&gt;1 dust is confined to theplanetesimal belt, while the surface density of more tenuous belts, in whicheta0&lt;&lt;1, is constant with distance from the star. the emission spectrum of dustfrom planetesimal belts at different distances from different mass stars showsthat the dust belts which have been detected to date should have eta0&gt;&gt;1; dustbelts with eta0&lt;&lt;1 are hard to detect as they are much fainter than the stellarphotosphere. this is confirmed for a sample of 37 debris disk candidates forwhich eta0 was determined to be &gt;10. this means that these disks are so massivethat mutual collisions prevent dust from reaching the inner regions of thesesystems and p-r drag can be ignored when studying their dynamics. models forthe formation of structure in debris disks by the trapping of particles intoplanetary resonances by p-r drag should be reconsidered. however, sincecollisions do not halt 100% of the dust, this means that in the absence ofplanetary companions debris disk systems should be populated by smallquantities of hot dust which may be detectable in the mid-ir. even in diskswith eta0&lt;&lt;1 the temperature of dust emission is shown to be a reliable tracerof the planetesimal distribution meaning that inner holes in the dustdistribution imply a lack of colliding planetesimals in the inner regions.

astro-ph;0504086	the vega debris disk -- a surprise from spitzer	we present high spatial resolution mid- and far-infrared images of the vegadebris disk obtained with the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer (mips).the disk is well resolved and its angular size is much larger than foundpreviously. the radius of the disk is at least 43" (330 au), 70"(543 au), and105" (815 au) in extent at 24, 70 and 160 um, respectively. the disk images arecircular, smooth and without clumpiness at all three wavelengths. the radialsurface brightness profiles imply an inner boundary at a radius of 11"+/-2" (86au). assuming an amalgam of amorphous silicate and carbonaceous grains, thedisk can be modeled as an axially symmetric and geometrically thin disk, viewedface-on, with the surface particle number density following an r^-1 power law.the disk radiometric properties are consistent with a range of models usinggrains of sizes ~1 to ~50 um. we find that a ring, containing grains largerthan 180 um and at radii of 86-200 au from the star, can reproduce the observed850 um flux, while its emission does not violate the observed mips profiles.this ring could be associated with a population of larger asteroidal bodiesanalogous to our own kuiper belt. cascades of collisions starting withencounters amongthese large bodies in the ring produce the small debris that isblown outward by radiation pressure to much larger distances where we detectits thermal emission. the dust production rate is &gt;~10^15 g/s based on the mipsresults. this rate would require a very massive asteroidal reservoir for thedust to be produced in a steady state throughout vega's life. instead, wesuggest that the disk we imaged is ephemeral and that we are witnessing theaftermath of a large and relatively recent collisional event, and subsequentcollisional cascade.

astro-ph;0506208	spiral structure when setting up pericentre glow: possible giant planets  at hundreds of au in the hd141569 disk	this paper discusses the impact of introducing a planet on an eccentric orbitinto a planetesimal disk. that planet's secular perturbations cause the orbitsof the planetesimals to evolve in such a way that at any one time planetesimalsat the same distance from the star have common pericentres and eccentricities.this causes the surface density distribution of an extended planetesimal diskto exhibit two spirals, one exterior the other interior to the planet's orbit.these two spirals unwind in different directions and their structure isdescribed by two parameters: the time since the planet was introduced and theplanet's eccentricity. at late times the spirals become tightly wound and theoffset centre of symmetry of the pericentre glow approximation is recovered.comparison with spiral structure seen in the hd141569 disk shows that itsspiral at 325 au is similar to that caused by introducing a planet 5 myr agowith a mass 0.2-2m_jup orbiting at 235-250 au with an eccentricity of 0.05-0.2;likewise a saturn mass planet at 150 au would cause structure like that seen at200 au. more definitive statements about any planets orbiting hd141569 fromthis model could be made once the effect of the binary companion on the disk isknown, and once the disk's structure has been better characterised down to 100au, including the location of the star within the disk. the relatively youngage of this system (~5 myr) means that if giant planets really do exist athundreds of au from hd141569, this provides a unique opportunity to setconstraints on the mechanism by which those planets came to be at such largedistances.

astro-ph;0511219	dust in resonant extrasolar kuiper belts - grain size and wavelength  dependence of disk structure	this paper considers the distribution of dust which originates in thebreak-up of planetesimals that are trapped in resonance with a planet. thereare three grain populations with different spatial distributions: (i) largegrains have the clumpy resonant distribution of the planetesimals; (ii)moderate sized grains are no longer in resonance and have an axisymmetricdistribution; (iii) small grains are blown out of the system by radiationpressure and have a distribution which falls off oc 1/r, however these grainscan be further divided into subclasses: (iiia) grains produced from pop i thatexhibit trailing spiral structure emanating from the clumps; and (iiib) grainsproduced from pop ii that have an axisymmetric distribution. since observationsin different wavebands are sensitive to different sized dust grains,multi-wavelength imaging can be used to test models for the origin of debrisdisk structure. for example, a disk with no blow-out grains would appear clumpyin the sub-mm, but smooth at mid- to far-ir wavelengths. the wavelength of thetransition is indicative of the mass of the perturbing planet. the sizedistribution of vega's disk is modeled in the light of the recent spitzerobservations. the origin of the large quantities of pop iii grains seen byspitzer must be in the destruction of the grains seen in the sub-mm, and so athigh resolution and sensitivity the mid- to far-ir structure of vega's disk ispredicted to include spiral structure emanating from the sub-mm clumps.

astro-ph;0609574	search for cold debris disks around m-dwarfs	debris disks are believed to be related to planetesimals left over aroundstars after planet formation has ceased. the frequency of debris disks aroundm-dwarfs which account for 70% of the stars in the galaxy is unknown whileconstrains have already been found for a- to k-type stars. we have searched forcold debris disks around 32 field m-dwarfs by conducting observations at lambda= 850 microns with the scuba bolometerarray camera at the jcmt and at lambda =1.2mm with the mambo array at the iram 30-m telescopes. this is the firstsurvey of a large sample of m-dwarfs conducted to provide statisticalconstraints on debris disks around this type of stars. we have detected a newdebris disk around the m0.5 dwarf gj842.2 at lambda = 850 microns, providingevidence for cold dust at large distance from this star (~ 300au). by combiningthe results of our survey with the ones of liu et al. (2004), we estimate forthe first time the detection rate of cold debris disks around field m-dwarfswith ages between 20 and 200 myr. this detection rate is 13^{+6}_{-8} % and isconsistent with the detection rate of cold debris disks (9 - 23 %) around a- tok-type main sequence stars of the same age. this is an indication that colddisks may be equally prevalent across stellar spectral types.

astro-ph;0610102	transience of hot dust around sun-like stars	there is currently debate over whether the dust content of planetary systemsis stochastically regenerated or originates in planetesimal belts evolving insteady state. in this paper a simple model for the steady state evolution ofdebris disks due to collisions is developed and confronted with the propertiesof the emerging population of 7 sun-like stars that have hot dust &lt;10au. themodel shows there is a maximum possible disk mass at a given age, since moremassive primordial disks process their mass faster. the corresponding maximumdust luminosity is f_max=0.00016r^(7/3)/t_age. the majority (4/7) of the hotdisks exceed this limit by &gt;1000 and so cannot be the products of massiveasteroid belts, rather the following systems must be undergoing transientevents characterized by an unusually high dust content near the star: etacorvi, hd69830, hd72905 and bd+20307. it is also shown that the hot dust cannotoriginate in a recent collision in an asteroid belt, since there is also amaximum rate at which collisions of sufficient magnitude to reproduce a givendust luminosity can occur. further it is shown that the planetesimal beltfeeding the dust in these systems must be located further from the star thanthe dust, typically at &gt;2au. other notable properties of the 4 hot dust systemsare: two also have a planetesimal belt at &gt;10au (eta corvi and hd72905); onehas 3 neptune mass planets at &lt;1au (hd69830); all exhibit strong silicatefeatures in the mid-ir. we consider the most likely origin for the dust inthese systems to be a dynamical instability which scattered planetesimalsinwards from a more distant planetesimal belt in an event akin to the lateheavy bombardment in our own system, the dust being released from suchplanetesimals in collisions and possibly also sublimation.

astro-ph;0611452	on the nature of the dust in the debris disk around hd69830	we have used the infrared mineralogical model derived from the spitzer irsobservations of the deep impact experiment to study the nature of the dust inthe debris found around the k0v star hd69830 (beichman et al. 2005). using arobust approach to determine the bulk average mineralogical composition of thedust, we show it to be substantially different from that found for comet9p/tempel 1 (lisse et al. 2006) or c/hale-bopp 1995 o1 and comet-dominated ysohd100546 (lisse et al. 2007). lacking in carbonaceous and ferrous materials butincluding small icy grains, the composition of the hd 69830 dust resembles thatof a disrupted p or d-type asteroid. the amount of mass responsible for theobserved emission is the equivalent of a 30 km radius, 2500 kg m-3 sphere,while the radiative temperature of the dust implies that the bulk of theobserved material is at ~1.0 au from the central source, coincident with the2:1 and 5:2 mean motion resonances of the outermost of 3 neptune-sized planetsdetected by lovis et al. (2006). in our solar system, p and d-type asteroidsare both large and numerous in the outer main belt and near jupiter (e.g. thehildas and trojans) and have undergone major disruptive events to producedebris disk-like structures (c.f. the karin and veritas families 5-8 myrs ago).the short-lived nature of the small and icy dust implies that the disruptionoccurred within the last year, or that replenishment due to ongoing collisionalfragmentation is occurring.

astro-ph;0703608	steady-state evolution of debris disks around a stars	in this paper a simple analytical model for the steady-state evolution ofdebris disks due to collisions is confronted with spitzer observations of mainsequence a stars. all stars are assumed to have planetesimal belts with adistribution of initial masses and radii. in the model disk mass is constantuntil the largest planetesimals reach collisional equilibrium whereupon themass falls off oc 1/t. we find that the detection statistics and trends seen atboth 24 and 70um can be fitted well by the model. while there is no need toinvoke stochastic evolution or delayed stirring to explain the statistics, amoderate rate of stochastic events is not ruled out. potentially anomaloussystems are identified by a high dust luminosity compared with the maximumpermissible in the model (hd3003, hd38678, hd115892, hd172555). theirplanetesimals may have unusual properties (high strength or low eccentricity)or this dust could be transient. while transient phenomena are also favored fora few systems in the literature, the overall success of our model, whichassumes planetesimals in all belts have the same strength, eccentricity andmaximum size, suggests a large degree of uniformity in the outcome of planetformation. the distribution of planetesimal belt radii, once corrected fordetection bias, follows n(r) oc r^{-0.8+-0.3} for 3-120au. since the inner edgeis often attributed to an unseen planet, this provides a unique constraint onthe planetary systems of a stars. it is also shown that p-r drag may sculpt theinner edges of a star disks close to the spitzer detection threshold (hd2262,hd19356, hd106591, hd115892). this model can be readily applied to theinterpretation of future surveys, and predictions are made for the upcomingscuba-2 survey, including that &gt;17% of a stars should be detectable at 850um.

astro-ph;9908267	how observations of circumstellar disk asymmetries can reveal hidden  planets: pericenter glow and its application to the hr 4796 disk	recent images of the disks of dust around the young stars hr 4796a andfomalhaut show, in each case, a double-lobed feature that may be asymmetric(one lobe may be brighter than the other). a symmetric double-lobed structureis that expected from a disk of dust with a central hole that is observednearly edge-on (i.e., close to the plane of the disk). this paper shows how thegravitational influence of a second body in the system with an eccentric orbitwould cause a brightness asymmetry in such a disk by imposing a "forcedeccentricity" on the orbits of the constituent dust particles, thus shiftingthe center of symmetry of the disk away from the star and causing the dust nearthe forced pericenter of the perturbed disk to glow. dynamic modeling of the hr4796 disk shows that its 5% brightness asymmetry could be the result of aforced eccentricity as small as 0.02 imposed on the disk by either the binarycompanion hr 4796b, or by an unseen planet close to the inner edge of the disk.since it is likely that a forced eccentricity of 0.01 or higher would beimposed on a disk in a system in which there are planets, but no binarycompanion, the corresponding asymmetry in the disk's structure could serve as asensitive indicator of these planets that might otherwise remain undetected.

astro-ph;9909363	deep 10 and 18 micron imaging of the hr 4796a circumstellar disk:  transient dust particles &amp; tentative evidence for a brightness asymmetry	we present new 10.8 and 18.2 micron images of hr 4796a, a young a0v star thatwas recently discovered to have a spectacular, nearly edge-on, circumstellardisk prominent at ~20 microns (jayawardhana et al. 1998; koerner et al. 1998).these new images, obtained with oscir at keck ii, show that the disk's size at10 microns is comparable to its size at 18 microns. therefore, the 18micron-emitting dust may also emit some, or all, of the 10 micron radiation.using these multi-wavelength images, we determine a "characteristic" diameterof 2-3 microns for the mid-infrared-emitting dust particles if they arespherical and composed of astronomical silicates. particles this small areexpected to be blown out of the system by radiation pressure in a few hundredyears, and therefore these particles are unlikely to be primordial. dynamicalmodeling of the disk (wyatt et al. 2000) indicates that the disk surfacedensity is relatively sharply peaked near 70 au, which agrees with the meanannular radius deduced by schneider et al. (1999) from their nicmos images. wepresent evidence (~1.8 sigma significance) for a brightness asymmetry that mayresult from the presence of the hole and the gravitational perturbation of thedisk particle orbits by the low-mass stellar companion or a planet. this"pericenter glow," which must still be confirmed, results from a very small (afew au) shift of the disk's center of symmetry relative to the central star hr4796a; one side of the inner boundary of the annulus is shifted towards hr4796a, thereby becoming warmer and more infrared-emitting. the possibledetection of pericenter glow implies that the detection of even complexdynamical effects of planets on disks is within reach.

0810.5087	resolved debris disk emission around eta tel: a young solar system or  ongoing planet formation?	60% of the a star members of the 12 myr old beta pictoris moving group (bpmg)show significant excess emission in the mid-infrared, several million yearsafter the proto-planetary disk is thought to disperse. theoretical modelssuggest this peak may coincide with the formation of pluto-sized planetesimalsin the disk, stirring smaller bodies into collisional destruction. here wepresent resolved mid-infrared imaging of the disk of eta tel (a0v in the bpmg)and consider its implications for the state of planet formation in this system.eta tel was observed at 11.7 and 18.3um using t-recs on gemini south. theresulting images were compared to simple disk models to constrain the radialdistribution of the emitting material. the emission observed at 18.3um is shownto be significantly extended beyond the psf along a position angle 8 degrees.this is the first time dust emission has been resolved around eta tel.modelling indicates that the extension arises from an edge-on disk of radius0.5 arcsec (~24 au). combining the spatial constraints from the imaging withthose from the spectral energy distribution shows that &gt;50% of the 18umemission comes from an unresolved dust component at ~4 au. the radial structureof the eta tel debris disk is reminiscent of the solar system, suggesting thatthis is a young solar system analogue. for an age of 12myr, both the radius anddust level of the extended cooler component are consistent with self-stirringmodels for a protoplanetary disk of 0.7 times minimum mass solar nebula. theorigin of the hot dust component may arise in an asteroid belt undergoingcollisional destruction, or in massive collisions in ongoing terrestrial planetformation.
