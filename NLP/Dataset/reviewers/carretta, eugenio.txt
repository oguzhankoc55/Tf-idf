0706.2780	the chemical abundance of the very metal rich old open clusters ngc 6253  and ngc 6791	in the framework of a project aiming at deriving in a homogeneous way theproperties (age, distance, reddening and detailed chemical abundances) of alarge sample of old open clusters, we present here the metal abundance and theabundance ratios of light (c, n, o, na, mg, al, si, ca, ti) and heavier (cr,mn, ni, ba, eu) elements in the galactic open clusters ngc 6253 and ngc 6791.we performed spectrum synthesis of selected lines on high resolution spectra offour red clump stars in ngc 6253, taken with the uves and feros spectrographs.we also determined abundances of the same elements for four red clump stars inngc 6791, observed with sarg, for which we had derived the atmosphericparameters and the iron, carbon and oxygen abundances in a previous paper(gratton et al. 2006). the average metallicity of ngc 6253 is [fe/h]=+0.46 (rms= 0.03 dex, systematic error = 0.08 dex), obtained by extensive spectralsynthesis of fe lines. this intermediate age cluster closely resembles the oldopen cluster ngc 6791, as far as the chemical composition is concerned. c, n, odo not show any significant abundance scatter; they are underabundant withrespect to the solar values both in ngc 6253 and ngc 6791. we also find noevident star-to-star scatter in any of the elements measured in both clusters,with the possible exception of na in ngc 6791. the two clusters show verysimilar abundances, except for mg, overabundant in ngc 6791 and not in ngc6253. both have solar scaled alpha-elements abundances. we have compared ourabundance ratios with literature values for disk giants and dwarfs and bulgegiants, finding a general good agreement with the run of elemental ratios with[fe/h] of disk objects.

0909.2941	na-o anticorrelation and hb. viii. proton-capture elements and  metallicities in 17 globular clusters from uves spectra	we present homogeneous abundances for fe and some of the elements involved inthe proton-capture reactions (o, na, mg, al, and si) for 202 red giants in 17galactic globular clusters (gcs) from the analysis of high resolution uvesspectra obtained with flames@eso-vlt2. our programme clusters span almost thewhole range in metallicity of gcs and were selected to sample the widest rangeof global parameters (hb morphology, masses, concentration, etc). here we focuson the discussion of the na-o and mg-al anticorrelations and related issues.our study finds clear na and o star-to-star abundance variations in all gcs.variations in al are present in all but a few gcs. finally, a spread inabundances of mg and si are also present in a few clusters. mg is slightly lessoverabundant and si slightly more overabundant in the most al-rich stars. thecorrelation between si and al abundances is a signature of production of 28sileaking from the mg-al cycle in a few clusters. the cross sections required forthe proper reactions to take over in the cycle point to temperatures in excessof about 65 mk for the favoured site of production. we used a dilution model toinfer the total range of al abundances starting from the al abundances in theuves spectra, and the na abundance distributions found from analysis of themuch larger set of stars for which giraffe spectra were available. we foundthat the maximum amount of additional al produced by first generation polluterscontributing to the composition of the second generation stars in each clusteris closely correlated with the same combination of metallicity and clusterluminosity that reproduced the minimum o abundances found from giraffe spectra.we then suggest that the high temperatures required for the mg-al cycle areonly reached in the most massive and most metal-poor polluters.

0910.0675	intrinsic iron spread and a new metallicity scale for globular clusters	we have collected spectra of about 2000 red giant branch (rgb) stars in 19galactic globular clusters (gc) using flames@vlt (about 100 star with giraffeand about 10 with uves, respectively, in each gc). these observations providean unprecedented, precise, and homogeneous data-set of fe abundances in gcs. weuse it to study the cosmic scatter of iron and find that, as far as fe isconcerned, most gcs can still be considered mono-metallic, since the upperlimit to the scatter in iron is less than 0.05 dex, meaning that the degree ofhomogeneity is better than 12%. the scatter in fe we find seems to have adependence on luminosity, possibly due to the well-known inadequacies ofstellar atmospheres for upper-rgb stars and/or to intrinsic variability. italso seems to be correlated with cluster properties, like the mass, indicatinga larger scatter in more massive gcs which is likely a (small) true intrinsicscatter. the 19 gcs, covering the metallicity range of the bulk of galacticgcs, define an accurate and updated metallicity scale. we providetransformation equations for a few existing scales. we also provide new valuesof [fe/h], on our scale, for all gcs in the harris' catalogue.

1002.0002	calcium and light-elements abundance variations from high resolution  spectroscopy in globular clusters	we use abundances of ca, o, na, al from high resolution uves spectra of 200red giants in 17 globular clusters (gcs) to investigate the correlation foundby lee et al. (2009) between chemical enrichment from sn ii and star-to-starvariations in light elements in gc stars. we find that (i) the [ca/h]variations between first and second generation stars are tiny in most gcs(~0.02-0.03 dex, comparable with typical observational errors). in addition,(ii) using a large sample of red giants in m 4 with abundances from uvesspectra from marino et al. (2008), we find that ca and fe abundances in the twopopulations of na-poor and na-rich stars are identical. these facts suggestthat the separation seen in color-magnitude diagrams using the u band or hkindex (as observed in ngc 1851 by han et al. 2009) are not due to cavariations. small differences in [ca/h] as associated to hk variations might bedue to a small systematic effect in abundance analysis, because mosto-poor/na-rich (he-rich) stars have slightly larger [fe/h] (by 0.027 dex onaverage, due to decreased h in the ratio) than first generation stars and arethen located at redder positions in the v,hk plane. while a few gcs (m 54,omega cen, m 22, maybe even ngc 1851) do actually show various degree ofmetallicity spread, our findings eliminate the need of a close link between theenrichment by core-collapse sne with the mechanism responsible for the na-oanticorrelation.

1003.1723	properties of stellar generations in globular clusters and relations  with global parameters	abridged) we revise the formation of galactic gcs by adding the detailedchemical composition of their different stellar generations (from 1200 giantsin 19 gcs) to their global parameters. we propose to identify as gcs thoseshowing the na-o anticorrelation, and we classify the gcs according tokinematics and location in the galaxy in disk/bulge, inner, and outer halo. wefind that the lf of gcs is fairly independent of their population, suggestingthat it is imprinted by the formation mechanism, and only marginally affectedby the ensuing evolution. we show that a large fraction of the primordialpopulation should have been lost by the proto-gcs. the extremely low alabundances found for the primordial population of massive gcs indicate a veryfast enrichment process before the formation of the primordial population. wesuggest a scenario for the formation of gcs including at least 3 main phases:i) the formation of a precursor population (likely due to the interaction ofcosmological structures similar to those leading to dwarf spheroidals, butresiding at smaller rgc, with the early galaxy or with other structures), ii)which triggers a large episode of star formation (the primordial population),and iii) the formation of the current gc, mainly within a cooling flow formedby the slow winds of a fraction of the primordial population. the precursorpopulation is very effective in raising the metal content in massive and/ormetal poor (mainly halo) clusters, while its role is minor in small and/ormetal rich (mainly disk) ones. finally, we use pca and multivariate relationsto study the phase of metal-enrichment from 1st to 2nd generation. most of thechemical signatures of gcs may be ascribed to a few parameters, the mostimportant being [fe/h], mass, and age of the cluster, with the location withinthe galaxy also playing some role.

1004.3862	the second and third parameters of the horizontal branch in globular  clusters	the horizontal branch (hb) second parameter of globular clusters (gcs) is amajor open issue in stellar evolution. large photometric and spectroscopicdatabases allow a re-examination of this issue. we derive median and extreme(90% of the distribution) colours and magnitudes of stars along the hb forabout a hundred gcs. we transform these into median and extreme masses of starson the hb taking into account evolutionary effects, and compare these masseswith those expected at the tip of the red giant branch to derive the total masslost by the stars. a simple linear dependence on metallicity of this total masslost explains well the median colours of hb stars. adopting this mass loss lawas universal, we find that age is the main second parameter. however, at leasta third parameter is clearly required. the most likely candidate is the heabundance, which might be different in gcs stars belonging to the differentstellar generations whose presence was previously derived from the na-o andmg-al anticorrelations. variations in the median he abundance allow explainingthe extremely blue hb of some gcs; such variations are correlated with ther-parameter. suitable he abundances allow deriving ages from the hb which areconsistent with those obtained from the main sequence. small corrections tothese latter ages are then proposed, producing a tight age-metallicity relationfor disk and bulge gcs. star-to-star variations in the he content explain theextension of the hb. there is a strong correlation between this extension andthe interquartile of the na-o anticorrelation. the main driver for thevariations in the he-content within gcs seems the total cluster mass. 47 tucand m3 exhibit exceptional behaviours; however, they can be accommodated in ascenario for the formation of gcs that relates their origin to cooling flowsgenerated after very large episodes of star formation.

1005.2659	helium in first and second-generation stars in globular clusters from  spectroscopy of red giants	(abridged) recent spectroscopic and photometric observations show theexistence of various generations of stars in gcs, differing in the abundancesof products of h-burning at high temperatures (the main final product beinghe). it is important to study the connections between stars properties and hecontent. we consider here the about 1400 stars on the red giant branch (rgb)observed with flames@vlt in 19 galactic gcs, part of out na-o anticorrelationprojet. stars with different he are expected to have different temperatures(i.e. colours), slightly different [fe/h], and different luminosity levels ofthe rgb bump. all these differences are small, but our study has the necessaryprecision, good statistics, and homogeneity to detect them. we also computedsuitable sets of stellar models (basti) for various assumptions about theinitial helium content. differences in observable quantities that can beattributed to variations in he content are generally detectable between starsof the primordial (p, first-generation) and extreme (e, second-generation)populations, but not between the primordial and intermediate ones (i). the onlyexception (differences are significant also between p and i populations) isngc2808, where three populations are clearly separated also on the mainsequence and the horizontal branch. the average enhancement in the he massfraction y between p and e stars is about 0.05-0.11, depending on theassumptions. the differences in y, for ngc2808 alone, are about 0.11-0.14between p and i stars, and about 0.15-0.19 between p and e stars, againdepending on the assumptions. the rgb bump luminosity of first andsecond-generation stars has different levels; the implied y difference is moredifficult to quantify, but is in agreement with the other determinations.

1007.2164	ba stars and other binaries in first and second generation stars in  globular clusters	the determination of the ba abundance in globular cluster (gc) stars is avery powerful test to address several issues in the framework of multiplepopulation scenarios. we measured the ba content for a sample of more than 1200stars in 15 galactic gcs, using high-resolution flames/giraffe spectra. wefound no variation in [ba/fe] ratios for different stellar populations withineach cluster; this means that low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars do notsignificantly contribute to the intra-cluster pollution. very interestingly, weobtained that the fraction of ba-stars in first generation (fg) stars is closeto the values derived for field stars ($\sim$2\%); on the other hand, secondgeneration (sg) stars present a significant lower fraction. an independent andsuccessful test, based on radial velocity variations among giant stars inngc~6121, confirms our finding: the binary fraction among fg stars is about$\sim$12\% to be compared with $\sim$1\% of sg stars. this is an evidence thatsg stars formed in a denser environment, where infant mortality of binarysystems was particularly efficient.

1106.3174	multiple stellar populations in the globular cluster ngc 1851	[abridged] detailed chemical tagging of individual stellar populations in thegalactic globular cluster (gc) ngc 1851 is presented. abundances are derivedfrom flames spectra for the largest sample of giants (124) ever analysed inthis peculiar gc using o, na, mg, al, si, ca, ti, sc, v, mn, co, ni, cu, y, zr,ba, la, ce, nd, eu, dy. we confirm a [fe/h] spread in this gc, but too small toclearly separate different sub-populations. we instead propose a classificationusing a combination of fe and ba (much more abundant in the more metal-richgroup) through a cluster analysis: we separated stars into a metal-rich (mr)and a metal-poor (mp) populations, each of them showing a na-o anticorrelation,signature of genuine gc, although with different ratios of primordial topolluted stars. the ratio [alpha/h] tracks iron and is higher in the mrpopulation, suggesting an additional contribution by core-collapse supernovae.the mr population shows a larger enrichment in s-process elements compared tothe mp one. this is probably due to the contribution by intermediate-low massstars, because we find that the level of heavy s-process elements is largerthan the level of light s-process nuclei in the mr stars; however, a largecontribution by low mass stars is unlikely, because it would likely cancel theo-na anticorrelation. we also confirm the presence of correlations betweenp-capture and s-process elements previously found by other studies, at leastfor the mr population. this finding apparently requires a quite long delay forthe second generation of the mr component. a merger of two distinct gcs in aparent dwarf galaxy, each one with a different ba level and an age differenceof ~1 gyr, might explain (i) the double sgb, (ii) a possible difference in ccontent between the two original gcs, and (iii) the stromgren photometry ofthis peculiar gc.

1108.5216	chemical enrichment mechanisms in omega centauri: clues from  neutron-capture elements	in the complex picture of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters(gcs), a special role is played by ngc 5139 omega centauri. at variance withthe majority of gcs, omega cen exhibits significant star-to-star variations inmetallicity and in relative neutron-capture element abundance ratios withrespect to fe, along with split evolutionary sequences as revealed fromcolour-magnitude diagrams. combining information from photometry andspectroscopy, several studies suggested that an age spread of several gyr hasto be invoked to explain (at least partially) some of the observed features.however, a comprehensive understanding of the formation, evolution and chemicalenrichment processes is still not at hand. relatively metal-rich omega censtars display neutron-capture abundance distributions dominated bycontributions from the s-process, but it is not clear what roles have beenplayed by the so-called main and weak s-process components in generating theseabundances. to gain better insight into this question we derived lead (pb)abundances for several cluster members, because this element can only beproduced by the main s-process. we analysed high-resolution uves@vlt spectra ofa sample of twelve red-giant branch stars, deriving abundances of pb and alsoof y, zr, la, ce, eu, and the c+n+o sum. spectral synthesis was applied to allfeatures, taking into account isotopic shifts and/or hyperfine structure asneeded. we measured for the first time the pb content in omega cen, discoveringa clear hint for a pb production occurring at [fe/h]&gt;-1.7 dex. our data suggestthat the role of the weak component in the production of s-process elements isnegligible. moreover, evidence gathered from the abundances of other elementsindicates that the main component occurring in this gc is peculiar and shiftedtowards higher mass polluters than the standard one.

1304.7009	on the internal pollution mechanisms in the globular cluster ngc 6121  (m4): heavy-element abundances and agb models	globular clusters display significant variations in their light-elementcontent, pointing to the existence of a second stellar generation formed fromthe ejecta of an earlier generation. the nature of these internal polluters isstill a matter of debate: the two most popular scenarios indicateintermediate-mass agb stars and fast rotating massive stars. abundancesdetermination for some key elements can help distinguish between thesecompetitor candidates. we present in this paper y abundances for a sample of103 red giant branch stars in ngc 6121. within measurement errors, we find thatthe [y/fe] is constant in this cluster contrary to a recent suggestion. for asubsample of six stars we also find [rb/fe] to be constant, consistent withprevious studies showing no variation in other s-process elements. we alsopresent a new set of stellar yields for intermediate-mass agb stellar models of5 and 6 solar masses, including heavy element s-process abundances. theuncertainties on the mass-loss rate, the mixing-length parameter, and thenuclear reaction rates have a major impact on the stellar abundances. withinthe im-agb pollution scenario, the constant abundance of heavy elements insidethe cluster requires a marginal s-process efficiency in im-agb stars. such aconstrain could still be satisfied by the present models assuming a strongermass-loss rate. the uncertainties mentioned above are limiting the predictivepower of intermediate-mass agb models. for these reasons, at the moment we arenot able to clearly rule out their role as main polluters of the secondpopulation stars in globular clusters.

1307.4757	the fraction of first and second generation stars in globular clusters.  i the case of ngc 6752	we present a new method to estimate the fraction of stars with chemicalcomposition of first and second(s) generation(s) currently hosted in galacticglobular clusters (gcs). we compare cluster and field stars of similarmetallicity in the [fe/h]-[na/h] plane. since the phenomenon of multiplepopulations is only restricted to the cluster environment, the number of gcstars whose location coincides with that of field stars provides the fractionof first generation stars in that cluster. by exclusion, the fraction of secondgeneration stars is derived. we assembled a dataset of 1891 field stars of thethin disk, thick disk, and halo of the milky way in the metallicity range -3.15&lt;= [fe/h] &lt;= +0.48 dex and with na abundance from high resolution spectra. theyare mostly dwarfs, but include also giants. considering only the range inmetallicity spanned by most gcs extensively studied for the na-oanticorrelation (-2.36 &lt;= [fe/h] &lt;= -0.33 dex), we have 804 stars. the totalsample is homogeneized by offsets in [fe/h] and [na/h] with respect to areference sample using the same line list and nlte correction for na adopted ina recent extensive survey of gc stars. this fully accounts for offsets amonganalyses due to different temperature scales, line lists, adopted (orneglected) corrections for departures from lte. we illustrate our methodestimating the fraction of first and second generation stars in the wellstudied gc ngc 6752. as a by-product, the comparison of [na/h] values in gc andfield stars suggests that at least two classes of old stellar systems probablycontributed to the halo assembly: one group with characteristics similar to thecurrently existing gcs, and the other more similar to the present-day dwarfsatellite galaxies.

1308.4977	rubidium abundances in the globular clusters ngc 6752, ngc 1904 and ngc  104 (47 tuc)	large star-to-star variations of the abundances of proton-capture elements,such as na and o, in globular clusters (gcs) are interpreted as the effect ofinternal pollution resulting from the presence of multiple stellar populations.to better constrain this scenario we investigate the abundance distribution ofthe heavy element rubidium (rb) in ngc 6752, ngc 1904, and ngc 104 (47 tuc).combining the results from our sample with those in the literature, we foundthat rb exhibits no star-to-star variations, regardless the clustermetallicity, with the possible intriguing, though very uncertain, exception ofthe metal-rich bulge cluster ngc 6388. if no star-to-star variations will beconfirmed for all gcs, it implies that the stellar source of the proton-captureelement variations must not have produced significant amounts of rb. thiselement is observed to be enhanced at extremely high levels inintermediate-mass agb (im-agb) stars in the magellanic clouds (i.e., at ametallicity similar to 47 tuc and ngc 6388). this may present a challenge tothis popular candidate polluter, unless the mass range of the observed im-agbstars does not participate in the formation of the second-generation stars ingcs. a number of possible solutions are available to resolve this conundrum,also given that the magellanic clouds observations are very uncertain and mayneed to be revised. the fast rotating massive stars scenario would not facethis potential problem as the slow mechanical winds of these stars during theirmain-sequence phase do not carry any rb enhancements; however, these candidatesface even bigger issues such as the production of li and the closeover-imposition with core-collapse supernova timescales. observations of sr,rb, and zr in metal-rich clusters such as ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 are sorelyneeded to clarify the situation.

1311.2589	terzan 8: a sagittarius-flavoured globular cluster	massive globular clusters (gcs) contain at least two generations of starswith slightly different ages and clearly distinct light elements abundances.the na-o anticorrelation is the best studied chemical signature of multiplestellar generations. low-mass clusters appear instead to be usually chemicallyhomogeneous. we are investigating low-mass gcs to understand what is the lowermass limit where multiple populations can form, mainly using the na and oabundance distribution. we used vlt/flames spectra of giants in the low-mass,metal-poor gc terzan 8, belonging to the sagittarius dwarf galaxy, to determineabundances of fe, o, na, alpha-, fe-peak, and neutron-capture elements in sixstars observed with uves and 14 observed with giraffe. the average metallicityis [fe/h]=-2.27+/-0.03 (rms=0.08), based on the six high-resolution uvesspectra. only one star, observed with giraffe, shows an enhanced abundance ofna and we tentatively assign it to the second generation. in this cluster, atvariance with what happens in more massive gcs, the second generation seems torepresent at most a small minority fraction. we discuss the implications of ourfindings, comparing terzan 8 with the other sgr dsph gcs, to gcs and fieldstars in the large magellanic cloud, fornax, and in other dwarfs galaxies.

1401.2986	a sequence of nitrogen-rich very red giants in the globular cluster ngc  1851	we present the abundances of n in a sample of 62 stars on the red giantbranch (rgb) in the peculiar globular cluster ngc 1851. the values of [n/fe]ratio were obtained by comparing the flux measured in the observed spectra withthat from synthetic spectra for up to about 15 features of cn. this is thefirst time that n abundances are obtained for such a large sample of rgb starsfrom medium-resolution spectroscopy in this cluster. with these abundances weprovide a chemical tagging of the split red giant branch found from severalstudies in ngc 1851. the secondary, reddest sequence on the rgb is populatedalmost exclusively by n-rich stars, confirming our previous suggestion based onstromgren magnitudes and colours. these giants are also, on average, enrichedin s-process elements such as ba, and are likely the results of pollution fromlow mass stars that experienced episodes of third dredge-up in the asymptoticgiant branch phase.

1406.5513	lithium abundances in globular cluster giants: ngc 6218 (m12) and ngc  5904 (m5)	convergent lines of evidence suggest that globular clusters host multiplestellar populations. it appears that they experience at least two episodes ofstar formation whereby a fraction of first-generation stars contribute astratedejecta to form the second generation(s). to identify the polluting progenitorswe require distinguishing chemical signatures such as that provided by lithium.theoretical models predict that lithium can be synthesised in agb stars,whereas no net li production is expected from other candidates. it has beenshown that in order to reproduce the abundance pattern found in m4, liproduction must occur within the polluters, favouring the agb scenario. here wepresent li and al abundances for a large sample of rgb stars in m12 and m5.these clusters have a very similar metallicity, whilst demonstratingdifferences in several cluster properties. our results indicate that thefirst-generation and second-generation stars share the same li content in m12;we recover an abundance pattern similar to that observed in m4. in m5 we find ahigher degree of complexity and a simple dilution model fails in reproducingthe majority of the stellar population. in both clusters we require liproduction across the different stellar generations, but production seems tohave occurred to different extents. we suggest that such a difference might berelated to the cluster mass with the li production being more efficient inless-massive clusters. this is the first time a statistically significantcorrelation between the li spread within a gc and its luminosity has beendemonstrated. finally, although li-producing polluters are required to accountfor the observed pattern, other mechanisms, such as ms depletion, might haveplayed a role in contributing to the li internal variation, though atrelatively low level.

1410.3476	three discrete groups with homogeneous chemistry along the red giant  branch in the globular cluster ngc 2808	we present the homogeneous reanalysis of mg and al abundances from highresolution uves/flames spectra for 31 red giants in the globular cluster ngc2808. we found a well defined mg-al anticorrelation reaching a regime ofsubsolar mg abundance ratios, with a spread of about 1.4 dex in [al/fe]. themain result from the improved statistics of our sample is that the distributionof stars is not continuous along the anticorrelation as they are neatlyclustered into three distinct clumps each with different chemical composition.one group (p) shows the primordial composition of field stars of similarmetallicity, and the other two (i and e) have increasing abundances of al anddecreasing abundances of mg. the fraction of stars we found in the threecomponents (p: 68%, i: 19%, e: 13%) is in excellent agreement with the numberratios computed for the three distinct main sequences in ngc 2808: for thefirst time there is a clear correspondence between discrete photometricsequences of dwarfs and distinct groups of giants with homogeneous chemistry.the composition of the i group cannot be reproduced by mixing of matter withextreme processing in hot h-burning and gas with pristine, unprocessedcomposition, as also found in the recent analysis of three discrete groups inngc 6752. this finding suggests that different classes of polluters wereprobably at work also in ngc 2808.

1502.01341	on the serendipitous discovery of a li-rich giant in the globular  cluster ngc 362	we have serendipitously identified the first lithium-rich giant star locatedclose to the red giant branch bump in a globular cluster. throughintermediate-resolution flames spectra we derived a lithium abundance ofa(li)=2.55 (assuming local thermodynamical equilibrium), which is extremelyhigh considering the star's evolutionary stage. kinematic and photometricanalysis confirm the object as a member of the globular cluster ngc 362. thisis the fourth li-rich giant discovered in a globular cluster but the only oneknown to exist at a luminosity close to the bump magnitude. the three previousdetections are clearly more evolved, located close to, or beyond the tip oftheir red giant branch. our observations are able to discard the accretion ofplanets/brown dwarfs, as well as an enhanced mass-loss mechanism as a formationchannel for this rare object. whilst the star sits just above the cluster bumpluminosity, its temperature places it towards the blue side of the giant branchin the colour-magnitude diagram. we require further dedicated observations tounambiguously identify the star as a red giant: we are currently unable toconfirm whether li production has occurred at the bump of the luminosityfunction or if the star is on the pre zero-age horizontal branch. the latterscenario provides the opportunity for the star to have synthesised li rapidlyduring the core helium flash or gradually during its red giant branch ascentvia some extra mixing process.

1507.07553	five groups of red giants with distinct chemical composition in the  globular cluster ngc 2808	the chemical composition of multiple populations in the massive globularcluster (gc) ngc~2808 is addressed with the homogeneous abundance re-analysisof 140 red giant branch (rgb) stars. uves spectra for 31 stars and giraffespectra for the other giants were analysed with the same procedures used forabout 2500 giants in 23 gcs in our flames survey, deriving abundances of fe, o,na, mg, si, ca, ti, sc, cr, mn, and ni. iron, elements from alpha-capture, andin the fe-group do not show intrinsic scatter. on our uves scale themetallicity of ngc~2808 is [fe/h]=-1.129+/-0.005+/-0.034$ (+/-statistical+/-systematic error) with sigma=0.030 (31 stars). main features related toproton-capture elements are retrieved, but the improved statistics and thesmaller associated internal errors allow to uncover five distinct groups ofstars along the na-o anticorrelation. we observe large depletions in mg,anticorrelated with enhancements of na and also si, suggestive of unusuallyhigh temperatures for proton-captures. about 14% of our sample is formed bygiants with solar or subsolar [mg/fe] ratios. using the [na/mg] ratios weconfirm the presence of five populations with different chemical composition,that we called p1, p2, i1, i2, and e in order of decreasing mg and increasingna abundances. statistical tests show that the mean ratios in any pair ofgroups cannot be extracted from the same parent distribution. the overlap withthe five populations recently detected from uv photometry is good but notperfect, confirming that more distinct components probably exist in thiscomplex gc.

astro-ph;0001526	on the existence of differences in luminosity between horizontal branch  stars in globular clusters and in the field	the discrepancy between a long distance scale derived from hipparcos baseddistances to globular clusters via main sequence fitting to local subdwarfs,and a short distance scale derived from the absolute magnitude of field rrlyraes via statistical parallaxes and the baade-wesselink method could beaccounted for whether an intrinsic difference of about 0.1-0.2 mag was found toexist between horizontal branch (hb) stars populating the "sparse" generalfield and the "dense" globular clusters. in this paper we discuss the possibleexistence of such a systematic difference comparing the "period-shifts"observed for field and cluster rr lyraes. various approaches based on differentparameters and data-sets for both cluster and field variables were used inorder to establish the size of such a hypothetical difference, if any. we findthat on the whole very small not significant differences exist between theperiod-metallicity distributions of field and cluster rr lyraes, thusconfirming with a more quantitative approach, the qualitative conclusions bycatelan (1998). this observational evidence translates into a very smalldifference between the horizontal branch luminosity of field and cluster stars,unless rr lyraes in globular clusters are about 0.06 mo more massive than fieldrr lyrae at same metallicity, which is to be proven.

astro-ph;0002407	abundances of light elements in metal-poor stars. iii. data analysis and  results	we present the analysis of an extensive set of new and literature highquality data concerning fe, c, n, o, na, and mg, exploiting the teff scaledetermined in gratton et al. (1996), and the non-lte abundance correctionscomputed in gratton et al. (1999). results obtained with various abundanceindices are discussed and compared. our non-lte analysis yields the same oabundances from both permitted and forbidden lines for stars with teff&gt;4600 k,in agreement with king (1993), but not with other studies using a lowerteff-scale for subdwarfs. however we obtain slightly smaller o abundances forthe most luminous metal poor field stars than for fainter stars of similarmetallicities, an effect attributed to inadequacies of the adopted modelatmospheres (kurucz 1992, with overshooting) for cool stars. we find a nearlyconstant o overundance in metal poor stars ([fe/h]&lt;-0.8), at a mean value of0.46+-0.02 dex (sigma=0.12, 32 stars), with only a gentle slope with [fe/h] (~-0.1); this result is different from the steeper slope recently obtained usingoh band in the near uv. if only 'bonafide' unmixed stars are considered, cabundances scale with fe ones (i.e. [c/fe]~ 0) down to [fe/h]~ -2.5. due to ouradoption of a different teff-scale, we do not confirm the slight c excess inthe most metal poor disk dwarfs (-0.8&lt;[fe/h]&lt;-0.4) found in previous studies.na abundances scale as fe ones in the high metallicity regime, while metal-poorstars present a na underabundance. none of the field stars analyzed belong tothe group of o-poor and na-rich stars observed in globular clusters. na isdeficient with respect to mg in halo and thick disk stars; within thesepopulations, na deficiency may be a slow function of [mg/h]. solar [na/mg]ratios are obtained for thin disk stars.

astro-ph;0411241	abundances of c, n, o in slightly evolved stars in the globular clusters  ngc 6397, ngc 6752 and 47 tuc	abundances of c and n are derived from features due to the ch g-band and tothe uv cn band measured on high resolution (r ~ 40,000) uves spectra of morethan 40 dwarfs and subgiants in ngc 6397, ngc 6752 and 47 tuc. oxygenabundances (or upper limits) are available for all stars in the sample.isotopic ratios 12c/13c were derived from the ch molecular band. this is thefirst determination of this ratio in unevolved dwarf stars in globularclusters. by enlarging the sample of subgiants in ngc 6397 studied in grattonet al. (2001), we uncovered, for the first time, large variations in both naand o also in this cluster. the origin of the chemical inhomogeneities must besearched for outside the stars under scrutiny. our data indicate that inunevolved or slightly evolved stars in these clusters c abundances are low butnot zero, also in stars with large n-enhancements and o-depletions, and thatthe isotopic ratios 12c/13c are low, but never reach the equilibrium value ofthe cn-cycle. when coupled with the run of o and na abundances, these findingspossibly require that, in addition to cno burning and p-captures, sometriple-alpha process is also involved: previously evolved intermediate-mass agbstars are then the most likely polluters.

astro-ph;0412422	the binary frequency among carbon-enhanced, s-process rich, metal-poor  stars	we discuss radial velocities for a sample of carbon-enhanced, s-process rich,very metal-poor stars (cemp-s hereafter), analyzed with high-resolutionspectroscopy obtained over multiple epochs. we find that ~68% of the stars inthe sample show evidence of radial velocity variations. the expected detectionfraction for these stars, adopting the measured binary fraction in the field(~60%), and assuming that they share the same period and eccentricitydistribution, is ~22%. even if one assumes that the true binary fraction ofthese stars is 100%, the expected detection percentage is ~36%. these valuesindicate that the binary fraction among cemp-s stars is higher than the fieldbinary fraction, suggesting that all of these objects are in double (ormultiple) systems. the fact that the observed frequency of velocity variationexceeds the expected detection fraction in the case of an assumed binaryfraction of 100% is likely due to a more restricted distribution of orbitalperiods for these objects, as compared to normal field binaries. our resultsindicate that cemp-s stars are the metal-poor analogues of classical ch-stars.

astro-ph;0511144	abundances in red giant stars of ngc 2808 and correlations between  chemical anomalies and global parameters in globular clusters	we present the abundance analysis of stars from the tip of the red giantbranch (rgb) to below the rgb-bump in the globular cluster ngc 2808, based onhigh resolution echelle spectra. we derived abundances of al, alpha-processelements (si i, ca i, ti i and ti ii) and fe-group elements (sc ii, v i, cr i,cr ii, mn i, co i, ni i). apart from mg being somewhat reduced, likely becauseit has been depleted at the expense of al in the mgal cycle, the otheralpha-element ratios show the overabundance typical of halo stars of similarmetallicity. mn is underabundant, whereas fe-group elements have typicalabundance ratios near the solar value. we detect star-to-star differences in alabundances from the rgb tip down to the faintest star below the rgb-bump,correlated with na abundances at all luminosities. the slope of the na-alcorrelation is similar to the one found in m 13 by sneden et al. (2004), but itis different from those in other globular clusters of similar metallicity. wefind that the amount of chemical inhomogeneities along the na-o and mg-alanticorrelations in globular cluster red giants is correlated with the presentday cluster mass and ellipticity. moreover, we find for the first time acorrelation between the spread in proton-capture elements and orbitalparameters of clusters. the chemical anomalies are more extended in clustershaving large-sized orbits and longer periods, and in clusters with largerinclination angles of the orbit with respect to the galactic plane.

astro-ph;0511833	na-o anticorrelation and hb i. the na-o anticorrelation in ngc 2808	we derived atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances of fe, o and nafor about 120 red giant stars in the galactic globular cluster ngc 2808. ourresults are based on the analysis of medium-high resolution (r=22000-24000)giraffe spectra acquired with the flames spectrograph at vlt-ut2 as a part of aproject aimed at studying the na-o anticorrelation as a function of physicalparameters in globular clusters. we present here the anticorrelation of na ando abundances in ngc 2808, and we discuss the distribution function of starsalong this relation. besides a bulk of o-normal stars, with composition typicalof field halo stars, ngc 2808 seems to host two other groups of o-poor andsuper o-poor stars. in this regard, ngc 2808 is similar to m 13, the templatecluster for the na-o anticorrelation. however, at variance with m 13, moststars in ngc 2808 are o-rich. this might be related to the horizontal branchmorphologies which are very different in these two clusters. the averagemetallicity we found for ngc 2808 is [fe/h]=-1.10 (rms=0.065 dex, from 123stars). we also found some evidence of a small intrinsic spread in metallicity,but more definitive conclusions are hampered by the presence of a smalldifferential reddening.

astro-ph;0701174	na-o anticorrelation and hb. ii. the na-o anticorrelation in the  globular cluster ngc 6752	we are studying the na-o anticorrelation in several globular clusters ofdifferent horizontal branch (hb) morphology in order to derive a possiblerelation between (primordial) chemical inhomogeneities and morphologicalparameters of the cluster population. we used the multifiber spectrographflames on the eso very large telescope ut2 and derived atmospheric parametersand elemental abundances of fe, o and na for about 150 red giant stars in thegalactic globular cluster ngc 6752. the average metallicity we derive is[fe/h]=-1.56, in agreement with other results from red giants, but lower thanobtained for dwarfs or early subgiants. in ngc 6752 there is not much space foran intrinsic spread in metallicity: on average, the rms scatter in [fe/h] is0.037+/-0.003 dex, while the scatter expected on the basis of the major errorsources is 0.039+/-0.003 dex. the distribution of stars along the na-oanticorrelation is different to what was found in the first paper of thisseries for the globular cluster ngc 2808: in ngc 6752 it is skewed toward morena-poor stars, and it resembles more the one in m 13. detailed modeling isrequired to clarify whether this difference may explain the very differentdistributions of stars along the hb.

astro-ph;9902086	distances, ages, and epoch of formation of globular clusters	we review the results on distances and absolute ages of galactic globularclusters (gcs) obtained after the release of the hipparcos catalogue. severalmethods for the population ii local distance scale are discussed, exploitingnew results for rr lyraes in the large magellanic cloud (lmc). we find that theso-called short and long distance scales may be reconciled whether a consistentreddening scale is adopted for cepheids and rr lyrae variables in the lmc.distances and ages for the 9 clusters discussed in paper i are re-derived usingan enlarged sample of local subdwarfs, which includes about 90% of themetal-poor dwarfs with accurate parallaxes (delta p/p &lt; 0.12) in the wholehipparcos catalogue. on average, our revised distance moduli are decreased by0.04 mag with respect to paper i. the corresponding age of the gcs ist=11.5+-2.6 gyr (95% confidence range). the relation between mv(zahb) andmetallicity for the nine programme clusters turns out to bemv(zahb)=(0.18+-0.09)([fe/h]+1.5)+(0.53+-0.12).thanks to hipparcos the majorcontribution to the total error budget associated with the subdwarf fittingtechnique has been moved from parallaxes to photometric calibrations, reddeningand metallicity scale. this total uncertainty still amounts to about +-0.12mag. comparing the corresponding (true) lmc distance modulus 18.64+-0.12 magwith other existing determinations, we conclude that at present the bestestimate for the distance of the lmc is: 18.54+-0.03+-0.06, suggesting thatdistances from the subdwarf fitting method are 1 sigma too long. consequently,our best estimate for the age of the gcs is revised to: age = 12.9+-2.9 gyr(95% confidence range). the best relation between mv(zahb) and [fe/h] is:mv(zahb) =(0.18+-0.09)([fe/h]+1.5)+(0.63+-0.07).

astro-ph;9904238	an abundance analysis for five red horizontal branch stars in the  extremely metal rich globular cluster ngc 6553	we provide a high dispersion line-by-line abundance analysis of five red hbstars in the extremely metal rich galactic globular cluster ngc 6553. these redhb stars are significantly hotter than the very cool stars near the tip of thegiant branch in such a metal rich globular cluster and hence their spectra aremuch more amenable to an abundance analysis than would be the case for redgiants.  we find that the mean [fe/h] for ngc 6553 is -0.16 dex, comparable to themean abundance in the galactic bulge found by mcwilliam &amp; rich (1994) andconsiderably higher than that obtained from an analysis of two red giants inthis cluster by barbuy etal (1999). the relative abundance for the bestdetermined alpha process element (ca) indicates an excess of alpha processelements of about a factor of two. the metallicity of ngc 6553 reaches theaverage of the galactic bulge and of the solar neighborhood.

0811.3591	properties of second generation stars in globular clusters	we present the first results from the analysis of giraffe spectra of morethan 1200 red giants stars in 19 galactic globular clusters (gcs), to study thechemical composition of second generation stars and their link with globalcluster parameters. we confirm that the extension of the na-o anticorrelation(the most striking signature of polluted, second generation populations) isstrictly related to the very blue (and hot) extreme of the horizontal branch(hb). long anticorrelations seem to require large mass and large-sized,eccentric orbits, taking the gcs far away from the central regions of thegalaxy. we can separate three populations in each cluster (primordial,intermediate and extreme) based on the chemical composition. in all gcs weobserve a population of primordial composition, similar to field stars ofsimilar metallicity. we find that in all gcs the bulk (from 50 to 70%) of starsbelong to the intermediate component. finally, the extreme, very oxygen-poorcomponent is observed preferentially in massive clusters, but is not present inall massive gcs.
