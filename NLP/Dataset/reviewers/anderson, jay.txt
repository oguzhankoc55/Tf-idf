0812.4541	the acs survey of galactic globular clusters. vii. relative ages	the acs survey of galactic globular clusters is a hubble space telescope(hst) treasury program designed to provide a new large, deep and homogeneousphotometric database. based on observations from this program, we have measuredprecise relative ages for a sample of 64 galactic globular clusters bycomparing the relative position of the clusters' main sequence turn offs, usingmain-sequence fitting to cross-compare clusters within the sample. this methodprovides relative ages to a formal precision of 2-7%. we demonstrate that thecalculated relative ages are independent of the choice of theoretical model. wefind that the galactic globular cluster sample can be divided into two groups-- a population of old clusters with an age dispersion of ~5% and noage-metallicity relation, and a group of younger clusters with anage-metallicity relation similar to that of the globular clusters associatedwith the sagittarius dwarf galaxy.  these results are consistent with the milky way halo having formed in twophases or processes. the first one would be compatible with a rapid (&lt;0.8 gyr)assembling process of the halo, in which the clusters in the old group wereformed. also these clusters could have been formed before reionization in dwarfgalaxies that would later merge to build the milky way halo as predicted bylambda-cdm cosmology. however, the galactocentric metallicity gradient shown bythese clusters seems difficult to reconcile with the latter. as for the youngerclusters, it is very tempting to argue that their origin is related to theirformation within milky way satellite galaxies that were later accreted, but theorigin of the age-metallicity relation remains unclear.

0902.3197	"an era of precision astrophysics: connecting stars, galaxies and the  universe," an astro2010 science white paper	abridged: the golden age of astrophysics is upon us with both granddiscoveries (extra-solar planets, dark matter, dark energy) and precisioncosmology. fundamental understanding of the working of stars and galaxies iswithin reach, thanks to newly available precision measurements. we highlightthe importance of distances and model independent distances and masses.  distances are fundamental in astrophysics and their knowledge can change ourperception of phenomena dramatically: e.g., in antiquity, the heliocentricmodel was rejected because the predicted stellar parallaxes were not observed.  distance measurements are directly related to the history &amp; fate of the uni-verse as they provide 2 of 3 methods available to date the universe. the 1stmethod is based on the ages of stars, which can be ascertained if their lumi-nosities (distances) are accurately known. the 2nd method relies on cosmolo-gical methods. to 1st order, the age of the universe is the inverse h_0.  as stressed by the previous decadal report, "the fundamental goal of ...astrophysics is to understand how the universe ... galaxies [and] stars ...formed, how they evolved, and what their destiny will be." these questions canbe answered partly by micro-arcsecond astrometry: 1) galactic archeology: adetailed reconstruction of the formation history of the milky way and otherlocal group galaxies, 2) the very oldest stars in the milky way and the age ofthe universe, and 3) h_0 and concordance cosmology.  these goals are achievable by combining muas-arcsecond astrometry from theproposed sim-lite mission supplemented with ground-based spectroscopy. theresults of our proposed project will force the biggest reassessment of stellarastrophysics in 50 years, which will affect most branches of astrophysics.

0905.0627	new limits on an intermediate mass black hole in omega centauri: i.  hubble space telescope photometry and proper motions	we analyze data from the hubble space telescope's advanced camera for surveysof the globular cluster omega cen. we construct a photometric and proper-motioncatalog using the go-9442, go-10252, and go-10775 data sets. the 2.5- to 4-yearbaseline between observations yields a catalog of some 10^5 proper motions,with 53,382 high-quality measurements in a central field. we determine thecluster center to ~1-arcsecond accuracy using two different star-count methods,and a completely independent method using 2mass images. we also determine thekinematical center of the proper motions, which agrees with the star-countcenter to within its uncertainty. the proper-motion dispersion of the clusterincreases gradually inwards, but there is no variation in kinematics withposition within the central ~15 arcsec: there is no dispersion cusp and nostars with unusually high velocities. we measure for the first time in anyglobular cluster the variation in proper-motion dispersion with mass along themain sequence, and find the cluster not yet to be in equipartition. ourproper-motion results do not confirm the arguments put forward by noyola,gebhardt &amp; bergmann to suspect an intermediate-mass black hole (imbh) in omegacen. in paper ii we present new dynamical models for the high-quality datapresented here, with the aim of putting quantitative contraints on the mass ofany possible imbh.

0905.0638	new limits on an intermediate mass black hole in omega centauri: ii.  dynamical models	we present a detailed dynamical analysis of the projected density andkinematical data available for the globular cluster omega cen. we solve thespherical anisotropic jeans equation to predict the projected profiles of therms velocity in each of the three orthogonal coordinate directions (line ofsight, proper motion radial, and proper motion tangential). we fit the modelsto new hst star count and proper motion data near the cluster center presentedin paper i, combined with existing ground-based measurements. we also deriveand model the gauss-hermite moments of the observed proper motiondistributions. the projected density profile is consistent with being flat nearthe center, with an upper limit gamma=0.07 on the central logarithmic slope.the rms proper motion profile is also consistent with being flat near thecenter, and there are no unusually fast-moving stars. the models provide a goodfit and yield a 1-sigma upper limit mbh &lt; 1.2e4 solar masses on the mass of apossible intermediate-mass black hole (imbh). the inferred upper limitcorresponds to mbh/mtot &lt; 0.43%. we combine this with results for otherclusters and discuss the implications for globular cluster imbh demographics.tighter limits will be needed to rule out or establish whether globularclusters follow the same black hole demographics correlations as galaxies. thearguments put forward by noyola et al. (2008) to suspect an imbh in omega cenare not confirmed by our study; the imbh mass they suggested is firmly ruledout.

0911.2469	the acs survey of galactic globular clusters. ix. horizontal branch  morphology and the second parameter phenomenon	the horizontal branch (hb) morphology of globular clusters (gcs) is moststrongly influenced by metallicity. the second parameter phenomenonacknowledges that metallicity alone is not enough to describe the hb morphologyof all gcs. in particular, the outer galactic halo contains gcs with redder hbsat a given metallicity than are found inside the solar circle. thus, at least asecond parameter is required to characterize hb morphology. here we analyze themedian color difference between the hb and the red giant branch (rgb), d(v-i),measured from hst acs photometry of 60 gcs within ~20 kpc of the galacticcenter. analysis of this homogeneous data set reveals that, after the influenceof metallicity has been removed, the correlation between d(v-i) and age isstronger than that of any other parameter considered. expanding the sample toinclude hst photometry of the 6 most distant galactic gcs lends additionalsupport to the correlation between d(v-i) and age. this result is robust withrespect to the adopted metallicity scale and the method of age determination,but must bear the caveat that high quality, detailed abundance information isnot available for a significant fraction of the sample. when a subset of gcswith similar metallicities and ages are considered, a correlation betweend(v-i) and central luminosity density is exposed. with respect to the existenceof gcs with anomalously red hbs at a given metallicity, we conclude that age isthe second parameter and central density is most likely the third. importantproblems related to hb morphology in gcs, notably multi-modal distributions andfaint blue tails, remain to be explained.

0708.0027	the acs survey of galactic globular clusters: m54 and young populations  in the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy	we present new hubble space telescope photometry of the massive globularcluster m54 (ngc 6715) and the superposed core of the tidally disruptedsagittarius (sgr) dsph galaxy as part of the acs survey of galactic globularclusters. our deep (f606w~26.5), high-precision photometry yields anunprecedentedly detailed color-magnitude diagram showing the extended bluehorizontal branch and multiple main sequences of the m54+sgr system. thedistance and reddening to m54 are revised usingboth isochrone and main-sequencefitting to (m-m)_0=17.27 and e(b-v)=0.15. preliminary assessment finds them54+sgr field to be dominated by the old metal-poor populations of sgr and theglobular cluster. multiple turnoffs indicate the presence of at least twointermediate-aged star formation epochs with 4 and 6 gyr ages and [fe/h]=-0.4to -0.6. we also clearly show, for the first time, a prominent, 2.3 gyr old sgrpopulation of near-solar abundance. a trace population of even younger (0.1-0.8gyr old), more metal-rich ([fe/h]\sim0.6) stars is also indicated. the sgrage-metallicity relation is consistent with a closed-box model and multiple(4-5) star formation bursts over the entire life of the satellite, includingthe time since sgr began disrupting.

1007.3987	an empirical pixel-based correction for imperfect cte. i. hst's advanced  camera for surveys	we use an empirical approach to characterize the effect of charge-transferefficiency (cte) losses in images taken with the wide-field channel of theadvanced camera for surveys. the study is based on profiles of warm pixels in168 dark exposures taken between september and october 2009. the dark exposuresallow us to explore charge traps that affect electrons when the background isextremely low. we develop a model for the readout process that reproduces theobserved trails out to 70 pixels. we then invert the model to convert theobserved pixel values in an image into an estimate of the original pixelvalues. we find that when we apply the image-restoration process to scienceimages with a variety of stars on a variety of background levels, it restoresflux, position, and shape. this means that the observed trails containessentially all of the flux lost to inefficient cte. the space telescopescience institute is currently evaluating this algorithm with the aim ofoptimizing it and eventually providing enhanced data products. the empiricalprocedure presented here should also work for other epochs (eg., pre-sm4),though the parameters may have to be recomputed for the time when acs wasoperated at a higher temperature than the current -81 c. finally, thisempirical approach may also hold promise for other instruments, such as wfpc2,stis, the acs's hrc, and even wfc3/uvis.

1008.0634	hubble space telescope imaging of lyman alpha emission at z=4.4	we present the highest redshift detections of resolved lyman alpha emission,using hubble space telescope/acs f658n narrowband-imaging data taken inparallel with the wide field camera 3 early release science program in thegoods cdf-s. we detect lyman alpha emission from three spectroscopicallyconfirmed z = 4.4 lyman alpha emitting galaxies (laes), more than doubling thesample of laes with resolved lyman alpha emission. comparing the lightdistribution between the rest-frame ultraviolet continuum and narrowbandimages, we investigate the escape of lyman alpha photons at high redshift.while our data do not support a positional offset between the lyman alpha andrest-frame ultraviolet (uv) continuum emission, the half-light radii in two outof the three galaxies are significantly larger in lyman alpha than in therest-frame uv continuum. this result is confirmed when comparing object sizesin a stack of all objects in both bands. additionally, the narrowband fluxdetected with hst is significantly less than observed in similar filters fromthe ground. these results together imply that the lyman alpha emission is notstrictly confined to its indigenous star-forming regions. rather, the lymanalpha emission is more extended, with the missing hst flux likely existing in adiffuse outer halo. this suggests that the radiative transfer of lyman alphaphotons in high-redshift laes is complicated, with the interstellar-mediumgeometry and/or outflows playing a significant role in galaxies at theseredshifts.

1009.5694	uv-bright stellar populations and their evolutionary implications in the  collapsed-core cluster m15	we performed deep photometry of the central region of galactic globularcluster m15 from archival hubble space telescope data taken on the highresolution channel and solar blind channel of the advanced camera for surveys.our data set consists of images in far-uv (fuv$_{140}$; f140lp), near-uv(nuv$_{220}$; f220w), and blue (b$_{435}$; f435w) filters. the addition of anoptical filter complements previous uv work on m15 by providing an additionalconstraint on the uv-bright stellar populations. using color-magnitude diagrams(cmds) we identified several populations that arise from non-canonicalevolution including candidate blue stragglers, extreme horizontal branch stars,blue hook stars (bhks), cataclysmic variables (cvs), and helium-core whitedwarfs (he wds). due to preliminary identification of several he wd and bhkcandidates, we add m15 as a cluster containing a he wd sequence and suggest itbe included among clusters with a bhk population.  we also investigated a subset of cv candidates that appear in the gap betweenthe main sequence (ms) and wds in fuv$_{140}-$nuv$_{220}$ but lie securely onthe ms in nuv$_{220}-$b$_{435}$. these stars may represent a magnetic cv ordetached wd-ms binary population. additionally, we analyze our candidate he wdsusing model cooling sequences to estimate their masses and ages and investigatethe plausibility of thin vs. thick hydrogen envelopes. finally, we identify aclass of uv-bright stars that lie between the horizontal branch and wd coolingsequences, a location not usually populated on cluster cmds. we conclude thesestars may be young, low-mass he wds.

1010.0064	improving galactic center astrometry by reducing the effects of  geometric distortion	we present significantly improved proper motion measurements of the milkyway's central stellar cluster. these improvements are made possible by refiningour astrometric reference frame with a new geometric optical distortion modelfor the w. m. keck ii 10 m telescope's adaptive optics camera (nirc2) in itsnarrow field mode. for the first time, this distortion model is constructedfrom on-sky measurements, and is made available to the public. when applied towidely dithered images, it produces residuals in the separations of stars thatare a factor of ~3 smaller compared to the outcome using previous models. byapplying this new model, along with corrections for differential atmosphericrefraction, to widely dithered images of sio masers at the galactic center, weimprove our ability to tie into the precisely measured radio sgr a*-rest frame.the resulting infrared reference frame is ~2-3 times more accurate and stablethan earlier published efforts. in this reference frame, sgr a* is localized towithin a position of 0.6 mas and a velocity of 0.09 mas/yr, or ~3.4 km/s at 8kpc (1 sigma). while earlier proper motion studies defined a reference frame byassuming no net motion of the stellar cluster, this approach is fundamentallylimited by the cluster's intrinsic dispersion and therefore will not improvewith time. we define a reference frame with sio masers and this referenceframe's stability should improve steadily with future measurements of the siomasers in this region. this is essential for achieving the necessary referenceframe stability required to detect the effects of general relativity andextended mass on short-period stars at the galactic center.

1011.0457	the wfc3 galactic bulge treasury program: metallicity estimates for the  stellar population and exoplanet hosts	we present new uv-to-ir stellar photometry of four low-extinction windows inthe galactic bulge, obtained with the wide field camera 3 on the hubble spacetelescope (hst). using our five bandpasses, we have defined reddening-freephotometric indices sensitive to stellar effective temperature and metallicity.we find that the bulge populations resemble those formed via classicaldissipative collapse: each field is dominated by an old (~10 gyr) populationexhibiting a wide metallicity range (-1.5 &lt; [fe/h] &lt; 0.5). we detect ametallicity gradient in the bulge population, with the fraction of stars atsuper-solar metallicities dropping from 41% to 35% over distances from thegalactic center ranging from 0.3 to 1.2 kpc. one field includes candidateexoplanet hosts discovered in the sweeps hst transit survey. our measurementsfor 11 of these hosts demonstrate that exoplanets in the distinct bulgeenvironment are preferentially found around high-metallicity stars, as in thesolar neighborhood, supporting the view that planets form more readily inmetal-rich environments.

1102.1653	sodium-oxygen anticorrelation and neutron capture elements in omega  centauri stellar populations	omega centauri is no longer the only globular cluster known to containmultiple stellar populations, yet it remains the most puzzling. due to theextreme way in which the multiple stellar population phenomenon manifests inthis cluster, it has been suggested that it may be the remnant of a largerstellar system. in this work, we present a spectroscopic investigation of thestellar populations hosted in the globular cluster omega centauri to shed lighton its, still puzzling, chemical enrichment history. with this aim we usedflames+giraffe@vlt to observe 300 stars distributed along the multimodal redgiant branch of this cluster, sampling with good statistics the stellarpopulations of different metallicities. we determined chemical abundances forfe, na, o, and n-capture elements ba and la. we confirm that omega centauriexhibits large star-to-star variations in iron with [fe/h] ranging from ~ -2.0to ~ -0.7 dex. barium and lanthanum abundances of metal poor stars arecorrelated with iron, up to [fe/h] -1.5, while they are almost constant (or atleast have only a moderate increase) in the more metal rich populations. thereis an extended na-o anticorrelation for stars with [fe/h]&lt;~ -1.3 while moremetal rich stars are almost all na-rich. sodium was found to midly increasewith iron over all the metallicity range.

1105.4176	the first detection of blue straggler stars in the milky way bulge	we report the first detections of blue straggler stars (bss) in the bulge ofthe milky way galaxy. proper motions from extensive space-based observationsalong a single sight-line allow us to separate a sufficiently clean andwell-characterized bulge sample that we are able to detect a small populationof bulge objects in the region of the color-magnitude diagram commonly occupiedyoung objects and blue strgglers. however, variability measurements of theseobjects clearly establish that a fraction of them are blue stragglers. out ofthe 42 objects found in this region of the color-magnitude diagram, we estimatethat at least 18 are genuine bss. we normalize the bss population by ourestimate of the number of horizontal branch stars in the bulge in order tocompare the bulge to other stellar systems. the bss fraction is clearlydiscrepant from that found in stellar clusters. the blue straggler populationof dwarf spheroidals remains a subject of debate; some authors claim ananticorrelation between the normalised blue straggler fraction and integratedlight. if this trend is real, then the bulge may extend it by three orders ofmagnitude in mass. conversely, we find that the genuinely young (~5gy oryounger) population in the bulge, must be at most 3.4% under the mostconservative scenario for the bss population.

1106.1927	identification of faint chandra x-ray sources in the core-collapsed  globular cluster ngc 6397: evidence for a bimodal cataclysmic variable  population	we have searched for optical identifications for 79 chandra x-ray sourcesthat lie within the half-mass radius of the nearby, core-collapsed globularcluster ngc 6397, using deep hubble space telescope advanced camera for surveyswide field channel imaging in h-alpha, r, and b. photometry of these imagesallows us to classify candidate counterparts based on color-magnitude diagramlocation. in addition to recovering nine previously detected cataclysmicvariables (cvs), we have identified six additional faint cv candidates, a totalof 42 active binaries (abs), two millisecond pulsars (msps), one candidateactive galactic nucleus, and one candidate interacting galaxy pair. of the 79sources, 69 have a plausible optical counterpart. the 15 likely and possiblecvs in ngc 6397 mostly fall into two groups: a brighter group of six for whichthe optical emission is dominated by contributions from the secondary andaccretion disk, and a fainter group of seven for which the white dwarfdominates the optical emission. there are two possible transitional objectsthat lie between these groups. the faintest cvs likely lie near the minimum ofthe cv period distribution, where an accumulation is expected. the spatialdistribution of the brighter cvs is much more centrally concentrated than thoseof the fainter cvs and the active binaries. this may represent the result of anevolutionary process in which cvs are produced by dynamical interactions, suchas exchange reactions, near the cluster center and are scattered to largerorbital radii, over their lifetimes, as they age and become fainter.

1106.4307	globular clusters in the outer galactic halo: new hst/acs imaging of 6  globular clusters and the galactic globular cluster age-metallicity relation	color-magnitude diagrams (cmds) derived from hubble space telescope (hst)advanced camera for surveys f606w,f814w photometry of 6 globular clusters (gcs)are presented. the six gcs form two loose groupings in galactocentric distance(rgc): ic 4499, ngc 6426, and ruprecht 106 at ~15-20 kpc and ngc 7006, palomar15, and pyxis at ~40 kpc. the cmds allow the ages to be estimated from the mainsequence turnoff in every case. in addition, the age of palomar 5 (rgc ~ 18kpc) is estimated using archival hst wide field planetary camera 2 v,iphotometry. the age analysis reveals the following: ic 4499, ruprecht 106, andpyxis are 1-2 gyr younger than inner halo gcs with similar metallicities; ngc7006 and palomar 5 are marginally younger than their inner halo counterparts;ngc 6426 and palomar 15, the two most metal-poor gcs in the sample, are coevalwith all the other metal-poor gcs within the uncertainties. combined with ourprevious efforts, the current sample provides strong evidence that the galacticgc age-metallicity relation consists of two distinct branches. one suggests arapid chemical enrichment in the inner galaxy while the other suggestsprolonged gc formation in the outer halo. the latter is consistent with theouter halo gcs forming in dwarf galaxies and later being accreted by the milkyway.

1205.6863	the m31 velocity vector. i. hubble space telescope proper motion  measurements	we present the first proper motion measurements for the galaxy m31. weobtained new v-band imaging data with the hst acs/wfc and wfc3/uvis of aspheroid field near the minor axis, an outer disk field along the major axis,and a field on the giant southern stream. the data provide 5-7 year timebaselines with respect to pre-existing deep first-epoch observations. wemeasure the positions of thousands of m31 stars and hundreds of compactbackground galaxies in each field. high accuracy and robustness is achieved bybuilding and fitting a unique template for each individual object. the averageproper motion for each field is obtained from the average motion of the m31stars between the epochs with respect to the background galaxies. for the threefields, the observed proper motions (mu_w,mu_n) are (-0.0458, -0.0376),(-0.0533, -0.0104), and (-0.0179,-0.0357) mas/yr, respectively. the ability toaverage over large numbers of objects and over the three fields yields a finalaccuracy of 0.012 mas/yr. the robustness of the proper-motion measurements anduncertainties are supported by the fact that data from different instruments,taken at different times and with different telescope orientations, as well asmeasurements of different fields, all yield statistically consistent results.papers ii and iii explore the implications for our understanding of thehistory, future, and mass of the local group.

1205.6864	the m31 velocity vector. ii. radial orbit towards the milky way and  implied local group mass	we determine the velocity vector of m31 with respect to the milky way and usethis to constrain the mass of the local group, based on hst proper-motionmeasurements presented in paper i. we construct n-body models for m31 tocorrect the measurements for the contributions from stellar motions internal tom31. we also estimate the center-of-mass motion independently, using thekinematics of satellite galaxies of m31 and the local group. all estimates aremutually consistent, and imply a weighted average m31 heliocentric transversevelocity of (v_w,v_n) = (-125.2+/-30.8, -73.8+/-28.4) km/s. we correct for thereflex motion of the sun using the most recent insights into the solar motionwithin the milky way. this implies a radial velocity of m31 with respect to themilky way of v_rad = -109.3+/-4.4 km/s, and a tangential velocity v_tan = 17.0km/s (&lt;34.3 km/s at 1-sigma confidence). hence, the velocity vector of m31 isstatistically consistent with a radial (head-on collision) orbit towards themilky way. we revise prior estimates for the local group timing mass, includingcorrections for cosmic bias and scatter. bayesian combination with other massestimates yields m_lg = m_mw(vir) + m_m31(vir) = (3.17 +/- 0.57) x 10^12 solarmasses. the velocity and mass results imply at 95% confidence that m33 is boundto m31, consistent with expectation from observed tidal deformations.(abridged)

1212.1159	ultra-deep hubble space telescope imaging of the small magellanic cloud:  the initial mass function of stars with m &lt;~ 1 msun	we present a new measurement of the stellar initial mass function (imf) basedon ultra-deep, high-resolution photometry of &gt;5,000 stars in the outskirts ofthe small magellanic cloud (smc) galaxy. the hubble space telescope (hst)advanced camera for surveys (acs) observations reveal this rich, co-spatialpopulation behind the foreground globular cluster 47 tuc, which we targeted for121 hst orbits. the stellar main sequence of the smc is measured in the f606w,f814w color-magnitude diagram (cmd) down to ~30th magnitude, and is cleanlyseparated from the foreground star cluster population using proper motions. wesimulate the smc population by extracting stellar masses (single and unresolvedbinaries) from specific imfs, and converting those masses to luminosities inour bandpasses. the corresponding photometry for these simulated stars is drawndirectly from a rich cloud of 4 million artificial stars, thereby accountingfor the real photometric scatter and completeness of the data. over acontinuous and well populated mass range of m = 0.37 - 0.93 msun (i.e., down toa ~75% completeness limit at f606w = 28.7), we demonstrate that the imf is wellrepresented by a single power-law form with slope \alpha = -1.90(^{+0.15}_{-0.10}) (3 sigma error) (i.e., dn/dm \propto m^{\alpha}). this isshallower than the salpeter slope of \alpha = -2.35, which agrees with theobserved stellar luminosity function at higher masses. our results indicatethat the imf does {\it not} turn over to a more shallow power-law form withinthis mass range. we discuss implications of this result for the theory of starformation, the inferred masses of galaxies, and the (lack of a) variation ofthe imf with metallicity.

1212.2646	hst/acs imaging of omega centauri: optical counterparts of chandra x-ray  sources	we present results of a search for optical counterparts of x-ray sources inand toward the globular cluster omega centauri (ngc 5139) using the advancedcamera for surveys (acs) on the hubble space telescope. the acs data consist ofa mosaic of wide field channel (wfc) images obtained using f625w, f435w, andf658n filters; with 9 pointings we cover the central ~10'x10' of the clusterand encompass 109 known chandra sources. we find promising optical counterpartsfor 59 of the sources, ~40 of which are likely to be associated with thecluster. these include 27 candidate cataclysmic variables (cvs), 24 of whichare reported here for the first time. fourteen of the cv candidates are veryfaint, with absolute magnitudes in the range m_625 = 10.4 - 12.6, making themcomparable in brightness to field cvs near the period minimum discovered in thesdss (gansicke et al. 2009). additional optical counterparts include three bydra candidates, a possible blue straggler, and a previously-reported quiescentlow-mass x-ray binary (haggard et al. 2004). we also identify three foregroundstars and 11 probable active galactic nuclei. finally, we report the discoveryof a group of seven stars whose x-ray properties are suggestive of magneticallyactive binaries, and whose optical counterparts lie on or very near themetal-rich anomalous giant and subgiant branches in {\omega} cen. if theapparent association between these seven stars and the rgb/sgb-a stars is real,then the frequency of x-ray sources in this metal-rich population is enhancedby a factor of at least five relative to the other giant and subgiantpopulations in the cluster. if these stars are not members of the metal-richpopulation, then they bring to 20 the total number of red stragglers (alsoknown as sub-subgiants) that have been identified in {\omega} cen, the largestnumber yet known in any globular cluster.

1301.0832	third-epoch magellanic cloud proper motions i: hst/wfc3 data and orbit  implications	we present proper motions for the large &amp; small magellanic clouds (lmc &amp; smc)based on three epochs of \textit{hubble space telescope} data, spanning a $\sim7$ yr baseline, and centered on fields with background qsos. the first twoepochs, the subject of past analyses, were obtained with acs/hrc, and have beenreanalyzed here. the new third epoch with wfc3/uvis increases the time baselineand provides better control of systematics. the three-epoch data yield propermotion random errors of only 1-2% per field. for the lmc this is sufficient toconstrain the internal proper motion dynamics, as will be discussed in aseparate paper. here we focus on the implied center-of-mass proper motions:mu_w(lmc) = -1.910 +/- 0.020 mas/yr, mu_n(lmc) = 0.229 +/- 0.047 mas/yr, andmu_w(smc) = -0.772 +/- 0.063 mas/yr, mu_n(smc) = -1.117 +/- 0.061 mas/yr. wecombine the results with a revised understanding of the solar motion in themilky way to derive galactocentric velocities: v_{tot,lmc} = 321 +/- 24 km/sand v_{tot,smc} = 217 +/- 26 km/s. our proper motion uncertainties are nowdominated by limitations in our understanding of the internal kinematics andgeometry of the clouds, and our velocity uncertainties are dominated bydistance errors. orbit calculations for the clouds around the milky way allow arange of orbital periods, depending on the uncertain masses of the milky wayand lmc. periods $\lesssim 4$ gyr are ruled out, which poses a challenge fortraditional magellanic stream models. first-infall orbits are preferred (assupported by other arguments as well) if one imposes the requirement that thelmc and smc must have been a bound pair for at least several gyr.

1301.2338	hst proper motions of stars within globular clusters	the stable environment of space makes hst an excellent astrometric tool. itsdiffraction-limited resolution allows it to distinguish and measure positionsand fluxes for stars all the way to the center of most globular clusters. apartfrom small changes due to breathing, its psfs and geometric distortion havebeen extremely stable over its 20-year lifetime. there are now over 20 globularclusters for which there exist two or more well-separated epochs in thearchive, spanning up to 10+ years. our photometric and astrometric techniqueshave allowed us to measure tens of thousands of stars per cluster within onearcmin from the center, with typical proper-motion errors of ~0.02 mas/yr,which translates to ~0.8 km/s for a typical cluster. these high-qualitymeasurements can be used to detect the possible presence of a centralintermediate-mass black hole, and put constraints on its mass. in addition,they will provide a direct measurement of the cluster anisotropy andequipartition. we present preliminary results from this project, and discussthem in the context of what is already known from other techniques

1307.6217	a deep chandra x-ray limit on the putative imbh in omega centauri	we report a sensitive x-ray search for the proposed intermediate mass blackhole (imbh) in the massive galactic cluster, omega centauri (ngc 5139).combining chandra x-ray observatory data from cycles 1 and 13, we obtain a deep(~291 ks) exposure of the central regions of the cluster. we find no evidencefor an x-ray point source near any of the cluster's proposed dynamical centers,and place an upper limit on the x-ray flux from a central source of f_x(0.5-7.0kev) &lt;= 5.0x10^-16 erg cm^-2 s^-1, after correcting for absorption. thiscorresponds to an unabsorbed x-ray luminosity of l_x(0.5-7.0 kev) &lt;= 1.6x10^30erg s^-1, for a cluster distance of 5.2 kpc, galactic column density n_h =1.2x10^21 cm^-2, and powerlaw spectrum with gamma = 2.3. if a ~10^4 m_sun imbhresides in the cluster's core, as suggested by some stellar dynamical studies,its eddington luminosity would be l_edd ~10^42 erg s^-1. the new x-ray limitwould then establish an eddington ratio of l_x/l_edd &lt;~ 10^-12, a factor of ~10lower than even the quiescent state of our galaxy's notoriously inefficientsupermassive black hole sgr a*, and imply accretion efficiencies as low as eta&lt;~ 10^-6 - 10^-8. this study leaves open three possibilities: either omega cendoes not harbor an imbh or, if an imbh does exist, it must experience verylittle or very inefficient accretion.

1308.4633	optical proper motion measurements of the m87 jet: new results from the  hubble space telescope	we report new results from an hst archival program to study proper motions inthe optical jet of the nearby radio galaxy m87. using over 13 years of archivalimaging, we reach accuracies below 0.1c in measuring the apparent velocities ofindividual knots in the jet. we confirm previous findings of speeds up to 4.5cin the inner 6" of the jet, and report new speeds for optical components in theouter part of the jet. we find evidence of significant motion transverse to thejet axis on the order of 0.6c in the inner jet features, and superluminalvelocities parallel and transverse to the jet in the outer knot components,with an apparent ordering of velocity vectors possibly consistent with ahelical jet pattern. previous results suggested a global deceleration over thelength of the jet in the form of decreasing maximum speeds of knot componentsfrom hst-1 outward, but our results suggest that superluminal speeds persistout to knot c, with large differentials in very nearby features all along thejet. we find significant apparent accelerations in directions parallel andtransverse to the jet axis, along with evidence for stationary features inknots d, e, and i. these results are expected to place important constraints ondetailed models of kpc-scale relativistic jets.

1310.2096	hst absolute proper motions of ngc 6681 (m70) and the sagittarius dwarf  spheroidal galaxy	we have measured absolute proper motions for the three populationsintercepted in the direction of the galactic globular cluster ngc 6681: thecluster itself, the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy and the field. for thiswe used hubble space telescope acs/wfc and wfc3/uvis optical imaging dataseparated by a temporal baseline of 5.464 years. five background galaxies wereused to determine the zero point of the absolute-motion reference frame. theresulting absolute proper motion of ngc 6681 is ($\mu_{\alpha}\cos\delta,\mu_{\delta}$)=($1.58\pm0.18, -4.57\pm0.16$) \masyr. this is the first estimateever made for this cluster. for the sgr dsph we obtain($\mu_{\alpha}\cos\delta, \mu_{\delta})=(-2.54\pm0.18, -1.19\pm0.16$) \masyr,consistent with previous measurements and with the values predicted bytheoretical models. the absolute proper motion of the galaxy population in ourfield of view is ($\mu_{\alpha}\cos\delta, \mu_{\delta})=(-1.21\pm0.27,-4.39\pm0.26$) \masyr. in this study we also use background sagittarius dwarfspheroidal stars to determine the rotation of the globular cluster in the planeof the sky and find that ngc 6681 is not rotating significantly:\ $v_{\rmrot}=0.82\pm1.02$ km$\,$s$^{-1}$ at a distance of 1 arcmin from the clustercenter.

1312.1641	the acs survey of globular clusters. xiii. photometric calibration in  comparison with stetson standards	in this study we compare the photometric data of 34 milky way globularclusters, observed within the acs treasury program (pi: ata sarajedini) withthe corresponding ground-based data, provided by the photometric standard fieldcatalogs of stetson (2000, 2005). we focus on the transformation between thehst/acs f606w to v-band and f814w to i-band only. the goal is to assess thevalidity of the filter transformation equations by sirianni et al.(2005) withrespect to their dependence on metallicity, horizontal branch morphology, massand integrated (v-i) colour of the various globular clusters. such a dependenceis expected due to the fact that the transformation equations are based on theobservations of only one globular cluster, i.e., ngc 2419. surprisingly, thecorrelation between offset and metallicity is found to be weak, with a lowlevel significance. the correlation between offset and horizontal branchstructure, as well as total cluster mass is still weaker. based on theavailable data we do not find the photometric offset to be linked to multiplestellar populations, e.g., as found in ngc 0288, ngc 1851, and ngc 5139. theresults of this study show that there are small systematic offsets between thetransformed acs- and observed ground based photometry, and that these are onlyweakly correlated, if at all, with various cluster parameters and theirunderlying stellar populations. as a result, investigators wishing to transformglobular cluster photometry from the sirianni et al.(2005) ground-based v, isystem onto the stetson (2000) system simply need to add 0.040 (+/-0.012) tothe v-band magnitudes and 0.047 (+/-0.011) to the i-band magnitudes. this inturn means that the transformed acs (v-i) colours match the ground-based valuesfrom stetson (2000) to within ~0.01 mag.

1401.0239	microlensing events by proxima centauri in 2014 and 2016: opportunities  for mass determination and possible planet detection	we have found that proxima centauri, the star closest to our sun, will passclose to a pair of faint background stars in the next few years. using hubblespace telescope (hst) images obtained in 2012 october, we determine that thepassage close to a mag 20 star will occur in 2014 october (impact parameter1.6"), and to a mag 19.5 star in 2016 february (impact parameter 0.5"). asproxima passes in front of these stars, the relativistic deflection of lightwill cause shifts in the positions of the background stars by ~0.5 and 1.5 mas,respectively, readily detectable by hst imaging, and possibly by gaia andground-based facilities such as vlt. measurement of these astrometric shiftsoffers a unique and direct method to measure the mass of proxima. moreover, ifproxima has a planetary system, the planets may be detectable through theiradditional microlensing signals, although the probability of such detections issmall. with astrometric accuracies of 0.03 mas (achievable with hst spatialscanning), centroid shifts caused by jovian planets are detectable atseparations of up to 2.0" (corresponding to 2.6 au at the distance of proxima),and centroid shifts by earth-mass planets are detectable within a small band of8 mas (corresponding to 0.01 au) around the source trajectories. jovian planetswithin a band of about 28 mas (corresponding to 0.036 au) around the sourcetrajectories would produce a brightening of the source by &gt;0.01 mag and couldhence be detectable. estimated timescales of the astrometric and photometricmicrolensing events due to a planet range from a few hours to a few days, andboth methods would provide direct measurements of the planetary mass.

1401.0484	parallax beyond a kiloparsec from spatially scanning the wide field  camera 3 on the hubble space telescope	we use a newly developed observing mode on the hubble space telescope (hst)and wide field camera 3 (wfc3), spatial scanning, to increase source sampling athousand-fold and measure changes in source positions to a precision of 20--40microarcseconds, more than an order of magnitude better than attainable inpointed observations. this observing mode can usefully measure the parallaxesof bright stars at distances of up to 5 kpc, a factor of ten farther thanachieved thus far with hst. long-period classical cepheid variable stars in themilky way, nearly all of which reside beyond 1 kpc, are especially compellingtargets for parallax measurements from scanning, as they may be used to anchora determination of the hubble constant to ~1%. we illustrate the method bymeasuring to high precision the parallax of a classical cepheid, sy aurigae, ata distance of more than 2 kpc, using 5 epochs of spatial-scan data obtained atintervals of 6 months. rapid spatial scans also enable photometric measurementsof bright milky way cepheids---which would otherwise saturate even in theshortest possible pointed observations---on the same flux scale asextragalactic cepheids, which is a necessity for reducing a leading source ofsystematic error in the hubble constant. we demonstrate this capability withphotometric measurements of sy aur on the same system used for cepheids in typeia supernova host galaxies. while the technique and results presented here arepreliminary, an ongoing program with hst is collecting such parallaxmeasurements for another 18 cepheids to produce a better anchor for thedistance scale.

0802.4127	deep acs imaging in the globular cluster ngc6397: dynamical models	we present n-body models to complement deep imaging of the metal-poorcore-collapsed cluster ngc6397 obtained with the hubble space telescope. allsimulations include stellar and binary evolution in-step with the stellardynamics and account for the tidal field of the galaxy. we focus on the resultsof a simulation that began with 100000 objects (stars and binaries), 5%primordial binaries and population ii metallicity. after 16 gyr of evolutionthe model cluster has about 20% of the stars remaining and has reachedcore-collapse. we compare the color-magnitude diagrams of the model at this agefor the central region and an outer region corresponding to the observed fieldof ngc6397 (about 2-3 half-light radii from the cluster centre). thisdemonstrates that the white dwarf population in the outer region has sufferedlittle modification from dynamical processes - contamination of the luminosityfunction by binaries and white dwarfs with non-standard evolution histories isminimal and should not significantly affect measurement of the cluster age. wealso show that the binary fraction of main-sequence stars observed in thengc6397 field can be taken as representative of the primordial binary fractionof the cluster. for the mass function of the main-sequence stars we find thatalthough this has been altered significantly by dynamics over the clusterlifetime, especially in the central and outer regions, that the position of theobserved field is close to optimal for recovering the initial mass function ofthe cluster stars (below the current turn-off mass). more generally we look athow the mass function changes with radius in a dynamically evolved stellarcluster and suggest where the best radial position to observe the initial massfunction is for clusters of any age.

0803.0740	a deep hst study of the globular cluster ngc 6397: reduction methods	we describe here the reduction methods that we developed to study thefaintest red dwarfs and white dwarfs in an outer field of ngc6397, which wasobserved by \hst for 126 orbits in 2005. the particular challenge of this dataset is that the faintest stars are not readily visible in individual exposures,so special care must be taken to combine the information in all the exposuresin order to identify and measure them. unfortunately, it is hard to find thefaintest stars without also finding a large number of faint galaxies, so wedeveloped specialized tools to distinguish between the point-like stars and thebarely resolved galaxies. we found that artificial-star tests, while obviouslynecessary for completeness determination, can also play an important role inhelping us optimize our finding and measuring algorithms. although this paperfocuses on this data set specifically, many of the techniques are new and mightfind application in other work, particularly when a large number of images isavailable for a single field.

1408.3408	hubble space telescope proper motions along the sagittarius stream: i.  observations and results for stars in four fields	we present a multi-epoch hubble space telescope (hst) study of stellar propermotions (pms) for four fields spanning 200 degrees along the sagittarius (sgr)stream: one trailing arm field, one field near the sgr dwarf spheroidal tidalradius, and two leading arm fields. we determine absolute pms of dozens ofindividual stars per field, using established techniques that use distantbackground galaxies as stationary reference frame. stream stars are identifiedbased on combined color-magnitude diagram and pm information. the results arebroadly consistent with the few existing pm measurements for the sgr galaxy andthe trailing arm. however, our new results provide the highest pm accuracy forthe stream to date, the first pm measurements for the leading arm, and thefirst pm measurements for individual stream stars; we also serendipitouslydetermine the pm of the globular cluster ngc~6652. in the trailing-arm field,the individual pms allow us to kinematically separate trailing-arm stars fromleading-arm stars that are 360 degrees further ahead in their orbit. also, inthree of our fields we find indications that two distinct kinematicalcomponents may exist within the same arm and wrap of the stream. qualitativecomparison of the hst data to the predictions of the law &amp; majewski andpenarrubia et al. n-body models show that the pm measurements closely followthe predicted trend with sgr longitude. this provides a successful consistencycheck on the pm measurements, as well as on these n-body approaches (which werenot tailored to fit any pm data).

0804.1354	ogle-2005-blg-071lb, the most massive m-dwarf planetary companion?	we combine all available information to constrain the nature ofogle-2005-blg-071lb, the second planet discovered by microlensing and the firstin a high-magnification event. these include photometric and astrometricmeasurements from hubble space telescope, as well as constraints from higherorder effects extracted from the ground-based light curve, such as microlensparallax, planetary orbital motion and finite-source effects. our primaryanalysis leads to the conclusion that the host of jovian planetogle-2005-blg-071lb is an m dwarf in the foreground disk with mass m= 0.46 +/-0.04 msun, distance d_l = 3.3 +/- 0.4 kpc, and thick-disk kinematics v_lsr ~103 km/s. from the best-fit model, the planet has mass m_p = 3.8 +/- 0.4 m_jup,lies at a projected separation r_perp = 3.6 +/- 0.2 au from its host and so hasan equilibrium temperature of t ~ 55 k, i.e., similar to neptune. a degeneratemodel less favored by \delta\chi^2 = 2.1 (or 2.2, depending on the sign of theimpact parameter) gives similar planetary mass m_p = 3.4 +/- 0.4 m_jup with asmaller projected separation, r_\perp = 2.1 +/- 0.1 au, and higher equilibriumtemperature t ~ 71 k. these results from the primary analysis suggest thatogle-2005-blg-071lb is likely to be the most massive planet yet discovered thatis hosted by an m dwarf. however, the formation of such high-mass planetarycompanions in the outer regions of m-dwarf planetary systems is predicted to beunlikely within the core-accretion scenario. there are a number of caveats tothis primary analysis, which assumes (based on real but limited evidence) thatthe unlensed light coincident with the source is actually due to the lens, thatis, the planetary host. however, these caveats could mostly be resolved by asingle astrometric measurement a few years after the event.

1501.06564	disentangling the outflow and protostars in hh 900 in the carina nebula	hh 900 is a peculiar protostellar outflow emerging from a small,tadpole-shaped globule in the carina nebula. previous h{\alpha} imaging withhst/acs showed an ionized outflow with a wide opening angle that is distinctfrom the highly collimated structures typically seen in protostellar jets. wepresent new narrowband near-ir [fe ii] images taken with the wide field camera3 on the hubble space telescope that reveal a remarkably different structurethan h{\alpha}. in contrast to the unusual broad h{\alpha} outflow, the [fe ii]emission traces a symmetric, collimated bipolar jet with the morphology andkinematics that are more typical of protostellar jets. in addition, new geminiadaptive optics images reveal near-ir h$_2$ emission coincident with theh{\alpha} emission, but not the [fe ii]. spectra of these three componentstrace three separate and distinct velocity components: (1) h$_2$ from the slow,entrained molecular gas, (2) h{\alpha} from the ionized skin of theaccelerating outflow sheath, and (3) [fe ii] from the fast, dense, andcollimated protostellar jet itself. together, these data require a drivingsource inside the dark globule that remains undetected behind a large columndensity of material. in contrast, h{\alpha} and h$_2$ emission trace the broadoutflow of material entrained by the jet, which is irradiated outside theglobule. as it get dissociated and ionized, it remains visible for only a shorttime after it is dragged into the h ii region.

1502.00005	hubble space telescope proper motion (hstpromo) catalogs of galactic  globular clusters. ii. kinematic profiles and maps	we present kinematical analyses of 22 galactic globular clusters using thehubble space telescope proper motion (hstpromo) catalogues recently presentedin bellini et al. (2014). for most clusters, this is the first proper-motionstudy ever performed, and, for many, this is the most detailed kinematic studyof any kind. we use cleaned samples of bright stars to determine binnedvelocity-dispersion and velocity-anisotropy radial profiles and two-dimensionalvelocity-dispersion spatial maps. using these profiles, we search forcorrelations between cluster kinematics and structural properties. we findthat: (1) more centrally-concentrated clusters have steeper radialvelocity-dispersion profiles; (2) on average, at 1\sigma confidence in twodimensions, the photometric and kinematic centres of globular clusters agree towithin ~1", with a cluster-to-cluster rms of 4" (including observationaluncertainties); (3) on average, the cores of globular clusters have isotropicvelocity distributions to within 1% (\sigma_t/\sigma_r = 0.992 +/- 0.005), witha cluster-to-cluster rms of 2% (including observational uncertainties); (4)clusters generally have mildly radially anisotropic velocity distributions(\sigma_t/\sigma_r ~ 0.8-1.0) near the half-mass radius, with bigger deviationsfrom isotropy for clusters with longer relaxation times; (5) there is arelation between \sigma_minor/\sigma_major and ellipticity, such that the moreflattened clusters in the sample tend to be more anisotropic, with\sigma_minor/\sigma_major ~ 0.9-1.0. aside from these general results andcorrelations, the profiles and maps presented here can provide a basis fordetailed dynamical modelling of individual globular clusters. given the qualityof the data, this is likely to provide new insights into a range of topicsconcerning globular cluster mass profiles, structure, and dynamics.

1509.00513	hubble space telescope proper motion (hstpromo) catalogs of galactic  globular clusters. iii. dynamical distances and mass-to-light ratios	we present dynamical distance estimates for 15 galactic globular clusters anduse these to check the consistency of dynamical and photometric distanceestimates. for most of the clusters, this is the first dynamical distanceestimate ever determined. we extract proper-motion dispersion profiles usingcleaned samples of bright stars from the hubble space telescope proper-motioncatalogs recently presented in bellini et al. (2014) and compile a set ofline-of-sight velocity-dispersion profiles from a variety of literaturesources. distances are then estimated by fitting spherical, non-rotating,isotropic, constant mass-to-light (m/l) dynamical models to the proper-motionand line-of-sight dispersion profiles together. we compare our dynamicaldistance estimates with literature photometric estimates from the harris (1996,2010 edition) globular cluster catalog and find that the mean fractionaldifference between the two types is consistent with zero at just $-1.9 \pm 1.7\%$. this indicates that there are no significant biases in either estimationmethod and provides an important validation of the stellar-evolution theorythat underlies photometric distance estimates. the analysis also estimatesdynamical m/l ratios for our clusters; on average, the dynamically-inferred m/lratios agree with existing stellar-population-based m/l ratios that assume achabrier initial mass function (imf) to within $-8.8 \pm 6.4 \%$, implying thatsuch an imf is consistent with our data. our results are also consistent with akroupa imf, but strongly rule out a salpeter imf. we detect no correlationbetween our m/l offsets from literature values and our distance offsets fromliterature values, strongly indicating that our methods are reliable and ourresults are robust.

1509.04716	the arches cluster: extended structure and tidal radius	at a projected distance of ~26 pc from sgr a*, the arches cluster providesinsight to star formation in the extreme galactic center (gc) environment.despite its importance, many key properties such as the cluster's internalstructure and orbital history are not well known. we present an astrometric andphotometric study of the outer region of the arches cluster (r &gt; 6.25") usinghst wfc3ir. using proper motions we calculate membership probabilities forstars down to f153m = 20 mag (~2.5 m_sun) over a 120" x 120" field of view, anarea 144 times larger than previous astrometric studies of the cluster. weconstruct the radial profile of the arches to a radius of 75" (~3 pc at 8 kpc),which can be well described by a single power law. from this profile we place a3-sigma lower limit of 2.8 pc on the observed tidal radius, which is largerthan the predicted tidal radius (1 - 2.5 pc). evidence of mass segregation isobserved throughout the cluster and no tidal tail structures are apparent alongthe orbital path. the absence of breaks in the profile suggests that the archeshas not likely experienced its closest approach to the gc between ~0.2 - 1 myrago. if accurate, this constraint indicates that the cluster is on a progradeorbit and is located front of the sky plane that intersects sgr a*. however,further simulations of clusters in the gc potential are required to interpretthe observed profile with more confidence.

0807.0003	a glimpse into the past: the recent evolution of globular clusters	we present the serendipitous discovery of 195 extragalactic globular clusters(gcs) in one of the deepest optical images ever obtained, a 126 orbit hst/acsimaging study of the nearby galactic gc ngc 6397. the distant gcs are all foundsurrounding a bright elliptical galaxy in the field, and are among the faintestobjects detected in the image, with magnitudes 26 &lt; f814w &lt; 30. we measure theredshift of the parent elliptical galaxy, using gmos on gemini south, to be z =0.089 (375 mpc). this galaxy, and its associated clusters, therefore ranks asone of the most distant such systems discovered to date. the measured lightfrom these clusters was emitted 1.2 gyr ago (the lookback time) and thereforethe optical properties hold clues for understanding the evolution of gcs overthe past gyr. we measure the color function of the bright gcs and find thatboth a blue and red population exist, and that the colors of eachsub-population are redder than gcs in local elliptical galaxies of comparableluminosity. for the blue clusters, the observed color difference from z = 0.089to today is only slightly larger than predictions from stellar evolution (e.g.,changes in the luminosity and color of the main-sequence turnoff and themorphology of the horizontal branch). a larger color difference is found in thered clusters, possibly suggesting that they are very metal-rich and/orsignificantly younger than 12 gyr.

astro-ph;0006325	toward high-precision astrometry with wfpc2. i. deriving an accurate psf	the first step toward doing high-precision astrometry is the measurement ofindividual stars in individual images, a step that is fraught with dangers whenthe images are undersampled. the key to avoiding systematic positional error inundersampled images is to determine an extremely accurate point-spread function(psf). we apply the concept of the {\it effective} psf, and show that in imagesthat consist of pixels it is the epsf, rather than the often-used instrumentalpsf, that embodies the information from which accurate star positions andmagnitudes can be derived. we show how, in a rich star field, one can use theinformation from dithered exposures to derive an extremely accurate effectivepsf by iterating between the psf itself and the star positions that we measurewith it. we also give a simple but effective procedure for representing spatialvariations of the hst psf. with such attention to the psf, we find that we areable to measure the position of a single reasonably bright star in a singleimage with a precision of 0.02 pixel (2 mas in wf frames, 1 mas in pc), butwith a systematic accuracy better than 0.002 pixel (0.2 mas in wf, 0.1 mas inpc), so that multiple observations can reliably be combined to improve theaccuracy by $\surd n$.

astro-ph;0412328	transforming observational data and theoretical isochrones into the  acs/wfc vega-mag system	we propose a zero-point photometric calibration of the data from the acs/wfcon board the hubble space telescope, based on a spectrum of vega and the mostup to date in-flight transmission curves of the camera. this calibration isaccurate at the level of a few hundredths of a magnitude. the main purpose ofthis effort is to transform the entire set of evolutionary models bypietrinferni et al. (2004) into a simple observational photometric system foracs/wfc data, and make them available to the astronomical community. we providethe zero points for the most used acs/wfc bands, and give basic recipes forcalibrating both the observed data and the models.  we also present the colour magnitude diagram (cmd) from acs data of 5galactic globular clusters, spanning the metallicity range -2.2&lt;[fe/h]&lt;-0.04,and provide fiducial points representing their sequences from severalmagnitudes below the turnoff to the red giant branch tip. the observedsequences are compared with the models in the newly defined photometric system.

astro-ph;0604541	ground-based ccd astrometry with wide field imagers. i. [observations  just a few years apart allow decontamination of field objects from members in  two globular clusters.]	this paper is the first of a series of papers in which we will apply themethods we have developed for high-precision astrometry (and photometry) withthe hubble space telescope to the case of wide-field ground-based images. inparticular, we adapt the software originally developed for wfpc2 toground-based, wide field images from the wfi at the eso 2.2m telescope. in thispaper, we describe in details the new software, we characterize the wfigeometric distortion, discuss the adopted local transformation approach forproper-motion measurements, and apply the new technique to two-epoch archivedata of the two closest galactic globular clusters: ngc 6121 (m4) and ngc 6397.the results of this exercise are more than encouraging. we find that we canachieve a precision of ~7 mas (in each coordinate) in a single exposure for awell-exposed star, which allows a very good cluster-field separation in bothm4, and ngc 6397, with a temporal baseline of only 2.8, and 3.1 years,respectively.

astro-ph;0606038	identification of the ogle-2003-blg-235/moa-2003-blg-53 planetary host  star	we present the results of hst observations of the host star for the firstdefinitive extrasolar planet detected by microlensing. the light curve modelfor this event predicts that the lens star should be separated from the sourcestar by ~6mas at the time of the hst images. if the lens star is a late g, k orearly m dwarf, then it will be visible in the hst images as an additionalsource of light that is blended with the source image. unless the lens andsource have exactly the same colors, its presence will also be revealed by asystematic shift between centroids of the source plus lens in different filterbands. the hst data indicates both of these effects: the hst source thatmatches the position of the source star is 0.21 magnitudes brighter in theacs/hrc-f814w filter than the microlensing model predicts, and there is anoffset of ~0.7mas between the centroid of this source in the f814w and f435wfilter bands. we conclude the planetary host star has been detected in thesehst images, and this identification of the lens star enables a completesolution of the lens system. the lens parameters are determined with a bayesiananalysis, averaging over uncertainties in the measured parameters, interstellarextinction, and allowing for the possibility of a binary companion to thesource star. this yields a stellar mass of m_* = 0.63(+0.07/-0.09) m_solar anda planet mass of m_p = 2.6 (+0.8/-0.6) m_jup at an orbital separation of 4.3(+2.5/-0.8) au. thus, the lens system resembles our own solar system, with aplanet of ~3 jupiter-masses in a jupiter-like orbit around a star of two-thirdsof a solar mass. these conclusions can be tested with future hst images, whichshould reveal a broadening of the blended source-plus-lens point spreadfunction due to the relative lens-source proper motion.

astro-ph;0607597	hst proper motions and stellar dynamics in the core of the globular  cluster 47 tucanae	we have used hst imaging of the central regions (r&lt;100 arcsec, about 5 coreradii) of the globular cluster 47 tucanae to derive proper motions and u- andv-band magnitudes for 14,366 cluster members. we also present a catalogue ofastrometry and f475w photometry for nearly 130,000 stars in a rather largercentral area. these data are made available in their entirety, in the form ofdownloadable electronic tables. we use them first to obtain a new estimate forthe position of the cluster center and to define the stellar density profileinto essentially zero radius. we then search in particular for any veryfast-moving stars, such as might be expected to result from very close stellarencounters. likely fewer than 0.1% (and no more than about 0.3%) of stars havetotal speeds above the nominal central escape velocity in 47 tuc, and at lowerspeeds the velocity distribution is described very well by a regular kingmodel. considerations of only the proper-motion velocity dispersion then leadto a number of results: (1) blue stragglers in the core of 47 tuc have avelocity dispersion lower than that of the cluster giants by a factor ofsqrt{2}. (2) the velocity distribution in the cluster center is essentiallyisotropic, as expected. (3) using a sample of radial velocities for stars inthe core, we estimate the distance to 47 tuc: d = 4.0 +/- 0.35 kpc. and (4) weinfer a 1-sigma upper limit of m&lt;1000-1500 solar masses for any central,intermediate-mass black hole. we can neither confirm nor refute the hypothesisthat 47 tuc might lie on an extension of the m-sigma relation observed forsupermassive black holes in galaxy bulges.

0809.1682	stellar proper motions in the galactic bulge from deep hst acs/wfc  photometry	we present stellar proper motions in the galactic bulge from the sagittariuswindow eclipsing extrasolar search (sweeps) project using acs/wfc on hst.proper motions are extracted for more than 180,000 objects, with &gt;81,000measured to accuracy better than 0.3 mas/yr in both coordinates. we reportseveral results based on these measurements: 1. kinematic separation of bulgefrom disk allows a sample of &gt;15,000 bulge objects to be extracted based on&gt;6-sigma detections of proper motion, with &lt;0.2% contamination from the disk.this includes the first detection of a candidate bulge blue stragglerpopulation. 2. armed with a photometric distance modulus on a star by starbasis, and using the large number of stars with high-quality proper motionmeasurements to overcome intrinsic scatter, we dissect the kinematic propertiesof the bulge as a function of distance along the line of sight. this allows usto extract the stellar circular speed curve from proper motions alone, which wecompare with the circular speed curve obtained from radial velocities. 3. wetrace the variation of the {l,b} velocity ellipse as a function of depth. 4.finally, we use the density-weighted {l,b} proper motion ellipse produced fromthe tracer stars to assess the kinematic membership of the sixteen transitingplanet candidates discovered in the sagittarius window; the kinematicdistribution of the planet candidates is consistent with that of the disk andbulge stellar populations.

astro-ph;0611448	characterization of gravitational microlensing planetary host stars	the gravitational microlensing light curves that reveal the presence ofextrasolar planets generally yield the planet-star mass ratio and separation inunits of the einstein ring radius. the microlensing method does not require thedetection of light from the planetary host star. this allows the detection ofplanets orbiting very faint stars, but it also makes it difficult to convertthe planet-star mass ratio to a value for the planet mass. we show that in manycases, the lens stars are readily detectable with high resolution space-basedfollow-up observations in a single passband. when the lens star is detected,the lens-source relative proper motion can also be measured, and this allowsthe masses of the planet and its host star to be determined and the star-planetseparation can be converted to physical units. observations in multiplepassbands provide redundant information, which can be used to confirm thisinterpretation. for the recently detected super-earth planet,ogle-2005-blg-169lb, we show that the lens star will definitely be detectablewith observations by the hubble space telescope (hst) unless it is a stellarremnant. finally, we show that most planets detected by a space-basedmicrolensing survey are likely to orbit host stars that will be detected andcharacterized by the same survey.

astro-ph;0701738	the white dwarf cooling sequence of ngc6397	we present the results of a deep hubble space telescope (hst) exposure of thenearby globular cluster ngc6397, focussing attention on the cluster's whitedwarf cooling sequence. this sequence is shown to extend over 5 magnitudes indepth, with an apparent cutoff at magnitude f814w=27.6. we demonstrate, usingboth artificial star tests and the detectability of background galaxies atfainter magnitudes, that the cutoff is real and represents the truncation ofthe white dwarf luminosity function in this cluster. we perform a detailedcomparison between cooling models and the observed distribution of white dwarfsin colour and magnitude, taking into account uncertainties in distance,extinction, white dwarf mass, progenitor lifetimes, binarity and cooling modeluncertainties. after marginalising over these variables, we obtain values forthe cluster distance modulus and age of \mu_0 = 12.02 \pm 0.06 and t_c = 11.47\pm 0.47gyr (95% confidence limits). our inferred distance and white dwarfinitial-final mass relations are in good agreement with other independentdeterminations, and the cluster age is consistent with, but more precise than,prior determinations made using the main sequence turnoff method. inparticular, within the context of the currently accepted \lambda cdmcosmological model, this age places the formation of ngc6397 at a redshift z=3,at a time when the cosmological star formation rate was approaching its peak.

0809.4263	new analysis of the proper motions of the magellanic clouds using  hst/wfpc2	in hst cycles 11 and 13 we obtained two epochs of acs/hrc data for fields inthe magellanic clouds centered on background quasars. we used these data todetermine the proper motions of the lmc and smc to better than 5% and 15%respectively. the results had a number of unexpected implications for the milkyway-lmc-smc system. the implied three-dimensional velocities were larger thanpreviously believed and close to the escape velocity in a standard 10^12 solarmass milky way dark halo, implying that the clouds may be on their firstpassage. also, the relative velocity between the lmc and smc was larger thanexpected, leaving open the possibility that the clouds may not be bound to eachother. to further verify and refine our results we requested an additionalepoch of data in cycle 16 which is being executed with wfpc2/pc due to thefailure of acs. we present the results of an ongoing analysis of these wfpc2data which indicate good consistency with the two-epoch results.

0812.0023	the wfc3 galactic bulge treasury program: a first look at resolved  stellar population tools	[abridged] when wfc3 is installed on hst, the community will have powerfulnew tools for investigating resolved stellar populations. the wfc3 galacticbulge treasury program will obtain deep imaging on 4 low-extinction fields.these non-proprietary data will enable a variety of science investigations notpossible with previous data sets. to aid in planning for the use of these dataand for future proposals, we provide an introduction to the program, itsphotometric system, and the associated calibration effort.  the observing strategy is based upon a new 5-band photometric system spanningthe uv, optical, and near-infrared. with these broad bands, one can constructreddening-free indices of teff and [fe/h]. besides the 4 bulge fields, theprogram will target 6 fields in well-studied star clusters, spanning a widerange of [fe/h]. the cluster data serve to calibrate the indices, providepopulation templates, and correct the transformation of isochrones into thewfc3 photometric system. the bulge data will shed light on the bulge formationhistory, and will also serve as population templates for other studies. one ofthe fields includes 12 candidate hosts of extrasolar planets.  cmds are the most popular tool for analyzing resolved stellar populations.however, due to degeneracies among teff, [fe/h], and reddening in traditionalcmds, it can be difficult to draw robust conclusions from the data. the 5-bandsystem used for the bulge treasury observations will provide indices that areroughly orthogonal in teff and [fe/h], and we argue that model fitting in anindex-index diagram will make better use of the information than fittingseparate cmds. we provide simulations to show the expected data quality and thepotential for differentiating between different star-formation histories.
