0912.2040	the spectral energy distribution of fermi bright blazars	(abridged) we have conducted a detailed investigation of the broad-bandspectral properties of the \gamma-ray selected blazars of the fermi lat brightagn sample (lbas). by combining our accurately estimated fermi gamma-rayspectra with swift, radio, infra-red, optical and other hard x-ray/gamma-raydata, collected within three months of the lbas data taking period, we wereable to assemble high-quality and quasi-simultaneous spectral energydistributions (sed) for 48 lbas blazars.the sed of these gamma-ray sources issimilar to that of blazars discovered at other wavelengths, clearly showing, inthe usual log $\nu $ - log $\nu$ f$_\nu$ representation, the typical broad-bandspectral signatures normally attributed to a combination of low-energysynchrotron radiation followed by inverse compton emission of one or morecomponents. we have used these seds to characterize the peak intensity of boththe low and the high-energy components. the results have been used to deriveempirical relationships that estimate the position of the two peaks from thebroad-band colors (i.e. the radio to optical and optical to x-ray spectralslopes) and from the gamma-ray spectral index. our data show that thesynchrotron peak frequency $\nu_p^s$ is positioned between 10$^{12.5}$ and10$^{14.5}$ hz in broad-lined fsrqs and between $10^{13}$ and $10^{17}$ hz infeatureless bl lacertae objects.we find that the gamma-ray spectral slope isstrongly correlated with the synchrotron peak energy and with the x-rayspectral index, as expected at first order in synchrotron - inverse comptonscenarios. however, simple homogeneous, one-zone, synchrotron self compton(ssc) models cannot explain most of our seds, especially in the case of fsrqsand low energy peaked (lbl) bl lacs.

1009.2666	a novel approach in constraining electron spectra in blazar jets: the  case of markarian 421	we report results from the observations of the well studied tev blazar mrk421 with the swift and the suzaku satellites in december 2008. during theobservation, mrk 421 was found in a relatively low activity state, with thecorresponding 2-10 kev flux of $3 \times 10^{-10}$ erg/s/cm^2. for the purposeof robust constraining the uv-to-x-ray emission continuum we selected only thedata corresponding to truly simultaneous time intervals between swift andsuzaku, allowing us to obtain a good-quality, broad-band spectrum despite amodest length (0.6 ksec) exposure. we analyzed the spectrum with the parametricforward-fitting synchrotron model implemented in xspec assuming two differentrepresentations of the underlying electron energy distribution, both wellmotivated by the current particle acceleration models: a power-law distributionabove the minimum energy $\gamma_{\rm min}$ with an exponential cutoff at themaximum energy $\gamma_{\rm max}$, and a modified ultra-relativistic maxwellianwith an equilibrium energy $\gamma_{\rm eq}$. we found that the latter impliesunlikely physical conditions within the blazar zone of mrk 421. on the otherhand, the exponentially moderated power-law electron distribution gives twopossible sets of the model parameters: (i) flat spectrum $dn'_e/d\gamma \propto\gamma^{-1.91}$ with low minimum electron energy $\gamma_{\rm min}&lt;10^3$, and(ii) steep spectrum $\propto \gamma^{-2.77}$ with high minimum electron energy$\gamma_{\rm min}\simeq 2\times10^4$. we discuss different interpretations ofboth possibilities in the context of a diffusive acceleration of electrons atrelativistic, sub- or superluminal shocks. we also comment on how exactly thegamma-ray data can be used to discriminate between the proposed differentscenarios.

1012.2200	spectral energy distribution of markarian 501: quiescent state vs.  extreme outburst	the very high energy (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) blazar markarian 501 has awell-studied history of extreme spectral variability and is an excellentlaboratory for studying the physical processes within the jets of activegalactic nuclei. however, there are few detailed multiwavelength studies ofmarkarian 501 during its quiescent state, due to its low luminosity. ashort-term multiwavelength study of markarian 501 was coordinated in march2009, focusing around a multi-day observation with the suzaku x-ray satelliteand including {\gamma}-ray data from veritas, magic, and the fermi gamma-rayspace telescope with the goal of providing a well-sampled multiwavelengthbaseline measurement of markarian 501 in the quiescent state. the results ofthese quiescent-state observations are compared to the historically extremeoutburst of april 16, 1997, with the goal of examining variability of thespectral energy distribution between the two states. the derived broadbandspectral energy distribution shows the characteristic double-peaked profile. wefind that the x-ray peak shifts by over two orders of magnitude in photonenergy between the two flux states while the vhe peak varies little. thelimited shift in the vhe peak can be explained by the transition to theklein-nishina regime. synchrotron self-compton models are matched to the dataand the implied klein-nishina effects are explored.

0709.2640	neutrino triggered target of opportunity (ntoo) test run with amanda-ii  and magic	kilometer scale neutrino telescopes are now being constructed (icecube) anddesigned (km3net). while no neutrino flux of cosmic origin has been discoveredso far, the first weak signals are expected to be discerned in the next fewyears. multi-messenger (observations combining different kinds of emission)investigations can enhance the discovery chance for neutrinos in case ofcorrelations. one possible application is the search for time correlations ofhigh energy neutrinos and established signals. we show the first adaptation ofa target of opportunity strategy to collect simultaneous data of high energyneutrinos and gamma-rays. neutrino events with coordinates close to preselectedcandidate sources are used to alert gamma-ray observations. the detection of apositive coincidence can enhance the neutrino discovery chance. more generally,this scheme of operation can increase the availability of simultaneousobservations. if cosmic neutrino signals can be established, the combinedobservations will allow time correlation studies and therefore constraints onthe source modeling. a first technical implementation of this scheme involvingamanda-ii and magic has been realized for few pre-selected sources in a shorttest run (sept. to dec. 2006), showing the feasability of the concept. resultsfrom this test run are shown.

1107.3370	broad line radio galaxies observed with fermi-lat: the origin of the gev  gamma-ray emission	we report on a detailed investigation of the gamma-ray emission from 18 broadline radio galaxies (blrgs) based on two years of fermi large area telescope(lat) data. we confirm the previously reported detections of 3c 120 and 3c 111in the gev photon energy range; a detailed look at the temporal characteristicsof the observed gamma-ray emission reveals in addition possible fluxvariability in both sources. no statistically significant gamma-ray detectionof the other blrgs was however found in the considered dataset. though thesample size studied is small, what appears to differentiate 3c 111 and 3c 120from the blrgs not yet detected in gamma-rays is the particularly strongnuclear radio flux. this finding, together with the indications of thegamma-ray flux variability and a number of other arguments presented, indicatethat the gev emission of blrgs is most likely dominated by the beamed radiationof relativistic jets observed at intermediate viewing angles. in this paper wealso analyzed a comparison sample of high accretion-rate seyfert 1 galaxies,which can be considered radio-quiet counterparts of blrgs, and found none weredetected in gamma-rays. a simple phenomenological hybrid model applied for thebroad-band emission of the discussed radio-loud and radio-quiet type 1 activegalaxies suggests that the relative contribution of the nuclear jets to theaccreting matter is &gt; 1 percent on average for blrgs, whilst &lt;0.1 percent forseyfert 1 galaxies.

1107.4977	gamma-ray and parsec-scale jet properties of a complete sample of  blazars from the mojave program	we investigate the fermi lat gamma-ray and 15 ghz vlba radio properties of ajoint gamma-ray- and radio-selected sample of agns obtained during the first 11months of the fermi mission (2008 aug 4 - 2009 jul 5). our sample contains thebrightest 173 agns in these bands above declination -30 deg. during thisperiod, and thus probes the full range of gamma-ray loudness (gamma-ray toradio band luminosity ratio) in the bright blazar population. the latterquantity spans at least four orders of magnitude, reflecting a wide range ofspectral energy distribution (sed) parameters in the bright blazar population.the bl lac objects, however, display a linear correlation of increasinggamma-ray loudness with synchrotron sed peak frequency, suggesting a universalsed shape for objects of this class. the synchrotron self-compton model isfavored for the gamma-ray emission in these bl lacs over external seed photonmodels, since the latter predict a dependence of compton dominance on dopplerfactor that would destroy any observed synchrotron sed peak - gamma-rayloudness correlation. the high-synchrotron peaked (hsp) bl lac objects aredistinguished by lower than average radio core brightness temperatures, andnone display large radio modulation indices or high linear core polarizationlevels. no equivalent trends are seen for the flat-spectrum radio quasars(fsrq) in our sample. given the association of such properties withrelativistic beaming, we suggest that the hsp bl lacs have generally lowerdoppler factors than the lower-synchrotron peaked bl lacs or fsrqs in oursample.

1202.2856	anisotropies in the diffuse gamma-ray background measured by the fermi  lat	the contribution of unresolved sources to the diffuse gamma-ray backgroundcould induce anisotropies in this emission on small angular scales. we analyzethe angular power spectrum of the diffuse emission measured by the fermi lat atgalactic latitudes |b| &gt; 30 deg in four energy bins spanning 1 to 50 gev. atmultipoles \ell \ge 155, corresponding to angular scales \lesssim 2 deg,angular power above the photon noise level is detected at &gt;99.99% cl in the 1-2gev, 2-5 gev, and 5-10 gev energy bins, and at &gt;99% cl at 10-50 gev. withineach energy bin the measured angular power takes approximately the same valueat all multipoles \ell \ge 155, suggesting that it originates from thecontribution of one or more unclustered source populations. the amplitude ofthe angular power normalized to the mean intensity in each energy bin isconsistent with a constant value at all energies, c_p/&lt;i&gt;^2 = 9.05 +/- 0.84 x10^{-6} sr, while the energy dependence of c_p is consistent with theanisotropy arising from one or more source populations with power-law photonspectra with spectral index \gamma_s = 2.40 +/- 0.07. we discuss theimplications of the measured angular power for gamma-ray source populationsthat may provide a contribution to the diffuse gamma-ray background.

1205.6474	constraints on the galactic halo dark matter from fermi-lat diffuse  measurements	we have performed an analysis of the diffuse gamma-ray emission with thefermi large area telescope in the milky way halo region searching for a signalfrom dark matter annihilation or decay. in the absence of a robust dark mattersignal, constraints are presented. we consider both gamma rays produceddirectly in the dark matter annihilation/decay and produced by inverse comptonscattering of the e+e- produced in the annihilation/decay. conservative limitsare derived requiring that the dark matter signal does not exceed the observeddiffuse gamma-ray emission. a second set of more stringent limits is derivedbased on modeling the foreground astrophysical diffuse emission using thegalprop code. uncertainties in the height of the diffusive cosmic-ray halo, thedistribution of the cosmic-ray sources in the galaxy, the index of theinjection cosmic-ray electron spectrum and the column density of theinterstellar gas are taken into account using a profile likelihood formalism,while the parameters governing the cosmic-ray propagation have been derivedfrom fits to local cosmic-ray data. the resulting limits impact the range ofparticle masses over which dark matter thermal production in the early universeis possible, and challenge the interpretation of the pamela/fermi-lat cosmicray anomalies as annihilation of dark matter.

1206.0745	the structure and emission model of the relativistic jet in the quasar  3c 279 inferred from radio to high-energy gamma-ray observations in 2008-2010	we present time-resolved broad-band observations of the quasar 3c 279obtained from multi-wavelength campaigns conducted during the first two yearsof the fermi gamma-ray space telescope mission. while investigating thepreviously reported gamma-ray/optical flare accompanied by a change in opticalpolarization, we found that the optical emission appears delayed with respectto the gamma-ray emission by about 10 days. x-ray observations reveal a pair of`isolated' flares separated by ~90 days, with only weak gamma-ray/opticalcounterparts. the spectral structure measured by spitzer reveals a synchrotroncomponent peaking in the mid-infrared band with a sharp break at thefar-infrared band during the gamma-ray flare, while the peak appears in themm/sub-mm band in the low state. selected spectral energy distributions arefitted with leptonic models including comptonization of external radiationproduced in a dusty torus or the broad-line region. adopting the interpretationof the polarization swing involving propagation of the emitting region along acurved trajectory, we can explain the evolution of the broad-band spectraduring the gamma-ray flaring event by a shift of its location from ~ 1 pc to ~4 pc from the central black hole. on the other hand, if the gamma-ray flare isgenerated instead at sub-pc distance from the central black hole, thefar-infrared break can be explained by synchrotron self-absorption. we alsomodel the low spectral state, dominated by the mm/sub-mm peaking synchrotroncomponent, and suggest that the corresponding inverse-compton componentexplains the steady x-ray emission.

1206.1346	gev observations of star-forming galaxies with \textit{fermi} lat	recent detections of the starburst galaxies m82 and ngc 253 by gamma-raytelescopes suggest that galaxies rapidly forming massive stars are moreluminous at gamma-ray energies compared to their quiescent relatives. buildingupon those results, we examine a sample of 69 dwarf, spiral, and luminous andultraluminous infrared galaxies at photon energies 0.1-100 gev using 3 years ofdata collected by the large area telescope (lat) on the \textit{fermi gamma-rayspace telescope} (\textit{fermi}). measured fluxes from significantly detectedsources and flux upper limits for the remaining galaxies are used to explorethe physics of cosmic rays in galaxies. we find further evidence forquasi-linear scaling relations between gamma-ray luminosity and both radiocontinuum luminosity and total infrared luminosity which apply both toquiescent galaxies of the local group and low-redshift starburst galaxies(conservative $p$-values $\lesssim0.05$ accounting for statistical andsystematic uncertainties). the normalizations of these scaling relationscorrespond to luminosity ratios of $\log(l_{0.1-100 \rm{gev}}/l_{1.4 \rm{ghz}})= 1.7 \pm 0.1_{\rm (statistical)} \pm 0.2_{\rm (dispersion)}$ and$\log(l_{0.1-100 \rm{gev}}/l_{8-1000 \mu\rm{m}}) = -4.3 \pm 0.1_{\rm(statistical)} \pm 0.2_{\rm (dispersion)}$ for a galaxy with a star formationrate of 1 $m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, assuming a chabrier initial mass function.using the relationship between infrared luminosity and gamma-ray luminosity,the collective intensity of unresolved star-forming galaxies at redshifts$0&lt;z&lt;2.5$ above 0.1 gev is estimated to be 0.4-2.4 $\times 10^{-6}$ phcm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ (4-23% of the intensity of the isotropic diffusecomponent measured with the lat). we anticipate that $\sim10$ galaxies could bedetected by their cosmic-ray induced gamma-ray emission during a 10-year\textit{fermi} mission.

1311.3637	magic upper limits on the grb 090102 afterglow	indications of a gev component in the emission from grbs are known since theegret observations during the 1990's and they have been confirmed by the dataof the fermi satellite. these results have, however, shown that ourunderstanding of grb physics is still unsatisfactory. the new generation ofcherenkov observatories and in particular the magic telescope, allow for thefirst time the possibility to extend the measurement of grbs from several tensup to hundreds of gev energy range. both leptonic and hadronic processes havebeen suggested to explain the possible gev/tev counterpart of grbs.observations with ground-based telescopes of very high energy photons (e&gt;30gev) from these sources are going to play a key role in discriminating amongthe different proposed emission mechanisms, which are barely distinguishable atlower energies. magic telescope observations of the grb 090102 (z=1.547) fieldand fermi large area telescope (lat) data in the same time interval areanalysed to derive upper limits of the gev/tev emission. we compare theseresults to the expected emissions evaluated for different processes in theframework of a relativistic blast wave model for the afterglow. simultaneousupper limits with fermi and a cherenkov telescope have been derived for thisgrb observation. the results we obtained are compatible with the expectedemission although the difficulties in predicting the he and vhe emission forthe afterglow of this event makes it difficult to draw firmer conclusions.nonetheless, magic sensitivity in the energy range of overlap with space-basedinstruments (above about 40 gev) is about one order of magnitude better withrespect to fermi. this makes evident the constraining power of ground-basedobservations and shows that the magic telescope has reached the requiredperformance to make possible grb multiwavelength studies in the very highenergy range.

1312.1535	optimized dark matter searches in deep observations of segue 1 with  magic	we present the results of stereoscopic observations of the satellite galaxysegue 1 with the magic telescopes, carried out between 2011 and 2013. withalmost 160 hours of good-quality data, this is the deepest observationalcampaign on any dwarf galaxy performed so far in the very high energy range ofthe electromagnetic spectrum. we search this large data sample for signals ofdark matter particles in the mass range between 100 gev and 20 tev. for this weuse the full likelihood analysis method, which provides optimal sensitivity tocharacteristic gamma-ray spectral features, like those expected from darkmatter annihilation or decay. in particular, we focus our search on gamma-raysproduced from different final state standard model particles, annihilation withinternal bremsstrahlung, monochromatic lines and box-shaped signals. ourresults represent the most stringent constraints to the annihilationcross-section or decay lifetime obtained from observations of satellitegalaxies, for masses above few hundred gev. in particular, our strongest limit(95% confidence level) corresponds to a ~500 gev dark matter particleannihilating into tau+tau-, and is of order &lt;sigma v&gt; ~ 1.2x10^{-24} cm^3s^{-1} - a factor ~40 above the &lt;sigma v&gt; thermal value.

1401.0464	magic long-term study of the distant tev blazar pks 1424+240 in a  multiwavelength context	we present a study of the very high energy (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) gamma-rayemission of the blazar pks 1424+240 observed with the magic telescopes. theprimary aim of this paper is the multiwavelength spectral characterization andmodeling of this blazar, which is made particularly interesting by the recentdiscovery of a lower limit of its redshift of z &gt; 0.6 and makes it a promisingcandidate to be the most distant vhe source. the source has been observed withthe magic telescopes in vhe gamma rays for a total observation time of ~33.6 hfrom 2009 to 2011. the source was marginally detected in vhe gamma rays during2009 and 2010, and later, the detection was confirmed during an opticaloutburst in 2011. the combined significance of the stacked sample is ~7.2sigma. the differential spectra measured during the different campaigns can bedescribed by steep power laws with the indices ranging from 3.5 +/- 1.2 to 5.0+/- 1.7. the magic spectra corrected for the absorption due to theextragalactic background light connect smoothly, within systematic errors, withthe mean spectrum in 2009-2011 observed at lower energies by the fermi-lat. theabsorption-corrected magic spectrum is flat with no apparent turn down up to400 gev. the multiwavelength light curve shows increasing flux in radio andoptical bands that could point to a common origin from the same region of thejet. the large separation between the two peaks of the constructednon-simultaneous spectral energy distribution also requires an extremely highdoppler factor if an one zone synchrotron self-compton model is applied. wefind that a two-component synchrotron self-compton model describes the spectralenergy distribution of the source well, if the source is located at z~0.6.

1401.5646	magic gamma-ray and multifrequency observations of flat spectrum radio  quasar pks 1510-089 in early 2012	among more than fifty blazars detected in very high energy (vhe, e&gt;100gev)gamma-rays, only three belong to the subclass of flat spectrum radio quasars(fsrqs). magic observed fsrq pks 1510-089 in february-april 2012 during a highactivity state in the high energy (he, e&gt;100 mev) gamma-ray band observed byagile and fermi. magic observations result in the detection of a source withsignificance of 6.0 sigma. in agreement with the previous vhe observations ofthe source, we find no statistically significant variability during the magicobservations in daily, weekly or monthly time scales. the other two known vhefsrqs have shown daily scale to sub-hour variability.  we study the multifrequency behaviour of the source at the epoch of magicobservation, collecting quasi-simultaneous data at radio and optical (gasp-webtand f-gamma collaborations, rem, steward, perkins, liverpool, ovro and vlbatelescopes), x-ray (swift satellite) and he gamma-ray frequencies. thegamma-ray sed combining agile, fermi and magic data joins smoothly and shows nohint of a break. the multifrequency light curves suggest a common origin forthe millimeter radio and he gamma-ray emission and the he gamma-ray flaringstarts when the new component is ejected from the 43ghz vlba core. thequasi-simultaneous multifrequency sed is modelled with a one-zone inversecompton model. we study two different origins of the seed photons for theinverse compton scattering, namely the infra-red torus and a slow sheathsurrounding the jet around the vlba core. both models fit the data well.however, the fast he gamma-ray variability requires that within the modelledlarge emitting region, there must exist more compact regions. we suggest thatthese observed signatures would be most naturally explained by a turbulentplasma flowing at a relativistic speed down the jet and crossing a standingconical shock.

1405.6074	discovery of tev gamma-ray emission from the pulsar wind nebula 3c 58 by  magic	the pulsar wind nebula (pwn) 3c 58 is one of the historical very-high-energy(vhe; e&gt;100 gev) gamma-ray source candidates. it is energized by one of thehighest spin-down power pulsars known (5% of crab pulsar) and it has beencompared to the crab nebula due to their morphological similarities. thisobject was previously observed by imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes(whipple, veritas and magic), although not detected, with an upper limit of2.4% crab unit (c.u.) at vhe. it was detected by fermi-lat with a spectrumextending beyond 100 gev. we analyzed 81 hours of 3c 58 data taken with themagic telescopes and we detected vhe gamma-ray emission with a significance of5.7 sigma and an integral flux of 0.65% c.u. above 1 tev. the differentialenergy spectrum between 400 gev and 10 tev is well described by a power-lawfunction d\phi/de=f_0(e/1tev)^{-gamma} withf_0=(2.0\pm0.4_{stat}\pm0.6_{sys})\times10^{-13}cm^{-2}s^{-1}tev^{-1} andgamma=2.4\pm0.2_{stat}\pm0.2_{sys}. the skymap is compatible with an unresolvedsource. we report the first significant detection of pwn 3c 58 at tev energies.according to our results 3c 58 is the least luminous vhe gamma-ray pwn everdetected at vhe and the one with the lowest flux at vhe to date. we compare ourresults with the expectations of time-dependent models in which electronsup-scatter photon fields. the best representation favors a distance to the pwnof 2 kpc and far infrared (fir) comparable to cmb photon fields. if we consideran unexpectedly high fir density, the data can also be reproduced by modelsassuming a 3.2 kpc distance. a low magnetic field, far from equipartition, isrequired to explain the vhe data. hadronic contribution from the hostingsupernova remnant (snr) requires unrealistic energy budget given the density ofthe medium, disfavoring cosmic ray acceleration in the snr as origin of the vhegamma-ray emission.

1406.6892	measurement of the crab nebula spectrum over three decades in energy  with the magic telescopes	the magic stereoscopic system collected 69 hours of crab nebula data betweenoctober 2009 and april 2011. analysis of this data sample using the latestimprovements in the magic stereoscopic software provided an unprecedentedprecision of spectral and night-by-night light curve determination at gammarays. we derived a differential spectrum with a single instrument from 50 gevup to almost 30 tev with 5 bins per energy decade. at low energies, magicresults, combined with fermi-lat data, show a flat and broad inverse comptonpeak. the overall fit to the data between 1 gev and 30 tev is not welldescribed by a log-parabola function. we find that a modified log-parabolafunction with an exponent of 2.5 instead of 2 provides a good description ofthe data ($\chi^2=35/26$). using systematic uncertainties of red the magic andfermi-lat measurements we determine the position of the inverse compton peak tobe at (53 $\pm$ 3stat + 31syst -13syst) gev, which is the most preciseestimation up to date and is dominated by the systematic effects. there is nohint of the integral flux variability on daily scales at energies above 300 gevwhen systematic uncertainties are included in the flux measurement. we considerthree state- of-the-art theoretical models to describe the overall spectralenergy distribution of the crab nebula. the constant b-field model cannotsatisfactorily reproduce the vhe spectral measurements presented in this work,having particular difficulty reproducing the broadness of the observed ic peak.most probably this implies that the assumption of the homogeneity of themagnetic field inside the nebula is incorrect. on the other hand, thetime-dependent 1d spectral model provides a good fit of the new vhe resultswhen considering a 80 {\mu}g magnetic field. however, it fails to match thedata when including the morphology of the nebula at lower wavelengths.

1410.7059	discovery of very high energy gamma-ray emission from the blazar 1es  0033+595 by the magic telescopes	the number of known very high energy (vhe) blazars is $\sim\,50$, which isvery small in comparison to the number of blazars detected in otherfrequencies. this situation is a handicap for population studies of blazars,which emit about half of their luminosity in the $\gamma$-ray domain. moreover,vhe blazars, if distant, allow for the study of the environment that thehigh-energy $\gamma$-rays traverse in their path towards the earth, like theextragalactic background light (ebl) and the intergalactic magnetic field(igmf), and hence they have a special interest for the astrophysics community.we present the first vhe detection of 1es\,0033+595 with a statisticalsignificance of 5.5\,$\sigma$. the vhe emission of this object is constantthroughout the magic observations (2009 august and october), and can beparameterized with a power law with an integral flux above 150 gev of$(7.1\pm1.3)\times 10^{-12} {\mathrm{ph\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}}$ and a photon indexof ($3.8\pm0.7$). we model its spectral energy distribution (sed) as the resultof inverse compton scattering of synchrotron photons. for the study of the sedwe used simultaneous optical r-band data from the kva telescope, archival x-raydata by \textit{swift} as well as \textit{integral}, and simultaneous highenergy (he, $300$\,mev~--~$10$\,gev) $\gamma$-ray data from the \textit{fermi}lat observatory. using the empirical approach of prandini et al.

1502.04699	rapid variability of blazar 3c 279 during flaring states in 2013-2014  with joint fermi-lat, nustar, swift, and ground-based multi-wavelength  observations	we report the results of a multi-band observing campaign on the famous blazar3c 279 conducted during a phase of increased activity from 2013 december to2014 april, including first observations of it with nustar. the $\gamma$-rayemission of the source measured by fermi-lat showed multiple distinct flaresreaching the highest flux level measured in this object since the beginning ofthe fermi mission, with $f(e &gt; 100\,{\rm mev})$ of $10^{-5}$ photons cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, and with a flux doubling time scale as short as 2 hours. the$\gamma$-ray spectrum during one of the flares was very hard, with an index of$\gamma_\gamma = 1.7 \pm 0.1$, which is rarely seen in flat spectrum radioquasars. the lack of concurrent optical variability implies a very high comptondominance parameter $l_\gamma/l_{\rm syn} &gt; 300$. two 1-day nustar observationswith accompanying swift pointings were separated by 2 weeks, probing differentlevels of source activity. while the 0.5$-$70 kev x-ray spectrum obtainedduring the first pointing, and fitted jointly with swift-xrt is well-describedby a simple power law, the second joint observation showed an unusual spectralstructure: the spectrum softens by $\delta\gamma_{\rm x} \simeq 0.4$ at $\sim$4kev. modeling the broad-band sed during this flare with the standardsynchrotron plus inverse compton model requires: (1) the location of the$\gamma$-ray emitting region is comparable with the broad line region radius,(2) a very hard electron energy distribution index $p \simeq 1$, (3) total jetpower significantly exceeding the accretion disk luminosity $l_{\rm j}/l_{\rmd} \gtrsim 10$, and (4) extremely low jet magnetization with $l_{\rm b}/l_{\rmj} \lesssim 10^{-4}$. we also find that single-zone models that match theobserved $\gamma$-ray and optical spectra cannot satisfactorily explain theproduction of x-ray emission.

1503.04848	nustar and multifrequency study of the two high-redshift blazars s5  0836+710 and pks 2149-306	the most powerful blazars are the flat spectrum radio quasars whose emissionis dominated by a compton component peaking between a few hundred kev and a fewhundred mev. we selected two bright blazars, pks 2149-306 at redshift z=2.345and s5 0836+710 at z=2.172, in order to observe them in the hard x-ray bandwith the nustar satellite. in this band the compton component is rapidly risingalmost up to the peak of the emission. simultaneous soft-x-rays and uv-opticalobservations were performed with the swift satellite, while near-infrared (nir)data were obtained with the rem telescope. to study their variability, werepeated these observations for both sources on a timescale of a few months.while no fast variability was detected during a single observation, bothsources were found to be variable in the x-ray band, up to 50%, between the twoobservations, with larger variability at higher energies. no variability wasdetected in the optical/nir band. these data together with fermi-lat, wise andother literature data are then used to study the overall spectral energydistributions (seds) of these blazars. although the jet non-thermal emissiondominates the sed, it leaves the uv band unhidden, allowing us to detect thethermal emission of the disc and to estimate the mass of the black hole. thenon-thermal emission is well reproduced by a one-zone leptonic model. thenon-thermal radiative processes are synchrotron, self-compton and externalcompton using seed photons from both the broad-line region (blr) and the torus.we find that our data are better reproduced if we assume that the location ofthe dissipation region of the jet, r_diss, is in-between the torus, (atr_torus), and the blr (r_torus&gt;r_diss&gt;r_blr). the observed variability isexplained by changing a minimum number of model parameters by a very smallamount.

1504.06115	magic detection of short-term variability of the high-peaked bl lac  object 1es 0806+524	the high-frequency-peaked bl lac (hbl) 1es 0806+524 (z = 0.138) wasdiscovered in vhe $\gamma$ rays in 2008. until now, the broad-band spectrum of1es 0806+524 has been only poorly characterized, in particular at highenergies. we analysed multiwavelength observations from $\gamma$ rays to radioperformed from 2011 january to march, which were triggered by the high activitydetected at optical frequencies. these observations constitute the most precisedetermination of the broad-band emission of 1es 0806+524 to date. thestereoscopic magic observations yielded a $\gamma$-ray signal above 250 gev of$(3.7 \pm 0.7)$ per cent of the crab nebula flux with a statisticalsignificance of 9.9 $\sigma$. the multiwavelength observations showedsignificant variability in essentially all energy bands, including a vhe$\gamma$-ray flare that lasted less than one night, which providedunprecedented evidence for short-term variability in 1es 0806+524. the spectrumof this flare is well described by a power law with a photon index of $2.97 \pm0.29$ between $\sim$150 gev and 1 tev and an integral flux of $(9.3 \pm 1.9)$per cent of the crab nebula flux above 250 gev. the spectrum during thenon-flaring vhe activity is compatible with the only available vhe observationperformed in 2008 with veritas when the source was in a low optical state. thebroad-band spectral energy distribution can be described with a one-zonesynchrotron self compton model with parameters typical for hbls, indicatingthat 1es 0806+524 is not substantially different from the hbls previouslydetected.

1508.06128	prospects for indirect dark matter searches with the cherenkov telescope  array (cta)	the cherenkov telescope array (cta) will have a unique chance of discoveryfor a large range of masses in weakly interacting massive particles models ofdark matter. the principal target for dark matter searches with cta is thecentre of the galactic halo. the best strategy is to perform cta observationswithin a few degrees of the galactic centre, with the galactic centre itselfand the most intense diffuse emission regions removed from the analysis.assuming a cuspy dark matter density profile for the milky way, 500 hours ofobservations in this region provide sensitivities to and below the thermalcross-section of dark matter annihilations, for masses between a few hundredgev and a few tens of tev; therefore cta will have a significant chance ofdiscovery in some models. since the dark matter density in the milky way is farfrom certain in the inner kpc region, other targets are also proposed forobservation, like ultra-faint dwarf galaxies such as segue 1 with 100 hours peryear proposed. beyond these two observational targets, further alternatives,such as galactic dark clumps, will be considered closer to the actual date ofcta operations. sensitivity predictions for dark matter searches are given onthe various targets taking into account the latest instrument responsefunctions expected for cta together with a discussion on the systematicuncertainties from the backgrounds.

1509.04936	first nustar observations of mrk 501 within a radio to tev  multi-instrument campaign	we report on simultaneous broadband observations of the tev-emitting blazarmarkarian 501 between 1 april and 10 august 2013, including the first detailedcharacterization of the synchrotron peak with swift and nustar. during thecampaign, the nearby bl lac object was observed in both a quiescent and anelevated state. the broadband campaign includes observations with nustar,magic, veritas, the fermi large area telescope (lat), swift x-ray telescope anduv optical telescope, various ground-based optical instruments, including thegasp-webt program, as well as radio observations by ovro, mets\"ahovi and thef-gamma consortium. some of the magic observations were affected by a sandlayer from the saharan desert, and had to be corrected using event-by-eventcorrections derived with a lidar (light detection and ranging) facility. thisis the first time that lidar information is used to produce a physics resultwith cherenkov telescope data taken during adverse atmospheric conditions, andhence sets a precedent for the current and future ground-based gamma-rayinstruments. the nustar instrument provides unprecedented sensitivity in hardx-rays, showing the source to display a spectral energy distribution between 3and 79 kev consistent with a log-parabolic spectrum and hard x-ray variabilityon hour timescales. none (of the four extended nustar observations) showsevidence of the onset of inverse-compton emission at hard x-ray energies. weapply a single-zone equilibrium synchrotron self-compton model to fivesimultaneous broadband spectral energy distributions. we find that thesynchrotron self-compton model can reproduce the observed broadband statesthrough a decrease in the magnetic field strength coinciding with an increasein the luminosity and hardness of the relativistic leptons responsible for thehigh-energy emission.

1511.06778	the 1st fermi lat supernova remnant catalog	to uniformly determine the properties of supernova remnants (snrs) at highenergies, we have developed the first systematic survey at energies from 1 to100 gev using data from the fermi large area telescope. based on the spatialoverlap of sources detected at gev energies with snrs known from radio surveys,we classify 30 sources as likely gev snrs. we also report 14 marginalassociations and 245 flux upper limits. a mock catalog in which the positionsof known remnants are scrambled in galactic longitude, allows us to determinean upper limit of 22% on the number of gev candidates falsely identified assnrs. we have also developed a method to estimate spectral and spatialsystematic errors arising from the diffuse interstellar emission model, a keycomponent of all galactic fermi lat analyses. by studying remnants uniformly inaggregate, we measure the gev properties common to these objects and provide acrucial context for the detailed modeling of individual snrs. combining our gevresults with multiwavelength (mw) data, including radio, x-ray, and tev,demonstrates the need for improvements to previously sufficient, simple modelsdescribing the gev and radio emission from these objects. we model the gev andmw emission from snrs in aggregate to constrain their maximal contribution toobserved galactic cosmic rays.

1512.02235	multiwavelength study of quiescent states of mrk 421 with unprecedented  hard x-ray coverage provided by nustar in 2013	we present coordinated multiwavelength observations of the bright, nearby bllac object mrk 421 taken in 2013 january-march, involving gasp-webt, swift,nustar, fermi-lat, magic, veritas, and other collaborations and instruments,providing data from radio to very-high-energy (vhe) gamma-ray bands. nustaryielded previously unattainable sensitivity in the 3-79 kev range, revealingthat the spectrum softens when the source is dimmer until the x-ray spectralshape saturates into a steep power law with a photon index of approximately 3,with no evidence for an exponential cutoff or additional hard components up toabout 80 kev. for the first time, we observed both the synchrotron and theinverse-compton peaks of the spectral energy distribution (sed) simultaneouslyshifted to frequencies below the typical quiescent state by an order ofmagnitude. the fractional variability as a function of photon energy shows adouble-bump structure which relates to the two bumps of the broadband sed. ineach bump, the variability increases with energy which, in the framework of thesynchrotron self-compton model, implies that the electrons with higher energiesare more variable. the measured multi-band variability, the significantx-ray-to-vhe correlation down to some of the lowest fluxes ever observed inboth bands, the lack of correlation between optical/uv and x-ray flux, the lowdegree of polarization and its significant (random) variations, the shortestimated electron cooling time, and the significantly longer variabilitytimescale observed in the nustar light curves point toward in-situ electronacceleration, and suggest that there are multiple compact regions contributingto the broadband emission of mrk 421 during low-activity states.
