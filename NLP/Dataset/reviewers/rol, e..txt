0706.1321	detailed study of the grb 030329 radio afterglow deep into the  non-relativistic phase	we explore the physics behind one of the brightest radio afterglows ever, grb030329, at late times when the jet is non-relativistic. we determine thephysical parameters of the blast wave and its surroundings, in particular theindex of the electron energy distribution, the energy of the blast wave, andthe density (structure) of the circumburst medium. we then compare our resultswith those from image size measurements. we observed the grb 030329 radioafterglow with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope and the giant metrewaveradio telescope at frequencies from 325 mhz to 8.4 ghz, spanning a time rangeof 268-1128 days after the burst. we modeled all the available radio data andderived the physical parameters. the index of the electron energy distributionis p=2.1, the circumburst medium is homogeneous, and the transition to thenon-relativistic phase happens at t_nr ~ 80 days. the energy of the blast waveand density of the surrounding medium are comparable to previous findings. ourfindings indicate that the blast wave is roughly spherical at t_nr, and theyagree with the implications from the vlbi studies of image size evolution. itis not clear from the presented dataset whether we have seen emission from thecounter jet or not. we predict that the low frequency array will be able toobserve the afterglow of grb 030329 and many other radio afterglows,constraining the physics of the blast wave during its non-relativistic phaseeven further.

0706.1345	spectroscopy and multiband photometry of the afterglow of intermediate  duration gamma-ray burst 040924 and its host galaxy	we present optical photometry and spectroscopy of the afterglow and hostgalaxy of gamma-ray burst 040924. this grb had a rather short duration of t90~2.4s, and a well sampled optical afterglow light curve. we aim to use thisdataset to find further evidence that this burst is consistent with a massivestar core-collapse progenitor. we combine the afterglow data reported here withdata taken from the literature and compare the host properties with surveydata. we find that the global behaviour of the optical afterglow is well fit bya broken power-law, with a break at ~0.03 days. we determine the redshift z =0.858 +/- 0.001 from the detected emission lines in our spectrum. using thespectrum and photometry we derive global properties of the host, showing it tohave similar properties to long grb hosts. we detect the [ne iii] emission linein the spectrum, and compare the fluxes of this line of a sample of 15 long grbhost galaxies with survey data, showing the long grb hosts to be comparable tolocal metal-poor emission line galaxies in their [ne iii] emission. we fit thesupernova bump accompanying this burst, and find that it is similar to otherlong grb supernova bumps, but fainter. all properties of grb 040924 areconsistent with an origin in the core-collapse of a massive star: thesupernova, the spectrum and sed of the host and the afterglow.

0903.1414	evidence for energy injection and a fine-tuned central engine at optical  wavelengths in grb 070419a	we present a comprehensive multiwavelength temporal and spectral analysis ofthe fred grb 070419a. the early-time emission in the $\gamma$-ray and x-raybands can be explained by a central engine active for at least 250 s, while atlate times the x-ray light curve displays a simple power-law decay. incontrast, the observed behaviour in the optical band is complex (from 10$^2$ upto 10$^6$ s). we investigate the light curve behaviour in the context of thestandard forward/reverse shock model; associating the peak in the optical lightcurve at $\sim$450 s with the fireball deceleration time results in a lorenzfactor $\gamma \approx 350$ at this time. in contrast, the shallow opticaldecay between 450 and 1500 s remains problematic, requiring a reverse shockcomponent whose typical frequency is above the optical band at the optical peaktime for it to be explained within the standard model. this predicts anincreasing flux density for the forward shock component until t $\sim$ 4$\times$ 10$^6$ s, inconsistent with the observed decay of the optical emissionfrom t $\sim$ 10$^4$ s. a highly magnetized fireball is also ruled out due tounrealistic microphysic parameters and predicted light curve behaviour that isnot observed. we conclude that a long-lived central engine with a finely tunedenergy injection rate and a sudden cessation of the injection is required tocreate the observed light curves - consistent with the same conditions that areinvoked to explain the plateau phase of canonical x-ray light curves of grbs.

0906.1577	a glimpse of the end of the dark ages: the gamma-ray burst of 23 april  2009 at redshift 8.3	it is thought that the first generations of massive stars in the universewere an important, and quite possibly dominant, source of the ultra-violetradiation that reionized the hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium (igm); astate in which it has remained to the present day. measurements of cosmicmicrowave background anisotropies suggest that this phase-change largely tookplace in the redshift range z=10.8 +/- 1.4, while observations of quasars andlyman-alpha galaxies have shown that the process was essentially completed byz=6. however, the detailed history of reionization, and characteristics of thestars and proto-galaxies that drove it, remain unknown. further progress inunderstanding requires direct observations of the sources of ultra-violetradiation in the era of reionization, and mapping the evolution of the neutralhydrogen fraction through time. the detection of galaxies at such redshifts ishighly challenging, due to their intrinsic faintness and high luminositydistance, whilst bright quasars appear to be rare beyond z~7. here we reportthe discovery of a gamma-ray burst, grb 090423, at redshift z=8.26 -0.08 +0.07.this is well beyond the redshift of the most distant spectroscopicallyconfirmed galaxy (z=6.96) and quasar (z=6.43). it establishes that massivestars were being produced, and dying as grbs, ~625 million years after the bigbang. in addition, the accurate position of the burst pinpoints the location ofthe most distant galaxy known to date. larger samples of grbs beyond z~7 willconstrain the evolving rate of star formation in the early universe, whilerapid spectroscopy of their afterglows will allow direct exploration of theprogress of reionization with cosmic time.

0907.2462	a new analysis of the short-duration, hard-spectrum grb 051103, a  possible extragalactic sgr giant flare	grb 051103 is considered to be a candidate soft gamma repeater (sgr)extragalactic giant magnetar flare by virtue of its proximity on the sky tom81/m82, as well as its time history, localization, and energy spectrum. wehave derived a refined interplanetary network localization for this burst whichreduces the size of the error box by over a factor of two. we examine its timehistory for evidence of a periodic component, which would be one signature ofan sgr giant flare, and conclude that this component is neither detected nordetectable under reasonable assumptions. we analyze the time-resolved energyspectra of this event with improved time- and energy resolution, and concludethat although the spectrum is very hard, its temporal evolution at late timescannot be determined, which further complicates the giant flare association. wealso present new optical observations reaching limiting magnitudes of r &gt; 24.5,about 4 magnitudes deeper than previously reported. in tandem withserendipitous observations of m81 taken immediately before and one month afterthe burst, these place strong constraints on any rapidly variable sources inthe region of the refined error ellipse proximate to m81. we do not find anyconvincing afterglow candidates from either background galaxies or sources inm81, although within the refined error region we do locate two uv bright starforming regions which may host sgrs. a supernova remnant (snr) within the errorellipse could provide further support for an sgr giant flare association, butwe were unable to identify any snr within the error ellipse. these data stilldo not allow strong constraints on the nature of the grb 051103 progenitor, andsuggest that candidate extragalactic sgr giant flares will be difficult,although not impossible, to confirm.

0907.3449	low-resolution spectroscopy of gamma-ray burst optical afterglows:  biases in the swift sample and characterization of the absorbers	(abridged). we present a sample of 77 optical afterglows (oas) of swiftdetected grbs for which spectroscopic follow-up observations have been secured.we provide linelists and equivalent widths for all detected lines redward ofly-alpha. we discuss to what extent the current sample of swift bursts with oaspectroscopy is a biased subsample of all swift detected grbs. for that purposewe define an x-ray selected sample of swift bursts with optimal conditions forground-based follow up from the period march 2005 to september 2008; 146 burstsfulfill our sample criteria. we derive the redshift distribution for thissample and conclude that less than 19% of swift bursts are at z&gt;7. we comparethe high energy properties for three sub-samples of bursts in the sample: i)bursts with redshifts measured from oa spectroscopy, ii) bursts with detectedoa, but no oa-based redshift, and iii) bursts with no detection of the oa. thebursts in group i) have significantly less excess x-ray absorption than burstsin the other two groups. in addition, the fraction of dark bursts is 14% ingroup i), 38% in group ii) and &gt; 39% in group iii). from this we conclude thatthe sample of grbs with oa spectroscopy is not representative for all swiftbursts, most likely due to a bias against the most dusty sight-lines. finally,we characterize grb absorption systems as a class and compare them to qsoabsorption systems, in particular dlas. on average grb absorbers arecharacterized by significantly stronger ews for hi as well as for both low andhigh ionization metal lines than what is seen in intervening qso absorbers.based on the z&gt;2 bursts in the sample we place a 95% confidence upper limit of7.5% on the mean escape fraction of ionizing photons from star-forminggalaxies.

0907.4578	multi-wavelength observations of the energetic grb 080810: detailed  mapping of the broadband spectral evolution	grb 080810 was one of the first bursts to trigger both swift and the fermigamma-ray space telescope. it was subsequently monitored over the x-ray anduv/optical bands by swift, in the optical by rotse and a host of othertelescopes and was detected in the radio by the vla. the redshift of z= 3.355+/- 0.005 was determined by keck/hires and confirmed by rtt150 and not. theprompt gamma/x-ray emission, detected over 0.3-10^3 kev, systematically softensover time, with e_peak moving from ~600 kev at the start to ~40 kev around 100s after the trigger; alternatively, this spectral evolution could be identifiedwith the blackbody temperature of a quasithermal model shifting from ~60 kev to~3 kev over the same time interval. the first optical detection was made at 38s, but the smooth, featureless profile of the full optical coverage impliesthat this originated from the afterglow component, not the pulsed/flaringprompt emission.  broadband optical and x-ray coverage of the afterglow at the start of thefinal x-ray decay (~8 ks) reveals a spectral break between the optical andx-ray bands in the range 10^15 - 2x10^16 hz. the decay profiles of the x-rayand optical bands show that this break initially migrates blueward to thisfrequency and then subsequently drifts redward to below the optical band by~3x10^5 s. grb 080810 was very energetic, with an isotropic energy output forthe prompt component of 3x10^53 erg and 1.6x10^52 erg for the afterglow; thereis no evidence for a jet break in the afterglow up to six days following theburst.

1004.1131	grb 021004: tomography of a gamma-ray burst progenitor and its host  galaxy	we analyse the distribution of matter around the progenitor star of gamma-rayburst grb 021004 as well as the properties of its host galaxy withhigh-resolution echelle as well as near-infrared spectroscopy. observationswere taken by the 8.2m very large telescope with the ultraviolet and visualechelle spectrograph (uves) and the infrared spectrometer and array camera(isaac) between 10 and 14 hours after the onset of the event. we report thefirst detection of emission lines from a grb host galaxy in the near-infrared,detecting h-alpha and the [o iii] doublet. these allow an independentmeasurement of the systemic redshift (z = 2.3304 +/- 0.0005) which is notcontaminated by absorption as the ly-alpha line is, and the deduction ofproperties of the host galaxy. from the visual echelle spectroscopy, we findseveral absorption line groups spanning a range of about 3,000 km/s in velocityrelative to the redshift of the host galaxy. the absorption profiles are verycomplex with both velocity-broadened components extending over several 100 km/sand narrow lines with velocity widths of only 20 km/s. by analogy with qsoabsorption line studies, the relative velocities,widths, and degrees ofionization of the lines ("line-locking", "ionization--velocity correlation")show that the progenitor had both an extremely strong radiation field andseveral distinct mass loss phases (winds). these results are consistent withgrb progenitors being massive stars, such as luminous blue variables (lbvs) orwolf--rayet stars, providing a detailed picture of the spatial and velocitystructure of the grb progenitor star at the time of explosion. the host galaxyis a prolific star-forming galaxy with a sfr of about 40 solar masses per year.

1012.1466	a tale of two grb-sne at a common redshift of z = 0.54	we present ground-based and hst optical observations of the opticaltransients (ots) of long-duration gamma ray bursts (grbs) 060729 and 090618,both at a redshift of z = 0.54. for grb 060729, bumps are seen in the opticallight curves (lcs), and the late-time broadband spectral energy distributions(seds) of the ot resemble those of local type ic supernovae (sne). for grb090618, the dense sampling of our optical observations has allowed us to detectwell-defined bumps in the optical lcs, as well as a change in colour, that areindicative of light coming from a core-collapse sn. the accompanying sne forboth events are individually compared with sn1998bw, a known grb-supernova, andsn1994i, a typical type ic supernova without a known grb counterpart, and inboth cases the brightness and temporal evolution more closely resemblesn1998bw. we also exploit our extensive optical and radio data for grb 090618,as well as the publicly-available swift -xrt data, and discuss the propertiesof the afterglow at early times. in the context of a simple jet-like model, theafterglow of grb 090618 is best explained by the presence of a jet-break att-to &gt; 0.5 days. we then compare the rest-frame, peak v -band absolutemagnitudes of all of the grb and x-ray flash (xrf)-associated sne with a largesample of local type ibc sne, concluding that, when host extinction isconsidered, the peak magnitudes of the grb/xrf-sne cannot be distinguished fromthe peak magnitudes of non-grb/xrf sne.

0704.2525	a case of mistaken identity? grb 060912a and the nature of the long --  short grb divide	we investigate the origin of the grb 060912a, which has observationalproperties that make its classification as either a long or short burstambiguous. short duration grbs (sgrbs) are thought to have typically lowerenergies than long duration bursts, can be found in galaxies with populationsof all ages and are likely to originate from different progenitors to the longduration bursts. however, it has become clear that duration alone isinsufficient to make a distinction between the two populations in many cases,leading to a desire to find additional discriminators of burst type. grb060912a had a duration of 6 s and occurred only ~10 arcsec from a bright, lowredshift ($z=0.0936$) elliptical galaxy, suggesting that this may have been thehost, which would favour it being a short-burst. however, our deep opticalimaging and spectroscopy of the location of grb 060912a using the vlt showsthat grb 060912a more likely originates in a distant star forming galaxy atz=0.937, and is most likely a long burst. this demonstrates the risk inidentifying bright, nearby galaxies as the hosts of given grbs without furthersupporting evidence. further, it implies that, in the absence of secureidentifications, "host" type, or more broadly discriminators which rely ongalaxy redshifts, may not be good indicators of the true nature of any givengrb.

1107.3748	grb 070125 and the environments of spectral-line poor afterglow  absorbers	grb 070125 is among the most energetic bursts detected and the mostextensively observed so far. nevertheless, unresolved issues are still open inthe literature on the physics of the afterglow and on the grb environment. inparticular, grb 070125 was claimed to have exploded in a galactic haloenvironment, based on the uniqueness of the optical spectrum and thenon-detection of an underlying host galaxy. in this work we collect allpublicly available data and address these issues by modelling the nir-to-x-rayspectral energy distribution (sed) and studying the high signal-to-noisevlt/fors afterglow spectrum in comparison with a larger sample of grbabsorbers. the sed reveals a synchrotron cooling break in the uv, lowequivalent hydrogen column density and little reddening caused by a lmc- orsmc-type extinction curve. from the weak mgii absorption at z=1.5477 in thespectrum, we derived logn(mgii)=12.96+0.13-0.18 and upper limits on the ioniccolumn density of several metals. these suggest that the grb absorber is mostlikely an lls with a 0.03z\odot&lt;z&lt;1.3z\odot metallicity. the comparison withother grb absorbers places grb070125 at the low end of the absorption lineequivalent width distribution, confirming that weak spectral features andspectral-line poor absorbers are not so uncommon in afterglow spectra.moreover, we show that the effect of photo-ionization on the gas surroundingthe grb, combined with a low n(hi) along a short segment of the line of sightwithin the host galaxy, can explain the lack of spectral features in grb070125.finally, the non-detection of an underlying galaxy is consistent with a faintgrb host galaxy, well within the grb host brightness distribution. thus, thepossibility that grb070125 is simply located in the outskirts of a gas-rich,massive star-forming region inside its small and faint host galaxy seems morelikely than a gas-poor, halo environment origin.

1201.1292	the origin of the early time optical emission of swift grb 080310	we present broadband multi-wavelength observations of grb 080310 at redshiftz = 2.43. this burst was bright and long-lived, and unusual in having extensiveoptical and near ir follow-up during the prompt phase. using these data weattempt to simultaneously model the gamma-ray, x-ray, optical and ir emissionusing a series of prompt pulses and an afterglow component. initial attempts toextrapolate the high energy model directly to lower energies for each pulsereveal that a spectral break is required between the optical regime and 0.3 kevto avoid over predicting the optical flux. we demonstrate that afterglowemission alone is insufficient to describe all morphology seen in the opticaland ir data. allowing the prompt component to dominate the early-time opticaland ir and permitting each pulse to have an independent low energy spectralindices we produce an alternative scenario which better describes the opticallight curve. this, however, does not describe the spectral shape of grb 080310at early times. the fit statistics for the prompt and afterglow dominatedmodels are nearly identical making it difficult to favour either. however oneenduring result is that both models require a low energy spectral indexconsistent with self absorption for at least some of the pulses identified inthe high energy emission model.

0804.1727	multiwavelength analysis of the intriguing grb 061126: the reverse shock  scenario and magnetization	we present a detailed study of the prompt and afterglow emission from swiftgrb 061126 using bat, xrt, uvot data and multi-color optical imaging from tenground-based telescopes. grb 061126 was a long burst (t_90=191 s) with fouroverlapping peaks in its gamma-ray light curve. the x-ray afterglow, observedfrom 26 min to 20 days after the burst, shows a simple power-law decay withalpha_x=1.290 \pm 0.008. optical observations presented here cover the timerange from 258 s (faulkes telescope north) to 15 days (gemini north) after theburst; the decay rate of the optical afterglow shows a steep-to-shallowtransition (from alpha_1=1.48 \pm 0.06 to alpha_2=0.88 \pm 0.03) approximately13 min after the burst. we suggest the early, steep component is due to areverse shock and show that the magnetic energy density in the ejecta,expressed as a fraction of the equipartion value, is a few ten times largerthan in the forward shock in the early afterglow phase. the ejecta might beendowed with primordial magnetic fields at the central engine. the opticallight curve implies a late-time break at about 1.5 days after the burst, whilethere is no evidence of the simultaneous break in the x-ray light curve. wemodel the broad band emission and show that some afterglow characteristics (thesteeper decay in x-ray and the shallow spectral index from optical to x-ray)are difficult to explain in the framework of the standard fireball model. thismight imply that the x-ray afterglow is due to an additional emission process,such as late time central engine activity rather than blast-wave shockemission. the possible chromatic break at 1.5 days after the burst would givesupport to the additional emission scenario.

1501.03312	pulsar polarisation below 200 mhz: average profiles and propagation  effects	we present the highest-quality polarisation profiles to date of 16non-recycled pulsars and four millisecond pulsars, observed below 200 mhz withthe lofar high-band antennas. based on the observed profiles, we perform aninitial investigation of expected observational effects resulting from thepropagation of polarised emission in the pulsar magnetosphere and theinterstellar medium.  the predictions of magnetospheric birefringence in pulsars have been testedusing spectra of the pulse width and fractional polarisation frommultifrequency data. the derived spectra offer only partial support for theexpected effects of birefringence on the polarisation properties, with onlyabout half of our sample being consistent with the model's predictions. it isnoted that for some pulsars these measurements are contaminated by the effectsof interstellar scattering. for a number of pulsars in our sample, we haveobserved significant variations in the amount of faraday rotation as a functionof pulse phase, which is possibly an artefact of scattering. these variationsare typically two orders of magnitude smaller than that observed at 1400 mhz bynoutsos et al. (2009), for a different sample of southern pulsars. in thispaper we present a possible explanation for the difference in magnitude of thiseffect between the two frequencies, based on scattering. finally, we haveestimated the magnetospheric emission heights of low-frequency radiation fromfour pulsars, based on the phase lags between the flux-density and the paprofiles, and the theoretical framework of blaskiewicz, cordes &amp; wasserman(1991). these estimates yielded heights of a few hundred km; at least for psrb1133+16, this is consistent with emission heights derived based onradius-to-frequency mapping, but is up to a few times larger than the recentupper limit based on pulsar timing.

1512.00014	lofar msss: detection of a low-frequency radio transient in 400 hrs of  monitoring of the north celestial pole	we present the results of a four-month campaign searching for low-frequencyradio transients near the north celestial pole with the low-frequency array(lofar), as part of the multifrequency snapshot sky survey (msss). the datawere recorded between 2011 december and 2012 april and comprised 2149 11-minutesnapshots, each covering 175 deg^2. we have found one convincing candidateastrophysical transient, with a duration of a few minutes and a flux density at60 mhz of 15-25 jy. the transient does not repeat and has no obvious optical orhigh-energy counterpart, as a result of which its nature is unclear. thedetection of this event implies a transient rate at 60 mhz of 3.9 (+14.7, -3.7)x 10^-4 day^-1 deg^-2, and a transient surface density of 1.5 x 10^-5 deg^-2,at a 7.9-jy limiting flux density and ~10-minute time-scale. the campaign datawere also searched for transients at a range of other time-scales, from 0.5 to297 min, which allowed us to place a range of limits on transient rates at 60mhz as a function of observation duration.

astro-ph;0005609	the afterglow of the short/intermediate-duration gamma-ray burst grb  000301c: a jet at z=2.04	we present ulysses and near data from the detection of the short orintermediate duration (2 s) gamma-ray burst grb000301c (2000 march 1.41 ut).the gamma-ray burst (grb) was localised by the inter planetary network (ipn)and rxte to an area of 50 arcmin^2. a fading optical counterpart wassubsequently discovered with the nordic optical telescope (not) about 42h afterthe burst. the grb lies at the border between the long-soft and the short-hardclasses of grbs. if grb000301c belongs to the latter class, this would be thefirst detection of an afterglow to a short-hard burst. we present ubri and jhkphotometry from the time of the discovery until 11 days after the burst.finally, we present spectroscopic observations of the optical afterglowobtained with the eso vlt antu telescope 4 and 5 days after the burst. theoptical light curve is consistent with being achromatic from 2 to 11 days afterthe burst and exhibits a break. a broken power-law fit yields a shallowpre-break decay power-law slope of a_1=-0.72+-0.06, a break time oft_b=4.39+-0.26 days after the burst, and a post-break slope of a_2=-2.29+-0.17,which is best explained by a sideways expanding jet in an ambient medium ofconstant mean density. in the optical spectrum we find absorption features thatare consistent with feii, civ, cii, siii and ly-a at a redshift of2.0404+-0.0008. we find evidence for a curved shape of the spectral energydistribution of the observed afterglow. it is best fitted with a power-lawspectral distribution with index b ~ -0.7 reddened by an smc-like extinctionlaw with a_v~0.1 mag. based on the ly-a absorption line we estimate the hicolumn density to be log(n(hi))=21.2+-0.5. this is the first direct indicationof a connection between grb host galaxies and damped ly-a absorbers.

astro-ph;0009025	vlt spectroscopy of grb 990510 and grb 990712; probing the faint and  bright end of the grb host galaxy population	we present time-resolved optical spectroscopy of the afterglows of thegamma-ray bursts grb 990510 and grb 990712. through the identification ofseveral absorption lines in the first epoch grb 990510 spectrum, we determinethe redshift for this burst at z &gt;= 1.619. no clear emission lines aredetected. the strength of the mgi feature is indicative of a dense environment,most likely the host galaxy of grb 990510. although the host is extremely faint(v &gt;~ 28), the grb afterglow allows us to probe its interstellar medium and -in principle - to measure its metallicity. the optical spectrum of grb 990712(whose host galaxy is the brightest of the known grb hosts at cosmologicalredshifts), shows clear features both in emission and absorption, at a redshiftof z = 0.4331 +/- 0.0004. on the basis of several line emission diagnosticdiagrams, we conclude that the host galaxy of grb 990712 is most likely an hiigalaxy. we derive a unreddened [oii] star formation rate of 2.7 +/- 0.8msun/yr. correcting for the measured extinction intrinsic to the host galaxy(a(v) = \gpm{3.4}{2.4}{1.7}), this value increases to \gpm{35}{178}{25}msun/yr. the [oii] equivalent width, compared to that of field galaxies at z &lt;=1, also suggests that the host of grb 990712 is vigorously forming stars. weemploy the oxygen and hbeta emission-line intensities to estimate the globaloxygen abundance for the host of grb 990712: log(o/h) = -3.7 +- 0.4, which isslightly below the lowest metallicity one finds in nearby spiral galaxies. forboth grbs we study the time evolution of the absorption lines, whose equivalentwidth might be expected to change with time if the burst resides in a densecompact medium. we find no evidence for a significant change in the mgii width.

astro-ph;0102177	the extraordinarily bright optical afterglow of grb 991208 and its host  galaxy	observations of the extraordinarily bright optical afterglow (oa) of grb991208 started 2.1 d after the event. the flux decay constant of the oa in ther-band is -2.30 +/- 0.07 up to 5 d, which is very likely due to the jet effect,and after that it is followed by a much steeper decay with constant -3.2 +/-0.2, the fastest one ever seen in a grb oa. a negative detection in severalall-sky films taken simultaneously to the event implies either a previousadditional break prior to 2 d after the occurrence of the grb (as expected fromthe jet effect). the existence of a second break might indicate a steepening inthe electron spectrum or the superposition of two events. once the afterglowemission vanished, contribution of a bright underlying sn is found, but thelight curve is not sufficiently well sampled to rule out a dust echoexplanation. our determination of z = 0.706 indicates that grb 991208 is at 3.7gpc, implying an isotropic energy release of 1.15 x 10e53 erg which may berelaxed by beaming by a factor &gt; 100. precise astrometry indicates that the grbcoincides within 0.2" with the host galaxy, thus given support to a massivestar origin. the absolute magnitude is m_b = -18.2, well below the knee of thegalaxy luminosity function and we derive a star-forming rate of 11.5 +/- 7.1mo/yr. the quasi-simultaneous broad-band photometric spectral energydistribution of the afterglow is determined 3.5 day after the burst (dec 12.0)implying a cooling frequency below the optical band, i.e. supporting a jetmodel with p = -2.30 as the index of the power-law electron distribution.

astro-ph;0212334	a multi-colour study of the dark grb 000210 host galaxy and its  environment	we present ubvrizjshks broad band photometry of the host galaxy of the darkgamma-ray burst (grb) of february 10, 2000. these observations represent themost exhaustive photometry given to date of any grb host galaxy. a grid ofspectral templates have been fitted to the spectral energy distribution (sed)of the host. the derived photometric redshift is z=0.842^+0.054_-0.042, whichis in excellent agreement with the spectroscopic redshift (z=0.8463+/-0.0002)proposed by piro et al. (2002) based on a single emission line. furthermore, wehave determined the photometric redshift of all the galaxies in an area of6'x6' around the host galaxy, in order to check for their overdensity in theenvironment of the host. we find that the grb 000210 host galaxy is asubluminous galaxy (l ~ 0.5+/-0.2 l*), with no companions above our detectionthreshold of 0.18+/-0.06 l*. based on the restframe ultraviolet flux a starformation rate of 2.1+/-0.2 solar masses per year is estimated. the best fit tothe sed is obtained for a starburst template with an age of 0.181^+0.037_-0.026gyr and a very low extinction (av~0). we discuss the implications of theinferred low value of av and the age of the dominant stellar population for thenon detection of the grb 000210 optical afterglow.

astro-ph;0305227	variable polarization in the optical afterglow of grb 021004	we present polarimetric observations of the afterglow of gamma-ray burst(grb) 021004, obtained with the nordic optical telescope (not) and the verylarge telescope (vlt) between 8 and 17 hours after the burst. comparison amongthe observations shows a 45 degree change in the position angle from 9 hoursafter the burst to 16 hours after the burst, and comparison with published datafrom later epochs even shows a 90 degree change between 9 and 89 hours afterthe burst. the degree of linear polarization shows a marginal change, but isalso consistent with being constant in time. in the context of currentlyavailable models for changes in the polarization of grbs, a homogeneous jetwith an early break time of t_b ~ 1 day provides a good explanation of ourdata. the break time is a factor 2 to 6 earlier than has been found from theanalysis of the optical light curve. the change in the position angle of thepolarization rules out a structured jet model for the grb.

astro-ph;0307153	the blue host galaxy of the red grb 000418	we report on multi-band (ubvrizjsks) observations of the host galaxy of theapril 18, 2000 gamma-ray burst. the spectral energy distribution (sed) isanalysed by fitting empirical and synthetic spectral templates. we find that:(i) the best sed fit is obtained with a starburst template, (ii) thephotometric redshift is consistent with the spectroscopic redshift, (iii) thecolours of the host are inconsistent with an old stellar population, and (iv)the global extinction is constrained to be in the range av=0.12-0.61 mag. thederived global extinction agrees with the one reported for the afterglow(av=0.4-0.9 mag), suggesting a homogeneous distribution of the interstellarmedium (ism) in the host galaxy. these findings are supplemented bymorphological information from hubble space telescope (hst) imaging: thesurface brightness profile is smooth, symmetric and compact with no underlyingstructures (like dust lanes, spiral arms or disks). a natural scenario whichaccounts of all the above results is a nuclear starburst that harbours a youngpopulation of stars from which the grb originated.

astro-ph;0406233	the submm properties of grb host galaxies	long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) accompany the deaths of some massivestars and hence, since massive stars are short lived, are a tracer of starformation activity. given that grbs are bright enough to be seen to very highredshifts, and detected even in dusty environments, they should thereforeprovide a powerful probe of the global star formation history of the universe.the potential of this approach can be investigated via submm photometry of grbhost galaxies. submm luminosity also correlates with star formation rate, sothe distribution of host galaxy submm fluxes should allow us to test the twomethods for consistency. here, we report new jcmt/scuba 850 micron measurementsfor 15 grb hosts. combining these data with results from previous studies weconstruct a sample of 21 hosts with &lt;1.4 mjy errors. we show that thedistribution of apparent 850 micron flux densities of this sample is reasonablyconsistent with model predictions, but there is tentative evidence of a dearthof submm bright (&gt;4 mjy) galaxies. furthermore, the optical/infrared propertiesof the submm brightest grb hosts are not typical of the galaxy populationselected in submm surveys, although the sample size is still small. possibleselection effects and physical mechanisms which may explain these discrepanciesare discussed.

astro-ph;0501375	how special are dark gamma-ray bursts: a diagnostic tool	we present here a comprehensive study of the optical/near-infrared (ir) upperlimits for gamma-ray bursts that have an x-ray afterglow. we have extrapolatedthe x-ray afterglows to optical wavelengths based on the physics of thefireball blast wave model (e.g. rees &amp; meszaors 1992; meszaros &amp; rees 1997),and compared these results with optical upper limits for a large sample ofbursts. we find a small set of only three bursts out of a sample of 20 forwhich the upper limits are not compatible with their x-ray afterglow propertieswithin the context of any blast wave model. this sparse sample does not allowus to conclusively determine the cause of this optical/near-ir deficit.extinction in the host galaxy is a likely cause, but high redshifts anddifferent afterglow mechanisms might also explain the deficit in some cases. wenote that the three bursts appear to have higher than average gamma-ray peakfluxes. in a magnitude versus time diagram the bursts are separated from themajority of bursts with a detected optical/near-ir afterglow. however, two grbswith an optical afterglow (one of which is highly reddened) also fall in thisregion with dark bursts, making it likely that dark bursts are at the faint endof the set of optically detected bursts, and therefore the dark bursts likelyform a continuum with the bursts with a detected optical afterglow. our workprovides a useful diagnostic tool for follow-up observations for potentiallydark bursts; applied to the events detected with the swift satellite, it willsignificantly increase our sample of truly dark bursts and shed light upontheir nature.

astro-ph;0503573	scuba sub-millimeter observations of gamma-ray bursters iii. grb 030329:  the brightest sub-millimeter afterglow to date	we discuss our ongoing program of target of opportunity (too) sub-millimeterobservations of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) using the sub-millimetre common-userbolometer array (scuba) on the james clerk maxwell telescope (jcmt). in thispaper, we present all the too observations of grb 030329. this was by far thebrightest sub-millimeter afterglow seen to date. the flux density at 850microns was approximately constant up to a break that took place ~7 days afterthe burst. this was consistent with being a jet break. the 850 micron resultsagree with those at longer wavelengths that show a brighter flux ~7 days afterthe burst, right at the time of the break. no short-lived large-scalebrightenings were detected in the sub-millimeter light curve. however, the 850micron light curve may have had a drop &lt;~ 16 days after the burst. the peak ofthe afterglow emission was at ~90 ghz in the days before the break in the lightcurve. a simple modeling is consistent with the spectral indices remaining thesame as the afterglow evolved, with the breaks in the spectrum moving to longerwavelengths at later times and the flux at the peak falling. no significantsub-millimeter emission was detected from the host galaxy.

astro-ph;0508385	broadband modeling of gamma-ray burst afterglows	according to the fireball model gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglows are theresult of a shock pushed into the surrounding medium by an extremelyrelativistic outflow from the grb. by modeling the broadband spectrum, rangingfrom x-ray to radio wavelengths, on time scales of hours to years after thegrb, we can determine several burst parameters, e.g. the burst energy, thecircumburst medium density (and its gradient) and the energy contained inelectrons and the magnetic field. we have developed a code to do broadbandmodeling and determine the model parameters. we also performed monte carlosimulations with synthetic data sets in order to derive an estimate of theaccuracy of the best fit parameters. grb970508 was taken as a case study and wepresent our fitting results. we also present our wsrt radio observations ofgrb030329 at centimeter wavelengths and the results from modeling thisafterglow. the low frequency wsrt radio observations provide a uniquepossibility to study the late stages of the fireball evolution and examine thejet structure.

astro-ph;0508397	the radio afterglow of grb 030329 at centimeter wavelengths: evidence  for a structured jet or non-relativistic expansion	we present our centimeter wavelength (1.4, 2.3 and 4.8 ghz) light curves ofthe afterglow of grb 030329, which were obtained with the westerbork synthesisradio telescope. modeling the data according to a collimated afterglow resultsin a jet-break time of 10 days. this is in accordance with earlier resultsobtained at higher radio frequencies. however, with respect to the afterglowmodel, some additional flux at the lower frequencies is present when theselight curves reach their maximum after 40-80 days. we show that this additionalflux can be modeled with two or more components with progressively later jetbreaks. from these results we infer that the jet is in fact a structured or alayered jet, where the ejecta with lower lorentz factors produce additionalflux that becomes visible at late times in the lowest frequency bands. we showthat a transition to non-relativistic expansion of the fireball at late timescan also account for the observed flux excess, except for the lowest frequency(1.4 ghz) data.

astro-ph;0509273	very early optical afterglows of gamma-ray bursts: evidence for relative  paucity of detection	very early observations with the swift satellite of gamma-ray burst (grb)afterglows reveal that the optical component is not detected in a large numberof cases. this is in contrast to the bright optical flashes previouslydiscovered in some grbs (e.g. grb 990123 and grb 021211). comparisons of thex-ray afterglow flux to the optical afterglow flux and prompt gamma-ray fluenceis used to quantify the seemingly deficient optical, and in some cases x-ray,light at these early epochs. this comparison reveals that some of these burstsappear to have higher than normal gamma-ray efficiencies. we discuss possiblemechanisms and their feasibility for explaining the apparent lack of earlyoptical emission. the mechanisms considered include: foreground extinction,circumburst absorption, ly-alpha blanketing and absorption due to highredshift, low density environments, rapid temporal decay, and intrinsicweakness of the reverse shock. of these, foreground extinction, circumburstabsorption, and high redshift provide the best explanations for most of thenon-detections in our sample. there is tentative evidence of suppression of thestrong reverse shock emission. this could be because of apoynting-flux-dominated flow or a pure non-relativistic hydrodynamical reverseshock.

astro-ph;0510404	low-resolution vlt spectroscopy of grbs 991216, 011211 and 021211	we present low-resolution vlt spectroscopy of the afterglow of the gamma-raybursts (grbs) 991216, 011211 and 021211. our spectrum of grb991216 is the onlyoptical spectrum for this afterglow. it shows two probable absorption systemsat z=0.80 and z=1.02, where the highest redshift most likely reflects thedistance to the host galaxy. a third system may be detected at z=0.77. hstimaging of the field, obtained 4 months after the burst, has resulted in thedetection of two amorphous regions of emission, one at the projected afterglowposition, and the other 0.6" away. the spectrum shows a depression in flux inbetween 4000 a and 5500 a. this could be the result of a 2175 a-type extinctionfeature in the host of grb991216, but at a rather red wavelength of 2360 a. ifthis interpretation is correct, it is the first time the extinction feature isseen in a grb afterglow spectrum. it is centered at a wavelength similar tothat of the ultra-violet (uv) bumps inferred from observations of a fewuv-strong, hydrogen-poor stars in the galaxy. all significant absorption lines(except for one) detected in the spectrum of grb011211 are identified withlines originating in a single absorption system at z=2.142+/-0.002, theredshift of the grb011211 host galaxy. we also detect the lyman alphaabsorption line in the host, to which we fit a neutral hydrogen column densityof log n(hi)=20.4+/-0.2, which indicates that it is a damped lyman alphasystem. using a curve-of-growth analysis, we estimate the si, fe and almetallicity at the grb011211 redshift. for grb021211, we detect a singleemission line in a spectrum obtained tens of days after the burst, which weidentify as [oii] 3727 at z=1.006. the corresponding unobscured [oii]star-formation rate is 1.4 msun/yr.

astro-ph;0601125	the early x-ray emission from grbs	we present observations of the early x-ray emission for a sample of 40gamma-ray bursts (grbs) obtained using the swift satellite for which thenarrow-field instruments were pointed at the burst within 10 minutes of thetrigger. using data from the burst alert and x-ray telescopes, we show that thex-ray light curve can be well described by an exponential that relaxes into apower law, often with flares superimposed. the transition time between theexponential and the power law provides a physically defined timescale for theburst duration. in most bursts the power law breaks to a shallower decay withinthe first hour, and a late emission "hump" is observed which can last for manyhours. in other grbs the hump is weak or absent. the observed variety in theshape of the early x-ray light curve can be explained as a combination of threecomponents: prompt emission from the central engine; afterglow; and the latehump. in this scenario, afterglow emission begins during or soon after theburst and the observed shape of the x-ray light curve depends on the relativestrengths of the emission due to the central engine and that of the afterglow.there is a strong correlation such that those grbs with stronger afterglowcomponents have brighter early optical emission. the late emission hump canhave a total fluence equivalent to that of the prompt phase. grbs with thestrongest late humps have weak or no x-ray flares.

astro-ph;0602497	panchromatic study of grb 060124: from precursor to afterglow	we present observations of grb 060124, the first event for which both theprompt and the afterglow emission could be observed simultaneously and in theirentirety by the three swift instruments. indeed, swift-bat triggered on aprecursor ~570s before the main burst peak, and this allowed swift to repointthe narrow field instruments to the burst position ~350s before the main burstoccurred. grb 060124 also triggered konus-wind, which observed the promptemission in a harder gamma-ray band (up to 2mev). thanks to these exceptionalcircumstances, the temporal and spectral properties of the prompt emission canbe studied in the optical, x-ray and gamma-ray ranges. while the x-ray emission(0.2-10kev) clearly tracks the gamma-ray burst, the optical component follows adifferent pattern, likely indicating a different origin, possibly the onset ofexternal shocks. the prompt grb spectrum shows significant spectral evolution,with both the peak energy and the spectral index varying. as observed inseveral long grbs, significant lags are measured between the hard- andlow-energy components, showing that this behaviour extends over 3 decades inenergy. the grb peaks are also much broader at soft energies. this is relatedto the temporal evolution of the spectrum, and can be accounted for by assumingthat the electron spectral index softened with time. the burst energy(e_iso~5x10^{53} erg) and average peak energy (e_p~300kev) make grb 060124consistent with the amati relation. the x-ray afterglow is characterized by adecay which presents a break at t_b~10^5s.

astro-ph;0603282	the faint afterglow and host galaxy of the short-hard grb 060121	we present optical and x-ray observations of the afterglow and host galaxy ofthe short-hard grb 060121. the faint r-band afterglow is seen to decline ast^(-0.66) while the x-ray falls as t^-1.18, indicating the presence of thecooling break between the two frequencies. however, the r-band afterglow isvery faint compared to the predicted extrapolation of the x-ray afterglow tothe optical regime (specifically, beta_ox ~ 0.2), while the k-band isconsistent with this extrapolation (beta_kx ~ 0.6), demonstrating suppressionof the optical flux. late time {\it hst} observations place stringent limits onthe afterglow r-band flux implying a break in the r-band lightcurve. they alsoshow that the burst occurred at the edge of a faint red galaxy which mostlikely lies at a significantly higher redshift than the previous opticallyidentified short-duration bursts. several neighboring galaxies also have veryred colors that are similarly suggestive of higher redshift. we considerpossible explanations for the faintness and color of the burst. our preferredmodel is that the burst occurred at moderately high redshift and wassignificantly obscured; however, it is also possible that the burst lies at z &gt;4.5 in which case the faintness of the r-band afterglow could be attributed tothe lyman-break. we discuss the implications that either scenario would havefor the nature of the progenitors of short bursts.

astro-ph;0612031	testing the standard fireball model of grbs using late x-ray afterglows  measured by swift	we show that all x-ray decay curves of grbs measured by swift can be fittedusing one or two components both of which have exactly the same functional formcomprised of an early falling exponential phase followed by a power law decay.the 1st component contains the prompt gamma-ray emission and the initial x-raydecay. the 2nd component appears later, has a much longer duration and ispresent for ~80% of grbs. it most likely arises from the external shock whicheventually develops into the x-ray afterglow. in the remaining ~20% of grbs theinitial x-ray decay of the 1st component fades more slowly than the 2nd anddominates at late times to form an afterglow but it is not clear what theorigin of this emission is.  the temporal decay parameters and gamma/x-ray spectral indices derived for107 grbs are compared to the expectations of the standard fireball modelincluding a search for possible "jet breaks". for ~50% of grbs the observedafterglow is in accord with the model but for the rest the temporal andspectral indices do not conform to the expected closure relations and aresuggestive of continued, late, energy injection. we identify a few possible jetbreaks but there are many examples where such breaks are predicted but areabsent.  the time, t_a, at which the exponential phase of the 2nd component changes toa final powerlaw decay afterglow is correlated with the peak of the gamma-rayspectrum, e_peak. this is analogous to the ghirlanda relation, indicating thatthis time is in some way related to optically observed break times measured forpre-swift bursts.

astro-ph;0612494	panchromatic study of grb 060124: from precursor to afterglow	we present observations of grb 060124, the first event for which both theprompt and the afterglow emission could be observed simultaneously and in theirentirety by the three swift instruments and by konus-wind. thanks to theseexceptional circumstances, the temporal and spectral properties of the promptemission could be studied in the optical, x-ray and gamma-ray ranges (up to 2mev). while the x-ray emission (0.2-10 kev) clearly tracks the gamma-ray burst,the optical component follows a different pattern, likely indicating adifferent origin, possibly the onset of external shocks. the prompt grbspectrum shows significant spectral evolution, with both the peak energy andthe spectral index varying. as observed in several long grbs, significant lagsare measured between the hard- and low-energy components, showing that thisbehaviour extends over 3 decades in energy. the grb peaks are also much broaderat soft energies. this is related to the temporal evolution of the spectrum,and can be accounted for by the softening of the electron spectral index withtime. the burst energy (e_iso~5x10^{53} erg at z=2.297) and average peak energy(e_p~300 kev) make grb 060124 consistent with the amati relation. the x-rayafterglow is characterized by a decay which presents a break at t_b~10^5s.

astro-ph;0701087	the prompt to late-time multiwavelength analysis of grb 060210	we present our analysis of the multiwavelength photometric &amp; spectroscopicobservations of grb 060210 and discuss the results in the overall context ofcurrent grb models. all available optical data underwent a simultaneoustemporal fit, while x-ray and gamma-ray observations were analysed temporally &amp;spectrally. the results were compared to each other and to possible grb models.the x-ray afterglow is best described by a smoothly broken power-law with abreak at 7.4 hours. the late optical afterglow has a well constrained singlepower-law index which has a value between the two x-ray indices, though it doesagree with a single power-law fit to the x-ray. an evolution of the hardness ofthe high-energy emission is demonstrated and we imply a minimum host extinctionfrom a comparison of the extrapolated x-ray flux to that measured in theoptical. we find that the flaring gamma-ray and x-ray emission is likely due tointernal shocks while the flat optical light curve at that time is due to theexternal shock. the late afterglow is best explained by a cooling break betweenthe optical and x-rays and continued central engine activity up to the time ofthe break. the required collimation corrected energy of ~ 2x10^52 erg, while atthe high end of the known energy distribution, is not unprecedented.

astro-ph;9907264	evidence for a supernova in reanalyzed optical and near-infrared images  of grb970228	we present b-, v-, r_c-, i_c-, j-, h-, k- and k'-band observations of theoptical transient (ot) associated with grb970228, based on a reanalysis ofpreviously used images and unpublished data. in order to minimize calibrationdifferences we have collected and analyzed most of the photometry andconsistently determined the magnitude of the ot relative to a set of secondaryfield stars. we confirm our earlier finding that the early decay of the lightcurves (before march 6, 1997) was faster than that at intermediate times(between march 6 and april 7, 1997). at late times the light curves resume afast decay (after april 7, 1997). the early-time observations of grb970228 areconsistent with relativistic blast-wave models but the intermediate- andlate-time observations are hard to understand in this framework. theobservations are well explained by an initial power law decay with index -1.73+0.09 -0.12 modified at later times by a type-i_c supernova light curve.together with the evidence for grb980326 and grb980425 this gives furthersupport for the idea that at least some grbs are associated with a possiblyrare type of supernova.

0706.1188	grb 060206 and the quandary of achromatic breaks in afterglow light  curves	gamma-ray burst afterglow observations in the swift era have a perceived lackof achromatic jet breaks compared to the bepposax era. we present ourmulti-wavelength analysis of grb 060206 as an illustrative example of howinferences of jet breaks from optical and x-ray data might differ. the resultsof temporal and spectral analyses are compared, and attempts are made to fitthe data within the context of the standard blast wave model. we find thatwhile the break appears more pronounced in the optical and evidence for it fromthe x-ray alone is weak, the data are actually consistent with an achromaticbreak at about 16 hours. this break and the light curves fit standard blastwave models, either as a jet break or as an injection break. as the pre-swiftsample of afterglows are dominated by optical observations, and in the swiftera most well sampled light curves are in the x-ray, caution is needed whenmaking a direct comparison between the two samples, and when making definitestatements on the absence of achromatic breaks.
