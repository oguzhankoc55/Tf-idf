physics;0403065	development of an asd ic for the micro pixel chamber	a new amplifier-shaper-discriminator (asd) chip was designed and manufacturedfor the micro pixel chamber ($\mu$-pic). the design of this asd ic is based onthe asd ic (tgc-asd) for the thin gap chamber in the lhc atlas experiment. thedecay time constant of the preamplifier is 5-times longer than that of thetgc-asd, and some other modifications have been made in order to improve thesignal-to-noise ratio of the $\mu$-pic. the asd ic uses sony analog masterslice bipolar technology. the ic contains 4 channels in a qfp48 package. thedecay time constant of the preamplifier is 80 ns and its gain is approximately0.8 v/pc. the output from the preamplifier is received by a shaper(main-amplifier) with a gain of 7. a baseline restoration circuit isincorporated in the main-amplifier, and the current used for the baselinerestoration is 5-times smaller than that of the tgc-asd. the threshold voltagefor the discriminator section is common to the 4 channels and their digitaloutput level is lvds-compatible. the asd ic also has an analog output of thepreamplifier. the equivalent noise charge at the input capacitance of 50 pf isaround 2000 electrons. the power dissipation with lvds outputs (100 $\omega$load) is 57 mw/ch. using this asd, the analog output voltage from the signal ofthe $\mu$-pic is about 2-times higher than the case of using the tgc-asd.as aconsequence, the mips tracking performance of the time projection chamber (tpc)with the $\mu$-pic was improved.the performance of the asd ic and an improvedtracking performance of the tpc are reported.

0908.3301	cangaroo-iii search for tev gamma-rays from two clusters of galaxies	because accretion and merger shocks in clusters of galaxies may accelerateparticles to high energies, clusters are candidate sites for the origin ofultra-high-energy (uhe) cosmic-rays. a prediction was presented for gamma-rayemission from a cluster of galaxies at a detectable level with the currentgeneration of imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes. the gamma-ray emissionwas produced via inverse compton upscattering of cosmic microwave background(cmb) photons by electron-positron pairs generated by collisions of uhe cosmicrays in the cluster. we observed two clusters of galaxies, abell 3667 and abell4038, searching for very-high-energy gamma-ray emission with the cangaroo-iiiatmospheric cherenkov telescope system in 2006. the analysis showed nosignificant excess around these clusters, yielding upper limits on thegamma-ray emission. from a comparison of the upper limit for the north-westradio relic region of abell 3667 with a model prediction, we derive a lowerlimit for the magnetic field of the region of ~0.1 micro g. this shows thepotential of gamma-ray observations in studies of the cluster environment. wealso discuss the flux upper limit from cluster center regions using a model ofgamma-ray emission from neutral pions produced in hadronic collisions ofcosmic-ray protons with the intra-cluster medium (icm). the derived upper limitof the cosmic-ray energy density within this framework is an order of magnitudehigher than that of our galaxy.

1311.2833	magic observations and multifrequency properties of the flat spectrum  radio quasar 3c 279 in 2011	we study the multifrequency emission and spectral properties of the quasar 3c279. we observed 3c 279 in very high energy (vhe, e&gt;100gev) gamma rays, withthe magic telescopes during 2011, for the first time in stereoscopic mode. wecombine these measurements with observations at other energy bands: in highenergy (he, e&gt;100mev) gamma rays from fermi-lat, in x-rays from rxte, in theoptical from the kva telescope and in the radio at 43ghz, 37ghz and 15ghz fromthe vlba, mets\"ahovi and ovro radio telescopes and optical polarisationmeasurements from the kva and liverpool telescopes. during the magicobservations (february to april 2011) 3c 279 was in a low state in optical,x-ray and gamma rays. the magic observations did not yield a significantdetection. these upper limits are in agreement with the extrapolation of the hegamma-ray spectrum, corrected for extragalactic background light absorption,from fermi-lat. the second part of the magic observations in 2011 was triggeredby a high activity state in the optical and gamma-ray bands. during the opticaloutburst the optical electric vector position angle rotatated of about 180degrees. there was no simultaneous rotation of the 43ghz radio polarisationangle. no vhe gamma rays were detected by magic, and the derived upper limitssuggest the presence of a spectral break or curvature between the fermi-lat andmagic bands. the combined upper limits are the strongest derived to date forthe source at vhe and below the level of the previously detected flux by afactor 2. radiation models that include synchrotron and inverse comptonemissions match the optical to gamma-ray data, assuming an emission componentinside the broad line region (blr) responsible for the high-energy emission andone outside the blr and the infrared torus causing optical and low-energyemission. we interpreted the optical polarisation with a bent trajectory model.

1311.3637	magic upper limits on the grb 090102 afterglow	indications of a gev component in the emission from grbs are known since theegret observations during the 1990's and they have been confirmed by the dataof the fermi satellite. these results have, however, shown that ourunderstanding of grb physics is still unsatisfactory. the new generation ofcherenkov observatories and in particular the magic telescope, allow for thefirst time the possibility to extend the measurement of grbs from several tensup to hundreds of gev energy range. both leptonic and hadronic processes havebeen suggested to explain the possible gev/tev counterpart of grbs.observations with ground-based telescopes of very high energy photons (e&gt;30gev) from these sources are going to play a key role in discriminating amongthe different proposed emission mechanisms, which are barely distinguishable atlower energies. magic telescope observations of the grb 090102 (z=1.547) fieldand fermi large area telescope (lat) data in the same time interval areanalysed to derive upper limits of the gev/tev emission. we compare theseresults to the expected emissions evaluated for different processes in theframework of a relativistic blast wave model for the afterglow. simultaneousupper limits with fermi and a cherenkov telescope have been derived for thisgrb observation. the results we obtained are compatible with the expectedemission although the difficulties in predicting the he and vhe emission forthe afterglow of this event makes it difficult to draw firmer conclusions.nonetheless, magic sensitivity in the energy range of overlap with space-basedinstruments (above about 40 gev) is about one order of magnitude better withrespect to fermi. this makes evident the constraining power of ground-basedobservations and shows that the magic telescope has reached the requiredperformance to make possible grb multiwavelength studies in the very highenergy range.

1408.1975	probing the very-high-energy gamma-ray spectral curvature in the blazar  pg 1553+113 with the magic telescopes	pg 1553+113 is a very-high-energy (vhe, $e&gt;100\,\mathrm{gev}$) $\gamma$-rayemitter classified as a bl lac object. its redshift is constrained byintergalactic absorption lines in the range $0.4&lt;z&lt;0.58$. the magic telescopeshave monitored the source's activity since 2005. in early 2012, pg 1553+113 wasfound in a high-state, and later, in april of the same year, the source reachedits highest vhe flux state detected so far. simultaneous observations carriedout in x-rays during 2012 april show similar flaring behaviour. in contrast,the $\gamma$-ray flux at $e&lt;100\,\mathrm{gev}$ observed by fermi-lat iscompatible with steady emission. in this paper, a detailed study of the flaringstate is presented. the vhe spectrum shows clear curvature, being well fittedeither by a power law with an exponential cut-off or by a log-parabola. asimple power-law fit hypothesis for the observed shape of the pg 1553+113 vhe$\gamma$-ray spectrum is rejected with a high significance (fit probabilityp=2.6 $\times 10^{-6}$). the observed curvature is compatible with theextragalactic background light (ebl) imprint predicted by current generationebl models assuming a redshift $z\sim0.4$. new constraints on the redshift arederived from the vhe spectrum. these constraints are compatible with previouslimits and suggest that the source is most likely located around the opticallower limit, $z=0.4$, based on the detection of ly$\alpha$ absorption. finally,we find that the synchrotron self-compton (ssc) model gives a satisfactorydescription of the observed multi-wavelength spectral energy distributionduring the flare.

1409.3389	first broadband characterization and redshift determination of the vhe  blazar magic j2001+439	we aim to characterize the broadband emission from 2fgl j2001.1+4352, whichhas been associated with the unknown-redshift blazar mg4 j200112+4352. based onits gamma-ray spectral properties, it was identified as a potential very highenergy (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) gamma-ray emitter. the source was observed with magicfirst in 2009 and later in 2010 within a multi-instrument observation campaign.the magic observations yielded 14.8 hours of good quality stereoscopic data.the object was monitored at radio, optical and gamma-ray energies during theyears 2010 and 2011. the source, named magic j2001+439, is detected for thefirst time at vhe with magic at a statistical significance of 6.3 {\sigma} (e &gt;70 gev) during a 1.3-hour long observation on 2010 july 16. themulti-instrument observations show variability in all energy bands with thehighest amplitude of variability in the x-ray and vhe bands. we also organizeddeep imaging optical observations with the nordic optical telescope in 2013 todetermine the source redshift. we determine for the first time the redshift ofthis bl lac object through the measurement of its host galaxy during low blazaractivity. using the observational evidence that the luminosities of bl lac hostgalaxies are confined to a relatively narrow range, we obtain z = 0.18 +/-0.04. additionally, we use the fermi-lat and magic gamma-ray spectra to providean independent redshift estimation, z = 0.17 +/- 0.10. using the former (moreaccurate) redshift value, we adequately describe the broadband emission with aone-zone ssc model for different activity states and interpret the few-daytimescale variability as produced by changes in the high-energy component ofthe electron energy distribution.

1409.7469	neutrino oscillation physics potential of the t2k experiment	the observation of the recent electron neutrino appearance in a muon neutrinobeam and the high-precision measurement of the mixing angle $\theta_{13}$ haveled to a re-evaluation of the physics potential of the t2k long-baselineneutrino oscillation experiment. sensitivities are explored for cp violation inneutrinos, non-maximal $\sin^22\theta_{23}$, the octant of $\theta_{23}$, andthe mass hierarchy, in addition to the measurements of $\delta_{cp}$,$\sin^2\theta_{23}$, and $\delta m^2_{32}$, for various combinations of$\nu$-mode and \(\bar{\nu}\)-mode data-taking.  with an exposure of $7.8\times10^{21}$~protons-on-target, t2k can achieve1-$\sigma$ resolution of 0.050(0.054) on $\sin^2\theta_{23}$ and$0.040(0.045)\times10^{-3}~\rm{ev}^2$ on $\delta m^2_{32}$ for 100\%(50\%)neutrino beam mode running assuming $\sin^2\theta_{23}=0.5$ and $\deltam^2_{32} = 2.4\times10^{-3}$ ev$^2$. t2k will have sensitivity to thecp-violating phase $\delta_{\rm{cp}}$ at 90\% c.l. or better over a significantrange. for example, if $\sin^22\theta_{23}$ is maximal (i.e$\theta_{23}$=$45^\circ$) the range is $-115^\circ&lt;\delta_{\rm{cp}}&lt;-60^\circ$for normal hierarchy and $+50^\circ&lt;\delta_{\rm{cp}}&lt;+130^\circ$ for invertedhierarchy. when t2k data is combined with data from the no$\nu$a experiment,the region of oscillation parameter space where there is sensitivity to observea non-zero $\delta_{cp}$ is substantially increased compared to if eachexperiment is analyzed alone.

1410.7059	discovery of very high energy gamma-ray emission from the blazar 1es  0033+595 by the magic telescopes	the number of known very high energy (vhe) blazars is $\sim\,50$, which isvery small in comparison to the number of blazars detected in otherfrequencies. this situation is a handicap for population studies of blazars,which emit about half of their luminosity in the $\gamma$-ray domain. moreover,vhe blazars, if distant, allow for the study of the environment that thehigh-energy $\gamma$-rays traverse in their path towards the earth, like theextragalactic background light (ebl) and the intergalactic magnetic field(igmf), and hence they have a special interest for the astrophysics community.we present the first vhe detection of 1es\,0033+595 with a statisticalsignificance of 5.5\,$\sigma$. the vhe emission of this object is constantthroughout the magic observations (2009 august and october), and can beparameterized with a power law with an integral flux above 150 gev of$(7.1\pm1.3)\times 10^{-12} {\mathrm{ph\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}}$ and a photon indexof ($3.8\pm0.7$). we model its spectral energy distribution (sed) as the resultof inverse compton scattering of synchrotron photons. for the study of the sedwe used simultaneous optical r-band data from the kva telescope, archival x-raydata by \textit{swift} as well as \textit{integral}, and simultaneous highenergy (he, $300$\,mev~--~$10$\,gev) $\gamma$-ray data from the \textit{fermi}lat observatory. using the empirical approach of prandini et al. (2010) and the\textit{fermi}-lat and magic spectra for this object, we estimate the redshiftof this source to be $0.34\pm0.08\pm0.05$. this is a relevant result becausethis source is possibly one of the ten most distant vhe blazars known to date,and with further (simultaneous) observations could play an important role inblazar population studies, as well as future constraints on the ebl and igmf.

1512.02235	multiwavelength study of quiescent states of mrk 421 with unprecedented  hard x-ray coverage provided by nustar in 2013	we present coordinated multiwavelength observations of the bright, nearby bllac object mrk 421 taken in 2013 january-march, involving gasp-webt, swift,nustar, fermi-lat, magic, veritas, and other collaborations and instruments,providing data from radio to very-high-energy (vhe) gamma-ray bands. nustaryielded previously unattainable sensitivity in the 3-79 kev range, revealingthat the spectrum softens when the source is dimmer until the x-ray spectralshape saturates into a steep power law with a photon index of approximately 3,with no evidence for an exponential cutoff or additional hard components up toabout 80 kev. for the first time, we observed both the synchrotron and theinverse-compton peaks of the spectral energy distribution (sed) simultaneouslyshifted to frequencies below the typical quiescent state by an order ofmagnitude. the fractional variability as a function of photon energy shows adouble-bump structure which relates to the two bumps of the broadband sed. ineach bump, the variability increases with energy which, in the framework of thesynchrotron self-compton model, implies that the electrons with higher energiesare more variable. the measured multi-band variability, the significantx-ray-to-vhe correlation down to some of the lowest fluxes ever observed inboth bands, the lack of correlation between optical/uv and x-ray flux, the lowdegree of polarization and its significant (random) variations, the shortestimated electron cooling time, and the significantly longer variabilitytimescale observed in the nustar light curves point toward in-situ electronacceleration, and suggest that there are multiple compact regions contributingto the broadband emission of mrk 421 during low-activity states.

astro-ph;0001047	evidence for tev gamma-ray emission from the shell type snr  rxj1713.7-3946	we report the results of tev gamma-ray observations of the shell type snrrxj1713.7-3946 (g347.3-0.5). the discovery of strong non-thermal x-ray emissionfrom the northwest part of the remnant strongly suggests the existence ofelectrons with energies up to 100 tev in the remnant, making the snr a goodcandidate tev gamma-ray source. we observed rxj1713.7-3946 from may to august1998 with the cangaroo 3.8m atmospheric imaging cerenkov telescope and obtainedevidence for tev gamma-ray emission from the nw rim of the remnant with thesignificance of 5.6 sigma. the observed tev gamma-ray flux from the nw rimregion was estimated to be (5.3 +/- 0.9[statistical] +/- 1.6[systematic]) *10^{-12} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} at energies &gt;= 1.8 +/- 0.9 tev. the dataindicate that the emitting region is much broader than the point spreadfunction of our telescope. the extent of the emission is consistent with thatof hard x-rays observed by asca. this tev gamma-ray emission can be attributedto the inverse compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background radiationby shock accelerated ultra-relativistic electrons. under this assumption, arather low magnetic field of 11 micro gauss is deduced for the remnant from ourobservation.

astro-ph;0006148	evidence of thick obscuring matter revealed in the x-ray spectrum of the  z=4.28 quasar rxj1028.6-0844	we report the discovery of an unambiguous, substantial low-energy cutoff inthe broad band x-ray spectrum of the radio quasar rxj1028.6-0844 at a redshiftof 4.276 obtained with the asca satellite, which we preferably explained asindication of excess x-ray absorption. the equivalent hydrogen column densityof the absorbing matter, depending on the redshift and metallicity, ranges from2.5x10**21 cm**(-2) for local absorption up to 2.1x10**23 cm**(-2) (solarmetallicity) or 1.6x10**24 cm**(-2) (10% solar metallicity) for absorption atthe quasar redshift. such a value is among the largest found for high-redshiftradio quasars. the absorption, if interpreted as being produced close to thequasar, may indicate the presence of a remarkably large amount of obscuringmatter in the quasar environment in the early universe. implications of theresult for the possible origins of the absorbing matter are discussed,concerning especially galactic intervening matter, cool intracluster gas, andambient medium around the quasar jet. the quasar itself has an enormousapparent luminosity of at least about 2.6x10**47 erg/s (h0=50, q0=0.5) and apower law photon index of 1.67(+0.07,-0.04) in the 2-50kev band in the sourcerest frame.

astro-ph;0006195	rapid synchrotron flares from bl lacertae detected by asca and rxte	we report the variable x-ray emission from bl lacertae detected in the ascatoo observation conducted during the egret and rxte pointings, coincident withthe 1997 july outburst. the source showed a historically high state of x-ray,optical, and gamma-ray emission, with its 2-10 kev flux peaking at ~3.3 e-11erg/cm2/s. this is more than 3 times higher than the value measured by asca in1995. we detected two rapid flares which occured only in the soft x-ray band,while the hard x-ray flux also increased, but decayed with a much longer timescale. together with the requirement of a very steep and varying power lawdominating the soft x-ray band in addition to the hard power law, we suggestthat both the high energy end of the synchrotron spectrum and the hard inversecompton spectrum were visible in this source during the outburst. we discussthe possible origins of the observed variability time scales, and interpret theshort time scales of the soft x-ray variability as reflecting the size of theemission region.

astro-ph;0008505	complex spectral variability from intensive multi-wavelength monitoring  of mrk421 in 1998	we conducted a multi-frequency campaign for the tev blazar mrk~421 in 1998april. the campaign started from a pronounced high amplitude flare recorded bysax and whipple; asca observation started three days later. in the x-ray data,we detected multiple flares, occuring on time scales of about one day. ascadata clearly reveal spectral variability. the comparison of the data from asca,euve and rxte indicates that the variability amplitudes in the low energysynchrotron component are larger at higher photon energies. in tev gamma-rays,large intra-day variations -- which were correlated with the x-ray flux -- wereobserved when results from three cherenkov telescopes are combined. the rmsvariability of tev gamma--rays was similar to that observed in hard x-rays,above 10 kev. the x-ray light curve reveals flares which are almost symmetricfor most of cases, implying the dominant time scale is the light crossing timethrough the emitting region. the structure function analysis based on thecontinuous x-ray light curve of seven days indicates that the characteristictime scale is ~0.5 day. the analysis of asca light curves in various energybands appears to show both soft (positive) and hard (negative) lags. these maynot be real, as systematic effects could also produce these lags, which are allmuch smaller than an orbit. if the lags of both signs are real, these implythat the particle acceleration and x-ray cooling time scales are similar.

astro-ph;0610118	monte-carlo simulator and ancillary response generator of suzaku xrt/xis  system for spatially extended source analysis	we have developed a framework for the monte-carlo simulation of the x-raytelescopes (xrt) and the x-ray imaging spectrometers (xis) onboard suzaku,mainly for the scientific analysis of spatially and spectroscopically complexcelestial sources. a photon-by-photon instrumental simulator is built on theanl platform, which has been successfully used in asca data analysis. thesimulator has a modular structure, in which the xrt simulation is based on aray-tracing library, while the xis simulation utilizes a spectral"redistribution matrix file" (rmf), generated separately by other tools.instrumental characteristics and calibration results, e.g., xrt geometry,reflectivity, mutual alignments, thermal shield transmission, build-up of thecontamination on the xis optical blocking filters (obf), are incorporated ascompletely as possible. most of this information is available in the form ofthe fits (flexible image transport system) files in the standard calibrationdatabase (caldb). this simulator can also be utilized to generate an "ancillaryresponse file" (arf), which describes the xrt response and the amount of obfcontamination. the arf is dependent on the spatial distribution of thecelestial target and the photon accumulation region on the detector, as well asobserving conditions such as the observation date and satellite attitude. wedescribe principles of the simulator and the arf generator, and demonstratetheir performance in comparison with in-flight data.

astro-ph;9701133	the structure of the x-ray emitting gas in the hydra-a cluster of  galaxies	the temperature and abundance structure in the intracluster medium (icm) ofthe hydra-a cluster of galaxies is studied with asca and rosat. the effect ofthe large extended outskirts in the point-spread function of the x-raytelescope on asca is included in this analysis. in the x-ray brightnessprofile, the strong central excess above a single beta-model, identified in theeinstein and rosat data, is also found in the harder energy band (&gt;4kev). asimultaneous fit of five annular spectra taken with the gis instrument shows aradial distribution of the temperature and metal abundance. a significantcentral enhancement in the abundance distribution is found, while thetemperature profile suggests that the icm is approximately isothermal with thetemperature of ~3.5kev. the rosat pspc spectrum in the central 1'.5 regionindicates a significantly lower temperature than the gis result. a jointanalysis of the gis and pspc data reveals that the spectra can be described bya two temperature model as well as by a cooling flow model. in both cases, thehot phase gas with the temperature of ~3.5kev occupies more than 90% of thetotal emission measure within 1'.5 from the cluster center. the estimated massof the cooler (0.5-0.7kev) component is ~2-6 x 10^9 m_solar, which iscomparable to the mass of hot halos seen in non-cd ellipticals. the coolingflow model gives the mass deposition rate of 60+-30 m_solar/yr, an order ofmagnitude lower than the previous estimation.

astro-ph;9804031	asca observations of blazars and multiband analysis	we present data for 18 blazars observed with asca, half of which were alsoobserved contemporaneously with egret as parts of multi-wavelength campaigns.the observations show a clear difference in the spectra between threesubclasses of blazars, namely the high-energy peaked bl lac objects (hbls),low-energy peaked bl lac objects (lbls), and quasar-hosted blazars (qhbs). wefind that the radiation process responsible for the he peak for hbls can beexplained solely by synchrotron-self-compton (ssc) emission, with the dopplerfactor consistent with the vlbi and/or gamma-ray variability data. for manyqhbs, on the other hand, the gamma-rays cannot be solely due to the sscmechanism unless the doppler factor is significantly in excess of that inferredfrom vlbi data. we consider an alternative scenario consistent with themeasured values of the doppler factor, where the ssc component is still presentin qhbs and it dominates in the x-ray band, but it is below the observedgamma-ray spectrum. with an assumption that the peak of the ssc emission is onthe extrapolation of the x-ray spectrum, and adopting the doppler factor of 10,we infer the magnetic field to be 0.1 - 1 gauss, and lorentz factors ofelectrons radiating at the peak of the nu f(nu) spectrum of 10^3 for qhbs; thisis much lower than 10^5 for hbls. this difference is most likely due to thelarge photon density expected in qhbs.

astro-ph;9811014	a study of high energy emission from the tev blazar mrk 501 during  multiwavelength observations in 1996	we present the results of a multiwavelength campaign for mrk 501 performed inmarch 1996 with asca, egret, whipple, and optical telescopes. in the x-rayband, a spectral break was observed around 2 kev. we report here for the firsttime the detection of high-energy gamma-ray flux from mrk 501 with egret with3.5 sigma significance (e&gt;100 mev). higher flux was also observed in april/may1996, with 4.0 sigma significance for e&gt;100 mev, and 5.2 sigma significance fore&gt;500 mev. the gamma-ray spectrum was measured to be flatter than most of thegamma-ray blazars. we find that the multiband spectrum in 1996 is consistentwith that calculated from a one-zone ssc model in a homogeneous region. in thecontext of this model, we investigate the values of the magnetic field strengthand the beaming factor allowed by the observational results. we compare themarch 1996 multiwavelength spectrum with that in the flare state in april 1997.between these two epochs, the tev flux increase is well correlated with thatobserved in kev range. the kev and tev amplitudes during the april 1997 flareare accurately reproduced, assuming that the population of synchrotron photonsin 1996 are scattered by the newly injected relativistic electrons, havingmaximum energies of g_max = 6.0e6. however, the tev spectrum observed duringmarch 1996 campaign is flatter than predicted by our models. we find that thiscannot be explained by either higher order comptonization or the contributionof the `seed' ir photons from the host galaxy for the first-order externalradiation comptonization.

astro-ph;9906326	ultraviolet and multiwavelength variability of the blazar 3c 279:  evidence for thermal emission	the gamma-ray blazar 3c 279 was monitored on a nearly daily basis with iue,rosat and egret for three weeks between december 1992 and january 1993. duringthis period, the blazar was at a historical minimum at all wavelengths. here wepresent the uv data obtained during the above multiwavelength campaign. amaximum uv variation of ~50% is detected, while during the same period thex-ray flux varied by no more than 13%. at the lowest uv flux level the averagespectrum in the 1230-2700 a interval is unusually flat for this object(&lt;alpha_uv&gt;~1). the flattening could represent the lowest energy tail of theinverse compton component responsible for the x-ray emission, or could be dueto the presence of a thermal component at ~20000 k possibly associated with anaccretion disk. the presence of an accretion disk in this blazar object, likelyobservable only in very low states and otherwise hidden by the beamed, variablesynchrotron component, would be consistent with the scenario in which the seedphotons for the inverse compton mechanism producing the gamma-rays are externalto the relativistic jet. we further discuss the long term correlation of the uvflux with the x-ray and gamma-ray fluxes obtained at various epochs. all uvarchival data are included in the analysis. both the x- and gamma-ray fluxesare generally well correlated with the uv flux, approximately with square rootand quadratic dependences, respectively.
