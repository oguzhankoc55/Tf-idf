0906.3140	on the metallicity gradient of the galactic disk	aims: the iron abundance gradient in the galactic stellar disk providesfundamental constraints on the chemical evolution of this important galaxycomponent. however the spread around the mean slope is, at fixed galactocentricdistance, larger than estimated uncertainties. methods: to provide quantitativeconstraints on these trends we adopted iron abundances for 265 classicalcepheids (more than 50% of the currently known sample) based either onhigh-resolution spectra or on photometric metallicity indices. homogeneousdistances were estimated using near-infrared period-luminosity relations. thesample covers the four disk quadrants and their galactocentric distances rangefrom ~5 to ~17 kpc. results: a linear regression over the entire sampleprovides an iron gradient of -0.051+/-0.004 dex/kpc. the above slope agreesquite well, within the errors, with previous estimates based either on cepheidsor on open clusters covering similar galactocentric distances. however, once wesplit the sample in inner (rg &lt; 8 kpc) and outer disk cepheids we found thatthe slope (-0.130+/-0.015 dex/kpc) in the former region is ~3 times steeperthan the slope in the latter one (-0.042+/-0.004 dex/kpc). we found that in theouter disk the radial distribution of metal-poor (mp, [fe/h]&lt;-0.02 dex) andmetal-rich (mr) cepheids across the four disk quadrants does not show a cleartrend when moving from the innermost to the external disk regions. we alsofound that the relative fractions of mp and mr cepheids in the 1st and in the3rd quadrant differ at 8 sigma (mp) and 15 sigma (mr) level.

0707.1019	stroemgren photometry of galactic globular clusters. i. new calibrations  of the metallicity index	we present a new calibration of the stroemgren metallicity index m1 using redgiant (rg) stars in 4 globular clusters (gcs:m92,m13,ngc1851,47tuc) withmetallicity ranging from [fe/h]=-2.2 to -0.7, marginally affected by reddening(e(b-v)&lt;0.04) and with accurate u,v,b,y photometry.the main difference betweenthe new metallicity-index-color (mic) relations and similar relations availablein the literature is that we adopted the u-y/v-y colors instead of theb-y.these colors present a stronger sensitivity to effective temperature, andthe mic relations show a linear slope. the difference between photometricestimates and spectroscopic measurements for rgs in m71,ngc288,ngc362,ngc6397,and ngc6752 is 0.04+/-0.03dex (sigma=0.11dex). we also apply the mic relationsto 85 field rgs with metallicity raning from [fe/h]=-2.4 to -0.5 and accuratereddening estimates. we find that the difference between photometric estimatesand spectroscopic measurements is-0.14+/-0.01dex (sig=0.17dex). we also providetwo sets of mic relations based on evolutionary models that have beentransformed into the observational plane by adopting either semi-empirical ortheoretical color-temperature relations. we apply the semi-empirical relationsto the 9 gcs and find that the difference between photometric and spectroscopicmetallicities is 0.04+/-0.03dex (sig=0.10dex).a similar agreement is found forthe sample of field rgs, with a difference of -0.09+/-0.03dex (sig=0.19dex).thedifference between metallicity estimates based on theoretical relations andspectroscopic measurements is -0.11+/-0.03dex (sig=0.14dex) for the 9 ggcs and-0.24+/-0.03dex (sig=0.15dex) for the field rgs. current evidence indicatesthat new mic relations provide metallicities with an intrinsic accuracy betterthan 0.2dex.

0909.4661	stromgren photometry of galactic globular clusters. ii metallicity  distribution of red giants in omega centauri	we present new intermediate-band stroemgren photometry based on more than 300u,v,b,y images of the galactic globular cluster omega cen. optical data weresupplemented with new multiband near-infrared (nir) photometry (350 j,h,k_simages). the final optical-nir catalog covers a region of more than 20*20arcmin squared across the cluster center. we use different optical-nircolor-color planes together with proper motion data available in the literatureto identify candidate cluster red giant (rg) stars. by adopting differentstroemgren metallicity indices we estimate the photometric metallicity for~4,000 rgs, the largest sample ever collected. the metallicity distributionsshow multiple peaks([fe/h]_phot=-1.73+/-0.08,-1.29+/-0.03,-1.05+/-0.02,-0.80+/-0.04,-0.42+/-0.12and -0.07+/-0.08 dex) and a sharp cut-off in the metal-poor tail([fe/h]_phot&lt;=-2 dex) that agree quite well with spectroscopic measurements. weidentify four distinct sub-populations,namely metal-poor (mp,[fe/h]&lt;=-1.49),metal-intermediate (mi,-1.49&lt;[fe/h]&lt;=-0.93), metal-rich(mr,-0.95&lt;[fe/h]&lt;=-0.15) and solar metallicity (sm,[fe/h]~0). the last groupincludes only a small fraction of stars (~8+/-5%) and should be confirmedspectroscopically. moreover, using the difference in metallicity based ondifferent photometric indices, we find that the 19+/-1% of rgs are candidatecn-strong stars. this fraction agrees quite well with recent spectroscopicestimates and could imply a large fraction of binary stars. the stroemgrenmetallicity indices display a robust correlation with alpha-elements([ca+si/h]) when moving from the metal-intermediate to the metal-rich regime([fe/h]&gt;-1.7 dex).

0912.0824	on a new near-infrared method to estimate the absolute ages of star  clusters: ngc3201 as a first test case	we present a new method to estimate the absolute ages of stellar systems.this method is based on the difference in magnitude between the main sequenceturn-off (msto) and a well defined knee located along the lower main sequence(msk). this feature is caused by the collisionally induced absorption ofmolecular hydrogen and it can be easily identified in near-infrared (nir) andin optical-nir color-magnitude diagrams of stellar systems. we took advantageof deep and accurate nir images collected with the multi-conjugate adaptiveoptics demonstrator temporarily available on the very large telescope and ofoptical images collected with the advanced camera for surveys wide field cameraon the hubble space telescope and with ground-based telescopes to estimate theabsolute age of the globular ngc3201 using both the msto and thedelta(msto-msk). we have adopted a new set of cluster isochrones and we foundthat the absolute ages based on the two methods agree to within one sigma.however, the errors of the ages based on the delta(msto-msk) method arepotentially more than a factor of two smaller, since they are not affected byuncertainties in cluster distance or reddening.current isochrones appear topredict slightly bluer (~0.05mag) nir and optical-nir colors than observed formagnitudes fainter than the msk.

1002.2074	on the delta v_hb_bump parameter in globular clusters	we present new empirical estimates of the delta v_hb_bump parameter for 15galactic globular clusters (ggcs) using accurate and homogeneous ground-basedoptical data. together with similar evaluations available in the literature, weended up with a sample of 62 ggcs covering a very broad range in metal content(-2.16&lt;=[m/h]&lt;=-0.58 dex). adopting the homogeneous metallicity scale providedeither by kraft &amp; ivans (2004) or by carretta et al. (2009), we found that theobserved delta v_hb_bump parameters are larger than predicted. in themetal-poor regime ([m/h]&lt;=-1.7, -1.6 dex) 40% of gcs show discrepancies of2sigma (~0.40 mag) or more. evolutionary models that account either for alpha-and cno-enhancement or for helium enhancement do not alleviate the discrepancybetween theory and observations. the outcome is the same if we use the newsolar heavy-element mixture. the comparison between alpha- and cno-enhancedevolutionary models and observations in the carretta et al. metallicity scalealso indicates that observed delta v_hb_bump parameters, in the metal-richregime ([m/h]=&gt;0), might be systematically smaller than predicted.

1003.3854	new baade-wesselink distances and radii for four metal-rich galactic  cepheids	we provided accurate estimates of distances, radii and iron abundances forfour metal-rich cepheids, namely v340 ara, uz sct, av sgr and vy sgr. the mainaim of this investigation is to constrain their pulsation properties and theirlocation across the galactic inner disk. we adopted new accurate nir (j,h,k)light curves and new radial velocity measurements for the target cepheids todeterminate their distances and radii using the baade-wesselink technique. inparticular, we adopted the most recent calibration of the ir surface brightnessrelation and of the projection factor. moreover, we also provided accuratemeasurements of the iron abundance of the target cepheids. current distanceestimates agree within one sigma with similar distances based either onempirical or on theoretical nir period-luminosity relations. however, theuncertainties of the baade-wesselink distances are on average a factor of 3-4smaller when compared with errors affecting other distance determinations. meanbaade-wesselink radii also agree at one sigma level with cepheid radii basedeither on empirical or on theoretical period-radius relations. iron abundancesare, within one sigma, similar to the iron contents provided by andrievsky andcollaborators, thus confirming the super metal-rich nature of the targetcepheids. we also found that the luminosity amplitudes of classical cepheids,at odds with rr lyrae stars, do not show a clear correlation with themetal-content. this circumstantial evidence appears to be the consequence ofthe hertzsprung progression together with the dependence of the topology of theinstability strip on metallicity, evolutionary effects and binaries.

1004.2559	on the stellar content of the carina dwarf spheroidal galaxy	we present u,b,v,i photometry of the carina dwarf spheroidal galaxy, based onmore than 4,000 ccd images. special attention was given to the photometriccalibration, and the precision for the b,v,i bands is better than 0.01 mag. wecompared in the v,b-v and v,b-i color-magnitude diagrams (cmds) carina withthree globular clusters (gcs, m53, m55, m79). we find that only the moremetal-poor gcs (m55, [fe/h]=-1.85; m53, [fe/h]=-2.02 dex) provide a good matchwith the carina giant branch. we performed a similar comparison in the v,v-icmd with three smc intermediate-age clusters (iacs, kron3, ngc339, lindsay38).we find that the color extent of the sgb of the two more metal-rich iacs(kron3, [fe/h]=-1.08; ngc339, [fe/h]=-1.36 dex) is smaller than the range amongcarina's intermediate-age stars. however, the ridge line of the more metal-pooriac (lindsay38, [fe/h]=-1.59 dex) agrees quite well with the carinaintermediate-age stars. these findings indicate that carina's old stellarpopulation is metal-poor and seems to have a limited spread in metallicity(delta [fe/h]=0.2--0.3 dex). carina intermediate-age stars can hardly be moremetal-rich than lindsay38 and its spread in metallicity appears modest. we alsofind that the synthetic cmd constructed assuming a metallicity spread of 0.5dex for intermediate-age stars predicts evolutionary features not supported byobservations. the above results are at odds with recent spectroscopicinvestigations suggesting that carina stars cover a broad range in metallicity(delta [fe/h]~1--2 dex). we present a new method to estimate the metallicity ofcomplex stellar systems using the difference in color between the red clump andthe middle of the rr lyrae instability strip. the observed colors of carina'sevolved stars indicate a metallicity of [fe/h]=-1.70+-0.19 dex, which agreesquite well with spectroscopic measurements.

1006.5217	on the absolute age of the globular cluster m92	we present precise and deep optical photometry of the globular m92. data werecollected in three different photometric systems: sloan digital sky survey(g',r',i',z'; megacam@cfht), johnson-kron-cousins (b, v, i; variousground-based telescopes) and advanced camera for surveys (acs) vegamag (f475w,f555w, f814w; hubble space telescope). special attention was given to thephotometric calibration, and the precision of the ground-based data isgenerally better than 0.01 mag. we computed a new set of {\alpha}-enhancedevolutionary models accounting for the gravitational settling of heavy elementsat fixed chemical composition ([{\alpha}/fe]=+0.3, [fe/h]=-2.32 dex, y=0.248).the isochrones -- assuming the same true distance modulus ({\mu}=14.74 mag),the same reddening (e(b-v)=0.025+-0.010 mag), and the same reddening law --account for the stellar distribution along the main sequence and the red giantbranch in different color-magnitude diagrams (i',g'-i' ; i',g'-r' ; i',g'-z' ;i,b-i ; f814w,f475w-f814w). the same outcome applies to the comparison betweenthe predicted zero-age-horizontal-branch (zahb) and the hb stars. we also founda cluster age of 11 +/- 1.5 gyr, in good agreement with previous estimates. theerror budget accounts for uncertainties in the input physics and thephotometry. to test the possible occurrence of cno-enhanced stars, we alsocomputed two sets of {\alpha}- and cno-enhanced (by a factor of three) modelsboth at fixed total metallicity ([m/h]=-2.10 dex) and at fixed iron abundance.we found that the isochrones based on the former set give the same cluster age(11 +/- 1.5 gyr) as the canonical {\alpha}-enhanced isochrones. the isochronesbased on the latter set also give a similar cluster age (10 +/- 1.5 gyr). theseindings support previous results concerning the weak sensitivity of clusterisochrones to cno-enhanced chemical mixtures.

1009.3917	on the radial extent of the dwarf irregular galaxy ic10	we present new deep and accurate space (advanced camera for surveys -- widefield planetary camera 2 at the hubble space telescope) and ground-based(suprime-cam at subaru telescope, mega-cam at canada-france-hawaii telescope)photometric and astrometric data for the local group dwarf irregular ic10. weconfirm the significant decrease of the young stellar population when movingfrom the center toward the outermost regions. we find that the tidal radius ofic10 is significantly larger than previous estimates of $r_t \lesssim$ 10\min.by using the $i$,\vmi\ color magnitude diagram based on the suprime-cam data wedetect sizable samples of red giant (rg) stars up to radial distances of18-23$'$ from the galactic center. the ratio between observed star counts(mega-cam data) across the tip of the rg branch and star counts predicted bygalactic models indicate a star count excess at least at a 3$\sigma$ level upto 34-42\min\ from the center. this finding supports the hypothesis that thehuge h{\size{i}} cloud covering more than one degree across the galaxy isassociated with ic10 \citep{huchtmeier79,cohen79}. we also provide newestimates of the total luminosity ($l_v\sim9\times$$10^7$ $l_\odot$,$m_v$$\sim$-15.1 mag) that agrees with similar estimates available in theliterature. if we restrict to the regions where rotational velocitymeasurements are available (r$\approx13'$), we find a mass-to-light ratio($\sim$10 $m_\odot$ $l_\odot$) that is at least one order of magnitude largerthan previous estimates. the new estimate should be cautiously treated, sinceit is based on a minimal fraction of the body of the galaxy.

1106.2734	on a new parameter to estimate the helium content in old stellar systems	we introduce a new parameter {\delta}{\xi} - the difference in magnitudebetween the red giant branch (rgb) bump and a point on the main sequence (ms)at the same color as the bump, the "benchmark" - to estimate the helium contentin old stellar systems. its sensitivity to helium is linear over the entiremetallicity range, it is minimally affected by age, uncertainties in thephotometric zero-point, reddening or the effects of evolution on the horizontalbranch. the two main drawbacks are the need for precise and large photometricdata sets, and a strong dependence of the {\delta}y/{\delta}{\xi} slope onmetallicity. to test the {\delta}{\xi} parameter we selected 22 galacticglobular clusters (ggcs) with low foreground reddening, a broad range of ironabundance and precise, relatively deep, and homogeneous multi-band (b,v,i)photometry. we found that the observed {\delta}{\xi} and those predicted from{\alpha}-enhanced models agree quite well if we assume y=0.20. comparison withcanonical primordial helium content models (y=0.245, {\delta}y/{\delta}z=1.4)indicates that the observed {\delta}{\xi} values are systematically smallerthan predicted. the outcome is the same if predicted parameters are based onmodels that take into account also cno enhancements and becomes even larger ifwe consider he-enhanced models. these findings suggest that current stellarevolutionary models overestimate the luminosity of the rgb bump. we also foundthat including envelope overshooting can eliminate the discrepancy, asoriginally suggested by alongi et al. (1993, aaps, 97, 851). the {\delta}{\xi}parameter of ggcs, in spite of the possible limitations concerning the inputphysics of current evolutionary models, provides an independent detection ofpre-stellar helium at least at the 5{\sigma} level.

1204.4612	the carina project. v. the impact of nlte effects on the iron content	we have performed accurate iron abundance measurements for 44 red giants(rgs) in the carina dwarf spheroidal (dsph) galaxy. we used archival,high-resolution spectra (r~38,000) collected with uves at eso/vlt either inslit mode (5) or in fiber mode (39, flames/giraffe-uves). the sample is morethan a factor of four larger than any previous spectroscopic investigation ofstars in dsphs based on high-resolution (r&gt;38,000) spectra. we did not imposethe ionization equilibrium between neutral and singly-ionized iron lines. theeffective temperatures and the surface gravities were estimated by fittingstellar isochrones in the v, b-v color-magnitude diagram. to measure the ironabundance of individual lines we applied the lte spectrum synthesis fittingmethod using marcs model atmospheres of appropriate metallicity. we foundevidence of nlte effects between neutral and singly-ionized iron abundances.assuming that the feii abundances are minimally affected by nlte effects, wecorrected the fei stellar abundances using a linear fit between fei and feiistellar abundance determinations.  we found that the carina metallicity distribution based on the corrected feiabundances (44 rgs) has a weighted mean metallicity of [fe/h]=-1.80 and aweighted standard deviation of sigma=0.24 dex. the carina metallicitydistribution based on the feii abundances (27 rgs) gives similar estimates([fe/h]=-1.72, sigma=0.24 dex). the current weighted mean metallicities areslightly more metal poor when compared with similar estimates available in theliterature. furthermore, if we restrict our analysis to stars with the mostaccurate iron abundances, ~20 fei and at least three feii measurements (15stars), we found that the range in iron abundances covered by carina rgs (~1dex) agrees quite well with similar estimates based on high-resolution spectra.

1206.5529	the infrared eye of the wide-field camera 3 on the hubble space  telescope reveals multiple main sequences of very low-mass stars in ngc 2808	we use images taken with the infrared channel of the wide field camera 3 onthe hubble space telescope (hst) to study the multiple main sequences (mss) ofngc 2808. below the turn off, the red, the middle, and the blue ms, previouslydetected from visual-band photometry, are visible over an interval of about 3.5f160w magnitudes. the three mss merge together at the level of the ms bend. atfainter magnitudes, the ms again splits into two components containing ~65% and~35% of stars, with the most-populated ms being the bluest one. theoreticalisochrones suggest that the latter is connected to the red ms discovered in theoptical color-magnitude diagram (cmd), and hence corresponds to the firststellar generation, having primordial helium and enhanced carbon and oxygenabundances. the less-populated ms in the faint part of the near-ir cmd ishelium-rich and poor in carbon and oxygen, and it can be associated with themiddle and the blue ms of the optical cmd. the finding that the photometricsignature of abundance anticorrelation are also present in fully convective msstars reinforces the inference that they have a primordial origin.

1212.4376	on the distance of the magellanic clouds using cepheid nir and  optical-nir period wesenheit relations	we present the largest near-infrared (nir) data sets, $jhks$, ever collectedfor classical cepheids in the magellanic clouds (mcs). we selected fundamental(fu) and first overtone (fo) pulsators, and found 4150 (2571 fu, 1579 fo)cepheids for small magellanic cloud (smc) and 3042 (1840 fu, 1202 fo) for largemagellanic cloud (lmc). current sample is 2--3 times larger than any sampleused in previous investigations with nir photometry. we also discuss optical$vi$ photometry from ogle-iii. nir and optical--nir period-wesenheit (pw)relations are linear over the entire period range ($0.0&lt;\log p_{\rm fu} \le1.65$) and their slopes are, within the intrinsic dispersions, common between themcs. these are consistent with recent results from pulsation models andobservations suggesting that the pw relations are minimally affected by themetal content. the new fu and fo pw relations were calibrated using a sample ofgalactic cepheids with distances based on trigonometric parallaxes and cepheidpulsation models. by using fu cepheids we found a true distance moduli of$18.45\pm0.02{\rm(random)}\pm0.10{\rm(systematic)}$ mag (lmc) and$18.93\pm0.02{\rm(random)}\pm0.10{\rm(systematic)}$ mag (smc). these estimatesare the weighted mean over ten pw relations and the systematic errors accountfor uncertainties in the zero-point and in the reddening law. we found similardistances using fo cepheids($18.60\pm0.03{\rm(random)}\pm0.10{\rm(systematic)}$ mag [lmc] and$19.12\pm0.03{\rm(random)}\pm0.10{\rm(systematic)}$ mag [smc]). these new mcdistances lead to the relative distance, $\delta\mu=0.48\pm0.03$ mag (fu, $\logp=1$) and $\delta\mu=0.52\pm0.03$ mag (fo, $\log p=0.5$),which agrees quitewell with previous estimates based on robust distance indicators.

1302.1714	on the density profile of the globular cluster m92	we present new number density and surface brightness profiles for theglobular cluster m92 (ngc 6341). these profiles are calculated from opticalimages collected with the ccd mosaic camera megacam at thecanada-france-hawaii-telescope and with the advanced camera for surveys on thehubble space telescope. the ground-based data were supplemented with the sloandigital sky survey photometric catalog. special care was taken to discriminatecandidate cluster stars from field stars and to subtract the backgroundcontamination from both profiles. by examining the contour levels of the numberdensity, we found that the stellar distribution becomes clumpy at radialdistances larger than about 13 arcminutes, and there is no preferredorientation of contours in space. we performed detailed fits of king and wilsonmodels to the observed profiles. the best-fit models underestimate the numberdensity inside the core radius. wilson models better represent theobservations, in particular in the outermost cluster regions: the good globalagreement of these models with the observations suggests that there is no needto introduce an extra-tidal halo to explain the radial distribution of stars atlarge radial distances. the best-fit models for the number density and thesurface brightness profiles are different, even though they are based on thesame observations. additional tests support the evidence that this factreflects the difference in the radial distribution of the stellar tracers thatdetermine the observed profiles (main sequence stars for the number density,bright evolved stars for the surface brightness).

1305.2742	on the metallicity distribution of classical cepheids in the galactic  inner disk	we present homogeneous and accurate iron abundances for almost four dozen(47) of galactic cepheids using high-spectral resolution (r$\sim$40,000) highsignal-to-noise ratio (s/n $\ge$ 100) optical spectra collected with uves atvlt. a significant fraction of the sample (32) is located in the inner disk (rg$le$ 6.9 kpc) and for half of them we provide new iron abundances. currentfindings indicate a steady increase in iron abundance when approaching theinnermost regions of the thin disk. the metallicity is super-solar and rangesfrom 0.2 dex for rg $\sim$ 6.5 kpc to 0.4 dex for rg $\sim$ 5.5 kpc. moreover,we do not find evidence of correlation between iron abundance and distance fromthe galactic plane. we collected similar data available in the literature andended up with a sample of 420 cepheids. current data suggest that the meanmetallicity and the metallicity dispersion in the four quadrants of thegalactic disk attain similar values. the first-second quadrants show a moreextended metal-poor tail, while the third-fourth quadrants show a more extendedmetal-rich tail, but the bulk of the sample is at solar iron abundance.finally, we found a significant difference between the iron abundance ofcepheids located close to the edge of the inner disk ([fe/h]$\sim$0.4) andyoung stars located either along the galactic bar or in the nuclear bulge([fe/h]$\sim$0). thus suggesting that the above regions have had differentchemical enrichment histories. the same outcome applies to the metallicitygradient of the galactic bulge, since mounting empirical evidence indicatesthat the mean metallicity increases when moving from the outer to the innerbulge regions.

1307.3858	the carina project. vi. the helium burning variable stars	we present new optical (bvi) time-series data for the evolved variable starsin the carina dwarf spheroidal galaxy. the quality of the data and theobserving strategy allowed us to identify 14 new variable stars. eight out ofthe 14 are rr lyrae (rrl) stars, four are anomalous cepheids (acs) and two aregeometrical variables. comparison of the period distribution for the entiresample of rrls with similar distributions in nearby dsphs and in the largemagellanic cloud indicates that the old stellar populations in these systemsshare similar properties. this finding is also supported by the rrldistribution in the bailey diagram. on the other hand, the period distributionand the bailey diagram of acs display significant differences among the abovestellar systems. this evidence suggests that the properties of intermediate-agestellar populations might be affected both by environmental effects andstructural parameters. we use the bv period--wesenheit (pw) relation of rrlstogether with evolutionary prescriptions and find a true distance modulus of20.09+/-0.07(intrinsic)+/-0.1(statistical) mag that agrees quite well withsimilar estimates available in the literature. we identified four peculiarvariables. taking into account their position in the bailey diagram and in thebv pw relation, two of them (v14, v149) appear to be candidate acs, while two(v158, v182) might be peculiar rrls. in particular, the variable v158 has aperiod and a v-band amplitude very similar to the low-mass rrl---rrlr-02792---recently identified by pietrzynski at al.

1312.2272	on the kinematic separation of field and cluster stars across the bulge  globular ngc 6528	we present deep and precise multi-band photometry of the galactic bulgeglobular cluster ngc6528. the current dataset includes optical andnear-infrared images collected with acs/wfc, wfc3/uvis, and wfc3/ir on boardthe hubble space telescope. the images cover a time interval of almost tenyears and we have been able to carry out a proper-motion separation betweencluster and field stars. we performed a detailed comparison in the m_f814w,m_f606w - m_f814w color-magnitude diagram with two empirical calibratorsobserved in the same bands. we found that ngc6528 is coeval with and moremetal-rich than 47tuc. moreover, it appears older and more metal-poor than thesuper-metal-rich open cluster ngc6791. the current evidence is supported byseveral diagnostics (red horizontal branch, red giant branch bump, shape of thesub-giant branch, slope of the main sequence) that are minimally affected byuncertainties in reddening and distance. we fit the optical observations withtheoretical isochrones based on a scaled-solar chemical mixture and found anage of 11 +- 1 gyr and an iron abundance slightly above solar ([fe/h = +0.20).the iron abundance and the old cluster age further support the recentspectroscopic findings suggesting a rapid chemical enrichment of the galacticbulge.

1403.6128	on the fine structure of the cepheid metallicity gradient in the  galactic thin disk	we present homogeneous and accurate iron abundances for 42 galactic cepheidsbased on high-spectral resolution (r~38,000) high signal-to-noise ratio(snr&gt;100) optical spectra collected with uves at vlt (128 spectra). the aboveabundances were complemented with high-quality iron abundances provided eitherby our group (86) or available in the literature. we paid attention in derivinga common metallicity scale and ended up with a sample of 450 cepheids. we alsoestimated for the entire sample accurate individual distances by usinghomogeneous near-infrared photometry and the reddening free period-wesenheitrelations. the new metallicity gradient is linear over a broad range ofgalactocentric distances (rg~5-19 kpc) and agrees quite well with similarestimates available in the literature (-0.060+/-0.002 dex/kpc). we also uncoverevidence which suggests that the residuals of the metallicity gradient aretightly correlated with candidate cepheid groups (cgs). the candidate cgs havebeen identified as spatial overdensities of cepheids located across the thindisk. they account for a significant fraction of the residual fluctuations, andin turn for the large intrinsic dispersion of the metallicity gradient. weperformed a detailed comparison with metallicity gradients based on differenttracers: ob stars and open clusters. we found very similar metallicitygradients for ages younger than 3 gyrs, while for older ages we found ashallower slope and an increase in the intrinsic spread. the above findingsrely on homogeneous age, metallicity and distance scales. finally we found, byusing a large sample of galactic and magellanic cepheids for which areavailable accurate iron abundances, that the dependence of the luminosityamplitude on metallicity is vanishing.

1406.0944	the halo+cluster system of the galactic globular cluster ngc1851	ngc1851 is surrounded by a stellar component that extends more than ten timesbeyond the tidal radius. although the nature of this stellar structure is notknown, it has been suggested to be a sparse halo of stars or associated with astellar stream. we analyse the nature of this intriguing stellar componentsurrounding ngc1851 by investigating its radial velocities and chemicalcomposition, in particular in comparison with those of the central clusteranalysed in a homogeneous manner. in total we observed 23 stars in the halowith radial velocities consistent with ngc1851, and for 15 of them we infer[fe/h] abundances. our results show that: (i) stars dynamically linked tongc1851 are present at least up to ~2.5 tidal radii, supporting the presence ofa halo of stars surrounding the cluster; (ii) apart from the ngc1851 radialvelocity-like stars, our observed velocity distribution agrees with thatexpected from galactic models, suggesting that no other sub-structure (such asa stream) at different radial velocities is present in our field; (iii) thechemical abundances for the s-process elements sr and ba are consistent withthe s-normal stars observed in ngc1851; (iv) all halo stars have metallicities,and abundances for the other studied elements ca, mg and cr, consistent withthose exhibited by the cluster. the complexity of the whole ngc1851cluster+halo system may agree with the scenario of a tidally-disrupted dwarfgalaxy in which ngc1851 was originally embedded.

1406.4375	strega: structure and evolution of the galaxy. i. survey overview and  first results	strega (structure and evolution of the galaxy) is a guaranteed time surveybeing performed at the vst (the eso vlt survey telescope) to map about 150square degrees in the galactic halo, in order to constrain the mechanisms ofgalactic formation and evolution. the survey is built as a five-year project,organized in two parts: a core program to explore the surrounding regions ofselected stellar systems and a second complementary part to map the southernportion of the fornax orbit and extend the observations of the core program.the adopted stellar tracers are mainly variable stars (rr~lyraes and longperiod variables) and main sequence turn-off stars for which observations inthe g,r,i bands are obtained. we present an overview of the survey and somepreliminary results for three observing runs that have been completed. for theregion centered on $\omega$~cen (37 deg^2), covering about three tidal radii,we also discuss the detected stellar density radial profile and angulardistribution, leading to the identification of extratidal cluster stars. wealso conclude that the cluster tidal radius is about 1.2 deg, in agreement withvalues in the literature based on the wilson model.

1406.6451	first detection of the white-dwarf cooling sequence of the galactic  bulge	we present hubble space telescope data of the low-reddening sagittariuswindow in the galactic bulge. the sagittarius window eclipsing extrasolarplanet search field (3'x3'), together with three more advanced camera forsurveys and eight wide field camera 3 fields, were observed in the f606w andf814w filters, approximately every two weeks for two years, with the principalaim of detecting a hidden population of isolated black holes and neutron starsthrough astrometric microlensing. proper motions were measured with an accuracyof ~0.1 mas/yr (~4 km/s) at f606w~25.5 mag, and better than ~0.5 mas/yr (20km/s) at f606w~28 mag, in both axes. proper-motion measurements allowed us toseparate disk and bulge stars and obtain a clean bulge color-magnitude diagram.we then identified for the first time a white dwarf (wd) cooling sequence inthe galactic bulge, together with a dozen candidate extreme horizontal branchstars. the comparison between theory and observations shows that a substantialfraction of the wds (30%) are systematically redder than the cooling tracks forco-core h-rich and he-rich envelope wds. this evidence would suggest thepresence of a significant number of low-mass wds and wd - main sequencebinaries in the bulge. this hypothesis is further supported by the finding oftwo dwarf novae in outburst, two short-period (p &lt; 1 d) ellipsoidal variables,and a few candidate cataclysmic variables in the same field.

1408.5753	a bag of tricks: using proper motions of galactic stars to identify the  hercules ultra-faint dwarf galaxy members	hercules is the prototype of the ultra-faint dwarf (ufd) galaxies. to date,there are still no firm constraints on its total luminosity, due to thedifficulty of disentangling hercules bona-fide stars from the severe galacticfield contamination. in order to better constrain hercules properties we aim atremoving foreground and background contaminants in the galaxy field using theproper motions of the milky way stars and the colour-colour diagram. we haveobtained images of hercules in the rsloan, bbessel and uspec bands with thelarge binocular telescope (lbt) and lbc-bin mode capabilities. the rsloan newdata-set combined with data from the lbt archive span a time baseline of about5 yr, allowing us to measure for the first time proper motions of stars in thehercules direction. the uspec data along with existing lbt photometry allowedus to use colour-colour diagram to further remove the field contamination.thanks to a highly-accurate procedure to derive the rsloan-filter geometricdistortion solution for the lbc-red, we were able to measure stellar relativeproper motions to a precision of better than 5 mas yr^-1 down to rsloan=22 magand disentangle a significant fraction (\&gt;90\%) of milky way contaminants. weended up with a sample of 528 sources distributed over a large portion of thegalaxy body (0.12 deg^2). of these sources, 171 turned out to be backgroundgalaxies and additional foreground stars, from the analysis of the uspec -bbessel vs. bbessel - rsloan colour-colour diagram. this leaves us with asample of 357 likely members of the hercules ufd. we compared the cleanedcolour-magnitude diagram (cmd) with evolutionary models and synthetic cmds,confirming the presence in hercules of an old population (t=12\pm 2 gyr), witha wide spread in metallicity (-3.3\&lt;[fe/h]\&lt;-1.8).

1409.5247	a state-of-the-art analysis of the dwarf irregular galaxy ngc 6822	we present a detailed photometric study of the dwarf irregular galaxy ngc6822 aimed at investigating the properties of its stellar populations and, inparticular, the presence of stellar radial gradients. our goal is to analysethe stellar populations in six fields, which cover the whole bar of this dwarfgalaxy. we derived the quantitative star formation history (sfh) of the sixfields using the iac method, involving iac-pop/minniac codes. the solutions wederived show an enhanced star formation rate (sfr) in fields 1 and 3 during thepast 500 myr. the sfrs of the other fields are almost extinguished at veryrecent epochs and. we study the radial gradients of the sfr and consider thetotal mass converted into stars in two time intervals (between 0 and 0.5 gyrago and between 0.5 and 13.5 gyr ago). we find that the scale lengths of theyoung and intermediate-to-old populations are perfectly compatible, with theexception of the young populations in fields 1 and 3. the recent sf in thesetwo fields is greater than in the other ones. this might be an indication thatin these two fields we are sampling incipient spiral arms. further evidence andnew observations are required to prove this hypothesis. in addition, we derivedthe age-metallicity relations. as expected, the metallicity increases with timefor all of the fields. we do not observe any radial gradient in themetallicity.

1410.2124	the carina project vii: towards the breaking of the age-metallicity  degeneracy of red giant branch stars using the c_ubi index	we present an analysis of photometric and spectroscopic data of the carinadsph galaxy, testing a new approach similar to that used to disentanglemultiple populations in galactic globular clusters (gcs). we show that a propercolour combination is able to separate a significant fraction of the red giantbranch (rgb) of the two main carina populations (the old one, \sim 12 gyr, andthe intermediate-age one, 4-8 gyr). in particular, the c_ubi=(u-b)-(b-i)pseudo-colour allows us to follow the rgb of both populations along a relevantportion of the rgb. we find that the oldest stars have more negative c_ubipseudo-colour than intermediate-age ones. we correlate the pseudo-colour of rgbstars with their chemical properties, finding a significant trend between theiron content and the c_ubi. stars belonging to the old population aresystematically more metal poor ([fe/h]=-2.32\pm0.08 dex) than theintermediate-age ones ([fe/h]=-1.82\pm0.03 dex). this gives solid evidence onthe chemical evolution history of this galaxy, and we have a new diagnosticthat can allow us to break the age-metallicity degeneracy of h-burning advancedevolutionary phases. we compared the distribution of stars in the c_ubi planewith theoretical isochrones, finding that no satisfactory agreement can bereached with models developed in a theoretical framework based on standardheavy element distributions. finally, we discuss possible systematicdifferences when compared with multiple populations in gcs.

1410.5460	new nir light-curve templates for classical cepheids	we present new near-infrared (nir) light-curve templates for fundamental (fu,jhk) and first overtone (fo, j) cepheids. the new templates together with pland pw relations provide cepheid distances from single-epoch observations witha precision only limited by the intrinsic accuracy of the method adopted. thetemplates rely on a very large set of galactic and magellanic clouds (mcs)cepheids (fu,~600; fo,~200) with well sampled nir (irsf data) and optical (v,i;ogle data) light curves. to properly trace the change in the shape of the lightcurve as a function of period, we split the sample of calibrating cepheids into10 different period bins. the templates for the first time cover fo cepheidsand the fu short-period cepheids (p&lt;5 days). moreover, the zero-point phase isanchored to the phase of the mean magnitude along the rising branch. the newapproach has several advantages in sampling the light curve of bump cepheidswhen compared with the phase of maximum light. we also provide new estimates ofthe nir-to-optical amplitude ratios for fu and fo cepheids. we perform detailedanalytical fits using both 7th-order fourier series and multi-gaussian periodicfunctions. the latter are characterized by a smaller number of free parameters(9 vs 15). mean nir magnitudes based on the new templates are up to 80% moreaccurate than single-epoch measurements and up to 50% more accurate than meanmagnitudes based on previous templates, with typical associated uncertaintiesranging from 0.015 mag (j) to 0.019 mag (k). moreover, the errors on individualdistances of small mc cepheids derived from nir pw relations, are essentiallyreduced to the intrinsic scatter of the adopted relations. thus, the newtemplates are the ultimate tool to estimate precise cepheid distances from nirsingle-epoch observations, which can be adopted to derive the 3d structure ofthe mcs.

1411.6826	on the distance of the globular cluster m4 (ngc 6121) using rr lyrae  stars: i. optical and near-infrared period-luminosity and period-wesenheit  relations	we present new distance determinations to the nearby globular m4 (ngc~6121)based on accurate optical and near infrared (nir) mean magnitudes forfundamental (fu) and first overtone (fo) rr lyrae variables (rrls), and newempirical optical and nir period-luminosity (pl) and period-wesenheit (pw)relations. we have found that optical-nir and nir pl and pw relations areaffected by smaller standard deviations than optical relations. the differenceis the consequence of a steady decrease in the intrinsic spread of cluster rrlapparent magnitudes at fixed period as longer wavelengths are considered. theweighted mean visual apparent magnitude of 44 cluster rrls is$\left&lt;v\right&gt;=13.329\pm0.001$ (standard error of the mean) $\pm$0.177(weighted standard deviation) mag. distances were estimated using rr lyr itselfto fix the zero-point of the empirical pl and pw relations. using the entiresample (fu$+$fo) we found weighted mean true distance moduli of11.35$\pm$0.03$\pm$0.05 mag and 11.32$\pm$0.02$\pm$0.07 mag. distances werealso evaluated using predicted metallicity dependent plz and pwz relations. wefound weighted mean true distance moduli of 11.283$\pm$0.010$\pm$0.018 mag (nirplz) and 11.272$\pm$0.005$\pm$0.019 mag (optical--nir and nir pwz). the aboveweighted mean true distance moduli agree within 1$\sigma$. the same result isfound from distances based on pwz relations in which the color index isindependent of the adopted magnitude (11.272$\pm$0.004$\pm$0.013 mag). thesedistances agree quite well with the geometric distance provided by\citep{kaluzny2013} based on three eclipsing binaries. the available evidenceindicates that this approach can provide distances to globulars hosting rrlswith a precision better than 2--3\%.

1503.03758	on the alpha-element gradients of the galactic thin disk using cepheids	we present new homogeneous measurements of na, al and three alpha-elements(mg, si, ca) for 75 galactic cepheids. the abundances are based on highspectral resolution (r ~ 38,000) and high signal-to-noise ratio (s/n ~ 50-300)spectra collected with uves at eso vlt. the current measurements werecomplemented with cepheid abundances either provided by our group (75) oravailable in the literature, for a total of 439 galactic cepheids. specialattention was given in providing a homogeneous abundance scale for these fiveelements plus iron (genovali et al. 2013, 2014). in addition, accurategalactocentric distances (rg) based on near-infrared photometry are alsoavailable for all the cepheids in the sample (genovali et al. 2014). they covera large fraction of the galactic thin disk (4.1 &lt;= rg &lt;= 18.4 kpc). we foundthat the above five elements display well defined linear radial gradients andmodest standard deviations over the entire range of rg. moreover, the[element/fe] abundance ratios are constant across the entire thin disk; onlythe ca radial distribution shows marginal evidence of a positive slope. theseresults indicate that the chemical enrichment history of iron and of the quotedfive elements has been quite similar across the four quadrants of the galacticthin disk. the [element/fe] ratios are also constant over the entire periodrange. this empirical evidence indicates that the chemical enrichment ofgalactic cepheids has also been very homogenous during the range in age thatthey cover (~10-300 myr). once again, [ca/fe] vs. log(p) shows a (negative)gradient, being underabundant among youngest cepheids. finally, we also foundthat cepheid abundances agree quite well with similar abundances for thin andthick disk dwarf stars and they follow the typical mg-al and na-o correlations.

1505.02531	on a new theoretical framework for rr lyrae stars i: the metallicity  dependence	we present new nonlinear, time-dependent convective hydrodynamical models ofrr lyrae stars computed assuming a constant helium-to-metal enrichment ratioand a broad range in metal abundances (z=0.0001--0.02). the stellar masses andluminosities adopted to construct the pulsation models were fixed according todetailed central he burning horizontal branch evolutionary models. thepulsation models cover a broad range in stellar luminosity and effectivetemperatures and the modal stability is investigated for both fundamental andfirst overtones. we predict the topology of the instability strip as a functionof the metal content and new analytical relations for the edges of theinstability strip in the observational plane. moreover, a new analyticalrelation to constrain the pulsation mass of double pulsators as a function ofthe period ratio and the metal content is provided. we derive newperiod-radius-metallicity relations for fundamental and first-overtonepulsators. they agree quite well with similar empirical and theoreticalrelations in the literature. from the predicted bolometric light curves,transformed into optical (ubvri) and near-infrared (jhk) bands, we compute theintensity-averaged mean magnitudes along the entire pulsation cycle and, inturn, new and homogenous metal-dependent (rijhk) period-luminosity relations.moreover, we compute new dual and triple band optical, optical--nir and nirperiod-wesenheit-metallicity relations. interestingly, we find that the opticalperiod-w(v,b-v) is independent of the metal content and that the accuracy ofindividual distances is a balance between the adopted diagnostics and theprecision of photometric and spectroscopic datasets.

1505.06597	the carina project. viii. the {\alpha}-element abundances	we have performed a new abundance analysis of carina red giant (rg) starsfrom spectroscopic data collected with uves (high resolution) andflames/giraffe (high and medium resolution) at eso/vlt. the former sampleincludes 44 rgs, while the latter consists of 65 (high) and ~800 (mediumresolution) rgs, covering a significant fraction of the galaxy's rg branch(rgb), and red clump stars. to improve the abundance analysis at the faintmagnitude limit, the flames/giraffe data were divided into ten surface gravityand effective temperature bins. the spectra of the stars belonging to the samegravity/temperature bin were stacked. this approach allowed us to increase byat least a factor of five the signal-to-noise ratio in the faint limit(v&gt;20.5mag). we took advantage of the new photometry index cu,b,i introduced bymonelli et al. (2014), as an age and probably a metallicity indicator, to splitstars along the rgb. these two stellar populations display distinct [fe/h] and[mg/h] distributions: their mean fe abundances are -2.15$\pm$0.06dex(sig=0.28), and -1.75$\pm$0.03dex (sig=0.21), respectively. the two irondistributions differ at the 75% level. this supports preliminary results bylemasle et al. (2012) and by monelli et al. (2014). moreover, we found that theold and intermediate-age stellar populations have mean [mg/h] abundances of-1.91$\pm$0.05dex (sig=0.22) and -1.35$\pm$0.03dex (sig=0.22); these differ atthe 83% level. carina's {\alpha}-element abundances agree, within 1sigma, withsimilar abundances for field halo stars and for cluster (galactic, magellanic)stars. the same outcome applies to nearby dwarf spheroidals and ultra-faintdwarf galaxies, in the iron range covered by carina stars. finally, we foundevidence of a clear correlation between na and o abundances, thus suggestingthat carina's chemical enrichment history is quite different than in theglobular clusters.

1505.07128	new insights on the galactic bulge initial mass function	we have derived the galactic bulge initial mass function of the sweeps fieldin the mass range 0.15 $&lt; m/m_{\odot}&lt;$ 1.0, using deep photometry collectedwith the advanced camera for surveys on the hubble space telescope.observations at several epochs, spread over 9 years, allowed us to separate thedisk and bulge stars down to very faint magnitudes, f814w $\sim$ 26 mag, with aproper-motion accuracy better than 0.5 mas/yr. this allowed us to determine theinitial mass function of the pure bulge component uncontaminated by disk starsfor this low-reddening field in the sagittarius window. in deriving the massfunction, we took into account the presence of unresolved binaries, errors inphotometry, distance modulus and reddening, as well as the metallicitydispersion and the uncertainties caused by adopting different theoreticalcolor-temperature relations. we found that the galactic bulge initial massfunction can be fitted with two power laws with a break at m $\sim$ 0.56$m_{\odot}$, the slope being steeper ($\alpha$ = -2.41$\pm$0.50) for the highermasses, and shallower ($\alpha$ = -1.25$\pm$0.20) for the lower masses. in thehigh-mass range, our derived mass function agrees well with the mass functionderived for other regions of the bulge. in the low-mass range however, our massfunction is slightly shallower, which suggests that separating the disk andbulge components is particularly important in the low-mass range. the slope ofthe bulge mass function is also similar to the slope of the mass functionderived for the disk in the high-mass regime, but the bulge mass function isslightly steeper in the low-mass regime. we used our new mass function toderive stellar m/l values for the galactic bulge and we obtained 2.1$&lt;m/l_{f814w}&lt;$ 2.4 and 3.1 $&lt; m/l_{f606w}&lt;$ 3.6 according to differentassumptions on the slope of the imf for masses larger than 1 $m_{\odot}$.

1509.02687	the carina project ix: on hydrogen and helium burning variables	we present new multi-band (ubvi) time-series data of helium burning variablesin the carina dwarf spheroidal galaxy. the current sample includes 92 rrlyrae-six of them are new identifications-and 20 anomalous cepheids, one ofwhich is new identification. the analysis of the bailey diagram shows that theluminosity amplitude of the first overtone component in double-mode variablesis located along the long-period tail of regular first overtone variables,while the fundamental component is located along the short-period tale ofregular fundamental variables. this evidence further supports the transitionalnature of these objects. moreover, the distribution of carina double-modevariables in the petersen diagram (p_1/p_0 vs p_0) is similar to metal-poorglobulars (m15, m68), to the dwarf spheroidal draco and to the galactic halo.this suggests that the carina old stellar population is metal-poor and affectedby a small spread in metallicity. we use trigonometric parallaxes for fivefield rr lyrae stars to provide an independent estimate of the carina distanceusing the observed reddening free period--wesenheit [pw, (bv)] relation. theoryand observations indicate that this diagnostic is independent of metallicity.we found a true distance modulus of \mu=20.01\pm0.02 (standard error of themean) \pm0.05 (standard deviation) mag. we also provided independent estimatesof the carina true distance modulus using four predicted pw relations (bv, bi,vi, bvi) and we found: \mu=(20.08\pm0.007\pm0.07) mag,\mu=(20.06\pm0.006\pm0.06) mag, \mu=(20.07\pm0.008\pm0.08) mag and\mu=(20.06\pm0.006\pm0.06) mag. finally, we identified more than 100 new sxphoenicis stars that together with those already known in the literature (340)make carina a fundamental laboratory to constrain the evolutionary andpulsation properties of these transitional variables.

1510.06314	on the neutron-capture elements across the galactic thin disk using  cepheids	we present new accurate abundances for five neutron-capture (y, la, ce, nd,eu) elements in 73 classical cepheids located across the galactic thin disk.individual abundances are based on high spectral resolution (r ~ 38,000) andhigh signal-to-noise ratio (s/n ~ 50-300) spectra collected with uves at esovlt for the dionysos project. taking account for similar cepheid abundancesprovided either by our group (111 stars) or available in the literature, we endup with a sample of 435 cepheids covering a broad range in iron abundances(-1.6 &lt; [fe/h] &lt; 0.6). we found, using homogeneous individual distances andabundance scales, well defined gradients for the above elements. however, theslope of the light s-process element (y) is at least a factor of two steeperthan the slopes of heavy s- (la, ce, nd) and r- (eu) process elements. the s tor abundance ratio ([la/eu]) of cepheids shows a well defined anticorrelationwith of both eu and fe. on the other hand, galactic field stars attain analmost constant value and only when they approach solar iron abundance displaya mild enhancement in la. the [y/eu] ratio shows a mild evidence of acorrelation with eu and, in particular, with iron abundance for field galacticstars. we also investigated the s-process index - [hs/ls] - and we found a welldefined anticorrelation, as expected, between [la/y] and iron abundance.moreover, we found a strong correlation between [la/y] and [la/fe] and, inparticular, a clear separation between galactic and sagittarius red giants.finally, the comparison between predictions for low-mass asymptotic giantbranch stars and the observed [la/y] ratio indicate a very good agreement overthe entire metallicity range covered by cepheids. however, the observed spread,at fixed iron content, is larger than predicted by current models.

astro-ph;0103354	vlt observations of the peculiar globular cluster ngc 6712, ii:  luminosity and mass functions	we have carried out extensive vlt-fors1 observations covering a fair fractionof the intermediate metallicity globular cluster ngc 6712 in the v and r bands.we derive accurate colour-magnitude diagrammes (cmd) and luminosity functions(lfs) of the cluster main sequence (ms) for four overlapping fields extendingfrom the centre of the cluster out to a radius of ~10', well beyond the nominaltidal radius, and for a control field at ~42' distance. the lfs extend from thecluster turn-off (to) at m_r 4 to the point at which the incompleteness dropsbelow 50% (corresponding to r 23 or m_r 7.5) for most fields studied. clusterstars become indistinguishable from field stars at r 5'. the shape of thecluster's lf and its variation with distance from the centre in these rangesare well described by a standard multi-mass static model having the followingparameters: core radius r_c=1', half-light radius r_hl=1.8', tidal radiusr_t=5.2', concentration ratio c=0.7, and a power-law global mass function (mf)with index alpha 0.9 for masses smaller than 0.8 msolar, i.e. for all detectedms stars, and alpha -2.35 for evolved objects. the mf obtained in this way isconsistent with that found in a preliminary investigation of this cluster withthe vlt test camera and confirms that this is the only globular cluster knownso far for which the global mf drops with decreasing mass below the to.possible reasons for this unique characteristic are discussed with the mostlikely associated with its extreme vulnerability to tidal disruption.

astro-ph;0111083	mass segregation of different populations inside the cluster ngc6101	we have used eso telescopes at la silla and the hubble space telescope (hst)in order to obtain accurate b,v,i ccd photometry for the stars located within200" (~= 2 half-mass radii, r_h = 1.71') from the center of the cluster ngc6101. color-magnitude diagrams extending from the red-giant tip to about 5magnitudes below the main-sequence turnoff msto (v = 20.05 +- 0.05) have beenconstructed.  the following results have been obtained from the analysis of the cmds: a)the overall morphology of the main branches confirms previous results from theliterature, in particular the existence of a sizeable population of 73 "bluestragglers", which had been already partly detected (27).they are considerablymore concentrated than either the subgiant branch or the main sequence stars,and have the same spatial distribution as the horizontal branch stars (84%prob. from k-s test). an hypothesis on the possible bss progeny is alsopresented. b) the hb is narrow and the bulk of stars is blue, as expected for atypical metal-poor globular cluster. c) the derived magnitudes for the hb andthe msto, $v(zahb) = 16.59+-0.10, v(to) = 20.05+-0.05, coupled with the valuese(b-v) = 0.1, [fe/h] = -1.80, y = 0.23 yield a distance modulus (m-m)_v = 16.23and an age similar to other ``old'' metal-poor globular clusters. inparticular, from the comparison with theoretical isochrones, we derive for thiscluster an age of 13 gyrs. d) by using the large statistical sample of redgiant branch (rgb) stars, we detected with high accuracy the position of thebump in the rgb luminosity function. this observational feature has beencompared with theoretical prescriptions, yielding a good agreement within thecurrent theoretical and observational uncertainties.

astro-ph;0112064	on the primordial helium content: cmb and stellar constraints	we present the results of a joint investigation aimed at constraining theprimordial he content ($y_p$) on the basis of both the cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) anisotropy and two stellar observables, namely the tip of thered giant branch (trgb) and the luminosity of the zero age horizontal branch(zahb). current baryon density estimates based on cmb measurements cover a widerange values $0.009\la \omega_bh^2 \la 0.045$, that according to big bangnucleosynthesis (bbn) models would imply $0.24\la y_p \la 0.26$. we constructedseveral sets of evolutionary tracks and hb models by adopting $y_p=0.26$ andseveral metal contents. the comparison between theory and observations suggeststhat zahb magnitudes based on he-enhanced models are 1.5$\sigma$ brighter thanthe empirical ones. the same outcome applies for the trgb bolometricmagnitudes. this finding somewhat supports a $y_p$ abundance close to thecanonical 0.23-0.24 value. more quantitative constraints on this parameter arehampered by the fact that the cmb pattern shows a sizable dependence on both$y_p$ and the baryon density only at small angular scales, i.e. at high l inthe power spectrum ($l\ga 100$). however, this region of the power spectrumcould be still affected by deceptive systematic uncertainties. finally, wesuggest to use the {\em uv-upturn} to estimate the he content on gpc scales. infact, we find that a strong increase in $y_p$ causes in metal-poor, hot hbstructures a decrease in the uv emission.

astro-ph;0502585	on the anomalous red giant branch of the globular cluster omega cen	we present three different optical and near-infrared (nir) data sets forevolved stars in the galactic globular cluster omega cen the comparison betweenobservations and homogeneous sets of stellar isochrones and zero-age horizontalbranches provides two reasonable fits. both of them suggest that the so-calledanomalous branch has a metal-intermediate chemical composition (-1.1 &lt; [fe/h] &lt;-0.8) and is located ~500 pc beyond the bulk of omega cen stars. these findingsare mainly supported by the shape of the subgiant branch in four differentcolor-magnitude diagrams (cmds). the most plausible fit requires a higherreddening, e(b-v)=0.155 vs. 0.12, and suggests that the anomalous branch iscoeval, within empirical and theoretical uncertainties, to the bulk of omegacen stellar populations. this result is supported by the identification of asample of faint horizontal branch stars that might be connected with theanomalous branch. circumstantial empirical evidence seems to suggest that thestars in this branch form a clump of stars located beyond the cluster.

astro-ph;0505252	on the horizontal branch of the galactic globular ngc2808	we present new uv (f218w) data for stars in the central region of thegalactic globular cluster ngc2808, collected with the wfpc2 camera on board ofthe hubble space telescope. these data together with f439w and f555w-band dataand previous ground based observations provide a multifrequency coverage of thecluster stellar population extending up to a distance of 1.7 times the clustercore radius. we discuss this complete sample of stars, which includes 764 redgiant branch (rgb) stars brighter than the horizontal branch (hb) luminositylevel, 1239 hb stars, 119 asymptotic giant branch (agb), and 22 agb-manque'stellar structures. as already known, we find that blue hb stars separate intothree distinct groups. however, our multiband photometry indicates that severalstars in the two hotter hb groups show a flat spectrum, thus suggesting thebinarity of these objects. artificial star experiments suggest that at most 50%of them might be photometric blends. moreover, at variance with previous claimsone finds that canonical zero age horizontal branch (zahb) models do reacheffective temperatures typical of observed hot hb stars. we also show that theratio between hb and rgb stars brighter than the hb luminosity level steadlyincreases when moving from the cluster center to the periphery, passing fromr=1.37 +/- 0.14 in the cluster core to r=1.95 +/- 0.26 in the outer clusterregions. we discuss the possible origin of such a radial gradient in thecontext of the blue tails phenomenon, advancing some suggestions concerning theclumpy stellar distribution along the hb.

astro-ph;0612125	the exotic chemical composition of the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal  galaxy	the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy is the nearest neighbor of the milkyway. moving along a short period quasi-polar orbit within the halo, it is beingdestroyed by the tidal interaction with our galaxy, losing its stellar contentalong a huge stellar stream. we study the detailed chemical composition of 12giant stars in the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal main body, together with 5 morein the associated globular cluster terzan 7 by means of high resolutionvlt-uves spectra. abundances are derived for up to 21 elements from o to nd, byfitting lines ew or line profiles against atlas 9 model atmospheres and synthespectral syntheses calculated ad-hoc. temperatures are derived from (v-i)_0 or(b-v)_0 colors, gravities from fe i - fe ii ionization equilibrium. themetallicity of the observed stars is between [fe/h]=-0.9 and 0. we detected ahighly peculiar ``chemical signature'', with undersolar alpha elements, na, al,sc, v, co, ni, cu and zn among others, and overabundant la, ce and nd. many ofthese abundance ratios (in particular light-odd elements and iron peak ones)are strongly at odds with what is observed within the milky way, they thus maybe a very useful tool to recognize populations originated within thesagittarius dwarf. this can be clearly seen in the case of the globular palomar12, which is believed to have been stripped from sagittarius: the cluster showsprecisely the same chemical ``oddities'', thus finally confirming itsextragalactic origin.

(1994) which takes into account both starcollisions and merging of primordial binaries for the origin of bss. theobserved luminosity functions of bss in the inner and outer parts of thecluster are different. interpreting these using the models of bailyn &amp;pinsonneault (1995), we suggest that the bss in the inner cluster are formed bystellar collisions and those in the outer cluster from merging primordialbinaries.

astro-ph;9907073	hst photometry of the fornax dsph galaxy: cluster 4 and its field	using observations from the hubble space telescope archive, color-magnitudediagrams (cmds) have been constructed for globular cluster 4 in the fornax dsphgalaxy and its surrounding field. these diagrams extend below the main-sequenceturnoffs and have yielded measurements of the ages of the populations.  the most prominent features of the cmd of the fornax field population are aheavily populated red clump of horizontal branch (hb) stars, a broad red giantbranch (rgb), and a main sequence that spans a large range in luminosity. inthis cmd, there are very few stars at the positions of the hbs of the fiveglobular clusters in fornax, which suggests that only a very small fraction ofthe field population resembles the clusters in age and chemical composition.the large span in luminosity of the main-sequence suggests that star formationbegan in the field about 12 gyrs ago and continued to about 0.5 gyr ago. thereare separate subgiant branches in the cmd, which indicate that the starformation was not continuous but occurred in bursts. the cmd of cluster 4 has asteep rgb, from which we estimate [fe/h] around -2.0. this is considerablylower than estimates from the integrated light of the cluster, and the originsof this discrepancy are discussed.
