0902.2403	near-ir galaxy counts and evolution from the wide-field alhambra survey	the alhambra survey aims to cover 4 square degrees using a system of 20contiguous, equal width, medium-band filters spanning the range 3500 a to 9700a plus the standard jhks filters. here we analyze deep near-ir number counts ofone of our fields (alh08) for which we have a relatively large area (0.5 squaredegrees) and faint photometry (j=22.4, h=21.3 and k=20.0 at the 50% of recoveryefficiency for point-like sources). we find that the logarithmic gradient ofthe galaxy counts undergoes a distinct change to a flatter slope in each band:from 0.44 at [17.0, 18.5] to 0.34 at [19.5, 22.0] for the j band; for the hband 0.46 at [15.5, 18.0] to 0.36 at [19.0, 21.0], and in ks the change is from0.53 in the range [15.0, 17.0] to 0.33 in the interval [18.0, 20.0]. theseobservations together with faint optical counts are used to constrain modelsthat include density and luminosity evolution of the local type-dependentluminosity functions. our models imply a decline in the space density ofevolved early-type galaxies with increasing redshift, such that only 30% - 50%of the bulk of the present day red-ellipticals was already in place at z~1.

0905.2973	an x-ray view of 82 liners with chandra and xmm-newton data	we present the results of an homogeneous x-ray analysis for 82 nearby linersselected from the catalogue of carrillo et al. (1999). all sources haveavailable chandra (68 sources) and/or xmm-newton (55 sources) observations.this is the largest sample of liners with x-ray spectral data (60 out of the 82objects) and significantly improves our previous analysis based on chandra datafor 51 liners (gonzalez-martin et al. 2006). it increases both the sample sizeand adds xmm-newton data. new models permit the inclusion of double absorbersin the spectral fits. nuclear x-ray morphology is inferred from the compactnessof detected nuclear sources in the hard band (4.5-8.0 kev). sixty per cent ofthe sample shows a compact nuclear source and are classified as agn candidates.the spectral analysis indicates that best fits involve a composite model:absorbed primary continuum and (2) soft spectrum below 2 kev described by anabsorbed scatterer and/or a thermal component. the resulting median spectraparameters and their standard deviations are: g=2.11, &lt;kt&gt;=0.54 kev,&lt;log(nh1)&gt;=21.32 and &lt;log(nh2)&gt;=21.93. we complement our x-ray results with ouranalysis of hst optical images and literature data on emission lines, radiocompactness and stellar population. adding all these multiwavelength data, weconclude that evidence do exist supporting the agn nature of their nuclearengine for 80% of the sample (66 out of 82 objects).

0909.4082	fitting liner nuclei within the agn family: a matter of obscuration?	in this paper we study the nuclear obscuration of galaxies hosting linersbased on their x-ray and optical emission. they show column densities (n_h) atsoft energies (0.5-2 kev) mostly related to the diffuse emission around theagn, showing a correlation with the optical extinction. n_h at hard energies(2-10 kev) seem to be much higher than what would be expected from the opticalextinction. they might be associated to the inner regions of the agn, buried atoptical wavelengths. the main result of this paper is that around 50% of ourliner sample shows signatures of compton-thickness (ct) according to the mostcommon tracers: the x-ray spectral index, f(2-10 kev)/f([oiii]) ratio andew(feka). however, the ews of ct liners are significantly lower than in ct sy,suggesting that the 2-10 kev emission is dominated by electron scattering ofthe otherwise invisible agn, or by emission from shocked gas associated to starformation rather than by reflection from the inner wall of the torus. however,no clear relation seems to exist between galaxies with optical dust lanes andx-ray classified ct objects. this may suggest that ct sources should be relatedto absorbing material located at the very inner regions of the agn, maybe inthe putative dusty torus. larger m_bh and lower eddington ratios than sygalaxies have been found. this effect can be better attributed to liner nucleibeing hosted by earlier morphological types than sy nuclei. however, it has tobe noted that, once a proper correction to the x-ray luminosity is applied,liners show eddington ratios overlapping those of sy 2. we speculate with apossible scenario for liner nuclei: an inner obscuring matter similar to thatof sy 2, and an external obscuring matter responsible for the opticalextinction. ct sources appear to be more common among liners than sy.

1008.1753	herschel fir counterparts of selected ly-alpha emitters at z~2.2. fast  evolution since z~3 or missed obscured agns?	ly-alpha emitters (laes) are seen everywhere in the redshift domain fromlocal to z~7. far-infrared (fir) counterparts of laes at different epochs couldprovide direct clues on dust content, extinction, and spectral energydistribution (sed) for these galaxies. we search for fir counterparts of laesthat are optically detected in the goods-north field at redshift z~2.2 usingdata from the herschel space telescope with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs). the lae candidates were isolated via color-magnitudediagram using the medium-band photometry from the alhambra survey, ancillarydata on goods-north, and stellar population models. according to the fitting ofthese spectral synthesis models and fir/optical diagnostics, most of them seemto be obscured galaxies whose spectra are agn-dominated. from the analysis ofthe optical data, we have observed a fraction of agn or composite over sourcetotal number of ~0.75 in the lae population at z~2.2, which is marginallyconsistent with the fraction previously observed at z=2.25 and even at lowredshift (0.2&lt;z&lt;0.45), but significantly different from the one observed atredshift ~3, which could be compatible either with a scenario of rapid changein the agn fraction between the epochs involved or with a non detection ofobscured agn in other z=2-3 lae samples due to lack of deep fir observations.we found three robust fir (pacs) counterparts at z~2.2 in goods-north. thisdemonstrates the possibility of finding dust emission in laes even at higherredshifts.

1011.0865	the nature of nuclear halpha emission in liners	to get insight in the nature of the ionized gas in the nuclear region ofliners we have performed a study of hst halpha imaging of 32 liners. the mainconclusion from this analysis is that for the large majority of liners (84%) anunresolved nuclear source has been identified as well as extended emission withequivalent sizes ranging from few tens till about hundredths of parsecs. theirmorphologies appear not to be homogeneous being basically grouped into threeclasses:nuclear outflow candidates (42%), core-halo morphologies (25%) andnuclear spiral disks (14%). clumpy structures reminiscent of young stellarclusters are not a common property on liners. the remaining 5 galaxies are toodusty to allow a clear view of the ionized gas distribution. a size-luminosityrelation has been found between the equivalent radius of the halpha emissionand the (2-10 kev) x-ray luminosities. both ionised gas morphologies and thesize-luminosity relation are indistinguishable from those of low luminosityseyferts, suggesting the same origin for the nlr of liners and seyferts. also arelation between soft x-rays and ionized gas has been suggested for the firsttime in liners. from multiwavelength data, only 4 out of the 32 liners have noevidences on an agn nature of theirnuclear sources from multiwavelength data,but extremely obscured agns cannot be discarded out given the compton thicksignatures of their x-ray emission. for the confirmed agn liners, their halphaimaging favour core-halo and outflow morphologies (65% of the cases). finally,their calculated eddington ratios show that our liner sources radiate atsub-eddington regime, with core-halo systems having on average larger eddingtonratios than outflow candidates.

1012.3080	suzaku observation of the liner ngc 4102	low ionisation nuclear emission-line region (liner) nuclei have been claimedto be different than other active galactic nuclei (agn) due to the presence ofcomplex absorbing structures along the line-of-sight and/or an inefficient modeof accretion onto the supermassive black hole. however, this issue is stillopen. we have investigated the broad band x-ray spectrum of ngc 4102, one ofthe most luminous liners in the swift/bat survey. we studied a 80 ksec suzakuspectrum of ngc 4102, together with archival chandra and swift/batobservations. we also studied the optical (3.5m/twin at calar alto observatory)and near-infrared (wht/liris at observatorio roque los muchachos) spectra thatwere taken contemporaneous to the suzaku data. there is strong evidence thatngc 4102 is a compton-thick agn, as suggested by the swift/bat detectedintrinsic continuum and the presence of a strong narrow, neutral feka emissionline. we have also detected ionised fexxv emission lines in the suzaku spectrumof the source. ngc 4102 shows a variable soft excess found at a significantlyhigher flux state by the time of suzaku observations when compared to chandraobservations. finally, a complex structure of absorbers is seen with at leasttwo absorbers apart from the compton-thick one, derived from the x-ray spectralanalysis and the optical extinction.

1111.0962	califa, the calar alto legacy integral field area survey: i. survey  presentation	we present here the calar alto legacy integral field area (califa) survey,which has been designed to provide a first step in this direction.we summarizethe survey goals and design, including sample selection and observationalstrategy.we also showcase the data taken during the first observing runs(june/july 2010) and outline the reduction pipeline, quality control schemesand general characteristics of the reduced data. this survey is obtainingspatially resolved spectroscopic information of a diameter selected sample of$\sim600$ galaxies in the local universe (0.005&lt; z &lt;0.03). califa has beendesigned to allow the building of two-dimensional maps of the followingquantities: (a) stellar populations: ages and metallicities; (b) ionized gas:distribution, excitation mechanism and chemical abundances; and (c) kinematicproperties: both from stellar and ionized gas components. califa uses the ppakintegral field unit (ifu), with a hexagonal field-of-view of$\sim1.3\sq\arcmin'$, with a 100% covering factor by adopting a three-pointingdithering scheme. the optical wavelength range is covered from 3700 to 7000{\aa}, using two overlapping setups (v500 and v1200), with differentresolutions: r\sim850 and r\sim1650, respectively. califa is a legacy survey,intended for the community. the reduced data will be released, once the qualityhas been guaranteed. the analyzed data fulfill the expectations of the originalobserving proposal, on the basis of a set of quality checks and exploratoryanalysis.  we conclude from this first look at the data that califa will be an importantresource for archaeological studies of galaxies in the local universe.

1202.0511	the ionized gas in the califa early-type galaxies i. mapping two  representative cases: ngc 6762 and ngc 5966	as part of the califa survey, we conducted a thorough 2d analysis of theionized gas in two e/s0 galaxies, ngc6762 and ngc5966, aiming to shed light onthe nature of their warm ionized ism. we present optical ifs obtained with thepmas/ppak spectrophotometer. to recover the nebular lines, we subtracted theunderlying stellar continuum from the observed spectra using the starlightcode. in ngc6762, the ionized gas and stellar emission display similarmorphologies, while the emission line morphology is elongated in ngc5966,spanning ~6 kpc, and is oriented roughly orthogonal to the major axis of thestellar continuum ellipsoid. whereas gas and stars are kinematically aligned inngc6762, the gas is kinematically decoupled from the stars in ngc5966. adecoupled rotating disk or an ionization cone are two possible interpretationsof the elongated ionized gas structure in ngc5966. the latter would be thefirst ionization cone of such a dimension detected within a weak emission-linegalaxy. both galaxies have weak emission-lines relative to the continuum[ew(ha)&lt; 3 a] and have low excitation, log([oiii]5007/hb) &lt; 0.5. based onoptical diagnostic ratios([oiii]5007/hb,[nii]6584/ha,[sii]6717,6731/ha,[oi]6300/ha), both objectscontain a liner nucleus and an extended liner-like gas emission. the emissionline ratios do not vary significantly with radius or aperture, which indicatesthat the nebular properties are spatially homogeneous. the gas emission inngc6762 can be best explained by photoionization by pagb stars without the needof invoking any other excitation mechanism. in the case of ngc5966, thepresence of a nuclear ionizing source seems to be required to shape theelongated gas emission feature in the ionization cone scenario, althoughionization by pagb stars cannot be ruled out.(abridged)

1202.3397	quasi-stellar objects in the alhambra survey. i. photometric redshift  accuracy based on a 23 optical-nir filter photometry	we characterize the ability of the alhambra survey to assign accuratephoto-z's to blagn and qsos based on their alhambra very-low-resolutionoptical-nir spectroscopy. a sample of 170 spectroscopically identified blagnand qsos have been used together with a library of templates (including sedsfrom agn, normal, starburst galaxies and stars) in order to fit the 23photometric data points provided by alhambra in the optical and nir (20medium-band optical filters plus the standard jhks). we find that the alhambraphotometry is able to provide an accurate photo-z and spectral classificationfor ~88% of the spectroscopic sources over 2.5 deg^2 in different areas of thesurvey, all of them brighter than m678=23.5 (equivalent to r(sloan)~24.0). thederived photo-z accuracy is better than 1% and comparable to the most recentresults in other cosmological fields. the fraction of outliers (~12%) is mainlycaused by the larger photometric errors for the faintest sources and theintrinsic variability of the blagn/qso population. a small fraction of outliersmay have an incorrectly assigned spectroscopic redshift. the definition of thealhambra survey in terms of the number of filters, filter properties, areacoverage and depth is able to provide photometric redshifts for blagn/qsos witha precision similar to any previous survey that makes use of medium-bandoptical photometry. in agreement with previous literature results, our analysisalso reveals that, in the 0&lt;z&lt;4 redshift interval, very accurate photo-z can beobtained without the use of near-ir broadband photometry at the expense of aslight increase of outliers. the nir importance is expected to increase athigher redshifts (z&gt;4). these results are relevant for the design of futureoptical follow-ups of surveys with a large fraction of blagn, as it is the casefor x-rays or radio surveys.

1305.2225	x-ray spectral variability of seven liner nuclei with xmm-newton and  chandra data	one of the most important features in active galactic nuclei (agn) is thevariability of their emission. variability has been discovered at x-ray, uv,and radio frequencies on time scales from hours to years. among the agn familyand according to theoretical studies, low-ionization nuclear emission lineregion (liner) nuclei would be variable objects on long time scales. ourpurpose is to investigate spectral x-ray variability in liners and tounderstand the nature of these kinds of objects, as well as their accretionmechanism. chandra and xmm-newton public archives were used to compile x-rayspectra of seven liner nuclei at different epochs with time scales of years. tosearch for variability we fit all the spectra from the same object with a setof models, in order to identify the parameters responsible for the variabilitypattern. we also analyzed the light curves in order to search for short timescale (from hours to days) variability. whenever possible, uv variability wasalso studied. we found spectral variability in four objects, with variationsmostly related to hard energies (2-10 kev). these variations are due to changesin the soft excess, and/or changes in the absorber, and/or intrinsic variationsof the source. another two galaxies seem not to vary. short time scalevariations during individual observations were not found. our analysis confirmsthe previously reported anticorrelation between the x-ray spectral index andthe eddington ratio, and also the correlation between the x-ray to uv fluxratio and the eddington ratio. these results support an advection dominatedaccretion flow (adaf) as the accretion mechanism in liners.

1306.1121	lyman break and uv-selected galaxies at z ~ 1: ii. pacs-100um/160um fir  detections	we report the pacs-100um/160um detections of a sample of 42 galex-selectedand fir-detected lyman break galaxies (lbgs) at z ~ 1 located in the cosmosfield and analyze their ultra-violet (uv) to far-infrared (fir) properties. thedetection of these lbgs in the fir indicates that they have a dust content highenough so that its emission can be directly detected. according to a spectralenergy distribution (sed) fitting with stellar population templates to theiruv-to-near-ir observed photometry, pacs-detected lbgs tend to be bigger, moremassive, dustier, redder in the uv continuum, and uv-brighter thanpacs-undetected lbgs. pacs-detected lbgs at z ~ 1 are mostly disk-like galaxiesand are located over the green-valley and red sequence of the color-magnitudediagram of galaxies at their redshift. by using their uv and ir emission, wefind that pacs-detected lbgs tend to be less dusty and have slightly highertotal star-formation rates (sfrs) than other pacs-detected uv-selected galaxieswithin their same redshift range. as a consequence of the selection effect dueto the depth of the fir observations employed, all our pacs-detected lbgs arelirgs. however, none of them are in the ulirg regime, where the firobservations are complete. the finding of ulirgs-lbgs at higher redshiftssuggests an evolution of the fir emission of lbgs with cosmic time. in anirx-$\beta$ diagram, pacs-detected lbgs at z ~ 1 tend to be located around therelation for local starburst similarly to other uv-selected pacs-detectedgalaxies at their same redshift. consequently, the dust-correction factorsobtained with their uv continuum slope allow to determine their total sfr,unlike at higher redshifts. however, the dust attenuation derived from uv tonir sed fitting overestimates the total sfr for most of our pacs-detected lbgsin age-dependent way: the overestimation factor is higher in younger galaxies.

1307.5316	the o3n2 and n2 abundance indicators revisited: improved calibrations  based on califa and te-based literature data	the use of ifs is since recently allowing to measure the emission line fluxesof an increasingly large number of star-forming galaxies both locally and athigh redshift. the main goal of this study is to review the most widely usedempirical oxygen calibrations, o3n2 and n2, by using new direct abundancemeasurements. we pay special attention to the expected uncertainty of thesecalibrations as a function of the index value or abundance derived and thepresence of possible systematic offsets. this is possible thanks to theanalysis of the most ambitious compilation of te-based hii regions to date.this new dataset compiles the te-based abundances of 603 hii regions extractedfrom the literature but also includes new measurements from the califa survey.besides providing new and improved empirical calibrations for the gasabundance, we also present here a comparison between our revisited calibrationswith a total of 3423 additional califa hii complexes with abundances derivedusing the ons calibration by pilyugin et al. (2010). the combined analysis ofte-based and ons abundances allows us to derive their most accurate calibrationto date for both the o3n2 and n2 single-ratio indicators, in terms of allstatistical significance, quality and coverage of the space of parameters. inparticular, we infer that these indicators show shallower abundancedependencies and statistically-significant offsets compared to those of pettiniand pagel (2004), nagao et al. (2006) and p\'erez-montero and contini (2009).the o3n2 and n2 indicators can be empirically applied to derive oxygenabundances calibrations from either direct abundance determinations with randomerrors of 0.18 and 0.16, respectively, or from indirect ones (but based on alarge amount of data) reaching an average precision of 0.08 and 0.09 dex(random) and 0.02 and 0.08 dex (systematic; compared to the directestimations),respectively.

1308.4271	the nature of liner galaxies: ubiquitous hot old stars and rare  accreting black holes	galaxies, which often contain ionised gas, sometimes also exhibit a so-calledlow-ionisation nuclear emission line region (liner). for 30 years this wasattributed to a central mass-accreting supermassive black hole (agn) of lowluminosity, making liner galaxies the largest agn-sub-population, dominating innumbers over higher luminosity seyfert galaxies and quasars. this, however,poses a serious problem. while the inferred energy balance is plausible, manyliners clearly do not contain any other independent signatures of an agn. usingintegral field spectroscopic data from the califa survey, we aim at comparingthe observed radial surface brightness profiles with what is expected fromillumination by an agn. essential for this analysis is a proper extraction ofemission-lines, especially weak lines such as the balmer hb line which issuperposed on an absorption trough. to accomplish this, we use the gandalf codewhich simultaneously fits the underlying stellar continuum and emission lines.we show for 48 galaxies with liner-like emission, that the radial emission-linesurface brightness profiles are inconsistent with ionisation by a centralpoint-source and hence cannot be due to an agn alone. the most probableexplanation for the excess liner-like emission is ionisation by evolved starsduring the short but very hot and energetic phase known as post-agb. this leadsus to an entirely new interpretation. post-agb stars are ubiquitous and theirionising effect should be potentially observable in every galaxy with gaspresent and stars older than ~1 gyr, unless a stronger radiation field fromyoung hot stars or an agn outshines them. this means that galaxies withliner-like emission are in fact not a class defined by a property, but ratherby the absence of a property. it also explains why liner emission is observedmostly in massive galaxies with old stars and little star formation.

1401.4993	the alhambra survey: an empirical estimation of the cosmic variance for  merger fraction studies based on close pairs	our goal is to estimate empirically, for the first time, the cosmic variancethat affects merger fraction studies based on close pairs. we compute themerger fraction from photometric redshift close pairs with 10h^-1 kpc &lt;= rp &lt;=50h^-1 kpc and dv &lt;= 500 km/s, and measure it in the 48 sub-fields of thealhambra survey. we study the distribution of the measured merger fractions,that follow a log-normal function, and estimate the cosmic variance sigma_v asthe intrinsic dispersion of the observed distribution. we develop a maximumlikelihood estimator to measure a reliable sigma_v and avoid the dispersion dueto the observational errors (including the poisson shot noise term). the cosmicvariance of the merger fraction depends mainly on (i) the number density of thepopulations under study, both for the principal (n_1) and the companion (n_2)galaxy in the close pair, and (ii) the probed cosmic volume v_c. we find asignificant dependence on neither the search radius used to define closecompanions, the redshift, nor the physical selection (luminosity or stellarmass) of the samples. we provide a parametrisation of the cosmic variance withn_1, n_2, and v_c, sigma_v = 0.48 n_1^{-0.54} v_c^{-0.48} (n_2/n_1)^{-0.37}.thanks to this prescription, future merger fraction studies based on closepairs could account properly for the cosmic variance on their results.

1404.1078	active galactic nuclei synapses: x-ray versus optical classifications  using artificial neural networks	(abridged) many classes of active galactic nuclei (agn) have been definedentirely throughout optical wavelengths while the x-ray spectra have been veryuseful to investigate their inner regions. however, optical and x-ray resultsshow many discrepancies that have not been fully understood yet. the aim ofthis paper is to study the "synapses" between the x-ray and opticalclassifications.  for the first time, the new efluxer task allowed us to analyse broad bandx-ray spectra of emission line nuclei (eln) without any prior spectral fittingusing artificial neural networks (anns). our sample comprises 162 xmm-newton/pnspectra of 90 local eln in the palomar sample. it includes starbursts (sb),transition objects (t2), liners (l1.8 and l2), and seyferts (s1, s1.8, and s2).  the anns are 90% efficient at classifying the trained classes s1, s1.8, andsb. the s1 and s1.8 classes show a wide range of s1- and s1.8-like components.we suggest that this is related to a large degree of obscuration at x-rays. thes1, s1.8, s2, l1.8, l2/t2/sb-agn (sb with indications of agn), and sb classeshave similar average x-ray spectra within each class, but these average spectracan be distinguished from class to class. the s2 (l1.8) class is linked to thes1.8 (s1) class with larger sb-like component than the s1.8 (s1) class. the l2,t2, and sb-agn classes conform a class in the x-rays similar to the s2 classalbeit with larger fractions of sb-like component. this sb-like component isthe contribution of the star-formation in the host galaxy, which is large whenthe agn is weak. an agn-like component seems to be present in the vast majorityof the eln, attending to the non-negligible fraction of s1-like or s1.8-likecomponent. this trained ann could be used to infer optical properties fromx-ray spectra in surveys like erosita.

1405.5222	kinematic alignment of non-interacting califa galaxies: quantifying the  impact of bars on stellar and ionised gas velocity field orientations	we present 80 stellar and ionised gas velocity maps from the calar altolegacy integral field area (califa) survey in order to characterize thekinematic orientation of non-interacting galaxies. the study of galaxies inisolation is a key step towards understanding how fast-external processes, suchas major mergers, affect kinematic properties in galaxies. we derived theglobal and individual (projected approaching and receding sides) kinematicposition angles (pas) for both the stellar and ionised gas line-of-sightvelocity distributions. when compared to the photometric pa, we find thatmorpho-kinematic differences are smaller than 22 degrees in 90% of the samplefor both components; internal kinematic misalignments are generally smallerthan 16 degrees. we find a tight relation between the global stellar andionised gas kinematic pa consistent with circular-flow pattern motions in bothcomponents. this relation also holds generally in barred galaxies across thebar and galaxy disk scales. our findings suggest that even in the presence ofstrong bars, both the stellar and the gaseous components tend to follow thegravitational potential of the disk. as a result, kinematic orientation can beused to assess the degree of external distortions in interacting galaxies.

1407.0663	x-ray spectral variability of liners selected from the palomar sample	variability is a general property of active galactic nuclei (agn). at x-rays,the way in which these changes occur is not yet clear. in the particular caseof low ionisation nuclear emission line region (liner) nuclei, variations onmonths/years timescales have been found for some objects, but the main driverof these changes is still an open question. the main purpose of this work is toinvestigate the x-ray variability in liners, including the main driver of suchvariations, and to search for eventual differences between type 1 and 2objects. we use the 18 liners in the palomar sample with data retrieved fromchandra and/or xmm-newton archives corresponding to observations gathered atdifferent epochs. all the spectra for the same object are simultaneously fittedin order to study long term variations. the nature of the variability patternsare studied allowing different parameters to vary during the spectral fit.whenever possible, short term variations from the analysis of the light curvesand uv variability are studied.

1407.2939	califa: a diameter-selected sample for an integral field spectroscopy  galaxy survey	we describe and discuss the selection procedure and statistical properties ofthe galaxy sample used by the calar alto legacy integral field area survey(califa), a public legacy survey of 600 galaxies using integral fieldspectroscopy. the califa "mother sample" was selected from the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) dr7 photometric catalogue to include all galaxies with anr-band isophotal major axis between 45" and 79.2" and with a redshift 0.005 &lt; z&lt; 0.03. the mother sample contains 939 objects, 600 of which will be observedin the course of the califa survey. the selection of targets for observationsis based solely on visibility and thus keeps the statistical properties of themother sample. by comparison with a large set of sdss galaxies, we find thatthe califa sample is representative of galaxies over a luminosity range of -19&gt; mr &gt; -23.1 and over a stellar mass range between 10^9.7 and 10^11.4msun. inparticular, within these ranges, the diameter selection does not lead to anysignificant bias against - or in favour of - intrinsically large or smallgalaxies. only below luminosities of mr = -19 (or stellar masses &lt; 10^9.7msun)is there a prevalence of galaxies with larger isophotal sizes, especially ofnearly edge-on late-type galaxies, but such galaxies form &lt; 10% of the fullsample. we estimate volume-corrected distribution functions in luminosities andsizes and show that these are statistically fully compatible with estimatesfrom the full sdss when accounting for large-scale structure. we also present anumber of value-added quantities determined for the galaxies in the califasample. we explore different ways of characterizing the environments of califagalaxies, finding that the sample covers environmental conditions from thefield to genuine clusters. we finally consider the expected incidence of activegalactic nuclei among califa galaxies.

1408.5765	ionized gas kinematics of galaxies in the califa survey i: velocity  fields, kinematic parameters of the dominant component, and presence of  kinematically distinct gaseous systems	this work provides an overall characterization of the kinematic behavior ofthe ionized gas of the galaxies included in the calar alto legacy integralfield area (califa), offering kinematic clues to potential users of this surveyfor including kinematical criteria for specific studies. from the first 200galaxies observed by califa, we present the 2d kinematic view of the 177galaxies satisfying a gas detection threshold. after removing the stellarcontribution, we used the cross-correlation technique to obtain the radialvelocity of the dominant gaseous component. the main kinematic parameters weredirectly derived from the radial velocities with no assumptions on the internalmotions. evidence of the presence of several gaseous components with differentkinematics were detected by using [oiii] profiles. most objects in the sampleshow regular velocity fields, although the ionized-gas kinematics are rarelyconsistent with simple coplanar circular motions. 35% of the objects presentevidence of a displacement between the photometric and kinematic centers largerthan the original spaxel radii. only 17% of the objects in the sample exhibitkinematic lopsidedness when comparing receding and approaching sides of thevelocity fields, but most of them are interacting galaxies exhibiting nuclearactivity. early-type galaxies in the sample present clear photometric-kinematicmisaligments. there is evidence of asymmetries in the emission line profilessuggesting the presence of kinematically distinct gaseous components atdifferent distances from the nucleus. this work constitutes the firstdetermination of the ionized gas kinematics of the galaxies observed in thecalifa survey. the derived velocity fields, the reported kinematicpeculiarities and the identification of the presence of several gaseouscomponents might be used as additional criteria for selecting galaxies forspecific studies.

1409.1142	the alhambra survey: accurate merger fractions by pdf analysis of  photometric close pairs	our goal is to develop and test a novel methodology to compute accurate closepair fractions with photometric redshifts. we improve the current methodologiesto estimate the merger fraction f_m from photometric redshifts by (i) using thefull probability distribution functions (pdfs) of the sources in redshiftspace, (ii) including the variation in the luminosity of the sources with z inboth the selection of the samples and in the luminosity ratio constrain, and(iii) splitting individual pdfs into red and blue spectral templates to dealrobustly with colour selections. we test the performance of our new methodologywith the pdfs provided by the alhambra photometric survey. the merger fractionsand rates from the alhambra survey are in excellent agreement with those fromspectroscopic work, both for the general population and for red and bluegalaxies. with the merger rate of bright (m_b &lt;= -20 - 1.1z) galaxies evolvingas (1+z)^n, the power-law index n is larger for blue galaxies (n = 2.7 +- 0.5)than for red galaxies (n = 1.3 +- 0.4), confirming previous results.integrating the merger rate over cosmic time, we find that the average numberof mergers per galaxy since z = 1 is n_m = 0.57 +- 0.05 for red galaxies andn_m = 0.26 +- 0.02 for blue galaxies. our new methodology exploitsstatistically all the available information provided by photometric redshiftcodes and provides accurate measurements of the merger fraction by close pairsonly using photometric redshifts. current and future photometric surveys willbenefit of this new methodology.

1501.03826	on the liner nuclear obscuration, compton-thickness and the existence of  the dusty torus; clues from spitzer/irs spectra	most of the optically classified low ionisation narrow emission-line regions(liners) nuclei host an active galactic nuclei (agn). however, how they fitinto the unified model (um) of agn is still an open question. the aims of thiswork are to study at mid-infrared (mid-ir) (1) the compton-thick nature ofliners; and (2) the disappearance of the dusty torus in liners predicted fromtheoretical arguments. we have compiled all the available low spectralresolution mid-ir spectra of liners from the irs/spitzer (40 liners). we havecomplemented this sample with spitzer/irs spectra of pgqsos, s1s, s2s, and sbsnuclei. we have studied the agn versus the starburst content in our sampleusing different indicators: the ew(pah 6.2um), the strength of the silicatefeature at 9.7um, and the steepness of the mid-ir spectra. in 25 out of the 40liners (i.e., 62.5%) the mid-ir spectra are not sb-dominated, similar to thecomparison s2 sample (67.7%). the average spectra of both sb-dominated linersand s2s are very similar to the average spectrum of the sb class. moreover, theaverage spectrum of agn-dominated liners with lx(2-10kev)&gt;10e+41 erg/s issimilar to the average mid-ir spectrum of agn-dominated s2s. however, faintliners show flat spectra different from any of the other optical classes,suggesting the disappearance of the dusty torus. the correlation betweennulnu(12um) and lx(2-10kev) for agn nicely extends toward low luminosities onlyif sb-dominated liners are excluded and lx(2-10kev) is corrected incompton-thick liner candidates. we discuss the nature of faint liners bycomparing it with the spectra of several emission mechanisms like jet, adaf,planetary nebulae, or post-agb stars. we suggest that the material producingthe compton-thick x-ray obscuration is free of dust, to reconcile thecompton-thick nature of a large fraction of liners with the lack of dusty-torussignatures.

1506.04157	the califa survey across the hubble sequence: spatially resolved stellar  population properties in galaxies	this paper characterizes the radial structure of stellar populationproperties of galaxies in the nearby universe, based on 300 galaxies from thecalifa survey. the sample covers a wide range of hubble types, and galaxystellar mass. we apply the spectral synthesis techniques to recover the stellarmass surface density, stellar extinction, light and mass-weighted ages, andmass-weighted metallicity, for each spatial resolution element in our targetgalaxies. to study mean trends with overall galaxy properties, the individualradial profiles are stacked in seven bins of galaxy morphology. we confirm thatmore massive galaxies are more compact, older, more metal rich, and lessreddened by dust. additionally, we find that these trends are preservedspatially with the radial distance to the nucleus. deviations from theserelations appear correlated with hubble type: earlier types are more compact,older, and more metal rich for a given mass, which evidences that quenching isrelated to morphology, but not driven by mass. negative gradients of ages areconsistent with an inside-out growth of galaxies, with the largest agesgradients in sb-sbc galaxies. further, the mean stellar ages of disks andbulges are correlated, with disks covering a wider range of ages, and late typespirals hosting younger disks. the gradients in stellar mass surface densitydepend mostly on stellar mass, in the sense that more massive galaxies are morecentrally concentrated. there is a secondary correlation in the sense that atthe same mass early type galaxies have steeper gradients. we find mildlynegative metallicity gradients, shallower than predicted from models of galaxyevolution in isolation. the largest gradients occur in sb galaxies. overall weconclude that quenching processes act in manners that are independent of mass,while metallicity and galaxy structure are influenced by mass-dependentprocesses.

1507.05846	the impact from survey depth and resolution on the morphological  classification of galaxies	we consistently analyse for the first time the impact of survey depth andspatial resolution on the most used morphological parameters for classifyinggalaxies through non-parametric methods: abraham and conselice-bershadyconcentration indices, gini, m20 moment of light, asymmetry, and smoothness.three different non-local datasets are used, alhambra and sxds (examples ofdeep ground-based surveys), and cosmos (deep space-based survey). we used asample of 3000 local, visually classified galaxies, measuring theirmorphological parameters at their real redshifts (z ~ 0). then we simulatedthem to match the redshift and magnitude distributions of galaxies in thenon-local surveys. the comparisons of the two sets allow to put constraints onthe use of each parameter for morphological classification and evaluate theeffectiveness of the commonly used morphological diagnostic diagrams. allanalysed parameters suffer from biases related to spatial resolution and depth,the impact of the former being much stronger. when including asymmetry andsmoothness in classification diagrams, the noise effects must be taken intoaccount carefully, especially for ground-based surveys. m20 is significantlyaffected, changing both the shape and range of its distribution at allbrightness levels.we suggest that diagnostic diagrams based on 2 - 3 parametersshould be avoided when classifying galaxies in ground-based surveys,independently of their brightness; for cosmos they should be avoided forgalaxies fainter than f814 = 23.0. these results can be applied directly tosurveys similar to alhambra, sxds and cosmos, and also can serve as anupper/lower limit for shallower/deeper ones.

1508.02861	the alhambra survey : estimation of the clustering signal encoded in the  cosmic variance	the relative cosmic variance ($\sigma_v$) is a fundamental source ofuncertainty in pencil-beam surveys and, as a particular case of count-in-cellstatistics, can be used to estimate the bias between galaxies and theirunderlying dark-matter distribution. our goal is to test the significance ofthe clustering information encoded in the $\sigma_v$ measured in the alhambrasurvey. we measure the cosmic variance of several galaxy populations selectedwith $b-$band luminosity at $0.35 \leq z &lt; 1.05$ as the intrinsic dispersion inthe number density distribution derived from the 48 alhambra subfields. wecompare the observational $\sigma_v$ with the cosmic variance of the darkmatter expected from the theory, $\sigma_{v,{\rm dm}}$. this provides anestimation of the galaxy bias $b$. the galaxy bias from the cosmic variance isin excellent agreement with the bias estimated by two-point correlationfunction analysis in alhambra. this holds for different redshift bins, for redand blue subsamples, and for several $b-$band luminosity selections. we findthat $b$ increases with the $b-$band luminosity and the redshift, as expectedfrom previous work. moreover, red galaxies have a larger bias than bluegalaxies, with a relative bias of $b_{\rm rel} = 1.4 \pm 0.2$. our resultsdemonstrate that the cosmic variance measured in alhambra is due to theclustering of galaxies and can be used to characterise the $\sigma_v$ affectingpencil-beam surveys. in addition, it can also be used to estimate the galaxybias $b$ from a method independent of correlation functions.

1511.01926	x-ray long-term variations in the low-luminosity agn ngc835 and its  circumnuclear emission	obscured active galactic nuclei (agns) are thought to be very common in theuniverse. observations and surveys have shown that the number of sourcesincreases for near galaxies and at the low-luminosity regime (the so-calledllagns). furthermore, many agns show changes in their obscuration properties atx-rays that may suggest a configuration of clouds very close to the accretiondisk. however, these variations could also be due to changes in the intrinsiccontinuum of the source. it is therefore important to study nearby agn tobetter understand the locus and distribution of clouds in the neighbourhood ofthe nucleus. we aim to study the nuclear obscuration of llagn ngc835 and itsextended emission using mid-infrared observations. we present mid-infrared 11.5microns imaging of the llagn galaxy ngc835 obtained with the instrumentcanaricam in the gran telescopio canarias (gtc), archival spitzer/irsspectroscopy, and archival chandra data observed in 2000, 2008, and 2013. thegtc/canaricam 11.5 microns image reveals faint extended emission out to ~6arcsec. we obtained a nuclear flux of f(11.5 microns) ~18 mjy, whereas theextended emission accounts for 90% of the total flux within the 6 arcsec. thismeans that the low angular resolution (~4 arcsec) irs spectrum is dominated bythis extended emission and not by the agn, clearly seen in the spitzer/irsspectrum. although the extended soft x-ray emission shows some resemblance withthat of the mid-infrared, the knots seen at x-rays are mostly located in theinner side of this mid-infrared emission. the nuclear x-ray spectrum of thesource has undergone a spectral change between 2000/2008 and 2013. we arguethat this is most probably due to changes in the hydrogen column density from ~8x10e+23 cm-2 to ~ 3x10e+23 cm-2. ngc835 therefore is one of the few llagn,together with ngc1052, in which changes in the absorber can be claimed.

astro-ph;0006247	near-infrared photometry of isolated spirals with and without an agn.  ii: photometric properties of the host galaxies	we present the analysis of morphological and photometric properties of asample of isolated spirals with (18) and without (11) an active nucleus, basedon near-infrared imaging in the j and k' bands. the aim of this analysis is tofind the differential properties that could be directly connected with thephenomenon of nuclear activity. we stress the importance of using isolatedobjects for that purpose. our study shows that both sets of galaxies aresimilar in their global properties: they define the same kormendy relation,their disk components share the same properties, the bulge and disk scalelengths are correlated in a similar way, bar strengths and lengths are similarfor primary bars. hosts of isolated seyfert galaxies have bulge and diskproperties comparable to those of isolated non active spirals. central colors(the innermost 200 pc) of active galaxies are redder than the centers of nonactive spirals, most probably due to agn light being re-emitted by the hot dustand/or due to circumnuclear star formation, through the contribution ofgiants/supergiants. only one of the seyfert galaxies in our sample does notpresent a primary bar,but both primary and secondary bars are equally presentin active and control objects. secondary central elongations (associated withsecondary bars, lenses, rings or disks) may be somewhat different. numericalmodels indicate that such secondary bars are not strictly necessary to feed thecentral engine when a primary bar is present. our results show that down toscales of 100-300 pc, there are no obvious differences between active and nonactive spiral galaxies.

astro-ph;0101425	detection of the optical afterglow of grb 000630: implications for dark  bursts	we present the discovery of the optical transient of the long-durationgamma-ray burst grb000630. the optical transient was detected with the nordicoptical telescope 21.1 hours after the burst. at the time of discovery themagnitude of the transient was r = 23.04+-0.08. the transient displayed apower-law decline characterized by a decay slope of alpha = -1.035+-0.097. adeep image obtained 25 days after the burst shows no indication of acontribution from a supernova or a host galaxy at the position of thetransient. the closest detected galaxy is a r=24.68+-0.15 galaxy 2.0 arcsecnorth of the transient.  the magnitudes of the optical afterglows of grb980329, grb980613 andgrb000630 were all r&gt;=23 less than 24 hours from the burst epoch. we discussthe implications of this for our understanding of grbs without detected opticaltransients. we conclude that i) based on the gamma-ray properties of thecurrent sample we cannot conclude that grbs with no detected ots belong toanother class of grbs than grbs with detected ots and ii) the majority (&gt;75%)of grbs for which searches for optical afterglow have been unsuccessful areconsistent with no detection if they were similar to bursts like grb000630 atoptical wavelengths.

astro-ph;0106179	dynamics of blue compact galaxies, as revealed by their h$\alpha$  velocity fields ii. mass models and the starburst triggering mechanism	the h$\alpha$ velocity fields of a sample of six luminous blue compactgalaxies (bcgs) and two companions have been obtained by observations with ascanning fabry-perot interferometer. the fabry-perot images, velocity fieldsand rotations curves have been presented in a previous paper (paper i). ingeneral, the velocity fields are irregular and often contain secondarydynamical components, but display overall rotation. the two companions havemore regular velocity fields and rotation curves. in this article we analysethe velocity fields and dynamics together with the morphology of the studiedbcgs, and present detailed mass models. in addition, we model the stellar masscontent by means of multicolour surface photometry and spectral evolutionarysynthesis analysis. by comparison of the masses of stars and those derived fromthe rotation curve, we show that about half of the galaxies cannot be supportedby rotation alone. the morphology and dynamics of the bcgs suggest that thestarburst activity in these galaxies are most likely triggered by mergersinvolving gas-rich dwarf galaxies and/or massive gas clouds.

astro-ph;0207020	rotation curves and metallicity gradients from hii regions in spiral  galaxies	in this paper we study long slit spectra in the region of h$\alpha$ emissionline of a sample of 111 spiral galaxies with recognizable and well definedspiral morphology and with a well determined environmental status, ranging fromisolation to non-disruptive interaction with satellites or companions. the formand properties of the rotation curves are considered as a function of theisolation degree, morphological type and luminosity. the line ratios are usedto estimate the metallicity of all the detected hii regions, thus producing acomposite metallicity profile for different types of spirals. we have foundthat isolated galaxies tend to be of later types and lower luminosity than theinteracting galaxies. the outer parts of the rotation curves of isolatedgalaxies tend to be flatter than in interacting galaxies, but they show similarrelations between global parameters. the scatter of the tully-fisher relationdefined by isolated galaxies is significantly lower than that of interactinggalaxies. the [nii]/h$\alpha$ ratios, used as metallicity indicator, show aclear trend between z and morphological type, t, with earlier spirals showinglarger ratios; this trend is tighter when instead of t the gradient of theinner rotation curve, g, is used; no trend is found with the interactionstatus. the z-gradient of the disks depends on the type, being almost flat forearly spirals, and increasing for later types. the [nii]/h$\alpha$ ratiosmeasured for disk hii regions of interacting galaxies are higher than fornormal/isolated objects, even if all the galaxy families present similardistributions of h$\alpha$ equivalent width.

astro-ph;0306497	the detection of stellar velocity dispersion drops in the central  regions of five isolated seyfert spirals	we analyze the kinematics of the central regions of five isolated seyfertspiral galaxies from the degas sample (four with new data presented in thispaper, ic184, ugc3223, ngc2639, ngc6814, and ngc6951 from our previous data),by using long slit spectroscopy in the caii triplet range (at ~ 8600 a)obtained with a 4m-class telescope. a drop of the velocity dispersions in theinnermost 1-3 arcsec is observed in four of them, and hinted in the remaininggalaxy (ngc6814). the available hst images for our sample together with anothernine galaxies with reported velocity dispersion drops, are also used toinvestigate the presence of morphological inner structures at the scales of thekinematical drops. evidence for disk-like shapes is found in 12 out of the 14cases. the only exceptions are ngc6814 and ngc6951. existing n-body simulationsincluding stars, gas and star formation predict that such a drop is mostprobably due to a young stellar population born from dynamically cold gasaccreted in a circumnuclear disk formed during an episode of central gasaccretion driven by a bar. the equivalent widths of the calcium triplet linesfor our 5 galaxies have been measured. even if the profiles could be formallyconsistent with constant ew(cat) values, they seem to indicate the presence ofa local maximum in the regions corresponding spatially to the drops; ifconfirmed, this would imply the presence of a different stellar population,whose properties could help constraining the models.

astro-ph;0307556	starburst in hs 0822+3542 induced by the very blue lsb dwarf sao  0822+3545	(abridged). one of the most metal-deficient blue compact galaxies (bcgs) hs0822+3542 (z=1/34 zsun), is also one of the nearest such objects. a triggermechanism for its current sf burst has remained unclear. we report thediscovery of a very blue ((b-v)tot=0.08 and (v-r)tot=0.14) lsb (mu_b^0 &gt; 23.4arcsec^-2) dwarf irregular (dirr) galaxy, named sao 0822+3545. its smallrelative velocity and projected distance of ~11 kpc from the bcg imply theirphysical association. for this lsb galaxy, we present spectroscopic results,total b,v,r magnitudes, the effective radii and surface brightness (sb), and wedescribe its morphological properties. we compare the very blue colours of thisdwarf with pegase.2 models of the colour evolution of a z=1/20 zsun stellarpopulation, and combine this analysis with the data on the lsbd ew(ha) values.the models best describing all available observational data depend on therelative fraction of massive stars in the imf used. for a salpeter imf with mup= 120 msun, the best model includes a "young" single stellar population (ssp)with an age of ~10 myr and an "old" ssp with the age of ~0.2--10 gyr. the massratio of the old to young components should be in the range of 10 to 30. therole of interaction in triggering the galaxies major sf episodes during thelast ~100-200 myr is discussed. for the bcg, based on the spectroscopy with the6m telescope, we estimate the physical parameters of its sf region and presentthe first evidence of an ionized gas supershell. this pair of dwarfs lies deepwithin the nearby lynx-cancer void, with the nearest bright (l &gt; l*) galaxiesat distances &gt; 3 mpc. this is probably one of the main factors responsible forthe unevolved state of hs 0822+3542.

astro-ph;0311616	long slit spectroscopy of a sample of isolated spirals with and without  an agn	we present the kinematical data obtained for a sample of active (seyfert) andnon active isolated spiral galaxies, based on long slit spectra along severalposition angles in the halpha line region and, in some cases, in the ca tripletregion as well. gas velocity distributions are presented, together with asimple circular rotation model that allows to determine the kinematical majoraxes. stellar velocity distributions are also shown. the main result is thatactive and control galaxies seem to be equivalent in all kinematical aspects.for both subsamples, the departure from pure circular rotation in some galaxiescan be explained by the presence of a bar and/or of a spiral arm. they alsopresent the same kind of peculiarities, in particular, s-shape structures arequite common near the nuclear regions. they define very similar tully-fisherrelations. emission line ratios are given for all the detected hii regions; theanalysis of the [nii]/halpha metallicity indicator shows that active andnon-active galaxies have indistinguishable disk metallicities. these resultsargue in favour of active and non-active isolated spiral galaxies havingessentially the same properties, in agreement with our previous results basedon the analysis of near infrared images. it appears now necessary to confirmthese results on a larger sample.

astro-ph;0403146	properties of isolated disk galaxies	a sample of isolated galaxies (isg), selected by the ratio, $f$, betweeninner and tidal forces acting upon a galaxy, is presented. the analysis of thecoma cluster lead us to adopt the criterion $f\leq -4.5$ for isg. thecandidates are from the cfa catalog with cz $\leq$5000 km/s, |b|&gt; 40\deg, dec$\ge -$2.5\deg. the sample contains 203 objects from the initial 1706. we alsoselected a sample (n=130) of perturbed galaxies, i.e., with companions (withknown z, $\delta(cz)\le 500$ km/s), $f\geq-$2. the comparison of both samplesshows significant differences in morphology, size, mass, luminosity and colors.sc spirals are more frequent among isg, and s0s among perturbed galaxies. isgappear to be smaller, less luminous and bluer than interacting objects. we alsofound that bars are twice as frequent among perturbed galaxies in particularfor early s and s0. the perturbed galaxies have higher l$_{fir}$/l$_b$ andm$_{mol}$/l$_b$ ratios, but the atomic gas content is similar for the twosamples. the l-size and m-l relations shows similar trends, the main differencebeing the almost total absence of big, bright and massive galaxies among theisg, and the almost total absence of small, faint and low mass galaxies amongthe perturbed systems. the evolution induced by interactions, would thereforeproceed from late, small, faint and low mass s to earlier, bigger, moreluminous and more massive s and s0 galaxies, producing at the same time alarger fraction of barred galaxies, but preserving the same relations betweenglobal parameters. the properties of local isg are similar to those of highredshift galaxies, suggesting that the present day isolated galaxies could bequietly evolved, unused {\sl building blocks} surviving in low densityenvironments.

astro-ph;0510368	a log n(hi) = 22.6 dla in a dark gamma-ray burst: the environment of grb  050401	the optical afterglow spectrum of grb050401 (at z=2.8992+/-0.0004) shows thepresence of a dla, with log(nhi)=22.6+/-0.3. this is the highest column densityever observed in a dla, and is about five times larger than the strongest dladetected so far in any qso spectrum. from the optical spectrum, we also find avery large zn column density, allowing us to infer an abundance of[zn/h]=-1.0+/-0.4. these large columns are supported by the x-ray spectrum fromswift-xrt which shows a column density (in excess of galactic) oflog(nh)=22.21^{+0.06}_{-0.08} assuming solar abundances (at z=2.9). thecomparison of this x-ray column density, which is dominated by absorption dueto alpha-chain elements, and the hi column density derived from the ly-alphaabsorption line, allows us to derive a metallicity for the absorbing matter of[alpha/h]=-0.4+/-0.3. the optical spectrum is reddened and can be wellreproduced with a power-law with smc extinction, where a_v=0.62+/-0.06. but thetotal optical extinction can also be constrained in a way which is independentof the shape of the extinction curve: from the optical-to-x-ray spectral energydistribution we find, 0.5&lt;~a_v&lt;~4.5. however, even this upper limit,independent of the shape of the extinction curve, is still well below the dustcolumn that is inferred from the x-ray column density, i.e.a_v=9.1^{+1.4}_{-1.5}. this discrepancy might be explained by a small dustcontent with high metallicity (low dust-to-metals ratio). `grey' extinctioncannot explain the discrepancy since we are comparing the metallicity to ameasurement of the total extinction (without reference to the reddening).little dust with high metallicity may be produced by sublimation of dust grainsor may naturally exist in systems younger than a few hundred myr.

0812.3568	optimal filter systems for photometric redshift estimation	in the next years, several cosmological surveys will rely on imaging data toestimate the redshift of galaxies, using traditional filter systems with 4-5optical broad bands; narrower filters improve the spectral resolution, butstrongly reduce the total system throughput. we explore how photometricredshift performance depends on the number of filters n_f, characterizing thesurvey depth through the fraction of galaxies with unambiguous redshiftestimates. for a combination of total exposure time and telescope imaging areaof 270 hrs m^2, 4-5 filter systems perform significantly worse, both incompleteness depth and precision, than systems with n_f &gt;= 8 filters. ourresults suggest that for low n_f, the color-redshift degeneracies overwhelm theimprovements in photometric depth, and that even at higher n_f, the effectivephotometric redshift depth decreases much more slowly with filter width thannaively expected from the reduction in s/n. adding near-ir observationsimproves the performance of low n_f systems, but still the system whichmaximizes the photometric redshift completeness is formed by 9 filters withlogarithmically increasing bandwidth (constant resolution) and half-bandoverlap, reaching ~0.7 mag deeper, with 10% better redshift precision, than 4-5filter systems. a system with 20 constant-width, non-overlapping filtersreaches only ~0.1 mag shallower than 4-5 filter systems, but has a precisionalmost 3 times better, dz = 0.014(1+z) vs. dz = 0.042(1+z). we briefly discussa practical implementation of such a photometric system: the alhambra survey.
