0901.1262	the dust condensation sequence in red super-giant stars	context: red super-giant (rsg) stars exhibit significant mass loss through aslow and dense wind. they are often considered to be the more massive counterparts of asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars. while the agb mass loss is linkedto their strong pulsations, the rsg are often only weakly variable. aim: tostudy the conditions at the base of the wind, by determining the dustcomposition in a sample of rsg. the dust composition is thought to be sensitiveto the density, temperature and acceleration at the base of the wind. method:we compile a sample of 27 rsg infrared spectra (iso-sws) and supplement thesewith photometric measurements to obtain the full spectral energy distribution(sed). these data are modelled using a dust radiative transfer code. theresults are scrutinised for correlations. results: we find (1) strongcorrelations between dust composition, mass-loss rate and stellar luminosity,roughly in agreement with the theoretical dust condensation sequence, (2) theneed for a continuous (near-)ir dust opacity and tentatively propose amorphouscarbon, and (3) significant differences with agb star winds: presence of pahs,absence of 'the' 13 micron band, and a lack of strong water bands. conclusions:dust condensation in rsg is found to experience a similar freeze-out process asin agb stars. together with the positive effect of the stellar luminosity onthe mass-loss rate, this suggests that radiation pressure on dust grains is animportant ingredient in the driving mechanism. still, differences with agbstars are manifold and thus the winds of rsg deserve separate studies.

0905.1048	an iso/sws study of the dust composition around s stars	we investigate the composition of the solid-state materials in the windsaround s-type agb stars. the s stars produce dust in their wind that bears aresemblance to the dust produced in some o-rich agb stars. however, thereported resemblance is mostly based on iras/lrs spectra with limited spectralresolution, sensitivity, and wavelength coverage. we investigate the dustcomposition around s stars using iso/sws data that surpass the previous studiesin terms of spectral resolution and wavelength coverage. we compare the dustspectra from the 9 sources with the o-rich agb spectra and a subset of msuper-giants. we constructed average dust emission spectra of the differentcategories. we report the discovery of several previously unreported dustemission features in the s star spectra. the long wavelength spectra of w aqland pi1 gru exhibit the "30" micrometer feature attributed to mgs. two sourcesexhibit a series of emission bands between 20 and 40 micrometer that wetentatively ascribe to diopside. we show that the 10-20 micrometer spectra ofthe s stars are significantly different from the o-rich agb stars. the o-richstars exhibit a structured emission feature that is believed to arise fromamorphous silicate and aluminium-oxide. the s stars lack the substructure foundin the o-rich stars. instead they show a smooth peak with a varyingpeak-position from source to source. we suggest that this feature is caused bya family of related material, whose exact composition determines the peakposition. the observed trend mimics the laboratory trend of non-stoichiometricsilicates. in this scenario the degree of non-stoichiometry is related to themg to sio4 ratio, in other words, to the amount of free o available during thedust grain growth.

0907.1253	spitzer/irac view of sh 2-284: searching for evidence of triggered star  formation in an isolated region in the outer milky way	using spitzer/irac observations of a region to be observed by the corotsatellite, we have unraveled a new complex star-forming region at lowmetallicity in the outer galaxy. we perform a study of s284 in order to outlinethe chain of events in this star-forming region. we used four-band spitzer/iracphotometry as well as halpha imaging obtained with int/wfc. combining thesedata with the optical photometry obtained in the frame of corots preparationand the 2mass catalog we analysed the properties and distribution of youngstellar objects (ysos) associated with point-like sources. we also studied theseds of regions of extended emission, complementing our dataset with iras andmsx data. we find that s284 is unique in several ways: it is very isolated atthe end of a spiral arm and both the diffuse dust and ionized emission areremarkably symmetric. we have partially resolved the central clusters of thethree bubbles present in this region. despite the different scales present inits multiple-bubble morphology, our study points to a very narrow spread ofages among the powering high-mass clusters. in contrast, the particularsawtooth structure of the extended emission at the rim of each ionized bubbleharbours either small lower-mass clusters with a younger stellar population orindividual young reddened protostars. in particular, triggered star formationis considered to be at work in these regions.

1001.5136	the herschel reference survey	the herschel reference survey is a guaranteed time herschel key project andwill be a benchmark study of dust in the nearby universe. the survey willcomplement a number of other herschel key projects including large cosmologicalsurveys that trace dust in the distant universe. we will use herschel toproduce images of a statistically-complete sample of 323 galaxies at 250, 350and 500 micron. the sample is volume-limited, containing sources with distancesbetween 15 and 25 mpc and flux limits in the k-band to minimize the selectioneffects associated with dust and with young high-mass stars and to introduce aselection in stellar mass. the sample spans the whole range of morphologicaltypes (ellipticals to late-type spirals) and environments (from the field tothe centre of the virgo cluster) and as such will be useful for other purposesthan our own. we plan to use the survey to investigate (i) the dust content ofgalaxies as a function of hubble type, stellar mass and environment, (ii) theconnection between the dust content and composition and the other phases of theinterstellar medium and (iii) the origin and evolution of dust in galaxies. inthis paper, we describe the goals of the survey, the details of the sample andsome of the auxiliary observing programs that we have started to collectcomplementary data. we also use the available multi-frequency data to carry outan analysis of the statistical properties of the sample.

1004.1967	when an old star smolders: on the detection of hydrocarbon emission from  s-type agb stars	polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) produce characteristic infraredemission bands that have been observed in a wide range of astrophysicalenvironments, where carbonaceous material is subjected to ultraviolet (uv)radiation. although pahs are expected to form in carbon-rich agb stars, theyhave up to now only been observed in binary systems where a hot companionprovides a hard radiation field. in this letter, we present low-resolutioninfrared spectra of four s-type agb stars, selected from a sample of 90 s-typeagb stars observed with the infrared spectrograph aboard the spitzer satellite.the spectra of these four stars show the typical infrared features of pahmolecules. we confirm the correlation between the temperature of the centralstar and the centroid wavelength of the 7.9 {\mu}m feature, present in a widevariety of stars spanning a temperature range from 3 000 to 12 000 k. three offour sources presented in this paper extend this relation towards lowertemperatures. we argue that the mixture of hydrocarbons we see in these s-starshas a rich aliphatic component. the fourth star, bz cma, deviates from thiscorrelation. based on the similarity with the evolved binary tu tau, we predictthat bz cma has a hot companion as well.

1005.1526	spire imaging of m82: cool dust in the wind and tidal streams	m82 is a unique representative of a whole class of galaxies, starbursts withsuperwinds, in the very nearby galaxy survey with herschel. in addition, itsinteraction with the m81 group has stripped a significant portion of itsinterstellar medium from its disk. spire maps now afford bettercharacterization of the far-infrared emission from cool dust outside the disk,and sketch a far more complete picture of its mass distribution and energeticsthan previously possible. they show emission coincident in projection with thestarburst wind and in a large halo, much more extended than the pah bandemission seen with spitzer. some complex substructures coincide with thebrightest pah filaments, and others with tidal streams seen in atomic hydrogen.we subtract the far-infrared emission of the starburst and underlying disk fromthe maps, and derive spatially-resolved far-infrared colors for the wind andhalo. we interpret the results in terms of dust mass, dust temperature, andglobal physical conditions. in particular, we examine variations in the dustphysical properties as a function of distance from the center and the windpolar axis, and conclude that more than two thirds of the extraplanar dust hasbeen removed by tidal interaction, and not entrained by the starburst wind.

1005.1865	the herschel revolution: unveiling the morphology of the high mass star  formation sites n44 and n63 in the lmc	we study the structure of the medium surrounding sites of high-mass starformation to determine the interrelation between the hii regions and theenvironment from which they were formed. the density distribution of thesurroundings is key in determining how the radiation of the newly formed starsinteracts with the surrounds in a way that allows it to be used as a starformation tracer. we present new herschel/spire 250, 350 and 500 mum data oflha 120-n44 and lha 120-n63 in the lmc. we construct average spectral energydistributions (seds) for annuli centered on the ir bright part of the starformation sites. the annuli cover ~10-~100 pc. we use a phenomenological dustmodel to fit these seds to derive the dust column densities, characterise theincident radiation field and the abundance of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbonmolecules. we see a factor 5 decrease in the radiation field energy density asa function of radial distance around n63. n44 does not show a systematic trend.we construct a simple geometrical model to derive the 3-d density profile ofthe surroundings of these two regions. herschel/spire data have proven veryefficient in deriving the dust mass distribution. we find that the radiationfield in the two sources behaves very differently. n63 is more or lessspherically symmetric and the average radiation field drops with distance. n44shows no systematic decrease of the radiation intensity which is probably dueto the inhomogeneity of the surrounding molecular material and to the complexdistribution of several star forming clusters in the region.

1005.2497	determining dust temperatures and masses in the herschel era: the  importance of observations longward of 200 micron	the properties of the dust grains (e.g., temperature and mass) can be derivedfrom fitting far-ir seds (&gt;100 micron). only with spire on herschel has it beenpossible to get high spatial resolution at 200 to 500 micron that is beyond thepeak (~160 micron) of dust emission in most galaxies. we investigate thedifferences in the fitted dust temperatures and masses determined using only&lt;200 micron data and then also including &gt;200 micron data (new spireobservations) to determine how important having &gt;200 micron data is forderiving these dust properties. we fit the 100 to 350 micron observations ofthe large magellanic cloud (lmc) point-by-point with a model that consists of asingle temperature and fixed emissivity law. the data used are existingobservations at 100 and 160 micron (from iras and spitzer) and new spireobservations of 1/4 of the lmc observed for the heritage key project as part ofthe herschel science demonstration phase. the dust temperatures and massescomputed using only 100 and 160 micron data can differ by up to 10% and 36%,respectively, from those that also include the spire 250 &amp; 350 micron data. wefind that an emissivity law proportional to lambda^-1.5 minimizes the 100-350micron fractional residuals. we find that the emission at 500 micron is ~10%higher than expected from extrapolating the fits made at shorter wavelengths.we find the fractional 500 micron excess is weakly anti-correlated with mips 24micron flux and the total gas surface density. this argues against a fluxcalibration error as the origin of the 500 micron excess. our results do notallow us to distinguish between a systematic variation in the wavelengthdependent emissivity law or a population of very cold dust only detectable atlambda &gt; 500 micron for the origin of the 500 micron excess.

1005.2592	the youngest massive protostars in the large magellanic cloud	we demonstrate the unique capabilities of herschel to study very youngluminous extragalactic young stellar objects (ysos) by analyzing a centralstrip of the large magellanic cloud obtained through the heritage sciencedemonstration program. we combine pacs 100 and 160, and spire 250, 350, and 500microns photometry with 2mass (1.25-2.17 microns) and spitzer irac and mips(3.6-70 microns) to construct complete spectral energy distributions (seds) ofcompact sources. from these, we identify 207 candidate embedded ysos in theobserved region, ~40% never-before identified. we discuss their position infar-infrared color-magnitude space, comparing with previously studied,spectroscopically confirmed ysos and maser emission. all have red colorsindicating massive cool envelopes and great youth. we analyze four exampleysos, determining their physical properties by fitting their seds withradiative transfer models. fitting full seds including the herschel datarequires us to increase the size and mass of envelopes included in the models.this implies higher accretion rates (greater than or equal to 0.0001 m_sun/yr),in agreement with previous outflow studies of high-mass protostars. our resultsshow that herschel provides reliable longwave seds of large samples ofhigh-mass ysos; discovers the youngest ysos whose seds peak in herschel bands;and constrains the physical properties and evolutionary stages of ysos moreprecisely than was previously possible.

1005.2787	dust in the bright supernova remnant n49 in the lmc	we investigate the dust associated with the supernova remnant (snr) n49 inthe large magellanic cloud (lmc) as observed with the herschel spaceobservatory. n49 is unusually bright because of an interaction with a molecularcloud along its eastern edge. we have used pacs and spire to measure the far irflux densities of the entire snr and of a bright region on the eastern edge ofthe snr where the snr shock is encountering the molecular cloud. using thesefluxes supplemented with archival data at shorter wavelengths, we estimate thedust mass associated with n49 to be about 10 msun. the bulk of the dust in oursimple two-component model has a temperature of 20-30 k, similar to that ofnearby molecular clouds. unfortunately, as a result of the limited angularresolution of herschel at the wavelengths sampled with spire, the uncertaintiesare fairly large. assuming this estimate of the dust mass associated with thesnr is approximately correct, it is probable that most of the dust in the snrarises from regions where the shock speed is too low to produce significantx-ray emission. the total amount of warm 50-60 k dust is ~0.1 or 0.4 msun,depending on whether the dust is modeled in terms of carbonaceous or silicategrains. this provides a firm lower limit to the amount of shock heated dust inn49.

0708.4107	the variable mass loss of the agb star wx psc as traced by the co j=1-0  through 7-6 lines and the dust emission	low and intermediate mass stars lose a significant fraction of their massthrough a dust-driven wind during the asymptotic giant branch (agb) phase.recent studies show that winds from late-type stars are far from being smooth.mass-loss variations occur on different time scales, from years to tens ofthousands of years. the variations appear to be particularly prominent towardsthe end of the agb evolution. the occurrence, amplitude and time scale of thesevariations are still not well understood.  the goal of our study is to gain insight into the structure of thecircumstellar envelope (cse) of wx psc and map the possible variability of thelate-agb mass-loss phenomenon.  we have performed an in-depth analysis of the extreme infrared agb star wxpsc by modeling (1) the co j=1-0 through 7-6 rotational line profiles and thefull spectral energy distribution (sed) ranging from 0.7 to 1300 micron. wehence are able to trace a geometrically extended region of the cse.  both mass-loss diagnostics bear evidence of the occurrence of mass-lossmodulations during the last ~2000 yr. in particular, wx psc went through a highmass-loss phase (mdot~5e-5 msun/yr) some 800 yr ago. this phase lasted about600 yr and was followed by a long period of low mass loss (mdot~5e-8 msun/yr).the present day mass-loss rate is estimated to be ~6e-6 msun/yr.  the agb star wx psc has undergone strong mass-loss rate variability on a timescale of several hundred years during the last few thousand years. thesevariations are traced in the strength and profile of the co rotational linesand in the sed. we have consistently simulated the behaviour of both tracersusing radiative transfer codes that allow for non-constant mass-loss rates.

1010.4770	on the origin of m81 group extended dust emission	galactic cirrus emission at far-infrared wavelengths affects manyextragalactic observations. separating this emission from that associated withextragalactic objects is both important and difficult. in this paper we discussa particular case, the m81 group, and the identification of diffuse structuresprominent in the infrared, but also detected at optical wavelengths. the originof these structures has previously been controversial, ranging from them beingthe result of a past interaction between m81 and m82 or due to more localgalactic emission. we show that over of order a few arcminute scales thefar-infrared (herschel 250 &amp;\mu&amp;m) emission correlates spatially very well witha particular narrow velocity (2-3 km/s) component of the galactic hi. we findno evidence that any of the far-infrared emission associated with thesefeatures actually originates in the m81 group. thus we infer that theassociated diffuse optical emission must be due to galactic light backscattered off dust in our galaxy. ultra-violet observations pick out youngstellar associations around m81, but no detectable far-infrared emission. weconsider in detail one of the galactic cirrus features, finding that thefar-infrared hi relation breaks down below arc minute scales and that atsmaller scales there can be quite large dust temperature variations.

(2008). we present a diagnosticdiagram that will help to identify similar sources based on spitzer/mips andherschel/pacs photometry. the sed of sage1cj053634 is peculiar because it lacksfar-ir emission and a clear stellar counterpart. we find that the sed and their spectrum can be understood as emission originating from the inner ~10 pcaround an accreting black hole. there is no need to invoke emission from thehost galaxy, either from the stars or from the interstellar medium, although apossible early-type host galaxy cannot be excluded based on the sed analysis.the hot dust around the accretion disk gives rise to a continuum, which peaksat 4 um, whereas the strong silicate features may arise from optically thinemission of dusty clouds within ~10 pc around the black hole. the weak pahemission does not appear to be linked to star formation, as star formationtemplates strongly over-predict the measured far-ir flux levels. the sed ofsage1cj053634 is rare in the local universe but may be more common in the moredistant universe. the conspicuous absence of host-galaxy ir emission placeslimits on the far-ir emission arising from the dusty torus alone.

1110.1260	non-standard grain properties, dark gas reservoir, and extended  submillimeter excess, probed by herschel in the large magellanic cloud	aims: in this paper, we perform detailed modelling of the spitzer andherschel observations of the lmc, in order to: (i) systematically study theuncertainties and biases affecting dust mass estimates; and to (ii) explore thepeculiar ism properties of the lmc.  methods: to achieve these goals, we have modelled the spatially resolved sedswith two alternate grain compositions, to study the impact of differentsubmillimetre opacities on the dust mass. we have rigorously propagated theobservational errors (noise and calibration) through the entire fittingprocess, in order to derive consistent parameter uncertainties.  results: first, we show that using the integrated sed leads tounderestimating the dust mass by ~50 % compared to the value obtained withsufficient spatial resolution, for the region we studied. this might be thecase, in general, for unresolved galaxies. second, we show that milky way typegrains produce higher gas-to-dust mass ratios than what seems possibleaccording to the element abundances in the lmc. a spatial analysis shows thatthis dilemma is the result of an exceptional property: the grains of the lmchave on average a larger intrinsic submm opacity (emissivity index beta~1.7 andopacity kappa_abs(160 microns)=1.6 m2/kg) than those of the galaxy. by studyingthe spatial distribution of the gas-to-dust mass ratio, we are able toconstrain the fraction of unseen gas mass between ~10, and ~100 % and show thatit is not sufficient to explain the gas-to-dust mass ratio obtained with milkyway type grains. finally, we confirm the detection of a 500 microns extendedemission excess with an average relative amplitude of ~15 %, varying up to 40%. this excess anticorrelates well with the dust mass surface density. althoughwe do not know the origin of this excess, we show that it is unlikely theresult of very cold dust, or cmb fluctuations.

1202.2290	the spitzer spectroscopic survey of s-type stars	s-type agb stars are thought to be in the transitional phase between m-typeand c-type agb stars. because of their peculiar chemical composition, one mayexpect a strong influence of the stellar c/o ratio on the molecular chemistryand the mineralogy of the circumstellar dust. in this paper, we present a largesample of 87 intrinsic galactic s-type agb stars, observed at infraredwavelengths with the spitzer space telescope, and supplemented withground-based optical data. on the one hand, we derive the stellar parametersfrom the optical spectroscopy and photometry, using a grid of modelatmospheres. on the other, we decompose the infrared spectra to quantify theflux-contributions from the different dust species. finally, we compare theindependently determined stellar parameters and dust properties. for the starswithout significant dust emission, we detect a strict relation between thepresence of sis absorption in the spitzer spectra and the c/o ratio of thestellar atmosphere. these absorption bands can thus be used as an additionaldiagnostic for the c/o ratio. for stars with significant dust emission, wedefine three groups, based on the relative contribution of certain dust speciesto the infrared flux. we find a strong link between group-membership and c/oratio. we show that these groups can be explained by assuming that thedust-condensation can be cut short before silicates are produced, while theremaining free atoms and molecules can then form the observed magnesiumsulfides or the carriers of the unidentified 13 and 20 micron features.finally, we present the detection of emission features attributed to moleculesand dust characteristic to c-type stars, such as molecular sis, hydrocarbonsand magnesium sulfide grains. we show that we often detect magnesium sulfidestogether with molecular sis and we propose that it is formed by a reaction ofsis molecules with mg.

1206.2451	discovery of a tio emission band in the infrared spectrum of the s star  np aurigae	we report on the discovery of an infrared emission band in the spitzerspectrum of the s-type agb star np aurigae that is caused by tio molecules inthe circumstellar environment. we modelled the observed emission to derive thetemperature of the tio molecules (\approx 600 k), an upper limit on the columndensity (\approx 10^17.25 cm^{-2}) and a lower limit on the spatial extent ofthe layer that contains these molecules. (\approx 4.6 stellar radii). this isthe first time that this tio emission band is observed. a search for similaremission features in the sample of s-type stars yielded two additionalcandidates. however, owing to the additional dust emission, the identificationis less stringent. by comparing the stellar characteristics of np aur to thoseof the other stars in our sample, we find that all stars with tio emission showlarge-amplitude pulsations, s-process enrichment, and a low c/o ratio. thesecharacteristics might be necessary requirements for a star to show tio inemission, but they are not sufficient.

1209.0804	the nature of the interstellar medium of the starburst low-metallicity  galaxy haro11: a multi-phase model of the infrared emission	(abridged) our goal is to describe the multi-phase ism of the ir brightlow-metallicity galaxy haro 11, dissecting the photoionised andphotodissociated gas components. we present observations of the mid- and far-irfine-structure cooling lines obtained with the spitzer/irs and herschel/pacsspectrometers. we use the spectral synthesis code cloudy to methodically modelthe ionised and neutral gas from which these lines originate. we find that themid- and far-ir lines account for ~1% of the total ir luminosity l_tir. haro 11is undergoing a phase of intense star formation, as traced by the brightestline [oiii] 88um, with l_[oiii]/l_tir ~0.3%, and high ratios of [neiii]/[neii]and [siv]/[siii]. due to their different origins, the observed lines require amulti-phase modeling comprising: a compact hii region, dense fragmentedphotodissociation regions (pdrs), a diffuse extended low-ionisation/neutral gaswhich has a volume filling factor of at least 90%, and porous warm dust inproximity to the stellar source. for a more realistic picture of the ism ofharo 11 we would need to model the clumpy source and gas structures. we combinethese 4 model components to explain the emission of 17 spectral lines,investigate the global energy balance of the galaxy through its spectral energydistribution, and establish a phase mass inventory. while the ionic emissionlines of haro 11 essentially originate from the dense hii region component, adiffuse low-ionisation gas is needed to explain the [neii], [nii], and [cii]line intensities. the [oiii] 88um line intensity is not fully reproduced by ourmodel, hinting towards the possible presence of yet another low-densityhigh-ionisation medium. the [oi] emission is consistent with a dense pdr of lowcovering factor, and we find no evidence for an x-ray dominated component. thepdr component accounts for only 10% of the [cii] emission.

1209.6057	physical conditions in the gas phases of the giant hii region lmc-n11  unveiled by herschel - i. diffuse [cii] and [oiii] emission in lmc-n11b	(abridged) the magellanic clouds provide a nearby laboratory for metal-poordwarf galaxies. the low dust abundance enhances the penetration of uv photonsinto the interstellar medium (ism), resulting in a relatively larger fillingfactor of the ionized gas. furthermore, there is likely a hidden molecular gasreservoir probed by the [cii]157um line. we present herschel/pacs maps inseveral tracers, [cii], [oi]63um,145um, [nii]122um, [niii]57um, and [oiii]88umin the hii region n11b in the large magellanic cloud. halpha and [oiii]5007aimages were used as complementary data to investigate the effect of dustextinction. observations were interpreted with photoionization models to inferthe gas conditions and estimate the ionized gas contribution to the [cii]emission. photodissociation regions (pdrs) are probed through polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbons (pahs). we first study the distribution and properties ofthe ionized gas. we then constrain the origin of [cii]157um by comparing totracers of the low-excitation ionized gas and of pdrs. [oiii] is dominated byextended emission from the high-excitation diffuse ionized gas; it is thebrightest far-infrared line, ~4 times brighter than [cii]. the extent of the[oiii] emission suggests that the medium is rather fragmented, allowing far-uvphotons to permeate into the ism to scales of &gt;30pc. furthermore, by comparing[cii] with [nii], we find that 95% of [cii] arises in pdrs, except toward thestellar cluster for which as much as 15% could arise in the ionized gas. wefind a remarkable correlation between [cii]+[oi] and pah emission, with [cii]dominating the cooling in diffuse pdrs and [oi] dominating in the densest pdrs.the combination of [cii] and [oi] provides a proxy for the total gas cooling inpdrs. our results suggest that pah emission describes better the pdr gasheating as compared to the total infrared emission.

1302.2825	the thermal dust emission in the n158-n159-n160 (lmc) star forming  complex mapped by spitzer, herschel and laboca	we present a study of the infrared/submm emission of the lmc star formingcomplex n158-n159-n160. combining observations from the spitzer space telescope(3.6-70um), the herschel space observatory (100-500um) and laboca (870um)allows us to work at the best angular resolution available now for anextragalactic source. we observe a remarkably good correlation between spireand laboca emission and resolve the low surface brightnesses emission. we usethe spitzer and herschel data to perform a resolved spectral energydistribution (sed) modelling of the complex. using mbb, we derive a globalemissivity index beta_c of 1.47. if beta cold is fixed to 1.5, we find anaverage temperature of 27k. we also apply the galliano et al. (2011) modellingtechnique (and amorphous carbon to model carbon dust) to derive maps of thestar formation rate, the mean starlight intensity, the fraction of pahs or thedust mass surface density of the region. we observe that the pah fractionstrongly decreases in the hii regions. this decrease coincides with peaks inthe mean radiation field intensity map. the dust surface densities follow thefir distribution, with a total dust mass of 2.1x10^4 msolar (2.8 times lessthan when using graphite grains) in the resolved elements we model. we find anon-negligible amount of dust in the molecular cloud n159 south (showing nomassive sf). we also investigate the drivers of the herschel/pacs and spiresubmm colours as well as the variations in the gas-to-dust mass ratio (g/d) andthe xco conversion factor in the region n159. we finally model individualregions to analyse variations in the sed shape across the complex and the 870umemission in more details. no measurable submm excess emission at 870um seems tobe detected in these regions.

0801.1118	detection of `parent' molecules from the inner wind of agb stars as  tracers of non-equilibrium chemistry	asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars are typified by strong dust-driven,molecular outflows. for long, it was believed that the molecular setup of thecircumstellar envelope of agb stars is primarily determined by the atmosphericc/o ratio. however, recent observations of molecules such as hcn, sio, and soreveal gas-phase abundances higher than predicted by thermodynamic equilibrium(te) models. uv-photon initiated dissociation in the outer envelope ornon-equilibrium formation by the effect of shocks in the inner envelope may bethe origin of the anomolous abundances. we aim at detecting (i.) a group of`parent' molecules (co, sio, hcn, cs), predicted by the non-equilibrium studyof cherchneff (2006) to form with almost constant abundances independent of thec/o ratio and the stellar evolutionary stage on the asymptotic giant branch(agb), and (ii.) few molecules, such as sis and so,which are sensitive to theo- or c-rich nature of the star. several low and high excitation rotationaltransitions of key molecules are observed at mm and sub-mm wavelengths withjcmt and apex in four agb stars: the oxygen-rich mira wx psc, the s star w aql,and the two carbon stars v cyg and ii lup. a critical density analysis isperformed to determine the formation region of the high-excitation molecularlines. we detect the four `parent' molecules in all four objects, implyingthat, indeed, these chemical species form whatever the stage of evolution onthe agb. high-excitation lines of sis are also detected in three stars withapex, whereas so is only detected in the oxygen-rich star wx psc. this is thefirst multi-molecular observational proof that periodically shocked layersabove the photosphere of agb stars show some chemical homogeneity, whatever thephotospheric c/o ratio and stage of evolution of the star.

1309.1371	revealing the cold dust in low-metallicity environments: i - photometry  analysis of the dwarf galaxy survey with herschel	we present new photometric data from our herschel key programme, the dwarfgalaxy survey (dgs), dedicated to the observation of the gas and dust in 48low-metallicity environments. they were observed with pacs and spire onboardherschel at 70,100,160,250,350, and 500 microns. we focus on a systematiccomparison of the derived fir properties (fir luminosity, dust mass, dusttemperature and emissivity index) with more metal-rich galaxies and investigatethe detection of a potential submm excess. the data reduction method is adaptedfor each galaxy to derive the most reliable photometry from the final maps.pacs flux densities are compared with the mips 70 and 160 microns bands. we usecolour-colour diagrams and modified blackbody fitting procedures to determinethe dust properties of the dgs galaxies. we also include galaxies from theherschel kingfish sample, containing more metal-rich environments, totalling109 galaxies. the location of the dgs galaxies on herschel colour-colourdiagrams highlights the differences in global environments of low-metallicitygalaxies. the dust in dgs galaxies is generally warmer than in kingfishgalaxies (t_dgs~32 k, t_kingfish~23 k). the emissivity index, beta, is ~1.7 inthe dgs, but metallicity does not make a strong effect on beta. thedust-to-stellar mass ratio is lower in low-metallicity galaxies:m_dust/m_star~0.02% for the dgs vs 0.1% for kingfish. per unit dust mass, dwarfgalaxies emit ~6 times more in the fir than higher metallicity galaxies. out ofthe 22 dgs galaxies detected at 500 micron, 41% present an excess in the submmnot explained by our dust sed model. the excess mainly appears in lowermetallicity galaxies (12+log(o/h) &lt; 8.3), and the strongest excesses aredetected in the most metal-poor galaxies. we stress the need for observationslongwards of the herschel wavelengths to detect any submm excess appearingbeyond 500 micron.

0705.1231	the outburst of the eruptive young star oo serpentis between 1995 and  2006	oo serpentis is a deeply embedded pre-main sequence star that went intooutburst in 1995 and gradually faded afterwards. its eruption resembled thewell-known fu orionis-type or ex lupi-type outbursts. since very few suchevents have ever been documented at infrared wavelengths, our aim is to studythe temporal evolution of oo ser in the infrared. oo ser was monitored with theinfrared space observatory starting 4 months after peak brightness and covering20 months. in 2004-2006 we again observed oo ser from the ground andcomplemented this dataset with archival spitzer obsevations also from 2004. weanalysed these data with special attention to source confusion and constructedlight curves at 10 different wavelengths as well as spectral energydistributions. the outburst caused brightening in the whole infrared regime.according to the infrared light curves, oo ser started a wavelength-independentfading after peak brightness. later the flux decay became slower but stayedwavelength-independent. the fading is still ongoing, and current fading ratesindicate that oo ser will not return to quiescent state before 2011. theoutburst timescale of oo ser seems to be shorter than that of fuors, but longerthan that of exors. the outburst timescale and the moderate luminosity suggestthat oo ser is different from both fuors and exors, and shows similarities tothe recently erupted young star v1647 ori. based on its spectral energydistribution and bolometric temperature, oo ser seems to be an early class iobject, with an age of &lt; 10^5 yr. the object is probably surrounded by anaccretion disc and a dense envelope. due to the shorter outburst timescales,the viscosity in the circumstellar disc of oo ser is probably an order ofmagnitude higher than usual for fuors.

1501.03634	star-formation rates from young-star counts and the structure of the ism  across the ngc346/n66 complex in the smc	the rate at which interstellar gas is converted into stars, and itsdependence on environment, is one of the pillars on which our understanding ofthe visible universe is build. we present a comparison of the surface densityof young stars (sigma_*) and dust surface density (sigma_d) across ngc346 (n66)in 115 independent pixels of 6x6 pc^2. we find a correlation between sigma_*and sigma_d with a considerable scatter. a power law fit to the data yields asteep relation with an exponent of 2.6+-0.2. we convert sigma_d to gas surfacedensity (sigma_g) and sigma_* to star formation rate (sfr) surface densities(sigma_sfr), using simple assumptions for the gas-to-dust mass ratio and theduration of star formation. the derived total sfr (4+-1 10^-3 m_sun/yr) isconsistent with sfr estimated from the ha emission integrated over the hanebula. on small scales the sigma_sfr derived using ha systematicallyunderestimates the count-based sigma_sfr, by up to a factor of 10. this is dueto ionizing photons escaping the area, where the stars are counted. we findthat individual 36 pc^2 pixels fall systematically above integrateddisc-galaxies in the schmidt-kennicutt diagram by on average a factor of ~7.the ngc346 average sfr over a larger area (90 pc radius) lies closer to therelation but remains high by a factor of ~3. the fraction of the total mass(gas plus young stars) locked in young stars is systematically high (~10 percent) within the central 15 pc and systematically lower outside (2 per cent),which we interpret as variations in star formation efficiency. the inner 15 pcis dominated by young stars belonging to a centrally condensed cluster, whilethe outer parts are dominated by a dispersed population. therefore, theobserved trend could reflect a change of star formation efficiency betweenclustered and non-clustered star-formation.

1502.03131	the herschel dwarf galaxy survey: i. properties of the low-metallicity  ism from pacs spectroscopy	the far-infrared (fir) lines are key tracers of the physical conditions ofthe interstellar medium (ism) and are becoming workhorse diagnostics forgalaxies throughout the universe. our goal is to explain the differences andtrends observed in the fir line emission of dwarf galaxies compared to moremetal-rich galaxies. we present herschel pacs spectroscopic observations of thecii157um, oi63 and 145um, oiii88um, nii122 and 205um, and niii57umfine-structure cooling lines in a sample of 48 low-metallicity star-forminggalaxies of the guaranteed time key program dwarf galaxy survey. we correlatepacs line ratios and line-to-ltir ratios with ltir, ltir/lb, metallicity, andfir color, and interpret the observed trends in terms of ism conditions andphase filling factors with cloudy radiative transfer models. we find that thefir lines together account for up to 3 percent of ltir and that star-formingregions dominate the overall emission in dwarf galaxies. compared to metal-richgalaxies, the ratios of oiii/nii122 and niii/nii122 are high, indicative ofhard radiation fields. in the photodissociation region (pdr), the cii/oi63ratio is slightly higher than in metal-rich galaxies, with a small increasewith metallicity, and the oi145/oi63 ratio is generally lower than 0.1,demonstrating that optical depth effects should be small on the scales probed.the oiii/oi63 ratio can be used as an indicator of the ionized gas/pdr fillingfactor, and is found ~4 times higher in the dwarfs than in metal-rich galaxies.the high cii/ltir, oi/ltir, and oiii/ltir ratios, which decrease withincreasing ltir and ltir/lb, are interpreted as a combination of moderate fuvfields and low pdr covering factor. harboring compact phases of low fillingfactor and a large volume filling factor of diffuse gas, the ism oflow-metallicity dwarf galaxies has a more porous structure than that inmetal-rich galaxies.

1510.09175	from forced collapse to h ii region expansion in mon r2: envelope  density structure and age determination with herschel	the surroundings of hii regions can have a profound influence on theirdevelopment, morphology, and evolution. this paper explores the effect of theenvironment on h ii regions in the monr2 molecular cloud. we aim to investigatethe density structure of envelopes surrounding hii regions and to determinetheir collapse and ionisation expansion ages. the mon r2 molecular cloud is anideal target since it hosts an h ii region association. column density andtemperature images derived from herschel data were used together to model thestructure of hii bubbles and their surrounding envelopes. the resultingobservational constraints were used to follow the development of the mon r2ionised regions with analytical calculations and numerical simulations. thefour hot bubbles associated with h ii regions are surrounded by dense, cold,and neutral gas envelopes. the radial density profiles are reminiscent of thoseof low-mass protostellar envelopes. the inner parts of envelopes of all fourhii regions could be free-falling because they display shallow densityprofiles. as for their outer parts, the two compact hii regions show a densityprofile, which is typical of the equilibrium structure of an isothermal sphere.in contrast, the central uchii region shows a steeper outer profile, that couldbe interpreted as material being forced to collapse. the size of the heatedbubbles, the spectral type of the irradiating stars, and the mean initialneutral gas density are used to estimate the ionisation expansion time, texp,0.1myr,for the dense uchii and compact hii regions and 0.35 myr for theextended hii region. the envelope transition radii between the shallow andsteeper density profiles are used to estimate the time elapsed since theformation of the first proto stellar embryo, tinf : 1myr, for theultra-compact, 1.5 / 3myr for the compact, and greater than 6myr for theextended hii regions.

astro-ph;0103035	the ch out-of-plane bending modes of pah molecules in astrophysical  environments	we present 10-15 micron spectra of a sample of h ii regions, ysos and evolvedstars that show strong unidentified infrared emission features, obtained withthe iso/sws spectrograph on-board iso. these spectra reveal a plethora ofemission features with bands at 11.0, 11.2, 12.0, 12.7, 13.5 and 14.2 micron.these features are observed to vary considerably in relative strength toeach-other from source to source. in particular, the 10-15 micron spectra ofthe evolved stars are dominated by the 11.2 micron band while for h ii regionsthe 12.7 is typically as strong as the 11.2 micron band. analysing the iso datawe find a good correlation between the 11.2 micron band and the 3.3 micronband, and between the 12.7 micron and the 6.2 micron band. there is also acorrelation between the ratio of the uir bands to the total dust emission andthe 12.7 over 11.2 micron ratio. bands in the 10-15 micron spectral region aredue to ch out-of-plane (oop) bending modes of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(pahs). we summarise existing laboratory data and theoretical quantum chemicalcalculations of these modes for neutral and cationic pahs. due to modecoupling, the exact peak position of these bands depends on the number ofadjacent ch groups and hence the observed interstellar 10-15 micron spectra canbe used to determine the molecular structure of the interstellar pahs emittingin the different regions. we conclude that evolved stars predominantly injectcompact ~100-200 c-atom pahs into the ism where they are subsequentlyprocessed, resulting in more open and uneven pah structures.

astro-ph;0302448	the circumstellar envelope of the c-rich post-agb star hd 56126	we present a detailed study of the circumstellar envelope of thepost-asymptotic giant branch ``21 micron object'' hd 56126. we build a detaileddust radiative transfer model of the circumstellar envelope in order to derivethe dust composition and mass, and the mass-loss history of the star. to modelthe emission of the dust we use amorphous carbon, hydrogenated amorphouscarbon, magnesium sulfide and titanium carbide. we present a detailedparametrisation of the optical properties of hydrogenated amorphous carbon as afunction of h/c content. the mid-infrared imaging and spectroscopy is bestreproduced by a single dust shell from 1.2 to 2.6 arcsec radius around thecentral star. this shell originates from a short period during which themass-loss rate exceeded 10^(-4) m_sun/yr. we find that the strength of the``21'' micron feature poses a problem for the tic identification. the lowabundance of ti requires very high absorption cross-sections in the ultravioletand visible wavelength range to explain the strength of the feature. othernano-crystalline metal carbides should be considered as well. we find thathydrogenated amorphous carbon in radiative equilibrium with the local radiationfield does not reach a high enough temperature to explain the strength of the3.3-3.4 and 6-9 micron hydrocarbon features relative to the 11-17 micronhydrocarbon features. we propose that the carriers of these hydrocarbonfeatures are not in radiative equilibrium but are transiently heated to hightemperature. we find that 2 per cent of the dust mass is required to explainthe strength of the ``30'' micron feature, which fits well within the measuredatmospheric abundance of mg and s. this further strengthens the mgsidentification of the ``30'' micron feature.

astro-ph;0309777	mgs in detached shells around carbon stars. mining the mass-loss history	we investigate the dust composition of detached shells around carbon stars,with a focus to understand the origin of the cool magnesium-sulfide (mgs)material around warm carbon stars, which has been detected around several ofthese objects. we build a radiative transfer model of a carbon star surroundedby an expanding detached shell of dust. the shell contains amorphous carbongrains and mgs grains. we find that a small fraction of mgs dust (2% of thedust mass) can give a significant contribution to the iras 25 micron flux.however, the presence of mgs in the detached shell cannot be inferred from theiras broadband photometry alone but requires infrared spectroscopy. we applythe model to the detached-shell sources r scl and u cam, both exhibiting a coolmgs feature in their iso/sws spectra. we use the shell parameters derived forthe molecular shell, using the co submillimetre maps. the models, with mgsgrains located in the detached shell, explain the mgs grain temperature, asderived from their iso spectra, very well. this demonstrates that the mgsgrains are located at the distance of the detached shell, which is a directindication that these shells originate from a time when the stellar photospherewas already carbon-rich. in the case of r scl, the iras photometry issimultaneously explained by the single shell model. in the case of u cam, theiras photometry is under predicted, pointing to a contribution from cooler dustlocated even further away from the star than the molecular shell. we present asimple diagnostic to constrain the distance of the shell using the profile ofthe mgs emission feature. the emission feature shifts to longer wavelength withdecreasing grain temperature. one can therefore infer a temperature and acorresponding distance to the star from the observed profile.

astro-ph;0312184	the unidentified infrared features after iso	the infrared space observatory (iso) has provided the first complete mid-irspectra for a wide range of objects. almost all of these spectra are dominatedby the well-known infrared emission features at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, and 11.2 $\mu$m,the so-called unidentified infra-red (uir) features. besides the majorfeatures, there is an array of minor features and broad plateaux stretchingfrom 3 to 20 $\mu$m which reveal subtle details of conditions in the emissionzones and properties of the carriers. generally attributed to the vibrationalrelaxation of uv-pumped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules (pahs)containing some 50--100 c-atoms, these uir spectra are a treasure trove ofinformation. the iso spectra have, for the first time, allowed a systematicanalysis of the spectral characteristics of the uir features in a wide varietyof environments. the peak positions, profiles, and relative strengths of themajor features vary from source to source and spatially within sources. thesespecific profiles are not unique to certain object types but can occur withineach individual source. here, we review iso and recent ground-basedobservations and assess some of their implications.

astro-ph;0402037	pahs and crystalline silicates in the post-agb star iras 16279-4757	iras 16279-4757 belongs to a group of post-agb stars showing both pah bandsand crystalline silicates. we present mid-infrared images, that resolve theobject for the first time. the morphology is similar to that of the `redrectangle' (hd 44179), the prototype object with pahs and crystallinesilicates. a two-component model and images suggest a dense oxygen-rich torus,an inner, low-density carbon-rich region and a carbon-rich bipolar outflow. thepah bands are enhanced at the outflow, while the continuum emission isconcentrated towards the center. our findings support the suggestion that mixedchemistry and morphology are closely related. we discuss the iso/sws spectra ofiras 16279-4757. several bands in the iso/sws spectrum show a match withanorthite: this would be the first detection of this mineral outside the solarsystem. compared to hd 44179, the shapes of pah bands are closer to those ofplanetary nebulae, possibly related to a population of small pahs present hd44179, but absent around iras 16279-4757. detailed examination of the spectrashows the individual character of these two objects. the comparison suggeststhat the torus found in iras 16279-4757 may have formed more recently than thatin hd 44179.

astro-ph;0405098	the profiles of the 3 to 12 $\mu$m pah features	we present spectra of the 3.3 $\mu$m and 11.2 $\mu$m pah features of a largenumber of (extra-) galactic sources, obtained with iso-sws. clear variationsare present in the profiles of these features. the sources are classifiedindependently based on the 3.3 and 11.2 $\mu$m feature profiles and peakpositions. correlations between these classes and those based on the 6--9$\mu$m features (peeters et al. 2002) are found. also, these classificationsdepend on the type of object. the observed pronounced contrast in the spectralvariations for the ch modes (3.3 and 11.2 $\mu$m bands) versus the cc modes(6.2, 7.7 and 8.6 $\mu$m bands) is striking : the peak wavelengths of thefeatures attributed to cc modes vary by $\sim$15--80 cm$^{-1}$, while for thech modes the variations are $\sim$4--6.5 cm$^{-1}$. we summarize existinglaboratory data and theoretical calculations of pah molecules and complexes. incontrast to the 6.2 and 7.7 $\mu$m components which are attributed to pahcations, the 3.3 $\mu$m feature appears to originate in neutral and/ornegatively charged pahs. we attribute the variations in peak position andprofile of these features to the composition of the pah family. the variationsin fwhm of the 3.3 $\mu$m feature remains an enigma while those of the 11.2$\mu$m can be explained by anharmonicity and molecular structure. the possibleorigin of the observed contrast in profile variations between the ch modes andthe cc modes is highlighted.

astro-ph;0510486	amorphous alumina in the extended atmosphere of alpha orionis	in this paper we study the extended atmosphere of the late-type supergiantalpha orionis. infrared spectroscopy of red supergiants reveals strongmolecular bands, some of which do not originate in the photosphere but in acooler layer of molecular material above it. lately, these layers have beenspatially resolved by near and mid-ir interferometry. in this paper, we try toreconcile the ir interferometric and iso-sws spectroscopic results on alphaorionis with a thorough modelling of the photosphere, molecular layer(s) anddust shell. from the iso and near-ir interferometric observations, we find thatalpha orionis has only a very low density water layer close above thephotosphere. however, mid-ir interferometric observations and a narrow-slitn-band spectrum suggest much larger extra-photospheric opacity close to thephotosphere at those wavelengths, even when taking into account the detacheddust shell. we argue that this cannot be due to the water layer, and thatanother source of mid-ir opacity must be present. we show that this opacitysource is probably neither molecular nor chromospheric. rather, we presentamorphous alumina (al2o3) as the best candidate and discuss this hypothesis inthe framework of dust-condensation scenarios.

astro-ph;0602531	a spitzer mid-infrared spectral survey of mass-losing carbon stars in  the large magellanic cloud	we present a spitzer space telescope spectroscopic survey of mass-losingcarbon stars (and one oxygen-rich star) in the large magellanic cloud. thespectra cover the wavelength range 5--38 micron. they show varying combinationsof dust continuum, dust emission features (sic, mgs) and molecular absorptionbands (c2h2, hcn). a set of four narrow bands, dubbed the manchester system, isused to define the infrared continuum for dusty carbon stars. the relationsbetween the continuum colours and the strength of the dust and molecularfeatures are studied, and are compared to galactic stars of similar colours.the circumstellar 7-micron c2h2 band is found to be stronger at lowermetallicity, from a comparison of stars in the galaxy, the lmc and the smc.this is explained by dredge-up of carbon, causing higher c/o ratios at lowmetallicity (less o). a possible 10-micron absorption feature seen in ourspectra may be due to c3. this band has also been identified with interstellarsilicate or silicon-nitrite dust. the line-to-continuum ratio of thesic and mgsbands shows some indication of being lower at low metallicity. the mgs band isonly seen at dust temperatures below 600 k. we discuss the selection of carbonversus oxygen-rich agb stars using the j-k vs. k-a colours, and show that thesecolours are relatively insensitive to chemical type. metal-poor carbon starsform amorphous carbon dust from self-produced carbon. the formation efficiencyof oxygen-rich dust depends more strongly on metallicity. we suggest that inlower-metallicity environments, the dust input into the interstellar medium byagb stars is efficient but may be strongly biassed towards carbonaceous dust,as compare to the galaxy.

astro-ph;0606296	spitzer observations of acetylene bands in carbon-rich agb stars in the  large magellanic cloud	we investigate the molecular bands in carbon-rich agb stars in the largemagellanic cloud (lmc), using the infrared spectrograph (irs) on board thespitzer space telescope (sst) over the 5--38 micron range. all 26low-resolution spectra show acetylene (c2h2) bands at 7 and 14 micron. thehydrogen cyanide (hcn) bands at these wavelengths are very weak or absent. thisis consistent with low nitrogen abundances in the lmc. the observed 14 micronc2h2 band is reasonably reproduced by an excitation temperature of 500 k. thereis no clear dilution of the 14 micron band by circumstellar dust emission. this14 micron band originates from molecular gas in the circumstellar envelope inthese high mass-loss rate stars, in agreement with previous findings forgalactic stars. the c2h2,column density, derived from the 13.7 micron band,shows a gas mass-loss rate in the range 3x10^-6 to 5x10^{-5} msun yr-1. this iscomparable with the total mass-loss rate of these stars estimated from thespectral energy distribution. additionally, we compare the line strengths ofthe 13.7 micron c2h2 band of our lmc sample with those of a galactic sample.despite the low metallicity of the lmc, there is no clear difference in thec2h2 abundance among lmc and galactic stars. this reflects the effect of the3rd dredge-up bringing self-produced carbon to the surface, leading to high c/oratios at low metallicity.

astro-ph;0606299	probing the mass-loss history of agb and red supergiant stars from co  rotational line profiles i. theoretical model -- mass-loss history unravelled  in vy cma	context: mass loss plays a dominant role in the evolution of low mass starswhile they are on the asymptotic giant branch (agb). the gas and dust ejectedduring this phase are a major source in the mass budget of the interstellarmedium. recent studies have pointed towards the importance of variations in themass-loss history of such objects. aims: by modelling the full line profile oflow excitation co lines emitted in the circumstellar envelope, we can study themass-loss history of agb stars. methods: we have developed a non-lte radiativetransfer code, which calculates the velocity structure and gas kinetictemperature of the envelope in a self-consistent way. the resulting structureof the envelope provides the input for the molecular line radiativecalculations which are evaluated in the comoving frame. the code allows for theimplementation of modulations in the mass-loss rate. this code has beenbenchmarked against other radiative transfer codes and is shown to perform welland efficiently. results: we illustrate the effects of varying mass-loss ratesin case of a superwind phase. the model is applied to the well-studied case ofvy cma. we show that both the observed integrated line strengths as thespectral structure present in the observed line profiles, unambiguouslydemonstrate that this source underwent a phase of high mass loss (~ 3.2e-4msun/yr) some 1000 yr ago. this phase took place for some 100 yr, and waspreceded by a low mass-loss phase (~ 1e-6 msun/yr) taking some 800 yr. thecurrent mass-loss rate is estimated to be in the order of 8e-5 msun/yr.conclusions: in this paper, we demonstrate that both the relative strength ofthe co rotational line profiles and the (non)-occurrence of spectral structurein the profile offer strong diagnostics to pinpoint the mass-loss history.

astro-ph;0611071	spitzer spectroscopy of carbon stars in the small magellanic cloud	we present spitzer space telescope spectroscopic observations of 14carbon-rich agb stars in the small magellanic cloud. sic dust is seen in mostof the carbon-rich stars but it is weak compared to lmc stars. the sic featureis strong only for stars with significant dust excess, opposite to what isobserved for galactic stars. we argue that in the smc, sic forms at lowertemperature than graphite dust, whereas the reverse situation occurs in thegalaxy where sic condenses at higher temperatures and forms first. dust inputinto the interstellar medium by agb stars consists mostly of carbonaceous dust,with little sic or silicate dust. only the two coolest stars show a 30-micronband due to mgs dust. we suggest that this is due to the fact that, in the smc,mass-losing agb stars generally have low circumstellar (dust) optical depth andtherefore effective heating of dust by the central star does not allowtemperatures below the 650 k necessary for mgs to exist as a solid. gas phasec$_2$h$_2$ bands are stronger in the smc than in the lmc or galaxy. this isattributed to an increasing c/o ratio at low metallicity. we present acolour-colour diagram based on spitzer irac and mips colours to discriminatebetween o- and c-rich stars. we show that agb stars in the smc become carbonstars early in the thermal-pulsing agb evolution, and remain optically visiblefor $\sim 6 \times 10^5$ yr. for the lmc, this lifetime is $\sim 3 \times 10^5$yr. the superwind phase traced with spitzer lasts for $\sim 10^4$ yr. spitzerspectra of a k supergiant and a compact hii region are also given.

astro-ph;0702628	continuum emission around agb stars at 1.2 mm	it is generally acknowledged that the mass loss of asymptotic giant branch(agb) stars undergoes variations on different time scales. we constructedmodels for the dust envelopes for a sample of agb stars to assess whethermass-loss variations influence the spectral energy distribution (sed). toconstrain the variability, extra observations at millimetre wavelengths (1.2mm) were acquired. from the analysis of the dust models, two indications forthe presence of mass-loss variations can be found, being (1) a dust temperatureat the inner boundary of the dust envelope that is far below the dustcondensation temperature and (2) an altered density distribution with respectto rho(r) \propto r^{-2} resulting from a constant mass-loss rate. for 5 out ofthe 18 studied sources a two-component model of the envelope is required,consisting of an inner region with a constant mass-loss rate and an outerregion with a less steep density distribution. for one source an outer regionwith a steeper density distribution was found. moreover, in a search for timevariability in our data set at 1.2 mm, we found that wx psc shows a largerelative time variation of 34% which might partially be caused by variablemolecular line emission.

astro-ph;9911470	the infrared spectrum of the be star gamma cassiopeiae	we present the 2.4-45 micrometer iso-sws spectrum of the be star gamma cas(b0.5 ive). the spectrum is characterised by a thermal continuum which can bewell fit by a power-law s_nu ~ nu^0.99 over the entire sws wavelength range.for an isothermal disc of ionized gas with constant opening angle, thiscorreponds to a density gradient rho(r) ~ r^(-2.8). we report the detection ofthe humphreys bound-free jump in emission at 3.4 micrometer. the size of thejump is sensitive to the electron temperature of the gas in the disc, and wefind t~9000 k, i.e. much lower than the stellar effective temperature(25000-30000 k). the spectrum is dominated by numerous emission lines, mostlyfrom hi, but also some hei lines are detected. several spectral features cannotbe identified. the line strengths of the hi{\sc i} emission lines do not followcase b recombination line theory. the line strengths and widths suggest thatmany lines are optically thick and come from an inner, high density region withradius 3-5 r_star and temperature above that of the bulk of the disc material.only the alpha, beta and gamma transitions of the series lines contain acontribution from the outer regions. the level populations deviatesignificantly from lte and are highly influenced by the optically thick, local(disc) continuum radiation field. the inner disk may be rotating more rapidlythan the stellar photosphere.

0812.2396	a spatially resolved study of photoelectric heating and [cii] cooling in  the lmc	(abridged) we study photoelectric heating throughout the large magellaniccloud. we quantify the importance of the [cii] cooling line and thephotoelectric heating process of various environments in the lmc andinvestigate which parameters control the extent of photoelectric heating. weuse the bice [cii] map and the spitzer/sage infrared maps. we examine thespatial variations in the efficiency of photoelectric heating: photoelectricheating rate over power absorbed by grains. we correlate the photoelectricheating efficiency and the emission from various dust constituents and studythe variations as a function of h\alpha emission, dust temperatures, and thetotal infrared luminosity. from this we estimate radiation field, gastemperature, and electron density. we find systematic variations inphotoelectric efficiency. the highest efficiencies are found in the diffusemedium, while the lowest coincide with bright star-forming regions (~1.4 timeslower). the [cii] line emission constitutes 1.32% of the far infraredluminosity across the whole of the lmc. we find correlations between the [cii]emission and ratios of the mid infrared and far infrared bands, which comprisevarious dust constituents. the correlations are interpreted in light of thespatial variations of the dust abundance and by the local environmentalconditions that affect the dust emission properties. as a function of the totalinfrared surface brightness, s_{tir}, the [cii] surface brightness can bedescribed as: s_{[cii]}=1.25 s_{tir}^{0.69} [10^{-3} erg s^{-1} cm^{-2}sr^{-1}]. the [cii] emission is well-correlation with the 8 micrometeremission, suggesting that the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons play a dominantrole in the photoelectric heating process.
