0901.0073	accreting millisecond pulsar sax j1808.4-3658 during its 2002 outburst:  evidence for a receding disc	an outburst of the accreting x-ray millisecond pulsar sax j1808.4-3658 inoctober-november 2002 was followed by the rossi x-ray timing explorer for morethan a month. we demonstrate how the area covered by the hotspot at the neutronstar surface is decreasing in the course of the outburst together with thereflection amplitude. these trends are in agreement with the natural scenario,where the disc inner edge is receding from the neutron star as the massaccretion rate drops. these findings are further supported by the variations ofthe pulse profiles, which clearly show the presence of the secondary maximum atthe late stages of the outburst after october 29. this fact can be interpretedas the disc receding sufficiently far from the neutron star to open the view ofthe lower magnetic pole. in that case, the disc inner radius can be estimated.assuming that disc is truncated at the alfv\'en radius, we constrain thestellar magnetic moment to \mu=(9\pm5) 10^{25} g cm^3, which corresponds to thesurface field of 10^8 g. on the other hand, using the magnetic moment recentlyobtained from the observed pulsar spin-down rate we show that the disc edge hasto be within factor of two of the alfv\'en radius, putting interestingconstraints on the models of the disc-magnetosphere interaction. we alsodemonstrate that the sharp changes in the phase of the fundamental areintimately related to the variations of the pulse profile, which we associatewith the varying obscuration of the antipodal spot. the pulse profile amplitudeallows us to estimate the colatitude of the hotspot centroid to be 4-10 deg.

0906.1485	spectral variability of ultraluminous x-ray sources	we study spectral variability of 11 ultraluminous x-ray sources (ulx) usingarchived xmm-newton and chandra observations. we use three models to describethe observed spectra: a power-law, a multi-colour disc (mcd) and a combinationof these two models. we find that 7 ulxs show a correlation between theluminosity lx and the photon index gamma. furthermore, 4 out of these 7 ulxsalso show spectral pivoting in the observed energy band. we also find that twoulxs show an lx-gamma anti-correlation. the spectra of 4 ulxs in the sample canbe adequately fitted with a mcd model. we compare these sources to known blackhole binaries (bhb) and find that they follow similar paths in theirluminosity-temperature diagrams. finally we show that the `soft excess'reported for many of these ulxs at about 0.2 kev seems to roughly follow atrend lsoft \propto t^{-3.5} when modelled with a power-law plus a `cool' mcdmodel. this is contrary to the l \propto t^4 relation that is expected fromtheory and what is seen for many accreting bhbs. the observed trend couldinstead arise from disc emission beamed by an outflowing wind around a about 10solar mass black hole.

0910.5868	on the nature of pulse profile variations and timing noise in accreting  millisecond pulsars	timing noise in the data on accretion-powered millisecond pulsars (amp)appears as irregular pulse phase jumps on timescales from hours to weeks. alarge systematic phase drift is also observed in the first discovered amp saxj1808.4-3658. to study the origin of these timing features, we use here thedata of the well studied 2002 outburst of sax j1808.4-3658. we develop first amodel for pulse profile formation accounting for the screening of the antipodalemitting spot by the accretion disk. we demonstrate that the variations of thevisibility of the antipodal spot associated with the receding accretion diskcause a systematic shift in fourier phases, observed together with the changesin the pulse form. we show that a strong secondary maximum can be observed onlyin a narrow intervals of inner disk radii, which explains the very shortappearance of the double-peaked profiles in sax j1808.4-3658. by directlyfitting the pulse profile shapes with our model, we find that the mainparameters of the emitting spot such as its mean latitude and longitude as wellas the emissivity pattern change irregularly causing small shifts in pulsephase, and the strong profile variations are caused by the increasing innerdisk radius. we finally notice that significant variations in the pulseprofiles in the 2002 and 2008 outbursts of sax j1808.4-3658 happen at fluxesdiffering by a factor of 2, which can be explained if the inner disk radius isnot a simple function of the accretion rate, but depends on the previoushistory.

1004.4871	neutron star stiff equation of state derived from cooling phases of the  x-ray burster 4u 1724-307	thermal emission during x-ray bursts is a powerful tool to determine neutronstar masses and radii, if the eddington flux and the apparent radius in thecooling tail can be measured accurately, and distances to the sources areknown. we propose here an improved method of determining the basic stellarparameters using the data from the cooling phase of photospheric radiusexpansion bursts covering a large range of luminosities. because at that phasethe blackbody apparent radius depends only on the spectral hardening factor(color-correction), we suggest to fit the theoretical dependences of thecolor-correction versus flux in eddington units to the observed variations ofthe inverse square root of the apparent blackbody radius with the flux. we showthat spectral variations observed during a long photospheric radius expansionburst from 4u 1724-307 are entirely consistent with the theoreticalexpectations for the passively cooling neutron star atmospheres. our methodallows us to determine both the eddington flux (which is found to be smallerthan the touchdown flux by 15%) and the ratio of the stellar apparent radius tothe distance much more reliably. we then find a lower limit on the neutron starradius of 14 km for masses below 2.2m_sun, independently of the chemicalcomposition. these results suggest that the matter inside neutron stars ischaracterized by a stiff equation of state. we finally show that the apparentblackbody emitting area in the cooling tails of the short bursts from 4u1724-307 is two times smaller than that for the long burst and their evolutiondoes not follow the theory. this makes their usage for determination of theneutron star parameters questionable and casts serious doubts on the results ofprevious works that used for the analysis similar bursts from other sources.[abridged]

1006.2397	theory of compton scattering by anisotropic electrons	compton scattering plays an important role in various astrophysical objectssuch as accreting black holes and neutron stars, pulsars, and relativisticjets, clusters of galaxies as well as the early universe. in most of thecalculations it is assumed that the electrons have isotropic angulardistribution in some frame. however, there are situations where the anisotropymay be significant due to the bulk motions, or anisotropic cooling bysynchrotron radiation, or anisotropic source of seed soft photons. we develophere an analytical theory of compton scattering by anisotropic distribution ofelectrons that can simplify significantly the calculations. assuming that theelectron angular distribution can be represented by a second order polynomialover cosine of some angle (dipole and quadrupole anisotropy), we integrate theexact klein-nishina cross-section over the angles. exact analytical andapproximate formulae valid for any photon and electron energies are derived forthe redistribution functions describing compton scattering of photons witharbitrary angular distribution by anisotropic electrons. the analyticalexpressions for the corresponding photon scattering cross-section on suchelectrons as well as the mean energy of scattered photons, its dispersion andradiation pressure force are also derived. we applied the developed formalismto the accurate calculations of the thermal and kinematic sunyaev-zeldovicheffects for arbitrary electron distributions.

1008.2270	constraining compactness and magnetic field geometry of x-ray pulsars  from the statistics of their pulse profiles	the light curves observed from x-ray pulsars and magnetars reflect theradiation emission pattern, the geometry of the magnetic field, and the neutronstar compactness. we study the statistics of x-ray pulse profiles in order toconstrain the neutron star compactness and the magnetic field geometry. wecollect the data for 124 x-ray pulsars, which are mainly in high-mass x-raybinary systems, and classify their pulse profiles according to the number ofobserved peaks seen during one spin period, dividing them into two classes,single- and double-peaked. we find that the pulsars are distributed aboutequally between both groups. we also compute the probabilities predicted by thetheoretical models of two antipodal point-like spots that emit radiationaccording to the pencil-like emission patterns. these are then compared to theobserved fraction of pulsars in the two classes. assuming a blackbody emissionpattern, it is possible to constrain the neutron star compactness if themagnetic dipole has arbitrary inclinations to the pulsar rotational axis. morerealistic pencil-beam patterns predict that 79% of the pulsars aredouble-peaked independently of their compactness. the theoretical predictionscan be made consistent with the data if the magnetic dipole inclination to therotational axis has an upper limit of 40+/-4 deg. we also discuss the effect oflimited sensitivity of the x-ray instruments to detect weak pulses, whichlowers the number of detected double-peaked profiles and makes the theoreticalpredictions to be consistent with the data even if the magnetic dipole doeshave random inclinations. this shows that the statistics of pulse profiles doesnot allow us to constrain the neutron star compactness. in contrast to theprevious claims by bulik et al. (2003), the data also do not require themagnetic inclination to be confined in a narrow interval.

1012.0439	a self-consistent hybrid comptonization model for broad-band spectra of  accreting supermassive black holes	the nature of the broad-band spectra of supermassive accreting black holes inactive galactic nuclei (agns) is still unknown. the hard x-ray spectra ofseyferts as well as of galactic stellar-mass black holes (gbhs) are wellrepresented by thermal comptonization, but the origin of the seed photons isless certain. the mev tails observed in gbhs provide evidence in favour ofnon-thermal electron tails and it is possible that such electrons are alsopresent in the x-ray emitting regions of agns. using simulations with thekinetic code that self-consistently models electron and photon distributions,we find that the power-law-like x-ray spectra in agns can be explained in termsof the synchrotron self-compton radiation of hybrid thermal/non-thermalelectrons, similarly to the hard/low state of gbhs. under a very broad range ofparameters the model predicts a rather narrow distribution of photon spectralslopes consistent with that observed from liners and seyferts at luminositiesless than 3 per cent of the eddington luminosity. the entire infrared to x-rayspectrum of these objects can be described in terms of our model, suggesting atight correlation between the two energy bands. we show that the recently foundcorrelation between slope and the eddington ratio at higher luminosities can bedescribed by the increasing fraction of disc photons in the emitting region,which may be associated with the decreasing inner radius of the optically thickaccretion disc. the increasing flux of soft photons is also responsible for thetransformation of the electron distribution from nearly thermal to almostcompletely non-thermal. the softer x-ray spectra observed in narrow-lineseyfert galaxies may correspond to non-thermal comptonization of the discphotons, predicting that no cutoff should be observed up to mev energies inthese sources, similarly to the soft-state gbhs.

0709.3043	radiation from relativistic jets in blazars and the efficient  dissipation of their bulk energy via photon breeding	high-energy photons propagating in the magnetised medium with large velocitygradients can mediate energy and momentum exchange. conversion of these photonsinto electron-positron pairs in the field of soft photons with the consequentisotropization and emission of new high-energy photons by compton scatteringcan lead to the runaway cascade of the high-energy photons andelectron-positron pairs fed by the bulk energy of the flow. this is the essenceof the photon breeding mechanism. we study the problem of high-energy emissionof relativistic jets in blazars via photon breeding mechanism using 2dballistic model for the jet with the detailed treatment of particle propagationand interactions. the gamma-ray background of similar energy density asobserved at earth is sufficient to trigger the photon breeding. as a result, ajet can convert up to 80 per cent of its total power into radiation. photonbreeding produces a population of high-energy pairs and predicts the spectra inagreement with observations of blazars (e.g. the blazar sequence). it alsodecelerates the jet at subparsec scales and induces the transversal gradient ofthe lorentz factor which reconcile the discrepancy between the high dopplerfactors determined from the spectra of tev blazars and the low apparentvelocities observed at vlbi scales. the broad angular distribution of radiationpredicted by the mechanism reconciles the observed statistics and luminosityratio of fr i and bl lac objects with the large lorentz factors of the jets aswell as explains the high level of the tev emission in the radio galaxy m87.(abridged)

1105.2744	a synchrotron self-compton -- disk reprocessing model for optical/x-ray  correlation in black hole x-ray binaries	physical picture of the emission mechanisms operating in the x-ray binarieswas put under question by the simultaneous optical/x-ray observations with hightime resolution. the light curves of the two energy bands appeared to beconnected and the cross-correlation functions observed in three black holebinaries exhibited a complicated shape. they show a dip of the optical emissiona few seconds before the x-ray peak and the optical flare just after the x-raypeak. this behavior could not be explained in terms of standard opticalemission candidates (e.g., emission from the cold accretion disk or a jet). wepropose a novel model, which explains the broadband optical to the x-rayspectra and the variability properties. we suggest that the optical emissionconsists of two components: synchrotron radiation from the non-thermalelectrons in the hot accretion flow and the emission produced by reprocessingof the x-rays in the outer part of the accretion disk. the first component isanti-correlated with the x-rays, while the second one is correlated, butdelayed and smeared relative to the x-rays. the interplay of the componentsexplains the complex shape of the cross-correlation function, the features inthe optical power spectral density as well as the time lags.

1105.2762	variation of the gamma-gamma opacity by the he ii lyman continuum  constrains the location of the gamma-ray emission region in the blazar 3c  454.3	we study spectral properties of the brightest gamma-ray blazar 3c454.3 using138 weeks of observations by the fermi gamma-ray space telescope (fermi). weprobe the behaviour of the source as a function of time at different brightnesslevels. the fermi spectra in the gev range can be well described by a wideunderlying lognormal distribution with the photon-photon absorption breaksproduced by the he ii and h i lyman recombination continua (lyc). we find apower-law dependence of the peak energy on flux and discover anti-correlationbetween the column density of the he ii lyc and flux. this implies that thegamma-ray emission zone lies close to the boundary of the high-ionization partof the broad-line region and moves away from the black hole when the fluxincreases. identification of the gamma-ray production with the relativisticjet, implies that the jet is already accelerated at sub-parsec distances fromthe central black hole, which favours the blandford-znajek process as the jetlaunching mechanism.

1107.0180	varying disc-magnetosphere coupling as the origin of pulse profile  variability in sax j1808.4-3658	accreting millisecond pulsars show significant variability of their pulseprofiles, especially at low accretion rates. on the other hand, their x-rayspectra are remarkably similar with not much variability over the course of theoutbursts. for the first time, we have discovered that during the 2008 outburstof sax j1808.4-3658 a major pulse profile change was accompanied by a dramaticvariation of the disc luminosity at almost constant total luminosity. we arguethat this phenomenon is related to a change in the coupling between the neutronstar magnetic field and the accretion disc. the varying size of the pulsarmagnetosphere can influence the accretion curtain geometry and affect the shapeand the size of the hotspots. using this physical picture, we develop aself-consistent model that successfully describes simultaneously the pulseprofile variation as well as the spectral transition. our findings areparticularly important for testing the theories of accretion onto magnetizedneutron stars, better understanding of the accretion geometry as well as thephysics of disc-magnetosphere coupling. the identification that varying hotspotsize can lead to pulse profile changes has profound implications fordetermination of the neutron star masses and radii.

1202.4881	joint spectral-timing modelling of the hard lags in gx 339-4:  constraints on reflection models	the x-ray variations of hard state black hole x-ray binaries above 2 kev show'hard lags', in that the variations at harder energies follow variations atsofter energies, with a time-lag \tau depending on frequency \nu approximatelyas \tau \propto \nu^{-0.7}. several models have so far been proposed to explainthis time delay, including fluctuations propagating through an accretion flow,spectral variations during coronal flares, comptonisation in the extended hotcorona or a jet, or time-delays due to large-scale reflection from theaccretion disc. in principle these models can be used to predict the shape ofthe energy spectrum as well as the frequency-dependence of the time-lags,through the construction of energy-dependent response functions which map theemission as a function of time-delay in the system. here we use this approachto test a simple reflection model for the frequency-dependent lags seen in thehard state of gx 339-4, by simultaneously fitting the model to thefrequency-dependent lags and energy spectrum measured by xmm-newton in 2004 and2009. our model cannot simultaneously fit both the lag and spectral data, sincethe relatively large lags require an extremely flared disc which subtends alarge solid angle to the continuum at large radii, in disagreement with theobserved fe k\alpha emission. therefore, we consider it more likely that thelags &gt; 2 kev are caused by propagation effects in the accretion flow, possiblyrelated to the accretion disc fluctuations which have been observed previously.

1210.0236	hot accretion flow in black hole binaries: a link connecting x-rays to  the infrared	multiwavelength observations of galactic black hole transients have opened anew path to understanding the physics of the innermost parts of the accretionflows. while the processes giving rise to their x-ray continuum have beenstudied extensively, the emission in the optical and infrared (oir) energybands was less investigated and remains poorly understood. the standardaccretion disc, which may contribute to the flux at these wavelengths, is notcapable of explaining a number of observables: the infrared excesses, fast oirvariability and a complicated correlation with the x-rays. it was suggestedthat these energy bands are dominated by the jet emission, however, thisscenario does not work in a number of cases. we propose here an alternative,namely that most of the oir emission is produced by the extended hot accretionflow. in this scenario, the oir bands are dominated by the synchrotronradiation from the non-thermal electrons. an additional contribution isexpected from the outer irradiated part of the accretion disc heated by thex-rays. we discuss properties of the model and compare them to the data. weshow that the hot-flow scenario is consistent with many of the observedspectral data, at the same time naturally explaining x-ray timing properties,fast oir variability and its correlation with the x-rays.

1210.1210	on the association of the ultraluminous x-ray sources in the antennae  galaxies with young stellar clusters	the nature of the ultra-luminous x-ray sources (ulxs) in the nearby galaxiesis a matter of debates. one of the popular hypothesis associates them withaccretion at a sub-eddington rate on to intermediate mass black holes. anotherpossibility is a stellar-mass black hole in a high-mass x-ray binary accretingat super-eddington rates. in this paper we find a highly significantassociation between brightest x-ray sources in the antennae galaxies andstellar clusters. on the other hand, we show that most of the x-ray sources arelocated outside of these clusters. we study clusters associated with the ulxsusing the eso very large telescope spectra and the hubble space telescope datatogether with the theoretical evolutionary tracks and determine their ages tobe below 6 myr. this implies that the ulx progenitor masses certainly exceed 30and for some objects are closer to 100 solar masses. we also estimate the agesof clusters situated close to the less luminous x-ray sources (with luminosityin the range 3x10^38 &lt; l_x &lt; 10^39 erg/s) and find that most of them areyounger than 10 myr, because they are surrounded by strong h$\alpha$ emission.these findings are consistent with the idea that majority of ulxs are massivex-ray binaries that have been ejected in the process of formation of stellarclusters by a few-body encounters and at the same time rules out the proposalthat most of the ulxs are intermediate mass black holes.

1302.6079	young rotation-powered pulsars as ultra-luminous x-ray sources	the aim of the present paper is to investigate a possible contribution of therotation-powered pulsars and pulsar wind nebulae to the population ofultraluminous x-ray sources (ulxs). we first develop an analytical model forthe evolution of the distribution function of pulsars over the spin period andfind both the steady-state and the time-dependent solutions. using the recentresults on the x-ray efficiency dependence on pulsar characteristic age, wethen compute the x-ray luminosity function (xlf) of rotation-powered pulsars.in a general case it has a broken power-law shape with a high luminositycutoff, which depends on the distributions of the birth spin period and themagnetic field.  using the observed xlf of sources in the nearby galaxies and the conditionthat the pulsar xlf does not exceed that, we find the allowed region for theparameters describing the birth period distribution. we find that the meanpulsar period should be greater than 10-40 ms. these results are consistentwith the constraints obtained from the x-ray luminosity of core-collapsesupernovae. we estimate that the contribution of the rotation-powered pulsarsto the ulx population is at a level exceeding 3 per cent. for a wide birthperiod distribution, this fraction grows with luminosity and above 10e40 erg/spulsars can dominate the ulx population.

1304.2633	a reflection model for the cyclotron lines in the spectra of x-ray  pulsars	cyclotron resonance scattering features observed in the spectra of some x-raypulsars show significant changes of the line energy with the pulsar luminosity.at high luminosities, these variations are often associated with the onset andgrowth of the accretion column, which is believed to be the origin of theobserved emission and of the cyclotron lines. however, this scenario inevitablyimplies large gradient of the magnetic field strength within the line-formingregion, which makes the formation of the observed line-like featuresproblematic. moreover, the observed variation of the cyclotron line energy ismuch smaller than could be anticipated for the corresponding luminositychanges. we argue here that a more physically realistic situation is that thecyclotron line forms when the radiation emitted by the accretion column isreflected from the neutron star surface, where the gradient of the magneticfield strength is significantly smaller. we develop here the reflection modeland apply it to explain the observed variations of the cyclotron line energy ina bright x-ray pulsar v 0332+53 over a wide range of luminosities.

1306.6237	on the spreading layer emission in luminous accreting neutron stars	emission of the neutron star surface potentially contains information aboutits size and thus of vital importance for high energy astrophysics. in spite ofthe wealth of data on the emission of luminous accreting neutron stars, theemission of their surfaces is hard to disentangle from their time averagedspectra. a recent x-ray transient source xte j1701-462 has provided a uniquedataset covering the largest ever observed luminosity range for a singlesource. in this paper, we extract the spectrum of the boundary layer betweenthe inner part of the accretion disc and the neutron star surface with the helpof maximally spectral model-independent method. we show compelling evidencesthat the energy spectrum of the boundary layer stays virtually the same overfactor of 20 variations of the source luminosity. it is rather wide and cannotbe described by a single temperature blackbody spectrum, probably because ofthe inhomogeneity of the boundary layer and a spread in the colour temperature.the observed maximum colour temperature of the boundary/spreading layeremission of kt~2.4-2.6 kev is very close to the maximum observed colourtemperature in the photospheric radius expansion x-ray bursts, which is set bythe limiting eddington flux at the neutron star surface. observed stability ofthe boundary layer spectrum and its maximum colour temperature stronglysupports theoretical models of the boundary/spreading layers on surfaces ofluminous accreting neutron stars, which assume the presence of a regionemitting at the local eddington limit. variations in the luminosity in thatcase lead to changes in the size of this region, but affect less the spectralshape. elaboration of this model will provide solid theoretical grounds formeasurements of the neutron star sizes using the emission of theboundary/spreading layers of luminous accreting neutron stars.

1312.2761	modelling spectral and timing properties of accreting black holes: the  hybrid hot flow paradigm	the general picture that emerged by the end of 1990s from a large set ofoptical and x-ray, spectral and timing data was that the x-rays are produced inthe innermost hot part of the accretion flow, while the optical/infrared (oir)emission is mainly produced by the irradiated outer thin accretion disc. recentmultiwavelength observations of galactic black hole transients show that thesituation is not so simple. fast variability in the oir band, oir excessesabove the thermal emission and a complicated interplay between the x-ray andthe oir light curves imply that the oir emitting region is much more compact.one of the popular hypotheses is that the jet contributes to the oir emissionand even is responsible for the bulk of the x-rays. however, this scenario islargely ad hoc and is in contradiction with many previously established facts.alternatively, the hot accretion flow, known to be consistent with the x-rayspectral and timing data, is also a viable candidate to produce the oirradiation. the hot-flow scenario naturally explains the power-law like oirspectra, fast oir variability and its complex relation to the x-rays if the hotflow contains non-thermal electrons (even in energetically negligiblequantities), which are required by the presence of the mev tail in cyg x-1. thepresence of non-thermal electrons also lowers the equilibrium electrontemperature in the hot flow model to &lt;100 kev, making it more consistent withobservations. here we argue that any viable model should simultaneously explaina large set of spectral and timing data and show that the hybrid(thermal/non-thermal) hot flow model satisfies most of the constraints.

1405.2663	the effect of accretion on the measurement of neutron star mass and  radius in the low-mass x-ray binary 4u 1608-52	spectral measurements of thermonuclear (type-i) x-ray bursts from low massx-ray binaries have been used to measure neutron star (ns) masses and radii. anumber of systematic issues affect such measurements and have raised concernsas to the robustness of the methods. we present analysis of the x-ray emissionfrom bursts observed from 4u 1608-52 at various persistent fluxes. we find astrong dependence of the burst properties on the flux and spectral hardness ofthe persistent emission before burst. bursts occurring during the low-accretionrate (hard) state exhibit evolution of the black body normalisation consistentwith the theoretical predictions of ns atmosphere models. however, burstsoccurring during the high-accretion rate (soft) state show roughly constantnormalisation, which is inconsistent with the ns atmosphere models andtherefore these bursts cannot be easily used to determine ns parameters. weanalyse the hard-state burst to put the lower limit on the neutron star radiusin 4u 1608-52 of 13 km (for masses 1.2-2.4 m$_\odot$). the best agreement withthe theoretical ns mass-radius relations is achieved for source distances inthe range 3.1-3.7 kpc. we expect that the radius limit will be 10 per centlower if spectral models including rapid rotation are used instead.

1406.0322	the influence of accretion geometry on the spectral evolution during  thermonuclear (type-i) x-ray bursts	neutron star (ns) masses and radii can be estimated from observations ofphotospheric radius-expansion x-ray bursts, provided the chemical compositionof the photosphere, the spectral colour-correction factors in the observedluminosity range, and the emission area during the bursts are known. byanalysing 246 x-ray bursts observed by the rossi x-ray timing explorer from 11low-mass x-ray binaries, we find a dependence between the persistent spectralproperties and the time evolution of the black body normalisation during thebursts. all ns atmosphere models predict that the colour-correction factordecreases in the early cooling phase when the luminosity first drops below thelimiting eddington value, leading to a characteristic pattern of variability inthe measured blackbody normalisation. however, the model predictions agree withthe observations for most bursts occurring in hard, low-luminosity, 'island'spectral states, but rarely during soft, high-luminosity, 'banana' states. theobserved behaviour may be attributed to the accretion flow, which influencescooling of the ns preferentially during the soft state bursts. this resultimplies that only the bursts occurring in the hard, low-luminosity spectralstates can be reliably used for ns mass and radius determination.

1408.0793	the mystery of spectral breaks: lyman continuum absorption by  photon-photon pair production in the fermi gev spectra of bright blazars	we reanalyze fermi/lat gamma-ray spectra of bright blazars with a higherphoton statistics than in previous works and with new pass 7 datarepresentation. in the spectra of the brightest blazar 3c 454.3 and possibly of4c +21.35 we detect breaks at 5 gev (in the rest frame) associated with thephoton-photon pair production absorption by he ii lyman continuum (lyc). wealso detect confident breaks at 20 gev associated with hydrogen lyc both in theindividual spectra and in the stacked redshift-corrected spectrum of severalbright blazars. the detected breaks in the stacked spectra univocally provethat they are associated with atomic ultraviolet emission features of thequasar broad-line region (blr). the dominance of the absorption by hydrogen lycomplex over he ii, rather small detected optical depth, and the break energyconsistent with the head-on collisions with lyc photons imply that thegamma-ray emission site is located within the blr, but most of the blr emissioncomes from a flat disk-like structure producing little opacity. alternatively,the lyc emission region size might be larger than the blr size measured fromreverberation mapping, and/or the gamma-ray emitting region is extended. thesesolutions would resolve a long-standing issue how the multi-hundred gev photonscan escape from the emission zone without being absorbed by softer photons.

1409.6457	the critical accretion luminosity for magnetized neutron stars	the accretion flow around x-ray pulsars with a strong magnetic field isfunnelled by the field to relatively small regions close to the magnetic polesof the neutron star (ns), the hotspots. during strong outbursts regularlyobserved from some x-ray pulsars, the x-ray luminosity can be so high, that theemerging radiation is able to stop the accreting matter above the surface viaradiation-dominated shock, and the accretion column begins to rise. this borderluminosity is usually called the "critical luminosity". here we calculate thecritical luminosity as a function of the ns magnetic field strength $b$ usingexact compton scattering cross section in strong magnetic field. influence ofthe resonant scattering and photon polarization is taken into account for thefirst time. we show that the critical luminosity is not a monotonic function ofthe b-field. it reaches a minimum of a few 10^{36} erg s^{-1} when thecyclotron energy is about 10 kev and a considerable amount of photons from ahotspot have energy close to the cyclotron resonance. for small b, thisluminosity is about 10^{37} erg s^{-1}, nearly independent of the parameters.it grows for the b-field in excess of 10^{12} g because of the drop in theeffective cross-section of interaction below the cyclotron energy. weinvestigate how different types of the accretion flow and geometries of theaccretion channel affect the results and demonstrate that the general behaviourof the critical luminosity on b-field is very robust. the obtained results areshown to be in a good agreement with the available observational data andprovide a necessary ground for the interpretation of upcoming high quality datafrom the currently operating and planned x-ray telescopes.

1409.6504	colours of black holes: infrared flares from the hot accretion disc in  xte j1550-564	outbursts of the black hole (bh) x-ray binaries are dramatic events occurringin our galaxy approximately once a year. they are detected by the x-raytelescopes and often monitored at longer wavelengths. we analyse the x-ray andoptical/infrared (oir) light curves of the bh binary xte j1550-564 during the2000 outburst. by using the observed extreme colours as well as thecharacteristic decay time-scales of the oir and x-ray light curves, we putstrong constraints on the extinction towards the source. we accurately separatethe contributions to the oir flux of the irradiated accretion disc and anon-thermal component. we show that the oir non-thermal component appearsduring the x-ray state transitions both during the rising and the decaying partof the outburst at nearly the same x-ray hardness but at luminosities differingby a factor of 3. the line marking the quenching/recovery of the non-thermalcomponent at the x-ray hardness-flux diagram seems to coincide with the "jetline" that marks the presence of the compact radio jet. the inferred spectralshape and the evolution of the non-thermal component during the outburst,however, are not consistent with the jet origin, but are naturally explained interms of the hybrid hot flow scenario, where non-thermal electrons emitsynchrotron radiation in the oir band. this implies a close, possibly causalconnection between the presence of the hot flow and the compact jet. we findthat the non-thermal component is hardening during the hard state at thedecaying stage of the outburst, which indicates that the accelerationefficiency is a steep function of radius at low accretion rate.

1409.6523	reprocessing model for the optical quasi-periodic oscillations in black  hole binaries	a number of black hole x-ray transients show quasi-periodic oscillations(qpos) in the optical (ultraviolet) and x-ray bands at the same frequency,which challenge models for production of radiation at these wavelengths. wepropose a model where the optical radiation is modulated by the oscillatingx-ray flux resulting in varying irradiation of the outer parts of the accretiondisc. the proposed qpo mechanism inevitably takes place in the systems withsufficiently small ratio of the outer disc radius to the qpo period. we showthat, unlike in the case of the aperiodic variability, it is not possible toobtain the optical qpo profiles from those observed in the x-rays through thetransfer function, because of different x-ray signals seen by the disc and bythe observer. we demonstrate that with the increasing qpo frequency, occurringat the rising phase of the x-ray outburst, the rms should be constant forsufficiently low frequencies, then to increase reaching the peak and finally todrop substantially when the qpo period becomes comparable to the light-crossingtime to the outer disc. we predict that the qpo rms in this model shouldincrease towards shorter wavelengths and this fact can be used to distinguishit from other qpo mechanisms.

1505.00015	polarization modulation from lense-thirring precession in x-ray binaries	it has long been recognised that quasi-periodic oscillations (qpos) in thex-ray light curves of accreting black hole and neutron star binaries have thepotential to be powerful diagnostics of strong field gravity. however, thispotential cannot be fulfilled without a working theoretical model, which hasremained elusive. perhaps the most promising model associates the qpo withlense-thirring precession of the inner accretion flow, with the changes inviewing angle and doppler boosting modulating the flux over the course of aprecession cycle. here, we consider the polarization signature of a precessinginner accretion flow. we use simple assumptions about the comptonizationprocess generating the emitted spectrum and take all relativistic effects intoaccount, parallel transporting polarization vectors towards the observer alongnull geodesics in the kerr metric. we find that both the degree of linearpolarization and the polarization angle should be modulated on the qpofrequency. we calculate the predicted absolute rms variability amplitude of thepolarization degree and angle for a specific model geometry. we find that itshould be possible to detect these modulations for a reasonable fraction ofparameter space with a future x-ray polarimeter such as nasa's polarizationspectroscopic telescope array (polstar: the satellite incarnation of the recentballoon experiment x-calibur).

1507.01525	models of neutron star atmospheres enriched with nuclear burning ashes	low-mass x-ray binaries hosting neutron stars (ns) exhibit thermonuclear(type-i) x-ray bursts, which are powered by unstable nuclear burning of heliumand/or hydrogen into heavier elements deep in the ns "ocean". in some cases theburning ashes may rise from the burning depths up to the ns photosphere byconvection, leading to the appearance of the metal absorption edges in thespectra, which then force the emergent x-ray burst spectra to shift towardlower energies. these effects may have a substantial impact on the colorcorrection factor $f_c$ and the dilution factor $w$, the parameters of thediluted blackbody model $f_e \approx w b_e(f_c t_{eff})$ that is commonly usedto describe the emergent spectra from nss. the aim of this paper is to quantifyhow much the metal enrichment can change these factors. we have developed a newns atmosphere modeling code, which has a few important improvements compared toour previous code required by inclusion of the metals. the opacities and theinternal partition functions (used in the ionization fraction calculations) arenow taken into account for all atomic species. in addition, the code is nowparallelized to counter the increased computational load. we compute a detailedgrid of atmosphere models with different exotic chemical compositions thatmimic the presence of the burning ashes. from the emerging model spectra wecompute the color correction factors $f_c$ and the dilution factors $w$ thatcan then be compared to the observations. we find that the metals may change$f_c$ by up to about 40%, which is enough to explain the scatter seen in theblackbody radius measurements. the presented models open up the possibility fordetermining ns mass and radii more accurately, and may also act as a tool toprobe the nuclear burning mechanisms of x-ray bursts.

1509.05628	positive correlation between the cyclotron line energy and luminosity in  sub-critical x-ray pulsars: doppler effect in the accretion channel	cyclotron resonance scattering features observed in the spectra of some x-raypulsars show significant changes of the line centroid energy with the pulsarluminosity. whereas for bright sources above the so called critical luminositythese variations are established to be connected with the appearance of thehigh accretion column above the neutron star surface, at low, sub-criticalluminosities the nature of the variations (but with the opposite sign) has notbeen discussed widely. we argue here that the cyclotron line is formed when theradiation from a hotspot propagates through the plasma falling with a mildlyrelativistic velocity onto the neutron star surface. the position of thecyclotron resonance is determined by the doppler effect. the change of thecyclotron line position in the spectrum with luminosity is caused by variationsof the velocity profile in the line-forming region affected by the radiationpressure force. the presented model has several characteristic features: (i)the line centroid energy is positively correlated with the luminosity; (ii) theline width is positively correlated with the luminosity as well; (iii) theposition and the width of the cyclotron absorption line are variable over thepulse phase; (iv) the line has a more complicated shape than widely usedlorentzian or gaussian profiles; (v) the phase-resolved cyclotron line centroidenergy and the width are negatively and positively correlated with the pulseintensity, respectively. the predictions of the proposed theory are comparedwith the variations of the cyclotron line parameters in the x-ray pulsar gx304-1 over a wide range of sub-critical luminosities as seen by the integralobservatory.

0806.0324	photon breeding mechanism in relativistic jets: astrophysical  implications	photon breeding in relativistic jets involves multiplication of high-energyphotons propagating from the jet to the external environment and back with theconversion into electron-positron pairs. the exponential growth of the energydensity of these photons is a super-critical process powered by the bulk energyof the jet. the efficient deceleration of the jet outer layers creates astructured jet morphology with the fast spine and slow sheath. in initiallyfast and high-power jets even the spine can be decelerated efficiently leadingto very high radiative efficiencies of conversion of the jet bulk energy intoradiation. the decelerating, structured jets have angular distribution ofradiation significantly broader than that predicted by a simple blob model witha constant lorentz factor. this reconciles the discrepancy between the highdoppler factors determined by the fits to the spectra of tev blazars and thelow apparent velocities observed at vlbi scales as well as the low jet lorentzfactors required by the observed statistics and luminosity ratio offanaroff-riley i radio galaxies and bl lac objects. photon breeding produces apopulation of high-energy leptons in agreement with the constraints on theelectron injection function required by spectral fits of the tev blazars.relativistic pairs created outside the jet and emitting gamma-rays by inversecompton process might explain the relatively high level of the tev emissionfrom the misaligned jet in the radio galaxies. the mechanism reproduces basicspectral features observed in blazars including the blazar sequence (shift ofthe spectral peaks towards lower energies with increasing luminosity). themechanism is very robust and can operate in various environments characterisedby the high photon density.

astro-ph;0401210	water masers in dusty environments	we study in details a pumping mechanism for the lambda=1.35 cm masertransition 6_16 -&gt; 5_23 in ortho-water based on the difference between gas anddust temperatures. the upper maser level is populated radiatively through 4_14-&gt; 5_05 and 5_05 -&gt; 6_16 transitions. the heat sink is realized by absorbingthe 45 mum photons, corresponding to the 5_23 -&gt; 4_14 transition, by cold dust.we compute the inversion of maser level populations in the optically thickmedium as a function of the hydrogen concentration, the gas-to-dust mass ratio,and the difference between the gas and the dust temperatures. the main resultsof numerical simulations are interpreted in terms of a simplified four-levelmodel. we show that the maser strength depends mostly on the product ofhydrogen concentration and the dust-to-water mass ratio but not on the sizedistribution of the dust particles or their type. we also suggest approximateformulae that describe accurately the inversion and can be used for fastcalculations of the maser luminosity. depending on the gas temperature, themaximum maser luminosity is reached when the water concentration n_water ~10^6-10^7 cm^-3 times the dust-to-hydrogen mass ratio, and the inversioncompletely disappears at density just an order of magnitude larger. for thedust temperature of 130 k, the 6_16 -&gt; 5_23 transition becomes inverted alreadyat the temperature difference of delta t ~1 k, while other possible masingtransitions require a larger delta t &gt; 30 k. we identify the region of theparameter space where other ortho- and para-water masing transitions canappear.

astro-ph;0405488	gamma-ray bursts from synchrotron self-compton emission	the emission mechanism of the gamma-ray bursts (grbs) is still a matter ofdebates. the standard synchrotron energy spectrum of cooling electrons f_e ~e^{-1/2} is much too soft to account for the majority of the observed spectralslopes. an alternative in the form of quasi-thermal comptonization in a highcompactness source has difficulties in reproducing the peak of the observedphoton distribution below a few hundred kev. we show here that for typicalparameters expected in the grb ejecta the observed spectra in the 20-1000 kevbatse energy range can be produced by inverse compton scattering of thesynchrotron radiation in a partially self-absorbed regime. if the particles arecontinuously accelerated/heated over the life-time of a source rather thanbeing instantly injected, a prominent peak develops in their distribution at alorentz factor gamma ~ 30-100, where synchrotron and inverse-compton losses arebalanced by acceleration and heating due to synchrotron self-absorption. thesynchrotron peak should be observed at 10-100 ev, while the self-absorbedlow-energy tail with f_e ~ e^2 can produce the prompt optical emission (like inthe case of grb 990123). the first compton scattering radiation by nearlymonoenergetic electrons can then be as hard as f_e ~ e^1 reproducing thehardness of most of the observed grb spectra. the second compton peak should beobserved in the high energy gamma-ray band, possibly being responsible for theemission detected by egret in grb 941017. a significant electron-positron pairproduction reduces the available energy per particle, moving the spectral peaksto lower energies as the burst progresses. the regime is very robust, operatesin a broad range of parameter space and can explain most of the observed grbspectra and their temporal evolution.

astro-ph;0411716	physics of accretion in the millisecond pulsar xte j1751-305	we have undertaken an extensive study of x-ray data from the accretingmillisecond pulsar xte j1751-305 observed by rxte and xmm-newton during its2002 outburst. in all aspects this source is similar to a prototypicalmillisecond pulsar sax j1808.4-3658, except for the higher peak luminosity of13 per cent of eddington, and the optical depth of the hard x-ray source largerby factor ~2. its broad-band x-ray spectrum can be modelled by threecomponents. we interpret the two soft components as thermal emission from acolder (kt ~ 0.6 kev) accretion disc and a hotter (~1 kev) spot on the neutronstar surface. we interpret the hard component as thermal comptonization inplasma of temperature ~40 kev and optical depth of ~1.5 in a slab geometry. theplasma is heated by the accretion shock as the material collimated by themagnetic field impacts on to the surface. the seed photons for comptonizationare provided by the hotspot, not by the disc. the compton reflection is weakand the disc is probably truncated into an optically thin flow above themagnetospheric radius. rotation of the emission region with the star creates analmost sinusoidal pulse profile with rms amplitude of 3.3 per cent. theenergy-dependent soft phase lags can be modelled by two pulsating componentsshifted in phase, which is naturally explained by a different character ofemission of the optically thick spot and optically thin shock combined with theaction of the doppler boosting.

astro-ph;0502423	broad-band spectra of cyg x-1 and correlations between spectral  characteristics	we present the results of spectral analysis of 42 simultaneous broad-bandginga--osse and rxte--osse observations of cyg x-1 carried out in 1991 and1996--1999. the hardest spectra in our sample in the energy range from 3 to\~1000 kev can be well described by thermal comptonization model withreflection from the cold disc, while the rest of the spectra are more complexand require an additional component below 10 kev. we consider a number ofphysically realistic models to describe the shape of the e&lt;10 kev excess. theadditional soft component can result from thermal comptonization by electronswith a low compton parameter, or can be a part of a nonthermal, power-law likeemission extending above 1 mev. we study correlations between parametersobtained from the spectral fits with different models. we confirm a generalcorrelation between the photon index $\gamma$ and the amplitude of reflectionr. we find that simple phenomenological models (like power-law plus comptonreflection) applied to the narrow band (3--20 kev) data overestimated thevalues of r and $\gamma$, although the simple models did rank correctly thespectra according to r and $\gamma$. the dynamic corona model provides asatisfactory description of the observed correlation, while the hot inner discmodels have problems in reproducing it quantitatively. we do not findsignificant correlation between the electron temperature and other spectralparameters, while the optical depth of the hot medium seems to decrease whenthe spectrum becomes softer. it is also shown that spectral parameters are wellcorrelated with the timing characteristics of the source.

astro-ph;0502424	gamma-ray burst spectra from continuously accelerated electrons	we discuss here constraints on the particle acceleration models from theobserved gamma-ray bursts spectra. the standard synchrotron shock model assumesthat some fraction of available energy is given instantaneously to theelectrons which are injected at high lorentz factor. the emitted spectrum inthat case corresponds to the spectrum of cooling electrons, f_\nu ~ \nu^{-1/2},is much too soft to account for the majority of the observed spectral slopes.we show that continuous heating of electrons over the life-time of a source isneeded to produce hard observed spectra. in this model, a prominent peakdevelops in the electron distribution at energy which is a strong function ofthomson optical depth \tau_t of heated electrons (pairs). at \tau_t&gt;1, atypical electron lorentz factor \gamma ~ 1-2 and quasi-thermal comptonizationoperates. it produces spectrum peaking at a too high energy. optical depthsbelow 10^{-4} would be difficult to imagine in any physical scenario. at \tau_t=10^{-4}-10^{-2}, \gamma ~ 30-100 and synchrotron self-compton radiation is themain emission mechanism. the synchrotron peak should be observed at 10--100 ev,while the self-absorbed low-energy tail with f_\nu ~ \nu^2 can produce theprompt optical emission (like in the case of grb 990123). the first comptonscattering radiation by nearly monoenergetic electrons peaks in the batseenergy band and can be as hard as f_\nu ~ \nu^1 reproducing the hardness ofmost of the observed grb spectra. the second compton peak should be observed inthe high-energy gamma-ray band, possibly being responsible for the 10-100 mevemission detected in grb 941017. a significant electron-positron pairproduction reduces the available energy per particle, moving spectral peaks tolower energies as the burst progresses.

0809.0341	orbital and superorbital variability and their coupling in x-ray  binaries	we review x-ray flux modulation from x-ray binaries on time scalescorresponding to the orbital period and those at longer time scales (so calledsuperorbital). those modulations provide a powerful tool to constrain geometryof the accretion flow. the most common cause of the superorbital variabilityappears to be precession. we then discuss two specific examples of discoveriesof a coupling between the two types of variability and their physicalinterpretation. one is cyg x-1, a black-hole binary with a high-mass companion,in which case we find the presence of an accretion bulge formed by collision ofthe stellar wind with the outer edge of the precessing accretion disc. theother is 4u 1820-303, a neutron star accreting from a low-mass white dwarf, inwhich case we interpret the superorbital variability as accretion ratemodulation induced by interactions in a triple stellar system. then, thevarying accretion rate leads to changes of the size of the accretion bulge inthat system, obscuring the centrally-emitted x-rays.

astro-ph;0601689	spectra of the spreading layers on the neutron star surface and  constraints on the neutron star equation of state	spectra of the spreading layers on the neutron star surface are calculated onthe basis of the inogamov-sunyaev model taking into account general relativitycorrection to the surface gravity and considering various chemical compositionof the accreting matter. local (at a given latitude) spectra are similar to thex-ray burst spectra and are described by a diluted black body. total spreadinglayer spectra are integrated accounting for the light bending, gravitationalredshift, and the relativistic doppler effect and aberration. they dependslightly on the inclination angle and on the luminosity. these spectra also canbe fitted by a diluted black body with the color temperature depending mainlyon a neutron star compactness. owing to the fact that the flux from thespreading layer is close to the critical eddington, we can put constraints on aneutron star radius without the need to know precisely the emitting region areaor the distance to the source. the boundary layer spectra observed in theluminous low-mass x-ray binaries, and described by a black body of colortemperature tc=2.4+-0.1 kev, restrict the neutron star radii to r=14.8+- 1.5 km(for a 1.4-msun star and solar composition of the accreting matter), whichcorresponds to the hard equation of state.

astro-ph;0604344	a photon breeding mechanism for the high-energy emission of relativistic  jets	we propose a straightforward and efficient mechanism for the high-energyemission of relativistic astrophysical jets associated with an exchange ofinteracting high-energy photons between the jet and the external environment.physical processes playing the main role in this mechanism areelectron-positron pair production by photons and the inverse comptonscattering. this scenario has been studied analytically as well as withnumerical simulations demonstrating that a relativistic jet (with the lorentzfactor larger than 3--4) moving through the sufficiently dense, soft radiationfield inevitably undergoes transformation into a luminous state. the processhas a supercritical character: the high-energy photons breed exponentiallybeing fed directly by the bulk kinetic energy of the jet. eventually particlesfeed back on the fluid dynamics and the jet partially decelerates. as a result,a significant fraction (at least 20 per cent) of the jet kinetic energy isconverted into radiation mainly in the mev -- gev energy range. the mechanismmaybe responsible for the bulk of the emission of relativistic jets in activegalactic nuclei, microquasars and gamma-ray bursts.

astro-ph;0605568	a warped m=2 water maser disc in v778 cyg?	the silicate carbon star v778 cyg is a source of 22 ghz water maser emissionwhich was recently resolved by merlin. observations revealed an elongateds-like structure along which the velocities of the maser features show a lineardependence on the impact parameter. this is consistent with a doubly-warped m=2disc observed edge-on. water masers and silicate dust emission (detected byiras and iso) have a common origin in o-rich material and are likely to beco-located in the disc. we propose a detailed self-consistent model of a masinggas-dust disc around a companion to the carbon star in a binary system, whichallows us to estimate the companion mass of 1.7 +- 0.1 m_sun, the disc radiusof 40 +-3 au and the distance between companions of about 80 au. using adust-gas coupling model for water masing, we calculate the maser powerself-consistently, accounting for both the gas and the dust energy balances.comparing the simulation results with the observational data, we deduce themain physical parameters of the masing disc, such as the gas and dusttemperatures and their densities. we also present an analysis of the stabilityof the disc.

astro-ph;0609274	super-critically accreting stellar-mass black holes as ultraluminous  x-ray sources	we derive the luminosity-temperature relation for the super-criticallyaccreting black holes (bhs) and compare it to the data on ultraluminous x-raysources (ulxs). at super-eddington accretion rates, an outflow forms within thespherization radius. we construct the accretion disc model accounting for theadvection and the outflow, and compute characteristic disc temperatures. thebolometric luminosity exceeds the eddington luminosity l_edd by a logarithmicfactor 1+0.6 ln mdot (where mdot is the accretion rate in eddington units) andthe wind kinetic luminosity is close to l_edd. the apparent luminosity for theface-on observer is 2-7 times higher because of geometrical beaming. such anobserver has a direct view of the inner hot accretion disc, which has a peaktemperature t_max of a few kev in stellar-mass bhs. the emitted spectrumextends as a power-law f_e ~ e**{-1} down to the temperature at thespherization radius t_sp ~ mdot**(-1/2) kev. we associate t_max with a few kevspectral components and t_sp with the soft, 0.1-0.2 kev components observed inulxs. an edge-on observer sees only the soft emission from the extendedenvelope, with the photosphere radius exceeding the spherization radius byorders of magnitude. the dependence of the photosphere temperature onluminosity is consistent with that observed in the super-eddington accretingbhs ss 433 and v4641 sgr. strong outflows combined with the large intrinsicx-ray luminosity of the central bh explain naturally the presence of thephotoionized nebulae around ulxs. an excellent agreement between the model andthe observational data strongly argues in favour of ulxs being super-criticallyaccreting, stellar-mass bhs similar to ss 433, but viewed close to the symmetryaxis.

astro-ph;9506035	on the geometry of the x-ray emitting region in seyfert galaxies	for the first time, detailed radiative transfer calculations of comptonizedx-ray and gamma-ray radiation in a hot pair plasma above a cold accretion diskare performed using two independent codes and methods. the simulations includeboth energy and pair balance as well as reprocessing of the x- and gamma-raysby the cold disk. we study both plane-parallel coronae as well as activedissipation regions having shapes of hemispheres and pill boxes located on thedisk surface. it is shown, contrary to earlier claims, that plane-parallelcoronae in pair balance have difficulties in selfconsistently reproducing theranges of 2-20 kev spectral slopes, high energy cutoffs, and compactnessesinferred from observations of type 1 seyfert galaxies. instead, theobservations are consistent with the x-rays coming from a number of individualactive regions located on the surface of the disk.  a number of effects such as anisotropic compton scattering, the reflectionhump, feedback to the soft photon source by reprocessing, and an active regionin pair equilibrium all conspire to produce the observed ranges of x-rayslopes, high energy cutoffs, and compactnesses. the spread in spectral x-rayslopes can be due to a spread in the properties of the active regions such astheir compactnesses and their elevations above the disk surface. simplifiedmodels invoking isotropic comptonization in spherical clouds are no longersufficient when interpreting the data.

astro-ph;9612104	x-rays and gamma-rays from accretion flows onto black holes in seyferts  and x-ray binaries	we review observations and theoretical models of x-ray/gamma-ray spectra ofradio-quiet seyfert galaxies and of galactic black-hole candidates (in the hardspectral state). the observed spectra share all their basic components: anunderlying power law, a compton-reflection component with an fe k-alpha line,low-energy absorption by intervening cold matter, and a high-energy cutoffabove ~ 200 kev. the x-ray energy spectral index, alpha, is typically in therange ~ 0.8-1 in seyfert spectra from ginga, exosat and osse. the hard-statespectra of black-hole candidates cyg x-1 and gx 339-4 from simultaneousginga/osse observations have alpha ~ 0.6-0.8. the compton-reflection componentcorresponds to cold matter (e.g., inner or outer parts of an accretion disk)covering a solid angle of ~ (0.4-1) times 2 pi as seen from the x-ray source.the spectra are cut off in soft gamma-rays above ~ 200 kev. the broad-bandspectra of both seyferts and black-hole sources are well fitted by comptonupscattering of soft photons in thermal plasmas. our fits yield the thermalplasma temperature of ~ 100 kev and the thomson optical depth of tau 1. afraction of the luminosity emitted nonthermally appears to be small and it canbe constrained to &lt; 15% in the seyfert galaxy ngc 4151. the spectra are cut offbefore 511 kev, which is strongly suggestive of a thermostatic role of e+e-pair production in constraining the temperature and optical depth of thesources. the source geometry is compatible with a patchy corona above a colddisk in seyferts, but not in cyg x-1. in the latter, the relative weakness ofreflection is compatible with reflection of emission of a hot inner disk fromouter disk regions.

astro-ph;9701171	average properties of the time behaviour of gamma-ray bursts	the average peak-aligned profile of all bursts detected by batse withsufficient data quality has a simple ``stretched'' exponential shape, f ~exp[-(t/t_0)^{1/3}], where $t$ is the time measured from the time for the peakflux of the event, and $t_0$ is a time constant. we study the behaviour of$t_0$ of both the post-peak and the pre-peak slopes of the average time profileas a function of the peak brightness range of the burst sample. we found thatthe post-peak slope shows time dilation when comparing bright and dim bursts,while the pre-peak slope hardly changes. thus dimmer bursts have a differentshape -- they are more asymmetric. this shape-brightness correlation isobserved at a 99.6% confidence level. such a correlation has a naturalexplanation within the pulse avalanche model, which is briefly described.complex events, consisting of many pulses are more symmetric and areintrinsically brighter. bursts consisting of one or a few pulses areintrinsically weaker and more asymmetric. for such a correlation to beobservable requires that the luminosity distance distribution of grbs to bedifferent from a power-law.

astro-ph;9708167	the variable x/gamma-ray spectrum of the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 7172	a broad band x-, gamma-ray spectral study of the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 7172 ispresented. we use our asca observations from may 1995 and combine these withthe cgro osse data from march 1995. the only seyfert 2 galaxy previously tohave been modelled over such a broad spectral range is ngc 4945. we find thatthe most probable model for the data is an absorbed power law, being affectedby a high energy exponential cut-off. the power law is flat with gamma = 1.54\pm 0.13, while n_h = (8.1 \pm 0.6) 10^{22} cm$^{-2}$. an fe k$\alpha$ emissionline is not required by the fits. the observed flux in the 2-10 kev range isf_{2-10} = (4.75\pm 0.09) 10^{-11} erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, which corresponds toa small increase since the ginga measurement in october 1989. the spectralindex of the underlying power law of ngc 7172 appears actually to have variedfrom 1.85 to 1.5 since the ginga observations in 1989. the e-folding energy isrelatively well constrained and lies at 140 ^{+310} _{-70} kev. we note,however, that the cgro osse spectral shape appears to be variable on a timescale of weeks.

astro-ph;9709113	a complexity-brightness correlation in gamma ray bursts	we observe strong correlations between the temporal properties of gamma raybursts (grbs) and their apparent peak brightness. the strongest effect (with asignificance level of 10^{-6}) is the difference between the brightnessdistributions of simple bursts (dominated by a single smooth pulse) and complexbursts (consisting of overlapping pulses). the latter has a break at a peakflux of 1.5 ph/cm^2/s, while the distribution of simple bursts is smooth downto the batse threshold. we also observe brightness dependent variations in theshape of the average peak aligned time profile (atp) of grbs. the decayingslope of the atp shows time dilation when comparing bright and dim bursts whilethe rising slope hardly changes. both slopes of the atp are deformed for weakbursts as compared to strong bursts. the interpretation of these effects issimple: a complex burst where a number of independent pulses overlap in timeappears intrinsically stronger than a simple burst. then the batse sample ofcomplex bursts covers larger redshifts where some cosmological factor causesthe break in the peak brightness distribution. this break could correspond tothe peak in the star formation rate that was recently shown to occur at aredshift of z~1.5.

astro-ph;9711316	unification of spectral states of accreting black holes	several galactic black holes show transitions between spectral states. inthis paper we present a unifying radiation transfer model that can fit thespectral data in both states. we fit individual broad-band (from 1 kev up to 4mev) spectral data for the "hard" and "soft" states of cyg x-1 using anemission model where a central comptonizing corona/cloud is illuminated by thesoft photon emission from a cold disk. we assume that the energy is injected tothe corona by two channels: a non-thermal one that injects energetic electronsinto the coronal region, and a thermal one that heats injected and ambientelectrons once they cool sufficiently to form a maxwellian distribution, i.e.,we consider a hybrid thermal/non-thermal model. using simple scaling laws forthe luminosity of the cold disk, the thermal dissipation/heating rate in thecorona, and the rate of energy injection from a non-thermal source, all asfunctions of radius of the corona, we explain the hard-to-soft transition asthe result of a decrease in the size of the corona and the inner radius of thecold disk by a factor ~ 5. for the case of cyg x-1, we show that the bolometricluminosity of the source (mass accretion rate) does not change significantlyduring the transition, and thus the transition is probably the result of a diskinstability.
