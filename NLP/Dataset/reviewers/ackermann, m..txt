0912.2040	the spectral energy distribution of fermi bright blazars	(abridged) we have conducted a detailed investigation of the broad-bandspectral properties of the \gamma-ray selected blazars of the fermi lat brightagn sample (lbas). by combining our accurately estimated fermi gamma-rayspectra with swift, radio, infra-red, optical and other hard x-ray/gamma-raydata, collected within three months of the lbas data taking period, we wereable to assemble high-quality and quasi-simultaneous spectral energydistributions (sed) for 48 lbas blazars.the sed of these gamma-ray sources issimilar to that of blazars discovered at other wavelengths, clearly showing, inthe usual log $\nu $ - log $\nu$ f$_\nu$ representation, the typical broad-bandspectral signatures normally attributed to a combination of low-energysynchrotron radiation followed by inverse compton emission of one or morecomponents. we have used these seds to characterize the peak intensity of boththe low and the high-energy components. the results have been used to deriveempirical relationships that estimate the position of the two peaks from thebroad-band colors (i.e. the radio to optical and optical to x-ray spectralslopes) and from the gamma-ray spectral index. our data show that thesynchrotron peak frequency $\nu_p^s$ is positioned between 10$^{12.5}$ and10$^{14.5}$ hz in broad-lined fsrqs and between $10^{13}$ and $10^{17}$ hz infeatureless bl lacertae objects.we find that the gamma-ray spectral slope isstrongly correlated with the synchrotron peak energy and with the x-rayspectral index, as expected at first order in synchrotron - inverse comptonscenarios. however, simple homogeneous, one-zone, synchrotron self compton(ssc) models cannot explain most of our seds, especially in the case of fsrqsand low energy peaked (lbl) bl lacs.

1001.4531	observations of milky way dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the fermi-lat  detector and constraints on dark matter models	we report on the observations of 14 dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the fermigamma-ray space telescope taken during the first 11 months of survey modeoperations. the fermi telescope provides a new opportunity to test particledark matter models through the expected gamma-ray emission produced by pairannihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (wimps). local group dwarfspheroidal galaxies, the largest galactic substructures predicted by the colddark matter scenario, are attractive targets for such indirect searches fordark matter because they are nearby and among the most extreme dark matterdominated environments. no significant gamma-ray emission was detected above100 mev from the candidate dwarf galaxies. we determine upper limits to thegamma-ray flux assuming both power-law spectra and representative spectra fromwimp annihilation. the resulting integral flux above 100 mev is constrained tobe at a level below around 10^-9 photons cm^-2 s^-1. using recent stellarkinematic data, the gamma-ray flux limits are combined with improveddeterminations of the dark matter density profile in 8 of the 14 candidatedwarfs to place limits on the pair annihilation cross-section of wimps inseveral widely studied extensions of the standard model. with the present data,we are able to rule out large parts of the parameter space where the thermalrelic density is below the observed cosmological dark matter density and wimps(neutralinos here) are dominantly produced non-thermally, e.g. in models wheresupersymmetry breaking occurs via anomaly mediation. the gamma-ray limitspresented here also constrain some wimp models proposed to explain the fermiand pamela e^+e^- data, including low-mass wino-like neutralinos and modelswith tev masses pair-annihilating into muon-antimuon pairs.

1002.4415	constraints on cosmological dark matter annihilation from the fermi-lat  isotropic diffuse gamma-ray measurement	the first published fermi large area telescope (fermi-lat) measurement of theisotropic diffuse gamma-ray emission is in good agreement with a single powerlaw, and is not showing any signature of a dominant contribution from darkmatter sources in the energy range from 20 to 100 gev. we use the absolute sizeand spectral shape of this measured flux to derive cross section limits onthree types of generic dark matter candidates: annihilating into quarks,charged leptons and monochromatic photons. predicted gamma-ray fluxes fromannihilating dark matter are strongly affected by the underlying distributionof dark matter, and by using different available results of matter structureformation we assess these uncertainties. we also quantify how the dark matterconstraints depend on the assumed conventional backgrounds and on theuniverse's transparency to high-energy gamma-rays. in reasonable background anddark matter structure scenarios (but not in all scenarios we consider) it ispossible to exclude models proposed to explain the excess of electrons andpositrons measured by the fermi-lat and pamela experiments. derived limits alsostart to probe cross sections expected from thermally produced relics (e.g. inminimal supersymmetry models) annihilating predominantly into quarks. for themonochromatic gamma-ray signature, the current measurement constrains only darkmatter scenarios with very strong signals.

0709.2640	neutrino triggered target of opportunity (ntoo) test run with amanda-ii  and magic	kilometer scale neutrino telescopes are now being constructed (icecube) anddesigned (km3net). while no neutrino flux of cosmic origin has been discoveredso far, the first weak signals are expected to be discerned in the next fewyears. multi-messenger (observations combining different kinds of emission)investigations can enhance the discovery chance for neutrinos in case ofcorrelations. one possible application is the search for time correlations ofhigh energy neutrinos and established signals. we show the first adaptation ofa target of opportunity strategy to collect simultaneous data of high energyneutrinos and gamma-rays. neutrino events with coordinates close to preselectedcandidate sources are used to alert gamma-ray observations. the detection of apositive coincidence can enhance the neutrino discovery chance. more generally,this scheme of operation can increase the availability of simultaneousobservations. if cosmic neutrino signals can be established, the combinedobservations will allow time correlation studies and therefore constraints onthe source modeling. a first technical implementation of this scheme involvingamanda-ii and magic has been realized for few pre-selected sources in a shorttest run (sept. to dec. 2006), showing the feasability of the concept. resultsfrom this test run are shown.

1107.4977	gamma-ray and parsec-scale jet properties of a complete sample of  blazars from the mojave program	we investigate the fermi lat gamma-ray and 15 ghz vlba radio properties of ajoint gamma-ray- and radio-selected sample of agns obtained during the first 11months of the fermi mission (2008 aug 4 - 2009 jul 5). our sample contains thebrightest 173 agns in these bands above declination -30 deg. during thisperiod, and thus probes the full range of gamma-ray loudness (gamma-ray toradio band luminosity ratio) in the bright blazar population. the latterquantity spans at least four orders of magnitude, reflecting a wide range ofspectral energy distribution (sed) parameters in the bright blazar population.the bl lac objects, however, display a linear correlation of increasinggamma-ray loudness with synchrotron sed peak frequency, suggesting a universalsed shape for objects of this class. the synchrotron self-compton model isfavored for the gamma-ray emission in these bl lacs over external seed photonmodels, since the latter predict a dependence of compton dominance on dopplerfactor that would destroy any observed synchrotron sed peak - gamma-rayloudness correlation. the high-synchrotron peaked (hsp) bl lac objects aredistinguished by lower than average radio core brightness temperatures, andnone display large radio modulation indices or high linear core polarizationlevels. no equivalent trends are seen for the flat-spectrum radio quasars(fsrq) in our sample. given the association of such properties withrelativistic beaming, we suggest that the hsp bl lacs have generally lowerdoppler factors than the lower-synchrotron peaked bl lacs or fsrqs in oursample.

1108.0171	icecube sensitivity for low-energy neutrinos from nearby supernovae	this paper describes the response of the icecube neutrino telescope locatedat the geographic south pole to outbursts of mev neutrinos from the corecollapse of nearby massive stars. icecube was completed in december 2010forming a lattice of 5160 photomultiplier tubes that monitor a volume of ~ 1cubic kilometer in the deep antarctic ice for particle induced photons. thetelescope was designed to detect neutrinos with energies greater than 100 gev.owing to subfreezing ice temperatures, the photomultiplier dark noise rates areparticularly low. hence icecube can also detect large numbers of mev neutrinosby observing a collective rise in all photomultiplier rates on top of the darknoise. with 2 ms timing resolution, icecube can detect subtle features in thetemporal development of the supernova neutrino burst. for a supernova at thegalactic center, its sensitivity matches that of a background-freemegaton-scale supernova search experiment. the sensitivity decreases to 20standard deviations at the galactic edge (30 kpc) and 6 standard deviations atthe large magellanic cloud (50 kpc). icecube is sending triggers from potentialsupernovae to the supernova early warning system. the sensitivity to neutrinoproperties such as the neutrino hierarchy is discussed, as well as thepossibility to detect the neutronization burst, a short outbreak of electronneutrinos released by electron capture on protons soon after collapse.tantalizing signatures, such as the formation of a quark star or a black holeas well as the characteristics of shock waves, are investigated to illustrateicecube's capability for supernova detection.

1206.1346	gev observations of star-forming galaxies with \textit{fermi} lat	recent detections of the starburst galaxies m82 and ngc 253 by gamma-raytelescopes suggest that galaxies rapidly forming massive stars are moreluminous at gamma-ray energies compared to their quiescent relatives. buildingupon those results, we examine a sample of 69 dwarf, spiral, and luminous andultraluminous infrared galaxies at photon energies 0.1-100 gev using 3 years ofdata collected by the large area telescope (lat) on the \textit{fermi gamma-rayspace telescope} (\textit{fermi}). measured fluxes from significantly detectedsources and flux upper limits for the remaining galaxies are used to explorethe physics of cosmic rays in galaxies. we find further evidence forquasi-linear scaling relations between gamma-ray luminosity and both radiocontinuum luminosity and total infrared luminosity which apply both toquiescent galaxies of the local group and low-redshift starburst galaxies(conservative $p$-values $\lesssim0.05$ accounting for statistical andsystematic uncertainties). the normalizations of these scaling relationscorrespond to luminosity ratios of $\log(l_{0.1-100 \rm{gev}}/l_{1.4 \rm{ghz}})= 1.7 \pm 0.1_{\rm (statistical)} \pm 0.2_{\rm (dispersion)}$ and$\log(l_{0.1-100 \rm{gev}}/l_{8-1000 \mu\rm{m}}) = -4.3 \pm 0.1_{\rm(statistical)} \pm 0.2_{\rm (dispersion)}$ for a galaxy with a star formationrate of 1 $m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, assuming a chabrier initial mass function.using the relationship between infrared luminosity and gamma-ray luminosity,the collective intensity of unresolved star-forming galaxies at redshifts$0&lt;z&lt;2.5$ above 0.1 gev is estimated to be 0.4-2.4 $\times 10^{-6}$ phcm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ (4-23% of the intensity of the isotropic diffusecomponent measured with the lat). we anticipate that $\sim10$ galaxies could bedetected by their cosmic-ray induced gamma-ray emission during a 10-year\textit{fermi} mission.

1208.3430	an improved method for measuring muon energy using the truncated mean of  de/dx	the measurement of muon energy is critical for many analyses in largecherenkov detectors, particularly those that involve separatingextraterrestrial neutrinos from the atmospheric neutrino background. muonenergy has traditionally been determined by measuring the specific energy loss(de/dx) along the muon's path and relating the de/dx to the muon energy.because high-energy muons (e_mu &gt; 1 tev) lose energy randomly, the spread inde/dx values is quite large, leading to a typical energy resolution of 0.29 inlog10(e_mu) for a muon observed over a 1 km path length in the icecubedetector. in this paper, we present an improved method that uses a truncatedmean and other techniques to determine the muon energy. the muon track isdivided into separate segments with individual de/dx values. the elimination ofsegments with the highest de/dx results in an overall de/dx that is moreclosely correlated to the muon energy. this method results in an energyresolution of 0.22 in log10(e_mu), which gives a 26% improvement. thistechnique is applicable to any large water or ice detector and potentially tolarge scintillator or liquid argon detectors.

1210.7992	search for galactic pev gamma rays with the icecube neutrino observatory	gamma-ray induced air showers are notable for their lack of muons, comparedto hadronic showers. hence, air shower arrays with large underground muondetectors can select a sample greatly enriched in photon showers by rejectingshowers containing muons. icecube is sensitive to muons with energies above~500 gev at the surface, which provides an efficient veto system for hadronicair showers with energies above 1 pev. one year of data from the 40-stringicecube configuration was used to perform a search for point sources and agalactic diffuse signal. no sources were found, resulting in a 90% c.l. upperlimit on the ratio of gamma rays to cosmic rays of 1.2 x 10^(-3)for the fluxcoming from the galactic plane region (-80 deg &lt; l &lt; -30 deg; -10 deg &lt; b &lt; 5deg) in the energy range 1.2 - 6.0 pev. in the same energy range, point sourcefluxes with e^(-2) spectra have been excluded at a level of (e/tev)^2 d\phi/de~ 10^(-12)-10^(-11) cm^2/s/tev depending on source declination. the completeicecube detector will have a better sensitivity, due to the larger detectorsize, improved reconstruction and vetoing techniques. preliminary data from thenearly-final icecube detector configuration has been used to estimate the 5year sensitivity of the full detector. it is found to be more than an order ofmagnitude better, allowing the search for pev extensions of known tev gamma-rayemitters.

1308.5501	improvement in fast particle track reconstruction with robust statistics	the icecube project has transformed one cubic kilometer of deep naturalantarctic ice into a cherenkov detector. muon neutrinos are detected and theirdirection inferred by mapping the light produced by the secondary muon trackinside the volume instrumented with photomultipliers. reconstructing the muontrack from the observed light is challenging due to noise, light scattering inthe ice medium, and the possibility of simultaneously having multiple muonsinside the detector, resulting from the large flux of cosmic ray muons. thismanuscript describes work on two problems: (1) the track reconstructionproblem, in which, given a set of observations, the goal is to recover thetrack of a muon; and (2) the coincident event problem, which is to determinehow many muons are active in the detector during a time window. rather thansolving these problems by developing more complex physical models that areapplied at later stages of the analysis, our approach is to augment thedetectors early reconstruction with data filters and robust statisticaltechniques. these can be implemented at the level of on-line reconstructionand, therefore, improve all subsequent reconstructions. using the metric ofmedian angular resolution, a standard metric for track reconstruction, weimprove the accuracy in the initial reconstruction direction by 13%. we alsopresent improvements in measuring the number of muons in coincident events: wecan accurately determine the number of muons 98% of the time.

1308.5654	search for cosmic-ray induced gamma-ray emission in galaxy clusters	current theories predict relativistic hadronic particle populations inclusters of galaxies in addition to the already observed relativistic leptons.in these scenarios hadronic interactions give rise to neutral pions which decayinto $\gamma$ rays, that are potentially observable with the large areatelescope (lat) on board the fermi space telescope. we present a jointlikelihood analysis searching for spatially extended $\gamma$-ray emission atthe locations of 50 galaxy clusters in 4 years of fermi-lat data under theassumption of the universal cosmic-ray model proposed by pinzke &amp; pfrommer(2010). we find an excess at a significance of $2.7\sigma$ which upon closerinspection is however correlated to individual excess emission towards threegalaxy clusters: abell 400, abell 1367 and abell 3112. we discuss these casesin detail and conservatively attribute the emission to unmodeled background(for example, radio galaxies within the clusters). through the combinedanalysis of 50 clusters we exclude hadronic injection efficiencies in simplehadronic models above 21% and establish limits on the cosmic-ray to thermalpressure ratio within the virial radius, $r_{200}$, to be below 1.2-1.4%depending on the morphological classification. in addition we derive new limitson the $\gamma$-ray flux from individual clusters in our sample.

1310.5477	probing the origin of cosmic-rays with extremely high energy neutrinos  using the icecube observatory	we have searched for extremely high energy neutrinos using data taken withthe icecube detector between may 2010 and may 2012. two neutrino inducedparticle shower events with energies around 1 pev were observed, as reportedpreviously. in this work, we investigate whether these events could originatefrom cosmogenic neutrinos produced in the interactions of ultra-high energycosmic-rays with ambient photons while propagating through intergalactic space.exploiting icecube's large exposure for extremely high energy neutrinos and thelack of observed events above 100 pev, we can rule out the corresponding modelsat more than 90% confidence level. the model independent quasi-differential 90%cl upper limit, which amounts to $e^2 \phi_{\nu_e + \nu_\mu + \nu_\tau} = 1.2\times 10^{-7}$ gev cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ at 1 eev, provides the moststringent constraint in the energy range from 10 pev to 10 eev. our observationdisfavors strong cosmological evolution of the highest energy cosmic raysources such as the fanaroff-riley type ii class of radio galaxies.

1406.6868	multipole analysis of icecube data to search for dark matter accumulated  in the galactic halo	dark matter which is bound in the galactic halo might self-annihilate andproduce a flux of stable final state particles, e.g. high energy neutrinos.these neutrinos can be detected with icecube, a cubic-kilometer sized cherenkovdetector. given icecube's large field of view, a characteristic anisotropy ofthe additional neutrino flux is expected. in this paper we describe a multipolemethod to search for such a large-scale anisotropy in icecube data. this methoduses the expansion coefficients of a multipole expansion of neutrino arrivaldirections and incorporates signal-specific weights for each expansioncoefficient. we apply the technique to a high-purity muon neutrino sample fromthe northern hemisphere. the final result is compatible with thenull-hypothesis. as no signal was observed, we present limits on theself-annihilation cross-section averaged over the relative velocitydistribution $&lt;\sigma v&gt;$ down to $1.9\cdot10^{-23}\,\mathrm{cm}^3\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ for a dark matter particle mass of$700\,\mathrm{gev}$ to $1000\,\mathrm{gev}$ and direct annihilation into$\nu\bar{\nu}$. the resulting exclusion limits come close to exclusion limitsfrom $\gamma$-ray experiments, that focus on the outer galactic halo, for highdark matter masses of a few tev and hard annihilation channels.

1408.0634	searches for small-scale anisotropies from neutrino point sources with  three years of icecube data	recently, icecube found evidence for a diffuse signal of astrophysicalneutrinos in an energy range of $60\,\mathrm{tev}$ to the $\mathrm{pev}$-scale.the origin of those events, being a key to understanding the origin of cosmicrays, is still an unsolved question. so far, analyses have not succeeded toresolve the diffuse signal into point-like sources. searches including amaximum-likelihood-ratio test, based on the reconstructed directions andenergies of the detected down- and up-going neutrino candidates, were alsoperformed on icecube data leading to the exclusion of bright point sources. inthis paper, we present two methods to search for faint neutrino point sourcesin three years of icecube data, taken between 2008 and 2011. the first methodis an autocorrelation test, applied separately to the northern and southernsky. the second method is a multipole analysis, which expands the measured datain the northern hemisphere into spherical harmonics and uses the resultingexpansion coefficients to separate signal from background. with both methods,the results are consistent with the background expectation with a slightly moresparse spatial distribution, corresponding to an underfluctuation. depending onthe assumed number of sources, the resulting upper limit on the flux per sourcein the northern hemisphere for an $e^{-2}$ energy spectrum ranges from $1.5\cdot 10^{-8}\,\mathrm{gev}/(\mathrm{cm}^2 \mathrm{s})$, in the case of oneassumed source, to $4 \cdot 10^{-10} \,\mathrm{gev}/(\mathrm{cm}^2\mathrm{s})$, in the case of $3500$ assumed sources.

1501.05301	the origin of the extragalactic gamma-ray background and implications  for dark-matter annihilation	the origin of the extragalactic $\gamma$-ray background (egb) has beendebated for some time. { the egb comprises the $\gamma$-ray emission fromresolved and unresolved extragalactic sources, such as blazars, star-forminggalaxies and radio galaxies, as well as radiation from truly diffuseprocesses.} this letter focuses on the blazar source class, the most numerousdetected population, and presents an updated luminosity function and spectralenergy distribution model consistent with the blazar observations performed bythe {\it fermi} large area telescope (lat). we show that blazars account for50$^{+12}_{-11}$\,\% of the egb photons ($&gt;$0.1\,gev), and that {\it fermi}-lathas already resolved $\sim$70\,\% of this contribution. blazars, and inparticular low-luminosity hard-spectrum nearby sources like bl lacs, areresponsible for most of the egb emission above 100\,gev. we find that theextragalactic background light, which attenuates blazars' high-energy emission,is responsible for the high-energy cut-off observed in the egb spectrum.finally, we show that blazars, star-forming galaxies and radio galaxies cannaturally account for the amplitude and spectral shape of the background in the0.1--820\,gev range, leaving only modest room for other contributions. thisallows us to set competitive constraints on the dark-matter annihilation crosssection.

1501.05464	limits on dark matter annihilation signals from the fermi lat 4-year  measurement of the isotropic gamma-ray background	we search for evidence of dark matter (dm) annihilation in the isotropicgamma-ray background (igrb) measured with 50 months of fermi large areatelescope (lat) observations. an improved theoretical description of thecosmological dm annihilation signal, based on two complementary techniques andassuming generic weakly interacting massive particle (wimp) properties, rendersmore precise predictions compared to previous work. more specifically, weestimate the cosmologically-induced gamma-ray intensity to have an uncertaintyof a factor ~20 in canonical setups. we consistently include both the galacticand extragalactic signals under the same theoretical framework, and study theimpact of the former on the igrb spectrum derivation. we find no evidence for adm signal and we set limits on the dm-induced isotropic gamma-ray signal. ourlimits are competitive for dm particle masses up to tens of tev and, indeed,are the strongest limits derived from fermi lat data at tev energies. this ispossible thanks to the new fermi lat igrb measurement, which now extends up toan energy of 820 gev. we quantify uncertainties in detail and show thepotential this type of search offers for testing the wimp paradigm with acomplementary and truly cosmological probe of dm particle signals.

1501.06054	the third catalog of active galactic nuclei detected by the fermi large  area telescope	the third catalog of active galactic nuclei (agns) detected by the fermi-lat(3lac) is presented. it is based on the third fermi-lat catalog (3fgl) ofsources detected between 100 mev and 300 gev with a test statistic (ts) greaterthan 25, between 2008 august 4 and 2012 july 31. the 3lac includes 1591 agnslocated at high galactic latitudes (|b|&gt;10{\deg}), a 71% increase over thesecond catalog based on 2 years of data. there are 28 duplicate associations,thus 1563 of the 2192 high-latitude gamma-ray sources of the 3fgl catalog areagns. most of them (98%) are blazars. about half of the newly detected blazarsare of unknown type, i.e., they lack spectroscopic information of sufficientquality to determine the strength of their emission lines. based on theirgamma-ray spectral properties, these sources are evenly split betweenflat-spectrum radio quasars (fsrqs) and bl~lacs. the most abundant detectedbl~lacs are of the high-synchrotron-peaked (hsp) type. about 50% of the bl~lacshave no measured redshifts. a few new rare outliers (hsp-fsrqs andhigh-luminosity hsp bl~lacs) are reported. the general properties of the 3lacsample confirm previous findings from earlier catalogs. the fraction of 3lacblazars in the total population of blazars listed in bzcat remainsnon-negligible even at the faint ends of the bzcat-blazar radio, optical andx-ray flux distributions, which is a clue that even the faintest known blazarscould eventually shine in gamma rays at lat-detection levels. the energy-fluxdistributions of the different blazar populations are in good agreement withextrapolation from earlier catalogs.

1503.00598	searches for time dependent neutrino sources with icecube data from 2008  to 2012	in this paper searches for flaring astrophysical neutrino sources and sourceswith periodic emission with the icecube neutrino telescope are presented. incontrast to time integrated searches, where steady emission is assumed, theanalyses presented here look for a time dependent signal of neutrinos using theinformation from the neutrino arrival times to enhance the discovery potential.a search was performed for correlations between neutrino arrival times anddirections as well as neutrino emission following time dependent lightcurves,sporadic emission or periodicities of candidate sources. these include activegalactic nuclei, soft $\gamma$-ray repeaters, supernova remnants hostingpulsars, micro-quasars and x-ray binaries. the work presented here updates andextends previously published results to a longer period that covers four yearsof data from 2008 april 5 to 2012 may 16 including the first year of operationof the completed 86-string detector. the analyses did not find any significanttime dependent point sources of neutrinos and the results were used to setupper limits on the neutrino flux from source candidates.

1504.03753	measurement of the atmospheric $\nu_e$ spectrum with icecube	we present a measurement of the atmospheric $\nu_e$ spectrum at energiesbetween 0.1 tev and 100 tev using data from the first year of the completeicecube detector. atmospheric $\nu_e$ originate mainly from the decays of kaonsproduced in cosmic-ray air showers. this analysis selects 1078 fully containedevents in 332 days of livetime, then identifies those consistent with particleshowers. a likelihood analysis with improved event selection extends ourprevious measurement of the conventional $\nu_e$ fluxes to higher energies. thedata constrain the conventional $\nu_e$ flux to be $1.3^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$ times abaseline prediction from a honda's calculation, including the knee of thecosmic-ray spectrum. a fit to the kaon contribution ($\xi$) to the neutrinoflux finds a kaon component that is $\xi =1.3^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ times the baselinevalue. the fitted/measured prompt neutrino flux from charmed hadron decaysstrongly depends on the assumed astrophysical flux and shape. if theastrophysical component follows a power law, the result for the prompt flux is$0.0^{+3.0}_{-0.0}$ times a calculated flux based on the work by enberg, renoand sarcevic.

1505.07259	search for dark matter annihilation in the galactic center with  icecube-79	the milky way is expected to be embedded in a halo of dark matter particles,with the highest density in the central region, and decreasing density with thehalo-centric radius. dark matter might be indirectly detectable at earththrough a flux of stable particles generated in dark matter annihilations andpeaked in the direction of the galactic center. we present a search for anexcess flux of muon (anti-) neutrinos from dark matter annihilation in thegalactic center using the cubic-kilometer-sized icecube neutrino detector atthe south pole. there, the galactic center is always seen above the horizon.thus, new and dedicated veto techniques against atmospheric muons are requiredto make the southern hemisphere accessible for icecube. we used 319.7 live-daysof data from icecube operating in its 79-string configuration during 2010 and2011. no neutrino excess was found and the final result is compatible with thebackground. we present upper limits on the self-annihilation cross-section,$\left&lt;\sigma_\mathrm{a} v\right&gt;$, for wimp masses ranging from 30 gev up to10 tev, assuming cuspy (nfw) and flat-cored (burkert) dark matter haloprofiles, reaching down to $\simeq 4 \cdot 10^{-24}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$, and$\simeq 2.6 \cdot 10^{-23}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ for the $\nu\overline{\nu}$channel, respectively.

1506.03115	detection of a type iin supernova in optical follow-up observations of  icecube neutrino events	the icecube neutrino observatory pursues a follow-up program selectinginteresting neutrino events in real-time and issuing alerts for electromagneticfollow-up observations. in march 2012, the most significant neutrino alertduring the first three years of operation was issued by icecube. in thefollow-up observations performed by the palomar transient factory (ptf), a typeiin supernova (sn) ptf12csy was found $0.2^\circ$ away from the neutrino alertdirection, with an error radius of $0.54^\circ$. it has a redshift of$z=0.0684$, corresponding to a luminosity distance of about $300 \,\mathrm{mpc}$ and the pan-starrs1 survey shows that its explosion time was atleast 158 days (in host galaxy rest frame) before the neutrino alert, so that acausal connection is unlikely. the a posteriori significance of the chancedetection of both the neutrinos and the sn at any epoch is $2.2 \, \sigma$within icecube's 2011/12 data acquisition season. also, a complementaryneutrino analysis reveals no long-term signal over the course of one year.therefore, we consider the sn detection coincidental and the neutrinosuncorrelated to the sn. however, the sn is unusual and interesting by itself:it is luminous and energetic, bearing strong resemblance to the sn iin 2010jl,and shows signs of interaction of the sn ejecta with a dense circumstellarmedium. high-energy neutrino emission is expected in models of diffusive shockacceleration, but at a low, non-detectable level for this specific sn. in thispaper, we describe the sn ptf12csy and present both the neutrino andelectromagnetic data, as well as their analysis.

1507.03991	a combined maximum-likelihood analysis of the high-energy astrophysical  neutrino flux measured with icecube	evidence for an extraterrestrial flux of high-energy neutrinos has now beenfound in multiple searches with the icecube detector. the first solid evidencewas provided by a search for neutrino events with deposited energies$\gtrsim30$ tev and interaction vertices inside the instrumented volume. recentanalyses suggest that the extraterrestrial flux extends to lower energies andis also visible with throughgoing, $\nu_\mu$-induced tracks from the northernhemisphere. here, we combine the results from six different icecube searchesfor astrophysical neutrinos in a maximum-likelihood analysis. the combinedevent sample features high-statistics samples of shower-like and track-likeevents. the data are fit in up to three observables: energy, zenith angle andevent topology. assuming the astrophysical neutrino flux to be isotropic and toconsist of equal flavors at earth, the all-flavor spectrum with neutrinoenergies between 25 tev and 2.8 pev is well described by an unbroken power lawwith best-fit spectral index $-2.50\pm0.09$ and a flux at 100 tev of$\left(6.7_{-1.2}^{+1.1}\right)\cdot10^{-18}\,\mathrm{gev}^{-1}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{sr}^{-1}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$.under the same assumptions, an unbroken power law with index $-2$ is disfavoredwith a significance of 3.8 $\sigma$ ($p=0.0066\%$) with respect to the bestfit. this significance is reduced to 2.1 $\sigma$ ($p=1.7\%$) if instead wecompare the best fit to a spectrum with index $-2$ that has an exponentialcut-off at high energies. allowing the electron neutrino flux to deviate fromthe other two flavors, we find a $\nu_e$ fraction of $0.18\pm0.11$ at earth.the sole production of electron neutrinos, which would be characteristic ofneutron-decay dominated sources, is rejected with a significance of 3.6$\sigma$ ($p=0.014\%$).

1507.04005	evidence for astrophysical muon neutrinos from the northern sky with  icecube	results from the icecube neutrino observatory have recently providedcompelling evidence for the existence of a high energy astrophysical neutrinoflux utilizing a dominantly southern hemisphere dataset consisting primarily ofnu_e and nu_tau charged current and neutral current (cascade) neutrinointeractions. in the analysis presented here, a data sample of approximately35,000 muon neutrinos from the northern sky was extracted from data takenduring 659.5 days of livetime recorded between may 2010 and may 2012. whilethis sample is composed primarily of neutrinos produced by cosmic rayinteractions in the earth's atmosphere, the highest energy events areinconsistent with a hypothesis of solely terrestrial origin at 3.7 sigmasignificance. these neutrinos can, however, be explained by an astrophysicalflux per neutrino flavor at a level of phi(e_nu) = 9.9^{+3.9}_{-3.4} times10^{-19} gev^{-1} cm^{-2} sr^{-1} s^{-1} ({e_nu / 100 tev})^{-2}, consistentwith icecube's southern hemisphere dominated result. additionally, a fit for anastrophysical flux with an arbitrary spectral index was performed. we find aspectral index of 2.2^{+0.2}_{-0.2}, which is also in good agreement with thesouthern hemisphere result.

1510.00004	search for extended gamma-ray emission from the virgo galaxy cluster  with fermi-lat	galaxy clusters are one of the prime sites to search for dark matter (dm)annihilation signals. depending on the substructure of the dm halo of a galaxycluster and the cross sections for dm annihilation channels, these signalsmight be detectable by the latest generation of $\gamma$-ray telescopes. herewe use three years of fermi large area telescope (lat) data, which are the mostsuitable for searching for very extended emission in the vicinity of nearbyvirgo galaxy cluster. our analysis reveals statistically significant extendedemission which can be well characterized by a uniformly emitting disk profilewith a radius of 3\deg that moreover is offset from the cluster center. wedemonstrate that the significance of this extended emission strongly depends onthe adopted interstellar emission model (iem) and is most likely an artifact ofour incomplete description of the iem in this region. we also search for andfind new point source candidates in the region. we then derive conservativeupper limits on the velocity-averaged dm pair annihilation cross section fromvirgo. we take into account the potential $\gamma$-ray flux enhancement due todm sub-halos and its complex morphology as a merging cluster. for dmannihilating into $b\overline{b}$, assuming a conservative sub-halo modelsetup, we find limits that are between 1 and 1.5 orders of magnitude above theexpectation from the thermal cross section for$m_{\mathrm{dm}}\lesssim100\,\mathrm{gev}$. in a more optimistic scenario, weexclude $\langle \sigma v \rangle\sim3\times10^{-26}\,\mathrm{cm^{3}\,s^{-1}}$for $m_{\mathrm{dm}}\lesssim40\,\mathrm{gev}$ for the same channel. finally, wederive upper limits on the $\gamma$-ray-flux produced by hadronic cosmic-rayinteractions in the inter cluster medium. we find that the volume-averagedcosmic-ray-to-thermal pressure ratio is less than $\sim6\%$.
