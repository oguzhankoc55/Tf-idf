0901.4561	veritas observations of the bl lac 1es 1218+304	the veritas collaboration reports the detection of very-high-energy (vhe)gamma-ray emission from the high-frequency-peaked bl lac object 1es 1218+304located at a redshift of z=0.182. a gamma-ray signal was detected with astatistical significance of 10.4 standard deviations (10.4 sigma) for theobservations taken during the first three months of 2007, confirming thediscovery of this object made by the magic collaboration. the photon spectrumbetween ~160 gev and ~1.8 tev is well described by a power law with an index ofgamma = 3.08 +/- 0.34_stat +/- 0.2_sys. the integral flux is phi(e &gt; 200 gev) =(12.2 +/- 2.6) x 10^-12 cm^-2 s^-1, which corresponds to ~6% of that of thecrab nebula. the light curve does not show any evidence for vhe fluxvariability. using lower limits on the density of the extragalactic backgroundlight in the near to mid-infrared we are able to limit the range of intrinsicenergy spectra for 1es 1218+304. we show that the intrinsic photon spectrum hasan index that is harder than gamma = 2.32 +/- 0.37_stat. when includingconstraints from the spectra of 1es 1101-232 and 1es 0229+200, the spectrum of1es 1218+304 is likely to be harder than gamma = 1.86 +/- 0.37_stat.

1006.4830	particle acceleration and magnetic field structure in pks 2155-304:  optical polarimetric observations	in this paper we present multiband optical polarimetric observations of thevhe blazar pks 2155-304 made simultaneously with a h.e.s.s./fermi high-energycampaign in 2008, when the source was found to be in a low state. the intensedaily coverage of the dataset allowed us to study in detail the temporalevolution of the emission and we found that the particle accelerationtimescales are decoupled from the changes in the polarimetric properties of thesource. we present a model in which the optical polarimetric emissionoriginates at the polarised mm-wave core and propose an explanation for thelack of correlation between the photometric and polarimetric fluxes. theoptical emission is consistent with an inhomogeneous synchrotron source inwhich the large scale field is locally organised by a shock in which particleacceleration takes place. finally, we use these optical polarimetricobservations of pks 2155-304 at a low state to propose an origin for thequiescent gamma-ray flux of the object, in an attempt to provide clues for thesource of its recently established persistent tev emission.

1111.3331	simultaneous multi-wavelength campaign on pks 2005-489 in a high state	the high-frequency peaked bl lac object pks 2005-489 was the target of amulti-wavelength campaign with simultaneous observations in the tev gamma-ray(h.e.s.s.), gev gamma-ray (fermi/lat), x-ray (rxte, swift), uv (swift) andoptical (atom, swift) bands. this campaign was carried out during a high fluxstate in the synchrotron regime. the flux in the optical and x-ray bandsreached the level of the historical maxima. the hard gev spectrum observed withfermi/lat connects well to the very high energy (vhe, e&gt;100gev) spectrummeasured with h.e.s.s. with a peak energy between ~5 and 500 gev. compared toobservations with contemporaneous coverage in the vhe and x-ray bands in 2004,the x-ray flux was ~50 times higher during the 2009 campaign while the tevgamma-ray flux shows marginal variation over the years. the spectral energydistribution during this multi-wavelength campaign was fit by a one zonesynchrotron self-compton model with a well determined cutoff in x-rays. theparameters of a one zone ssc model are inconsistent with variability timescales. the variability behaviour over years with the large changes insynchrotron emission and small changes in the inverse compton emission does notwarrant an interpretation within a one-zone ssc model despite an apparentlysatisfying fit to the broadband data in 2009.

1204.5690	h.e.s.s. observations of the carina nebula and its enigmatic colliding  wind binary eta carinae	the massive binary system eta carinae and the surrounding hii complex, thecarina nebula, are potential particle acceleration sites from whichvery-high-energy (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) \gamma-ray emission could be expected. thispaper presents data collected during vhe \gamma-ray observations with theh.e.s.s. telescope array from 2004 to 2010, which cover a full orbit of etacarinae. in the 33.1-hour data set no hint of significant \gamma-ray emissionfrom eta carinae has been found and an upper limit on the \gamma-ray flux of7.7 x 10-13 ph cm-2 s-1 (99% confidence level) is derived above the energythreshold of 470 gev. together with the detection of high-energy (he; 0.1 gev &gt;e &gt; 100 gev) \gamma-ray emission by the fermi-lat up to 100 gev, and assuming acontinuation of the average he spectral index into the vhe domain, theseresults imply a cut-off in the \gamma-ray spectrum between the he and vhe\gamma-ray range. this could be caused either by a cut-off in the acceleratedparticle distribution or by severe \gamma-\gamma\ absorption losses in the windcollision region. furthermore, the search for extended \gamma-ray emission fromthe carina nebula resulted in an upper limit on the \gamma-ray flux of 4.2 x10-12 ph cm-2 s-1 (99% confidence level). the derived upper limit of ~23 on thecosmic-ray enhancement factor is compared with results found for the old-agemixed-morphology supernova remnant w 28.

1205.5485	spectral analysis and interpretation of the \gamma-ray emission from the  starburst galaxy ngc 253	very-high-energy (vhe; e &gt;100 gev) and high-energy (he; 100 mev &lt; e &lt; 100gev) data from \gamma-ray observations performed with the h.e.s.s. telescopearray and the fermi-lat instrument, respectively, are analysed in order toinvestigate the non-thermal processes in the starburst galaxy ngc 253. the vhe\gamma-ray data can be described by a power law in energy with differentialphoton index \gamma=2.14 \pm 0.18_stat \pm 0.30_sys and differential fluxnormalisation at 1 tev of f_0 = (9.6 \pm 1.5_stat (+5.7,-2.9)_sys) x 10^{-14}tev^{-1} cm^{-2} s^{-1}. a power-law fit to the differential he \gamma-rayspectrum reveals a photon index of \gamma=2.24 \pm 0.14_stat \pm 0.03_sys andan integral flux between 200 mev and 200 gev of f(0.2-200 gev) = (4.9 \pm1.0_stat \pm 0.3_sys) x 10^{-9} cm^{-2} s^{-1}. no evidence for a spectralbreak or turnover is found over the dynamic range of both the lat instrumentand the h.e.s.s. experiment: a combined fit of a power law to the he and vhe\gamma-ray data results in a differential photon index \gamma=2.34 \pm 0.03with a p-value of 30%. the \gamma-ray observations indicate that at least about20% of the energy of the cosmic rays capable of producing hadronic interactionsis channeled into pion production. the smooth alignment between the spectra inthe he and vhe \gamma-ray domain suggests that the same transport processesdominate in the entire energy range. advection is most likely responsible forcharged particle removal from the starburst nucleus from gev to multiple tevenergies. in a hadronic scenario for the \gamma-ray production, the singleoverall power-law spectrum observed would therefore correspond to the meanenergy spectrum produced by the ensemble of cosmic-ray sources in the starburstregion.

1208.1370	constraints on the gamma-ray emission from the cluster-scale agn  outburst in the hydra a galaxy cluster	in some galaxy clusters powerful agn have blown bubbles with cluster scaleextent into the ambient medium. the main pressure support of these bubbles isnot known to date, but cosmic rays are a viable possibility. for such ascenario copious gamma-ray emission is expected as a tracer of cosmic rays fromthese systems. hydra a, the closest galaxy cluster hosting a cluster scale agnoutburst, located at a redshift of 0.0538, is investigated for being agamma-ray emitter with the high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) array andthe fermi large area telescope (fermi-lat). data obtained in 20.2 hours ofdedicated h.e.s.s. observations and 38 months of fermi-lat data, gathered byits usual all-sky scanning mode, have been analyzed to search for a gamma-raysignal. no signal has been found in either data set. upper limits on thegamma-ray flux are derived and are compared to models. these are the firstlimits on gamma-ray emission ever presented for galaxy clusters hosting clusterscale agn outbursts. the non-detection of hydra a in gamma-rays has importantimplications on the particle populations and physical conditions inside thebubbles in this system. for the case of bubbles mainly supported by hadroniccosmic rays, the most favorable scenario, that involves full mixing betweencosmic rays and embedding medium, can be excluded. however, hadronic cosmicrays still remain a viable pressure support agent to sustain the bubblesagainst the thermal pressure of the ambient medium. the largest population ofhighly-energetic electrons which are relevant for inverse-compton gamma-rayproduction is found in the youngest inner lobes of hydra a. the limit on theinverse-compton gamma-ray flux excludes a magnetic field below half of theequipartition value of 16 mug in the inner lobes.

1210.1359	probing the extent of the non-thermal emission from the vela x region at  tev energies with h.e.s.s	vela x is a region of extended radio emission in the western part of the velaconstellation: one of the nearest pulsar wind nebulae (pwne), and associatedwith the energetic vela pulsar (psr b0833-45). extended very-high-energy (vhe)$\gamma$-ray emission (hess $\mathrm{j0835\mhyphen 455}$) was discovered usingthe h.e.s.s. experiment in 2004. the vhe $\gamma$-ray emission was found to becoincident with a region of x-ray emission discovered with ${\it rosat}$ above1.5 kev (the so-called \textit{vela x cocoon}): a filamentary structureextending southwest from the pulsar to the centre of vela x. a deeperobservation of the entire vela x nebula region, also including larger offsetsfrom the cocoon, has been performed with h.e.s.s. this re-observation wascarried out in order to probe the extent of the non-thermal emission from thevela x region at tev energies and to investigate its spectral properties. inorder to increase the sensitivity to the faint $\gamma$-ray emission from thevery extended vela x region, a multivariate analysis method combining threecomplementary reconstruction techniques of cherenkov-shower images is appliedfor the selection of $\gamma$-ray events. the analysis is performed with theon/off background method, which estimates the background from separateobservations pointing away from vela x; towards regions free of $\gamma$-raysources but with comparable observation conditions. the $\gamma$-ray surfacebrightness over the large vela x region reveals that the detection ofnon-thermal vhe $\gamma$-ray emission from the pwn hess $\mathrm{j0835\mhyphen455}$ is statistically significant over a region of radius 1.2$^{\circ}$ aroundthe position $\alpha$ = 08$^{\mathrm{h}}$ 35$^{\mathrm{m}}$ 00$^{\mathrm{s}}$,$\delta$ = -45$^{\circ}$ 36$^{\mathrm{\prime}}$00$^{\mathrm{\prime}\mathrm{\prime}}$ (j2000).

1508.06128	prospects for indirect dark matter searches with the cherenkov telescope  array (cta)	the cherenkov telescope array (cta) will have a unique chance of discoveryfor a large range of masses in weakly interacting massive particles models ofdark matter. the principal target for dark matter searches with cta is thecentre of the galactic halo. the best strategy is to perform cta observationswithin a few degrees of the galactic centre, with the galactic centre itselfand the most intense diffuse emission regions removed from the analysis.assuming a cuspy dark matter density profile for the milky way, 500 hours ofobservations in this region provide sensitivities to and below the thermalcross-section of dark matter annihilations, for masses between a few hundredgev and a few tens of tev; therefore cta will have a significant chance ofdiscovery in some models. since the dark matter density in the milky way is farfrom certain in the inner kpc region, other targets are also proposed forobservation, like ultra-faint dwarf galaxies such as segue 1 with 100 hours peryear proposed. beyond these two observational targets, further alternatives,such as galactic dark clumps, will be considered closer to the actual date ofcta operations. sensitivity predictions for dark matter searches are given onthe various targets taking into account the latest instrument responsefunctions expected for cta together with a discussion on the systematicuncertainties from the backgrounds.

1508.06622	prospects on testing lorentz invariance violation with the cherenkov  telescope array	the assumption of lorentz invariance is one of the founding principles ofmodern physics and violation of that would have deep consequences to ourunderstanding of the universe. potential signatures of such a violation couldrange from energy dependent dispersion introduced into a light curve to achange in the photon-photon pair production threshold that changes the expectedopacity of the universe. astronomical sources of very high energy (vhe) photonscan be used as test beams to probe fundamental physics phenomena, however, sucheffects would likely be small and need to be disentangled from intrinsic sourcephysics processes. the cherenkov telescope array (cta) will be the nextgeneration ground based observatory of vhe photons. it will have improved fluxsensitivity, a lower energy threshold (tens of gev), broader energy coverage(nearly 5 decades) and improved energy resolution (better than 10\% over muchof the energy range) compared to current facilities in addition to excellenttime resolution for short timescale and rapidly varying phenomena. the expectedsensitivity of this facility leads to us to examine in this contribution thekinds of limits to lorentz invariance violation (liv) that we could expect toobtain on vhe observations of active galactic nuclei (agn), gamma ray bursts(grbs) and pulsars with cta. with a statistical sample and wide variety ofsources cta has the potential to set model independent limits.

1508.06625	the camera calibration strategy of the cherenkov telescope array	the cherenkov telescope array (cta) will be the next generation ground basedobservatory in very high energy gamma ray astronomy. the facility will achievea wide energy coverage, starting from a threshold of a few tens of gev up tohundreds of tev by utilising several classes of telescopes, each optimised fordifferent regions of the gamma-ray spectrum. the required energy resolution ofbetter than 10-15% over most of the energy range and a goal of 5% systematicuncertainty on the measurement of the cherenkov light intensity at the positionof each telescope means that a very precise evaluation of the entire systemwill need to be made. the composite nature of the array means multiple cameratechnologies will be employed so multiple calibration systems and procedureswill be necessary to meet the performance requirements. additional constraintswill come from the need to minimise observing time losses and that theobservatory is foreseen to operate for tens of years, so both short and longterm systematic changes in performance will need to be investigated andmonitored. this contribution summarises the recommended camera calibrationstrategy of cta based on the experience with current iacts.

astro-ph;0112177	very high energy gamma-rays from centaurus x-3: indications and  implications	a timing analysis of vhe gamma-ray observations of cen x-3 taken with theuniversity of durham mark 6 telescope was performed, using both rayleigh andbayesian statistics. data from only 1 observation produced evidence forperiodicity, in a 'soft' cut data set, with an overall chance probability &lt;0.01and blueshifted by 6.6ms from the nominal second harmonic of the pulse period.we show that the disappearance of the rayleigh peak in the fully cut data setis consistent with a gamma-ray origin hypothesis. the second part of the paperconsiders theoretical models that could explain the existing data of cen x-3 inhigh and very high energy gamma-rays. on the basis of energetics, allreasonable options for gamma-ray production must be connected to jets emergingfrom the inner accretion disc around the neutron star. one principal option isa large scale source, with r_s~10^13-14cm, assuming effective acceleration ofelectrons by shocks produced by the interaction of the jets with the denseatmosphere of the binary. the bulk of gamma-ray features could be explained bythis model except modulations at the pulsar period, which would require asource with r_s&lt;10^11cm. we consider hadronic and leptonic models for theformation of such a compact object. both models predict the episodes of pulsedemission may be rare, of typical duration ~few hours, and the frequency ofpulsations should be significantly shifted from the nominal frequency of thex-ray pulsar. the opportunities to distinguish between different models usingfuture gamma-ray observations of this x-ray binary are discussed.

astro-ph;0602258	tev gamma-ray observations of the perseus and abell 2029 galaxy clusters	galaxy clusters might be sources of tev gamma rays emitted by high-energyprotons and electrons accelerated by large scale structure formation shocks,galactic winds, or active galactic nuclei. furthermore, gamma rays may beproduced in dark matter particle annihilation processes at the cluster cores.we report on observations of the galaxy clusters perseus and abell 2029 usingthe 10 m whipple cherenkov telescope during the 2003-2004 and 2004-2005observing seasons. we apply a two-dimensional analysis technique to scrutinizethe clusters for tev emission. in this paper we first determine flux upperlimits on tev gamma-ray emission from point sources within the clusters.second, we derive upper limits on the extended cluster emission. wesubsequently compare the flux upper limits with egret upper limits at 100 mevand theoretical models. assuming that the gamma-ray surface brightness profilemimics that of the thermal x-ray emission and that the spectrum of clustercosmic rays extends all the way from thermal energies to multi-tev energieswith a differential spectral index of -2.1, our results imply that the cosmicray proton energy density is less than 7.9% of the thermal energy density forthe perseus cluster.
