0706.2374	line and mean opacities for ultracool dwarfs and extrasolar planets	opacities and chemical abundance data are crucial ingredients of ultracooldwarf and extrasolar giant planet atmosphere models. we report here on thedetailed sources of molecular opacity data employed by our group for thisapplication. we also present tables of rosseland and planck mean opacitieswhich are of use in some studies of the atmospheres, interiors, and evolutionof planets and brown dwarfs. for the tables presented here we have included theopacities of important atomic and molecular species, including the alkalielements, pressure induced absorption by hydrogen, and other significantopacity sources but neglect opacity from condensates. we report for eachspecies how we have assembled molecular line data from a combination of publicdatabases, laboratory data that is not yet in the public databases, and our ownnumerical calculations. we combine these opacities with abundances computedfrom a chemical equilibrium model using recently revised solar abundances tocompute mean opacities. the chemical equilibrium calculation accounts for thesettling of condensates in a gravitational field, and is applicable toultracool dwarf and extrasolar planetary atmospheres, but not circumstellardisks. we find that the inclusion of alkali atomic opacity substantiallyincreases the mean opacities over those currently in the literature atdensities relevant to the atmospheres and interiors of giant planets and browndwarfs. we provide our opacity tables for public use and discuss theirlimitations.

0906.2991	the 0.8-14.5 micron spectra of mid-l to mid-t dwarfs: diagnostics of  effective temperature, grain sedimentation, gas transport, and surface  gravity	we present new 5.2-14.5 micron low-resolution spectra of 14 mid-l to mid-tdwarfs, as well as 3.0-4.1 micron spectra for five of these dwarfs. these dataare supplemented by existing red and near-infrared spectra (0.6-2.5 micron), aswell as red through mid-infrared spectroscopy of seven other l and t dwarfspresented by cushing et al. (2008). we compare these spectra to those generatedfrom the model atmospheres of saumon &amp; marley (2008). the models reproduce theobserved spectra well, except in the case of one very red l3.5 dwarf, 2massj22244381-0158521. the broad wavelength coverage allows us to constrain almostindependently the four parameters used to describe these photospheres in ourmodels: effective temperature (teff), surface gravity, grain sedimentationefficiency (fsed) and vertical gas transport efficiency (kzz).  the sample of l3.5 to t5.5 dwarfs spans the range 1800 &lt; teff &lt; 1000 k, withan l-t transition (spectral types l7-t4) that lies between 1400 k and 1100k fordwarfs with typical near-infrared colors; bluer and redder dwarfs can be 100 kwarmer or cooler, respectively, when using infrared spectral types. in thismodel analysis, fsed increases rapidly between types t0 and t4, indicating thatincreased sedimentation can explain the rapid disappearance of clouds at thisstage of brown dwarf evolution. there is a suggestion that the transition todust-free atmospheres happens at lower temperatures for lower gravity dwarfs.

0910.4240	multiple scattering polarization of substellar-mass objects : t-dwarfs	while there have been multiple observational programs aimed at detectinglinear polarization of optical radiation emitted by ultracool dwarfs, there hasbeen comparatively less rigorous theoretical analysis of the problem. thegeneral expectation has been that the atmospheres of those substellar-massobjects with condensate clouds would give rise to linear polarization due toscattering. because of rotation-induced non-sphericity, there is expected to beincomplete cancellation of disk-integrated net polarization and thus a finitepolarization. for cloudless objects, however, only molecular rayleighscattering will contribute to any net polarization and this limit has not beenwell studied. hence in this paper we present a detailed multiple scatteringanalysis of the polarization expected from those t-dwarfs whose spectra showabsence of condensates. for this, we develop and solve the full radiativetransfer equations for linearly polarized radiation. only atomic and molecularrayleigh scattering are considered to be the source of polarization. we computethe local polarization at different angular directions in a plane-parallelatmospheres calculated for the range of effective temperatures of t dwarfs andthen average over the whole surface of the object. the effects of gravity andlimb darkening as well as rotation induced non-sphericity are included. it isfound that the amount of polarization decreases with the increase in effectivetemperature. it is also found that significant polarization at any local pointin the atmosphere arises only in the optical (b-band). however, the diskintegrated polarization--even in the b-band--is negligible. hence we concludethat, unlike the case for cloudy l dwarfs, polarization of cloudless t-dwarfsby atomic and molecular scattering may not be detectable.

1007.2942	atmospheric circulation of eccentric hot neptune gj436b	gj436b is a unique member of the transiting extrasolar planet populationbeing one of the smallest and least irradiated and possessing an eccentricorbit. because of its size, mass and density, gj436b could plausibly have anatmospheric metallicity similar to neptune (20-60 times solar abundances),which makes it an ideal target to study the effects of atmospheric metallicityon dynamics and radiative transfer in an extrasolar planetary atmosphere. wepresent three-dimensional atmospheric circulation models that include realisticnon-gray radiative transfer for 1, 3, 10, 30, and 50 times solar atmosphericmetallicity cases of gj436b. low metallicity models (1 and 3 times solar) showlittle day/night temperature variation and strong high-latitude jets. incontrast, higher metallicity models (30 and 50 times solar) exhibit day/nighttemperature variations and a strong equatorial jet. spectra and light curvesproduced from these simulations show strong orbital phase dependencies in the50 times solar case and negligible variations with orbital phase in the 1 timessolar case. comparisons between the predicted planet/star flux ratio from thesemodels and current secondary eclipse measurements support a high metallicityatmosphere (30-50 times solar abundances) with disequilibrium carbon chemistryat play for gj436b. regardless of the actual atmospheric composition of gj436b,our models serve to illuminate how metallicity influences the atmosphericcirculation for a broad range of warm extrasolar planets.

1009.2145	observed polarization of brown dwarfs suggests low surface gravity	light scattering by atmospheric dust particles is responsible for thepolarization observed in some l dwarfs. whether this polarization arises froman inhomogeneous distribution of dust across the disk or an oblate shapeinduced by rotation remains unclear. here we argue that the latter case isplausible and, for many l dwarfs, the more likely one. furthermore evolutionarymodels of mature field l dwarfs predict surface gravities ranging from about200 to 2500 m/s^2 (corresponding to masses of about 15 to 70 times of jupitermass). yet comparison of observed spectra to available synthetic spectra oftendoes not permit more precise determination of the surface gravity of individualfield l dwarfs, leading to important uncertainties in their properties. sincerotationally-induced non-sphericity, which gives rise to non-zerodisk-integrated polarization, is more pronounced at lower gravities,polarization is a promising low gravity indicator. here we combine a rigorousmultiple scattering analysis with a self-consistent cloudy atmospheric modeland observationally inferred rotational velocities and find that the observedoptical polarization can be explained if the surface gravity of the polarizedobjects is about 300 m/s^2 or less, potentially providing a new method forconstraining l dwarf masses.

1009.3071	exoplanet albedo spectra and colors as a function of planet phase,  separation, and metallicity	first generation optical coronagraphic telescopes will obtain images of coolgas and ice giant exoplanets around nearby stars. the albedo spectra ofexoplanets at planet-star separations larger than about 1 au are dominated byreflected light to beyond 1 {\mu}m and are punctuated by molecular absorptionfeatures. we consider how exoplanet albedo spectra and colors vary as afunction of planet-star separation, metallicity, mass, and observed phase forjupiter and neptune analogs from 0.35 to 1 {\mu}m. we model jupiter analogswith 1x and 3x the solar abundance of heavy elements, and neptune analogs with10x and 30x. our model planets orbit a solar analog parent star at separationsof 0.8 au, 2 au, 5 au, and 10 au. we use a radiative-convective model tocompute temperature-pressure profiles. the giant exoplanets are cloud-free at0.8 au, have h2o clouds at 2 au, and have both nh3 and h2o clouds at 5 au and10 au. for each model planet we compute moderate resolution spectra as afunction of phase. the presence and structure of clouds strongly influence thespectra. since the planet images will be unresolved, their phase may not beobvious, and multiple observations will be needed to discriminate between theeffects of planet-star separation, metallicity, and phase. we consider therange of these combined effects on spectra and colors. for example, we findthat the spectral influence of clouds depends more on planet-star separationand hence temperature than metallicity, and it is easier to discriminatebetween cloudy 1x and 3x jupiters than between 10x and 30x neptunes. inaddition to alkalis and methane, our jupiter models show h2o absorptionfeatures near 0.94 {\mu}m. we also predict that giant exoplanets receivinggreater insolation than jupiter will exhibit higher equator to pole temperaturegradients than are found on jupiter and thus may have differing atmosphericdynamics.

1009.5722	clouds in the coldest brown dwarfs: fire spectroscopy of ross 458c	condensate clouds are a salient feature of l dwarf atmospheres, but have beenassumed to play little role in shaping the spectra of the coldest t-type browndwarfs. here we report evidence of condensate opacity in the near-infraredspectrum of the brown dwarf candidate ross 458c, obtained with the folded-portinfrared echellette (fire) spectrograph at the magellan telescopes. these dataverify the low-temperature nature of this source, indicating a t8 spectralclassification, log lbol/lsun = -5.62+/-0.03, teff = 650+/-25 k, and a mass ator below the deuterium burning limit. the data also reveal enhanced emission atk-band associated with youth (low surface gravity) and supersolar metallicity,reflecting the properties of the ross 458 system (age = 150-800 myr, [fe/h] =+0.2 to +0.3). we present fits of fire data for ross 458c, the t9 dwarf ulasj133553.45+113005.2, and the blue t7.5 dwarf sdss j141624.08+134826.7b, tocloudless and cloudy spectral models from saumon &amp; marley. for ross 458c weconfirm a low surface gravity and supersolar metallicity, while the temperaturediffers depending on the presence (635 [+25,-35] k) or absence (760 [+70,-45]k) of cloud extinction. ulas j1335+1130 and sdss j1416+1348b have similartemperatures (595 [+25,-45] k), but distinct surface gravities (log g = 4.0-4.5cgs versus 5.0-5.5 cgs) and metallicities ([m/h] ~ +0.2 versus -0.2). in allthree cases, cloudy models provide better fits to the spectral data,significantly so for ross 458c. these results indicate that clouds are animportant opacity source in the spectra of young cold t dwarfs, and should beconsidered when characterizing the spectra of planetary-mass objects in youngclusters and directly-imaged exoplanets. the characteristics of ross 458csuggest it could itself be regarded as a planet, albeit one whose cosmogonydoes not conform with current planet formation theories.

1009.6217	a patchy cloud model for the l to t dwarf transition	one of the mechanisms suggested for the l to t dwarf spectral type transitionis the appearance of relatively cloud-free regions across the disk of browndwarfs as they cool. the existence of partly cloudy regions has been supportedby evidence for variability in dwarfs in the late l to early t spectral range,but no self-consistent atmosphere models of such partly cloudy objects have yetbeen constructed. here we present a new approach for consistently modelingpartly cloudy brown dwarfs and giant planets. we find that even a smallfraction of cloud holes dramatically alter the atmospheric thermal profile,spectra, and photometric colors of a given object. with decreasing cloudinessobjects briskly become bluer in j - k and brighten in j band, as is observed atthe l/t transition. model spectra of partly cloudy objects are similar to ourmodels with globally homogenous, but thinner, clouds. hence spectra alone maynot be sufficient to distinguish partial cloudiness although variability andpolarization measurements are potential observational signatures. finally wenote that partial cloud cover may be an alternative explanation for the blue ldwarfs.

1102.0063	disequilibrium carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen chemistry in the atmospheres  of hd 189733b and hd 209458b	we have developed 1-d photochemical and thermochemical kinetics and diffusionmodels for the transiting exoplanets hd 189733b and hd 209458b to study theeffects of disequilibrium chemistry on the atmospheric composition of "hotjupiters." here we investigate the coupled chemistry of neutral carbon,hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen species, and we compare the model results withexisting transit and eclipse observations. we find that the vertical profilesof molecular constituents are significantly affected by transport-inducedquenching and photochemistry, particularly on cooler hd 189733b; however, thewarmer stratospheric temperatures on hd 209458b can help maintainthermochemical equilibrium and reduce the effects of disequilibrium chemistry.for both planets, the methane and ammonia mole fractions are found to beenhanced over their equilibrium values at pressures of a few bar to less than ambar due to transport-induced quenching, but ch4 and nh3 are photochemicallyremoved at higher altitudes. atomic species, unsaturated hydrocarbons(particularly c2h2), some nitriles (particularly hcn), and radicals like oh,ch3, and nh2 are enhanced overequilibrium predictions because of quenching andphotochemistry. in contrast, co, h2o, n2, and co2 more closely follow theirequilibrium profiles, except at pressures &lt; 1 microbar, where co, h2o, and n2are photochemically destroyed and co2 is produced before its eventualhigh-altitude destruction. the enhanced abundances of hcn, ch4, and nh3 inparticular are expected to affect the spectral signatures and thermal profileshd 189733b and other, relatively cool, close-in transiting exoplanets. weexamine the sensitivity of our results to the assumed temperature structure andeddy diffusion coefficientss and discuss further observational consequences ofthese models.

1106.0492	probing the physical properties of directly imaged gas giant exoplanets  through polarization	it is becoming clear that the atmospheres of the young, self-luminousextrasolar giant planets imaged to date are dusty. planets with dustyatmospheres may exhibit detectable amounts of linear polarization in thenear-infrared, as has been observed from some field l dwarfs. the asymmetryrequired in the thermal radiation field to produce polarization may ariseeither from the rotation-induced oblateness or from surface inhomogeneities,such as partial cloudiness. while it is not possible at present to predict theextent to which atmospheric dynamics on a given planet may produce surfaceinhomogeneities substantial enough to produce net non-zero disk integratedpolarization, the contribution of rotation-induced oblateness can be estimated.using a self-consistent, spatially homogeneous atmospheric model and a multiplescattering polarization formalism for this class of exoplanets, we show thatpolarization on the order of 1% may arise due to the rotation-inducedoblateness of the planets. the degree of polarization for cloudy planets shouldpeak at the same wavelengths at which the planets are brightest in thenear-infrared. the observed polarization may be even higher if surfaceinhomogeneities exist and play a significant role. polarized radiation fromself-luminous gas giant exoplanets, if detected, provides an additional tool tocharacterize these young planets and a new method to constrain their surfacegravity and masses.

0710.2558	a unified theory for the atmospheres of the hot and very hot jupiters:  two classes of irradiated atmospheres	we highlight the importance of gaseous tio and vo opacity on the highlyirradiated close-in giant planets. the atmospheres of these planets naturallyfall into two classes that are somewhat analogous to the m- and l-type dwarfs.those that are warm enough to have appreciable opacity due to tio and vo gaseswe term the ``pm class'' planets, and those that are cooler we term ``plclass'' planets. we calculate model atmospheres for these planets, includingpressure-temperature profiles, spectra, and characteristic radiative timeconstants. we show that pm class planets have hot stratospheres $\sim$2000 kand appear ``anomalously'' bright in the mid infrared secondary eclipse, as wasrecently found for planets hd 149026b and hd 209458b. this class of planetsabsorbs incident flux and emits thermal flux from high in their atmospheres.consequently, they will have large day/night temperature contrasts andnegligible phase shifts between orbital phase and thermal emission lightcurves, because radiative timescales are much shorter than possible dynamicaltimescales. the pl class planets absorb incident flux deeper in the atmospherewhere atmospheric dynamics will more readily redistribute absorbed energy. thiswill lead to cooler day sides, warmer night sides, and larger phase shifts inthermal emission light curves. around a sun-like primary this boundary occursat $\sim$0.04-0.05 au. the eccentric transiting planets hd 147506b and hd17156b alternate between the classes. thermal emission in the optical from pmclass planets is significant red-ward of 400 nm, making these planetsattractive targets for optical detection. the difference in the observedday/night contrast between ups andromeda b (pm class) and hd 189733b (pl class)is naturally explained in this scenario.

0711.0801	atmospheric parameters of field l and t dwarfs	we present an analysis of the 0.95-14.5 micron spectral energy distributionsof nine field ultracool dwarfs with spectral types ranging from l1 to t4.5.effective temperatures, gravities, and condensate cloud sedimentationefficiencies are derived by comparing the data to synthetic spectra computedfrom atmospheric models that self-consistently include the formation ofcondensate clouds. derived effective temperatures decrease steadily through thel1 to t4.5 spectral types and we confirm that the effective temperatures ofultracool dwarfs at the l/t transition are nearly constant, decreasing by only~200 k from spectral types l7.5 to t4.5. the two objects in our sample withvery red j-ks colors are best fitted with synthetic spectra that have thickclouds which hints at a possible correlation between the near-infrared colorsof l dwarfs and the condensate cloud properties. the fits to the two t dwarfsin our sample (t2 and t4.5) also suggest that the clouds become thinner in thisspectral class, in agreement with previous studies. restricting the fits tonarrower wavelength ranges (i.e., individual photometric bands) almost alwaysyields excellent agreement between the data and models. limitations in ourknowledge of the opacities of key absorbers such as feh, vo, and ch4 at certainwavelengths remain obvious, however. the effective temperatures obtained byfitting the narrower wavelength ranges can show a large scatter compared to thevalues derived by fitting the full spectral energy distributions; deviationsare typically ~200 k and in the worst cases, up to 700 k.

1205.6488	masses, radii, and cloud properties of the hr 8799 planets	the near-infrared colors of the planets directly imaged around the a star hr8799 are much redder than most field brown dwarfs of the same effectivetemperature. previous theoretical studies of these objects have concluded thatthe atmospheres of planets b, c, and d are unusually cloudy or have unusualcloud properties. some studies have also found that the inferred radii of someor all of the planets disagree with expectations of standard giant planetevolution models. here we compare the available data to the predictions of ourown set of atmospheric and evolution models that have been extensively testedagainst observations of field l and t dwarfs, including the reddest l dwarfs.unlike some previous studies we require mutually consistent choices foreffective temperature, gravity, cloud properties, and planetary radius. thisprocedure thus yields plausible values for the masses, effective temperatures,and cloud properties of all three planets. we find that the cloud properties ofthe hr 8799 planets are not unusual but rather follow previously recognizedtrends, including a gravity dependence on the temperature of the l to tspectral transition--some reasons for which we discuss. we find the inferredmass of planet b is highly sensitive to whether or not we include the h and kband spectrum in our analysis. solutions for planets c and d are consistentwith the generally accepted constraints on the age of the primary star andorbital dynamics. we also confirm that, like in l and t dwarfs and solar systemgiant planets, non-equilibrium chemistry driven by atmospheric mixing is alsoimportant for these objects. given the preponderance of data suggesting thatthe l to t spectral type transition is gravity dependent, we present anexploratory evolution calculation that accounts for this effect. finally werecompute the the bolometric luminosity of all three planets.

1208.3795	three-dimensional atmospheric circulation of hot jupiters on highly  eccentric orbits	of the over 800 exoplanets detected to date, over half are on non-circularorbits, with eccentricities as high as 0.93. such orbits lead to time-variablestellar heating, which has implications for the planet's atmospheric dynamicalregime. however, little is known about this dynamical regime, and how it mayinfluence observations. therefore, we present a systematic study of hotjupiters on highly eccentric orbits using the sparc/mitgcm, a model whichcouples a three-dimensional general circulation model with a plane-parallel,two-stream, non-grey radiative transfer model. in our study, we vary theeccentricity and orbit-average stellar flux over a wide range. we demonstratethat the eccentric hot jupiter regime is qualitatively similar to that ofplanets on circular orbits; the planets possess a superrotating equatorial jetand exhibit large day-night temperature variations. we show that theseday-night heating variations induce momentum fluxes equatorward to maintain thesuperrotating jet throughout its orbit. as the eccentricity and/or stellar fluxis increased, the superrotating jet strengthens and narrows, due to a smallerrossby deformation radius. for a select number of model integrations, wegenerate full-orbit lightcurves and find that the timing of transit andsecondary eclipse viewed from earth with respect to periapse and apoapse cangreatly affect what we see in infrared (ir) lightcurves; the peak in ir fluxcan lead or lag secondary eclipse depending on the geometry. for those planetsthat have large day-night temperature variations and rapid rotation rates, wefind that the lightcurves exhibit "ringing" as the planet's hottest regionrotates in and out of view from earth. these results can be used to explainfuture observations of eccentric transiting exoplanets.

1305.4124	quantitatively assessing the role of clouds in the transmission spectrum  of gj 1214b	recent observations of the super-earth gj 1214b show that it has a relativelyfeatureless transmission spectrum. one suggestion is that these observationsindicate that the planet's atmosphere is vertically compact, perhaps due to awater-rich composition that yields a large mean molecular weight. anothersuggestion is that the atmosphere is hydrogen/helium-rich with clouds thatobscure predicted absorption features. previous models that incorporate cloudshave included their effect without a strong physical motivation for theirexistence. here, we present model atmospheres of gj 1214b that includephysically-motivated clouds of two types. we model the clouds that form as aresult of condensation in chemical equilibrium, as they likely do on browndwarfs, which include kcl and zns for this planet. we also include clouds thatform as a result of photochemistry, forming a hydrocarbon haze layer. we use aphotochemical kinetics model to understand the vertical distribution andavailable mass of haze-forming molecules. we model both solar andenhanced-metallicity cloudy models and determine the cloud properties necessaryto match observations. in enhanced-metallicity atmospheres, we find that theequilibrium clouds can match the observations of gj 1214b if they are loftedhigh into the atmosphere and have a low sedimentation efficiency (fsed=0.1). wefind that models with a variety of hydrocarbon haze properties can match theobservations. particle sizes from 0.01 to 0.25 micron can match thetransmission spectrum with haze-forming efficiencies as low as 1-5%.

1311.2085	directly imaged l-t transition exoplanets in the mid-infrared	gas-giant planets emit a large fraction of their light in the mid-infrared($\gtrsim$3$\mu$m), where photometry and spectroscopy are critical to ourunderstanding of the bulk properties of extrasolar planets. of particularimportance are the l and m-band atmospheric windows (3-5$\mu$m), which are thelongest wavelengths currently accessible to ground-based, high-contrastimagers. we present binocular lbt ao images of the hr 8799 planetary system insix narrow-band filters from 3-4$\mu$m, and a magellan ao image of the 2m1207planetary system in a broader 3.3$\mu$m band. these systems encompass the fiveknown exoplanets with luminosities consistent with l$\rightarrow$t transitionbrown dwarfs. our results show that the exoplanets are brighter and haveshallower spectral slopes than equivalent temperature brown dwarfs in awavelength range that contains the methane fundamental absorption feature(spanned by the narrowband filters and encompassed by the broader 3.3$\mu$mfilter). for 2m1207 b, we find that thick clouds and non-equilibrium chemistrycaused by vertical mixing can explain the object's appearance. for the hr 8799planets, we present new models that suggest the atmospheres must have patchyclouds, along with non-equilibrium chemistry. together, the presence of aheterogeneous surface and vertical mixing presents a picture of dynamicplanetary atmospheres in which both horizontal and vertical motions influencethe chemical and condensate profiles.

0802.0327	atmospheric circulation of hot jupiters: three-dimensional circulation  models of hd 209458b and hd 189733b with simplified forcing	we present global, three-dimensional numerical simulations of the atmosphericcirculation on hd 209458b and hd 189733b and calculate the infrared spectra andlight curves predicted by these simulations, which we compare with availableobservations. radiative heating/cooling is parameterized with a simplifiednewtonian relaxation scheme. our simulations develop day-night temperaturecontrasts that vary strongly with pressure. at low pressure (&lt;10 mbar), airflows from the substellar point toward the antistellar point, both along theequator and over the poles. at deeper levels, the flow develops an eastwardequatorial jet with speeds of 3-4 km/sec, with weaker westward flows at highlatitudes. this basic flow pattern is robust to variations in model resolution,gravity, radiative time constant, and initial temperature structure. nightsidespectra show deep absorption bands of h2o, co, and/or ch4, whereas on thedayside these absorption bands flatten out or even flip into emission. thisresults from the strong effect of dynamics on the vertical temperature-pressurestructure; the temperature decreases strongly with altitude on the nightsidebut becomes almost isothermal on the dayside. in spitzer bandpasses, ourpredicted planet-to-star flux ratios vary by a factor of 2-10 with orbitalphase, depending on the wavelength and chemistry. for hd 189733b, where adetailed 8-micron light curve has been obtained, we correctly produce theobserved phase offset of the flux maximum, but we do not explain the fluxminimum and we overpredict the total flux variation. this discrepancy likelyresults from the simplifications inherent in the newtonian relaxation schemeand provides motivation for incorporating realistic radiative transfer infuture studies.

1311.6322	a non-grey analytical model for irradiated atmospheres. ii: analytical  vs. numerical solutions	the recent discovery and characterization of the diversity of the atmospheresof exoplanets and brown dwarfs calls for the development of fast and accurateanalytical models. we quantify the accuracy of the analytical solution derivedin paper i for an irradiated, non-grey atmosphere by comparing it to astate-of-the-art radiative transfer model. then, using a grid of numericalmodels, we calibrate the different coefficients of our analytical model forirradiated solar-composition atmospheres of giant exoplanets and brown dwarfs.  we show that the so-called eddington approximation used to solve the angulardependency of the radiation field leads to relative errors of up to 5% on thetemperature profile. we show that for realistic non-grey planetary atmospheres,the presence of a convective zone that extends to optical depths smaller thanunity can lead to changes in the radiative temperature profile on the order of20% or more. when the convective zone is located at deeper levels (such as forstrongly irradiated hot jupiters), its effect on the radiative atmosphere issmaller. we show that the temperature inversion induced by a strong absorber inthe optical, such as tio or vo is mainly due to non-grey thermal effectsreducing the ability of the upper atmosphere to cool down rather than anenhanced absorption of the stellar light as previously thought.  finally, we provide a functional form for the coefficients of our analyticalmodel for solar-composition giant exoplanets and brown dwarfs. this leads tofully analytical pressure-temperature profiles for irradiated atmospheres witha relative accuracy better than 10% for gravities between 2.5m/s^2 and 250m/s^2 and effective temperatures between 100 k and 3000 k. this is a greatimprovement over the commonly used eddington boundary condition.

1401.1194	wise y dwarfs as probes of the brown dwarf-exoplanet connection	we have determined astrometric positions for 15 wise-discovered late-typebrown dwarfs (6 t8-9 and 9 y dwarfs) using the keck ii telescope, the spitzerspace telescope, and the hubble space telescope. combining data from 8 to 20epochs we derive parallactic and proper motions for these objects which put themajority within 15 parsecs. for ages greater than a few gyr, as suggested fromkinematic considerations, we find masses of 10-30 m$_{jup}$ based on standardmodels for the evolution of low mass objects with a range of mass estimates forindividual objects depending on the model in question. three of the coolestobjects have effective temperatures $\sim$ 350 k and inferred masses of 10-15m$_{jup}$. our parallactic distances confirm earlier photometric estimates(kirkpatrick et al. 2012) and direct measurements (marsh et al. 2013, beichmanet al. 2013, dupuy and krauss 2013) and suggest that the number of objects withmasses below about 15 m$_{jup}$ must be flat or declining relative to highermass objects. the masses of the coldest y dwarfs may be similar to thoseinferred for recently imaged planet-mass companions to nearby young stars.objects in this mass range, which appear to be rare in both the interstellarand proto-planetary environments, may both have formed via gravitationalfragmentation: the brown dwarfs in interstellar clouds and companion objects ina protoplanetary disk. in both cases, however, the fact that objects in thismass range are relatively infrequent, suggests that this mechanism must beinefficient in both environments.

1401.1499	the atmospheres of earth-like planets after giant impact events	it is now understood that the accretion of terrestrial planets naturallyinvolves giant collisions, the moon-forming impact being a well known example.in the aftermath of such collisions the surface of the surviving planet is veryhot and potentially detectable. here we explore the atmospheric chemistry,photochemistry, and spectral signatures of post-giant-impact terrestrialplanets enveloped by thick atmospheres consisting predominantly of co2, andh2o. the atmospheric chemistry and structure are computed self-consistently foratmospheres in equilibrium with hot surfaces with composition reflecting eitherthe bulk silicate earth (which includes the crust, mantle, atmosphere andoceans) or earth's continental crust. we account for all major molecular andatomic opacity sources including collision-induced absorption. we find thatthese atmospheres are dominated by h2o and co2, while the formation of ch4, andnh3 is quenched due to short dynamical timescales. other important constituentsare hf, hcl, nacl, and so2. these are apparent in the emerging spectra, and canbe indicative that an impact has occurred. the use of comprehensive opacitiesresults in spectra that are a factor of 2 lower in surface brightness in thespectral windows than predicted by previous models. the estimated luminositiesshow that the hottest post-giant-impact planets will be detectable withnear-infrared coronagraphs on the planned 30m-class telescopes. the 1-4umregion will be most favorable for such detections, offering bright features andbetter contrast between the planet and a potential debris disk. we derivecooling timescales on the order of 10^5-10^6 myrs, based on the modeledeffective temperatures. this leads to the possibility of discovering tens ofsuch planets in future surveys.

1401.1898	the atmospheric circulation of the super earth gj 1214b: dependence on  composition and metallicity	we present three-dimensional atmospheric circulation models of gj 1214b, a2.7 earth-radius, 6.5 earth-mass super earth detected by the mearth survey.here we explore the planet's circulation as a function of atmosphericmetallicity and atmospheric composition, modeling atmospheres with a lowmean-molecular weight (i.e., h2-dominated) and a high mean-molecular weight(i.e. water- and co2-dominated). we find that atmospheres with a lowmean-molecular weight have strong day-night temperature variations at pressuresabove the infrared photosphere that lead to equatorial superrotation. for theseatmospheres, the enhancement of atmospheric opacities with increasingmetallicity lead to shallower atmospheric heating, larger day-night temperaturevariations and hence stronger superrotation. in comparison, atmospheres with ahigh mean-molecular weight have larger day-night and equator-to-poletemperature variations than low mean-molecular weight atmospheres, butdifferences in opacity structure and energy budget lead to differences in jetstructure. the circulation of a water-dominated atmosphere is dominated byequatorial superrotation, while the circulation of a co2-dominated atmosphereis instead dominated by high-latitude jets. by comparing emergent flux spectraand lightcurves for 50x solar and water-dominated compositions, we show thatobservations in emission can break the degeneracy in determining theatmospheric composition of gj 1214b. the variation in opacity with wavelengthfor the water-dominated atmosphere leads to large phase variations within waterbands and small phase variations outside of water bands. the 50x solaratmosphere, however, yields small variations within water bands and large phasevariations at other characteristic wavelengths. these observations would bemuch less sensitive to clouds, condensates, and hazes than transitobservations.

1403.2438	temperature fluctuations as a source of brown dwarf variability	a number of brown dwarfs are now known to be variable with observedamplitudes as large as 10-30% at some wavelengths. while spatialinhomogeneities in cloud coverage and thickness are likely responsible for muchof the observed variability, it is possible that some of the variations arisefrom atmospheric temperature fluctuations instead of, or in addition to,clouds. to better understand the role that thermal variability might play wepresent a case study of brown dwarf variability using a newly-developedone-dimensional, time-stepping model of atmospheric thermal structure. we focuson the effects of thermal perturbations, intentionally simplifying the problemthrough omission of clouds and atmospheric circulation. model resultsdemonstrate that thermal perturbations occurring deep in the atmosphere (atpressures greater than 10 bar) of a model t-dwarf can be communicated to theupper atmosphere through radiative heating via the windows in near-infraredwater opacity. the response time depends on where in the atmosphere a thermalperturbation is introduced. we show that, for certain periodic perturbations,the emission spectrum can have complex, time- and wavelength-dependentbehaviors, including phase shifts in times of maximum flux observed atdifferent wavelengths. since different wavelengths probe different levels inthe atmosphere, these variations track a wavelength-dependent set of radiativeexchanges happening between different atmospheric levels as a perturbationevolves in time. we conclude that thermal--as well as cloud--fluctuations mustbe considered as possible contributors to the observed brown dwarf variability.

1403.6412	an approach for retrieving temperatures and abundances in brown dwarf  atmospheres	brown dwarf spectra contain a wealth of information about their molecularabundances, temperature structure, and gravity. we present a new data drivenretrieval approach, previously used in planetary atmosphere studies, to extractthe molecular abundances and temperature structure from brown dwarf spectra.the feasibility of the approach is first demonstrated on a synthetic browndwarf spectrum. given typical spectral resolutions, wavelength coverage, andnoise properties precisions of tens of percent can be obtained for themolecular abundances and 10s-100s k on the temperature profile. the techniqueis then applied to the well studied brown dwarf, gl 570d. from this spectralretrieval the spectroscopic radius is constrained to be 0.75 - 0.83$r_{\mathrm{j}}$, $\log(g)$ to be 5.13 - 5.46 and $t_{\mathrm{eff}}$ to bebetween 804 and 849 k. estimates for the range of abundances and allowedtemperature profiles are also derived. the results from our retrieval approachare in agreement with the self-consistent grid modeling results of saumon et al(2006). this new approach will allow us to address issues of compositionaldifferences between brown dwarfs and possibly their formation environments,disequilibrium chemistry, missing physics in current grid modeling approachesas well as a many other issues.

1404.0005	water clouds in y dwarfs and exoplanets	the formation of clouds affects brown dwarf and planetary atmospheres ofnearly all effective temperatures. iron and silicate condense in l dwarfatmospheres and dissipate at the l/t transition. minor species such as sulfidesand salts condense in mid-late t dwarfs. for brown dwarfs below teff=450 k,water condenses in the upper atmosphere to form ice clouds. currently over adozen objects in this temperature range have been discovered, and few previoustheoretical studies have addressed the effect of water clouds on brown dwarf orexoplanetary spectra. here we present a new grid of models that include theeffect of water cloud opacity. we find that they become optically thick inobjects below teff=350-375 k. unlike refractory cloud materials, water iceparticles are significantly non-gray absorbers; they predominantly scatter atoptical wavelengths through j band and absorb in the infrared with prominentfeatures, the strongest of which is at 2.8 microns. h2o, nh3, ch4, and h2 ciaare dominant opacity sources; less abundant species such as may also bedetectable, including the alkalis, h2s, and ph3. ph3, which has been detectedin jupiter, is expected to have a strong signature in the mid-infrared at 4.3microns in y dwarfs around teff=450 k; if disequilibrium chemistry increasesthe abundance of ph3, it may be detectable over a wider effective temperaturerange than models predict. we show results incorporating disequilibriumnitrogen and carbon chemistry and predict signatures of low gravity inplanetary- mass objects. lastly, we make predictions for the observability of ydwarfs and planets with existing and future instruments including the jameswebb space telescope and gemini planet imager.

1406.0863	spectral variability from the patchy atmospheres of t and y dwarfs	brown dwarfs of a variety of spectral types have been observed to bephotometrically variable. previous studies have focused on objects at the l/ttransition, where the iron and silicate clouds in l dwarfs break up ordissipate. however, objects outside of this transitional effective temperatureregime also exhibit variability. here, we present models for mid-late t dwarfsand y dwarfs. we present models that include patchy salt and sulfide clouds aswell as water clouds for the y dwarfs. we find that for objects over 375 k,patchy cloud opacity would generate the largest amplitude variability withinnear-infrared spectral windows. for objects under 375 k, water clouds alsobecome important and generate larger amplitude variability in the mid-infrared.we also present models in which we perturb the temperature structure atdifferent pressure levels of the atmosphere to simulate hot spots. these modelsshow the most variability in the absorption features between spectral windows.the variability is strongest at wavelengths that probe pressure levels at whichthe heating is the strongest. the most illustrative types of observations forunderstanding the physical processes underlying brown dwarf variability aresimultaneous, multi-wavelength observations that probe both inside and outsideof molecular absorption features.

1406.3314	titan solar occultation observations reveal transit spectra of a hazy  world	high altitude clouds and hazes are integral to understanding exoplanetobservations, and are proposed to explain observed featureless transit spectra.however, it is difficult to make inferences from these data because of the needto disentangle effects of gas absorption from haze extinction. here, we turn tothe quintessential hazy world -- titan -- to clarify how high altitude hazesinfluence transit spectra. we use solar occultation observations of titan'satmosphere from the visual and infrared mapping spectrometer (vims) aboardnasa's cassini spacecraft to generate transit spectra. data span 0.88-5 micronsat a resolution of 12-18 nm, with uncertainties typically smaller than 1%. ourapproach exploits symmetry between occultations and transits, producing transitradius spectra that inherently include the effects of haze multiple scattering,refraction, and gas absorption. we use a simple model of haze extinction toexplore how titan's haze affects its transit spectrum. our spectra show strongmethane absorption features, and weaker features due to other gases. mostimportantly, the data demonstrate that high altitude hazes can severely limitthe atmospheric depths probed by transit spectra, bounding observations topressures smaller than 0.1-10 mbar, depending on wavelength. unlike the usualassumption made when modeling and interpreting transit observations ofpotentially hazy worlds, the slope set by haze in our spectra is not flat, andcreates a variation in transit height whose magnitude is comparable to thosefrom the strongest gaseous absorption features. these findings have importantconsequences for interpreting future exoplanet observations, including thosefrom nasa's james webb space telescope.

1408.6283	methane, carbon monoxide, and ammonia in brown dwarfs and self-luminous  giant planets	we address disequilibrum abundances of some simple molecules in theatmospheres of solar composition brown dwarfs and self-luminous extrasolargiant planets using a kinetics-based 1d atmospheric chemistry model. ourapproach is to use the full kinetics model to survey the parameter space witheffective temperatures between 500 k and 1100 k. in all of these worldsequilibrium chemistry favors ch4 over co in the parts of the atmosphere thatcan be seen from earth, but in most disequilibrium favors co. the small surfacegravity of a planet strongly discriminates against ch4 when compared to anotherwise comparable brown dwarf. if vertical mixing is like jupiter's, thetransition from methane to co occurs at 500 k in a planet. sluggish verticalmixing can raise this to 600 k; but clouds or more vigorous vertical mixingcould lower this to 400 k. the comparable thresholds in brown dwarfs are$1100\pm100$ k. ammonia is also sensitive to gravity, but unlike ch4/co, thenh3/n2 ratio is insensitive to mixing, which makes nh3 a potential proxy forgravity. hcn may become interesting in high gravity brown dwarfs with verystrong vertical mixing. detailed analysis of the co-ch4 reaction networkreveals that the bottleneck to co hydrogenation goes through methanol, inpartial agreement with previous work. simple, easy to use quenching relationsare derived by fitting to the complete chemistry of the full ensemble ofmodels. these relations are valid for determining co, ch4, nh3, hcn, and co2abundances in the range of self-luminous worlds we have studied but may notapply if atmospheres are strongly heated at high altitudes by processes notconsidered here (e.g., wave breaking).

1409.5108	atmospheric circulation of eccentric hot jupiter hat-p-2b	the hot-jupiter hat-p-2b has become a prime target for spitzer spacetelescope observations aimed at understanding the atmospheric response ofexoplanets on highly eccentric orbits. here we present a suite ofthree-dimensional atmospheric circulation models for hat-p-2b that investigatethe effects of assumed atmospheric composition and rotation rate on globalscale winds and thermal patterns. we compare and contrast atmospheric modelsfor hat-p-2b, which assume one and five times solar metallicity, both with andwithout tio/vo as atmospheric constituents. additionally we compare models thatassume a rotation period of half, one, and two times the nominalpseudo-synchronous rotation period. we find that changes in assumed atmosphericmetallicity and rotation rate do not significantly affect model predictions ofthe planetary flux as a function of orbital phase. however, models in whichtio/vo are present in the atmosphere develop a transient temperature inversionbetween the transit and secondary eclipse events that results in significantvariations in the timing and magnitude of the peak of the planetary fluxcompared with models in which tio/vo are omitted from the opacity tables. wefind that no one single atmospheric model can reproduce the recently observedfull orbit phase curves at 3.6, 4.5 and 8.0 microns, which is likely due to achemical process not captured by our current atmospheric models for hat-p-2b.further modeling and observational efforts focused on understanding thechemistry of hat-p-2b's atmosphere are needed and could provide key insightsinto the interplay between radiative, dynamical, and chemical processes in awide range of exoplanet atmospheres.

1410.6512	on the cool side: modeling the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and giant  planets	the atmosphere of a brown dwarf or extrasolar giant planet controls thespectrum of radiation emitted by the object and regulates its cooling overtime. while the study of these atmospheres has been informed by decades ofexperience modeling stellar and planetary atmospheres, the distinctivecharacteristics of these objects present unique challenges to forward modeling.in particular, complex chemistry arising from molecule-rich atmospheres,molecular opacity line lists (sometimes running to 10 billion absorption linesor more) multiple cloud-forming condensates, and disequilibrium chemicalprocesses all combine to create a challenging task for any modeling effort.this review describes the process of incorporating these complexities intoone-dimensional radiative-convective equilibrium models of sub-stellar objects.we discuss the underlying mathematics as well as the techniques used to modelthe physics, chemistry, radiative transfer, and other processes relevant tounderstanding these atmospheres. the review focuses on the process of thecreation of atmosphere models and briefly presents some comparisons of modelpredictions to data. current challenges in the field and some comments on thefuture conclude the review.

1411.2911	hst rotational spectral mapping of two l-type brown dwarfs: variability  in and out of water bands indicates high-altitude haze layers	we present time-resolved near-infrared spectroscopy of two l5 dwarfs, 2massj18212815+1414010 and 2mass j15074759-1627386, observed with the wide fieldcamera 3 instrument on the hubble space telescope (hst). we study thewavelength dependence of rotation-modulated flux variations between 1.1 $\mu$mand 1.7 $\mu$m. we find that the water absorption bands of the two l5 dwarfs at1.15 $\mu$m and 1.4 $\mu$m vary at similar amplitudes as the adjacentcontinuum. this differs from the results of previous hst observations of l/ttransition dwarfs, in which the water absorption at 1.4 $\mu$m displaysvariations of about half of the amplitude at other wavelengths. we find thatthe relative amplitude of flux variability out of the water band with respectto that in the water band shows a increasing trend from the l5 dwarfs towardthe early t dwarfs. we utilize the models of saumon &amp; marley (2008) and findthat the observed variability of the l5 dwarfs can be explained by the presenceof spatially varying high-altitude haze layers above the condensate clouds.therefore, our observations show that the heterogeneity of haze layers - thedriver of the variability - must be located at very low pressures, where eventhe water opacity is negligible. in the near future, the rotational spectralmapping technique could be utilized for other atomic and molecular species toprobe different pressure levels in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs andexoplanets and uncover both horizontal and vertical cloud structures.

1411.3051	weather on other worlds. ii. survey results: spots are ubiquitous on l  and t dwarfs	we present results from the "weather on other worlds" spitzer explorationscience program to investigate photometric variability in l and t dwarfs,usually attributed to patchy clouds. we surveyed 44 l3-t8 dwarfs, spanning arange of $j-k_s$ colors and surface gravities. we find that 14/23 (61%; 95%confidence interval: 41%-78%) of our single l3-l9.5 dwarfs are variable withpeak-to-peak amplitudes between 0.2% and 1.5%, and 5/16 (31%; 95% confidenceinterval: 14%-56%) of our single t0-t8 dwarfs are variable with amplitudesbetween 0.8% and 4.6%. after correcting for sensitivity, we find that 80% (95%confidence interval: 53%-100%) of l dwarfs vary by &gt;0.2%, and 36% (95%confidence interval: 19%-52%) of t dwarfs vary by &gt;0.4%. given viewing geometryconsiderations, we conclude that photospheric heterogeneities causing &gt;0.2%3-5-micron flux variations are present on virtually all l dwarfs, and probablyon most t dwarfs. a third of l dwarf variables show irregular light curves,indicating that l dwarfs may have multiple spots that evolve over a singlerotation. also, approximately a third of the periodicities are on time scales&gt;10 h, suggesting that slowly-rotating brown dwarfs may be common. we observean increase in the maximum amplitudes over the entire spectral type range,revealing a potential for greater temperature contrasts in t dwarfs than in ldwarfs. we find a tentative association (92% confidence) between low surfacegravity and high-amplitude variability among l3-l5.5 dwarfs. although we cannot confirm whether lower gravity is also correlated with a higher incidence ofvariables, the result is promising for the characterization of directly imagedyoung extrasolar planets through variability.

(2007)giant planet thermal evolution models that include formation by coreaccretion-gas capture. these relatively cool "young jupiters" can be 1-6magnitudes fainter than predicted by standard cooling tracks that include atraditional initial condition, which may provide a diagnostic of formation. ifcorrect, this would make true jupiter-like planets much more difficult todetect at young ages than previously thought. since jupiter and saturn are ofdistinctly super-solar composition, we examine emitted spectra for modelplanets at both solar metallicity and a metallicity of 5 times solar. thesemetal-enhanced young jupiters have lower pressure photospheres than field browndwarfs of the same effective temperatures arising from both lower surfacegravities and enhanced atmospheric opacity. we highlight several diagnosticsfor enhanced metallicity. a stronger co absorption band at 4.5 $\mu$m for thewarmest objects is predicted. at all temperatures, enhanced flux in $k$ band isexpected due to reduced collisional induced absorption by h$_2$. this leads tocorrespondingly redder near infrared colors, which are redder than solarmetallicity models with the same surface gravity by up to 0.7 in $j-k$ and 1.5in $h-k$. molecular absorption band depths increase as well, most significantlyfor the coolest objects. we also qualitatively assess the changes to emittedspectra due to nonequilibrium chemistry.

0705.2457	analysis of spitzer spectra of irradiated planets: evidence for water  vapor?	published mid infrared spectra of transiting planets hd 209458b and hd189733b, obtained during secondary eclipse by the infrared spectrograph (irs)aboard the spitzer space telescope, are predominantly featureless. inparticular these flux ratio spectra do not exhibit an expected feature arisingfrom water vapor absorption short-ward of 10 um. here we suggest that, in theabsence of flux variability, the spectral data for hd 189733b are inconsistentwith 8 um-photometry obtained with spitzer's infrared array camera (irac),perhaps an indication of problems with the challenging reduction of the irsspectra. the irac point, along with previously published secondary eclipsephotometry for hd 189733b, are in good agreement with a one-dimensional modelof hd 189733b that clearly shows absorption due to water vapor in the emergentspectrum. we are not able to draw firm conclusions regarding the irs data forhd 209458b, but spectra predicted by 1d and 3d atmosphere models fit the dataadequately, without adjustment of the water abundance or reliance on cloudopacity. we argue that the generally good agreement between model spectra andirs spectra of brown dwarfs with atmospheric temperatures similar to thesehighly irradiated planets lends confidence in the modeling procedure.

1508.04787	$\beta$ pictoris' inner disk in polarized light and new orbital  parameters for $\beta$ pictoris b	we present $h$-band observations of $\beta$ pic with the gemini planetimager's (gpi's) polarimetry mode that reveal the debris disk between ~0.3" (~6au) and ~1.7" (~33 au), while simultaneously detecting $\beta$ pic $b$. thepolarized disk image was fit with a dust density model combined with ahenyey-greenstein scattering phase function. the best fit model indicates adisk inclined to the line of sight ($\phi=85.27{\deg}^{+0.26}_{-0.19}$) with aposition angle $\theta_{pa}=30.35{\deg}^{+0.29}_{-0.28}$ (slightly offset fromthe main outer disk, $\theta_{pa}\approx29{\deg}$), that extends from an innerdisk radius of $23.6^{+0.9}_{-0.6}$ au to well outside gpi's field of view. inaddition, we present an updated orbit for $\beta$ pic $b$ based on newastrometric measurements taken in gpi's spectroscopic mode spanning 14 months.the planet has a semi-major axis of $a=9.2^{+1.5}_{-0.4}$au, with aneccentricity $e\leq 0.26$. the position angle of the ascending node is$\omega=31.75{\deg}\pm0.15$, offset from both the outer main disk and the innerdisk seen in the gpi image. the orbital fit constrains the stellar mass of$\beta$ pic to $1.60\pm0.05 m_{\odot}$. dynamical sculpting by $\beta$ pic $b$cannot easily account for the following three aspects of the inferred diskproperties: 1) the modeled inner radius of the disk is farther out thanexpected if caused by $\beta$ pic b; 2) the mutual inclination of the innerdisk and $\beta$ pic $b$ is $4{\deg}$, when it is expected to be closer tozero; and 3) the aspect ratio of the disk ($h_0 = 0.137^{+0.005}_{-0.006}$) islarger than expected from interactions with $\beta$ pic $b$ or self-stirring bythe disk's parent bodies.

1511.01492	thermal emission and albedo spectra of super earths with flat  transmission spectra	planets larger than earth and smaller than neptune are some of the mostnumerous in the galaxy, but observational efforts to understand this populationhave proved challenging because optically thick clouds or hazes at highaltitudes obscure molecular features (kreidberg et al. 2014b). we presentmodels of super earths that include thick clouds and hazes and predict theirtransmission, thermal emission, and reflected light spectra. very thick, loftedclouds of salts or sulfides in high metallicity (1000x solar) atmospherescreate featureless transmission spectra in the near-infrared. photochemicalhazes with a range of particle sizes also create featureless transmissionspectra at lower metallicities. cloudy thermal emission spectra have mutedfeatures more like blackbodies, and hazy thermal emission spectra have emissionfeatures caused by an inversion layer at altitudes where the haze forms. closeanalysis of reflected light from warm (~400-800 k) planets can distinguishcloudy spectra, which have moderate albedos (0.05-0.20), from hazy models,which are very dark (0.0-0.03). reflected light spectra of cold planets (~200k) accessible to a space-based visible light coronagraph will have high albedosand large molecular features that will allow them to be more easilycharacterized than the warmer transiting planets. we suggest a number ofcomplementary observations to characterize this population of planets,including transmission spectra of hot (&gt;1000 k) targets, thermal emissionspectra of warm targets using the james webb space telescope (jwst), highspectral resolution (r~10^5) observations of cloudy targets, and reflectedlight spectral observations of directly-imaged cold targets. despite the dearthof features observed in super earth transmission spectra to date, differentobservations will provide rich diagnostics of their atmospheres.

1512.02706	discovery of rotational modulations in the planetary-mass companion  2m1207b: intermediate rotation period and heterogeneous clouds in a low  gravity atmosphere	rotational modulations of brown dwarfs have recently provided powerfulconstraints on the properties of ultra-cool atmospheres, including longitudinaland vertical cloud structures and cloud evolution. furthermore, periodic lightcurves directly probe the rotational periods of ultra-cool objects. we presenthere, for the first time, time-resolved high-precision photometric measurementsof a planetary-mass companion, 2m1207b. we observed the binary system withhst/wfc3 in two bands and with two spacecraft roll angles. using point spreadfunction-based photometry, we reach a nearly photon-noise limited accuracy forboth the primary and the secondary. while the primary is consistent with a flatlight curve, the secondary shows modulations that are clearly detected in thecombined light curve as well as in different subsets of the data. theamplitudes are 1.36% in the f125w and 0.78% in the f160w filters, respectively.by fitting sine waves to the light curves, we find a consistent period of$10.7^{+1.2}_{-0.6}$ hours and similar phases in both bands. the j- and h-bandamplitude ratio of 2m1207b is very similar to a field brown dwarf that hasidentical spectral type but different j-h color. importantly, our study alsomeasures, for the first time, the rotation period for a directly imagedextra-solar planetary-mass companion.

1512.07090	neptune's dynamic atmosphere from kepler k2 observations: implications  for brown dwarf light curve analyses	observations of neptune with the kepler space telescope yield a 49-day lightcurve with 98% coverage at a 1-minute cadence. a significant signature in thelight curve comes from discrete cloud features. we compare results extractedfrom the light curve data with contemporaneous disk-resolved imaging of neptunefrom the keck 10-meter telescope at 1.65 microns and hubble space telescopevisible imaging acquired 9 months later. this direct comparison validates thefeature latitudes assigned to the k2 light curve periods based on neptune'szonal wind profile, and confirms observed cloud feature variability. althoughneptune's clouds vary in location and intensity on short and long time scales,a single large discrete storm seen in keck imaging dominates the k2 and hubblelight curves; smaller or fainter clouds likely contribute to short-termbrightness variability. the k2 neptune light curve, in conjunction with ourimaging data, provides context for the interpretation of current and futurebrown dwarf and extrasolar planet variability measurements. in particular wesuggest that the balance between large, relatively stable, atmospheric featuresand smaller, more transient, clouds controls the character of substellaratmospheric variability. atmospheres dominated by a few large spots may showinherently greater light curve stability than those which exhibit a greaternumber of smaller features.

astro-ph;0205305	l-dwarf variability: i-band observations	we report on the results of an i-band photometric variability survey ofeighteen l dwarfs. we find that seven exhibit statistically significantvariations above the 95.4% confidence level with root-mean-square scatter(including photometric errors) between 0.010 and 0.083 mag. another fivetargets have variability probabilities ~80%, suggesting that these are likelyvariable objects. three of the variable objects display significant peaks in aclean periodogram that are several times higher than the noise. the period for2mass 0345+25 is clearly not intrinsic to the object and can be dismissed. theperiods found for 2mass 0746+20ab and 2mass 1300+19 are unique but longer thanthose periods likely from rotation velocity measurements and they do notrepresent periodic behavior in the light curve that persists through the entiredata set. these observations suggest that we are not observing the rotationmodulation of a long-lived albedo feature. instead, rapid evolution ofatmospheric features is likely causing the non-periodic variability. theremaining variable objects show no prominent features in their light curves,suggesting even more rapid evolution of atmospheric features. we argue againstthe existence of magnetic spots in these atmospheres and favor the idea thatnon-uniform condensate coverage is responsible for these variations. themagnetic reynolds number in the atmosphere of l dwarfs is too small to supportthe formation of magnetic spots. in contrast, silicate and iron clouds areexpected to form in the photospheres of l dwarfs. inhomogeneities in such clouddecks and the evolution of the inhomogeneities can plausibly produce theobserved photometric variations.

0705.3901	multiepoch radial velocity observations of l dwarfs	we report on the development of a technique for precise radial-velocitymeasurements of cool stars and brown dwarfs in the near infrared. our techniqueis analogous to the iodine (i2) absorption cell method that has proven sosuccessful in the optical regime. we rely on telluric ch4 absorption featuresto serve as a wavelength reference, relative to which we measure doppler shiftsof the co and h2o features in the spectra of our targets. we apply thistechnique to high-resolution (r~50,000) spectra near 2.3 micron of nine ldwarfs taken with the phoenix instrument on gemini-south and demonstrate atypical precision of 300 m/s. we conduct simulations to estimate our expectedprecision and show our performance is currently limited by the signal-to-noiseof our data. we present estimates of the rotational velocities and systemicvelocities of our targets. with our current data, we are sensitive tocompanions with m sin i &gt; 2mj in orbits with periods less than three days. weidentify no companions in our current data set. future observations withimproved signal-to-noise should result in radial-velocity precision of 100 m/sfor l dwarfs.

astro-ph;0612671	planetary radii across five orders of magnitude in mass and stellar  insolation: application to transits	to aid in the physical interpretation of planetary radii constrained throughobservations of transiting planets, or eventually direct detections, we computemodel radii of pure hydrogen-helium, water, rock, and iron planets, along withvarious mixtures. masses ranging from 0.01 earth masses to 10 jupiter masses atorbital distances of 0.02 to 10 au are considered. for hydrogen-helium richplanets, our models are the first to couple planetary evolution to stellarirradiation over a wide range of orbital separations (0.02 to 10 au) through anon-gray radiative-convective equilibrium atmosphere model. stellar irradiationretards the contraction of giant planets, but its effect is not a simplefunction of the irradiation level: a planet at 1 au contracts as slowly as aplanet at 0.1 au. for hydrogen-helium planets, we consider cores up to 90% ofthe total planet mass, comparable to those of uranus and neptune. if "hotneptunes" have maintained their original masses and are not remnants of moremassive planets, radii of 0.30-0.45 times jupiter's radius are expected. waterplanets are ~40-50% larger than rocky planets, independent of mass. finally, weprovide tables of planetary radii at various ages and compositions, and forice-rock-iron planets we fit our results to analytic functions, which willallow for quick composition estimates, given masses and radii, or massestimates, given only planetary radii. these results will assist in theinterpretation of observations for both the current transiting planet surveysas well as upcoming space missions, including corot and kepler.

astro-ph;0701398	moderate resolution spitzer infrared spectrograph (irs) observations of  m, l, and t dwarfs	we present 10 - 19 um moderate resolution spectra of ten m dwarfs, one ldwarf, and two t dwarf systems obtained with the infrared spectrograph (irs)onboard the spitzer space telescope. the irs allows us to examine molecularspectroscopic features/lines at moderate spectral resolution in a heretoforeuntapped wavelength regime. these r~600 spectra allow for a more detailedexamination of clouds, non-equilibrium chemistry, as well as the molecularfeatures of h2o, nh3, and other trace molecular species that are the hallmarksof these objects. a cloud-free model best fits our mid-infrared spectrum of thet1 dwarf epsilon indi ba, and we find that the nh3 feature in epsilon indi bbis best explained by a non-equilibrium abundance due to vertical transport inits atmosphere. we examined a set of objects (mostly m dwarfs) in multiplesystems to look for evidence of emission features, which might indicate anatmospheric temperature inversion, as well as trace molecular species; however,we found no evidence of either.

0809.2089	atmospheric circulation of hot jupiters: coupled radiative-dynamical  general circulation model simulations of hd 189733b and hd 209458b	we present global, three-dimensional numerical simulations of hd 189733b andhd 209458b that couple the atmospheric dynamics to a realistic representationof non-gray cloud-free radiative transfer. the model, which we call thesubstellar and planetary atmospheric radiation and circulation (sparc) model,adopts the mitgcm for the dynamics and uses the radiative model of mckay,marley, fortney, and collaborators for the radiation. like earlier work withsimplified forcing, our simulations develop a broad eastward equatorial jet,mean westward flow at higher latitudes, and substantial flow over the poles atlow pressure. for hd 189733b, our simulations without tio and vo opacity canexplain the broad features of the observed 8 and 24-micron light curves,including the modest day-night flux variation and the fact that the planet/starflux ratio peaks before the secondary eclipse. our simulations also providereasonable matches to the spitzer secondary-eclipse depths at 4.5, 5.8, 8, 16,and 24 microns and the groundbased upper limit at 2.2 microns. however, wesubstantially underpredict the 3.6-micron secondary-eclipse depth, suggestingthat our simulations are too cold in the 0.1-1 bar region. predicted temporalvariability in secondary-eclipse depths is ~1% at spitzer bandpasses,consistent with recent observational upper limits at 8 microns. we also showthat nonsynchronous rotation can significantly alter the jet structure. for hd209458b, we include tio and vo opacity; these simulations develop a hot (&gt;2000k) dayside stratosphere. despite this stratosphere, we do not reproduce currentspitzer photometry of this planet. light curves in spitzer bandpasses showmodest phase variation and satisfy the observational upper limit on day-nightphase variation at 8 microns.
