0706.2936	high-resolution spectra observed for spy. ii. db and dba stars	we present a detailed spectroscopic analysis of the stars withhelium-dominated spectra in the eso supernova ia progenitor survey (spy).atmospheric parameters, masses, and abundances of trace hydrogen are determinedand discussed in the context of spectral evolution of white dwarfs. our finalsample contains 71 objects, of which 6 are new detections and 14 arereclassified from db to dba because of the presence of h lines. 55% of the dbsample show hydrogen and are thus dba, a significantly higher fraction thanfound before. the large incidence of dba, and the derived total hydrogen massesare compatible with the scenario that dbs ``reappear'' around 30000 k from thedb gap by mixing and diluting a thin hydrogen layer of the order of e-15 msun.this hydrogen mass is then during the evolution continuously increased byinterstellar accretion. there are indications that the accretion rate increasessmoothly with age or decreasing temperature, a trend which continuous evenbelow the current low temperature limit (dufour 2006). a remaining mystery isthe low accretion rate of h compared to that of ca observed in the dbza, but astellar wind extending down to the lowest temperatures with decreasing strengthmight be part of the solution.

0908.4148	metal-rich absorbers at high redshifts: abundance patterns	(abbreviated) from six spectra of high-z qsos, we select eleven metal-rich,z&gt;=z_solar, and optically-thin to the ionizing radiation, n(hi)&lt;10^17 cm^-2,absorption systems ranging between z=1.5 and z=2.9 and revealing lines ofdifferent ions in subsequent ionization stages. the majority of the systems (10from 11) show abundance patterns which relate them to outflows from low andintermediate mass stars. all systems have sub-kpc linear sizes along theline-of-sight with many less than 20 pc. in several systems, silicon isdeficient, presumably due to the depletion onto dust grains in the envelopes ofdust-forming stars and the subsequent gas-dust separation. at any value of[c/h], nitrogen can be either deficient, [n/c]&lt;0, or enhanced, [n/c]&gt;0, whichsupposes that the nitrogen enrichment occurs irregularly. in some cases, thelines of mgii 2796, 2803 appear to be shifted, probably as a result of anenhanced content of heavy isotopes 25mg and 26mg in the absorbing gas relativeto the solar isotopic composition. seven absorbers are characterized by lowmean ionization parameter u, log u&lt;-2.3, among them only one system has aredshift z&gt;2 whereas all others are found at z ~= 1.8. comparing the spacenumber density of metal-rich absorbers with the comoving density ofstar-forming galaxies at z ~= 2, we estimate that the circumgalactic volume ofeach galaxy is populated by 10^7 - 10^8 such absorbers with total mass&lt;=1/100th of the stellar galactic mass. possible effects of high metal contenton the peak values of star-forming and agn activities at z~2 are discussed.

0911.3732	searching for chameleon-like scalar fields with the ammonia method	(abridged) the ammonia method, which has been proposed to explore theelectron-to-proton mass ratio, mu = m_e/m_p, is applied to nearby dark cloudsin the milky way. this ratio, which is measured in different physicalenvironments of high (terrestrial) and low (interstellar) densities of baryonicmatter is supposed to vary in chameleon-like scalar field models, which predictstrong dependence of both masses and coupling constant on the local matterdensity. high resolution spectral observations of molecular cores in lines ofnh3 (j,k) = (1,1), hc3n j = 2-1, and n2h+ j = 1-0 were performed at three radiotelescopes to measure the radial velocity offsets, deltav = v_rot - v_inv,between the inversion transition of nh3 (1,1) and the rotational transitions ofother molecules with different sensitivities to the parameter dmm = (mu_obs -mu_lab)/mu_lab. the measured values of deltav exhibit a statisticallysignificant velocity offset of 23 +/- 4_stat +/- 3_sys m/s. when interpreted interms of the electron-to-proton mass ratio variation, this infers that dmm =(2.2 +/- 0.4_stat +/- 0.3_sys)x10^{-8}. if only a conservative upper bound isconsidered, then the maximum offset between ammonia and the other molecules is|deltav| &lt;= 30 m/s. this gives the most accurate reference point at z = 0 fordmm: |dmm| &lt;= 3x10^{-8}.

1004.0783	searching for spatial variations of alpha^2/mu in the milky way	(abridged) a procedure is suggested to explore the value of f = alpha^2/mu,where mu = m_e/m_p is the electron-to-proton mass ratio, and alpha is thefine-structure constant. the fundamental physical constants, which are measuredin different physical environments of high (terrestrial) and low (interstellar)densities of baryonic matter are supposed to vary in chameleon-like scalarfield models, which predict that both masses and coupling constant may dependon the local matter density. the parameter delta f/f = (f_obs - f_lab)/f_labcan be estimated from the radial velocity offset, delta v = v_rot-v_fs, betweenthe low-laying rotational transitions in carbon monoxide 13co and thefine-structure transitions in atomic carbon [ci]. a model-dependent constrainton delta alpha/alpha can be obtained from delta f/f using delta mu/muindependently measured from the ammonia method. currently available radioastronomical datasets provide an upper limit on |delta v| &lt; 110 m/s (1sigma).when interpreted in terms of the spatial variation of f, this gives |delta f/f|&lt; 3.7*10^-{7}. an order of magnitude improvement of this limit will allow us totest independently a non-zero value of delta mu/mu = (2.2 +/- 0.4_stat +/-0.3_sys)*10^{-8} recently found with the ammonia method. taking into accountthat the ammonia method restricts the spatial variation of mu at the level of|delta mu/mu| &lt;= 3*10^{-8} and assuming that delta f/f is the same in theentire interstellar medium, one obtains that the spatial variation of alphadoes not exceed the value |delta alpha/alpha| &lt; 2*10^{-7}. since extragalacticgas clouds have densities similar to those in the interstellar medium, thebound on delta alpha/alpha is also expected to be less than 2*10^{-7} at highredshift if no significant temporal dependence of alpha is present.

1008.1160	searching for chameleon-like scalar fields with the ammonia method. ii.  mapping of cold molecular cores in nh3 and hc3n lines	(abridged) in our previous work we found a statistically significant offsetdelta v = 27 m/s between the radial velocities of the hc3n(2-1) and nh3(1,1)transitions observed in molecular cores from the milky way. this may indicatethat the electron-to-proton mass ratio, mu = m_e/m_p, increases by 3x10^{-8}when measured under interstellar conditions with matter densities of more than10 orders of magnitude lower as compared with laboratory (terrestrial)environments. we now map four molecular cores l1498, l1512, l1517, and l1400kselected from our previous sample in order to estimate systematic effects indelta v due to possible velocity gradients. we find that in two cores l1498 andl1512 the nh3(1,1) and hc3n(2-1) transitions closely trace the same materialand show an offset of delta v = 26.9 +/- 1.2_stat +/- 3.0_sys m/s throughoutthe entire clouds. the measured velocity offset, being expressed in terms ofdelta mu = (mu_obs - mu_lab)/mu_lab, gives delta mu = (26 +/- 1_stat +/-3_sys)x10^{-9}.

1012.0642	searching for chameleon-like scalar fields	using the 32-m medicina, 45-m nobeyama, and 100-m effelsberg telescopes wefound a statistically significant velocity offset delta v = 27 +/- 3 m/s(1sigma) between the inversion transition in nh3(1,1) and low-j rotationaltransitions in n2h+(1-0) and hc3n(2-1) arising in cold and dense molecularcores in the milky way. systematic shifts of the line centers caused byturbulent motions and velocity gradients, possible non-thermal hyperfinestructure populations, pressure and optical depth effects are shown to be lowerthan or about 1 m/s and thus can be neglected in the total error budget. thereproducibility of delta v at the same facility (effelsberg telescope) on ayear-to-year basis is found to be very good. since the frequencies of theinversion and rotational transitions have different sensitivities to variationsin mu = m_e/m_p, the revealed non-zero delta v may imply that mu changes whenmeasured at high (terrestrial) and low (interstellar) matter densities aspredicted by chameleon-like scalar field models - candidates to the dark energycarrier. thus we are testing whether scalar field models have chameleon-typeinteractions with ordinary matter. the measured velocity offset corresponds tothe ratio delta mu/mu = (mu_space - mu_lab)/mu_lab of (26 +/- 3)x10^{-9}(1sigma).

1106.1569	methanol as a tracer of fundamental constants	the methanol molecule ch3oh has a complex microwave spectrum with a largenumber of very strong lines. this spectrum includes purely rotationaltransitions as well as transitions with contributions of the internal degree offreedom associated with the hindered rotation of the oh group. the latter takesplace due to the tunneling of hydrogen through the potential barriers betweenthree equivalent potential minima. such transitions are highly sensitive tochanges in the electron-to-proton mass ratio, mu = m_e/m_p, and have differentresponses to mu-variations. the highest sensitivity is found for the mixedrotation-tunneling transitions at low frequencies. observing methanol linesprovides more stringent limits on the hypothetical variation of mu than ammoniaobservation with the same velocity resolution. we show that the best qualityradio astronomical data on methanol maser lines constrain the variability of muin the milky way at the level of |delta mu/mu| &lt; 28x10^{-9} (1sigma) which isin line with the previously obtained ammonia result, |delta mu/mu| &lt; 29x10^{-9}(1\sigma). this estimate can be further improved if the rest frequencies of thech3oh microwave lines will be measured more accurately.

astro-ph;0605150	the uv spectrum of hs1700+6416 ii. fuse observations of the heii lyman  alpha forest	we present the far-uv spectrum of the quasar hs1700+6416 taken with fuse.this qso provides the second line of sight with the heii absorption resolvedinto a ly alpha forest structure. since hs1700+6416 is slightly less redshifted(z=2.72) than he2347-4342, we only probe the post-reionization phase of heii,seen in the evolution of the heii opacity, which is consistent with a simplepower law. the heii/hi ratio eta is estimated using a line profile-fittingprocedure and an apparent optical depth approach, respectively. the expectedmetal line absorption in the far-uv is taken into account as well as molecularabsorption of galactic h_2. about 27% of the eta values are affected by metalline absorption. in order to investigate the applicability of the analysismethods, we create simple artificial spectra based on the statisticalproperties of the hi ly alpha forest. the analysis of the artificial datademonstrates that the apparent optical depth method as well as the lineprofile-fitting procedure lead to confident results for restricted data samplesonly (12.0 &lt; log n(hi) &lt; 13.0). the reasons are saturation in the case of theapparent optical depth and thermal line widths in the case of the profile fits.furthermore, applying the methods to the unrestricted data set may mimic acorrelation between eta and the strength of the hi absorption. for therestricted data samples a scatter of 10 - 15% in eta would be expected even ifthe underlying value is constant. the observed scatter is significantly largerthan expected, indicating that the intergalactic radiation background is indeedfluctuating. in the redshift range 2.58 &lt; z &lt; 2.72, where the data quality isbest, we find eta ~ 100, suggesting a contribution of soft sources likegalaxies to the uv background.

astro-ph;0605419	the uv spectrum of hs1700+6416 i. predicting the metal line content of  the far uv spectrum	in preparation of a study of the heii/hi ratio towards the bright qsohs1700+6416, we predict the metal line content of the far-uv spectral range bymodelling 18 metal absorption line systems with redshifts 0.2&lt;z&lt;2.6 identifiedin the spectrum of this quasar. for that purpose, we investigate the spectralenergy distribution of the metagalactic ionizing radiation field. simplephotoionization models based on 8 different shapes of the ionizing backgroundare tested for each system. the adopted energy distributions comprise thehaardt &amp; madau (2001, hm) model of metagalactic uv background as well astypical spectra of agn and starburst galaxies. the models are evaluated and thefavoured one is estimated. we find that the majority of the considered systemsis best reproduced with a hm-like ionizing radiation, where the heii break,formally located at 4 ryd, is shifted to lower energies (~3 ryd), probably dueto the opacity of the higher heii lyman series lines. the remaining systems canbe reasonably described with models based on the unmodified hm background orthe spectra of agn or starburst galaxies. this finding supports the idea thatthe uv background is spatially variable due to both igm opacity variations andto local sources. in comparison to an unmodified hm background, the resultingionizing spectrum leads to carbon abundances lower by ~0.5 dex. furthermore, ifthe ionizing radiation field as determined from metal line systems was typicalfor the igm, the expected heii/hi ratio would be 150 to 190.

astro-ph;0608332	bright metal-poor stars from the hamburg/eso survey. i. selection and  follow-up observations from 329 fields	we present a sample of 1777 bright (9&lt;b&lt;14) metal-poor candidates selectedfrom the hamburg/eso survey (hes). despite saturation effects present in thered portion of the hes objective-prism spectra, the data were recoverable andquantitative selection criteria could be applied to select the sample. analysesof medium-resolution (~2 a) follow-up spectroscopy of the entire sample,obtained with several 2 to 4 m class telescopes, yielded 145 new metal-poorstars with metallicity [fe/h]&lt;-2.0, of which 79 have [fe/h]&lt;-2.5, and 17 have[fe/h]&lt;-3.0. we also obtained c/fe estimates for all these stars. from this, wefind a frequency of c-enhanced ([c/fe]&gt;1.0) metal-poor ([fe/h]&lt;-2.0) giants of9% +- 2%, which is lower than previously reported. however, the frequencyraises to similar (&gt;20%) and higher values with increasing distance from thegalactic plane. although the numbers of stars at low metallicity are fallingrapidly at the lowest metallicities, there is evidence that the fraction ofcarbon-enhanced metal-poor stars is increasing rapidly as a function ofdeclining metallicity. for ~60 objects, high-resolution data have already beenobtained; one of these, he 1327-2326, is the new record holder for the mostiron-deficient star known.

astro-ph;0608342	the evolution of lyman alpha absorbers in the redshift range 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.9	we investigate the evolution and the statistical properties of the lyaabsorbers of the intergalactic medium (igm) in the largely unexplored redshiftrange z=0.5-1.9. we use high-resolution (r &gt; 30,000) uv (stis) and optical(vlt/uves and keck/hires) spectra of nine bright quasars with z_em &lt; 1.94. themain results for the combined lya line sample are summarized as follows: 1. theevolution of the number density of the absorbers can be described by the powerlaw dn/dz ~ (1+z)^gamma. the number density of the low column density linesdecreases with decreasing z with gamma=0.74+-0.31 in the interval z=0.7-1.9. acomparison with results at higher redshifts shows that it is decelerated in theexplored redshift range and turns into a flat evolution for z -&gt; 0. thestronger absorbers thin out faster (gamma=1.50+-0.45). the break in theirevolution predicted for z=1.5-1.7 cannot be seen down to z=0.7. on the otherhand, a comparison with values from the literature for the local number densitygives a hint that this break occurs at lower redshift. 2. the distribution ofthe column densities of the absorbers is complete down to n_hi=10^12.90 cm^-2.it can be approximated by a single power law with the exponent beta=1.60+-0.03over almost three orders of magnitude. beta is redshift independent. 3. the lyalines with lower column densities as well as the higher column density linesshow marginal clustering with a 2 sigma significance over short distances(delta v &lt; 200 km/s and delta v &lt; 100 km/s, respectively). we do not see anydifference in the clustering with either column density or redshift.

astro-ph;0609718	hot subdwarfs from the eso supernova ia progenitor survey: ii.  atmospheric parameters of subdwarf o stars	we address the origin and evolutionary status of hot subdwarf stars bystudying the optical spectral properties of 58 subdwarf o (sdo) stars.combining them with the results of our previously studied subdwarf b (sdb)stars, we aim at investigating possible evolutionary links. we analyzehigh-resolution eso vlt uves spectra from the eso supernova ia progenitorsurvey (spy). effective temperatures, gravities, and helium abundances aredetermined simultaneously by fitting the profiles of h and he lines usingdedicated synthetic spectra in nlte. evidence for cool companions to 8 sdos aswell as a binary consisting of two sdo stars is found. a correlation between heabundances and the presence of carbon and/or nitrogen lines emerges: belowsolar he abundance, no sdo shows c or n lines. in contrast, c and/or n linesare present in all sdos with super- solar he abundance. we thus use the solarhe abundance to divide our sample into he-deficient and he-enriched sdos. whilehe-deficient sdos are scattered in a wide range of the teff-log(g)-diagram,most of the he-enriched sdos cluster in a narrow region at teff = 40,000 ...50,000k and log(g)=5.5 ... 6.0. an evolu- tionary link between sdbs and sdosappears plausible only for the he-deficient sdos indicating that they are thelikely successors to sdbs. the properties of he-enriched sdos cannot beexplained with canonical single star evolutionary models. alternative scenarios(late hot flasher) as well as for binary evolution (white dwarf merger;post-rgb evolution) are tested. while we regard the post-rgb scenario asinappropriate, the white dwarf merger and the late hot flasher scenarios remainviable to explain the origin of he-enriched sdos.

astro-ph;0610366	fluctuations of the intergalactic uv background towards two lines of  sight	we present a reanalysis of the heii lyman alpha absorption towards thequasars hs1700+6416 and he2347-4342 using new high s/n, optical observations.an alternative analysis method is applied, which fits the high quality, opticalhi data directly to the heii spectrum. the results are compared to thoseinferred from standard line profile analyses. this new method enables us toderive redshift scales characterizing the fluctuations of the column densityratio eta. we find eta changing smoothly with redshift on typical scales ofdelta z ~ 0.01-0.03 corresponding to 8-24 h^-1 mpc comoving. the real lengthscales of variations of the column density ratio might be even larger, sincepart of the fluctuations may be caused by noise in the heii data and by effectsdue to the applied method. however, eta variations on small scales of a few mpcwith an amplitude of about +/- 1.5 dex cannot be ruled out completely. the datashows an apparent correlation between low eta regions and the presence of metalline absorbers, which corresponds to the more general correlation of low etaand strong hi absorption. thermal line broadening is suggested as a probableexplanation for this apparent correlation, since both fit methods wouldseverely underestimate eta for absorbers with log n(hi) &gt; 13 if the line widthwas dominated by thermal broadening. indeed, lines located close to the cut-offof the b(n) distribution yield lower column density ratios compared to thewhole sample, in particular if high density absorbers are considered. we arguethat the apparent correlation of eta with the strength of the hi absorption iscaused by insufficient consideration of thermal broadened lines by the standardanalysis. as unbiased value of the column density ratio, we find eta ~80 inagreement with previous estimates.

astro-ph;0610442	spectral shape of the uv ionizing background and heii absorption at  redshifts 1.8 &lt; z &lt; 2.9	the shape of the uv ionizing background is reconstructed from optically thinmetal absorption-line systems identified in spectra of he2347-4342, q1157+3143,and hs1700+6416 in the redshift interval 1.8 &lt; z &lt; 2.9. the systems areanalyzed by means of the monte carlo inversion method completed with thespectral shape recovering procedure. the uvb spectral shape fluctuates at 2.4 &lt;z &lt; 2.9 mostly due to radiative transfer processes in the clumpy igm. at z &lt;1.8, the igm becomes almost transparent both in the hi and heii lyman continuaand the variability of the spectral shape comes from diversity of spectralindices describing the qso/agn intrinsic radiation. at z &gt; 2.4, the recoveredspectral shapes show intensity depression between 3 and 4 ryd due to heiily-alpha absorption in the igm clouds (line blanketing) and continuous medium(true gunn-petersen effect). the mean heii ly-alpha opacity estimated from thedepth of this depression corresponds within 1-2sigma to the values directlymeasured from the hi/heii ly-alpha forest towards the quasars studied. theobserved scatter in eta = n(heii)/n(hi) and anti-correlation between n(hi) andeta can be explained by the combined action of variable spectral softness anddifferences in the mean gas density between the absorbing clouds. neither ofthe recovered spectral shapes show features which can be attributed to theputative input of radiation from soft sources like starburst galaxies.

astro-ph;0611620	the heii lyman alpha forest and the thermal state of the igm	recent analyses of the intergalactic uv background by means of the heii lymanalpha forest assume that heii and hi absorption features have the same linewidths. we omit this assumption to investigate possible effects of thermal linebroadening on the inferred heii/hi ratio eta and to explore the potential ofintergalactic heii observations to constrain the thermal state of the igm.deriving a simple relation between the column density and the temperature of anabsorber we develop a procedure to fit the parameters of a power lawtemperature-density relation and eta simultaneously. in an alternative approachthe temperature of an absorber, eta, and the redshift scale of eta variationsare estimated simultaneously. tests with artificial data show thatwell-constrained results can be obtained only if the signal-to-noise ratio inthe heii forest is s/n &gt; 20. thus, it is impossible to give an estimate of thetemperature-density relation with the heii data available at present (s/n ~5).however, we find that only 45% of the lines in our sample favor turbulent linewidths. furthermore, the inferred eta values are on average about 0.05 dexlarger if a thermal component is taken into account, and their distribution is46% narrower in comparison to a purely turbulent fit. therefore, variations ofeta on a 10% level may be related to the presence of thermal line broadening.the apparent correlation between the strength of the hi absorption and the etavalue, which has been found in former studies, essentially disappears ifthermal broadening is taken into account. in the redshift range 2.58 &lt; z &lt; 2.74towards the quasars he2347-4342 and hs1700+6416 we obtain eta ~ 100.

astro-ph;9604104	discovery of four white dwarfs with strong magnetic fields by the  hamburg/eso survey	four magnetic white dwarfs have been found in the course of the hamburg/esosurvey for bright qsos. the objects have been selected as qso candidate on thebasis of its blue continuum and the apparent absence of strong hydrogen orhelium lines. one star, he1211-1707, shows a rather fast spectral variability:both the strength and the position of the shallow absorption features change ona time scale of 20 minutes. we interpret this variability as being due to amagnetic field on the surface of a rotating white dwarf, having a relativelyuniform magnetic field on one hemisphere and a much larger spread of fieldstrengths visible during other phases of the rotational period. all attempts todetermine the magnetic field structure in detail with the help of syntheticspectra have failed so far because the star must have a rather complicatedfield geometry. however, both the optical and the uv spectra indicate that asignificant part of the surface is dominated by a magnetic field strength ofabout 80 mg. the spectrum of he 0127-3110 is also rotationally modulated. thisstar (approximate range of magnetic fields: 85-345 mg) as well as he 2201-2250(a spectroscopic twin of he 0127-3110) and he 0000-3430 (43-118 mg) could bereasonably well reproduced with the help of theoretical spectra calculatedassuming magnetic dipoles which are offset by 0.1 and 0.2 stellar radii alongthe magnetic axis. this result is in agreement with the assumption that apstars, also showing significant deviations from a centered dipole, are theprogenitors of magnetic white dwarfs.

astro-ph;9704149	the local luminosity function of qsos and seyfert 1 nuclei	we present the analysis of a new flux-limited sample of bright quasars andseyfert 1 galaxies in an effective area of 611 square deg, drawn from thehamburg/eso survey. we confirm recent claims that bright quasars have a highersurface density than previously thought. special care was taken to avoidmorphological and photometric biases against low-redshift quasars, and about 50% of the sample objects are at z &lt; 0.3, spanning a range of three decades inluminosity. while our derived space densities for low-luminosity seyfert 1nuclei are consistent with those found in the literature, we find that luminousqsos, m_b &lt; -24, are much more numerous in the local universe than previoussurveys indicated. the optical luminosity functions of seyfert 1 nuclei andqsos join smoothly, and if the host galaxy contributions are taken intoaccount, a single power-law of slope alpha = -2.2 describes the combined localluminosity function adequately, over the full range in absolute magnitude.comparing our data with published results at higher redshifts, we can rule outpure luminosity evolution as an acceptable parametrisation; the luminosityfunction of quasars changes shape and slope with z, in the sense that the mostluminous quasars show the weakest evolution.

astro-ph;9707173	patchy intergalactic heii absorption in he 2347-4342. - the possible  discovery of the epoch of he-reionization	we report on observations of redshifted heii 304 a absorption in the qso he2347-4342 (z=2.885, v=16.1) with the ghrs on board hst (fwhm=0.7 a). at theexpected position of heii 304 a absorption, he 2347-4342 is the most uv-brighthigh redshift qso discovered so far. we show that the heii opacity as afunction of redshift is patchy showing spectral regions with low heii opacity(voids) and regions with high heii opacity (troughs) and no detectable flux.combination with high-resolution optical spectra of the ly_alpha forest usingcaspec at the eso 3.6m telescope shows that the voids can be explained eitherexclusively by ly_alpha forest cloud absorption with a moderate n(heii)/n(hi)ratio of 100 and turbulent line broadening or by a combination of ly_alphaforest with n(heii)/n(hi)=45 and thermal broadening plus a diffuse medium withtau_gp_heii=0.3. thus a strict upper limit to a diffuse medium is omega_diff&lt;=0.02 h_50^(-1.5) at z=2.8. in the troughs an additional continuous heii 304 aopacity tau &gt; 2.8 is required. in case of photoionization, the troughs wouldrequire a diffuse component with a density close to omega = 0.059 h_50^(-1.5),i.e. all baryons in the universe, which is inconsistent with the observedabsence of such a component in the voids. a tentative interpretation is that weobserve the epoch of partial heii reionization of the universe with patches notyet reionized. in that case a diffuse component with omega_diff &gt;= 1.3 10^(-4)h_50^(-1) would be sufficient to explain the ``trough'' opacity.

astro-ph;9807135	four magnetic db white dwarfs discovered by the hamburg/eso survey	we report on seven peculiar faint blue stars found in the course of thehamburg/eso survey (hes) which appear to be magnetic white dwarfs (wds) withnon-hydrogen spectra. we show in particular that four of them (he 0338-3853, he0107-0158, he 0026-2150, and he 0003-5701) have he i lines split by magneticfields of roughly 20mg, since the \pi components of he i 5876 angstroem and hei 4929 angstroem can be identified unambiguously in their spectra, and the$\sigma^+$, $\sigma^-$ components can be identified in the spectra of two ofthese stars (he 0338-3853 and he 0003-5701). besides gd 229, these are thefirst magnetic db white dwarfs discovered so far.  in addition, three further wds with broad, unidentifiable features have beenfound: he 1043-0502, he 0236-2656, and he 0330-0002. we argue that in all threeof these stars h i can not be responsible for the broad features, and he i mostprobably not for the features in he 0236-2656 and he 0330-0002, while it stillremains possible that the broad features of he 1043-0502 are due to he i.
