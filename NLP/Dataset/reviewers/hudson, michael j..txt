0902.3388	the radio luminosity function and galaxy evolution in the coma cluster	we investigate the radio luminosity function (rlf) and radio sourcepopulation for two fields within the coma cluster of galaxies. our vla datareach down to log(l) = 20.23 w/hz for coma, and we associate 249 sources withoptical counterparts from the sdss. comprehensive optical spectroscopyidentifies 38 of these as members of the coma cluster, evenly split between agnand star-forming galaxies (sfg). the radio-detected sfg are the dominantpopulation only for ~21 &lt; log(l) &lt; ~22 w/hz, an interesting result given thatstar formation dominates field rlfs for log(l) &lt; ~23. the majority of theradio-detected sfgs have characteristics of starbursts, including high specificstar formation rates and optical spectra with strong emission lines. inconjunction with prior studies on post-starburst galaxies within the comacluster, this is consistent with a picture in which late-type galaxies enteringcoma undergo a starburst prior to a rapid cessation of star formation.optically bright elliptical galaxies (mr &lt;= -20.5) make the largestcontribution to the radio luminosity function at both the high (log(l) &gt;~ 22.48w/hz) and low (log(l) &lt;~ 21 w/hz) ends. through a stacking analysis of theseoptically-bright ellipticals we find that they continue to harbor radio sourcesdown to log(l) = 19.48. however, contrary to published results for the virgocluster we find no evidence for the existence of a population of opticallyfaint (mr ~ -14) dwarf ellipticals hosting strong radio agn.

0903.2473	abundance ratios in red-sequence galaxies over a wide mass range: the  "x-planes" for magnesium, calcium, carbon and nitrogen	we analyse the abundance ratios of the light elements mg, ca, c and n,relative to fe, for 147 red-sequence galaxies in the coma cluster and theshapley supercluster. the sample covers a six-magnitude range in luminosity,from giant ellipticals to dwarfs at m^*+4. we exploit the wide mass range toinvestigate systematic trends in the abundance ratios mg/fe, ca/fe, c/fe andn/fe. we find that each of these ratios can be well modelled usingtwo-parameter relations of the form [x/fe] = a0 + a1 log sigma + a2 [fe/h],where sigma is the velocity dispersion. analysing these "x-planes" reveals newstructure in the abundance patterns, beyond the traditional one-parameter (e.g.mg/fe-sigma) correlations. the x-planes for the alpha elements, mg and ca,indicate a positive correlation with velocity dispersion, and simultaneously ananti-correlation with fe/h (i.e. a1&gt;0 and a2&lt;0). taking both effects intoaccount dramatically reduces the scatter, compared to the traditionalx/fe-sigma relations. for c and n, a similar correlation with velocitydispersion is recovered, but there is no additional dependence on fe/h (i.e.a1&gt;0 and a2~0). the explicit dependence of x/fe on two parameters is evidencethat at least two physical processes are at work in setting the abundancepatterns. the fe/h dependence of mg/fe and ca/fe, at fixed sigma, may resultfrom different durations of star formation, from galaxy to galaxy. the absenceof corresponding fe/h dependence for c and n is consistent with these elementsbeing generated in lower-mass stars. the increase with sigma, at fixed fe/h, issimilar for elements mg, c and n, and slightly shallower for ca. this patternof trends cannot be explained solely by a systematic variation ofstar-formation time-scale with sigma.

0906.3288	the star formation histories of red-sequence galaxies, mass-to-light  ratios and the fundamental plane	this paper addresses the challenge of understanding the typical starformation histories of red sequence galaxies, using linestrength indices andmass-to-light ratios as complementary constraints on their stellar agedistribution. we construct simple parametric models of the star formationhistory that bracket a range of scenarios, and fit these models to thelinestrength indices of low-redshift cluster red-sequence galaxies. for giantgalaxies, we confirm the downsizing trend. we find, however, that this trendflattens or reverses at sigma &lt; 70 km/s. we then compare predicted stellarmass-to-light ratios with dynamical mass-to-light ratios derived from thefundamental plane (fp), or by the sauron group. for galaxies with sigma ~ 70km/s, models with a "frosting" of young stars and models with exponential starformation histories have stellar mass-to-light ratios that are larger thanobserved dynamical mass-to-light ratios by factors of 1.7 and 1.4,respectively, and so are rejected. the ssp model is consistent with the fp, andrequires a modest amount of dark matter (20-30%) to account for the differencebetween stellar and dynamical mass-to-light ratios. a model in which starformation was "quenched" at intermediate ages is also consistent with theobservations. we find that the contribution of stellar populations to the"tilt" of the fp is highly dependent on the assumed star-formation history: forthe ssp model, the tilt of the fp is driven primarily by stellar-populationeffects. for a quenched model, two-thirds of the tilt is due to stellarpopulations and only one third is due to dark matter or non-homology.

0908.2990	ages and metallicities for quiescent galaxies in the shapley  supercluster: driving parameters of the stellar populations	we use high signal-to-noise spectroscopy for a sample of 232 quiescentgalaxies in the shapley supercluster, to investigate how their stellarpopulations depend on velocity dispersion, luminosity and stellar mass. thesample spans a large range in velocity dispersion (sigma from 30-300 km/s) andin luminosity (m_r from -18.7 to -23.2). estimates of age, total metallicity(z/h) and alpha-element abundance ratio (a/fe) were derived fromabsorption-line analysis, using single-burst models. age, z/h and a/fe are allcorrelated positively with velocity dispersion, but we also find significantresidual trends with luminosity: at given sigma, the brighter galaxies areyounger, less alpha-enriched, and have higher z/h. at face value, these resultsmight suggest that the stellar populations depend on stellar mass as well as onvelocity dispersion. however, we show that the observed trends can bereproduced by models in which the stellar populations depend systematicallyonly on sigma, and are independent of stellar mass mstel. for age, the observedluminosity correlation arises because young galaxies are brighter, at fixedmstel. for metallicity, the observed luminosity dependence arises becausemetal-rich galaxies, at fixed mass, tend also to be younger, and hencebrighter. we find a good match to the observed luminosity correlations with age~ sigma^0.40, z/h ~ sigma^0.35, a/fe ~ sigma^0.20, where the slopes are closeto those found when fitting traditional scaling relations. we conclude that thestar formation and enrichment histories of galaxies are determined primarily bythe depth of their gravitational potential wells. the observed residualcorrelations with luminosity do not imply a corresponding dependence on stellarmass.

0707.1695	a deep aaomega survey of low-luminosity galaxies in the shapley  supercluster: stellar population trends	we present new optical spectroscopy for 342 r&lt;18 galaxies in the shapleysupercluster obtained with the aaomega facility at the anglo-australiantelescope. we describe the observations and measurements of central velocitydispersion, emission line equivalent widths and absorption line indices. thedistinguishing characteristic of the survey is its coverage of a very widebaseline in velocity dispersion (30-300 km/s), while achieving highsignal-to-noise ratio throughout (median 60 per ang). significant emission ath-alpha was detected in ~20 per cent of red-sequence shapley members. usingline-ratio diagnostics, we find that the emission is liner-like at highluminosity, but driven by star-formation in low-luminosity galaxies. we uselick indices to characterise the absorption spectra. we define a subset ofgalaxies with very low emission contamination, and fit the index-sigmarelations for this subset. comparing the index-sigma slopes against predictionsfrom single-burst stellar population models, we infer the scaling relations ofage, total metallicity, [z/h], and alpha-element abundance ratio, [a/fe]. toreproduce the observed index-sigma slopes, all three parameters must increasewith increasing velocity dispersion. specifically, we recover: age \proptosigma^0.52+/-0.10, z/h \propto sigma^0.34+/-0.07, and a/fe \proptosigma^0.23+/-0.06 (error reflects systematic effects), derived over a decadebaseline in velocity dispersion. the recovered age-sigma relation is shown tobe consistent with the observed evolution in the giant-to-dwarf galaxy ratio inclusters at redshifts z=0.4-0.8. a companion paper will analyse thedistribution of age, [z/h] and [a/fe] for individual galaxies.

0707.1698	the masses and shapes of dark matter halos from galaxy-galaxy lensing in  the cfhtls	we present the first galaxy-galaxy weak lensing results using early data fromthe canada-france-hawaii telescope legacy survey (cfhtls). these results arebased on ~22 sq. deg. of i' data. from this data, we estimate the averagevelocity dispersion for an l* galaxy at a redshift of 0.3 to be 137 +- 11 km/s,with a virial mass, m_{200}, of 1.1 +- 0.2 \times 10^{12} h^{-1} msun and arest frame r-band mass-to-light ratio of 173 +- 34 h msun/lsun. we alsoinvestigate various possible sources of systematic error in detail.additionally, we separate our lens sample into two sub-samples, divided byapparent magnitude, thus average redshift. from this early data we do notdetect significant evolution in galaxy dark matter halo mass-to-light ratiosfrom a redshift of 0.45 to 0.27. finally, we test for non-spherical galaxy darkmatter halos. our results favor a dark matter halo with an ellipticity of ~0.3at the 2-sigma level when averaged over all galaxies. if the sample offoreground lens galaxies is selected to favor ellipticals, the mean haloellipticity and significance of this result increase.

0911.5516	cosmic flows on 100 mpc/h scales: standardized minimum variance bulk  flow, shear and octupole moments	the low order moments, such as the bulk flow and shear, of the large scalepeculiar velocity field are sensitive probes of the matter density fluctuationson very large scales. in practice, however, peculiar velocity surveys areusually sparse and noisy, which can lead to the aliasing of small scale powerinto what is meant to be a probe of the largest scales. previously, wedeveloped an optimal ``minimum variance'' (mv) weighting scheme, designed toovercome this problem by minimizing the difference between the measured bulkflow (bf) and that which would be measured by an ideal survey. here we extendthis mv analysis to include the shear and octupole moments, which are designedto have almost no correlations between them so that they are virtuallyorthogonal. we apply this mv analysis to a compilation of all major peculiarvelocity surveys, consisting of 4536 measurements. our estimate of the bf onscales of ~ 100 mpc/h has a magnitude of |v|= 416 +/- 78 km/s towards galacticl = 282 degree +/- 11 degree and b = 6 degree +/- 6 degree. this result is indisagreement with lcdm with wmap5 cosmological parameters at a high confidencelevel, but is in good agreement with our previous mv result without anorthogonality constraint, showing that the shear and octupole moments did notcontaminate the previous bf measurement. the shear and octupole moments areconsistent with wmap5 power spectrum, although the measurement noise is largerfor these moments than for the bf. the relatively low shear moments suggestthat the sources responsible for the bf are at large distances.

0704.1654	the peculiar velocities of local type ia supernovae and their impact on  cosmology	we quantify the effect of supernova type ia peculiar velocities on thederivation of cosmological parameters. the published distant and local ia sneused for the supernova legacy survey first-year cosmology report form thesample for this study. while previous work has assumed that the local sne areat rest in the cmb frame (the no flow assumption), we test this assumption byapplying peculiar velocity corrections to the local sne using three differentflow models. the models are based on the iras pscz galaxy redshift survey, havevarying beta = omega_m^0.6/b, and reproduce the local group motion in the cmbframe. these datasets are then fit for w, omega_m, and omega_lambda usingflatness or lambdacdm and a bao prior. the chi^2 statistic is used to examinethe effect of the velocity corrections on the quality of the fits. the mostfavored model is the beta=0.5 model, which produces a fit significantly betterthan the no flow assumption, consistent with previous peculiar velocitystudies. by comparing the no flow assumption with the favored models we derivethe largest potential systematic error in w caused by ignoring peculiarvelocities to be delta w = +0.04. for omega_lambda, the potential error isdelta omega_lambda = -0.04 and for omega_m, the potential error is deltaomega_m &lt; +0.01. the favored flow model (beta=0.5) produces the followingcosmological parameters: w = -1.08 (+0.09,-0.08), omega_m = 0.27 (+0.02,-0.02)assuming a flat cosmology, and omega_lambda = 0.80 (+0.08,-0.07) and omega_m =0.27 (+0.02,-0.02) for a w = -1 (lambdacdm) cosmology.

1006.4867	ultraviolet tails and trails in cluster galaxies: a sample of candidate  gaseous stripping events in coma	we have used new deep observations of the coma cluster from galex to identify13 star-forming galaxies with asymmetric morphologies in the ultraviolet. aidedby optical broad-band and h-alpha imaging, we interpret the asymmetric featuresas being due to star formation within gas stripped from the galaxies byinteraction with the cluster environment. the selected objects display a rangeof structures from broad fan-shaped systems of filaments and knots(`jellyfish') to narrower and smoother tails extending up to 100 kpc in length.some of the features have been discussed previously in the literature, whileothers are newly identified here. as an ensemble, the candidate strippingevents are located closer to the cluster centre than other star-forminggalaxies; their radial distribution is similar to that of all cluster members,dominated by passive galaxies. the fraction of blue galaxies which areundergoing stripping falls from 40% in the central 500 kpc, to less than 5%beyond 1 mpc. we find that tails pointing away from (i.e. galaxies movingtowards) the cluster centre are strongly favoured (11/13 cases). from the smallnumber of `outgoing' galaxies with stripping signatures we conclude that thestripping events occur primarily on first passage towards the cluster centre,and are short-lived compared to the cluster crossing time. using infalltrajectories from simulations, the observed fraction of blue galaxiesundergoing stripping can be reproduced if the events are triggered at athreshold radius of ~1 mpc and detectable for ~500 myr. hst images areavailable for two galaxies from our sample and reveal compact blue knotscoincident with uv and h-alpha emission, apparently forming stars within thestripped material. our results confirm that stripping of gas from infallinggalaxies, and associated star formation in the stripped material, is awidespread phenomenon in rich clusters.

1007.1002	colours of bulges and discs within galaxy clusters and the signature of  disc fading on infall	the origins of the bulge and disc components of galaxies are of primaryimportance to understanding galaxy formation. here bulge-disc decomposition isperformed simultaneously in b- and r-bands for 922 bright galaxies in 8 nearby(z &lt; 0.06) clusters with deep redshift coverage using photometry from the noaofundamental plane survey. the total galaxy colours follow a universalcolour-magnitude relation (cmr). the discs of l_* galaxies are 0.24 magnitudesbluer in $b-r$ than bulges. bulges have a significant cmr slope while the cmrslope of discs is flat. thus the slope of the cmr of the total light is drivenprimarily (60%) by the bulge-cmr, and to a lesser extent (40%) by the change inthe bulge-to-total ratio as a function of magnitude. the colours of the bulgeand disc components do not depend on the bulge-to-total ratio, for galaxieswith bulge-to-total ratios greater than 0.2. while the colours of the bulgecomponents do not depend significantly on environment, the median colours ofdiscs vary significantly, with discs in the cluster centre redder by 0.10magnitudes than those at the virial radius. thus while star formation in bulgesappears to be regulated primarily by mass-dependent, and hence presumablyinternal, processes, that of discs is affected by the cluster environment.

1108.3836	environmental quenching and hierarchical cluster assembly: evidence from  spectroscopic ages of red-sequence galaxies in coma	we explore the variation in stellar population ages for coma cluster galaxiesas a function of projected cluster-centric distance, using a sample of 362red-sequence galaxies with high signal-to-noise spectroscopy. the sample spansa wide range in luminosity (0.02-4 l*) and extends from the cluster core tonear the virial radius. we find a clear distinction in the observed trends ofthe giant and dwarf galaxies. the ages of red-sequence giants are primarilydetermined by galaxy mass, with only weak modulation by environment, in thesense that galaxies at larger cluster-centric distance are slightly younger.for red-sequence dwarfs (with mass &lt;10^10 msun), the roles of mass andenvironment as predictors of age are reversed: there is little dependence onmass, but strong trends with projected cluster-centric radius are observed. theaverage age of dwarfs at the 2.5 mpc limit of our sample is approximately halfthat of dwarfs near the cluster centre. the gradient in dwarf galaxy ages is aglobal cluster-centric trend, and is not driven by the ongoing merger of thengc 4839 group to the south west of coma. we interpret these results usingenvironmental histories extracted from the millennium simulation for members ofmassive clusters. hierarchical cluster assembly naturally leads to trends inthe accretion times of galaxies as a function of projected cluster-centricradius. on average, simulated galaxies now located in cluster cores joinedhalos above any given mass threshold earlier than those now located in theoutskirts of clusters. we test environmental quenching models, in which starformation is halted in galaxies when they enter halos of a given mass, orbecome satellite galaxies. the models broadly reproduce the gradients observedin coma, but for dwarf galaxies the efficiency of environmental quenching mustbe very high to match the strong trends observed.

1111.3338	power spectrum estimation from peculiar velocity catalogues	the peculiar velocities of galaxies are an inherently valuable cosmologicalprobe, providing an unbiased estimate of the distribution of matter on scalesmuch larger than the depth of the survey. much research interest has beenmotivated by the high dipole moment of our local peculiar velocity field, whichsuggests a large scale excess in the matter power spectrum, and can appear tobe in some tension with the lcdm model. we use a composite catalogue of 4,537peculiar velocity measurements with a characteristic depth of 33 h-1 mpc toestimate the matter power spectrum. we compare the constraints with thismethod, directly studying the full peculiar velocity catalogue, to results frommacaulay et al. (2011), studying minimum variance moments of the velocityfield, as calculated by watkins, feldman &amp; hudson (2009) and feldman, watkins &amp;hudson (2010). we find good agreement with the lcdm model on scales of k &gt; 0.01h mpc-1. we find an excess of power on scales of k &lt; 0.01 h mpc-1, althoughwith a 1 sigma uncertainty which includes the lcdm model. we find that theuncertainty in the excess at these scales is larger than an alternative resultstudying only moments of the velocity field, which is due to the minimumvariance weights used to calculate the moments. at small scales, we are able toclearly discriminate between linear and nonlinear clustering in simulatedpeculiar velocity catalogues, and find some evidence (although less clear) forlinear clustering in the real peculiar velocity data.

0704.3242	line emission in the brightest cluster galaxies of the noao fundamental  plane and sloan digital sky surveys	we examine the optical emission line properties of brightest cluster galaxies(bcgs) selected from two large, homogeneous datasets. the first is the x-rayselected national optical astronomy observatory fundamental plane survey(nfps), and the second is the c4 catalogue of optically selected clusters builtfrom the sloan digital sky survey data release ~3 (sdss dr3). our goal is tobetter understand the optical line emission in bcgs with respect to propertiesof the galaxy and the host cluster. throughout the analysis we compare the lineemission of the bcgs to that of a control sample made of the other brightgalaxies near the cluster centre. overall, both the nfps and sdss show a modestfraction of bcgs with emission lines (~15%). no trend in the fraction ofemitting bcgs as a function of galaxy mass or cluster velocity dispersion isfound. however we find that, for those bcgs found in cooling flow clusters,71^{+9}_{-14}% have optical emission. furthermore, if we consider only bcgswithin 50kpc of the x-ray centre of a cooling flow cluster, the emission-linefraction rises further to 100^{+0}_{-15}%. excluding the cooling flow clusters,only ~10% of bcgs are line emitting, comparable to the control sample ofgalaxies. we show that the physical origin of the emission line activityvaries: in some cases it has liner-like line ratios, whereas in others it is acomposite of star-formation and liner-like activity. we conclude that thepresence of emission lines in bcgs is directly related to the cooling of x-raygas at the cluster centre.

1211.3411	quenching star formation in cluster galaxies	in order to understand the processes that quench star formation within richclusters, we construct a library of subhalo orbits drawn from $\lambda$cdmcosmological n-body simulations of four rich clusters. the orbits are combinedwith models of star formation followed by quenching in the cluster environment.these are compared with observed bulge and disc colours and stellar absorptionlinestrength indices of satellite galaxies. models in which the bulge stellarpopulations depend only on the galaxy subhalo mass while the disc quenchingdepends on the cluster environment are acceptable fits to the data. anexponential disc quenching timescale of 3 - 3.5 gyr is preferred. models withshort ($\lesssim 1$ gyr) quenching timescales yield cluster-centric gradientsin disc colours and balmer line indices that are too steep compared toobservations. we also examine models in which there is quenching in lower massgroups prior to cluster infall ("pre-processing"), finding that such models area better fit to the data than models without pre-processing and require similarquenching times. the data slightly prefer models where quenching occurs onlyfor galaxies falling within about 0.5 $r_{200}$. finally, we have examinedmodels with short quenching timescales of 1 gyr, but a long delay time of 3 gyrprior to quenching. all models with short quenching timescales, even such"delayed-then-rapid" quenching models, produce excessively red galaxies nearthe cluster core and are strongly disfavoured by the data. these results implythat the environments of rich clusters must impact star formation rates ofinfalling galaxies on relatively long timescales -- several times longer than atypical halo spends within the virial radius of a cluster. this scenariofavours gentler quenching mechanisms such as slow "strangulation" over morerapid ram-pressure stripping.

1301.6757	disentangling satellite galaxy populations using orbit tracking in  simulations	physical processes regulating star formation in satellite galaxies representan area of ongoing research, but the projected nature of observed coordinatesmakes separating different populations of satellites (with different processesat work) difficult. the orbital history of a satellite galaxy leads to itspresent-day phase space coordinates; we can also work backwards and use thesecoordinates to statistically infer information about the orbital history. weuse merger trees from the multidark run 1 n-body simulation to compile acatalog of the orbits of satellite haloes in cluster environments. weparameterize the orbital history by the time since crossing within 2.5 rvir ofthe cluster centre and use our catalog to estimate the probability density overa range of this parameter given a set of present-day projected (i.e.observable) phase space coordinates. we show that different populations ofsatellite haloes, e.g. infalling, backsplash and virialized, occupy distinctregions of phase space, and semi-distinct regions of projected phase space.this will allow us to probabilistically determine the time since infall of alarge sample of observed satellite galaxies, and ultimately to study the effectof orbital history on star formation history (the topic of a future paper). wetest the accuracy of our method and find that we can reliably recover this timewithin +/-2.58 gyr in 68 per cent of cases by using all available phase spacecoordinate information, compared to +/-2.64 gyr using only position coordinatesand +/-3.10 gyr guessing 'blindly', i.e. using no coordinate information, butwith knowledge of the overall distribution of infall times. in some regions ofphase space, the accuracy of the infall time estimate improves to +/-1.85 gyr.although we focus on time since infall, our method is easily generalizable toother orbital parameters (e.g. pericentric distance and time).

1301.7421	cfhtlens: the environmental dependence of galaxy halo masses from weak  lensing	we use weak gravitational lensing to analyse the dark matter halos aroundsatellite galaxies in galaxy groups in the cfhtlens dataset. this dataset isderived from the cfhtls-wide survey, and encompasses 154 sq. deg ofhigh-quality shape data. using the photometric redshifts, we divide the sampleof lens galaxies with stellar masses in the range 10^9 msun to 10^10.5 msuninto those likely to lie in high-density environments (hde) and those likely tolie in low-density environments (lde). through comparison with galaxycatalogues extracted from the millennium simulation, we show that the sample ofhde galaxies should primarily (~61%) consist of satellite galaxies in groups,while the sample of lde galaxies should consist of mostly (~87%) non-satellite(field and central) galaxies. comparing the lensing signals around samples ofhde and lde galaxies matched in stellar mass, the lensing signal around hdegalaxies clearly shows a positive contribution from their host groups on theirlensing signals at radii of ~500--1000 kpc, the typical separation betweensatellites and group centres. more importantly, the subhalos of hde galaxiesare less massive than those around lde galaxies by a factor 0.65 +/- 0.12,significant at the 2.9 sigma level. a natural explanation is that the halos ofsatellite galaxies are stripped through tidal effects in the group environment.our results are consistent with a typical tidal truncation radius of ~40 kpc.

1303.1806	cfhtlens: mapping the large scale structure with gravitational lensing	we present a quantitative analysis of the largest contiguous maps ofprojected mass density obtained from gravitational lensing shear. we use datafrom the 154 deg2 covered by the canada-france-hawaii telescope lensing survey.our study is the first attempt to quantitatively characterize the scientificvalue of lensing maps, which could serve in the future as a complementaryapproach to the study of the dark universe with gravitational lensing. we showthat mass maps contain unique cosmological information beyond that oftraditional two-points statistical analysis techniques. using a series ofnumerical simulations, we first show how, reproducing the cfhtlens observingconditions, gravitational lensing inversion provides a reliable estimate of theprojected matter distribution of large scale structure. we validate ouranalysis by quantifying the robustness of the maps with various statisticalestimators. we then apply the same process to the cfhtlens data. we find thatthe 2-points correlation function of the projected mass is consistent with thecosmological analysis performed on the shear correlation function discussed inthe cfhtlens companion papers. the maps also lead to a significant measurementof the third order moment of the projected mass, which is in agreement withanalytic predictions, and to a marginal detection of the fourth order moment.tests for residual systematics are found to be consistent with zero for thestatistical estimators we used. a new approach for the comparison of thereconstructed mass map to that predicted from the galaxy distribution revealsthe existence of giant voids in the dark matter maps as large as 3 degrees onthe sky. our analysis shows that lensing mass maps can be used for newtechniques such as peak statistics and the morphological analysis of theprojected dark matter distribution.

1303.1808	cfhtlens tomographic weak lensing cosmological parameter constraints:  mitigating the impact of intrinsic galaxy alignments	we present a finely-binned tomographic weak lensing analysis of thecanada-france-hawaii telescope lensing survey, cfhtlens, mitigatingcontamination to the signal from the presence of intrinsic galaxy alignmentsvia the simultaneous fit of a cosmological model and an intrinsic alignmentmodel. cfhtlens spans 154 square degrees in five optical bands, with accurateshear and photometric redshifts for a galaxy sample with a median redshift ofzm =0.70. we estimate the 21 sets of cosmic shear correlation functionsassociated with six redshift bins, each spanning the angular range of1.5&lt;theta&lt;35 arcmin. we combine this cfhtlens data with auxiliary cosmologicalprobes: the cosmic microwave background with data from wmap7, baryon acousticoscillations with data from boss, and a prior on the hubble constant from thehst distance ladder. this leads to constraints on the normalisation of thematter power spectrum sigma_8 = 0.799 +/- 0.015 and the matter densityparameter omega_m = 0.271 +/- 0.010 for a flat lambda cdm cosmology. for a flatwcdm cosmology we constrain the dark energy equation of state parameter w =-1.02 +/- 0.09. we also provide constraints for curved lambda cdm and wcdmcosmologies. we find the intrinsic alignment contamination to be galaxy-typedependent with a significant intrinsic alignment signal found for early-typegalaxies, in contrast to the late-type galaxy sample for which the intrinsicalignment signal is found to be consistent with zero.

1304.4265	cfhtlens: the relation between galaxy dark matter haloes and baryons  from weak gravitational lensing	we present a study of the relation between dark matter halo mass and thebaryonic content of host galaxies, quantified via luminosity and stellar mass.our investigation uses 154 deg2 of canada-france-hawaii telescope lensingsurvey (cfhtlens) lensing and photometric data, obtained from the cfht legacysurvey. we employ a galaxy-galaxy lensing halo model which allows us toconstrain the halo mass and the satellite fraction. our analysis is limited tolenses at redshifts between 0.2 and 0.4. we express the relationship betweenhalo mass and baryonic observable as a power law. for the luminosity-halo massrelation we find a slope of 1.32+/-0.06 and a normalisation of1.19+0.06-0.07x10^13 h70^-1 msun for red galaxies, while for blue galaxies thebest-fit slope is 1.09+0.20-0.13 and the normalisation is 0.18+0.04-0.05x10^13h70^-1 msun. similarly, we find a best-fit slope of 1.36+0.06-0.07 and anormalisation of 1.43+0.11-0.08x10^13 h70^-1 msun for the stellar mass-halomass relation of red galaxies, while for blue galaxies the corresponding valuesare 0.98+0.08-0.07 and 0.84+0.20-0.16x10^13 h70^-1 msun. for red lenses, thefraction which are satellites tends to decrease with luminosity and stellarmass, with the sample being nearly all satellites for a stellar mass of 2x10^9h70^-2 msun. the satellite fractions are generally close to zero for bluelenses, irrespective of luminosity or stellar mass. this, together with theshallower relation between halo mass and baryonic tracer, is a directconfirmation from galaxy-galaxy lensing that blue galaxies reside in lessclustered environments than red galaxies. we also find that the halo model,while matching the lensing signal around red lenses well, is prone toover-predicting the large-scale signal for faint and less massive blue lenses.this could be a further indication that these galaxies tend to be more isolatedthan assumed.

1310.6784	cfhtlens: co-evolution of galaxies and their dark matter haloes	galaxy-galaxy weak lensing is a direct probe of the mean matter distributionaround galaxies. the depth and sky coverage of the cfht legacy survey yieldstatistically significant galaxy halo mass measurements over a much wider rangeof stellar masses ($10^{8.75}$ to $10^{11.3} m_{\odot}$) and redshifts ($0.2 &lt;z &lt; 0.8$) than previous weak lensing studies. at redshift $z \sim 0.5$, thestellar-to-halo mass ratio (shmr) reaches a maximum of $4.0\pm0.2$ percent as afunction of halo mass at $\sim 10^{12.25} m_{\odot}$. we find, for the firsttime from weak lensing alone, evidence for significant evolution in the shmr:the peak ratio falls as a function of cosmic time from $4.5 \pm 0.3$ percent at$z \sim 0.7$ to $3.4 \pm 0.2$ percent at $z \sim 0.3$, and shifts to lowerstellar mass haloes. these evolutionary trends are dominated by red galaxies,and are consistent with a model in which the stellar mass above which starformation is quenched "downsizes" with cosmic time. in contrast, the shmr ofblue, star-forming galaxies is well-fit by a power law that does not evolvewith time. this suggests that blue galaxies form stars at a rate that isbalanced with their dark matter accretion in such a way that they evolve alongthe shmr locus. the redshift dependence of the shmr can be used to constrainthe evolution of the galaxy population over cosmic time.

1402.4135	dissecting the red sequence: the bulge and disc colours of early-type  galaxies in the coma cluster	we explore the internal structure of red sequence galaxies in the comacluster across a wide range of luminosities ($-17&gt;m_g&gt;-22$) and cluster-centricradii ($0&lt;r_{\rm{cluster}}&lt;1.3 r_{200}$). we present the 2d bulge-discdecomposition of galaxies in deep canada-france-hawaii telescope $u,g,i$imaging using galfit. rigorous filtering is applied to identify an analysissample of 200 galaxies which are well described by an `archetypal' s0 structure(central bulge + outer disc). we consider internal bulge and/or disc colourgradients by allowing component sizes to vary between bands. gradients arerequired for $30\%$ of analysis sample galaxies. bulge half-light radii arefound to be uncorrelated with galaxy luminosity ($r_e \sim 1$ kpc, $n\sim2$)for all but the brightest galaxies ($m_g&lt;-20.5$). the s0 discs are brighter (atfixed size, or smaller at fixed luminosity) than those of star-forming spirals.a similar colour-magnitude relation is found for both bulges and discs. theglobal red sequence for s0s in coma hence results from a combination of bothcomponent trends. we measure an average bulge $-$ disc colour difference of$0.09\pm0.01$ mag in $g-i$, and $0.16\pm0.01$ mag in $u-g$. using simplestellar population models, bulges are either $\sim2$-$3\times$ older, or$\sim2\times$ more metal-rich than discs. the trend towards bluer global s0colours observed further from coma's core is driven by a significantcorrelation in disc colour with cluster-centric radius. an equivalent trend isdetected in bulge colours at a marginal significance level. our resultstherefore favour environment-mediated mechanisms of disc fading as the dominantfactor in s0 formation.

1402.7077	the phase space and stellar populations of cluster galaxies at z ~ 1:  simultaneous constraints on the location and timescale of satellite quenching	we investigate the velocity vs. position phase space of z ~ 1 clustergalaxies using a set of 424 spectroscopic redshifts in 9 clusters drawn fromthe gclass survey. dividing the galaxy population into three categories:quiescent, star-forming, and poststarburst, we find that these populations havedistinct distributions in phase space. most striking are the poststarburstgalaxies, which are commonly found at small clustercentric radii with highclustercentric velocities, and appear to trace a coherent ``ring" in phasespace. using several zoom simulations of clusters we show that the coherentdistribution of the poststarbursts can be reasonably well-reproduced using asimple quenching scenario. specifically, the phase space is best reproduced ifsatellite quenching occurs on a rapid timescale (0.1 &lt; tau_{q} &lt; 0.5 gyr) aftergalaxies make their first passage of r ~ 0.5r_{200}, a process that takes atotal time of ~ 1 gyr after first infall. we compare this quenching timescaleto the timescale implied by the stellar populations of the poststarburstgalaxies and find that the poststarburst spectra are well-fit by a rapidquenching (tau_{q} = 0.4^{+0.3}_{-0.4} gyr) of a typical star-forming galaxy.the similarity between the quenching timescales derived from these independentindicators is a strong consistency check of the quenching model. given that themodel implies satellite quenching is rapid, and occurs well within r_{200},this would suggest that ram-pressure stripping of either the hot or cold gascomponent of galaxies are the most plausible candidates for the physicalmechanism. the high cold gas consumption rates at z ~ 1 make it difficult todetermine if hot or cold gas stripping is dominant; however, measurements ofthe redshift evolution of the satellite quenching timescale and location may becapable of distinguishing between the two.

1404.1920	dark matter halos in galaxies and globular cluster populations	we combine a new, comprehensive database for globular cluster populations inall types of galaxies with a new calibration of galaxy halo masses basedentirely on weak lensing. correlating these two sets of data, we find that themass ratio $\eta \equiv m_{gcs}/m_{h}$ (total mass in globular clusters,divided by halo mass) is essentially constant at $\langle \eta \rangle \sim 4\times 10^{-5}$, strongly confirming earlier suggestions in the literature.globular clusters are the only known stellar population that formed inessentially direct proportion to host galaxy halo mass. the intrinsic scatterin $\eta$ appears to be at most 0.2 dex; we argue that some of this scatter isdue to differing degrees of tidal stripping of the globular cluster systemsbetween central and satellite galaxies. we suggest that this correlation can beunderstood if most globular clusters form at very early stages in galaxyevolution, largely avoiding the feedback processes that inhibited the bulk offield-star formation in their host galaxies. the actual mean value of $\eta$also suggests that about $1/4$ of the \emph{initial} gas mass present inprotogalaxies collected into gmcs large enough to form massive, dense starclusters. finally, our calibration of $\langle \eta \rangle$ indicates that thehalo masses of the milky way and m31 are $(1.2\pm0.5)\times 10^{12} m_{\odot}$and $(3.9\pm1.8)\times 10^{12} m_{\odot}$ respectively.

1404.5469	cfhtlens: cosmological constraints from a combination of cosmic shear  two-point and three-point correlations	higher-order, non-gaussian aspects of the large-scale structure carryvaluable information on structure formation and cosmology, which iscomplementary to second-order statistics. in this work we measure second- andthird-order weak-lensing aperture-mass moments from cfhtlens and combine thosewith cmb anisotropy probes. the third moment is measured with a significance of$2\sigma$. the combined constraint on $\sigma_8 = \sigma_8 (\omega_{\rmm}/0.27)^\alpha$ is improved by 10%, in comparison to the second-order only,and the allowed ranges for $\omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_8$ are substantiallyreduced. including general triangles of the lensing bispectrum yields tighterconstraints compared to probing mainly equilateral triangles. second- andthird-order cfhtlens lensing measurements improve planck cmb constraints on$\omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_8$ by 26% for flat $\lambda$cdm. for a model withfree curvature, the joint cfhtlens-planck result is $\omega_{\rm m} = 0.28 \pm0.02$ (68% confidence), which is an improvement of 43% compared to planckalone. we test how our results are potentially subject to three astrophysicalsources of contamination: source-lens clustering, the intrinsic alignment ofgalaxy shapes, and baryonic effects. we explore future limitations of thecosmological use of third-order weak lensing, such as the nonlinear model andthe gaussianity of the likelihood function.

0803.0327	a large population of recently-quenched red-sequence dwarf galaxies in  the outskirts of the coma cluster	we analyse the stellar populations of 75 red-sequence dwarf galaxies in thecoma cluster, based on high signal-to-noise spectroscopy from the 6.5m mmt. thesample covers a luminosity range 3-4 magnitudes below m*, in the cluster coreand in a field centred 1 deg to the south-west. we find a strong dependence ofthe absorption line strengths with location in the cluster. galaxies furtherfrom the cluster centre have stronger balmer lines than inner-field galaxies ofthe same luminosity. the magnesium lines are weaker at large radius, while theiron lines are not correlated with radius. converting the line strengths intoestimates of stellar age, metallicity and abundance ratios, we find thegradients are driven by variations in age (&gt;6 sigma significance) and in theiron abundance fe/h (~2.7 sigma significance). the light element (mg, c, n, ca)abundances are almost independent of radius. at radius of 0.4-1.3 degree(~0.3-1.0x the virial radius), dwarf galaxies have ages ~3.8 gyr on average,compared to ~6 gyr near the cluster centre. the outer dwarfs are also ~50% moreiron-enriched, at given luminosity. our results confirm earlier indicationsthat the ages of red-sequence galaxies depend on location within clusters, andin coma in particular. the exceptionally strong trends found here suggest thatdwarf galaxies are especially susceptible to environmental "quenching", and/orthat the south-west part of coma is a particularly clear example of recentquenching in an infalling subcluster.

1411.6339	on the perturbation of the luminosity distance by peculiar motions	we consider some aspects of the perturbation to the luminosity distance$d(z)$ that are of relevance for sn1a cosmology and for future peculiarvelocity surveys at non-negligible redshifts.  1) previous work has shown that the correction to the lowest orderperturbation $\delta d / d = -\delta v / c z$ has the peculiar characteristicthat it appears to depend on the absolute state of motion of sources, ratherthan on their motion relative to that of the observer. the resolution of thisapparent violation of the equivalence principle is that it is necessary toallow for evolution of the velocities with time, and also, when consideringperturbations on the scale of the observer-source separation, to include thegravitational redshift effect. we provide an expression for $\delta d / d$ thatprovides a physically consistent way to measure peculiar velocities anddetermine their impact for sn1a cosmology.  2) we then calculate the perturbation to the redshift as a function of sourceflux density, which has been proposed as an alternative probe of large-scalemotions. we show how the inclusion of surface brightness modulation modifiesthe relation between $\delta z(m)$ and the peculiar velocity, and that, whilethe noise properties of this method might appear promising, the velocity signalis swamped by the effect of galaxy clustering for most scales of interest.  3) we show how, in linear theory, peculiar velocity measurements are biaseddownwards by the effect of smaller scale motions or by measurement errors (suchas in photometric redshifts). our results nicely explain the effects seen insimulations by koda et al.\ 2013.  we critically examine the prospects for extending peculiar velocity studiesto larger scales with near-term future surveys.

astro-ph;0011234	on the dependence of spectroscopic indices of early-type galaxies on  age, metallicity and velocity dispersion	we investigate the mg-sigma and &lt;fe&gt;-sigma relations in a sample of 72early-type galaxies drawn mostly from cluster and group environments using ahomogeneous data-set which is well-calibrated onto the lick/ids system. thesmall intrinsic scatter in mg at a given sigma gives upper limits on the spreadin age and metallicity of 49% and 32% respectively, if the spread is attributedto one quantity only and if the variations in age and metallicity areuncorrelated. the age/metallicity distribution as inferred from the hbeta vs&lt;fe&gt; diagnostic diagram reinforces this conclusion, as we find mostly galaxieswith large luminosity weighted ages spanning a range in metallicity. in oursample we do not find significant evidence for an anti-correlation of ages andmetallicities which would keep the index-sigma relations tight while hiding alarge spread in age and metallicity. as a result of correlated errors in theage-metallicity plane, a mild age-metallicity anti-correlation cannot becompletely ruled out given the current data. correcting the line-strengthsindices for non-solar abundance ratios following the recent paper by trager etal., leads to higher mean metallicity and slightly younger age estimates whilepreserving the metallicity sequence. the [mg/fe] ratio is mildly correlatedwith the central velocity dispersion and ranges from [mg/fe]=0.05 to 0.3 forgalaxies with sigma &gt; 100 km/s. under the assumption that there is no agegradient along the index-sigma relations, the abundance-ratio correctedmg-sigma, &lt;fe&gt;-sigma and hbeta-sigma relations give consistent estimates ofdelta [m/h]/ delta log sigma = 0.9 (+- 0.1). the slope of the hbeta-sigmarelation limits a potential age trend as a function of sigma to 2-3 gyrs alongthe sequence.(abriged)

astro-ph;0108194	a synthesis of data from fundamental plane and surface brightness  fluctuation surveys	we perform a series of comparisons between distance-independent photometricand spectroscopic properties used in the surface brightness fluctuations (sbf)and fundamental plane (fp) methods of early-type galaxy distance estimation.the data are taken from two recent surveys: the sbf survey of galaxy distancesand the streaming motions of abell clusters (smac) fp survey. we derive arelation between v-i colour and mg_2 index using nearly 200 galaxies anddiscuss implications for galactic extinction estimates and early-type galaxystellar populations. we find that the reddenings from schlegel et al (1998) forgalaxies with $e(b{-}v) \gta 0.2$ mag appear to be overestimated by 5--10%, butwe do not find significant evidence for large-scale dipole errors in theextinction map. in comparison to stellar population models having solarelemental abundance ratios, the galaxies in our sample are generally too blueat a given mg_2; we ascribe this to the well-known enhancement of the$\alpha$-elements in luminous early-type galaxies. we confirm a tight relationbetween stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma$ and the sbf `fluctuation count'parameter \nbar, which is a luminosity-weighted measure of the total number ofstars in a galaxy. the correlation between \nbar and $\sigma$ is even tighterthan that between mg_2 and $\sigma$. finally, we derive fp photometricparameters for 280 galaxies from the sbf survey data set. comparisons withexternal sources allow us to estimate the errors on these parameters and derivethe correction necessary to bring them onto the smac system. the data are usedin a companion paper which compares the distances derived from the fp and sbfmethods.

astro-ph;0109132	the optical luminosity function of virialized systems	we determine the optical luminosity function of virialized systems over thefull range of density enhancements, from single galaxies to clusters ofgalaxies. the analysis is based on galaxy systems identified from the nearbyoptical galaxy (nog) sample, which is the largest, all-sky catalog ofobjectively- identified bound objects presently available. we find that theb-band luminosity function of systems is insensitive to the choice of thegroup-finding algorithms and is well described, over the absolute-magnituderange -24.5 &lt; m &lt; -18.5, by a schechter function with alpha=-1.4, mstar=-23.1and phistar=4.8 10^{-4} mpc^-3 the characteristic luminosity of virializedsystems is ~3 times brighter than that of the luminosity function of galaxies.our results show that half of the luminosity of the universe is generated insystems with l&lt;2.9 lstar and that 10% of the overall luminosity density issupplied by systems with l&gt;30 lstar. we find a significant environmentaldependence in the luminosity function of systems, in the sense that overdenseregions, as measured on scales of 5 mpc, preferentially host brighter, andpresumably more massive, virialized systems.

astro-ph;0109134	the mass-to-light function of virialized systems and the relationship  between their optical and x-ray properties	we compare the b-band luminosity function of virialized halos with the massfunction predicted by the press-schechter theory in cold dark mattercosmogonies. we find that all cosmological models fail to match our results ifa constant mass-to-light ratio is assumed. in order for these models to matchthe faint end of the luminosity function, a mass-to-light ratio decreasing withluminosity as $l^{-0.5\pm 0.06}$ is required. for a $\lambda$cdm model, themass-to-light function has a minimum of $\sim 100 h^{-1}_{75}$ in solar unitsin the $b$-band, corresponding to $\sim 25%$ of the baryons in the form ofstars, and this minimum occurs close to the luminosity of an $l^*$ galaxy. atthe high-mass end, the $\lambda$cdm model requires a mass-to-light ratioincreasing with luminosity as $l^{+0.5 \pm 0.26}$. we also derive the halooccupation number, i.e. the number of galaxies brighter than $\lgal^*$ hostedin a virialized system. we find that the halo occupation number scalesnon-linearly with the total mass of the system, $n\sbr{gal}(&gt;\lgal^*) \proptom^{0.55\pm0.026}$ or the $\lambda$cdm model. we find a break in the power-lawslope of the x-ray-to-optical luminosity relation, independent of thecosmological model. this break occurs at a scale corresponding to poor groups.in the $\lambda$cdm model, the poor-group mass is also the scale at which themass-to-light ratio of virialized systems begins to increase. thiscorrespondence suggests a physical link between star formation and the x-rayproperties of halos, possibly due to preheating by supernovae or to efficientcooling of low-entropy gas into galaxies.

astro-ph;0111183	early-type galaxy distances from the fundamental plane and surface  brightness fluctuations	we compare two methods for deriving distances to early-type galaxies:fundamental plane (fp) and surface brightness fluctuations (sbf) distances for170 galaxies. a third set of distances is provided by predictions derived fromthe density field of the iras redshift survey. overall there is good agreement.however, several nearby, low-luminosity, mainly s0 galaxies have systematicallylow fp distances; we conclude that this is at least partly due to recent starformation and consequently low mass-to-light ratios. the tie between thecepheid-calibrated sbf distances (mpc) and the far-field calibrated fpdistances (km/s) yields a hubble constant h_0 = 68 +/- 3 km/s/mpc, while thecomparison between sbf and the iras-reconstructed distances yields h_0 = 74 +/-2 (internal errorbars). possible explanations for the marginal inconsistencyinclude systematic errors in the redshift survey completeness estimates or inthe fp aperture corrections, but at this point, the best estimate of h_0 fromearly-type galaxies may be a simple average of the above two estimates. afterrevising the sbf distances to be in agreement with the final set of key projectcepheid distances, we conclude h_0 = 73 +/- 4 +/- 11, where the second errorbarrepresents the total systematic uncertainty in the distance zero point. we alsodiscuss the recently introduced "fluctuation star count" parameter nbar as aless demanding alternative to (v-i) for calibrating sbf distances. thenbar-calibrated sbf method is akin to a hybrid sbf-fp distance indicator, andwe find that the use of nbar actually improves the sbf distances. further studyof nbar would provide useful constraints for elliptical galaxy formationmodels.

astro-ph;0404386	streaming motions of galaxy clusters within 12000 km/s - v. the peculiar  velocity field	we analyze in detail the peculiar velocity field traced by 56 clusters within120 h^-1 mpc in the streaming motions of abell clusters (smac) sample. the bulkflow of the smac sample is 687 +- 203 km/s, toward l = 260 +- 13, b = 0 +- 11.we discuss possible systematic errors and show that no systematic effect islarger than half of the random error. the flow does not drop off significantlywith depth, which suggests that it is generated by structures on large scales.in particular, a great attractor as originally proposed by lynden-bell et al.cannot be responsible for the smac bulk flow. the smac data suggest infall intoan attractor at the location of the shapley concentration, but the detection ismarginal (at the 90% confidence level). we find that distant attractors inaddition to the shapley concentration are required to explain the smac bulkflow. a comparison with peculiar velocities predicted from the iras psczredshift survey shows good agreement with a best fit value of beta_i =omega^0.6/b_i = 0.39 +- 0.17. however, the pscz density field is not sufficientto acount for all of the smac bulk motion. we also detect, at the 98%confidence level, a residual bulk flow of 372 +- 127 km/s toward l = 273, b = 6which must be generated by sources not included in the pscz catalogue, that is,either beyond 200 h^-1 mpc, in the zone of avoidance or in superclustersundersampled by iras. finally, we compare the smac bulk flow with other recentmeasurements. we suggest that a bulk flow of 225 km/s toward l = 300, b = 10 atdepths greater than 60 h^-1 mpc is consistent with all peculiar velocitysurveys, when allowance is made for sparse sampling effects.

astro-ph;0505301	noao fundamental plane survey -- ii. age and metallicity along the red  sequence	we present spectroscopic linestrength data for 4097 red-sequence galaxies in93 low-redshift galaxy clusters, and use these to investigate variations inaverage stellar populations as a function of galaxy mass. our analysis includesan improved treatment of nebular emission contamination, which affects ~10% ofthe sample galaxies. using the stellar population models of d. thomas andcollaborators, we simultaneously fit twelve observed linestrength-sigmarelations in terms of common underlying trends of age, [z/h] (totalmetallicity) and a/fe (alpha-element enhancement). we find that the observedlinestrength-sigma relations can be explained only if higher-mass red-sequencegalaxies are, on average, older, more metal rich, and more alpha-enhanced thanlower-mass galaxies. quantitatively, the scaling relations areage=sigma^(0.59+/-0.13), z/h=sigma^(0.53+/-0.08) and a/fe=sigma^(0.31+/-0.06),where the errors reflect the range obtained using different subsets of indices.we conclude that although the stars in giant red galaxies in clusters formedearly, most of the galaxies at the faint end joined the red sequence only atrecent epochs. this "down-sizing" trend is in good qualitative agreement withobservations of the red sequence at higher redshifts, but is not predicted bysemi-analytic models of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0508328	mass-to-light ratios of galaxy groups from weak lensing	we present the findings of our weak lensing study of a sample of 116 cnoc2galaxy groups. the lensing signal is used to estimate the mass-to-light ratioof these galaxy groups. the best fit isothermal sphere model to our lensingdata has an einstein radius of 0.88"+/-0.12", which corresponds to ashear-weighted velocity dispersion of 245+/-18 km/s. the mean mass-to-lightratio within 1 h^-1 mpc is 185+/-28 h times solar in the b-band and isindependent of radius from the group center.  the signal-to-noise ratio of the shear measurement is sufficient to split thesample into subsets of "poor" and "rich" galaxy groups. the poor galaxy groupswere found to have an average velocity dispersion of 193+/-38 km/s and amass-to-light ratio of 134+/-26 h times solar in the b-band, while the richgalaxy groups have a velocity dispersion of 270+/-39 km/s and a mass-to-lightratio of 278+/-42 h times solar in the b-band, similar to the mass-to-lightratio of clusters. this steep increase in the mass-to-light ratio as a functionof mass, suggests that the mass scale of ~10^13 solar masses is where thetransition between the actively star-forming field environment and thepassively-evolving cluster environment occurs. this is the first such detectionfrom weak lensing.

astro-ph;0511012	cosmological parameters from the comparison of the 2mass gravity field  with peculiar velocity surveys	we compare the peculiar velocity field within 65 $h^{-1}$ mpc predicted from2mass photometry and public redshift data to three independent peculiarvelocity surveys based on type ia supernovae, surface brightness fluctuationsin ellipticals, and tully-fisher distances to spirals. the three peculiarvelocity samples are each in good agreement with the predicted velocities andproduce consistent results for $\beta_{k}=\omega\sbr{m}^{0.6}/b_{k}$. takentogether the best fit $\beta_{k} = 0.49 \pm 0.04$. we explore the effects ofmorphology on the determination of $\beta$ by splitting the 2mass sample intoe+s0 and s+irr density fields and find both samples are equally good tracers ofthe underlying dark matter distribution, but that early-types are moreclustered by a relative factor $b\sbr{e}/b\sbr{s} \sim 1.6$. the densityfluctuations of 2mass galaxies in $8 h^{-1}$ mpc spheres in the local volume isfound to be $\sigma\sbr{8,k} = 0.9$. from this result and our value of$\beta_{k}$, we find $\sigma_8 (\omega\sbr{m}/0.3)^{0.6} = 0.91\pm0.12$. thisis in excellent agreement with results from the iras redshift surveys, as wellas other cosmological probes. combining the 2mass and iras peculiar velocityresults yields $\sigma_8 (\omega\sbr{m}^/0.3)^{0.6} = 0.85\pm0.05$.

astro-ph;0603688	the noao fundamental plane survey - iii. variations in the stellar  populations of red-sequence galaxies from the cluster core to the virial  radius	we analyse absorption line-strength indices for ~3000 red-sequence galaxiesin 94 nearby clusters, to investigate systematic variations of their stellarcontent with location in the host cluster. the data are drawn from the noaofundamental plane survey. our adopted method is a generalization of thatintroduced by nelan et al. to determine the global age-mass andmetallicity-mass relations from the same survey. we find strong evidence for achange in galaxy properties, at fixed mass, over a range from the clustercentre to the virial radius, r_200. for example, red-sequence galaxies furtherout in the clusters have weaker mgb5177 (at ~8 sigma significance) and strongerhbeta and hgamma absorption (~3 sigma, ~4 sigma) than galaxies of the samevelocity dispersion in the cluster cores. the fe5270 and fe5335 indices showonly very weak trends with radius. using a total of twelve indices, the patternof cluster-centric gradients is considered in light of their differentdependences on stellar age and chemical composition. the measured gradients forall twelve indices can be reproduced by a model in which red-sequence galaxiesat ~1 r_200 have on average younger ages (by 15+/-4%) and lower alpha-elementabundance ratios (by 10+/-2%), than galaxies of the same velocity dispersionbut located near the cluster centre. for the total metallicity, z/h, nosignificant gradient is found (2+/-3% larger at r_200 than in the core). thecluster-centric age and alpha/fe gradients are in the sense expected ifgalaxies in the cluster core were accreted at an earlier epoch than those atlarger radii, and if this earlier accretion contributed to an earlier cessationof star formation. the size of the observed age trend is comparable topredictions from semi-analytic models of hierarchical galaxy formation.

astro-ph;9611083	the environmental dependence of brightest cluster galaxies: implications  for large-scale flows	(shortened) we construct a subsample of the lauer &amp; postman (lp) brightestcluster galaxy (bcg) sample which comprises 64 abell/aco clusters with x-rayluminosities from rosat. we find that both bcg metric luminosities andresiduals from the l-alpha relation of lp are significantly correlated with thex-ray luminosity of the cluster at the 99.6% confidence level, in the sensethat more x-ray luminous clusters have brighter bcgs. the strength of thiscorrelation increases with increasing x-ray luminosity and with increasingvalues of alpha. we obtain a new distance indicator for bcgs, the l-alpha-l_xrelation. applying this new relation to our sample, we find that the framedefined by these clusters has a bulk motion of 494 km/s in the cmb frame butthe 95% confidence range on the amplitude is 306 to 1419 km/s. these resultsare inconsistent with this frame being at rest in the cmb frame at the 98.6%confidence level. for the outer shell subsample (57 bcgs with cz &gt; 6000 km/s),the bulk motion is consistent both with no motion in the cmb frame and with themotion found by lp. however, our analysis of the 107 lauer and postman bcgs inthis outer shell indicates that, even with no x-ray correction, the cmb-framebulk motion of these clusters is not statistically different from zero.furthermore, for the subsample with x-ray data, the x-ray correction goes inthe sense of reducing both the amplitude (by 663 km/s) and significance (from98.8% to 83.8%) of its cmb-frame bulk motion, as well as reducing the internalinconsistency between its motion and that of the remainder of the lauer andpostman sample with no x-ray data. claims of large-scale, large-amplitude bulkflows should be regarded with caution until x-ray data become available formore clusters.

astro-ph;9711341	galaxy-galaxy lensing in the hubble deep field: the halo tully-fisher  relation at intermediate redshift	a tangential distortion of background source galaxies around foreground lensgalaxies in the hubble deep field is detected at the 99.3% confidence level. animportant element of our analysis is the use of photometric redshifts todetermine distances of lens and source galaxies and rest-frame b-bandluminosities of the lens galaxies. the lens galaxy halos obey a tully-fisherrelation between halo circular velocity and luminosity; the typical lensgalaxy, at a redshift z = 0.6, has a circular velocity of 210 +/-40 km/s at m_b= -18.5, if q_0 = 0.5. control tests, in which lens and source positions andsource ellipticities are randomized, confirm the significance level of thedetection quoted above. furthermore, a marginal signal is also detected from anindependent, fainter sample of source galaxies without photometric redshifts.potential systematic effects, such as contamination by aligned satellitegalaxies, the distortion of source shapes by the light of the foregroundgalaxies, psf anisotropies, and contributions from mass distributed on thescale of galaxy groups are shown to be negligible. a comparison of our resultwith the local tully-fisher relation indicates that intermediate-redshiftgalaxies are fainter than local spirals by 1.0 +/- 0.6 b mag at a fixedcircular velocity. this is consistent with some spectroscopic studies of therotation curves of intermediate-redshift galaxies. this result suggests thatthe strong increase in the global luminosity density with redshift is dominatedby evolution in the galaxy number density.

astro-ph;9812367	a test for large-scale systematic errors in maps of galactic reddening	accurate maps of galactic reddening are important for a number ofapplications, such as mapping the peculiar velocity field in the nearbyuniverse. of particular concern are systematic errors which vary slowly as afunction of position on the sky, as these would induce spurious bulk flow. wehave compared the reddenings of burstein &amp; heiles (bh) and those of schlegel,finkbeiner &amp; davis (sfd) to independent estimates of the reddening, forgalactic latitudes |b| &gt; 10. our primary source of galactic reddening estimatescomes from comparing the difference between the observed b-v colors ofearly-type galaxies, and the predicted b-v color determined from the b-v--mg_2relation. we have fitted a dipole to the residuals in order to look forlarge-scale systematic deviations. there is marginal evidence for a dipolarresidual in the comparison between the sfd maps and the observed early-typegalaxy reddenings. if this is due to an error in the sfd maps, then it can becorrected with a small (13%) multiplicative dipole term. we argue, however,that this difference is more likely to be due to a small (0.01 mag.) systematicerror in the measured b-v colors of the early-type galaxies. thisinterpretation is supported by a smaller, independent data set (globularcluster and rr lyrae stars), which yields a result inconsistent with theearly-type galaxy residual dipole. bh reddenings are found to have nosignificant systematic residuals, apart from the known problem in the region230 &lt; l &lt; 310, -20 &lt; b &lt; 20.

0809.4041	consistently large cosmic flows on scales of 100 mpc/h: a challenge for  the standard lcdm cosmology	peculiar velocity surveys have non-uniform spatial distributions of tracers,so that the bulk flow estimated from them does not correspond to that of asimple volume such as a sphere. thus bulk flow estimates are generally notstrictly comparable between surveys, even those whose effective depths aresimilar. in addition, the sparseness of typical surveys can lead to aliasing ofsmall scale power into what is meant to be a probe of the largest scales. herewe introduce a new method of calculating bulk flow moments where velocities areweighted to give an optimal estimate of the bulk flow of an idealized survey,with the variance of the difference between the estimate and the actual flowbeing minimized. these "minimum variance" estimates can be designed to estimatethe bulk flow on a particular scale with minimal sensitivity to small scalepower, and are comparable between surveys. we compile all major peculiarvelocity surveys and apply this new method to them. we find that most surveyswe studied are highly consistent with each other. taken together the datasuggest that the bulk flow within a gaussian window of radius 50 mpc/h is 407km/s toward l=287 and b=8. the large-scale bulk motion is consistent withpredictions from the local density field. this indicates that there aresignificant density fluctuations on very large scales. a flow of this amplitudeon such a large scale is not expected in the wmap5-normalized lcdm cosmology,for which the predicted one-dimensional r.m.s. velocity is ~110 km/s. the largeamplitude of the observed bulk flow favors the upper values of the wmap5error-ellipse, but even the point at the top of the wmap5 95% confidenceellipse predicts a bulk flow which is too low compared to that observed at &gt;98%confidence level.

0810.5558	a spectroscopic survey of dwarf galaxies in the coma cluster: stellar  populations, environment and downsizing	we investigate the stellar populations in a sample of 89 faint (m*+2 to m*+4)red galaxies in the coma cluster, using high s/n spectroscopy from the mmt. oursample is drawn from two 1-degree fields, one centred on the cluster core andthe other located a degree to the south west of the cluster centre. for acomparison sample we use published high-s/n data for red-sequence galaxies inthe shapley supercluster. we use state-of-the-art stellar population models toinfer the ssp-equivalent age and metallicity (fe/h) for each galaxy, as well asthe abundances of the light elements mg, ca, c and n. the ages of the comadwarfs span a wide range from &lt;2 gyr to &gt;10 gyr, with a strong environmentaldependence. the oldest galaxies are found only in the core, while most of thegalaxies in the outer south-west field have ages ~3 gyr. the galaxies have ametallicity range -1.0 &lt; [fe/h] &lt; 0.0, and follow the same age-metallicity-massplane as high-mass galaxies, but with increased intrinsic scatter. the mg/feabundance ratios are on average slightly super-solar, and span a range -0.1 &lt;[mg/fe] &lt; +0.4. the highest mg enhancements are found only in the cluster core,while solar ratios predominate in the outskirts. depending on the assumedstar-formation history (quenched versus burst-dominated), the number of dwarfgalaxies on the red sequence in the coma core has doubled since z~0.4-0.7.these estimates bracket the red-sequence growth timescales found by directstudies of distant clusters. in the south-west field, the red sequence wasestablished only at z~0.1-0.2. our observations confirm previous indications ofvery recently quenched star formation in this part of the cluster. our resultssupport the picture in which much of the cluster passive dwarf population wasgenerated by environment-driven transformation of infalling late-type galaxies.
