0902.1624	simulations of minor mergers. ii. the phase-space structure of thick  discs	we analyse the phase-space structure of simulated thick discs that are theresult of a significant merger between a disc galaxy and a satellite. our maingoal is to establish what would be the characteristic imprints of a mergerorigin for the galactic thick disc. we find that the spatial distributionpredicted for thick disc stars is asymmetric, seemingly in agreement withrecent observations of the milky way thick disc. near the sun, the accretedstars are expected to rotate more slowly, to have broad velocity distributions,and to occupy preferentially the wings of the line-of-sight velocitydistributions. the majority of the stars in our model thick discs have loweccentricity orbits (in clear reference to the pre-existing heated disc) whichgives rise to a characteristic (sinusoidal) pattern for their line of sightvelocities as function of galactic longitude. the z-component of the angularmomentum of thick disc stars provides a clear discriminant between stars fromthe pre-existing disc and those from the satellite, particularly at largeradii. these results are robust against the particular choices of initialconditions made in our simulations, and thus provide clean tests of the discheating via a minor merger scenario for the formation of thick discs.

0902.2759	galactic dynamics and local dark matter	the concordance lambda cold dark matter (lambda-cdm) model for the formationof structure in the universe, while remarkably successful at describingobservations of structure on large scales, continues to be challenged byobservations on galactic scales. fortunately, cdm models and their variousproposed alternatives make a rich variety of testable predictions that make thelocal group and our own milky way galaxy key laboratories for exploring darkmatter (dm) in this regime. however, some of the most definitive tests of localdm require microarcsecond astrometry of faint sources, an astrometric regimethat is a unique niche of sim lite. this chapter explores the important anddistinct contributions that can be made by sim lite in the exploration ofgalaxy dynamics and dm on galaxy scales and that have cosmologicalconsequences. key areas of potential sim lite exploration include (1) measuringthe shape, orientation, density law, and lumpiness of the dark halo of themilky way and other nearby galaxies, (2) determining the orbits of galacticsatellites, which may be representatives of late infall from the hierarchicalformation of the milky way, (3) ascertaining the distribution of angularmomentum and orbital anisotropy of stars and globular clusters to the outerreaches of the galactic halo, dynamical properties that hold clues to the earlyhierarchical formation of the galaxy, (4) measuring the physical nature of dmby placing strong constraints on the phase space density in the cores of nearbydsph galaxies, and (5) reconstructing the dynamical history of the local groupthrough the determination of orbits and masses of its constituent galaxies.

0902.2835	properties of dark matter revealed by astrometric measurements of the  milky way and local galaxies	the fact that dark matter (dm), thus far, has revealed itself only on scalesof galaxies and larger, again thrusts onto astrophysics the opportunity and theresponsibility to confront the age old mystery "what is the nature of matter?"by deriving basic data on the nature of dm - e.g., mass of its particle(s),present mean temperature, distribution in galaxies and other structures in theuniverse, and capacity for dissipational collapse - we will be uncovering theproperties of the dominant species of matter in the universe and significantlyextending the standard models of particle physics. determining the mass of thedm particle to an order of magnitude would help to sort out the particle familyto which it (or they) belongs. beyond mass, there are issues of stability. thedm particle may be unstable with a measurable half-life, or it may becomeunstable after absorbing a certain amount of energy from collisions. in bothcases it would contribute to the present hot dark matter component.  some key parameters of dm can most accurately be measured in the very nearbyuniverse because dm dominates the mass in the outer milky way (mw), in othergalaxies in the local group, and in the local group in its entirety. thepresence and amount of dm can be quantified by study of dynamical processesobservable in fine detail within these entities. precise measurements of 3-dvelocities for stars, coherent star streams, and stars in satellite stellarsystems out to the edge of the galaxy can reveal "what is the shape,orientation, density law, and lumpiness of the dark matter halo" as well as"what is the total mass of the galaxy?"

0903.3043	mapping the galactic halo viii: quantifying substructure	we have measured the amount of kinematic substructure in the galactic halousing the final data set from the spaghetti project, a pencil-beam highlatitude sky survey. our sample contains 101 photometrically selected andspectroscopically confirmed giants with accurate distance, radial velocity andmetallicity information. we have developed a new clustering estimator: the"4distance" measure, which when applied to our data set leads to theidentification of 1 group and 7 pairs of clumped stars. the group, with 6members, can confidently be matched to tidal debris of the sagittarius dwarfgalaxy. two pairs match the properties of known virgo structures. using modelsof the disruption of sagittarius in galactic potentials with different degreesof dark halo flattening, we show that this favors a spherical or prolate haloshape, as demonstrated by newberg et al. (2007) using sdss data. one additionalpair can be linked to older sagittarius debris. we find that 20% of the starsin the spaghetti data set are in substructures. from comparison with randomdata sets we derive a very conservative lower limit of 10% to the amount ofsubstructure in the halo. however, comparison to numerical simulations showsthat our results are also consistent with a halo entirely built up fromdisrupted satellites, provided the dominating features are relatively broad dueto early merging or relatively heavy progenitor satellites.

0905.3554	the origin of extended disk galaxies at z=2	galaxy formation models typically assume that the size and rotation speed ofgalaxy disks are largely dictated by the mass, concentration, and spin of theirsurrounding dark matter haloes. equally important, however, are the fraction ofbaryons in the halo that collect into the central galaxy, as well as the netangular momentum that they are able to retain during its assembly process. weexplore the latter using a set of four large cosmological n-body/gasdynamicalsimulations drawn from the owls (overwhelmingly large simulations) project.these runs differ only in their implementation of feedback from supernovae. wefind that, when expressed as fractions of their virial values, galaxy mass andnet angular momentum are tightly correlated. galaxy mass fractions,m_d=m_gal/m_vir, depend strongly on feedback, but only weakly on halo mass orspin over the halo mass range explored here (m_vir&gt;1e11 h^{-1}m_sun). theangular momentum of a galaxy, j_d=j_gal/j_vir, correlates with m_d in a mannerthat is insensitive to feedback and that deviates strongly from the simple j_d= m_d assumption often adopted in semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. them_d-j_d correlation implies that, in a given halo, galaxy disk size is maximalwhen the central galaxy makes up a substantial fraction (~20%-30%) of allbaryons within the virial radius. at z=2, such systems may host gaseous diskswith radial scale lengths as large as those reported for star-forming disks bythe sins survey, even in moderately massive haloes of average spin. extendeddisks at z=2 may thus signal the presence of systems where galaxy formation hasbeen particularly efficient, rather than the existence of haloes with unusuallyhigh spin parameter.

0909.1291	on the nature of the milky way satellites	we combine a series of high-resolution simulations with semi-analytic galaxyformation models to follow the evolution of a system resembling the milky wayand its satellites. the semi-analytic model is based on that developed for themillennium simulation, and successfully reproduces the properties of galaxieson large scales, as well as those of the milky way. in this model, we are ableto reproduce the luminosity function of the satellites around the milky way bypreventing cooling in haloes with vvir &lt; 16.7 km/s (i.e. the atomic hydrogencooling limit) and including the impact of the reionization of the universe.the physical properties of our model satellites (e.g. mean metallicities, ages,half-light radii and mass-to-light ratios) are in good agreement with thelatest observational measurements. we do not find a strong dependence upon theparticular implementation of supernova feedback, but a scheme which is moreefficient in galaxies embedded in smaller haloes, i.e. shallower potentialwells, gives better agreement with the properties of the ultra-faintsatellites. our model predicts that the brightest satellites are associatedwith the most massive subhaloes, are accreted later (z $\lta$ 1), and haveextended star formation histories, with only 1 per cent of their stars made bythe end of the reionization. on the other hand, the faintest satellites wereaccreted early, are dominated by stars with age &gt; 10 gyr, and a few of themformed most of their stars before the reionization was complete. objects withluminosities comparable to those of the classical mw satellites are associatedwith dark matter subhaloes with a peak circular velocity $\gta$ 10 km/s, inagreement with the latest constraints.

0910.0471	the effect of tidal stripping on composite stellar populations in dwarf  spheroidal galaxies	we use n-body simulations to study the effects of tides on the kinematicalstructure of satellite galaxies orbiting a milky way-like potential. our workis motivated by observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the local group,for which often a distinction is possible between a cold centrally concentratedmetal rich and a hot, extended metal poor population. we find that an importantattenuation of the initial differences in the distribution of the two stellarcomponents occurs for orbits with small pericentric radii (r_per &lt; 20 kpc).this is mainly due to: i) the loss of the gravitational support provided by thedark matter component after tidal stripping takes place, which forces are-configuration of the luminous components, and ii) tides preferentiallyaffect the more extended stellar component, leading to a net decrease in itsvelocity dispersion as a response for the mass loss, which thus shrinks thekinematical gap. we apply these ideas to the sculptor and carina dwarfspheroidals. differences in their orbits might help to explain, under theassumption of similar initial configurations, why in the former a clearkinematical separation between metal poor and metal rich stars is apparent,while in carina this segregation is significantly more subtle.

0912.2250	thick-disk evolution induced by the growth of an embedded thin disk	we perform collisionless n-body simulations to investigate the evolution ofthe structural and kinematical properties of simulated thick disks induced bythe growth of an embedded thin disk. the thick disks used in the present studyoriginate from cosmologically-common 5:1 encounters between initially-thinprimary disk galaxies and infalling satellites. the growing thin disks aremodeled as static gravitational potentials and we explore a variety ofgrowing-disk parameters that are likely to influence the response of thickdisks. we find that the final thick-disk properties depend strongly on thetotal mass and radial scale-length of the growing thin disk, and much lesssensitively on its growth timescale and vertical scale-height as well as theinitial sense of thick-disk rotation. overall, the growth of an embedded thindisk can cause a substantial contraction in both the radial and verticaldirection, resulting in a significant decrease in the scale-lengths andscale-heights of thick disks. kinematically, a growing thin disk can induce anotable increase in the mean rotation and velocity dispersions of thick-diskstars. we conclude that the reformation of a thin disk via gas accretion mayplay a significant role in setting the structure and kinematics of thick disks,and thus it is an important ingredient in models of thick-disk formation.

1002.2963	the nir ca ii triplet at low metallicity - searching for extremely  low-metallicity stars in classical dwarf galaxies	the nir ca ii triplet absorption lines have proven to be an important toolfor quantitative spectroscopy of individual red giant branch stars in the localgroup, providing a better understanding of metallicities of stars in the milkyway and dwarf galaxies and thereby an opportunity to constrain their chemicalevolution processes. an interesting puzzle in this field is the significantlack of extremely metal-poor stars, below [fe/h]=-3, found in classical dwarfgalaxies around the milky way using this technique. the question arises whetherthese stars are really absent, or if the empirical ca ii triplet method used tostudy these systems is biased in the low-metallicity regime. here we presentresults of synthetic spectral analysis of the ca ii triplet, that is focused ona better understanding of spectroscopic measurements of low-metallicity giantstars. our results start to deviate strongly from the widely-used and linearempirical calibrations at [fe/h]&lt;-2. we provide a new calibration for ca iitriplet studies which is valid for -0.5&lt;[fe/h]&lt;-4. we subsequently apply thisnew calibration to current data sets and suggest that the classical dwarfgalaxies are not so devoid of extremely low-metallicity stars as was previouslythought.

0707.4477	halo star streams in the solar neighborhood	we have assembled a sample of halo stars in the solar neighborhood to lookfor halo substructure in velocity and angular momentum space. our sampleincludes red giants, rr lyrae, and red horizontal branch stars within 2.5 kpcof the sun with [fe/h] less than -1.0. it was chosen to include stars withaccurate distances, space velocities, and metallicities as well aswell-quantified errors. we confirm the existence of the streams found by helmiand coworkers, which we refer to as the h99 streams. these streams have adouble-peaked velocity distribution in the z direction. we use the results ofmodeling of the h99 streams by helmi and collaborators to test how one mightuse v_z velocity information and radial velocity information to detectkinematic substructure in the halo. we find that detecting the h99 streams withradial velocities alone would require a large sample. we use the velocitydistribution of the h99 streams to estimate their age. from our model of theprogenitor of the h99 streams, we determine that it was accreted between 6 and9 gyr ago. the h99 streams have [alpha/fe] abundances similar to other halostars in the solar neighborhood, suggesting that the gas that formed thesestars were enriched mostly by type ii sne. we have also discovered in angularmomentum space two other possible substructures, which we refer to as theretrograde and prograde outliers. the retrograde outliers are likely to be halosubstructure, but the prograde outliers are most likely part of the smoothhalo. the retrograde outliers have significant structure in the v_phi directionand show a range of [alpha/fe]. the methods presented in this paper can be usedto exploit the kinematic information present in future large databases likerave, sdssii/segue, and gaia.

1004.4974	on the identification of merger debris in the {\it gaia} era	we model the formation of the galactic stellar halo via the accretion ofsatellite galaxies onto a time-dependent semi-cosmological galactic potential.our goal is to characterize the substructure left by these accretion events ina close manner to what may be possible with the {\it gaia} mission. we havecreated a synthetic {\it gaia} solar neighbourhood catalogue by convolving the6d phase-space coordinates of stellar particles from our disrupted satelliteswith the latest estimates of the {\it gaia} measurement errors, and includedrealistic background contamination due to the galactic disc(s) and bulge. wefind that, even after accounting for the expected observational errors, theresulting phase-space is full of substructure. we are able to successfullyisolate roughly 50% of the different satellites contributing to the `solarneighbourhood' by applying the mean-shift clustering algorithm inenergy-angular momentum space. furthermore, a fourier analysis of the space oforbital frequencies allows us to obtain accurate estimates of time sinceaccretion for approximately 30% of the recovered satellites.

1012.2127	the dawning of the stream of aquarius in rave	we identify a new, nearby (0.5 &lt; d &lt; 10 kpc) stream in data from the radialvelocity experiment (rave). as the majority of stars in the stream lie in theconstellation of aquarius we name it the aquarius stream. we identify 15members of the stream lying between 30 &lt; l &lt; 75 and -70&lt; b &lt;-50, withheliocentric line-of-sight velocities v_los~-200 km/s. the members are outliersin the radial velocity distribution, and the overdensity is statisticallysignificant when compared to mock samples created with both the besan\c{c}ongalaxy model and newly-developed code galaxia. the metallicity distributionfunction and isochrone fit in the log g - t_eff plane suggest the streamconsists of a 10 gyr old population with [m/h]~-1.0. we explore relations toother streams and substructures, finding the stream cannot be identified withknown structures: it is a new, nearby substructure in the galaxy's halo. usinga simple dynamical model of a dissolving satellite galaxy we account for thelocalization of the stream. we find that the stream is dynamically young andtherefore likely the debris of a recently disrupted dwarf galaxy or globularcluster. the aquarius stream is thus a specimen of ongoing hierarchical galaxyformation, rare for being right in the solar suburb.

1103.0024	the population of milky way satellites in the lambdacdm cosmology	we present a model for the satellites of the milky way in which galaxyformation is followed using semi-analytic techniques applied to the sixhigh-resolution n-body simulations of galactic halos of the aquarius project.the model, calculated using the galform code, incorporates improved treatmentsof the relevant physics in the lambdacdm cosmogony, particularly aself-consistent calculation of reionization by uv photons emitted by theforming galaxy population, including the progenitors of the central galaxy.along the merger tree of each halo, the model calculates gas cooling (bycompton scattering off cosmic microwave background photons, molecular hydrogenand atomic processes), gas heating (from hydrogen photoionization and supernovaenergy), star formation and evolution. the evolution of the intergalacticmedium is followed simultaneously with that of the galaxies. star formation inthe more massive progenitor subhalos is suppressed primarily by supernovafeedback, while for smaller subhalos it is suppressed primarily byphotoionization due to external and internal sources. the model is constrainedto match a wide range of properties of the present day galaxy population as awhole, but at high redshift it requires an escape fraction of uv photons nearunity in order completely to reionize the universe by redshift z ~ 8. in themost successful model the local sources photoionize the pre-galactic regioncompletely by z ~ 10. in addition to the luminosity function of milky waysatellites, the model matches their observed luminosity-metallicity relation,their radial distribution and the inferred values of the mass within 300 pc,which in the models increase slowly but significantly with luminosity. there isa large variation in satellite properties from halo to halo, with theluminosity function, for example, varying by a factor of ~ 2 among the sixsimulations.

1104.1566	the shape of dark matter haloes in the aquarius simulations: evolution  and memory	we use the high resolution cosmological n-body simulations from the aquariusproject to investigate in detail the mechanisms that determine the shape ofmilky way-type dark matter haloes. we find that, when measured at theinstantaneous virial radius, the shape of individual haloes changes with time,evolving from a typically prolate configuration at early stages to a moretriaxial/oblate geometry at the present day. this evolution in halo shapecorrelates well with the distribution of the infalling material: prolateconfigurations arise when haloes are fed through narrow filaments, whichcharacterizes the early epochs of halo assembly, whereas triaxial/oblateconfigurations result as the accretion turns more isotropic at later times.interestingly, at redshift z=0, clear imprints of the past history of each haloare recorded in their shapes at different radii, which also exhibit a variationfrom prolate in the inner regions to triaxial/oblate in the outskirts. providedthat the aquarius haloes are fair representatives of milky way-like 10^12 msunobjects, we conclude that the shape of such dark matter haloes is a complex,time-dependent property, with each radial shell retaining memory of theconditions at the time of collapse.

1105.0425	clues to the "magellanic galaxy" from cosmological simulations	we use cosmological simulations from the aquarius project to study theorbital history of the large magellanic cloud (lmc) and its potentialassociation with other satellites of the milky way (mw). we search fordynamical analogs to the lmc and find a subhalo that matches the lmc positionand velocity at either of its two most recent pericentric passages. thissuggests that the lmc is not necessarily on its first approach to the mw,provided that the virial mass of the milky way is m_200 ~1.8e12 m_sun. thesimulation results yield specific predictions for the position and velocity ofsystems associated with the lmc prior to infall. if on first approach, mostshould lie close to the lmc because the galactic tidal field has not yet hadenough time to disperse them. if on second approach, the list of potentialassociates increases substantially. interestingly, our analysis rules out anlmc association for draco and ursa minor, two of the dwarf spheroidalssuggested by lynden-bell &amp; lynden-bell to form part of the "magellanic ghostlystream". our results also indicate that the direction of the orbital angularmomentum is a powerful test of lmc association. this test, however, requiresprecise proper motions, which are unavailable for most mw satellites. of the 4satellites with published proper motions, only the small magellanic cloud isclearly associated with the lmc. taken at face value, the proper motions ofcarina, fornax and sculptor rule them out as potential associates, but thisconclusion should be revisited when better data become available. the dearth ofsatellites clearly associated with the clouds might be solved by wide-fieldimaging surveys that target its surroundings, a region that may prove a fertilehunting ground for faint, previously unnoticed mw satellites.

1105.3691	observational properties of the metal-poor thick disk of the milky way  galaxy and insights into its origins	we have undertaken the study of the elemental abundances and kinematicproperties of a metal-poor sample of candidate thick-disk stars selected fromthe rave spectroscopic survey of bright stars to differentiate among thepresent scenarios of the formation of the thick disk. in this paper, we reporton a sample of 214 red giant branch, 31 red clump/horizontal branch, and 74main-sequence/sub-giant branch metal-poor stars, which serves to augment ourprevious sample of only giant stars. we find that the thick disk [alpha/fe]ratios are enhanced, and have little variation (&lt;0.1 dex), in agreement withour previous study. the augmented sample further allows, for the first time,investigation of the gradients in the metal-poor thick disk. for stars with[fe/h] &lt; -1.2, the thick disk shows very small gradients, &lt;0.03 +/- 0.02dex/kpc, in alpha-enhancement, while we find a +0.01 +/- 0.04 dex/kpc radialgradient and a -0.09 +/- 0.05 dex/kpc vertical gradient in iron abundance. inaddition, we show that the peak of the distribution of orbital eccentricitiesfor our sample agrees better with models in which the stars that comprise thethick disk were formed primarily in the galaxy, with direct accretion of starscontributing little. our results thus disfavor direct accretion of stars fromdwarf galaxies into the thick disk as a major contributor to the thick diskpopulation, but cannot discriminate between alternative models for the thickdisk, such as those that invoke high-redshift (gas-rich) mergers, heating of apre-existing thin stellar disk by a minor merger, or efficient radial migrationof stars.

1202.6061	not too big, not too small: the dark halos of the dwarf spheroidals in  the milky way	we present a new analysis of the aquarius simulations done in combinationwith a semi-analytic galaxy formation model. our goal is to establish whetherthe subhalos present in lcdm simulations of milky way-like systems could hostthe dwarf spheroidal (dsph) satellites of our galaxy. our analysis shows that,contrary to what has been assumed in most previous work, the mass profiles ofsubhalos are generally not well fit by nfw models but that einasto profiles arepreferred. we find that for shape parameters alpha = 0.2 - 0.5 and vmax = 10 -30 km/s there is very good correspondence with the observational constraintsobtained for the nine brightest dsph of the milky way. however, to explain theinternal dynamics of these systems as well as the number of objects of a givencircular velocity the total mass of the milky way should be ~ 8x10^11 msun, avalue that is in agreement with many recent determinations, and at the low massend of the range explored by the aquarius simulations. our simulations showimportant scatter in the number of bright satellites, even when the aquariusmilky way-like hosts are scaled to a common mass, and we find no evidence for amissing population of massive subhalos in the galaxy. this conclusion is alsosupported when we examine the dynamics of the satellites of m31.

0711.1105	the fine-grained phase-space structure of cold dark matter halos	we present a new and completely general technique for calculating thefine-grained phase-space structure of dark matter throughout the galactic halo.our goal is to understand this structure on the scales relevant for direct andindirect detection experiments. our method is based on evaluating the geodesicdeviation equation along the trajectories of individual dm particles. itrequires no assumptions about the symmetry or stationarity of the haloformation process. in this paper we study general static potentials whichexhibit more complex behaviour than the separable potentials studiedpreviously. for ellipsoidal logarithmic potentials with a core, phase mixing issensitive to the resonance structure, as indicated by the number of independentorbital frequencies. regions of chaotic mixing can be identified by the veryrapid decrease in the real space density of the associated dark matter streams.we also study the evolution of stream density in ellipsoidal nfw halos withradially varying isopotential shape, showing that if such a model is applied tothe galactic halo, at least $10^5$ streams are expected near the sun. the mostnovel aspect of our approach is that general non-static systems can be studiedthrough implementation in a cosmological n-body code. such an implementationallows a robust and accurate evaluation of the enhancements in annihilationradiation due to fine-scale structure such as caustics. we embed the scheme inthe current state-of-the-art code gadget-3 and present tests which demonstratethat n-body discreteness effects can be kept under control in realisticconfigurations.

1206.0020	the satellites of the milky way - insights from semi-analytic modelling  in a lambdacdm cosmology	we combine the six high-resolution aquarius dark matter simulations with asemi-analytic galaxy formation model to investigate the properties of thesatellites of milky way-like galaxies. we find good correspondence with theobserved luminosity function, luminosity-metallicity relation and radialdistribution of the milky way satellites. the star formation histories of thedwarf galaxies in our model vary widely, in accordance with what is seenobservationally. ram-pressure stripping of hot gas from the satellites leaves aclear imprint of the environment on the characteristics of a dwarf galaxy. wefind that the fraction of satellites dominated by old populations of starsmatches observations well. however, the internal metallicity distributions ofthe model satellites appear to be narrower than observed. this may indicatelimitations in our treatment of chemical enrichment, which is based on theinstantaneous recycling approximation. our model works best if the dark matterhalo of the milky way has a mass of ~8 x 10^11 msun, in agreement with thelower estimates from observations. the galaxy that resembles the milky way themost also has the best matching satellite luminosity function, although it doesnot contain an object as bright as the smc or lmc. compared to othersemi-analytic models and abundance matching relations we find that centralgalaxies reside in less massive haloes, but the halo mass-stellar mass relationin our model is consistent both with hydrodynamical simulations and with recentobservations.

1206.2359	dark satellites and the morphology of dwarf galaxies	one of the strongest predictions of the lambdacdm cosmological model is thepresence of dark satellites orbiting all types of galaxies. we focus here onthe dynamical effects of such satellites on disky dwarf galaxies, anddemonstrate that these encounters can be dramatic. although mergers with m_sat&gt; m_d are not very common, because of the lower baryonic content they occurmuch more frequently on the dwarf scale than for l_*-galaxies. as an example,we present a numerical simulation of a 20% (virial) mass ratio merger between adark satellite and a disky dwarf (akin to the fornax dwarf galaxy inluminosity) that shows that the merger remnant has a spheroidal morphology. weconclude that perturbations by dark satellites provide a plausible path for theformation of dsph systems and also could trigger starbursts in gas rich dwarfgalaxies. therefore the transition from disky to the often amorphous,irregular, or spheroidal morphologies of dwarfs could be a natural consequenceof the dynamical heating of hitherto unobservable dark satellites.

0711.2429	infall of substructures onto a milky way-like dark halo	we analyse the dynamical properties of substructures in a high-resolutiondark matter simulation of the formation of a milky way-like halo in a$\lambda$cdm cosmology. our goal is to shed light on the dynamicalpeculiarities of the milky way satellites. our simulations show that about 1/3of the subhalos have been accreted in groups. we quantify this clustering bymeasuring the alignment of the angular momentum of subhalos in a group. we findthat this signal is visible even for objects accreted up to $z \sim 1$, i.e. 8gyr ago, and long after the spatial coherence of the groups has been lost duethe host tidal field. this group infall may well explain the ghostly streamsproposed by lynden-bell &amp; lynden-bell to orbit the milky way. our analyses alsoshow that if most satellites originate in a few groups, the disk-likedistribution of the milky way satellites would be almost inevitable. thisnon-random assignment of satellites to subhalos implies an environmentaldependence on whether these low-mass objects are able to form stars, possiblyrelated to the nature of reionization in the early universe. with this picture,both the ``ghostly streams'' and the ``disk-like configuration'' aremanifestations of the same phenomenon: the hierarchical growth of structuredown to the smallest scales.

1211.4522	an analytical phase-space model for tidal caustics	the class of tidal features around galaxies known variously as "shells" or"umbrellas" comprises debris that has arisen from high-mass-ratio mergers withlow impact parameter; the nearly radial orbits of the debris give rise to aunique morphology, a universal density profile, and a tight correlation betweenpositions and velocities of the material. as such they are accessible toanalytical treatment, and can provide a relatively clean system for probing thegravitational potential of the host galaxy. in this work we present a simpleanalytical model that describes the density profile, phase-space distribution,and geometry of a shell, and whose parameters are directly related to physicalcharacteristics of the interacting galaxies. the model makes three assumptions:that their orbit is radial, that the potential of the host is spherical at theshell radii, and that the satellite galaxy had a maxwellian velocitydistribution. we quantify the error introduced by the first two assumptions andshow that selecting shells by their appearance on the sky is a sufficient basisto assume that these simplifications are valid. we further demonstrate that (1)given only an image of a shell, the radial gravitational force at the shelledge and the phase-space density of the satellite are jointly constrained, (2)that combining the image with measurements of either point line-of-sightvelocities or integrated spectra will yield an independent estimate of thegravitational force at a shell, and (3) that an independent measurement of thisforce is obtained for each shell observed around a given galaxy, potentiallyenabling a determination of the galactic mass distribution.

0801.1127	the unorthodox orbits of substructure halos	(abridged) we use cosmological n-body simulations to study the properties ofsubstructure halos in galaxy-sized dark matter halos. we extend prior work onthe subject by considering the whole population of subhalos physicallyassociated with the main system. these are defined as subhalos that have atsome time in the past been within the virial radius of the halo's mainprogenitor and that have survived as self-bound entities to $z=0$. we find thatthis population extends beyond {\it three times} the virial radius, andcontains objects on extreme orbits. we trace the origin of these unorthodoxorbits to the tidal dissociation of bound groups of subhalos, which results inthe ejection of some subhalos along tidal streams. ejected subhalos areprimarily low-mass systems, leading to mass-dependent biases in their spatialdistribution and kinematics: the lower the subhalo mass at accretion time, theless centrally concentrated and kinematically hotter their descendantpopulation. the bias is strongest amongst the most massive subhalos, butdisappears at the low-mass end. our findings imply that subhalos identifiedwithin the virial radius represent an incomplete census of the substructurephysically related to a halo: only about {\it one half} of all associatedsubhalos are found today within the virial radius of a halo. these results mayexplain the age dependence of the clustering of low-mass halos, and hasimplications for (i) the interpretation of the structural parameters andassembly histories of halos neighboring massive systems; (ii) the existence oflow-mass dynamical outliers in the local group; and (iii) the presence ofevidence for evolutionary effects well outside the traditional virial boundaryof a galaxy system.

1306.2632	3d test particle simulations of the galactic disks. the kinematical  effects of the bar	aims: to study the imprints of a rotating bar on the kinematics of stars inthe thin and thick disks throughout the galaxy. methods: we perform testparticle numerical simulations of the thin and thick disks in a 3d galacticpotential that includes a halo, a bulge, thin and thick disks, and a ferrersbar. we analyze the resulting velocity distributions of populationscorresponding to both disks, for different positions in the galaxy and fordifferent structural parameters of the bar. results: we find that the velocitydistributions of the disks are affected by the bar, and that strong transienteffects are present for approximately 10 bar rotations after this is introducedadiabatically. on long (more realistic) timescales, the effects of the bar arestrong on the kinematics of thin disk stars, and weaker on those in the thickdisk, but in any case significant. furthermore, we find that it is possible totrace the imprints of the bar also vertically and at least up to z ~ 1 kpc forthe thin disk and z ~ 2 kpc for the thick disk.

1307.0008	streams in the aquarius stellar haloes	we use the very high resolution, fully cosmological simulations from theaquarius project, coupled to a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation, tostudy the phase-space distribution of halo stars in "solar neighbourhood"-likevolumes. we find that this distribution is very rich in substructure in theform of stellar streams for all five stellar haloes we have analysed. thesestreams can be easily identified in velocity space, as well as in spaces ofpseudo-conserved quantities such as e vs. lz. in our best-resolved localvolumes, the number of identified streams ranges from ~ 300 to 600, in verygood agreement with previous analytical predictions, even in the presence ofchaotic mixing. the fraction of particles linked to (massive) stellar streamsin these volumes can be as large as 84%. the number of identified streams isfound to decrease as a power-law with galactocentric radius. we show that thestrongest limitation to the quantification of substructure in ourpoorest-resolved local volumes is particle resolution rather than strongdiffusion due to chaotic mixing.

1309.4270	new distances to rave stars	probability density functions are determined from new stellar parameters forthe distance moduli of stars for which the radial velocity experiment (rave)has obtained spectra with s/n&gt;=10. single-gaussian fits to the pdf in distancemodulus suffice for roughly half the stars, with most of the other half havingsatisfactory two-gaussian representations. as expected, early-type stars rarelyrequire more than one gaussian. the expectation value of distance is largerthan the distance implied by the expectation of distance modulus; the latter isitself larger than the distance implied by the expectation value of theparallax. our parallaxes of hipparcos stars agree well with the values measuredby hipparcos, so the expectation of parallax is the most reliable distanceindicator. the latter are improved by taking extinction into account. theeffective temperature absolute-magnitude diagram of our stars is significantlyimproved when these pdfs are used to make the diagram. we use the method ofkinematic corrections devised by schoenrich, binney &amp; asplund to check forsystematic errors for general stars and confirm that the most reliable distanceindicator is the expectation of parallax. for cool dwarfs and low-gravitygiants &lt;pi&gt; tends to be larger than the true distance by up to 30 percent. themost satisfactory distances are for dwarfs hotter than 5500 k. we compare ourdistances to stars in 13 open clusters with cluster distances from theliterature and find excellent agreement for the dwarfs and indications that weare over-estimating distances to giants, especially in young clusters.

1309.4285	galactic kinematics and dynamics from rave stars	we analyse the kinematics of ~400000 rave stars. we split the sample into hotand cold dwarfs, red-clump and non-clump giants. the kinematics of the clumpgiants are consistent with being identical with those of non-clump giants. wefit gaussian velocity ellipsoids to the meridional-plane components of velocityof each star class and give formulae from which the shape and orientation ofthe velocity ellipsoid can be determined at any location. the data areconsistent with the giants and the cool dwarfs sharing the same velocityellipsoids; sigma_z rises from 21 kms in the plane to sim 55 kms at |z|=2 kpc,while sigma_r rises from 37 kms to 82 kms. at (r,z) the longest axis of one ofthese velocity ellipsoids is inclined to the galactic plane by an angle ~0.8arctan(z/r). we use a novel formula to obtain precise fits to the highlynon-gaussian distributions of v_phi components.  we compare the observed velocity distributions with the predictions of adynamical model fitted to the velocities of stars that lie within ~150 pc ofthe sun and star counts towards the galactic pole. the model accuratelyreproduces the non-gaussian nature of the v_r and v_z distributions andprovides excellent fits to the data for v_z at all locations. the model v_phidistributions for the cool dwarfs fit the data extremely well, while those forthe hot dwarfs have displacements to low v_phi that grow with |z| from verysmall values near the plane. at |z|&gt;0.5 kpc, the theoretical v_phidistributions for giants show a deficit of stars with large v_phi and the modelv_r distributions are too narrow. systematically over-estimating distances by20 per cent introduces asymmetry into the model v_r and v_z distributions nearthe plane and but significantly improves the fits to the data at |z|&gt;0.5 kpc.the quality of the fits lends credence to the assumed, disc-dominated,gravitational potential.

1402.0903	the shape of dark matter subhalos in the aquarius simulations	we analyze the aquarius simulations to characterize the shape of dark matterhalos with peak circular velocity in the range 8&lt;vmax&lt;200 km/s, and perform aconvergence study using the various aquarius resolution levels. for theconverged objects, we determine the principal axis (a&lt;b&lt;c) of the normalizedinertia tensor as a function of radius. we find that the triaxiality of fieldhalos is an increasing function of halo mass, so that the smallest halos in oursample are ~40-50% rounder than milky way-like objects at the radius where thecircular velocity peaks, rmax. we find that the distribution of subhalo axisratios is consistent with that of field halos of comparable vmax. inner andouter contours within each object are well aligned, with the major axispreferentially pointing in the radial direction for subhalos closest to thecenter of their host halo. we also analyze the dynamical structure of subhaloslikely to host luminous satellites comparable to the classical dwarfspheroidals in the local group. these halos have axis ratios that increase withradius, and which are mildly triaxial with &lt;b/a&gt;~0.75 and &lt;c/a&gt;~0.60 at r~1kpc. their velocity ellipsoid become strongly tangentially biased in theoutskirts as a consequence of tidal stripping.

1402.4479	the galactic bar and the large scale velocity gradients in the galactic  disk	aims: we investigate whether the cylindrical (galactocentric) radial velocitygradient of ~ -3 km/s/kpc, directed radially from the galactic center andrecently observed in the stars of the solar neighborhood with the rave survey,can be explained by the resonant effects of the bar near the solarneighborhood.  methods: we compared the results of test particle simulations of the milkyway with a potential that includes a rotating bar with observations from therave survey. to this end we applied the rave selection function to thesimulations and convolved these with the characteristic rave errors. weexplored different "solar neighborhoods" in the simulations, as well asdifferent bar models  results: we find that the bar induces a negative radial velocity gradient atevery height from the galactic plane, outside the outer lindblad resonance andfor angles from the long axis of the bar compatible with the current estimates.the selection function and errors do not wash away the gradient, but often makeit steeper, especially near the galactic plane, because this is where the ravesurvey is less radially extended. no gradient in the vertical velocityispresent in our simulations, from which we may conclude that this cannot beinduced by the bar.

1404.6534	action-space clustering of tidal streams to infer the galactic potential	we present a new method for constraining the milky way halo gravitationalpotential by simultaneously fitting multiple tidal streams. this methodrequires full three-dimensional positions and velocities for all stars to befit, but does not require identification of any specific stream ordetermination of stream membership for any star. we exploit the principle thatthe action distribution of stream stars is most clustered when the potentialused to calculate the actions is closest to the true potential. clustering isquantified with the kullback-leibler divergence (kld), which also providesconditional uncertainties for our parameter estimates. we show, for toygaia-like data in a spherical isochrone potential, that maximizing the kld ofthe action distribution relative to a smoother distribution recovers the truevalues of the potential parameters. the precision depends on the observationalerrors and the number of streams in the sample; using kiii giants as tracers,we measure the enclosed mass at the average radius of the sample stars accurateto 3% and precise to 20-40%. recovery of the scale radius is precise to 25%,and is biased 50% high by the small galactocentric distance range of stars inour mock sample (1-25 kpc, or about three scale radii, with mean 6.5 kpc).about 15 streams, with at least 100 stars per stream, are needed to obtainupper and lower bounds on the enclosed mass and scale radius when observationalerrors are taken into account; 20-25 streams are required to stabilize the sizeof the confidence interval. if radial velocities are provided for stars out to100 kpc (10 scale radii), all parameters can be determined with 10% accuracyand 20% precision (1.3% accuracy in the case of the enclosed mass), underliningthe need for ground-based spectroscopic follow-up to complete the radialvelocity catalog for faint halo stars observed by gaia.

1407.2405	binary white dwarfs in the halo of the milky way	aims: we study single and binary white dwarfs in the inner halo of the milkyway in order to learn more about the conditions under which the population ofhalo stars was born, such as the initial mass function (imf), the starformation history, or the binary fraction. methods: we simulate the evolutionof low-metallicity halo stars at distances up to ~ 3 kpc using the binarypopulation synthesis code seba. we use two different white dwarf cooling modelsto predict the present-day luminosities of halo white dwarfs. we determine thewhite dwarf luminosity functions (wdlfs) for eight different halo models andcompare these with the observed halo wdlf of white dwarfs in the supercosmossky survey. furthermore, we predict the properties of binary white dwarfs inthe halo and determine the number of halo white dwarfs that is expected to beobserved with the gaia satellite. results: by comparing the wdlfs, we find thata standard imf matches the observations more accurately than a top-heavy one,but the difference with a bottom-heavy imf is small. a burst of star formation13 gyr ago fits slightly better than a star formation burst 10 gyr ago and alsoslightly better than continuous star formation $10-13$ gyrs ago. gaia will bethe first instrument to constrain the bright end of the field halo wdlf, wherecontributions from binary wds are considerable. many of these will have hecores, of which a handful have atypical surface gravities ($\log g &lt; 6$) andreach luminosities $\log(l/l_\odot) &gt; 0$ in our standard model for wd cooling.these so called pre-wds, if observed, can help us to constrain white dwarfcooling models and might teach us something about the fraction of halo starsthat reside in binaries.

1407.2533	more pieces of the puzzle: chemistry and substructures in the galactic  thick disk	we present a study of the chemical abundances of solar neighbourhood starsassociated to dynamical structures in the milky way's (thick) disk. these starswere identified as overdensity in the eccentricity range 0.3&lt; ecc &lt; 0.5 in thecopenhagen-geneva survey by helmi et al. (2006). we find that the stars withthese dynamical characteristics do not constitute a homogeneous population. arelatively sharp transition in dynamical and chemical properties appears tooccur at a metallicity of [fe/h] ~ -0.4. stars with [fe/h] &gt; -0.4 have mostlylower eccentricities, smaller vertical velocity dispersions, are alpha-enhancedand define a rather narrow sequence in [alpha/fe] vs [fe/h], clearly distinctfrom that of the thin disk. stars with [fe/h] &lt; -0.4 have a range ofeccentricities, are hotter vertically, and depict a larger spread in[alpha/fe]. we have also found tentative evidence of substructure possiblyassociated to the disruption of a metal-rich star cluster. the differencesbetween these populations of stars is also present in e.g. [zn/fe], [ni/fe] and[smii/fe], suggesting a real physical distinction.

0803.2323	simulations of minor mergers. i. general properties of thick disks	we present simulations of the formation of thick disks via the accretion oftwo-component satellites onto a pre-existing thin disk. our goal is toestablish the detailed characteristics of the thick disks obtained in this way,as well as their dependence on the initial orbital and internal properties ofthe accreted objects. we find that mergers with 10-20% mass of the mass of thehost lead to the formation of thick disks whose characteristics are similar,both in morphology as in kinematics, to those observed. despite the relativelylarge mass ratios, the host disks are not fully destroyed by the infallingsatellites: a remaining kinematically cold and thin component containing~15-25% of the mass can be identified, which is embedded in a hotter andthicker disk. this may for example, explain the existence of a very old thindisk stars in the milky way. the final scale-heights of the disks depend bothon the initial inclination and properties of the merger, but the fraction ofsatellite stellar particles at ~4 scale-heights directly measures the massratio between the satellite and host galaxy. our thick disks typically showboxy isophotes at very low surface brightness levels (&gt;6 magnitudes below theirpeak value). kinematically, the velocity ellipsoids of the simulated thickdisks are similar to that of the galactic thick disk at the solar radius. thetrend of sigma_z/sigma_r with radius is found to be a very good discriminant ofthe initial inclination of the accreted satellite. in the milky way, thepossible existence of a vertical gradient in the rotational velocity of thethick disk as well as the observed value of sigma_z/sigma_r at the solarvicinity appear to favour the formation of the thick disk by a merger witheither low or intermediate orbital inclination.

1407.7867	elemental abundances in milky way-like galaxies from a hierarchical  galaxy formation model	we develop a new method to account for the finite lifetimes of stars andtrace individual abundances within a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation.at variance with previous methods, based on the storage of the (binned) paststar formation history of model galaxies, our method projects the informationabout the metals produced by each simple stellar population (ssp) in thefuture. using this approach, an accurate accounting of the timings andproperties of the individual ssps composing model galaxies is possible. weanalyse the dependence of our chemical model on various ingredients, and applyit to six simulated haloes of roughly milky way mass and with no massive closeneighbour at z=0. for all models considered, the [fe/h] distributions of thestars in the disc component are in good agreement with milky way data, whilefor the spheroid component (whose formation we model only through mergers)these are offset low with respect to observational measurements for the milkyway bulge. this is a consequence of narrow star formation histories, withrelatively low rates of star formation. the slow recycling of gas and energyfrom supernovae in our chemical model has important consequences on thepredicted star formation rates, which are systematically lower than thecorresponding rates in the same physical model but with an instantaneousrecycling approximation. the halo that resembles most our galaxy in terms ofits global properties also reproduces the observed relation between the averagemetallicity and luminosity of the milky way satellites, albeit with a slightlysteeper slope.

1411.1421	dark influences: imprints of dark satellites on dwarf galaxies	in the context of the current $\lambda$cdm cosmological model small darkmatter haloes are abundant and satellites of dwarf galaxies are expected to bepredominantly dark. since low mass galaxies have smaller baryon fractionsinteractions with these satellites may leave particularly dramatic imprints. weuncover the influence of the most massive of these dark satellites on diskydwarf galaxies and the possible dynamical and morphological transformationsthat result from these interactions. we use a suite of carefully set-up,controlled simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies. the primary dwarf galaxieshave solely a stellar disk in the dark matter halo and the secundaries arecompletely devoid of baryons. we vary the disk mass, halo concentration,initial disk thickness and inclination of the satellite orbit. the disky dwarfgalaxies are heated and disrupted due to the minor merger event, more extremelyfor higher satellite over disk mass ratios, and the morphology and kinematicsare significantly altered. moreover, for less concentrated haloes the minormerger can completely destroy the disk leaving a low-luminosity spheroidal-likegalaxy instead. we conclude that dwarf galaxies are very much susceptible tobeing disturbed by dark galaxies and that even a minor merger event cansignificantly disrupt and alter the structure and kinematics of a dwarf galaxy.this process may be seen as a new channel for the formation of dwarf spheroidalgalaxies.

0804.2465	the galaxy and its stellar halo: insights on their formation from a  hybrid cosmological approach	we use a series of high-resolution simulations of a `milky-way' halo coupledto semi-analytic methods to study the formation of our own galaxy and of itsstellar halo. the physical properties of our model milky way, as well as theage and metallicity distribution of stars in the different components, are inrelatively good agreement with observational measurements. assuming that thestellar halo builds up from the cores of the satellite galaxies that mergedwith the milky way over its life-time, we are able to study the physical andstructural properties of this component. in agreement with previous work, wefind that the largest contribution to the stellar halo should come from a fewrelatively massive (10^8 - 10^10 msun) satellites, accreted at early times. our"stellar halo" does not exhibit any clear metallicity gradient, but highermetallicity stars are more centrally concentrated than stars of lowerabundance. this indicates that the probability of observing low-metallicityhalo stars increases with distance from the galactic centre. we find that theproposed "dual" nature of the galactic stellar halo can be explained in ourmodel as a result of a mass-metallicity relation imprinted in the buildingblocks of this component.

1504.00008	the evolution of streams in a time-dependent potential	we study the evolution of streams in a time-dependent spherical gravitationalpotential. our goal is to establish what are the imprints of this timeevolution on the properties of streams as well as their observability. to thisend, we have performed a suite of numerical experiments for a host system thatdoubles its mass during the integration time and for a variety of initialconditions. in these experiments we found that the most striking imprint is amisalignment of 10 degrees in the angular location of the apocentres of thestreams compared to the static case (and to the orbit of the centre of mass),which only becomes apparent for sufficiently long streams. we have alsodeveloped an analytic model using action-angle variables which allows us toexplain this behaviour and to identify the most important signature of timeevolution, namely a difference in the slope defined by the distribution ofparticles along a stream in frequency and in angle space. although a differencein slope can arise when the present-day potential is not correctly modelled,this shortcoming can be by-passed because in this case, streams are no longerstraight lines in angle space, but depict a wiggly appearance and animplausible energy gradient. the difference in slope due to time-evolution issmall, typically $\sim10^{-2}$ and its amplitude depends on the growth rate ofthe potential, but nonetheless we find that it could be observable if accuratefull-space information for nearby long streams is available.

1507.03995	matching the dark matter profiles of dsph galaxies with those of  simulated satellites: a two parameter comparison	we compare the dark matter halos' structural parameters derived for fourmilky way dwarf spheroidal galaxies to those of subhalos found in cosmological$n$-body simulations. we confirm that estimates of the mass at a single fixedradius are fully consistent with the observations. however, when a secondstructural parameter such as the logarithmic slope of the dark halo densityprofile measured close to the half-light radius is included in the comparison,we find little to no overlap between the satellites and the subhalos. typicallythe right mass subhalos have steeper profiles at these radii than measurementsof the dsph suggest. using energy arguments we explore if it is possible tosolve this discrepancy by invoking baryonic effects. assuming that feedbackfrom supernovae can lead to a reshaping of the halos, we compute the requiredefficiency and find entirely plausible values for a significant fraction of thesubhalos and even as low as 0.1%. this implies that care must be taken not toexaggerate the effect of supernovae feedback as this could make the halos tooshallow. these results could be used to calibrate and possibly constrainfeedback recipes in hydrodynamical simulations.

1508.06281	dark influences ii: gas and star formation in minor mergers of dwarf  galaxies with dark satellites	it has been proposed that mergers induce starbursts and lead to importantmorphological changes in galaxies. most studies so far have focused on largegalaxies, but dwarfs might also experience such events, since the halo massfunction is scale-free in the concordance cosmological model. notably, becauseof their low mass, most of their interactions will be with dark satellites. inthis paper we follow the evolution of gas-rich disky dwarf galaxies as theyexperience a minor merger with a dark satellite. we aim to characterize theeffects of such an interaction on the dwarf's star formation, morphology, andkinematical properties. we performed a suite of carefully set-up hydrodynamicalsimulations of dwarf galaxies that include dark matter, gas, and stars mergingwith a satellite consisting solely of dark matter. for the host system we varythe gas fraction, disk size and thickness, halo mass, and concentration, whilewe explore different masses, concentrations, and orbits for the satellite. wefind that the interactions cause strong starbursts of both short and longduration in the dwarfs. their star formation rates increase by factors of a fewto 10 or more. they are strongest for systems with extended gas disks and highgas fractions merging with a high-concentration satellite on a planar, radialorbit. in contrast to analogous simulations of milky way-mass galaxies, many ofthe systems experience strong morphological changes and become spheroidal evenin the presence of significant amounts of gas. the simulated systems compareremarkably well with the observational properties of a large selection ofirregular dwarf galaxies and blue compact dwarfs. this implies that mergerswith dark satellites might well be happening but not be fully evident, and maythus play a role in the diversity of the dwarf galaxy population.

1601.00020	dark influences iii. structural characterization of minor mergers of  dwarf galaxies with dark satellites	in the current concordance cosmology small halos are expected to becompletely dark and can significantly perturb low-mass galaxies during minormerger interactions. these interactions may well contribute to the diversity ofthe dwarf galaxy population. dwarf galaxies in the field are often observed tohave peculiarities in their structure, morphology, and kinematics as well asstrong bursts of star formation without apparent cause. we aim to characterizethe signatures of minor mergers of dwarf galaxies with dark satellites to aidtheir observational identification. we explore and quantify a variety ofstructural, morphological, and kinematic indicators of merging dwarf galaxiesand their remnants using a suite of hydrodynamical simulations. the mostsensitive indicators of mergers with dark satellites are large asymmetries inthe gaseous and stellar distributions, enhanced central surface brightness andstarbursts, and velocity offsets and misalignments between the cold gas andstellar components. in general merging systems span a wide range of values ofthe most commonly used indicators, while isolated objects tend to have moreconfined values. interestingly, we find in our simulations that a significantlyoff-centered burst of star formation can pinpoint the location of the darksatellite. observational systems with such characteristics are perhaps the mostpromising for unveiling the presence of the hitherto, missing satellites.

0807.2780	group infall of substructures on to a milky way-like dark halo	we report the discovery that substructures/subhaloes of a galaxy-size halotend to fall in together in groups in cosmological simulations, something thatmay explain the oddity of the mw satellite distribution. the originalclustering at the time of infall is still discernible in the angular momenta ofthe subhaloes even for events which took place up to eight gyrs ago, $z \sim1$. this phenomenon appears to be rather common since at least 1/3 of thepresent-day subhaloes have fallen in groups in our simulations. hence, this maywell explain the lynden-bell &amp; lynden-bell ghostly streams. we have also foundthat the probability of building up a flattened distribution similar to the mwsatellites is as high as $\sim 80%$ if the mw satellites were from only onegroup and $\sim 20%$ when five groups are involved. therefore, we conclude thatthe `peculiar' distribution of satellites around the mw can be expected withthe cdm structure formation theory. this non-random assignment of satellites tosubhaloes implies an environmental dependence on whether these low-mass objectsare able to form stars, possibly related to the nature of reionization in theearly universe.

astro-ph;0007166	mapping the substructure in the galactic halo with the next generation  of astrometric satellites	we run numerical simulations of the disruption of satellite galaxies in agalactic potential to build up the entire stellar halo, in order to investigatewhat the next generation of astrometric satellites will reveal by observing thehalo of the milky way. we generate artificial diva, fame and gaia halocatalogues, in which we look for the signatures left by the accretedsatellites. we develop a method based on the standard friends-of-friendsalgorithm applied to the space of integrals of motion. we find this simplemethod can recover about 50% of the different accretion events, when theobservational uncertainties expected for gaia are taken into account, even whenthe exact form of the galactic potential is unknown. the recovery rate for divaand fame is much smaller, but these missions, like gaia, should be able to testthe hierarchical formation paradigm on our galaxy by measuring the amount ofhalo substructure in the form of nearby kinematically cold streams with forexample, a two-point correlation function in velocity space.

astro-ph;0201289	the phase-space structure of a dark-matter halo: implications for  dark-matter direct detection experiments	we study the phase-space structure of a dark-matter halo formed in a highresolution simulation of a lambda cdm cosmology. our goal is to quantify howmuch substructure is left over from the inhomogeneous growth of the halo, andhow it may affect the signal in experiments aimed at detecting the dark matterparticles directly. if we focus on the equivalent of ``solar vicinity'', wefind that the dark-matter is smoothly distributed in space. the probability ofdetecting particles bound within dense lumps of individual mass less than 10^7m_\sun h^{-1} is small, less than 10^{-2}. the velocity ellipsoid in the solarneighbourhood deviates only slightly from a multivariate gaussian, and can bethought of as a superposition of thousands of kinematically cold streams. themotions of the most energetic particles are, however, strongly clumped andhighly anisotropic. we conclude that experiments may safely assume a smoothmultivariate gaussian distribution to represent the kinematics of dark-matterparticles in the solar neighbourhood. experiments sensitive to the direction ofmotion of the incident particles could exploit the expected anisotropy to learnabout the recent merging history of our galaxy.

astro-ph;0208041	the phase-space structure of cold dark-matter halos: insights into the  galactic halo	we study the formation of the milky way's halo in a $\lambda$cdm cosmology byscaling down a high resolution simulation of the formation of a cluster ofgalaxies. we determine how much phase-space substructure is left over from theobjects that merge to build up the present galaxy. we study the debris streamsoriginating from such objects and find that their evolution can be explainedsimply in terms of the conservation of phase-space density. analysing the massgrowth history of our halo we find that its inner regions have been in placefor more than 10 gyr, but that the growth of the halo as a whole is moregradual, in agreement with other high resolution simulations of dark-matterhalos. recent accretion contributes to the inner 10 kpc of the halo only at the10$^{-4}$ level. finally we determine the number of dark-matter streams as afunction of distance from the centre of the halo. in the equivalent of the``solar vicinity'', we find that the dark-matter is smoothly distributed inspace, and that the velocity ellipsoid is formed by hundreds of thousands ofstreams, most of which have velocity dispersions of the order of 1 km/s orless.

astro-ph;0303305	on the nature of the ring-like structure in the outer galactic disk	we examine the tidal disruption of satellite galaxies in a cosmologicalsimulation of the formation of a disk galaxy in the $\lambda$cdm scenario. wefind that the disruption of satellite galaxies in orbits roughly coplanar withthe disk leads naturally to the formation of ring-like stellar structuressimilar to that recently discovered in the outer disk of the milky way. twointerpretations appear plausible in this context. one is that the ring is atransitory, localized radial density enhancement reflecting the apocenter ofparticles stripped from a satellite during a recent pericentric passage (a``tidal arc'' reminiscent of the tidal arms seen in disk galaxy mergers). inthe second scenario, the ring is analogous to the ``shells'' found around someelliptical galaxies, and would result from a minor merger that took placeseveral gyr ago. the two interpretations differ in several ways. tidal arcs areexpected to span a limited longitude range; may carry a substantial fraction ofthe original mass of the satellite; should exhibit a significant velocitygradient with galactic longitude; and are in all likelihood asymmetric aboveand below the plane of the disk. shells, on the other hand, may comprise atmost a small fraction of the original mass of the satellite and, due to theirmore relaxed state, ought to be symmetric above and below the plane, with nodiscernible velocity gradients across the structure. if confirmed as a tidalfeature, the ring discovered by sdss in the outer galactic disk wouldstrengthen the view--supported by numerical simulations--that minor mergershave played a significant role building up not only the stellar halo, but alsothe disk components of the galaxy.

astro-ph;0311107	the extragalactic origin of the arcturus group	we reanalyze the group of stars associated kinematically with arcturus (eggen1971), and confirm that they constitute a peculiar grouping of metal-poor starswith similar apocentric radius, common angular momentum, and distinct metalabundance patterns. these properties are consistent with those expected for agroup of stars originating from the debris of a disrupted satellite. thearcturus group stands out clearly in the catalog of beers et al. (2000) as wellas in other compilations of metal-poor stars in the solar neighborhood. itsangular momentum appears too low to arise from dynamical perturbations inducedby the galactic bar, and coincides with that of the kinematically-peculiarpopulation of stars identified above and below the galactic plane by gilmore,wyse &amp; norris (2002): the arcturus group is in all likelihood the solarneighborhood extension of such population. further analysis is needed toconfirm our proposal that arcturus, together with some of the brightest starsin the night sky, may have formed beyond the confines of the galaxy. however,validating the extragalactic origin of the arcturus group would lend support tothe prevalence of accretion events envisioned in hierarchical models of galaxyformation, and would suggest that early mergers may have contributed asubstantial fraction of the old and metal-deficient stars in the galactic disk.

astro-ph;0505401	pieces of the puzzle: ancient substructure in the galactic disk	we search for signatures of past accretion events in the milky way in therecently published catalogue by nordstrom et al.(2004), containing accuratespatial and kinematic information as well as metallicities for 13240 nearbystars. to optimize our strategy, we use numerical simulations to characterizethe properties of the debris from disrupted satellites. we find that stars witha common progenitor should show distinct correlations between their orbitalparameters; in particular, between the apocentre a and pericentre p, as well astheir z-angular momentum (l_z). in the apl-space, such stars are expected tocluster around regions of roughly constant eccentricity.  the apl space for the nordstrom catalogue exhibits a wealth of substructure,much of which can be linked to dynamical perturbations induced by spiral armsand the galactic bar. however, our analysis also reveals a statisticallysignificant excess of stars on orbits of common (moderate) eccentricity,analogous to the pattern expected for merger debris. besides being dynamicallypeculiar, the 274 stars in these substructures have very distinct metallicityand age distributions, providing further evidence of their extra-galacticprovenance. it is possible to identify among these stars, three coherent groupswith characteristic ages and metallicities, that, in all likelihood, correspondto the remains of disrupted satellites.

0809.0894	a blueprint for detecting supersymmetric dark matter in the galactic  halo	dark matter is the dominant form of matter in the universe, but its nature isunknown. it is plausibly an elementary particle, perhaps the lightestsupersymmetric partner of known particle species. in this case, annihilation ofdark matter in the halo of the milky way should produce gamma-rays at a levelwhich may soon be observable. previous work has argued that the annihilationsignal will be dominated by emission from very small clumps (perhaps smallereven than the earth) which would be most easily detected where they clustertogether in the dark matter halos of dwarf satellite galaxies. here we show,using the largest ever simulation of the formation of a galactic halo, thatsuch small-scale structure will, in fact, have a negligible impact on darkmatter detectability. rather, the dominant and likely most easily detectablesignal will be produced by diffuse dark matter in the main halo of the milkyway. if the main halo is strongly detected, then small dark matter clumpsshould also be visible, but may well contain no stars, thereby confirming a keyprediction of the cold dark matter (cdm) model.

0809.0898	the aquarius project: the subhalos of galactic halos	we have performed the largest ever particle simulation of a milky way-sizeddark matter halo, and present the most comprehensive convergence study for anindividual dark matter halo carried out thus far. we have also simulated asample of 6 ultra-highly resolved milky-way sized halos, allowing us toestimate the halo-to-halo scatter in substructure statistics. in our largestsimulation, we resolve nearly 300,000 gravitationally bound subhalos within thevirialized region of the halo. simulations of the same object differing in massresolution by factors up to 1800 accurately reproduce the largest subhalos withthe same mass, maximum circular velocity and position, and yield goodconvergence for the abundance and internal properties of dark mattersubstructures. we detect up to four generations of subhalos within subhalos,but contrary to recent claims, we find less substructure in subhalos than inthe main halo when regions of equal mean overdensity are compared. the overallsubstructure mass fraction is much lower in subhalos than in the main halo.extrapolating the main halo's subhalo mass spectrum down to an earth mass, wepredict the mass fraction in substructure to be well below 3% within 100 kpc,and to be below 0.1% within the solar circle. the inner density profiles ofsubhalos show no sign of converging to a fixed asymptotic slope and are wellfit by gently curving profiles of einasto form. the mean concentrations ofisolated halos are accurately described by the fitting formula of neto et al.down to maximum circular velocities of 1.5 km/s, an extrapolation over some 5orders of magnitude in mass. however, at equal maximum circular velocity,subhalos are more concentrated than field halos, with a characteristic densitythat is typically ~2.6 times larger and increases towards the halo centre.

astro-ph;0611420	a new view of the dwarf spheroidal satellites of the milky way from  vlt/flames: where are the very metal poor stars?	as part of the dwarf galaxies abundances and radial-velocities team (dart)program, we have measured the metallicities of a large sample of stars in fournearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dsph's): sculptor, sextans, fornax, andcarina. the low mean metal abundances and the presence of very old stellarpopulations in these galaxies have supported the view that they are fossilsfrom the early universe. however, contrary to naive expectations, we find asignificant lack of stars with metallicities below [fe/h] ~ -3 dex in all foursystems. this suggests that the gas that made up the stars in these systems hadbeen uniformly enriched prior to their formation. furthermore, the metal-poortail of the dsph metallicity distribution is significantly different from thatof the galactic halo. these findings show that the progenitors of nearby dsph'sappear to have been fundamentally different from the building blocks of themilky way, even at the earliest epochs.

astro-ph;9901102	building up the stellar halo of the galaxy	we study numerical simulations of satellite galaxy disruption in a potentialresembling that of the milky way. our goal is to assess whether a merger originfor the stellar halo would leave observable fossil structure in the phase-spacedistribution of nearby stars. we show how mixing of disrupted satellites can bequantified using a coarse-grained entropy. although after 10 gyr few obviousasymmetries remain in the distribution of particles in configuration space,strong correlations are still present in velocity space. we give a simpleanalytic description of these effects, based on a linearised treatment inaction-angle variables, which shows how the kinematic and density structure ofthe debris stream changes with time. by applying this description we find thata single satellite of current luminosity $10^8 l_\sun$ disrupted 10 gyr agofrom an orbit circulating in the inner halo (mean apocentre $\sim 12$ kpc)would contribute about $\sim 30$ kinematically cold streams with internalvelocity dispersions below 5 km/s to the local stellar halo. if the wholestellar halo were built by disrupted satellites, it should consist locally of300 - 500 such streams. clear detection of all these structures would require asample of a few thousand stars with 3-d velocities accurate to better than 5km/s. even with velocity errors several times worse than this, the expectedclumpiness should be quite evident. we apply our formalism to a group of starsdetected near the north galactic pole, and derive an order of magnitudeestimate for the initial properties of the progenitor system.

astro-ph;9911041	debris streams in the solar neighbourhood as relicts from the formation  of the milky way	it is now generally believed that galaxies were built up throughgravitational amplification of primordial fluctuations and the subsequentmerging of smaller precursor structures. the stars of the structures thatassembled to form the milky way should now make up much or all of its bulge andhalo, in which case one hopes to find "fossil" evidence for those precursorstructures in the present distribution of halo stars. confirmation that thisprocess is continuing came with the discovery of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy,which is being disrupted by the milky way, but direct evidence that thisprocess provided the bulk of the milky way's population of old stars has so farbeen lacking. here we show that about ten per cent of the metal--poor stars inthe halo of the milky way, outside the radius of the sun's orbit, come from asingle coherent structure that was disrupted during or soon after the galaxy'sformation. this object had a highly inclined orbit about the milky way at amaximum distance of $\sim$ 16 kpc, and it probably resembled the fornax andsagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

0810.1522	the diversity and similarity of simulated cold dark matter halos	we study the mass, velocity dispersion, and anisotropy profiles of$\lambda$cdm halos using a suite of n-body simulations of unprecedentednumerical resolution (the {\it aquarius project}). our analysis confirms anumber of results claimed by earlier work, and clarifies a few issues whereconflicting claims may be found in the recent literature. thespherically-averaged density profile becomes progressively shallower inwardsand, at the innermost resolved radius, the logarithmic slope is $\gamma \equiv-$d$\ln\rho/$d$\ln r \simlt 1$. asymptotic inner slopes as steep as therecently claimed $\rho \propto r^{-1.2}$ are clearly ruled out. the radialdependence of $\gamma$ is well approximated by a power-law, $\gamma \proptor^{\alpha}$ (the einasto profile). the shape parameter, $\alpha$, variesslightly but significantly from halo to halo, implying that the mass profilesof $\lambda$cdm halos are not strictly universal: different halos cannot, ingeneral, be rescaled to look identical. departures from similarity are alsoseen in velocity dispersion profiles and correlate with those in densityprofiles so as to preserve a power-law form for the spherically averagedpseudo-phase-space density, $\rho/\sigma^3\propto r^{-1.875}$. our conclusionsare reliable down to radii below 0.4% of the virial radius, providingwell-defined predictions for halo structure when baryonic effects areneglected, and thus an instructive theoretical template against which themodifications induced by the baryonic components of real galaxies can bejudged.

0810.2669	the arcturus moving group: its place in the galaxy	the arcturus moving group is a well-populated example of phase spacesubstructure within the thick disk of our galaxy. traditionally regarded as theremains of a dissolved open cluster, it has recently been suggested to be aremnant of a satellite accreted by our galaxy. to investigate the origin of thegroup we undertook a high-resolution spectroscopic abundance study of arcturusgroup members and candidates. examining abundance of fe, mg, ca, ti, cr, ni,zn, ce, nd, sm and gd for 134 stars we found that the group is chemicallysimilar to disk stars and does not exhibit a clear chemical homogeneity.furthermore, we confirm the existence of the arcturus group using thenordstroem et al. (2004), schuster et al. (2006) and radial velocity experiment(rave) surveys (steinmetz et al. 2006). the origin of the group still remainsunresolved: the chemical results are consistent with a dynamical origin but donot entirely rule out a merger one. certainly, the arcturus group provides achallenge to our understanding of the nature and origin of the galaxy's thickdisk.

0812.0362	phase-space structure in the local dark matter distribution and its  signature in direct detection experiments	we study predictions for dark matter phase-space structure near the sun basedon high-resolution simulations of six galaxy halos taken from the aquariusproject. the local dm density distribution is predicted to be remarkablysmooth; the density at the sun differs from the mean over a best-fitellipsoidal equidensity contour by less than 15% at the 99.9% confidence level.the local velocity distribution is also very smooth, but it differssystematically from a (multivariate) gaussian distribution. this is not due tothe presence of individual clumps or streams, but to broad features in thevelocity modulus and energy distributions that are stable both in space andtime and reflect the detailed assembly history of each halo. these featureshave a significant impact on the signals predicted for wimp and axion searches.for example, wimp recoil rates can deviate by ~10% from those expected from thebest-fit multivariate gaussian models. the axion spectra in our simulationstypically peak at lower frequencies than in the case of multivariate gaussianvelocity distributions. also in this case, the spectra show significantimprints of the formation of the halo. this implies that once direct dmdetection has become routine, features in the detector signal will allow us tostudy the dark matter assembly history of the milky way. a new field, "darkmatter astronomy", will then emerge.
