0908.0330	the atomic-to-molecular transition in galaxies. iii. a new method for  determining the molecular content of primordial and dusty clouds	understanding the molecular content of galaxies is a critical problem in starformation and galactic evolution. here we present a new method, based on astromgren-type analysis, to calculate the amount of hi that surrounds amolecular cloud irradiated by an isotropic radiation field. we consider bothplanar and spherical clouds, and h_2 formation either in the gas phase orcatalyzed by dust grains. under the assumption that the transition from atomicto molecular gas is sharp, our method gives the solution without any referenceto the photodissociation cross section. we test our results for the planar caseagainst those of a pdr code, and find typical accuracies of about 10%. ourresults are also consistent with the scaling relations found in paper i of thisseries, but they apply to a wider range of physical conditions. we presentsimple, accurate analytic fits to our results that are suitable for comparisonto observations and to implementation in numerical and semi-analytic models.

0707.3514	theory of star formation	we review current understanding of star formation, outlining an overalltheoretical framework and the observations that motivate it. a conception ofstar formation has emerged in which turbulence plays a dual role, both creatingoverdensities to initiate gravitational contraction or collapse, and counteringthe effects of gravity in these overdense regions. the key dynamical processesinvolved in star formation -- turbulence, magnetic fields, and self-gravity --are highly nonlinear and multidimensional. physical arguments are used toidentify and explain the features and scalings involved in star formation, andresults from numerical simulations are used to quantify these effects. wedivide star formation into large-scale and small-scale regimes and review eachin turn. large scales range from galaxies to giant molecular clouds (gmcs) andtheir substructures. important problems include how gmcs form and evolve, whatdetermines the star formation rate (sfr), and what determines the initial massfunction (imf). small scales range from dense cores to the protostellar systemsthey beget. we discuss formation of both low- and high-mass stars, includingongoing accretion. the development of winds and outflows is increasingly wellunderstood, as are the mechanisms governing angular momentum transport indisks. although outstanding questions remain, the framework is now in place tobuild a comprehensive theory of star formation that will be tested by the nextgeneration of telescopes.

1001.0971	radiation feedback, fragmentation, and the environmental dependence of  the initial mass function	the fragmentation of star-forming interstellar clouds, and the resultingstellar initial mass function (imf), is strongly affected by the temperaturestructure of the collapsing gas. since radiation feedback from embedded starscan modify this as collapse proceeds, feedback plays an important role indetermining the imf. however, the effects and importance of radiative heatingare likely to depend strongly on the surface density of the collapsing clouds,which determines both their effectiveness at trapping radiation and theaccretion luminosities of the stars forming within them. in this paper wereport a suite of adaptive mesh refinement radiation-hydrodynamic simulationsusing the orion code in which we isolate the effect of column density onfragmentation by following the collapse of clouds of varying column densitywhile holding the mass, initial density and velocity structure, and initialvirial ratio fixed. we find that radiation does not significantly modify theoverall star formation rate or efficiency, but that it suppresses fragmentationmore and more as cloud surface densities increase from those typical of lowmass star-forming regions like taurus, through the typical surface density ofmassive star-forming clouds in the galaxy, up to conditions found only in superstar clusters. in regions of low surface density, fragmentation during collapseleads to the formation of small clusters rather than individual massive starsystems, greatly reducing the fraction of the stellar population with masses &gt;~10 msun. our simulations have important implications for the formation ofmassive stars and the universality of the imf.

1002.1309	metal-ion absorption in conductively evaporating clouds	we present computations of the ionization structure and metal-absorptionproperties of thermally conductive interface layers that surround evaporatingwarm spherical clouds, embedded in a hot medium. we rely on the analyticalformalism of dalton &amp; balbus to calculate the temperature profile in theevaporating gas, and explicitly solve the time-dependent ionization equationsfor h, he, c, n, o, si, and s in the interface. we include photoionization byan external field. we estimate how departures from equilibrium ionizationaffect the resonance-line cooling efficiencies in the evaporating gas, anddetermine the conditions for which radiative losses may be neglected in thesolution for the evaporation dynamics and temperature profile. our resultsindicate that non-equilibrium cooling significantly increases the value of thesaturation parameter at which radiative losses begin to affect the flowdynamics. as applications we calculate the ion fractions and projected columndensities arising in the evaporating layers surrounding dwarf-galaxy-scaleobjects that are also photoionized by metagalactic radiation. we compare ourresults to the uv metal-absorption column densities observed in localhighly-ionized metal-absorbers, located in the galactic corona or intergalacticmedium. conductive interfaces significantly enhance the formation of high-ionssuch as c^3+, n^4+, and o^5+ relative to purely photoionized clouds, especiallyfor clouds embedded in a high-pressure corona. however, the enhanced columnsare still too low to account for the o vi columns (~1e14 cm^-2) observed in thelocal high-velocity absorbers. we find that o vi columns larger than ~1e13cm^-2 cannot be produced in evaporating clouds. our results do support theconclusion of savage &amp; lehner, that absorption due to evaporating o vi likelyoccurs in the local interstellar medium, with characteristic columns of ~1e13cm^-2.

1004.3788	the protostellar mass function	the protostellar mass function (pmf) is the present-day mass function of theprotostars in a region of star formation. it is determined by the initial massfunction weighted by the accretion time. the pmf thus depends on the accretionhistory of protostars and in principle provides a powerful tool forobservationally distinguishing different protostellar accretion models. weconsider three basic models here: the isothermal sphere model (shu 1977), theturbulent core model (mckee &amp; tan 2003), and an approximate representation ofthe competitive accretion model (bonnell et al. 1997, 2001a). we also considermodified versions of these accretion models, in which the accretion rate tapersoff linearly in time. finally, we allow for an overall acceleration in the rateof star formation. at present, it is not possible to directly determine the pmfsince protostellar masses are not currently measurable. we carry out anapproximate comparison of predicted pmfs with observation by using the theoryto infer the conditions in the ambient medium in several star-forming regions.tapered and accelerating models generally agree better with observedstar-formation times than models without tapering or acceleration, butuncertainties in the accretion models and in the observations do not allow oneto rule out any of the proposed models at present. the pmf is essential for thecalculation of the protostellar luminosity function, however, and this enablesstronger conclusions to be drawn (offner &amp; mckee 2010).

1004.5401	the dark molecular gas	the mass of molecular gas in an interstellar cloud is often measured usingline emission from low rotational levels of co, which are sensitive to the comass, and then scaling to the assumed molecular hydrogen h_2 mass. however, asignificant h_2 mass may lie outside the co region, in the outer regions of themolecular cloud where the gas phase carbon resides in c or c+. here, h_2self-shields or is shielded by dust from uv photodissociation, where as co isphotodissociated. this h_2 gas is "dark" in molecular transitions because ofthe absence of co and other trace molecules, and because h_2 emits so weakly attemperatures 10 k &lt; t &lt; 100 k typical of this molecular component. thiscomponent has been indirectly observed through other tracers of mass such asgamma rays produced in cosmic ray collisions with the gas andfar-infrared/submillimeter wavelength dust continuum radiation. in this paperwe theoretically model this dark mass and find that the fraction of themolecular mass in this dark component is remarkably constant (~ 0.3 for averagevisual extinction through the cloud with mean a_v ~ 8) and insensitive to theincident ultraviolet radiation field strength, the internal densitydistribution, and the mass of the molecular cloud as long as mean a_v, orequivalently, the product of the average hydrogen nucleus column and themetallicity through the cloud, is constant. we also find that the dark massfraction increases with decreasing mean a_v, since relatively more molecularh_2 material lies outside the co region in this case.

1007.2032	sub-alfvenic non-ideal mhd turbulence simulations with ambipolar  diffusion: ii. comparison with observation, clump properties, and scaling to  physical units	ambipolar diffusion is important in redistributing magnetic flux and indamping alfven waves in molecular clouds. the importance of ambipolar diffusionon a length scale $\ell$ is governed by the ambipolar diffusion reynoldsnumber, $\rad=\ell/\lad$, where $\lad$ is the characteristic length scale forambipolar diffusion. the logarithmic mean of the ad reynolds number in a sampleof 15 molecular clumps with measured magnetic fields (crutcher 1999) is 17,comparable to the theoretically expected value. we identify several regimes ofambipolar diffusion in a turbulent medium, depending on the ratio of the flowtime to collision times between ions and neutrals; the clumps observed bycrutcher (1999) are all in the standard regime of ambipolar diffusion, in whichthe neutrals and ions are coupled over a flow time. we have carried outtwo-fluid simulations of ambipolar diffusion in isothermal, turbulent boxes fora range of values of $\rad$. the mean mach numbers were fixed at $\calm=3$ and$\ma=0.67$; self-gravity was not included. we study the properties ofoverdensities--i.e., clumps--in the simulation and show that the slope of thehigher-mass portion of the clump mass spectrum increases as $\rad$ decreases,which is qualitatively consistent with padoan et al. (2007)'s finding that themass spectrum in hydrodynamic turbulence is significantly steeper than in idealmhd turbulence. for a value of $\rad$ similar to the observed value, we find aslope that is consistent with that of the high-mass end of the initial massfunction for stars. however, the value we find for the spectral index in ourideal mhd simulation differs from theirs, presumably because our simulationshave different initial conditions. this suggests that the mass spectrum of theclumps in the padoan et al. (2007) turbulent fragmentation model for the imfdepends on the environment, which would conflict with evidence ...

1008.0410	regulation of star formation rates in multiphase galactic disks: a  thermal/dynamical equilibrium model	we develop a model for regulation of galactic star formation rates sigma_sfrin disk galaxies, in which ism heating by stellar uv plays a key role. byrequiring simultaneous thermal and (vertical) dynamical equilibrium in thediffuse gas, and star formation at a rate proportional to the mass of theself-gravitating component, we obtain a prediction for sigma_sfr as a functionof the total gaseous surface density sigma and the density of stars + darkmatter, rho_sd. the physical basis of this relationship is that thermalpressure in the diffuse ism, which is proportional to the uv heating rate andtherefore to sigma_sfr, must adjust to match the midplane pressure set by thevertical gravitational field. our model applies to regions where sigma &lt; 100msun/pc^2. in low-sigma_sfr (outer-galaxy) regions where diffuse gas dominates,the theory predicts sigma_sfr \propto sigma (rho_sd)^1/2. the decrease ofthermal equilibrium pressure when sigma_sfr is low implies, consistent withobservations, that star formation can extend (with declining efficiency) tolarge radii in galaxies, rather than having a sharp cutoff. the main parametersentering our model are the ratio of thermal pressure to total pressure in thediffuse ism, the fraction of diffuse gas that is in the warm phase, and thestar formation timescale in self-gravitating clouds; all of these are (inprinciple) direct observables. at low surface density, our model depends on theratio of the mean midplane fuv intensity (or thermal pressure in the diffusegas) to the star formation rate, which we set based on solar neighborhoodvalues. we compare our results to recent observations, showing good agreementoverall for azimuthally-averaged data in a set of spiral galaxies. for thelarge flocculent spiral galaxies ngc 7331 and ngc 5055, the correspondencebetween theory and observation is remarkably close.

1010.2452	an initial mass function for individual stars in galactic disks: i.  constraining the shape of the imf	we derive a semi-empirical galactic initial mass function (imf) fromobservational constraints. we assume that the star formation rate in a galaxycan be expressed as the product of the imf, $\psi (m)$, which is a smoothfunction of mass $m$ (in units of \msun), and a time- and space-dependent totalrate of star formation per unit area of galactic disk. the mass dependence ofthe proposed imf is determined by five parameters: the low-mass slope $\gamma$,the high-mass slope $-\gamma$, the characteristic mass $m_{ch}$ (which is closeto the mass $m_{\rm peak}$ at which the imf turns over), and the lower andupper limits on the mass, $m_l$ (taken to be 0.004) and $m_u$ (taken to be120). the star formation rate in terms of number of stars per unit area ofgalactic disk per unit logarithmic mass interval, is proportional to$m^{-\gamma} \left\{1-\exp\left[{-(m/m_{ch})^{\gamma +\gamma}}\right]\right\}$,where $\cal n_*$ is the number of stars, $m_l&lt;m&lt;m_u$ is the range of stellarmasses. the values of $\gamma$ and $\emch$ are derived from two integralconstraints: i) the ratio of the number density of stars in the range$m=0.1-0.6$ to that in the range $m=0.6-0.8$ as inferred from the massdistribution of field stars in the local neighborhood, and ii) the ratio of thenumber of stars in the range $m=0.08 - 1$ to the number of brown dwarfs in therange $m=0.03-0.08$ in young clusters. the imf satisfying the above constraintsis characterized by the parameters $\gamma=0.51$ and $\emch=0.35$ (whichcorresponds to $m_{\rm peak}=0.27$). this imf agrees quite well with thechabrier (2005) imf for the entire mass range over which we have compared withdata, but predicts significantly more stars with masses $&lt; 0.03\, m_\odot$; wealso compare with other imfs in current use.

1101.1296	what phase of the interstellar medium correlates with the star formation  rate?	nearby spiral galaxies show an extremely tight correlation between tracers ofmolecular hydrogen (h_2) in the interstellar medium (ism) and tracers of recentstar formation, but it is unclear whether this correlation is fundamental oraccidental. in the galaxies that have been surveyed to date, h_2 residespredominantly in gravitationally bound clouds cooled by carbon monoxide (co)molecules, but in galaxies of low metal content the correlations between boundclouds, co, and h_2 break down, and it is unclear if the star formation ratewill then correlate with h_2 or with some other quantity. here we show thatstar formation will continue to follow h_2 independent of metallicity. this isnot because h_2 is directly important for cooling, but instead because thetransition from predominantly atomic hydrogen (hi) to h_2 occurs under the sameconditions as a dramatic drop in gas temperature and bonnor-ebert mass thatdestabilizes clouds and initiates collapse. we use this model to compute howstar formation rate will correlate with total gas mass, with mass of gas wherethe hydrogen is h_2, and with mass of gas where the carbon is co in galaxies ofvarying metallicity, and show that preliminary observations match the trend wepredict.

1102.2023	metallicity and the universality of the imf	the stellar initial mass function (imf), along with the star formation rate,is one of the fundamental properties that any theory of star formation mustexplain. an interesting feature of the imf is that it appears to be remarkablyuniversal across a wide range of environments. particularly, there appears tobe little variation in either the characteristic mass of the imf or itshigh-mass tail between clusters with different metallicities. previous attemptsto understand this apparent independence of metallicity have not accounted forradiation feedback from high-mass protostars, which can dominate the energybalance of the gas in star-forming regions. we extend this work, showing thatthe fragmentation of molecular gas should depend only weakly on the amount ofdust present, even when the primary heating source is radiation from massiveprotostars. first, we report a series of core collapse simulations using theorion amr code that systematically vary the dust opacity and show explicitlythat this has little effect on the temperature or fragmentation of the gas.then, we provide an analytic argument for why the imf varies so little inobserved star clusters, even as the metallicity varies by a factor of 100.

1104.1218	radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of massive star formation with  protostellar outflows	we report the results of a series of amr radiation-hydrodynamic simulationsof the collapse of massive star forming clouds using the orion code. thesesimulations are the first to include the feedback effects protostellaroutflows, as well as protostellar radiative heating and radiation pressureexerted on the infalling, dusty gas. we find that that outflows evacuate polarcavities of reduced optical depth through the ambient core. these enhance theradiative flux in the poleward direction so that it is 1.7 to 15 times largerthan that in the midplane. as a result the radiative heating and outwardradiation force exerted on the protostellar disk and infalling cloud gas in theequatorial direction are greatly diminished. the simultaneously reduces theeddington radiation pressure barrier to high-mass star formation and increasesthe minimum threshold surface density for radiative heating to suppressfragmentation compared to models that do not include outflows. the strength ofboth these effects depends on the initial core surface density. lower surfacedensity cores have longer free-fall times and thus massive stars formed withinthem undergo more kelvin contraction as the core collapses, leading to morepowerful outflows. furthermore, in lower surface density clouds the ratio ofthe time required for the outflow to break out of the core to the corefree-fall time is smaller, so that these clouds are consequently influenced byoutflows at earlier stages of collapse. as a result, outflow effects arestrongest in low surface density cores and weakest in high surface density one.we also find that radiation focusing in the direction of outflow cavities issufficient to prevent the formation of radiation pressure-supportedcircumstellar gas bubbles, in contrast to models which neglect protostellaroutflow feedback.

1104.2038	radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of the formation of orion-like star  clusters i. implications for the origin of the initial mass function	one model for the origin of typical galactic star clusters such as the orionnebula cluster (onc) is that they form via the rapid, efficient collapse of abound gas clump within a larger, gravitationally-unbound giant molecular cloud.however, simulations in support of this scenario have thus far have notincluded the radiation feedback produced by the stars; radiative simulationshave been limited to significantly smaller or lower density regions. here weuse the orion adaptive mesh refinement code to conduct the first everradiation-hydrodynamic simulations of the global collapse scenario for theformation of an onc-like cluster. we show that radiative feedback has adramatic effect on the evolution: once the first ~10-20% of the gas mass isincorporated into stars, their radiative feedback raises the gas temperaturehigh enough to suppress any further fragmentation. however, gas continues toaccrete onto existing stars, and, as a result, the stellar mass distributionbecomes increasingly top-heavy, eventually rendering it incompatible with theobserved imf. systematic variation in the location of the imf peak as starformation proceeds is incompatible with the observed invariance of the imfbetween star clusters, unless some unknown mechanism synchronizes the imfs indifferent clusters by ensuring that star formation is always truncated when theimf peak reaches a particular value. we therefore conclude that the globalcollapse scenario, at least in its simplest form, is not compatible with theobserved stellar imf. we speculate that processes that slow down starformation, and thus reduce the accretion luminosity, may be able to resolve theproblem.

1105.0671	the protostellar luminosity function	the protostellar luminosity function (plf) is the present-day luminosityfunction of the protostars in a region of star formation. it is determinedusing the protostellar mass function (pmf) in combination with a stellarevolutionary model that provides the luminosity as a function of instantaneousand final stellar mass. as in mckee &amp; offner (2010), we consider three mainaccretion models: the isothermal sphere model, the turbulent core model, and anapproximation of the competitive accretion model. we also consider the effectof an accretion rate that tapers off linearly in time and an accelerating starformation rate. for each model, we characterize the luminosity distributionusing the mean, median, maximum, ratio of the median to the mean, standarddeviation of the logarithm of the luminosity, and the fraction of very lowluminosity objects. we compare the models with bolometric luminosities observedin local star forming regions and find that models with an approximatelyconstant accretion time, such as the turbulent core and competitive accretionmodels, appear to agree better with observation than those with a constantaccretion rate, such as the isothermal sphere model. we show that observationsof the mean protostellar luminosity in these nearby regions of low-mass starformation suggest a mean star formation time of 0.3$\pm$0.1 myr. such atimescale, together with some accretion that occurs non-radiatively and somethat occurs in high-accretion, episodic bursts, resolves the classical"luminosity problem" in low-mass star formation, in which observed protostellarluminosities are significantly less than predicted. an accelerating starformation rate is one possible way of reconciling the observed star formationtime and mean luminosity.

1109.3016	sub-alfvenic non-ideal mhd turbulence simulations with ambipolar  diffusion: iii. implications for observations and turbulent enhancement	ambipolar diffusion (ad) is believed to be a crucial process forredistributing magnetic flux in the dense molecular gas that occurs in regionsof star formation. we carry out numerical simulations of this process inregions of low ionization using the heavy ion approximation. the simulationsare for regions of strong field (plasma \beta=0.1) and mildly supersonicturbulence (m=3, corresponding to an alfven mach number of 0.67). the velocitypower spectrum of the neutral gas changes from an iroshnikov-kraichnan spectrumin the case of ideal mhd to a burgers spectrum in the case of a shock-dominatedhydrodynamic system. the magnetic power spectrum shows a similar behavior. weuse a 1d radiative transfer code to post-process our simulation results; thesimulated emission from the cs j=2-1 and h13co+ j=1-0 lines shows that theeffects of ad are observable in principle. linewidths of ions are observed tobe less than those of neutrals, and we confirm previous suggestions that thisis due to ad. we show that ad is unlikely to affect the chandrasekhar-fermimethod for inferring field strengths unless the ad is stronger than generallyobserved. finally, we present the first fully 3d study of the enhancement of adby turbulence, finding that ad is accelerated by factor 2-4.5 for nonself-gravitating systems with the level of turbulence we consider.

1109.4150	a universal, local star formation law in galactic clouds, nearby  galaxies, high-redshift disks, and starbursts	[abridged] while observations of local group galaxies show a very simple,local star formation law in which the star formation rate per unit area in eachpatch of a galaxy scales linearly with the molecular gas surface density,recent observations of both milky way molecular clouds and high redshiftgalaxies apparently show a more complicated relationship, in which regions ofequal surface density can form stars at quite different rates. these data havebeen interpreted as implying either that different star formation laws apply indifferent circumstances, that the star formation law is sensitive tolarge-scale galaxy properties rather than local properties, or that there arehigh density thresholds for star formation. here we collate resolvedobservations of milky way molecular clouds, kpc-scale observations of localgroup galaxies, and unresolved observations of both disk and starburst galaxiesin the local universe and at high redshift. we show that all of these data arein fact consistent with a simple, local, volumetric star formation law. theapparent variations stem from the fact that the observed objects have a widevariety of 3d size scales and degrees of internal clumping, so even at fixedgas column density the regions being observed can have wildly varying volumedensities. we provide a simple theoretical framework to remove this projectioneffect, and we show that all the data, from small solar neighborhood cloudswith masses ~10^3 msun to sub-mm galaxies with masses ~10^11 msun, fall on asingle star formation law in which the sfr is simply ~1% of the molecular gasmass per local free-fall time. in contrast, proposed star formation laws inwhich the star formation timescale is set by the galactic rotation period orthe sfr is linearly proportional to the gas mass above some density thresholdfail to match at least some of the data.

1201.2751	feedback effects on low-mass star formation	protostellar feedback, both radiation and bipolar outflows, dramaticallyaffects the fragmentation and mass accretion from star-forming cores. we useorion, an adaptive mesh refinement gravito-radiation-hydrodynamics code, tosimulate the formation of a cluster of low-mass stars, including both radiativetransfer and protostellar outflows. we ran four simulations to isolate theindividual effects of radiation feedback and outflow feedback as well as thecombination of the two. outflows reduce protostellar masses and accretion rateseach by a factor of three and therefore reduce protostellar luminosities by anorder of magnitude. thus, while radiation feedback suppresses fragmentation,outflows render protostellar radiation largely irrelevant for low-mass starformation above a mass scale of 0.05 m_sun. we find initial fragmentation ofour cloud at half the global jeans length, ~ 0.1 pc. with insufficientprotostellar radiation to stop it, these 0.1 pc cores fragment repeatedly,forming typically 10 stars each. the accretion rate in these stars scales withmass as predicted from core accretion models that include both thermal andturbulent motions. we find that protostellar outflows do not significantlyaffect the overall cloud dynamics, in the absence of magnetic fields, due totheir small opening angles and poor coupling to the dense gas. the outflowsreduce the mass from the cores by 2/3, giving a core to star efficiency ~ 1/3.the simulation with radiation and outflows reproduces the observed protostellarluminosity function. all of the simulations can reproduce observed core massfunctions, though they are sensitive to telescope resolution. the simulationwith both radiation and outflows reproduces the galactic imf and the two-pointcorrelation function of the cores observed in rho oph.

1203.2620	radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of the formation of orion-like star  clusters ii. the initial mass function from winds, turbulence, and radiation	[abridged] we report a series of simulations of the formation of a starcluster similar to the orion nebula cluster (onc), including both radiativetransfer and protostellar outflows, and starting from both smooth andself-consistently turbulent initial conditions. each simulation forms &gt;150stars and brown dwarfs, yielding a stellar mass distribution from &lt; 0.1 to &gt; 10msun. we show that a simulation that begins with self-consistently turbulenceembedded in a larger turbulent volume, and that includes protostellar outflows,produces an initial mass function (imf) consistent both with that of the oncand the galactic field. this is the first simulation published to date thatreproduces the observed imf in a cluster large enough to contain massive stars,and where the result is determined by a fully self-consistent calculation ofgas thermodynamics. this simulation also produces a star formation rate that,while still somewhat too high, is much closer to observed values than if weomit either the larger turbulent volume or the outflows. moreover, we show thatthe combination of outflows, self-consistently turbulent initial conditions,and turbulence continually fed by motions on scales larger than that of theprotocluster yields an imf that is in agreement with observations and invariantwith time, resolving the "overheating" problem in which simulations withoutthese features have an imf peak that shifts to progressively higher masses overtime. the simulation that matches the observed imf also reproduces the observedtrend of stellar multiplicity strongly increasing with mass. we show that thissimulation produces massive stars from distinct massive cores whose propertiesare consistent with those of observed massive cores. however, the stars formedin these cores also undergo dynamical interactions that naturally producetrapezium-like hierarchical multiple systems.

1205.0246	observing simulated protostars with outflows: how accurate are  protostellar properties inferred from seds?	the properties of unresolved protostars and their local environment arefrequently inferred from spectral energy distributions (seds) using radiativetransfer modeling. we perform synthetic observations of realistic starformation simulations to evaluate the accuracy of properties inferred fromfitting model seds to observations. we use orion, an adaptive mesh refinement(amr) three-dimensional gravito-radiation-hydrodynamics code, to simulatelow-mass star formation in a turbulent molecular cloud including the effects ofprotostellar outflows. to obtain the dust temperature distribution and seds ofthe forming protostars, we post-process the simulations using hyperion, astate-of-the-art monte-carlo radiative transfer code. we find that the orionand hyperion dust temperatures typically agree within a factor of two. wecompare synthetic seds of embedded protostars for a range of evolutionarytimes, simulation resolutions, aperture sizes, and viewing angles. wedemonstrate that complex, asymmetric gas morphology leads to a variety ofclassifications for individual objects as a function of viewing angle. wederive best-fit source parameters for each sed through comparison with apre-computed grid of radiative transfer models. while the sed models correctlyidentify the evolutionary stage of the synthetic sources as embeddedprotostars, we show that the disk and stellar parameters can be very discrepantfrom the simulated values. parameters such as the stellar accretion rate,stellar mass, and disk mass show better agreement, but can still deviatesignificantly, and the agreement may in some cases be artificially good due tothe limited range of parameters in the set of model seds. lack of correlationbetween the model and simulation properties in many individual instancescautions against over-interpreting properties inferred from seds for unresolvedprotostellar sources.

0711.1377	the formation of the first stars ii. radiative feedback processes and  implications for the initial mass function	we consider the radiative feedback processes that operate during theformation of the first stars, including the photodissociation of h_2, ly-alpharadiation pressure, formation and expansion of an hii region, and diskphotoevaporation. these processes may inhibit continued accretion once thestellar mass has reached a critical value, and we evaluate this mass separatelyfor each process. photodissociation of h_2 in the local dark matter minihalooccurs relatively early in the growth of the protostar, but we argue this doesnot affect subsequent accretion since by this time the depth of the potentialis large enough for accretion to be mediated by atomic cooling. however,neighboring starless minihalos can be affected. ionization creates an hiiregion in the infalling envelope above and below the accretion disk. ly-alpharadiation pressure acting at the boundary of the hii region is effective atreversing infall from narrow polar directions when the star reaches ~20-30msun,but cannot prevent infall from other directions. expansion of the hii regionbeyond the gravitational escape radius for ionized gas occurs at masses~50-100msun, depending on the accretion rate and angular momentum of theinflow. however, again, accretion from the equatorial regions can continuesince the neutral accretion disk has a finite thickness and shields asubstantial fraction of the accretion envelope from direct ionizing flux. athigher stellar masses, ~140msun in the fiducial case, the combination ofdeclining accretion rates and increasing photoevaporation-driven mass loss fromthe disk act to effectively halt the increase in the protostellar mass. weidentify this process as the mechanism that terminates the growth of populationiii stars...

1206.6079	photometric redshifts of submillimeter galaxies	we use the photometric redshift method of chakrabarti &amp; mckee (2008) to inferphotometric redshifts of submillimeter galaxies with far-ir (fir)$\it{herschel}$ data obtained as part of the pacs evolutionary probe (pep)program. for the sample with spectroscopic redshifts, we demonstrate thevalidity of this method over a large range of redshifts ($ 4 \ga z \ga 0.3$)and luminosities, finding an average accuracy in $(1+z_{\rm phot})/(1+z_{\rmspec})$ of 10%. thus, this method is more accurate than other fir photometricredshift methods. this method is different from typical fir photometric methodsin deriving redshifts from the light-to-gas mass ($l/m$) ratio ofinfrared-bright galaxies inferred from the fir spectral energy distribution(sed), rather than dust temperatures. once the redshift is derived, we candetermine physical properties of infrared bright galaxies, including thetemperature variation within the dust envelope, luminosity, mass, and surfacedensity. we use data from the goods-s field to calculate the star formationrate density (sfrd) of sub-mm bright sources detected by aztec and pacs. theaztec-pacs sources, which have a threshold $850 \micron$ flux $\ga 5 \rm mjy$,contribute 15% of the sfrd from all ulirgs ($l_{\rm ir} \ga 10^{12}l_{\odot}$), and 3% of the total sfrd at $z \sim 2$.

0711.4116	star formation at zero and very low metallicities	we describe how star formation is expected to proceed in the early metal-freeuniverse, focusing on the very first generations of stars. we then discuss howthe star formation process may change as the effects of metallicity, externalradiative feedback, and magnetic and turbulent support of the gas become moreimportant. the very first stars (pop iii.1) have relatively simple initialconditions set by cosmology and the cooling properties of primordial gas. wedescribe the evolution of these stars as they grow in mass by accretion fromtheir surrounding gas cores and how the accretion process is affected andeventually terminated by radiative feedback processes, especially hii regionexpansion and disk photoevaporation. the ability of the protostar and its diskto generate dynamically important magnetic fields is reviewed and their effectsdiscussed. pop iii.1 star formation is likely to produce massive (~100-200msun)stars that then influence their surroundings via ionization, stellar winds, andsupernovae. these processes heat, ionize and metal-enrich the gas, thusaltering the initial conditions for the next generation of star formation.stars formed from gas that has been altered significantly by radiative and/ormechanical feedback, but not by metal enrichment (pop iii.2) are expected tohave significantly smaller masses than pop iii.1 stars because of moreefficient cooling from enhanced hd production. stars formed from gas that ismetal-enriched to levels that affect the dynamics of the collapse (the firstpop ii stars) are also expected to have relatively low masses. we brieflycompare the above star formation scenarios to what is known about present-daystar formation.

1210.0700	ambipolar diffusion heating in turbulent systems	the temperature of the gas in molecular clouds is a key determinant of thecharacteristic mass of star formation. ambipolar diffusion (ad) is consideredone of the most important heating mechanisms in weakly ionized molecularclouds. in this work, we study the ad heating rate using 2-fluid turbulencesimulations and compare it with the overall heating rate due to turbulentdissipation. we find that for observed molecular clouds, which typically havealfven mach numbers of ~1 (crutcher 1999) and ad reynolds numbers of ~20 (mckeeet al. 2010), about 70% of the total turbulent dissipation is in the form of adheating. ad has an important effect on the length scale where energy isdissipated: when ad heating is strong, most of the energy in the cascade isremoved by ion-neutral drift, with a comparatively small amount of energymaking it down to small scales. we derive a relation for the ad heating ratethat describes the results of our simulations to within a factor of two.turbulent dissipation, including ad heating, is generally less important thatcosmic-ray heating in molecular clouds, although there is substantial scatterin both.

1211.3467	the fragmentation of magnetized, massive star-forming cores with  radiative feedback	we present a set of 3-dimensional, radiation-magnetohydrodynamic calculationsof the gravitational collapse of massive (300 msun), star-forming molecularcloud cores. we show that the combined effects of magnetic fields and radiativefeedback strongly suppress core fragmentation, leading to the production ofsingle star systems rather than small clusters. we find that the two processesare efficient at suppressing fragmentation in different regimes, with thefeedback most effective in the dense, central region and the magnetic fieldmost effective in more diffuse, outer regions. thus, the combination of the twois much more effective at suppressing fragmentation than either one consideredin isolation. our work suggests that typical massive cores, which havemass-to-flux ratios of about 2 relative to critical, likely form a single starsystem, but that cores with weaker fields may form a small star cluster. thisresult helps us understand why the observed relationship between the core massfunction and the stellar initial mass function holds even for ~100 msun coreswith many thermal jeans masses of material. we also demonstrate that a ~40 aukeplerian disk is able to form in our simulations, despite the braking effectcaused by the strong magnetic field.

1302.3858	a massive protostar forming by ordered collapse of a dense, massive core	we present 30 and 40 micron imaging of the massive protostar g35.20-0.74 withsofia-forcast. the high surface density of the natal core around the protostarleads to high extinction, even at these relatively long wavelengths, causingthe observed flux to be dominated by that emerging from the near-facing outflowcavity. however, emission from the far-facing cavity is still clearly detected.we combine these results with fluxes from the near-infrared to mm to constructa spectral energy distribution (sed). for isotropic emission the bolometricluminosity would be 3.3x10^4 lsun. we perform radiative transfer modeling of aprotostar forming by ordered, symmetric collapse from a massive core bounded bya clump with high mass surface density, sigma_cl. to fit the sed requiresprotostellar masses ~20-34 msun depending on the outflow cavity opening angle(35 - 50 degrees), and sigma_cl ~ 0.4-1 g cm-2. after accounting for theforeground extinction and the flashlight effect, the true bolometric luminosityis ~ (0.7-2.2)x10^5 lsun. one of these models also has excellent agreement withthe observed intensity profiles along the outflow axis at 10, 18, 31 and 37microns. overall our results support a model of massive star formationinvolving the relatively ordered, symmetric collapse of a massive, dense coreand the launching bipolar outflows that clear low density cavities. thus aunified model may apply for the formation of both low and high mass stars.

0801.0442	a minimum column density of 1 g cm^-2 for massive star formation	massive stars are very rare, but their extreme luminosities make them boththe only type of young star we can observe in distant galaxies and the dominantenergy sources in the universe today. they form rarely because efficientradiative cooling keeps most star-forming gas clouds close to isothermal asthey collapse, and this favors fragmentation into stars &lt;~1 msun. heating of acloud by accreting low-mass stars within it can prevent fragmentation and allowformation of massive stars, but what properties a cloud must have to formmassive stars, and thus where massive stars form in a galaxy, has not yet beendetermined. here we show that only clouds with column densities &gt;~ 1 g cm^-2can avoid fragmentation and form massive stars. this threshold, and theenvironmental variation of the stellar initial mass function (imf) that itimplies, naturally explain the characteristic column densities of massive starclusters and the difference between the radial profiles of halpha and uvemission in galactic disks. the existence of a threshold also implies thatthere should be detectable variations in the imf with environment within thegalaxy and in the characteristic column densities of massive star clustersbetween galaxies, and that star formation rates in some galactic environmentsmay have been systematically underestimated.

1306.5276	interstellar h$_2$o masers from j shocks	we present a model in which the 22 ghz h$_2$o masers observed in star-formingregions occur behind shocks propagating in dense regions (preshock density $n_0\sim 10^6 - 10^8$ cm$^{-3}$). we focus on high-velocity ($v_s &gt; 30$ kms$^{-1}$) dissociative j shocks in which the heat of h$_2$ re-formationmaintains a large column of $\sim 300-400$ k gas; at these temperatures thechemistry drives a considerable fraction of the oxygen not in co to formh$_2$o. the h$_2$o column densities, the hydrogen densities, and the warmtemperatures produced by these shocks are sufficiently high to enable powerfulmaser action. the observed brightness temperatures (generally $\sim 10^{11} -10^{14}$ k) are the result of coherent velocity regions that have dimensions inthe shock plane that are 10 to 100 times the shock thickness of $\sim 10^{13}$cm. the masers are therefore beamed towards the observer, who typically viewsthe shock "edge-on", or perpendicular to the shock velocity; the brightestmasers are then observed with the lowest line of sight velocities with respectto the ambient gas. we present numerical and analytic studies of the dependenceof the maser inversion, the resultant brightness temperature, the maser spotsize and shape, the isotropic luminosity, and the maser region magnetic fieldon the shock parameters and the coherence path length; the overall result isthat in galactic h$_2$o 22 ghz masers these observed parameters can be producedin j shocks with $n_0\sim 10^6 - 10^8$ cm$^{-3}$ and $v_s \sim 30 -200$ kms$^{-1}$. a number of key observables such as maser shape, brightnesstemperature, and global isotropic luminosity depend only on the particle fluxinto the shock, $j=n_0v_s$, rather than on $n_0$ and $v_s$ separately.

1401.7010	bondi-hoyle accretion in an isothermal magnetized plasma	in regions of star formation, protostars and newborn stars accrete mass fromtheir natal clouds. these clouds are threaded by magnetic fields with astrength characterized by the plasma beta---the ratio of thermal and magneticpressures. observations show molecular clouds have beta &lt;= 1, so magneticfields can play a significant role in the accretion process. we have carriedout a numerical study of the effect of large-scale magnetic fields on the rateof accretion onto a uniformly moving point particle from a uniform,non-self-gravitating, isothermal gas. we consider gas moving with sonic machnumbers of up m ~ 45, magnetic fields that are either parallel, perpendicular,or oriented 45 degrees to the flow, and beta as low as 0.01. our simulationsutilize amr to obtain high spatial resolution where needed; this also allowsthe simulation boundaries to be far from the accreting object. additionally, weshow our results are independent of our exact prescription for accreting massin the sink particle. we give simple expressions for the steady-state accretionrate as a function of beta, m, and field orientation. using typical molecularclouds values of m ~ 5 and beta ~ 0.04 from the literature, our fits suggest a0.4 m_sun star accretes ~ 4*10^{-9} m_sun/year, almost a factor of two lessthan accretion rates predicted by hydrodynamic models. this disparity grows toorders of magnitude for stronger fields and lower mach numbers. we discuss theapplicability of these accretion rates versus accretion rates expected fromgravitational collapse, and when a steady state is possible. this reduction inmdot increases the time required to form stars in competitive accretion models,making such models less efficient. in numerical codes, our results shouldenable accurate subgrid models of sink particles accreting from magnetizedmedia.

0805.0597	sub-alfvenic non-ideal mhd turbulence simulations with ambipolar  diffusion: i. turbulence statistics	most numerical investigations on the role of magnetic fields in turbulentmolecular clouds (mcs) are based on ideal magneto-hydrodynamics (mhd). however,mcs are weakly ionized, so that the time scale required for the magnetic fieldto diffuse through the neutral component of the plasma by ambipolar diffusion(ad) can be comparable to the dynamical time scale. we have performed a seriesof 256^3 and 512^3 simulations on supersonic but sub-alfvenic turbulent systemswith ad using the heavy-ion approximation developed in li, mckee, &amp; klein(2006). our calculations are based on the assumption that the number of ions isconserved, but we show that these results approximately apply to the case oftime-dependent ionization in molecular clouds as well. convergence studiesallow us to determine the optimal value of the ionization mass fraction whenusing the heavy-ion approximation for low mach number, sub-alfvenic turbulentsystems. we find that ambipolar diffusion steepens the velocity and magneticpower spectra compared to the ideal mhd case. changes in the density pdf, totalmagnetic energy, and ionization fraction are determined as a function of the adreynolds number. the power spectra for the neutral gas properties of a stronglymagnetized medium with a low ad reynolds number are similar to those for aweakly magnetized medium; in particular, the power spectrum of the neutralvelocity is close to that for burgers turbulence.

1506.08228	magnetized interstellar molecular clouds. i. comparison between  simulations and zeeman observations	the most accurate measurements of magnetic fields in star-forming gas arebased on the zeeman observations analyzed by crutcher et al. (2010). we showthat their finding that the 3d magnetic field scales approximately asdensity$^{0.65}$ can also be obtained from analysis of the observedline-of-sight fields. we present two large-scale amr mhd simulations of severalthousand $m_\odot$ of turbulent, isothermal, self-gravitating gas, one with astrong initial magnetic field (alfven mach number $m_{a,0}= 1$) and one with aweak initial field ($m_{a,0}=10$). we construct samples of the 100 most massiveclumps in each simulation and show that they exhibit a power-law relationbetween field strength and density in excellent agreement with the observedone. our results imply that the average field in molecular clumps in theinterstellar medium is $&lt;b_{tot}&gt; \sim 42 n_{h,4}^{0.65} \mu$g. furthermore,the median value of the ratio of the line-of-sight field to density$^{0.65}$ inthe simulations is within a factor of about (1.3, 1.7) of the observed valuefor the strong and weak field cases, respectively. the median value of themass-to-flux ratio, normalized to the critical value, is 70% of theline-of-sight value. this is larger than the 50% usually cited for sphericalclouds because the actual mass-to-flux ratio depends on the volume-weightedfield, whereas the observed one depends on the mass-weighted field. our resultsindicate that the typical molecular clump in the ism is significantlysupercritical (~ factor of 3). the results of our strong-field model are invery good quantitative agreement with the observations of li et al. (2009),which show a strong correlation in field orientation between small and largescales. because there is a negligible correlation in the weak-field model, weconclude that molecular clouds form from strongly magnetized (althoughmagnetically supercritical) gas.

astro-ph;0001094	photoionization of galactic halo gas by old supernova remnants	we present new calculations on the contribution from cooling hot gas to thephotoionization of warm ionized gas in the galaxy. we show that hot gas incooling supernova remnants (snrs) is an important source of photoionization,particularly for gas in the halo. we find that in many regions at high latitudethis source is adequate to account for the observed ionization so there is noneed to find ways to transport stellar photons from the disk. the flux fromcooling snrs sets a floor on the ionization along any line of sight. our modelflux is also shown to be consistent with the diffuse soft x-ray background andwith soft x-ray observations of external galaxies.  we consider the ionization of the clouds observed towards the halo star hd93521, for which there are no o stars close to the line of sight. we show thatthe observed ionization can be explained successfully by our model euv/softx-ray flux from cooling hot gas. in particular, we can match the h alphaintensity, the s++/s+ ratio, and the c+* column. from observations of theratios of columns of c+* and either s+ or h0, we are able to estimate thethermal pressure in the clouds. the slow clouds require high (~10^4 cm^-3 k)thermal pressures to match the n(c+*)/n(s+) ratio. additional heating sourcesare required for the slow clouds to maintain their ~7000 k temperatures atthese pressures, as found by reynolds, hausen &amp; tufte (1999).

astro-ph;0007383	efficiencies of low-mass star and star cluster formation	using a quantitative model for bipolar outflows driven by hydromagneticprotostellar winds, we calculate the efficiency of star formation assuming thatavailable gas is either converted into stars or ejected in outflows. weestimate the efficiency of a single star formation event in a protostellarcore, finding 25%-70% for cores with various possible degrees of flattening.the core mass function and the stellar initial mass function have similarslopes, because the efficiency is not sensitive to its parameters. we thenconsider the disruption of gas from a dense molecular clump in which a clusterof young stars is being born. in both cases, we present analytical formulae forthe efficiencies that compare favorably against observations and, for clusters,against numerical simulations. we predict efficiencies in the range 30%-50% forthe regions that form clusters of low-mass stars. in our model, star formationand gas dispersal happen concurrently. we neglect the destructive effects ofmassive stars: our results are therefore upper limits to the efficiency inregions more massive than about 3000 msun.

astro-ph;0012003	trans-relativistic blast waves in supernovae as gamma-ray burst  progenitors	we investigate the acceleration of shock waves to relativistic velocities inthe outer layers of exploding stars. by concentrating the explosion energy inthe outermost ejecta, such trans-relativistic blast waves can serve as theprogenitors of gamma-ray bursts (grbs); in particular, the ``baryon-loading''problem that plagues many models of grbs is circumvented. we present physicallymotivated and numerically validated analytic expressions to describetrans-relativistic blast waves in supernovae. we find that relativistic ejectaare enhanced in more centrally condensed envelopes, e.g., for radiativeenvelopes, when the luminosity approaches the eddington limit. we presentconvenient formulae for estimating the relativistic ejecta from a givenprogenitor. we apply our analytic and numerical methods to a model of sn1998bw, finding significantly enhanced relativistic ejecta compared to previousstudies. we propose that grb 980425 is associated with sn 1998bw and may haveresulted from an approximately spherical explosion producing ~10^-6 m_sun ofmildly relativistic ejecta with mean lorentz factor ~2, which then interactedwith a dense circumstellar wind with mass loss rate ~few x 10^-4 m_sun/yr. ahighly asymmetric explosion is not required. an extreme model of ``hypernova''explosions in massive stars is able to account for the energetics andrelativistic ejecta velocities required by many of the observed cosmologicalgrbs. we present simplified models of explosions resulting fromaccretion-induced collapse of white dwarfs and phase transitions of neutronstars. while we find increased energies in relativistic ejecta compared toprevious studies, these explosions are unlikely to be observed at cosmologicaldistances with current detectors.

astro-ph;0202196	time dependence of the ultraviolet radiation field in the local  interstellar medium	far ultraviolet radiation has been recognized as the main source of heatingof the neutral interstellar gas, and, as a consequence, it determines whetherthe thermal balance of the neutral gas results in cold ($t\sim 50 - 100 k$)clouds (cnm), warm ($t \sim 10^4 k$) clouds (wnm), or a combination of the two.high fuv fields convert the neutral gas to wnm, while low fields result in cnm.the sources of fuv radiation are the short-lived massive stars that generallyoriginate in associations that form in giant molecular clouds present in thegalactic disk. using mckee &amp; williams' (1997) distribution of birthrates for obassociations in the galaxy, we determine the expected behavior of thetime-dependent fuv field for random positions in the local ism. the fuv fieldis calculated in two bands (912-1100 \aa and 912-2070 \aa) and at thewavelength 1400 \aa. our median value for the [912-2070 \aa] band is $g_0=1.6$times habing's (1968) value for the radiation field at the solar circle in thisband, and quite close to draine's (1976) value, $g_0=1.7$. due to attenuationby dust, only associations within about 500 pc contribute significantly to theenergy density at a given point. the fuv field is asymmetric at a given point,and the asymmetry grows for higher fields. the fuv field fluctuates with avariety of amplitudes, the larger ones being less frequent. the mean field isabout twice the median field because of these fluctuations, or spikes, in theradiation field. these spikes, which last $\sim 30$ myr, are caused by theinfrequent birth of nearby associations. we also model shorter duration spikescaused by runaway ob stars. the presence of a fluctuating heating rate createdby the fluctuating fuv field converts cnm to wnm and vice versa.

astro-ph;0203071	massive star formation in 100,000 years from turbulent and pressurized  molecular clouds	massive stars (with mass m_* &gt; 8 solar masses) are fundamental to theevolution of galaxies, because they produce heavy elements, inject energy intothe interstellar medium, and possibly regulate the star formation rate. theindividual star formation time, t_*f, determines the accretion rate of thestar; the value of the former quantity is currently uncertain by many orders ofmagnitude, leading to other astrophysical questions. for example, the variationof t_*f with stellar mass dictates whether massive stars can formsimultaneously with low-mass stars in clusters. here we show that t_*f isdetermined by conditions in the star's natal cloud, and is typically ~10^5 yr.the corresponding mass accretion rate depends on the pressure within the cloud- which we relate to the gas surface density - and on both the instantaneousand final stellar masses. characteristic accretion rates are sufficient toovercome radiation pressure from ~100 solar mass protostars, whilesimultaneously driving intense bipolar gas outflows. the weak dependence oft_*f on the final mass of the star allows high- and low-mass star formation tooccur nearly simultaneously in clusters.

astro-ph;0206037	the formation of massive stars from turbulent cores	observations indicate that massive stars form in regions of very high surfacedensity, ~1 g cm^-2. clusters containing massive stars and globular clustershave a comparable column density. the total pressure in clouds of such a columndensity is p/k~10^8-10^9 k cm^-3, far greater than that in the diffuse ism orthe average in gmcs. observations show that massive star-forming regions aresupersonically turbulent, and we show that the molecular cores out of whichindividual massive stars form are as well. the protostellar accretion rate insuch a core is approximately equal to the instantaneous mass of the stardivided by the free-fall time of the gas that is accreting onto the star(stahler, shu, &amp; taam 1980). the star-formation time in this turbulent coremodel for massive star formation is several mean free-fall timesscales of thecore, but is about equal to that of the region in which the core is embedded.the typical time for a massive star to form is about 10^5 yr and the accretionrate is high enough to overcome radiation pressure due to the luminosity of thestar. for the typical case we consider, in which the cores out of which thestars form have a density structure varying as r^{-1.5}, the protostellaraccretion rate grows linearly with time. we calculate the evolution of theradius of a protostar and determine the accretion luminosity. at the highaccretion rates that are typical in regions of massive star formation,protostars join the main sequence at about 20 solar masses. we apply theseresults to predict the properties of protostars thought to be powering severalobserved hot molecular cores, including the orion hot core and w3(h2o). in theappendixes, we discuss the pressure in molecular clouds and we argue that``logatropic'' models for molecular clouds are incompatible with observation.

astro-ph;0307414	the formation of the first stars i. mass infall rates, accretion disk  structure and protostellar evolution	we present a theoretical model for primordial star formation. first wedescribe the structure of the initial gas cores as virialized,quasi-hydrostatic objects in accord with recent high resolution numericalstudies. the accretion rate can then be related to characteristic densities andtemperatures that are set by the cooling properties of molecular hydrogen. weallow for rotation of the gas core, assuming angular momentum conservationinside the sonic point of the flow. in the typical case, most mass then reachesthe star via an accretion disk. the structure of the inner region of this diskis described with the standard theory of viscous disks, but with allowance forthe substantial energies absorbed in ionizing and dissociating the gas. thesize of the protostar and its luminosity depend upon the accretion rate, theenergetics of the accreting gas, and the ability of the radiation to escapefrom the stellar accretion shock. we combine these models for the infall rate,inner disk structure, and protostellar evolution to predict the radiation fieldthat is the basis for radiative feedback processes acting against infall (paperii). for realistic initial angular momenta, the photosphere of the protostar ismuch smaller and hotter than in the spherical case, leading to strongerradiative feedback at earlier stages in the evolution. in particular, once thestar is older than its kelvin-helmholtz time, contraction towards the mainsequence causes a rapid increase in ionizing and far-ultraviolet luminosity atmasses ~30msun in the fiducial case. since the cores out of which the firststars formed were much more massive than 30msun and since feedback isdynamically unimportant at lower masses, we conclude that the first starsshould have had masses &gt;~30msun.

astro-ph;0309139	outflow-confined hii regions and the formation of massive stars by  accretion	if massive stars form by disk accretion, then bipolar outflows should begenerated as in the case of low-mass star formation. high accretion rates leadto high outflow rates and make the wind density very large near the protostar.we therefore predict that massive protostars have very small, jet-like hiiregions confined by their outflows; we identify these hii regions with"hypercompact" (&lt;0.01 pc) hii regions. their lifetime is approximately equal tothe accretion timescale (~10^5 yr), much longer than the sound-crossing anddynamical timescales of the ionized region. we present an analytic descriptionof the density distribution of the outflow, relate the overall mass loss rateto the accretion rate, and normalize to values appropriate to massiveprotostars. for a given ionizing luminosity, we calculate the extent of the hiiregion and its radio spectrum. a detailed comparison is made with observationsof radio source "i" in the orion hot core. the spectra and morphologies of manyother sources are broadly consistent with this model. we argue that confinementof ionization allows disk and equatorial accretion to continue up to highmasses, potentially overcoming a major difficulty of standard accretion models.

astro-ph;0312612	embedding lagrangian sink particles in eulerian grids	we introduce a new computational method for embedding lagrangian sinkparticles into an eulerian calculation. simulations of gravitational collapseor accretion generally produce regions whose density greatly exceeds the meandensity in the simulation. these dense regions require extremely small timesteps to maintain numerical stability. smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph)codes approach this problem by introducing non-gaseous, accreting sinkparticles, and eulerian codes may introduce fixed sink cells. however, untilnow there has been no approach that allows eulerian codes to follow accretiononto multiple, moving objects. we have removed that limitation by extending thesink particle capability to eulerian hydrodynamics codes. we have tested thisnew method and found that it produces excellent agreement with analyticsolutions. in analyzing our sink particle method, we present a method forevaluating the disk viscosity parameter $\alpha$ due to the numerical viscosityof a hydrodynamics code, and use it to compute $\alpha$ for our cartesian amrcode. we also present a simple application of this new method: studying thetransition from bondi to bondi-hoyle accretion that occurs when a shock hits aparticle undergoing bondi accretion.

astro-ph;0409454	bondi accretion in the presence of vorticity	the classical bondi-hoyle formula gives the accretion rate onto a pointparticle of a gas with a uniform density and velocity. however, the bondi-hoyleproblem considers only gas with no net vorticity, while in a real astrophysicalsituation accreting gas invariably has at least a small amount of vorticity. wetherefore consider the related case of accretion of gas with constantvorticity, for the cases of both small and large vorticity. we confirm thefindings of earlier two dimensional simulations that even a small amount ofvorticity can substantially change both the accretion rate and the morphologyof the gas flow lines. we show that in three dimensions the resulting flowfield is non-axisymmetric and time dependent. the reduction in accretion rateis due to an accumulation of circulation near the accreting particle. using acombination of simulations and analytic treatment, we provide an approximateformula for the accretion rate of gas onto a point particle as a function ofthe vorticity of the surrounding gas.

astro-ph;0506658	far-infrared spectral energy distributions of embedded protostars and  dusty galaxies: i. theory for spherical sources	we present analytic radiative transfer solutions for the spectra ofunresolved, spherically symmetric, centrally heated, dusty sources. we findthat the dust thermal spectrum possesses scaling relations that provide anatural classification for a broad range of sources, from low-mass protostarsto dusty galaxies. in particular, we find that, given our assumptions, spectralenergy distributions (seds) can be characterized by two distance-independentparameters, the luminosity-to-mass ratio, $l/m$, and the surface density,$\sigma$, for a set of two functions, namely, the density profile and theopacity curve. the goal is to use seds as a diagnostic tool in inferring thelarge-scale physical conditions in protostellar and extragalactic sources, andultimately, evolutionary parameters. our approach obviates the need to use sedtemplates in the millimeter to far-infrared region of the spectrum; this is acommon practice in the extragalactic community that relies on observedcorrelations established at low redshift that may not necessarily extend tohigh redshift. further, we demarcate the limited region of parameter space inwhich density profiles can be inferred from the sed, which is of particularimport in the protostellar community as competing theories of star formationare characterized by different density profiles. the functionality of our modelis unique in that in provides for a self-consistent analytic solution that wehave validated by comparison with a well-tested radiative transfer code (dusty)to find excellent agreement with numerical results over a parameter space thatspans low-mass protostars to ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs).

astro-ph;0510410	bondi-hoyle accretion in a turbulent medium	the bondi-hoyle formula gives the approximate accretion rate onto a pointparticle accreting from a uniform medium. however, in many situations accretiononto point particles occurs from media that are turbulent rather than uniform.in this paper, we give an approximate solution to the problem of a pointparticle accreting from an ambient medium of supersonically turbulent gas.accretion in such media is bimodal, at some points resembling classicalbondi-hoyle flow, and in other cases being closer to the vorticity-dominatedaccretion flows recently studied by krumholz, mckee, &amp; klein. based on thisobservation, we develop a theoretical prediction for the accretion rate, andconfirm that our predictions are highly consistent with the results ofnumerical simulations. the distribution of accretion rates is lognormal, andthe mean accretion rate in supersonically turbulent gas can be substantiallyenhanced above the value that would be predicted by a naive application of thebondi-hoyle formula. however, it can also be suppressed by the vorticity, justas krumholz, mckee, &amp; klein found for non-supersonic vorticity-dominated flows.magnetic fields, which we have not included in these models, may furtherinhibit accretion. our results have significant implications for a numberastrophysical problems, ranging from star formation to the black holes ingalactic centers. in particular, there are likely to be significant errors inresults that assume that accretion from turbulent media occurs at theunmodified bondi-hoyle rate, or that are based on simulations that do notresolve the bondi-hoyle radius of accreting objects.

astro-ph;0510412	stars form by gravitational collapse, not competitive accretion	there are now two dominant models of how stars form: gravitational collapsetheory holds that star-forming molecular clumps, typically hundreds tothousands of solar masses in mass, fragment into gaseous cores thatsubsequently collapse to make individual stars or small multiple systems. incontrast, competitive accretion theory suggests that at birth all stars aremuch smaller than the typical stellar mass (~0.5 solar masses), and that finalstellar masses are determined by the subsequent accretion of unbound gas fromthe clump. competitive accretion models explain brown dwarfs and free-floatingplanets as protostars ejected from star-forming clumps before accreting muchmass, predicting that they should lack disks, have high velocity dispersions,and form more frequently in denser clumps. they also predict that mean stellarmass should vary within the galaxy. here we derive a simple estimate for therate of competitive accretion as a function of the star-forming environment,based partly on simulations, and determine in what types of environmentscompetitive accretion can occur. we show that no observed star-forming regionproduces significant competitive accretion, and that simulations that showcompetitive accretion do so because their properties differ from thosedetermined by observation. our result shows that stars form by gravitationalcollapse, and explains why observations have failed to confirm predictions ofthe competitive accretion scenario.

astro-ph;0510432	radiation pressure in massive star formation	stars with masses of &gt;~ 20 solar masses have short kelvin times that enablethem to reach the main sequence while still accreting from their natal clouds.the resulting nuclear burning produces a huge luminosity and a correspondinglylarge radiation pressure force on dust grains in the accreting gas. this effectmay limit the upper mass of stars that can form by accretion. indeed,simulations and analytic calculations to date have been unable to resolve themystery of how stars of 50 solar masses and up form. we present two new ideasto solve the radiation pressure problem. first, we use three-dimensionalradiation hydrodynamic adaptive mesh refinement simulations to study thecollapse of massive cores. we find that in three dimensions a configuration inwhich radiation holds up an infalling envelope is rayleigh-taylor unstable,leading radiation driven bubbles to collapse and accretion to continue. we alsopresent monte carlo radiative transfer calculations showing that the cavitiescreated by protostellar winds provides a valve that allow radiation to escapethe accreting envelope, further reducing the ability of radiation pressure toinhibit accretion.

astro-ph;0511016	on the hydrodynamic interaction of shock waves with interstellar clouds.  ii. the effect of smooth cloud boundaries on cloud destruction and cloud  turbulence	the effect of smooth cloud boundaries on the interaction of steady planarshock waves with interstellar clouds is studied using a high-resolution localamr technique with a second-order accurate axisymmetric godunov hydrodynamicscheme. a 3d calculation is also done to confirm the results of the 2d ones. weconsider an initially spherical cloud whose density distribution is flat nearthe cloud center and has a power-law profile in the cloud envelope. when anincident shock is transmitted into a smooth cloud, velocity gradients in thecloud envelope steepen the smooth density profile at the upstream side,resulting in a sharp density jump having an arc-like shape. such a ``slipsurface'' forms immediately when a shock strikes a cloud with a sharp boundary.for smoother boundaries, the formation of slip surface and therefore the onsetof hydrodynamic instabilities are delayed. since the slip surface is subject tothe kelvin-helmholtz and rayleigh-taylor instabilities, the shocked cloud iseventually destroyed in $\sim 3-10$ cloud crushing times. after complete clouddestruction, small blobs formed by fragmentation due to hydrodynamicinstabilities have significant velocity dispersions of the order of 0.1 $v_b$,where $v_b$ is the shock velocity in the ambient medium. this suggests thatturbulent motions generated by shock-cloud interaction are directly associatedwith cloud destruction. the interaction of a shock with a cold hi cloud shouldlead to the production of a spray of small hi shreds, which could be related tothe small cold clouds recently observed by stanimirovic &amp; heiles (2005). thelinewidth-size relation obtained from our 3d simulation is found to betime-dependent. a possibility for gravitational instability triggered by shockcompression is also discussed.

astro-ph;0608471	the global evolution of giant molecular clouds. i: model formulation and  quasi-equilibrium behavior	we present semi-analytic dynamical models for giant molecular clouds evolvingunder the influence of hii regions launched by newborn star clusters. incontrast to previous work, we neither assume that clouds are in virial orenergetic equilibrium, nor do we ignore the effects of star formation feedback.the clouds, which we treat as spherical, can expand and contract homologously.photoionization drives mass ejection; the recoil of cloud material both stirsturbulent motions and leads to an effective confining pressure. the balancebetween these effects and the decay of turbulent motions through isothermalshocks determines clouds' dynamical and energetic evolution. we find that forrealistic values of the rates of turbulent dissipation, photoevaporation, andenergy injection by hii regions, the massive clouds where most molecular gas inthe galaxy resides live for a few crossing times, in good agreement with recentobservational estimates that large clouds in local group galaxies surviveroughly 20-30 myr. during this time clouds remain close to equilibrium, withvirial parameters of 1-3 and column densities near 10^22 h atoms cm^-2, also inagreement with observed cloud properties. over their lives they convert 5-10%of their mass into stars, after which point most clouds are destroyed when alarge hii region unbinds them. in contrast, small clouds like those found inthe solar neighborhood only survive ~1 crossing time before being destroyed.

astro-ph;0609798	radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of collapse and fragmentation in  massive protostellar cores	we simulate the early stages of the evolution of turbulent, virialized,high-mass protostellar cores, with primary attention to how cores fragment, andwhether they form a small or large number of protostars. our simulations usethe orion adaptive mesh refinement code to follow the collapse from ~0.1 pcscales to ~10 au scales, for durations that cover the main fragmentation phase,using three-dimensional gravito-radiation hydrodynamics. we find that for awide range of initial conditions radiation feedback from accreting protostarsinhibits the formation of fragments, so that the vast majority of the collapsedmass accretes onto one or a few objects. most of the fragmentation that doesoccur takes place in massive, self-shielding disks. these are driven togravitational instability by rapid accretion, producing rapid mass and angularmomentum transport that allows most of the gas to accrete onto the central starrather than forming fragments. in contrast, a control run using the sameinitial conditions but an isothermal equation of state produces much morefragmentation, both in and out of the disk. we conclude that massive cores withobserved properties are not likely to fragment into many stars, so that, atleast at high masses, the core mass function probably determines the stellarinitial mass function. our results also demonstrate that simulations of massivestar forming regions that do not include radiative transfer, and instead relyon a barotropic equation of state or optically thin heating and cooling curves,are likely to produce misleading results.

astro-ph;9405016	accretion disk coronae in high luminosity systems	we present the results of self-consistent models of compton-heated accretiondisk coronae. the models are calculated using a new method for computingmonochromatic radiative transfer in two-dimensions. the method splits theradiation into direct and scattered components. the direct radiation iscomputed by calculating the optical depth along rays, while transfer of thescattered radiation is approximated by flux-limited diffusion. the resultingcode agrees with more accurate treatments to within 50\%, and is highlyefficient, making it practical for use in large hydrodynamic simulations. thecoronal models are used to confirm the results of earlier work, and to extendit to higher luminosities. in contrast to earlier work, which found the outerdisks to be shadowed by the inner corona at high luminosities, we find ourresults to form an almost continuous extension of the models at lowerluminosities. this is due to the presence of multiply-scattered radiation,which acts to partially offset the loss of direct radiation from the centralsource. although the analytic methods derived at lower luminosities cannot beused to derive the coronal structure for $l/l\sr{edd}\gapprox0.1$, the resultsof the models are amenable to semiempirical fits. we also discuss possibleobservational consequences of the results for coronal veiling and linefluorescence from the disk.
