0910.5475	the m31 globular cluster system: ugriz and k-band photometry and  structural parameters	we present an updated catalogue of m31 globular clusters (gcs) based onimages from the wide field camera (wfcam) on the uk infrared telescope and fromthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss). our catalogue includes new,self-consistent ugriz and k-band photometry of these clusters. we discuss thedifficulty of obtaining accurate photometry of clusters projected against m31due to small scale background structure in the galaxy. we consider the effectof this on the accuracy of our photometry and provide realistic photometricerror estimates. we investigate possible contamination in the current m31 gccatalogues using the excellent spatial resolution of these wfcam imagescombined with the sdss multicolour photometry. we identify a large populationof clusters with very blue colours. most of these have recently been proposedby other work as young clusters. we distinguish between these, and oldclusters, in the final classifications. our final catalogue includes 416 oldclusters, 156 young clusters and 373 candidate clusters. we also investigatethe structure of m31's old gcs using previously published king model fits tothese wfcam images. we demonstrate that the structure and colours of m31's oldgc system are similar to those of the milky way. one gc (b383) is found to besignificantly brighter in previous observations than observed here. weinvestigate all of the previous photometry of this gc and suggest that thisvariability appears to be genuine and short lived. we propose that the largeincrease in its luminosity my have been due to a classical nova in the gc atthe time of the previous observations in 1989.

1004.2351	large amplitude variability from the persistent ultracompact x-ray  binary in ngc 1851	using archival rxte data, we show that the ultracompact x-ray binary in ngc1851 exhibits large amplitude x-ray flux varations of more than a factor of 10on timescales of days to weeks and undergoes sustained periods of months wherethe time-averaged luminosty varies by factors of two. variations of thismagnitude and timescale have not been reported previously in other ultracompactx-ray binaries. mass transfer in ultracompact binaries is thought to be drivenby gravitational radiation and the predicted transfer rates are so high thatthe disks of ultracompact binaries with orbits as short as that of this objectshould not be susceptible to ionization instabilities. therefore thevariability characteristics we observe were unexpected, and need to beunderstood. we briefly discuss a few alternatives for producing the observedvariations in light of the fact that the viscous timescale of the disk is oforder a week, comparable to the shorter time scale variation that is observedbut much less than the longer term variation. we also discuss the implicationsfor interpretation of observations of extragalactic binaries if the type ofvariability seen in the source in ngc 1851 is typical.

1006.0449	a systematic study of low mass x-ray binaries in the m31 globular  cluster system	we investigate low mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs) in the m31 globular cluster(gc) system using data from the 2xmmi catalogue. these x-ray data are based onall publicly available xmm-newton observations of the galaxy. this new surveyprovides the most complete and homogeneous x-ray survey of m31's gcs to date,covering &gt;80% of the confirmed old clusters in the galaxy. we associate 41x-ray sources with confirmed old clusters in the m31 cluster catalogue ofpeacock et al. (2010). comparing these data with previous surveys of m31, it isfound that three of these clusters are newly identified, including a brighttransient source in the cluster b128. four additional clusters, that are notdetected in these 2xmmi data, have previously been associated with x-raysources from chandra or rosat observations. including these clusters, weidentify 45 clusters in m31 which are associated with x-ray emission. byconsidering the latest optical gc catalogues, we identify that three of thepreviously proposed x-ray clusters are likely to be background galaxies and twohave stellar profiles. we consider the properties of lmxb-hosting clusters andconfirm significant trends between the presence of an lmxb and the metallicity,luminosity and stellar collision rate of a cluster. we consider therelationship between the luminosity and stellar collision rate of a cluster andnote that lmxb hosting clusters have higher than average stellar collisionrates for their mass. our findings strongly suggest that the stellar collisionrate is the dominant parameter related to the presence of lmxbs. this isconsistent with the formation of lmxbs in gcs through dynamical interactions.

1007.4768	a variable black hole x-ray source in a ngc 1399 globular cluster	we have discovered an accreting black hole (bh) in a spectroscopicallyconfirmed globular cluster (gc) in ngc 1399 through monitoring of its x-rayactivity. the source, with a peak luminosity of l_x=2x10^39 ergs/s, reveals anorder of magnitude change in the count rate within ~10 ks in a chandraobservation. the bh resides in a metal-rich [fe/h]~0.2 globular cluster. afterrz2109 in ngc 4472 this is only the second black-hole x-ray source in a gcconfirmed via rapid x-ray variability. unlike rz2109, the x-ray spectrum ofthis bh source did not change during the period of rapid variability. inaddition to the short-term variability the source also exhibits long-termvariability. after being bright for at least a decade since 1993 within a spanof 2 years it became progressively fainter, and eventually undetectable, ormarginally detectable, in deep chandra and xmm observations. the source alsobecame harder as it faded. the characteristics of the long term variability initself provide sufficient evidence to identify the source as a bh. the longterm decline in the luminosity of this object was likely not recognized inprevious studies because the rapid variability within the bright epochsuppressed the average luminosity in that integration. the hardening of thespectrum accompanying the fading would also make this black hole sourceindistinguishable from an accreting neutron star in some epochs. therefore somelow mass x-ray binaries identified as ns accretors in snapshot studies ofnearby galaxies may also be bhs. thus the discovery of the second confirmed bhin an extragalactic gc through rapid variability at the very least suggeststhat accreting bhs in gcs are not exceedingly rare occurences.

1008.4125	a redshift for the intermediate mass black hole candidate hlx-1:  confirmation of its association with the galaxy eso 243-49	in this letter we report a spectroscopic confirmation of the association ofhlx-1, the brightest ultra-luminous x-ray source, with the galaxy eso 243-49.at the host galaxy distance of 95 mpc, the maximum observed 0.2 - 10 kevluminosity is 1.2e42 erg/s. this luminosity is ~400 times above the eddingtonlimit for a 20 msun black hole, and has been interpreted as implying anaccreting intermediate mass black hole with a mass in excess of 500 msun(assuming the luminosity is a factor of 10 above the eddington value). however,a number of other ultra-luminous x-ray sources have been later identified asbackground active galaxies or foreground sources. it has recently been claimedthat hlx-1 could be a quiescent neutron star x-ray binary at a galacticdistance of only 2.5 kpc, so a definitive association with the host galaxy iscrucial in order to confirm the nature of the object. here we report thedetection of the halpha emission line for the recently identified opticalcounterpart at a redshift consistent with that of eso 243-49. this findingdefinitively places hlx-1 inside eso 243-49, confirming the extreme maximumluminosity and strengthening the case for it containing an accretingintermediate mass black hole of more than 500 msun.

1009.2524	the ultraviolet colour of globular clusters in m31: a core density  effect?	we investigate the effect of stellar density on the ultraviolet (uv) emissionfrom m31's globular clusters (gcs). published far-uv (fuv) and near-uv (nuv)colours from galaxy evolution and explorer (galex) observations are used as aprobe into the temperature of the horizontal branch (hb) stars in theseclusters. from these data, we demonstrate a significant relationship betweenthe core density of a cluster and its fuv-nuv colour, with dense clustershaving bluer ultraviolet colours. these results are consistent with apopulation of (fuv bright) extreme-hb (ehb) stars, the production of which isrelated to the stellar density in the clusters. such a relationship may beexpected if the formation of ehb stars is enhanced in dense clusters due todynamical interactions. we also consider the contribution of low mass x-raybinaries (lmxbs) to the integrated fuv luminosity of a cluster. we note thattwo of the three metal rich clusters, identified by rey et al. 2007 as having afuv excess, are known to host lmxbs in outburst. considering the fuv luminosityof galactic lmxbs, we suggest that a single lmxb is unlikely to produce morethan 10% of the observed fuv luminosity of clusters that contain a significantpopulation of blue-hb stars.

1009.2827	fading of the x-ray flux from the black hole in the ngc 4472 globular  cluster rz 2109	we present the results of new x-ray observations of xmmu 122939.7+075333, theblack hole (bh) in the globular cluster rz 2109 in the virgo cluster galaxy ngc4472. a combination of non-detections and marginal detections in several recentswift and chandra observations show that the source has varied by at least afactor of 20 in the past 6 years, and that the variations seem not just to be"flickering." this variation could be explained with changes in the absorptioncolumn intrinsic to the source no larger than those which were previously seennear the peak of the 1989 outburst of the galactic bh x-ray binary v404 cyg.the large amplitude variations are also a natural expectation from ahierarchical triple system with kozai cycles -- the mechanism recently proposedto produce bh-white dwarf (wd) binaries in globular clusters. on the otherhand, variation by such a large factor on timescales of years, rather thancenturies, is very difficult to reconcile with the scenario in which the x-rayemission from xmmu 122939.7+075333 is due to fallback of material from atidally destroyed or detonated wd.

0709.3103	[oiii] 5007 emission from the black-hole x-ray binary in a ngc 4472  globular cluster	we present the discovery of [oiii] 5007 emission associated with the blackhole x-ray binary recently identified in a globular cluster in the virgoelliptical galaxy ngc 4472. this object is the first confirmed black-hole x-raybinary in a globular cluster. the identification of [oiii] 5007 emission fromthe black-hole hosting globular cluster is based on two independent fiberspectra obtained at the vlt with flames, which cover a wavelength range of5000-5800 angstrom at a spectral resolution of about 6000. in each of thesespectra we find an emission line at 5031.2 angstrom with an uncertainty ofseveral tenths of an angstrom. these are consistent with [oiii] 5007 emissionat the 1475 +/- 7 km/s radial velocity of the globular cluster previouslydetermined from an analysis of its absorption lines. this agreement within thesmall uncertainties argues strongly in favor of the interpretation of the lineas [oiii] 5007 emission from the black-hole hosting globular cluster. we alsofind that the emission line most likely has a velocity width of several hundredkm/s. such a velocity width rules out a planetary nebula explanation for the[oiii] 5007 emission and implicates the black hole as the source of the powerdriving the nebular emission.

1103.6016	on the reliability of proxies for globular cluster collision rates	(abridged) proxies for the stellar collision rates in globular clusters areoften used. we present comparisons between these proxies and the fullintegrated collision rate for king models. gamma, defined to be rho_0^3/2r_c^2$, where $\rho_0$ is the central cluster density, and r_c is the coreradius, is an accurate representation of the collision rate from the king modelto within about 25% for all but the least concentrated clusters. gamma_h,defined to be rho_h^3/2 r_h^2, where rho_h is the average density within thehalf-light radius, and $r_h$ is the half-light radius, is only marginallybetter correlated with the full king model collision rate than is the clusterluminosity. the two galaxies where results of king model fitting have beenreported in detail show a dearth of core-collapsed clusters relative to thatseen in the milky way, indicating that the core radii of the most concentratedclusters are probably slightly overestimated. recent work has suggested thatshallower than linear relations exist between proxies for gamma and theprobability that a cluster will contain an x-ray source; we show that there isa similarly shallow relationship between gamma and gamma_h; we also show thatmeasurement errors are likely to produce a shallower than linear relationshipeven when gamma itself is used. the evidence is thus consistent with the ideathat x-ray binary formation rates are linearly proportional to clustercollision rates. we also find, through comparison with multimass models,suggestive evidence that the retention fractions of neutron stars in globularclusters may be related to the present day concentration parameters, whichwould imply that the most concentrated clusters today were the mostconcentrated clusters at the time of their supernovae.

1104.0097	fast multiwavelength variability from jets in x-ray binaries	while jets appear as a fundamental result of accretion processes onto compactobjects in x-ray binaries, there is as yet no standard model for theirunderlying physics. the origin of the observed disk-jet coupling also remainslargely unknown. x-ray variability studies have revealed complex variability inthe accretion flow onto stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars, ontimescales as short as milliseconds. the detection of correlated broad-bandrapid time variability in the jet emission would provide valuable informationon how the variability is transferred along the jet and on the timescales ofphysical processes operating in these jets, ultimately helping to constraininternal jet physics, probe disk-jet coupling and infer accretion geometry. inrecent years there have been indirect evidences for optical fast variabilityarising from a powerful jet. however, in optical light the emission from theouter disk can strongly contaminate the jet signal, resulting in an ambiguousidentification of the source of the variability. on the other hand, at muchlonger wavelengths the variability, coming from far out in the jet, will besmeared out in time. infrared variability studies are thus ideal for looking atjet variability on the fastest possible timescales. thanks to newly availabledetectors and fast-readout modes, fast infrared and mid-infrared photometry isnow possible. this is opening a new exciting window to study the geometry andthe physics of relativistic jets and their connection with the accretion flow.here we present the first results from a large ongoing fast-timingmulti-wavelength project, showing the first unambiguous evidence for sub-secondjet variable emission. we show how this type of data already allows us to putquantitative constraints to the jet speed, geometry and physics, and discussthe great potential of new observations in the near future.

1105.2561	probing the gc-lmxb connection in ngc 1399: a wide-field study with hst  and chandra	we present a wide field study of the globular clusters/low mass x-ray binary(lmxb) connection in the giant elliptical ngc1399. the large fov of theacs/wfc, combined with the hst and chandra high resolution, allow us toconstrain the lmxb formation scenarios in elliptical galaxies. we confirm thatngc1399 has the highest lmxb fraction in gcs of all nearby elliptical galaxiesstudied so far, even though the exact value depends on galactocentric distancedue to the interplay of a differential gc vs galaxy light distribution and thegc color dependence. in fact lmxbs are preferentially hosted by bright, red gcsout to $&gt;5 r_{eff}$ of the galaxy light. the finding that gc hosting lmxbsfollow the radial distribution of their parent gc population, argues againstthe hypothesis that the external dynamical influence of the galaxy affects lmxbformation in gcs. on the other hand field lmxbs closely match the host galaxylight, thus indicating that they are originally formed in situ and not insidegcs. we measure gc structural parameters, finding that the lmxb formationlikelihood is influenced independently by mass, metallicity and gcs structuralparameters. in particular the gc central density plays a major role inpredicting which gc host accreting binaries. finally our analysis shows thatlmxbs in gcs are marginally brighter than those in the field, and in particularthe only color-confirmed gc with $l_x&gt;10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ shows novariability, which may indicate a superposition of multiple lmxbs in thesesystems.

1105.3365	testing stellar population synthesis models with sloan digital sky  survey colors of m31's globular clusters	accurate stellar population synthesis models are vital in understanding theproperties and formation histories of galaxies. in order to calibrate and testthe reliability of these models, they are often compared with observations ofstar clusters. however, relatively little work has compared these models in theugriz filters, despite the recent widespread use of this filter set. in thispaper, we compare the integrated colors of globular clusters in the sloandigital sky survey (sdss) with those predicted from commonly used simplestellar population (ssp) models. the colors are based on sdss observations ofm31's clusters and provide the largest population of star clusters withaccurate photometry available from the survey. as such, it is a unique samplewith which to compare ssp models with sdss observations. from this work, weidentify a significant offset between the ssp models and the clusters' g-rcolors, with the models predicting colors which are too red by g-r\sim0.1. thisfinding is consistent with previous observations of luminous red galaxies inthe sdss, which show a similar discrepancy. the identification of this offsetin globular clusters suggests that it is very unlikely to be due to a minoritypopulation of young stars. the recently updated ssp model of maraston &amp;stromback better represents the observed g-r colors. this model is based on theempirical miles stellar library, rather than theoretical libraries, suggestingan explanation for the g-r discrepancy.

0710.3141	clues to globular cluster evolution from multiwavelength observations of  extragalactic systems	we present a study of the globular cluster (gc) systems of nearby ellipticaland s0 galaxies at a variety of wavelengths from the x-ray to the infrared. ouranalysis shows that roughly half of the low mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs), thatare the luminous tracers of accreting neutron star or black hole systems, arein clusters. there is a surprisingly strong correlation between the lmxbfrequency and the metallicity of the gcs, with metal-rich gcs hosting threetimes as many lmxbs as metal-poor ones, and no convincing evidence of acorrelation with gc age so far. in some of the galaxies the lmxb formation ratevaries with gc color even within the red peak of the typical bimodal clustercolor distribution, providing some of the strongest evidence to date that thereare metallicity variations within the metal-rich gc peak as is expected in ahierarchical galaxy formation scenario. we also note that any analysis ofsubtler variations in gc color distributions must carefully account for bothstatistical and systematic errors. we caution that some published gccorrelations, such as the apparent 'blue-tilt' or mass-metallicity effect mightnot have a physical origin and may be caused by systematic observationalbiases.

1204.5800	limits on [oiii] 5007 emission from ngc4472's globular clusters:  constraints on planetary nebulae and ultraluminous black hole x-ray binaries  in globular clusters	we have searched for [oiii] 5007 emission in high resolution spectroscopicdata from flames/giraffe vlt observations of 174 massive globular clusters(gcs) in ngc4472. no planetary nebulae (pne) are observed in these clusters,constraining the number of pne per bolometric luminosity,\alpha&lt;0.8*10^{-7}pn/l_{\odot}. this is significantly lower than the ratepredicted from stellar evolution, if all stars produce pne. comparing ourresults to populations of pne in galaxies, we find most galaxies have a higher\alpha than these gcs (more pne per bolometric luminosity - though some massiveearly-type galaxies do have similarly low \alpha). the low \alpha required inthese gcs suggests that the number of pne per bolometric luminosity does notincrease strongly with decreasing mass or metallicity of the stellarpopulation. we find no evidence for correlations between the presence of knowngc pne and either the presence of low mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs) or thestellar interaction rates in the gcs. this, and the low \alpha observed,suggests that the formation of pne may not be enhanced in tight binary systems.these data do identify one [oiii] emission feature, this is the (previouslypublished) broad [oiii] emission from the cluster rz 2109. this emission isthought to originate from the lmxb in this cluster, which is accreting atsuper-eddington rates. the absence of any similar [oiii] emission from theother clusters favors the hypothesis that this source is a black hole lmxb,rather than a neutron star lmxb with significant geometric beaming of its x-rayemission.

1212.1461	gas depletion in primordial globular clusters due to accretion onto  stellar-mass black holes	(abridged) we consider the effect of stellar remnants on the interstellarmedium of a massive star cluster following the initial burst of star formation.we argue that accretion onto stellar-mass black holes (bhs) is an effectivemechanism for rapid gas depletion in clusters of all masses, as long as theycontain progenitor stars more massive than \gtrsim 50\msun. this scenario isattractive for the progenitor systems of present-day massive globular clusters(gcs) which likely had masses m \gtrsim 10^7\msun. in such clusters, supernovaeand stellar winds cannot provide a plausible explanation for the sudden removalof the primordial gas reservoir that is required to explain their complexchemical enrichment history.  in order to consider different regimes in the gas accretion rate ontostellar-mass bhs, we consider both the bondi-hoyle and eddingtonapproximations. for either model, our results show that the gas can besignificantly depleted within only a few tens of myrs. this process will affectthe distribution of bh masses, and may accelerate the dynamical decoupling ofthe bh population and, ultimately, their dynamical ejection. moreover, thetimescales for gas depletion are sufficiently short that the accreting bhscould significantly affect the chemistry of subsequent star formation episodes.  the gas depletion times and final mass in bhs are sensitive to the assumedmodel for the accretion rate, and to the initial mass of the most massive bhwhich, in turn, is determined by the upper mass cut-off of the stellar imf. ourresults imply that the remnant accretion history can have an important bearingon the observed present-day cluster mass-to-light ratio. in particular, we showthat an increase of the upper mass cut-off with decreasing metallicity couldcontribute to the observed anti-correlation between the mass-to-light ratio andthe metallicity of gcs.

1306.2475	very fast x-ray spectral variability in cygnus x-1: origin of the hard  and soft-state emission components	the way in which the x-ray photon index, {\gamma}, varies as a function ofcount rate is a strong diagnostic of the emission processes and emissiongeometry around accreting compact objects. here we present the results from astudy using a new, and simple, method designed to improve sensitivity to themeasurement of the variability of {\gamma} on very short time-scales.  we have measured {\gamma} in ~2 million spectra, extracted from observationswith a variety of different accretion rates and spectral states, on time-scalesas short as 16 ms for the high mass x-ray binary cygnus x-1, and havecross-correlated these measurements with the source count rate. in thesoft-state cross-correlation functions (ccfs) we find a positive peak at zerolag, stronger and narrower in the softer observations. assuming that the x-raysare produced by compton scattering of soft seed photons by high energyelectrons in a corona, these results are consistent with compton cooling of thecorona by seed photons from the inner edge of the accretion disc, thetruncation radius of which increases with increasing hardness ratio.  the ccfs produced from the hard-state observations, however, show ananti-correlation which is most easily explained by variation in the energy ofthe electrons in the corona rather than in variation of the seed photon flux.the hard-state ccfs can be decomposed into a narrow anti-correlation at zerolag, which we tentatively associate with the effects of self-comptonisation ofcyclo-synchrotron seed photons in either a hot, optically thin accretion flowor the base of the jet, and a second, asymmetric component which we suggest isproduced as a consequence of a lag between the soft and hard x-ray emission.the lag may be caused by a radial temperature/energy gradient in thecomptonising electrons combined with the inward propagation of accretion rateperturbations.

1307.8157	the fading of two transient ulxs to below the stellar mass eddington  limit	we report new detections of the two transient ultraluminous x-ray sources(ulxs) in ngc 5128 from an ongoing series of chandra observations. both sourceshave previously been observed lx (2-3)e39 erg/s, at the lower end of the ulxluminosity range. the new observations allow us to study these sources in theluminosity regime frequented by the galactic black hole x-ray binaries (bhxbs). we present the recent lightcurves of both ulxs. 1rxh j132519.8-430312(ulx1) was observed at lx ~ 1e38 erg/s, while cxou j132518.2-430304 (ulx2)declined to lx ~ 2e37 erg/s and then lingered at this luminosity for hundredsof days. we show that a reasonable upper limit for both duty cycles is 0.2,with a lower limit of 0.12 for ulx2. this duty cycle is larger than anticipatedfor transient ulxs in old stellar populations. by fitting simple spectralmodels in an observation with ~50 counts we recover properties consistent withgalactic bh xbs, but inconclusive as to the spectral state. we utilise quantileanalyses to demonstrate that the spectra are generally soft, and that in oneobservation the spectrum of ulx2 is inconsistent with a canonical hard state at&gt;95% confidence. this is contrary to what would be expected of an accretingimbh primary, which we would expect to be in the hard state at theseluminosities. we discuss the paucity of transient ulxs discovered in early-typegalaxies and excogitate explanations. we suggest that the number of transientulxs scales with the giant and sub-giant populations, rather than the totalnumber of xbs.

1308.3150	the biphase explained: understanding the asymmetries in coupled fourier  components of astronomical timeseries	we make the first attempt to estimate and interpret the biphase data forastronomical time series. the biphase is the phase of the bispectrum, which isthe fourier domain equivalent of the three-point correlation function. thebispectrum measures two key nonlinear properties of a time series -- itsreversability in time, and the symmetry about the mean of its flux distribution-- for triplets of frequencies. like other fourier methods, it is especiallyvaluable for working with time series which contain large numbers of cycles atthe period of interest, but in which the signal-to-noise at a given frequencyis small in any individual cycle, either because of measurement errors, orbecause of the contributions from signals at other frequencies. this has longbeen the case for studies of x-ray binaries, but is increasingly becoming truefor stellar variability (both intrinsic and due to planetary transits) in thekepler era. we attempt in this paper also to present some simple examples togive a more intuitive understanding of the meaning of the bispectrum toreaders, in order to help to understand where it may be applicable inastronomy. in particular, we give illustrative examples of what biphases may beshown by common astrophysical time series such as pulsars, eclipsers, stars inthe instability strip, and solar flares. we then discuss applications to thebiphase data for understanding the shapes of the quasi-periodic oscillations ofgrs 1915+105 and the coupling of the quasi-periodic oscillations to thepower-law noise in that system.

0801.4388	the low mass x-ray binary - globular cluster link and its implications	studies of nearby elliptical and s0 galaxies reveal that roughly half of thelow mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs), which are luminous tracers of accretingneutron star or black hole systems, are in clusters. there is a surprisingtendency of lmxbs to be preferentially associated with metal-rich globularclusters (gcs), with metal-rich gcs hosting three times as many lmxbs asmetal-poor ones. there is no convincing evidence of a correlation with gc ageso far. in some galaxies the lmxb formation rate varies with gc color evenwithin the metal-rich peak of the typical bimodal cluster metallicitydistribution. this provides some of the strongest evidence to date that thereare metallicity variations within the metal-rich gc peak, as is expected inhierarchical galaxy formation scenarios. we also note that apparentcorrelations between the interaction rates in gcs and lmxb frequency may not bereliable because of the uncertainties in some gc parameters. we argue in factthat there are considerable uncertainties in the integrated properties of eventhe milky way clusters that are often overlooked.

1310.2604	combined analysis of hubble and vlt photometry of the intermediate mass  black hole eso 243-49 hlx-1	in this paper we present a combined analysis of data obtained with the hubblespace telescope (hst), very large telescope (vlt), and swift x-ray telescope(xrt) of the intermediate mass black hole eso 243-49 hlx-1 that were taken 2months apart between september and november 2010. previous separate analyses ofthese data found that they were consistent with an irradiated accretion discwith contribution from either a very young or very old stellar population, andalso indicated that the optical flux of the hlx-1 counterpart could bevariable. such variability could only be attributed to a varying accretiondisc, so simultaneous analysis of all data sets should break the degeneraciesin the model fits. we thus simultaneously fit the broad-band spectral energydistribution (sed) from near-infrared through to x-ray wavelengths of the twoepochs of data with a model consisting of an irradiated accretion disc and astellar population. we show that this combined analysis rules out an oldstellar population, finding that the sed is dominated by emission from anaccretion disc with moderate reprocessing in the outer disc around anintermediate mass black hole imbedded in a young (20 myr) stellar cluster witha mass of 1e5 msun. we also place an upper limit on the mass of an additionalhidden old stellar population of 1e6 msun. however, optical r-band observationsof hlx-1 obtained with the gemini-south telescope covering part of the decayfrom a later x-ray outburst are consistent with constant optical flux,indicating that the observed variability between the hst and vlt observationscould be spurious caused by differences in the background subtraction appliedto the two optical data sets. in this scenario the contribution of the stellarpopulation, and thus the stellar mass of the cluster, may be higher (abridged).

1312.1438	observational tests of the picture of disk accretion	in this chapter, i present a summary of observational tests of the basicpicture of disk accretion. an emphasis is placed on tests relevant to blackholes, but many of the fundamental results are drawn from studies of otherclasses of systems. evidence is discussed for the basic structures of accretionflows. the cases of systems with and without accretion disks are discussed, asis the evidence that disks actually form. also discussed are the hot spotswhere accretion streams impact the disks, and the boundary layers in the innerparts of systems where the accretors are not black holes. the nature of slow,large amplitude variability is discussed. it is shown that some of the keypredictions of the classical thermal-viscous ionization instability model forproducing outbursts are in excellent agreement with observational results. itis also show that there are systems whose outbursts are extremely difficult toexplain without invoking variations in the rate of mass transfer from the donorstar into the outer accretion disk, or tidally induced variations in the masstransfer rates. finally, i briefly discuss recent quasar microlensingmeasurements which give truly independent constraints on the inner accretiongeometry around black holes.

1312.5924	black hole x-ray transients: the formation puzzle	there are 19 confirmed bh binaries in the galaxy. 16 of them are x-raytransients hosting a ~5-15 msun bh and a roche-lobe overflowing low-masscompanion. companion masses are found mostly in 0.1-1 msun mass range with peakat 0.6 msun. the formation of these systems is believed to involve a commonenvelope phase, initiated by a bh progenitor, expected to be a massive star &gt;20msun. it was realized that it may be very problematic for a low-mass companionto eject a massive envelope of the black hole progenitor. it invokedsuggestions that an intermediate-mass companion ejects the envelope, and thenis shredded by the roche-lobe overflow to its current low-mass. but thiscreates another issue; a temperature mismatch between hot models and theobserved cool low-mass donors. finally, the main driver of roche-lobe overflowthat is believed to be magnetic braking does not seem to follow anytheoretically calculated models. number of ideas were put forward to explainvarious parts of this conundrum; pre-main sequence donor nature, alternativeapproach to magnetic braking and common envelope energy was revisited. we testvarious proposals and models to show that no overall solution exists so far. weargue that common envelope physics is not crucial in the understanding bhtransient physical properties, but may affect significantly their formationrates. our failure most likely indicates that either the current evolutionarymodels for low-mass stars and magnetic braking are not realistic or that theintrinsic population of bh transients is quite different from the observed one.

1401.3405	evidence for a constant imf in early-type galaxies based on their x-ray  binary populations	a number of recent studies have proposed that the stellar initial massfunction (imf) of early type galaxies varies systematically as a function ofgalaxy mass, with higher mass galaxies having bottom heavy imfs. these bottomheavy imfs have more low-mass stars relative to the number of high mass stars,and therefore naturally result in proportionally fewer neutron stars and blackholes. in this paper, we specifically predict the variation in the number ofblack holes and neutron stars based on the power-law imf variation required toreproduce the observed mass-to-light ratio trends with galaxy mass. we thentest whether such variations are observed by studying the field low-mass x-raybinary populations (lmxbs) of nearby early-type galaxies. in these binaries, aneutron star or black hole accretes matter from a low-mass donor star. theirnumber is therefore expected to scale with the number of black holes andneutron stars present in a galaxy. we find that the number of lmxbs per k-bandlight is similar among the galaxies in our sample. these data thereforedemonstrate the uniformity of the slope of the imf from massive stars down tothose now dominating the k-band light, and are consistent with an invariantimf. our results are inconsistent with an imf which varies from akroupa/chabrier like imf for low mass galaxies to a steep power-law imf (withslope $x$=2.8) for high mass galaxies. we discuss how these observationsconstrain the possible forms of the imf variations and how future chandraobservations can enable sharper tests of the imf.

1401.5425	a new candidate wolf-rayet x-ray binary in ngc 253	we have discovered a persistent, but highly variable x-ray source in thenearby starburst galaxy ngc 253. the source varies at the level of a factor ofabout 5 in count rate on timescales of a few hours. two long observations ofthe source with chandra and xmm-newton show suggestive evidence for the sourcehaving a period of about 14-15 hours, but the time sampling in existing data isinsufficient to allow a firm determination that the source is periodic. giventhe amplitude of variation and the location in a nuclear starburst, the sourceis likely to be a wolf-rayet x-ray binary, with the tentative period being theorbital period of the system. in light of the fact that we have demonstratedthat careful examination of the variability of moderately bright x-ray sourcesin nearby galaxies can turn up candidate wolf-rayet x-ray binaries, we discussthe implications of wolf-rayet x-ray binaries for predictions of thegravitational wave source event rate, and, potentially, interpretations of theevents.

1402.3616	high proper motion x-ray binaries from the yale southern proper motion  survey	we discuss the results of cross-correlating catalogs of bright x-ray binarieswith the yale southern proper motion catalog (version 4.0). several objectsalready known to have large proper motions from hipparcos are recovered. twoadditional objects are found which show substantial proper motions, both ofwhich are unusual in their x-ray properties. one is igr j17544-2619, one of thesupergiant fast x-ray transients. assuming the quoted distances in theliterature for this source of about 3 kpc are correct, this system has apeculiar velocity of about 275 km/sec -- greater than the velocity of akeplerian orbit at its location of the galaxy, and in line with theexpectations formed from suggestions that the supergiant fast x-ray transientsshould be highly eccentric. we discuss the possibility that these objects mayhelp explain the existence of short gamma-ray bursts outside the centralregions of galaxies. the other is the source 2a~1822-371, which is a member ofthe small class of objects which are low mass x-ray binaries and long (i.e. $&gt;$100 millisecond) x-ray pulsars. this system also shows both an anomalously highx-ray luminosity and a large orbital period derivative for a system with itsorbital period, and some possible indications of an eccentric orbit. a coherentpicture can be developed by adding in the proper motion information in whichthis system formed in the perseus spiral arm of the galaxy about 3 myr ago, andretains a slightly eccentric orbit which leads to enhanced mass transfer.

1402.4863	a wind accretion model for hlx-1	the brightest ultraluminous x-ray source currently known, hlx-1, has beenobserved to undergo five outburst cycles. the periodicity of these outbursts,and their high inferred maximum accretion rates of $\sim{\rm few}\times 10^{-4}m_\odot {\rm yr}^{-1}$, naturally suggest roche lobe overflow at the pericenterof an eccentric orbit. it is, however, difficult for the roche lobe overflowmodel to explain the apparent trend of decreasing decay times over thedifferent outbursts while the integrated luminosity also drops. thus if thetrend is real rather than simply being a reflection of the complex physics ofaccretion disks, a different scenario may be necessary. we present aspeculative model in which, within the last decade, a high-mass giant star hadmost of its envelope tidally stripped by the $\sim 10^{4-5} m_\odot$ black holein hlx-1, and the remaining core plus low-mass hydrogen envelope now feeds thehole with a strong wind. this model can explain the short decay time of thedisk, and could explain the fast decrease in decay time if the wind speedincreases with time. a key prediction of this model is that there will beexcess line absorption due to the wind; our analysis does in fact find a fluxdeficit in the $\sim 0.9-1.1$ kev range that is consistent with predictions,albeit at low significance. if this idea is correct, we also expect that withintens of years the bound material from the original disruption will return andwill make hlx-1 a persistently bright source.

1402.6714	wide-field hubble space telescope observations of the globular cluster  system in ngc1399	we present a comprehensive high spatial-resolution imaging study of globularclusters (gcs) in ngc1399, the central giant elliptical cd galaxy in the fornaxgalaxy cluster, conducted with hst/acs. using a novel technique to constructdrizzled psf libraries for hst/acs data, we accurately determine the fidelityof gc structural parameter measurements from detailed artificial star clusterexperiments. the measurement of rh for the major fraction of the ngc1399 gcsystem reveals a trend of increasing rh versus galactocentric distance, rgal,out to about 10 kpc and a flat relation beyond. this trend is very similar forblue and red gcs which are found to have a mean size ratio ofrh(red)/rh(blue)=0.82+/-0.11 at all galactocentric radii from the core regionsof the galaxy out to ~40 kpc. this suggests that the size difference betweenblue and red gcs is due to internal mechanisms related to the evolution oftheir constituent stellar populations. modeling the mass density profile ofngc1399 shows that additional external dynamical mechanisms are required tolimit the gc size in the galaxy halo regions to rh~2 pc. we suggest that thismay be realized by an exotic gc orbit distribution function, an extended darkmatter halo, and/or tidal stress induced by the increased stochasticity in thedwarf halo substructure at larger rgal. we match our gc rh measurements withradial velocity data from the literature and find that compact gcs show asignificantly smaller line-of-sight velocity dispersion, &lt;sigma(cmp)&gt;=225+/-25km/s, than their extended counterparts, &lt;sigma(ext)&gt;=317+/-21 km/s. consideringthe weaker statistical correlation in the gc rh-color and the gc rh-rgalrelations, the more significant gc size-dynamics relation appears to beastrophysically more relevant and hints at the dominant influence of the gcorbit distribution function on the evolution of gc structural parameters.

1405.0618	the luminosity function of low mass x-ray binaries in the globular  cluster system of ngc 1399	we present a study of the faint-end of the x-ray luminosity function of lowmass x-ray binaries in the globular cluster system of the cd galaxy ngc 1399 byperforming a stacking experiment on 618 x-ray undetected gcs, in order toverify the presence of faint lmxbs and to constrain the faint-end slope of thegc-lmxbs xlf below the individual detection threshold of $8\times10^{37}$ ergs$^{-1}$ in the $0.5-8$ kev band. we obtain a significant x-ray detection forthe whole gc sample, as well as for the red and blue gc subpopulations,corresponding to an average luminosity per gc $&lt;l_{x}&gt;_{gc}$ of$(3.6\pm1.0)\times10^{36}\ erg\ s^{-1}$, $(6.9\pm2.1)\times10^{36}\ erg\s^{-1}$ and $(1.7\pm0.9)\times10^{36}\ erg\ s^{-1}$, respectively for all, redand blue gcs. if lmxbs in red and blue gcs have the same average intrinsicluminosity, we derive a red/blu ratio $\simeq 3$ of gcs hosting lmxbs($2.5\pm1.0$ or $4.1\pm2.5$ depending on the surveyed region); alternatively,assuming the fractions observed for brighter sources, we measure an averagex-ray luminosity of $l_{x}=(4.3\pm1.3)\times10^{37}\ erg\ s^{-1}$ and$l_{x}=(3.4\pm1.7)\times10^{37}\ erg\ s^{-1}$ per red and blue gc-lmxbsrespectively. in the assumption that the xlf follows a power-law distribution,we find that a low-luminosity break is required at $l_{x}\leq 8\times10^{37}$erg s$^{-1}$ both in the whole, as well as in the color-selected (red and blue)subsamples. given the bright-end slopes measured above the x-ray completenesslimit, this result is significant at $&gt;3\sigma$ level. our best estimates forthe faint end slope are $\beta_{l}=-1.39/-1.38/-1.36$ for all/red/bluegc-lmxbs. we also find evidence that the luminosity function becomes steeper atluminosities $l_x\gtrsim 3\times 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$, as observed in oldellipticals.

1407.4459	on the coexistence of stellar-mass and intermediate-mass black holes in  globular clusters	in this paper, we address the question: what is the probability ofstellar-mass black hole (bh) binaries co-existing in a globular cluster with anintermediate-mass black hole (imbh)? our results suggest that the detection ofone or more bh binaries can strongly constrain the presence of an imbh in mostgalactic globular clusters. more specifically, the detection of one or more bhbinaries could strongly indicate against the presence of an imbh more massivethan $\gtrsim 10^3$ m$_{\rm \odot}$ in roughly 80\% of the clusters in oursample. to illustrate this, we use a combination of n-body simulations andanalytic methods to weigh the rate of formation of bh binaries against theirejection and/or disruption rate via strong gravitational interactions with thecentral (most) massive bh.  the eventual fate of a sub-population of stellar-mass bhs (with or withoutbinary companions) is for all bhs to be ejected from the cluster by the centralimbh, leaving only the most massive stellar-mass bh behind to form a closebinary with the imbh. during each phase of evolution, we discuss the rate ofinspiral of the central bh-bh pair as a function of both the properties of thebinary and its host cluster.

1409.3248	no time for dead time: timing analysis of bright black hole binaries  with nustar	timing of high-count rate sources with the nustar small explorer missionrequires specialized analysis techniques. nustar was primarily designed forspectroscopic observations of sources with relatively low count-rates ratherthan for timing analysis of bright objects. the instrumental dead time perevent is relatively long (~2.5 msec), and varies by a few percentevent-to-event. the most obvious effect is a distortion of the white noiselevel in the power density spectrum (pds) that cannot be modeled easily withthe standard techniques due to the variable nature of the dead time. in thispaper, we show that it is possible to exploit the presence of two completelyindependent focal planes and use the cross power density spectrum to obtain agood proxy of the white noise-subtracted pds. thereafter, one can use a montecarlo approach to estimate the remaining effects of dead time, namely afrequency-dependent modulation of the variance and a frequency-independent dropof the sensitivity to variability. in this way, most of the standard timinganalysis can be performed, albeit with a sacrifice in signal to noise relativeto what would be achieved using more standard techniques. we apply thistechnique to nustar observations of the black hole binaries gx 339-4, cyg x-1and grs 1915+105.

0808.1053	low mass x-ray binaries and black holes in globular clusters	studies of nearby galaxies reveal that roughly half of their low mass x-raybinary (lmxb) populations are associated with globular clusters (gcs). we haveestablished that the lmxb hosting frequency is correlated to various gcproperties such as mass and metallicity. while the x-ray luminosities of a fewof the brightest lmxbs in gcs are consistent with the accreting object being ablack hole (bh), the only definitive way to distinguish between a black holeand multiple superposed sources in a gc is to detect variability. we havediscovered just such a variable 4x10^39 erg/s black hole x-ray binary in a lowmetallicity globular cluster in the halo of ngc 4472. the change in the x-rayspectrum between the bright and faint epochs suggests that the luminosityvariation is due to eclipsing by a warped accretion disk. the optical spectrumof this source also reveals strong, broad, [o iii] lambda 5007 and [o iii]lambda 4959 emission. an analysis of the x-ray spectrum suggests that the [oiii] lines are produced by the photoionization of a wind driven by a stellarmass black hole accreting mass at or above its eddington luminosity. as it isdynamically implausible to form an accreting stellar mass bh system in a gcwith an intermediate mass bh it appears that this massive globular cluster doesnot harbor an intermediate mass bh. the inferred mass of this bh falls wellbelow the extrapolation of the well known m_bh-sigma and m_bh-m_stellarrelations to this gc. therefore our analysis suggests that not all old, metalpoor stellar systems form black holes consistent with these relations, whichhave been established for much more massive stellar systems.

astro-ph;0204153	higher order variability properties of accreting black holes	to better constrain the emission mechanism underlying the hard state ofgalactic black hole candidates, we use high-time resolution rxte lightcurvesfor cyg x-1 and gx 399-4 to compute two higher order variability statistics forthese objects, the skewness and the fourier bispectrum. similar analyses, inparticular using the skewness measure, have been attempted before, but thephoton collection area of rxte allows us to present results of much greaterstatistical significance. the results for the two objects are qualitativelysimilar, reinforcing the idea that the same basic mechanisms are at work inboth. we find a significantly positive skewness for variability timescales lessthan $\sim 1 $ second, and a {\it negative} skewness for timescale $1- 5 $ sec.such a skewness pattern cannot be reproduced by the simplest shot variabilitymodels where individual shots have a fixed profile and intensity and areuncorrelated in time. further evidence against simple shot models comes fromthe significant detection of a non-zero bicoherence for fourier periods $\sim0.1-10$ sec, implying that significant coupling does exist between variationson these timescales. we discuss how current popular models for variability inblack hole systems can be modified to match these observations. using simulatedlight curves, we suggest that the most likely way to reproduce this observedbehavior is to have the variability come in groups of many shots, with thenumber of shots per unit time fitting an envelope function which has a rapidrise and slow decay, while the individual shots have a slow rise and a rapiddecay. invoking a finite energy reservoir that is depleted by each shot is anatural way of producing the required shot correlations.

astro-ph;0204160	short timescale correlations between line and continuum fluxes in cygnus  x-1	we present the results of 16-s time scale spectral fits for cygnus x-1 in thesoft state and in the transition state, using a comptonised blackbody plus aniron line. on these timescales, we find that that the continuum source flux canvary by factors 2-3 and that the iron line intensity appears to track thesechanges well, i.e., the inferred equivalent width of the line remains constantto within the errors. we also find no significant changes in the seed(blackbody) photon temperature, while the properties of the comptonising coronaclearly do vary, with the spectral hardness and flux generally beingcorrelated. the corona therefore seems to be the overall driver for the rapidtimescale variability observed in the soft and transition states. these resultsare consistent with the fourier resolved spectroscopy results of gilfanov etal. (2000) that indicate the iron line shows rapid flux variations while theblackbody component does not and suggest that the iron line flux in fact trackscontinuum changes down to very short timescales. we extend this work by showingthat not only the variability amplitudes, but also the {\it phases} of the ironline and continuum components are identical. we note that the short timescalevariability properties of the soft and transition states are actually not verydifferent from those of the hard state, suggesting that the corona is the maincause of rapid variability in that state too, and hence that the mechanismresponsible for the corona is similar in all three states.

astro-ph;0204235	rxte/osse fits to the hard state spectrum of cygnus x-1	we present three spectra of cygnus x-1 in the low/hard state from 3-1000 kevproduced with rxte and osse. we demonstrate that a pure thermal comptonizationmodel, with compton reflection fits the data well, with coronal temperatures ofabout 90 kev, optical depths of about 1.3, and reflection fractions of about0.25 $\times$ 2$\pi$. we find that no additional components are necessary tofit the data, although the presence of an additional non-thermal component doesresult in a marginal improvement to the goodness of the fit. two of theobservations are fit better by an almost purely non-thermal comptonizationmodel with $\gamma_{inj}$ of $\sim$ 3.2 for the electrons and the otherparameters essentially the same as for the thermal model, while the thirdobservation is also consistent with this model. observations that could breakthis degeneracy are discussed. we also demonstrate that the low reflectionparameter (i.e. $r/2\pi&lt;1$) is due to a lack of strong curvature in the 30-50kev range of the spectrum and not due to ionization effects. the spectrumchanges very little over the three weeks of the observations, in accordancewith a three week correlation timescale found in the all sky monitor data. weshow that for a purely thermal corona, the radius of the corona must be between$3\times 10^6$ and $1.5\times 10^{10}$ cm, while the radius of a hybrid coronaor a purely non-thermal corona is constrained to be between $10^8$ and $10^9$cm.

astro-ph;0206056	a test of photometric redshifts for x-ray selected sources	we test the effectiveness of photometric redshifts based upon galaxy spectraltemplate fitting for x-ray luminous objects, using a sample of 65 sourcesdetected by chandra in the field of the caltech faint galaxy redshift survey(cfgrs). we find that sources with quasar-dominated spectra (for which galaxyspectral templates are not appropriate) are easily identified, and thatphotometric redshifts are robust for the rest of the sources in our sample.specifically, for the 59 sources that are not quasar-dominated at opticalwavelengths, we find that the photometric redshift estimates have scattercomparable to the field galaxy population in this region. there is no evidencefor a trend of increasing dispersion with x-ray luminosity over the range l_x =10^39 - 5x10^43 erg/s, nor is there a trend with the ratio of x-ray to opticalflux, f_x/f_r. the practical implication of this work is that photometricredshifts should be robust for the majority (~90%) of the x-ray sources down tof_x ~ 10^-16 erg/s/cm^2 that have optical counterparts brighter than r ~ 24.furthermore, the same photometry can be easily used to identify the sources forwhich the photometric redshifts are likely to fail. photometric redshiftestimation can thus be utilized as an efficient tool in analyzing thestatistical properties of upcoming large chandra and xmm-newton data sets andidentifying interesting subsamples for further study.

astro-ph;0208370	jet-induced nucleosynthesis in misaligned microquasars	the jet axes and the orbital planes of microquasar systems are usuallyassumed to be approximately perpendicular, eventhough this is not currently anobservational requirement. on the contrary, in one of the few systems where therelative orientations are well-constrained, v4641sgr, the jet axis is known tolie not more than ~36 degrees from the binary plane. such a jet, lying close tothe binary plane, and traveling at a significant fraction of the speed of lightmay periodically impact the secondary star initiating nuclear reactions on itssurface. the integrated yield of such nuclear reactions over the age of thebinary system (less the radiative mass loss) will detectably alter theelemental abundances of the companion star. this scenario may explain theanomalously high li enhancements (roughly ~20-200 times the sun's photosphericvalue; or, equivalently, 0.1-1 times the average solar system value) seen inthe companions of some black-hole x-ray binary systems. (such enhancements arepuzzling since li nuclei are exceedingly fragile - being easily destroyed inthe interiors of stars - and li would be expected to be depleted rather thanenhanced there.) gamma-ray line signatures of the proposed process couldinclude the 2.22 mev neutron capture line as well as the 0.478 mev 7li*de-excitation line, both of which may be discernable with the integralsatellite if produced in an optically thin region during a large outburst. forvery energetic jets, a relatively narrow neutral pion gamma-decay signature at67.5 mev could also be measurable with the glast satellite. we argue that about10-20% of all microquasar systems ought to be sufficiently misaligned as to beundergoing the proposed jet-secondary impacts.

astro-ph;0209116	hysteresis in the light curves of soft x-ray transients	using pca data from the rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte), we track thespectral states of the neutron star transient system aql x-1 through a completeoutburst cycle. we find a hard-to-soft state transition during the very early,rising phase of the outburst and show that there is a hysteresis effect suchthat the transition back to the hard state occurs at a luminosity $\sim $ 5times {\it lower} than the hard-to-soft transition. this hysteresis effectrules out the propeller mechanism as the sole cause of state transitions in aqlx-1. assuming the propeller mechanism only operates at a luminosity equal to orbelow that of the observed soft-to-hard transition requires that the magneticfield of aql x-1 be less than $7\times 10^7$ gauss, the lowest neutron starfield known to date. to compare the state transition behavior of aql x-1 withthat found in transient black hole systems, we use rxte asm data to computehardness-intensity diagrams for four black hole candidate transients where theasm data should also give us state information throughout much of the outburstcycles. in all four systems, we find evidence for a hard-to-soft statetransition during the rising outburst phase and for the source staying in asoft state down to much lower luminosities during the declining phase, i.e., ahysteresis effect. this similarity suggests a common origin for statetransitions in low magnetic field neutron star and black hole systems, and thehysteresis effect rules out the ``strong adaf principle'' for determining thestate of an accretion disc. we discuss the general implications of theseobservations for current models of state transitions. we note the contrast toprevious observations of the non-transient systems cygnus x-1 and x-3 which donot show a hysteresis effect.

astro-ph;0210143	the low mass x-ray binary-globular cluster connection ii: ngc 4472 x-ray  source properties and source catalogs	we present the results of a chandra/hst study of the point sources of the ngc4472. we identify 144 x-ray sources, 72 with hst matches. the optical data show1102 sources, 829 with globular cluster colors. thirty matches are found -likely to be low mass x-ray binaries in globular clusters, while 42 have nooptical counterparts to v~25 and i~24 - likely predominantly lmxbs in the fieldstar population. thus approximately 40% of the x-ray sources are in globularclusters and ~4% of the globular clusters contain x-ray sources. the blue gcsources may have harder x-ray spectra than the red gc sources. no significantdifferences are found between the x-ray properties of the field sources and ofthe gc sources. this study, along with our previous result from paper i in thisseries on the similarity of the spatial profile of the field lmxbs, globularcluster lmxbs, and the globular clusters themselves suggest that a significantfraction of the observed low mass x-ray binaries in the field may be created ina globular cluster then ejected into the field by stellar interaction s;however, by comparing the results for ngc 4472 with those in several othergalaxies, we find tentative evidence for a correlation be tween the globularcluster specific frequency and the fraction of lmxbs in globular clusters, acorrelation which would be most easily explained if some of the field sourceswere generated in situ. we show that isolated accreting very massive blackholes are unlikely to be observable with current x-ray instrumentation and thatthese sources hence do not contaminate the lmxb population. we discuss thepossibility that several equatorial point sources may indicate the presence ofa disk wind responsible for the low radiative efficiency observed in thenucleus of this source.

astro-ph;0301091	spectral fits to the 1999 aql x-1 outburst data	we present analysis and spectral fits of the rxte data from the may/june 1999outburst of aql x-1. these data include observations in the rising portion ofthe hard state, in the soft state, and in the falling portion of the hardstate. we show that the data can be fit by a purely thermal comptonizationmodel for all the observations, but that more complicated models cannot beruled out. up to 60% of the corona's power in the soft state may be injectedinto non-thermal electrons. the soft state data show approximately constantoptical depth and coronal temperatures over a range of $\sim10$ in luminosity,while they show evidence for a reduction of seed photon temperature withreduced luminosity and indicate that the characteristic size of the seed photonemitting region is roughly constant throughout the soft state. the hard statebefore the soft state shows a higher luminosity, higher optical depth, andlower electron temperature than the hard state after the soft state. we find areduction of the hard (30-60 kev) x-ray flux during a type i burst and showthat it requires a total corona energy reservoir of less than $\sim 10^{38}$ergs.

astro-ph;0304445	some constraints on the effects of age and metallicity on the low mass  x-ray binary formation rate	we have studied the low mass x-ray binary (lmxb) populations within andoutside globular clusters (gc) in ngc 4365 and ngc 3115. using published ageand metallicity constraints from optical and ir observations of their gcs, wedo not find any evidence for an increase in the lmxb formation rate in theintermediate age cluster population of ngc 4365, as has been proposed in somescenarios of dynamical lmxb formation in gcs. the old, metal-rich, redpopulation of gcs in ngc 3115 on the other hand is {\it at least} three timesas efficient at creating lmxbs as the old, metal-poor, blue clusters. thesedata suggest that the higher formation efficiency of lmxbs in the red gcsubsystems of many galaxies is largely a consequence of their highermetallicity. a comparison of the densities of field lmxbs in different galaxiesdoes not reveal an obvious correlation with the age of the field stars aspredicted by models in which the lmxb formation rate in the field dropsmonotonically with time after an initial burst. this suggests that either asignificant fraction of the field lmxbs are created in gcs and subsequentlyinjected into the field, or the lmxb formation rate has a more complex timeevolution pattern.

astro-ph;0308036	do x-ray binary spectral state transition luminosities vary?	we tabulate the luminosities of the soft-to-hard state transitions of allx-ray binaries for which there exist good x-ray flux measurements at the timeof the transition, good distance estimates, and good mass estimates for thecompact star. we show that the state transition luminosities are at about 1-4%of the eddington rate, markedly smaller than those typically quoted in theliterature, with a mean value of 2%. only the black hole candidate groj~1655-40 and the neutron star systems aql x-1 and 4u 1728-34 have measuredstate transition luminosities inconsistent with this value at the 1$\sigma$level. gro j~1655-40, in particular, shows a state transition luminosity belowthe mean value for the other sources at the $4\sigma$ level. this result,combined with the known inner disk inclination angle (the disk is nearlyparallel to the line of sight) from gro j~1655-40's relativistic jets suggestthat the hard x-ray emitting region in gro j~1655-40 can have a velocity of nomore than about $\beta=0.68$, with a most likely value of about $\beta=0.52$,and a minimum speed of $\beta=0.45$, assuming that the variations in statetransition luminosities are solely due to relativistic beaming effects. thevariance in the state transition luminosities suggests an emission region witha velocity of $\sim0.2c$. the results are discussed in terms of differentemission models for the low/hard state. we also discuss the implications formeasuring the dimensionless viscosity parameter $\alpha$. we also find that ifits state transitions occur at typical luminosities, then gx 339-4 is likely tobe at a distance of at least 7.6 kpc, much further than typically quotedestimates.

astro-ph;0411109	upper limits on central black hole masses of globular clusters from  radio emission and a possible black hole detection in the ursa minor dwarf  galaxy	intermediate mass black holes have been alternatively predicted to be quitecommon in the centers of globular clusters or nearly impossible to form andretain in the centers of globular clusters. as it has been recently shown thatradio observations are currently the most sensitive observational technique fordetecting such objects, we have obtained new deep radio observations of omegacen, and have re-analyzed older observations of m~15 in hope of constrainingthe masses of possible black holes in their centers. in both cases, upperlimits of about 100 $\mu$jy are found at ghz frequencies. we find that if thebondi-hoyle accretion rate truly represents the spherical accretion rate onto ablack hole, then the masses of the black holes in the centers of these twogalaxies are severely constrained - with mass limits of less than about 100solar masses in both cases. if more realistic assumptions are made based onrecent work showing the bondi rate to be a severe overestimate, then the datafor omega cen are marginally consistent with a black hole of about 1/1000 thecluster's mass (i.e. about 1000 $m_\odot$). the data for m~15 then are onlymarginally consistent with previous reports of a $\sim2000$ solar mass blackhole, and we note that there is considerable hope for either detecting theblack hole or improving this upper limit with current instrumentation. finally,we discuss the possibility that the radio source near the core of the ursaminor dwarf spheroidal galaxy is a $\sim10^4$ $m_\odot$ black hole.

astro-ph;0503689	constraints on jet x-ray emission in low/hard state x-ray binaries	we show that the combination of the similarities between the x-ray propertiesof low luminosity accreting black holes and accreting neutron stars, combinedwith the differences in their radio properties argues that the x-rays fromthese systems are unlikely to be formed in the relativistic jets. specifically,the spectra of extreme island state neutron stars and low/hard state blackholes are known to be indistinguishable, while the power spectra from thesesystems are known to show only minor differences beyond what would be expectedfrom scaling the characteristic variability frequencies by the mass of thecompact object. the spectral and temporal similarities thus imply a commonemission mechanism that has only minor deviations from having all keyparameters scaling linearly with the mass of the compact object, while we showthat this is inconsistent with the observations that the radio powers ofneutron stars are typically about 30 times lower than those of black holes atthe same x-ray luminosity. we also show that an abrupt luminosity change wouldbe expected when a system makes a spectral state transition from a radiativelyinefficient jet dominated accretion flow to a thin disk dominated flow, butthat such a change is not seen.

astro-ph;0509619	an explanation for long flares from extragalactic globular cluster x-ray  sources	repeatedly flaring x-ray binaries have recently been discovered in ngc 4697by sivakoff and collaborators. we show that these flares can be explained asthe result of eccentric binaries in globular clusters which accrete morerapidly at periastron than during the rest of the binary orbit. we show thattheoretical timescales for producing eccentricities and circularising thebinaries are consistent with what is needed to produce the observed populationof flaring sources, although the circularisation timescales are highlyuncertain on both observational and theoretical grounds. this model makes twoclear theoretical predictions (1) the flares should be seen to be strictlyperiodic if adequate sampling is provided, and that periodicity should be ofapproximately 15 hours (2) this class of flaring behaviour should be seen onlyin globular cluster sources, and predominantly in the densest globularclusters. we also test the model for producing eccentricities through fly-by'sof a third star near the binary in a globular cluster against a much largerdatabase of millisecond pulsar observations than has been used in past work,and find that the theoretical cross sections for producing eccentricity inbinaries are in reasonable agreement with most of the data, provided that thepulsar ages are about $4\times10^9$ years.

astro-ph;0510311	the ages of globular clusters in ngc 4365 revisited with deep hst  observations	we present new hubble space telescope (hst)-nic3, near-infrared h-bandphotometry of globular clusters (gc) around ngc 4365 and ngc 1399 incombination with archival hst-wcpc2 and acs optical data. we find that ngc 4365has a number of globular clusters with bluer optical colors than expected fortheir red optical to near-infrared colors and an old age. the only known way toexplain these colors is with a significant population of intermediate-age (2-8gyr) clusters in this elliptical galaxy. in contrast, ngc 1399 reveals no suchpopulation. our result for ngc 1399 is in agreement with previous spectroscopicwork that suggests that its clusters have a large metallicity spread and arenearly all old. in the literature, there are various results from spectroscopicstudies of modest samples of ngc 4365 globular clusters. the spectroscopic dataallow for either the presence or absence of a significant population ofintermediate-age clusters, given the index uncertainties indicated by comparingobjects in common between these studies and the few spectroscopic candidateswith optical to near-ir colors indicative of intermediate ages. our new near-irdata of the ngc 4365 gc system with much higher signal-to-noise agrees wellwith earlier published photometry and both give strong evidence of asignificant intermediate-age component. the agreement between the photometricand spectroscopic results for ngc 1399 and other systems lends furtherconfidence to this conclusion, and to the effectiveness of the near-irtechnique.

astro-ph;0701310	a black hole in a globular cluster	globular star clusters contain thousands to millions of old stars packedwithin a region only tens of light years across. their high stellar densitiesmake it very probable that their member stars will interact or collide. therehas been considerable debate about whether black holes should exist in thesestar clusters. some theoretical work suggests that dynamical processes in thedensest inner regions of globular clusters may lead to the formation of blackholes of ~1,000 solar masses. other numerical simulations instead predict thatstellar interactions will eject most or all black holes that form in globularclusters. here we report the x-ray signature of an accreting black hole in aspectroscopically-confirmed globular cluster in the virgo cluster giantelliptical galaxy ngc 4472. this object has an x-ray luminosity of about4*10^39 ergs/sec, making it brighter than any non-black hole object can be inan old stellar population. the x-ray luminosity varies by a factor of 7 in afew hours, ruling out the possibility that the object is several neutron starssuperposed.
