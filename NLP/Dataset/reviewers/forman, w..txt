0902.3709	diffuse baryonic matter beyond 2020	the hot, diffuse gas that fills the largest overdense structures in theuniverse -- clusters of galaxies and a web of giant filaments connecting them-- provides us with tools to address a wide array of fundamental astrophysicaland cosmological questions via observations in the x-ray band. clusters aresensitive cosmological probes. to utilize their full potential for precisioncosmology in the following decades, we must precisely understand their physics-- from their cool cores stirred by jets produced by the central supermassiveblack hole (itself fed by inflow of intracluster gas), to their outskirts,where the infall of intergalactic medium (igm) drives shocks and acceleratescosmic rays. beyond the cluster confines lies the virtually unexplored warmigm, believed to contain most of the baryonic matter in the present-dayuniverse. as a depository of all the matter ever ejected from galaxies, itcarries unique information on the history of energy and metal production in theuniverse. currently planned major observatories, such as astro-h and ixo, willmake deep inroads into these areas, but to see the most interesting parts ofthe picture will require an almost science-fiction-grade facility with tens ofm^2 of effective area, subarcsecond angular resolution, a matching imagingcalorimeter and a super high-dispersion spectrograph, such as generation-x.

0902.4857	galaxy clusters and the cosmic cycle of baryons across cosmic times	we discuss the central role played by the x-ray study of hot baryons withingalaxy clusters to reconstruct the assembly of cosmic structures and to tracethe past history of star formation and accretion onto supermassive black holes(bhs). we shortly review the progress in this field contributed by the currentgeneration of x-ray telescopes. then, we focus on the outstanding scientificquestions that have been opened by observations carried out in the last yearsand that represent the legacy of chandra and xmm: (a) when and how is entropyinjected into the inter-galactic medium (igm)? (b) what is the history of metalenrichment of the igm? (c) what physical mechanisms determine the presence ofcool cores in galaxy clusters? (d) how is the appearance of proto-clusters atz~2 related to the peak of star formation activity and bh accretion? we showthat a highly efficient observational strategy to address these questions is tocarry out a large-area x-ray survey, reaching a sensitivity comparable to thatof deep chandra and xmm pointings, but extending over several thousands ofsquare degrees. a similar survey can only be carried out with a wide-fieldx-ray telescope (wfxt), which combines a high survey speed with a sharp psfacross the entire fov. we emphasize the important synergies that wfxt will havewith a number of future ground-based and space telescopes, covering from theradio to the x-ray bands. finally, we discuss the immense legacy value thatsuch a mission will have for extragalactic astronomy at large.

0904.0254	constraints on turbulent pressure in the x-ray halos of giant elliptical  galaxies from resonant scattering	the dense cores of x-ray emitting gaseous halos of large elliptical galaxieswith temperatures below about 0.8 kev show two prominent fe xvii emissionfeatures, which provide a sensitive diagnostic tool to measure the effects ofresonant scattering. we present here high-resolution spectra of five brightnearby elliptical galaxies, obtained with the reflection grating spectrometers(rgs) on the xmm-newton satellite. the spectra for the cores of four of thegalaxies show the fe xvii line at 15.01 angstrom being suppressed by resonantscattering. the data for ngc 4636 in particular allow the effects of resonantscattering to be studied in detail and to prove that the 15.01 angstrom line issuppressed only in the dense core and not in the surrounding regions. usingdeprojected density and temperature profiles for this galaxy obtained with thechandra satellite, we model the radial intensity profiles of the strongestresonance lines, accounting for the effects of resonant scattering, fordifferent values of the characteristic turbulent velocity. comparing the modelto the data, we find that the isotropic turbulent velocities on spatial scalessmaller than about 1 kpc are less than 100 km/s and the turbulent pressuresupport in the galaxy core is smaller than 5% of the thermal pressure at the90% confidence level, and less than 20% at 95% confidence. neglecting theeffects of resonant scattering in spectral fitting of the inner 2 kpc core ofngc 4636 will lead to underestimates of the chemical abundances of fe and o by~10-20%.

0905.0654	isotropic agn heating with small radio quiet bubbles in the ngc 5044  group	(abridged) a chandra observation of the x-ray bright group ngc 5044 showsthat the x-ray emitting gas has been strongly perturbed by recent outburstsfrom the central agn and also by motion of the central dominant galaxy relativeto the group gas. the ngc 5044 group hosts many small radio quiet cavities witha nearly isotropic distribution, cool filaments, a semi-circular cold front anda two-armed spiral shaped feature of cool gas. a gmrt observation of ngc 5044at 610 mhz shows the presence of extended radio emission with a "torus-shaped"morphology. the largest x-ray filament appears to thread the radio torus,suggesting that the lower entropy gas within the filament is material beinguplifted from the center of the group. the radio emission at 235 mhz is muchmore extended than the emission at 610 mhz, with little overlap between the twofrequencies. one component of the 235 mhz emission passes through the largestx-ray cavity and is then deflected just behind the cold front. a seconddetached radio lobe is also detected at 235 mhz beyond the cold front. all ofthe smaller x-ray cavities in the center of ngc 5044 are undetected in the gmrtobservations. since the smaller bubbles are probably no longer momentum drivenby the central agn, their motion will be affected by the group "weather" asthey buoyantly rise outward. hence, most of the enthalpy within the smallerbubbles will likely be deposited near the group center and isotropized by thegroup weather. the total mechanical power of the smaller radio quiet cavitiesis $p_c = 9.2 \times 10^{41}$erg s$^{-1}$ which is sufficient to suppress aboutone-half of the total radiative cooling within the central 10 kpc. this isconsistent with the presence of h$\alpha$ emission within this region whichshows that at least some of the gas is able to cool.

0909.3849	low resolution spectral templates for agns and galaxies from 0.03 -- 30  microns	we present a set of low resolution empirical sed templates for agns andgalaxies in the wavelength range from 0.03 to 30 microns based on themulti-wavelength photometric observations of the noao deep-wide field surveybootes field and the spectroscopic observations of the agn and galaxy evolutionsurvey. our training sample is comprised of 14448 galaxies in the redshiftrange 0&lt;~z&lt;~1 and 5347 likely agns in the range 0&lt;~z&lt;~5.58. we use ourtemplates to determine photometric redshifts for galaxies and agns. while theyare relatively accurate for galaxies, their accuracies for agns are a strongfunction of the luminosity ratio between the agn and galaxy components.somewhat surprisingly, the relative luminosities of the agn and its host arewell determined even when the photometric redshift is significantly in error.we also use our templates to study the mid-ir agn selection criteria developedby stern et al.(2005) and lacy et al.(2004). we find that the stern etal.(2005) criteria suffers from significant incompleteness when there is astrong host galaxy component and at z =~ 4.5, when the broad halpha emissionline is redshifted into the [3.6] band, but that it is little contaminated bylow and intermediate redshift galaxies. the lacy et al.(2004) criterion is notaffected by incompleteness at z =~ 4.5 and is somewhat less affected by stronggalaxy host components, but is heavily contaminated by low redshift starforming galaxies. finally, we use our templates to predict the color-colordistribution of sources in the upcoming wise mission and define a colorcriterion to select agns analogous to those developed for irac photometry. weestimate that in between 640,000 and 1,700,000 agns will be identified by thesecriteria, but will have serious completeness problems for z &gt;~ 3.4.

0910.0853	spectacular x-ray tails, intracluster star formation and ulxs in a3627	we present the discovery of spectacular double x-ray tails associated witheso137-001 and a possibly heated x-ray tail associated with eso137-002, bothlate-type galaxies in the closest rich cluster abell 3627. a deep chandraobservation of eso137-001 allows us for the first time to examine the spatialand spectral properties of such x-ray tails in detail. besides the known brighttail that extends to ~ 80 kpc from eso137-001, a fainter and narrower secondarytail with a similar length was surprisingly revealed. there is littletemperature variation along both tails. we also identified six x-ray pointsources as candidates of intracluster ulxs with l(0.3-10 kev) of up to2.5x10^40 erg s^-1. gemini spectra of intracluster hii regions downstream ofeso137-001 are also presented, as well as the velocity map of these hii regionsthat shows the imprint of eso137-001's disk rotation. for the first time, weunambiguously know that active star formation can happen in the cold ismstripped by icm ram pressure and it may contribute a significant amount of theintracluster light. we also report the discovery of a 40 kpc x-ray tail ofanother late-type galaxy in a3627, eso137-002. its x-ray tail seems hot, ~ 2kev (compared to ~ 0.8 kev for eso137-001's tails). we conclude that the highpressure environment around these two galaxies is important for their brightx-ray tails and the intracluster star formation.

0912.0016	polarization of x-ray lines from galaxy clusters and elliptical galaxies  - a way to measure tangential component of gas velocity	we study the impact of gas motions on the polarization of bright x-rayemission lines from the hot intercluster medium (icm). the polarizationnaturally arises from resonant scattering of emission lines owing to aquadrupole component in the radiation field produced by a centrally peaked gasdensity distribution. if differential gas motions are present then a photonemitted in one region of the cluster will be scattered in another region onlyif their relative velocities are small enough and the doppler shift of thephoton energy does not exceed the line width. this affects both the degree andthe direction of polarization. the changes in the polarization signal are inparticular sensitive to the gas motions perpendicular to the line of sight. wecalculate the expected degree of polarization for several patterns of gasmotions, including a slow inflow expected in a simple cooling flow model and afast outflow in an expanding spherical shock wave. in both cases, the effect ofnon-zero gas velocities is found to be minor. we also calculate thepolarization signal for a set of clusters, taken from large-scale structuresimulations and evaluate the impact of the gas bulk motions on the polarizationsignal. we argue that the expected degree of polarization is within reach ofthe next generation of space x-ray polarimeters.

1001.4529	the mid-ir and x-ray selected qso luminosity function	we present the j-band luminosity function of 1838 mid-infrared and x-rayselected agns in the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;5.85. these luminosity functions areconstructed by combining the deep multi-wavelength broad-band observations fromthe uv to the mid-ir of the ndwfs bootes field with the x-ray observations ofthe xbootes survey and the spectroscopic observations of the same field byages. our sample is primarily composed of irac-selected agns, targeted usingmodifications of the stern et al.(2005) criteria, complemented by mips 24microns and x-ray selected agns to alleviate the biases of irac mid-irselection against z~4.5 quasars and agns faint with respect to their hosts.this sample provides an accurate link between low and high redshift agnluminosity functions and does not suffer from the usual incompleteness ofoptical samples at z~3. we find that the space density of the brightest quasarsstrongly decreases from z=3 to z=0, while the space density of faint quasars isat least flat, and possibly increasing, over the same redshift range. at z&gt;3 weobserve a decrease in the space density of quasars of all brightnesses. wemodel the luminosity function by a double power-law and find that its evolutioncannot be described by either pure luminosity or pure density evolution, butmust be a combination of both. our best-fit model has bright and faintpower-law indices consistent with the low redshift measurements based on the2qz and 2slaq surveys and it generally agrees with the number of bright quasarspredicted by other lfs at all redshifts. if we construct the qso luminosityfunction using only the irac-selected agns, we find that the biases inherent tothis selection method significantly modify the behavior of phi*(z) only for z&lt;1and have no significant impact upon the characteristic magnitude m*_j(z).

0711.4110	width of x-ray lines in cooling flows	the dissipation of turbulent gas motions is one of the likely mechanisms thathas been proposed to heat the intracluster medium (icm) in the cores ofclusters and groups of galaxies. we consider the impact of gas motions on thewidth of the most prominent x-ray emission lines. for heavy elements (likeiron) the expected linewidth is much larger than the width due to pure thermalbroadening and the contribution due to turbulent gas motions should be easilydetected with the new generation of x-ray micro-calorimeters, such as thespektr-rg calorimeter (sxc). for instance in the perseus cluster the turbulentvelocity required to balance radiative cooling (as derived by rebusco et al.2006), would imply a width of the 6.7 kev fe line of 10-20 ev, while the purethermal broadening is ~4 ev. the radial dependence of the linewidth issensitive to i) the radial dependence of the velocity amplitude and ii) the"directionality" of the stochastic motions (e.g. isotropic turbulence orpredominantly radial gas motions). if the width of several lines,characteristic for different gas temperatures, can be measured, then it shouldbe possible to probe both the "directionality" and the amplitude of the gasmotions. moreover a measurement of the width would put a lower limit on theamount of the kinetic energy available for dissipation, giving a constraint onthe icm models.

0711.4686	measuring the non-thermal pressure in early type galaxy atmospheres: a  comparison of x-ray and optical potential profiles in m87 and ngc1399	we compare the gravitational potential profiles of the elliptical galaxiesngc 4486 (m87) and ngc 1399 (the central galaxy in the fornax cluster) derivedfrom x-ray and optical data. this comparison suggests that the combinedcontribution of cosmic rays, magnetic fields and micro-turbulence to thepressure is ~10% of the gas thermal pressure in the cores of ngc 1399 and m87,although the uncertainties in our model assumptions (e.g., spherical symmetry)are sufficiently large that the contribution could be consistent with zero. inthe absence of any other form of non-thermal pressure support, these upperbounds translate into upper limits on the magnetic field of ~10-20 mug at adistance of 1'-2' from the centers of ngc1399 and m87. we show that theseresults are consistent with the current paradigm of cool cluster cores, basedon the assumption that agn activity regulates the thermal state of the gas byinjecting energy into the intra-cluster medium. the limit of ~10-20% on theenergy density in the form of relativistic protons applies not only to thecurrent state of the gas, but essentially to the entire history of theintra-cluster medium, provided that cosmic ray protons evolve adiabatically andthat their spatial diffusion is suppressed.

1309.2635	viscous kelvin-helmholtz instabilities in highly ionised plasmas	transport coefficients in highly ionised plasmas like the intra-clustermedium (icm) are still ill-constrained. they influence various processes, amongthem the mixing at shear flow interfaces due to the kelvin-helmholtzinstability (khi). the observed structure of potential mixing layers can beused to infer the transport coefficients, but the data interpretation requiresa detailed knowledge of the long-term evolution of the khi under differentconditions. here we present the first systematic numerical study of the effectof constant and temperature-dependent isotropic viscosity over the full rangeof possible values. we show that moderate viscosities slow down the growth ofthe khi and reduce the height of the khi rolls and their rolling-up.viscosities above a critical value suppress the khi. the effect can bequantified in terms of the reynolds number re = u{\lambda}/{\nu}, where u isthe shear velocity, {\lambda} the perturbation length, and {\nu} the kinematicviscosity. we derive the critical re for constant and temperature dependent,spitzer-like viscosities, an empirical relation for the viscous khi growth timeas a function of re and density contrast, and describe special behaviours forspitzer-like viscosities and high density contrasts. finally, we brieflydiscuss several astrophysical situations where the viscous khi could play arole, i.e., sloshing cold fronts, gas stripping from galaxies, buoyantcavities, icm turbulence, and high velocity clouds.

0805.2320	chandra studies of the x-ray gas properties of galaxy groups	we present a systematic analysis of 43 galaxy groups (kt_500=0.7-2.7 kev orm_500=10^13-10^14 h^-1 m_solar, 0.012&lt;z&lt;0.12), based on chandra archival data.with robust background subtraction and modeling, we trace gas properties to&gt;r_2500 for all 43 groups. for 23 groups, gas properties can be robustlyderived to or extrapolated to r_500. we show that in spite of the largevariation in t profiles inside 0.15 r_500, the t profiles of these groups aresimilar at &gt;0.15 r_500 and are consistent with a "universal temperatureprofile". we present the entropy-t relations at six characteristics radii (30kpc - r_500), for 43 groups from this work and 14 clusters from vikhlinin etal. (2008). despite large scatter in the entropy values at &lt;0.15 r_500, theintrinsic scatter from r_2500 is much smaller and remains the same (~10%) tor_500. we also present scaling relations for the gas fraction. it appears thatthe average gas fraction between r_2500 and r_500 has no temperaturedependence, ~ 0.12 for 1 - 10 kev systems. the group gas fractions withinr_2500 are generally low and have large scatter. this work shows that thedifference of groups from hotter clusters stems from the difficulty ofcompressing group gas to inside r_2500. the large scatter of the group gasfraction within r_2500 causes large scatter in the group entropy around thecenter and may be responsible for the large scatter of the luminosities.nevertheless, the groups appear more regular and more like clusters beyondr_2500, from the results on gas fraction and entropy. therefore, mass proxiescan be extended into low mass systems. the m-t and m-y relations derived inthis work are indeed well behaved down to at least 2e13 h^-1 m_solar.

astro-ph;0002375	asymmetric, arc minute scale structures around ngc 1275	rosat hri observations show complicated substructure in the x-ray surfacebrightness within $\sim$5 arcminutes around ngc 1275 -- the dominant galaxy ofthe perseus cluster. the typical amplitude of the variations is of the order of30% of the azimuthally averaged surface brightness at a given distance from ngc1275. we argue that this substructure could be related to the activity of ngc1275 in the past. bubbles of relativistic plasma, inflated by jets, be forcedto rise by buoyancy forces, mix with the ambient intracluster medium (icm), andthen spread. overall evolution of the bubble may resemble the evolution of ahot bubble during a powerful atmospheric explosion. from a comparison of thetime scale of the bubble inflation to the rise time of the bubbles and from theobserved size of the radio lobes which displace the thermal gas, the energyrelease in the relativistic plasma by the active nucleus of ngc 1275 can beinferred. approximate modeling implies a nuclear power output of the order of$10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ averaged over the last $\sim 3~10^7$ years. this iscomparable with the energy radiated in x-rays during the same epoch. detailedmeasurements of the morphology of the x-ray structure, the temperature andabundance distributions with chandra and xmm may test this hypothesis.

astro-ph;0009199	chandra study of an overdensity of x-ray sources around two distant  (z~0.5) clusters	we present results from a chandra x-ray observatory study of the field x-raysource populations in 4 different observations: two high-redshift (z~0.5)clusters of galaxies 3c295 and rxj003033.2+261819; and two non-cluster fieldswith similar exposure time. surprisingly, the 0.5-2 kev source surfacedensities (~900-1200 sources deg**-2 at a flux limit of 1.5x10**-15 ergcm**-2s**-1) measured in an ~8'x8' area surrounding each cluster exceed by afactor of ~2 the value expected on the basis of the rosat and chandralogn-logs, with a significance of ~2 sigma each, or ~3.5 sigma when the 2fields are combined (i.e. a probability to be a statistical fluctuation of &lt;1%and &lt;0.04%, respectively). the same analysis performed on the non-clusterfields and on the outer chips of the cluster fields does not show evidence ofsuch an excess. in both cluster fields, the summed 0.5-10 kev spectrum of thedetected objects is well fitted by a power-law with gamma~1.7 similar to agnsand shows no sign of intrinsic absorption. the few (~10 out of 35) opticalidentifications available to date confirm that most of them are, as expected,agns but the number of redshifts available is too small to allow conclusions ontheir nature. we discuss possible interpretations of the overdensity in termsof: a statistical variation of cosmic background sources; a concentration ofagns and/or powerful starburst galaxies associated with the clusters; and gravitational lensing of background qso's by the galaxy clusters. allexplanations are however difficult to reconcile with the large number of excesssources detected. deeper x-ray observations and more redshifts measurements areclearly required to settle the issue.

astro-ph;0010224	a high resolution study of the hydra a cluster with chandra: comparison  of the core mass distribution with theoretical predictions and evidence for  feedback in the cooling flow	the cooling flow cluster hydra a was observed during the orbital activationand calibration phase of the chandra observatory. while the x-ray image of thecluster exhibits complex structure in the central region as reported inmcnamara $etal$, the large scale x-ray morphology of the cluster is fairlysmooth. a spectroscopic analysis of the acis data shows that the gastemperature in hydra a increases outward, reaches a maximum temperature of 4kev at 200 kpc, and then decreases slightly at larger radii. the distributionof heavy elements is nonuniform, with a factor of two increase in the fe and siabundances within the central 100 kpc. beyond the central 100 kpc the si-to-feabundance ratio is twice solar, while the si-to-fe ratio of the central excessis consistent with the solar value. one of the more surprising results is thelack of spectroscopic evidence for multiphase gas within the bulk of thecooling flow. beyond the central 30 kpc, the acis spectra are adequately fitwith a single temperature model. the addition of a cooling flow component doesnot significantly improve the fit. only within the central 30 kpc (where thecooling time is less than 1~gyr), is there spectroscopic evidence formultiphase gas. however, the spectroscopic mass deposition rate is more than afactor of 10 less than the morphologically derived mass accretion rate at 30kpc. we propose that the cooling flow region is convectively unstable due toheating by the central radio source which significantly reduces the netaccretion rate.

astro-ph;0101162	chandra x-ray observations of the 3c295 cluster core	we examine the properties of the x-ray gas in the central regions of thedistant (z=0.46), x-ray luminous cluster of galaxies surrounding the powerfulradio source 3c 295, using observations made with the chandra observatory.between radii of 50-500 kpc, the cluster gas is approximately isothermal withan emission-weighted temperature, kt ~5 kev. within the central 50 kpc radiusthis value drops to kt ~3.7 kev. the spectral and imaging chandra data indicatethe presence of a cooling flow within the central 50 kpc radius of the cluster,with a mass deposition rate of approximately 280 solar masses per year. weestimate an age for the cooling flow of 1-2 gyr, which is approximately onethousand times older than the central radio source. we find no evidence in thex-ray spectra or images for significant heating of the x-ray gas by the radiosource. we report the detection of an edge-like absorption feature in thespectrum for the central 50 kpc region, which may be due to oxygen-enricheddust grains. the implied mass in metals seen in absorption could have beenaccumulated by the cooling flow over its lifetime. combining the results on thex-ray gas density profile with radio measurements of the faraday rotationmeasure in 3c295, we estimate the magnetic field strength in the region of thecluster core to be b ~12 \mug.

astro-ph;0105224	a richness study of 14 distant x-ray clusters from the 160 square degree  survey	we have measured the surface density of galaxies toward 14 x-ray-selectedcluster candidates at redshifts greater than z=0.46, and we show that they areassociated with rich galaxy concentrations. we find that the clusters rangebetween abell richness classes 0-2, and have a most probable richness class ofone. we compare the richness distribution of our distant clusters to those forthree samples of nearby clusters with similar x-ray luminosities. we find thatthe nearby and distant samples have similar richness distributions, which showsthat clusters have apparently not evolved substantially in richness sinceredshift z =0.5. we compare the distribution of distant x-ray clusters in thel_x--richness plane to the distribution of optically-selected clusters from thepalomar distant cluster survey. the optically-selected clusters appear overlyrich for their x-ray luminosities when compared to x-ray-selected clusters.apparently, x-ray and optical surveys do not necessarily sample identical massconcentrations at large redshifts. this may indicate the existence of apopulation of optically rich clusters with anomalously low x-ray emission. morelikely, however, it reflects the tendency for optical surveys to selectunvirialized mass concentrations, as might be expected when peering alonglarge-scale filaments.

astro-ph;0110468	a textbook example of a bow shock in the merging galaxy cluster  1e0657-56	the chandra image of the merging, hot galaxy cluster 1e0657-56 reveals a bowshock propagating in front of a bullet-like gas cloud just exiting thedisrupted cluster core. this is the first clear example of a shock front in acluster. from the jumps in the gas density and temperature at the shock, themach number of the bullet-like cloud is 2-3. this corresponds to a velocity of3000-4000 km/s relative to the main cluster, which means that the cloudtraversed the core just 0.1-0.2 gyr ago. the 6-7 kev "bullet" appears to be aremnant of a dense cooling flow region once located at the center of a mergingsubcluster whose outer gas has been stripped by ram pressure. the bullet'sshape indicates that it is near the final stage of being destroyed by rampressure and gas dynamic instabilities, as the subcluster galaxies move wellahead of the cool gas. the unique simplicity of the shock front and bulletgeometry in 1e0657-56 may allow a number of interesting future measurements.the cluster's average temperature is 14-15 kev but shows large spatialvariations. the hottest gas (t&gt;20 kev) lies in the region of the radio haloenhancement and extensive merging activity involving subclusters other than thebullet.

astro-ph;0201125	cooling flows as a calorimeter of agn mechanical power	the assumption that radiative cooling of gas in the centers of galaxyclusters is approximately balanced by energy input from a central supermassiveblack hole implies that the observed x-ray luminosity of the cooling flowregion sets a lower limit on agn mechanical power. the conversion efficiency ofagn mechanical power into gas heating is uncertain, but we argue that it can behigh even in the absence of strong shocks. these arguments inevitably lead tothe conclusion that the time averaged mechanical power of agns in cooling flowsis much higher than the presently observed bolometric luminosity of theseobjects.  the energy balance between cooling losses and agn mechanical power requiressome feedback mechanism. we consider a toy model in which the accretion rateonto a black hole is set by the classic bondi formula. application of thismodel to the best studied case of m87 suggests that accretion proceeds atapproximately the bondi rate down to a few gravitational radii with most of thepower (at the level of a few percent of the rest mass) carried away by anoutflow.

astro-ph;0301482	xmm-newton observations of the perseus cluster i: the temperature and  surface brightness structure	we present preliminary results of the xmm-newton 50 ksec observation of theperseus cluster. the global east/west asymmetry of the gas temperature andsurface brightness distributions, approximately aligned with the chain ofbright galaxies, suggests an ongoing merger, although the modest degree of theobserved asymmetry certainly excludes a major merger interpretation. the chainof galaxies probably traces the filament along which accretion has started sometime ago and is continuing at the present time. a cold and dense (low entropy)cluster core like perseus is probably well "protected" against the penetrationof the gas of infalling groups and poor clusters whereas in non-cooling coreclusters like coma and a1367, infalling subclusters can penetrate deeply intothe core region. in perseus, gas associated with infalling groups may bestripped completely at the outskirts of the main cluster and only compressionwaves (shocks) may reach the central regions. we argue that the passage of sucha wave(s) can qualitatively explain the overall horseshoe shaped appearance ofthe gas temperature map (the hot horseshoe surrounds the colder, low entropycore) as well as other features of the perseus cluster core. as compressionwaves traverse the cluster core, they can induce oscillatory motion of thecluster gas which can generate multiple sharp "edges", on opposite sides or thecentral galaxy. gas motions induced by mergers may be a natural way to explainthe high frequency of "edges" seen in clusters with cooling cores.

astro-ph;0308037	chandra observations of the ngc 1550 galaxy group -- implication for the  temperature and entropy profiles of 1 kev galaxy groups	we present a detailed \chandra study of the galaxy group ngc 1550. for itstemperature (1.37$\pm$0.01 kev) and velocity dispersion ($\sim$ 300 kms$^{-1}$), the ngc 1550 group is one of the most luminous known galaxy groups(l$_{\rm bol}$ = 1.65$\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ within 200 kpc, or 0.2 \rv).we find that within $\sim 60$ kpc, where the gas cooling time is less than ahubble time, the gas temperature decreases continuously toward the center,implying the existence of a cooling core. the temperature also declines beyond$\sim$ 100 kpc (or 0.1 \rv). there is a remarkable similarity of thetemperature profile of ngc 1550 with those of two other 1 kev groups withaccurate temperature determination. the temperature begins to decline at 0.07 -0.1 \rv, while in hot clusters the decline begins at or beyond 0.2 \rv. thus,there are at least some 1 kev groups that have significantly differenttemperature profiles from those of hot clusters, which may reflect the role ofnon-gravitational processes in icm/igm evolution. ngc 1550 has no isentropiccore in its entropy profile, in contrast to the predictions of `entropy-floor'simulations. we compare the scaled entropy profiles of three 1 kev groups(including ngc 1550) and three 2 - 3 kev groups. the scaled entropy profiles of1 kev groups show much larger scatter than those of hotter systems, whichimplies varied pre-heating levels. we also discuss the mass content of the ngc1550 group and the abundance profile of heavy elements.

astro-ph;0308131	ram pressure stripping and the formation of cold fronts	chandra and xmm-newton observations of many clusters reveal sharpdiscontinuities in the surface brightness, which, unlike shocks, have lower gastemperature on the x-ray brighter side of the discontinuity. for that reasonthese features are called ``cold fronts''. it is believed that some cold frontsare formed when a subcluster merges with another cluster and the ram pressureof gas flowing outside the subcluster gives the contact discontinuity thecharacteristic curved shape. while some edges may not arise directly frommergers (e.g., a496, dupke &amp; white, 2003), this paper focuses on those whicharise as contact discontinuities between a merging subcluster and the ambientcluster gas. we argue that the flow of gas past the merging subcluster inducesslow motions inside the cloud. these motions transport gas from the centralparts of the subcluster towards the interface. since in a typical cluster orgroup (even an isothermal one) the entropy of the gas in the central regions issignificantly lower than in the outer regions, the transport of the low entropygas towards the interface and the associated adiabatic expansion makes the gastemperature immediately inside the interface lower than in any other place inthe system, thus enhancing the temperature jump across the interface and makingthe ``tip'' of the contact discontinuity cool. we illustrate this picture withthe xmm-newton gas temperature map of the a3667 cluster.

astro-ph;0309303	direct constraints on the dark matter self-interaction cross-section  from the merging galaxy cluster 1e0657-56	we compare new maps of the hot gas, dark matter, and galaxies for 1e0657-56,a cluster with a rare, high-velocity merger occurring nearly in the plane ofthe sky. the x-ray observations reveal a bullet-like gas subcluster justexiting the collision site. a prominent bow shock gives an estimate of thesubcluster velocity, 4500 km/s, which lies mostly in the plane of the sky. theoptical image shows that the gas lags behind the subcluster galaxies. theweak-lensing mass map reveals a dark matter clump lying ahead of thecollisional gas bullet, but coincident with the effectively collisionlessgalaxies. from these observations, one can directly estimate the cross-sectionof the dark matter self-interaction. that the dark matter is not fluid-like isseen directly in the x-ray -- lensing mass overlay; more quantitative limitscan be derived from three simple independent arguments. the most sensitiveconstraint, sigma/m&lt;1 cm^2/g, comes from the consistency of the subclustermass-to-light ratio with the main cluster (and universal) value, which rulesout a significant mass loss due to dark matter particle collisions. this limitexcludes most of the 0.5-5 cm^2/g interval proposed to explain the flat massprofiles in galaxies. our result is only an order-of-magnitude estimate whichinvolves a number of simplifying, but always conservative, assumptions;stronger constraints may be derived using hydrodynamic simulations of thiscluster.

astro-ph;0310145	a flux limited atlas of galaxy cluster temperature maps	an atlas of gas temperature maps is presented for a flux limited catalog ofgalaxy clusters. the sample of clusters is based on the edge et al. (1990)sample, with the inclusion of five additional clusters, all with fluxesf_x(2-10 kev)&gt;= 1.7x10**-11 ergs sec**-1 cm**-2, drawn from a variety of othersources. the temperature maps are derived from asca gis observations using acommon methodology to correct for the point-spread function and calculate thelocal projected gas temperature in such a way so as to make each clusterdirectly comparable to all others in the sample. variations in the temperaturedistribution, when present at &gt; 90% confidence, are characterized by theirseverity and extent. we find that 70% of the clusters in our sample havesignificant variations in the projected gas temperature. the presence of thesevariations increases with increasing luminosity, as does the spatial scope andseverity within a cluster. for a more limited sample we find that one third ofclusters with temperature structure have radio halos. the high rate ofoccurance of structure emphasizes the need for caution when using clusters tomeasure cosmological parameters.

astro-ph;0312576	reflections of agn outbursts in the gaseous atmosphere of m87	we combined deep chandra, rosat hri, and xmm-newton observations of m87 tostudy the impact of agn outbursts on its gaseous atmosphere. many x-rayfeatures appear to be a direct result of repetitive agn outbursts. inparticular, the x-ray cavities around the jet and counter jet are likely due tothe expansion of radio plasma, while rings of enhanced emission at 14 and 17kpc are probably shock fronts associated with outbursts that began1-2\times10^7 years ago. the effects of these shocks are also seen inbrightenings within the prominent x-ray arms. on larger scales, ~50 kpc fromthe nucleus, depressions in the surface brightness may be remnants of earlieroutbursts. as suggested for the perseus cluster (fabian et al.), our analysisof the energetics of the m87 outbursts argues that shocks may be the mostsignificant channel for agn energy input into the cooling flow atmospheres ofgalaxies, groups, and clusters. for m87, the mean power driving the shockoutburst, 2.4\times 10^{43} ergs/sec, is three times greater than the radiativelosses from the entire ``cooling flow''. thus, even in the absence of otherenergy inputs, outbursts every 3\times10^7 years are sufficient to quench theflow.

astro-ph;0405511	eso 3060170 -- a massive fossil galaxy group with a heated gas core?	we present a detailed study of the eso 3060170 galaxy group combiningchandra, xmm and optical observations. the system is found to be a fossilgalaxy group. the group x-ray emission is composed of a central dense cool core(10 kpc in radius) and an isothermal medium beyond the central 10 kpc. theregion between 10 and 50 kpc (the cooling radius) has the same temperature asthe gas from 50 kpc to 400 kpc although the gas cooling time between 10 and 50kpc (2 - 6 gyr) is shorter than the hubble time. thus, the eso 3060170 groupdoes not have a group-sized cooling core. we suggest that the group coolingcore may have been heated by a central agn outburst in the past and the smalldense cool core is the truncated relic of a previous cooling core. the chandraobservations also reveal a variety of x-ray features in the central region,including a ``finger'', an edge-like feature and a small ``tail'', all alignedalong a north-south axis, as are the galaxy light and group galaxydistribution. the proposed agn outburst may cause gas ``sloshing'' around thecenter and produce these asymmetric features. the observed flat temperatureprofile to 1/3 r_vir is not consistent with the predicted temperature profilein recent numerical simulations. we compare the entropy profile of the eso3060170 group with those of three other groups and find a flatter relation thanthat predicted by simulations involving only shock heating, s $\propto$ r$^{~0.85}$. this is direct evidence for the importance of non-gravitationalprocesses in group centers. we derive the mass profiles within 1/3 r_vir andfind the eso 3060170 group is the most massive fossil group known (1 - 2 x10$^{14}$ m$_{\odot}$). the m/l ratio of the system, ~ 150 at 0.3 r_vir, isnormal.

astro-ph;0411527	an xmm-newton view of the cluster of galaxies abell 85	we have observed the cluster of galaxies abell 85 with xmm-newton. these datahave allowed us to confirm in a previous paper the existence of the extended 4mpc filament detected by the rosat pspc in the neighbourhood of this cluster,and to determine an x-ray temperature of about about 2 kev. we now present athorough analysis of the properties of the x-ray gas in the cluster itself,including temperature and metallicity maps for the entire cluster. theseresults show that abell 85 had intense merging activity in the past and is notfully relaxed, even in the central region. we have also determined theindividual abundances for some iron-group metals and alpha-elements in variousregions; the ratios of these metallicities to the iron abundance show that bothsupernova types ia and ii must be involved in the intra-cluster gas enrichment.spectral analysis of the central region suggests a different redshift of thex-ray emitting gas compared to the mean cluster velocity derived from galaxymember redshifts. we discuss the implications of the difference between the cdgalaxy redshift, the mean galaxy redshift and the hot gas redshift, as well asthe possibility of several groups being accreted on to abell 85. finally, weobtain the dynamical mass profile and baryon fraction taking into account thenew determined temperature profile. the dynamical mass in abell 85 has a steepdensity profile, similar to the ones found in n-body simulations.

astro-ph;0501141	impact of stochastic gas motions on galaxy cluster abundance profiles	the impact of stochastic gas motions on the metal distribution in clustercore is evaluated. peaked abundance profiles are a characteristic feature ofclusters with cool cores and abundance peaks are likely associated with thebrightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) which dwell in cluster cores. the width ofthe abundance peaks is however significantly broader than the bcg lightdistribution, suggesting that some gas motions are transporting metalsoriginating from within the bcg. assuming that this process can be treated asdiffusive and using the brightest x-ray cluster a426 (perseus) as an example,we estimate that a diffusion coefficient of the order of $2 10^{29} {\rm cm^2s^{-1}}$ is needed to explain the width of the observed abundance profiles.much lower (higher) diffusion coefficients would result in too peaked (tooshallow) profiles. such diffusion could be produced by stochastic gas motionsand our analysis provides constraints on the product of their characteristicvelocity and their spatial coherence scale. we speculate that the activity ofthe supermassive black hole of the bcg is driving the stochastic gas motions incluster cores. when combined with the assumption that the dissipation of thesame motions is a key gas heating mechanism, one can estimate both the velocityand the spatial scale of such a diffusive processes.

astro-ph;0507073	supermassive black holes in elliptical galaxies: switching from very  bright to very dim	relativistic outflows (mainly observed in the radio) are a characteristicfeature of both galactic stellar mass black holes and supermassive black holes(smbhs). simultaneous radio and x-ray observations of galactic sources haveshown that the outflow is strong at low accretion rates, but it weakensdramatically or disappears completely at high accretion rates, manifestingstructural changes in the accretion flow. it is reasonable to assume that smbhsfollow the same trend. for low luminosity smbhs in nearby elliptical galaxiesand clusters, recent observations strongly suggest that the outflows play thecentral role in keeping the gas hot (mechanical feedback). if the outflow isquenched in smbhs at high accretion rates similarly to the behavior of galacticsources, then the straightforward consequence is a relatively weak feedback ofrapidly accreting smbhs. we argue that elliptical galaxies and their centralengines should then evolve through two stages. early on, the central smbhrapidly grows by accreting cooling gas at a near-eddington rate with highradiative efficiency but with weak feedback on the infalling gas. this stageterminates when the black hole has grown to a sufficiently large mass that itsfeedback (radiative and/or mechanical), despite the low gas heating efficiency,is able to suppress gas cooling. after that the system switches to a stablestate corresponding to passively evolving ellipticals, when the accretion rateand radiative efficiency are very low, but the gas heating efficiency is highand energy input from the relativistic outflow keeps the gas hot.

astro-ph;0507092	chandra sample of nearby relaxed galaxy clusters: mass, gas fraction,  and mass-temperature relation	we present gas and total mass profiles for 13 low-redshift, relaxed clustersspanning a temperature range 0.7-9 kev, derived from all available chandra dataof sufficient quality. in all clusters, gas temperature profiles are measuredto large radii (vikhlinin et al.) so that direct hydrostatic mass estimates arepossible to nearly r_500 or beyond. the gas density was accurately traced tolarger radii; its profile is not described well by a beta-model, showingcontinuous steepening with radius. the derived rho_tot profiles and theirscaling with mass generally follow the navarro-frenk-white model withconcentration expected for dark matter halos in lambdacdm cosmology. in theinner region (r&lt;0.1r_500), the gas density and temperature profiles exhibitsignificant scatter and trends with mass, but they become nearly self-similarat larger radii. correspondingly, we find that the slope of themass-temperature relation for these relaxed clusters is in good agreement withthe simple self-similar behavior, m_500 ~ t^alpha, where alpha=(1.5-1.6)+-0.1,if the gas temperatures are measured excluding the central cool cores. thenormalization of this m-t relation is significantly, by =~ 30%, higher thanmost previous x-ray determinations. we derive accurate gas mass fractionprofiles, which show increase both with radius and cluster mass. the enclosedf_gas profiles within r_2500 =~ 0.4 r_500 have not yet reached any asymptoticvalue and are still far (by a factor of 1.5-2) from the universal baryonfraction according to the cmb observations. the f_gas trends become weaker andits values closer to universal at larger radii, in particular, in sphericalshells r_2500&lt;r&lt;r_500.

astro-ph;0604583	filaments, bubbles, and weak shocks in the gaseous atmosphere of m87	we present the first results from a 500 ksec chandra acis-i observation ofm87. at soft energies (0.5-1.0 kev), we detect filamentary structuresassociated with the eastern and southwestern x-ray and radio arms. manyfilaments are spatially resolved with widths of ~300 pc. this filamentarystructure is particularly striking in the eastern arm where we suggest thefilaments are outer edges of a series of plasma-filled, buoyant bubbles whoseages differ by ~6 x 10^6 years. these x-ray structures may be influenced bymagnetic filamentation. at hard energies (3.5-7.5 kev), we detect a nearlycircular ring of outer radius 2.8' (13 kpc) which provides an unambiguoussignature of a weak shock, driven by an outburst from the smbh. the densityrise in the shock is ~1.3 (mach number, m~1.2). the observed spectral hardeningin the ring corresponds to a temperature rise t_shock / t_0 ~ 1.2, or m~1.2, inagreement with the mach number derived independently from the gas density.thus, for the first time, we detect gas temperature and density jumpsassociated with a classical shock in the atmosphere around a supermassive blackhole. we also detect two additional surface brightness edges and pressureenhancements at radii of ~0.6' and ~1'. the ~0.6' feature may beover-pressurized thermal gas surrounding the relativistic plasma in the radiococoon, the ``piston'', produced by the current episode of agn activity. theover-pressurized gas is surrounded by a cool gas shell. the ~1' feature may bean additional weak shock from a secondary outburst. in an earlier episode, the``piston'' was responsible for driving the 2.8' shock.

astro-ph;0606184	x-ray thermal coronae of galaxies in hot clusters -- ubiquity of  embedded mini cooling cores	we present a systematic investigation of x-ray thermal coronae in 157early-type galaxies and 22 late-type galaxies from a survey of 25 hot (kt&gt;3kev), nearby (z&lt;0.05) clusters, based on chandra archival data. cool galacticcoronae (kt=0.5-1.1 kev generally) have been found to be very common, &gt;60% innir selected galaxies that are more luminous than 2l*, and &gt;40% in l* &lt; l_ks &lt;2l* galaxies. these embedded coronae in hot clusters are generally smaller(1.5-4 kpc radii), less luminous (&lt;~ 10^41 erg s^-1), and less massive(10^6.5-10^8 m_solar}) than coronae in poor environments, demonstrating thenegative effects of hot cluster environments on galactic coronae. nevertheless,these coronae still manage to survive icm stripping, evaporation, rapidcooling, and powerful agn outflows, making them a rich source of informationabout gas stripping, microscopic transport, and feedback processes in thecluster environment. heat conduction across the boundary of the coronae has tobe suppressed by a factor of &gt;100, which implies the x-ray gas in early-typegalaxies is magnetized and the magnetic field plays an important role in energytransfer. stripping through transport processes (viscosity or turbulence) alsoneeds to be suppressed by at least a factor of ten at the coronal boundary...(abridged) diffuse thermal coronae have also been detected in at least 8 of 22late-type (sb or later) galaxies in our sample. evidence for enhanced starformation triggered by the icm pressure has been found in four late-typegalaxies. the fraction of luminous x-ray agn (&gt;10^41 ergs s^-1) is not small (~5%) in our sample.

astro-ph;0608491	effect of turbulent diffusion on iron abundance profiles	we compare the observed peaked iron abundance profiles for a small sample ofgroups and clusters with the predictions of a simple model involving the metalejection from the brightest galaxy and the subsequent diffusion of metals bystochastic gas motions. extending the analysis of rebusco et al. (2005) wefound that for 5 out of 8 objects in the sample an effective diffusioncoefficient of the order of $10^{29}$ cm$^{2}$ s$^{-1}$ is needed. for awm4,centaurus and awm7 the results are different suggesting substantialintermittence in the process of metal spreading across the cluster. there is noobvious dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the mass of the system.  we also estimated the characteristic velocities and the spatial scales of thegas motions needed to balance the cooling losses by the dissipation of the samegas motions. a comparison of the derived spatial scales and the sizes ofobserved radio bubbles inflated in the icm by a central active galactic nucleus(agn) suggests that the agn/icm interaction makes an important (if not adominant) contribution to the gas motions in the cluster cores.

astro-ph;0702578	x-ray emission from the stellar population in m32	using chandra observations, we study the x-ray emission of the stellarpopulation in the compact dwarf elliptical galaxy m32. the proximity of m32allows one to resolve all bright point sources with luminosities higher than8e33 erg/s in the 0.5--7 kev band. the remaining (unresolved) emission closelyfollows the galaxy's optical light and is characterized by an emissivity perunit stellar mass of ~4.3e27 erg/s/m_sun in the 2--10 kev energy band. thespectrum of the unresolved emission above a few kev smoothly joins the x-rayspectrum of the milky way's ridge measured with rxte and integral. theseresults strongly suggest that weak discrete x-ray sources (accreting whitedwarfs and active binary stars) provide the bulk of the ``diffuse'' emission ofthis gas-poor galaxy. within the uncertainties, the average x-ray properties ofthe m32 stars are consistent with those of the old stellar population in themilky way. the inferred cumulative soft x-ray (0.5--2 kev) emissivity ishowever smaller than is measured in the immediate solar vicinity in our galaxy.this difference is probably linked to the contribution of young (age &lt;1gyr)stars, which are abundant in the solar neighborhood but practically absent inm32. combining chandra, rxte and integral data, we obtain a broad-band (0.5--60kev) x-ray spectrum of the old stellar population in galaxies.

astro-ph;9707269	an investigation of cooling flows and general cluster properties from an  x-ray image deprojection analysis of 207 clusters of galaxies	we present an x-ray image deprojection analysis of einstein observatoryimaging data on 207, clusters of galaxies. the resulting radial profiles forluminosity, temperature, and electron density variations are determined fromthe cluster surface-brightness profiles according to gravitational potentialconstraints from average tx and vopt observations. this enables us to determinecooling-flow and other cluster properties, such as baryon fractions, s-zmicrowave decrements, and thomson depths. we have compiled a catalogue of thedetected cooling flows, and investigated their effects on general clusterproperties. self-consistent correlations between the cluster x-ray luminosity,temperature, and optical velocity-dispersion, are determined accounting forerrors in both dimensions of the data. these fits indicate that thetemperatures of clusters are isothermal and that they have spectral beta-valuesconsistent with unity.  we find that the x-ray lx, tx, and optical vopt relations dependsignificantly on the cooling flow mass-deposition rate, through differences inthe density profiles. clusters of similar mass-deposition rate exhibitself-similar density profiles, with larger cooling flows showing higher centraldensities. this leads to scatter in the lx related correlations within the lx,tx and vopt plane. the segregation in density leads to dispersion in`half-light radii' and baryon fractions. the baryon fraction in the cores ofcooling flow clusters appears to be higher, but all clusters appear to rise toa concordant value of greater than 10 percent at 1 mpc. thus, clusters areinconsistent with primordial nucleosynthesis baryon fraction, for a flatuniverse, of 6 percent.

astro-ph;9802130	the 6.4 kev fluorescent iron line from cluster cooling flows	for the inner region of the cooling flow (e.g. within the radius of$\sim$50--100 kpc) the thomson optical depth of the hot gas in a massivecooling flow can be as large as $\sim 0.01$. assuming that the cooling time inthe inner region is few times shorter than the life time of the cluster, thethomson depth of the accumulated cold gas can be higher accordingly (if most ofthe gas remains in the form of clouds). the illumination of the cold clouds bythe x-ray emission of the hot gas should lead to the appearance of a 6.4 keviron fluorescent line, with an equivalent width proportional to $\tau_t$. theequivalent width only weakly depends on the detailed properties of the clouds,e.g. on the column density of individual clouds, as long as the column densityis less than few $10^{23} cm^{-2}$. another effect also associated exclusivelywith the cold gas is a flux in the compton shoulder of bright x-ray emissionlines. it also scales linearly with the thomson optical depth of the cold gas.with the new generation of x-ray telescopes, combining large effective area andhigh spectral resolution, the mass of the cold gas in cooling flows (and it'sdistribution) can be measured.

astro-ph;9809336	constraining q_0 with cluster gas mass fractions: a feasibility study	as the largest gravitationally bound objects in the universe, clusters ofgalaxies may contain a fair sample of the baryonic mass fraction of theuniverse. since the gas mass fraction from the hot icm is believed to beconstant in time, the value of the cosmological deceleration parameter $q_0$can be determined by comparing the calculated gas mass fraction in nearby anddistant clusters (pen 1997). to test the potential of this method, we comparethe gas fractions derived for a sample of luminous ($l_x &gt; 10^{45} $ergs$^{-1}$), nearby clusters with those calculated for eight luminous, distant($0.3 &lt; z &lt; 0.6$) clusters using asca and rosat observations. for consistency,we evaluate the gas mass fraction at a fixed physical radius of 1 $h_{50}^{-1}$mpc (assuming $q_0=0.0$). we find a best fit value of $q_0 = 0.07$ with -0.47 &lt;q_0 &lt; 0.67 at 95% confidence. we also determine the gas fraction using themethod of evrard, metzler, &amp; navarro (1997) to find the total mass within$r_{500}$, the radius where the mean overdensity of matter is 500 times thecritical density. in simulations, this method reduces the scatter in thedetermination of gravitational mass without biasing the mean. we find that italso reduces the scatter in actual observations for nearby clusters, but not asmuch as simulations suggest. using this method, the best fit value is $q_0 =0.04$ with -0.50 &lt; q_0 &lt; 0.64. the excellent agreement between these twomethods suggests that this may be a useful technique for determining $q_0$. theconstraints on $q_0$ should improve as more distant clusters are studied andprecise temperature profiles are measured to large radii.

astro-ph;9903052	x-ray over-luminous elliptical galaxies: a new class of mass  concentrations in the universe?	we detect four isolated, x-ray over-luminous (lx&gt;2e43 [h/0.5]**-2 erg/s)elliptical galaxies (olegs) in our 160 square degree rosat pspc survey. theextent of their x-ray emission, total x-ray luminosity, total mass, and mass ofthe hot gas in these systems correspond to poor clusters, and the opticalluminosity of the central galaxies (m_r&lt;-22.5 + 5 lg h) is comparable to thatof cluster cds. however, there are no detectable fainter galaxy concentrationsaround the central elliptical. the mass-to-light ratio within the radius ofdetectable x-ray emission is in the range 250-450 msun/lsun, which is 2-3 timeshigher than typically found in clusters or groups. these objects can be theresult of galaxy merging within a group. however, their high m/l values aredifficult to explain in this scenario. olegs must have been undisturbed for avery long time, which makes them the ultimate examples of systmes inhydrostatic equilibrium. the number density of olegs is n=2.4(+3.1-1.2}x10**-7(h/0.5)**-3 mpc**-3 at the 90% confidence. they comprise 20% of all clustersand groups of comparable x-ray luminosity, and nearly all galaxies brighterthan m_r=-22.5. the estimated contirubution of olegs to the total mass densityin the universe is close to that of t&gt;7 kev clusters.

astro-ph;9905200	outer regions of the cluster gaseous atmospheres	we present a systematic study of the hot gas distribution in the outerregions of regular clusters using rosat pspc data. outside the cooling flowregion, the beta-model describes the observed surface brightness closely, butnot precisely. between 0.3 and 1 virial radii, the profiles are characterizedby a power law with slope, expressed in terms of the beta parameter, in therange beta=0.65 to 0.85. the values of beta in this range of radii aretypically larger by ~0.05 than those derived from the global fit. there is amild trend for the slope to increase with temperature, from &lt;beta&gt;~0.68 for 3kev clusters to ~0.8 for 10 kev clusters; however, even at high temperaturesthere are clusters with flat gas profiles, 0.7. our values of beta at largeradius are systematically higher, and the trend of beta with temperature isweaker than was previously found; the most likely explanation is that earlierstudies were affected by an incomplete exclusion of the central cooling flowregions. for our regular clusters, the gas distribution at large radii is quiteclose to spherically symmetric and this is shown not to be an artifact of thesample selection. the gas density profiles are very similar when compared inthe units of cluster virial radius. the radius of fixed mean gas overdensity1000 (corresponding to the dark matter overdensity 200 for omega=0.2) shows atight correlation with temperature, r~t**0.5, as expected from the virialtheorem for clusters with the universal gas fraction. at a given temperature,the rms scatter of the gas overdensity radius is only ~7% which translates intoa 20% scatter of the gas mass fraction, including statistical scatter due tomeasurement uncertainties.

0811.3654	chandra observations of the galaxy group awm 5: cool core re-heating and  thermal conduction suppression	we present an analysis of a 40 ksec chandra observation of the galaxy groupawm 5. it has a small ($\sim8$ kpc) dense cool core with a temperature of$\sim1.2$ kev and the temperature profile decreases at larger radii, from$\sim3.5$ kev just outside the core to $\sim2$ kev at $\sim300$ kpc from thecenter. the abundance distribution shows a "hole" in the central $\sim10$ kpc,where the temperature declines sharply. an abundance of at least a few timessolar is observed $\sim15-20$ kpc from the center. the deprojected electrondensity profile shows a break in slope at $\sim13$ kpc and can be fit by two$\beta$-models, with $\beta=0.72_{-0.11}^{+0.16}$ and $r_c=5.7_{-1.5}^{+1.8}$kpc, for the inner part, and $\beta=0.34\pm0.01$ and $r_c=31.3_{-5.5}^{+5.8}$kpc, for the outer part. the mass fraction of hot gas is fairly flat in thecenter and increases for $r&gt;30$ kpc up to a maximum of $\sim6.5%$ at $r\sim380$kpc. the gas cooling time within the central 30 kpc is smaller than a hubbletime, although the temperature only declines in the central $\sim8$ kpc region.this discrepancy suggests that an existing cooling core has been partiallyre-heated. in particular, thermal conduction could have been a significantsource of re-heating. in order for heating due to conduction to balance coolingdue to emission of x-rays, the conductivity must be suppressed by a largefactor (at least $\sim100$). past agn activity (still visible as a radio sourcein the center of the group) is however the most likely source that re-heatedthe central regions of awm 5.
