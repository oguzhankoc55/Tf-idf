0902.0305	the triple system hip96515: a low-mass eclipsing binary with a db white  dwarf companion	hip96515a is a double-lined spectroscopic binary with a visual companion(hip96515b) at 8.6 arcsec. it is included in the sacy catalog as a potentialyoung star and classified as an eclipsing binary in the asas catalog. we haveanalyzed spectroscopic and photometric observations of the triple system. thehigh-resolution optical spectrum of hip96515a has been used to derive a massratio, m_2/m_1, close to 0.9, with the sb2 components showing spectral types ofm1 and m2. the asas and hipparcos light-curves of hip96515a show periodicvariations with p=2.3456 days, confirming that hip96515a is an eclipsing binarywith preliminary parameters of i=89, m_aa=0.59+-0.03 msun and m_ab=0.54+-0.03msun, for the primary and secondary, respectively, at an estimated distance of42+-3 pc. this is a new eclipsing binary with component masses below 0.6 msun.multi-epoch observations of hip 96515 a&amp;b show that the system is a commonproper motion pair. the optical spectrum of hip 96515b is consistent with apure helium atmosphere (db) white dwarf. we estimate a total age (main-sequencelifetime plus cooling age) of 400 myr for the white dwarf. if hip 96515 a&amp;b arecoeval, and assuming a common age of 400 myr, the comparison of the masses ofthe eclipsing binary members with evolutionary tracks shows that they areunderestimated by ~15% and ~10%, for the primary and secondary, respectively.

0906.1799	the young, tight and low mass binary twa22ab: a new calibrator for  evolutionary models ? orbit, spectral types and temperatures determination	tight binaries discovered in young, nearby associations, with knowndistances, are ideal targets to provide dynamical mass measurements to test thephysics of evolutionary models at young ages and very low masses. we report forthe first time the binarity of twa22, possible new dynamical calibrator forevolutionary models at young ages. based on an accurate trigonometric distance(17.53 +- 0.21 pc) determination, we infer a total dynamical mass of 220 +- 21mjup for the system. from the resolved near-infrared integral-fieldspectroscopy, we find an effective temperature teff=2900+200-200 k for twa22 aand teff=2900+200-100 k for twa22 b and surface gravities between 4.0 and 5.5dex. from our photometry and a m6 +- 1 spectral type for both components, wefind luminosities of log(l/lsun)=-2.11 +- 0.13 dex and log(l/lsun)=-2.30 +-0.16 dex for twa22 a and b respectively. by comparing these parameters withevolutionary models, we question the age and the multiplicity of this system.we also discuss a possible underestimation of the mass predicted byevolutionary models for young stars close to the substellar boundary.

0906.2945	vlt/naco deep imaging survey of young, nearby austral stars	since november 2002, we have conducted the largest deep imaging survey of theyoung, nearby associations of the southern hemisphere. our goal is detectionand characterization of substellar companions at intermediate (10--500 au)physical separations. we have observed a sample of 88 stars, mostly g to mdwarfs, that we essentially identify as younger than 100 myr and closer toearth than 100 pc. the vlt/naco adaptive optics instrument of the eso paranalobservatory was used to explore the faint circumstellar environment betweentypically 0.1 and 10''. we report the discovery of 17 new close (0.1-5.0'')multiple systems. hip108195ab and c (f1iii-m6), hip84642ab (a~14 au, k0-m5) andtwa22ab (a~1.8 au; m6-m6) confirmed comoving systems. twa22ab is likely to be aastrometric calibrator that can be used to test evolutionary predictions. amongour complete sample, a total of 65 targets observed with deep coronagraphicimaging. about 240 faint candidates were detected around 36 stars. follow-upobservations vlt or hst for 83% of these stars enabled us to identify afraction of contaminants. the latest results about the substellar companions togsc08047-00232, ab pic and 2m1207, confirmed during this survey and publishedearlier, are reviewed. finally, the statistical analysis of our complete set ofcoronagraphic limits enables us to place constraints on the physical andproperties of giant planets between typically 20 and 150 au.

1001.0470	near-infrared integral-field spectra of the planet/brown dwarf companion  ab pic b	chauvin et al. 2005 imaged a co-moving companion at ~260 au from the youngstar ab pic a. evolutionary models predictions based on j h k photometry of abpic b suggested a mass of ~13 - 14 mjup, placing the object at thedeuterium-burning boundary. we used the adaptive-optics-fed integral fieldspectrograph sinfoni to obtain high quality medium-resolution spectra of ab picb (r = 1500-2000) over the 1.1 - 2.5 microns range. our analysis relies on thecomparison of our spectra to young standard templates and to the latestlibraries of synthetic spectra developed by the lyon's group. ab pic b isconfirmed to be a young early-l dwarf companion. we derive a spectral typel0-l1 and find several features indicative of intermediate gravity atmosphere.a comparison to synthetic spectra yields teff = 2000+100-300 k and log(g) = 4+- 0.5 dex. the determination of the derived atmospheric parameters of ab pic bis limited by a non-perfect match of current atmosphere spectra with ournear-infrared observations of ab pic b. the current treatment of dust settlingand missing molecular opacity lines in the atmosphere models could beresponsible. by combining the observed photometry, the surface fluxes fromatmosphere models and the known distance of the system, we derive new mass,luminosity and radius estimates of ab pic b. they confirm independently theevolutionary model predictions. we finally review the current methods used tocharacterize planetary mass companions and discuss them in the perspective offuture planet deep imaging surveys.

1004.3487	searching for sub-stellar companion into the lkca15 proto-planetary disk	recent sub-millimetric observations at the plateau de bure interferometerevidenced a cavity at ~ 46 au in radius into the proto-planetary disk aroundthe t tauri star lkca15 (v1079 tau), located in the taurus molecular cloud.additional spitzer observations have corroborated this result possiblyexplained by the presence of a massive (&gt;= 5 mjup) planetary mass, a browndwarf or a low mass star companion at about 30 au from the star. we used themost recent developments of high angular resolution and high contrast imagingto search directly for the existence of this putative companion, and to bringnew constraints on its physical and orbital properties. the naco adaptiveoptics instrument at vlt was used to observe lkca15 using a four quadrant phasemask coronagraph to access small angular separations at relatively highcontrast. a reference star at the same parallactic angle was carefully observedto optimize the quasi-static speckles subtraction (limiting our sensitivity atless than 1.0). although we do not report any positive detection of a faintcompanion that would be responsible for the observed gap in lkca15's disk(25-30 au), our detection limits start constraining its probable mass,semi-major axis and eccentricity. using evolutionary model predictions, montecarlo simulations exclude the presence of low eccentric companions with massesm &gt;= 6 m jup and orbiting at a &gt;= 100 au with significant level of confidence.for closer orbits, brown dwarf companions can be rejected with a detectionprobability of 90% down to 80 au (at 80% down to 60 au). our detection limitsdo not access the star environment close enough to fully exclude the presenceof a brown dwarf or a massive planet within the disk inner activity (i.e atless than 30 au). only, further and higher contrast observations should unveilthe existence of this putative companion inside the lkca15 disk.

1007.0682	the 2008 outburst in the young stellar system zcma: i. evidence of an  enhanced bipolar wind on the au-scale	accretion is a fundamental process in star formation. although the timeevolution of accretion remains a matter of debate, observations and modellingstudies suggest that episodic outbursts of strong accretion may dominate theformation of the protostar. observing young stellar objects during theseelevated accretion states is crucial to understanding the origin of unsteadyaccretion. zcma is a pre-main-sequence binary system composed of an embeddedherbig be star, undergoing photometric outbursts, and a fu orionis star. theherbig be component recently underwent its largest optical photometric outburstdetected so far. we aim to constrain the origin of this outburst by studyingthe emission region of the hi brackett gamma line, a powerful tracer ofaccretion/ejection processes on the au-scale in young stars. using theamber/vlti instrument at spectral resolutions of 1500 and 12 000, we performedspatially and spectrally resolved interferometric observations of the hot gasemitting across the brackett gamma emission line, during and after theoutburst. from the visibilities and differential phases, we derivecharacteristic sizes for the brackett gamma emission and spectro-astrometricmeasurements across the line, with respect to the continuum. we find that theline profile, the astrometric signal, and the visibilities are inconsistentwith the signature of either a keplerian disk or infall of matter. they are,instead, evidence of a bipolar wind, maybe partly seen through a disk holeinside the dust sublimation radius. the disappearance of the brackett gammaemission line after the outburst suggests that the outburst is related to aperiod of strong mass loss rather than a change of the extinction along theline of sight. based on these conclusions, we speculate that the origin of theoutburst is an event of enhanced mass accretion, similar to those occuring inex ors and fu ors.

1101.0432	probing the impact of stellar duplicity on the frequency of giant  planets: final results of our vlt/naco survey	if it is commonly agreed that the presence of a (moderately) close stellarcompanion affects the formation and the dynamical evolution of giant planets,the frequency of giant planets residing in binary systems separated by lessthan 100 au is unknown. to address this issue, we have conducted with vlt/nacoa systematic adaptive optics search for moderately close stellar companions to130 nearby solar-type stars. according to the data from doppler surveys, halfof our targets host at least one planetary companion, while the other half showno evidence for short-period giant planets. we present here the final resultsof our survey, which include a new series of second-epoch measurements to testfor common proper motion. the new observations confirm the physical associationof two companion candidates and prove the unbound status of many others. theseresults strengthen our former conclusion that circumstellar giant planets areslightly less frequent in binaries with mean semimajor axes between 35 and 100au than in wider systems or around single stars.

1207.5909	impact of angular differential imaging on circumstellar disk images	direct imaging of circumstellar disks requires high-contrast andhigh-resolution techniques. the angular differential imaging (adi) technique isone of them, initially developed for point-like sources but now increasinglyapplied to extended objects. this new field of application raises manyquestions because the disk images reduced with adi depend strongly on theamplitude of field rotation and the adi data reduction strategy. both of themdirectly affect the disk observable properties. our aim is to characterize theapplicability and biases of some adi data reduction strategies for differentdisk morphologies. a particular emphasis is placed on parameters mostly usedfor disks: their surface brightness, their width for a ring, and local featuressuch as gaps or asymmetries. we first present a general method for predictingand quantifying those biases. in a second step we illustrate them for somewidely used adi algorithms applied to typical debris disk morphologies:inclined rings with various inner/outer slopes and width. last, our aim is alsoto propose improvements of classical adi to limit the biases on extendedobjects. simulated disks seen under various observing conditions were used toreduce adi data and quantify the resulting biases. these conclusionscomplements previous results from naco l' real-disk images of hr4796a. adiinduces flux losses on disks. this makes this technique appropriate only forlow- to medium-inclination disks. a theoretical criterion is derived to predictthe amount of flux loss for a given disk morphology, and quantitative estimatesof the biases are given in some specific configurations. these biases alter thedisk observable properties, such as the slopes of their surface brightness ortheir radial/azimuthal extent. additionally, this work demonstrates that adican very easily create artificial features without involving astrophysicalprocesses.

1208.4557	high contrast imaging of the close environment of hd 142527 -	context. it has long been suggested that circumstellar disks surroundingyoung stars may be the signposts of planets, and still more since the recentdiscoveries of embedded substellar companions. the planet-disk interaction maycreate, according to models, large structures, gaps, rings or spirals, in thedisk. in that sense, the herbig star hd 142527 is particularly compelling as,its massive disk displays intriguing asymmetries that suggest the existence ofa dynamical peturber of unknown nature. aims. our goal was to obtain deepthermal images of the close circumstellar environment of hd 142527 to re-imagethe reported close-in structures (cavity, spiral arms) of the disk and tosearch for stellar and substellar companions that could be connected to theirpresence. results. the circumstellar environment of hd 142527 is revealed at anunprecedented spatial resolution down to the sub arcsecond level for the firsttime at 3.8 microns. our images reveal important radial and azimuthalasymmetries which invalidate an elliptical shape for the disk as previouslyproposed. it rather suggests a bright inhomogeneous spiral arm plus variousfainter spiral arms. we also confirm an inner cavity down to 30 au and twoimportant dips at position angles of 0 and 135 deg. the detection performancein angular differential imaging enables the exploration of the planetary massregime for projected physical separations as close as 40 au. the use of ourdetection map together with monte carlo simulations sets stringent constraintson the presence of planetary mass, brown dwarf or stellar companions as afunction of the semi-major axis. they severely constrain the presence ofmassive giant planets with semi-major axis beyond 50au, i.e. probably withinthe large disk's cavity that radially extends up to 145 au or even furtheroutside.

0712.1887	mid-infrared imaging of brown dwarfs in binary systems	context: brown dwarfs exhibit complex atmospheric signatures, and theirproperties depend sensitively on effective temperature, surface gravity, andmetallicity. several physical properties of brown dwarfs in binary systems canbe well inferred from the primary, and therefore allow to better constraintheir atmospheres.  aims: we want to constrain atmospheric models of brown dwarfs in binarysystems using narrow-band mid-infrared photometry.  methods: high spatial resolution and sensitivity is required to resolve thecomponents. therefore we have obtained deep mid-infrared images of four closebinary systems with brown dwarf companions using visir at the vlt in threenarrow-band filters at 8.6, 10.5 and 11.25 micron.  results: three brown dwarfs companions (gj 229b, hd 130948bc and hr 7329b)were detected at 8.6micron. hd 130948bc was also observed at 10.5micron. wefinally place upper flux limits for the other narrow band filters with nulldetections.  conclusions: our results are in general compatible with previous observationsand model expectations for these objects. for hd 130948bc, we concludephotometric variability on a significance level of 2.8sigma based on repeatedobservations. the bandpass around 10.5micron appears specifically well suitedfor variability studies, and we speculate that either inhomogeneities in theatmospheric nh3 distribution, or silicate absorption might cause itstime-variability.

"hot-start" evolutionary modelsgive a new mass of 10+3-2 mjup from teff and 9+3-2 mjup from luminosity.predictions of "cold-start" models are inconsistent with independentconstraints on the planet mass. "warm-start" models constrain the mass to m &gt;=6mjup and the initial entropies to values (sinit &gt;= 9.3kb/baryon), intermediatebetween those considered for cold/hot-start models, but likely closer to thoseof hot-start models.

1302.5367	a survey of young, nearby, and dusty stars to understand the formation  of wide-orbit giant planets	direct imaging has confirmed the existence of substellar companions on wideorbits. to understand the formation and evolution mechanisms of thesecompanions, the full population properties must be characterized. we aim atdetecting giant planet and/or brown dwarf companions around young, nearby, anddusty stars. our goal is also to provide statistics on the population of giantplanets at wide-orbits and discuss planet formation models. we report a deepsurvey of 59 stars, members of young stellar associations. the observationswere conducted with vlt/naco at l'-band (3.8 micron). we used angulardifferential imaging to reach optimal detection performance. a statisticalanalysis of about 60 % of the young and southern a-f stars closer than 65 pcallows us to derive the fraction of giant planets on wide orbits. we usegravitational instability models and planet population synthesis modelsfollowing the core-accretion scenario to discuss the occurrence of thesecompanions. we resolve and characterize new visual binaries and do not detectany new substellar companion. the survey's median detection performance reachescontrasts of 10 mag at 0.5as and 11.5 mag at 1as. we find the occurrence ofplanets to be between 10.8-24.8 % at 68 % confidence level assuming a uniformdistribution of planets in the interval 1-13 mj and 1-1000 au. considering thepredictions of formation models, we set important constraints on the occurrenceof massive planets and brown dwarf companions that would have formed by gi. weshow that this mechanism favors the formation of rather massive clump (mclump &gt;30 mj) at wide (a &gt; 40 au) orbits which might evolve dynamically and/orfragment. for the population of close-in giant planets that would have formedby ca, our survey marginally explore physical separations (&lt;20 au) and cannotconstrain this population.

1304.4130	astrophysical false positives in direct imaging for exoplanets: a white  dwarf close to a rejuvenated star	as is the case for all techniques involved in the research for exoplanets,direct imaging has to take into account the probability of so-calledastrophysical false positives, which are phenomena that mimic the signature ofobjects we are seeking. in this work we aim to present a case of a falsepositive found during a direct imaging survey conducted with vlt/naco. apromising exoplanet candidate was detected around the k2-type star hd\,8049 injuly 2010.its contrast of $\delta h$=7.05 at 1.57 arcsec allowed us to guessthe presence of a 35 \mjup companion at 50 projected au, for the nominal systemage and heliocentric distance.to check whether it was gravitationally bound tothe host star, as opposed to an unrelated background object, we re-observed thesystem one year later and concluded a high probability of a bound system. wealso used radial velocity measurements of the host star, spanning a time rangeof $\sim$ 30 yr, to constrain the companion's mass and orbital properties, aswell as to probe the host star's spectral age indicators and general spectralenergy distribution. we also obtained for the companion $u$-band imaging withefosc and $nir$ spectroscopy. combining all these information we conclude thatthe companion of hd\,8049 is a white dwarf (wd), with temperature$t_{eff}=18800 \pm 2100$ k and mass $m_{wd}=0.56 \pm 0.08 m_{\odot}$. thesignificant radial velocity trend coupled with the imaging data indicate thatthe most probable orbit has a semimajor axis of about 50 au.the discrepancybetween the age indicators suggested against a bona-fide young star. themoderately large level of chromospheric activity and fast rotation, mimickingthe properties of a young star, might be induced by the exchange of mass withthe progenitor of the wd. this example demonstrates some of the challenges indetermining accurate age estimates and identifications of faint companions.

1404.1574	search for cool extrasolar giant planets combining coronagraphy,  spectral and angular differential imaging	spectral differential imaging (sdi) is part of the observing strategy ofcurrent and on-going high-contrast imaging instruments on ground-basedtelescopes. although it improves the star light rejection, sdi attenuates thesignature of off-axis companions to the star, just like angular differentialimaging (adi). however, the attenuation due to sdi has the peculiarity of beingdependent on the spectral properties of the companions. to date, no study hasinvestigated these effects. our team is addressing this problem based on datafrom a direct imaging survey of 16 stars combining the phase-mask coronagraph,the sdi and the adi modes of vlt/naco. the objective of the survey is to searchfor cool (teff&lt;1000-1300 k) giant planets at separations of 5-10 au orbitingyoung, nearby stars (&lt;200 myr, &lt;25 pc). the data analysis did not yield anydetections. as for the estimation of the sensitivity limits of sdi-processedimages, we show that it requires a different analysis than that used inadi-based surveys. based on a method using the flux predictions of evolutionarymodels and avoiding the estimation of contrast, we determine directly the masssensitivity limits of the survey for the adi processing alone and with thecombination of sdi and adi. we show that sdi does not systematically improvethe sensitivity due to the spectral properties and self-subtraction of pointsources.

1405.1560	the vlt/naco large program to probe the occurrence of exoplanets and  brown dwarfs at wide orbits: ii- survey description, results and performances	in anticipation of the vlt/sphere planet imager guaranteed time programs, wehave conducted a preparatory survey of 86 stars between 2009 and 2013 in orderto identify new faint comoving companions to ultimately carry out acomprehensive analysis of the occurence of giant planets and brown dwarfcompanions at wide (10-2000 au) orbits around young, solar-type stars. we usednaco at vlt to explore the occurrence rate of giant planets and brown dwarfsbetween typically 0.1 and 8''. diffraction-limited observations in h-bandcombined with angular differential imaging enabled us to reach primarystar-companion brightness ratios as small as 10-6 at 1.5''. 12 systems wereresolved as new binaries, including the discovery of a new white dwarfcompanion to the star hd8049. around 34 stars, at least one companion candidatewas detected in the observed field of view. more than 400 faint sources weredetected, 90% of them in 4 crowded fields. with the exception of hd8049b, wedid not identify any new comoving companions. the survey also led to spatiallyresolved images of the thin debris disk around hd\,61005 that have beenpublished earlier. finally, considering the survey detection limits, we derivea preliminary upper limit on the frequency of giant planets for semi-major axesof [10,2000] au: typically less than 15% between 100 and 500 au, and less than10% between 50 and 500 au for exoplanets more massive than 5 mjup and 10 mjuprespectively, considering a uniform input distribution and with a confidencelevel of 95%.

1405.2536	very deep images of the innermost regions of the beta pictoris debris  disc at lp	very few debris discs have been imaged in scattered light at wavelengthsbeyond 3 microns because the thermal emission from both the sky and thetelescope is generally too strong with respect to the faint emission of adebris disc. we present here the first analysis of a high angular resolutionimage of the disc of beta pictoris at 3.8 microns. our primary objective is toprobe the innermost parts of the beta pictoris debris disc and describe itsmorphology. we performed extensive forward modelling to correct for the biasesinduced by angular differential imaging on extended objects and derive thephysical parameters of the disc. this work relies on a new analysis of sevenarchival datasets of beta pictoris observed with vlt/naco in the lp band,associated with disc forward modelling to correct for the biases induced bythat technique. the disc is detected above a 5 sigma level between 0.4" and3.8". the two extensions have a similar brightness within error bars. weconfirm an asymmetry previously observed at larger distances from the star andat shorter wavelengths: the isophotes are more widely spaced on the north-westside (above the disc apparent midplane) than on the south-east side. this isinterpreted as a small inclination of the disc combined with anisotropicscattering. our best-fit model has an inclination of 86 degrees with ananisotropic henyey- greenstein coefficient of 0.36. this interpretation issupported by a new asymmetry detected in the disc: the disc is significantlybowed towards the north-west within 3" (above the apparent midplane). we alsodetect a possible new asymmetry within 1", but at this stage we cannot discernbetween a real feature and an underlying speckle.

1407.4001	physical and orbital properties of beta pictoris b	the intermediate-mass star beta pictoris is known to be surrounded by astructured edge-on debris disk within which a gas giant planet was discoveredorbiting at 8-10 au. the physical properties of beta pic b were previouslyinferred from broad and narrow-band 0.9-4.8 microns photometry. we usedcommissioning data of the gemini planet imager (gpi) to obtain new astrometryand a low-resolution (r=35-39) j-band (1.12-1.35 microns) spectrum of theplanet. we find that the planet has passed the quadrature. we constrain itssemi-major axis to $\leq$ 10 au (90 % prob.) with a peak at 8.9+0.4-0.6 au. thejoint fit of the planet astrometry and the most recent radial velocitymeasurements of the star yields a planet's dynamical mass $\leq$ 20 mjup(greater than 96 % prob.). the extracted spectrum of beta pic b is similar tothose of young l1-1.5+1 dwarfs. we use the spectral type estimate to revise theplanet luminosity to log(l/lsun)=-3.90+-0.07. the 0.9-4.8 microns photometryand spectrum are reproduced for teff=1650+-150 k and a log g lower than 4.7 dexby 12 grids of phoenix-based and lesia atmospheric models. if we adopt the mostrecent system age estimate (21+-4 myr), the bolometric luminosity and theconstraints on the dynamical mass of beta pic b are only reproduced by warm-and hot-start tracks with initial entropies si greater than 10.5 kb/baryon.such initial conditions may result from an inefficient accretion shock and/or aplanetesimal density at formation higher than in the classical core accretionmodel. considering a younger age for the system or a conservative formationtime for beta pic b does not change these conclusions.

1505.05325	asymmetric features in the protoplanetary disk mwc758	the study of dynamical processes in protoplanetary disks is essential tounderstand planet formation. in this context, transition disks are primetargets because they are at an advanced stage of disk clearing and may harbordirect signatures of disk evolution. in this paper, we aim to derive newconstraints on the structure of the transition disk mwc 758, to detectnon-axisymmetric features and understand their origin. we obtained infraredpolarized intensity observations of the protoplanetary disk mwc 758 withsphere/vlt at 1.04 microns to resolve scattered light at a smaller innerworking angle (0.093") and a higher angular resolution (0.027") than previouslyachieved. we observe polarized scattered light within 0.53" (148 au) down tothe inner working angle (26 au) and detect distinct non-axisymmetric featuresbut no fully depleted cavity. the two small-scale spiral features that werepreviously detected with hiciao are resolved more clearly, and new features areidentified, including two that are located at previously inaccessible radiiclose to the star. we present a model based on the spiral density wave theorywith two planetary companions in circular orbits. the best model requires ahigh disk aspect ratio (h/r~0.20 at the planet locations) to account for thelarge pitch angles which implies a very warm disk. our observations reveal thecomplex morphology of the disk mwc758. to understand the origin of the detectedfeatures, the combination of high-resolution observations in the submillimeterwith alma and detailed modeling is needed.

1505.07837	search for associations containing young stars (sacy). vi. is  multiplicity universal? stellar multiplicity in the range 3-1000 au from  adaptive-optics observations	context. young loose nearby associations are unique samples of close (&lt;150pc), young (approx 5-100 myr) pre-main sequence (pms) stars. a significantnumber of members of these associations have been identified in the sacycollaboration. we can use the proximity and youth of these members toinvestigate key ingredients in star formation processes, such as multiplicity.  aims. we present the statistics of identified multiple systems from 113confirmed sacy members. we derive multiplicity frequencies, mass-ratio, andphysical separation distributions in a consistent parameter space, and compareour results to other pms populations and the field.  methods. we have obtained adaptive-optics assisted near-infrared observationswith naco (eso/vlt) and ircal (lick observatory) for at least one epoch of all113 sacy members. we have identified multiple systems using co-movingproper-motion analysis and using contamination estimates. we have exploredranges in projected separation and mass-ratio of a [3-1000 au], and q [0.1-1],respectively.  results. we have identified 31 multiple systems (28 binaries and 3 triples).we derive a multiplicity frequency (mf) of mf_(3-1000au)=28.4 +4.7, -3.9% and atriple frequency (tf) of tf_(3-1000au)=2.8 +2.5, -0.8% in the separation rangeof 3-1000 au. we do not find any evidence for an increase in the mf withprimary mass. the estimated mass-ratio of our statistical sample (withpower-law index gamma=-0.04 +/- 0.14) is consistent with a flat distribution(gamma = 0).  conclusions. we show further similarities (but also hints of discrepancies)between sacy and the taurus region: flat mass-ratio distributions andstatistically similar mf and tf values. we also compared the sacy sample to thefield (in the separation range of 19-100 au), finding that the twodistributions are indistinguishable, suggesting a similar formation mechanism.

1507.08291	discovery of a low-mass companion to the f7v star hd 984	we report the discovery of a low-mass companion to the nearby (d = 47 pc) f7vstar hd 984. the companion is detected 0.19" away from its host star in the l'band with the apodizing phase plate on naco/vlt and was recovered by l'-bandnon-coronagraphic imaging data taken a few days later. we confirm the companionis co-moving with the star with sinfoni integral field spectrograph h+k data.we present the first published data obtained with sinfoni in pupil-trackingmode. hd 984 has been argued to be a kinematic member of the 30 myr-old columbagroup, and its hr diagram position is not altogether inconsistent with being azams star of this age. by consolidating different age indicators, includingisochronal age, coronal x-ray emission, and stellar rotation, we independentlyestimate a main sequence age of 115$\pm$85 myr (95% cl) which does not rely onthis kinematic association. the mass of directly imaged companions are usuallyinferred from theoretical evolutionary tracks, which are highly dependent onthe age of the star. based on the age extrema, we demonstrate that with ourphotometric data alone, the companion's mass is highly uncertain: between 33and 96 m$_{\rm jup}$ (0.03-0.09 m$_{\odot}$) using the cond evolutionarymodels. we compare the companion's sinfoni spectrum with field dwarf spectra tobreak this degeneracy. based on the slope and shape of the spectrum in theh-band, we conclude that the companion is an m$6.0\pm0.5$ dwarf. the age of thesystem is not further constrained by the companion, as m dwarfs are poorly fiton low-mass evolutionary tracks. this discovery emphasizes the importance ofobtaining a spectrum to spectral type companions around f-stars.
