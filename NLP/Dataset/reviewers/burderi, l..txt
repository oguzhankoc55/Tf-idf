0902.2128	timing of the 2008 outburst of sax j1808.4-3658 with xmm-newton: a  stable orbital period derivative over ten years	we report on a timing analysis performed on a 62-ks long xmm-newtonobservation of the accreting millisecond pulsar sax j1808.4-3658 during thelatest x-ray outburst that started on september 21, 2008. by connecting thetime of arrivals of the pulses observed during the xmm observation, we derivedthe best-fit orbital solution and a best-fit value of the spin period for the2008 outburst. comparing this new set of orbital parameters and, in particular,the value of the time of ascending-node passage with the orbital parametersderived for the previous four x-ray outbursts of sax j1808.4-3658 observed bythe pca on board rxte, we find an updated value of the orbital periodderivative, which turns out to be $\dot p_{\rm orb} = (3.89 \pm 0.15) \times10^{-12}$ s/s. this new value of the orbital period derivative agrees with thepreviously reported value, demonstrating that the orbital period derivative inthis source has remained stable over the past ten years. although this timespanis not sufficient yet for confirming the secular evolution of the system, weagain propose an explanation of this behavior in terms of a highlynon-conservative mass transfer in this system, where the accreted mass (asderived from the x-ray luminosity during outbursts) accounts for a mere 1% ofthe mass lost by the companion.

0902.4398	searching for pulsed emission from xte j0929-314 at high radio  frequencies	the aim of this work is to search for radio signals in the quiescent phase ofaccreting millisecond x-ray pulsars, in this way giving an ultimate proof ofthe recycling model, thereby unambiguously establishing that accretingmillisecond x-ray pulsars are the progenitors of radio millisecond pulsars.  to overcome the possible free-free absorption caused by matter surroundingaccreting millisecond x-ray pulsars in their quiescence phase, we performed theobservations at high frequencies. making use of particularly precise orbitaland spin parameters obtained from x-ray observations, we carried out a deepsearch for radio-pulsed emission from the accreting millisecond x-ray pulsarxte j0929-314 in three steps, correcting for the effect of the dispersion dueto the interstellar medium, eliminating the orbital motions effects, andfinally folding the time series.  no radio pulsation is present in the analyzed data down to a limit of 68microjy at 6.4 ghz and 26 microjy at 8.5 ghz.  we discuss several mechanisms that could prevent the detection, concludingthat beaming factor and intrinsic low luminosity are the most likelyexplanations.

0904.3318	a relativistically smeared spectrum in the neutron star x-ray binary 4u  1705-44: looking at the inner accretion disc with x-ray spectroscopy	iron emission lines at 6.4-6.97 kev, identified with fluorescent kalphatransitions, are among the strongest discrete features in the x-ray band. theseare therefore one of the most powerful probes to infer the properties of theplasma in the innermost part of the accretion disc around a compact object. inthis paper we present a recent xmm observation of the x-ray burster 4u 1705-44,where we clearly detect a relativistically smeared iron line at about 6.7 kev,testifying with high statistical significance that the line profile isdistorted by high velocity motion in the accretion disc. as expected from discreflection models, we also find a significant absorption edge at about 8.3 kev;this feature appears to be smeared, and is compatible with being produced inthe same region where the iron line is produced. from the line profile wederive the physical parameters of the inner accretion disc with largeprecision. the line is identified with the kalpha transition of highly ionisediron, fe xxv, the inner disc radius is rin = (14 \pm 2) r_g (where r_g is thegravitational radius, gm/c^2), the emissivity dependence from the disc radiusis r^{-2.27 \pm 0.08}, the inclination angle with respect to the line of sightis i = (39 \pm 1) degrees. finally, the xmm spectrum shows evidences of otherlow-energy emission lines, which again appear broad and their profiles arecompatible with being produced in the same region where the iron line isproduced.

0906.3716	a ionized reflecting skin above the accretion disk of gx 349+2	the broad emission features in the fe-kalpha region of x-ray binary spectrarepresent an invaluable probe to constrain the geometry and the physics ofthese systems. several low mass x-ray binary systems (lmxbs) containing aneutron star (ns) show broad emission features between 6 and 7 kev and most ofthem are nowi nterpreted as reflection features from the inner part of anaccretion disk in analogy to those observed in the spectra of x-ray binarysystems containing a black hole candidate. the ns lmxb gx 349+2 was observed bythe xmm-newton satellite which allows, thanks to its high effective area andgood spectral resolution between 6 and 7 kev, a detailed spectroscopic study ofthe fe-kalpha region. we study the xmm data in the 0.7-10 kev energy band. thecontinuum emission is modelled by a blackbody component plus a multicoloreddisk blackbody. a very intense emission line at 1 kev, three broad emissionfeatures at 2.63, 3.32, 3.9 kev and a broader emission feature in the fe-kalpharegion are present in the residuals. the broad emission features above 2 kevcan be equivalently well fitted with gaussian profiles or relativistic smearedlines (diskline in xspec). the fe-kalpha feature is better fitted using adiskline component at 6.76 kev or two diskline components at 6.7 and 6.97 kev,respectively. the emission features are interpreted as resonant transitions ofs xvi, ar xviii, ca xix, and highly ionized iron. modelling the line profileswith relativistic smeared lines, we find that the reflecting plasma is locatedat less than 40 km from the ns, a value compatible with the inner radius of theaccretion disk inferred from the multicolored disk blackbody component ($24 \pm7$ km). the inclination angle of gx 349+2 is between 40 and 47 deg.

0708.0498	orbital evolution of an accreting millisecond pulsar: witnessing the  banquet of a hidden black widow?	we have performed a timing analysis of all the four x-ray outbursts from theaccreting millisecond pulsar sax j1808.4-3658 observed so far by the pca onboard rxte. for each of the outbursts we derived the best-fit value of the timeof ascending node passage. we find that these times follow a parabolic trend,which gives an orbital period derivative $\dot p_{\rm orb} = (3.40 \pm 0.18)\times 10^{-12}$ s/s, and a refined estimate of the orbital period, $p_{\rmorb} = 7249.156499 \pm 1.8 \times 10^{-5}$ s (reference epoch $t_0 =50914.8099$ mjd). this derivative is positive, suggesting a degenerate or fullyconvective companion star, but is more than one order of magnitude higher thanwhat is expected from secular evolution driven by angular momentum lossescaused by gravitational radiation under the hypothesis of conservative masstransfer. using simple considerations on the angular momentum of the system, wepropose an explanation of this puzzling result assuming that during x-rayquiescence the source is ejecting matter (and angular momentum) from the innerlagrangian point. we have also verified that this behavior is in agreement witha possible secular evolution of the system under the hypothesis of highlynon-conservative mass transfer. in this case, we find stringent constraints onthe masses of the two components of the binary system and its inclination. theproposed orbital evolution indicates that in this kind of sources the neutronstar is capable to efficiently ablate the companion star, suggesting that thiskind of objects are part of the population of the so-called black widowpulsars, still visible in x-rays during transient mass accretion episodes.

0708.0534	precise determination of orbital parameters in system with slowly  drifting phases: application to the case of xte j1807-294	we describe a timing technique that allows to obtain precise orbitalparameters of an accreting millisecond pulsar in those cases in which intrinsicvariations of the phase delays (caused e.g. by proper variation of the spinfrequency) with characteristic timescale longer than the orbital period do notallow to fit the orbital parameters over a long observation (tens of days). weshow under which conditions this method can be applied and show the resultsobtained applying this method to the 2003 outburst observed by rxte of theaccreting millisecond pulsar xte j1807-294 which shows in its phase delays anon-negligible erratic behavior. we refined the orbital parameters of xtej1807-294 using all the 90 days in which the pulsation is strongly detected andthe method applicable. in this way we obtain the orbital parameters of thesource with a precision more than one order of magnitude better than theprevious available orbital solution, a precision obtained to date, on accretingmillisecond pulsars, only for xte j1807-294 analyzing several outburstsspanning over seven years and with a much better statistics.

1004.1963	a self-consistent approach to the hard and soft states of 4u 1705-44	we analyzed two xmm-newton observations of the bright atoll source 4u1705-44, which can be considered a prototype of the class of the persistent nslmxbs showing both hard and soft states. the first observation was performedwhen the source was in a hard low flux state, the second during a soft,high-flux state. both the spectra show broad iron emission lines. we fit thespectra using a two-component model, together with a reflection modelspecifically suited to the case of a neutron star, where the incident spectrumhas a blackbody shape. in the soft state, the reflection model, convolved witha relativistic smearing component, consistently describes the broad featurespresent in the spectrum, and we find a clear relation between the temperatureof the incident flux and the temperature of the harder x-ray component that weinterpret as the boundary layer emission. in this state we find convergingevidence that the boundary layer outer radius is ~ 2 times the neutron starradius. in the low flux state, we observe a change in the continuum shape ofthe spectrum with respect to the soft state. still, the broad local emissionfeatures can be associated with a disk reflecting matter, but in a lowerionization state, and possibly produced in an accretion disk truncated atgreater distance. our analysis provides strong evidence that the reflectioncomponent in soft states of lmxbs comes from to hard x-ray thermal irradiation,which we identify with the boundary layer emission, also present in thecontinuum model. in the hard state, the broad iron line if also produced byreflection, and the continuum disk emission can be self-consistently accountedif the disk is truncated at a greater distance than the soft state.

1006.4260	search for pulsations at high radio frequencies from accreting  millisecond x-ray pulsars in quiescence	it is commonly believed that millisecond radio pulsars have been spun up bytransfer of matter and angular momentum from a low-mass companion during anx-ray active mass transfer phase. a subclass of low-mass x-ray binaries is thatof the accreting millisecond x-ray pulsars, transient systems that show periodsof x-ray quiescence during which radio emission could switch on. the aim ofthis work is to search for millisecond pulsations from three accretingmillisecond x-ray pulsars, xte j1751-305, xte j1814-338, and sax j1808.4-3658,observed during their quiescent x-ray phases at high radio frequencies (5 - 8ghz) in order to overcome the problem of the free-free absorption due to thematter engulfing the system. a positive result would provide definite proof ofthe recycling model, providing the direct link between the progenitors andtheir evolutionary products. the data analysis methodology has been chosen onthe basis of the precise knowledge of orbital and spin parameters from x-rayobservations. it is subdivided in three steps: we corrected the time series forthe effects of (i) the dispersion due to interstellar medium and (ii) of theorbital motions, and finally (iii) folded modulo the spin period to increasethe signal-to-noise ratio. no radio signal with spin and orbitalcharacteristics matching those of the x-ray sources has been found in oursearch, down to very low flux density upper limits. we analysed severalmechanisms that could have prevented the detection of the signal, concludingthat the low luminosity of the sources and the geometric factor are the mostlikely reasons for this negative result.

1204.2464	a complete x-ray spectral coverage of the 2010 may-june outbursts of  circinus x-1	circinus x-1 is a neutron-star-accreting x-ray binary in a wide (p$_{\rmorb}$ = 16.6 d), eccentric orbit. after two years of relatively low x-rayluminosity, in may 2010 circinus x-1 went into outburst, reaching 0.4 crabflux. this outburst lasted for about two orbital cycles and was followed byanother shorter and fainter outburst in june. we focus here on the broadbandx-ray spectral evolution of the source as it spans about three order ofmagnitudes in flux. we attempt to relate luminosity, spectral shape, localabsorption, and orbital phase. we use multiple rossi-xte/pca (3.0--25 kev) andswift/xrt (1.0--9.0 kev) observations and a 20 ks long chandra/hetgsobservation (1.0--9.0 kev), to comprehensively track the spectral evolution ofthe source during all the outbursting phases. these observations were takenevery two/three days and cover about four orbital cycles. the pca data mostlycover the major outburst, the xrt data monitor the declining phase of the majoroutburst and all the phases of the minor outburst, and chandra data provide anessential snapshot of the end of this overall outbursting phase. the x-rayspectrum can be satisfactorily described by a thermal comptonization model withvariable neutral local absorption in all phases of the outburst. no otheradditive component is statistically required. the first outburst decayslinearly, with an ankle in the light curve as the flux decreases below$\sim$\,5 $\times$ 10$^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. at the same time, thesource shows a clear spectral state transition from an optically thick to anoptically thin state. while the characteristics of the first, bright, outburstcan be interpreted within the disk-instability scenario, the following, minor,outburst shows peculiarities that cannot be easily reconciled in thisframework.

1207.3226	detailed study of the x-ray and optical/uv orbital ephemeris of  x1822-371	recent studies of the optical/uv and x-ray ephemerides of x1822-371 havefound some discrepancies in the value of the orbital period derivative. becauseof the importance of this value in constraining the system evolution, wecomprehensively analyse all the available optical/uv/x eclipse times of thissource to investigate the origin of these discrepancies. we collected allpreviously published x-ray eclipse times from 1977 to 2008, to which we addedthe eclipse time observed by suzaku in 2006. this point is very important tocover the time gap between the last rxte eclipse time (taken in 2003) and themost recent chandra eclipse time (taken in 2008). similarly we collected theoptical/uv eclipse arrival times covering the period from 1979 to 2006, addinga further eclipse time taken on 1978 and updating previous optical/uvephemeris. we compared the x-ray and the optical/uv ephemeris, and finallyderived a new ephemeris of the source by combining the eclipse arrival times inthe x-ray and optical/uv bands. the x-ray eclipse time delays calculated withrespect to a constant orbital period model display a clear parabolic trend,confirming that the orbital period of this source constantly increases at arate of $\dot{p}_{\rm{orb}} =1.51(7) \times 10^{-10}$ s/s. combining the x-rayand the optical/uv data sets, we find that $\dot{p}_{\rm{orb}} =1.59(9) \times10^{-10}$ s/s, which is compatible with the x-ray orbital solution. we alsoinvestigate the possible presence of a delay of the optical/uv eclipse withrespect to the x-ray eclipse, finding that this delay may not be constant intime. in particular, this variation is compatible with a sinusoidal modulationof the optical/uv eclipse arrival times with respect to the long-term parabolictrend. in this case, the optical/uv eclipse should lag the x-ray eclipse andthe time-lag oscillate about an average value.

1212.2532	the accretion flow to the intermittent accreting ms pulsar, hete  j1900.1-2455, as observed by xmm-newton and rxte	we present a study of the accretion flow to the intermittent accretingmillisecond pulsar, hete j1900.1-2455, based on observations performedsimultaneously by xmm-newton and rxte. the 0.33-50 kev spectrum is described bythe sum of a hard comptonized component originated in an optically thin{\tau}~1 corona, a soft ktin~0.2 kev component interpreted as accretion discemission, and of disc reflection of the hard component. two emission featuresare detected at energies of 0.98(1) and 6.58(7) kev, respectively. the latteris identified as k{\alpha} transition of fe xxiii-xxv. a simultaneous detectionin epic-pn, epic-mos2, and rgs spectra favours an astrophysical origin also forthe former, which has an energy compatible with fe-l{\alpha} and helium-likene-k{\alpha} transitions. broadness of the two features suggests a commonorigin, resulting from reflection in an accretion disc with inclination of(30+4{\deg}), and extending down to rin=25(+16,-11) gravitational radii fromthe compact object. however, the strength of the feature at lower energymeasured by epic-pn cannot be entirely reconciled with the amplitude of the fek{\alpha} line, hampering the possibility of describing it in terms of abroad-band reflection model, and preventing a firm identification. pulsationsat the 377.3 hz spin frequency could not be detected, with an upper limit of0.4% at 3-{\sigma} c.l. on the fractional amplitude. we interpret the innerdisc radius estimated from spectral modelling and the lack of significantdetection of coherent x-ray pulsations as an indication of a disc accretionflow truncated by some mechanism connected to the overall evolution of theaccretion disc, rather than by the neutron star magnetic field. this iscompatible with the extremely close similarity of spectral and temporalproperties of this source with respect to other, non pulsing atoll sources inthe hard state.

1305.3884	swings between rotation and accretion power in a millisecond binary  pulsar	it is thought that neutron stars in low-mass binary systems can accretematter and angular momentum from the companion star and be spun-up tomillisecond rotational periods. during the accretion stage, the system iscalled a low-mass x-ray binary, and bright x-ray emission is observed. when therate of mass transfer decreases in the later evolutionary stages, thesebinaries host a radio millisecond pulsar whose emission is powered by theneutron star's rotating magnetic field. this evolutionary model is supported bythe detection of millisecond x-ray pulsations from several accreting neutronstars and also by the evidence for a past accretion disc in a rotation-poweredmillisecond pulsar. it has been proposed that a rotation-powered pulsar maytemporarily switch on during periods of low mass inflow in some such systems.only indirect evidence for this transition has hitherto been observed. here wereport observations of accretion-powered, millisecond x-ray pulsations from aneutron star previously seen as a rotation-powered radio pulsar. within a fewdays after a month-long x-ray outburst, radio pulses were again detected. thisnot only shows the evolutionary link between accretion and rotation-poweredmillisecond pulsars, but also that some systems can swing between the twostates on very short timescales.

1403.0071	chandra x-ray spectroscopy of a clear dip in gx 13+1	the source gx 13+1 is a persistent, bright galactic x-ray binary hosting anaccreting neutron star. it shows highly ionized absorption features, with ablueshift of $\sim$ 400 km s$^{-1}$ and an outflow-mass rate similar to theaccretion rate. many other x-ray sources exhibit warm absorption features, andthey all show periodic dipping behavior at the same time. recently, a dippingperiodicity has also been determined for gx 13+1 using long-term x-ray foldedlight-curves, leading to a clear identification of one of such periodic dips inan archival chandra observation. we give the first spectral characterization ofthe periodic dip of gx 13+1 found in this archival chandra observationperformed in 2010. we used chandra/hetgs data (1.0-10 kev band) andcontemporaneous rxte/pca data (3.5-25 kev) to analyze the broadband x-rayspectrum. we adopted different spectral models to describe the continuumemission and used the xstar-derived warm absorber component to constrain thehighly ionized absorption features. the 1.0-25 kev continuum emission isconsistent with a model of soft accretion-disk emission and an optically thick,harder comptonized component. the dip event, lasting $\sim$ 450 s, isspectrally resolved with an increase in the column density of the neutralabsorber, while we do not find significant variations in the column density andionization parameter of the warm absorber with respect to the out-of-dipspectrum. we argue that the very low dipping duty-cycle with respect to othersources of the same class can be ascribed to its long orbital period and themostly neutral bulge, that is relatively small compared with the dimensions ofthe outer disk radius.

1409.7112	testing rate dependent corrections on timing mode epic-pn spectra of the  accreting neutron star gx 13+1	when the epic-pn instrument on board xmm-newton is operated in timing mode,high count rates (&gt;100 cts/s) of bright sources may affect the calibration ofthe energy scale, resulting in a modification of the real spectral shape. thecorrections related to this effect are then strongly important in the study ofthe spectral properties. tests of these calibrations are more suitable insources which spectra are characterised by a large number of discrete features.therefore, in this work, we carried out a spectral analysis of the accretingneutron star gx 13+1, which is a dipping source with several narrow absorptionlines and a broad emission line in its spectrum. we tested two differentcorrection approaches on an xmm-newton epic-pn observation taken in timingmode: the standard rate dependent cti (rdcti or epfast) and the new, ratedependent pulse height amplitude (rdpha) corrections. we found that, ingeneral, the two corrections marginally affect the properties of the overallbroadband continuum, while hints of differences in the broad emission linespectral shape are seen. on the other hand, they are dramatically important forthe centroid energy of the absorption lines. in particular, the rdphacorrections provide a better estimate of the spectral properties of thesefeatures than the rdcti corrections. indeed the discrete features observed inthe data, applying the former method, are physically more consistent with thosealready found in other chandra and xmm-newton observations of gx 13+1.

astro-ph;0010062	probing the inner region of cyg x-1 in the low/hard state through its  x-ray broad band spectrum	we present the broad band x-ray spectrum of cyg x-1 in the low/hard state asobserved by the instruments on board of bepposax. the spectrum spans from 0.1to 200 kev, allowing the total accretion luminosity to be observed, rather thanextrapolated, corresponding to ~2 per cent of the eddington limit for a 10solar mass black hole. the broad bandpass allows us to determine the continuumshape with great accuracy. simple models of compton up-scattering of seedphotons from the accretion disk do not adequately match the spectrum. at lowenergies an additional continuum component is required, giving a complex softexcess which extends up to ~4 kev, in line with previous results from asca.moreover we clearly detect a reflected component from the accretion disk whichis smeared, probably because of relativistic and doppler effects. thereflecting material is not strongly ionized and does not subtend a large solidangle as seen from the corona. the inner radius of the disk, that depends onthe inclination of the system, is most probably between 10 and 70 gravitationalradii (rg). an unsmeared reprocessed component, probably originating from thecompanion star or the outer disk, could also be present. in this case, theinner radius of the disk, as inferred from the smeared reflection, is smaller,between 6 and 20 rg.

astro-ph;0010155	a hard tail in the broad band spectrum of the dipper xb 1254-690	we report on the results of spectral analysis of the dipping source xb1254-690 observed by the bepposax satellite. we find that the x-ray dips arenot present during the bepposax observation, in line with recent rxte results.the broad band (0.1-100 kev) energy spectrum is well fitted by athree-component model consisting of a multicolor disk blackbody with an innerdisk temperature of ~0.85 kev, a comptonized spectrum with an electrontemperature of ~2 kev, and a bremsstrahlung at a temperature of ~20 kev.adopting a distance of 10 kpc and taking into account a spectral hardeningfactor of ~1.7 (because of electron scattering which modifies the blackbodyspectrum emitted by the disk) we estimated that the inner disk radius is$r_{\rm in} \sqrt{\cos i} \sim 11$ km, where i is the inclination angle of thesystem with respect to the line of sight. the comptonized component couldoriginate in a spherical corona or boundary layer, surrounding the neutronstar, with optical depth ~19. the bremsstrahlung emission, contributing ~4% ofthe total luminosity, probably originates in an extended accretion disk coronawith radius $\sim 10^{10}$ cm. in this scenario we calculated that the opticaldepth of this region is ~0.71 and its mean electron density is $n_e \sim 2.7\times 10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$. this last component might also be present in otherlow mass x-ray binaries, but, because of its low intrinsic luminosity, it isnot easily observable. we also find an absorption edge at ~1.27 kev with anoptical depth of ~0.15. its energy could correspond to the l-edge of fe xvii,or k-edge of ne x or neutral mg.

astro-ph;0102299	detection of a hard tail in the x-ray spectrum of the z source gx 349+2	we present the results of a bepposax observation of the z source gx 349+2covering the energy range 0.1-200 kev. the presence of flares in the lightcurve indicates that the source was in the flaring branch during the bepposaxobservation. we accumulated energy spectra separately for the non-flaringintervals and the flares. in both cases the continuum is well described by asoft blackbody ($k t_{bb} \sim 0.5$ kev) and a comptonized spectrumcorresponding to an electron temperature of $k t_e \sim 2.7$ kev, optical depth$\tau \sim 10$ (for a spherical geometry), and seed photon temperature of $kt_w \sim 1$ kev. all temperatures tend to increase during the flares. in thenon-flaring emission a hard tail dominates the spectrum above 30 kev. this canbe fit by a power law with photon index $\sim 2$, contributing $\sim 2%$ of thetotal source luminosity over the bepposax energy range. a comparison with hardtails detected in some soft states of black hole binaries suggests that asimilar mechanism could originate these components in black hole and neutronstar systems.

astro-ph;0104170	where have all the submillisecond pulsars gone?	the existence of pulsars with spin period below one millisecond is expected,though they have not been detected up to now. their formation depends on thequantity of matter accreted from the companion which, in turn, is limited bythe mechanism of mass ejection from the binary. mass ejection must beefficient, at least in some cases, in order to produce the observed populationof moderately fast spinning millisecond pulsars. first we demonstrate, in theframework of the widely accepted recycling scenario, using a populationsynthesis approach, that a significant number of pulsars with spin period belowone millisecond is expected. then we propose that significant variations in themass-transfer rate may cause, in systems with orbital periods larger than 1 hr,the switch-on of a radio pulsar whose radiation pressure is capable of ejectingout of the system most of the matter transferred by the companion and preventany further accretion. we show how this mechanism could dramatically alter thebinary evolution since the mechanism that drives mass overflow from the innerlagrangian point is still active while the accretion is inhibited. moreover wedemonstrate that the persistency of this ``radio ejection'' phase depends onthe binary orbital period, demonstrating that close systems (orbital periodslower than 1 hr) are the only possible hosts for ultra fast spinning neutronstars. this could explain why submillisecond pulsars have not been detected sofar, as current radio surveys are hampered by computational limitations withrespect to the detection of very short spin period pulsars in short orbitalperiod binaries.

astro-ph;0107202	spectral evolution of circinus x-1 along its orbit	we report on the spectral analysis of circinus x-1 observed by the ascasatellite in march 1998 along one orbital period. the luminosity of the source(in the 0.1-100 kev band) ranges from $2.5 \times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at theperiastron (orbital phase 0.01) to $1.5 \times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at orbitalphase 0.3. from the spectral analysis and the lightcurve we argue that cir x-1shows three states along the orbital evolution. the first state is at theorbital phase interval 0.97-0.3: the luminosity becames super-eddington and astrong flaring activity is present. in this state a shock could form in theinner region of the system due to the super-eddington accretion rate, producingan outflow of ionized matter whose observational signature could be theprominent absorption edge at $\sim 8.7$ kev observed in the energy spectrum atthese phases. in the second state, corresponding to the orbital phase intervalbetween 0.3 and 0.7, the accretion rate is sub-eddington and we observe aweaker outflow, with smaller hydrogen column: the absorption edge is now at$\sim 8.3$ kev with an optical depth a factor of 2.5 to 6 smaller. the thirdstate corresponds to the orbital phase interval 0.78-0.97. in this state thebest fit model to the spectrum requires the presence of a partial coveringcomponent, indicating that the emission from the compact object is partiallyabsorbed by neutral matter, probably the atmosphere of the companion starand/or the accreting matter from the companion.

astro-ph;0109088	where may ultra-fast rotating neutron stars be hidden?	the existence of ultra-fast rotating neutron stars (spin period p &lt; 1 ms) isexpected on the basis of current models for the secular evolution ofinteracting binaries, though they have not been detected yet. their formationdepends on the quantity of matter accreted by the neutron star which, in turn,is limited by the mechanism of mass ejection from the binary. an efficient massejection can avoid the formation of ultra-fast pulsars or their accretioninduced collapse to a black hole. we propose that significant reductions of themass-transfer rate may cause the switch-on of a radio pulsar phase, whoseradiation pressure may be capable of ejecting out of the system most of thematter transferred by the companion. this can prevent, for long orbital periodsand if a sufficiently fast spin has been reached, any further accretion, evenif the original transfer rate is restored, thus limiting the minimum spinperiod attainable by the neutron star. we show that close systems (orbitalperiods p_orb \sim 1 hr are the only possible hosts for ultra-fast spinningneutron stars. this could explain why ultra-fast radio pulsars have not beendetected so far, as the detection of pulsars with very short spin periods inclose systems is hampered, in current radio surveys, by strong dopplermodulation and computational limitations.

astro-ph;0305157	the optical counterpart to sax j1808.4-3658 in quiescence: evidence of  an active radio pulsar?	the optical counterpart of the binary millisecond x-ray pulsar saxj1808.4-3658 during quiescence was detected at v = 21.5 mag by homer et al.(2001). this star shows a 6% semi-amplitude sinusoidal modulation of its fluxat the orbital period of the system. it was proposed that the modulation arisesfrom x-ray irradiation of the intrinsically faint companion by a remnantaccretion disk, and that the bulk of the optical emission arises from viscousdissipation in the disk. the serious difficulty in this scenario lies in theestimate of the irradiating luminosity required to match the observationaldata, that is a factor 10-50 higher than the quiescent x-ray luminosity of thissource. to overcome this problem, we propose an alternative scenario, in whichthe irradiation is due to the release of rotational energy by the fast spinningneutron star, switched on, as magneto-dipole rotator (radio pulsar), duringquiescence. our computations indicate that the optical magnitudes are fullyconsistent with this hypothesis. in this case the observed optical luminositymay be the first evidence that a radio pulsar is active in this system inquiescence, a key phase for understanding the evolution of this class ofobjects.

astro-ph;0310463	the different fates of a low-mass x-ray binary. i: conservative mass  transfer	we study the evolution of a low mass x-ray binary coupling a binary stellarevolution code with a general relativistic code that describes the behavior ofthe neutron star. we assume the neutron star to be low--magnetized (b~10^8 g).in the systems investigated in this paper, our computations show that duringthe binary evolution the companion transfers as much as 1 solar mass to theneutron star, with an accretion rate of 10^-9 solar masses/yr. this issufficient to keep the inner rim of the accretion disc in contact with theneutron star surface, thus preventing the onset of a propeller phase capable ofejecting a significant fraction of the matter transferred by the companion. wefind that, for neutron stars governed by equations of state from soft up tomoderately stiff, an accretion induced collapse to a black hole is almostunavoidable. the collapse to a black hole can occur either during the accretionphase or after the end of the mass transfer when the neutron star is left in asupramassive sequence. in this last case the collapse is driven by energylosses of the fast spinning radio pulsar. for extremely supramassive neutronstars these energy losses cause a spin up. as a consequence the pulsar willhave a much shorter lifetime than that of a canonical radio pulsar. thisbehavior depends on the equation of state for ultra-dense matter and thereforecould be used to constrain the internal structure of the neutron star. if ther-modes of the neutron star are excited during the accretion process, thegravitational waves emisson limits the maximum spin attainable by a ns toroughly 2 ms. in this case the collapse during the accretion phase is even morecommon since the maximum mass achievable before the collapse to a black holeduring accretion is smaller due to the limited spin frequency.

astro-ph;0511798	radio-ejection and bump-related orbital period gap of millisecond binary  pulsars	the monotonic increase of the radius of low mass stars during their ascent onthe red giant branch halts when they suffer a temporary contraction. thisoccurs when the hydrogen burning shell reaches the discontinuity in hydrogencontent left from the maximum increase in the convective extension, at the timeof the first dredge up, and produces a well known "bump" in the luminosityfunction of the red giants of globular clusters. if the giant is the masslosing component in a binary in which mass transfer occurs on the nuclearevolution time scale, this event produces a temporary stop in the masstransfer, which we will name "bump related" detachment. if the accretingcompanion is a neutron star, in which the previous mass transfer has spun upthe pulsar down to millisecond periods, the subsequent mass transfer phase maybe altered by the presence of the energetic pulsar. in fact, the onset of aradio--ejection phase produces loss of mass and angular momentum from thesytem. we show that this sequence of events may be at the basis of the shortageof systems with periods between ~ 20 and 60 days in the distribution ofbinaries containing millisecond pulsars. we predict that systems which can bediscovered at periods into the gap should have preferentially either magneticmoments smaller than ~ 2 x10^{26}gcm^3, or larger than ~ 4x10^{26}gcm^3. wefurther show that this period gap should not be present in population ii.

astro-ph;0606577	modelling the closest double degenerate system rxj0806.3+1527 and its  decreasing period	in the hypothesis that the 5.4m binary rxj0806.3+1527 consists of a low masshelium white dwarf (donor) transferring mass towards its more massive whitedwarf companion (primary), we consider as possible donors white dwarfs whichare the result of common envelope evolution occurring when the helium core massof the progenitor giant was still very small (~ 0.2msun), so that they aresurrounded by a quite massive hydrogen envelope (~1/100msun or larger), andlive for a very long time supported by proton--proton burning. mass transferfrom such low mass white dwarfs very probably starts during the hydrogenburning stage, and the donor structure will remain dominated by the burningshell until it loses all the hydrogen envelope and begins transferring helium.we model mass transfer from these low mass white dwarfs, and show that theradius of the donor decreases while they shed the hydrogen envelope. thisradius behavior, which is due to the fact that the white dwarf is not fullydegenerate, has two important consequences on the evolution of the binary: 1)the orbital period decreases, with a timescale consistent with the perioddecrease of the binary rxj0806.3+1527; 2) the mass transfer rate is a factor ofabout 10 smaller than from a fully degenerate white dwarf, easing the problemconnected with the small x-ray luminosity of this object. the possibility thatsuch evolution describes the system rxj0806.3+1527 is also consistent with thepossible presence of hydrogen in the optical spectrum of the star, whoseconfirmation would become a test of the model.

astro-ph;0607614	search for radio pulsations in four anomalous x-ray pulsars and  discovery of two new pulsars	we report on observations of four southern anomalous x-ray pulsars, (1rxsj170849.0-400910, 1e 1048.1-5937, 1e 1841-045 and ax j1845-0258), obtained at1.4 ghz using the parkes radio telescope. radio pulsations from these sourceshave been searched (i) by directly folding the time series at a number of trialperiods centered on the value of the spin rate obtained from the x-rayobservations; (ii) by performing a blind search; (iii) using a code sensitiveto single dedispersed pulses, in the aim to detect signals similar to those ofthe recently discovered rotating radio transients. no evidence for radiopulsations with an upper limit of ~0.1 mjy for any of the four targets has beenfound. the blind search led to the serendipitous discovery of two new pulsars,rotating with a spin period of about 0.7 s and of 92 ms respectively, and tothe further detection of 18 known pulsars, two of which were also detected inthe single-pulse search.

astro-ph;0608335	a hard x-ray view on scorpius x-1 with integral: non-thermal emission ?	we present here simultaneous integral/rxte observations of sco x-1, and inparticular a study of the hard x-ray emission of the source and its correlationwith the position in the z-track of the x-ray color-color diagram. we find thatthe hard x-ray (above about 30 kev) emission of sco x-1 is dominated by apower-law component with a photon index of ~3. the flux in the power-lawcomponent slightly decreases when the source moves in the color-color diagramin the sense of increasing inferred mass accretion rate from the horizontalbranch to the normal branch/flaring branch vertex. it becomes not significantlydetectable in the flaring branch, where its flux has decreased by about anorder of magnitude. these results present close analogies to the behavior of gx17+2, one of so-called sco-like z sources. finally, the hard power law in thespectrum of sco x-1 does not show any evidence of a high energy cutoff up to100 - 200 kev, strongly suggesting a non-thermal origin of this component.

astro-ph;0611942	timing of the accreting millisecond pulsar xte j1814-338	we present a precise timing analysis of the accreting millisecond pulsar xtej1814-338 during its 2003 outburst, observed by rxte. a full orbital solutionis given for the first time; doppler effects induced by the motion of thesource in the binary system were corrected, leading to a refined estimate ofthe orbital period, p_orb=15388.7229(2)s, and of the projected semimajor axis,a sini/c= 390.633(9) lt-ms. we could then investigate the spin behaviour of theaccreting compact object during the outburst. we report here a refined value ofthe spin frequency (nu=314.35610879(1) hz) and the first estimate of the spinfrequency derivative of this source while accreting (nu^dot=(-6.7 +/- 0.7)10^(-14) hz/s). this spin down behaviour arises when both the fundamentalfrequency and the second harmonic are taken into consideration. we discuss thisin the context of the interaction between the disc and the quickly rotatingmagnetosphere, at accretion rates sufficiently low to allow a threading of theaccretion disc in regions where the keplerian velocity is slower than themagnetosphere velocity. we also present indications of a jitter of the pulsephases around the mean trend, which we argue results from movements of theaccreting hotspots in response to variations of the accretion rate.

astro-ph;0612093	order in the chaos: spin-up and spin-down during the 2002 outburst of  sax j1808.4-3658	we present a timing analysis of the 2002 outburst of the accretingmillisecond pulsar sax j1808.4-3658. a study of the phase delays of the entirepulse profile shows a behavior that is surprising and difficult to interpret:superposed to a general trend, a big jump by about 0.2 in phase is visible,starting at day 14 after the beginning of the outburst. an analysis of thepulse profile indicates the presence of a significant first harmonic. studyingthe fundamental and the first harmonic separately, we find that the phasedelays of the first harmonic are more regular, with no sign of the jumpobserved in the fundamental. the fitting of the phase delays of the firstharmonic with a model which takes into account the observed exponential decayof the x-ray flux (and therefore of the mass accretion rate onto the neutronstar) gives important information on the torque acting on the neutron starduring the outburst. we find that the source shows spin-up in the first part ofthe outburst, while a spin-down dominates at the end. from these results wederive an estimate of the neutron star magnetic field strength.

astro-ph;0701400	on the maximum efficiency of the propeller mass-ejection mechanism	aims. we derive simple estimates of the maximum efficiency with which mattercan be ejected by the propeller mechanism in disk-fed, rotating magneticneutron stars. some binary evolution scenarios envisage that this mechanism isresponsible for expelling to infinity the mass inflowing at a low rate from thecompanion star, therefore limiting the total amount of mass that can beaccreted by the neutron star. methods. we demonstrate that, for typical neutronstar parameters, a maximum of \eta_{pro} &lt; 5.7 (p_{-3})^{1/3} times more matterthan accreted can be expelled through the propeller mechanism at the expensesof the neutron star rotational energy (p_{-3} is the ns spin period in unit of10e-3 s). approaching this value, however, would require a great deal of finetuning in the system parameters and the properties of the interaction of matterand magnetic field at the magnetospheric boundary. results. we conclude thatsome other mechanism must be invoked in order to prevent that too much massaccretes onto the neutron stars of some low mass x-ray binaries.
