0909.0750	the size-star formation relation of massive galaxies at 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5	we study the relation between size and star formation activity in a completesample of 225 massive (m &gt; 5 x 10^10 msun) galaxies at 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5, selected fromthe fireworks uv-ir catalog of the cdfs. based on stellar population synthesismodel fits to the observed restframe uv-nir seds, and independent mips 24micron observations, 65% of galaxies are actively forming stars, while 35% arequiescent. using sizes derived from 2d surface brightness profile fits to highresolution (fwhm_{psf}~0.45 arcsec) groundbased isaac data, we confirm andimprove the significance of the relation between star formation activity andcompactness found in previous studies, using a large, complete mass-limitedsample. at z~2, massive quiescent galaxies are significantly smaller thanmassive star forming galaxies, and a median factor of 0.34+/-0.02 smaller thangalaxies of similar mass in the local universe. 13% of the quiescent galaxiesare unresolved in the isaac data, corresponding to sizes &lt;1 kpc, more than 5times smaller than galaxies of similar mass locally. the quiescent galaxiesspan a kormendy relation which, compared to the relation for local early types,is shifted to smaller sizes and brighter surface brightnesses and isincompatible with passive evolution. the progenitors of the quiescent galaxies,were likely dominated by highly concentrated, intense nuclear star bursts atz~3-4, in contrast to star forming galaxies at z~2 which are extended anddominated by distributed star formation.

0909.1803	discovery of z~8 galaxies in the hudf from ultra-deep wfc3/ir  observations	we utilize the newly-acquired, ultra-deep wfc3/ir observations over the hudfto search for star-forming galaxies at z~8-8.5, only 600 million years fromrecombination, using a y_{105}-dropout selection. the new 4.7 arcmin**2 wfc3/irobservations reach to ~28.8 ab mag (5 sigma) in the y_{105}j_{125}h_{160}bands. these remarkable data reach ~1.5 ab mag deeper than the previous dataover the hudf, and now are an excellent match to the hudf optical acs data. forour search criteria, we use a two-color lyman-break selection technique toidentify z~8-8.5 y_{105}-dropouts. we find 5 likely z~8-8.5 candidates. thesources have h_{160}-band magnitudes of ~28.3 ab mag and very blue uv-continuumslopes, with a median estimated beta of &lt;~-2.5 (where f_{\lambda}\propto\lambda^{\beta}). this suggests that z~8 galaxies are not only essentially dustfree but also may have very young ages or low metallicities. the observednumber of y_{105}-dropout candidates is smaller than the 20+/-6 sourcesexpected assuming no evolution from z~6, but is consistent with the 5 expectedextrapolating the bouwens et al. 2008 lf results to z~8. these results provideevidence that the evolution in the lf seen from z~7 to z~3 continues to z~8.the remarkable improvement in the sensitivity of wfc3/ir has enabled hst tocross a threshold, revealing star-forming galaxies at z~8-9.

0909.1806	z~7 galaxies in the hudf: first epoch wfc3/ir results	we present a sample of 16 robust z~7 z-drop galaxies detected by the newlyinstalled wfc3/ir camera on the hubble space telescope. our analysis is basedon the first epoch data of the hudf09 program covering the hubble ultra deepfield with 60 orbits of y, j, and h observations. these remarkable data cover4.7 arcmin^2 and are the deepest nir images ever taken, reaching to ~29 mag ab(5 sigma). the 16 z~6.5-7.5 galaxies have been identified based on the lymanbreak technique utilizing (z-y) vs. (y-j) colors. they have magnitudes j =26.0-29.0 (ab), an average apparent half-light radius of ~0.16 arcsec (&lt;~1kpc), and show very blue colors (some even beta&lt;~-2.5), in particular at lowluminosities. the wfc3/ir data confirms previous nicmos detections indicatingthat the dropout selection at z~7 is very reliable. our data allow a firstdetermination of the faint end slope of the z~7 luminosity function, reachingdown to m_uv ~ -18, a full magnitude fainter than previous measurements. whenfixing phi*=1.4e-3/mpc^3/mag to the value previously measured at z~6, we find abest-fit value of alpha=-1.77+-0.20, with a characteristic luminosity ofm_*=-19.91+-0.09. this steep slope is similar to what is seen at z~2-6 andindicates that low luminosity galaxies could potentially provide adequate fluxto reionize the universe. the remarkable depth and resolution of these newimages provide insights into the coming power of jwst.

0909.4074	uv continuum slope and dust obscuration from z~6 to z~2: the star  formation rate density at high redshift	we provide a systematic measurement of the rest-frame uv continuum slope betaover a wide range in redshift (z~2-6) and rest-frame uv luminosity (0.1-2l*) toimprove estimates of the sfr density at high redshift. we utilize the deepoptical and infrared data (acs/nicmos) over the cdf-s and hdf-n goods fields,as well as the udf for our primary ubvi "dropout" sample. we correct theobserved distributions for selection biases and photometric scatter. we findthat the uv-continuum slope of the most luminous galaxies is substantiallyredder at z~2-4 than it is at z~5-6. lower luminosity galaxies are also foundto be bluer than higher luminosity galaxies at z~2.5 and z~4. we do not find alarge number of galaxies with beta's as red as -1 in our dropout selections atz~4, and particularly at z&gt;~5, even though such sources could be readilyselected from our data. this suggests that star-forming galaxies at z&gt;~5 almostuniversally have very blue uv-continuum slopes, and that there are not likelyto be a substantial number of dust-obscured galaxies at z&gt;~5 that are missed in"dropout" searches. using the same relation between uv-continuum slope and dustextinction as found to be appropriate at z~0 and z~2, we estimate the averagedust extinction of galaxies as a function of redshift and uv luminosity in aconsistent way. we find that the estimated dust extinction increasessubstantially with cosmic time for the most uv luminous galaxies, but remainssmall (&lt;~2x) at all times for lower luminosity galaxies. because these samelower luminosity galaxies dominate the luminosity density in the uv, theoverall dust extinction correction remains modest at all redshifts. we includethe contribution from ulirgs in our sfr density estimates at z~2-6, but findthat they contribute only ~20% of the total at z~2.5 and &lt;~10% at z&gt;~4.

0909.5183	structure and morphologies of z~7-8 galaxies from ultra-deep wfc3/ir  imaging of the hudf	we present a first morphological study of z~7-8 lyman break galaxies (lbgs)from oesch et al. 2009 and bouwens et al. 2009 detected in ultra-deepnear-infrared imaging of the hubble ultra deep field (hudf) by the hudf09program. with an average intrinsic size of 0.7+-0.3 kpc these galaxies arefound to be extremely compact having an average observed surface brightness ofmu_j ~= 26 mag arcsec^(-2), and only two out of the full sample of 16 z~7galaxies show extended features with resolved double cores. by comparison tolower redshift lbgs it is found that only little size evolution takes placefrom z~7 to z~6, while galaxies between z~4-5 show more extended wings in theirapparent profiles. the average size scales as (1+z)^(-m) with m=1.12+-0.17 forgalaxies with luminosities in the range (0.3-1)l*_{z=3} and with m=1.32+-0.52for (0.12-0.3)l*_{z=3}, consistent with galaxies having constant comovingsizes. the peak of the size distribution changes only slowly from z~7 to z~4.however, a tail of larger galaxies (&gt;~ 1.2 kpc) is gradually built up towardslater cosmic times, possibly via hierarchical build-up or via enhancedaccretion of cold gas. additionally, the average star-formation surface densityof lbgs with luminosities (0.3-1)l*_{z=3} is nearly constant at sigma_{sfr}=1.9msun/yr/kpc^2 over the entire redshift range z~4-7 suggesting similarstar-formation efficiencies at these early epochs. the above evolutionarytrends seem to hold out to z~8 though the sample is still small and possiblyincomplete.

0910.0001	very blue uv-continuum slopes of low luminosity z~7 galaxies from  wfc3/ir: evidence for extremely low metallicities?	we use the ultra-deep wfc3/ir data over the hudf and the early releasescience wfc3/ir data over the cdf-south goods field to quantify the broadbandspectral properties of candidate star-forming galaxies at z~7. we determine theuv-continuum slope beta in these galaxies, and compare the slopes with galaxiesat later times to measure the evolution in beta. for luminous l*(z=3) galaxies,we measure a mean uv-continuum slope beta of -2.0+/-0.2, which is comparable tothe beta~-2 derived at similar luminosities at z~5-6. however, for the lowerluminosity 0.1l*(z=3) galaxies, we measure a mean beta of -3.0+/-0.2. this issubstantially bluer than is found for similar luminosity galaxies at z~4, just800 myr later, and even at z~5-6. in principle, the observed beta of -3.0 canbe matched by a very young, dust-free stellar population, but when nebularemission is included the expected beta becomes &gt;~-2.7. to produce these veryblue beta's (i.e., beta~-3), extremely low metallicities and mechanisms toreduce the red nebular emission are likely required. for example, a largeescape fraction (i.e., f_{esc}&gt;~0.3) could minimize the contribution from thisred nebular emission. if this is correct and the escape fraction in faint z~7galaxies is &gt;~0.3, it may help to explain how galaxies reionize the universe.

0910.0838	ultradeep infrared array camera observations of sub-l* z~7 and z~8  galaxies in the hubble ultra deep field: the contribution of low-luminosity  galaxies to the stellar mass density and reionization	we study the spitzer infrared array camera (irac) mid-infrared (rest-frameoptical) fluxes of 14 newly wfc3/ir-detected z=7 z_{850}-dropout galaxies and 5z=8 y_{105}-dropout galaxies. the wfc3/ir depth and spatial resolution allowaccurate removal of contaminating foreground light, enabling reliable fluxmeasurements at 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron. none of the galaxies are detected to[3.6]=26.9 (ab, 2 sigma), but a stacking analysis reveals a robust detectionfor the z_{850}-dropouts and an upper limit for the y_{105}-dropouts. weconstruct average broadband seds using the stacked acs, wfc3, and irac fluxesand fit stellar population synthesis models to derive mean redshifts, stellarmasses, and ages. for the z_{850}-dropouts, we find z=6.9^{+0.1}_{-0.1},(u-v)_{rest}=0.4, reddening a_v=0, stellar mass m*=1.2^{+0.3}_{-0.6} x 10^9m_sun (salpeter imf). the best-fit ages ~300myr, m/l_v=0.2, andssfr=1.7gyr^{-1} are similar to values reported for luminous z=7 galaxies,indicating the galaxies are smaller but not younger. the sub-l* galaxiesobserved here contribute significantly to the stellar mass density and underfavorable conditions may have provided enough photons for sustainedreionization at 7&lt;z&lt;11. in contrast, the z=8.3^{+0.1}_{-0.2} y_{105}-dropoutshave stellar masses that are uncertain by 1.5 dex due to the near-completereliance on far-uv data. adopting the 2 sigma upper limit on the m/l(z=8), thestellar mass density to m_{uv,ab} &lt; -18 declines fromrho*(z=7)=3.7^{+1.0}_{-1.8} x 10^6 m_sun mpc^{-3} to rho*(z=8) &lt; 8 x 10^5 m_sunmpc^{-3}, following (1+z)^{-6} over 3&lt;z&lt;8. lower masses at z=8 would signifymore dramatic evolution, which can be established with deeper iracobservations, long before the arrival of the james webb space telescope.

0910.2227	the dead sequence: a clear bimodality in galaxy colors from z=0 to z=2.5	we select 25,000 galaxies from the newfirm medium band survey (nmbs) to studythe rest-frame u-v color distribution of galaxies at 0 &lt; z &lt; 2.5. the fiveunique nir filters of the nmbs enable the precise measurement of photometricredshifts and rest-frame colors for 9,900 galaxies at 1 &lt; z &lt; 2.5. therest-frame u-v color distribution at all z&lt;~2.5 is bimodal, with a red peak, ablue peak, and a population of galaxies in between (the green valley). modelfits to the optical-nir seds and the distribution of mips-detected galaxiesindicate that the colors of galaxies in the green valley are determined largelyby the amount of reddening by dust. this result does not support the simplestinterpretation of green valley objects as a transition from blue star-formingto red quiescent galaxies. we show that correcting the rest-frame colors fordust reddening allows a remarkably clean separation between the red and bluesequences up to z~2.5. our study confirms that dusty starburst galaxies cancontribute a significant fraction to red sequence samples selected on the basisof a single rest-frame color (i.e. u-v), so extra care must be taken if samplesof truly "red and dead" galaxies are desired. interestingly, of galaxiesdetected at 24 microns, 14% remain on the red sequence after applying thereddening correction.

0911.1356	star formation rates and stellar masses of z=7-8 galaxies from irac  observations of the wfc3/ir ers and the hudf field	we investigate the spitzer/irac properties of 36 z~7 z-dropout galaxies and 3z~8 y-dropout galaxies derived from deep/wide-area wfc3/ir data of the earlyrelease science, the ultradeep hudf09, and wide-area nicmos data. we fitstellar population synthesis models to the seds to derive mean redshifts,stellar masses, and ages. the z~7 galaxies are best characterized bysubstantial ages (&gt;100 myr) and m/l_v~0.2. the main trend with decreasingluminosity is that of bluing of the far-uv slope from beta~-2.0 to beta~-3.0.this can be explained by decreasing metallicity, except for the lowestluminosity galaxies (0.1 l*{z=3}), where low metallicity and smooth sfhs failto match the blue far-uv and moderately red h-[3.6] color. such colors mayrequire episodic sfhs with short periods of activity and quiescence ("on-off"cycles) and/or a contribution from emission lines. the stellar mass of oursample of z~7 star forming galaxies correlates with sfr according to log m* =8.70 (+-0.09) + 1.06(+-0.10) log sfr, implying star formation may havecommenced at z&gt;10. no galaxies are found with sfrs much higher or lower thanthe past averaged sfr suggesting that the typical star formation timescales areprobably a substantial fraction of the hubble time. we report the first iracdetection of y-dropout galaxies at z~8. the average rest-frame u-v=0.3 (ab) ofthe 3 galaxies are similar to faint z~7 galaxies, implying similar m/l. thestellar mass density to m_{uv,ab}&lt;-18 is rho*(z=8) = 1.8^{+0.7}_{-1.0} x 10^6m_sun mpc^-3, following log rho*(z)= 10.6(+-0.6) - 4.4(+-0.7) log(1+z) [m_sunmpc^-3] over 3&lt;z&lt; 8.

0707.2787	the evolution of the field and cluster morphology-density relation for  mass-selected samples of galaxies	the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and photometric/spectroscopic surveys inthe goods-south field (the chandra deep field-south, cdfs) are used toconstruct volume-limited, stellar mass-selected samples of galaxies atredshifts 0&lt;z&lt;1. the cdfs sample at 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.0 contains 207 galaxies completedown to m=4x10^10 msol (for a ``diet'' salpeter imf), corresponding to aluminosity limit for red galaxies of m_b=-20.1. the sdss sample at0.020&lt;z&lt;0.045 contains 2003 galaxies down to the same mass limit, whichcorresponds to m_b=-19.3 for red galaxies. morphologies are determined with anautomated method, using the sersic parameter n and a measure of the residualfrom the model fits, called ``bumpiness'', to distinguish differentmorphologies. these classifications are verified with visual classifications.in agreement with previous studies, 65-70% of the galaxies are located on thered sequence, both at z~0.03 and at z~0.8. similarly, 65-70% of the galaxieshave n&gt;2.5. the fraction of e+s0 galaxies is 43+/-3%$ at z~0.03 and 48+/-7% atz~0.8, i.e., it has not changed significantly since z~0.8. when combined withrecent results for cluster galaxies in the same redshift range, we find thatthe morphology-density relation for galaxies more massive than 0.5m* hasremained constant since at least z~0.8. this implies that galaxies evolve inmass, morphology and density such that the morphology-density relation does notchange. in particular, the decline of star formation activity and theaccompanying increase in the stellar mass density of red galaxies since z~1must happen without large changes in the early-type galaxy fraction in a givenenvironment.

0912.4263	a candidate redshift z ~ 10 galaxy and rapid changes in that population  at an age of 500 myr	searches for very-high-redshift galaxies over the past decade have yielded alarge sample of more than 6,000 galaxies existing just 900-2,000 million years(myr) after the big bang (redshifts 6 &gt; z &gt; 3; ref. 1). the hubble ultra deepfield (hudf09) data have yielded the first reliable detections of z ~ 8galaxies that, together with reports of a gamma-ray burst at z ~ 8.2 (refs 10,11), constitute the earliest objects reliably reported to date. observations ofz ~ 7-8 galaxies suggest substantial star formation at z &gt; 9-10. here we usethe full two-year hudf09 data to conduct an ultra-deep search for z ~ 10galaxies in the heart of the reionization epoch, only 500 myr after the bigbang. not only do we find one possible z ~ 10 galaxy candidate, but we showthat, regardless of source detections, the star formation rate density is muchsmaller (~10%) at this time than it is just ~200 myr later at z ~ 8. thisdemonstrates how rapid galaxy build-up was at z ~ 10, as galaxies increased inboth luminosity density and volume density from z ~ 8 to z ~ 10. the 100-200myr before z ~ 10 is clearly a crucial phase in the assembly of the earliestgalaxies.

0707.4484	hst and spitzer imaging of red and blue galaxies at z~2.5: a correlation  between size and star formation activity from compact quiescent galaxies to  extended star forming galaxies	we present hst nicmos+acs and spitzer irac+mips observations of 41 galaxiesat 2&lt;z&lt;3.5 in the fires ms1054 field with red and blue rest-frame opticalcolors. about half of the galaxies are very compact (effective radii r_e &lt; 1kpc) at rest-frame optical wavelengths, the others are extended (1&lt; r_e &lt; 10kpc). for reference, 1 kpc corresponds to 0.12 arcsec at z=2.5 in the adoptedcosmology. we separate actively star forming galaxies from quiescent galaxiesby modeling their rest-frame uv-nir seds. the star forming galaxies span thefull range of sizes, while the quiescent galaxies all have r_e&lt;2kpc. in theredshift range where mips 24 micron imaging is a sensitive probe of re-radiateddust emission (z&lt;2.5), the 24 micron fluxes confirm that the light of the smallquiescent galaxies is dominated by old stars, rather than dust-enshrouded starformation or agn activity. the inferred surface mass densities and velocitydispersions for the quiescent galaxies are very high compared to those in localgalaxies. the galaxies follow a kormendy relation (between surface brightnessand size) with approximately the same slope as locally, but shifted to brightersurface brightnesses, consistent with a mean stellar formation redshift ofz_f~5. this paper demonstrates a direct relation between star formationactivity and size at z~2.5, and the existence of a significant population ofmassive, extremely dense, old stellar systems without readily identifiablecounterparts in the local universe.

1005.1661	the evolution of the uv luminosity function from z ~ 0.75 to z ~ 2.5  using hst ers wfc3/uvis observations	we present uv luminosity functions (lfs) at 1500 angstrom derived from thehst early release science wfc3/uvis data acquired over ~50 arcmin^2 of thegoods-south field. the lfs are determined over the entire redshift rangez=0.75-2.5 using two methods, similar to those used at higher redshifts forlyman break galaxies (lbgs): (1) 13-band uv+optical+nir photometric redshiftsto study galaxies in the range z=0.5-2 in three bins of dz=0.5, and (2) dropoutsamples in three redshift windows centered at z~1.5, z~1.9, and z~2.5. thecharacteristic luminosity dims by ~1.5 mag from z=2.5 to z=0.75, consistentwith earlier work. however, the other schechter function parameters, thefaint-end slope and the number density, are found to be remarkably constantover the range z=0.75-2.5. using these lf determinations we find the uvluminosity density to increase by ~1.4 dex according to (1+z)^{2.58+-0.15} fromz~0 to its peak at z~2.5. strikingly, the inferred faint-end slopes for our lfsare all steeper than alpha=-1.5, in agreement with higher-redshift lbg studies.since the faint-end slope in the local universe is found to be much flatterwith alpha~=-1.2, this poses the question as to when and how the expectedflattening occurs. despite relatively large uncertainties, our data suggestalpha~=-1.7 at least down to z~1. these new results from such a shallow earlydataset demonstrate very clearly the remarkable potential of wfc3/uvis for thethorough characterization of galaxy evolution over the full redshift rangez~0.5 to z~3.

1006.4360	uv luminosity functions from 132 z~7 and z~8 lyman-break galaxies in the  ultra-deep hudf09 and wide-area ers wfc3/ir observations	we identify 73 z~7 and 59 z~8 candidate galaxies in the reionization epoch,and use this large 26-29.4 ab mag sample of galaxies to derive very deepluminosity functions to &lt;-18 ab mag and the star formation rate density at z~7and z~8. the galaxy sample is derived using a sophisticated lyman-breaktechnique on the full two-year wfc3/ir and acs data available over the hudf09(~29.4 ab mag, 5 sigma), two nearby hudf09 fields (~29 ab mag, 14 arcmin) andthe wider area ers (~27.5 ab mag) ~40 arcmin**2). the application of strictoptical non-detection criteria ensures the contamination fraction is kept low(just ~7% in the hudf). this very low value includes a full assessment of thecontamination from lower redshift sources, photometric scatter, agn, spurioussources, low mass stars, and transients (e.g., sne). from careful modelling ofthe selection volumes for each of our search fields we derive luminosityfunctions for galaxies at z~7 and z~8 to &lt;-18 ab mag. the faint-end slopesalpha at z~7 and z~8 are uncertain but very steep at alpha = -2.01+/-0.21 andalpha=-1.91+/-0.32, respectively. such steep slopes contrast to the localalpha&lt;~-1.4 and may even be steeper than that at z~4 where alpha=-1.73+/-0.05.with such steep slopes (alpha&lt;~-1.7) lower luminosity galaxies dominate thegalaxy luminosity density during the epoch of reionization. the star formationrate densities derived from these new z~7 and z~8 luminosity functions areconsistent with the trends found at later times (lower redshifts). we findreasonable consistency, with the sfr densities implied from reported stellarmass densities, being only ~40% higher at z&lt;7. this suggests that (1) thestellar mass densities inferred from the spitzer irac photometry are reasonablyaccurate and (2) that the imf at very high redshift may not be very differentfrom that at later times.

1006.5453	the age spread of quiescent galaxies with the newfirm medium-band  survey: identification of the oldest galaxies out to z~2	with a complete, mass-selected sample of quiescent galaxies from the newfirmmedium-band survey (nmbs), we study the stellar populations of the oldest andmost massive galaxies (&gt;10^11 msun) to high redshift. the sample includes 570quiescent galaxies selected based on their extinction-corrected u-v colors outto z=2.2, with accurate photometric redshifts, sigma_z/(1+z)~2%, and rest-framecolors, sigma_u-v~0.06 mag. we measure an increase in the intrinsic scatter ofthe rest-frame u-v colors of quiescent galaxies with redshift. this scatter incolor arises from the spread in ages of the quiescent galaxies, where we seeboth relatively quiescent red, old galaxies and quiescent blue, youngergalaxies towards higher redshift. the trends between color and age areconsistent with the observed composite rest-frame spectral energy distributions(seds) of these galaxies. the composite seds of the reddest and bluestquiescent galaxies are fundamentally different, with remarkably well-defined4000a- and balmer-breaks, respectively. some of the quiescent galaxies may beup to 4 times older than the average age- and up to the age of the universe, ifthe assumption of solar metallicity is correct. by matching the scatterpredicted by models that include growth of the red sequence by thetransformation of blue galaxies to the observed intrinsic scatter, the dataindicate that most early-type galaxies formed their stars at high redshift witha burst of star formation prior to migrating to the red sequence. the observedu-v color evolution with redshift is weaker than passive evolution predicts;possible mechanisms to slow the color evolution include increasing amounts ofdust in quiescent galaxies towards higher redshift, red mergers at z&lt;1, and afrosting of relatively young stars from star formation at later times.

1009.1423	cluster galaxies in xmmu j2235-2557: galaxy population properties in  most massive environments at z~1.4	we present a multi-wavelength study of galaxy populations in the core of themassive, x-ray luminous cluster xmmu j2235 at z=1.39, based on vlt and hstoptical and near-infrared photometry. luminosity functions in the z, h, and ksbands show a faint-end slope consistent with being flat, and a characteristicmagnitude m* close to passive evolution predictions of m* of local massiveclusters, with a formation redshift z&gt;2. the color-magnitude and color-massdiagrams show evidence of a tight red sequence of massive galaxies, withoverall old stellar populations, generally early-type morphology, typicallyshowing early-type spectral features and rest-frame far-uv emission consistentwith very low star formation rates (sfr&lt;0.2msun/yr). star forming spectroscopicmembers, with sfrs of up to ~100msun/yr, are all located at clustercentricdistances &gt;~250kpc, with the central cluster region already appearingeffectively quenched. massive galaxies in the core of this cluster appear to bein an advanced evolutionary stage in terms of both star formation and massassembly. the high-mass end of the galaxy stellar mass function is essentiallyalready in place, and the stellar mass fraction estimated within r500 (~1%,kroupa imf) is already similar to that of local massive clusters. on the otherhand, morphological analysis of the massive red sequence galaxies suggests thatthey are smaller than similarly massive local early-types. while possiblyaffected by systematics and biases, this result might imply that, in spite ofthe overall early assembly of these sources, their evolution is not complete,and processes like minor (and likely dry) merging might still shape theirstructural properties to resemble those of their local counterparts, withoutsubstantially affecting their stellar mass or host stellarpopulations.[abridged]

1011.2764	the simple survey: observations, reduction, and catalog	we present the spitzer irac/musyc public legacy survey in the extendedcdf-south (simple), which consists of deep irac observations covering the~1,600 arcmin^2 area surrounding goods-s. the limiting magnitudes of the simpleirac mosaics typically are 23.8, 23.6, 21.9, and 21.7, at 3.6 um, 4.5 um, 5.8um, and 8.0 um, respectively (5-sigma total point source magnitudes in ab). thesimple irac images are combined with the 10'x15' goods irac mosaics in thecenter. we give detailed descriptions of the observations, data reduction, andproperties of the final images, as well as the detection and photometry methodsused to build a catalog. using published optical and near-infrared data fromthe multiwavelength survey by yale-chile (musyc), we construct an irac-selectedcatalog, containing photometry in ubvriz'jhk, [3.6 um], [4.5 um], [5.8 um], and[8.0 um]. the catalog contains 43,782 sources with s/n &gt; 5 at 3.6 um, 19,993 ofwhich have 13-band photometry. we compare this catalog to the publiclyavailable musyc and fireworks catalogs and discuss the differences. using ahigh signal-to-noise sub-sample of 3,391 sources with ([3.6] + [4.5])/2 &lt; 21.2,we investigate the star formation rate history of massive galaxies out to z ~1.8. we find that at z ~ 1.8 at least 30% +/-7% of the most massive galaxies(mstar &gt; 10^11 msol) are passively evolving, in agreement with earlier resultsfrom surveys covering less area.

1105.2038	lower-luminosity galaxies could reionize the universe: very steep  faint-end slopes to the uv luminosity functions at z&gt;=5-8 from the hudf09  wfc3/ir observations	the hudf09 data are the deepest near-ir observations ever, reaching to 29.5mag. luminosity functions (lf) from these new hudf09 data for 132 z\sim7 andz\sim8 galaxies are combined with new lfs for z\sim5-6 galaxies and the earlierz\sim4 lf to reach to very faint limits (&lt;0.05 l*(z=3)). the faint-end slopesalpha are steep: -1.79+/-0.12 (z\sim5), -1.73+/-0.20 (z\sim6), -2.01+/-0.21(z\sim7), and -1.91+/-0.32 (z\sim8). slopes alpha\lesssim-2 lead to formallydivergent uv fluxes, though galaxies are not expected to form below \sim-10 abmag. these results have important implications for reionization. the weightedmean slope at z\sim6-8 is -1.87+/-0.13. for such steep slopes, and a faint-endlimit of -10 ab mag, galaxies provide a very large uv ionizing photon flux.while current results show that galaxies can reionize the universe by z\sim6,matching the thomson optical depths is more challenging. extrapolating thecurrent lf evolution to z&gt;8, taking alpha to be -1.87+/-0.13 (the mean value atz\sim6-8), and adopting typical parameters, we derive thomson optical depths of0.061_{-0.006}^{+0.009}. however, this result will change if the faint-endslope alpha is not constant with redshift. we test this hypothesis and find aweak, though uncertain, trend to steeper slopes at earlier times(dalpha/dz\sim-0.05+/-0.04), that would increase the thomson optical depths to0.079_{-0.017}^{+0.063}, consistent with recent wmap estimates(tau=0.088+/-0.015). it may thus not be necessary to resort to extremeassumptions about the escape fraction or clumping factor. nevertheless, theuncertainties remain large. deeper wfc3/ir+acs observations can furtherconstrain the ionizing flux from galaxies.

1105.2297	expanded search for z~10 galaxies from hudf09, ers, and candels data:  evidence for accelerated evolution at z&gt;8?	we search for z~10 galaxies over ~160 arcmin^2 of wfc3/ir data in the chandradeep field south, using the public hudf09, ers, and candels surveys, that reachto 5sigma depths ranging from 26.9 to 29.4 in h_160 ab mag. z&gt;~9.5 galaxycandidates are identified via j_125-h_160&gt;1.2 colors and non-detections in anyband blueward of j_125. spitzer irac photometry is key for separating thegenuine high-z candidates from intermediate redshift (z~2-4) galaxies withevolved or heavily dust obscured stellar populations. after removing 16 sourcesof intermediate brightness (h_160~24-26 mag) with strong irac detections, weonly find one plausible z~10 galaxy candidate in the whole data set, previouslyreported in bouwens et al. (2011). the newer data cover a 3x larger area andprovide much stronger constraints on the evolution of the uv luminosityfunction (lf). if the evolution of the z~4-8 lfs is extrapolated to z~10, sixz~10 galaxies are expected in our data. the detection of only one sourcesuggests that the uv lf evolves at an accelerated rate before z~8. theluminosity density is found to increase by more than an order of magnitude inonly 170 myr from z~10 to z~8. this increase is &gt;=4x larger than expected fromthe lower redshift extrapolation of the uv lf. we are thus likely witnessingthe first rapid build-up of galaxies in the heart of cosmic reionization.future deep hst wfc3/ir data, reaching to well beyond 29 mag, can enable a morerobust quantification of the accelerated evolution around z~10.

1109.0994	uv-continuum slopes at z~4-7 from the hudf09+ers+candels observations:  discovery of a well-defined uv-color magnitude relationship for z&gt;=4  star-forming galaxies	ultra-deep acs and wfc3/ir hudf+hudf09 data, along with the wide-areagoods+ers+candels data over the cdf-s goods field, are used to measure uvcolors, expressed as the uv-continuum slope beta, of star-forming galaxies overa wide range in luminosity (0.1l*(z=3) to 2l*(z=3)) at high redshift (z~7 toz~4). beta is measured using all acs and wfc3/ir passbands uncontaminated byly_alpha and spectral breaks. extensive tests show that our beta measurementsare only subject to minimal biases. using a different selection procedure,dunlop et al. recently found large biases in their beta measurements. toreconcile these different results, we simulated both approaches and found thatbeta measurements for faint sources are subject to large biases if the samepassbands are used both to select the sources and to measure beta.high-redshift galaxies show a well-defined rest-frame uv color-magnitude (cm)relationship that becomes systematically bluer towards fainter uv luminosities.no evolution is seen in the slope of the uv cm relationship in the first 1.5gyr, though there is a small evolution in the zero-point to redder colors fromz~7 to z~4. this suggests that galaxies are evolving along a well-definedsequence in the l(uv)-color (beta) plane (a "star-forming sequence"?). dustappears to be the principal factor driving changes in the uv color (beta) withluminosity. these new larger beta samples lead to improved dust extinctionestimates at z~4-7 and confirm that the extinction is still essentially zero atlow luminosities and high redshifts. inclusion of the new dust extinctionresults leads to (i) excellent agreement between the sfr density at z~4-8 andthat inferred from the stellar mass density, and (ii) to higher ssfrs at z&gt;~4,suggesting the ssfr may evolve modestly (by factors of ~2) from z~4-7 to z~2.

1201.0755	the bright end of the uv luminosity function at z~8: new constraints  from candels data in goods-south	we present new z~8 galaxy candidates from a search over ~95 arcmin^2 ofwfc3/ir data, tripling the previous search area for bright z~8 galaxies. ouranalysis uses newly acquired wfc3/ir imaging data from the candels multi-cycletreasury program over the goods south field. these new data are combined withexisting deep optical acs imaging to search for relatively bright (m_uv &lt; -19.5mag) z~8 galaxy candidates using the lyman break technique. these newcandidates are used to determine the bright end of the uv luminosity function(lf) of star-forming galaxies at z~8. to minimize contamination from lowerredshift galaxies, we make full use of all optical acs data and impose strictnon-detection criteria based on an optical chi^2_opt flux measurement. in thewhole search area we identify 16 candidate z~8 galaxies, spanning a magnituderange h_160 = 25.7-27.9 mag. the new data show that the uv lf is a factor ~1.7xlower at m_uv &lt; -19.5 mag than determined from the hudf09 and ers data alone.combining this new sample with the previous candidates from the hudf09 and ersdata allows us to perform the most accurate measurement of the z~8 uv lf yet.schechter function fits to the combined data result in a best-fitcharacteristic magnitude of m*(z=8) = -20.04+-0.46 mag. the faint-end slope isvery steep, though quite uncertain, with alpha = -2.06+-0.32. a combination ofwide area data with additional ultra-deep imaging will be required tosignificantly reduce the uncertainties on these parameters in the future.

1209.3037	the spectral energy distributions of z~8 galaxies from the irac ultra  deep fields: emission lines, stellar masses, and specific star formation  rates at 650 myr	using new ultradeep spitzer/irac photometry from the irac ultradeep fieldprogram (iudf), we investigate the stellar populations of a sample of 63y-dropout galaxy candidates at z~8, only 650myr after the big bang. the sourcesare selected from hst/acs+wfc3/ir data over the hubble ultra deep field (hudf),two hudf parallel fields, and wide area data over the candels/goods-south. thenew spitzer/irac data increase the coverage at 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron to~120h over the hudf reaching depths of ~28 (ab,1 sigma). the improved depth andinclusion of brighter candidates result in direct &gt;3 sigma irac detections of20/63 sources, of which 11/63 are detected at &gt; 5 sigma. the average[3.6]-[4.5] colors of irac detected galaxies at z~8 are markedly redder thanthose at z~7, observed only 130myr later. the simplest explanation is that wewitness strong rest-frame optical emission lines (in particular[oiii]4959,5007+hbeta) moving through the irac bandpasses with redshift.assuming that the average rest-frame spectrum is the same at both z~7 and z~8we estimate a rest-frame equivalent width of w([oiii]4959,5007+hbeta) = 670(+260,-170) angstrom contributing 0.56 (+0.16,-0.11) mag to the 4.5 micronfilter at z~8. the corresponding w(halpha) = 430 (+160,-110) angstrom impliesan average specific star formation rate of ssfr = 11 (+11,-5) gyr^-1 and astellar population age of 100 (+100,-50) myr. correcting the spectral energydistribution for the contribution of emission lines lowers the average best-fitstellar masses and mass-to-light ratios by x3, decreasing the integratedstellar mass density to rho*(z=8,muv&lt;-18)=0.6 (+0.4,-0.3) x 10^6 msun mpc^-3.

1211.1010	a rest-frame optical view on z~4 galaxies i: color and age distributions  from deep irac photometry of the iudf10 and goods surveys	we present a study of rest-frame uv-to-optical color distributions for z~4galaxies based on the combination of deep hst/acs+wfc3/ir data withspitzer/irac imaging. in particular, we use new, ultra-deep data from the iracultradeep field program (iudf10). our sample contains a total of ~2600 galaxiesselected as b-dropout lyman break galaxies (lbgs) in the hudf and one of itsdeep parallel fields, the hudf09-2, as well as goods-north and south. thissample is used to investigate the uv continuum slopes beta and balmer breakcolors (j_125-[4.5]) as a function of rest-frame optical luminosity. the [4.5]filter is chosen to avoid potential contamination by strong rest-frame opticalemission lines. we find that galaxies at m_z&lt;-21.5 (roughly corresponding tol*[z~4]) are significantly redder than their lower luminosity counterparts. theuv continuum slopes and the j_125-[4.5] colors are well correlated. the mostsimple explanation for this correlation is that the dust reddening at theseredshifts is better described by an smc-like extinction curve, rather than thetypically assumed calzetti reddening. after correcting for dust, we find thatthe galaxy population shows mean stellar population ages in the range 10^8.5 to10^9 yr, with a dispersion of ~0.5 dex, and only weak trends as a function ofluminosity. in contrast to some results from the literature, we find that onlya small fraction of galaxies shows balmer break colors which are consistentwith extremely young ages, younger than 100 myr. under the assumption of smoothstar-formation histories, this fraction is only 12-19% for galaxies atm_z&lt;-19.75. our results are consistent with a gradual build-up of stars anddust in galaxies at z&gt;4, with only a small fraction of stars being formed inshort, intense bursts of star-formation.

1211.2230	a census of star-forming galaxies in the z~9-10 universe based on  hst+spitzer observations over 19 clash clusters: three candidate z~9-10  galaxies and improved constraints on the star formation rate density at z~9	we utilise a two-color lyman-break selection criterion to search for z~9-10galaxies over the first 19 clusters in the clash program. a systematic searchyields three z~9-10 candidates. while we have already reported the most robustof these candidates, macs1149-jd, two additional z~9 candidates are also foundand have h_{160}-band magnitudes of ~26.2-26.9. a careful assessment of varioussources of contamination suggests &lt;~1 contaminants for our z~9-10 selection. todetermine the implications of these search results for the lf and sfr densityat z~9, we introduce a new differential approach to deriving these quantitiesin lensing fields. our procedure is to derive the evolution by comparing thenumber of z~9-10 galaxy candidates found in clash with the number of galaxiesin a slightly lower redshift sample (after correcting for the differences inselection volumes), here taken to be z~8. this procedure takes advantage of thefact that the relative volumes available for the z~8 and z~9-10 selectionsbehind lensing clusters are not greatly dependent on the details of the lensingmodels. we find that the normalization of the uv lf at z~9 is just0.28_{-0.20}^{+0.39}\times that at z~8, ~1.4_{-0.8}^{+3.0}x lower thanextrapolating z~4-8 lf results. while consistent with the evolution in the uvlf seen at z~4-8, these results marginally favor a more rapid evolution at z&gt;8.compared to similar evolutionary findings from the hudf, our result is lessinsensitive to large-scale structure uncertainties, given our many independentsightlines on the high-redshift universe.

1211.3105	photometric constraints on the redshift of z~10 candidate udfj-39546284  from deeper wfc3/ir+acs+irac observations over the hudf	ultra-deep wfc3/ir observations on the hudf from the hudf09 program revealedjust one plausible z~10 candidate udfj-39546284. udfj-39546284 had all theproperties expected of a galaxy at z~10 showing (1) no detection in the deepacs+wfc3 imaging data blueward of the f160w band, exhibiting (2) a bluespectral slope redward of the break, and showing (3) no prominent detection indeep irac observations. the new, similarly deep wfc3/ir hudf12 f160wobservations over the hudf09/xdf allow us to further assess this candidate.these observations show that this candidate, previously only detected at ~5.9sigma in a single band, clearly corresponds to a real source. it is detected at~5.3 sigma in the new h-band data and at ~7.8 sigma in the full 85-orbit h-bandstack. interestingly, the non-detection of the source (&lt;1 sigma) in the newf140w observations suggests a higher redshift. formally, the best-fit redshiftof the source utilizing all the wfc3+acs (and irac+k-band) observations is11.8+/-0.3. however, we consider the z~12 interpretation somewhat unlikely,since the source would either need to be ~20x more luminous than expected orshow very high-ew ly-alpha emission (which seems improbable given the extensiveneutral gas prevalent early in the reionization epoch). lower-redshiftsolutions fail if only continuum models are allowed. plausible lower-redshiftsolutions require that the h-band flux be dominated by line emission such ashalpha or [oiii] with extreme ews. the tentative detection of line emission at1.6 microns in udfj-39546284 in a companion paper suggests that such emissionmay have already been found.

1301.6162	probing the dawn of galaxies at z~9-12: new constraints from hudf12/xdf  and candels data	we present a comprehensive analysis of z&gt;8 galaxies based on ultra-deepwfc3/ir data. we constrain the evolution of the uv luminosity function (lf) andluminosity densities from z~11 to z~8 by exploiting all the wfc3/ir data overthe hubble ultra-deep field from the hudf09 and the new hudf12 program, inaddition to the hudf09 parallel field data, as well as wider area wfc3/irimaging over goods-south. galaxies are selected based on the lyman breaktechnique in three samples centered around z~9, z~10 and z~11, with seven z~9galaxy candidates, and one each at z~10 and z~11. we confirm a new z~10candidate (with z=9.8+-0.6) that was not convincingly identified in our firstz~10 sample. the deeper data over the hudf confirms all our previous z&gt;~7.5candidates as genuine high-redshift candidates, and extends our samples tohigher redshift and fainter limits (h_160~29.8 mag). we perform one of thefirst estimates of the z~9 uv lf and improve our previous constraints at z~10.extrapolating the lower redshift uv lf evolution should have revealed 17 z~9and 9 z~10 sources, i.e., a factor ~3x and 9x larger than observed. theinferred star-formation rate density (sfrd) in galaxies above 0.7 m_sun/yrdecreases by 0.6+-0.2 dex from z~8 to z~9, in good agreement with previousestimates. the low number of sources found at z&gt;8 is consistent with a veryrapid build-up of galaxies across z~10 to z~8. from a combination of allcurrent measurements, we find a best estimate of a factor 10x decrease in thesfrd from z~8 to z~10, following (1+z)^(-11.4+-3.1). our measurements thusconfirm our previous finding of an accelerated evolution beyond z~8, andsignify a rapid build-up of galaxies with m_uv&lt;-17.7 within only ~200 myr fromz~10 to z~8, in the heart of cosmic reionization.

1306.2950	uv-continuum slopes of &gt;4000 z~4-8 galaxies from the hudf/xdf, hudf09,  ers, candels-south, and candels-north fields	we measure the uv-continuum slope beta for over 4000 high-redshift galaxiesover a wide range of redshifts z~4-8 and luminosities from the hst hudf/xdf,hudf09-1, hudf09-2, ers, candels-n, and candels-s data sets. our new betaresults reach very faint levels at z~4 (-15.5 mag: 0.006 l*(z=3)), z~5 (-16.5mag: 0.014l*(z=3)), and z~6 and z~7 (-17 mag: 0.025 l*(z=3)). inconsistenciesbetween previous studies led us to conduct a comprehensive review of systematicerrors and develop a new technique for measuring beta that is robust againstbiases that arise from the impact of noise. we demonstrate, by object-by-objectcomparisons, that all previous studies, including our own and those done on thelatest hudf12 dataset, suffer from small systematic errors in beta. we findthat after correcting for the systematic errors (typically d(beta) ~0.1-0.2)all beta results at z~7 from different groups are in excellent agreement. themean beta we measure for faint (-18 mag: 0.1l*(z=3)) z~4, z~5, z~6, and z~7galaxies is -2.03+/-0.03+/-0.06 (random and systematic errors),-2.14+/-0.06+/-0.06, -2.24+/-0.11+/-0.08, and -2.30+/-0.18+/-0.13,respectively. our new beta values are redder than we have reported in the past,but bluer than other recent results. our previously reported trend of bluerbeta's at lower luminosities is confirmed, as is the evolution to bluer beta'sat high redshifts. beta appears to show only a mild luminosity dependencefaintward of m(uv,ab) ~ -19 mag, suggesting that the mean beta asymptotes to ~-2.2 to -2.4 for faint z&gt;~4 galaxies. at z~7, the observed beta's suggestnon-zero, but low dust extinction, and they agree well with values predicted incosmological hydrodynamical simulations.

0802.2506	discovery of a very bright strongly-lensed galaxy candidate at z ~ 7.6	using hst and spitzer irac imaging, we report the discovery of a very brightstrongly lensed lyman break galaxy (lbg) candidate at z~7.6 in the field of themassive galaxy cluster abell 1689. the galaxy candidate, which we refer to asa1689-zd1, shows a strong z-j break of at least 2.2 mag and is completelyundetected (&lt;1 sigma) in hst/acs g, r, i, and z-band data. these properties,combined with the very blue j-h and h-[4.5] colors, are exactly the propertiesof an z~7.6 lbg and can only be reasonably fit by a star-forming galaxy atz=7.6 +/- 0.4. attempts to reproduce these properties with a model galaxy atz&lt;4 yield particularly poor fits. a1689-zd1 has an observed (lensed) magnitudeof 24.7 ab (8 sigma) in the nicmos h band and is ~1.3 mag brighter than thebrightest-known z-dropout galaxy. when corrected for the cluster magnificationof 9.3 at z~7.6, the candidate has an intrinsic magnitude of h=27.1 ab, orabout an l* galaxy at z~7.6. the source-plane deprojection shows that the starformation is occurring in compact knots of size ~&lt;300 pc. the best-fit stellarpopulation synthesis models yield a median redshift of 7.6, stellar masses(1.6-3.9) x 10^9 m_sun, stellar ages 45-320 myr, star-formation rates ~&lt;7.6m_sun/yr, and low reddening with a_v &lt;= 0.3. these properties are generallysimilar to those of lbgs found at z~5-6. the inferred stellar ages suggest aformation redshift of z~8-10 (t~&lt;0.63 gyr). a1689-zd1 is the brightestobserved, highly reliable z&gt;7.0 galaxy candidate found to date.

1404.2844	3d-hst+candels: the evolution of the galaxy size-mass distribution since  $z=3$	spectroscopic + photometric redshifts, stellar mass estimates, and rest-framecolors from the 3d-hst survey are combined with structural parametermeasurements from candels imaging to determine the galaxy size-massdistribution over the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;3. separating early- and late-typegalaxies on the basis of star-formation activity, we confirm that early-typegalaxies are on average smaller than late-type galaxies at all redshifts, andfind a significantly different rate of average size evolution at fixed galaxymass, with fast evolution for the early-type population, r_eff ~ (1+z)^-1.48,and moderate evolution for the late-type population, r_eff ~ (1+z)^-0.75. thelarge sample size and dynamic range in both galaxy mass and redshift, incombination with the high fidelity of our measurements due to the extensive useof spectroscopic data, not only fortify previous results, but also enable us toprobe beyond simple average galaxy size measurements. at all redshifts theslope of the size-mass relation is shallow, r_eff ~ m_star^0.22, for late-typegalaxies with stellar mass &gt;3x10^9 m_sol, and steep, r_eff m_star^0.75, forearly-type galaxies with stellar mass &gt;2x10^10 m_sol. the intrinsic scatter is&lt;~0.2 dex for all galaxy types and redshifts. for late-type galaxies, thelogarithmic size distribution is not symmetric, but skewed toward small sizes:at all redshifts and masses a tail of small late-type galaxies exists thatoverlaps in size with the early-type galaxy population. the number density ofmassive (~10^11 m_sol), compact (r_eff &lt; 2 kpc) early-type galaxies increasesfrom z=3 to z=1.5-2 and then strongly decreases at later cosmic times.

1407.4233	geometry of star-forming galaxies from sdss, 3d-hst and candels	we determine the intrinsic, 3-dimensional shape distribution of star-forminggalaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;2.5, as inferred from their observed projected axis ratios. inthe present-day universe star-forming galaxies of all masses 1e9 - 1e11 msolare predominantly thin, nearly oblate disks, in line with previous studies. wenow extend this to higher redshifts, and find that among massive galaxies (m* &gt;1e10 msol) disks are the most common geometric shape at all z &lt; 2. lower-massgalaxies at z&gt;1 possess a broad range of geometric shapes: the fraction ofelongated (prolate) galaxies increases toward higher redshifts and lowermasses. galaxies with stellar mass 1e9 msol (1e10 msol) are a mix of roughlyequal numbers of elongated and disk galaxies at z~1 (z~2). this suggests thatgalaxies in this mass range do not yet have disks that are sustained over manyorbital periods, implying that galaxies with present-day stellar masscomparable to that of the milky way typically first formed such sustainedstellar disks at redshift z~1.5-2. combined with constraints on the evolutionof the star formation rate density and the distribution of star formation overgalaxies with different masses, our findings imply that, averaged over cosmictime, the majority of stars formed in disks.

1409.1228	first frontier field constraints on the cosmic star-formation rate  density at z~10 - the impact of lensing shear on completeness of  high-redshift galaxy samples	we search the complete hubble frontier field dataset of abell 2744 and itsparallel field for z~10 sources to further refine the evolution of the cosmicstar-formation rate density (sfrd) at z&gt;8. we independently confirm two imagesof the recently discovered triply-imaged z~9.8 source by zitrin et al. (2014)and set an upper limit for similar z~10 galaxies with red colors ofj_125-h_160&gt;1.2 in the parallel field of abell 2744. we utilize extensivesimulations to derive the effective selection volume of lyman-break galaxies atz~10, both in the lensed cluster field and in the adjacent parallel field.particular care is taken to include position-dependent lensing shear toaccurately account for the expected sizes and morphologies of highly-magnifiedsources. we show that both source blending and shear reduce the completeness ata given observed magnitude in the cluster, particularly near the criticalcurves. these effects have a significant, but largely overlooked, impact on thedetectability of high-redshift sources behind clusters, and substantiallyreduce the expected number of highly-magnified sources. the detections andlimits from both pointings result in a sfrd which is higher by 0.4+-0.4 dexthan previous estimates at z~10 from blank fields. nevertheless, thecombination of these new results with all other estimates remain consistentwith a rapidly declining sfrd in the 170 myr from z~8 to z~10 as predicted bycosmological simulations and dark-matter halo evolution in lambdacdm. oncebiases introduced by magnification-dependent completeness are accounted for,the full six cluster and parallel frontier field program will be an extremelypowerful new dataset to probe the evolution of the galaxy population at z&gt;8before the advent of the jwst.

0705.3325	the color magnitude distribution of field galaxies to z~3: the evolution  and modeling of the blue sequence	using deep nir vlt/isaac and optical hst/wfpc2 imaging in the fields of thehdfs and ms1054-03, we study the rest-frame uv-to-optical colors and magnitudesof galaxies to z~3. while there is no evidence for a red sequence at z~3, theredoes appear to be a well-defined color-magnitude relation (cmr) for bluegalaxies at all redshifts, with more luminous galaxies having redder u-vcolors. the slope of the blue cmr is independent of redshift d(u-v)/dmv = -0.09(0.01) and can be explained by a correlation of dust-reddening with luminosity.the average color at fixed luminosity reddens strongly \delta(u-v) = 0.75 fromz~3 to z=0, much of which can be attributed to aging of the stars. the colorscatter of the blue sequence is relatively small sigma(u-v) = 0.25 (0.03) andconstant to z~3, but notably asymmetrical with a sharp blue ridge and a wingtowards redder colors. we explore sets of star formation histories to study theconstraints placed by the shape of the scatter at z=2-3. one particular set ofmodels, episodic star formation, reproduces the detailed properties very well.for a two-state model with high and low star formation, the duty cycle isconstrained to be &gt; 40% and the contrast between the states must be a factor &gt;5 (or a scatter in log(sfr) of &gt; 0.35 dex around the mean). however, episodicmodels do not explain the observed tail of very red galaxies, primarily distantred galaxies (drgs), which may have ceased star formation altogether or aremore heavily obscured. finally, the relative number density of red, luminous mv&lt; -20.5 galaxies increases by a factor of ~ 6 from z = 2.7 to z = 0.5, as doestheir contribution to the total rest-frame v-band luminosity density. we arelikely viewing the progressive formation of red, passively evolving galaxies.

0705.3394	low star formation rates for z=1 early-type galaxies in the very deep  goods-mips imaging: implications for their optical/near-infrared spectral  energy distributions	we measure the obscured star formation in z~1 early-type galaxies. thisconstrains the influence of star formation on their optical/near-ir colors,which, we found, are redder than predicted by the model by bruzual &amp; charlot(2003). from deep acs imaging we construct a sample of 95 morphologicallyselected early-type galaxies in the hdf-n and cdf-s with spectroscopicredshifts in the range 0.85&lt;z&lt;1.15. we measure their 24 micron fluxes from thedeep goods-mips imaging and derive the ir luminosities and star formationrates. the fraction of galaxies with &gt;2 sigma detections (~25 mujy} is17(-4,+9)%. of the 15 galaxies with significant detections at least six have anagn. stacking the mips images of the galaxies without significant detectionsand adding the detected galaxies without agn we find an upper limit on the meanstar formation rate (sfr) of 5.2+/-3.0 msol yr^-1, and on the mean specific sfrof 4.6+/-2.2 * 10^-11 yr^-1. under the assumption that the average sfr willdecline at the same rate as the cosmic average, the in situ growth in stellarmass of the early-type galaxy population is less than 14+/-7% between z=1 andthe present. we show that the typically low ir luminosity and sfr imply thatthe effect of obscured star formation (or agn) on their rest-frameoptical/near-ir seds is negligible for ~90% of the galaxies in our sample.hence, their optical/near-ir colors are most likely dominated by evolvedstellar populations. this implies that the colors predicted by the bruzual &amp;charlot (2003) model for stellar populations with ages similar to those of z~1early-type galaxies (~1-3 gyr) are most likely too blue, and that stellarmasses of evolved, high-redshift galaxies can be overestimated by up to afactor of ~2.

astro-ph;0012169	weak lensing study of low mass galaxy groups: implications for omega_m	we report on the first measurement of the average mass and mass-to-lightratio of galaxy groups by analysing the weak lensing signal induced by thesesystems. the groups, which have velocity dispersions of 50-400 km/s, have beenselected from the canadian network for observational cosmology field galaxyredshift survey (cnoc2). this survey allows the identification of a largenumber of groups with redshifts ranging from z=0.12-0.55, ideal for a weaklensing analysis of their mass distribution. for our analysis we use a sampleof 50 groups which are selected on the basis of a careful dynamical analysis ofgroup candidates. we detect a signal at the 99% confidence limit. the best fitsingular isothermal sphere model yields an einstein radius of 0.72+-0.29". thiscorresponds to a velocity dispersion of 274^{+48}_{-59} km/s (using photometricredshift distributions for the source galaxies), which is in good agreementwith the dynamical estimate. under the assumption that the light traces themass, we find an average mass-to-light ratio of 191+-83 h msun/lsun in therestframe b band. unlike dynamical estimates, this result is insensitive toproblems associated with determining group membership. after correction of theobserved mass-to-light ratio for luminosity evolution to z=0, we find 254+-110h msun/lsun, lower than what is found for rich clusters. we use the observedmass-to-light ratio to estimate the matter density of the universe, for whichwe find omega_m=0.19+-0.10 (omega_lambda=0), in good agreement with otherrecent estimates. for a closed universe, we obtain omega_m=0.13+-0.07.

astro-ph;0211566	the fundamental plane and the evolution of the m/l ratio of early-type  field galaxies up to z~1	we analyse the fundamental plane (fp) of 26 strong gravitational lensgalaxies with redshifts up to z~1, using tabulated data from kochanek et al.(2000) and rusin et al. (2003). the lens galaxies effectively form amass-selected sample of early-type galaxies in environments of relatively lowdensity. we analyse the fp and its evolution in the restframe johnson b andgunn r bands. assuming that early-type galaxies are a homologous family, the fpthen provides a direct measurement of the m/l ratio evolution. if we assumethat the m/l ratios of field early-type galaxies evolve as power-laws, we findfor the lens galaxies an evolution rate dlog(m/l)/dz of -0.62 +/-0.13 inrestframe b, corresponding to a mean stellar formation redshift of &lt;z*&gt;=1.8(-0.5/+1.4). this formation epoch does not differ significantly from that ofcluster galaxies &lt;z*cl&gt;=2.0 (-0.2/+0.3), obtained by van dokkum &amp; franx (2001)after correction for maximum progenitor bias. however, if we impose theconstraint that lens and cluster galaxies that are of the same age have equalm/l ratios and we do not correct for progenitor bias, we find that the stellarpopulations of the lens galaxies are 10-15 % younger. we find that both the m/lratios as well as the restframe colors of the lens galaxies show significantscatter. about half of the lens galaxies are consistent with an oldcluster-like stellar populations, but the other galaxies are bluer and best fitby single burst models with younger stellar formation redshifts as low as z*~1.moreover, the scatter in color is correlated with the scatter in m/l ratio. weinterpret this as evidence of a significant age spread among the stellarpopulations of lens galaxies, whereas the ages of the stellar populations ofthe cluster galaxies are well approximated by a single formation epoch.

astro-ph;0212236	ultradeep near-infrared isaac observations of the hdf-s: observations,  reduction, multicolor catalog, and photometric redshifts	we present deep near-infrared (nir) js, h, and ks-band isaac imaging of thewfpc2 field of the hdf-s. the 2.5'x 2.5' high galactic latitude field wasobserved with the vlt under the best seeing conditions with integration timesamounting to 33.6 hours in js, 32.3 hours in h, and 35.6 hours in ks. we reachtotal ab magnitudes for point sources of 26.8, 26.2, and 26.2 respectively (3sigma), which make it the deepest ground-based nir observations to date, andthe deepest ks-band data in any field. the effective seeing of the coaddedimages is ~0.45" in js, ~0.48" in h, and ~0.46" in ks. using published wfpc2optical data, we constructed a ks-limited multicolor catalog containing 833sources down to ks,tot ~&lt; 26 (ab), of which 624 have seven-band optical-to-nirphotometry. these data allow us to select normal galaxies from their rest-frameoptical properties to high redshift (z ~&lt; 4). the observations, data reductionand properties of the final images are discussed, and we address the detectionand photometry procedures that were used in making the catalog. in addition, wepresent deep number counts, color distributions and photometric redshifts ofthe hdf-s galaxies. we find that our faint ks-band number counts are flatterthan published counts in other deep fields, which might reflect cosmicvariations or different analysis techniques. compared to the hdf-n, we findmany galaxies with very red v-h colors at photometric redshifts 1.95 &lt; z &lt; 3.5.these galaxies are bright in ks with infrared colors redder than js-ks &gt; 2.3(in johnson magnitudes). because they are extremely faint in the observedoptical, they would be missed by ultraviolet-optical selection techniques, suchas the u-dropout method.

astro-ph;0302402	discovery of two distant type ia supernovae in the hubble deep field  north with the advanced camera for surveys	we present observations of the first two supernovae discovered with therecently installed advanced camera for surveys (acs) on the hubble spacetelescope. the supernovae were found in wide field camera images of the hubbledeep field north taken with the f775w, f850lp, and g800l optical elements aspart of the acs guaranteed time observation program. spectra extracted from theacs g800l grism exposures confirm that the objects are type ia supernovae (sneia) at redshifts z=0.47 and z=0.95. follow-up hst observations have beenconducted with acs in f775w and f850lp and with nicmos in the near-infraredf110w bandpass, yielding a total of 9 flux measurements in the 3 bandpassesover a period of 50 days in the observed frame. we discuss many of theimportant issues in doing accurate photometry with the acs. we analyze themulti-band light curves using two different fitting methods to calibrate thesupernovae luminosities and place them on the sne ia hubble diagram. theresulting distances are consistent with the redshift-distance relation of theaccelerating universe model, although evolving intergalactic grey dust remainsas a less likely possibility. the relative ease with which these sne ia werefound, confirmed, and monitored demonstrates the potential acs holds forrevolutionizing the field of high-redshift sne ia, and therefore of testing theaccelerating universe cosmology and constraining the "epoch of deceleration".

astro-ph;0303165	detection of strong clustering of red k-selected galaxies at 2&lt;z_phot&lt;4  in the hubble deep field south	the clustering properties of faint k&lt;24 galaxies are measured in ultradeep j,h and k near-ir images of the hubble deep field south (hdf-s), obtained withisaac at the vlt. a relatively large clustering amplitude is found up to k=24,at a level comparable to the measurements at k~19. the redshift distribution ofk&lt;24 galaxies extends to z_phot~4-5, and ~40% of the galaxies are atz_phot&gt;2.at the highest redshifts, 2&lt;z_phot&lt;4, galaxies selected in the restframe optical (k-band) appear more clustered than those selected in the restframe uv (i.e. lyman break galaxies, lbgs). galaxy clustering depends on thej-k color at 2&lt;z_phot&lt;4. k-selected galaxies with j-k&gt;1.7 reach r_0~8 h^-1 mpccomoving. this is a factor of 3--4 higher than the correlation length of lbgswith similar number densities, down to v_606&lt;27, and is also larger than thecorrelation length of galaxies with blue j-k&lt;1.7 colors. hence at z about 3 acolor-density relation is observed which is similar to that observed locally.fluctuations in the amplitude of clustering due to cosmic variance may affectour estimates derived from the small hdf-s field, but these are unlikely tochange our main conclusions. the galaxies with red j-k&gt;1.7 colors at 2&lt;z_phot&lt;4are likely older and more massive galaxies, on average, than lbgs. they werepresumably formed in the highest density perturbations at early epochs.semi-analytical hierarchical models do predict the existence of stronglyclustered populations at z~3, but with at least a factor of 10 lower numberdensity than the one measured. the overall properties of this stronglyclustered population consistently suggest that they are the progenitors, orbuilding blocks, of local massive early-type galaxies and z~1 eros, close totheir major epochs of formation.

astro-ph;0306062	large disk-like galaxies at high redshift	using deep near-infrared imaging of the hubble deep field south with isaac onthe very large telescope we find 6 large disk-like galaxies at redshifts z =1.4-3.0. the galaxies, selected in k_s (2.2 micron), are regular andsurprisingly large in the near-infrared (rest-frame optical), with face-oneffective radii r_e = 0.65"-0.9" or 5.0-7.5 h_70^-1 kpc in a lambda-cdmcosmology, comparable to the milky way. the surface brightness profiles areconsistent with an exponential law over 2-3 effective radii. the wfpc2morphologies in hubble space telescope imaging (rest-frame uv) are irregularand show complex aggregates of star-forming regions ~2" (~15 h_70^-1 kpc)across, symmetrically distributed around the k_s-band centers. the spectralenergy distributions show clear breaks in the rest-frame optical. the breaksare strongest in the central regions of the galaxies, and can be identified asthe age-sensitive balmer/4000 angstrom break. the most straightforwardinterpretation is that these galaxies are large disk galaxies; deep nir dataare indispensable for this classification. the candidate disks constitute 50%of galaxies with l_v &gt; 6 x 10^10 h_70^-2 l_sun at z = 1.4-3.0. this discoverywas not expected on the basis of previously studied samples. in particular, thehubble deep field north is deficient in large galaxies with the morphologiesand profiles we report here.

astro-ph;0306215	star formation at z~6: i-dropouts in the acs gto fields	using an i-z dropout criterion, we determine the space density of z~6galaxies from two deep acs gto fields with deep optical-ir imaging. a total of23 objects are found over 46 arcmin^2, or ~0.5 objects/arcmin^2 down to z~27.3(6 sigma; all ab mag) (including one probable z~6 agn). combining deep isaacdata for our rdcs1252-2927 field (j~25.7 and ks~25.0 (5 sigma)) and nicmos datafor the hdf north (jh~27.3 (5 sigma)), we verify that these dropouts have flatspectral slopes. i-dropouts in our sample range in luminosity from ~1.5 l*(z~25.6) to ~0.3 l* (z~27.3) with the exception of one very bright candidate atz~24.2. the half-light radii vary from 0.09" to 0.29", or 0.5 kpc to 1.7 kpc.we derive the z~6 rest-frame uv luminosity density using three differentprocedures, each utilizing simulations based on a cdf south v dropout sample.first, we compare our findings with a no-evolution projection of this v-dropoutsample. we find 23+/-25% more i-dropouts than we predict. adopting previousresults to z~5, this works out to a 20+/-29% drop in the luminosity densityfrom z~3 to z~6. second, we use these same v-dropout simulations to derive aselection function for our i-dropout sample and compute the uv-luminositydensity (7.2+/-2.5 x 10^25 ergs/s/hz/mpc^3 down to z~27). we find a 39+/-21%drop over the same redshift range. this is our preferred value and suggests astar formation rate of 0.0090+/-0.0031 m_sol/yr/mpc^3 to z~27, or ~0.036+/-0.012 m_sol/yr/mpc^3 extrapolating the lf to the faint limit. third, we followa very similar procedure, but assume no incompleteness, finding a luminositydensity which is ~2-3x lower. this final estimate constitutes a lower limit.all three estimates are within the canonical range of luminosity densitiesnecessary for reionization of the universe at this epoch.

astro-ph;0309036	advanced camera for surveys photometry of the cluster rdcs1252.9-2927:  the color-magnitude relation at z=1.24	we investigate the color-magnitude (cm) relation of galaxies in the distantx-ray selected cluster rdcs1252.9-2927 at z=1.24 using images obtained with theadvanced camera for surveys (acs) on the hubble space telescope in the f775wand f850lp bandpasses. we select galaxies based on morphologicalclassifications extending about 3.5 mag down the galaxy luminosity function,augmented by spectroscopic membership information. at the core of the clusteris an extensive early-type galaxy population surrounding a central pair ofgalaxies that show signs of dynamical interaction. the early-type populationdefines a tight sequence in the cm diagram, with an intrinsic scatter inobserved (i-z) of $0.029\pm0.007$ mag based on 52 galaxies, or $0.024\pm0.008$mag for $\sim30$ ellipticals. simulations using the latest stellar populationmodels indicate an age scatter for the ellipticals of about 34%, with a meanage $\taul\gta2.6$ gyr (corresponding to $z_l\gta2.7$), and the last starformation occurring at $z_{end}\gta1.5$. transforming to rest-frame $(u-b)$, weconclude that the slope and scatter in the cm relation for morphologicallyselected early-type galaxies show little or no evidence for evolution out to$z\approx1.2$. thus, elliptical galaxies were already well established in x-rayluminous clusters when the universe was a third of its present age.

astro-ph;0406562	galaxy size evolution at high redshift and surface brightness selection  effects: constraints from the hubble ultra deep field	we use the exceptional depth of the ultra deep field (udf) and udf-parallelacs fields to study the sizes of high redshift (z~2-6) galaxies and addresslong-standing questions about possible biases in the cosmic star formation ratedue to surface brightness dimming. contrasting b, v, and i-dropout samplesculled from the deeper data with those obtained from the shallower goodsfields, we demonstrate that the shallower data are essentially complete atbright magnitudes to z&lt;5.5 and that the principal effect of depth is to addobjects at the magnitude limit. this indicates that high redshift galaxies arecompact in size (~0.1-0.3") and that large (&gt;0.4", &gt;3 kpc) low surfacebrightness galaxies are rare. a simple comparison of the half-light radii ofthe hdf-n + hdf-s u-dropouts with b, v, and i-dropouts from the udf shows thatthe sizes follow a (1+z)^{-1.05+/-0.21} scaling towards high redshift. a morerigorous measurement compares different scalings of our u-dropout sample withthe mean profiles for a set of intermediate magnitude (26.0&lt;z_{850,ab}&lt;27.5)i-dropouts from the udf. the best-fit is found with a (1+z)^{-0.94_{-0.25}^{+0.19}} size scaling (for fixed luminosity). this result is then verified byrepeating this experiment with different size measures, low redshift samples,and magnitude ranges. very similar scalings are found for all comparisons. arobust measurement of size evolution is thereby demonstrated for galaxies fromz~6 to z~2.5 using data from the udf.

astro-ph;0407644	the luminosity function of early-type galaxies at z~0.75	we measure the luminosity function of morphologically selected e/s0 galaxiesfrom $z=0.5$ to $z=1.0$ using deep high resolution advanced camera for surveysimaging data. our analysis covers an area of $48\box\arcmin$ (8$\times$ thearea of the hdf-n) and extends 2 magnitudes deeper ($i\sim24$ mag) than waspossible in the deep groth strip survey (dgss). at $0.5&lt;z&lt;0.75$, we find$m_b^*-5\log h_{0.7}=-21.1\pm0.3$ and $\alpha=-0.53\pm0.2$, and at$0.75&lt;z&lt;1.0$, we find $m_b^*-5\log h_{0.7}=-21.4\pm0.2$. these luminosityfunctions are similar in both shape and number density to the luminosityfunction using morphological selection (e.g., dgss), but are much steeper thanthe luminosity functions of samples selected using morphological proxies likethe color or spectral energy distribution (e.g., cfrs, cadis, or combo-17). thedifference is due to the `blue', $(u-v)_0&lt;1.7$, e/s0 galaxies, which make up to$\sim30%$ of the sample at all magnitudes and an increasing proportion of faintgalaxies. we thereby demonstrate the need for {\it both morphological andstructural information} to constrain the evolution of galaxies.  we find that the `blue' e/s0 galaxies have the same average sizes and sersicparameters as the `red', $(u-v)_0&gt;1.7$, e/s0 galaxies at brighter luminosities($m_b&lt;-20.1$), but are increasingly different at fainter magnitudes where`blue' galaxies are both smaller and have lower sersic parameters. fits of thecolors to stellar population models suggest that most e/s0 galaxies have shortstar-formation time scales ($\tau&lt;1$ gyr), and that galaxies have formed at anincreasing rate from $z\sim8$ until $z\sim2$ after which there has been agradual decline.

astro-ph;0412570	the fundamental plane of cluster ellipticals at z = 1.25	using deep hst acs imaging and vlt fors2 spectra, we determined the velocitydispersions, effective radii and surface brightnesses for four early-typegalaxies in the $z=1.237$ cluster \cl. all four galaxies are massive, $&gt;10^{11} m_{\sun}$. these four galaxies, combined with three from \lynx at$z=1.276$, establish the fundamental plane of massive early-type clustergalaxies at $\bar{z}=1.25$. the offset of the fundamental plane shows that theluminosity evolution in rest-frame $b$ is $\delta \ln m/l_b = (-0.98 \pm 0.06)z$ for galaxies with $m &gt; 10^{11.5} m_{\sun}$. to reproduce the observedmass-to-light ratio ($m/l$) evolution, we determine the characteristic age ofthe stars in these $m &gt; 10^{11.5} m_{\sun}$ galaxies to be $3.0^{+0.3}_{-0.3}$gyrs, {\em i.e.} $z_{*}=3.4^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$. including selection effects causedby morphological bias (the ``progenitor bias''), we estimate an age of$2.1^{+0.2}_{-0.2}$ gyrs, or $z_{*} = 2.3^{+0.2}_{-0.2}$ for the ellipticalgalaxy population. massive cluster early-type galaxies appear to have a largefraction of stars that formed early in the history of the universe. however,there is a large scatter in the derived $m/l$ values, which is confirmed by thespread in the galaxies' colors. two lower mass galaxies in our $\bar{z}=1.25$sample have much lower $m/l$ values, implying significant star-formation closeto the epoch of observation. thus, even in the centers of massive clusters,there appears to have been significant star formation in some massive, $m\simeq 10^{11} m_{\sun}$, galaxies at $z\simeq 1.5$.

astro-ph;0501150	hst/acs weak lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster rdcs 1252.9-2927 at  z=1.24	we present a weak lensing analysis of one of the most distant massive galaxycluster known, rdcs 1252.9-2927 at z=1.24, using deep images from the advancedcamera for survey (acs) on board the hubble space telescope (hst). by takingadvantage of the depth and of the angular resolution of the acs images, wedetect for the first time at z&gt;1 a clear weak lensing signal in both the i(f775w) and z (f850lp) filters. we measure a 5-\sigma signal in the i band anda 3-\sigma signal in the shallower z band image. the two radial mass profilesare found to be in very good agreement with each other, and provide ameasurement of the total mass of the cluster inside a 1mpc radius of m(&lt;1mpc) =(8.0 +/- 1.3) x 10^14 m_\odot in the current cosmological concordance model h=0.70, \omega_m=0.3, \omega_\lambda=0.7, assuming a redshift distribution ofbackground galaxies as inferred from the hubble deep fields surveys. a weaklensing signal is detected out to the boundary of our field (3' radius,corresponding to 1.5mpc at the cluster redshift). we detect a small offsetbetween the centroid of the weak lensing mass map and the brightest clustergalaxy, and we discuss the possible origin of this discrepancy. the cumulativeweak lensing radial mass profile is found to be in good agreement with thex-ray mass estimate based on chandr and xmm-newton observations, at least outto r_500=0.5mpc.

astro-ph;0501224	the morphology - density relation in z ~ 1 clusters	we measure the morphology--density relation (mdr) and morphology-radiusrelation (mrr) for galaxies in seven z ~ 1 clusters that have been observedwith the advanced camera for surveys on board the hubble space telescope.simulations and independent comparisons of ourvisually derived morphologiesindicate that acs allows one to distinguish between e, s0, and spiralmorphologies down to zmag = 24, corresponding to l/l* = 0.21 and 0.30 at z =0.83 and z = 1.24, respectively. we adopt density and radius estimation methodsthat match those used at lower redshift in order to study the evolution of themdr and mrr. we detect a change in the mdr between 0.8 &lt; z &lt; 1.2 and thatobserved at z ~ 0, consistent with recent work -- specifically, the growth inthe bulge-dominated galaxy fraction, f_e+so, with increasing density proceedsless rapidly at z ~ 1 than it does at z ~ 0. at z ~ 1 and density &lt;= 500galaxies/mpc^2, we find &lt;f_e+s0&gt; = 0.72 +/- 0.10. at z ~ 0, an e+s0 populationfraction of this magnitude occurs at densities about 5 times smaller. theevolution in the mdr is confined to densities &gt;= 40 galaxies/mpc^2 and appearsto be primarily due to a deficit of s0 galaxies and an excess of spiral+irrgalaxies relative to the local galaxy population. the elliptical fraction -density relation exhibits no significant evolution between z = 1 and z = 0. wefind mild evidence to suggest that the mdr is dependent on the bolometric x-rayluminosity of the intracluster medium. implications for the evolution of thedisk galaxy population in dense regions are discussed in the context of theseobservations.

astro-ph;0502082	gemini near infrared spectrograph observations of a red star forming  galaxy at z=2.225: evidence for shock-ionization due to a galactic wind	recent studies have shown that k-luminous galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;2.5 have highhalpha line widths and high [nii]/halpha ratios. if these lines arise fromphoto-ionization by massive stars in hii regions these results imply thatmassive, metal rich galaxies exist at high redshift. here we investigate theionization mechanism in a galaxy with ks=19.1 and z=2.225 in the chandra deepfield south, using the new gemini near infrared spectrograph (gnirs). gnirs'cross-dispersed mode gives simultaneous access to the entire 1-2.5 micronwavelength range, allowing accurate measurements of line ratios of distantgalaxies. from the ratio of halpha/hbeta we infer that the line emitting gas isheavily obscured, with e(b-v)=0.8. the reddening is higher than that inferredpreviously from the uv-optical continuum emission, consistent with findings fornearby star burst galaxies. we find that the galaxy has seyfert-like lineratios, [nii]/halpha ~ 0.6 and [oiii]/hbeta ~ 6, which can be caused byphoto-ionization by an active galactic nucleus (agn) or shock ionization due toa strong galactic wind. although we cannot exclude the presence of an agn, thelack of agn spectral features in the rest-frame ultraviolet, the consistency ofradio, x-ray, and rest-frame uv star formation indicators, the fact that the[oiii]/hbeta ratio remains high out to ~10 kpc from the nucleus, and theobserved gas kinematics all argue for the wind hypothesis. similarshock-induced ionization is seen in nearby star burst galaxies with strongwinds. the evidence for shock ionization implies that measurements ofmetallicities and dynamical masses of star forming z&gt;2 galaxies should beregarded with caution, especially since the existence of strong galactic windsin these objects is well established.

astro-ph;0502228	mass-to-light ratios of field early-type galaxies at z~1 from ultra-deep  spectroscopy: evidence for mass-dependent evolution	we present an analysis of the fundamental plane for a sample of 27 fieldearly-type galaxies in the redshift range 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.15. the galaxies in thissample have high s/n spectra obtained at the vlt and high resolution imagingfrom the acs. we find that the mean evolution in m/l of our sample is $delta ln(m/l_b) = -1.74+/-0.16z$, with a large galaxy-to-galaxy scatter. this value canbe too low by 0.3 due to selection effects, resulting in $delta ln (m/l_b) =-1.43+/-0.16z$. the strong correlation between m/l and rest-frame colorindicates that the observed scatter is not due to measurement errors, but dueto intrinsic differences between the stellar populations of the galaxies. thispace of evolution is much faster than the evolution of cluster galaxies.however, we find that the measured m/l evolution strongly depends on galaxymass. for galaxies with masses $m&gt;2 x 10^11 msol$, we find no significantdifference between the evolution of field and cluster galaxies: $delta ln(m/l_b) = -1.20+/-0.18z for field galaxies and $delta ln (m/l_b) =-1.12+/-0.06z$ for cluster galaxies. the relation between the measured m/levolution and mass is partially due to selection effects. however, even whentaking selection effects into account, we still find a relation between m/levolution and mass, which is most likely caused by a lower mean age and alarger intrinsic scatter for low mass galaxies. results from lensing early-typegalaxies, which are mass-selected, show a very similar trend with mass. this,combined with our findings, provides evidence for down-sizing. previous studiesof the rate of evolution of field early-type galaxies found a large range ofmutually exclusive values. we show that these differences are largely caused bythe differences between fitting methods.

astro-ph;0503365	evolution in the cluster early-type galaxy size-surface brightness  relation at z =~ 1	we investigate the evolution in the distribution of surface brightness, as afunction of size, for elliptical and s0 galaxies in the two clusters rdcsj1252.9-2927, z=1.237 and rx j0152.7-1357, z=0.837. we use multi-color imagingwith the advanced camera for surveys on the hubble space telescope to determinethese sizes and surface brightnesses. using three different estimates of thesurface brightnesses, we find that we reliably estimate the surface brightnessfor the galaxies in our sample with a scatter of &lt; 0.2 mag and with systematicshifts of \lesssim 0.05 mag. we construct samples of galaxies with early-typemorphologies in both clusters. for each cluster, we use a magnitude limit in aband which closely corresponds to the rest-frame b, to magnitude limit of m_b =-18.8 at z=0, and select only those galaxies within the color-magnitudesequence of the cluster or by using our spectroscopic redshifts. we measureevolution in the rest-frame b surface brightness, and find -1.41 \+/- 0.14 magfrom the coma cluster of galaxies for rdcs j1252.9-2927 and -0.90 \+/- 0.12 magof evolution for rx j0152.7-1357, or an average evolution of (-1.13 \+/- 0.15)z mag. our statistical errors are dominated by the observed scatter in thesize-surface brightness relation, sigma = 0.42 \+/- 0.05 mag for rxj0152.7-1357 and sigma = 0.76 \+/- 0.10 mag for rdcs j1252.9-2927. we find nostatistically significant evolution in this scatter, though an increase in thescatter could be expected. overall, the pace of luminosity evolution we measureagrees with that of the fundamental plane of early-type galaxies, implying thatthe majority of massive early-type galaxies observed at z =~ 1 formed at highredshifts.

astro-ph;0503445	a dynamical simulation of the debris disk around hd 141569a	we study the dynamical origin of the structures observed in thescattered-light images of the resolved debris disk around hd 141569a. weexplore the roles of radiation pressure from the central star, gas drag fromthe gas disk, and the tidal forces from two nearby stars in creating andmaintaining these structures. we use a simple one-dimensional axisymmetricmodel to show that the presence of the gas helps confine the dust and that abroad ring of dust is produced if a central hole exists in the disk. this modelalso suggests that the disk is in a transient, excited dynamical state, as theobserved dust creation rate applied over the age of the star is inconsistentwith submillimeter mass measurements. we model in two dimensions the effects ofa fly-by encounter between the disk and a binary star in a prograde, parabolic,coplanar orbit. we track the spatial distribution of the disk's gas,planetesimals, and dust. we conclude that the surface density distributionreflects the planetesimal distribution for a wide range of parameters. our mostviable model features a disk of initial radius 400 au, a gas mass of 50m_earth, and beta = 4 and suggests that the system is being observed within4000 yr of the fly-by periastron. the model reproduces some features of hd141569a's disk, such as a broad single ring and large spiral arms, but it doesnot reproduce the observed multiple spiral rings or disk asymmetries nor theobserved clearing in the inner disk. for the latter, we consider the effect ofa 5 m_jup planet in an eccentric orbit on the planetesimal distribution of hd141569a.

astro-ph;0503454	distant red galaxies in the hubble ultra deep field	we take advantage of the hubble ultra deep field (udf) data to study therestframe optical and ultra violet (uv) morphologies of the novel population ofdistant red galaxies (drgs). six galaxies with j-ks &gt; 2.3 are found to ks=21.5,five of which have photometric redshifts z_phot &gt; 2, corresponding to a surfacedensity of 0.9/arcmin^2. the surface brightness distributions of the z_phot &gt; 2galaxies are better represented by exponential disks than r^{1/4}-laws. two ofthe z_phot &gt; 2 galaxies are extended, while three have compact morphologies.the restframe optical morphology of the z_phot &gt; 2 galaxies is quite differentfrom the restframe uv morphology: all the galaxies have red central componentswhich dominate in the nicmos h_{160}-band images, and distinct off-center bluefeatures which show up in (and often dominate) the acs images. the meanmeasured effective radius of the z_phot &gt; 2 galaxies is &lt;r_e&gt; =1.9+/-1.4 kpc,similar (within the errors) to the mean size of lbgs at similar redshifts. allthe drgs are resolved in the acs images, while four are resolved in the nicmosimages. two of the z_phot &gt; 2 galaxies are bright x-ray sources and hence hostagn. the diverse restframe optical and uv morphological properties of drgsderived here suggest that they have complex stellar populations, consisting ofboth evolved populations that dominate the mass and the restframe opticallight, and younger populations, which show up as patches of star formation inthe restframe uv light; in many ways resembling the properties of normal localgalaxies. this interpretation is supported by fits to the broadband seds, whichfor all five z_phot &gt; 2 are best represented by models with extended starformation histories and substantial amounts of dust.

astro-ph;0511053	the fundamental scaling relations of elliptical galaxies	(abridged) we examine the fundamental scaling relations of ellipticalgalaxies formed through mergers. using hundreds of simulations to judge theimpact of progenitor galaxy properties on merger remnants, we find that gasdissipation provides an important contribution to tilt in the fundamental planerelation. dissipationless mergers of disks produce remnants that occupy thevirial plane. as the gas content of disk galaxies is increased, the tilt of thefundamental plane relation increases and the slope of the re-m_* relationsteepens. for gas fractions fgas &gt; 30%, the simulated fundamental planescalings approach those observed in the k-band. in our simulations, feedbackfrom supermassive black hole growth has only a minor influence on thestellar-mass scaling relations of spheroidal galaxies, but may play a role inmaintaining the observed fundamental plane tilt at optical wavelengths bysuppressing residual star formation in merger remnants.  we estimate that \approx 40-100% of the fundamental plane tilt induced bystructural properties owes to trends in the central total-to-stellar mass ratiom_total/m_* produced by dissipation. lower mass systems obtain greater phase-space densities than higher mass systems, producing a galaxy mass-dependentcentral m_total/m_* and a corresponding tilt in the fundamental plane.

astro-ph;0511581	the evolution of rest-frame k-band properties of early-type galaxies  from z=1 to the present	we measure the evolution of the rest-frame k-band fundamental plane from z=1to the present by using irac imaging of a sample of early-type galaxies in thechandra deep field-south at z~1 with accurately measured dynamical masses. wefind that $m/l_k$ evolves as $\delta\ln{(m/l_k)}=(-1.18\pm0.10)z$, which isslower than in the b-band ($\delta\ln{(m/l_b)}=(-1.46\pm0.09)z$). in the b-bandthe evolution has been demonstrated to be strongly mass dependent. in thek-band we find a weaker trend: galaxies more massive than$m=2\times10^{11}m_{\odot}$ evolve as $\delta\ln{(m/l_k)}=(-1.01\pm0.16)z$;less massive galaxies evolve as $\delta\ln{(m/l_k)}=(-1.27\pm0.11)z$. asexpected from stellar population models the evolution in $m/l_k$ is slower thanthe evolution in $m/l_b$. however, when we make a quantitative comparison, wefind that the single burst bruzual-charlot models do not fit the results well,unless large dust opacities are allowed at z=1. models with a flat imf fitbetter, maraston models with a different treatment of agb stars fit best. theseresults show that the interpretation of rest-frame near-ir photometry isseverely hampered by model uncertainties and therefore that the determinationof galaxy masses from rest-frame near-ir photometry may be harder than wasthought before.

astro-ph;0601327	evolution of the color-magnitude relation in high-redshift clusters:  blue early-type galaxies and red pairs in rdcs j0910+5422	the color-magnitude relation has been determined for the rdcs j0910+5422cluster of galaxies at redshift z = 1.106. cluster members were selected fromhst acs images, combined with ground--based near--ir imaging and opticalspectroscopy. the observed early--type color--magnitude relation (cmr) in(i_775 -z_850) versus z_850 shows intrinsic scatters in color of 0.042 +/-0.010 mag and 0.044 +/- 0.020 mag for ellipticals and s0s, respectively. fromthe scatter about the cmr, a mean luminosity--weighted age t &gt; 3.3 gyr (z &gt; 3)is derived for the elliptical galaxies.  strikingly, the s0 galaxies in rdcs j0910+5422 are systematically bluer in(i_775 - z_850) by 0.07 +/- 0.02 mag, with respect to the ellipticals. theellipticity distribution as a function of color indicates that the face-on s0sin this particular cluster have likely been classified as elliptical. thus, ifanything, the offset in color between the elliptical and s0 populations may beeven more significant.  the color offset between s0 and e corresponds to an age difference of ~1 gyr,for a single-burst solar metallicity model. a solar metallicity model with anexponential decay in star formation will reproduce the offset for an age of 3.5gyr, i.e. the s0s have evolved gradually from star forming progenitors.  the early--type population in this cluster appears to be still forming. theblue early-type disk galaxies in rdcs j0910+5422 likely represent the directprogenitors of the more evolved s0s that follow the same red sequence asellipticals in other clusters.  thirteen red galaxy pairs are observed and the galaxies associated in pairsconstitute ~40% of the cmr galaxies in this cluster.

astro-ph;0608444	spitzer irac confirmation of z_850-dropout galaxies in the hubble ultra  deep field: stellar masses and ages at z~7	using spitzer irac mid-infrared imaging from the great observatories originsdeep survey, we study z_850-dropout sources in the hubble ultra deep field.after carefully removing contaminating flux from foreground sources, we clearlydetect two z_850-dropouts at 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron, while two others aremarginally detected. the mid-infrared fluxes strongly support theirinterpretation as galaxies at z~7, seen when the universe was only 750 myr old.the irac observations allow us for the first time to constrain the rest-frameoptical colors, stellar masses, and ages of the highest redshift galaxies.fitting stellar population models to the spectral energy distributions, we findphotometric redshifts in the range 6.7-7.4, rest-frame colors u-v=0.2-0.4,v-band luminosities l_v=0.6-3 x 10^10 l_sun, stellar masses 1-10 x 10^9 m_sun,stellar ages 50-200 myr, star formation rates up to ~25 m_sun/yr, and lowreddening a_v&lt;0.4. overall, the z=7 galaxies appear substantially less massiveand evolved than lyman break galaxies or distant red galaxies at z=2-3, butfairly similar to recently identified systems at z=5-6. the stellar massdensity inferred from our z=7 sample is rho* = 1.6^{+1.6}_{-0.8} x 10^6 m_sunmpc^-3 (to 0.3 l*(z=3)), in apparent agreement with recent cosmologicalhydrodynamic simulations, but we note that incompleteness and sample variancemay introduce larger uncertainties. the ages of the two most massive galaxiessuggest they formed at z&gt;8, during the era of cosmic reionization, but the starformation rate density derived from their stellar masses and ages is not nearlysufficient to reionize the universe. the simplest explanation for thisdeficiency is that lower-mass galaxies beyond our detection limit reionized theuniverse.

astro-ph;9507101	dust in the cores of early-type galaxies	the dust properties of all early-type galaxies imaged with the planetarycamera of the hst in cycles i-iii are examined. dust is detected in 31 out of64 galaxies, although the sample is biased against the detection of dust. fromthe distribution of observed axis ratios of the dust features it is inferredthat 78 \pm 16% of early-type galaxies contain nuclear dust. from thedependence of the angle between dust major axis and galaxy major axis on sizeand appearance of the dust, it is found that dust features with semi-major axissize a_d &gt; 250 pc are generally not settled. if it is assumed that dust laneswith a_d &lt; 250 pc are in equilibrium in the galaxy potential, the observeddistribution of misalignment angles can only be explained if ellipticalgalaxies have a mean triaxiality &lt;t&gt; &gt;= 0.4. the best fit is obtained for &lt;t&gt; =0.8, higher than values derived through other methods. this difference cannotbe explained by a dependence of $\langle t \rangle$ on radius. therefore, itseems dust is not always completely relaxed, even on the smallest scales.furthermore, the rotation axis of the dust does not generally coincide withthat of the stars. this seems to suggest that the dust is acquired fromoutside, and has some way of losing its angular momentum efficiently.

astro-ph;9707332	measuring non-axisymmetry in spiral galaxies	we present a method for measuring small deviations from axisymmetry of thepotential of a filled gas disk. the method is based on a higher order harmonicexpansion of the full velocity field of the disk. this expansion is made byfirst fitting a tilted-ring model to the velocity field of the gas disk andsubsequently expanding the velocity field along each ring into its harmonicterms. we use epicycle theory to derive equations for the harmonic terms in adistorted potential. the phase of each component of the distortion can varywith radius. we show that if the potential has a distortion of harmonic numberm, the velocity field as seen on the sky exhibits an m-1 and m+1 distortion. asis to be expected, the effects of a global elongation of the halo are similarto an m=2 spiral arm. the main difference is that the phase of the spiral armcan vary with radius. our method allows a measurement of epsilon_pot sin(2phi_2), where epsilon_pot is the elongation of the potential and phi_2 is oneof the viewing angles. using \hi data, one can probe the potential at radiibeyond the stellar disk, into the regime where dark matter is thought to be thedominant dynamical component. the method is applied the spiral galaxies ngc2403 and ngc 3198 and the harmonic terms are measured up to ninth order. wefind epsilon_pot sin(2 phi_2) to be 0.064 +/- 0.003 for ngc 2403 and 0.019 +/-0.003 for ngc 3198. more galaxies should be examined to separate viewing anglefrom elongation in a statistical way.

astro-ph;9911353	a high fraction of mergers in the cluster ms1054-03 at z=0.83	we used the hubble space telescope to take a wide field, multicolor image ofthe high redshift cluster ms1054-03 at z=0.83. the keck telescope was used totake 200 redshifts in the field. we have a total of 81 spectroscopicallyconfirmed cluster members with deep wfpc2 imaging. a surprisingly large numberof these cluster members are mergers: 13 out of 77 galaxies are classified asmerger remnants, or mergers in progress. most of these are red, and massive.their restframe b luminosities are amongst the brightest in the cluster: wefind that 5 out of the brightest 16 are mergers. no such bright mergers werefound in a lower redshift cluster with similar wide field coverage. the mergersin ms1054-03 are preferentially found in the outskirts of the cluster. thedistribution of pairs in the outskirts of the cluster shows an excess ofgalaxies with separation &lt; 10 h^-1 kpc, which is independent confirmation ofthe enhanced interaction rate. the fraction of mergers (17 %) is comparable tothe fraction of ellipticals (22 %). hence up to 50 % of low redshiftellipticals may have formed through mergers since z=1. there is no evidence forstrong star formation in most of the mergers. the mean stellar ages of themergers may therefore be much older than the ``assembly age'', i.e., the agesince the time the system was put together. these new results are qualitativelyconsistent with predictions from hierarchical galaxy formation, and areinconsistent with an early collapse for all early type galaxies.

0811.1986	the ellipticities of cluster early-type galaxies from z~1 to z~0: no  evolution in the overall distribution of bulge-to-disk ratios	we have compiled a sample of early-type cluster galaxies from 0 &lt; z &lt; 1.3 andmeasured the evolution of their ellipticity distributions. our sample contains487 galaxies in 17 z&gt;0.3 clusters with high quality space-based imaging and acomparable sample of 210 galaxies in 10 clusters at z&lt;0.05. we selectearly-type galaxies (elliptical and s0 galaxies) that fall within the clusterr_{200}, and which lie on the red-sequence in the magnitude range -19.3 &gt; m_b &gt;-21, after correcting for luminosity evolution. our ellipticity measurementsare made in a consistent manner over our whole sample. we perform extensivesimulations to quantify the systematic and statistical errors, and find that itis crucial to use psf-corrected model fits. we find that neither the medianellipticity, nor the shape of the ellipticity distribution of clusterearly-type galaxies evolves with redshift from z ~ 0 to z &gt; 1. these resultsare strongly suggestive of an unchanging overall bulge-to-disk ratiodistribution for cluster early-type galaxies over the last ~8gyr. this resultcontrasts with that from visual classifications which show that the fraction ofmorphologically-selected disk-dominated early-type galaxies, or s0s, issignificantly lower at z&gt;0.4 than at z~0. taking the ellipticity measurementsand assuming, as in all previous studies, that the intrinsic ellipticitydistribution of both elliptical and s0 galaxies remains constant, then weconclude from the lack of evolution in the observed early-type ellipticitydistribution that the relative fractions of ellipticals and s0s do not evolvefrom z~1 to z=0 for a red-sequence selected samples of galaxies in the cores ofclusters of galaxies.
