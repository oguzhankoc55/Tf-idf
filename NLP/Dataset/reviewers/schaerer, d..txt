0912.3007	the unusual niv]-emitter galaxy gds j033218.92-275302.7: star formation  or agn-driven winds from a massive galaxy at z=5.56	aims: we investigate the nature of the source gds j033218.92-275302.7atredshift ~ 5.56. methods: the sed of the source is well sampled by 16 bandsphotometry, from uv-optical, near infrared and mid-infrared (mid-ir).thedetection of signal in the mid-ir spitzer/irac bands 5.8, 8.0 um -- where thenebular emission contribution is less effective -- suggests the presence of abalmer break, signature of an underlying stellar population formed at earlierepochs. the optical spectrum shows a clear lya emission line together withsemi-forbidden niv] 1483.3-1486.5 also in emission. results: from the sedfitting and the lya modelling it turns out that the source seems to have anevolved component with stellar mass of ~5 x10^(10) msolar and age ~ 0.4 gyrs,and a young component with an age of ~ 0.01 gyrs and sfr in the range of 30-200msolar yr^(-1). the limits on the effective radius derived from the acs/z850and vlt/ks bands indicate that this galaxy is denser than the local ones withsimilar mass. a relatively high nebular gas column density is favored from thelya line modelling (nhi&gt;=10^(21) cm^(-2)). a vigorous outflow (~ 450 km/s) hasbeen measured from the optical spectrum,consistent with the lya modelling. fromacs observations it turns out that the region emitting lya photons is spatiallycompact and of the same order of the effective radius estimated at the ~1400arest-frame wavelength, whose emission is dominated by the stellar continuumand/or agn. the gas is blown out from the central region,but given the mass ofthe galaxy it is uncertain whether it will pollute the igm to large distances.we argue that a burst of star formation in a dense gas environment is active(possibly containing hot and massive stars and/or a low luminosity agn),superimposed to an already formed fraction of stellar mass (abridged).

0912.4384	rest-frame ultraviolet spectrum of the gravitationally lensed galaxy  `the 8 o'clock arc': stellar and interstellar medium properties	we present the first detailed analysis of the rest-frame uv spectrum of thegravitationally lensed lyman break galaxy (lbg), the `8 o'clock arc'. thespectrum of the 8 o'clock arc is rich in stellar and interstellar medium (ism)features, and presents several similarities to the well-known ms1512-cb58 lbg.the stellar photospheric absorption lines allowed us to constrain the systemicredshift, z_sys = 2.7350+/-0.0003, of the galaxy, and derive its stellarmetallicity, z=0.82 z_sol. with a total stellar mass of ~4.2x10^{11} m_sol, the8 o'clock arc agrees with the mass-metallicity relation found for z&gt;2star-forming galaxies. the 31 ism absorption lines detected led to theabundance measurements of 9 elements. the metallicity of the ism, z=0.65 z_sol(si), is very comparable to the metallicity of stars and ionized gas, andsuggests that the ism of the 8 o'clock arc has been rapidly polluted andenriched by ejecta of ob stars. the ism lines extend over ~1000 km/s and havetheir peak optical depth blueshifted relative to the stars, implying gasoutflows of about -120 km/s. the ly-alpha line is dominated by a dampedabsorption profile on top of which is superposed a weak emission, redshiftedrelative to the ism lines by about +690 km/s and resulting from multiplybackscattered ly-alpha photons emitted in the hii region surrounded by thecold, expanding ism shell. a homogeneous spherical radiation transfer shellmodel with a constant outflow velocity, determined by the observations, is ableto reproduce the observed ly-alpha line profile and dust content. these resultsfully support the scenario proposed earlier, where the diversity of ly-alphaline profiles in lbgs and ly-alpha emitters, from absorption to emission, ismostly due to variations of hi column density and dust content (abridged).

1005.3820	the herschel lensing survey (hls): overview	the herschel lensing survey (hls) will conduct deep pacs and spire imaging of~40 massive clusters of galaxies. the strong gravitational lensing power ofthese clusters will enable us to penetrate through the confusion noise, whichsets the ultimate limit on our ability to probe the universe with herschel.here, we present an overview of our survey and a summary of the major resultsfrom our science demonstration phase (sdp) observations of the bullet cluster(z=0.297). the sdp data are rich, allowing us to study not only the backgroundhigh-redshift galaxies (e.g., strongly lensed and distorted galaxies at z=2.8and 3.2) but also the properties of cluster-member galaxies. our preliminaryanalysis shows a great diversity of far-infrared/submillimeter spectral energydistributions (seds), indicating that we have much to learn with herschel aboutthe properties of galaxy seds. we have also detected the sunyaev-zel'dovich(sz) effect increment with the spire data. the success of this sdp programdemonstrates the great potential of the herschel lensing survey to produceexciting results in a variety of science areas.

0709.2046	eros found behind lensing clusters: ii.empirical properties,  classification, and sed modelling based on multi-wavelength observations	we study the properties and nature of extremely red galaxies (ero, r-k&gt;5.6)found behind two lensing clusters and compare them with other known galaxypopulations. new hst/acs observations, spitzer irac and mips, and chandra/acisobservations of the two lensing clusters abell 1835 and ac114 contemplate ourearlier optical and near-ir observations and have been used to study extremelyred objects (eros) in these deep fields. we have found 6 and 9 eros in abell1835 and ac114. several (7) of these objects are undetected up to the i and/orz band, and are hence ``optical'' drop-out sources. the photometric redshiftsof most of our sources (80%) are z~0.7-1.5. according to simple colour-colourdiagrams the majority of our objects would be classified as hosting old stellarpopulations. however, there are clear signs of dusty starbursts for severalamong them. these objects correspond to the most extreme ones in r-k colour. weestimate a surface density of (0.97+-0.31) arcmin-2 for eros with (r-k&gt;5.6) atk&lt;20.5. among our 15 eros 6 (40 %) also classify as distant red galaxies(drgs). 11 of 13 eros with available irac photometry also fulfil the selectioncriteria for irac selected eros (ieros) of yan et al. (2004). sed modellingshows that ~ 36 % of the ieros in our sample are luminous or ultra-luminousinfrared galaxies ((u)lirg). some very red drgs are found to be very dustystarbursts, even (u)lirgs, as also supported by their mid-ir photometry. noindication for agns is found, although faint activity cannot be excluded forall objects. from mid-ir and x-ray data 5 objects are clearly classified asstarbursts. the derived properties are quite similar to those of drgs andieros, except for 5 extreme objects in terms of colours, for which a very highextinction (av&gt;3) is found.

1105.0921	the spectral evolution of the first galaxies. i. james webb space  telescope detection limits and color criteria for population iii galaxies	the james webb space telescope (jwst) is expected to revolutionize ourunderstanding of the high-redshift universe, and may be able to test theprediction that the first, chemically pristine (population iii) stars formedwith very high characteristic masses. since isolated population iii stars arelikely to be beyond the reach of jwst, small population iii galaxies may offerthe best prospects of directly probing the properties of metal-free stars.here, we present yggdrasil, a new spectral synthesis code geared towards thefirst galaxies. using this model, we explore the jwst imaging detection limitsfor population iii galaxies and investigate to what extent such objects may beidentified based on their jwst colours. we predict that jwst should be able todetect population iii galaxies with stellar population masses as low as ~10^5msolar at z=10 in ultra deep exposures. over limited redshift intervals, it mayalso be possible to use colour criteria to select population iii galaxycandidates for follow-up spectroscopy. the colours of young population iiigalaxies dominated by direct star light can be used to probe the stellarinitial mass function (imf), but this requires almost complete leakage ofionizing photons into the intergalactic medium. the colours of objectsdominated by nebular emission show no corresponding imf sensitivity. we alsonote that a clean selection of population iii galaxies at z~7-8 can be achievedby adding two jwst/miri filters to the jwst/nircam filter sets usuallydiscussed in the context of jwst ultra deep fields.

1109.1333	the properties of the brightest lyman alpha emitters at z~5.7	(abridged) we use deep vlt optical and near-ir spectroscopy and deepspitzer/irac imaging to examine the properties of two of the most luminouslyman alpha emitters at z=5.7. the continuum red-ward of the lyman alpha lineis clearly detected in both objects, thus facilitating a relatively accuratemeasurement (10--20% uncertainties) of the observed rest-frame equivalentwidths, which are around 160 angstroms for both objects. through detailedmodelling of the profile of the lyman alpha line with a 3-d monte-carloradiative transfer code, we estimate the intrinsic rest-frame equivalent widthof lyman alpha and find values that are around 300 angstroms, which is at theupper end of the range allowed for very young, moderately metal-poorstar-forming galaxies. however, the uncertainties are large and values as highas 700 angstroms are permitted by the data. both lyman alpha emitters aredetected at 3.6 micron in deep images taken with the spitzer space telescope.we use these measurements, the measurement of the continuum red-ward of lymanalpha and other photometry to constrain the spectral energy distributions ofthese very luminous lyman alpha emitters and to compare them to three similarlyman alpha emitters from the literature. the contribution from nebularemission is included in our models: excluding it results in significantlyhigher masses. evidence for dust is found in all objects, and emission fromnebular lines often make a dominant contribution to the rest frame 3.6 micronflux. rich in emission lines, these objects are prime targets for the nextgeneration of extremely large telescopes, jwst and alma.

1111.1234	the first infrared study of the close environment of a long gamma-ray  burst	we present a characterization of the close environment of grb980425 based on5-160mic spectro-imaging obtained with spitzer. the gamma-ray burst grb980425occurred in a nearby (z=0.0085) sbc-type dwarf galaxy, at a projected distanceof 900pc from an hii region with strong signatures of wolf-rayet (wr) stars.while this "wr region" produces less than 5% of the b-band emission of thehost, we find that it is responsible for 45+/-10% of the total infraredluminosity, with a maximum contribution reaching 75% at 25-30mic. this atypicalproperty is rarely observed among morphologically-relaxed dwarves, suggesting astrong causal link with the grb event. the luminosity of the wr region(l_8-1000mic=4.6x10^8 lsol), the peak of its spectral energy distribution at&lt;~100mic and the presence of highly-ionized emission lines (e.g., [neiii]) alsoreveal extremely young (&lt;5myr) star-forming activity, with a typical time-scaleof only 47myr to double the stellar mass already built. finally, the mid-irover b-band luminosity ratio in this region is substantially higher than instar-forming galaxies with similar l_ir, but it is lower than in youngdust-enshrouded stellar clusters. considering the modest obscuration measuredfrom the silicate features (tau_9.7mic ~ 0.015), this suggests that the wrregion is dominated by one or several star clusters that have either partlyescaped or cleared out their parent molecular cloud. combined with theproperties characterizing the whole population of grb hosts, our resultsreinforce the idea that long grbs mostly happen within or in the vicinity ofrelatively unobscured galactic regions harboring very recent star formation.

1207.7303	multiwavelength analysis of the lyman alpha emitting galaxy haro 2:  relation between the diffuse lyman alpha and soft x-ray emissions	in order to use lyman alpha (lya) emission as star formation tracer incosmological studies, we must understand how the resonant scattering affectsthe escape fraction of the lya photons. thus, high spatial resolutionmultiwavelength studies of nearby lya emitters, like haro 2, are highly needed.for that purpose, we have used chandra x-ray and hst (uv, optical and nir)images of haro 2, and stis and ground-based spectral images along its major andminor axes, to characterize the lya emission and the properties of the stellarpopulation. the uv, ha (halpha) and fir luminosities of the haro 2 nuclearstarburst are reproduced using evolutionary synthesis models assuming a youngstellar population with ages ~3.5-5.0 myr, affected by differentialinterstellar extinctions. the observed x-ray emission is attributed to gasheated by the mechanical energy released by the starburst (soft component) anda ultra-luminous x-ray source candidate (hard). both compact and diffuse lyacomponents are observed. whereas lya is spatially decoupled from balmer linesemission, balmer decrement and uv continuum, the diffuse lya component isspatially correlated with the diffuse soft x-ray emission. moreover, unlike thecompact one, diffuse lya shows luminosities larger than predicted from ha,assuming case b recombination and dust extinction as derived from ha/hbeta. wepropose that, whereas the compact lya emission is associated to the massivestellar clusters and is affected by outflows and dust extinction, the diffuselya originates in gas ionized by the hot plasma responsible for the soft x-rayradiation, as suggested by their spatial correlation and by the measuredl(ha)/lsoftx ratios. calibration of lya as star formation rate tracer shouldtherefore include both effects (destruction vs. enhancement) to avoid biases inthe study of galaxies at cosmological distances.

1303.2011	neutral gas in lyman-alpha emitting galaxies haro 11 and eso 338-ig04  measured through sodium absorption	context. the lyman alpha emission line of galaxies is an important tool forfinding galaxies at high redshift, and thus probe the structure of the earlyuniverse. however, the resonance nature of the line and its sensitivity to dustand neutral gas is still not fully understood.  aims. we present measurements of the velocity, covering fraction and opticaldepth of neutral gas in front of two well known local blue compact galaxiesthat show lyman alpha in emission: eso 338-ig 04 and haro 11. we thus testobservationally the hypothesis that lyman alpha can escape through neutral gasby being doppler shifted out of resonance.  methods. we present integral field spectroscopy from the giraffe/argusspectrograph at vlt/flames in paranal, chile. the excellent wavelengthresolution allows us to accurately measure the velocity of the ionized andneutral gas through the h-alpha emission and na d absorption, which traces theionized medium and cold interstellar gas, respectively. we also presentindependent measurements with the vlt/x-shooter spectrograph which confirm ourresults.  results. for eso 338-ig04, we measure no significant shift of neutral gas.the best fit velocity is -15 (16) km/s. for haro 11, we see an outflow fromknot b at 44 (13) km/s and infalling gas towards knot c with 32 (12) km/s.based on the relative strength of the na d absorption lines, we estimate lowcovering fractions of neutral gas (down to 10%) in all three cases.  conclusions. the na d absorption likely occurs in dense clumps with highercolumn densities than where the bulk of the ly-alpha scattering takes place.still, we find no strong correlation between outflowing neutral gas and a highlyman alpha escape fraction. the lyman alpha photons from these two galaxiesare therefore likely escaping due to a low column density and/or coveringfraction.

1308.6707	an extended herschel drop-out source in the center of as1063, a 'normal'  dusty galaxy at z=6.1 or sz substructures?	in the course of our 870um apex/laboca follow up of the herschel lensingsurvey we have detected a source in as1063 (rxc j2248.7-4431), that has nocounterparts in any of the herschel pacs/spire bands, it is a herschel'drop-out' with s_870/s_500&gt;0.5. the 870um emission is extended and centered onthe brightest cluster galaxy suggesting either a multiply imaged backgroundsource or substructure in the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) increment due toinhomogeneities in the hot cluster gas of this merging cluster. we discuss bothinterpretations with emphasis on the putative lensed source. based on theobserved properties and on our lens model we find that this source could be thefirst smg with a moderate far infrared luminosity (l_fir&lt;10^12 l_sol) detectedso far at z&gt;4. in deep hst observations we identified a multiply imaged z~6source and we measured its spectroscopic redshift z=6.107 with vlt/fors. thissource could be associated with the putative smg but it is most likely offsetspatially by 10-30kpc and they could be interacting galaxies. with a firluminosity in the range [5-15]x10^{11} l_sol corresponding to a star formationrate in the range [80-260]m_sol/yr, this smg would be more representative thanthe extreme starbursts usually detected at z&gt;4. with a total magnification of~25 it would open a unique window to the 'normal' dusty galaxies at the end ofthe epoch of reionization.

1310.2655	star formation histories, extinction, and dust properties of strongly  lensed z~1.5-3 star-forming galaxies from the herschel lensing survey	multi-wavelength, optical to ir/sub-mm observations of 5 strongly lensedgalaxies identified by the herschel lensing survey, plus two well-studiedlensed galaxies, ms1512-cb58 and the cosmic eye, for which we also provideupdated herschel measurements, are used to determine the physical properties ofz~1.5-3 star-forming galaxies close to or below the detection limits of blankfields. we constrain their stellar and dust content, determine star formationrates and histories, dust attenuation and extinction laws, and other relatedproperties. we perform sed-fits of the full photometry of each object as wellfor the optical and infrared parts separately, exploring various parameters,including nebular emission. the ir observations and emission line measurements,where available, are used a posteriori constraints on the models. besides thevarious stellar population models we explore, we use the observed ir/uv ratioto estimate the extinction and create "energy conserving models", thatconstrain most accurately the physical properties of our sources. our samplehas a median lensing-corrected ir luminosity ~ 3e11 lsun, stellar massesbetween 2e9 and 2e11 msun, and ir/uv luminosity ratios spanning a wide range.the dust masses of our galaxies are in the range 2 to 17e7 msun, extendingprevious studies at the same redshift down to lower masses. we do not find anyparticular trend of the dust temperature tdust with ir luminosity, suggestingan overall warmer dust regime at our redshift regardless of luminosity. lensingenables us to study the detailed physical properties of individual ir-detectedz~1.5-3 galaxies up to a factor ~10 fainter than achieved with deep blank fieldobservations. we demonstrate that multi-wavelength observations combiningstellar and dust emission can constrain star formation histories and extinctionlaws of star-forming galaxies.

1401.8263	the first frontier fields cluster: 4.5{\mu}m excess in a z~8 galaxy  candidate in abell 2744	we present in this letter the first analysis of a z~8 galaxy candidate foundin the hubble and spitzer imaging data of abell 2744, as part of the hubblefrontier fields legacy program. we applied the most commonly-used methods toselect exceptionally high-z galaxies by combining non-detection andcolor-criteria using seven hst bands. we used galfit on irac images for fittingand subtracting contamination of bright nearby sources. the physical propertieshave been inferred from sed-fitting using templates with and without nebularemission. this letter is focussed on the brightest candidate we found(m$_{f160w}$=26.2) over the 4.9 arcmin$^2$ field of view covered by the wfc3.it shows a non-detection in the acs bands and at 3.6{\mu}m whereas it isclearly detected at 4.5{\mu}m with rather similar depths. this break in theirac data could be explained by strong [oiii]+h{\beta} lines at z~8 whichcontribute to the 4.5{\mu}m photometry. the best photo-z is found atz~8.0$^{+0.2}_{-0.5}$, although solutions at low-redshift (z~1.9) cannot becompletely excluded, but they are strongly disfavoured by the sed-fitting work.the amplification factor is relatively small at {\mu}=1.49$\pm$0.02. the starformation rate in this object is ranging from 8 to 60 mo/yr, the stellar massis in the order of m$_{\star}$=(2.5-10) x 10$^{9}$mo and the size isr~0.35$\pm$0.15 kpc. this object is one of the first z~8 lbg candidates showinga clear break between 3.6{\mu}m and 4.5{\mu}m which is consistent with the iracproperties of the first spectroscopically confirmed galaxy at a similarredshift. due to its brightness, the redshift of this object could potentiallybe confirmed by near infrared spectroscopy with current 8-10m telescopes. thenature of this candidate will be revealed in the coming months with the arrivalof new acs and spitzer data, increasing the depth at optical and near-irwavelengths.

1403.0743	constraints on the star-formation rate of z~3 lbgs with measured  metallicity in the candels goods-south field	we analyse 14 lbgs at z~2.8-3.8 constituting the only sample where both aspectroscopic measurement of their metallicity and deep ir observations(candels+hugs survey) are available. fixing the metallicity of populationsynthesis models to the observed values, we determine best-fit physicalparameters under different assumptions about the star-formation history andalso consider the effect of nebular emission. for comparison we determine theuv slope of the objects, and use it to estimate their sfr_uv99 by correctingthe uv luminosity following meurer et al. (1999). a comparison between sfrobtained through sed-fitting (sfr_fit) and the sfr_uv99 shows that the latterare underestimated by a factor 2-10, regardless of the assumed sfh. other sfrindicators (radio, far-ir, x-ray, recombination lines) coherently indicate sfrsa factor of 2-4 larger than sfr_uv99 and in closer agreement with sfr_fit. thisdiscrepancy is due to the solar metallicity implied by the usual beta-a1600conversion factor. we propose a refined relation, appropriate for sub-solarmetallicity lbgs: a1600 = 5.32+1.99beta. this relation reconciles thedust-corrected uv with the sed-fitting and the other sfr indicators. we showthat the fact that z~3 galaxies have sub-solar metallicity implies an upwardrevision by a factor of ~1.5-2 of the global sfrd, depending on the assumptionsabout the age of the stellar populations. we find very young best-fit ages(10-500 myrs) for all our objects. from a careful examination of theuncertainties in the fit and the amplitude of the balmer break we conclude thatthere is little evidence of the presence of old stellar population in at leasthalf of the lbgs in our sample, suggesting that these objects are probablycaught during a huge star-formation burst, rather than being the result of asmooth evolution.

1403.3691	discovery of a rich proto-cluster at z=2.9 and associated diffuse cold  gas in the vimos ultra-deep survey (vuds)	[abridged] we characterise a massive proto-cluster at z=2.895 that we foundin the cosmos field using the spectroscopic sample of the vimos ultra-deepsurvey (vuds). this is one of the rare structures at z~3 not identified aroundagns or radio galaxies, so it is an ideal laboratory to study galaxy formationin dense environments. the structure comprises 12 galaxies with securespectroscopic redshift in an area of 7'x8', in a z bin of dz=0.016. themeasured galaxy number overdensity is delta_g=12+/-2. this overdensity hastotal mass of m~8.1x10^(14)m_sun in a volume of 13x15x17 mpc^3. simulationsindicate that such an overdensity at z~2.9 is a proto-cluster that willcollapse in a cluster of total mass m~2.5x10^(15)m_sun at z=0. we compare theproperties of the galaxies within the overdensity with a control sample at thesame z but outside the overdensity. we did not find any statisticallysignificant difference between the properties (stellar mass, sfr, ssfr, nuv-r,r-k) of the galaxies inside and outside the overdensity. the stacked spectrumof galaxies in the overdensity background shows a significant absorptionfeature at the wavelength of lya redshifted at z=2.895 (lambda=4736 a), with arest frame ew = 4+/- 1.4 a. stacking only background galaxies withoutintervening sources at z~2.9 along their line of sight, we find that thisabsorption feature has a rest frame ew of 10.8+/-3.7 a, with a detection s/n of~4. these ew values imply a high column density (n(hi)~3-20x10^(19)cm^(-2)),consistent with a scenario where such absorption is due to intervening cold gasstreams, falling into the halo potential wells of the proto-cluster galaxies.however, we cannot exclude the hypothesis that this absorption is due to thediffuse gas within the overdensity.

1403.4230	vimos ultra-deep survey (vuds): witnessing the assembly of a massive  cluster at z~3.3	using new spectroscopic observations obtained as part of the vimos ultra-deepsurvey (vuds), we perform a systematic search for overdense environments in theearly universe ($z&gt;2$) and report here on the discovery of cl j0227-0421, amassive protocluster at $z=3.29$. this protocluster is characterized by boththe large overdensity of spectroscopically confirmed members,$\delta_{gal}=10.5\pm2.8$, and a significant overdensity in photometricredshift members. the halo mass of this protocluster is estimated, by a varietyof methods, to be roughly $3\times10^{14}$ $\mathcal{m}_{\odot}$ at $z\sim3.3$,which, evolved to $z=0$ results in a halo mass rivaling or exceeding that ofthe coma cluster. the properties of 19 spectroscopically confirmed membergalaxies are compared with a large sample of vuds/vvds galaxies in lowerdensity field environments at similar redshifts. we find tentative evidence foran excess of redder, brighter, and more massive galaxies within the confines ofthe protocluster relative to the field population, which suggests that we maybe observing the beginning of environmentally-induced quenching. the propertiesof these galaxies are investigated, including a discussion of the brightestprotocluster galaxy which appears to be undergoing vigorous coeval nuclear andstarburst activity. the remaining member galaxies appear to havecharacteristics which are largely similar to the field population. though wefind weaker evidence of the suppression of the median star formation ratesamongst and differences in stacked spectra of member galaxies with respect tothe field, we defer any conclusions of these trends to future work with theensemble of protostructures that are found in the full vuds sample.

1403.7687	physical properties and evolutionary state of the lyman alpha emitting  starburst galaxy iras 08339+6517	though lyman alpha emission (lya) is one of the most used tracers of massivestar formation at high redshift, a correct understanding of radiation transfereffects by neutral gas is required to properly quantify the star formation ratealong the history of the universe. we are embarked in a program to study theproperties of the lya emission (spectral profile, spatial distribution,relation to balmer lines intensity,...) in several local starburst galaxies. wepresent here the results obtained for iras 08339+6517.  using evolutionary population synthesis models, we have characterized theproperties of the starburst (uv continuum, halpha, total infrared and x-rayemissions, etc.), which transformed 1.4e+8 mo of gas into stars around 5-6 myrago. in addition to the central compact emission blob, we have identified adiffuse lya emission component smoothly distributed over the whole central areaof iras 08339+6517. this diffuse emission is spatially decoupled from the uvcontinuum, the halpha emission or the halpha/hbeta ratio. both locally andglobally, the lya/halpha ratio is lower than the case b predictions, even afterreddening correction, with an overall lya escape fraction of only 4%.  we conclude that in iras 08339+6517 the resonant scattering of lya photons byan outflowing shell of neutral gas causes their highly-efficient destruction bydust, which explains the low lya escape fraction measured. these results stressagain the importance of a proper correction of scattering and transfer effectswhen using lya to derive the star formation rate in high-redshift galaxies.

1404.2958	using lyman-alpha to detect galaxies that leak lyman continuum	we propose to infer ionising continuum leaking properties of galaxies bylooking at their lyman-alpha line profiles. we carry out lyman-alpha radiationtransfer calculations in two models of hii regions which are porous to ionisingcontinuum escape: 1) the so-called "density bounded" media, in which massivestars produce enough ionising photons to keep the surrounding interstellarmedium transparent to the ionising continuum, i.e almost totally ionised, and2) "riddled ionisation-bounded" media, surrounded by neutral interstellarmedium, but with holes, i.e. with a covering factor lower than unity. thelyman-alpha spectra emergent from these configurations have distinctivefeatures: 1) a "classical" asymmetric redshifted profile in the first case, butwith a small shift of the maximum of the profile compare to the systemicredshift (vpeak &lt; 150 km/s); 2) a main peak at the systemic redshift in thesecond case (vpeak = 0 km/s), with, as a consequence, a non-zero lyman-alphaflux bluewards the systemic redshift. assuming that in a galaxy leakingionising photons, the lyman-alpha component emerging from the leaking starcluster(s) dominates the total lyman-alpha spectrum, the lyman-alpha shape maybe used as a pre-selection tool to detect lyman continuum (lyc) leakinggalaxies, in objects with well determined systemic redshift, and high spectralresolution lyman-alpha spectra (r &gt;= 4000). the examination of a sample of 10local starbursts with high resolution hst-cos lyman-alpha spectra and known inthe literature as lyc leakers or leaking candidates, corroborates ourpredictions. observations of lyman-alpha profiles at high resolution shouldshow definite signatures revealing the escape of lyman continuum photons fromstar-forming galaxies.

1407.5793	new constraints on dust emission and uv attenuation of z=6.5-7.5  galaxies from millimeter observations	we have targeted two recently discovered lyman break galaxies (lbgs) tosearch for dust continuum and [cii] 158 micron line emission. the stronglylensed z~6.8 lbg a1703-zd1 behind the galaxy cluster abell 1703, and thespectroscopically confirmed z=7.508 lbg z8-gnd-5296 in the goods-n field havebeen observed with the plateau de bure interferometer (pdbi) at 1.2mm. theseobservations have been combined with those of three z&gt;6.5 lya emitters (namedhcm6a, himiko, and iok-1), for which deep measurements were recently obtainedwith the pdbi and alma. [cii] is undetected in both galaxies, providing a deepupper limit for abell1703-zd1, comparable to recent alma non-detections. dustcontinuum emission from abell1703-zd1 and z8-gnd-5296 is not detected with anrms of 0.12 and 0.16 mjy/beam. from these non-detections we derive upper limitson their ir luminosity and star formation rate, dust mass, and uv attenuation.thanks to strong gravitational lensing the limit for abell1703-zd1 is probingthe sub-lirg regime ($l_{ir} &lt;8.1 \times 10^{10}$ lsun) and very low dustmasses ($m_d&lt;1.6 \times 10^7$ msun). we find that all five galaxies arecompatible with the calzetti irx-$\beta$ relation, their uv attenuation iscompatible with several indirect estimates from other methods (the uv slope,extrapolation of the attenuation measured from the ir/uv ratio at lowerredshift, and sed fits), and the dust-to-stellar mass ratio is not incompatiblewith that of galaxies from z=0 to 3. for their stellar mass the high-z galaxiesstudied here have an attenuation below the one expected from the mean relationof low redshift (z&lt;1.5) galaxies. more and deeper (sub)-mm data are clearlyneeded to directly determine the uv attenuation and dust content of thedominant population of high-z star-forming galaxies and to establish morefirmly their dependence on stellar mass, redshift, and other properties.

1411.5688	the evolution of clustering length, large-scale bias and host halo mass  at 2&lt;z&lt;5 in the vimos ultra deep survey (vuds)	we investigate the evolution of galaxy clustering for galaxies in theredshift range 2.0&lt;$z$&lt;5.0 using the vimos ultra deep survey (vuds). we presentthe projected (real-space) two-point correlation function $w_p(r_p)$ measuredby using 3022 galaxies with robust spectroscopic redshifts in two independentfields (cosmos and vvds-02h) covering in total 0.8 deg$^2$. we quantify how thescale dependent clustering amplitude $r_0$ changes with redshift making use ofmock samples to evaluate and correct the survey selection function. using apower-law model $\xi(r) = (r/r_0)^{-\gamma}$ we find that the correlationfunction for the general population is best fit by a model with a clusteringlength $r_0$=3.95$^{+0.48}_{-0.54}$ h$^{-1}$mpc and slope$\gamma$=1.8$^{+0.02}_{-0.06}$ at $z$~2.5, $r_0$=4.35$\pm$0.60 h$^{-1}$mpc and$\gamma$=1.6$^{+0.12}_{-0.13}$ at $z$~3.5. we use these clustering parametersto derive the large-scale linear galaxy bias $b_l^{pl}$, between galaxies anddark matter. we find $b_l^{pl}$ = 2.68$\pm$0.22 at redshift $z$~3 (assuming$\sigma_8$ = 0.8), significantly higher than found at intermediate and lowredshifts. we fit an hod model to the data and we obtain that the average halomass at redshift $z$~3 is $m_h$=10$^{11.75\pm0.23}$ h$^{-1}$m$_{\odot}$. fromthis fit we confirm that the large-scale linear galaxy bias is relatively highat $b_l^{hod}$ = 2.82$\pm$0.27. comparing these measurements with similarmeasurements at lower redshifts we infer that the star-forming population ofgalaxies at $z$~3 should evolve into the massive and bright ($m_r$&lt;-21.5)galaxy population which typically occupy haloes of mass $\langle m_h\rangle$ =10$^{13.9}$ h$^{-1}$ $m_{\odot}$ at redshift $z$=0.

1412.5584	the stellar mass - halo mass relation from galaxy clustering in vuds: a  high star formation efficiency at z~3	the relation between the galaxy stellar mass m_star and the dark matter halomass m_h gives important information on the efficiency in forming stars andassembling stellar mass in galaxies. we present the stellar mass to halo massratio (smhr) measurements at redshifts 2&lt;z&lt;5, obtained from the vimos ultradeep survey. we use halo occupation distribution (hod) modelling of clusteringmeasurements on ~3000 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts to derive the darkmatter halo mass m_h, and sed fitting over a large set of multi-wavelength datato derive the stellar mass m_star and compute the smhr=m_star/m_h. we find thatthe smhr ranges from 1% to 2.5% for galaxies with m_star=1.3x10^9 m_sun tom_star=7.4x10^9 m_sun in dm halos with m_h=1.3x10^{11} m_sun} to m_h=3x10^{11}m_sun. we derive the integrated star formation efficiency (isfe) of thesegalaxies and find that the star formation efficiency is a moderate 6-9% forlower mass galaxies while it is relatively high at 16% for galaxies with themedian stellar mass of the sample ~7x10^9 m_sun. the lower isfe at lower massesmay indicate that some efficient means of suppressing star formation is at work(like sne feedback), while the high isfe for the average galaxy at z~3 isindicating that these galaxies are efficiently building-up their stellar massat a key epoch in the mass assembly process. we further infer that the averagemass galaxy at z~3 will start experiencing star formation quenching within afew hundred millions years.

1502.03842	alma detection of [cii] 158 micron emission from a strongly lensed z=2  star-forming galaxy	our objectives are to determine the properties of the interstellar medium(ism) and of star-formation in typical star-forming galaxies at high redshift.following up on our previous multi-wavelength observations with hst, spitzer,herschel, and the plateau de bure interferometer (pdbi), we have studied astrongly lensed z=2.013 galaxy, the arc behind the galaxy cluster macsj0451+0006, with alma to measure the [cii] 158 micron emission line, one of themain coolants of the ism. [cii] emission from the southern part of this galaxyis detected at 10 $\sigma$. taking into account strong gravitational lensing,which provides a magnification of $\mu=49$, the intrinsic lensing-corrected[cii]158 micron luminosity is $l(cii)=1.2 \times 10^8 l_\odot$. the observedratio of [cii]-to-ir emission, $l(cii)/l(fir) \approx (1.2-2.4) \times10^{-3}$, is found to be similar to that in nearby galaxies. the same alsoholds for the observed ratio $l(cii)/l(co)=2.3 \times 10^3$, which iscomparable to that of star-forming galaxies and active galaxy nuclei (agn) atlow redshift. we utilize strong gravitational lensing to extend diagnosticstudies of the cold ism to an order of magnitude lower luminosity ($l(ir) \sim(1.1-1.3) \times 10^{11} l_\odot$) and sfr than previous work at high redshift.while larger samples are needed, our results provide evidence that the cold ismof typical high redshift galaxies has physical characteristics similar tonormal star forming galaxies in the local universe.

1502.04708	peering through the holes: the far uv color of star-forming galaxies at  z~3-4 and the escaping fraction of ionizing radiation	we aim to investigate the effect of the escaping ionizing radiation on thecolor selection of high redshift galaxies and identify candidate lymancontinuum (lyc) emitters. the intergalactic medium prescription of inoue etal.(2014) and galaxy synthesis models of bruzual&amp;charlot (2003) have been usedto properly treat the ultraviolet stellar emission, the stochasticity of theintergalactic transmission and mean free path in the ionizing regime. colortracks are computed by turning on/off the escape fraction of ionizingradiation. at variance with recent studies, a careful treatment of igmtransmission leads to no significant effects on the high-redshift broad-bandcolor selection. the decreasing mean free path of ionizing photons withincreasing redshift further diminishes the contribution of the lyc tobroad-band colors. we also demonstrate that prominent lyc sources can beselected under suitable conditions by calculating the probability of a nullescaping ionizing radiation. the method is applied to a sample of galaxiesextracted from the goods-s field. a known lyc source at z=3.795 is successfullyrecovered as a lyc emitter candidate and another convincing candidate atz=3.212 is reported. a detailed analysis of the two sources (including theirvariability and morphology) suggests a possible mixture of stellar andnon-stellar (agn) contribution in the ultraviolet. conclusions: classicalbroad-band color selection of 2.5&lt;z&lt;4.5 galaxies does not prevent the inclusionof lyc emitters in the selected samples. large fesc in relatively brightgalaxies (l&gt;0.1l*) could be favored by the presence of a faint agn not easilydetected at any wavelength. a hybrid stellar and non-stellar (agn) ionizingemission could coexist in these systems and explain the tensions found amongthe uv excess and the stellar population synthesis models reported inliterature.

1508.04476	the brightest young star clusters in ngc 5253	the nearby dwarf starburst galaxy ngc5253 hosts a number of young, massivestar clusters, the two youngest of which are centrally concentrated andsurrounded by thermal radio emission (the `radio nebula'). to investigate therole of these clusters in the starburst energetics, we combine new and archivalhubble space telescope images of ngc5253 with wavelength coverage from 1500 angto 1.9 micron in 13 filters. these include h-alpha, p-beta, and p-alpha, andthe imaging from the hubble treasury program legus (legacy extragalactic uvsurvey). the extraordinarily well-sampled spectral energy distributions enablemodeling with unprecedented accuracy the ages, masses, and extinctions of the 9optically brightest clusters (m_v &lt; -8.8) and the two young radio nebulaclusters. the clusters have ages ~1-15 myr and masses ~1x10^4 - 2.5x10^5 m_sun.the clusters' spatial location and ages indicate that star formation has becomemore concentrated towards the radio nebula over the last ~15 myr. the mostmassive cluster is in the radio nebula; with a mass 2.5x10^5 m_sun and an age~1 myr, it is 2-4 times less massive and younger than previously estimated. itis within a dust cloud with a_v~50 mag, and shows a clear nearir excess, likelyfrom hot dust. the second radio nebula cluster is also ~1 myr old, confirmingthe extreme youth of the starburst region. these two clusters account for abouthalf of the ionizing photon rate in the radio nebula, and will eventuallysupply about 2/3 of the mechanical energy in present-day shocks. additionalsources are required to supply the remaining ionizing radiation, and mayinclude very massive stars.

astro-ph;0403415	puzzling wind properties of young massive stars in smc-n81	we present a quantitative study of the stellar and wind properties of massivestars in the compact star forming region smc-n81. non-lte spherically extendedatmosphere models including line-blanketing have been computed with the codecmfgen (hillier &amp; miller 1998) and the analysis of uv stis spectra lead to thefollowing results: 1) the smc-n81 components are young (~ 0-4 myrs) o starswith teff compatible with medium to late subtypes and with luminosities lowerthan average galactic o dwarfs, rendering them possible zams candidates; 2) thewinds are extremely weak: the mass loss rates (~1e-8/1e-9 msol/yr) and themodified wind momenta are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than observed so farfor galactic stars, and are lower than the predictions of the most recenthydrodynamical models. the reasons for such weak winds are investigated withspecial emphasis on the modified wind momenta: 1) there may be a break-down ofthe wind momentum - luminosity relation (wlr) for dwarf stars at low luminosity(log l/lsol &lt; 5.5). however, reasons for such a breakdown remain unknown; 2)the slope of the wlr may be steeper at low metallicity. this is predicted bythe radiation driven wind theory, but the current hydrodynamical simulations donot show any change of the slope at smc metallicity. moreover, there areindications that some galactic objects have wind momenta similar to those ofthe smc stars; 3) decoupling in the atmosphere may lead to multicomponentwinds, but various tests indicate that this is not likely to be the case forthe smc-n81 stars. hence, the origin of the weakness of the wind observed inthese objects remains unknown. we suggest that this weakness may be linked withthe youth of these stars and represents possibly the onset of stellar winds inrecently formed massive stars.

astro-ph;0407194	response to "reanalysis of the spectrum of the z=10 galaxy isaac/vlt  observations of a lensed galaxy at z=10.0" by weatherley et al.  (astro-ph/0407150)	in a recent posting of a submitted paper weatherley et al. re-analyse thespectroscopic data from our observations of abell 1835 ir 1916, a galaxy weclaimed to be at redshift z=10.0 (pello et al., 2004, a&amp;a, 416, l35). theyconclude that the emission line is not detected in their analysis. althoughtheir reduction procedure is accurate and robust, there are several differenceswith ours. the most important one concerns the stacking of the spectral frames.in the case of compact target sources [here: seeing-limited object,~3 pixelsfwhm in the spectral direction, on a 1" (~7 pixels) wide slit] spectral shiftsoccur between individual frames. our reduction corrects for this effect using anearby strong emission line from a compact reference object, as described inpello et al. however, weatherley et al. neglect this effect. this differenceturns out to be crucial. e.g. adopting their combination scheme as closely aspossible but correcting for the spectral drifts we recover the line detection.we conclude that more work is needed to fully understand the origin of ourdifferences. however, their non-detection claim needs further investigation andcannot be uphold based on the arguments presented in their original version ofthe paper. more information is beeing posted onhttp://webast.ast.obs-mip.fr/people/roser/z10_spectroscopy_discussion. withthis material we also invite other researchers to re-analyse independently theisaac spectroscopic observations.

astro-ph;0408582	high spatial resolution mid-infrared spectroscopy of ngc 5253: the  stellar content of the embedded super-star cluster	we present the n-band (8-13 micron) spectrum of the hidden compact radiosuper-star cluster in ngc 5253, c2, obtained with timmi2 on the eso 3.6mtelescope. the spectrum is characterised by a rising continuum due to warmdust, a silicate absorption and a strong [siv] line at 10.5 micron. weakerlines of [ariii] at 9.0 micron and [neii] at 12.8 micron are also present. thecontinuum can be modeled by an optically thick emission from hot dust emissionextinguished by a cold foreground dust screen and a silicate absorption featurewith a_sil = 0.73+/-0.05 mag. we show how the spatial scale of the observationsgreatly determine the mid-ir appearance of ngc 5253 and the importantimplications that this has on the interpretation of line fluxes in terms of theproperties (age, imf, etc.) of the embedded cluster. we have modeled theobserved line fluxes towards c2 using photoionisation models with the mostrecent spectral energy distributions available to describe the integratedproperties of the stellar cluster. strong constraints on the geometry based onhigh spatial resolution observations at different wavelengths -- near-ir (hstand keck), mid-ir (timmi2) and radio (vla) -- allows us to restrain theionisation parameters to values logu &gt;= -0.5 dex. this constraint on u lead totwo possible solutions for the age and upper mass cutoff of c2: 1) a young (&lt; 4myr) cluster with a "non-standard" imf with a low upper mass cutoff mup &lt; 50msun, and 2) a cluster of ~5-6 myr with a standard high upper mass cutoff (mup\~ 100 msun). arguments in favour and against these two scenarios arepresented. the origin of the [oiv] 25.9 micron emission measured by iso and thepossible presence of an intermediate mass black hole inside c2 are alsoaddressed.

astro-ph;0409580	new estimates of the contribution of wolf--rayet stellar winds to the  galactic 26al	we present new yields of 26al from wolf--rayet stellar winds based onrotating stellar models which account well for numerous observed properties ofmassive stars. we study the impacts on the yields of a change of initial mass,metallicity and initial rotation velocity. we also consider the effects of achange of mass loss rates during the wolf--rayet phase. we show that forsurface rotation velocities during the core h--burning phase matching to theobserved ones, the quantity of 26al ejected by a star of a given initial massand metallicity is roughly doubled when the effects of rotation are taken intoaccount. the metallicity dependence of the yield is, on the other hand, verysimilar to that obtained from non--rotating models. we estimate that at leastabout 20% to 50% (e.g. 0.6 --1.4 msun) of the live 26al detected in themilky--way originates from wolf--rayet stellar winds. we show the importance ofa good knowledge of the present metallicity gradient and star formation rate inour galaxy for modeling both the variation of the 26al surface density with thegalactocentric distance and the global contribution of the wolf--rayet stellarwinds to the present galactic mass of 26al.

astro-ph;0410132	very high-redshift lensed galaxies	we review in this paper the main results recently obtained on theidentification and study of very high-z galaxies usinglensing clusters asnatural gravitational telescopes. we present in detail our pilot survey withisaac/vlt, aimed at the detection of z&gt;7 sources. evolutionary synthesis modelsfor extremely metal-poor and popiii starbursts have been used to derive theobservational properties expected for these high-z galaxies, such as expectedmagnitudes and colors, line fluxes for the main emission lines, etc. thesemodels have allowed to define fairly robust selection criteria to find z~7-10galaxies based on broad-band near-ir photometry in combination with thetraditional lyman drop-out technique. the first results issued from ourphotometric and spectroscopic survey are discussed, in particular thepreliminary confirmation rate, and the global properties of our high-zcandidates, including the latest results on the possible z=10.0 candidatea1835-1916. the search efficiency should be significantly improved by thefuture near-ir multi-object ground-based and space facilities. however, stronglensing clusters remain a factor of ~5-10 more efficient than blank fields inthis redshift domain, within the fov of a few arcminutes around the clustercore, for the typical depth required for this survey project.

astro-ph;0503346	a new calibration of stellar parameters of galactic o stars	we present new calibrations of stellar parameters of o stars at solarmetallicity taking non-lte, wind, and line-blanketing effects into account.gravities and absolute visual magnitudes are derived from results of recentspectroscopic analyses. two types of effective temperature scales are derived:one from a compilation based on recent spectroscopic studies of a sample ofmassive stars - the ``observational scale'' - and the other from directinterpolations on a grid of non-lte spherically extended line-blanketed modelscomputed with the code cmfgen (hillier &amp; miller 1998) - the ``theoreticalscale''. these teff scales are then further used together with the grid ofmodels to calibrate other parameters (bolometric correction, luminosity,radius, spectroscopic mass and ionising fluxes) as a function of spectral typeand luminosity class. compared to the earlier calibrations of vacca et al.(1996) the main results are: 1) the effective temperature scales are cooler by2000 to 8000 k, the reduction being the largest for early supergiants; 2)bolometric corrections are lower by 0.1 mag for a given temperature, and arelower by 0.3 - 0.6 mag for a given spectral type; 3) luminosities are reducedby 0.20 to 0.35 dex; 4) lyman ionising fluxes are lower by 0.20 to 0.80 dex. weprovide calibration tables for each luminosity class and for both types of teffscales.

astro-ph;0604461	detection of wolf-rayet stars in host galaxies of gamma-ray bursts  (grbs): are grbs produced by runaway massive stars ejected from high stellar  density regions ?	we have obtained deep spectroscopic observations of several nearby gamma-rayburst (grb) host galaxies revealing for the first time the presence ofwolf-rayet (wr) stars and numerous o stars located in rich and compact clustersor star forming regions. surprisingly, high spatial resolution imaging showsthat the grbs and the associated supernovae did not occur in these regions, butseveral hundreds of parsec away. considering various scenarios for grbprogenitors, we do not find any simple explanation of why they should bepreferentially born in regions with low stellar densities. all the examinedgrbs and associated sne have occurred 400 to 800 pc from very high densitystellar environments including large numbers of wr stars. such distances can betravelled through at velocities of 100 km/s or larger, assuming the travel timeto be the typical life time of wr stars. it leads us to suggest that grbprogenitors may be runaway massive stars ejected from compact massive starclusters. the ejection from such super star clusters may lead to a spin-up ofthese stars, producing the loss of the hydrogen and/or helium envelopes leadingto the origin of the type ibc supernovae associated with grbs. if this scenarioapplies tocd text/sc all grbs, it provides a natural explanation of the verysmall fraction of massive stars that emit a grb at the end of their life. analternative to this scenario could be a binary origin for grbs, but this stillrequires an explanation of why it would preferentially occur in low stellardensity regions.

astro-ph;0605161	high spatial resolution mid-infrared spectroscopy of the starburst  galaxies ngc 3256, iizw40 and henize 2-10	in order to show the importance of high spatial resolution observations ofextra-galactic sources when compared to observations obtained with largerapertures such as iso, we present n-band spectra (8-13 um) of some locations inthree starburst galaxies. in particular, the two galactic nuclei of the spiralgalaxy ngc3256, the compact ir supernebula in the dwarf galaxy iizw40 and thetwo brightest ir knots in the central starburst of the wr galaxy he2-10. thespectra have been obtained with timmi2 on the eso 3.6m telescope. an inventoryof the spectra in terms of atomic fine-structure lines and molecular bands ispresented. we show the great value of these high spatial resolution data atconstraining properties such as the extinction in the mid-ir, metallicity orstellar content (age, imf, etc.). regarding this, we have constrained thestellar content of the ir compact knot in iizw40 by using the mid-irfine-structure lines and setting restrictions on the nebular geometry.considering the pah bands, we have constructed a new mid-/far-ir diagnosticdiagram based on the 11.2 um pah and continuum, accessible to ground-basedobservations. finally, we find a dependence between the presence ornon-presence of pahs and the hardness of the radiation field as measured by the[siv]/[neii] ratio. in particular, sources with pah emission have in general a[siv]/[neii] ratio &lt; 0.35. we investigate possible origins for this relationand conclude that it does not necessarily imply pah destruction, but could alsobe explained by the pah-dust competition for fuv photons.

astro-ph;9509079	combined stellar structure and atmosphere models for massive stars:  wolf-rayet models with spherically outflowing envelopes	we present a simple analytical method to describe the structure of aspherically expanding envelope with strong mass outflow. the structure isconsistently connected to the hydrostatic stellar interior and provides anadequate description of the outer boundary conditions for stellar models withlarge mass loss rates. we apply our treatment to evolutionary models ofwolf-rayet (wr) stars in order to study the possible influence of the stellarwinds on the interior, and to determine more reliable radii of wr stars. theinterior structure and evolution of wr stars is found to be unaffected by theouter layers. for hydrogen rich wr stars (wnl) we find the existence of atemperature domain in the hr-diagram, where a transient concentration of starson their blueward track is predicted in case of a strong backwarming from thewind. for wne and wc/wo stars we also derive subphotospheric radiicorresponding to rosseland optical depths of ~ 10-20. with respect to wind-freestellar models the subphotospheric radii are increased by up to a factor of ~ 4for the most luminous wne or wc stars. these radii and the correspondingeffective temperatures should roughly be comparable with the stellar parametersof non-lte atmosphere models of wr stars. comparisons using the newly derivedradii yield a better agreement with observations. the stellar parametersobtained with the new treatment allow a better assignment of theoreticalspectra to evolutionary tracks of evolved wr stars. this also provides the basefor future studies of the spectral evolution of post-ms massive stars and theirdescendants. we also point out the possible importance of the iron opacity peakfor the acceleration of wr winds in the optically thick part, which may beessential for the understanding of the dynamics of wr winds.

astro-ph;9804155	on some properties of very metal-rich stars	an analysis of some properties of stellar models as a function of metallicityz (and helium content y) is presented, with special attention to those starswith metallicities higher than twice or three times solar. it is shown that thestellar properties as a function of z are mainly determined by the effects ofthe opacities at sub-solar metallicities, and by the effects of the meanmolecular weight and stellar mass loss at higher metallicities. as a result,very metal-rich stars (z &gt;~0.05) exhibit properties that deviate from what isexpected from the known characteristics at lower metallicities.  in particular, they are more luminous and hotter than those at z &lt;~ 0.05 dueto the effect of the mean molecular weight. they have main sequence lifetimesmuch shorter (60 % shorter at z=0.1 than at z=0.02) than those at solarmetallicity due to their lower initial hydrogen content. finally, the high massloss rates at high metallicities affect significantly the population synthesisof massive stars in very metal-rich regions. an analysis of expected wolf-rayetand supernovae populations in such conditions is briefly presented.
