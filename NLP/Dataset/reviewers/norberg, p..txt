0910.5120	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the input catalogue and star-galaxy  separation	we describe the spectroscopic target selection for the galaxy and massassembly (gama) survey. the input catalogue is drawn from the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) and ukirt infrared deep sky survey (ukidss). the aim is tomeasure redshifts for galaxies in three 4x12 degree regions at 9h, 12h and14.5h, on the celestial equator, with magnitude selections r &lt; 19.4, z &lt; 18.2and k(ab) &lt; 17.6 over all three regions, and r &lt; 19.8 in the 12-h region. thetarget density is 1080 per sq. deg. in the 12-h region and 720 per sq. deg. inthe other regions. the average gama target density and area are compared withcompleted and ongoing galaxy redshift surveys. the gama survey implements ahighly complete star-galaxy separation that jointly uses an intensity-profileseparator (delta(sg) = r-band psf mag - model mag) as per the sdss) and acolour separator. the colour separator is defined as delta(sg,jk) = j - k -f(g-i), where f(g-i) is a quadratic fit to the j-k colour of the stellar locusover the range 0.3 &lt; g-i &lt; 2.3. all galaxy populations investigated are wellseparated with delta(sg,jk) &gt; 0.2. from two years out of a three-year aaomegaprogram on the anglo-australian telescope, we have obtained 79599 unique galaxyredshifts. previously known redshifts in the gama region bring the total up to98497. the median galaxy redshift is 0.2 with 99% at z &lt; 0.5. we present someof the global statistical properties of the survey, including k-band galaxycounts, colour-redshift relations and preliminary n(z).

1005.2412	herschel-atlas: dust temperature and redshift distribution of spire and  pacs detected sources using submillimetre colours	we present colour-colour diagrams of detected sources in the herschel-atlasscience demonstration field from 100 to 500 microns using both pacs and spire.we fit isothermal modified black bodies to the spectral energy distribution(sed) to extract the dust temperature of sources with counterparts in galaxyand mass assembly (gama) or sdss surveys with either a spectroscopic or aphotometric redshift. for a subsample of 330 sources detected in at least threefir bands with a significance greater than 3 $\sigma$, we find an average dusttemperature of $(28 \pm 8)$k. for sources with no known redshift, we populatethe colour-colour diagram with a large number of seds generated with a broadrange of dust temperatures and emissivity parameters, and compare to colours ofobserved sources to establish the redshift distribution of this sample. foranother subsample of 1686 sources with fluxes above 35 mjy at 350 microns anddetected at 250 and 500 microns with a significance greater than 3$\sigma$, wefind an average redshift of $2.2 \pm 0.6$.

1007.5260	herschel-atlas: counterparts from the uv--nir in the science  demonstration phase catalogue	we present a technique to identify optical counterparts of 250 um-selectedsources from the herschel-atlas survey. of the 6621 250 um &gt; 32 mjy sources inour science demonstration catalogue we find that ~60 percent have counterpartsbrighter than r=22.4 mag in the sloan digital sky survey. applying a likelihoodratio technique we are able to identify 2423 of the counterparts with areliability r &gt; 0.8. this is approximately 37 percent of the full 250 microncatalogue. we have estimated photometric redshifts for each of these 2423reliable counterparts, while 1099 also have spectroscopic redshifts collatedfrom several different sources, including the gama survey. we estimate thecompleteness of identifying counterparts as a function of redshift, and presentevidence that 250 um-selected herschel-atlas galaxies have a bimodal redshiftdistribution. those with reliable optical identifications have a redshiftdistribution peaking at z ~ 0.25 +/- 0.05, while sub-mm colours suggest that asignificant fraction with no counterpart above the r-band limit have z &gt; 1. wealso suggest a method for selecting populations of strongly-lensed highredshift galaxies. our identifications are matched to uv--nir photometry fromthe gama survey, and these data are available as part of the herschel-atlaspublic data release.

1009.0614	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): survey diagnostics and core data  release	the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey has been operating since february2008 on the 3.9-m anglo-australian telescope using the aaomega fibre-fedspectrograph facility to acquire spectra with a resolution of r~1300 for120,862 sdss selected galaxies. the target catalogue constitutes threecontiguous equatorial regions centred at 9h (g09), 12h (g12) and 14.5h (g15)each of 12 x 4 sq.deg to limiting fluxes of r &lt; 19.4, r &lt; 19.8, and r &lt; 19.4mag respectively (and additional limits at other wavelengths). spectra andreliable redshifts have been acquired for over 98 per cent of the galaxieswithin these limits. here we present the survey footprint, progression, datareduction, redshifting, re-redshifting, an assessment of data quality after 3years, additional image analysis products (including ugrizyjhk photometry,sersic profiles and photometric redshifts), observing mask, and construction ofour core survey catalogue (gamacore). from this we create three science readycatalogues: gamacoredr1 for public release, which includes data acquired duringyear 1 of operations within specified magnitude limits (february 2008 to april2008); gamacoremainsurvey containing all data above our survey limits for useby the gama team and collaborators; and gamacoreatlassv containing year 1, 2and 3 data matched to herschel-atlas science demonstration data. thesecatalogues along with the associated spectra, stamps and profiles can beaccessed via the gama website: http://www.gama-survey.org/

1009.0616	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): dust obscuration in galaxies and their  recent star formation histories	we present self-consistent star formation rates derived through pan-spectralanalysis of galaxies drawn from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey. wedetermine the most appropriate form of dust obscuration correction viaapplication of a range of extinction laws drawn from the literature as appliedto halpha, [o{ii}] and uv luminosities. these corrections are applied to asample of 31,508 galaxies from the gama survey at z &lt; 0.35. we consider severaldifferent obscuration curves, including those of milky way, calzetti (2001) andfischera and dopita (2005) curves and their effects on the observedluminosities. at the core of this technique is the observed balmer decrement,and we provide a prescription to apply optimal obscuration corrections usingthe balmer decrement. we carry out an analysis of the star formation history(sfh) using stellar population synthesis tools to investigate the evolutionaryhistory of our sample of galaxies as well as to understand the effects ofvariation in the initial mass function (imf) and the effects this has on theevolutionary history of galaxies. we find that the fischera and dopita (2005)obscuration curve with an r_{v} value of 4.5 gives the best agreement betweenthe different sfr indicators. the 2200a feature needed to be removed from thiscurve to obtain complete consistency between all sfr indicators suggesting thatthis feature may not be common in the average integrated attenuation of galaxyemission. we also find that the uv dust obscuration is strongly dependent onthe sfr.

1009.5390	herschel-atlas: the far-infrared--radio correlation at z&lt;0.5	we use data from the herschel-atlas to investigate the evolution of thefar-infrared--radio correlation over the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;0.5. using thetotal far-infrared luminosity of all &gt;5sigma sources in the herschel-atlasscience demonstration field and cross-matching these data with radio data fromthe faint images of the radio sky at twenty-centimetres (first) survey and thenrao vla northern sky survey (nvss), we obtain 104 radio counterparts to theherschel sources. with these data we find no evidence for evolution in thefar-infrared--radio correlation over the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;0.5, where themedian value for the ratio between far-infrared and radio luminosity, $q_{\rmir}$, over this range is $q_{\rm ir} = 2.40\pm 0.12$ (and a mean of $q_{\rmir}=2.52 \pm 0.03$ accounting for the lower limits), consistent with both thelocal value determined from {\em iras} and values derived from surveystargeting the high-redshift universe. by comparing the radio fluxes of oursample measured from both first and nvss we show that previous resultssuggesting an increase in the value of $q_{\rm ir}$ from high to low redshiftmay be the result of resolving out extended emission of the low-redshiftsources with relatively high-resolution interferometric data, although agncontamination could still play a significant role.  we also find tentative evidence that the longer wavelength, cooler dust isheated by an evolved stellar population which does not trace the star-formationrate as closely as the shorter wavelength $\ltsim 250~\mu$m emission or theradio emission, supporting suggestions based on detailed models of individualgalaxies.

1012.3771	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): galaxies at the faint end of the halpha  luminosity function	we present an analysis of the properties of the lowest halpha-luminositygalaxies (l_halpha&lt;4x10^32 w; sfr&lt;0.02 msun/yr) in the galaxy and mass assembly(gama) survey. these galaxies make up the the rise above a schechter functionin the number density of systems seen at the faint end of the halpha luminosityfunction. above our flux limit we find that these galaxies are principallycomposed of intrinsically low stellar mass systems (median stellar mass=2.5x10^8 msun) with only 5/90 having stellar masses m&gt;10^10 msun. the low sfrsystems are found to exist predominantly in the lowest density environments(median density ~0.02 galaxy mpc^-2 with none in environments more dense than~1.5 galaxy mpc^-2). their current specific star formation rates (ssfr; -8.5 &lt;log(ssfr[yr^-1])&lt;-12.) are consistent with their having had a variety of starformation histories. the low density environments of these galaxiesdemonstrates that such low-mass, star-forming systems can only remain aslow-mass and forming stars if they reside sufficiently far from other galaxiesto avoid being accreted, dispersed through tidal effects or having their gasreservoirs rendered ineffective through external processes.

0704.2545	the angular correlations of galaxies in the cosmos field	we present measurements of the two-point galaxy angular correlation functionw(\theta) in the cosmos field. independent determinations of w(\theta) as afunction of magnitude limit are presented for both the hst acs catalog and alsofor the ground-based data from subaru and the cfht. despite havingsignificantly different masks, these three determinations agree well. at brightmagnitudes (iab&lt;22), our data generally match very well with existingmeasurements and with mock catalogs based on semi-analytic galaxy formationcalculations of kitzbichler and white from the millennium simulation. theexception is that our result is at the upper end of the expected cosmicvariance scatter for \theta &gt; 10 arcmin, which we attribute to a particularlyrich structure known to exist at z~0.8. for fainter samples, however, the levelof clustering is somewhat higher than reported by some previous studies: in allthree catalogues we find w(\theta=1')~0.014 at a median iab magnitude of 24. atthese very faintest magnitudes, our measurements agree well with the latestdeterminations from the canada-france legacy survey. this level of clusteringis approximately double what is predicted by the semi-analytic catalogs (at allangles). the semi-analytic results allow an estimate of cosmic variance, whichis too small to account for the discrepancy. we therefore conclude that themean amplitude of clustering at this level is higher than previously estimated.

1103.3080	gama/h-atlas: the ultraviolet spectral slope and obscuration in galaxies	we use multiwavelength data from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) andherschel atlas (h-atlas) surveys to compare the relationship between variousdust obscuration measures in galaxies. we explore the connections between theultraviolet (uv) spectral slope, $\beta$, the balmer decrement, and the farinfrared (ir) to $150\,$nm far ultraviolet (fuv) luminosity ratio. we exploretrends with galaxy mass, star formation rate (sfr) and redshift in order toidentify possible systematics in these various measures. we reiterate thefinding of other authors that there is a large scatter between the balmerdecrement and the $\beta$ parameter, and that $\beta$ may be poorly constrainedwhen derived from only two broad passbands in the uv. we also emphasise thatfuv derived sfrs, corrected for dust obscuration using $\beta$, will beoverestimated unless a modified relation between $\beta$ and the attenuationfactor is used. even in the optimum case, the resulting sfrs have a significantscatter, well over an order of magnitude. while there is a stronger correlationbetween the ir to fuv luminosity ratio and $\beta$ parameter than with thebalmer decrement, neither of these correlations are particularly tight, anddust corrections based on $\beta$ for high redshift galaxy sfrs must be treatedwith caution. we conclude with a description of the extent to which thedifferent obscuration measures are consistent with each other as well as theeffects of including other galactic properties on these correlations.

1104.2379	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the star formation rate dependence of  the stellar initial mass function	the stellar initial mass function (imf) describes the distribution in stellarmasses produced from a burst of star formation. for more than fifty years, theimplicit assumption underpinning most areas of research involving the imf hasbeen that it is universal, regardless of time and environment. we measure thehigh-mass imf slope for a sample of low-to-moderate redshift galaxies from thegalaxy and mass assembly survey. the large range in luminosities and galaxymasses of the sample permits the exploration of underlying imf dependencies. astrong imf-star formation rate dependency is discovered, which shows thathighly star forming galaxies form proportionally more massive stars (they haveimfs with flatter power-law slopes) than galaxies with low star formationrates. this has a significant impact on a wide variety of galaxy evolutionstudies, all of which rely on assumptions about the slope of the imf. ourresult is supported by, and provides an explanation for, the results ofnumerous recent explorations suggesting a variation of or evolution in the imf.

1106.1994	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the gama galaxy group catalogue (g3cv1)	using the complete gama-i survey covering ~142 sq. deg. to r=19.4, of which~47 sq. deg. is to r=19.8, we create the gama-i galaxy group catalogue (g3cv1),generated using a friends-of-friends (fof) based grouping algorithm. ouralgorithm has been tested extensively on one family of mock gama lightcones,constructed from lambda-cdm n-body simulations populated with semi-analyticgalaxies. recovered group properties are robust to the effects of interlopersand are median unbiased in the most important respects. g3cv1 contains 14,388galaxy groups (with multiplicity &gt;= 2$), including 44,186 galaxies out of apossible 110,192 galaxies, implying ~40% of all galaxies are assigned to agroup. the similarities of the mock group catalogues and g3cv1 are multiple:global characteristics are in general well recovered. however, we do find anoticeable deficit in the number of high multiplicity groups in gama comparedto the mocks. additionally, despite exceptionally good local spatialcompleteness, g3cv1 contains significantly fewer compact groups with 5 or moremembers, this effect becoming most evident for high multiplicity systems. thesetwo differences are most likely due to limitations in the physics included ofthe current gama lightcone mock. further studies using a variety of galaxyformation models are required to confirm their exact origin.

1106.6195	the environment and characteristics of low redshift galaxies detected by  the herschel-atlas	we investigate the ultraviolet and optical properties and environment of lowredshift galaxies detected in the herschel astrophysical terahertz large areasurvey (h-atlas) science demonstration data. we use the sloan digital skysurvey seventh release and the galaxy and mass assembly database to selectgalaxies with r_petro &lt; 19.0 mag in the redshift range 0.02 &lt; z &lt; 0.2 and lookfor their submillimeter counterparts in h-atlas. our results show that at lowredshift, h-atlas detects mainly blue/star-forming galaxies with a minorcontribution from red systems which are highly obscured by dust. in addition wefind that the colour of a galaxy rather than the local density of itsenvironment determines whether it is detectable by h-atlas. the average dusttemperature of galaxies that are simultaneously detected by both pacs and spireis 25k \pm 4k, independent of environment. this analysis provides a glimpse ofthe potential of the h-atlas data to investigate the submillimeter propertiesof galaxies in the local universe.

1107.0141	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the red fraction and radial  distribution of satellite galaxies	we investigate the properties of satellite galaxies that surround isolatedhosts within the redshift range 0.01 &lt; z &lt; 0.15, using data taken as part ofthe galaxy and mass assembly survey. making use of isolation and satellitecriteria that take into account stellar mass estimates, we find 3514 isolatedgalaxies of which 1426 host a total of 2998 satellites. separating the red andblue populations of satellites and hosts, using colour-mass diagrams, weinvestigate the radial distribution of satellite galaxies and determine how thered fraction of satellites varies as a function of satellite mass, host massand the projected distance from their host. comparing the red fraction ofsatellites to a control sample of small neighbours at greater projected radii,we show that the increase in red fraction is primarily a function of host mass.the satellite red fraction is about 0.2 higher than the control sample forhosts with 11.0 &lt; log m_* &lt; 11.5, while the red fractions show no differencefor hosts with 10.0 &lt; log m_* &lt; 10.5. for the satellites of more massive hoststhe red fraction also increases as a function of decreasing projected distance.our results suggest that the likely main mechanism for the quenching of starformation in satellites hosted by isolated galaxies is strangulation.

1109.6274	h-atlas/gama: dusty early-type galaxies and passive spirals	we present the dust properties and star-formation histories of localsubmillimetre-selected galaxies in herschel-atlas, classified by opticalmorphology. the early-type galaxies (etgs) that are detected contain as muchdust as typical spirals, and form a unique sample that has been blindlyselected at submillimetre wavelengths.  comparing h-atlas galaxies to a control sample of optically selectedgalaxies, we find 5.5% of luminous etgs are detected in h-atlas. the h-atlasetgs contain a significant mass of cold dust: the mean dust mass is 5.5x10^7msun, with individual galaxies ranging from 9x10^5-4x10^8 msun. this iscomparable to that of spirals in our sample, and is an order of magnitude moredust than that found for the control etgs, which have a median dust massinferred from stacking of (0.8-4.0)x10^6 msun. the etgs detected in h-atlashave bluer nuv-r colours, higher specific star-formation rates and youngerstellar populations than etgs which are optically selected, and may betransitioning from the blue cloud to the red sequence. we also find thath-atlas and control etgs inhabit similar low-density environments. we concludethat the dust in h-atlas and control etgs cannot be solely from stellarsources, and a large contribution from dust formed in the ism or externalsources is required. alternatively, dust destruction may not be as efficient aspredicted.  we also explore the properties of the most passive spiral galaxies in oursample with ssfr&lt;10^-11/yr. we find these passive spirals have lowerdust-to-stellar mass ratios, higher stellar masses and older stellar populationages than normal spirals. the passive spirals inhabit low density environmentssimilar to those of the normal spiral galaxies in our sample. this shows thatthe processes which turn spirals passive do not occur solely in theintermediate density environments of group and cluster outskirts.

1111.0166	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): ugriz galaxy luminosity functions	galaxy and mass assembly (gama) is a project to study galaxy formation andevolution, combining imaging data from ultraviolet to radio with spectroscopicdata from the aaomega spectrograph on the anglo-australian telescope. usingdata from phase 1 of gama, taken over three observing seasons, and correctingfor various minor sources of incompleteness, we calculate galaxy luminosityfunctions (lfs) and their evolution in the ugriz passbands.  at low redshift, z &lt; 0.1, we find that blue galaxies, defined according to amagnitude-dependent but non-evolving colour cut, are reasonably well fit over arange of more than ten magnitudes by simple schechter functions in all bands.red galaxies, and the combined blue-plus-red sample, require double power-lawschechter functions to fit a dip in their lf faintward of the characteristicmagnitude m* before a steepening faint end. this upturn is at least partly dueto dust-reddened disk galaxies.  we measure evolution of the galaxy lf over the redshift range 0.002 &lt; z &lt; 0.5using both a parametric fit and by measuring binned lfs in redshift slices. thecharacteristic luminosity l* is found to increase with redshift in all bands,with red galaxies showing stronger luminosity evolution than blue galaxies. thecomoving number density of blue galaxies increases with redshift, while that ofred galaxies decreases, consistent with prevailing movement from blue cloud tored sequence. as well as being more numerous at higher redshift, blue galaxiesalso dominate the overall luminosity density beyond redshifts z = 0.2. at lowerredshifts, the luminosity density is dominated by red galaxies in the rizbands, by blue galaxies in u and g.

1111.5707	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the galaxy stellar mass function at z &lt;  0.06	we determine the low-redshift field galaxy stellar mass function (gsmf) usingan area of 143 deg^2 from the first three years of the galaxy and mass assembly(gama) survey. the magnitude limits of this redshift survey are r &lt; 19.4 magover two thirds and 19.8 mag over one third of the area. the gsmf is determinedfrom a sample of 5210 galaxies using a density-corrected maximum volume method.this efficiently overcomes the issue of fluctuations in the number densityversus redshift. with h_0 = 70, the gsmf is well described between 10^8 and10^11.5 msun using a double schechter function with mass^* = 10^10.66 msun,phi_1^* = 3.96 x 10^-3 mpc^-3, alpha_1 = -0.35, phi_2^* = 0.79 x 10^-3 mpc^-3and alpha_2 = -1.47. this result is more robust to uncertainties in theflow-model corrected redshifts than from the shallower sloan digital sky surveymain sample (r &lt; 17.8 mag). the upturn in the gsmf is also seen directly in thei-band and k-band galaxy luminosity functions. accurately measuring the gsmfbelow 10^8 msun is possible within the gama survey volume but as expectedrequires deeper imaging data to address the contribution from lowsurface-brightness galaxies.

1201.1916	herschel-atlas/gama: a census of dust in optically selected galaxies  from stacking at submillimetre wavelengths	we use the herschel-atlas survey to conduct the first large-scale statisticalstudy of the submm properties of optically selected galaxies. using ~80,000r-band selected galaxies from 126 deg^2 of the gama survey, we stack into submmimaging at 250, 350 and 500{\mu}m to gain unprecedented statistics on the dustemission from galaxies at z &lt; 0.35. we find that low redshift galaxies accountfor 5% of the cosmic 250{\mu}m background (4% at 350{\mu}m; 3% at 500{\mu}m),of which approximately 60% comes from 'blue' and 20% from 'red' galaxies(rest-frame g - r). we compare the dust properties of different galaxypopulations by dividing the sample into bins of optical luminosity, stellarmass, colour and redshift. in blue galaxies we find that dust temperature andluminosity correlate strongly with stellar mass at a fixed redshift, but redgalaxies do not follow these correlations and overall have lower luminositiesand temperatures. we make reasonable assumptions to account for thecontaminating flux from lensing by red sequence galaxies and conclude thatgalaxies with different optical colours have fundamentally different dustemission properties. results indicate that while blue galaxies are moreluminous than red galaxies due to higher temperatures, the dust masses of thetwo samples are relatively similar. dust mass is shown to correlate withstellar mass, although the dust/stellar mass ratio is much higher for lowstellar mass galaxies, consistent with the lowest mass galaxies having thehighest specific star formation rates. we stack the 250{\mu}m/nuv luminosityratio, finding results consistent with greater obscuration of star formation atlower stellar mass and higher redshift. submm luminosities and dust masses ofall galaxies are shown to evolve strongly with redshift, indicating a fall inthe amount of obscured star formation in ordinary galaxies over the last fourbillion years.

1205.3368	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): galaxy environments and star formation  rate variations	we present a detailed investigation into the effects of galaxy environment ontheir star formation rates (sfr) using galaxies observed in the galaxy and massassembly survey (gama). we use three independent volume-limited samples ofgalaxies within z &lt; 0.2 and mr &lt; -17.8. we investigate the known sfr-densityrelationship and explore in detail the dependence of sfr on stellar mass anddensity. we show that the sfr-density trend is only visible when we include thepassive galaxy population along with the star-forming population. thissfr-density relation is absent when we consider only the star-formingpopulation of galaxies, consistent with previous work. while there is a strongdependence of the ewh?a on density we find, as in previous studies, that thesetrends are largely due to the passive galaxy population and this relationshipis absent when considering a "star-forming" sample of galaxies. we find thatstellar mass has the strongest influence on sfr and ewh?a with the environmenthaving no significant effect on the star-formation properties of the starforming population. we also show that the sfr-density relationship is absentfor both early and late-type star-forming galaxies. we conclude that thestellar mass has the largest impact on the current sfr of a galaxy, and anyenvironmental effect is not detectable. the observation that the trends withdensity are due to the changing morphology fraction with density implies thatthe timescales must be very short for any quenching of the sfr in infallinggalaxies. alternatively galaxies may in fact undergo predominantly in-situevolution where the infall and quenching of galaxies from the field into denseenvironments is not the dominant evolutionary mode.

1206.6108	the zurich environmental study (zens) of galaxies in groups along the  cosmic web. ii. galaxy structural measurements and the concentration of  morphologically classified satellites in diverse environments	we present structural measurements for the galaxies in the 0.05&lt;z&lt;0.0585groups of the zurich environmental study, aimed at establishing how galaxyproperties depend on four environmental parameters: group halo mass m_group,group-centric distance r/r_200, ranking into central or satellite, andlarge-scale structure density delta_lss. global galaxy structure is quantifiedboth parametrically and non-parametrically. we correct all these measurementsfor observational biases due to psf blurring and surface brightness effects asa function of galaxy size, magnitude, steepness of light profile andellipticity. structural parameters are derived also for bulges, disks and bars.we use the galaxy bulge-to-total ratios (b/t), together with the calibratednon-parametric structural estimators, to implement a quantitative morphologicalclassification that maximizes purity in the resulting morphological samples. weinvestigate how the concentration c of satellite galaxies depends on galaxymass for each hubble type, and on m_group, r/r_200 and delta_lss. at galaxymasses m&gt;10^10 m_sun, the concentration of disk satellites increases withincreasing stellar mass, separately within each morphological bin of b/t. theknown increase in concentration with stellar mass for disk satellites is thusdue, at least in part, to an increase in galaxy central stellar density atconstant b/t. the correlation between concentration and galaxy stellar massbecomes progressively steeper for later morphological types. the concentrationof disk satellites shows a barely significant dependence on delta_lss orr/r_200. the strongest environmental effect is found with group mass form&gt;10^10 m_sun disk-dominated satellites, which are ~10% more concentrated inhigh mass groups than in lower mass groups.

1206.6496	the zurich environmental study of galaxies in groups along the cosmic  web. iii. galaxy photometric measurements and the spatially-resolved color  properties of early- and late-type satellites in diverse environments	we present photometric measurements for the galaxies - and when possibletheir bulges and disks - in the 0.05&lt;z&lt;0.0585 groups of the zurichenvironmental study (zens); these measurements include (b-i) colors, colorgradients and maps, color dispersions, as well as stellar masses andstar-formation rates. the zens galaxies are classified into quenched,moderately star-forming, and strongly star-forming using a combination ofspectral features and fuv-to-optical colors; this approach optimallydistinguishes quenched systems from dust-reddened star-forming galaxies. thelatter contribute up to 50% to the (b-i) "red sequence" at ~10^10msun. at fixedmorphological or spectral type, we find that galaxy stellar masses are largelyindependent of environment, and especially of halo mass. as a first utilizationof our photometric database, we study, at fixed stellar mass and hubble type,how (b-i) colors, color gradients and color dispersion of disk satellitesdepend on group mass (m_group), group-centric distance (r/r_200) andlarge-scale structure overdensity. the strongest environmental trend is foundfor disk-dominated satellites with m_group and r/r_200. at m&lt;10^10 msun,disk-dominated satellites are redder in the inner regions of the groups than inthe outer parts. at m&gt;10^10 msun, these satellites have shallower colorgradients in higher mass groups and in the cores of groups compared with lowermass groups and the outskirts of groups. stellar population analyses andsemi-analytic models suggest that disk-dominated satellites undergo quenchingof star formation in their outer disks, on timescales ~2 gyr, as theyprogressively move inside the group potential.

1208.4293	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): in search of milky-way magellanic cloud  analogues	analysing all galaxy and mass assembly (gama) galaxies within a factor two(+/- 0.3 dex) of the stellar mass of the milky way (mw), there is a 11.9%chance that one of these galaxies will have a close companion (within aprojected separation of 70 kpc and radial separation of 400 km/s) that is atleast as massive as the large magellanic cloud (lmc). two close companions atleast as massive as the small magellanic cloud (smc) are rare at the 3.4%level. two full analogues to the mw- lmc-smc system were found in gama (allgalaxies late-type and star forming), suggesting such a combination of closetogether, late-type, star-forming galaxies is rare: only 0.4% of mw massgalaxies (in the range where we could observe both the lmc and smc) have such asystem. in summary, the mw-lmc-smc system is a 2.7? event (when recast intogaussian statistics).  using cross-correlation comparisons we find that there is a preference forsmc- lmc binary pair analogues to be located within 2 mpc of a range ofdifferent lumi- nosity groups. there is a particular preference is for suchbinaries to be located near lg luminosity systems. when these groups aresubdivided into small magnitude gap and large magnitude gap subsets, thebinaries prefer to be spatially associated with the small magnitude gapsystems. these systems will be dynamically less evolved, but still offer thesame amount of gravitational dark matter. this suggests that binaries such asthe smc-lmc might be transient systems, usually destroyed during vigorousmerger events. details of a particularly striking analogue to the mw-smc-lmcand m31 complex are included.

1208.5780	moons: a multi-object optical and near-infrared spectrograph for the vlt	moons is a new conceptual design for a multi-object optical and near-infraredspectrograph for the very large telescope (vlt), selected by eso for a phase astudy. the baseline design consists of 1000 fibers deployable over a field ofview of 500 square arcmin, the largest patrol field offered by the nasmythfocus at the vlt. the total wavelength coverage is 0.8um-1.8um and tworesolution modes: medium resolution and high resolution. in the mediumresolution mode (r=4,000-6,000) the entire wavelength range 0.8um-1.8um isobserved simultaneously, while the high resolution mode covers simultaneouslythree selected spectral regions: one around the caii triplet (at r=8,000) tomeasure radial velocities, and two regions at r=20,000 one in the j-band andone in the h-band, for detailed measurements of chemical abundances. the graspof the 8.2m very large telescope (vlt) combined with the large multiplex andwavelength coverage of moons - extending into the near-ir - will provide theobservational power necessary to study galaxy formation and evolution over theentire history of the universe, from our milky way, through the redshift desertand up to the epoch of re-ionization at z&gt;8-9. at the same time, the highspectral resolution mode will allow astronomers to study chemical abundances ofstars in our galaxy, in particular in the highly obscured regions of the bulge,and provide the necessary follow-up of the gaia mission. such characteristicsand versatility make moons the long-awaited workhorse near-ir mos for the vlt,which will perfectly complement optical spectroscopy performed by flames andvimos.

1209.0259	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the 0.013 &lt; z &lt; 0.1 cosmic spectral  energy distribution from 0.1 micron to 1mm	we use the gama i dataset combined with galex, sdss and ukidss imaging toconstruct the low-redshift (z&lt;0.1) galaxy luminosity functions in fuv, nuv,ugriz, and yjhk bands from within a single well constrained volume of 3.4 x10^5 (mpc/h)^{3}. the derived luminosity distributions are normalised to thesdss dr7 main survey to reduce the estimated cosmic variance to the 5 per centlevel. the data are used to construct the cosmic spectral energy distribution(csed) from 0.1 to 2.1 \mum free from any wavelength dependent cosmic variancefor both the elliptical and non-elliptical populations. the two populationsexhibit dramatically different cseds as expected for a predominantly old andyoung population respectively. using the driver et al. (2008) prescription forthe azimuthally averaged photon escape fraction, the non-ellipticals arecorrected for the impact of dust attenuation and the combined csed constructed.the final results show that the universe is currently generating (1.8 +/- 0.3)x 10^{35} h w mpc^{-3} of which (1.2 +/- 0.1) x 10^{35} h w mpc^{-3} isdirectly released into the inter-galactic medium and (0.6 +/- 0.1) x 10^{35} hw mpc^{-3} is reprocessed and reradiated by dust in the far-ir. using the gamadata and our dust model we predict the mid and far-ir emission which agreesremarkably well with available data. we therefore provide a robust descriptionof the pre- and post dust attenuated energy output of the nearby universe from0.1micron to 0.6mm. the largest uncertainty in this measurement lies in the midand far-ir bands stemming from the dust attenuation correction and itscurrently poorly constrained dependence on environment, stellar mass, andmorphology.

1209.1636	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the mass-metallicity relationship	context: the mass-metallicity relationship (mmr) of star-forming galaxies iswell-established, however there is still some disagreement with respect to itsexact shape and its possible dependence on other observables. aims: we measurethe mmr in the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey. we compare our measuredmmr to that measured in the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and study thedependence of the mmr on various selection criteria to identify potentialcauses for disparities seen in the literature. methods: we use strong emissionline ratio diagnostics to derive oxygen abundances. we then apply a range ofselection criteria for the minimum signal-to-noise in various emission lines,as well as the apparent and absolute magnitude to study variations in theinferred mmr. results: the shape and position of the mmr can differsignificantly depending on the metallicity calibration and selection used.after selecting a robust metallicity calibration amongst those tested, we findthat the mass-metallicity relation for redshifts 0.061&lt; z&lt;0.35 in gama is inreasonable agreement with that found in the sdss despite the difference in theluminosity range probed. conclusions: in view of the significant variations ofthe mmr brought about by reasonable changes in the sample selection criteriaand method, we recommend that care be taken when comparing the mmr fromdifferent surveys and studies directly. we also conclude that there could be amodest level of evolution over 0.06&lt;z&lt;0.35 within the gama sample.

1301.7127	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): spectroscopic analysis	the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey is a multiwavelength photometricand spectroscopic survey, using the aaomega spectrograph on theanglo-australian telescope to obtain spectra for up to ~300000 galaxies over280 square degrees, to a limiting magnitude of r_pet &lt; 19.8 mag. the targetgalaxies are distributed over 0&lt;z&lt;0.5 with a median redshift of z~0.2, althoughthe redshift distribution includes a small number of systems, primarilyquasars, at higher redshifts, up to and beyond z=1. the redshift accuracyranges from sigma_v~50km/s to sigma_v~100km/s depending on the signal-to-noiseof the spectrum. here we describe the gama spectroscopic reduction and analysispipeline. we present the steps involved in taking the raw two-dimensionalspectroscopic images through to flux-calibrated one-dimensional spectra. theresulting gama spectra cover an observed wavelength range of 3750&lt;lambda&lt;8850 aat a resolution of r~1300. the final flux calibration is typically accurate to10-20%, although the reliability is worse at the extreme wavelength ends, andpoorer in the blue than the red. we present details of the measurement ofemission and absorption features in the gama spectra. these measurements arecharacterised through a variety of quality control analyses detailing therobustness and reliability of the measurements. we illustrate the quality ofthe measurements with a brief exploration of elementary emission lineproperties of the galaxies in the gama sample. we demonstrate the luminositydependence of the balmer decrement, consistent with previously publishedresults, and explore further how balmer decrement varies with galaxy mass andredshift. we also investigate the mass and redshift dependencies of the[nii]/halpha vs [oiii]/hbeta spectral diagnostic diagram, commonly used todiscriminate between star forming and nuclear activity in galaxies.

1301.7129	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the life and times of l* galaxies	in this work we investigate in detail the effects local environment (groupsand pairs) has on galaxies with stellar mass similar to the milky-way (l*galaxies). a volume limited sample of 6,150 galaxies is classified to determineemission features, morphological type and presence of a disk. this sampleallows for characteristics of galaxies to be isolated (e.g. stellar mass andgroup halo mass), and their codependencies determined.  we observe that galaxy-galaxy interactions play the most important role inshaping the evolution within a group halo, the main role of halo mass is ingathering the galaxies together to encourage such interactions. dominant pairgalaxies find their overall star formation enhanced when the pair's mass ratiois close to 1, otherwise we observe the same galaxies as we would in anunpaired system. the minor galaxy in a pair is greatly affected by itscompanion galaxy, and whilst the star forming fraction is always suppressedrelative to equivalent stellar mass unpaired galaxies, it becomes lower stillwhen the mass ratio of a pair system increases.  we find that, in general, the close galaxy-galaxy interaction rate drops as afunction of halo mass for a given amount of stellar mass. we find evidence of alocal peak of interactions for milky-way stellar mass galaxies in milky-wayhalo mass groups. low mass halos, and in particular local group mass halos, arean important environment for understanding the typical evolutionary path of aunit of stellar mass.  we find compelling evidence for galaxy conformity in both groups and pairs,where morphological type conformity is dominant in groups, and emission classconformity is dominant in pairs. this suggests that group scale conformity isthe result of many galaxy encounters over an extended period of time, whilstpair conformity is a fairly instantaneous response to a transitory interaction.

1302.1379	gama/h-atlas: the dust opacity - stellar mass surface density relation  for spiral galaxies	we report the discovery of a well-defined correlation between b-band face-oncentral optical depth due to dust, \tau^f_b, and the stellar mass surfacedensity, \mu_{*}, of nearby (z &lt; 0.13) spiral galaxies: log(\tau^f_b) =1.12(+-0.11)log(\mu_{*}/m_sol kpc^2)-8.6(+-0.8). this relation was derived froma sample of spiral galaxies taken from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)survey and detected in the fir/submm in the herschel-atlas survey. using aquantitative analysis of the nuv attenuation-inclination relation for completesamples of gama spirals categorized according to \mu_{*} we demonstrate thatthis correlation can be used to statistically correct for dust attenuationpurely on the basis of optical photometry and s'ersic-profile morphologicalfits. considered together with previously established empirical relationshipsbetween stellar mass, metallicity and gas mass, the near linearity and highconstant of proportionality of the \tau^f_b-\mu_{*} relation disfavors astellar origin for the bulk of refractory grains in spiral galaxies, insteadbeing consistent with the existence of a ubiquitous and very rapid mechanismfor the growth of dust in the ism. we use the \tau^f_b-\mu_{*} relation inconjunction with the radiation transfer model for spiral galaxies of popescu &amp;tuffs (2011) to derive intrinsic scaling relations between specific starformation rate (ssfr), stellar mass, and \mu_{*}, in which the attenuation ofthe uv light used to measure the sfr is corrected on an object-to-object basis.a marked reduction in scatter in these relations is achieved which isdemonstrably due to correction of both the inclination-dependent and face-oncomponents of attenuation. our results are consistent with a picture of spiralgalaxies in which most of the submm emission originates from grains residing intranslucent structures, exposed to uv in the diffuse interstellar radiationfield.

1305.5308	galaxy and mass assembly: evolution of the halpha luminosity function  and star formation rate density up to z&lt;0.35	measurements of the low-z halpha luminosity function have a large dispersionin the local number density of sources, and correspondingly in the sfr density.the possible causes for these discrepancies include limited volume sampling,biases arising from survey sample selection, different methods of correctingfor dust obscuration and agn contamination. the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)survey and sloan digital sky survey (sdss) provide deep spectroscopicobservations over a wide sky area enabling detection of a large sample ofstar-forming galaxies spanning 0.001&lt;sfr(halpha)&lt;100 with which to robustlymeasure the evolution of the sfr density in the low-z universe. the largenumber of high sfr galaxies present in our sample allow an improved measurementof the bright end of the luminosity function, indicating that the decrease innumber density of sources at bright luminosities is best described by asaunders functional form rather than the traditional schechter function. thisresult is consistent with other published luminosity functions in the fir andradio. for gama and sdss we find the r-band apparent magnitude limit, combinedwith the subsequent requirement for halpha detection leads to an incompletenessdue to missing bright halpha sources with faint r-band magnitudes.

1306.2424	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): linking star formation histories and  stellar mass growth	we present evidence for stochastic star formation histories in low-mass (m* &lt;10^10 msun) galaxies from observations within the galaxy and mass assembly(gama) survey. for ~73,000 galaxies between 0.05&lt;z&lt;0.32, we calculate starformation rates (sfr) and specific star formation rates (ssfr = sfr/m*) fromspectroscopic halpha measurements and apply dust corrections derived frombalmer decrements. we find a dependence of ssfr on stellar mass, such thatssfrs decrease with increasing stellar mass for star-forming galaxies, and forthe full sample, ssfrs decrease as a stronger function of stellar mass. we usesimple parametrizations of exponentially declining star formation histories toinvestigate the dependence on stellar mass of the star formation timescale andthe formation redshift. we find that parametrizations previously fit to samplesof z~1 galaxies cannot recover the distributions of ssfrs and stellar massesobserved in the gama sample between 0.05&lt;z&lt;0.32. in particular, a large numberof low-mass (m* &lt; 10^10 msun) galaxies are observed to have much higher ssfrsthan can be explained by these simple models over the redshift range of0.05&lt;z&lt;0.32, even when invoking mass-dependent staged evolution. for such alarge number of galaxies to maintain low stellar masses, yet harbour such highssfrs, requires the late onset of a weak underlying exponentially declining sfhwith stochastic bursts of star formation superimposed.

0802.2105	the real-space clustering of luminous red galaxies around z&lt;0.6 quasars  in the sloan digital sky survey	we measure the clustering of a sample of photometrically selected luminousred galaxies around a low redshift (0.2&lt;z&lt;0.6) sample of quasars selected fromthe sloan digital sky survey data release 5. we make use of a new statisticalestimator to obtain precise measurements of the lrg auto-correlations andconstrain halo occupation distributions for them. these are used to generatemock catalogs which aid in interpreting our quasar-lrg cross correlationmeasurements. the cross correlation is well described by a power law with slope1.8\pm0.1 and r_0=6\pm0.5 h^{-1} mpc, consistent with observed galaxycorrelation functions. we find no evidence for `excess' clustering on 0.1 mpcscales and demonstrate that this is consistent with the results of serber et al(2006) and strand et al (2007), when one accounts for several subtleties in theinterpretation of their measurements. combining the quasar-lrg crosscorrelation with the lrg auto-correlations, we determine a large-scale quasarbias b_qso = 1.09\pm0.15 at a median redshift of 0.43, with no observedredshift or luminosity evolution. this corresponds to a mean halo mass &lt;m&gt;~10^{12} h^{-1} m_sun, eddington ratios from 0.01 to 1 and lifetimes less than10^{7} yr. using simple models of halo occupation, these correspond to a numberdensity of quasar hosts greater than 10^{-3} h^{3} mpc^{-3} and stellar massesless than 10^{11} h^{-1} m_sun. the small-scale clustering signal can beinterpreted with the aid of our mock lrg catalogs, and depends on the manner inwhich quasars inhabit halos. we find that our small scale measurements areinconsistent with quasar positions being randomly subsampled from halo centersabove a mass threshold, requiring a satellite fraction &gt; 25 per cent.

1402.1172	zens iv. similar morphological changes associated with mass- and  environment-quenching, and the relative importance of bulge growth versus the  fading of disks	we use zens data at low redshift to study the dependence of the quenchedsatellite fraction and of the morphological mix of these quenched satellites,on three different environmental parameters: group halo mass, halo-centricdistance and large-scale structure over-density. the fraction of quenchedsatellites is independent of halo mass and the surrounding large-scaleoverdensity, but increases towards the centres of the haloes, as previouslyfound. the morphological mix is, however, constant with radial position,indicating that the well-known morphology-density relation results from theincreasing fraction of quenched galaxies towards the centres of haloes. theconstancy of the morphological outcome suggests that mass-quenching andsatellite quenching have the same effect on the morphologies of the galaxies.the quenched satellites have larger b/t and smaller half-light radii than thestar-forming satellites. these are mostly due to differences in the disks. thebulges in quenched satellites have very similar luminosities and surfacebrightness profiles, and any mass growth of the bulges associated withquenching cannot greatly change these quantities. the quenched disks arefainter and have smaller scale lengths than in star-forming satellites. thiscan be explained either by a differential fading of the disks or if disks weregenerally smaller in the past, both of which are expected in an inside-outgrowth of disks. at least at low redshifts, the structure of massive quenchedsatellites is produced by processes that operate before quenching takes place.a comparison with semi-analytic models argues for a reduction in the efficiencyof group halos in quenching their disk satellites and for mechanisms toincrease the b/t of low mass quenched satellites.

1404.2626	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): autoz spectral redshift measurements,  confidence and errors	the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey has obtained spectra of over230000 targets using the anglo-australian telescope. to homogenise the redshiftmeasurements and improve the reliability, a fully automatic redshift code wasdeveloped (autoz). the measurements were made using a cross-correlation methodfor both absorption-line and emission-line spectra. large deviations in thehigh-pass filtered spectra are partially clipped in order to be robust againstuncorrected artefacts and to reduce the weight given to single-line matches. asingle figure of merit (fom) was developed that puts all template matches ontoa similar confidence scale. the redshift confidence as a function of the fomwas fitted with a tanh function using a maximum likelihood method applied torepeat observations of targets. the method could be adapted to provide robustautomatic redshifts for other large galaxy redshift surveys. for the gamasurvey, there was a substantial improvement in the reliability of assignedredshifts and in the lowering of redshift uncertainties with a median velocityuncertainty of 33 km/s.

1407.6068	the sami galaxy survey: early data release	we present the early data release of the sydney-aao multi-object integralfield spectrograph (sami) galaxy survey. the sami galaxy survey is an ongoingintegral field spectroscopic survey of ~3400 low-redshift (z&lt;0.12) galaxies,covering galaxies in the field and in groups within the galaxy and massassembly (gama) survey regions, and a sample of galaxies in clusters.  in the early data release, we publicly release the fully calibrated datacubesfor a representative selection of 107 galaxies drawn from the gama regions,along with information about these galaxies from the gama catalogues. alldatacubes for the early data release galaxies can be downloaded individually oras a set from the sami galaxy survey website.  in this paper we also assess the quality of the pipeline used to reduce thesami data, giving metrics that quantify its performance at all stages inprocessing the raw data into calibrated datacubes. the pipeline gives excellentresults throughout, with typical sky subtraction residuals in the continuum of0.9-1.2 per cent, a relative flux calibration uncertainty of 4.1 per cent(systematic) plus 4.3 per cent (statistical), and atmospheric dispersionremoved with an accuracy of 0."09, less than a fifth of a spaxel.

1408.1476	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): galaxy close-pairs, mergers, and the  future fate of stellar mass	we use a highly complete subset of the gama-ii redshift sample to fullydescribe the stellar mass dependence of close-pairs and mergers between 10^8msun and 10^12 msun. using the analytic form of this fit we investigate thetotal stellar mass accreting onto more massive galaxies across all mass ratios.depending on how conservatively we select our robust merging systems, thefraction of mass merging onto more massive companions is 2.0%-5.6%. using thegama-ii data we see no significant evidence for a change in the close-pairfraction between redshift $z = 0.05-0.2$. however, we find a systematicallyhigher fraction of galaxies in similar mass close-pairs compared to publishedresults over a similar redshift baseline. using a compendium of data and thefunction $\gamma_m =a(1+z)m$ to predict the major close-pair fraction, we findfitting parameters of $a = 0.021 \pm 0.001$ and $m = 1.53 \pm 0.08$, whichrepresents a higher low-redshift normalisation and shallower power-law slopethan recent literature values. we find that the relative importance of in-situstar-formation versus galaxy merging is inversely correlated, withstar-formation dominating the addition of stellar material below mstar andmerger accretion events dominating beyond mstar. we find mergers have ameasurable impact on the whole extent of the gsmf, manifest as a deepening ofthe dip in the gsmf over the next gyr and an increase in mstar by as much as0.01-0.05 dex.

1411.2557	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): bivariate functions of h$\alpha$ star  forming galaxies	we present bivariate luminosity and stellar mass functions of h$\alpha$ starforming galaxies drawn from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey. whileoptically deep spectroscopic observations of gama over a wide sky area enablethe detection of a large number of $0.001&lt;{sfr}_{h\alpha}$ (m$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$)$&lt;100$ galaxies, the requirement for an h$\alpha$ detection intargets selected from an $r$-band magnitude limited survey leads to anincompleteness due to missing optically faint star forming galaxies. using$z&lt;0.1$ bivariate distributions as a reference we model the higher-$z$distributions, thereby approximating a correction for the missing opticallyfaint star forming galaxies to the local sfr and stellar mass densities.furthermore, we obtain the $r$-band lfs and stellar mass functions of h$\alpha$star forming galaxies from the bivariate lfs. as our sample is selected on thebasis of detected h$\alpha$ emission, a direct tracer of on-going starformation, this sample represents a true star forming galaxy sample, and isdrawn from both photometrically classified blue and red sub-populations, thoughmostly from the blue population. on average 20-30% of red galaxies at allstellar masses are star forming, implying that these galaxies may be dusty starforming systems.

1412.2141	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the galaxy luminosity function within  the cosmic web	we investigate the dependence of the galaxy luminosity function on geometricenvironment within the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey. the tidal tensorprescription, based on the hessian of the pseudo-gravitational potential, isused to classify the cosmic web and define the geometric environments: for agiven smoothing scale, we classify every position of the surveyed region,$0.04&lt;{z}&lt;0.26$, as either a void, a sheet, a filament or a knot. we considerhow to choose appropriate thresholds in the eigenvalues of the hessian in orderto partition the galaxies approximately evenly between environments. we find asignificant variation in the luminosity function of galaxies between differentgeometric environments; the normalisation, characterised by $\phi^{*}$ in aschechter function fit, increases by an order of magnitude from voids to knots.the turnover magnitude, characterised by $m^*$, brightens by approximately$0.5$ mag from voids to knots. however, we show that the observed modulationcan be entirely attributed to the indirect local-density dependence. wetherefore find no evidence of a direct influence of the cosmic web on thegalaxy luminosity function.

1502.06614	the galaxy - dark matter halo connection: which galaxy properties are  correlated with the host halo mass?	we demonstrate how the properties of a galaxy depend on the mass of its hostdark matter subhalo, using two independent models of galaxy formation. for thecases of stellar mass and black hole mass, the median property value displays amonotonic dependence on subhalo mass. the slope of the relation changes forsubhalo masses for which heating by active galactic nuclei becomes important.the median property values are predicted to be remarkably similar for centraland satellite galaxies. the two models predict considerable scatter around themedian property value, though the size of the scatter is model dependent. thereis only modest evolution with redshift in the median galaxy property at a fixedsubhalo mass. properties such as cold gas mass and star formation rate,however, are predicted to have a complex dependence on subhalo mass. in thesecases subhalo mass is not a good indicator of the value of the galaxy property.we illustrate how the predictions in the galaxy property - subhalo mass planediffer from the assumptions made in empirical models of galaxy clustering byreconstructing the model output using a subhalo abundance matching scheme. inits simplest form, abundance matching generally does not reproduce theclustering predicted by the models, typically resulting in an overprediction ofthe clustering signal. we show how the basic abundance matching scheme can beextended to reproduce the model predictions more faithfully, which hasimplications for the analysis of galaxy clustering, particularly for lowabundance samples.

1507.00735	dark matter halo properties of gama galaxy groups from 100 square  degrees of kids weak lensing data	the kilo-degree survey (kids) is an optical wide-field survey designed to mapthe matter distribution in the universe using weak gravitational lensing. inthis paper, we use these data to measure the density profiles and masses of asample of $\sim \mathrm{1400}$ spectroscopically identified galaxy groups andclusters from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey. we detect a highlysignificant signal (signal-to-noise-ratio $\sim$ 120), allowing us to study theproperties of dark matter haloes over one and a half order of magnitude inmass, from $m \sim 10^{13}-10^{14.5} h^{-1}\mathrm{m_{\odot}}$. we interpretthe results for various subsamples of groups using a halo model framework whichaccounts for the mis-centring of the brightest cluster galaxy (used as thetracer of the group centre) with respect to the centre of the group's darkmatter halo. we find that the density profiles of the haloes are well describedby an nfw profile with concentrations that agree with predictions fromnumerical simulations. in addition, we constrain scaling relations between themass and a number of observable group properties. we find that the mass scaleswith the total r-band luminosity as a power-law with slope $1.16 \pm 0.13$(1-sigma) and with the group velocity dispersion as a power-law with slope$1.89 \pm 0.27$ (1-sigma). finally, we demonstrate the potential of weaklensing studies of groups to discriminate between models of baryonic feedbackat group scales by comparing our results with the predictions from thecosmo-overwhelmingly large simulations (cosmo-owls) project, ruling out modelswithout agn feedback.

1507.04447	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the effect of close interactions on  star formation in galaxies	the modification of star formation (sf) in galaxy interactions is a complexprocess, with sf observed to be both enhanced in major mergers and suppressedin minor pair interactions. such changes likely to arise on short timescalesand be directly related to the galaxy-galaxy interaction time. here weinvestigate the link between dynamical phase and direct measures of sf ondifferent timescales for pair galaxies, targeting numerous star-formation rate(sfr) indicators and comparing to pair separation, individual galaxy mass andpair mass ratio. we split our sample into the higher (primary) and lower(secondary) mass galaxies in each pair and find that sf is indeed enhanced inall primary galaxies but suppressed in secondaries of minor mergers. we findthat changes in sf of primaries is consistent in both major and minor mergers,suggesting that sf in the more massive galaxy is agnostic to pair mass ratio.we also find that sf is enhanced/suppressed more strongly for short-timeduration sfr indicators (e.g. h-alpha), highlighting recent changes to sf inthese galaxies, which are likely to be induced by the interaction. we propose ascenario where the lower mass galaxy has its sf suppressed by gas heating orstripping, while the higher mass galaxy has its sf enhanced, potentially bytidal gas turbulence and shocks. this is consistent with the seeminglycontradictory observations for both sf suppression and enhancement in closepairs.

1508.06186	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the bright void galaxy population in  the optical and mid-ir	we examine the properties of galaxies in the galaxies and mass assembly(gama) survey located in voids with radii $&gt;10~h^{-1}$ mpc. utilising the gamaequatorial survey, 592 void galaxies are identified out to z~0.1 brighter than$m_{r} = -18.4$, our magnitude completeness limit. using the $w_{\rm{h\alpha}}$vs. [nii]/h$\alpha$ (whan) line strength diagnostic diagram, we classify theirspectra as star forming, agn, or dominated by old stellar populations. forobjects more massive than $5\times10^{9}$ m$_{\odot}$, we identify a sample of26 void galaxies with old stellar populations classed as passive and retiredgalaxies in the whan diagnostic diagram, else they lack any emission lines intheir spectra. when matched to wise mid-ir photometry, these passive andretired galaxies exhibit a range of mid-ir colour, with a number of voidgalaxies exhibiting [4.6]-[12] colours inconsistent with completely quenchedstellar populations, with a similar spread in colour seen for a randomly drawnnon-void comparison sample. we hypothesise that a number of these galaxies hostobscured star formation, else they are star forming outside of their centralregions targeted for single fibre spectroscopy. when matched to a randomlydrawn sample of non-void galaxies, the void and non-void galaxies exhibitsimilar properties in terms of optical and mid-ir colour, morphology, and starformation activity, suggesting comparable mass assembly and quenchinghistories. a trend in mid-ir [4.6]-[12] colour is seen, such that both void andnon-void galaxies with quenched/passive colours &lt;1.5 typically have masseshigher than $10^{10}$ m$_{\odot}$, where internally driven processes play anincreasingly important role in galaxy evolution.

1601.00003	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the 325 mhz radio luminosity function  of agn and star forming galaxies	measurement of the evolution of both active galactic nuclei (agn) andstar-formation in galaxies underpins our understanding of galaxy evolution overcosmic time. radio continuum observations can provide key information on thesetwo processes, in particular via the mechanical feedback produced by radio jetsin agn, and via an unbiased dust-independent measurement of star-formationrates. in this paper we determine radio luminosity functions at 325 mhz for asample of agn and star-forming galaxies by matching a 138 deg sq. radio surveyconducted with the giant metrewave radio telescope (gmrt), with optical imagingand redshifts from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey. we find that theradio luminosity function at 325 mhz for star-forming galaxies closely followsthat measured at 1.4 ghz. by fitting the agn radio luminosity function out to$z = 0.5$ as a double power law, and parametrizing the evolution as ${\phi}\propto (1 + z)^{k}$ , we find evolution parameters of $k = 0.92 \pm 0.95$assuming pure density evolution and $k = 2.13 \pm 1.96$ assuming pureluminosity evolution. we find that the low excitation radio galaxies are thedominant population in space density at lower luminosities. comparing our 325mhz observations with radio continuum imaging at 1.4 ghz, we determine separateradio luminosity functions for steep and flat-spectrum agn, and show that thebeamed population of flat-spectrum sources in our sample can be shifted innumber density and luminosity to coincide with the unbeamed population ofsteep-spectrum sources, as is expected in the orientation based unification ofagn.

astro-ph;0105500	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: luminosity dependence of galaxy  clustering	we investigate the dependence of the strength of galaxy clustering onintrinsic luminosity using the anglo-australian two degree field galaxyredshift survey (2dfgrs). the 2dfgrs is over an order of magnitude larger thanprevious redshift surveys used to address this issue. we measure the projectedtwo-point correlation function of galaxies in a series of volume-limitedsamples. the projected correlation function is free from any distortion of theclustering pattern induced by peculiar motions and is well described by apower-law in pair separation over the range 0.1 &lt; r /h mpc &lt; 10. the clusteringof l* galaxies in real space is well fit by a correlation length r0 = 4.9 +/-0.3 /h mpc and power-law slope gamma = 1.71 +/- 0.06. the clustering amplitudeincreases slowly with absolute magnitude for galaxies fainter than m*, butrises more strongly at higher luminosities. at low luminosities, our resultsagree with measurements from the ssrs2 by benoist et al. however, we find aweaker dependence of clustering strength on luminosity at the highestluminosities. the correlation function amplitude increases by a factor of 4.0between $m_{b_{j}} -5\log_{10}h = -18$ and -22.5, and the most luminousgalaxies are 3.0 times more strongly clustered than l* galaxies. the power-lawslope of the correlation function shows remarkably little variation for samplesspanning a factor of 20 in luminosity. our measurements are in very goodagreement with the predictions of the hierarchical galaxy formation models ofbenson et al.

astro-ph;0107197	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: galaxy luminosity functions per spectral  type	we calculate the optical bj luminosity function of the 2df galaxy redshiftsurvey (2dfgrs) for different subsets defined by their spectral properties.these spectrally selected subsets are defined using a new parameter, eta, whichis a linear combination of the first two projections derived from a principalcomponent analysis. this parameter eta identifies the average emission andabsorption line strength in the galaxy rest-frame spectrum and hence is auseful indicator of the present star formation. we use a total of 75,000galaxies in our calculations, chosen from a sample of high signal-to-noiseratio, low redshift galaxies observed before january 2001. we find that thereis a systematic steepening of the faint end slope (alpha) as one moves frompassive (alpha = -0.54) to active (alpha = -1.50) star-forming galaxies, andthat there is also a corresponding faintening of the rest-frame characteristicmagnitude m* - 5\log_10(h) (from -19.6 to -19.2). we also show that theschechter function provides a poor fit to the quiescent (type 1) lf for veryfaint galaxies (m - 5log_10(h) fainter than -16.0), perhaps suggesting thepresence of a significant dwarf population. the luminosity functions presentedhere give a precise confirmation of the trends seen previously in a muchsmaller preliminary 2dfgrs sample, and in other surveys. we also present a newprocedure for determining self-consistent k-corrections and investigatepossible fibre-aperture biases.

astro-ph;0110676	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: constraints on cosmic star-formation  history from the cosmic spectrum	we present the first results on the history of star formation in the universebased on the `cosmic spectrum', in particular, the volume-averaged,luminosity-weighted, stellar absorption line spectrum of present day galaxiesfrom the 2dfgrs. this method is novel in that unlike previous studies it is notan estimator based on total luminosity density. the cosmic spectrum is fittedwith models of population synthesis, tracing the history of star formationprior to the epoch of the observed galaxies, using a method we have developedwhich decouples continuum and spectral-line variations and is robust againstspectrophotometric uncertainties. the cosmic spectrum can only be fitted withmodels incorporating chemical evolution and indicates there was a peak ofstar-formation rate in the past of at least three times the current value andthat the increase back to z=1, assuming it scales as (1+z)^beta, has a strongupper limit of beta&lt;5. we find in the general case there is some modeldegeneracy between star formation at low and high redshift. however, if weincorporate previous work on star formation at z&lt;1 we can put strong upperlimits on the sfr at z&gt;1: e.g., if beta&gt;2 then the sfr for 1&lt;z&lt;5 scales as(1+z)^alpha with alpha&lt;2. this is equivalent to stating that no more than 80%of stars in the universe formed at z&gt;1. our results are consistent with thebest-fit results from compilations of cosmic sfr estimates based on uvluminosity density, which give 1.8&lt;beta&lt;2.9 and -1.0&lt;alpha&lt;0.7, and are alsoconsistent with estimates of omega_stars based on the k-band luminositydensity.

astro-ph;0112043	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: the dependence of galaxy clustering on  luminosity and spectral type	we investigate the dependence of galaxy clustering on luminosity and spectraltype using the 2df galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs). spectral types are assignedusing the principal component analysis of madgwick et al. we divide the sampleinto two broad spectral classes: galaxies with strong emission lines(`late-types'), and more quiescent galaxies (`early-types'). we measure theclustering in real space, free from any distortion of the clustering patterndue to peculiar velocities, for a series of volume-limited samples. theprojected correlation functions of both spectral types are well described by apower law for transverse separations in the range 2 &lt; (sigma/mpc/h) &lt; 15, witha marginally steeper slope for early-types than late-types. both early and latetypes have approximately the same dependence of clustering strength onluminosity, with the clustering amplitude increasing by a factor of ~2.5between l* and 4 l*. at all luminosities, however, the correlation functionamplitude for the early-types is ~50% higher than that of the late-types. theseresults support the view that luminosity, and not type, is the dominant factorin determining how the clustering strength of the whole galaxy populationvaries with luminosity.

astro-ph;0112161	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: the bias of galaxies and the density of  the universe	we compute the bispectrum of the 2df galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) and useit to measure the bias parameter of the galaxies. this parameter quantifies thestrength of clustering of the galaxies relative to the mass in the universe. byanalysing 80 million triangle configurations in the wavenumber range 0.1 &lt; k &lt;0.5 h/mpc (i.e. on scales roughly between 5 and 30 mpc/h) we find that thelinear bias parameter is consistent with unity: b_1=1.04 pm 0.11, and thequadratic (nonlinear) bias is consistent with zero: b_2=-0.054 pm 0.08. thus,at least on large scales, optically-selected galaxies do indeed trace theunderlying mass distribution. the bias parameter can be combined with the2dfgrs measurement of the redshift distortion parameter beta =omega_m^{0.6}/b_1, to yield omega_m = 0.27 pm 0.06 for the matter density ofthe universe, a result which is determined entirely from this survey,independently of other datasets. our measurement of the matter density of theuniverse should be interpreted as omega_m at the effective redshift of thesurvey (z=0.17).

astro-ph;0204239	studying large-scale structure with the 2df galaxy redshift survey	the 2df galaxy redshift survey is the first to observe more than 100,000redshifts. this allows precise measurements of many of the key statistics ofgalaxy clustering, in particular redshift-space distortions and the large-scalepower spectrum. this paper presents the current 2dfgrs results in these areas.redshift-space distortions are detected with a high degree of significance,confirming the detailed kaiser distortion from large-scale infall velocities,and measuring the distortion parameter beta equiv omega_m^{0.6}/b = 0.43 +-0.07. the power spectrum is measured to &lt; 10% accuracy for k &gt; 0.02 h mpc^{-1},and is well fitted by a cdm model with omega_m h = 0.20 +- 0.03 and a baryonfraction of 0.15 +- 0.07. a joint analysis with cmb data requires omega_m =0.29 +- 0.05, assuming scalar fluctuations, but no priors on other parameters.two methods are used to determine the large-scale bias parameter: an internalbispectrum analysis yields b = 1.04 +- 0.11, in very good agreement with the b= 1.10 +- 0.08 obtained from a joint 2dfgrs+cmb analysis, again assuming scalarfluctuations. these figures refer to galaxies of approximate luminosity 2l^*;luminosity dependence of clustering is detected at high significance, and iswell described by b/b^* = 0.85 + 0.15(l/l^*).

astro-ph;0212375	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: correlation functions, peculiar  velocities and the matter density of the universe	we present a detailed analysis of the two-point correlation function, fromthe 2df galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs). we estimate the redshift-spacecorrelation function, xi(s), from which we measure the redshift-spaceclustering length, s_0=6.82+/-0.28 mpc/h. we also estimate the projectedcorrelation function, xi(sigma), and the real-space correlation function,xi(r), which can be fit by a power-law, with r_0=5.05+/-0.26mpc/h,gamma_r=1.67+/-0.03. for r&gt;20mpc/h, xi drops below a power-law as is expectedin the popular lcdm model. the ratio of amplitudes of the real andredshift-space correlation functions on scales of 8-30mpc/h gives an estimateof the redshift-space distortion parameter beta. the quadrupole moment of xi onscales 30-40mpc/h provides another estimate of beta. we also estimate thedistribution function of pairwise peculiar velocities, f(v), includingrigorously the effect of infall velocities, and find that it is well fit by anexponential. the accuracy of our xi measurement is sufficient to constrain amodel, which simultaneously fits the shape and amplitude of xi(r) and the tworedshift-space distortion effects parameterized by beta and velocitydispersion, a. we find beta=0.49+/-0.09 and a=506+/-52km/s, though the best fitvalues are strongly correlated. we measure the variation of the peculiarvelocity dispersion with projected separation, a(sigma), and find that theshape is consistent with models and simulations. using the constraints on biasfrom recent estimates, and taking account of redshift evolution, we concludethat beta(l=l*,z=0)=0.47+/-0.08, and that the present day matter density of theuniverse is 0.3, consistent with other 2dfgrs estimates and independentanalyses.

astro-ph;0303668	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: galaxy clustering per spectral type	we have calculated the two-point correlation functions in redshift space,xi(sigma,pi), for galaxies of different spectral types in the 2df galaxyredshift survey. using these correlation functions we are able to estimatevalues of the linear redshift-space distortion parameter, beta = omega_m^0.6/b,the pairwise velocity dispersion, a, and the real-space correlation function,xi(r), for galaxies with both relatively low star-formation rates (for whichthe present rate of star formation is less than 10% of its past averaged value)and galaxies with higher current star-formation activity. at small separations,the real-space clustering of passive galaxies is very much stronger than thatof the more actively star-forming galaxies; the correlation-function slopes arerespectively 1.93 and 1.50, and the relative bias between the two classes is adeclining function of radius. on scales larger than 10 h^-1 mpc there isevidence that the relative bias tends to a constant, b(passive)/b(active) ~ 1.this result is consistent with the similar degrees of redshift-spacedistortions seen in the correlation functions of the two classes -- thecontours of xi(sigma,pi) require beta(active)=0.49+/-0.13, andbeta(passive)=0.48+/-0.14. the pairwise velocity dispersion is highlycorrelated with beta. however, despite this a significant difference is seenbetween the two classes. over the range 8-20 h^-1 mpc, the pairwise velocitydispersion has mean values 416+/-76 km/s and 612+/-92 km/s for the active andpassive galaxy samples respectively. this is consistent with the expectationfrom morphological segregation, in which passively evolving galaxiespreferentially inhabit the cores of high-mass virialised regions.

astro-ph;0312317	the millennium galaxy catalogue: the photometric accuracy, completeness  and contamination of the 2dfgrs and sdss-edr &amp; dr1 datasets	the millennium galaxy catalogue (mgc) is a deep ($\mu_{\rm b,lim}=26$ magarcsec$^{-2}$), wide field ccd imaging survey, covering 37.5deg$^2$ and iscompletely contained within the 2dfgrs and sdss-edr. we compare the photometryand completeness of the 2dfgrs and the sdss-edr with the mgc. we have alsoundertaken a photometric comparison to scos and sdss-dr1 data.  we find that $b_{mgc}-b_{2df}=0.035$ mag with an uncertainty of 0.142 mag pergalaxy, $b_{mgc}-b_{scos}=0.032$ mag with an uncertainty of 0.108 mag,$b_{mgc}-b_{sdss-edr}=0.032$ mag with an uncertainty of 0.094 mag, and$b_{mgc}-b_{sdss-dr1}=0.039$ mag with an uncertainty of 0.086 mag. we find thathigh surface brightness 2dfgrs galaxies are systematically too faint. in thesdss there is a weak non-linear scale error, which is negligible for faintgalaxies. lsbgs in the sdss are systematically fainter.  we find that the 2dfgrs catalogue has 5.2% stellar contamination, 7.0% ofobjects are resolved into 2 or more by the mgc and is 8.7% incomplete comparedto the mgc. from our all object spectroscopic survey we find that the mgc isitself misclassifying 5.6% of galaxies as stars, hence the 2dfgrs misses 14.3%of the galaxies. the sdss-edr galaxy catalogue has 1.3% stellar contaminationand 5.3% of galaxies misclassified as stars, and is 1.8% incomplete compared tothe mgc. altogether 7.1% of the total galaxy population are missing from thesdss-edr catalogue from incompleteness or misclassification.

astro-ph;0401405	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: hierarchical galaxy clustering	we use the two-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) to test thehierarchical scaling hypothesis: namely, that the $p$-point galaxy correlationfunctions can be written in terms of the two point correlation function orvariance. this scaling is expected if an initially gaussian distribution ofdensity fluctuations evolves under the action of gravitational instability. wemeasure the volume averaged $p$-point correlation functions using a counts incells technique applied to a volume limited sample of 44,931 $l_*$ galaxies. wedemonstrate that $l_{*}$ galaxies display hierarchical clustering up to order$p=6$ in redshift space. the variance measured for $l_{*}$ galaxies is inexcellent agreement with the predictions from a $\lambda$-cold dark mattern-body simulation. this applies to all cell radii considered,$0.3&lt;(r/h^{-1}{\rm mpc})&lt;30$. however, the higher order correlation functionsof $l_*$ galaxies have a significantly smaller amplitude than is predicted forthe dark matter for $r&lt;10h^{-1}$mpc. this disagreement implies that anon-linear bias exists between the dark matter and $l_*$ galaxies on thesescales. we also show that the presence of two rare, massive superclusters inthe 2dfgrs has an impact on the higher-order clustering moments measured onlarge scales.

astro-ph;0401406	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: voids and hierarchical scaling models	we measure the redshift space reduced void probability function (vpf) for2dfgrs volume limited galaxy samples covering the absolute magnitude rangem_bj-5logh=-18 to -22. theoretically, the vpf connects the distribution ofvoids to the moments of galaxy clustering of all orders, and can be used todiscriminate clustering models in the weakly non-linear regime. the reduced vpfmeasured from the 2dfgrs is in excellent agreement with the paradigm ofhierarchical scaling of the galaxy clustering moments. the accuracy of ourmeasurement is such that we can rule out, at a very high significance, popularmodels for galaxy clustering, including the lognormal distribution. wedemonstrate that the negative binomial model gives a very good approximation tothe 2dfgrs data over a wide range of scales, out to at least 20h-1mpc.conversely, the reduced vpf for dark matter in a lambdacdm universe does appearto be lognormal on small scales but deviates significantly beyond \approx4h-1mpc. we find little dependence of the 2dfgrs reduced vpf on galaxyluminosity. our results hold independently in both the north and south galacticpole survey regions.

astro-ph;0402566	galaxy groups in the 2dfgrs: the luminous content of the groups	the 2dfgrs percolation-inferred galaxy group (2pigg) catalogue of ~29000objects is used to study the luminous content of galaxy systems of varioussizes. mock galaxy catalogues constructed from cosmological simulations areused to gauge the accuracy with which intrinsic group properties can berecovered. a schechter function is found to be a reasonable fit to the galaxyluminosity functions in groups of different mass in the real data. thecharacteristic luminosity l* is larger for more massive groups. however, themock data show that the shape of the recovered luminosity function is expectedto differ from the true shape, and this must be allowed for when interpretingthe data. the variation of halo mass-to-light ratio with group size is studiedin both these wavebands. a robust trend of increasing m/l with increasing groupluminosity is found in the 2pigg data. from groups with l_bj=10^{10}lsol tothose 100 times more luminous, the typical bj-band m/l increases by a factor of5, whereas the rf-band m/l grows by a factor of 3.5. these trends agree wellwith the simulations, which also predict a minimum m/l on a scale correspondingto the local group. our data indicate that if such a minimum exists, then itmust occur at l&lt;~10^{10}lsol, below the range accurately probed by the 2piggcatalogue. according to the mock data, the bj m/ls of the largest groups areexpected to be approximately 1.1 times the global value. assuming that thiscorrection applies to the real data yields an estimate of omega_m=0.26+/-0.03(statistical).

astro-ph;0404275	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: stochastic relative biasing between  galaxy populations	it is well known that the clustering of galaxies depends on galaxy type.suchrelative bias complicates the inference of cosmological parameters from galaxyredshift surveys, and is a challenge to theories of galaxy formation andevolution. in this paper we perform a joint counts-in-cells analysis ongalaxies in the 2df galaxy redshift survey, classified by both colour andspectral type, eta, as early or late type galaxies. we fit three differentmodels of relative bias to the joint probability distribution of the cellcounts, assuming poisson sampling of the galaxy density field. we investigatethe nonlinearity and stochasticity of the relative bias, with cubical cells ofside 10mpc \leq l \leq 45mpc (h=0.7). exact linear bias is ruled out with highsignificance on all scales. power law bias gives a better fit, but likelihoodratios prefer a bivariate lognormal distribution, with a non-zero`stochasticity' - i.e. scatter that may result from physical effects on galaxyformation other than those from the local density field. using this model, wemeasure a correlation coefficient in log-density space (r_ln) of 0.958 forcells of length l=10mpc, increasing to 0.970 by l=45mpc. this corresponds to astochasticity sigma_b/bhat of 0.44\pm0.02 and 0.27\pm0.05 respectively. forsmaller cells, the poisson sampled lognormal distribution presents anincreasingly poor fit to the data, especially with regard to the fraction ofcompletely empty cells. we compare these trends with the predictions ofsemianalytic galaxy formation models: these match the data well in terms ofoverall level of stochasticity, variation with scale, and fraction of emptycells.

astro-ph;0404276	the nature of the relative bias between galaxies of different spectral  type in 2dfgrs	we present an analysis of the relative bias between early- and late-typegalaxies in the two-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs). our analysisexamines the joint counts in cells between early- and late-type galaxies, usingapproximately cubical cells with sides ranging from 7h^{-1}mpc to 42h^{-1}mpc.we measure the variance of the counts in cells using the method of efstathiouet al. (1990), which we find requires a correction for a finite volume effect.we fit lognormal models to the one-point density distribution and developmethods of dealing with biases in the recovered variances resulting from thistechnique. we directly fit deterministic models for the joint densitydistribution function, f(delta_e,delta_l), to the joint counts in cells using amaximum likelihood technique. our results are consistent with a scale invariantrelative bias factor on all scales studied. linear bias is ruled out on scalesless than l=28h^{-1}mpc. a power-law bias model is a significantly better fitto the data on all but the largest scales studied; the relative goodness of fitof this model as compared to that of the linear bias model suggests that anynonlinearity is negligible for l&gt;~40h^{-1}mpc, consistent with the expectationfrom theory that the bias should become linear on large scales.

astro-ph;0501174	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: power-spectrum analysis of the final  dataset and cosmological implications	we present a power spectrum analysis of the final 2df galaxy redshift survey,employing a direct fourier method. the sample used comprises 221,414 galaxieswith measured redshifts. we investigate in detail the modelling of the sampleselection. a new angular mask is derived, based on revisions to the photometriccalibration. the redshift selection function is determined by dividing thesurvey according to rest-frame colour, and deducing a self-consistent treatmentof k-corrections and evolution for each population. the covariance matrix forthe power-spectrum estimates is determined using two different approaches tothe construction of mock surveys which are used to demonstrate that the inputcosmological model can be correctly recovered. we are confident that the 2dfgrspower spectrum can be used to infer the matter content of the universe. onlarge scales, our estimated power spectrum shows evidence for the `baryonoscillations' that are predicted in cdm models. fitting to a cdm model,assuming a primordial $n_{s}=1$ spectrum, $h=0.72$ and negligible neutrinomass, the preferred parameters are $\omega_{m} h = 0.168 \pm 0.016$ and abaryon fraction $\omega_{b} /\omega_{m} = 0.185\pm0.046$ (1$\sigma$ errors).the value of $\omega_{m} h$ is $1\sigma$ lower than the $0.20 \pm 0.03$ in our2001 analysis of the partially complete 2dfgrs. this shift is largely due tothe signal from the newly-sampled regions of space, rather than the refinementsin the treatment of observational selection. this analysis therefore implies adensity significantly below the standard $\omega_{m} =0.3$: in combination withcmb data from wmap, we infer $\omega_{m} =0.231\pm 0.021$.

astro-ph;0506249	statistical analysis of galaxy surveys-ii. the 3-point galaxy  correlation function measured from the 2dfgrs	we present new results for the 3-point correlation function, \zeta, measuredas a function of scale, luminosity and colour from the final version of thetwo-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs). the reduced three pointcorrelation function, q_3 is estimated for different triangle shapes and sizes,employing a full covariance analysis. the form of q_3 is consistent with theexpectations for the \lambda-cold dark matter model, confirming that theprimary influence shaping the distribution of galaxies is gravitationalinstability acting on gaussian primordial fluctuations. however, we find aclear offset in amplitude between q_3 for galaxies and the predictions for thedark matter. we are able to rule out the scenario in which galaxies areunbiased tracers of the mass at the 9-sigma level. on weakly non-linear scales,we can interpret our results in terms of galaxy bias parameters. we find alinear bias term that is consistent with unity, b_1 = 0.93^{+0.10}_{-0.08} anda quadratic bias c_2 = b_2 /b_1 = -0.34^{+0.11}_{-0.08}. this is the firstsignificant detection of a non-zero quadratic bias, indicating a small butimportant non-gravitational contribution to the three point function. ourestimate of the linear bias from the three point function is independent of thenormalisation of underlying density fluctuations, so we can combine this withthe measurement of the power spectrum of 2dfgrs galaxies to constrain theamplitude of matter fluctuations. we find that the rms linear theory variancein spheres of radius 8mpc/h is \sigma_8 = 0.88^{+0.12}_{-0.10}, providing anindependent confirmation of values derived from other techniques. on non-linearscales, where \xi&gt;1, we find that q_3 has a strong dependence on scale, colourand luminosity.

astro-ph;0507583	cosmological parameters from cmb measurements and the final 2dfgrs power  spectrum	we derive constraints on cosmological parameters using the power spectrum ofgalaxy clustering measured from the final two-degree field galaxy redshiftsurvey (2dfgrs) and a compilation of measurements of the temperature powerspectrum and temperature-polarization cross-correlation of the cosmic microwavebackground radiation. we analyse a range of parameter sets and priors, allowingfor massive neutrinos, curvature, tensors and general dark energy models. inall cases, the combination of datasets tightens the constraints, with the mostdramatic improvements found for the density of dark matter and theenergy-density of dark energy. if we assume a flat universe, we find a matterdensity parameter of $\omega_{\rm m}=0.237 \pm 0.020$, a baryon densityparameter of $\omega_{\rm b} = 0.041 \pm 0.002$, a hubble constant of$h_{0}=74\pm2 {\rm kms}^{-1}{\rm mpc}^{-1}$, a linear theory matter fluctuationamplitude of $\sigma_{8}=0.77\pm0.05$ and a scalar spectral index of $n_{\rms}=0.954 \pm 0.023$ (all errors show the 68% interval). our estimate of $n_{\rms}$ is only marginally consistent with the scale invariant value $n_{\rm s}=1$;this spectrum is formally excluded at the 95% confidence level. however, thedetection of a tilt in the spectrum is sensitive to the choice of parameterspace. if we allow the equation of state of the dark energy to float, we find$w_{\rm de}= -0.85_{-0.17}^{+0.18}$, consistent with a cosmological constant.we also place new limits on the mass fraction of massive neutrinos: $f_{\nu} &lt;0.105$ at the 95% level, corresponding to $\sum m_{\nu} &lt; 1.2$ ev.

astro-ph;0701131	can large-scale structure probe cmb-constrained non-gaussianity?	the first year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) set quantitativeconstraints on the amplitude of any primordial non-gaussianity. we run a seriesof dark matter-only n-body simulations with the wmap constraints to investigatethe effect of the presence of primordial non-gaussianity on large scalestructures. the model parameters can be constrained using the observations ofprotoclusters associated with ly-$\alpha$ emitters at high redshift ($2 \leq z\leq 4$), assuming the galaxy velocity bias can be modelled properly. highredshift structure formation potentially provides a more powerful test ofpossible primordial non-gaussianity than does the cmb, albeit on smallerscales. another constraint is given by the local galaxy density probabilitydistribution function (pdf), as mapped by the 2 degree field galaxy redshiftsurvey (2dfgrs). the pdf of 2dfgrs \lstar galaxies is substantially higher thanthe standard model predictions and requires either a non-negligible biasbetween galaxy and dark matter on $\sim 12$~\hmpc scales or a strongernon-gaussianity than allowed by the wmap year one data. the latterinterpretation is preferred since second-order bias corrections are negative.with a lower normalisation of the power spectrum fluctuations, sigma_8=0.74, asfavoured by the wmap 3 year data, the discrepancy between the gaussian modeland the data is even larger.
