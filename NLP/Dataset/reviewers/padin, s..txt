0901.4540	cosmological results from five years of 30 ghz cmb intensity  measurements with the cosmic background imager	we present final results on the angular power spectrum of total intensityanisotropies in the cmb from the cbi. our analysis includes all primordialanisotropy data collected between january 2000 and april 2005, and benefitssignificantly from an improved maximum likelihood analysis pipeline. it alsoincludes results from a 30 ghz foreground survey conducted with the green banktelescope (gbt) which places significant constraints on the possiblecontamination due to foreground point sources. we improve on previous cbiresults by about a factor of two in the damping tail. these data confirm, at~3-sigma, the existence of an excess of power over intrinsic cmb anisotropy onsmall angular scales (l &gt; 1800). using the gbt survey, we find currently knownradio source populations are not capable of generating the power; a newpopulation of faint sources with steeply rising spectral indices would berequired to explain the excess with sources... we also present a fullcosmological parameter analysis of the new cbi power spectrum... with cbialone, the full parameter analysis finds the excess is 1.6-sigma above thelevel expected for a sigma_8=0.8 universe. we find the addition of high-l cmbdata substantially improves constraints on cosmic string contributions to thett power spectrum as well as the running of the scalar spectral index... wealso present forecasts for what other experiments should see at differentfrequencies and angular resolutions given the excess power observed by cbi. wefind that the reported high-l bandpowers from current high resolution cmbbolometer experiments are consistent with each other and cbi if the excesspower is due to the sze at the cbi-level of 2.5 +/- 1 times the sigma_8=0.8standard sz template. &lt;abridged&gt;

0911.2444	sunyaev-zel'dovich cluster profiles measured with the south pole  telescope	we present sunyaev-zel'dovich measurements of 15 massive x-ray selectedgalaxy clusters obtained with the south pole telescope. the sunyaev-zel'dovich(sz) cluster signals are measured at 150 ghz, and concurrent 220 ghz data areused to reduce astrophysical contamination. radial profiles are computed usinga technique that takes into account the effects of the beams and filtering. inseveral clusters, significant sz decrements are detected out to a substantialfraction of the virial radius. the profiles are fit to the beta model and to ageneralized nfw pressure profile, and are scaled and stacked to probe theiraverage behavior. we find model parameters that are consistent with previousstudies: beta=0.86 and r_core/r_500 = 0.20 for the beta model, and (alpha,beta, gamma, c_500)=(1.0,5.5,0.5,1.0) for the generalized nfw model. bothmodels fit the spt data comparably well, and both are consistent with theaverage sz profile out to the virial radius. the integrated compton-y parametery_sz is computed for each cluster using both model-dependent andmodel-independent techniques, and the results are compared to x-ray estimatesof cluster parameters. we find that y_sz scales with y_x and gas mass with lowscatter. since these observables have been found to scale with total mass, ourresults point to a tight mass-observable relation for the spt cluster survey.

0912.2338	extragalactic millimeter-wave sources in south pole telescope survey  data: source counts, catalog, and statistics for an 87 square-degree field	we report the results of an 87 square-degree point-source survey centered atr.a. 5h30m, decl. -55 deg. taken with the south pole telescope (spt) at 1.4 and2.0 mm wavelengths with arc-minute resolution and milli-jansky depth. based onthe ratio of flux in the two bands, we separate the detected sources into twopopulations, one consistent with synchrotron emission from active galacticnuclei (agn) and one consistent with thermal emission from dust. we presentsource counts for each population from 11 to 640 mjy at 1.4 mm and from 4.4 to800 mjy at 2.0 mm. the 2.0 mm counts are dominated by synchrotron-dominatedsources across our reported flux range; the 1.4 mm counts are dominated bysynchroton-dominated sources above ~15 mjy and by dust-dominated sources belowthat flux level. we detect 141 synchrotron-dominated sources and 47dust-dominated sources at s/n &gt; 4.5 in at least one band. all of the mostsignificantly detected members of the synchrotron-dominated population areassociated with sources in previously published radio catalogs. some of thedust-dominated sources are associated with nearby (z &lt;&lt; 1) galaxies whose dustemission is also detected by the infrared astronomy satellite (iras). however,most of the bright, dust-dominated sources have no counterparts in any existingcatalogs. we argue that these sources represent the rarest and brightestmembers of the population commonly referred to as sub-millimeter galaxies(smgs). because these sources are selected at longer wavelengths than intypical smg surveys, they are expected to have a higher mean redshiftdistribution and may provide a new window on galaxy formation in the earlyuniverse.

0912.4315	angular power spectra of the millimeter wavelength background light from  dusty star-forming galaxies with the south pole telescope	we use data from the first 100 square-degree field observed by the south poletelescope (spt) in 2008 to measure the angular power spectrum of temperatureanisotropies contributed by the background of dusty star-forming galaxies(dsfgs) at millimeter wavelengths. from the auto and cross-correlation of 150and 220 ghz spt maps, we significantly detect both poisson distributed and, forthe first time at millimeter wavelengths, clustered components of power from abackground of dsfgs. the spectral indices between 150 and 220 ghz of thepoisson and clustered components are found to be 3.86 +- 0.23 and 3.8 +- 1.3respectively, implying a steep scaling of the dust emissivity index beta ~ 2.the poisson and clustered power detected in spt, blast (at 600, 860, and 1200ghz), and spitzer (1900 ghz) data can be understood in the context of a simplemodel in which all galaxies have the same graybody spectrum with dustemissivity index of beta = 2 and dust temperature t_d = 34 k. in this model,half of the 150 ghz background light comes from redshifts greater than 3.2. wealso use the spt data to place an upper limit on the amplitude of the kineticsunyaev-zel'dovich power spectrum at l = 3000 of 13 uk^2 at 95% confidence.

0912.4317	measurements of secondary cosmic microwave background anisotropies with  the south pole telescope	we report cosmic microwave background (cmb) power spectrum measurements fromthe first 100 sq. deg. field observed by the south pole telescope (spt) at 150and 220 ghz. on angular scales where the primary cmb anisotropy is dominant,ell ~&lt; 3000, the spt power spectrum is consistent with the standard lambdacdmcosmology. on smaller scales, we see strong evidence for a point sourcecontribution, consistent with a population of dusty, star-forming galaxies.after we mask bright point sources, anisotropy power on angular scales of 3000&lt; ell &lt; 9500 is detected with a signal-to-noise &gt; 50 at both frequencies. wecombine the 150 and 220 ghz data to remove the majority of the point sourcepower, and use the point source subtracted spectrum to detectsunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) power at 2.6 sigma. at ell=3000, the sz power in thesubtracted bandpowers is 4.2 +/- 1.5 uk^2, which is significantly lower thanthe power predicted by a fiducial model using wmap5 cosmological parameters.this discrepancy may suggest that contemporary galaxy cluster modelsoverestimate the thermal pressure of intracluster gas. alternatively, thisresult can be interpreted as evidence for lower values of sigma8. when combinedwith an estimate of the kinetic sz contribution, the measured sz amplitudeshifts sigma8 from the primary cmb anisotropy derived constraint of 0.794 +/-0.028 down to 0.773 +/- 0.025. the uncertainty in the constraint on sigma8 fromthis analysis is dominated by uncertainties in the theoretical modelingrequired to predict the amplitude of the sz power spectrum for a given set ofcosmological parameters.

1003.0003	galaxy clusters selected with the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect from 2008  south pole telescope observations	we present a detection-significance-limited catalog of 21 sunyaev-zel'dovichselected galaxy clusters. these clusters, along with 1 unconfirmed candidate,were identified in 178 deg^2 of sky surveyed in 2008 by the south poletelescope to a depth of 18 uk-arcmin at 150 ghz. optical imaging from theblanco cosmology survey (bcs) and magellan telescopes provided photometric (andin some cases spectroscopic) redshift estimates, with catalog redshifts rangingfrom z=0.15 to z&gt;1, with a median z = 0.74. of the 21 confirmed galaxyclusters, three were previously identified as abell clusters, three werepresented as spt discoveries in staniszewski et al, 2009, and three were firstidentified in a recent analysis of bcs data by menanteau et al, 2010; theremaining 12 clusters are presented for the first time in this work. simulatedobservations of the spt fields predict the sample to be nearly 100% completeabove a mass threshold of m_200 ~ 5x10^14 m_sun/h at z = 0.6. this completenessthreshold pushes to lower mass with increasing redshift, dropping to ~4x10^14m_sun/h at z=1. the size and redshift distribution of this catalog are in goodagreement with expectations based on our current understanding of galaxyclusters and cosmology. in combination with other cosmological probes, we usethe cluster catalog to improve estimates of cosmological parameters. assuming astandard spatially flat wcdm cosmological model, the addition of our catalog tothe wmap 7-year analysis yields sigma_8 = 0.81 +- 0.09 and w = -1.07 +- 0.29, a~50% improvement in precision on both parameters over wmap7 alone.

1006.3068	x-ray properties of the first sze-selected galaxy cluster sample from  the south pole telescope	we present results of x-ray observations of a sample of 15 clusters selectedvia their imprint on the cosmic microwave background (cmb) from the thermalsunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect. these clusters are a subset of the firstsz-selected cluster catalog, obtained from observations of 178 deg^2 of skysurveyed by the south pole telescope. using x-ray observations with chandra andxmm-newton, we estimate the temperature, t_x, and mass, m_g, of theintracluster medium (icm) within r_500 for each cluster. from these, wecalculate y_x=m_g t_x and estimate the total cluster mass using a m_500-y_xscaling relation measured from previous x-ray studies. the integratedcomptonization, y_sz, is derived from the sz measurements, using additionalinformation from the x-ray measured gas density profiles and a universaltemperature profile. we calculate scaling relations between the x-ray and szobservables, and find results generally consistent with other measurements andthe expectations from simple self-similar behavior. specifically, we fit ay_sz-y_x relation and find a normalization of 0.82 +- 0.07, marginallyconsistent with the predicted ratio of y_sz/y_x=0.91+-0.01 that would beexpected from the density and temperature models used in this work. using they_x derived mass estimates, we fit a y_sz-m_500 relation and find a slopeconsistent with the self-similar expectation of y_sz ~ m^5/3 with anormalization consistent with predictions from other x-ray studies. we comparethe x-ray mass estimates to previously published sz mass estimates derived fromcosmological simulations of the spt survey. we find that the sz mass estimatesare lower by a factor of 0.89+-0.06, which is within the ~15% systematicuncertainty quoted for the simulation-based sz masses.

1012.4788	improved constraints on cosmic microwave background secondary  anisotropies from the complete 2008 south pole telescope data	we report measurements of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) powerspectrum from the complete 2008 south pole telescope (spt) data set. we analyzetwice as much data as the first spt power spectrum analysis, using an improvedcosmological parameter estimator which fits multi-frequency models to the spt150 and $220\,$ghz bandpowers. we find an excellent fit to the measuredbandpowers with a model that includes lensed primary cmb anisotropy, secondarythermal (tsz) and kinetic (ksz) sunyaev-zel'dovich anisotropies, unclusteredsynchrotron point sources, and clustered dusty point sources. in addition tomeasuring the power spectrum of dusty galaxies at high signal-to-noise, thedata primarily constrain a linear combination of the ksz and tsz anisotropycontributions at $150\,$ghz and $\ell=3000$: $d^{tsz}_{3000} +0.5\,d^{ksz}_{3000} = 4.5\pm 1.0 \,\mu{\rm k}^2$. the 95% confidence upperlimits on secondary anisotropy power are $d^{tsz}_{3000} &lt; 5.3\,\mu{\rm k}^2$and $d^{ksz}_{3000} &lt; 6.5\,\mu{\rm k}^2$. we also consider the potentialcorrelation of dusty and tsz sources, and find it incapable of relaxing the tszupper limit. these results increase the significance of the lower than expectedtsz amplitude previously determined from spt power spectrum measurements. wefind that models including non-thermal pressure support in groups and clusterspredict tsz power in better agreement with the spt data. combining the tszpower measurement with primary cmb data halves the statistical uncertainty on$\sigma_8$. however, the preferred value of $\sigma_8$ varies significantlybetween tsz models. improved constraints on cosmological parameters from tszpower spectrum measurements require continued progress in the modeling of thetsz power.

1101.1286	discovery and cosmological implications of spt-cl j2106-5844, the most  massive known cluster at z &gt; 1	using the south pole telescope (spt), we have discovered the most massiveknown galaxy cluster at z &gt; 1, spt-cl j2106-5844. in addition to producing astrong sunyaev-zel'dovich effect signal, this system is a luminous x-ray sourceand its numerous constituent galaxies display spatial and color clustering, allindicating the presence of a massive galaxy cluster. vlt and magellanspectroscopy of 18 member galaxies shows that the cluster is at z =1.132^+0.002_-0.003. chandra observations obtained through a combined hrc-acisgto program reveal an x-ray spectrum with an fe k line redshifted by z = 1.18+/- 0.03. these redshifts are consistent with galaxy colors in extensiveoptical, near-infrared, and mid-infrared imaging. spt-cl j2106-5844 displaysextreme x-ray properties for a cluster, having a core-excluded temperature ofkt = 11.0^+2.6_-1.9 kev and a luminosity (within r_500) of l_x (0.5 - 2.0 kev)= (13.9 +/- 1.0) x 10^44 erg/s. the combined mass estimate from measurements ofthe sunyaev-zel'dovich effect and x-ray data is m_200 = (1.27 +/- 0.21) x 10^15m_sun. the discovery of such a massive gravitationally collapsed system at highredshift provides an interesting laboratory for galaxy formation and evolution,and is a powerful probe of extreme perturbations of the primordial matterdensity field. we discuss the latter, determining that, under the assumption oflambdacdm cosmology with only gaussian perturbations, there is only a 7% chanceof finding a galaxy cluster similar to spt-cl j2106-5844 in the 2500 deg^2 sptsurvey region, and that only one such galaxy cluster is expected in the entiresky.

1111.0932	a measurement of secondary cosmic microwave background anisotropies with  two years of south pole telescope observations	we present the first three-frequency south pole telescope (spt) cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) power spectra. the band powers presented here coverangular scales 2000 &lt; ell &lt; 9400 in frequency bands centered at 95, 150, and220 ghz. at these frequencies and angular scales, a combination of the primarycmb anisotropy, thermal and kinetic sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effects, radiogalaxies, and cosmic infrared background (cib) contributes to the signal. wecombine planck and spt data at 220 ghz to constrain the amplitude and shape ofthe cib power spectrum and find strong evidence for non-linear clustering. weexplore the sz results using a variety of cosmological models for the cmb andcib anisotropies and find them to be robust with one exception: allowing forspatial correlations between the thermal sz effect and cib significantlydegrades the sz constraints. neglecting this potential correlation, we find thethermal sz power at 150 ghz and ell = 3000 to be 3.65 +/- 0.69 muk^2, and setan upper limit on the kinetic sz power to be less than 2.8 muk^2 at 95%confidence. when a correlation between the thermal sz and cib is allowed, weconstrain a linear combination of thermal and kinetic sz power: d_{3000}^{tsz}+ 0.5 d_{3000}^{ksz} = 4.60 +/- 0.63 muk^2, consistent with earliermeasurements. we use the measured thermal sz power and an analytic, thermal szmodel calibrated with simulations to determine sigma8 = 0.807 +/- 0.016.modeling uncertainties involving the astrophysics of the intracluster mediumrather than the statistical uncertainty in the measured band powers are thedominant source of uncertainty on sigma8 . we also place an upper limit on thekinetic sz power produced by patchy reionization; a companion paper uses theselimits to constrain the reionization history of the universe.

1112.4215	frequency multiplexed squid readout of large bolometer arrays for cosmic  microwave background measurements	a technological milestone for experiments employing transition edge sensor(tes) bolometers operating at sub-kelvin temperature is the deployment ofdetector arrays with 100s--1000s of bolometers. one key technology for sucharrays is readout multiplexing: the ability to read out many sensorssimultaneously on the same set of wires. this paper describes afrequency-domain multiplexed readout system which has been developed for anddeployed on the apex-sz and south pole telescope millimeter wavelengthreceivers. in this system, the detector array is divided into modules of sevendetectors, and each bolometer within the module is biased with a unique ~mhzsinusoidal carrier such that the individual bolometer signals are wellseparated in frequency space. the currents from all bolometers in a module aresummed together and pre-amplified with superconducting quantum interferencedevices (squids) operating at 4 k. room-temperature electronics demodulate thecarriers to recover the bolometer signals, which are digitized separately andstored to disk. this readout system contributes little noise relative to thedetectors themselves, is remarkably insensitive to unwanted microphonicexcitations, and provides a technology pathway to multiplexing larger numbersof sensors.

1205.3103	weak-lensing mass measurements of five galaxy clusters in the south pole  telescope survey using magellan/megacam	we use weak gravitational lensing to measure the masses of five galaxyclusters selected from the south pole telescope (spt) survey, with the primarygoal of comparing these with the spt sunyaev--zel'dovich (sz) and x-ray basedmass estimates. the clusters span redshifts 0.28 &lt; z &lt; 0.43 and have massesm_500 &gt; 2 x 10^14 h^-1 m_sun, and three of the five clusters were discovered bythe spt survey. we observed the clusters in the g'r'i' passbands with themegacam imager on the magellan clay 6.5m telescope. we measure a mean ratio ofweak lensing (wl) aperture masses to inferred aperture masses from the sz data,both within an aperture of r_500,sz derived from the sz mass, of 1.04 +/- 0.18.we measure a mean ratio of spherical wl masses evaluated at r_500,sz tospherical sz masses of 1.07 +/- 0.18, and a mean ratio of spherical wl massesevaluated at r_500,wl to spherical sz masses of 1.10 +/- 0.24. we explorepotential sources of systematic error in the mass comparisons and conclude thatall are subdominant to the statistical uncertainty, with dominant terms beingcluster concentration uncertainty and n-body simulation calibration bias.expanding the sample of spt clusters with wl observations has the potential tosignificantly improve the spt cluster mass calibration and the resultingcosmological constraints from the spt cluster survey. these are the first wldetections using megacam on the magellan clay telescope.

1312.3015	measurement of galaxy cluster integrated comptonization and mass scaling  relations with the south pole telescope	we describe a method for measuring the integrated comptonization (ysz) ofclusters of galaxies from measurements of the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect inmultiple frequency bands and use this method to characterize a sample of galaxyclusters detected in south pole telescope (spt) data. we test this method onsimulated cluster observations and verify that it can accurately recovercluster parameters with negligible bias. in realistic simulations of anspt-like survey, with realizations of cosmic microwave background anisotropy,point sources, and atmosphere and instrumental noise at typical spt-sz surveylevels, we find that ysz is most accurately determined in an aperturecomparable to the spt beam size. we demonstrate the utility of this method tomeasure ysz and to constrain mass scaling relations using x-ray mass estimatesfor a sample of 18 galaxy clusters from the spt-sz survey. measuring ysz withina 0.75' radius aperture, we find an intrinsic log-normal scatter of 21+/-11% inysz at a fixed mass. measuring ysz within a 0.3 mpc projected radius(equivalent to 0.75' at the survey median redshift z = 0.6), we find a scatterof 26+/-9%. prior to this study, the spt observable found to have the lowestscatter with mass was cluster detection significance. we demonstrate, from bothsimulations and spt observed clusters, that ysz measured within an aperturecomparable to the spt beam size is equivalent, in terms of scatter with clustermass, to spt cluster detection significance.

1404.6250	the redshift evolution of the mean temperature, pressure, and entropy  profiles in 80 spt-selected galaxy clusters	(abridged) we present the results of an x-ray analysis of 80 galaxy clustersselected in the 2500 deg^2 south pole telescope survey and observed with thechandra x-ray observatory. we divide the full sample into subsamples of ~20clusters based on redshift and central density, performing an x-ray fit to allclusters in a subsample simultaneously, assuming self-similarity of thetemperature profile. this approach allows us to constrain the shape of thetemperature profile over 0&lt;r&lt;1.5r500, which would be impossible on aper-cluster basis, since the observations of individual clusters have, onaverage, 2000 x-ray counts. the results presented here represent the firstconstraints on the evolution of the average temperature profile from z=0 toz=1.2. we find that high-z (0.6&lt;z&lt;1.2) clusters are slightly (~40%) cooler bothin the inner (r&lt;0.1r500) and outer (r&gt;r500) regions than their low-z(0.3&lt;z&lt;0.6) counterparts. combining the average temperature profile withmeasured gas density profiles from our earlier work, we infer the averagepressure and entropy profiles for each subsample. overall, our observedpressure profiles agree well with earlier lower-redshift measurements,suggesting minimal redshift evolution in the pressure profile outside of thecore. we find no measurable redshift evolution in the entropy profile atr&lt;0.7r500. we observe a slight flattening of the entropy profile at r&gt;r500 inour high-z subsample. this flattening is consistent with a temperature bias dueto the enhanced (~3x) rate at which group-mass (~2 kev) halos, which would goundetected at our survey depth, are accreting onto the cluster at z~1. thiswork demonstrates a powerful method for inferring spatially-resolved clusterproperties in the case where individual cluster signal-to-noise is low, but thenumber of observed clusters is high.

1412.7521	a measurement of gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave  background by galaxy clusters using data from the south pole telescope	clusters of galaxies are expected to gravitationally lens the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) and thereby generate a distinct signal in the cmb onarcminute scales. measurements of this effect can be used to constrain themasses of galaxy clusters with cmb data alone. here we present a measurement oflensing of the cmb by galaxy clusters using data from the south pole telescope(spt). we develop a maximum likelihood approach to extract the cmb clusterlensing signal and validate the method on mock data. we quantify the effects onour analysis of several potential sources of systematic error and find thatthey generally act to reduce the best-fit cluster mass. it is estimated thatthis bias to lower cluster mass is roughly $0.85\sigma$ in units of thestatistical error bar, although this estimate should be viewed as an upperlimit. we apply our maximum likelihood technique to 513 clusters selected viatheir sz signatures in spt data, and rule out the null hypothesis of no lensingat $3.1\sigma$. the lensing-derived mass estimate for the full cluster sampleis consistent with that inferred from the sz flux: $m_{200,\mathrm{lens}} =0.83_{-0.37}^{+0.38}\, m_{200,\mathrm{sz}}$ (68% c.l., statistical error only).
