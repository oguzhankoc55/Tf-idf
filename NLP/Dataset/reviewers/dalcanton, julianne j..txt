0901.2361	the true durations of starbursts: hst observations of three nearby dwarf  starburst galaxies	the duration of a starburst is a fundamental parameter affecting theevolution of galaxies yet, to date, observational constraints on the durationsof starbursts are not well established. here we study the recent star formationhistories (sfhs) of three nearby dwarf galaxies to rigorously quantify theduration of their starburst events using a uniform and consistent approach. wefind that the bursts range from ~200 - ~400 myr in duration resolving thetension between the shorter timescales often derived observationally with thelonger timescales derived from dynamical arguments. if these three starburstsare typical of starbursts in dwarf galaxies, then the short timescales (3 - 10myr) associated with starbursts in previous studies are best understood as"flickering" events which are simply small components of the larger starburst.in this sample of three nearby dwarfs, the bursts are not localized events. allthree systems show bursting levels of star formation in regions of both highand low stellar density. the enhanced star formation moves around the galaxyduring the bursts and covers a large fraction of the area of the galaxy. thesemassive, long duration bursts can significantly affect the structure, dynamics,and chemical evolution of the host galaxy and can be the progenitors of"superwinds" that drive much of the recently chemically enriched material fromthe galaxy into the intergalactic medium.

0902.3460	the detection of inside-out disk growth in m33	we present resolved stellar photometry of 4 fields along the major axis ofthe m33 disk from images taken with the advanced camera for surveys aboard thehubble space telescope. the photometry provides a detailed census of the redclump in all fields and reaches the ancient main sequence in the outermostfield. through detailed modeling of the color-magnitude diagrams, we find thatthe percentage of the stellar mass formed prior to z=1 changes from 71 +/- 9%in the innermost field to 16 +/- 6% in the outermost field. the disk shows aclear trend of increasing scale-length with time, evolving from 1.0 +/- 0.1 kpc10 gyr ago to 1.8 +/- 0.1 kpc at times more recent than 5 gyr ago, in agreementwith analytical predictions for disk growth. beyond the disk truncation radius,however, the stellar density profile steepens with time and the age gradientreverses, in agreement with recent simulations. the late and slow growth of thestellar disk may be due in part to the low mass of m33.

0902.4080	frequency and properties of bars in cluster and field galaxies at  intermediate redshifts	we present a study of large-scale bars in field and cluster environments outto redshifts of ~0.8 using a final sample of 945 moderately inclined diskgalaxies drawn from the ediscs project. we characterize bars and their hostgalaxies and look for relations between the presence of a bar and theproperties of the underlying disk. we investigate whether the fraction andproperties of bars in clusters are different from their counterparts in thefield. the total optical bar fraction in the redshift range z=0.4-0.8 (medianz=0.60), averaged over the entire sample, is 25% (20% for strong bars). for thecluster and field subsamples, we measure bar fractions of 24% and 29%,respectively. we find that bars in clusters are on average longer than in thefield and preferentially found close to the cluster center, where the barfraction is somewhat higher (~31%) than at larger distances (~18%). thesefindings however rely on a relatively small subsample and might be affected bysmall number statistics. in agreement with local studies, we find thatdisk-dominated galaxies have a higher optical bar fraction (~45%) thanbulge-dominated galaxies (~15%). this result is based on hubble types andeffective radii and does not change with redshift. the latter finding impliesthat bar formation or dissolution is strongly connected to the emergence of themorphological structure of a disk and is typically accompanied by a transitionin the hubble type.

0905.3737	the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury	the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury (angst) is a systematic survey toestablish a legacy of uniform multi-color photometry of resolved stars for avolume-limited sample of nearby galaxies (d&lt;4 mpc). the survey volumeencompasses 69 galaxies in diverse environments, including close pairs, small &amp;large groups, filaments, and truly isolated regions. the galaxies include anearly complete range of morphological types spanning a factor of ~10^4 inluminosity and star formation rate. the survey data consists of images takenwith acs on hst, supplemented with archival data and new wfpc2 imaging takenafter the failure of acs. survey images include wide field tilings covering thefull radial extent of each galaxy, and single deep pointings in uncrowdedregions of the most massive galaxies in the volume. the new wide field imagingin angst reaches median 50% completenesses of m_f475w=28.0 mag, m_f606w=27.3mag, and m_f814w=27.3 mag, several magnitudes below the tip of the red giantbranch (trgb). the deep fields reach magnitudes sufficient to fully resolve thestructure in the red clump. the resulting photometric catalogs are publiclyaccessible and contain over 34 million photometric measurements of &gt;14 millionstars. in this paper we present the details of the sample selection, imaging,data reduction, and the resulting photometric catalogs, along with an analysisof the photometric uncertainties (systematic and random), for both the acs andwfpc2 imaging. we also present uniformly derived relative distances measuredfrom the apparent magnitude of the trgb.

0907.0710	the ngc 300 transient: an alternative method for measuring progenitor  masses	we present an alternative technique for measuring the precursor masses oftransient events in stars undergoing late stage stellar evolution. we use thewell-established techniques of stellar population modeling to age-date thestars surrounding the site of the recent transient event in ngc 300 (ngc 300ot2008-1). the surrounding stars must share a common turnoff mass with thetransient, since almost all stars form in stellar clusters that remainphysically associated for periods longer than the lifetime of the most massivestars. we find that the precursor of ngc 300 ot2008-1 is surrounded by starsthat formed in a single burst between 8-13 myr ago, with 70% confidence. thetransient was therefore likely to be due to a progenitor whose mass fallsbetween the main sequence turnoff mass (12 msun) and the maximum stellar mass(25 msun) found for isochrones bounding this age range. we characterize thegeneral applicability of this technique in identifying precursor masses ofhistoric and future transients and supernovae (sne), noting that it requiresneither precursor imaging nor sub-arcsecond accuracy in the position of thetransient. it is also based on the well-understood physics of the mainsequence, and thus may be a more reliable source of precursor masses thanfitting evolutionary tracks to precursor magnitudes. we speculate that if theprogenitor mass is close to 17 msun, there may be a connection between opticaltransients such as ngc 300 ot2008-1 and the missing type ii-p sne, known as the"red supergiant problem."

0910.1612	evolution of the early-type galaxy fraction in clusters since z = 0.8	we study the morphological content of a large sample of high-redshiftclusters to determine its dependence on cluster mass and redshift. quantitativemorphologies are based on bulge+disk decompositions of cluster and fieldgalaxies on deep vlt/fors2 images of 18 optically-selected clusters at 0.45 &lt; z&lt; 0.80 from the eso distant cluster survey (ediscs). morphological content isgiven by the early-type galaxy fraction f_et, and early-type galaxies areselected based on their bulge fraction and image smoothness. a set of 158 sdssclusters is analyzed exactly as the ediscs sample to provide a robust localcomparison. our main results are: (1) f_et values for the sdss and ediscsclusters exhibit no clear trend as a function of sigma. (2) mid-z ediscsclusters around sigma = 500 km/s have f_et ~= 0.5 whereas high-z ediscsclusters have f_et ~= 0.4 (~25% increase over 2 gyrs). (3) there is a markeddifference in the morphological content of ediscs and sdss clusters. none ofthe ediscs clusters have f_et greater than 0.6 whereas half of the sdssclusters lie above this value. this difference is seen in clusters of allvelocity dispersions. (4) there is a strong correlation between morphology andstar formation in sdss and ediscs clusters. this correlation holds independentof sigma and z even though the fraction of [oii] emitters decreases from z~0.8to z~0.06 in all environments. our results pose an interesting challenge tostructural transformation and star formation quenching processes that stronglydepend on the global cluster environment and suggest that cluster membershipmay be of lesser importance than other variables in determining galaxyproperties.

0910.4965	hi selected galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey i: optical data	we present the optical data for 195 hi-selected galaxies that fall withinboth the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and the parkes equatorial survey (es).the photometric quantities have been independently recomputed for our sampleusing a new photometric pipeline optimized for large galaxies, thus correctingfor sdss's limited reliability for automatic photometry of angularly large orlow surface brightness (lsb) galaxies. we outline the magnitude of theuncertainty in the sdss catalog-level photometry and derive a quantitativemethod for correcting the over-sky subtraction in the sdss photometricpipeline. the main thrust of this paper is to present the es/sdss sample anddiscuss the methods behind the improved photometry, which will be used infuture scientific analysis. we present the overall optical properties of thesample and briefly compare to a volume-limited, optically-selected sample.compared to the optically-selected sdss sample (in the similar volume),hi-selected galaxies are bluer and more luminous (fewer dwarf ellipticals andmore star formation). however, compared to typical sdss galaxy studies, whichhave their own selection effects, our sample is bluer, fainter and lessmassive.

0910.4966	hi selected galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey ii: the colors of  gas-rich galaxies	we utilize color information for an hi-selected sample of 195 galaxies toexplore the star formation histories and physical conditions that produce theobserved colors. we show that the hi selection creates a significant offsettowards bluer colors that can be explained by enhanced recent bursts of starformation. there is also no obvious color bimodality, because the hi selectionrestricts the sample to bluer, actively star forming systems, diminishing theimportance of the red sequence. rising star formation rates are still requiredto explain the colors of galaxies bluer than g-r &lt; 0.3. we also demonstratethat the colors of the bluest galaxies in our sample are dominated by emissionlines and that stellar population synthesis models alone (without emissionlines) are not adequate for reproducing many of the galaxy colors. theseemission lines produce large changes in the r-i colors but leave the g-r colorlargely unchanged. in addition, we find an increase in the dispersion of galaxycolors at low masses that may be the result of a change in the star formationprocess in low-mass galaxies.

0911.4121	the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury iv. the star formation history of  ngc 2976	we present resolved stellar photometry of ngc 2976 obtained with the advancedcamera for surveys (acs) as part of the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury(angst) program. the data cover the radial extent of the major axis of the diskout to 6 kpc, or ~6 scale lengths. the outer disk was imaged to a depth ofm_f606w ~ 1, and an inner field was imaged to the crowding limit at a depth ofm_f606w ~ -1. through detailed analysis and modeling of these cmds we havereconstructed the star formation history of the stellar populations currentlyresiding in these portions of the galaxy, finding similar ancient populationsat all radii but significantly different young populations at increasing radii.in particular, outside of the well-measured break in the disk surfacebrightness profile, the age of the youngest population increases with distancefrom the galaxy center, suggesting that star formation is shutting down fromthe outside-in. we use our measured star formation history, along with h isurface density measurements, to reconstruct the surface density profile of thedisk during previous epochs. comparisons between the recovered star formationrates and reconstructed gas densities at previous epochs are consistent withstar formation following the schmidt law during the past 0.5 gyrs, but with adrop in star formation efficiency at low gas densities, as seen in localgalaxies at the present day. the current rate and gas density suggest thatrapid star formation in ngc 2976 is currently in the process of ceasing fromthe outside-in due to gas depletion. this process of outer disk gas depletionand inner disk star formation was likely triggered by an interaction with thecore of the m81 group &gt;~1 gyr ago that stripped the gas from the galaxy haloand/or triggered gas inflow from the outer disk toward the galaxy center.

1002.1743	the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury v. radial star formation history  of ngc 300	we present new hubble space telescope (hst) observations of ngc 300 taken aspart of the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury (angst). individual stars areresolved in these images down to an absolute magnitude of m_f814w = 1.0 (belowthe red clump). we determine the star formation history of the galaxy in 6radial bins by comparing our observed color-magnitude diagrams (cmds) withsynthetic cmds based on theoretical isochrones. we find that the stellar diskout to 5.4 kpc is primarily old, in contrast with the outwardly similar galaxym33. we determine the scale length as a function of age and find evidence forinside-out growth of the stellar disk: the scale length has increased from 1.1+/- 0.1 kpc 10 gyr ago to 1.3 +/- 0.1 kpc at present, indicating a buildup inthe fraction of young stars at larger radii. as the scale length of m33 hasrecently been shown to have increased much more dramatically with time, ourresults demonstrate that two galaxies with similar sizes and morphologies canhave very different histories. with an n-body simulation of a galaxy designedto be similar to ngc 300, we determine that the effects of radial migrationshould be minimal. we trace the metallicity gradient as a function of time andfind a present day metallicity gradient consistent with that seen in previousstudies. consistent results are obtained from archival images covering the sameradial extent but differing in placement and filter combination.

1006.1659	misaligned angular momentum in hydrodynamic cosmological simulations:  warps, outer discs, and thick discs	we present a detailed analysis of a disc galaxy forming in a high-resolutionfully cosmological simulation to investigate the nature of the outer regions ofdiscs and their relevance for the disc formation process. specifically, wefocus on the phenomenon of misaligned disc components and find that the outerdisc warp is a consequence of the misalignment between the inner disc and thesurrounding hot gaseous halo. as the infalling cold gas sinks toward the centreof the galaxy, it is strongly torqued by the hot gas halo. by the time thefresh gas reaches the central disc-forming region its angular momentum iscompletely aligned with the spin of the hot gas halo. if the spin of the hotgas halo, in turn, is not aligned with that of the inner disc, a misalignedouter disc forms comprised of newly accreted material. the inner and outercomponents are misaligned with each other because they respond differently toinfalling substructure and accretion. the warped disc feeds the main gas discdue to viscous angular momentum losses, but small amounts of star formation inthe warp itself form a low-metallicity thick disc. we show that observations ofresolved stellar populations in warped galaxies in the local universe couldprovide evidence for the presence of these processes and therefore indirectlyreveal ongoing gas accretion and the existence of hot gas halos.

1009.4618	the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury ix. constraining asymptotic giant  branch evolution with old metal-poor galaxies	in an attempt to constrain evolutionary models of the asymptotic giant branch(agb) phase at the limit of low masses and low metallicities, we have examinedthe luminosity functions and number ratio between agb and red giant branch(rgb) stars from a sample of resolved galaxies from the acs nearby galaxysurvey treasury (angst). this database provides hst optical photometry togetherwith maps of completeness, photometric errors, and star formation histories fordozens of galaxies within 4 mpc. we select 12 galaxies characterized bypredominantly metal-poor populations as indicated by a very steep and blue rgb,and which do not present any indication of recent star formation in theircolor--magnitude diagrams. thousands of agb stars brighter than the tip of thergb (trgb) are present in the sample (between 60 and 400 per galaxy), hence thepoisson noise has little impact in our measurements of the agb/rgb ratio. wemodel the photometric data with a few sets of thermally pulsing agb (tp-agb)evolutionary models with different prescriptions for the mass loss. thistechnique allows us to set stringent constraints to the tp-agb models oflow-mass metal-poor stars (with m&lt;1.5 msun, [fe/h]&lt;~-1.0). indeed, those whichsatisfactorily reproduce the observed agb/rgb ratios have tp-agb lifetimesbetween 1.2 and 1.8 myr, and finish their nuclear burning lives with massesbetween 0.51 and 0.55 msun. this is also in good agreement with recentobservations of white dwarf masses in the m4 old globular cluster. theseconstraints can be added to those already derived from magellanic cloud starclusters as important mileposts in the arduous process of calibrating agbevolutionary models.

1101.1093	the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury viii. the global star formation  histories of 60 dwarf galaxies in the local volume	we present uniformly measured star formation histories (sfhs) of 60 nearby(d~4mpc) dwarf galaxies based on cmds of resolved stellar populations fromimages taken with hst as part of the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury program(angst). this volume-limited sample contains 12 dsph/de, 5 dwarf spiral, 28 di,12 transition, and 3 tidal dwarf galaxies. from the best fit sfhs we find threesignificant results: (1) the average dwarf galaxy formed &gt;50% of its stars byz~2 and 60% of its stars by z~1, regardless of current morphological type; (2)the mean sfhs of dis, dtrans, and dsphs are similar over most of cosmic time,with the clearest differences appearing during the most recent 1 gyr; and (3)the mean values are inconsistent with simple sfh models, e.g., exponentiallydeclining sfrs. the mean sfhs are in general agreement with the cosmic sfh,although we observe offsets near z~1 that could be evidence that low masssystems experienced delayed star formation relative to more massive galaxies.the sample shows a strong density-morphology relationship, such that the dsphsare less isolated than dis. we find that the transition from a gas-rich togas-poor galaxy cannot be solely due to internal mechanisms such as stellarfeedback, and instead is likely the result of external mechanisms, e.g., rampressure and tidal forces. the average transition dwarf is slightly lessisolated and less gas-rich than the typical di. further, the transition dwarfscan be divided into two groups: interacting and gas-poor or isolated andgas-rich, suggesting two possible evolutionary pathways.

1104.0981	a deep chandra view of the ngc 404 central engine	we present the results of a 100 ks {\it chandra} observation of the ngc 404nuclear region. the long exposure and excellent spatial resolution of {\itchandra} has enabled us to critically examine the nuclear environment of ngc404, which is known to host a nuclear star cluster and potentially anintermediate-mass black hole (on the order of a few times $10^5$ \msun). wefind two distinct x-ray sources: a hard, central point source coincident withthe optical and radio centers of the galaxy, and a soft extended region that iscoincident with areas of high h$\alpha$ emission and likely recent starformation. when we fit the 0.3-8 kev spectra of each region separately, we findthe hard nuclear point source to be dominated by a power law (\pl = 1.88),while the soft off-nuclear region is best fit by a thermal plasma model ($kt$ =0.67 kev). we therefore find evidence for both a power law component and hotgas in the nuclear region of ngc 404. we estimate the 2-10 kev luminosity to be1.3$^{+0.8}_{-0.5}\times10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$. a low-level of diffuse x-rayemission is detected out to $\sim$15\as ($\sim$0.2 kpc) from the nucleus. wecompare our results to the observed relationships between power law photonindex and eddington ratio for both x-ray binaries and low luminosity activegalaxies and find ngc 404 to be consistent with other low luminosity activegalaxies. we therefore favor the conclusion that ngc 404 harbors anintermediate-mass black hole accreting at a very low level.

1105.2571	the history of star formation in galaxy disks in the local volume as  measured by the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury	we present a measurement of the age distribution of stars residing in spiraldisks and dwarf galaxies. we derive a complete star formation history of the~140 mpc^3 covered by the volume-limited sample of galaxies in the advancedcamera for surveys (acs) nearby galaxy survey treasury (angst). the total starformation rate density history is dominated by the large spirals in the volume,although the sample consists mainly of dwarf galaxies. our measurement shows afactor of ~3 drop at z~2, in approximate agreement with results from othermeasurement techniques. while our results show that the overall star formationrate density has decreased since z~1, the measured rates during this epoch arehigher than those obtained from other measurement techniques. this enhancedrecent star formation rate appears to be largely due to an increase in thefraction of star formation contained in low-mass disks at recent times.finally, our results indicate that despite the differences at recent times, theepoch of formation of ~50% of the stellar mass in dwarf galaxies was similar tothat of ~50% of the stellar mass in large spiral galaxies (z&gt;~2), despite theobserved galaxy-to-galaxy diversity among the dwarfs.

1105.4117	the formation of kiloparsec-scale hi holes in dwarf galaxies	the origin of kpc-scale holes in the atomic hydrogen (h i) distributions ofsome nearby dwarf irregular galaxies presents an intriguing problem. starformation histories (sfhs) derived from resolved stars give us the uniqueopportunity to study past star forming events that may have helped shape thecurrently visible h i distribution. our sample of five nearby dwarf irregulargalaxies spans over an order of magnitude in both total h i mass and absoluteb-band magnitude and is at the low mass end of previously studied systems. weuse very large array h i line data to estimate the energy required to createthe centrally dominant hole in each galaxy. we compare this energy estimate tothe past energy released by the underlying stellar populations computed fromsfhs derived from data taken with the hubble space telescope. the inferredintegrated stellar energy released within the characteristic ages exceeds ourenergy estimates for creating the holes in all cases, assuming expectedefficiencies. therefore, it appears that stellar feedback provides sufficientenergy to produce the observed holes. however, we find no obvious signature ofsingle star forming events responsible for the observed structures whencomparing the global sfhs of each galaxy in our sample to each other or tothose of dwarf irregular galaxies reported in the literature. we also fail tofind evidence of a central star cluster in fuv or halpha imaging. we concludethat large h i holes are likely formed from multiple generations of starformation and only under suitable interstellar medium conditions.

1107.6046	the progenitor mass of sn 2011dh from stellar populations analysis	using hubble space telescope (hst) photometry, we characterize the age of thestellar association in the vicinity of supernova (sn) 2011dh and use it toinfer the zero-age main sequence mass (m_{zams}) of the progenitor star. wefind two distinct and significant star formation events with ages of &lt;6 and17^{+3}_{-4} myrs, and the corresponding m_{zams} are &gt;29 and 13^{+2}_{-1}m_{sun}, respectively. these two bursts represent 18^{+4}_{-9}% (young) and64^{+10}_{-14}% (old) of the total star formation in the last 50 myrs. adoptingthese fractions as probabilities suggests that the most probable m_{zams} is13^{+2}_{-1} m_{sun}. these results are most sensitive to the luminosityfunction along the well-understood main sequence and are less sensitive touncertain late-stage stellar evolution. therefore, they stand even if theprogenitor suffered disruptive post-main-sequence evolution (e.g. eruptive massloss or binary roche-lobe overflow). progenitor identification will help tofurther constrain the appropriate population. even though pre-explosion imagesshow a yellow supergiant (ysg) at the site of the sn, panchromatic sn lightcurves suggest a more compact star as the progenitor. in spite of this, ourresults suggest an association between the ysg and the sn. not only was thestar located at the sn site, but reinforcing an association, the star'sbolometric luminosity is consistent with the final evolutionary stage of the 17myr old star burst. if the ysg disappears, then m_{zams}=13^{+2}_{-1} m_{sun},but if it persists, then our results allow the possibility that the progenitorwas an unseen star of &gt;29 m_{sun}.

1108.1405	observational constraints on red and blue helium burning sequences	we derive the optical luminosity, colors, and ratios of the blue and redhelium burning (heb) stellar populations from archival hubble space telescopeobservations of nineteen starburst dwarf galaxies and compare them withtheoretical isochrones from padova stellar evolution models acrossmetallicities from z=0.001 to 0.009. we find that the observational data andthe theoretical isochrones for both blue and red heb populations overlap inoptical luminosities and colors and the observed and predicted blue to red hebratios agree for stars older than 50 myr over the time bins studied. thesefindings confirm the usefulness of applying isochrones to interpretobservations of heb populations. however, there are significant differences,especially for the red heb population. specifically we find: (1) offsets incolor between the observations and theoretical isochrones of order 0.15 mag(0.5 mag) for the blue (red) heb populations brighter than m_v ~ -4 mag, whichcannot be solely due to differential extinction; (2) blue heb stars fainterthan m_v ~ -3 mag are bluer than predicted; (3) the slope of the red hebsequence is shallower than predicted by a factor of ~3; and (4) the modelsoverpredict the ratio of the most luminous blue to red heb stars correspondingto ages &lt;50 myr. additionally, we find that for the more metal-rich galaxies inour sample (z&gt; 0.5 zsolar) the red heb stars overlap with the red giant branchstars in the color magnitude diagrams, thus reducing their usefulness asindicators of star formation for ages &gt;100 myr.

1109.2905	modeling the effects of star formation histories on halpha and  ultra-violet fluxes in nearby dwarf galaxies	we consider the effects of non-constant star formation histories (sfhs) onhalpha and galex far ultra-violet (fuv) star formation rate (sfr) indicators.under the assumption of a fully populated chabrier imf, we compare thedistribution of halpha-to-fuv flux ratios from ~ 1500 simple, periodic modelsfhs with observations of 185 galaxies from the spitzer local volume legacysurvey. we find a set of sfh models that are well matched to the data, suchthat more massive galaxies are best characterized by nearly constant sfhs,while low mass systems experience bursts amplitudes of ~ 30 (i.e., an increasein the sfr by a factor of 30 over the sfr during the inter-burst period), burstdurations of tens of myr, and periods of ~ 250 myr; these sfhs are broadlyconsistent with the increased stochastic star formation expected in systemswith lower sfrs. we analyze the predicted temporal evolution of galaxy stellarmass, r-band surface brightness, halpha-derived sfr, and blue luminosity, andfind that they provide a reasonable match to observed flux distributions. wefind that our model sfhs are generally able to reproduce both the observedsystematic decline and increased scatter in halpha-to-fuv ratios toward lowmass systems, without invoking other physical mechanisms. we also compare ourpredictions with those from the integrated galactic imf theory with a constantsfr. we find that while both predict a systematic decline in the observedratios, only the time variable sfh models are capable of producing the observedpopulation of low mass galaxies ($m_{*}$ &lt; 10$^{7}$ msun) with normalhalpha-to-fuv ratios. these results demonstrate that a variable imf alone hasdifficulty explaining the observed scatter in the halpha-to-fuv ratios. weconclude by considering the limitations of the model sfhs, and discuss the useof additional empirical constraints to improve future sfh modeling efforts.

1201.4859	the star formation history of leo t from hubble space telescope imaging	we present the star formation history (sfh) of the faintest knownstar-forming galaxy, leo t, based on imaging taken with the hubble spacetelescope (hst) wide field planetary camera 2 (wfpc2). the hst/wfpc2color-magnitude diagram (cmd) of leo t is exquisitely deep, extending ~ 2magnitudes below the oldest main sequence turnoff, permitting excellentconstraints on star formation at all ages. we use a maximum likelihood cmdfitting technique to measure the sfh of leo t assuming three different sets ofstellar evolution models: padova (solar-scaled metallicity) and basti (bothsolar-scaled and alpha-enhanced metallicities). the resulting sfhs areremarkably consistent at all ages, indicating that our derived sfh is robust tothe choice of stellar evolution model. from the lifetime sfh of leo t, we findthat 50% of the total stellar mass formed prior to z ~ 1 (7.6 gyr ago).subsequent to this epoch, the sfh of leo t is roughly constant until the mostrecent ~ 25 myr, where the sfh shows an abrupt drop. this decrease could be dueto a cessation of star formation or stellar initial mass function samplingeffects, but we are unable to distinguish between the two scenarios. overall,our measured sfh is consistent with previously derived sfhs of leo t. however,the hst-based solution provides improved age resolution and reduceduncertainties at all epochs. the sfh, baryonic gas fraction, and location ofleo t are unlike any of the other recently discovered faint dwarf galaxies inthe local group, and instead bear strong resemblance to gas-rich dwarf galaxies(irregular or transition), suggesting that gas-rich dwarf galaxies may sharecommon modes of star formation over a large range of stellar mass (~ 10^5-10^9msun).

1202.4783	the contribution of tp-agb and rheb stars to the near-ir luminosity of  local galaxies: implications for stellar mass measurements of high redshift  galaxies	using high spatial resolution hst wfc3 and acs imaging of resolved stellarpopulations, we constrain the contribution of thermally-pulsing asymptoticgiant branch (tp-agb) stars and red helium burning (rheb) stars to the 1.6 umnear-infrared (nir) luminosities of 23 nearby galaxies. the tp-agb phasecontributes as much as 17% of the integrated f160w flux, even when the redgiant branch is well populated. the rheb population contribution can match oreven exceed the tp-agb contribution, providing as much as 21% of the integratedf160w light. the nir mass-to-light (m/l) ratio should therefore be expected tovary significantly due to fluctuations in the star formation rate overtimescales from 25 myr to several gyr. we compare our observational results topredictions based on optically derived star formation histories and stellarpopulation synthesis (sps) models, including models based on the padovaisochrones (used in popular sps programs). the sps models generally reproducethe expected numbers of tp-agb stars in the sample. the same sps models,however, give a larger discrepancy in the f160w flux contribution from thetp-agb stars, over-predicting the flux by a weighted mean factor of 2.3 +/-0.8.this larger offset is driven by the prediction of modest numbers of highluminosity tp-agb stars at young (&lt;300 myrs) ages. the best-fit sps modelssimultaneously tend to under-predict the numbers and fluxes of stars on therheb sequence, typically by a factor of 2.0+/-0.6 for galaxies with significantnumbers of rhebs. coincidentally, over-prediction of the tp-agb andunder-prediction of the rhebs result in a nir m/l ratio largely unchanged for arapid star formation rate. however, the nir-to-optical flux ratio of galaxiescould be significantly smaller than agb-rich models would predict, an outcomethat has been observed in some intermediate redshift post-starburst galaxies.(abridged)

1203.4826	the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury. x. quantifying the star cluster  formation efficiency of nearby dwarf galaxies	we study the relationship between the field star formation and clusterformation properties in a large sample of nearby dwarf galaxies. we use opticaldata from the hubble space telescope and from ground-based telescopes to derivethe ages and masses of the young (t_age &lt; 100myr) cluster sample. our dataprovides the first constraints on two proposed relationships between the starformation rate of galaxies and the properties of their cluster systems in thelow star formation rate regime. the data show broad agreement with theserelationships, but significant galaxy-to-galaxy scatter exists. in part, thisscatter can be accounted for by simulating the small number of clustersdetected from stochastically sampling the cluster mass function. however, thisstochasticity does not fully account for the observed scatter in our datasuggesting there may be true variations in the fraction of stars formed inclusters in dwarf galaxies. comparison of the cluster formation and thebrightest cluster in our sample galaxies also provide constraints on clusterdestruction models.

1204.4455	the splash survey: kinematics of andromeda's inner spheroid	the combination of large size, high stellar density, high metallicity, andsersic surface brightness profile of the spheroidal component of the andromedagalaxy (m31) within r_proj ~ 20 kpc suggest that it is unlike any subcomponentof the milky way. in this work we capitalize on our proximity to and externalview of m31 to probe the kinematical properties of this "inner spheroid." weemploy a markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) analysis of resolved stellarkinematics from keck/deimos spectra of 5651 red giant branch stars todisentangle m31's inner spheroid from its stellar disk. we measure the meanvelocity and dispersion of the spheroid in each of five spatial bins afteraccounting for a locally cold stellar disk as well as the giant southern streamand associated tidal debris. for the first time, we detect significant spheroidrotation (v_rot ~ 50 km/s) beyond r_proj ~ 5 kpc. the velocity dispersiondecreases from about 140 km/s at r_proj = 7 kpc to 120 km/s at r_proj = 14 kpc,consistent to 2 sigma with existing measurements and models. we calculate theprobability that a given star is a member of the spheroid and find that thespheroid has a significant presence throughout the spatial extent of oursample. lastly, we show that the flattening of the spheroid is due to velocityanisotropy in addition to rotation. though this suggests that the innerspheroid of m31 more closely resembles an elliptical galaxy than a typicalspiral galaxy bulge, it should be cautioned that our measurements are muchfarther out (2 - 14 r_eff) than for the comparison samples.

1205.2732	observational constraints on the molecular gas content in nearby  starburst dwarf galaxies	using star formation histories derived from optically resolved stellarpopulations in nineteen nearby starburst dwarf galaxies observed with thehubble space telescope, we measure the stellar mass surface densities of starsnewly formed in the bursts. by assuming a star formation efficiency (sfe), wethen calculate the inferred gas surface densities present at the onset of thestarbursts. assuming a sfe of 1%, as is often assumed in normal star-forminggalaxies, and assuming that the gas was purely atomic, translates to very highhi surface densities (~10^2-10^3 msun pc^-2), which are much higher than havebeen observed in dwarf galaxies. this implies either higher values of sfe inthese dwarf starburst galaxies or the presence of significant amounts of h_2 indwarfs (or both). raising the assumed sfes to 10% or greater (in line withobservations of more massive starbursts associated with merging galaxies),still results in hi surface densities higher than observed in 10 galaxies.thus, these observations appear to require that a significant fraction of thegas in these dwarf starbursts galaxies was in the molecular form at the onsetof the bursts. our results imply molecular gas column densities in the range10^19-10^21 cm^-2 for the sample. in those galaxies where co observations havebeen made, these densities correspond to values of the co-h_2 conversion factor(x_co) in the range &gt;3-80x10^20 cm^-2 (k km s^-1)^-1, or up to 40x greater thangalactic x_co values.

1206.4045	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury i: bright uv stars in the  bulge of m31	as part of the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury (phat) multi-cycleprogram, we observed a 12' \times 6.5' area of the bulge of m31 with thewfc3/uvis filters f275w and f336w. from these data we have assembled a sampleof \sim4000 uv-bright, old stars, vastly larger than previously available. weuse updated padova stellar evolutionary tracks to classify these hot stars intothree classes: post-agb stars (p-agb), post-early agb (pe-agb) stars andagb-manqu\'e stars. p-agb stars are the end result of the asymptotic giantbranch (agb) phase and are expected in a wide range of stellar populations,whereas pe-agb and agb-manqu\'e (together referred to as the hotpost-horizontal branch; hp-hb) stars are the result of insufficient envelopemasses to allow a full agb phase, and are expected to be particularly prominentat high helium or {\alpha} abundances when the mass loss on the rgb is high.our data support previous claims that most uv-bright sources in the bulge arelikely hot (extreme) horizontal branch stars (ehb) and their progeny. weconstruct the first radial profiles of these stellar populations, and show thatthey are highly centrally concentrated, even more so than the integrated uv oroptical light. however, we find that this uv-bright population does notdominate the total uv luminosity at any radius, as we are detecting only theprogeny of the ehb stars that are the likely source of the uvx. we calculatethat only a few percent of ms stars in the central bulge can have gone throughthe hp-hb phase and that this percentage decreases strongly with distance fromthe center. we also find that the surface density of hot uv-bright stars hasthe same radial variation as that of low-mass x-ray binaries. we discuss age,metallicity, and abundance variations as possible explanations for the observedradial variation in the uv-bright population.

1209.2416	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury ii. tracing the inner m31  halo with blue horizontal branch stars	we attempt to constrain the shape of m31's inner stellar halo by tracing thesurface density of blue horizontal branch (bhb) stars at galactocentricdistances ranging from 2 kpc to 35 kpc. our measurements make use of resolvedstellar photometry from a section of the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury(phat) survey, supplemented by several archival hubble space telescopeobservations. we find that the ratio of bhb to red giant stars is relativelyconstant outside of 10 kpc, suggesting that the bhb is as reliable a tracer ofthe halo population as the red giant branch. in the inner halo, we do notexpect bhb stars to be produced by the high metallicity bulge and disk, makingbhb stars a good candidate to be a reliable tracer of the stellar halo to muchsmaller galactocentric distances. if we assume a power-law profile r^(-\alpha)for the 2-d projected surface density bhb distribution, we obtain ahigh-quality fit with a 2-d power-law index of \alpha=2.6^{+0.3}_{-0.2} outsideof 3 kpc, which flattens to \alpha&lt;1.2 inside of 3 kpc. this slope isconsistent with previous measurements but is anchored to a radial baseline thatextends much farther inward. finally, assuming azimuthal symmetry and aconstant mass-to-light ratio, the best-fitting profile yields a total halostellar mass of 2.1^{+1.7}_{-0.4} x 10^9 m_sun. these properties are comparablewith both simulations of stellar halo formation formed by satellite disruptionalone, and with simulations that include some in situ formation of halo stars.

1209.5395	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury iii. measuring ages and  masses of partially resolved stellar clusters	the apparent age and mass of a stellar cluster can be strongly affected bystochastic sampling of the stellar initial mass function, when inferred fromthe integrated color of low mass clusters (less than ~10^4 solar masses). weuse simulated star clusters to show that these effects are minimized when thebrightest, rapidly evolving stars in a cluster can be resolved, and the lightof the fainter, more numerous unresolved stars can be analyzed separately. whencomparing the light from the less luminous cluster members to models ofunresolved light, more accurate age estimates can be obtained than whenanalyzing the integrated light from the entire cluster under the assumptionthat the initial mass function is fully populated. we show the success of thistechnique first using simulated clusters, and then with a stellar cluster inm31. this method represents one way of accounting for the discrete, stochasticsampling of the stellar initial mass function in less massive clusters and canbe leveraged in studies of clusters throughout the local group and other nearbygalaxies.

1210.6353	supernova remnant progenitor masses in m31	using hst photometry, we age-date 59 supernova remnants (snrs) in the spiralgalaxy m31 and use these ages to estimate zero-age main sequence masses (mzams)for their progenitors. to accomplish this, we create color-magnitude diagrams(cmds) and use cmd fitting to measure the recent star formation history (sfh)of the regions surrounding cataloged snr sites. we identify any young coevalpopulation that likely produced the progenitor star and assign an age anduncertainty to that population. application of stellar evolution models allowsus to infer the mzams from this age. because our technique is not contingent onprecise location of the progenitor star, it can be applied to the location ofany known snr. we identify significant young sf around 53 of the 59 snrs andassign progenitor masses to these, representing a factor of 2 increase overcurrently measured progenitor masses. we consider the remaining 6 snrs aseither probable type ia candidates or the result of core-collapse progenitorsthat have escaped their birth sites. the distribution of recovered progenitormasses is bottom heavy, showing a paucity of the most massive stars. if weassume a single power law distribution, dn/dm proportional to m^alpha, we finda distribution that is steeper than a salpeter imf (alpha=-2.35). inparticular, we find values of alpha outside the range -2.7 to -4.4 inconsistentwith our measured distribution at 95% confidence. if instead we assume adistribution that follows a salpeter imf up to some maximum mass, we find thatvalues of m_max greater than 26 msun are inconsistent with the measureddistribution at 95% confidence. in either scenario, the data suggest that somefraction of massive stars may not explode. the result is preliminary andrequires more snrs and further analysis. in addition, we use our distributionto estimate a minimum mass for core collapse between 7.0 and 7.8 msun.

1211.6105	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury iv. a probabilistic approach  to inferring the high mass stellar initial mass function and other power-law  functions	we present a probabilistic approach for inferring the parameters of thepresent day power-law stellar mass function (mf) of a resolved young starcluster. this technique (a) fully exploits the information content of a givendataset; (b) accounts for observational uncertainties in a straightforward way;(c) assigns meaningful uncertainties to the inferred parameters; (d) avoids thepitfalls associated with binning data; and (e) is applicable to virtually anyresolved young cluster, laying the groundwork for a systematic study of thehigh mass stellar mf (m &gt; 1 msun). using simulated clusters and markov chainmonte carlo sampling of the probability distribution functions, we show thatestimates of the mf slope, {\alpha}, are unbiased and that the uncertainty,{\delta}{\alpha}, depends primarily on the number of observed stars and stellarmass range they span, assuming that the uncertainties on individual masses andthe completeness are well-characterized. using idealized mock data, we computethe lower limit precision on {\alpha} and provide an analytic approximation for{\delta}{\alpha} as a function of the observed number of stars and mass range.we find that ~ 3/4 of quoted literature uncertainties are smaller than thetheoretical lower limit. by correcting these uncertainties to the theoreticallower limits, we find the literature studies yield &lt;{\alpha}&gt;=2.46 with a1-{\sigma} dispersion of 0.35 dex. we verify that it is impossible for apower-law mf to obtain meaningful constraints on the upper mass limit of theimf. we show that avoiding substantial biases in the mf slope requires: (1)including the mf as a prior when deriving individual stellar mass estimates;(2) modeling the uncertainties in the individual stellar masses; and (3) fullycharacterizing and then explicitly modeling the completeness for stars of agiven mass.

1301.1989	global hi kinematics in dwarf galaxies	hi line widths are typically interpreted as a measure of ism turbulence,which is potentially driven by star formation. in an effort to betterunderstand the possible connections between line widths and star formation, wehave characterized \hi{} kinematics in a sample of nearby dwarf galaxies byco-adding line-of-sight spectra after removing the rotational velocity toproduce an average, global \hi{} line profile. these "superprofiles" arecomposed of a central narrow peak (~6-10 km/s) with higher-velocity wings toeither side that contain ~10-15% of the total flux. the superprofiles are allvery similar, indicating a universal global hi profile for dwarf galaxies. wecompare characteristics of the superprofiles to various galaxy properties, suchas mass and measures of star formation (sf), with the assumption that thesuperprofile represents a turbulent peak with energetic wings to either side.we use these quantities to derive average scale heights for the samplegalaxies. when comparing to physical properties, we find that the velocitydispersion of the central peak is correlated with $&lt;\sigma_\mathrm{hi}&gt;$. thefraction of mass and characteristic velocity of the high velocity wings arecorrelated with measures of sf, consistent with the picture that sf drivessurrounding hi to higher velocities. while gravitational instabilities providetoo little energy, the sf in the sample galaxies does provide enough energythrough supernovae, with realistic estimates of the coupling efficiency, toproduce the observed superprofiles.

1305.7243	measuring galaxy star formation rates from integrated photometry:  insights from color-magnitude diagrams of resolved stars	we use empirical star formation histories (sfhs), measured from hst-basedresolved star color-magnitude diagrams, as input into population synthesiscodes to model the broadband spectral energy distributions (seds) of ~50 nearbydwarf galaxies (6.5 &lt; log m/m_* &lt; 8.5, with metallicities ~10% solar). in thepresence of realistic sfhs, we compare the modeled and observed seds from theultraviolet (uv) through near-infrared (nir) and assess the reliability ofwidely used uv-based star formation rate (sfr) indicators. in the fuv through ibands, we find that the observed and modeled seds are in excellent agreement.in the spitzer 3.6micron and 4.5micron bands, we find that modeled sedssystematically over-predict observed luminosities by up to ~0.2 dex, dependingon treatment of the tp-agb stars in the synthesis models. we assess thereliability of uv luminosity as a sfr indicator, in light of independentlyconstrained sfhs. we find that fluctuations in the sfhs alone can cause factorof ~2 variations in the uv luminosities relative to the assumption of aconstant sfh over the past 100 myr. these variations are not stronglycorrelated with uv-optical colors, implying that correcting uv-based sfrs forthe effects of realistic sfhs is difficult using only the broadband sed.additionally, for this diverse sample of galaxies, we find that stars olderthan 100 myr can contribute from &lt;5% to100% of the present day uv luminosity,highlighting the challenges in defining a characteristic star formationtimescale associated with uv emission. we do find a relationship between uvemission timescale and broadband uv-optical color, though it is different thanpredictions based on exponentially declining sfh models. our findings havesignificant implications for the comparison of uv-based sfrs acrosslow-metallicity populations with diverse sfhs.

1306.2321	drivers of hi turbulence in dwarf galaxies	neutral hydrogen (hi) velocity dispersions are believed to be set byturbulence in the interstellar medium (ism). although turbulence is widelybelieved to be driven by star formation (sf), recent studies have shown thatthis driving mechanism may not be dominant in regions of low sf rate surfacedensity (sfrsd), such as found in dwarf galaxies or the outer regions ofspirals. we have generated average hi line profiles in a number of nearbydwarfs and low-mass spirals by co-adding hi spectra in regions with either acommon radius or sfrsd. we find that the spatially-resolved superprofiles arecomposed of a central narrow peak (5-15 km/s) with higher velocity wings toeither side. with the assumption that the central peak reflects the turbulentvelocity dispersion, we compare hi kinematics to local ism properties,including surface mass densities and measures of sf. the hi velocity dispersionis correlated most strongly with surface mass density, which points at agravitational origin for turbulence, but it is unclear which instabilities canoperate efficiently in these systems. sf energy is produced at a levelsufficient to drive hi turbulent motions where sfrsd &gt; 10^-4 msun yr^-1 kpc^-2.at low sf intensities, sf does not supply enough energy for turbulence, nordoes it uniquely determine the velocity dispersion. nevertheless, sf appears toprovide a lower threshold for hi velocity dispersions. we find that couplingefficiency decreases with increasing sfrsd, consistent with a picture where sfcouples to the ism with constant efficiency, but that less of that energy isfound in hi at higher sfrsd. we examine a number of potential drivers of hiturbulence, including sf, gravitational instabilities, the magnetorotationalinstability, and accretion, and find that no single mechanism can drive theobserved levels of turbulence at low sfrsd. we discuss possible solutions tothis conundrum.

1306.2420	timescales on which star formation affects the neutral ism	turbulent neutral hydrogen (hi) line widths are often thought to be drivenprimarily by star formation (sf), but the timescale for converting sf energy tohi kinetic energy is unclear. as a complication, studies on the connectionbetween hi line widths and sf in external galaxies often use broadband tracersfor the sf rate, which must implicitly assume that sf histories (sfhs) havebeen constant over the timescale of the tracer. in this paper, we comparemeasures of hi energy to time-resolved sfhs in a number of nearby dwarfgalaxies. we find that hi energy surface density is strongly correlated onlywith sf that occurred 30-40 myr ago. this timescale corresponds to theapproximate lifetime of the lowest mass supernova progenitors (~ 8 msun). thisanalysis suggests that the coupling between sf and the neutral ism is strongeston this timescale, due either to an intrinsic delay between the release of thepeak energy from sf or to the coherent effects of many sne during thisinterval. at \sigma_sfr &gt; 10^-3 msun yr^-1 kpc^-2, we find a mean couplingefficiency between sf energy and hi energy of \epsilon = 0.11 +/- 0.04 usingthe 30-40 myr timescale. however, unphysical efficiencies are required in lower\sigma_sfr systems, implying that sf is not the primary driver of hi kinematicsat \sigma_sfr &lt; 10^-3 msun yr^-1 kpc^-2.

1310.4179	a new approach to detailed structural decomposition from the splash and  phat surveys: kicked-up disk stars in the andromeda galaxy?	we characterize the bulge, disk, and halo subcomponents in the andromedagalaxy (m31) over the radial range 4 &lt; r_proj &lt; 225 kpc. the cospatial natureof these subcomponents renders them difficult to disentangle using surfacebrightness (sb) information alone, especially interior to ~20 kpc. our newdecomposition technique combines information from the luminosity function (lf)of over 1.5 million bright (20 &lt; m_814w &lt; 22) stars from the panchromatichubble andromeda treasury (phat) survey, radial velocities of over 5000 redgiant branch stars in the same magnitude range from the spectroscopic andphotometric landscape of andromeda's stellar halo (splash) survey, andintegrated i-band sb profiles from various sources. we use an affine-invariantmarkov chain monte carlo algorithm to fit an appropriate toy model to thesethree data sets. the bulge, disk, and halo sb profiles are modeled as a sersic,exponential, and cored power-law, respectively, and the lfs are modeled asbroken power-laws. we present probability distributions for each of 32parameters describing the sb profiles and lfs of the three subcomponents. wefind that the number of stars with a disk-like lf is ~5% larger than the thenumber with disk-like (dynamically cold) kinematics, suggesting that some starsborn in the disk have been dynamically heated to the point that they arekinematically indistinguishable from halo members. this is the firstkinematical evidence for a "kicked-up disk" halo population in m31. thefraction of kicked-up disk stars is consistent with that found in simulations.we also find evidence for a radially varying disk lf, consistent with anegative metallicity gradient in the stellar disk.

1310.7575	the dynamical properties of virgo cluster disk galaxies	by virtue of its proximity, the virgo cluster is an ideal laboratory fortesting our understanding structure formation in the universe. in this spirit,we present a dynamical study virgo galaxies as part of the spectroscopic andh-band imaging of virgo (shivir) survey. h$\alpha$ rotation curves (rc) for ourgas-rich galaxies were modelled with a multi-parameter fit function from whichvarious velocity measurements were inferred. our study takes advantage ofarchival and our own new data as we aim to compile the largest tully-fisherrelation (tfr) for a cluster to date. extended velocity dispersion profiles(vdp) are integrated over varying aperture sizes to extract representativevelocity dispersions (vds) for gas-poor galaxies. considering the lack of acommon standard for the measurement of a fiducial galaxy vd in the literature,we rectify this situation by determining the radius at which the measured vdyields the tightest fundamental plane (fp). we found that radius to be at least1 $r_{\rm e}$, which exceeds the extent of most dispersion profiles in otherworks.

1312.2008	constraining the age of the ngc 4565 hi disk warp: determining the  origin of gas warps	we have mapped the distribution of young and old stars in the gaseous hi warpof ngc 4565. we find a clear correlation of young stars (&lt;600 myr) with thewarp, but no coincident old stars (&gt;1 gyr), which places an upper limit on theage of the structure. the formation rate of the young stars, which increased~300 myr ago relative to the surrounding regions, is (6.3 +2.5/-1.5) x 10^-5m_sol/yr/kpc^2. this implies a ~60+/-20 gyr depletion time of the hi warp,similar to the timescales calculated for the outer hi disks of nearby spiralgalaxies. while some stars associated with the warp fall into the asymptoticgiant branch (agb) region of the color magnitude diagram, where stars could beas old as 1 gyr, further investigation suggests that they may be interlopersrather than real agb stars. we discuss the implications of these ageconstraints for the formation of hi warps, and the gas fueling of diskgalaxies.

1402.7264	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury v: ages and masses of the  year 1 stellar clusters	we present ages and masses for 601 star clusters in m31 from the analysis ofthe six filter integrated light measurements from near ultraviolet to nearinfrared wavelengths, made as part of the panchromatic hubble andromedatreasury (phat). we derive the ages and masses using a probabilistic technique,which accounts for the effects of stochastic sampling of the stellar initialmass function. tests on synthetic data show that this method, in conjunctionwith the exquisite sensitivity of the phat observations and their broadwavelength baseline, provides robust age and mass recovery for clusters rangingfrom $\sim 10^2 - 2 \times 10^6 m_\odot$. we find that the cluster agedistribution is consistent with being uniform over the past $100$ myr, whichsuggests a weak effect of cluster disruption within m31. the age distributionof older ($&gt;100$ myr) clusters fall towards old ages, consistent with apower-law decline of index $-1$, likely from a combination of fading anddisruption of the clusters. we find that the mass distribution of the wholesample can be well-described by a single power-law with a spectral index of$-1.9 \pm 0.1$ over the range of $10^3-3 \times 10^5 m_\odot$. however, if wesubdivide the sample by galactocentric radius, we find that the agedistributions remain unchanged. however, the mass spectral index variessignificantly, showing best fit values between $-2.2$ and $-1.8$, with theshallower slope in the highest star formation intensity regions. we explore therobustness of our study to potential systematics and conclude that the clustermass function may vary with respect to environment.

1404.4981	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury. vi. the reliability of  far-ultraviolet flux as a star formation tracer on sub-kpc scales	we have used optical observations of resolved stars from the panchromatichubble andromeda treasury (phat) to measure the recent (&lt; 500 myr) starformation histories (sfhs) of 33 fuv-bright regions in m31. the region areasranged from ~$10^4$ to $10^6$ pc$^2$, which allowed us to test the reliabilityof fuv flux as a tracer of recent star formation on sub-kpc scales. the starformation rates (sfrs) derived from the extinction-corrected observed fuvfluxes were, on average, consistent with the 100-myr mean sfrs of the sfhs towithin the 1$\sigma$ scatter. overall, the scatter was larger than theuncertainties in the sfrs and particularly evident among the smallest regions.the scatter was consistent with an even combination of discrete sampling of theinitial mass function and high variability in the sfhs. this resultdemonstrates the importance of satisfying both the full-imf and theconstant-sfr assumptions for obtaining precise sfr estimates from fuv flux.assuming a robust fuv extinction correction, we estimate that a factor of 2.5uncertainty can be expected in fuv-based sfrs for regions smaller than $10^5$pc$^2$, or a few hundred pc. we also examined ages and masses derived from uvflux under the common assumption that the regions are simple stellarpopulations (ssps). the sfhs showed that most of the regions are not ssps, andthe age and mass estimates were correspondingly discrepant from the sfhs. forthose regions with ssp-like sfhs, we found mean discrepancies of 10 myr in ageand a factor of 3 to 4 in mass. it was not possible to distinguish the ssp-likeregions from the others based on integrated fuv flux.

1405.3281	the star formation histories of local group dwarf galaxies ii. searching  for signatures of reionization	we search for signatures of reionization in the star formation histories(sfhs) of 38 local group dwarf galaxies (10$^4$ $&lt;$ m$_{\star}$ $&lt;$ 10$^9$m$_{\odot}$). the sfhs are derived from color-magnitude diagrams using archivalhubble space telescope/wide field planetary camera 2 imaging. only fivequenched galaxies (and v, and vi, and xiii, leo iv, hercules) are consistentwith forming the bulk of their stars before reionization, when fulluncertainties are considered. observations of 13 of the predicted `truefossils' identified by bovill &amp; ricotti show that only two (hercules and leoiv) indicate star formation quenched by reionization. however, both are withinthe virial radius of the milky way and evidence of tidal disturbancecomplicates this interpretation. we argue that the late-time gas capturescenario posited by ricotti for the low mass, gas-rich, and star-forming fossilcandidate leo t is observationally indistinguishable from simple gas retention.given the ambiguity between environmental effects and reionization, the bestreionization fossil candidates are quenched low mass field galaxies (e.g., kkr25).

1405.6626	constraints for the progenitor masses of 17 historic core-collapse  supernovae	using resolved stellar photometry measured from archival hst imaging, wegenerate color-magnitude diagrams of the stars within 50 pc of the locations ofhistoric core-collapse supernovae that took place in galaxies within 8 mpc. wefit these color-magnitude distributions with stellar evolution models todetermine the best-fit age distribution of the young population. we thentranslate these age distributions into probability distributions for theprogenitor mass of each sne. the measurements are anchored by the main-sequencestars surrounding the event, making them less sensitive to assumptions aboutbinarity, post-main-sequence evolution, or circumstellar dust. we demonstratethat, in cases where the literature contains masses that have been measuredfrom direct imaging, our measurements are consistent with (but less precisethan) these measurements. using this technique, we constrain the progenitormasses of 17 historic sne, 11 of which have no previous estimates from directimaging. our measurements still allow the possibility that all sne progenitormasses are &lt;20 m_sun. however, the large uncertainties for the highest-massprogenitors also allow the possibility of no upper-mass cutoff.

1502.03820	a clear age-velocity dispersion correlation in andromeda's stellar disk	the stellar kinematics of galactic disks are key to constraining diskformation and evolution processes. in this paper, for the first time, wemeasure the stellar age-velocity dispersion correlation in the inner 20 kpc(3.5 disk scale lengths) of m31 and show that it is dramatically different fromthat in the milky way. we use optical hubble space telescope/advanced camerafor surveys photometry of 5800 individual stars from the panchromatic hubbleandromeda treasury (phat) survey and keck/deimos radial velocity measurementsof the same stars from the spectroscopic and photometric landscape ofandromeda's stellar halo (splash) survey. we show that the averageline-of-sight velocity dispersion is a steadily increasing function of stellarage exterior to r=10 kpc, increasing from 30 km/s for the young upper mainsequence stars to 90 km/s for the old red giant branch stars. this monotonicincrease implies that a continuous or recurring process contributed to theevolution of the disk. both the slope and normalization of the dispersion vs.age relation are significantly larger than in the milky way, allowing for thepossibility that the disk of m31 has had a more violent history than the diskof the milky way, more in line with cosmological predictions. we also findevidence for an inhomogeneous distribution of stars from a second kinematicalcomponent in addition to the dominant disk component. one of the largest andhottest high-dispersion patches is present in all age bins, and may be thesignature of the end of the long bar.

1502.06621	the high-mass stellar initial mass function in m31 clusters	we have undertaken the largest systematic study of the high-mass stellarinitial mass function (imf) to date using the optical color-magnitude diagrams(cmds) of 85 resolved, young (4 myr &lt; t &lt; 25 myr), intermediate mass starclusters (10^3-10^4 msun), observed as part of the panchromatic hubbleandromeda treasury (phat) program. we fit each cluster's cmd to measure itsmass function (mf) slope for stars &gt;2 msun. for the ensemble of clusters, thedistribution of stellar mf slopes is best described by$\gamma=+1.45^{+0.03}_{-0.06}$ with a very small intrinsic scatter. the dataalso imply no significant dependencies of the mf slope on cluster age, mass,and size, providing direct observational evidence that the measured mfrepresents the imf. this analysis implies that the high-mass imf slope in m31clusters is universal with a slope ($\gamma=+1.45^{+0.03}_{-0.06}$) that issteeper than the canonical kroupa (+1.30) and salpeter (+1.35) values. usingour inference model on select milky way (mw) and lmc high-mass imf studies fromthe literature, we find $\gamma_{\rm mw} \sim+1.15\pm0.1$ and $\gamma_{\rm lmc}\sim+1.3\pm0.1$, both with intrinsic scatter of ~0.3-0.4 dex. thus, while thehigh-mass imf in the local group may be universal, systematics in literatureimf studies preclude any definitive conclusions; homogenous investigations ofthe high-mass imf in the local universe are needed to overcome this limitation.consequently, the present study represents the most robust measurement of thehigh-mass imf slope to date. we have grafted the m31 high-mass imf slope ontowidely used sub-solar mass kroupa and chabrier imfs and show that commonly useduv- and halpha-based star formation rates should be increased by a factor of~1.3-1.5 and the number of stars with masses &gt;8 msun are ~25% fewer thanexpected for a salpeter/kroupa imf.

1503.05195	the star formation histories of local group dwarf galaxies iii.  characterizing quenching in low-mass galaxies	we explore the quenching of low-mass galaxies (10^4 &lt; mstar &lt; 10^8 msun) as afunction of lookback time using the star formation histories (sfhs) of 38 localgroup dwarf galaxies. the sfhs were derived from analyzing color-magnitudediagrams of resolved stellar populations in archival hubble spacetelescope/wide field planetary camera 2 imaging. we find: (1) lower massgalaxies quench earlier than higher mass galaxies; (2) inside of virial radiusthere is no correlation between a satellite's current proximity to a massivehost and its quenching epoch; (3) there are hints of systematic differences inquenching times of m31 and milky way (mw) satellites, although the samplesample size and uncertainties in the sfhs of m31 dwarfs prohibit definitiveconclusions. combined with literature results, we qualitatively consider theredshift evolution (z=0-1) of the quenched galaxy fraction over ~7 dex instellar mass (10^4 &lt; mstar &lt; 10^11.5 msun). the quenched fraction of allgalaxies generally increases toward the present, with both the lowest andhighest mass systems exhibiting the largest quenched fractions at allredshifts. in contrast, galaxies between mstar ~ 10^8-10^10 msun have thelowest quenched fractions. we suggest that such intermediate-mass galaxies arethe least efficient at quenching. finally, we compare our quenching times withpredictions for infall times of low-mass galaxies associated with the mw. wefind that some of the lowest-mass satellites (e.g., cvn ii, leo iv) may havebeen quenched before infall while higher mass satellites (e.g., leo i, fornax)typically quench ~1-4 gyr after infall.

1504.03338	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury xi: the spatially-resolved  recent star formation history of m31	we measure the recent star formation history (sfh) across m31 using opticalimages taken with the \texit{hubble space telescope} as part of thepanchromatic hubble andromeda treasury (phat). we fit the color-magnitudediagrams in ~9000 regions that are ~100 pc $\times$ 100 pc in projected size,covering a 0.5 square degree area (~380 kpc$^2$, deprojected) in the nequadrant of m31. we show that the sfhs vary significantly on these smallspatial scales but that there are also coherent galaxy-wide fluctuations in thesfh back to ~500 myr, most notably in m31's 10-kpc star-forming ring. we findthat the 10-kpc ring is at least 400 myr old, showing ongoing star formationover the past ~500 myr. this indicates the presence of molecular gas in thering over at least 2 dynamical times at this radius. we also find that thering's position is constant throughout this time, and is stationary at thelevel of 1 km/s, although there is evidence for broadening of the ring due todiffusion of stars into the disk. based on existing models of m31's ringfeatures, the lack of evolution in the ring's position makes a purelycollisional ring origin highly unlikely. we find that the global sfr has beenfairly constant over the last ~500 myr, though it does show a small increase at50 myr that is 1.3 times the average sfr over the past 100 myr. during the last~500 myr, ~60% of all sf occurs in the 10-kpc ring. finally, we find that inthe past 100 myr, the average sfr over the phat survey area is $0.28\pm0.03$m$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ with an average deprojected intensity of $7.3 \times10^{-4}$ m$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$, which yields a total sfr of ~0.7m$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ when extrapolated to the entire area of m31's disk. thissfr is consistent with measurements from broadband estimates.

1506.01097	photometric evidence of an intermediate-age stellar population in the  inner bulge of m31	we explore the assembly history of the m31 bulge within a projectedmajor-axis radius of 180" (~680 pc) by studying its stellar populations inhubble space telescope wfc3 and acs observations. colors formed by comparingnear-ultraviolet vs. optical bands are found to become bluer with increasingmajor-axis radius, which is opposite to that predicted if the sole sources ofnear-ultraviolet light were old extreme horizontal branch stars with a negativeradial gradient in metallicity. spectral energy distribution fits require ametal-rich intermediate-age stellar population (300 myr to 1 gyr old, ~solarmetallicity) in addition to the dominant old population. the radial gradientsin age and metallicity of the old stellar population are consistent with thosein previous works. for the intermediate-age population, we find an increase inage with radius and a mass fraction that increases up to 2% at 680 pc away fromthe center. we exclude contamination from the m31 disk and/or halo as the mainorigin for this population. our results thus suggest that intermediate-agestars exist beyond the central 5" (19 pc) of m31 and contribute ~1% of thetotal stellar mass in the bulge. these stars could be related to the seculargrowth of the m31 bulge.

1507.06687	a spectroscopic and photometric exploration of the c/m ratio in the disk  of m31	we explore the ratio (c/m) of carbon-rich to oxygen-rich thermally pulsingasymptotic giant branch(tp-agb) stars in the disk of m31 using a combination ofmoderate-resolution optical spectroscopy from the spectroscopic landscape ofandromeda's stellar halo (splash) survey and six-filter hubble space telescopephotometry from the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury (phat) survey.carbonstars were identified spectroscopically. oxygen-rich m-stars were identifedusing three different photometric definitions designed to mimic, and thusevaluate, selection techniques common in the literature. we calculate the c/mratio as a function of galactocentric radius, present-day gas-phase oxygenabundance, stellar metallicity, age (via proxy defined as the ratio of tp-agbstars to red giant branch, rgb, stars), and mean star formation rate over thelast 400 myr. we find statistically significant correlations between log(c/m)and all parameters. these trends are consistent across different m-starselection methods, though the fiducial values change. of particular note is ourobserved relationship between log(c/m) and stellar metallicity, which is fullyconsistent with the trend seen across local group satellite galaxies. the factthat this trend persists in stellar populations with very different starformation histories indicates that the c/m ratio is governed by stellarproperties alone.

1509.06988	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury viii: a wide-area,  high-resolution map of dust extinction in m31	we map the distribution of dust in m31 at 25pc resolution, using stellarphotometry from the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury. we develop a newmapping technique that models the nir color-magnitude diagram (cmd) of redgiant branch (rgb) stars. the model cmds combine an unreddened foreground ofrgb stars with a reddened background population viewed through a log-normalcolumn density distribution of dust. fits to the model constrain the medianextinction, the width of the extinction distribution, and the fraction ofreddened stars. the resulting extinction map has &gt;4 times better resolutionthan maps of dust emission, while providing a more direct measurement of thedust column. there is superb morphological agreement between the new map andmaps of the extinction inferred from dust emission by draine et al. 2014.however, the widely-used draine &amp; li (2007) dust models overpredict theobserved extinction by a factor of ~2.5, suggesting that m31's true dust massis lower and that dust grains are significantly more emissive than assumed indraine et al. (2014). the discrepancy we identify is consistent with similarfindings in the milky way by the planck collaboration (2015), but has a morecomplex dependence on parameters from the draine &amp; li (2007) dust models. wealso show that the discrepancy with the draine et al.

1511.00006	panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury xii. mapping stellar metallicity  distributions in m31	we present a study of spatial variations in the metallicity of old red giantbranch stars in the andromeda galaxy. photometric metallicity estimates arederived by interpolating isochrones for over seven million stars in thepanchromatic hubble andromeda treasury (phat) survey. this is the firstsystematic study of stellar metallicities over the inner 20 kpc of andromeda'sgalactic disk. we see a clear metallicity gradient of $-0.020\pm0.004$ dex/kpcfrom $\sim4-20$ kpc assuming a constant rgb age. this metallicity gradient isderived after correcting for the effects of photometric bias and completenessand dust extinction and is quite insensitive to these effects. the unknown agegradient in m31's disk creates the dominant systematic uncertainty in ourderived metallicity gradient. however, spectroscopic analyses of galaxiessimilar to m31 show that they typically have small age gradients that make thissystematic error comparable to the 1$\sigma$ error on our metallicity gradientmeasurement. in addition to the metallicity gradient, we observe an asymmetriclocal enhancement in metallicity at radii of 3-6 kpc that appears to beassociated with andromeda's elongated bar. this same region also appears tohave an enhanced stellar density and velocity dispersion.

0806.3434	the role of the radial orbit instability in dark matter halo formation  and structure	for a decade, n-body simulations have revealed a nearly universal dark matterdensity profile, which appears to be robust to changes in the overall densityof the universe and the underlying power spectrum. despite its universality,the physical origin of this profile has not yet been well understood.semi--analytic models by barnes et al. (2005) have suggested that the densitystructure of dark matter halos is determined by the onset of the radial orbitinstability (roi). we have tested this hypothesis using n-body simulations ofcollapsing dark matter halos with a variety of initial conditions. fordynamically cold initial conditions, the resulting halo structures are triaxialin shape, due to the mild aspect of the instability. we examine how variationsin initial velocity dispersion affect the onset of the instability, and findthat an isotropic velocity dispersion can suppress the roi entirely, while apurely radial dispersion does not. the quantity sigma^2/vc^2 is a criterion forinstability, where regions with sigma^2/vc^2 &lt;~1 become triaxial due to the roior other perturbations. we also find that the radial orbit instability sets ascale length at which the velocity dispersion changes rapidly from isotropic toradially anisotropic. this scale length is proportional to the radius at whichthe density profile changes shape, as is the case in the semi--analytic models;however, the coefficient of proportionality is different by a factor of ~2.5.we conclude that the radial orbit instability is likely to be a key physicalmechanism responsible for the nearly universal profiles of simulated darkmatter halos.

astro-ph;0001415	measuring the diffuse optical light in abell 1651	using drift scan data, a new approach to determining surface brightnessprofiles, and techniques for detecting low surface brightness signals, we fitthe light profile of the brightest cluster galaxy (bcg) in the rich clusterabell 1651 out to 670 h^{-1} kpc. this radius is a significant fraction of thevirial radius of the cluster (2 h^{-1} mpc; girardi et al. 1998), indicatingthat the sizes of the bcg and the cluster are comparable. we find that theprofile is consistent with a de vaucouleurs profile over the radial rangeprobed. we also find that the integrated light profile of the bcg in abell 1651contributes 36% of the total cluster light within 500 h^{-1} kpc. including allluminous components, we obtain m/l_i~160 h for the cluster, which would beoverestimated by ~20% without the bcg halo. furthermore, the relatively redcolor of the bcg at large radii suggests that recent disruption and tidalstripping of spirals and dwarf ellipticals do not contribute significantly tothe halo luminosity. the color and the form of the profile are consistent witha scenario in which the bcg forms from filamentary collapse during the epoch ofcluster formation, with relatively little evolution in the past 5 gyrs(dubinski 1998). we remove the bcg and other detected galaxies from the imageand construct a two dimensional surface brightness map of the cluster core.several knots of excess emission are found, but the total diffuse component isconstrained to contribute less than 5% of the cluster light.

astro-ph;0002330	new dark matter physics: clues from halo structure	we examine the effect of primordial dark matter velocity dispersion and/orparticle self-interactions on the structure and stability of galaxy halos,especially with respect to the formation of substructure and central densitycusps. primordial velocity dispersion is characterised by a ``phase density''$q\equiv \rho/&lt;v^2&gt;^{3/2}$, which for relativistically-decoupled relics isdetermined by particle mass and spin and is insensitive to cosmologicalparameters. finite $q$ leads to small-scale filtering of the primordial powerspectrum, which reduces substructure, and limits the maximum central density ofhalos, which eliminates central cusps. the relationship between $q$ and haloobservables is estimated. the primordial $q$ may be preserved in the cores ofhalos and if so leads to a predicted relation, closely analogous to that indegenerate dwarf stars, between the central density and velocity dispersion.classical polytrope solutions are used to model the structure of halos ofcollisional dark matter, and to show that self-interactions in halos today areprobably not significant because they destabilize halo cores via heatconduction. constraints on masses and self-interactions of dark matterparticles are estimated from halo stability and other considerations.

astro-ph;0004381	halo cores and phase space densities: observational constraints on dark  matter physics and structure formation	we explore observed dynamical trends in a wide range of dark matter dominatedsystems (about seven orders of magnitude in mass) to constrain hypotheticaldark matter candidates and scenarios of structure formation. first, we arguethat neither generic warm dark matter (collisionless or collisional) norself-interacting dark matter can be responsible for the observed cores on allscales. both scenarios predict smaller cores for higher mass systems, inconflict with observations; some cores must instead have a dynamical origin.second, we show that the core phase space densities of dwarf spheroidals,rotating dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies, and clusters of galaxiesdecrease with increasing velocity dispersion like q ~ sigma^-3 ~ m^-1, aspredicted by a simple scaling argument based on merging equilibrium systems,over a range of about eight orders of magnitude in q. we discuss the processeswhich set the overall normalization of the observed phase density hierarchy. asan aside, we note that the observed phase-space scaling behavior and densityprofiles of dark matter halos both resemble stellar components in ellipticalgalaxies, likely reflecting a similar collisionless, hierarchical origin. thus,dark matter halos may suffer from the same systematic departures from homologyas seen in ellipticals, possibly explaining the shallower density profilesobserved in low mass halos. finally, we use the maximum observed phase spacedensity in dwarf spheroidal galaxies to fix a minimum mass for relativisticallydecoupled warm dark matter candidates of roughly 700 ev for thermal fermions,and 300 ev for degenerate fermions.

(1993). our sample was selected toinclude galaxies with particularly large axial ratios, increading thelikelihood that the galaxies in the sample are truly edge-on. we have alsoconcentrated the sample on galaxies with low apparent surface brightness, inorder to increase the representation of intrinisically low surface brightnessgalaxies. finally, the sample was chosen to have no apprarent bulges or opticalwarps so that the galaxies represent undisturbed, ``pure disk'' systems. theresulting sample forms the basis for a much larger spectroscopic study designedto place constraints on the physical quantities and processes which shape diskgalaxies. the imaging data presented in this paper has been painstakinglyreduced and calibrated to allow accurate surface photometry of features asfaint as 30 mag/sqr-arcsec in b and 29 mag/sqr-arcsec in r on scales largerthan 10 arcsec. due to limitations in sky subtraction and flat fielding, theinfrared data can reach only to 22.5 mag/sqr-arcsec in k_s on comparablescales. as part of this work, we have developed a new method for quantifyingthe reliability of surface photometry, which provides useful diagnostics forthe presence of scattered light, optical emission from infrared cirrus, andother sources of non-uniform sky backgrounds.

astro-ph;0007121	disk galaxies as cosmological benchmarks: cold dark matter versus  modified newtonian dynamics	we discuss a comparison of models for the formation of disk galaxies both ina universe dominated by cold dark matter (cdm) and one in which the force lawis given by modified newtonian dynamics (mond). our main aim is to address theclaim made by mcgaugh &amp; de blok that cdm suffers from severe fine-tuningproblems, which are circumvented under mond. as we show, cdm indeed requiressome amount of tuning of the feedback efficiencies to obtain a tully-fisherrelation (tfr) as steep as observed. however, that same model is in excellentagreement with a wide variety of additional observations. therefore, the modestamount of feedback needed should not be regarded a fine-tuning problem.instead, its requirement should be considered a generic prediction for cdm,which might be tested with future observations and with detailed modeling offeedback processes. we also show that galaxy formation in a mond universe cannot simultaneously reproduce the tfr and the lack of high surface brightnessdwarf galaxies. we thus conclude that cdm is a more viable theory for theformation of disk galaxies than mond.

astro-ph;0312002	investigating the origins of dark matter halo density profiles	although high-resolution n-body simulations make robust empirical predictionsfor the density distribution within cold dark matter halos, these studies haveyielded little physical insight into the origins of the distribution. weinvestigate the problem using analytic and semi-analytic approaches. simpleanalytic considerations suggest that the inner slope of dark matter haloscannot be steeper than alpha=2 (rho ~ r^-alpha), with alpha=1.5-1.7 being amore realistic upper limit. our analysis suggests that any number of effects,both real (angular momentum from tidal torques, secondary perturbations) andartificial (two-body interactions, the accuracy of the numerical integrator,round-off errors), will result in shallower slopes. we also find that the halosshould exhibit a well-defined relation between r_peri/r_apo and j_theta/j_r. wederive this relation analytically and speculate that it may be "universal".using a semi-analytic scheme based on ryden &amp; gunn (1987), we further explorethe relationship between the specific angular momentum distribution in a haloand its density profile. for now we restrict ourselves to halos that formprimarily via nearly-smooth accretion of matter, and only consider the specificangular momentum generated by secondary perturbations associated with the colddark matter spectrum of density fluctuations. compared to those formed inn-body simulations, our ``semi-analytic'' halos are more extended, have flatterrotation curves and have higher specific angular momentum, even though we havenot yet taken into account the effects of tidal torques. whether the densityprofiles of numerical halos is indeed the result of loss in angular momentumoutside the central region, and whether this loss is a feature of hierarchicalmerging and major mergers in particular, is under investigation.

astro-ph;0402472	the formation of dust lanes: implications for galaxy evolution	we find that disk galaxies show a sharp, mass-dependent transition in thestructure of their dusty ism. dust lanes are a generic feature of massive diskswith v_rot&gt;120km/s, but are completely absent in galaxies with v_rot&lt;120km/s.the transition reflects an increase in the scale height of the cold ism in lowmass galaxies, driven by larger turbulent velocities supporting the gas layer,rather than sharp drops in the gas surface density. we identify thev_rot=120km/s transition with the onset of gravitational instabilities in highmass galaxies. the instabilities lead to fragmentation and gravitationalcollapse along spiral arms, smaller gas scale heights, lower turbulentvelocities, and thus to narrow dust lanes. the drop in velocity dispersion maybe due either to a switch in the driving mechanism for turbulence or to achange in the response of the ism to supernovae after the ism has collapsed toa dense layer. the resulting smaller gas scale height can lead to significantincreases in the star formation rate when disk instabilities are present, andmay explain the kennicutt surface density threshold for star formation. ourdata suggest that star formation will be systematically less efficient in lowmass disks with v_c&lt;120km/s, leading to star formation timescales longer thanthe gas accretion timescale. this effect can suppress the metallicity andnucleosynthetic yields of low mass disks, and thus explain the diskmass-metallicity relationship without invoking galactic sn-driven outflows. thetransitions in disk stability, dust structure, and/or star formation efficiencymay also be responsible for observed changes in the slope of the tully-fisherrelation, in the sharp increase in the thickness of dwarf galaxy disks, and inthe onset of bulges in galaxies with v_rot&gt;120km/s.

astro-ph;0410416	a new milky way companion: unusual globular cluster or extreme dwarf  satellite?	we report the discovery of sdssj1049+5103, an overdensity of resolved bluestars at (\alpha_{2000}, \delta_{2000}) = (162.343, 51.051). this objectappears to be an old, metal-poor stellar system at a distance of 45 +/- 10 kpc,with a half-light radius of 23$\pm 10$ pc and an absolute magnitude of m_v =-3.0^{+2.0}_{-0.7}. one star that is likely associated with this companion hasan sdss spectrum confirming it as a blue horizontal branch star at 48 kpc. thecolor-magnitude diagram of sdssj1049+5103 contains few, if any, horizontal orred giant branch stars, similar to the anomalously faint globular cluster am 4.the size and luminosity of sdssj1049+5103 places it at the intersection of thesize-luminosity relationships followed by known globular clusters and by milkyway dwarf spheroidals. if sdssj1049+5103 is a globular cluster, then itsproperties are consistent with the established trend that the largest radiusgalactic globular clusters are all in the outer halo. however, the five knownglobular clusters with similarly faint absolute magnitudes all have half-massradii that are smaller than sdssj1049+5103 by a factor of $\gtrsim$ 5. if it isa dwarf spheroidal, then it is the faintest yet known by two orders ofmagnitude, and is the first example of the ultra-faint dwarfs predicted by sometheories. the uncertain nature of this new system underscores the sometimesambiguous distinction between globular clusters and dwarf spheroidals. a simplefriends-of-friends search for similar blue, small scalesize star clustersdetected all known globulars and dwarfs closer than 50 kpc in the sdss area,but yielded no other candidates as robust as sdssj1049+5103.

astro-ph;0501394	the kinematics of thick disks in external galaxies	we present kinematic measurements of the thick and thin disks in two edge-ongalaxies. we have derived stellar rotation curves at and above the galaxies'midplanes using ca ii triplet features measured with the gmos spectrograph ongemini north. in one galaxy, fgc 1415, the kinematics above the plane showclear rotation that lags that of the midplane by ~20-50%, similar to thebehavior seen in the milky way. however, the kinematics of the second galaxy,fgc 227, are quite different. the rotation above the plane is extremely slow,showing &lt;25% of the rotation speed of the stars at the midplane. we decomposethe observed rotation curves into a superposition of thick and thin diskkinematics, using 2-dimensional fits to the galaxy images to determine thefraction of thick disk stars at each position. we find that the thick disk offgc 1415 rotates at 30-40% of the rotation speed of the thin disk. in contrast,the thick disk of fgc 227 is very likely counter-rotating, if it is rotating atall. these observations are consistent with the velocity dispersion profiles wemeasure for each galaxy. the detection of counter-rotating thick disksconclusively rules out models where the thick disk forms either duringmonolithic collapse or from vertical heating of a previous thin disk. instead,the data strongly support models where the thick disk forms from directaccretion of stars from infalling satellites.

astro-ph;0506117	a study of edge-on galaxies with the hubble space telescope's advanced  camera for surveys. ii. vertical distribution of the resolved stellar  population	we analyze the vertical distribution of the resolved stellar populations insix low-mass, edge-on, spiral galaxies observed with the hubble space telescopeadvanced camera for surveys. in each galaxy we find evidence for an extraplanarstellar component extending up to 15 scale heights (3.5 kpc) above the plane.we analyze the vertical distribution as a function of stellar age by trackingchanges in the color-magnitude diagram. the young stellar component (&lt;10^8 yrs)is found to have a scale height larger than the young component in the milkyway, suggesting that stars in these low mass galaxies form in a thicker disk.we also find that the scale height of a stellar population increases with age,with young main sequence stars, intermediate age asymptotic giant branch stars,and old red giant branch stars having succesively larger scale heights in eachgalaxy. this systematic trend indicates that disk heating must play some rolein producing the extraplanar stars. we constrain the rate of disk heating usingthe observed trend between scale height and stellar age, and find that theobserved heating rates are dramatically smaller than in the milky way. thecolor distributions of the red giant branch stars well above the midplaneindicate that the extended stellar components we see are moderately metal-poor,with peak metallicities around [fe/h]=-1 and with little or no metallicitygradient with height. the lack of metallicity gradient can be explained if amajority of extraplanar rgb stars were formed at early times and are notdominated by a younger heated population. our observations suggest that, likethe milky way, low-mass disk galaxies also have multiple stellar components. inits structure, mean metallicity and old age, the rgb component in thesegalaxies seems analagous to the milky way thick disk.

astro-ph;0506571	semi-analytical dark matter halos and the jeans equation	although n-body studies of dark matter halos show that the density profiles,rho(r), are not simple power-laws, the quantity rho/sigma^3, where sigma(r) isthe velocity dispersion, is in fact a featureless power-law over ~3 decades inradius. in the first part of the paper we demonstrate, using the semi-analyticextended secondary infall model (esim), that the nearly scale-free nature ofrho/sigma^3 is a robust feature of virialized halos in equilibrium. byexamining the processes in common between numerical n-body and semi-analyticapproaches, we argue that the scale-free nature of rho/sigma^3 cannot be theresult of hierarchical merging, rather it must be an outcome of violentrelaxation. the empirical results of the first part of the paper motivate theanalytical work of the second part of the paper, where we use rho/sigma^3proportional to r^{-alpha} as an additional constraint in the isotropic jeansequation of hydrostatic equilibrium. our analysis shows that the constrainedjeans equation has different types of solutions, and in particular, it admits aunique ``periodic'' solution with alpha=1.9444. we derive the analyticexpression for this density profile, which asymptotes to inner and outerprofiles of rho ~ r^{-0.78}, and rho ~ r^{-3.44}, respectively.

astro-ph;0508460	structural parameters of thin and thick disks in edge-on disk galaxies	we analyze the global structure of 34 late-type, edge-on, undisturbed, diskgalaxies spanning a wide range of mass. we measure structural parameters forthe galaxies using two-dimensional least-squares fitting to our $r$-bandphotometry. the fits require both a thick and a thin disk to adequately fit thedata. the thick disks have larger scale heights and longer scale lengths thanthe embedded thin disks, by factors of ~2 and ~1.25, respectively. the observedstructural parameters agree well with the properties of thick and thin disksderived from star counts in the milky way and from resolved stellar populationsin nearby galaxies. we find that massive galaxies' luminosities are dominatedby the thin disk. however, in low mass galaxies (vc &lt; 120 km/s), thick diskstars contribute nearly half of the luminosity and dominate the stellar mass.thus, although low mass dwarf galaxies appear blue, the majority of their starsare probably quite old.  our data are most easily explained by a formation scenario where the thickdisk is assembled through direct accretion of stellar material from mergingsatellites while the thin disk is formed from accreted gas. the baryonicfraction in the thin disk therefore constrains the gas-richness of the mergingpre-galactic fragments. if we include the mass in hi as part of the thin disk,the thick disk contains &lt;10% of the baryons in high mass galaxies, and ~25-30%of the baryons in low-mass galaxies. we discuss how our trends can be explainedby supernova-driven outflow at early times as well as the possibilities forpredicting abundance trends in thick disks, and for removing discrepanciesbetween semi-analytic galaxy formation models and the observed colors of lowmass galaxies.

astro-ph;0603486	willman 1 - a galactic satellite at 40 kpc with multiple stellar tails	sdssj1049+5103, commonly known as willman 1, is an extremely low-luminositymilky way companion whose properties are intermediate between those of globularclusters and dwarf spheroidals. in this paper, we use deep photometry to showthat this object is old and moderately metal-poor, has a distance of 38 +/- 7kpc, has an m_v of -2.5 mag, and has a half-light radius of 21 +/- 7 pc,consistent with previous estimates. the spatial distribution of willman 1'smain sequence stars shows 1) its total spatial extent exceeds its tidal radiusfor a range of assumptions about its total mass and its orbit and 2) thepresence of prominent multi-directional stellar tails. the tidal interactionscausing these tail features may explain the large physical size of willman 1relative to low-luminosity globular clusters. it is the most distant galacticobject yet known to display prominent tails, and is the only distant satelliteto display multi-directional tails. although we cannot at present determine thecause of this unusual morphology, preliminary comparisons between themorphology of willman 1 and published simulations suggest that it may be nearthe apocenter of its orbit, or that it may have interacted with another haloobject. we find a significant difference between the luminosity functions ofstars in the center and in the tails of willman 1, strongly suggesting masssegregation much like that seen in palomar 5. although willman 1 has morepronounced tidal tails than most confirmed milky way dwarf galaxies, because ofits very low stellar mass we cannot at present rule out the possibility that ithas a dark matter halo.

astro-ph;0609302	clues to nuclear star cluster formation from edge-on spirals	we find 9 nuclear cluster candidates in a sample of 14 edge-on, late-typegalaxies observed with hst/acs. these clusters have magnitudes (m_i ~ -11) andsizes (r_eff ~ 3pc) similar to those found in previous studies of face-on,late-type spirals and de galaxies. however, three of the nuclear clusters aresignificantly flattened and show evidence for multiple, coincident structuralcomponents. the elongations of these three clusters are aligned to within 10degrees of the galaxies' major axes. structurally, the flattened clusters arewell fit by a combination of a spheroid and a disk or ring. the nuclear clusterdisks/rings have f606w-f814w (~v-i) colors 0.3-0.6 magnitudes bluer than thespheroid components, suggesting that the stars in these components have ages &lt;1 gyr. in ngc 4244, the nearest of the nuclear clusters, we further constrainthe stellar populations and provide a lower limit on the dynamical mass viaspectroscopy. we also present tentative evidence that another of the nuclearclusters (in ngc 4206) may also host a supermassive black hole. based on ourobservational results we propose an in situ formation mechanism for nuclearclusters in which stars form episodically in compact nuclear disks, and thenlose angular momentum or heat vertically to form an older spheroidal structure.we estimate the period between star formation episodes to be 0.5 gyr anddiscuss possible mechanisms for tranforming the disk-like components intospheroids. we also note the connection between our objects and massive globularclusters (e.g. $\omega$ cen), ucds, and smbhs.

astro-ph;0609784	density profiles of collisionless equilibria. ii. anisotropic spherical  systems	it has long been realized that dark matter halos formed in cosmologicaln-body simulations are characterized by density profiles rho(r) that, whensuitably scaled, have similar shapes. additionally, combining the density andvelocity dispersion profiles sigma(r), each of which have decidedlynonpower-law shapes, leads to quantity rho/(sigma^3) that is a power-law inradius over 3 orders of magnitude in radius. halos' velocity anisotropyprofiles beta(r) vary from isotropic near the centers of halos to quiteradially anisotropic near the virial radius. finally, there appears to be anearly linear correlation between beta and the logarithmic density slope gammafor a wide variety of halos. this work is part of a continuing investigation ofthe above interrelationships and their origins using analytical andsemi-analytical techniques. our finding suggest that the nearly linearbeta--gamma relationship is not just another expression of scale-freerho/(sigma^3) behavior. we also note that simultaneously reproducing densityand anisotropy profiles like those found in simulations requires beta(r) andgamma(r) to have similar shapes, leading to nearly linear beta--gammacorrelations. this work suggests that the beta--gamma and power-lawrho/(sigma^3) relations have distinct physical origins.

astro-ph;9710015	systematic biases in galaxy luminosity functions	both the detection of galaxies and the derivation of the luminosity functiondepend upon isophotal magnitudes, implicitly in the first case, and explicitlyin the latter. however, unlike perfect point sources, the fraction of agalaxy's light contained within the limiting isophote is a function ofredshift, due to the combined effects of the point spread function andcosmological dimming. this redshift variation in the measured isophotalluminosity can strongly affect the derived luminosity function. usingsimulations which include the effects of seeing upon both disk and ellipticalgalaxies, we explore the size of the systematic biases which can result fromignoring the redshift variation in the fraction of detected light. we show thatthe biases lead to underestimates in the normalization of the luminosityfunction, as well as changes in shape. the size of the bias depends uponredshift, and thus can mimic galaxy evolution. surprisingly, these biases canbe extremely large without affecting &lt;v/v_max&gt;. however, these biases can bedetected in the full distribution of v/v_max, and in fact may have already beendetected in recent surveys. because the systematic biases result from theredshift variation in the fraction of lost light, the biases are notsignificant when the fraction of lost light is always small over the entiresurvey volume, for all galaxy types; however, modern surveys usually violatethese conditions. we show that the expected biases are not necessarilyeliminated when using aperture magnitudes, focas "total" magnitudes, or kronmagnitudes, but may be reduced if petrosian magnitudes are used. theseconsiderations may also apply to samples of clusters selected in x-rays.

astro-ph;9911372	constraints on the structure of dark matter halos from the rotation  curves of low surface brightness galaxies	we re-examine the disk-halo decompositions of the rotation curves of lowsurface brightness (lsb) galaxies with v_max &gt; 80 km/s, taking full account ofthe effects of beam smearing. we show that the rotation curves of these lsbgalaxies are, contrary to previous claims, consistent with dark halos withsteep central cusps in their density distribution. in fact, the spatialresolution of the data is not sufficient to put any meaningful constraints onthe density profiles of their dark halos, or on cosmological parameters. thishas important implications for numerous claims made in the literature regardingthe halos of lsb galaxies, such as the self-similarity of their rotationcurves, and their inconsistency with certain cosmological models or with colddark matter altogether. only in one case is the data of sufficient spatialresolution to obtain reliable constraints on the slope of the central densitydistribution of the dark matter halo. for this single case, we find a centraldensity cusp with a slope 0.55 &lt; alpha &lt; 1.26 at the 99.73 percent confidencelevels. this contrasts strongly with the results for two dwarf galaxies (v_max&lt; 70 km/s) that we analyze, which yield alpha &lt; 0.5 at the same level ofconfidence. this possibly suggests that halos with constant density cores arerestricted to low-mass systems. we show that violent outflows of baryonicmatter by supernovae feedback can reproduce this mass-dependence of halo cuspslopes.

astro-ph;9912004	semi-analytical models for the formation of disk galaxies ii. dark  matter versus modified newtonian dynamics	we present detailed semi-analytical models for the formation of disk galaxiesboth in a universe dominated by dark matter (dm), and in one for which theforce law is given by modified newtonian dynamics (mond). we tune the models tofit the observed near-infrared tully-fisher (tf) relation, and compare numerouspredictions of the resulting models with observations. the dm and mond modelsare almost indistinguishable. they both yield gas mass fractions and dynamicalmass-to-light ratios which are in good agreement with observations. both modelsreproduce the narrow relation between global mass-to-light ratio and centralsurface brightness, and reveal a characteristic acceleration, contrary toclaims that these relations are not predicted by dm models. both models requiresn feedback in order to reproduce the lack of high surface brightness dwarfgalaxies. however, the introduction of feedback to the mond models steepens thetf relation and increases the scatter, making mond only marginally consistentwith observations. the most serious problem for the dm models is theirprediction of steep central rotation curves. however, the dm rotation curvesare only slightly steeper than those of mond, and are only marginallyinconsistent with the poor resolution data on lsb galaxies.

0810.0266	the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury ii. young stars and their relation  to halpha and uv emission timescales in the m81 outer disk	we have obtained resolved stellar photometry from hubble space telescope(hst) advanced camera for surveys (acs) observations of a field in the outerdisk of m81 as part of the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury (angst). motivatedby the recent discovery of extended uv (xuv) disks around many nearby spiralgalaxies, we use the observed stellar population to derive the recent starformation histories of five ~0.5 kpc-sized regions within this field. theseregions were selected on the basis of their uv luminosity from galex andinclude two hii regions, two regions which are uv-bright but halpha-faint, andone "control" region faint in both uv and halpha. we estimate our effective sfrdetection limit at ~2 x 10^-4 msun/yr, which is lower than that of galex forregions of this size. as expected, the hii regions contain massive mainsequence stars (in the mass range 18-27 msun, based on our best extinctionestimates), while similar massive main sequence stars are lacking in theuv-bright/halpha-faint regions. the observations are consistent with stellarages &lt;10 myr in the hii regions, and &gt;16 myr in the uv-bright/halpha-faintregions. all regions but the control have formed ~10^4 msun of stars over thepast ~65 myr. thus, our results, for at least one small area in the outer diskof m81, are consistent with an age difference being sufficient to explain theobserved discrepancy between star-forming regions detected in halpha and thosedetected exclusively in uv. however, our data cannot conclusively rule outother explanations, such as a strongly truncated initial mass function (imf).
