0901.1789	on the evolution of the molecular line profiles induced by the  propagation of c-shock waves	we present the first results of the expected variations of the molecular lineemission arising from material recently affected by c-shocks (shockprecursors). our parametric model of the structure of c-shocks has been coupledwith a radiative transfer code to calculate the molecular excitation and lineprofiles of shock tracers such as sio, and of ion and neutral molecules such ash13co+ and hn13c, as the shock propagates through the unperturbed medium. ourresults show that the sio emission arising from the early stage of the magneticprecursor typically has very narrow line profiles slightly shifted in velocitywith respect to the ambient cloud. this narrow emission is generated in theregion where the bulk of the ion fluid has already slipped to larger velocitiesin the precursor as observed toward the young l1448-mm outflow. this stronglysuggests that the detection of narrow sio emission and of an ion enhancement inyoung shocks, is produced by the magnetic precursor of c-shocks. in addition,our model shows that the different velocity components observed toward thisoutflow can be explained by the coexistence of different shocks at differentevolutionary stages, within the same beam of the single-dish observations.

0901.2471	time-dependent simulations of steady c-type shocks	using a time-dependent multifluid, magnetohydrodynamic code, we calculatedthe structure of steady perpendicular and oblique c-type shocks in dustyplasmas. we included relevant processes to describe mass transfer between thedifferent fluids, radiative cooling by emission lines and grain charging andstudied the effect of single-sized and multiple sized grains on the shockstructure. our models are the first of oblique fast-mode molecular shocks inwhich such a rigorous treatment of the dust grain dynamics has been combinedwith a self-consistent calculation of the thermal and ionisation structuresincluding appropriate microphysics. at low densities the grains do not play anysignificant role in the shock dynamics. at high densities, the ionisationfraction is sufficiently low that dust grains are important charge and currentcarriers and, thus, determine the shock structure. we find that the magneticfield in the shock front has a significant rotation out of the initial upstreamplane. this is most pronounced for single-sized grains and small angles of theshock normal with the magnetic field. our results are similar to previousstudies of steady c-type shocks showing that our method is efficient, rigorousand robust. unlike the method employed in the previous most detailed treatmentof dust in steady oblique fast-mode shocks, ours allows a reliable calculationeven when chemical or other conditions deviate from local statisticalequilibrium. we are also able to model transient phenomena.

0903.0159	linking pre- and proto-stellar objects in the intermediate-/high-mass  star forming region iras 05345+3157	to better understand the initial conditions of the high-mass star formationprocess, it is crucial to study at high-angular resolution the morphology, thekinematics, and eventually the interactions of the coldest condensationsassociated with intermediate-/high-mass star forming regions. the paper studiesthe cold condensations in the intermediate-/high-mass proto-cluster iras05345+3157, focusing the attention on the interaction with the other objects inthe cluster. we have performed millimeter high-angular resolution observations,both in the continuum and several molecular lines, with the pdbi and the sma.in a recent paper, we have already published part of these data. the mainfinding of that work was the detection of two cold and dense gaseouscondensations, called n and s (masses ~2 and ~9 m_sun), characterised by highvalues of the deuterium fractionation (~0.1 in both cores). in this paper, wepresent a full report of the observations, and a complete analysis of the dataobtained. the millimeter maps reveal the presence of 3 cores inside theinterferometers primary beam, called c1-a, c1-b and c2. none of them areassociated with cores n and s. c1-b is very likely associated with a newlyformed early-b zams star embedded inside a hot-core, while c1-a is more likelyassociated with a class 0 intermediate-mass protostar. the nature of c2 isunclear. both c1-a and c1-b are good candidates as driving sources of apowerful co outflow, which strongly interacts with n and s, as demonstrated bythe velocity gradient across both condensations. our major conclusion is thatthe chemical properties of these pre-stellar cores are similar to thoseobserved in low-mass isolated ones, while the kinematics is dominated by theturbulence triggered by the co outflow and can influece their evolution.

0903.1209	chemical differentiation in regions of high mass star formation ii.  molecular multiline and dust continuum studies of selected objects	the aim of this study is to investigate systematic chemical differentiationof molecules in regions of high mass star formation. we observed five prominentsites of high mass star formation in hcn, hnc, hco+, their isotopes, c18o, c34sand some other molecular lines, for some sources both at 3 and 1.3 mm and incontinuum at 1.3 mm. taking into account earlier obtained data for n2h+ wederive molecular abundances and physical parameters of the sources (mass,density, ionization fraction, etc.). the kinetic temperature is estimated fromch3c2h observations. then we analyze correlations between molecular abundancesand physical parameters and discuss chemical models applicable to thesespecies. the typical physical parameters for the sources in our sample are thefollowing: kinetic temperature in the range ~ 30-50 k (it is systematicallyhigher than that obtained from ammonia observations and is rather close to dusttemperature), masses from tens to hundreds solar masses, gas densities ~ 10^5cm^{-3}, ionization fraction ~ 10^{-7}. in most cases the ionization fractionslightly (a few times) increases towards the embedded ysos. the observed clumpsare close to gravitational equilibrium. there are systematic differences indistributions of various molecules. the abundances of co, cs and hcn are moreor less constant. there is no sign of co and/or cs depletion as in cold cores.at the same time the abundances of hco+, hnc and especially n2h+ strongly varyin these objects. they anti-correlate with the ionization fraction and as aresult decrease towards the embedded ysos. for n2h+ this can be explained bydissociative recombination to be the dominant destroying process. n2h+, hco+,and hnc are valuable indicators of massive protostars.

0706.4115	tmc-1c: an accreting starless core	we have mapped the starless core tmc-1c in a variety of molecular lines withthe iram 30m telescope. high density tracers show clear signs ofself-absorption and sub-sonic infall asymmetries are present in n2h+ (1-0) anddco+ (2-1) lines. the inward velocity profile in n2h+ (1-0) is extended over aregion of about 7,000 au in radius around the dust continuum peak, which is themost extended ``infalling'' region observed in a starless core with thistracer. the kinetic temperature (~12 k) measured from c17o and c18o suggeststhat their emission comes from a shell outside the colder interior traced bythe mm continuum dust. the c18o (2-1) excitation temperature drops from 12 k to~10 k away from the center. this is consistent with a volume density drop ofthe gas traced by the c18o lines, from ~4x10^4 cm^-3 towards the dust peak to~6x10^3 cm^-3 at a projected distance from the dust peak of 80" (or 11,000 au).the column density implied by the gas and dust show similar n2h+ and codepletion factors (f_d &lt; 6). this can be explained with a simple scenario inwhich: (i) the tmc-1c core is embedded in a relatively dense environment (h2~10^4 cm^-3), where co is mostly in the gas phase and the n2h+ abundance hadtime to reach equilibrium values; (ii) the surrounding material (rich in co andn2h+) is accreting onto the dense core nucleus; (iii) tmc-1c is older than3x10^5 yr, to account for the observed abundance of n2h+ across the core(~10^-10 w.r.t. h2); and (iv) the core nucleus is either much younger (~10^4yr) or ``undepleted'' material from the surrounding envelope has fallen towardsit in the past 10,000 yr.

0911.4912	transient evolution of c-type shocks in dusty regions of varying density	outflows of young stars drive shocks into dusty, molecular regions. mostmodels of such shocks assume that they are steady and propagating perpendicularto the magnetic field. real shocks often violate both of these assumptions andthe media through which they propagate are inhomogeneous. we use the codeemployed previously to produce the first time-dependent simulations offast-mode, oblique c-type shocks interacting with density perturbations. weinclude a self-consistent calculation of the thermal and ionisation balancesand a fluid treatment of grains. we identify features that develop when amultifluid shock encounters a density inhomogeneity to investigate whether anypart of the precursor region ever behaves in a quasi-steady fashion. if it doesthe shock may be modelled approximately without solving the time-dependenthydromagnetic equations. simulations were made for initially steady obliquec-type shocks encountering density inhomogeneities. for a semi-finiteinhomogeneity with a density larger than the surrounding medium, a transmittedshock evolves from being j-type to a steady c-type shock on a timescalecomparable to the ion-flow time through it. a sufficiently upstream part of theprecursor of an evolving j-type shock is quasi-steady. the ion-flow timescaleis also relevant for the evolution of a shock moving into a region ofdecreasing density. the models for shocks propagating into regions in which thedensity increases and then decreases to its initial value cannot be entirelydescribed in terms of the results obtained for monotonically increasing anddecreasing densities. for the latter model, the long-term evolution to a c-typeshock cannot be approximated by quasi-steady models.

0707.3335	molecular gas in qso host galaxies at z&gt;5	we present observations with the iram plateau de bure interferometer of threeqsos at z&gt;5 aimed at detecting molecular gas in their host galaxies as tracedby co transitions. co (5-4) is detected in sdssj033829.31+002156.3 at z=5.0267,placing it amongst the most distant sources detected in co. the co emission isunresolved with a beam size of ~1", implying that the molecular gas iscontained within a compact region, less than ~3kpc in radius. we infer an upperlimit on the dynamical mass of the co emitting region of ~3x10^10msun/sin(i)^2. the comparison with the black hole mass inferred from near-irdata suggests that the bh-to-bulge mass ratio in this galaxy is significantlyhigher than in local galaxies. from the co luminosity we infer a mass reservoirof molecular gas as high as m(h2)=2.4x10^10 msun, implying that the moleculargas accounts for a significant fraction of the dynamical mass. when compared tothe star formation rate derived from the far-ir luminosity, we infer a veryshort gas exhaustion timescale (~10^7 yrs), comparable to the dynamicaltimescale. co is not detected in the other two qsos (sdssj083643.85+005453.3and sdssj163033.90+401209.6) and upper limits are given for their molecular gascontent. when combined with co observations of other type 1 agns, spanning awide redshift range (0&lt;z&lt;6.4), we find that the host galaxy co luminosity(hence molecular gas content) and the agn optical luminosity (hence bhaccretion rate) are correlated, but the relation is not linear: l(co) ~[lambda*l_lambda(4400a)]^0.72. moreover, at high redshifts (and especially atz&gt;5) the co luminosity appears to saturate. we discuss the implications ofthese findings in terms of black hole-galaxy co-evolution.

1004.2822	chemical study of intermediate-mass (im) class 0 protostars. co  depletion and n2h+ deuteration	we are carrying out a physical and chemical study of the protostellarenvelopes in a representative sample of im class 0 protostars. in our firstpaper (crimier et al. 2010), we determined the physical structure(density-temperature radial profiles) of the protostellar envelopes. here, westudy the co depletion and n2h+ deuteration. we observed the millimeter linesof c18o, c17o, n2h+ and n2d+ toward the protostars using the iram 30mtelescope. based on these observations, we derived the c18o, n2h+ and n2d+radial abundance profiles across their envelopes using a radiative transfercode. in addition, we modeled the chemistry of the protostellar envelopes. allthe c18o 1-0 maps are well fit assuming that the c18o abundance decreasesinwards within the protostellar envelope until the gas and dust reach the coevaporation temperature, 20-25k, where the co is released back to the gasphase. the n2h+ deuterium fractionation in class 0 ims is[n2d+]/[n2h+]=0.005-0.014, two orders of magnitude higher than the elemental[d/h] value in the interstellar medium, but a factor of 10 lower than inpre-stellar clumps. chemical models account for the c18o and n2h+ observationsif we assume the co abundance is 2 times lower than the canonical value in theinner envelope. this could be the consequence of the co being converted intoch3oh on the grain surfaces prior to the evaporation and/or thephotodissociation of co by the stellar uv radiation. the deuteriumfractionation is not fitted by chemical models. this discrepancy is very likelycaused by the simplicity of our model that assumes spherical geometry andneglects important phenomena like the effect of bipolar outflows and uvradiation from the star. more important, the deuterium fractionation isdependent on the ortho-to-para h2 ratio, which is not likely to reach thesteady-state value in the dynamical time scales of these protostars.

1005.2031	origin of the hot gas in low-mass protostars: herschel-pacs spectroscopy  of hh 46	'water in star-forming regions with herschel' (wish) is a herschel keyprogramme aimed at understanding the physical and chemical structure of youngstellar objects (ysos) with a focus on water and related species. the low-massprotostar hh 46 was observed with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs) on the herschel space observatory to measure emission inh2o, co, oh, [oi], and [cii] lines located between 63 and 186 um. theexcitation and spatial distribution of emission can disentangle the differentheating mechanisms of ysos, with better spatial resolution and sensitivity thanpreviously possible. far-ir line emission is detected at the position of theprotostar and along the outflow axis. the oh emission is concentrated at thecentral position, co emission is bright at the central position and along theoutflow, and h2o emission is concentrated in the outflow. in addition, [oi]emission is seen in low-velocity gas, assumed to be related to the envelope,and is also seen shifted up to 170 km/s in both the red- and blue-shifted jets.envelope models are constructed based on previous observational constraints.they indicate that passive heating of a spherical envelope by the protostellarluminosity cannot explain the high-excitation molecular gas detected with pacs,including co lines with upper levels at &gt;2500 k above the ground state.instead, warm co and h2o emission is probably produced in the walls of anoutflow-carved cavity in the envelope, which are heated by uv photons andnon-dissociative c-type shocks. the bright oh and [oi] emission is attributedto j-type shocks in dense gas close to the protostar. in the scenario describedhere, the combined cooling by far-ir lines within the central spatial pixel isestimated to be 2 \times 10-2 l_sun, with 60-80% attributed to j- and c-typeshocks produced by interactions between the jet and the envelope.

1107.1984	interstellar ices as witnesses of star formation: selective deuteration  of water and organic molecules unveiled	observations of star forming environments revealed that the abundances ofsome deuterated interstellar molecules are markedly larger than the cosmic d/hratio of 10-5. possible reasons for this pointed to grain surface chemistry.how- ever, organic molecules and water, which are both ice constituents, do notenjoy the same deuteration. for example, deuterated formaldehyde is veryabundant in comets and star forming regions, while deuterated water rarely is.in this article, we explain this selective deuteration by following theformation of ices (using the rate equation method) in translucent clouds, aswell as their evolu- tion as the cloud collapses to form a star. ices startwith the deposition of gas phase co and o onto dust grains. while reaction ofoxygen with atoms (h or d) or molecules (h2) yields h2o (hdo), co only reactswith atoms (h and d) to form h2co (hdco, d2co). as a result, the deuteration offormaldehyde is sensitive to the gas d/h ratio as the cloud undergoesgravitational collapse, while the deuteration of water strongly depends on thedust temperature at the time of ice formation. these results reproduce well thedeuterium fractionation of formaldehyde observed in comets and star formingregions and can explain the wide spread of deuterium fractionation of waterobserved in these environments.

1107.2067	variability of the sio thermal line emission toward the young l1448-mm  outflow	the detection of narrow sio thermal emission toward young outflows has beenproposed to be a signature of the magnetic precursor of c-shocks. recentmodeling of the sio emission across c-shocks predicts variations in the sioline intensity and line shape at the precursor and intermediate-velocityregimes in only few years. we present high-angular resolution (3.8"x3.3")images of the thermal sio j=2-1 emission toward the l1448-mm outflow in twoepochs (november 2004-february 2005, march-april 2009). several siocondensations have appeared at intermediate velocities (20-50 km/s) toward thered-shifted lobe of the outflow since 2005. toward one of the condensations(clump d), systematic differences of the dirty beams between 2005 and 2009could be responsible for the sio variability. at higher velocities (50-80km/s), sio could also have experienced changes in its intensity. we proposethat the sio variability toward l1448-mm is due to a real sio enhancement byyoung c-shocks at the internal working surface between the jet and the ambientgas. for the precursor regime (5.2-9.2 km/s), several narrow and faint siocomponents are detected. narrow sio tends to be compact, transient and showselongated (bow-shock) morphologies perpendicular to the jet. we speculate thatthese features are associated with the precursor of c-shocks appearing at theinterface of the new sio components seen at intermediate velocities.

1107.3041	chemistry in a gravitationally unstable protoplanetary disc	until now, axisymmetric, alpha-disc models have been adopted for calculationsof the chemical composition of protoplanetary discs. while this approach isreasonable for many discs, it is not appropriate when self-gravity isimportant. in this case, spiral waves and shocks cause temperature and densityvariations that affect the chemistry. we have adopted a dynamical model of asolar-mass star surrounded by a massive (0.39 msun), self-gravitating disc,similar to those that may be found around class 0 and early class i protostars,in a study of disc chemistry. we find that for each of a number of species,e.g. h2o, adsorption and desorption dominate the changes in the gas-phasefractional abundance; because the desorption rates are very sensitive totemperature, maps of the emissions from such species should reveal thelocations of shocks of varying strengths. the gas-phase fractional abundancesof some other species, e.g. cs, are also affected by gas-phase reactions,particularly in warm shocked regions. we conclude that the dynamics of massivediscs have a strong impact on how they appear when imaged in the emission linesof various molecular species.

1204.0009	water in star-forming regions with herschel (wish): ii. evolution of 557  ghz 110-101 emission in low-mass protostars	(abridged) water is a key tracer of dynamics and chemistry in low-massprotostars, but spectrally resolved observations have so far been limited insensitivity and angular resolution. in this first systematic survey ofspectrally resolved water emission in low-mass protostellar objects, h2o wasobserved in the ground-state transition at 557 ghz with hifi on herschel in 29embedded class 0 and i protostars. complementary far-ir and sub-mm continuumdata (including pacs data from our program) are used to constrain the spectralenergy distribution of each source. h2o intensities are compared to inferredenvelope and outflow properties and co 3-2 emission. h2o emission is detectedin all objects except one. the line profiles are complex and consist of severalkinematic components. the profiles are typically dominated by a broad gaussianemission feature, indicating that the bulk of the water emission arises inoutflows, not the quiescent envelope. several sources show multiple shockcomponents in either emission or absorption, thus constraining the internalgeometry of the system. furthermore, the components include inverse p-cygniprofiles in 7 sources (6 class 0, 1 class i) indicative of infalling envelopes,and regular p-cygni profiles in 4 sources (3 class i, 1 class 0) indicative ofexpanding envelopes. "bullets" moving at &gt;50 km/s are seen in 4 class 0sources; 3 of these are new detections. in the outflow, the h2o/co abundanceratio as a function of velocity is nearly the same for all sources, increasingfrom 10^-3 at &lt;5 km/s to &gt;10^-1 at &gt;10 km/s. the h2o abundance in the outerenvelope is low, ~10^-10. the different h2o profile components show a clearevolutionary trend: in the class 0 sources, emission is dominated by outflowcomponents originating inside an infalling envelope. when the infall diminishesduring the class i phase, the outflow weakens and h2o emission disappears.

1204.0907	high co depletion in southern infrared-dark clouds	infrared-dark high-mass clumps are among the most promising objects to studythe initial conditions of the formation process of high-mass stars and richstellar clusters. in this work, we have observed the (3-2) rotationaltransition of c18o with the apex telescope, and the (1,1) and (2,2) inversiontransitions of nh3 with the australia telescope compact array in 21infrared-dark clouds already mapped in the 1.2 mm continuum, with the aim ofmeasuring basic chemical and physical parameters such as the co depletionfactor (fd), the gas kinetic temperature and the gas mass. in particular, thec18o (3-2) line allows us to derive fd in gas at densities higher than thattraced by the (1-0) and (2-1) lines, typically used in previous works. we havedetected nh3 and c18o in all targets. the clumps possess mass, h2 column andsurface densities consistent with being potentially the birthplace of high-massstars. we have measured fd in between 5 and 78, with a mean value of 32 and amedian of 29. these values are, to our knowledge, larger than the typical codepletion factors measured towards infrared-dark clouds and high-mass densecores, and are comparable to or larger than the values measured in low-masspre-stellar cores close to the onset of the gravitational collapse. this resultsuggests that the earliest phases of the high-mass star and stellar clusterformation process are characterised by fd larger than in low-mass pre-stellarcores. thirteen out of 21 clumps are undetected in the 24 {\mu}m spitzerimages, and have slightly lower kinetic temperatures, masses and h2 columndensities with respect to the eight spitzer-bright sources. this could indicatethat the spitzer-dark clumps are either less evolved or are going to form lessmassive objects.

1210.0804	upper limit for the d2h+ ortho-to-para ratio in the prestellar core  16293e (chess)	the h3+ ion plays a key role in the chemistry of dense interstellar gasclouds where stars and planets are forming. the low temperatures and highextinctions of such clouds make direct observations of h3+ impossible, but leadto large abundances of h2d+ and d2h+, which are very useful probes of the earlystages of star and planet formation. the ground-state rotational ortho-d2h+111-000 transition at 1476.6 ghz in the prestellar core 16293e has beensearched for with the herschel/hifi instrument, within the chess (chemicalherschel surveys of star forming regions) key program. the line has not beendetected at the 21 mk km/s level (3 sigma integrated line intensity). we usedthe ortho-h2d+ 110-111 transition and para-d2h+ 110-101 transition detected inthis source to determine an upper limit on the ortho-to-para d2h+ ratio as wellas the para-d2h+/ortho-h2d+ ratio from a non-lte analysis. the comparisonbetween our chemical modeling and the observations suggests that the codepletion must be high (larger than 100), with a density between 5e5 and 1e6cm-3. also the upper limit on the ortho-d2h+ line is consistent with a low gastemperature (~ 11 k) with a ortho-to-para ratio of 6 to 9, i.e. 2 to 3 timeshigher than the value estimated from the chemical modeling, making itimpossible to detect this high frequency transition with the present state ofthe art receivers.

1210.7178	mapping water in protostellar outflows with herschel: pacs and hifi  observations of l1448-c	we investigate on the spatial and velocity distribution of h2o along thel1448 outflow, its relationship with other tracers, and its abundancevariations, using maps of the o-h2o 1_{10}-1_{01} and 2_{12}-1_{01} transitionstaken with the herschel-hifi and pacs instruments, respectively. water emissionappears clumpy, with individual peaks corresponding to shock spots along theoutflow. the bulk of the 557 ghz line is confined to radial velocities in therange \pm 10-50 km/s but extended emission associated with the l1448-c extremehigh velocity (ehv) jet is also detected. the h2o 1_{10}-1_{01}/co(3-2) ratioshows strong variations as a function of velocity that likely reflect differentand changing physical conditions in the gas responsible for the emissions fromthe two species. in the ehv jet, a low h2o/sio abundance ratio is inferred,that could indicate molecular formation from dust free gas directly ejectedfrom the proto-stellar wind. we derive averaged tkin and n(h2) values of about300-500 k and 5 10^6 cm-3 respectively, while a water abundance with respect toh2 of the order of 0.5-1 10^{-6} along the outflow is estimated. the fairlyconstant conditions found all along the outflow implies that evolutionaryeffects on the timescales of outflow propagation do not play a major role inthe h2o chemistry. the results of our analysis show that the bulk of theobserved h2o lines comes from post-shocked regions where the gas, after beingheated to high temperatures, has been already cooled down to a few hundred k.the relatively low derived abundances, however, call for some mechanism todiminish the h2o gas in the post-shock region. among the possible scenarios, wefavor h2o photodissociation, which requires the superposition of a low velocitynon-dissociative shock with a fast dissociative shock able to produce a fuvfield of sufficient strength.

[oi] and some of the oh emission probe dissociative shocks in theinner envelope. the total far-infrared cooling is dominated by h2o and co, with[oi] increasing for class i sources.

1304.4031	hd depletion in starless cores	aims: we aim to investigate the abundances of light deuterium-bearing speciessuch as hd, h2d+ and d2h+ in a gas-grain chemical model including an extensivedescription of deuterium and spin state chemistry, in physical conditionsappropriate to the very centers of starless cores. methods: we combine agas-grain chemical model with radiative transfer calculations to simulatedensity and temperature structure in starless cores. the chemical modelincludes deuterated forms of species with up to 4 atoms and the spin states ofthe light species h2, h2+ and h3+ and their deuterated forms. results: we findthat hd eventually depletes from the gas phase because deuterium is efficientlyincorporated to grain-surface hdo, resulting in inefficient hd production ongrains. hd depletion has consequences not only on the abundances of e.g. h2d+and d2h+, whose production depends on the abundance of hd, but also on the spinstate abundance ratios of the various light species, when compared with thecomplete depletion model where heavy elements do not influence the chemistry.conclusions: while the eventual hd depletion leads to the disappearance oflight deuterium-bearing species from the gas phase in a relatively shorttimescale at high density, we find that at late stages of core evolution theabundances of h2d+ and d2h+ increase toward the core edge and the disributionsbecome extended. the hd depletion timescale increases if less oxygen isinitially present in the gas phase, owing to chemical interaction between thegas and the dust predecing the starless core phase. our results are greatlyaffected if h2 is allowed to tunnel on grain surfaces, and therefore moreexperimental data not only on tunneling but also on the o + h2 surface reactionin particular is needed.

1308.6478	broad n2h+ emission towards the protostellar shock l1157-b1	we present the first detection of n2h+ towards a low-mass protostellaroutflow, namely the l1157-b1 shock, at about 0.1 pc from the protostellarcocoon. the detection was obtained with the iram 30-m antenna. we observedemission at 93 ghz due to the j = 1-0 hyperfine lines. the analysis of theemission coupled with the hifi chess multiline co observations leads to theconclusion that the observed n2h+(1-0) line originates from the dense (&gt; 10^5cm-3) gas associated with the large (20-25 arcsec) cavities opened by theprotostellar wind. we find a n2h+ column density of few 10^12 cm-2corresponding to an abundance of (2-8) 10^-9. the n2h+ abundance can be matchedby a model of quiescent gas evolved for more than 10^4 yr, i.e. for more thanthe shock kinematical age (about 2000 yr). modelling of c-shocks confirms thatthe abundance of n2h+ is not increased by the passage of the shock. in summary,n2h+ is a fossil record of the pre-shock gas, formed when the density of thegas was around 10^4 cm-3, and then further compressed and accelerated by theshock.

0802.0594	parametrization of c-shocks. evolution of the sputtering of grains	context: the detection of narrow sio lines toward the young shocks of thel1448-mm outflow has been interpreted as a signature of the magnetic precursorof c-shocks. in contrast with the low sio abundances (&lt;10e-12) in the ambientgas, the narrow sio emission at almost ambient velocities reveals enhanced sioabundances of 10e-11. this enhancement has been proposed to be produced by thesputtering of the grain mantles at the first stages of c-shocks. however,modelling of the sputtering of grains has usually averaged the sio abundancesover the dissipation region of c-shocks, which cannot explain the recentobservations. aims: to model the evolution of the gas phase abundances of sio,ch3oh and h2o, produced by the sputtering of grains as the shock propagatesthrough the ambient gas. methods: we propose a parametric model to describe thephysical structure of c-shocks as a function of time. using the knownsputtering yields for water mantles (with minor constituents like silicon andch3oh) and olivine cores by collisions with h2, he, c, o, si, fe and co, wefollow the evolution of the abundances of silicon, ch3oh and h2o ejected fromgrains. results: the evolution of these abundances shows that co seems to bethe most efficient sputtering agent in low velocity shocks. the velocitythreshold for the sputtering of silicon from the grain mantles is reduced by5-10 km s-1 by co compared to other models. the sputtering by co can generatesio abundances of 10e-11 at the early stages of low velocity shocks, consistentwith those observed in the magnetic precursor of l1448-mm. our model alsosatisfactorily reproduce the progressive enhancement of sio, ch3oh and h2oobserved in this outflow by the coexistence of two shocks with vs=30 and60kms-1 within the same region.

1312.0944	alma observations of cool dust in a low-metallicity starburst,  sbs0335-052	we present atacama large millimeter/submillimeter array (alma) cycle 0 band 7observations of an extremely metal-poor dwarf starburst galaxy in the localuniverse, sbs0335-052 (12+log(o/h)~7.2). with these observations, dust isdetected at 870micron (alma band 7), but 87% of the flux in this band is due tofree-free emission from the starburst. we have compiled a spectral energydistribution (sed) of sbs0335-052 that spans almost 6 orders of magnitude inwavelength and fit it with a spherical dust shell heated by a single-agestellar population; the best-fit model gives a dust mass of (3.8+/-0.6)x10^4msun. we have also constructed a sed including herschel archival data forizw18, another low-metallicity dwarf starburst (12+log(o/h)=7.17), and fit itwith a similar model to obtain a dust mass of (3.4+/-1.0)x10^2 msun. comparedwith their atomic gas mass, the dust mass of sbs0335-052 far exceeds theprediction of a linear trend of dust-to-gas mass ratio with metallicity, whileizw18 falls far below. we use gas scaling relations to assess a putativemissing gas component in both galaxies and find that the missing, possiblymolecular, gas in sbs0335-052 is a factor of 6 times higher than the valueinferred from the observed hi column density; in izw18 the missing component is4 times smaller. ultimately, despite their similarly low metallicity, thedifferences in gas and dust column densities in sbs0335-052 and izw18 suggestthat metal abundance does not uniquely define star-formation processes. at somelevel, self-shielding and the survival of molecules may depend just as much ongas and dust column density as on metallicity. the effects of low metallicitymay at least be partially compensated for by large column densities in theinterstellar medium.

1401.2347	gas kinematics and excitation in the filamentary irdc g035.39-00.33	some theories of dense molecular cloud formation involve dynamicalenvironments driven by converging atomic flows or collisions betweenpreexisting molecular clouds. the determination of the dynamics and physicalconditions of the gas in clouds at the early stages of their evolution isessential to establish the dynamical imprints of such collisions, and to inferthe processes involved in their formation. we present multi-transition 13co andc18o maps toward the irdc g035.39-00.33, believed to be at the earliest stagesof evolution. the 13co and c18o gas is distributed in three filaments(filaments 1, 2 and 3), where the most massive cores are preferentially foundat the intersecting regions between them. the filaments have a similarkinematic structure with smooth velocity gradients of ~0.4-0.8 km s-1 pc-1.several scenarios are proposed to explain these gradients, including cloudrotation, gas accretion along the filaments, global gravitational collapse, andunresolved sub-filament structures. these results are complemented by hco+,hnc, h13co+ and hn13c single-pointing data to search for gas infall signatures.the 13co and c18o gas motions are supersonic across g035.39-00.33, with theemission showing broader linewidths toward the edges of the irdc. this could bedue to energy dissipation at the densest regions in the cloud. the average h2densities are ~5000-7000 cm-3, with filaments 2 and 3 being denser and moremassive than filament 1. the c18o data unveils three regions with high codepletion factors (f_d~5-12), similar to those found in massive starless cores.

0802.3319	the role of carbon grains in the deuteration of h2	aims: the production of molecular hydrogen and its deuterated forms ontocarbonaceous dust grains is investigated in detail. the goal of this study isto estimate the importance of the chemistry occuring on grain surfaces for thedeuteration of h2. furthermore, we aim to find a robust and general surfacechemical model which can be used in different astrophysical environments.methods: surface processes are described for the cases of graphitic andamorphous--carbon grains, where laboratory work is available.langmuir--hinshelwood as well as eley--rideal surface chemistries are includedin the model and their relative contributions are highlighted. analyticexpressions are derived for h2, hd, and d2 formation efficiencies for both typeof grains. rate equations are tested against stochastic methods. results: asexpected, rate equations and stochastic methods diverge for grain sizes lowerthan a critical value acrit. for grain sizes below this critical value, d2formation decreases to favour hd formation. the formation efficiencies of h2and d2 can be calculated by adding a correction factor to the rate equationsmethods. we found that because of the presence of chemisorbed sites, which canstore atoms to form molecules up to high grain temperatures, the formationefficiency of hd and d2 is very high compared to models where onlyphysisorption sites are taken into account. when considering a realisticdistribution of dust grains, we found that the formation rate of h2 and hd isenhanced by an order of magnitude if small grains are taken into account. theprocesses described in this paper, that allow a strong enhancement of thedeuterated forms of molecular hydrogen, could explain the high degree ofdeuterium fractionation observed in protostellar environments.

1409.5704	water in star-forming regions with herschel (wish) v. the physical  conditions in low-mass protostellar outflows revealed by multi-transition  water observations	context: outflows are an important part of the star formation process as boththe result of ongoing active accretion and one of the main sources ofmechanical feedback on small scales. water is the ideal tracer of these effectsbecause it is present in high abundance in various parts of the protostar.method: we present \textit{herschel} hifi spectra of multiple water-transitionstowards 29 nearby class 0/i protostars as part of the wish survey. these aredecomposed into different gaussian components, with each related to one ofthree parts of the protostellar system; quiescent envelope, cavity shock andspot shocks in the jet and at the base of the outflow. we then constrain theexcitation conditions present in the two outflow-related components. results:water emission is optically thick but effectively thin, with line ratios thatdo not vary with velocity, in contrast to co. the physical conditions of thecavity and spot shocks are similar, with post-shock h$_{2}$ densities of order10$^{5}-$10$^{8}$\,cm$^{-3}$ and h$_{2}$o column densities of order10$^{16}-$10$^{18}$\,cm$^{-2}$. h$_{2}$o emission originates in compactemitting regions: for the spot shocks these correspond to point sources withradii of order 10-200\,au, while for the cavity shocks these come from a thinlayer along the outflow cavity wall with thickness of order 1-30\,au.conclusions: water emission at the source position traces two distinctkinematic components in the outflow; j shocks at the base of the outflow or inthe jet, and c shocks in a thin layer in the cavity wall. class i sources havesimilar excitation conditions to class 0 sources, but generally smallerline-widths and emitting region sizes. we suggest that it is the velocity ofthe wind driving the outflow, rather than the decrease in envelope density ormass, that is the cause of the decrease in h$_{2}$o intensity between class 0and i.

1410.7232	deuteration and evolution in the massive star formation process: the  role of surface chemistry	an ever growing number of observational and theoretical evidence suggeststhat the deuterated fraction (column density ratio between a species containingd and its hydrogenated counterpart, dfrac) is an evolutionary indicator both inthe low- and the high-mass star formation process. however, the role of surfacechemistry in these studies has not been quantified from an observational pointof view. in order to compare how the deuterated fractions of species formedonly in the gas and partially or uniquely on grain surfaces evolve with time,we observed rotational transitions of ch3oh, 13ch3oh, ch2doh, ch3od at 3 and1.3~mm, and of nh2d at 3~mm with the iram-30m telescope, and the inversiontransitions (1,1) and (2,2) of nh3 with the gbt, towards most of the coresalready observed by fontani et al.~(2011, 2014) in n2h+, n2d+, hnc, dnc. nh2dis detected in all but two cores, regardless of the evolutionary stage.dfrac(nh3) is on average above 0.1, and does not change significantly from theearliest to the most evolved phases, although the highest average value isfound in the protostellar phase (~0.3). few lines of ch2doh and ch3od areclearly detected, and only towards protostellar cores or externally heatedstarless cores. this work clearly confirms an expected different evolutionarytrend of the species formed exclusively in the gas (n2d+ and n2h+) and thoseformed partially (nh2d and nh3) or totally (ch2doh and ch3oh) on grain mantles.the study also reinforces the idea that dfrac(n2h+) is the best tracer ofmassive starless cores, while high values of dfrac(ch3oh) seem rather goodtracers of the early protostellar phases, at which the evaporation/sputteringof the grain mantles is most efficient.

1412.8611	complex organic molecules in protostellar environments in the ska era	molecular complexity builds up at each step of the sun-like star formationprocess, starting from simple molecules and ending up in large polyatomicspecies. complex organic molecules (coms; such as methyl formate, hcooch$_3$,dymethyl ether, ch$_3$och$_3$, formamide, nh$_2$cho, or glycoaldehyde,hcoch$_2$oh) are formed in all the components of the star formation recipe(e.g. pre-stellar cores, hot-corinos, circumstellar disks, shocks induced byfast jets), due to ice grain mantle sublimation or sputtering as well asgas-phase reactions. understanding in great detail the involved processes islikely the only way to predict the ultimate molecular complexity reached in theism, as the detection of large molecules is increasingly more difficult withthe increase of the number of atoms constituting them.  thanks to the recent spectacular progress of astronomical observations, dueto the herschel (sub-mm and ir), iram and sma (mm and sub-mm), and nrao (cm)telescopes, an enormous activity is being developed in the field ofastrochemistry, extending from astronomical observatories to chemicallaboratories. we are involved in several observational projects providingunbiased spectral surveys (in the 80-300 and 500-2000 ghz ranges) withunprecedented sensitivity of templates of dense cores and protostars. forestsof com lines have been detected. in this chapter we will focus on the chemistryof both cold prestellar cores and hot shocked regions, (i) reviewing resultsand open questions provided by mm-fir observations, and (ii) showing the needof carrying on the observations of coms at lower frequencies, where ska willoperate. we will also emphasize the importance of analysing the spectra by thelight of the experimental studies performed by our team, who is investigatingthe chemical effects induced by ionising radiation bombarding astrophysicallyrelevant ices.

1501.04825	benchmarking spin-state chemistry in starless core models	aims. we aim to present simulated chemical abundance profiles for a varietyof important species, with special attention given to spin-state chemistry, inorder to provide reference results against which present and future models canbe compared. methods. we employ gas-phase and gas-grain models to investigatechemical abundances in physical conditions corresponding to starless cores. tothis end, we have developed new chemical reaction sets for both gas-phase andgrain-surface chemistry, including the deuterated forms of species with up tosix atoms and the spin-state chemistry of light ions and of the speciesinvolved in the ammonia and water formation networks. the physical model iskept simple in order to facilitate straightforward benchmarking of other modelsagainst the results of this paper. results. we find that the ortho/para ratiosof ammonia and water are similar in both gas-phase and gas-grain models, atlate times in particular, implying that the ratios are determined by gas-phaseprocesses. we derive late-time ortho/para ratios of ~0.5 and ~1.6 for ammoniaand water, respectively. we find that including or excluding deuterium in thecalculations has little effect on the abundances of non-deuterated species andon the ortho/para ratios of ammonia and water, especially in gas-phase modelswhere deuteration is naturally hindered owing to the presence of abundant heavyelements. although we study a rather narrow temperature range (10-20 k), wefind strong temperature dependence in, e.g., deuteration and nitrogenchemistry. for example, the depletion timescale of ammonia is significantlyreduced when the temperature is increased from 10 to 20 k; this is because theincrease in temperature translates into increased accretion rates, while thevery high binding energy of ammonia prevents it from being desorbed at 20 k.

1503.00719	mid-j co shock tracing observations of infrared dark clouds i	infrared dark clouds (irdcs) are dense, molecular structures in theinterstellar medium that can harbour sites of high-mass star formation. irdcscontain supersonic turbulence, which is expected to generate shocks thatlocally heat pockets of gas within the clouds. we present observations of theco j = 8-7, 9-8, and 10-9 transitions, taken with the herschel spaceobservatory, towards four dense, starless clumps within irdcs (c1 ing028.37+00.07, f1 and f2 in g034.43+0007, and g2 in g034.77-0.55). we detectthe co j = 8-7 and 9-8 transitions towards three of the clumps (c1, f1, and f2)at intensity levels greater than expected from photodissociation region (pdr)models. the average ratio of the 8-7 to 9-8 lines is also found to be between1.6 and 2.6 in the three clumps with detections, significantly smaller thanexpected from pdr models. these low line ratios and large line intensitiesstrongly suggest that the c1, f1, and f2 clumps contain a hot gas component notaccounted for by standard pdr models. such a hot gas component could begenerated by turbulence dissipating in low velocity shocks.

1503.05012	impulsive spot heating and thermal explosion of interstellar grains  revisited	the problem of impulsive heating of dust grains in cold, dense interstellarclouds is revisited theoretically, with the aim to better understand leadingmechanisms of the explosive desorption of icy mantles. it is rigorously shownthat if the heating of a reactive medium occurs within a sufficiently localizedspot (e.g., heating of mantles by cosmic rays), then the subsequent thermalevolution is characterized by a single dimensionless number $\lambda$. thisnumber identifies a bifurcation between two distinct regimes: when $\lambda$exceeds a critical value (threshold), the heat equation exhibits the explosivesolution, i.e., the thermal (chemical) explosion is triggered. otherwise,thermal diffusion causes the deposited heat to spread over the entire grain --this regime is commonly known as the whole-grain heating. the theory allows usto find a critical combination of the physical parameters that govern theexplosion of icy mantles due to impulsive spot heating. in particular, thecalculations suggest that heavy cosmic ray species (e.g., iron ions) collidingwith dust are able to trigger the explosion. based on the recently calculatedlocal cosmic-ray spectra, the expected rate of the explosive desorption isestimated. the efficiency of the desorption, which affects all solid speciesindependent of their binding energy, is shown to be comparable with othercosmic-ray desorption mechanisms typically considered in the literature. also,the theory allows us to estimate maximum abundances of reactive species thatmay be stored in the mantles, which provides important constraints on availableastrochemical models.

1506.05180	first measurements of 15n fractionation in n2h+ toward high-mass star  forming cores	we report on the first measurements of the isotopic ratio 14n/15n in n2h+toward a statistically significant sample of high-mass star forming cores. thesources belong to the three main evolutionary categories of the high-mass starformation process: high-mass starless cores, high-mass protostellar objects,and ultracompact hii regions. simultaneous measurements of 14n/15n in cn havebeen made. the 14n/15n ratios derived from n2h+ show a large spread (from ~180up to ~1300), while those derived from cn are in between the value measured inthe terrestrial atmosphere (~270) and that of the proto-solar nebula (~440) forthe large majority of the sources within the errors. however, this differentspread might be due to the fact that the sources detected in the n2h+isotopologues are more than those detected in the cn ones. the 14n/15n ratiodoes not change significantly with the source evolutionary stage, whichindicates that time seems to be irrelevant for the fractionation of nitrogen.we also find a possible anticorrelation between the 14n/15n (as derived fromn2h+) and the h/d isotopic ratios. this suggests that 15n enrichment could notbe linked to the parameters that cause d enrichment, in agreement with theprediction by recent chemical models. these models, however, are not able toreproduce the observed large spread in 14n/15n, pointing out that someimportant routes of nitrogen fractionation could be still missing in themodels.

1507.02856	spin-state chemistry of deuterated ammonia	aims. we aim to develop a chemical model that contains a consistentdescription of spin-state chemistry in reactions involving chemical specieswith multiple deuterons. we apply the model to the specific case of deuteratedammonia, to derive values for the various spin-state ratios.  methods. we apply symmetry rules in the complete scrambling assumption tocalculate branching ratio tables for reactions between chemical species thatinclude multiple protons and/or deuterons. reaction sets for both gas-phase andgrain-surface chemistry are generated using an automated routine that forms allpossible spin-state variants of any given reaction with up to six h/d atoms.single-point and modified bonnor-ebert models are used to study the density andtemperature dependence of ammonia and its isotopologs, and the associatedspin-state ratios.  results. we find that the spin-state ratios of the ammonia isotopologs are,at late times, very different from their statistical values. the ratios arerather insensitive to variations in the density, but present strong temperaturedependence. we derive high peak values ($\sim$ 0.1) for the deuterium fractionin ammonia, in agreement with previous (gas-phase) models. the deuteriumfractionation is strongest at high density, corresponding to a high degree ofdepletion, and also presents temperature dependence. we find that in thetemperature range 5 to 20 k, the deuterium fractionation peaks at $\sim$ 15 kwhile most of the ortho/para (and meta/para for $\rm nd_3$) ratios present aminimum at 10 k (ortho/para $\rm nh_2d$ has instead a maximum at thistemperature).  conclusions. owing to the density and temperature dependence found in theabundances and spin-state ratios of ammonia and its isotopologs, it is evidentthat observations of ammonia and its deuterated forms can provide importantconstraints on the physical structure of molecular clouds.

1508.00773	gravitational instabilities in a protosolar-like disc i: dynamics and  chemistry	to date, most simulations of the chemistry in protoplanetary discs have used1+1d or 2d axisymmetric $\alpha$-disc models to determine chemical compositionswithin young systems. this assumption is inappropriate for non-axisymmetric,gravitationally unstable discs, which may be a significant stage in earlyprotoplanetary disc evolution. using 3d radiative hydrodynamics, we havemodelled the physical and chemical evolution of a 0.17 m$_{\odot}$self-gravitating disc over a period of 2000 yr. the 0.8 m$_{\odot}$ centralprotostar is likely to evolve into a solar-like star, and hence this class 0 orearly class i young stellar object may be analogous to our early solar system.shocks driven by gravitational instabilities enhance the desorption rates,which dominate the changes in gas-phase fractional abundances for most species.we find that at the end of the simulation, a number of species distinctly tracethe spiral structure of our relatively low-mass disc, particularly cn. wecompare our simulation to that of a more massive disc, and conclude that massdifferences between gravitationally unstable discs may not have a strong impacton the chemical composition. we find that over the duration of our simulation,successive shock heating has a permanent effect on the abundances of hno, cnand nh$_3$, which may have significant implications for both simulations andobservations. we also find that hco$^+$ may be a useful tracer of disc mass. weconclude that gravitational instabilities induced in lower mass discs cansignificantly, and permanently, affect the chemical evolution, and thatobservations with high-resolution instruments such as alma offer a promisingmeans of characterising gravitational instabilities in protosolar discs.

1509.04870	molecular depletion times and the co-to-h2 conversion factor in  metal-poor galaxies	tracing molecular hydrogen content with carbon monoxide in low-metallicitygalaxies has been exceedingly difficult. here we present a new effort, withiram 30-m observations of 12co(1-0) of a sample of 8 dwarf galaxies havingoxygen abundances ranging from 12+logo/h=7.7 to 8.4. co emission is detected inall galaxies, including the most metal-poor galaxy of our sample (0.1 zsun); toour knowledge this is the largest number of 12co(1-0) detections ever reportedfor galaxies with 12+logo/h&lt;=8 (0.2 zsun) outside the local group. we calculatestellar masses (mstar) and star-formation rates (sfrs), and analyze our resultsby combining our observations with galaxy samples from the literature.extending previous results for a correlation of the molecular gas depletiontime, tau(dep), with mstar and specific sfr (ssfr), we find a variation intau(dep) of a factor of 200 or more (from &lt;50 myr to 10 gyr) over a spread of1000 in ssfr and mstar. we exploit the variation of tau(dep) to constrain theco-to-h2 mass conversion factor alpha(co) at low metallicity, and assuming apower-law variation find alpha(co) \propto (z/zsun)^1.9, similar to resultsbased on dust continuum measurements compared with gas mass. by including himeasurements, we show that the fraction of total gas mass relative to thebaryonic mass is higher in galaxies that are metal poor, of low mass, and ofhigh ssfr. finally, comparisons of the data with star-formation models of themolecular gas phases suggest that, at metallicities z/zsun&lt;=0.2, there are somediscrepancies with model predictions.

1511.06696	how chemistry influences cloud structure, star formation, and the imf	in the earliest phases of star-forming clouds, stable molecular species, suchas co, are important coolants in the gas phase. depletion of these molecules ondust surfaces affects the thermal balance of molecular clouds and with thattheir whole evolution. for the first time, we study the effect of grain surfacechemistry (gsc) on star formation and its impact on the initial mass function(imf). we follow a contracting translucent cloud in which we treat thegas-grain chemical interplay in detail, including the process of freeze-out. weperform 3d hydrodynamical simulations under three different conditions, a puregas-phase model, a freeze-out model, and a complete chemistry model. the modelsdisplay different thermal evolution during cloud collapse. the equation ofstate (eos) of the gas becomes softer with co freeze-out and the results showthat at the onset of star formation, the cloud retains its evolution historysuch that the number of formed stars differ (by 7%) between the three models.while the stellar mass distribution results in a different imf when we considerpure freeze-out, with the complete treatment of the gsc, the divergence from apure gas-phase model is minimal. we find that the impact of freeze-out isbalanced by the non-thermal processes; chemical and photodesorption. we alsofind an average filament width of 0.12 pc ($\pm$0.03 pc), and speculate thatthis may be a result from the changes in the eos caused by the gas-dust thermalcoupling. we conclude that gsc plays a big role in the chemical composition ofmolecular clouds and that surface processes are needed to accurately interpretobservations, however, that gsc does not have a significant impact as far asstar formation and the imf is concerned.

1512.02629	stratified nh and nd emission in the prestellar core 16293e in l1689n	high degrees of deuterium fractionation are commonly found in cold prestellarcores and in the envelopes around young protostars. as it brings strongconstraints to chemical models, deuterium chemistry is often used to infer corehistory or molecule formation pathways. whereas a large number of observationsis available regarding interstellar deuterated stable molecules, relativelylittle is known about the deuteration of hydride radicals, as their fundamentalrotational transitions are at high frequencies where the atmosphere is mostlyopaque. nitrogen hydride radicals are important species in nitrogen chemistry,as they are thought to be related to ammonia formation. observations have shownthat ammonia is strongly deuterated, with [nh2d]/[nh3] ~ 10%. models predictsimilarly high [nd]/[nh] ratios, but so far only one observationaldetermination of this ratio is available, towards the envelope of the protostariras16293-2422. in order to test model predictions, we aim here at determining[nd]/[nh] in a dense, starless core. we observed nh and nd in 16293e with thehifi spectrometer on board the herschel space observatory as part of the chessguaranteed time key programme, and derived the abundances of these two speciesusing a non-lte non-local radiative transfer model. both nh and nd are detectedin the source, with nd in emission and nh in absorption against the continuumarising from the cold dust emission. our model shows however that the ndemission and the nh absorption originate from different layers in the cloud, asfurther evidenced by their different velocities. in the central region of thecore, we can set a lower limit to the [nd]/[nh] ratio of ~2%. this estimate isconsistent with recent pure gas-phase models of nitrogen chemistry

0807.1465	dust in interstellar clouds, evolved stars and supernovae	outflows of pre-main-sequence stars drive shocks into molecular materialwithin 0.01 - 1 pc of the young stars. the shock-heated gas emits infrared,millimeter and submillimeter lines of many species including. dust grains areimportant charge carriers and play a large role in coupling the magnetic fieldand flow of neutral gas. some effects of the dust on the dynamics of obliqueshocks began to emerge in the 1990s. however, detailed models of these shocksare required for the calculation of the grain sputtering contribution to gasphase abundances of species producing observed emissions. we are developingsuch models. some of the molecular species introduced into the gas phase bysputtering in shocks or by thermally driven desorption in hot cores form ongrain surfaces. recently laboratory studies have begun to contribute to theunderstanding of surface reactions and thermally driven desorption importantfor the chemistry of star forming clouds. dusty plasmas are prevalent in manyevolved stars just as well as in star forming regions. radiation pressure ondust plays a significant role in mass loss from some post-main-sequence stars.the mechanisms leading to the formation of carbonaceous dust in the stellaroutflows are similar to those important for soot formation in flames. however,nucleation in oxygen-rich outflows is less well understood and remains achallenging research area. dust is observed in supernova ejecta that have notpassed through the reverse shocks that develop in the interaction of ejectawith ambient media. dust is detected in high redshift galaxies that aresufficiently young that the only stars that could have produced the dust wereso massive that they became supernovae. consequently, the issue of the survivalof dust in strong supernova shocks is of considerable interest.

astro-ph;0109023	molecular ions in l1544. ii. the ionization degree	the maps presented in paper i are here used to infer the variation of thecolumn densities of hco+, dco+, n2h+, and n2d+ as a function of distance fromthe dust peak. these results are interpreted with the aid of a crude chemicalmodel which predicts the abundances of these species as a function of radius ina spherically symmetric model with radial density distribution inferred fromthe observations of dust emission at millimeter wavelengths and dust absorptionin the infrared. our main observational finding is that the n(n2d+)/n(n2h+)column density ratio is of order 0.2 towards the l1544 dust peak as compared ton(dco+)/n(hco+) = 0.04. we conclude that this result as well as the generalfinding that n2h+ and n2d+ correlate well with the dust is caused by co beingdepleted to a much higher degree than molecular nitrogen in the high densitycore of l1544. depletion also favors deuterium enhancement and thus n2d+, whichtraces the dense and highly co-depleted core nucleus, is much more enhancedthan dco+. our models do not uniquely define the chemistry in the high densitydepleted nucleus of l1544 but they do suggest that the ionization degree is afew times 10^{-9} and that the ambipolar diffusion time scale is locallysimilar to the free fall time. it seems likely that the lower limit which oneobtains to ionization degree by summing all observable molecular ions is not agreat underestimate of the true ionization degree. we predict that atomicoxygen is abundant in the dense core and, if so, h3o+ may be the main ion inthe central highly depleted region of the core.

astro-ph;0112487	systematic molecular differentiation in starless cores	(abridged) we present evidence that low-mass starless cores, the simplestunits of star formation, are systematically differentiated in their chemicalcomposition. molecules including co and cs almost vanish near the core centers,where the abundance decreases by one or two orders of magnitude. at the sametime, n2h+ has a constant abundance, and the fraction of nh3 increases towardthe core center. our conclusions are based on a study of 5 mostly-roundstarless cores (l1498, l1495, l1400k, l1517b, and l1544), which we havemappedin c18o(1-0), c17o(1-0), cs(2-1), c34s(2-1), n2h+(1-0), nh3(1,1) and(2,2), and the 1.2 mm continuum. for each core we have built a model that fitssimultaneously the radial profile of all observed emission and the centralspectrum for the molecular lines. the observed abundance drops of co and cs arenaturally explained by the depletion of these molecules onto dust grains atdensities of 2-6 10^4 cm-3. n2h+ seems unaffected by this process up todensities of several 10^5, while the nh3 abundance may be enhanced by reactionstriggered by the disappearance of co from the gas phase. with the help of ourmodels, we show that chemical differentiation automatically explains thediscrepancy between the sizes of cs and nh3 maps, a problem which has remainedunexplained for more than a decade. our models, in addition, show that acombination of radiative transfer effects can give rise to the previouslyobserved discrepancy in the linewidth of these two tracers. although thisdiscrepancy has been traditionally interpreted as resulting from a systematicincrease of the turbulent linewidth with radius, our models show that it canarise in conditions of constant gas turbulence.

astro-ph;0204313	the structure of molecular clumps around high-mass young stellar objects	we have used the iram 30-m and fcrao 14-m telescopes to observe the molecularclumps associated with 12 ultracompact (uc) hii regions in the j=6-5, 8-7 and13-12 rotational transitions of methyl-acetylene (ch3c2h). under the assumptionof lte and optically thin emission, we have derived temperature estimatesranging from 30 to 56 k. we estimate that the clumps have diameters of 0.2-1.6pc, h_2 densities of 10^5-10^6 {cm^{-3}}, and masses of 10^2-2 10^4 m_\odot. wecompare these values with those obtained by other authors from differentmolecular tracers and find that the h_2 density and the temperature inside theclumps vary respectively like n_{h_2} ~ r^{-2.6} and t ~ r^{-0.5}, with rdistance from the centre. we also find that the virial masses of the clumps are~3 times less than those derived from the ch3c2h column densities: we show thata plausible explanation is that magnetic fields play an important role tostabilise the clumps, which are on the verge of gravitational collapse.finally, we show that the ch3c2h line width increases for decreasing distancefrom the clump centre: this effect is consistent with infall in the innerregions of the clumps. we conclude that the clumps around uc hii regions arelikely to be transient (~10^(5) yr) entities, remnants of isothermal spherescurrently undergoing gravitational collapse: the high mass accretion rates(~10^{-2} m_\odot yr^{-1}) lead to massive star formation at the centre of suchclumps.

astro-ph;0304469	n2h+(1-0) survey of massive molecular cloud cores	we present the results of n2h+(1-0) observations of 35 dense molecular cloudcores from the northern and southern hemispheres where massive stars and starclusters are formed. line emission has been detected in 33 sources, for 28sources detailed maps have been obtained. the optical depth of (23-12)component toward peak intensity positions of 10 sources is ~ 0.2-1. in total,47 clumps have been revealed in 26 sources. integrated intensity maps withaspect ratios &lt; 2 have been fitted with a power-law radial distribution$r^{-p}$ convolved with the telescope beam. mean power-law index is close tounity corresponding to the $\sim r^{-2}$ density profile provided n2h+excitation conditions do not vary inside these regions. line widths of thecores either decrease or stay constant with distance from the center. the ratioof rotational to gravitational energy is too low for rotation to play asignificant role in the dynamics of the cores. a correlation between mean linewidths and sizes of clumps has been found.

astro-ph;0401148	on the internal structure of starless cores. i. physical conditions and  the distribution of co, cs, n2h+, and nh3 in l1498 and l1517b	we have characterized the physical structure and chemical composition of twoclose-to-round starless cores in taurus-auriga, l1498 and l1517b. our analysisis based on high angular resolution observations in at least two transitions ofnh3, n2h+, cs, c34s, c18o, and c17o, together with maps of the 1.2 mmcontinuum. for both cores, we derive radial profiles of constant temperatureand constant turbulence, together with density distributions close to those ofnon-singular isothermal spheres. using these physical conditions and a montecarlo radiative transfer model, we derive abundance profiles for all speciesand model the strong chemical differentiation of the core interiors. accordingto our models, the nh3 abundance increases toward the core centers by a factorof several while n2h+ has a constant abundance over most of the cores. incontrast, both c18o and cs (and isotopomers) are strongly depleted in the coreinteriors, most likely due to their freeze out onto grains at densities of afew 10^4 cm^{-3}. concerning the kinematics of the dense gas, we find (inaddition to constant turbulence) a pattern of internal motions at the level of0.1 km s^{-1}. these motions seem correlated with asymmetries in the pattern ofmolecular depletion, and we interpret them as residuals of core contraction.their distribution and size suggest that core formation occurs in a ratherirregular manner and with a time scale of a myr. a comparison of our derivedcore properties with those predicted by supersonic turbulence models of coreformation shows that our taurus cores are much more quiescent thanrepresentative predictions from these models.

astro-ph;0403517	observations of l1521f: a highly evolved starless core	we observed the pre-stellar core l1521f in dust emission at 1.2mm and in twotransitions each of n2h+, n2d+, c18o, and c17o in order to increase the sampleof well studied centrally concentrated and chemically evolved starless cores,likely on the verge of star formation, and to determine the initial conditionsfor low--mass star formation in the taurus molecular cloud. we derived in thisobject a molecular hydrogen number density n(h2) ~ 10^6 cm-3 and a co depletionfactor, integrated along the line of sight, fd ~ 15 in the central 20'',similar to the pre-stellar core l1544. however, the n(n2d+)/n(n2h+) columndensity ratio is ~0.1, a factor of about 2 lower than that found in l1544. theobserved relation between the deuterium fractionation and the integrated codepletion factor across the core can be reproduced by chemical models if n2h+is slightly (factor of ~2 in fractional abundance) depleted in the central 3000au. the n2h+ and n2d+ linewidths in the core center are ~0.3 km/s,significantly larger than in other more quiescent taurus starless cores butsimilar to those observed in the center of l1544. the kinematical behaviour ofl1521f is more complex than seen in l1544, and a model of contraction due toambipolar diffusion is only marginally consistent with the present data. othervelocity fields, perhaps produced by unresolved substructure, are present. bothchemical and kinematical analyses suggest that l1521f is less evolved thanl1544, but, in analogy with l1544, it is approaching the ``critical'' state.

astro-ph;0409529	probing the evolutionary status of starless cores through n2h+ and n2d+  observations	we have undertaken a survey of n2h+ and n2d+ towards 31 low-mass starlesscores using the iram 30m telescope. our main objective has been to determinethe abundance ratio of n2d+ and n2h+ towards the nuclei of these cores and thusto obtain estimates of the degree of deuterium enrichment, a symptom ofadvanced chemical evolution according to current models. we find that then(n2d+)/n(n2h+) ratio is larger in more "centrally concentrated cores" withlarger peak h2 and n2h+ column density than the sample mean. the deuteriumenrichment in starless cores is presently ascribed to depletion of co in thehigh density (&gt; 3*10^4 cm-3) core nucleus. to substantiate this picture, wecompare our results with observations in dust emission at 1.2 mm and in twotransitions of c18o. we find a good correlation between deuterium fractionationand n(c18o)/n(h2) for the nuclei of 14 starless cores. we, thus, identified aset of properties that characterize the most evolved, or "pre-stellar",starless cores. these are: higher n2h+ and n2d+ column densities, highern(n2d+)/n(n2h+), more pronounced co depletion, broader n2h+ lines with infallasymmetry, higher central h2 column densities and a more compact densityprofile than in the average core. we conclude that this combination ofproperties gives a reliable indication of the evolutionary state of the core.seven cores in our sample (l1521f, ophd, l429, l694, l183, l1544 and tmc2) showthe majority of these features and thus are believed to be closer to forming aprotostar than are the other members of our sample. finally, we note that thesubsample of taurus cores behaves more homogeneously than the total sample, anindication that the external environment could play an important role in thecore evolution.

(3) the fact that we consider chemisorption inour model makes the rate equation and monte carlo approaches equivalent.

astro-ph;0505168	chemical differentiation along the cepa-east outflows	we present the results of a multiline survey at mm-wavelengths of the cepheusa star forming region. four main flows have been identified: three pointing inthe sw, ne, and se directions and accelerating high density cs clumps. thefourth outflow, revealed by high-sensitivity hdo observations, is pointingtowards south and is associated with conditions particularly favourable to achemical enrichment. the analysis of the line profiles shows that the siomolecule dominates at the highest velocities and at the highest excitationconditions, confirming its close association with shocks. h2s, so2, and sopreferentially trace more quiescent regions than sio, and in particular a lackof bright h2s emission at the highest velocities is found. ocs and h2cs emit atquite high velocities, where the abundances of three shock tracers like sio,ch3oh, and hdo are higher. these results may indicate that h2s is not the onlymajor sulphur carrier in the grain mantles, and that ocs and h2cs may probablyplay an important role on the grains; or that alternatively they rapidly formonce the mantle is evaporated after the passage of a shock. finally, theoutflow peak emission has been compared with recent time-dependent sulphurchemistry models: the results indicate that, if associated with accuratemeasurements of the physical conditions, the ch3oh/h2cs column density ratiocan be used as an effective chemical clock to date the age of shocked gas.

astro-ph;0508256	discovery of deuterated water in a young proto-planetary disk	we report the first detection of the ground transition of the deuteratedwater at 464 ghz in the young proto-planetary disk surrounding the solar typeprotostar dm tau. the line is observed in absorption against the continuum fromthe cold dust in the disk midplane, with a line to continuum ratio close tounity. the observation implies that deuterated gaseous water is present, with arelatively large abundance ($\sim 3\times10^{-9}$), in the outer disk above themidplane, where the density is, within a factor ten, $\sim 10^6$ cm$^{-3}$ andthe temperature is lower than about 25 k. in these conditions, the h$_2$ocondensation timescale is much smaller than the dm tau disk age, and,therefore, water should be fully frozen onto the grain mantles. we suggest thatuv photons and/or x-rays sublimate part of the mantles re-injecting the icesinto the gas phase. even though there is currently no measurement of h$_2$o, weprovide arguments that the hdo/h$_2$o ratio should be about 0.01 or larger,which would be hundreds of times larger than the values measured in solarsystem objects. this suggests the need of strong caution in comparing andlinking the hdo/h$_2$o in solar system and star forming environments.

astro-ph;0603261	metals and dust in high redshift agns	we summarize some recent results on the metallicity and dust properties ofactive galactic nuclei (agn) at high redshift (1&lt;z&lt;6.4). by using the spectraof more than 5000 qsos from the sdss we find no evidence for any metallicityevolution in the redshift range 2&lt;z&lt;4.5, while there is a significantluminosity-metallicity dependence. these results are confirmed by the spectraof a smaller sample of narrow line agns at high-z (qso2s and radio galaxies).the lack of metallicity evolution is interpreted both as a consequence of thecosmic downsizing and as a selection effect resulting from the joint qso-galaxyevolution. the luminosity-metallicity relation is interpreted as a consequenceof the mass-metallicity relation in the host galaxies of qsos, but arelationship with the accretion rate is also possible. the lack of metallicityevolution is observed even in the spectra of the most distant qsos known (z~6).this result is particularly surprising for elements such as fe, c and si, whichare subject to a delayed enrichment, and requires that the hosts of these qsosformed in short bursts and at very high redshift (z&gt;10). the properties of dustin high-z qsos are discussed within the context of the dust productionmechanisms in the early universe. the dust extinction curve is observed toevolve beyond z&gt;4, and by z~6 it is well described by the properties expectedfor dust produced by sne, suggesting that the latter is the main mechanism ofdust production in the early universe. we also show that the huge dust massesobserved in distant qsos can be accounted for by sn dust within theobservational constraints currently available. finally, we show that qso winds,which have been proposed as an alternative mechanism of dust production, mayalso contribute significantly to the total dust budget at high redshift.

astro-ph;0608702	searching for massive pre--stellar cores through observations of n2h+  and n2d+	we have measured the deuterium fractionation (through the column densityratio n(n2d+)/n(n2h+)) and the co depletion factor (ratio between expected andobserved co abundance) in a sample of 10 high-mass protostellar candidates, inorder to understand whether the earliest evolutionary stages of high-mass starshave chemical characteristics similar to those of low-mass ones. theobservations were carried out with the iram-30m telescope and the jcmt. we havedetected n2d+ emission in 7 of the 10 sources of our sample, and found anaverage value n(n2d+)/n(n2h+)~0.015. this value is 3 orders of magnitude largerthan the interstellar d/h ratio, indicating the presence of cold and dense gas,in which the physical-chemical conditions are similar to those observed inlow-mass pre-stellar cores. also, the integrated co depletion factors show thatin the majority of the sources the expected co abundances are larger than theobserved values, with a median ratio of 3.2. in principle, the cold gas thatgives origin to the n2d+ emission can be the remnant of the massive molecularcore in which the high-mass (proto-)star was born, not yet heated up by thecentral object. if so, our results indicate that the chemical properties of theclouds in which high-mass stars are born are similar to their low-masscounterparts. alternatively, this cold gas can be located into one (or more)starless core (cores) near the protostellar object. due to the poor angularresolution of our data, we cannot decide which is the correct scenario.
