0906.0458	the onset of star formation in primordial haloes	star formation remains an unsolved problem in astrophysics. numerical studiesof large-scale structure simulations cannot resolve the whole process and theirapproach usually assumes that only gas denser than a typical threshold can hostand form stars. we investigate the onset of cosmological star formation andcompare several very-high-resolution, three-dimensional, n-body/sph simulationsthat include non-equilibrium, atomic and molecular chemistry, star formationprescriptions, and feedback effects. we study how primordial star formationdepends on gas density thresholds, cosmological parameters and initial set-ups.for mean-density initial conditions, we find that standard low-densitystar-formation threshold (0.2 h^2/cm3) models predict the onset of starformation at z~25-31, depending on the adopted cosmology. in these models starsare formed regardless of the time between the moment when the threshold isreached and the effective runaway collapse. at high redshift, this timeinterval represents a significant fraction of the hubble time and thus thisassumption can induce large artificial off-sets to the onset of star formation.choosing higher density thresholds (135 h^2/cm3) allows the entire coolingprocess to be followed, and the onset of star formation is then estimated to beat redshift z~12-16. when isolated, rare, high-density peaks are considered,the chemical evolution is much faster and the first star formation episodesoccur at z &gt; 40, almost regardless of the choice for the density threshold.these results could have implications for the formation redshift of the firstcosmological objects, as inferred from direct numerical simulations ofmean-density environments, and on the studies of the reionization history ofthe universe.

1001.3018	intracluster stars in simulations with agn feedback	we use a set of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of clusters ofgalaxies to study the build-up of the intracluster light (icl), an interestingand likely significant component of their total stellar mass. our sample ofgroups and clusters includes agn feedback and is of high enough resolution toaccurately resolve galaxy populations down to the smallest galaxies that areexpected to significantly contribute to the stellar mass budget. we describeand test four different methods to identify the icl in simulations, therebyallowing us to assess the reliability of the measurements. for all of themethods, we consistently find a very significant icl stellar fraction (~45%)which exceeds the values typically inferred from observations. however, we showthat this result is robust with respect to numerical resolution and integrationaccuracy, remarkably insensitive to changes in the star formation model, andalmost independent of halo mass. it is also almost invariant when black holegrowth is included, even though agn feedback successfully prevents excessiveovercooling in clusters and leads to a drastically improved agreement of thesimulated cluster galaxy population with observations. in particular, theluminosities of central galaxies and the ages of their stellar populations aremuch more realistic when including agn. in the light of these findings, itappears challenging to construct a simulation model that simultaneously matchesthe cluster galaxy population and at the same time produces a low iclcomponent. we find that intracluster stars are preferentially stripped in acluster's densest region from massive galaxies that fall into the cluster atz&gt;1. surprisingly, some of the intracluster stars also form in the intraclustermedium inside cold gas clouds that are stripped out of infalling galaxies.

1004.1302	high-performance astrophysical visualization using splotch	the scientific community is presently witnessing an unprecedented growth inthe quality and quantity of data sets coming from simulations and real-worldexperiments. to access effectively and extract the scientific content of suchlarge-scale data sets (often sizes are measured in hundreds or even millions ofgigabytes) appropriate tools are needed. visual data exploration and discoveryis a robust approach for rapidly and intuitively inspecting large-scale datasets, e.g. for identifying new features and patterns or isolating small regionsof interest within which to apply time-consuming algorithms. this paperpresents a high performance parallelized implementation of splotch, ourpreviously developed visual data exploration and discovery algorithm forlarge-scale astrophysical data sets coming from particle-based simulations.splotch has been improved in order to exploit modern massively parallelarchitectures, e.g. multicore cpus and cuda-enabled gpus. we presentperformance and scalability benchmarks on a number of test cases, demonstratingthe ability of our high performance parallelized splotch to handle efficientlylarge-scale data sets, such as the outputs of the millennium ii simulation, thelargest cosmological simulation ever performed.

1004.1637	non-gaussian halo assembly bias	the strong dependence of the large-scale dark matter halo bias on the (local)non-gaussianity parameter, f_nl, offers a promising avenue towards constrainingprimordial non-gaussianity with large-scale structure surveys. in this paper,we present the first detection of the dependence of the non-gaussian halo biason halo formation history using n-body simulations. we also present an analyticderivation of the expected signal based on the extended press-schechterformalism. in excellent agreement with our analytic prediction, we find thatthe halo formation history-dependent contribution to the non-gaussian halo bias(which we call non-gaussian halo assembly bias) can be factorized in a formapproximately independent of redshift and halo mass. the correction to thenon-gaussian halo bias due to the halo formation history can be as large as100%, with a suppression of the signal for recently formed halos andenhancement for old halos. this could in principle be a problem for realisticgalaxy surveys if observational selection effects were to pick galaxiesoccupying only recently formed halos. current semi-analytic galaxy formationmodels, for example, imply an enhancement in the expected signal of ~23% and~48% for galaxies at z=1 selected by stellar mass and star formation rate,respectively.

1008.3790	protostellar collapse and fragmentation using an mhd gadget	although the influence of magnetic fields is regarded as vital in the starformation process, only a few magnetohydrodynamics (mhd) simulations have beenperformed on this subject within the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph)method. this is largely due to the unsatisfactory treatment of non-vanishingdivergence of the magnetic field. recently smoothed particlemagnetohydrodynamics (spmhd) simulations based on euler potentials have provento be successful in treating mhd collapse and fragmentation problems, howeverthese methods are known to have some intrinsical difficulties. we haveperformed spmhd simulations based on a traditional approach evolving themagnetic field itself using the induction equation. to account for thenumerical divergence, we have chosen an approach that subtracts the effects ofnumerical divergence from the force equation, and additionally we employartificial magnetic dissipation as a regularization scheme. we apply thisrealization of spmhd to a widely known setup, a variation of the 'boss &amp;bodenheimer standard isothermal test case', to study the impact of the magneticfields on collapse and fragmentation. in our simulations, we concentrate onsetups, where the initial magnetic field is parallel to the rotation axis. weexamine different field strengths and compare our results to other findingsreported in the literature. we are able to confirm specific results foundelsewhere, namely the delayed onset of star formation for strong fields,accompanied by the tendency to form only single stars. we also find that the'magnetic cushioning effect', where the magnetic field is wound up to form a'cushion' between the binary, aids binary fragmentation in a case, wherepreviously only formation of a single protostar was expected.

1008.5376	hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters in dark energy  cosmologies: i. general properties	we investigate the influence of dark energy on structure formation, withinfive different cosmological models, namely a concordance $\lambda$cdm model,two models with dynamical dark energy, viewed as a quintessence scalar field(using a rp and a sugra potential form) and two extended quintessence models(eqp and eqn) where the quintessence scalar field interacts non-minimally withgravity (scalar-tensor theories). we adopted for all models the normalizationof the matter power spectrum $\sigma_{8}$ to match the cmb data. in the modelswith dynamical dark energy and quintessence, we describe the equation of statewith $w_0\approx-0.9$, still within the range allowed by observations. for eachmodel, we have performed hydrodynamical simulations in a cosmological box of$(300 \ {\rm{mpc}} \ h^{-1})^{3}$ including baryons and allowing for coolingand star formation. the contemporary presence of evolving dark energy andbaryon physics allows us to investigate the interplay between the differentbackground cosmology and the evolution of the luminous matter. since clusterbaryon fraction can be used to constrain other cosmological parameters such as$\omega_{m}$, we also analyse how dark energy influences the baryon content ofgalaxy clusters. we find that, in models with dynamical dark energy, theevolving cosmological background leads to different star formation rates anddifferent formation histories of galaxy clusters, but the baryon physics is notaffected in a relevant way. we investigate several proxies of the cluster massfunction based on x-ray observables like temperature, luminosity, $m_{gas}$,and $y_{gas}$. we conclude that the x-ray temperature and $m_{gas}$ functionsare better diagnostic to disentangle the growth of structures among differentdark energy models.

1012.1606	velocity structure diagnostics of simulated galaxy clusters	gas motions in the hot intracluster medium of galaxy clusters have animportant effect on the mass determination of the clusters through x-rayobservations. the corresponding dynamical pressure has to be accounted for inaddition to the hydrostatic pressure support to achieve a precise massmeasurement. an analysis of the velocity structure of the icm for simulatedcluster-size haloes, especially focusing on rotational patterns, has beenperformed, demonstrating them to be an intermittent phenomenon, stronglyrelated to the internal dynamics of substructures. we find that the expectedbuild-up of rotation due to mass assembly gets easily destroyed by passages ofgas-rich substructures close to the central region. though, if a typicalrotation pattern is established, the corresponding mass contribution isestimated to be up to ~17% of the total mass in the innermost region, and onehas to account for it. extending the analysis to a larger sample of simulatedhaloes we statistically observe that (i) the distribution of the rotationalcomponent of the gas velocity in the innermost region has typical values of~200-300 km/s; (ii) except for few outliers, there is no monotonic increase ofthe rotational velocity with decreasing redshift, as we would expect fromapproaching a relaxed configuration. therefore, the hypothesis that thebuild-up of rotation is strongly influenced by internal dynamics is confirmed,and minor events like gas-rich substructures passing close to the equatorialplane can easily destroy any ordered rotational pattern.

1012.4027	scaling rrelation in two situations of extreme mergers	clusters of galaxies are known to be dynamically active systems, yet x-raystudies of the low redshift population exhibit tight scaling laws. in thiswork, we extend previous studies of this apparent paradox using numericalsimulations of two extreme merger cases, one is a high mach number (above 2.5)satellite merger similar to the "bullet cluster" and the other a merger ofnearly equal mass progenitors. creating x-ray images densely sampled in time,we construct tx, mgas, and yx measures within r500 and compare to thecalibrations of kravtsov et al. (2006). we find that these extreme merger casesrespect the scaling relations, for both intrinsic measures and for measuresderived from appropriately masked, synthetic chandra x-ray images. the maskingprocedure plays a critical role in the x-ray temperature calculation while itis irrelevant in the x-ray gas mass derivation. mis-centering up to 100 kpcdoes not influence the result. the observationally determined radius r500 mightconduce to systematic shifts in mgas, and yx which increase the total massscatter.

1104.0949	haloes gone mad: the halo-finder comparison project	[abridged] we present a detailed comparison of fundamental dark matter haloproperties retrieved by a substantial number of different halo finders. thesecodes span a wide range of techniques including friends-of-friends (fof),spherical-overdensity (so) and phase-space based algorithms. we furtherintroduce a robust (and publicly available) suite of test scenarios that allowshalo finder developers to compare the performance of their codes against thosepresented here. this set includes mock haloes containing various levels anddistributions of substructure at a range of resolutions as well as acosmological simulation of the large-scale structure of the universe. all thehalo finding codes tested could successfully recover the spatial location ofour mock haloes. they further returned lists of particles (potentially)belonging to the object that led to coinciding values for the maximum of thecircular velocity profile and the radius where it is reached. all the findersbased in configuration space struggled to recover substructure that was locatedclose to the centre of the host halo and the radial dependence of the massrecovered varies from finder to finder. those finders based in phase spacecould resolve central substructure although they found difficulties inaccurately recovering its properties. via a resolution study we found that mostof the finders could not reliably recover substructure containing fewer than30-40 particles. however, also here the phase space finders excelled byresolving substructure down to 10-20 particles. by comparing the halo findersusing a high resolution cosmological volume we found that they agree remarkablywell on fundamental properties of astrophysical significance (e.g. mass,position, velocity, and peak of the rotation curve).

1107.2942	adaptive gravitational softening in gadget	cosmological simulations of structure formation follow the collisionlessevolution of dark matter starting from a nearly homogeneous field at earlytimes down to the highly clustered configuration at redshift zero. the densityfield is sampled by a number of particles in number infinitely smaller thanthose believed to be its actual components and this limits the mass and spatialscales over which we can trust the results of a simulation. softening of thegravitational force is introduced in collisionless simulations to limit theimportance of close encounters between these particles. the scale of softeningis generally fixed and chosen as a compromise between the need for high spatialresolution and the need to limit the particle noise. in the scenario ofcosmological simulations, where the density field evolves to a highlyinhomogeneous state, this compromise results in an appropriate choice only fora certain class of objects, the others being subject to either a biased or anoisy dynamical description. we have implemented adaptive gravitationalsoftening lengths in the cosmological simulation code gadget; the formalismallows the softening scale to vary in space and time according to the densityof the environment, at the price of modifying the equation of motion for theparticles in order to be consistent with the new dependencies introduced in thesystem's lagrangian. we have applied the technique to a number of test casesand to a set of cosmological simulations of structure formation. we concludethat the use of adaptive softening enhances the clustering of particles atsmall scales, a result visible in the amplitude of the correlation function andin the inner profile of massive objects, thereby anticipating the resultsexpected from much higher resolution simulations.

1107.5740	merger induced scatter and bias in the cluster mass - sunyaev-zeldovich  effect scaling relation	we examine sources of scatter in scaling relations between galaxy clustermass and thermal sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) effect using cluster samples extractedfrom cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. overall, the scatter of themass-sz scaling relation is well correlated with the scatter in the mass-haloconcentration relation with more concentrated halos having stronger integratedsz signals at fixed mass. additional sources of intrinsic scatter areprojection effects from correlated structures, which cause the distribution ofscatter to deviate from log-normality and skew it towards higher inferredmasses, and the dynamical state of clusters. we study the evolution of mergingclusters based on simulations of 39 clusters and their cosmological environmentwith high time resolution. this sample enables us to study for the first timethe detailed evolution of merging clusters around the scaling relation for acosmologically representative distribution of merger parameters. major mergerscause an asymmetric scatter such that the inferred mass of merging systems isbiased low. we find mergers to be the dominant source of bias towards lowinferred masses: over 50% of outliers on this side of the scaling relationunderwent a major merger within the last gigayear. as the fraction ofdynamically disturbed clusters increases with redshift, our analysis indicatesthat mergers cause a redshift-dependent bias in scaling relations. furthermore,we find the sz morphology of massive clusters to be well correlated with theclusters' dynamical state, suggesting that morphology may be used to constrainmerger fractions and identify merger-induced outliers of the scaling relation.

1108.1040	protostellar outflows with smoothed particle magnetohydrodynamics  (spmhd)	the protostellar collapse of a molecular cloud core is usually accompanied byoutflow phenomena. the latter are thought to be driven by magnetorotationalprocesses from the central parts of the protostellar disc. while several 3damr/nested grid studies of outflow phenomena in collapsing magneticallysupercritical dense cores have been reported in the literature, so far no suchsimulation has been performed using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph)method. this is mainly due to intrinsic numerical difficulties in handlingmagnetohydrodynamics within sph, which only recently were partly resolved. inthis work, we use an approach where we evolve the magnetic field via theinduction equation, augmented with stability correction and divergence cleaningschemes. we consider the collapse of a rotating core of one solar mass,threaded by a weak magnetic field initially parallel to the rotation axis sothat the core is magnetically supercritical. we show, that smoothed particlemagnetohydrodynamics (spmhd) is able to handle the magnetorotational processesconnected with outflow phenomena, and to produce meaningful results which arein good agreement with findings reported in the literature. especially, ournumerical scheme allows for a quantitative analysis of the evolution of theratio of the toroidal to the poloidal magnetic field, which we performed inthis work.

1108.4006	magnetic field amplification and x-ray emission in galaxy minor mergers	we investigate the magnetic field evolution in a series of galaxy minormergers using the n-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph) code\textsc{gadget}. the simulations include the effects of radiative cooling, starformation and supernova feedback. magnetohydrodynamics (mhd) is implementedusing the sph method. we present 32 simulations of binary mergers of discgalaxies with mass ratios of 2:1 up to 100:1, whereby we have additionallyvaried the initial magnetic field strengths, disc orientations and resolutions.we investigate the amplification of a given initial magnetic field within thegalaxies and an ambient intergalactic medium (igm) during the interaction. wefind that the magnetic field strengths of merger remnants with mass ratios upto 10:1 saturate at a common value of several $\mu$g. for higher mass ratios,the field strength saturates at lower values. the saturation values correspondto the equipartition value of magnetic and turbulent energy density. theinitial magnetization, disc orientation and numerical resolution show onlyminor effects on the saturation value of the magnetic field. we demonstratethat a higher impact energy of the progenitor galaxies leads to a moreefficient magnetic field amplification. the magnetic and turbulent energydensities are higher for larger companion galaxies, consistent with the higherimpact energy supplied to the system. we present a detailed study of theevolution of the temperature and the bolometric x-ray luminosity within themerging systems. thereby we find that magnetic fields cause a more efficientincrease of the igm temperature and the corresponding igm x-ray luminosityafter the first encounter. however, the presence of magnetic fields does notenhance the total x-ray luminosity. generally, the final value of the x-rayluminosity is even clearly lower for higher initial magnetic fields.

1109.0484	schmidt-kennicutt relations in sph simulations of disc galaxies with  effective thermal feedback from supernovae	we study several versions of the schmidt-kennicutt (sk) relation obtained forisolated spiral galaxies in treesph simulations run with the gadget3 codeincluding the novel multi-phase particle integrator (muppi) algorithm for starformation and stellar feedback. [...] the standard sk relation between surfacedensities of cold (neutral+molecular) gas and star formation rate of simulatedgalaxies shows a steepening at low gas surface densities, starting from a kneewhose position depends on disc gas fraction: for more gas-rich discs thesteepening takes place at higher surface densities. because gas fraction andmetallicity are typically related, this environmental dependence mimics thepredictions of models where the formation of h2 is modulated by metallicity.the cold gas surface density at which hi and molecular gas surface densitiesequate can range from ~10 up to 34 msun/pc^2. as expected, the sk relationobtained using molecular gas shows much smaller variations among simulations.we find that disc pressure is not well represented by the classical externalpressure of a disc in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium. instead is well fit bythe expression p_fit = sigma_cold sigma_cold kappa / 6, where the threequantities on the right-hand side are cold gas surface density, verticalvelocity dispersion and epicyclic frequency. when the "dynamical" sk relation,i.e. the relation that uses gas surface density divided by orbital time, isconsidered, we find that all of our simulations stay on the same relation. weinterpret this as a manifestation of the equilibrium between energy injectionand dissipation in stationary galaxy discs, when energetic feedback iseffective and pressure is represented by the expression given above. thesefindings further support the idea that a realistic model of the structure ofgalaxy discs should take into account energy injection by sne.

1111.3066	the effects of baryons on the halo mass function	we present an analysis of the effects of baryon physics on the halo massfunction. the analysis is based on simulations of a cosmological volume.besides a dark matter (dm) only simulation, we also carry out two otherhydrodynamical simulations. we identified halos using a spherical overdensityalgorithm and their masses are computed at three different overdensities (withrespect to the critical one), $\delta_c=200$, 500 and 1500. we find thefractional difference between halo masses in the hydrodynamical and in the dmsimulations to be almost constant, at least for halos more massive than $\log(m_{\delta_c} / \hmsun)\geq 13.5$. in this range, mass increase in thehydrodynamical simulations is of about 4-5 per cent at $\delta_c=500$ and $\sim1$ - 2 per cent at $\delta_c=200$. quite interestingly, these differences arenearly the same for both radiative and non-radiative simulations. suchvariations of halo masses induce corresponding variations of the halo massfunction (hmf). at $z=0$, the hmfs for gh and csf simulations are close to thedm one, with differences of $\mincir 3$ per cent at $\delta_c = 200$, and$\simeq 7$ per cent at $\delta_c=500$, with $\sim 10$ - 20 per cent differencesreached at $\delta_c = 1500$. at this higher overdensity, the increase of thehmf for the radiative case is larger by about a factor 2 with respect to thenon--radiative case. assuming a constant mass shift to rescale the hmf from thehydrodynamic to the dm simulations, brings the hmf difference with respect tothe dm case to be consistent with zero. our results have interestingimplications to bracket uncertainties in the mass function calibrationassociated to the uncertain baryon physics, in view of cosmologicalapplications of future large surveys of galaxy clusters.

1112.5035	on the self-similar appearance of galaxy clusters in x-rays	the largest uncertainty for cosmological studies using clusters of galaxiesis introduced by our limited knowledge of the statistics of galaxy clusterstructure, and of the scaling relations between observables and cluster mass. alarge effort is therefore undertaken to compile global galaxy clusterproperties in particular obtained through x-ray observations and to study theirscaling relations. however, the scaling schemes used in the literature differ.the present paper aims to clarify this situation by providing a thorough reviewof the scaling laws within the standard model of large-scale structure growthand to discus various steps of practical approximations. we derive the scalinglaws for x-ray observables and cluster mass within the pure gravitationalstructure growth scenario. using n-body simulations we test the recentformation approximation used in earlier analytic approaches which involves aredshift dependent overdensity parameter.we find this approximation lessprecise than the use of a fiducial radius based on a fixed overdensity withrespect to critical density. inspired by the comparison of the predictedscaling relations with observations we propose a first order modification ofthe scaling scheme to include the observed effects of hydrodynamics instructure formation. this modification involves a cluster mass dependent gasmass fraction. we also discuss the observational results of the reshiftevolution of the most important scaling relations and find that also a redshiftdependence of the gas mass to total mass relation has to be invoked within ourmodification scheme. we find that the current observational data are withintheir uncertainties consistent with the proposed modified scaling laws.

1202.3349	origin of strong magnetic fields in milky-way like galactic haloes	an analytical model predicting the growth rates, the absolute growth timesand the saturation values of the magnetic field strength within galactic haloesis presented. the analytical results are compared to cosmological mhdsimulations of milky-way like galactic halo formation performed with the n-body/ \textsc{spmhd} code \textsc{gadget}. the halo has a mass of$\approx{}3\cdot{}10^{12}$ $m_{\odot}$ and a virial radius of $\approx{}$270kpc. the simulations in a $\lambda$cdm cosmology also include radiativecooling, star formation, supernova feedback and the description of non-idealmhd. a primordial magnetic seed field ranging from $10^{-10}$ to $10^{-34}$ gin strength agglomerates together with the gas within filaments andprotohaloes. there, it is amplified within a couple of hundred million years upto equipartition with the corresponding turbulent energy. the magnetic fieldstrength increases by turbulent small-scale dynamo action. the turbulence isgenerated by the gravitational collapse and by supernova feedback.subsequently, a series of halo mergers leads to shock waves and amplificationprocesses magnetizing the surrounding gas within a few billion years. at first,the magnetic energy grows on small scales and then self-organizes to largerscales. magnetic field strengths of $\approx{}10^{-6}$ g are reached in thecenter of the halo and drop to $\approx{}10^{-9}$ g in the igm. analyzing thesaturation levels and growth rates, the model is able to describe the processof magnetic amplification notably well and confirms the results of thesimulations.

1202.5212	a warm mode of gas accretion on forming galaxies	we present results from high--resolution cosmological hydrodynamicalsimulations of a milky--way-sized halo, aimed at studying the effect offeedback on the nature of gas accretion. simulations include a model ofinter-stellar medium and star formation, in which sn explosions provideeffective thermal feedback. we distinguish between gas accretion onto the halo,which occurs when gas particles cross the halo virial radius, and gas accretiononto the central galaxy, which takes place when gas particles cross the innerone-tenth of the virial radius. gas particles can be accreted through threedifferent channels, depending on the maximum temperature value, $t_{\rm max}$,reached during the particles' past evolution: a cold channel for $t_{\rmmax}&lt;2.5 \times 10^5$ k, a hot one for $t&gt;10^6$k, and a warm one forintermediate values of $t_{\rm max}$. we find that the warm channel is at leastas important as the cold one for gas accretion onto the central galaxy. thisresult is at variance with previous findings that the cold mode dominates gasaccretion at high redshift. we ascribe this difference to the differentsupernova feedback scheme implemented in our simulations. while resultspresented so far in the literature are based on uneffective sn thermal feedbackschemes and/or the presence of a kinetic feedback, our simulations include onlyeffective thermal feedback. we argue that observational detections of a warmaccretion mode in the high--redshift circum-galactic medium would provideuseful constraints on the nature of the feedback that regulates star formationin galaxies.

1203.5251	tomographic weak lensing shear spectra from large n-body and  hydrodynamical simulations	forthcoming experiments will enable us to determine tomographic shear spectraat a high precision level. most predictions about them have until now beenbiased on algorithms yielding the expected linear and non-linear spectrum ofdensity fluctuations. even when simulations have been used, so-called halofit(smith et al 2003) predictions on fairly large scales have been needed. we wishto go beyond this limitation. we perform n-body and hydrodynamical simulationswithin a sufficiently large cosmological volume to allow a direct connectionbetween simulations and linear spectra. while covering large length-scales, thesimulation resolution is good enough to allow us to explore the high-lharmonics of the cosmic shear (up to l ~ 50000), well into the domain wherebaryon physics becomes important. we then compare shear spectra in the absenceand in presence of various kinds of baryon physics, such as radiative cooling,star formation, and supernova feedback in the form of galactic winds. wedistinguish several typical properties of matter fluctuation spectra in thedifferent simulations and test their impact on shear spectra. we compare ouroutputs with those obtainable using approximate expressions for non--linearspectra, and identify substantial discrepancies even between our results andthose of purely n-body results. our simulations and the treatment of theiroutputs however enable us, for the first time, to obtain shear results taht arefully independent of any approximate expression, also in the high-l range,where we need to incorporate a non-linear power spectrum of densityperturbations, and the effects of baryon physics. this will allow us to fullyexploit the cosmological information contained in future high--sensitivitycosmic shear surveys, exploring the physics of cosmic shears via weak lensingmeasurements.

1205.3163	hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters in dark energy  cosmologies: ii. c-m relation	we use hydrodynamical simulations of different dark energy cosmologies toinvestigate the concentration-mass (c-m) relation in galaxy clusters. inparticular, we consider a reference \lambda cdm model, two quintessence modelswith inverse power-law potentials (rp and sugra), and two extended quintessencemodels, one with positive and one with negative coupling with gravity (eqp andeqn respectively). all the models are normalized in order to match cmb datafrom wmap3. we fit both the dark matter only and the total mass profile with anfw profile, and recover the concentration of each halo from the fit usingdifferent definition. we consider both the complete catalog of clusters andgroups and subsamples of objects at different level of relaxation. we find thatthe definition itself of the concentration can lead to differences up to 20% inits value and that these differences are smaller when more relaxed objects areconsidered. the c-m relation of our reference \lambda cdm model is in goodagreement with the results in literature, and relaxed objects have a highernormalization and a shallower slope with respect to the complete sample. theinclusion of baryon physics is found to influence more high-mass systems thanlow-mass ones, due to a higher concentration of baryons in the inner regions ofmassive halos. for the different dark energy models, we find that for \lambdacdm, rp and sugra the normalization of the c-m relation is linked to the growthfactor, with models having a higher value of \sigma 8 d+ having also a highernormalization. this simple scheme is no longer valid for eqp and eqn because inthese models a time dependent effective gravitational interaction, whoseredshift evolution depends on the sign of the coupling, is present. this leadsto a decrease (increase) of the expected normalization in the eqp (eqn) model.[abridged]

1205.4238	the darkness that shaped the void: dark energy and cosmic voids	aims: we assess the sensitivity of void shapes to the nature of dark energythat was pointed out in recent studies. we investigate whether or not voidshapes are useable as an observational probe in galaxy redshift surveys. wefocus on the evolution of the mean void ellipticity and its underlying physicalcause. methods: we analyse the morphological properties of voids in five setsof cosmological n-body simulations, each with a different nature of darkenergy. comparing voids in the dark matter distribution to those in the halopopulation, we address the question of whether galaxy redshift surveys yieldsufficiently accurate void morphologies. voids are identified using theparameter free watershed void finder. the effect of redshift distortions isinvestigated as well. results: we confirm the statistically significantsensitivity of voids in the dark matter distribution. we identify the level ofclustering as measured by \sigma_8(z) as the main cause of differences in meanvoid shape &lt;\epsilon&gt;. we find that in the halo and/or galaxy distribution itis practically unfeasible to distinguish at a statistically significant levelbetween the various cosmologies due to the sparsity and spatial bias of thesample.

0711.3418	realistic simulations of gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters:  extracting arc parameters from mock dune images	we present a newly developed code that allows simulations of opticalobservations of galaxy fields with a variety of instruments. the codeincorporates gravitational lensing effects and is targetted at simulatinglensing by galaxy clusters. our goal is to create the tools required forcomparing theoretical expectations with observations to obtain a betterunderstanding of how observational noise affects lensing applications such asmass estimates, studies on the internal properties of galaxy clusters and arcstatistics. starting from a set of input parameters, characterizing both theinstruments and the observational conditions, the simulator provides a virtualobservation of a patch of the sky. it includes several sources of noise such asphoton-noise, sky background, seeing, and instrumental noise. ray-tracingthrough simulated mass distributions accounts for gravitational lensing. sourcemorphologies are realistically simulated based on shapelet decompositions ofgalaxy images retrieved from the goods-acs archive. according to theirmorphological class, spectral-energy-distributions are assigned to the sourcegalaxies in order to reproduce observations of each galaxy in arbitraryphotometric bands. we illustrate our techniques showing virtual observations ofa galaxy-cluster core as it would be observed with the space telescope dune,which was recently proposed to esa within its "cosmic vision" programme.(abridged)

0711.3603	the effect of primordial non--gaussianity on the topology of large-scale  structure	we study the effect of primordial non-gaussianity on the development oflarge-scale cosmic structure using high-resolution n-body simulations. inparticular, we focus on the topological properties of the "cosmic web",quantitatively characterized by the minkowski functionals, for models withquadratic non-linearities with different values of the usual non-gaussianityparameter fnl. in the weakly non-linear regime, we find that analytic formulaederived from perturbation theory agree with the numerical results within a fewpercent of the amplitude of each mf when |fnl|&lt;1000. in the non-linear regime,the detailed behavior of the mfs as functions of threshold density deviatesmore strongly from the analytical curves, while the overall amplitude of theprimordial non-gaussian effect remains comparable to the perturbativeprediction. when smaller-scale information is included, the influence ofprimordial non-gaussianity becomes increasingly significant statistically dueto decreasing sample variance. we find that the effect of the primordialnon-gaussianity with |fnl|=50 is comparable to the sample variance of massdensity fields with a volume of 0.125(gpc/h)^3 when they are smoothed bygaussian filter at a scale of 5mpc/h. the detectability of this effect inactual galaxy surveys will strongly depend upon residual uncertainties incosmological parameters and galaxy biasing.

1208.5770	how baryonic processes affect strong lensing properties of simulated  galaxy clusters	the observed abundance of giant arcs produced by galaxy cluster lenses andthe measured einstein radii have presented a source of tension for lcdm.previous cosmological tests for high-redshift clusters (z&gt;0.5) have sufferedfrom small number statistics in the simulated sample and the implementation ofbaryonic physics is likely to affect the outcome. we analyse zoomed-insimulations of a fairly large sample of cluster-sized objects, with mvir &gt;3x10^14 msun/h, identified at z=0.25 and z=0.5, for a concordance lcdmcosmology. we start with dark matter only simulations, and then add gashydrodynamics, with different treatments of baryonic processes: non-radiativecooling, radiative cooling with star formation and galactic winds powered bysupernova explosions, and finally including the effect of agn feedback. we findthat the addition of gas in non-radiative simulations does not change thestrong lensing predictions significantly, but gas cooling and star formationtogether significantly increase the number of expected giant arcs and theeinstein radii, particularly for lower redshift clusters and lower sourceredshifts. further inclusion of agn feedback reduces the predicted stronglensing efficiencies such that the lensing probability distributions becomescloser to those obtained for simulations including only dark matter. ourresults indicate that the inclusion of baryonic physics in simulations will notsolve the arc-statistics problem at low redshifts, when the physical processesincluded provide a realistic description of cooling in the central regions ofgalaxy clusters.

1209.0586	on the orbital and internal evolution of cluster galaxies	galaxies inhabiting a cluster environment experience significant evolution intheir orbital motions throughout time; this is accompanied by changes in theanisotropy parameter, measuring the relative importance of radial andtangential motions for a given class of objects. along with orbital changes,galaxies in clusters are well known to undergo severe alteration in theirhot/cold gas content and star formation properties. understanding the linkbetween the changes in the internal properties of galaxies and their orbitalmotion is of crucial importance in the study of galaxy evolution, as it couldunveil the primary mechanism responsible for its environmental dependence. dothe changes in the internal properties happen in parallel with those in theorbital motion? or are the orbital features at the time of infall whatdetermines the fate of the member galaxies? alternatively: are the propertiesof galaxies at a given time related to the coeval orbital anisotropy or arethey better related to the anisotropy at infall? in order to answer thesequestions, we studied the orbital evolution of different galaxy populations inthe semi-analytic models of guo et al. (2011) applied on to the millenniumsimulation. for each class of objects, characterised by different internalproperties (such as age, star formation rate and colour), we studied theanisotropy profile at redshift zero and its evolution by tracing theprogenitors back in time. we conclude that the orbital properties at infallstrongly influence the subsequent evolution of the internal features ofgalaxies and that the overall anisotropy of the galaxy population tends toincrease with time.

1209.5058	baryon census in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters	we carry out an analysis of a set of cosmological sph hydrodynamicalsimulations of galaxy clusters and groups aimed at studying the total baryonbudget in clusters, and how this budget is shared between the hot diffusecomponent and the stellar component. using the treepm+sph gadget-3 code, wecarried out one set of non-radiative simulations, and two sets of simulationsincluding radiative cooling, star formation and feedback from supernovae (sn),one of which also accounting for the effect of feedback from active galacticnuclei (agn). the analysis is carried out with the twofold aim of studying theimplication of stellar and hot gas content on the relative role played by snand agn feedback, and to calibrate the cluster baryon fraction and itsevolution as a cosmological tool. we find that both radiative simulation setspredict a trend of stellar mass fraction with cluster mass that tends to beweaker than the observed one. however this tension depends on the particularset of observational data considered. including the effect of agn feedbackalleviates this tension on the stellar mass and predicts values of the hot gasmass fraction and total baryon fraction to be in closer agreement withobservational results. we further compute the ratio between the cluster baryoncontent and the cosmic baryon fraction, y_b, as a function of cluster-centricradius and redshift. at r_500 we find for massive clusters withm_500&gt;2\times10^{14} h^{-1} m_sun that y_b is nearly independent of thephysical processes included and characterized by a negligible redshiftevolution: y_{b,500}=0.85+/-0.03 with the error accounting for the intrinsicr.m.s. scatter within the set of simulated clusters. at smaller radii, r_2500,the typical value of y_b slightly decreases, by an amount that depends on thephysics included in the simulations, while its scatter increases by about afactor of two.

1210.2578	galaxies going mad: the galaxy-finder comparison project	with the ever increasing size and complexity of fully self-consistentsimulations of galaxy formation within the framework of the cosmic web, thedemands upon object finders for these simulations has simultaneously grown. tothis extent we initiated the halo finder comparison project that gatheredtogether all the experts in the field and has so far led to two comparisonpapers, one for dark matter field haloes (knebe et al. 2011), and one for darkmatter subhaloes (onions et al. 2012). however, as state-of-the-art simulationcodes are perfectly capable of not only following the formation and evolutionof dark matter but also account for baryonic physics (e.g. hydrodynamics, starformation, feedback) object finders should also be capable of taking theseadditional processes into consideration. here we report on a comparison ofcodes as applied to the constrained local universe simulation (clues) of theformation of the local group which incorporates much of the physics relevantfor galaxy formation. we compare both the properties of the three main galaxiesin the simulation (representing the mw, m31, and m33) as well as theirsatellite populations for a variety of halo finders ranging from phase-space tovelocity-space to spherical overdensity based codes, including also a merebaryonic object finder. we obtain agreement amongst codes comparable to (if notbetter than) our previous comparisons, at least for the total, dark, andstellar components of the objects. however, the diffuse gas content of thehaloes shows great disparity, especially for low-mass satellite galaxies. thisis primarily due to differences in the treatment of the thermal energy duringthe unbinding procedure. we acknowledge that the handling of gas in halofinders is something that needs to be dealt with carefully, and the precisetreatment may depend sensitively upon the scientific problem being studied.

1210.4158	investigating the velocity structure and x-ray observable properties of  simulated galaxy clusters with phox	non-thermal motions in the intra-cluster medium (icm) are believed to play anon-negligible role in the pressure support to the total gravitating mass ofgalaxy clusters. future x-ray missions, such as astro-h and athena, willeventually allow us to directly detect the signature of these motions fromhigh-resolution spectra of the icm. in this paper, we present a study on a setof clusters extracted from a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, devoted toexplore the role of non-thermal velocity amplitude in characterising thecluster state and the relation between observed x-ray properties. in order toreach this goal, we apply the x-ray virtual telescope phox to generatesynthetic observations of the simulated clusters with both chandra and athena,the latter used as an example for the performance of very high-resolution x-raytelescopes. from chandra spectra we extract global properties, e.g. luminosityand temperature, and from athena spectra we estimate the gas velocitydispersion along the line of sight from the broadening of heavy-ion emissionlines (e.g. fe). we further extend the analysis to the relation betweennon-thermal velocity dispersion of the gas and the l_x-t scaling law for thesimulated clusters. interestingly, we find a clear dependence of slope andscatter on the selection criterion for the clusters, based on the level ofsignificance of non-thermal motions. namely, the scatter in the relation issignificantly reduced by the exclusion of the clusters, for which we estimatethe highest turbulent velocities. such velocity diagnostics appears thereforeas a promising independent way to identify disturbed clusters, in addition tothe commonly used morphological inspection.

1211.3420	the dark halo - spheroid conspiracy and the origin of elliptical  galaxies	dynamical modeling and strong lensing data indicate that the total densityprofiles of early-type galaxies are close to isothermal, i.e., rho_tot ~r^gamma with gamma approx -2. to understand the origin of this universal slopewe study a set of simulated spheroids formed in isolated binary mergers as wellas the formation within the cosmological framework. the total stellar plus darkmatter density profiles can always be described by a power law with an index ofgamma approx -2.1 with a tendency toward steeper slopes for more compact,lower-mass ellipticals. in the binary mergers the amount of gas involved in themerger determines the precise steepness of the slope. this agrees with resultsfrom the cosmological simulations where ellipticals with steeper slopes have ahigher fraction of stars formed in situ. each gas-poor merger event evolves theslope toward gamma ~ -2, once this slope is reached further merger events donot change it anymore. all our ellipticals have flat intrinsic combined stellarand dark matter velocity dispersion profiles. we conclude that flat velocitydispersion profiles and total density distributions with a slope of gamma ~ -2for the combined system of stars and dark matter act as a natural attractor.the variety of complex formation histories as present in cosmologicalsimulations, including major as well as minor merger events, is essential togenerate the full range of observed density slopes seen for present-dayelliptical galaxies.

1304.0585	structure finding in cosmological simulations: the state of affairs	the ever increasing size and complexity of data coming from simulations ofcosmic structure formation demands equally sophisticated tools for theiranalysis. during the past decade, the art of object finding in thesesimulations has hence developed into an important discipline itself. amultitude of codes based upon a huge variety of methods and techniques havebeen spawned yet the question remained as to whether or not they will providethe same (physical) information about the structures of interest. here wesummarize and extent previous work of the "halo finder comparison project": weinvestigate in detail the (possible) origin of any deviations across finders.to this extent we decipher and discuss differences in halo finding methods,clearly separating them from the disparity in definitions of halo properties.we observe that different codes not only find different numbers of objectsleading to a scatter of up to 20 per cent in the halo mass and vmax function,but also that the particulars of those objects that are identified by allfinders differ. the strength of the variation, however, depends on the propertystudied, e.g. the scatter in position, bulk velocity, mass, and the peak valueof the rotation curve is practically below a few per cent, whereas derivedquantities such as spin and shape show larger deviations. our study indicatesthat the prime contribution to differences in halo properties across codesstems from the distinct particle collection methods and -- to a minor extent --the particular aspects of how the procedure for removing unbound particles isimplemented. we close with a discussion of the relevance and implications ofthe scatter across different codes for other fields such as semi-analyticalgalaxy formation models, gravitational lensing, and observables in general.

1306.2307	the hot and energetic universe: a white paper presenting the science  theme motivating the athena+ mission	this white paper, submitted to the recent esa call for science themes todefine its future large missions, advocates the need for a transformationalleap in our understanding of two key questions in astrophysics: 1) how doesordinary matter assemble into the large scale structures that we see today? 2)how do black holes grow and shape the universe? hot gas in clusters, groups andthe intergalactic medium dominates the baryonic content of the local universe.to understand the astrophysical processes responsible for the formation andassembly of these large structures, it is necessary to measure their physicalproperties and evolution. this requires spatially resolved x-ray spectroscopywith a factor 10 increase in both telescope throughput and spatial resolvingpower compared to currently planned facilities. feedback from supermassiveblack holes is an essential ingredient in this process and in most galaxyevolution models, but it is not well understood. x-ray observations canuniquely reveal the mechanisms launching winds close to black holes anddetermine the coupling of the energy and matter flows on larger scales. due tothe effects of feedback, a complete understanding of galaxy evolution requiresknowledge of the obscured growth of supermassive black holes through cosmictime, out to the redshifts where the first galaxies form. x-ray emission is themost reliable way to reveal accreting black holes, but deep survey speed mustimprove by a factor ~100 over current facilities to perform a full census intothe early universe. the advanced telescope for high energy astrophysics(athena+) mission provides the necessary performance (e.g. angular resolution,spectral resolution, survey grasp) to address these questions and revolutionizeour understanding of the hot and energetic universe. these capabilities willalso provide a powerful observatory to be used in all areas of astrophysics.

1307.0011	virial scaling of galaxies in clusters: bright to faint is cool to hot	by combining galaxy tracers from high-resolution n-body and hydrodynamicalsimulations, we present a consistent picture of the behaviour of galaxyvelocities in massive clusters. in haloes above ~ 10^14 msun, the brightestsatellite galaxies are slightly cooler compared to the dark matter, whilefainter satellites are hotter. within the virial radius of a cluster, the meanvelocity dispersion based on the 100 brightest galaxies is a factor of 1.065+/- 0.005 (stat) +/- 0.027 (sys) higher than that of the dark matter(corresponding to a ~10-15 per cent bias in the dynamical mass estimate) whilethat based on only the five brightest galaxies is 0.868 +/- 0.039 (stat) +/-0.035 (sys). these trends are approximately independent of redshift. thevelocity structure is sensitive to the modelling of galaxies in clusters,indicative of the complex interplay of tidal stripping, dynamical friction, andmerging. velocity dispersions derived from instantaneous subhalo properties arelarger than those employing either peak subhalo properties or hydrodynamicalgalaxy tracers. the latter two methods are consistent, implying that stackedspectroscopic analysis of cluster samples should, after correction forprojection, show a trend towards slightly higher velocities when faintergalaxies are included, with an unbiased measure of dark matter velocitydispersion coming from approximately 30 galaxies per cluster. we show evidencethat the velocity distribution function of bright galaxies near the clustercentre has a low-velocity tail due to strong dynamical friction.

1308.3440	strong magnetic fields and large rotation measures in protogalaxies by  supernova seeding	we present a model for the seeding and evolution of magnetic fields inprotogalaxies. supernova (sn) explosions during the assembly of a protogalaxyprovide magnetic seed fields, which are subsequently amplified by compression,shear flows and random motions. we implement the model into the mhd version ofthe cosmological n-body / sph simulation code gadget and we couple the magneticseeding directly to the underlying multi-phase description of star formation.we perform simulations of milky way-like galactic halo formation using astandard lcdm cosmology and analyse the strength and distribution of thesubsequent evolving magnetic field. a dipole-shape divergence-free magneticfield is injected at a rate of 10^{-9}g / gyr within starforming regions, giventypical dimensions and magnetic field strengths in canonical sn remnants.subsequently, the magnetic field strength increases exponentially on timescalesof a few ten million years. at redshift z=0, the entire galactic halo ismagnetized and the field amplitude is of the order of a few $\mu$g in thecenter of the halo, and 10^{-9} g at the virial radius. additionally, weanalyse the intrinsic rotation measure (rm) of the forming galactic halo overredshift. the mean halo intrinsic rm peaks between redshifts z=4 and z=2 andreaches absolute values around 1000 rad m^{-2}. while the halo virializestowards redshift z=0, the intrinsic rm values decline to a mean value below 10rad m^{-2}. at high redshifts, the distribution of individual starforming, andthus magnetized regions is widespread. in our model for the evolution ofgalactic magnetic fields, the seed magnetic field amplitude and distribution isno longer a free parameter, but determined self-consistently by the starformation process occuring during the formation of cosmic structures.

1406.4410	temperature structure of the intra-cluster medium from sph and amr  simulations	analyses of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy clusters suggestthat x-ray masses can be underestimated by 10% to 30%. the largest biasoriginates by both violation of hydrostatic equilibrium and an additionaltemperature bias caused by inhomogeneities in the x-ray emitting intra-clustermedium (icm). to elucidate on this large dispersion among theoreticalpredictions, we evaluate the degree of temperature structures in cluster setssimulated either with smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics (sph) andadaptive-mesh-refinement (amr) codes. we find that the sph simulations producelarger temperature variations connected to the persistence of bothsubstructures and their stripped cold gas. this difference is more evident inno-radiative simulations, while it is reduced in the presence of radiativecooling. we also find that the temperature variation in radiative clustersimulations is generally in agreement with the observed one in the centralregions of clusters. around r_500 the temperature inhomogeneities of the sphsimulations can generate twice the typical hydrostatic-equilibrium mass bias ofthe amr sample. we emphasize that a detailed understanding of the physicalprocesses responsible for the complex thermal structure in icm requiresimproved resolution and high sensitivity observations in order to extend theanalysis to higher temperature systems and larger cluster-centric radii.

1409.3221	a refined sub-grid model for black hole accretion and agn feedback in  large cosmological simulations	in large scale cosmological hydrodynamic simulations simplified sub-gridmodels for gas accretion onto black holes and agn feedback are commonly used.such models typically depend on various free parameters, which are not wellconstrained. we present a new advanced model containing a more detaileddescription of agn feedback, where those parameters reflect the results ofrecent observations. the model takes the dependency of these parameters on theblack hole properties into account and describes a continuous transitionbetween the feedback processes acting in the so-called radio-mode andquasar-mode. in addition, we implement a more detailed description of theaccretion of gas onto black holes by distinguishing between hot and cold gasaccretion. our new implementations prevent black holes from gaining too muchmass, particularly at low redshifts so that our simulations are now verysuccessful in reproducing the observed present-day black hole mass function.our new model also suppresses star formation in massive galaxies slightly moreefficiently than many state-of-the-art models. therefore, the simulations thatinclude our new implementations produce a more realistic population ofquiescent and star-forming galaxies compared to recent observations, even ifsome discrepancies remain. in addition, the baryon conversion efficiencies inour simulation are - except for the high mass end - consistent withobservations presented in literature over the mass range resolved by oursimulations. finally, we discuss the significant impact of the feedback modelon the low-luminous end of the agn luminosity function.

1411.3671	simulating realistic disk galaxies with a novel sub-resolution ism model	we present results of cosmological simulations of disk galaxies carried outwith the gadget-3 treepm+sph code, where star formation and stellar feedbackare described using our multi phase particle integrator (muppi) model. thisdescription is based on simple multi-phase model of the interstellar medium atunresolved scales, where mass and energy flows among the components areexplicitly followed by solving a system of ordinary differential equations.thermal energy from sne is injected into the local hot phase, so as to avoidthat it is promptly radiated away. a kinetic feedback prescription generatesthe massive outflows needed to avoid the over-production of stars. we use twosets of zoomed-in initial conditions of isolated cosmological halos with masses(2-3) * 10^{12} msun, both available at several resolution levels. in all caseswe obtain spiral galaxies with small bulge-over-total stellar mass ratios (b/t\approx 0.2), extended stellar and gas disks, flat rotation curves andrealistic values of stellar masses. gas profiles are relatively flat, moleculargas is found to dominate at the centre of galaxies, with star formation ratesfollowing the observed schmidt-kennicutt relation. stars kinematicallybelonging to the bulge form early, while disk stars show a clear inside-outformation pattern and mostly form after redshift z=2. however, the baryonconversion efficiencies in our simulations differ from the relation given bymoster et al. (2010) at a 3 sigma level, thus indicating that our stellar disksare still too massive for the dark matter halo in which they reside. resultsare found to be remarkably stable against resolution. this further demonstratesthe feasibility of carrying out simulations producing a realistic population ofgalaxies within representative cosmological volumes, at a relatively modestresolution.

1412.6533	anisotropic thermal conduction in galaxy clusters with mhd in gadget	we present an implementation of thermal conduction including the anisotropiceffects of magnetic fields for sph. the anisotropic thermal conduction ismainly proceeding parallel to magnetic fields and suppressed perpendicular tothe fields. we derive the sph formalism for the anisotropic heat transport andsolve the corresponding equation with an implicit conjugate gradient scheme. wediscuss several issues of unphysical heat transport in the cases of extremeansiotropies or unmagnetized regions and present possible numericalworkarounds. we implement our algorithm into the gadget code and study itsbehaviour in several test cases. in general, we reproduce the analyticalsolutions of our idealised test problems, and obtain good results incosmological simulations of galaxy cluster formations. within galaxy clusters,the anisotropic conduction produces a net heat transport similar to anisotropic spitzer conduction model with an efficiency of one per cent. incontrast to isotropic conduction our new formalism allows small-scale structurein the temperature distribution to remain stable, because of their decouplingcaused by magnetic field lines. compared to observations, isotropic conductionwith more than 10 per cent of the spitzer value leads to an oversmoothedtemperature distribution within clusters, while the results obtained withanisotropic thermal conduction reproduce the observed temperature fluctuationswell. a proper treatment of heat transport is crucial especially in theoutskirts of clusters and also in high density regions. it's connection to thelocal dynamical state of the cluster also might contribute to the observedbimodal distribution of cool core and non cool core clusters. our new schemesignificantly advances the modelling of thermal conduction in numericalsimulations and overall gives better results compared to observations.

1502.07357	halo mass function: baryon impact, fitting formulae and implications for  cluster cosmology	we use a set of hydrodynamical (hydro) and dark matter only (dmonly)simulations to calibrate the halo mass function (hmf). we explore the impact ofbaryons, propose an improved parametrization for spherical overdensity massesand identify differences between our dmonly hmf and previously published hmfs.we use the \textit{magneticum} simulations, which are well suited because oftheir accurate treatment of baryons, high resolution, and large cosmologicalvolumes of up to $(3818~\textrm{mpc})^3$. baryonic effects globally decreasethe masses of galaxy clusters, which, at a given mass, results in a decrease oftheir number density. this effect vanishes at high redshift $z\sim2$ and forhigh masses $m_{200\textrm m}\gtrsim10^{14}m\odot$. we perform cosmologicalanalyses of three idealized approximations to the cluster surveys by the southpole telescope (spt), \textit{planck}, and erosita. we pursue two mainquestions: (1) what is the impact of baryons? -- for the spt-like and the\textit{planck}-like samples, the impact of baryons on cosmological results isnegligible. in the erosita-like case, however, neglecting the baryonic impactleads to an underestimate of $\omega_\textrm m$ by about $0.01$, which iscomparable to the expected uncertainty from erosita. (2) how does our dmonlyhmf compare with previous work? -- for the \textit{planck}-like sample, resultsobtained using our dmonly hmf are shifted by$\delta(\sigma_8)\simeq\delta(\sigma_8(\omega_\textrm m/0.27)^{0.3})\simeq0.02$with respect to results obtained using the tinker et al. (2008) fit. thissuggests that using our hmf would shift results from \textit{planck} clusterstoward better agreement with cmb anisotropy measurements. finally, we discussbiases that can be introduced through inadequate hmf parametrizations thatintroduce false cosmological sensitivity.

1505.01170	redshift-space distortions of galaxies, clusters and agn: testing how  the accuracy of growth rate measurements depends on scales and sample  selections	redshift-space clustering anisotropies caused by cosmic peculiar velocitiesprovide a powerful probe to test the gravity theory on large scales. however,to extract unbiased physical constraints, the clustering pattern has to bemodelled accurately, taking into account the effects of non-linear dynamics atsmall scales, and properly describing the link between the selected cosmictracers and the underlying dark matter field. we use a large hydrodynamicsimulation to investigate how the systematic error on the linear growth rate,$f$, caused by model uncertainties, depends on sample selections and comovingscales. specifically, we measure the redshift-space two-point correlationfunction of mock samples of galaxies, galaxy clusters and active galacticnuclei, extracted from the magneticum simulation, in the redshift range 0.2 &lt; z&lt; 2, and adopting different sample selections. we estimate $f\sigma_8$ bymodelling both the monopole and the full two-dimensional anisotropicclustering, using the dispersion model. we find that the systematic error on$f\sigma_8$ depends significantly on the range of scales considered for thefit. if the latter is kept fixed, the error depends on both redshift and sampleselection, due to the scale-dependent impact of non-linearities, if notproperly modelled. on the other hand, we show that it is possible to getunbiased constraints on $f\sigma_8$ provided that the analysis is restricted toa proper range of scales, that depends non trivially on the properties of thesample. this can have a strong impact on multiple tracers analyses, and whencombining catalogues selected at different redshifts.

1510.04277	neutral hydrogen in galaxy clusters: impact of agn feedback and  implications for intensity mapping	by means of zoom-in hydrodynamic simulations we quantify the amount ofneutral hydrogen (hi) hosted by groups and clusters of galaxies. oursimulations, which are based on an improved formulation of smoothed particlehydrodynamics (sph), include radiative cooling, star formation, metalenrichment and supernova feedback, and can be split in two different groups,depending on whether feedback from active galactic nuclei (agn) is turned on oroff. simulations are analyzed to account for hi self-shielding and the presenceof molecular hydrogen. we find that the mass in neutral hydrogen of dark matterhalos monotonically increases with the halo mass and can be well described by apower-law of the form $m_{\rm hi}(m,z)\propto m^{3/4}$. our results point outthat agn feedback reduces both the total halo mass and its hi mass, although itis more efficient in removing hi. we conclude that agn feedback reduces theneutral hydrogen mass of a given halo by $\sim50\%$, with a weak dependence onhalo mass and redshift. the spatial distribution of neutral hydrogen withinhalos is also affected by agn feedback, whose effect is to decrease thefraction of hi that resides in the halo inner regions. by extrapolating ourresults to halos not resolved in our simulations we derive astrophysicalimplications from the measurements of $\omega_{\rm hi}(z)$: halos with circularvelocities larger than $\sim25~{\rm km/s}$ are needed to host hi in order toreproduce observations. we find that only the model with agn feedback iscapable of reproducing the value of $\omega_{\rm hi}b_{\rm hi}$ derived fromavailable 21cm intensity mapping observations.

astro-ph;0008333	radio halos of galaxy clusters from hadronic secondary electron  injection in realistic magnetic field configurations	we investigate the possibility that radio halos of clusters of galaxies arecaused by synchrotron emission of cosmic ray electrons (cre), which wereproduced by cosmic ray protons (crp) interacting hadronically with theintra-cluster medium (icm) protons. we perform cosmologicalmagneto-hydrodynamics (mhd) simulations to obtain a sample of ten magnetizedgalaxy clusters. they provide realistic models of the gas and magnetic fielddistribution, needed to predict the cre production rates, their cooling, andtheir synchrotron emissivity. we assume a crp population within the icm with anenergy density which has a constant ratio to thermal energy density. this ratiois adjusted in such a way that one of the simulated clusters reproduces theradio luminosity of the radio halo of the coma cluster of galaxies. our modelexhibits the observed low degree of radio polarization and has a similar radialemission profile as the coma cluster. we provide estimates for the expectedgamma ray and neutrino flux. the necessary crp/thermal energy ratio is 4 ...14% ${(e_{p,min}/gev)}^{-0.375}$ (for the range of magnetic field strengthssuggested by faraday measurements), where $e_{p,min}$ is the lower kineticenergy cutoff of the crp with spectral index $\alpha_p \approx 2.375$. assumingthis ratio to be the same in the whole set of simulated clusters a $t_x-l_\nu$relation is predicted which follows the observed relation well.

astro-ph;0010296	the effect of magnetic fields on the mass determination of clusters of  galaxies	we test the effects of magnetic fields on the mass determination of galaxyclusters with the x-ray method. as this method takes into account only thermalpressure, additional non-thermal pressure support, e.g. caused by a magneticfield, can result in an underestimation of the mass. sph models of galaxyclusters including magnetic fields of various strengths in two differentcosmologies are used for the test. we compare the true mass of the modelclusters with the mass determined from simulated x-ray images of the samemodels. the effect of the magnetic field on the mass in relaxed clusters isfound to be negligible compared to other uncertainties, even at small radii,where the strongest effects are expected. however in one model, in which thecluster is in the process of merging, we find an effect of up to a factor of 2caused by the magnetic field. in relaxed clusters the mass estimate, averagedover many models, is at most 15% smaller in models with relatively highmagnetic field of $2\mu$g compared to models without a magnetic field with asmall dependence on the cosmology chosen. therefore we conclude that thepresence of a magnetic field cannot be responsible for the discrepancies of afactor of 2-3 found between x-ray and lensing mass in the central regions ofrelaxed clusters.

astro-ph;0409030	constraints on dark energy models from galaxy clusters with multiple  arcs	we make an exploratory study of how well dark energy models can beconstrained using lensed arcs at different redshifts behind cluster lenses.arcs trace the critical curves of clusters, and the growth of critical curveswith source redshift is sensitive to the dark-energy equation of state. usinganalytical models and numerically simulated clusters, we explore the keyfactors involved in using cluster arcs as a probe of dark energy. we quantifythe sensitivity to lens mass, concentration and ellipticity with analyticalmodels that include the effects of dark energy on halo structure. we show withsimple examples how degeneracies between mass models and cosmography may bebroken using arcs at multiple redshifts or additional constraints on the lensdensity profile. however we conclude that the requirements on the data are sostringent that it is very unlikely that robust constraints can be obtained fromindividual clusters. we argue that surveys of clusters, analyzed in conjunctionwith numerical simulations, are a more promising prospect for arc-cosmography.  we use such numerically simulated clusters to estimate how large a sample ofclusters/arcs could provide interesting constraints on dark energy models. wefocus on the scatter produced by differences in the mass distribution ofindividual clusters. we find from our sample of simulated clusters that atleast 1000 pairs of arcs are needed to obtain constraints if the massdistribution of individual clusters is taken to be undetermined. we discussseveral unsolved problems that need study to fully develop this method forprecision studies with future surveys.

astro-ph;0410419	constrained simulations of the magnetic field in the local universe and  the propagation of uhecrs	we use simulations of lss formation to study the build-up of magnetic fields(mfs) in the icm. our basic assumption is that cosmological mfs grow in a mhdamplification process driven by structure formation out of a seed mf present athigh z. our lcdm initial conditions for the density fluctuations have beenstatistically constrained by the observed galaxies, based on the iras 1.2-jyall-sky redshift survey. as a result, prominent galaxy clusters in oursimulation coincide closely with their real counterparts. we find excellentagreement between rms of our simulated clusters and observational data. theimproved resolution compared to previous work also allows us to study the mf inlarge-scale filaments, sheets and voids. by tracing the propagation of uheprotons in the simulated mf we construct full-sky maps of expected deflectionangles of protons with arrival energies e=1e20ev and 4e19ev, respectively.strong deflections are only produced if uhe protons cross clusters, howevercovering only a small area on the sky. multiple crossings of sheets andfilaments over larger distances may give rise to noticeable deflections,depending on the model adopted for the magnetic seed field. based on ourresults we argue that over a large fraction of the sky the deflections arelikely to remain smaller than the present experimental angular sensitivity.therefore, we conclude that forthcoming air shower experiments should be ableto locate sources of uhe protons and shed more light on the nature ofcosmological mfs.

astro-ph;0504206	the impact of gas physics on strong cluster lensing	previous studies of strong gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters neglectedthe potential impact of the intracluster gas. here, we compare simulations ofstrong cluster lensing including gas physics at increasing levels ofcomplexity, i.e. with adiabatic, cooling, star-forming, feedback-receiving, andthermally conducting gas, and with different implementations of the artificialviscosity in the sph simulations. each cluster was simulated starting from thesame initial conditions such as to allow directly comparing the simulatedclusters. we compare the clusters' shapes, dynamics and density profiles andstudy their strong-lensing cross sections computed by means of ray-tracingsimulations. we find that the impact of adiabatic gas depends on the amount ofturbulence that builds up, which means that the artificial viscosity plays animportant role. with the common viscosity implementation, adiabatic gas haslittle effect on strong cluster lensing, while lower viscosity allows strongerturbulence, thus higher non-thermal pressure and a generally broader gasdistribution which tends to lower lensing cross sections. conversely, coolingand star formation steepen the core density profiles and can thus increase thestrong-lensing efficiency considerably.

astro-ph;0508522	a simulation pipeline for the planck mission	we describe an assembly of numerical tools to model the output data of theplanck satellite. these start with the generation of a cmb sky in a chosencosmology, add in various foreground sources, convolve the sky signal witharbitrary, even non-symmetric and polarised beam patterns, derive the timeordered data streams measured by the detectors depending on the chosensatellite-scanning strategy, and include noise signals for the individualdetectors and electronic systems. the simulation products are needed todevelop, verify, optimise, and characterise the accuracy and performance of alldata processing and scientific analysis steps of the planck mission, includingdata handling, data integrity checking, calibration, map making, physicalcomponent separation, and power spectrum estimation. in addition, thesimulations allow detailed studies of the impact of many stochastic andsystematic effects on the scientific results. the efficient implementation ofthe simulation allows the build-up of extended statistics of signal variancesand co-variances.  although being developed specifically for the planck mission, it is expectedthat the employed framework as well as most of the simulation tools will be ofuse for other experiments and cmb-related science in general.

astro-ph;0606006	arc sensitivity to cluster ellipticity, asymmetries and substructures	we investigate how ellipticity, asymmetries and substructures separatelyaffect the ability of galaxy clusters to produce strong lensing events, i.e.gravitational arcs, and how they influence the arc morphologies and fluxes.this is important for those studies aiming, for example, at constrainingcosmological parameters from statistical lensing, or at determining the innerstructure of galaxy clusters through gravitational arcs. we do so by creatingtwo-dimensional gradually smoothed, differently elliptical and asymmetricversions of some numerical models. on average, we find that the contributionsof ellipticity, asymmetries and substructures amount to ~40%, ~10% and ~30% ofthe total strong lensing cross section, respectively. however, our analysisshows that substructures play a more important role in less elliptical andasymmetric clusters, even if located at large distances from the clustercenters (~1mpc/h). conversely, their effect is less important in highlyasymmetric lenses. the morphology, position and flux of individual arcs arestrongly affected by the presence of substructures in the clusters. removingsubstructures on spatial scales &lt;~50kpc/h, roughly corresponding to mass scales&lt;~5 10^{10}m_\odot/h, alters the image multiplicity of ~35% of the sources usedin the simulations and causes position shifts larger than 5'' for ~40% of thearcs longer than 5''. we conclude that any model for cluster lens cannotneglect the effects of ellipticity, asymmetries and substructures. on the otherhand, the high sensitivity of gravitational arcs to deviations from regular,smooth and symmetric mass distributions suggests that strong gravitationallensing is potentially a powerfull tool to measure the level of substructuresand asymmetries in clusters.

astro-ph;0611037	simulating cosmic rays in clusters of galaxies - i. effects on the  sunyaev-zel'dovich effect and the x-ray emission	we performed high-resolution simulations of a sample of 14 galaxy clustersthat span a mass range from 5 x 10^13 m_solar/h to 2 x 10^15 m_solar/h to studythe effects of cosmic rays (crs) on thermal cluster observables such as x-rayemission and the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect. we analyse the cr effects on theintra-cluster medium while simultaneously taking into account the cluster'sdynamical state as well as the mass of the cluster. the modelling of the cosmicray physics includes adiabatic cr transport processes, injection by supernovaeand cosmological structure formation shocks, as well as cr thermalization bycoulomb interaction and catastrophic losses by hadronic interactions. while therelative pressure contained in crs within the virial radius is of the order of2 per cent in our non-radiative simulations, their contribution rises to 32 percent in our simulations with dissipative gas physics including radiativecooling, star formation, and supernova feedback. interestingly, in theradiative simulations the relative cr pressure reaches high values of the orderof equipartition with the thermal gas in each cluster galaxy due to the fastthermal cooling of gas which diminishes the thermal pressure support relativeto that in crs. this also leads to a lower effective adiabatic index of thecomposite gas that increases the compressibility of the intra-cluster medium.this effect slightly increases the central density, thermal pressure and thegas fraction. while the x-ray luminosity in low mass cool core clusters isboosted by up to 40 per cent, the integrated sunyaev-zel'dovich effect appearsto be remarkably robust and the total flux decrement only slightly reduced bytypically 2 per cent. the resolved sunyaev-zel'dovich maps, however, show alarger variation with an increased central flux decrement.
