0901.2347	the xmm-newton wide-field survey in the cosmos field. the point-like  x-ray source catalogue	the cosmos survey is a multiwavelength survey aimed to study the evolution ofgalaxies, agn and the large scale structure. the xmm-cosmos is a deep x-raysurvey over the full 2 deg2 of the cosmos area. it consists of 55 xmm-newtonpointings for a total exposure of ~1.5 ms with an average vignetting correcteddepth of 40 ks across the field of view and a sky coverage of 2.13 deg2. wepresent the catalogue of point-like x-ray sources detected with the epic ccdcameras, the logn-logs relations and the x-ray colour-colour diagrams. theanalysis was performed in the 0.5-2 kev, 2-10 kev and 5-10 kev energy bands.the completeness of the catalogue as well as logn-logs have been calibratedusing monte carlo simulations. the catalogs contains a total of 1887 uniquesources detected in at least one band. the survey, that shows unprecedentedhomogeneity, has a flux limit of ~1.7x10-15 erg cm-2 s-1, ~9.3x10-15 erg cm-2s-1 and ~1.3x10-14 erg cm-2 s-1 over 90% of the area (1.92 deg2) in the 0.5-2kev, 2-10 kev and 5-10 kev energy band, respectively. thanks to the ratherhomogeneous exposure over a large area, the derived logn-logs relations arevery well determined over the flux range sampled by xmm-cosmos. these relationshave been compared with xrb synthesis models, which reproduce the observationswith an agreement of ~10% in the 5-10 kev and 2-10 kev band, while in the 0.5-2kev band the agreement is of the order of ~20%. the hard x-ray colors confirmedthat the majority of the extragalactic sources, in a bright subsample, areactually type i or type ii agn. about 20% of the sources have x-ray luminositytypical of agn (l_x &gt;1042 erg/s) although they do not show any clear signatureof nuclear activity in the optical spectrum.

0901.4627	photometric properties of ly alpha emitters at z=4.86 in the cosmos 2  square degree field	we present results of a survey for ly alpha emitters at z=4.86 based onoptical narrowband (lambda_c=7126 angstrom, delta lambda=73 angstrom) andbroadband (b, v, r', i', and z') observations of the cosmic evolution survey(cosmos) field using suprime-cam on the subaru telescope. we find 79 laecandidates at z=4.86 over a contiguous survey area of 1.83 deg^2, down to thely alpha line flux of 1.47 x 10^-17 ergs s^-1 cm^-2. we obtain the ly alphaluminosity function with a best-fit schechter parameters of logl^*=42.9^+0.5_-0.3 ergs s^-1 and phi^* = 1.2^+8.0_-1.1 x 10^-4 mpc^-3 foralpha=-1.5 (fixed). the two-point correlation function for our lae sample isxi(r) = (r/4.4^+5.7_-2.9 mpc)^-1.90+/-0.22. in order to investigate thefield-to-field variations of the properties of ly alpha emitters, we divide thesurvey area into nine tiles of 0.5^circ x 0.5^circ each. we find that thenumber density varies with a factor of ~ 2 from field to field with highstatistical significance. however, we find no significant field-to-fieldvariance when we divide the field into four tiles with 0.7^circ x 0.7^circeach. we conclude that at least 0.5 deg^2 survey area is required to deriveaveraged properties of laes at z~5, and our survey field is wide enough toovercome the cosmic variance.

0903.3409	the density field of the 10k zcosmos galaxies	we use the current sample of ~10,000 zcosmos spectra of sources selected withi(ab) &lt; 22.5 to define the density field out to z~1, with much greaterresolution in the radial dimension than has been possible with eitherphotometric redshifts or weak lensing. we apply new algorithms that we havedeveloped (zade) to incorporate objects not yet observed spectroscopically bymodifying their photometric redshift probability distributions using thespectroscopic redshifts of nearby galaxies. this strategy allows us to probe abroader range of galaxy environments and reduce the poisson noise in thedensity field. the reconstructed overdensity field of the 10k zcosmos galaxiesconsists of cluster-like patterns surrounded by void-like regions, extending upto z~1. some of these structures are very large, spanning the ~50 mpc/htransverse direction of the cosmos field and extending up to delta z~0.05 inredshift. we present the three dimensional overdensity maps and compare thereconstructed overdensity field to the independently identified virialisedgroups of galaxies and clusters detected in the visible and in x-rays. thedistribution of the overdense structures is in general well traced by thesevirialised structures. a comparison of the large scale structures in thezcosmos data and in the mock catalogues reveals an excellent agreement betweenthe fractions of the volume enclosed in structures of all sizes above a givenoverdensity between the data and the mocks in 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.

0904.0448	stellar and total baryon mass fractions in groups and clusters since  redshift 1	we investigate if the discrepancy between estimates of the total baryon massfraction obtained from observations of the cosmic microwave background (cmb)and of galaxy groups/clusters persists when a large sample of groups isconsidered.  to this purpose, 91 candidate x-ray groups/poor clusters at redshift 0.1 &lt; z&lt; 1 are selected from the cosmos 2 deg^2 survey, based only on their x-rayluminosity and extent. this sample is complemented by 27 nearby clusters with arobust, analogous determination of the total and stellar mass inside r_500. thetotal sample of 118 groups and clusters with z &lt; 1 spans a range in m_500 of~10^13--10^15 m_sun. we find that the stellar mass fraction associated withgalaxies at r_500 decreases with increasing total mass as (m_500)^-0.37 \pm0.04, independent of redshift. estimating the total gas mass fraction from arecently derived, high quality scaling relation, the total baryon mass fraction(f_500^stars+gas=f_500^stars+f_500^gas) is found to increase by ~ 25% whenm_500 increases from &lt;m&gt;=5 x 10^13 m_sun to &lt;m&gt; = 7 x 10^14 m_sun. afterconsideration of a plausible contribution due to intra--cluster light (11--22%of the total stellar mass), and gas depletion through the hierarchical assemblyprocess (10% of the gas mass), the estimated values of the total baryon massfraction are still lower than the latest cmb measure of the same quantity(wmap5), at a significance level of 3.3\sigma for groups of &lt;m&gt;=5 x10^13~m_sun. the discrepancy decreases towards higher total masses, such thatit is 1\sigma at &lt;m&gt;= 7 x 10^14~m_sun. we discuss this result in terms ofnon--gravitational processes such as feedback and filamentary heating.

0906.1873	hst/acs morphology of lyman alpha emitters at redshift 5.7 in the cosmos  field	we present detailed morphological properties of lyman alpha emitters (laes)at z~ 5.7 in the cosmos field, based on {\it hubble space telescope} advancedcamera for surveys (acs) data. the acs imaging in the f814w filter covered 85laes of the 119 laes identified in the full two square degree field, and 47laes of them are detected in the acs images. nearly half of them are spatiallyextended with a size larger than 0.15 arcsec (~0.88 kpc at z=5.7) up to 0.4arcsec (~2.5 kpc at z=5.7). the others are nearly unresolved compact objects.two laes show double-component structures, indicating interaction or merging ofbuilding components to form more massive galaxies. by stacking the acs imagesof all the detected sources, we obtain a sersic parameter of n~0.7 with ahalf-light radius of 0.13 arcsec (0.76 kpc), suggesting that the majority ofacs detected laes have not spheroidal-like but disk-like or irregular lightprofiles. comparing acs f814w magnitudes (i_814) with subaru/suprime-cammagnitudes in the nb816, i', and z' bands, we find that the acs imaging in thef814w band mainly probes uv continuum rather than lyman alpha line emission. uvcontinuum sizes tend to be larger for laes with larger ly\alpha emissionregions as traced by the nb816 imaging. the non-detection of 38 laes in the acsimages is likely due to the fact that their surface brightness is even too lowboth in the uv continuum and lyalpha emission. estimating i_814 for the laeswith acs non-detection from the z' and nb816 magnitudes, we find that 16 ofthese are probably laes with a size larger than 0.15 arcsec in uv continuum.all these results suggest that our lae sample contains systematically largerlaes in uv continuum size than those previously studied at z~6.

0909.2032	the 10k zcosmos: morphological transformation of galaxies in the group  environment since z~1	we study the evolution of galaxies inside and outside of the groupenvironment since z=1 using a large well defined set of groups and galaxiesfrom the zcosmos-bright redshift survey in the cosmos field. the fraction ofgalaxies with early-type morphologies increases monotonically with m_bluminosity and stellar mass and with cosmic epoch. it is higher in the groupsthan elsewhere, especially at later epochs. the emerging environmental effectis superposed on a strong global mass-driven evolution, and at z~0.5 andlog(m*/msol)~10.2, the "effect" of group environment is equivalent to (only)about 0.2 dex in stellar mass or 2 gyr in time. the stellar mass function ofgalaxies in groups is enriched in massive galaxies. we directly determine thetransformation rates from late to early morphologies, and for transformationsinvolving colour and star formation indicators. the transformation rates aresystematically about twice as high in the groups as outside, or up to 3-4 timeshigher correcting for infall and the appearance of new groups. the rates reachvalues, for masses around the crossing mass 10^10.5 msol, as high as(0.3-0.7)/gyr in the groups, implying transformation timescales of 1.4-3 gyr,compared with less than 0.2/gyr, i.e. timescales &gt;5 gyr, outside of groups. allthree transformation rates decrease at higher stellar masses, and must decreasealso at the lower masses below 10^10 msol which we cannot well probe. the ratesinvolving colour and star formation are consistently higher than those formorphology, by a factor of about 50%. our conclusion is that thetransformations which drive the evolution of the overall galaxy populationsince z~1 must occur at a rate 2-4 times higher in groups than outside of them.

0910.0004	the nonlinear biasing of the 10k zcosmos galaxies up to z~1	we use the overdensity field reconstructed in the volume of the cosmos areato study the nonlinear biasing of the zcosmos galaxies. the galaxy overdensityfield is reconstructed using the current sample of ~8500 accurate zcosmosredshifts at i(ab)&lt;22.5 out to z~1 on scales r from 8 to 12 mpc/h. by comparingthe probability distribution function (pdf) of galaxy density contrast delta_gto the lognormal approximation of the pdf of the mass density contrast delta,we obtain the mean biasing function b(delta,z,r) between the galaxy and matteroverdensity field and its second moments b(hat) and b(tilde) up to z~1. overthe redshift interval 0.4&lt;z&lt;1 the conditional mean function &lt;delta_g|delta&gt; =b(delta,z,r) delta is of the following characteristic shape. the functionvanishes in the most underdense regions and then sharply rises in a nonlinearway towards the mean densities. &lt;delta_g|delta&gt; is almost a linear tracer ofthe matter in the overdense regions, up to the most overdense regions in whichit is nonlinear again and the local effective slope of &lt;delta_g|delta&gt; vs.delta is smaller than unity. the &lt;delta_g|delta&gt; function is evolving onlyslightly over the redshift interval 0.4&lt;z&lt;1. the linear biasing parameterincreases from b(hat)=1.24+/-0.11 at z=0.4 to b(hat)=1.64+/-0.15 at z=1 for them_b&lt;-20-z sample of galaxies. b(hat) does not show any dependence on thesmoothing scale from 8 to 12 mpc/h, but increases with luminosity. the measurednonlinearity parameter b(tilde)/b(hat) is of the order of a few percent (but itcan be consistent with 0) and it does not change with redshift, the smoothingscale or the luminosity. by matching the linear bias of galaxies to the halobias, we infer that the m_b&lt;-20-z galaxies reside in dark matter haloes with acharacteristic mass of about 3-6 x 10^12 msol, depending on the halo bias fit.

0910.0444	spectroscopy of luminous z&gt;7 galaxy candidates and sources of  contamination in z&gt;7 galaxy searches	we present three bright z+ dropout candidates selected from deepnear-infrared (nir) imaging of the cosmos 2 square degree field. all threeobjects match the 0.8-8um colors of other published z&gt;7 candidates but arethree magnitudes brighter, facilitating further study. deep spectroscopy of twoof the candidates covering 0.64-1.02um with keck-deimos and all three covering0.94-1.10um and 1.52-1.80um with keck-nirspec detects weak spectral featurestentatively identified as ly-alpha at z=6.95 and z=7.69 in two of the objects.the third object is placed at z~1.6 based on a 24um and weak optical detection.a comparison with the spectral energy distributions of known z&lt;7 galaxies,including objects with strong spectral lines, large extinction, and largesystematic uncertainties in the photometry yields no objects with similarcolors. however, the lambda&gt;1um properties of all three objects can be matchedto optically detected sources with photometric redshifts at z~1.8, so thenon-detection in the i+ and z+ bands are the primary factors which favors a z&gt;7solution. if any of these objects are at z~7 the bright end of the luminosityfunction is significantly higher at z&gt;7 than suggested by previous studies, butconsistent within the statistical uncertainty and the dark matter halodistribution. if these objects are at low redshift, the lyman-break selectionmust be contaminated by a previously unknown population of low redshift objectswith very strong breaks in their broad band spectral energy distributions andblue nir colors. the implications of this result on luminosity functionevolution at high redshift is discussed. we show that the primary limitation ofz&gt;7 galaxy searches with broad filters is the depth of the available opticaldata.

0911.4515	a multiwavelength study of a sample of 70 micron selected galaxies in  the cosmos field i: spectral energy distributions and luminosities	we present a large robust sample of 1503 reliable and unconfused 70micromselected sources from the multiwavelength data set of the cosmic evolutionsurvey (cosmos). using the spitzer irac and mips photometry, we estimate thetotal infrared luminosity, l_ir (8--1000 microns), by finding the best fittemplate from several different template libraries. the long wavelength 70 and160 micron data allow us to obtain a reliable estimate of l_ir, accurate towithin 0.2 and 0.05 dex, respectively. the 70 micron data point enables asignificant improvement over the luminosity estimates possible with only a 24micron detection. the full sample spans a wide range in l_ir, l_ir ~ 10^8-10^14l_sun, with a median luminosity of 10^11.4 l_sun. we identify a total of 687luminous, 303 ultraluminous, and 31 hyperluminous infrared galaxies (lirgs,ulirgs, and hylirgs) over the redshift range 0.01&lt;z&lt;3.5 with a median redshiftof 0.5. presented here are the full spectral energy distributions for each ofthe sources compiled from the extensive multiwavelength data set from theultraviolet (uv) to the far-infrared (fir). using sed fits we find possibleevidence for a subset of cooler ultraluminous objects than observed locally.however, until direct observations at longer wavelengths are obtained, the peakof emission and the dust temperature cannot be well constrained. we use theseseds, along with the deep radio and x-ray coverage of the field, to identify alarge sample of candidate active galactic nuclei (agn). we find that thefraction of agn increases strongly with l_ir, as it does in the local universe,and that nearly 70% of ulirgs and all hylirgs likely host a powerful agn.

1001.1354	the vla-cosmos perspective on the ir-radio relation. i. new constraints  on selection biases and the non-evolution of the ir/radio properties of star  forming and agn galaxies at intermediate and high redshift	vla 1.4 ghz (rms noise ~0.012 mjy) and mips 24 and 70 micron (rms noise ~0.02and ~1.7 mjy, respectively) observations covering the 2 square degree cosmosfield are combined with an extensive multi-wavelength data set to study theevolution of the ir-radio relation at intermediate and high redshift. with~4500 sources -- of which ~30% have spectroscopic redshifts -- the currentsample is significantly larger than previous ones used for the same purpose.both monochromatic ir/radio flux ratios (q24 &amp; q70), as well as the ratio ofthe total ir and the 1.4 ghz luminosity (qtir) are used as indicators for their/radio properties of star forming galaxies and agn.  using a sample jointly selected at ir and radio wavelengths in order toreduce selection biases, we provide firm support for previous findings that their-radio relation remains unchanged out to at least z~1.4. moreover, based ondata from ~150 objects we also find that the local relation likely still holdsat 2.5&lt;z&lt;5. at redshift z&lt;1.4 we observe that radio-quiet agn populate thelocus of the ir-radio relation in similar numbers as star forming sources. inour analysis we employ the methods of survival analysis in order to ensure astatistically sound treatment of flux limits arising from non-detections. wedetermine the observed shift in average ir/radio properties of ir- and radio-selected populations and show that it can reconcile apparently discrepantmeasurements presented in the literature. finally, we also investigatevariations of the ir/radio ratio with ir and radio luminosity and find that ithardly varies with ir luminosity but is a decreasing function of radioluminosity.

1003.0675	identifying dynamically young galaxy groups via wide-angle tail  galaxies: a case study in the cosmos field at z=0.53	we present an analysis of a wide-angle tail (wat) radio galaxy located in agalaxy group in the cosmos field at a redshift of z=0.53 (hereafter cwat-02).we find that the host galaxy of cwat-02 is the brightest galaxy in the group,although it does not coincide with the center of mass of the system. estimatinga) the velocity of cwat-02, relative to the intra-cluster medium (icm), and b)the line-of-sight peculiar velocity of cwat-02's host galaxy, relative to theaverage velocity of the group, we find that both values are higher than thoseexpected for a dominant galaxy in a relaxed system. this suggests thatcwat-02's host group is dynamically young and likely in the process of anongoing group merger. our results are consistent with previous findings showingthat the presence of a wide-angle tail galaxy in a galaxy group or cluster canbe used as an indicator of dynamically young non-relaxed systems. taking theunrelaxed state of cwat-02's host group into account, we discuss the impact ofradio-agn heating from cwat-02 onto its environment, in the context of themissing baryon problem in galaxy groups. our analysis strengthens recentresults suggesting that radio-agn heating may be powerful enough to expelbaryons from galaxy groups.

1006.4956	a multiwavelength study of a sample of 70 micron selected galaxies in  the cosmos field ii: the role of mergers in galaxy evolution	we analyze the morphological properties of a large sample of 1503 70 micronselected galaxies in the cosmos field spanning the redshift range 0.01&lt;z&lt; 3.5with a median redshift of 0.5 and an infrared luminosity range of10^8&lt;l_ir&lt;10^14l_sun with a median luminosity of 10^11.4 l_sun. in generalthese galaxies are massive, with a stellar mass range of 10^10-10^12 m_sun, andluminous, with -25&lt;m_k&lt;-20. we find a strong correlation between the fractionof major mergers and l_ir, with the fraction at the highest luminosity being upto 50%. we also find that the fraction of spirals drops dramatically with l_ir.minor mergers likely play a role in boosting the infrared luminosity forsources with low luminosities. the precise fraction of mergers in any givenl_ir bin varies by redshift due to sources at z&gt;1 being difficult to classifyand subject to the effects of band pass shifting, therefore, these numbers canonly be considered lower limits. at z&lt;1, where the morphologicalclassifications are most robust, major mergers clearly dominate the ulirgpopulation (50-80%) and are important for the lirg population (25-40%). at z&gt;1the fraction of major mergers is at least 30-40% for ulirgs. although thegeneral morphological trends agree with what has been observed for local(u)lirgs, the fraction of major mergers is slightly lower than seen locally.this is in part due to the difficulty of identifying merger signatures at highredshift. we argue that given the number of major gas-rich mergers observed andthe relatively short timescale that they would be observable in the (u)lirgphase that it is plausible for the observed red sequence of massive ellipticals(&lt;10^12 m_sun) to have been formed entirely by gas-rich major mergers.

1007.0692	multi-transition study of m51's molecular gas spiral arms	two selected regions in the molecular gas spiral arms in m51 were mapped withthe owens valley radio observatory (ovro) mm-interferometer in the 12co(2-1),13co(1-0), c18o(1-0), hcn(1-0) and hco+(1-0) emission lines. the co data havebeen combined with the 12co(1-0) data from aalto et al. (1999) covering thecentral 3.5kpc to study the physical properties of the molecular gas. all codata cubes were short spacing corrected using iram 30m (12co(1-0): nro 45m)single dish data. a large velocity gradient (lvg) analysis finds that the giantmolecular clouds (gmcs) are similar to galactic gmcs when studied at 180pc(120pc) resolution with an average kinetic temperature of t_kin = 20(16)k andh_2 density of n(h_2) = 120(240)cm^(-3) when assuming virialized clouds (aconstant velocity gradient dv/dr. the associated conversion factor between h_2mass and co luminosity is close to the galactic value for most regionsanalyzed. our findings suggest that the gmc population in the spiral arms ofm51 is similar to those of the milky way and therefore the strong starformation occurring in the spiral arms has no strong impact on the moleculargas in the spiral arms. extinction inferred from the derived h_2 column densityis very high (a_v about 15 - 30 mag), about a factor of 5-10 higher than theaverage value derived toward hii regions. thus a significant fraction of theongoing star formation could be hidden inside the dust lanes of the spiralarms. a comparison of mips 24um and h_alpha data, however, suggests that thisis not the case and most of the gmcs studied here are not (yet) forming stars.we also present low (4.5") resolution ovro maps of the hcn(1-0) and hco+(1-0)emission at the location of the brightest 12co(1-0) peak.

0709.1009	the h$\alpha$ luminosity function and star formation rate at $z \approx  0.24$ in the cosmos 2 square-degree field	to derive a new h$\alpha$ luminosity function and to understand theclustering properties of star-forming galaxies at $z \approx 0.24$, we havemade a narrow-band imaging survey for h$\alpha$ emitting galaxies in the hstcosmos 2 square degree field. we used the narrow-band filter nb816 ($\lambda_c= 8150$ \aa, $\delta \lambda = 120$ \aa) and sampled h$\alpha$ emitters with$ew_{\rm obs}(\rm h\alpha + [n\textsc{ii}]) &gt; 12$ \aa in a redshift rangebetween $z=0.233$ and $z=0.251$ corresponding to a depth of 70 mpc. we obtained980 h$\alpha$ emitting galaxies in a sky area of 5540 arcmin$^2$, correspondingto a survey volume of $3.1 \times 10^4 {\rm mpc^3}$. we derive a h$\alpha$luminosity function with a best-fit schechter function parameter set of $\alpha= -1.35^{+0.11}_{-0.13}$, $\log\phi_* = -2.65^{+0.27}_{-0.38}$, and $\log l_*({\rm erg s^{-1}}) = 41.94^{+0.38}_{-0.23}$. the h$\alpha$ luminosity densityis $2.7^{+0.7}_{-0.6} \times 10^{39}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ mpc$^{-3}$. aftersubtracting the agn contribution (15 %) to the h$\alpha$ luminosity density,the star formation rate density is evaluated as $1.8^{+0.7}_{-0.4} \times10^{-2}$ $m_{\sun}$ yr$^{-1}$ mpc$^{-3}$. the angular two-point correlationfunction of h$\alpha$ emitting galaxies of $\log l({\rm h\alpha}) &gt; 39.8$ iswell fit by a power law form of $w(\theta) = 0.013^{+0.002}_{-0.001}\theta^{-0.88 \pm 0.03}$, corresponding to the correlation function of $\xi(r)= (r/1.9{\rm mpc})^{-1.88}$. we also find that the h$\alpha$ emitters withhigher h$\alpha$ luminosity are more strongly clustered than those with lowerluminosity.

1102.4329	the redshift and nature of aztec/cosmos 1: a starburst galaxy at z=4.6	based on broad/narrow-band photometry and keck deimos spectroscopy we reporta redshift of z=4.64-0.08+0.06 for aztec/cosmos 1, the brightest sub-mm galaxyin the aztec/cosmos field. in addition to the cosmos-survey x-ray to radiodata, we report observations of the source with herschel/pacs (100, 160micron), cso/sharc ii (350 micron), carma and pdbi (3 mm). we do not detectco(5-4) line emission in the covered redshift ranges, 4.56-4.76 (pdbi/carma)and 4.94-5.02 (carma). if the line is within this bandwidth, this sets 3sigmaupper limits on the gas mass to &lt;~8x10^9 m_sol and &lt;~5x10^10 m_sol,respectively (assuming similar conditions as observed in z~2 smgs). this couldbe explained by a low co-excitation in the source. our analysis of the uv-irspectral energy distribution of aztec 1 shows that it is an extremely young(&lt;~50 myr), massive (m*~10^11 m_sol), but compact (&lt;~2 kpc) galaxy formingstars at a rate of ~1300 m_sol/yr. our results imply that aztec 1 is formingstars in a 'gravitationally bound' regime in which gravity prohibits theformation of a superwind, leading to matter accumulation within the galaxy andfurther generations of star formation.

1203.5542	quest for cosmos submillimeter galaxy counterparts using carma and vla:  identifying three high-redshift starburst galaxies	we report on interferometric observations at 1.3 mm at 2"-3" resolution usingthe combined array for research in millimeter-wave astronomy (carma). weidentify multi-wavelength counterparts of three submillimeter galaxies (smgs;f(1mm)&gt;5.5 mjy) in the cosmos field, initially detected with mambo and aztecbolometers at low, ~10"-30", resolution. all three sources -- aztec/c1, cosbo-3and cosbo-8 -- are identified to coincide with positions of 20 cm radiosources. cosbo-3, however, is not associated with the most likely radiocounterpart, closest to the mambo source position, but that further away fromit. this illustrates the need for intermediate-resolution (~2") mm-observationsto identify the correct counterparts of single-dish detected smgs. all of ourthree sources become prominent only at nir wavelengths, and their mm-to-radioflux based redshifts suggest that they lie at redshifts z&gt;~2. as a proof ofconcept, we show that photometric redshifts can be well determined for smgs,and we find photometric-redshifts of 5.6+/-1.2, 1.9+0.9(-0.5), and ~4 foraztec/c1, cosbo-3, and cosbo-8, respectively. using these we infer that thesegalaxies have radio-based star formation rates of &gt;~1000 msol/yr, and irluminosities of ~10^13 lsol consistent with properties of high-redshift smgs.in summary, our sources reflect a variety of smg properties in terms ofredshift and clustering, consistent with the framework that smgs areprogenitors of z~2 and today's passive galaxies.

1205.6470	millimeter imaging of submillimeter galaxies in the cosmos field:  redshift distribution	we present new iram pdbi 1.3mm continuum observations at ~1.5" resolution of28 smgs previously discovered with the 870um bolometer laboca at apex withinthe central 0.7deg2 of the cosmos field. 19 out of the 28 laboca sources weredetected with the pdbi at a &gt;~3sigma level of ~1.4mjy/b. a combined analysis ofthis new sample with existing interferometrically identified smgs in the cosmosfield yields the following results: 1) &gt;~15%, and possibly up to ~40% ofsingle-dish detected smgs consist of multiple sources, 2) statisticalidentifications of multi-wavelength counterparts to the single-dish smgs yieldthat only ~50% of these single-dish smgs have real radio or ir counterparts, 3)~18% of interferometric smgs have only radio or even no multi-wavelengthcounterpart at all, and 4) ~50-70% of z&gt;~3 smgs have no radio counterparts downto an rms of 7-12ujy at 1.4ghz. using the exact interferometric positions toidentify proper multi-wavelength counterparts allows us to determine accuratephotometric redshifts for these sources. the redshift distributions of thecombined and the individual 1.1mm and 870um selected samples have a higher meanand broader width than the redshift distributions derived in previous studies.our sample supports the previous tentative trend that on average brighterand/or mm-selected smgs are located at higher redshifts. there is a tentativeoffset between the mean redshift for the 1.1mm (&lt;z&gt;=3.1+/-0.4) and 870um(&lt;z&gt;=2.6+/-0.4) selected samples, with the 1.1mm sources lying on average athigher redshifts. based on our nearly complete sample of aztec 1.1mm smgswithin a uniform 0.15deg2 area we infer a higher surface density of z&gt;~4 smgsthan predicted by current cosmological models. in summary, our findings implythat (sub-)millimeter interferometric identifications are crucial to buildstatistically complete and unbiased samples of smgs.

1207.1515	constraints on the faint end of the quasar luminosity function at z~5 in  the cosmos field	we present the result of our low-luminosity quasar survey in the redshiftrange of 4.5 &lt; z &lt; 5.5 in the cosmos field. using the cosmos photometriccatalog, we selected 15 quasar candidates with 22 &lt; i' &lt; 24 at z~5, that are ~3 mag fainter than the sdss quasars in the same redshift range. we obtainedoptical spectra for 14 of the 15 candidates using focas on the subaru telescopeand did not identify any low-luminosity type-1 quasars at z~5 while alow-luminosity type-2 quasar at z~5.07 was discovered. in order to constrainthe faint end of the quasar luminosity function at z~5, we calculated the1sigma confidence upper limits of the space density of type-1 quasars. as aresult, the 1sigma confidence upper limits on the quasar space density are phi&lt;1.33*10^{-7} mpc^{-3} mag^{-1} for -24.52 &lt; m_{1450} &lt; -23.52 and phi&lt;2.88*10^{-7} mpc^{-3} mag^{-1} for -23.52 &lt; m_{1450} &lt; -22.52. the inferred1sigma confidence upper limits of the space density are then used to provideconstrains on the faint-end slope and the break absolute magnitude of thequasar luminosity function at z~5. we find that the quasar space densitydecreases gradually as a function of redshift at low luminosity (m_{1450} ~-23), being similar to the trend found for quasars with high luminosity(m_{1450}&lt;-26). this result is consistent with the so-called downsizingevolution of quasars seen at lower redshifts.

0802.2941	optical selection of faint agn in the cosmos field	we outline a strategy to select faint (i&lt;24.5) type 1 agn candidates down tothe seyfert/qso boundary for spectroscopic targeting in the cosmos field,picking candidates by their nonstellar colors in broadband ground-basedphotometry and morphological properties extracted from hst-acs. agn opticalcolor selection has not been applied to such faint magnitudes in such a largecontinuous part of the sky. hot stars are known to be the dominant contaminantfor bright agn candidate selection at z&lt;2, but we anticipate the highest colorcontamination at all redshifts to be from faint starburst and compact galaxies.morphological selection via the gini coefficient separates most potential agnfrom these faint blue galaxies. recent models of the quasar luminosity functionare used to estimate quasar surface densities, and studies of stellarpopulations in the cosmos field infer stellar contamination. we use 292spectroscopically confirmed type 1 agn and quasar templates to predict agncolors with redshift, and contrast those predictions with the colors of knowncontaminating populations. the motivation of this study and subsequentspectroscopic follow-up is to populate and refine the faint end of the qlfwhere the population of type 1 agn is presently not well known. the anticipatedagn observations will add to the ~300 already known agn in the cosmos field,making cosmos a densely packed field of quasars to be used to understandsupermassive black holes and probe the structure of the intergalactic medium inthe intervening volume.

1410.0702	are dusty galaxies blue? insights on uv attenuation from dust-selected  galaxies	galaxies' rest-frame ultraviolet (uv) properties are often used to directlyinfer the degree to which dust obscuration affects the measurement of starformation rates. while much recent work has focused on calibrating dustattenuation in galaxies selected at rest-frame ultraviolet wavelengths, locallyand at high-$z$, here we investigate attenuation in dusty, star-forminggalaxies (dsfgs) selected at far-infrared wavelengths. by combiningmultiwavelength coverage across 0.15--500\,$\mu$m in the cosmos field, inparticular making use of {\it herschel} imaging, and a rich dataset on localgalaxies, we find a empirical variation in the relationship between rest-frameuv slope ($\beta$) and ratio of infrared-to-ultraviolet emission ($l_{\rmir}/l_{\rm uv}\equiv\,irx$) as a function of infrared luminosity, or total starformation rate, sfr. both locally and at high-$z$, galaxies abovesfr$\gt$50\,m$_\odot$\,yr$^{-1}$ deviate from the nominal $irx-\beta$ relationtowards bluer colors by a factor proportional to their increasing irluminosity. we also estimate contamination rates of dsfgs on high-$z$ dropoutsearches of $\ll1$\%\ at $z\lt4-10$, providing independent verification thatcontamination from very dusty foreground galaxies is low in lbg searches.overall, our results are consistent with the physical interpretation thatdsfgs, e.g. galaxies with $&gt;50$\,m$_\odot$\,yr$^{-1}$, are dominated at allepochs by short-lived, extreme burst events, producing many young o and b starsthat are primarily, yet not entirely, enshrouded in thick dust cocoons. theblue rest-frame uv slopes of dsfgs are inconsistent with the suggestion thatmost dsfgs at $z\sim2$ exhibit steady-state star formation in secular disks.

1501.01080	a turnover in the galaxy main sequence of star formation at $m_{*} \sim  10^{10} m_{\odot}$ for redshifts $z &lt; 1.3$	the relationship between galaxy star formation rates (sfr) and stellar masses($m_\ast$) is re-examined using a mass-selected sample of $\sim$62,000star-forming galaxies at $z \le 1.3$ in the cosmos 2-deg$^2$ field. using newfar-infrared photometry from $herschel$-pacs and spire and $spitzer$-mips 24$\mu$m, along with derived infrared luminosities from the nrk method based ongalaxies' locations in the restframe color-color diagram $(nuv - r)$ vs. $(r -k)$, we are able to more accurately determine total sfrs for our completesample. at all redshifts, the relationship between median $sfr$ and $m_\ast$follows a power-law at low stellar masses, and flattens to nearly constant sfrat high stellar masses. we describe a new parameterization that provides thebest fit to the main sequence and characterizes the low mass power-law slope,turnover mass, and overall scaling. the turnover in the main sequence occurs ata characteristic mass of about $m_{0} \sim 10^{10} m_{\odot}$ at all redshifts.the low mass power-law slope ranges from 0.9-1.3 and the overall scaling risesin sfr as a function of $(1+z)^{4.12 \pm 0.10}$. a broken power-law fit belowand above the turnover mass gives relationships of $sfr \propto m_{*}^{0.88 \pm0.06}$ below the turnover mass and $sfr \propto m_{*}^{0.27 \pm 0.04}$ abovethe turnover mass. galaxies more massive than $m_\ast \gtrsim 10^{10}\ m_{\rm\odot}$ have on average, a much lower specific star formation rate (ssfr) thanwould be expected by simply extrapolating the traditional linear fit to themain sequence found for less massive galaxies.

1506.01715	a massive, distant proto-cluster at z=2.47 caught in a phase of rapid  formation?	numerical simulations of cosmological structure formation show that theuniverse's most massive clusters, and the galaxies living in those clusters,assemble rapidly at early times (2.5 &lt; z &lt; 4). while more than twentyproto-clusters have been observed at z &gt; 2 based on associations of 5-40galaxies around rare sources, the observational evidence for rapid clusterformation is weak. here we report observations of an asymmetric, filamentarystructure at z = 2.47 containing seven starbursting, submillimeter-luminousgalaxies and five additional agn within a comoving volume of 15000 mpc$^{3}$.as the expected lifetime of both the luminous agn and starburst phase of agalaxy is ~100 myr, we conclude that these sources were likely triggered inrapid succession by environmental factors, or, alternatively, the duration ofthese cosmologically rare phenomena is much longer than prior directmeasurements suggest. the stellar mass already built up in the structure is$\sim10^{12}m_{\odot}$ and we estimate that the cluster mass will exceed thatof the coma supercluster at $z \sim 0$. the filamentary structure is in linewith hierarchical growth simulations which predict that the peak of clusteractivity occurs rapidly at z &gt; 2.

(b) the uvcontinuum traces a complete ring which is heavily extincted north of thenucleus. such a ring forms in hydrodynamic models of double bars, but themodels cannot account for the uv emission observed on the leading side of theinner bar.

0808.2746	relation between stellar mass and star formation activity in galaxies	for a mass-selected sample of 66544 galaxies with photometric redshifts fromthe cosmic evolution survey (cosmos), we examine the evolution of starformation activity as a function of stellar mass in galaxies. we estimate thecosmic star formation rates (sfr) over the range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.2, using therest-frame 2800 a flux (corrected for extinction). we find the mean sfr to be astrong function of the galactic stellar mass at any given redshift, withmassive systems (log (m/m(sun)) &gt; 10.5) contributing less (by a factor of ~ 5)to the total star formation rate density (sfrd).  combining data from the cosmos and gemini deep deep survey (gdds), we extendthe sfrd-z relation as a function of stellar mass to z~2. for massive galaxies,we find a steep increase in the sfrd-z relation to z~2; for the less massivesystems, the sfrd which also increases from z=0 to 1, levels off at z~1. thisimplies that the massive systems have had their major star formation activityat earlier epochs (z &gt; 2) than the lower mass galaxies.  we study changes in the sfrds as a function of both redshift and stellar massfor galaxies of different spectral types. we find that the slope of the sfrd-zrelation for different spectral type of galaxies is a strong function of theirstellar mass. for low and intermediate mass systems, the main contribution tothe cosmic sfrd comes from the star-forming galaxies while, for more massivesystems, the evolved galaxies are the most dominant population.

astro-ph;0308545	the mass function of super giant molecular complexes and implications  for forming young massive star clusters in the antennae (ngc 4038/39)	we have used previously published observations of the co emission from theantennae (ngc 4038/39) to study the detailed properties of the super giantmolecular complexes with the goal of understanding the formation of youngmassive star clusters. over a mass range from 5e6 to 9e8 solar masses, themolecular complexes follow a power-law mass function with a slope of -1.4 +/-0.1, which is very similar to the slope seen at lower masses in molecularclouds and cloud cores in the galaxy. compared to the spiral galaxy m51, whichhas a similar surface density and total mass of molecular gas, the antennaecontain clouds that are an order of magnitude more massive. many of theyoungest star clusters lie in the gas-rich overlap region, where extinctions ashigh as av~100 imply that the clusters must lie in front of the gas. combiningdata on the young clusters, thermal and nonthermal radio sources, and themolecular gas suggests that young massive clusters could have formed at aconstant rate in the antennae over the last 160 myr and that sufficient gasexists to sustain this cluster formation rate well into the future. however,this conclusion requires that a very high fraction of the massive clusters thatform initially in the antennae do not survive as long as 100 myr. finally, wecompare our data with two models for massive star cluster formation andconclude that the model where young massive star clusters form from dense coreswithin the observed super giant molecular complexes is most consistent with ourcurrent understanding of this merging system.

astro-ph;0701482	the cosmic evolution survey (cosmos): a large-scale structure at z=0.73  and the relation of galaxy morphologies to local environment	we have identified a large-scale structure at z~0.73 in the cosmos field,coherently described by the distribution of galaxy photometric redshifts, anacs weak-lensing convergence map and the distribution of extended x-ray sourcesin a mosaic of xmm observations. the main peak seen in these maps correspondsto a rich cluster with tx= 3.51+0.60/-0.46 kev and lx=(1.56+/-0.04) x 10^{44}erg/s ([0.1-2.4] kev band). we estimate an x-ray mass within $r500$corresponding to m500~1.6 x 10^{14} msun and a total lensing mass (extrapolatedby fitting a nfw profile) m(nfw)=(6+/-3) x 10^15 msun. we use an automatedmorphological classification of all galaxies brighter than i_ab=24 over thestructure area to measure the fraction of early-type objects as a function oflocal projected density sigma_10, based on photometric redshifts derived fromground-based deep multi-band photometry. we recover a robust morphology-densityrelation at this redshift, indicating, for comparable local densities, asmaller fraction of early-type galaxies than today. interestingly, thisdifference is less strong at the highest densities and becomes more severe inintermediate environments. we also find, however, local "inversions'' of theobserved global relation, possibly driven by the large-scale environment. inparticular, we find direct correspondence of a large concentration of diskgalaxies to (the colder side of) a possible shock region detected in the x-raytemperature map and surface brightness distribution of the dominant cluster. weinterpret this as potential evidence of shock-induced star formation inexisting galaxy disks, during the ongoing merger between two sub-clusters.

astro-ph;9702031	resolution and kinematics of molecular gas surrounding the cloverleaf  quasar at z=2.6 using the gravitational lens	gravitational lenses have long been advertised as primitive telescopes,capable of magnifying cosmologically distant sources (zwicky 1937). in thisletter, we present new 0''.9 resolution co (7-6) observations of the z=2.56cloverleaf quasar (h 1413+117) and spatially resolved images. by modeling thegravitational lens, we infer a size scale of 0''.3 (~1 kpc) for the moleculargas structure surrounding the quasar, and the gas has a kinematic structureroughly consistent with a rotating disk. the observed properties of the coemitting gas are similar to the nuclear starburst complexes found in theinfrared luminous galaxies in the local universe, and metal enrichment byvigorous star formation within this massive nuclear gas complex can explain theabundance of carbon and oxygen in the interstellar medium of this systemobserved when the universe was only a few billion years old. obtainingcorresponding details in an unlensed object at similar distances would be wellbeyond the reach of current instruments, and this study highlights the lessexploited yet powerful use of a gravitational lens as a natural telescope.

astro-ph;9810325	counterrotating nuclear disks in arp 220	the ultraluminous infrared galaxy arp 220 has been observed at 0.5"resolution in co(2-1) and 1 mm continuum using the newly expanded owens valleymillimeter array. the co and continuum peaks at the double nuclei and thesurrounding molecular gas disk are clearly resolved. we find steep velocitygradients across each nucleus (dv ~ 500 km/s within r= 0.3") whose directionsare not aligned with each other and with that of the outer gas disk. weconclude that the double nuclei have their own gas disks (r ~ 100 pc). they arecounterrotating with respect to each other and embedded in the outer gas disk(r ~ 1 kpc) rotating around the dynamical center of the system. the masses ofeach nucleus are m_dyn &gt; 2* 10^9 m_sun based on the co kinematics. althoughthere is no evidence of an old stellar population in the optical or nearinfrared spectroscopy of the nuclei (probably due to the much brighter youngpopulation), it seems likely that these nuclei were 'seeded' from thepre-merger nuclei in view of their counterrotating gas kinematics. the gasdisks probably constitute a significant fraction (~ 50 %) of the mass in eachnucleus. the co and continuum brightness temperatures imply that the nucleargas disks have high area filling factors (~ 0.5-1) and have extremely highvisual extinctions (av ~ 1000 mag). the molecular gas must be hot (&gt;= 40 k) anddense (&gt;= 10^4-5 cm^-3), given the large mass and small scale-height of thenuclear disks. the continuum data suggest that the large luminosity (be itstarburst or agn) must originate within 100 pc of the two nuclear gas diskswhich were presumably formed through concentration of gas from the progenitorouter galaxy disks.

astro-ph;9902005	radial transport of molecular gas to the nuclei of spiral galaxies	the nro/ovro imaging survey of molecular gas in 20 spiral galaxies is used totest the theoretical predictions on bar-driven gas transport, bar dissolution,and bulge evolution. in most galaxies in the survey we find gas condensationsof 10^8-10^9 m_sun within the central kiloparsec, the gas masses beingcomparable to those needed to destroy bars in numerical models. we also find astatistically significant difference in the degree of gas concentration betweenbarred and unbarred galaxies: molecular gas is more concentrated to the centralkiloparsec in barred systems. the latter result supports the theories ofbar-driven gas transport. moreover, it constrains the balance between the rateof gas inflow and that of gas consumption (i.e., star formation, etc.), andalso constrains the timescale of the possible bar dissolution. namely, gasinflow rates to the central kiloparsec, averaged over the ages of the bars,must be larger than the mean rates of gas consumption in the central regions inorder to cause and maintain the higher gas concentrations in barred galaxies.also, the timescale for bar dissolution must be longer than that for gasconsumption in the central regions by the same token.

astro-ph;9903273	massive accretion disks	recent high resolution near infrared (hst-nicmos) and mm-interferometricimaging have revealed dense gas and dust accretion disks in nearbyultra-luminous galactic nuclei. in the best studied ultraluminous ir galaxy,arp 220, the 2 micron imaging shows dust disks in both of the merging galacticnuclei and mm-co line imaging indicates molecular gas masses approx. 10^9 m_sunfor each disk. the two gas disks in arp 220 are counterrotating and theirdynamical masses are approx. 2x10^9 m_sun, that is, only slightly larger thanthe gas masses. these disks have radii approx 100 pc and thickness 10-50 pc.the high brightness temperatures of the co lines indicate that the gas in thedisks has area filling factors of approx. 25-50% and mean densities of &gt;~ 10^4cm^(-3). within these nuclear disks, the rate of massive star formation isundoubtedly prodigious and, given the high viscosity of the gas, there willalso be high radial accretion rates, perhaps &gt;~ 10 m_sun/yr. if this inflowpersists to very small radii, it is enough to feed even the highest luminosityagns.
