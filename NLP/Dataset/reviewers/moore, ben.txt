0901.2536	disk formation and the origin of clumpy galaxies at high redshift	observations of high redshift galaxies have revealed a multitude of largeclumpy rapidly star-forming galaxies. their formation scenario and their linkto present day spirals is still unknown. in this letter we perform adaptivemesh refinement simulations of disk formation in a cosmological context thatare unrivalled in terms of mass and spatial resolution. we find that the socalled "chain-galaxies" and "clump-clusters" are a natural outcome of earlyepochs of enhanced gas accretion from cold dense streams as well as tidally andram-pressured stripped material from minor mergers and satellites. throughinteraction with the hot halo gas, this freshly accreted cold gas settles intoa large disk-like system, not necessarily aligned to an older stellarcomponent, that undergoes fragmentation and subsequent star formation, forminglarge clumps in the mass range 10^7-10^9 m_sun. galaxy formation is a complexprocess at this important epoch when most of the central baryons are beingacquired through a range of different mechanisms - we highlight that a rapidmass loading epoch is required to fuel the fragmentation taking place in themassive arms in the outskirts of extended disks, an accretion mode that occursnaturally in the hierarchical assembly process at early epochs.

0902.2759	galactic dynamics and local dark matter	the concordance lambda cold dark matter (lambda-cdm) model for the formationof structure in the universe, while remarkably successful at describingobservations of structure on large scales, continues to be challenged byobservations on galactic scales. fortunately, cdm models and their variousproposed alternatives make a rich variety of testable predictions that make thelocal group and our own milky way galaxy key laboratories for exploring darkmatter (dm) in this regime. however, some of the most definitive tests of localdm require microarcsecond astrometry of faint sources, an astrometric regimethat is a unique niche of sim lite. this chapter explores the important anddistinct contributions that can be made by sim lite in the exploration ofgalaxy dynamics and dm on galaxy scales and that have cosmologicalconsequences. key areas of potential sim lite exploration include (1) measuringthe shape, orientation, density law, and lumpiness of the dark halo of themilky way and other nearby galaxies, (2) determining the orbits of galacticsatellites, which may be representatives of late infall from the hierarchicalformation of the milky way, (3) ascertaining the distribution of angularmomentum and orbital anisotropy of stars and globular clusters to the outerreaches of the galactic halo, dynamical properties that hold clues to the earlyhierarchical formation of the galaxy, (4) measuring the physical nature of dmby placing strong constraints on the phase space density in the cores of nearbydsph galaxies, and (5) reconstructing the dynamical history of the local groupthrough the determination of orbits and masses of its constituent galaxies.

0902.2835	properties of dark matter revealed by astrometric measurements of the  milky way and local galaxies	the fact that dark matter (dm), thus far, has revealed itself only on scalesof galaxies and larger, again thrusts onto astrophysics the opportunity and theresponsibility to confront the age old mystery "what is the nature of matter?"by deriving basic data on the nature of dm - e.g., mass of its particle(s),present mean temperature, distribution in galaxies and other structures in theuniverse, and capacity for dissipational collapse - we will be uncovering theproperties of the dominant species of matter in the universe and significantlyextending the standard models of particle physics. determining the mass of thedm particle to an order of magnitude would help to sort out the particle familyto which it (or they) belongs. beyond mass, there are issues of stability. thedm particle may be unstable with a measurable half-life, or it may becomeunstable after absorbing a certain amount of energy from collisions. in bothcases it would contribute to the present hot dark matter component.  some key parameters of dm can most accurately be measured in the very nearbyuniverse because dm dominates the mass in the outer milky way (mw), in othergalaxies in the local group, and in the local group in its entirety. thepresence and amount of dm can be quantified by study of dynamical processesobservable in fine detail within these entities. precise measurements of 3-dvelocities for stars, coherent star streams, and stars in satellite stellarsystems out to the edge of the galaxy can reveal "what is the shape,orientation, density law, and lumpiness of the dark matter halo" as well as"what is the total mass of the galaxy?"

0905.1126	effects of ram pressure on the gas distribution and star formation in  the large magellanic cloud	we use high resolution n-body/sph simulations to study the hydrodynamicalinteraction between the large magellanic cloud (lmc) and the hot halo of themilky way. we investigate whether ram-pressure acting on the satellite's ismcan explain the peculiarities observed in the hi distribution and the locationof the recent star formation activity. due to the present nearly edge-onorientation of the disk with respect to the orbital motion, compression at theleading edge can explain the high density region observed in hi at thesouth-east border. in the case of a face-on disk (according to mastropietro etal. 2008 the lmc was moving almost face-on before the last perigalacticpassage), ram-pressure directed perpendicularly to the disk produces a clumpystructure characterized by voids and high density filaments that resemble thoseobserved by the parkes hi survey. as a consequence of the very recent edge-onmotion, the h-alpha emission is mainly concentrated on the eastern side where30 doradus and most of the supergiant shells are located, although some h-alphacomplexes form a patchy distribution on the entire disk. in this scenario onlythe youngest stellar complexes show a progression in age along the leadingborder of the disk.

0906.4340	the structure and evolution of cold dark matter halos	in the standard cosmological model a mysterious cold dark matter (cdm)component dominates the formation of structures. numerical studies of theformation of cdm halos have produced several robust results that allow uniquetests of the hierarchical clustering paradigm. universal properties of halos,including their mass profiles and substructure properties are roughlyconsistent with observational data from the scales of dwarf galaxies to galaxyclusters. resolving the fine grained structure of halos has enabled us to makepredictions for ongoing and planned direct and indirect dark matter detectionexperiments.  while simulations of pure cdm halos are now very accurate and in goodagreement (recently claimed discrepancies are addressed in detail in thisreview), we are still unable to make robust, quantitative predictions aboutgalaxy formation and about how the dark matter distribution changes in theprocess. whilst discrepancies between observations and simulations have beenthe subject of much debate in the literature, galaxy formation and evolutionneeds to be understood in more detail in order to fully test the cdm paradigm.whatever the true nature of the dark matter particle is, its clusteringproperties must not be too different from a cold neutralino like particle tomaintain all the successes of the model in matching large scale structure dataand the global properties of halos which are mostly in good agreement withobservations.

0707.0737	the causes of halo shape changes induced by cooling baryons: disks  versus substructures	cold dark matter cosmogony predicts triaxial dark matter halos, whereasobservations find quite round halos. this is most likely due to thecondensation of baryons leading to rounder halos. we examine the halo phasespace distribution basis for such shape changes. triaxial halos are supportedby box orbits, which pass arbitrarily close to the density center. the decreasein triaxiality caused by baryons is thought to be due to the scattering ofthese orbits. we test this hypothesis with simulations of disks grown insidetriaxial halos. after the disks are grown we check whether the phase spacestructure has changed by evaporating the disks and comparing the initial andfinal states. while the halos are substantially rounder when the disk is atfull mass, their final shape after the disk is evaporated is not much differentfrom the initial. likewise, the halo becomes (more) radially anisotropic whenthe disk is grown, but the final anisotropy is consistent with the initial.only if the baryons are unreasonably compact or massive does the halo changeirreversibly. we show that the character of individual orbits is not generallychanged by the growing mass. thus the central condensation of baryons does notdestroy enough box orbits to cause the shape change. rather, box orbits merelybecome rounder along with the global potential. however, if angular momentum istransferred to the halo, either via satellites or via bars, a largeirreversible change in the halo distribution occurs. the ability of satellitesto alter the phase space distribution of the halo is of particular concern togalaxy formation simulations since halo triaxiality can profoundly influencethe evolution of disks.

1002.3167	multi-wavelength properties of barred galaxies in the local universe. i:  virgo cluster	we study in detail how the barred galaxy fraction varies as a function ofluminosity, hi gas mass, morphology and color in the virgo cluster in order toprovide a well defined, statistically robust measurement of the bar fraction inthe local universe spanning a wide range in luminosity (factor of ~100) and higas mass. we combine multiple public data-sets (ukidss near-infrared imaging,alfalfa hi gas masses, goldmine photometry). after excluding highly inclinedsystems, we define three samples where galaxies are selected by their b-bandluminosity, h-band luminosity, and hi gas mass. we visually assign bars usingthe high resolution h-band imaging from ukidss. when all morphologies areincluded, the barred fraction is ~17-24% while for morphologically selecteddiscs, we find that the barred fraction in virgo is ~29-34%: it does not dependstrongly on how the sample is defined and does not show variations withluminosity or hi gas mass. the barred fraction depends most strongly on themorphological composition of the sample: when the disc populations areseparated into lenticulars (s0--s0/a), early-type spirals (sa--sb), andlate-type spirals (sbc--sm), we find that the early-type spirals have a higherbarred fraction (~45-50%) compared to the lenticulars and late-type spirals(~22-36%). this difference may be due to the higher baryon fraction ofearly-type discs which makes them more susceptible to bar instabilities. we donot find any evidence of barred galaxies being preferentially blue.

1003.4744	mass distribution in galaxy clusters: the role of agn feedback	we use 1 kpc resolution cosmological amr simulations of a virgo-like galaxycluster to investigate the effect of feedback from supermassive black holes(smbh) on the mass distribution of dark matter, gas and stars. we comparedthree different models: (i) a standard galaxy formation model featuring gascooling, star formation and supernovae feedback, (ii) a "quenching" model forwhich star formation is artificially suppressed in massive halos and finally(iii) the recently proposed agn feedback model of booth &amp; schaye (2009).without agn feedback (even in the quenching case), our simulated clustersuffers from a strong overcooling problem, with a stellar mass fractionsignificantly above observed values in m87. the baryon distribution is highlyconcentrated, resulting in a strong adiabatic contraction (ac) of dark matter.with agn feedback, on the contrary, the stellar mass in the bright centralgalaxy (bcg) lies below observational estimates and the overcooling problemdisappears. the stellar mass of the bcg is seen to increase with increasingmass resolution, suggesting that our stellar masses converges to the correctvalue from below. the gas and total mass distributions are in strikingagreement with observations. we also find a slight deficit (~10%) of baryons atthe virial radius, due to the effect of agn-driven shock waves pushing gas tompc scales and beyond. this baryon deficit results in a slight adiabaticexpansion of the dark matter distribution, that can be explained quantitativelyby ac theory.

1004.0005	the formation of disc galaxies in a lcdm universe	we study the formation of disc galaxies in a fully cosmological frameworkusing adaptive mesh refinement simulations. we perform an extensive parameterstudy of the main subgrid processes that control how gas is converted intostars and the coupled effect of supernovae feedback. we argue that previousattempts to form disc galaxies have been unsuccessful because of the universaladoption of strong feedback combined with high star formation efficiencies.unless extreme amounts of energy are injected into the interstellar mediumduring supernovae events, these star formation parameters result in bulgedominated s0/sa galaxies as star formation is too efficient at z~3. we showthat a low efficiency of star-formation more closely models the subparsecphysical processes, especially at high redshift. we highlight the successfulformation of extended disc galaxies with scale lengths r_d=4-5 kpc, flatrotation curves and bulge to disc ratios of b/d~1/4. not only do we resolve theformation of a milky way-like spiral galaxy, we also observe the secularevolution of the disc as it forms a pseudo-bulge. the disc properties agreewell with observations and are compatible with the photometric and baryonictully-fisher relations, the kennicutt-schmidt relation and the observed angularmomentum content of spiral galaxies. we conclude that underlying small-scalestar formation physics plays a larger role than previously considered insimulations of galaxy formation.

1005.3139	reionization of the local group of galaxies	we present the first detailed structure formation and radiative transfersimulations of the reionization history of our cosmic neighbourhood. to thisend, we follow the formation of the local group of galaxies and nearby clustersby means of constrained simulations, which use the available observationalconstraints to construct a representation of those structures which reproducestheir actual positions and properties at the present time. we find that thereionization history of the local group is strongly dependent on the assumedphoton production efficiencies of the ionizing sources, which are still poorlyconstrained. if sources are relatively efficient, i.e. the process is'photon-rich', the local group is primarily ionized externally by the nearbyclusters. alternatively, if the sources are inefficient, i.e. reionization is'photon-poor' the local group evolves largely isolated and reionizes itself.the mode of reionization, external vs. internal, has important implications forthe evolution of our neighbourhood, in terms of e.g. its satellite galaxypopulations and primordial stellar populations. this therefore provides animportant avenue for understanding the young universe by detailed studies ofour nearby structures.

1006.1322	systematic uncertainties in the determination of the local dark matter  density	a precise determination of the local dark matter density and an accuratecontrol over the corresponding uncertainties are of paramount importance fordark matter (dm) searches. using very recent high-resolution numericalsimulations of a milky way like object, we study the systematic uncertaintiesthat affect the determination of the local dark matter density based ondynamical measurements in the galaxy. in particular, extracting from thesimulation with baryons the orientation of the galactic stellar disk withrespect to the dm distribution, we study the dm density for an observer locatedat $\sim$8 kpc from the galactic center {\it on the stellar disk}, $\rho_0$.this quantity is found to be always larger than the average density in aspherical shell of same radius $\bar{\rho}_0$, which is the quantity inferredfrom dynamical measurements in the galaxy, and to vary in the range$\rho_0/\bar{\rho}_0=1.01-1.41$. this suggests that the actual dark matterdensity in the solar neighbourhood is on average 21\% larger than the valueinferred from most dynamical measurements, and that the associated systematicerrors are larger than the statistical errors recently discussed in theliterature.

1007.0579	from planetesimals to terrestrial planets: n-body simulations including  the effects of nebular gas and giant planets	we present results from a suite of n-body simulations that follow theaccretion history of the terrestrial planets using a new parallel treecode thatwe have developed. we initially place 2000 equal size planetesimals between0.5--4.0 au and the collisional growth is followed until the completion ofplanetary accretion (&gt; 100 myr). all the important effect of gas in laminardisks are taken into account: the aerodynamic gas drag, the disk-planetinteraction including type i migration, and the global disk potential whichcauses inward migration of secular resonances as the gas dissipates. we varythe initial total mass and spatial distribution of the planetesimals, the timescale of dissipation of nebular gas, and orbits of jupiter and saturn. we endup with one to five planets in the terrestrial region. in order to maintainsufficient mass in this region in the presence of type i migration, the timescale of gas dissipation needs to be 1-2 myr. the final configurations andcollisional histories strongly depend on the orbital eccentricity of jupiter.if today's eccentricity of jupiter is used, then most of bodies in theasteroidal region are swept up within the terrestrial region owing to theinward migration of the secular resonance, and giant impacts betweenprotoplanets occur most commonly around 10 myr. if the orbital eccentricity ofjupiter is close to zero, as suggested in the nice model, the effect of thesecular resonance is negligible and a large amount of mass stays for a longperiod of time in the asteroidal region. with a circular orbit for jupiter,giant impacts usually occur around 100 myr, consistent with the accretion timescale indicated from isotope records. however, we inevitably have an earth sizeplanet at around 2 au in this case. it is very difficult to obtain spatiallyconcentrated terrestrial planets together with very late giant impacts.

1105.4616	how common are earth-moon planetary systems?	the earth's comparatively massive moon, formed via a giant impact on theproto-earth, has played an important role in the development of life on ourplanet, both in the history and strength of the ocean tides and in stabilizingthe chaotic spin of our planet. here we show that massive moons orbitingterrestrial planets are not rare. a large set of simulations by morishima etal., 2010, where earth-like planets in the habitable zone form, provides theraw simulation data for our study. we use limits on the collision parametersthat may guarantee the formation of a circumplanetary disk after a protoplanetcollision that could form a satellite and study the collision history and thelong term evolution of the satellites qualitatively. in addition, we estimateand quantify the uncertainties in each step of our study. we find that giantimpacts with the required energy and orbital parameters for producing a binaryplanetary system do occur with more than 1 in 12 terrestrial planets hosting amassive moon, with a low-end estimate of 1 in 45 and a high-end estimate of 1in 4.

1106.5371	the formation of the brightest cluster galaxies in cosmological  simulations: the case for agn feedback	we use 500 pc resolution cosmological simulations of a virgo-like galaxycluster to study the properties of the brightest cluster galaxy (bcg) thatforms at the center of the halo. we compared two simulations; one incorporatingonly supernovae feedback and a second that also includes prescriptions forblack hole growth and the resulting agn feedback from gas accretion. asprevious work has shown, with supernovae feedback alone we are unable toreproduce any of the observed properties of massive cluster ellipticals. theresulting bcg is rotating quickly, has a high sersic index, a strong massexcess in the center and a total central density profile falling more steeplythan isothermal. furthermore, it is far too efficient at converting most of theavailable baryons into stars which is strongly constrained by abundancematching. with a treatment of black hole dynamics and agn feedback the bcgproperties are in good agreement with data: they rotate slowly, have a coredsurface density profile, a flat or rising velocity dispersion profile and a lowstellar mass fraction. the agn provides a new mechanism to create cores inluminous elliptical galaxies; the core expands due to the combined effects ofheating from dynamical friction of sinking massive black holes and agn feedbackthat ejects gaseous material from the central regions.

1111.1532	multi-wavelength properties of barred galaxies in the local universe:  environment and evolution across the hubble sequence	we investigate possible environmental and morphological trends in the$z\sim0$ bar fraction using two carefully selected samples representative of alow-density environment (the isolated galaxies from the amiga sample) and of adense environment (galaxies in the virgo cluster). galaxies span a stellar massrange from $10^8$ to $10^{12}$m$_{\odot}$ and are visually classified usingboth high-resolution nir (h-band) imaging and optical \texttt{rgb} images. wefind that the bar fraction in disk galaxies is independent of environmentsuggesting that bar formation may occur prior to the formation of galaxyclusters. the bar fraction in early type spirals ($sa-sb$) is $\sim$50%, whichis twice as high as the late type spirals ($sbc-sm$). the higher bar fractionin early type spirals may be due to the fact that a significant fraction oftheir bulges are pseudo-bulges which form via the buckling instability of abar. i.e. a large part of the hubble sequence is due to secular processes whichmove disc galaxies from late to early types. there is a hint of a higher barfraction with higher stellar masses which may be due to the susceptibility tobar instabilities as the baryon fractions increase in halos of larger masses.overall, the $s0$ population has a lower bar fraction than the $sa-sb$ galaxiesand their barred fraction drops significantly with decreasing stellar mass.this supports the notion that $s0s$ form via the transformation of diskgalaxies that enter the cluster environment. the gravitational harassmentthickens the stellar disks, wiping out spiral patterns and eventually erasingthe bar - a process that is more effective at lower galaxy masses.

0704.3078	influence of orbital behaviour and chaos on the shape of dark matter  halos	it has been shown that the dissipative gas infall during galaxy formation hasthe capability to modify the shape of dark matter halos. in this paper weperform the first detailed analysis of particle orbits in a cosmological darkmatter halos to understand {\it how} and {\it why} baryons alter its shape. weperform a series of numerical experiments where we grow a baryonic core insidea live dark matter halo extracted from a cosmological simulation. we follow theorbits of more than 300 particles with more that 50000 timesteps. our resultsclearly show that the dissipational component is responsible for repeatedlydeflecting orbits which visit often the center of the system. moreover thegravitational potential time dependence associated with the growth of thebaryonic mass, shifts the frequencies of the orbits, making them extremelychaotic. this randomization makes the orbits explore a large phase space. whenthis effect takes place for a significant number of orbits it will bemanifested in the density distribution as an approach to a rounderconfiguration. as a consequence, the influence of the central mass on the shapeof the phase space decreases with increasing distance from the center. wediscuss the importance of future analysis of controlled experiments (i.e. usinganalytic potentials instead of live dm halos) to better decipher the dynamicsof this phenomenon.

0710.3189	multimass spherical structure models for n-body simulations	we present a simple and efficient method to set up spherical structure modelsfor n-body simulations with a multimass technique. this technique reduces by asubstantial factor the computer run time needed in order to resolve a givenscale as compared to single-mass models. it therefore allows to resolve smallerscales in n-body simulations for a given computer run time. here, we presentseveral models with an effective resolution of up to 1.68 x 10^9 particleswithin their virial radius which are stable over cosmologically relevanttime-scales. as an application, we confirm the theoretical prediction by dehnen(2005) that in mergers of collisonless structures like dark matter haloesalways the cusp of the steepest progenitor is preserved. we model each mergerprogenitor with an effective number of particles of approximately 10^8particles. we also find that in a core-core merger the central densityapproximately doubles whereas in the cusp-cusp case the central density onlyincreases by approximately 50%. this may suggest that the central region offlat structures are better protected and get less energy input through themerger process.

1112.0330	nonlinear evolution of cosmological structures in warm dark matter  models	the dark energy dominated warm dark matter (wdm) model is a promisingalternative cosmological scenario. we explore large-scale structure formationin this paradigm. we do this in two different ways: with the halo modelapproach and with the help of an ensemble of high resolution n-bodysimulations. combining these quasi-independent approaches, leads to a physicalunderstanding of the important processes which shape the formation ofstructures. we take a detailed look at the halo mass function, theconcentrations and the linear halo bias of wdm. in all cases we findinteresting deviations with respect to cdm. in particular, theconcentration-mass relation displays a turnover for group scale dark matterhaloes, for the case of wdm particles with masses of the order ~0.25 kev. thismay be interpreted as a hint for top-down structure formation on small scales.we implement our results into the halo model and find much better agreementwith simulations. on small scales the wdm halo model now performs as well asits cdm counterpart.

1112.2213	evidence for inhomogeneous reionization in the local universe from  metal-poor globular cluster systems	exploiting a fundamental characteristic of galaxy assembly in the{\lambda}cdm paradigm, the observed spatial biasing and kinematics ofmetal-poor globular star clusters are used to constrain the local reionizationepoch around individual galaxies. selecting three galaxies located in differentenvironments, the first attempt at constraining the environmental propagationof reionization in the local universe is carried out. the joint constraint fromthe three galaxies (z_reion = 10.5^{+1.0}_{-0.9}) agrees remarkably well withthe latest wmap constraint on z_reion for a simple instantaneous reionizationmodel. more importantly, the range of z_reion values found here are consistentwith the global range of z_reion estimates from other observations. wefurthermore find a 1.7{\sigma} indication that reionization completed inlow-density environments before the intergalactic medium in high-densityenvironments was reionized. this is consistent with certain theoretical modelsthat predict that reionization was globally prolonged in duration, with neutralhydrogen pockets surviving in high-density environments, even after thesurrounding regions were reionized. more generally, this work provides a usefulconstraint on the formation history of galaxy stellar halos.

1112.2752	the effects of baryon physics, black holes and agn feedback on the mass  distribution in clusters of galaxies	the spatial distribution of matter in clusters of galaxies is mainlydetermined by the dominant dark matter component, however, physical processesinvolving baryonic matter are able to modify it significantly. we analyse a setof 500 pc resolution cosmological simulations of a cluster of galaxies withmass comparable to virgo, performed with the amr code ramses. we compare themass density profiles of the dark, stellar and gaseous matter components of thecluster that result from different assumptions for the subgrid baryonic physicsand galaxy formation processes. first, the prediction of a gravity only n-bodysimulation is compared to that of a hydrodynamical simulation with standardgalaxy formation recipes, then all results are compared to a hydrodynamicalsimulation which includes thermal agn feedback from super massive black holes(smbh). we find the usual effects of overcooling and adiabatic contraction inthe run with standard galaxy formation physics, but very different results arefound when implementing smbhs and agn feedback. star formation is stronglyquenched, producing lower stellar densities throughout the cluster, and muchless cold gas is available for star formation at low redshifts. at redshift z =0 we find a flat density core of radius 10 kpc in both of the dark and stellarmatter density profiles. we specu- late on the possible formation mechanismsable to produce such cores and we conclude that they can be produced throughthe coupling of different processes: (i) dynamical friction from the decay ofblack hole orbits during galaxy mergers; (ii) agn driven gas outflows producingfluctuations of the gravitational potential causing the removal ofcollisionless matter from the central region of the cluster; (iii) adiabaticexpansion in response to the slow expulsion of gas from the central region ofthe cluster during the quiescent mode of agn activity.

1202.1282	cores in warm dark matter haloes: a catch 22 problem	the free streaming of warm dark matter particles dampens the fluctuationspectrum, flattens the mass function of haloes and imprints a fine grainedphase density limit for dark matter structures. the phase space density limitis expected to imprint a constant density core at the halo center on thecontrary to what happens for cold dark matter. we explore these effects usinghigh resolution simulations of structure formation in different warm darkmatter scenarios. we find that the size of the core we obtain in simulatedhaloes is in good agreement with theoretical expectations based on liouville'stheorem. however, our simulations show that in order to create a significantcore, (r_c~1 kpc), in a dwarf galaxy (m~1e10 msun), a thermal candidate with amass as low as 0.1 kev is required. this would fully prevent the formation ofthe dwarf galaxy in the first place. for candidates satisfying large scalestructure constrains (m_wdm larger than 1-2 kev) the expected size of the coreis of the order of 10 (20) pc for a dark matter halo with a mass of 1e10 (1e8)msun. we conclude that "standard" warm dark matter is not viable solution forexplaining the presence of cored density profiles in low mass galaxies.

0711.1162	the formation of ultra-compact dwarf galaxies and nucleated dwarf  galaxies	ultra compact dwarf galaxies (ucds) have similar properties as massiveglobular clusters or the nuclei of nucleated galaxies. recent observationssuggesting a high dark matter content and a steep spatial distribution withingroups and clusters provide new clues as to their origins. we performhigh-resolution n-body / smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations designedto elucidate two possible formation mechanisms for these systems: the mergingof globular clusters in the centre of a dark matter halo, or the massivelystripped remnant of a nucleated galaxy. both models produce density profiles aswell as the half light radii that can fit the observational constraints.however, we show that the first scenario results to ucds that are underluminousand contain no dark matter. this is because the sinking process ejects most ofthe dark matter particles from the halo centre. stripped nuclei give a morepromising explanation, especially if the nuclei form via the sinking of gas,funneled down inner galactic bars, since this process enhances the central darkmatter content. even when the entire disk is tidally stripped away, the nucleusstays intact and can remain dark matter dominated even after severe stripping.total galaxy disruption beyond the nuclei only occurs on certain orbits anddepends on the amount of dissipation during nuclei formation. by comparing thetotal disruption of cdm subhaloes in a cluster potential we demonstrate thatthis model also leads to the observed spatial distribution of ucds which can betested in more detail with larger data sets.

1206.5302	toward an accurate mass function for precision cosmology	cosmological surveys aim to use the evolution of the abundance of galaxyclusters to accurately constrain the cosmological model. in the context oflcdm, we show that it is possible to achieve the required percent levelaccuracy in the halo mass function with gravity-only cosmological simulations,and we provide simulation start and run parameter guidelines for doing so. someprevious works have had sufficient statistical precision, but lacked robustverification of absolute accuracy. convergence tests of the mass function with,for example, simulation start redshift can exhibit false convergence of themass function due to counteracting errors, potentially misleading one to inferoverly optimistic estimations of simulation accuracy. percent level accuracy ispossible if initial condition particle mapping uses second order lagrangianperturbation theory, and if the start epoch is between 10 and 50 expansionfactors before the epoch of halo formation of interest. the mass function forhalos with fewer than ~1000 particles is highly sensitive to simulationparameters and start redshift, implying a practical minimum mass resolutionlimit due to mass discreteness. the narrow range in converged start redshiftsuggests that it is not presently possible for a single simulation to captureaccurately the cluster mass function while also starting early enough to modelaccurately the numbers of reionisation era galaxies, whose baryon feedbackprocesses may affect later cluster properties. ultimately, to fully exploitcurrent and future cosmological surveys will require accurate modeling ofbaryon physics and observable properties, a formidable challenge for whichaccurate gravity-only simulations are just an initial step.

1209.3635	on the origin of elemental abundances in the terrestrial planets	the abundances of elements in the earth and the terrestrial planets providethe initial conditions for life and clues as to the history and formation ofthe solar system. we follow the pioneering work of bond et al. (2010) andcombine circumstellar disk models, chemical equilibrium calculations anddynamical simulations of planet formation to study the bulk composition ofrocky planets. we use condensation sequence calculations to estimate theinitial abundance of solids in the circumstellar disk with propertiesdetermined from time dependent theoretical models. we combine this withdynamical simulations of planetesimal growth that trace the solids during theplanet formation process. we calculate the elemental abundances in theresulting planets and explore how these vary with the choice of disk model andthe initial conditions within the solar nebula.  although certain characteristics of the terrestrial planets in the solarsystem could be reproduced, none of our models could reproduce the abundanceproperties of all the planets. we found that the choice of the initialplanetesimal disk mass and of the disk model has a significant effect oncomposition gradients. disk models that give higher pressure and temperatureresult in larger variations in the bulk chemical compositions of the resultingplanets due to inhomogeneities in the element abundance profiles and due to thedifferent source regions of the planets in the dynamical simulations. weobserved a trend that massive planets and planets with relatively smallsemi-major axes are more sensitive to these variations than smaller planets atlarger radial distance. only these large variations in the simulated chemicalabundances can potentially explain the diverse bulk composition of the solarsystem planets, whereas mercury's bulk composition can not be reproduced in ourapproach.

1211.6434	precision cosmology in muddy waters: cosmological constraints and n-body  codes	future large-scale structure surveys of the universe will aim to constrainthe cosmological model and the true nature of dark energy with unprecedentedaccuracy. in order for these surveys to achieve their designed goals, they willrequire predictions for the nonlinear matter power spectrum to sub-percentaccuracy. through the use of a large ensemble of cosmological n-bodysimulations, we demonstrate that if we do not understand the uncertaintiesassociated with simulating structure formation, i.e. knowledge of the `true'simulation parameters, and simply seek to marginalize over them, then theconstraining power of such future surveys can be significantly reduced.however, for the parameters {n_s, h, om_b, om_m}, this effect can be largelymitigated by adding the information from a cmb experiment, like planck. incontrast, for the amplitude of fluctuations sigma8 and the time-evolvingequation of state of dark energy {w_0, w_a}, the mitigation is mild. onmarginalizing over the simulation parameters, we find that the dark-energyfigure of merit can be degraded by ~2. this is likely an optimistic assessment,since we do not take into account other important simulation parameters. acaveat is our assumption that the hessian of the likelihood function does notvary significantly when moving from our adopted to the 'true' simulationparameter set. this paper therefore provides strong motivation for rigorousconvergence testing of n-body codes to meet the future challenges of precisioncosmology.

1301.2670	what's up in the milky way? the orientation of the disc relative to the  triaxial halo	models of the sagittarius stream have consistently found that the milky waydisc is oriented such that its short axis is along the intermediate axis of thetriaxial dark matter halo. we attempt to build models of disc galaxies in suchan `intermediate-axis orientation'. we do this with three models. in the firsttwo cases we simply rigidly grow a disc in a triaxial halo such that the discends up perpendicular to the global intermediate axis. we also attempt to coaxa disc to form in an intermediate-axis orientation by producing a gas+darkmatter triaxial system with gas angular momentum about the intermediate axis.in all cases we fail to produce systems which remain with stellar angularmomentum aligned with the halo's intermediate axis, even when the disc'spotential flattens the inner halo such that the disc is everywhereperpendicular to the halo's local minor axis. for one of these unstablesimulations we show that the potential is even rounder than the models of themilky way potential in the region probed by the sagittarius stream. we concludethat the milky way's disc is very unlikely to be in an intermediate axisorientation. however we find that a disc can persist off one of the principalplanes of the potential. we propose that the disc of the milky way must betilted relative to the principal axes of the dark matter halo. directconfirmation of this prediction would constitute a critical test of modifiednewtonian dynamics.

1307.6002	the biasing of baryons on the cluster mass function and cosmological  parameter estimation	we study the effect of baryonic processes on the halo mass function in thegalaxy cluster mass range using a catalogue of 153 high resolution cosmologicalhydrodynamical simulations performed with the amr code ramses. we use theresults of our simulations within a simple analytical model to gauge theeffects of baryon physics on the halo mass function. neglect of agn feedbackleads to a significant boost in the cluster mass function similar to thatreported by other authors. however, including agn feedback not only gives riseto systems that are similar to observed galaxy clusters, but they also reversethe global baryonic effects on the clusters. the resulting mass function iscloser to the unmodified dark matter halo mass function but still contains amass dependent bias at the 5-10% level. these effects bias measurements of thecosmological parameters, such as $\sigma_8$ and $\omega_m$. for current clustersurveys baryonic effects are within the noise for current survey volumes, butforthcoming and planned large sz, x-ray and multi-wavelength surveys will bebiased at the percent level by these processes. the predictions for the halomass function including baryonic effects need to be carefully studied withlarger and improved simulations. however, simulations of full cosmologicalboxes with the resolution we achieve and including agn feedback are stillcomputationally challenging.

0705.0530	dependence of the local reionization history on halo mass and  environment: did virgo reionize the local group?	the reionization of the universe has profound effects on the way galaxiesform and on their observed properties at later times. of particular importanceis the relative timing of the reionization history of a region and its haloassembly history, which can affect the nature of the first stars formed in thatregion, the properties and radial distribution of its stellar halo, globularcluster population and its satellite galaxies. we distinguish two basic casesfor the reionization of a halo - internal reionization, whereby the starsforming in situ reionize their host galaxy, and external reionization, wherebythe progenitor of a galaxy is reionized by external radiation before its ownstars are able to form in sufficient numbers. we use a set of large-scaleradiative transfer and structure formation simulations, based on cosmologiesderived from both wmap 1-year and wmap 3-year data, to evaluate the meanreionization redshifts and the probability of internal/external reionizationfor local group-like systems, galaxies in the field and central cd galaxies inclusters. we find that these probabilities are strongly dependent on theunderlying cosmology and the efficiency of photon production, but also on thehalo mass. there is a rapid transition between predominantly external andpredominantly internal reionization at a mass scale of 1.0e12 msun(corresponding roughly to l*galaxies), with haloes less massive than this beingreionized preferentially from distant sources. we provide a fit for thereionization redshift as a function of halo mass, which could be helpful toparameterize reionization in semi-analytical models of galaxy formation oncosmological scales. we find no statistical correlation between thereionization history of field galaxies and their environment.

1308.6321	a systematic look at the effects of radiative feedback on disc galaxy  formation	galaxy formation models and simulations rely on various feedback mechanismsto reproduce the observed baryonic scaling relations and galaxy morphologies.although dwarf galaxy and giant elliptical properties can be explained usingfeedback from supernova and active galactic nuclei, milky way-sized galaxiesstill represent a challenge to current theories of galaxy formation. in thispaper, we explore the possible role of feedback from stellar radiation inregulating the main properties of disk galaxies such as our own milky way. wehave performed a suite of cosmological simulations of the same $\sim10^{12}{\rm m}_{\odot}$ halo selected based on its rather typical mass accretionhistory. we have implemented radiative feedback from young stars using a crudemodel of radiative transfer for ultraviolet (uv) and infrared (ir) radiation.however, the model is realistic enough such that the dust opacity plays adirect role in regulating the efficiency of our feedback mechanism. we haveexplored various models for the dust opacity, assuming different constant dusttemperatures, as well as a varying dust temperature model. we find that whilestrong radiative feedback appears as a viable mechanism to regulate the stellarmass fraction in massive galaxies, it also prevents the formation of discs withreasonable morphologies. in models with strong stellar radiation feedback,stellar discs are systematically too thick while the gas disc morphology iscompletely destroyed due to the efficient mixing between the feedback-affectedgas and its surroundings. at the resolution of our simulation suite, we find itimpossible to preserve spiral disc morphology while at the same time expellingenough baryons to satisfy the abundance matching constraints.

1405.0528	brightest cluster galaxies in cosmological simulations with adaptive  mesh refinement: successes and failures	a large sample of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations withadaptive mesh refinement (amr) is analysed to study the properties of simulatedbrightest cluster galaxies (bcgs). following the formation and evolution ofbcgs requires modeling an entire galaxy cluster, because the bcg properties arelargely influenced by the state of the gas in the cluster and by interactionsand mergers with satellites. bcg evolution is also deeply influenced by thepresence of gas heating sources such as active galactic nuclei (agns) thatprevent catastrophic cooling of large amounts of gas. we show that agn feedbackis one of the most important mechanisms in shaping the properties of bcgs atlow redshift by analysing our statistical sample of simulations with andwithout agn feedback. when agn feedback is included bcg masses, sizes, starformation rates and kinematic properties are closer to those of the observedsystems. some small discrepancies are observed only for the most massive bcgsand in the fraction of star-forming bcgs, effects that might be due to physicalprocesses that are not included in our model.

1410.1541	the same with less: the cosmic web of warm versus cold dark matter dwarf  galaxies	we explore fundamental properties of the distribution of low mass dark matterhalos within the cosmic web using warm dark matter (wdm) and cold dark matter(cdm) cosmological simulations. using self abundance-matched mock galaxycatalogs, we show that the distribution of dwarf galaxies in a wdm universe,wherein low mass halo formation is heavily suppressed, is nearlyindistinguishable to that of a cdm universe whose low mass halos are not seenbecause galaxy formation is suppressed below some threshold halo mass. however,if the scatter between dwarf galaxy luminosity and halo properties is largeenough, low mass cdm halos would sometimes host relatively bright galaxiesthereby populating cdm voids with the occasional isolated galaxy and reducingthe numbers of completely empty voids. otherwise, without high mass to lightscatter, all mock galaxy clustering statistics that we consider--theauto-correlation function, the numbers and radial profiles of satellites, thenumbers of isolated galaxies, and the pdf of small voids--are nearly identicalin cdm and wdm. wdm voids are neither larger nor emptier than cdm voids, whenconstructed from abundance-matched halo catalogs. it is thus a challenge todetermine whether the cdm problem of the over-abundance of small halos withrespect to the number density of observed dwarf galaxies has a cosmologicalsolution or an astrophysical solution. however, some clues about the darkmatter particle and the scatter between the properties of dwarf galaxies andtheir dark matter halo hosts might be found in the cosmic web of galaxies infuture surveys of the local volume.

1502.03429	internal alignments of red versus blue discs in dark matter halos	large surveys have shown that red galaxies are preferentially aligned withtheir halos while blue galaxies have a more isotropic distribution. since halosgenerally align with their filaments this introduces a bias in the measurementof the cosmic shear from weak lensing. it is therefore vitally important tounderstand why this difference arises. we explore the stability of differentdisc orientations within triaxial halos. we show that, in the absence of gas,the disc orientation is most stable when its spin is along the minor axis ofthe halo. instead when gas cools onto a disc it is able to form in almostarbitrary orientation, including off the main planes of the halo (but avoidingan orientation perpendicular to the halo's intermediate axis). substructurehelps gasless galaxies reach alignment with the halo faster, but have lesseffect on galaxies when gas is cooling onto the disc. our results provide anovel and natural interpretation for why red, gas poor galaxies arepreferentially aligned with their halo, while blue, star-forming, galaxies havenearly random orientations, without requiring a connection between galaxies'current star formation rate and their merger history.

1508.00917	chaos in terrestrial planet formation	terrestrial planets are thought to be the result of a vast number ofgravitational interactions and collisions between smaller bodies. we usenumerical simulations to show that practically identical initial conditionsresult in a wide array of final planetary configurations. this highly chaoticbehaviour questions the predictability of different scenarios for the formationand evolution of our solar system and planetary systems in general. however,multiple realisations of the same initial conditions can be used to predictcertain global statistics. we present two sets of numerical experiments thatquantify this behaviour. firstly, we demonstrate that simulations with slightlydisplaced particles are completely divergent after ~500 years, irrespective ofinitial displacement, particle number, and code accuracy. if a singleplanetesimal is moved by less than one millimetre, then a different set ofplanets results -- this timescale for chaotic divergence decreases withincreasing particle number. secondly, we show final planetary configurations ofinitially similar simulations with and without giant planets after evolvingthem for ~148 myr. we find that the same simulations including giant planetstend to generate higher mass planets at lower semi-major axes than simulationswithout gas giants. this prediction can be tested with forthcomingobservational programs. by extracting outliers in the observations, wecautiously predict that kepler-10, kepler-9, 61 vir, hd 134060, and hd 51608may host as yet undetected giant planets.

0806.1689	formation and accretion history of terrestrial planets from runaway  growth through to late time: implications for orbital eccentricity	remnant planetesimals might have played an important role in reducing theorbital eccentricities of the terrestrial planets after their formation viagiant impacts. however, the population and the size distribution of remnantplanetesimals during and after the giant impact stage are unknown, becausesimulations of planetary accretion in the runaway growth and giant impactstages have been conducted independently. here we report results of directn-body simulations of the formation of terrestrial planets beginning with acompact planetesimal disk. the initial planetesimal disk has a total mass andangular momentum as observed for the terrestrial planets, and we vary the width(0.3 and 0.5au) and the number of planetesimals (1000-5000). this initialconfiguration generally gives rise to three final planets of similar size, andsometimes a fourth small planet forms near the location of mars. since asufficient number of planetesimals remains, even after the giant impact phase,the final orbital eccentricities are as small as those of the earth and venus.

0806.1951	core creation in galaxies and haloes via sinking massive objects	we perform a detailed investigation into the disruption of central cusps viathe transfer of energy from sinking massive objects. constant density innerregions form at the radius where the enclosed mass approximately matches themass of the infalling body. we explore parameter space using numericalsimulations and give an empirical relation for the size of the resulting corewithin structures that have different initial cusp slopes. we find thatinfalling bodies always stall at the edge of these newly formed cores,experiencing no dynamical friction over many dynamical times. as applications,we consider the resulting decrease in the dark matter annihilation flux due tocentrally destroyed cusps, and we present a new theory for the formation ofclose binary nuclei -- the `stalled binary' model. we focus on one particularlyinteresting binary nucleus system, the dwarf spheroidal galaxy vcc 128 which isdark matter dominated at all radii. we show that its nuclei would rapidlycoalesce within a few million years if it has a central dark matter cusp slopesteeper than r^{-1}. however, if its initial dark matter cusp is slightlyshallower than a log slope of -0.75 at ~0.1% of the virial radius, then thesinking nuclei naturally create a core equal to their observed separation andstall. this is close to the log slope measured a recent billion particle cdmhalo simulation.

astro-ph;0002308	collisional versus collisionless dark matter	we compare the structure and substructure of dark matter halos in modeluniverses dominated by collisional, strongly self interacting dark matter(sidm) and collisionless, weakly interacting dark matter (cdm). while sidmvirialised halos are more nearly spherical than cdm halos, they can berotationally flattened by as much as 20% in their inner regions. substructurehalos suffer ram-pressure truncation and drag which are more rapid and severethan their gravitational counterparts tidal stripping and dynamical friction.lensing constraints on the size of galactic halos in clusters are a factor oftwo smaller than predicted by gravitational stripping, and the recent detectionof tidal streams of stars escaping from the satellite galaxy carina suggeststhat its tidal radius is close to its optical radius of a few hundred parsecs--- an order of magnitude smaller than predicted by cdm models but consistentwith sidm. the orbits of sidm satellites suffer significant velocity bias$\sigma_{sidm}/\sigma_{cdm}=0.85$ and are more circular than cdm,$\beta_{sidm}} \approx 0.5$, in agreement with the inferred orbits of thegalaxy's satellites. in the limit of a short mean free path, sidm halos havesingular isothermal density profiles, thus in its simplest incarnation sidm isinconsistent with galactic rotation curves.

astro-ph;0009230	do clusters contain a large population of dwarf galaxies?	we analyze systematic effects in the determination of the galaxy luminosityfunction in clusters using a deep mock catalogue constructed from a numericalsimulation of a hierarchical universe. the results indicate a strong tendencyto derive a rising faint end ($\alpha \lsim -1.5$) in clusters selected in twodimensions, using a galaxy catalogue constructed with a universal flatluminosity function with $\alpha \simeq -1.0$. this is due to the projectioneffects inherent in catalogues of clusters constructed using 2 dimensionaldata. many of the clusters found in 2d have no significant 3d counterparts, andmost suffer from massive background contamination that cannot be corrected forby subtracting random offset fields. the luminosity function of high surfacebrightness galaxies in the field and within small groups follows a schechterfunction with a fairly flat faint end slope, $n(l)\propto l^{\alpha}$ with$\alpha = -0.9$ to -1.2. on the contrary, observational studies of clustersconstructed using abell, edcc and apm catalogues are systematically found tohave steeper luminosity functions with $\alpha = -1.4$ to -2.0. this may beattributed to projection effects rather than a dominant population of highsurface brightness dwarf galaxies ($m\gsim m^*+2$) in clusters. it should bestraighforward to confirm our results by measuring redshifts of these faintcluster galaxies.

astro-ph;0011041	tidal stirring and the origin of dwarf spheroidals in the local group	n-body/sph simulations are used to study the evolution of dwarf irregulargalaxies (dirrs) entering the dark matter halo of the milky way or m31 onplunging orbits. we propose a new dynamical mechanism driving the evolution ofgas rich, rotationally supported dirrs, mostly found at the outskirts of thelocal group (lg), into gas free, pressure supported dwarf spheroidals (dsphs)or dwarf ellipticals (des), observed to cluster around the two giant spirals.the initial model galaxies are exponential disks embedded in massive darkmatter halos and reproduce nearby dirrs. repeated tidal shocks at thepericenter of their orbit partially strip their halo and disk and triggerdynamical instabilities that dramatically reshape their stellar component.after only 2-3 orbits low surface brightness (lsb) dirrs are transformed intodsphs, while high surface brightness (hsb) dirrs evolve into des. thisevolutionary mechanism naturally leads to the morphology-density relationobserved for lg dwarfs. dwarfs surrounded by very dense dark matter halos, likethe archetypical dirr gr8, are turned into draco or ursa minor, the faintestand most dark matter dominated among lg dsphs. if disks include a gaseouscomponent, this is both tidally stripped and consumed in periodic bursts ofstar formation. the resulting star formation histories are in good qualitativeagreement with those derived using hst color-magnitude diagrams for localdsphs.

astro-ph;0106271	dark matter in draco and the local group: implications for direct  detection experiments	we use a cosmological simulation of the local group to make quantitative andspeculative predictions for direct detection experiments. cold dark matter(cdm) halos form via a complex series of mergers, accretion events and violentrelaxation which precludes the formation of significant caustic featurespredicted by axially symmetric collapse. the halo density profiles are combinedwith observational constraints on the galactic mass distribution to constrainthe local density of cold dark matter to lie in the range 0.18 &lt;~rho_cdm(r_solar)/gev cm^-3 &lt;~ 0.30. in velocity space, coherent streams of darkmatter from tidally disrupted halos fill the halo and provide a tracer of themerging hierarchy. the particle velocities within triaxial cdm halos cannot beapproximated by a simple maxwellian distribution and is radially biased at thesolar position. the detailed phase space structure within the solar system willdepend on the early merger history of the progenitor halos and the importanceof major mergers over accretion dominated growth. we follow the formation of a``draco'' sized dsph halo of mass 10^8m_solar with several million particlesand high force accuracy. its internal structure and substructure resembles thatof galactic or cluster mass halos: the density profile has a singular centralcusp and it contains thousands of sub-halos orbiting within its virial radiusdemonstrating a self-similar nature to collisionless dark mattersub-clustering. the singular cores of substructure halos always survivecomplete tidal disruption although mass loss is continuous and rapid.extrapolating wildly to earth mass halos with velocity dispersion of 1 m s^-1(roughly equal to the free streaming scale for neutralinos) we find that mostof the dark matter may remain attached to bound subhalos.

astro-ph;0110386	tidal debris of dwarf spheroidals as a probe of structure formation  models	recent observations suggest that carina and other nearby dwarf spheroidalgalaxies are surrounded by unbound stars tidally stripped by the milky way. werun high-resolution n-body simulations of dwarf galaxies orbiting within themilky way halo to determine if such observations can be explained with darkmatter potentials as those implied by current structure formation models. weshow that tidal forces acting on dwarfs with constant density cores or withcuspy profiles having a low concentration parameter ($c &lt; 5$) lead to flatouter stellar density profiles like that of carina for a variety of orbitalconfigurations. on the contrary, it is more difficult to remove stars fromcuspy dark matter halos with concentrations as high as predicted by cdm modelsat the mass scale of dwarf galaxies ($c \simgt 10$) and the data can only bereproduced assuming nearly radial orbits. our simulations show that carina islosing mass at a fractional rate $&lt; 0.1$ gyr$^{-1}$ and its mass-to-light ratiocould be inflated by at most a factor of 2 due to unbound stars projected alongthe line of sight. we follow the evolution of the tidal debris within atriaxial clumpy cold dark matter milky way halo which causes differentialprecession and small scale heating of the stellar streams. this renders theiruse as a dynamical tracer of the galactic potential practically useless, butdoes provide a novel test of the nature of the dark matter. models with warmdark matter (wdm) or fluid dark matter (fdm) produce dwarf halos with lowercentral densities than cdm and would be consistent with the observed tidaltails even for orbits with eccentricities as low as indicated by current dataon nearby dwarf spheroidals. galactic halos in fdm are smooth and spherical andwould be favored by the detection of coherent streams.

astro-ph;0304549	two body relaxation in cdm simulations	n-body simulations of the hierarchical formation of cosmic structures sufferfrom the problem that the first objects to form always contain just a fewparticles. although relaxation is not an issue for virialised objectscontaining millions of particles, collisional processes will always dominatewithin the first structures that collapse. first we quantify how the relaxationvaries with resolution, softening, and radius within isolated equilibrium andnon-equilibrium cuspy haloes. we then attempt to determine how this numericaleffect propagates through a merging hierarchy by measuring the local relaxationrates of each particle throughout the hierarchical formation of a dark matterhalo. the central few percent of the final structures - a region which onemight naively think is well resolved at the final time since the haloescontains about 10^6 particles - suffer from high degrees of relaxation. it isnot clear how to interpret the effects of the accumulated relaxation rate, butwe argue that it describes a region within which one should be careful abouttrusting the numerical results. substructure haloes are most affected byrelaxation since they contain few particles at a constant energy for the entiresimulation. we show that relaxation will flatten a cusp in just a few meanrelaxation times of a halo. we explore the effect of resolution on the degreeof relaxation and we find that increasing n slowly reduces the degree ofrelaxation proportional to n^{-0.25} rather than proportional to n. simulatedwith the same relative mass resolution (i.e. equal numbers of particles)cluster mass objects suffer significantly more relaxation than galaxy massobjects since they form relatively late and therefore more of the particlesspend more time in small n haloes.

astro-ph;0309500	the baryonic mass-velocity relation; clues to feedback processes during  structure formation and the cosmic baryon inventory	we show that a global relation between baryonic mass and virial velocity canbe constructed from the scale of dwarf galaxies up to that of rich galaxyclusters. the slope of this relation is close to that expected if dark matterhalos form in the standard hierarchical cosmogony and capture a universalbaryon fraction, once the details of halo structure and the adiabaticcontraction of halos due to cooling gas are taken into account. the scatter anddeficiency of baryons within low mass halos ($v_{vir} &lt; 50$ km/s) is consistentwith the expected suppression of gas accretion by photo-evaporation due to thecosmic uv background at high redshift. the data are not consistent withsignificant gas removal from strong supernovae winds unless the velocities ofgalaxies measured from their gas kinematics are significantly lower than thetrue halo velocities for objects with $v_{vir} &lt; 100$ km/s. thus models such as$\lambda$cdm with a steep mass function of halos may find it difficult toreproduce both the baryonic mass-velocity relation presented here whilst at thesame time reproducing the flat luminosity/hi function of galaxies. galaxieshold about 10% of the baryons in the universe, which is close to the collapsedmass fraction expected within hierarchical models on these scales, suggesting ahigh efficiency for galaxy formation. most of the baryons are expected to beevenly distributed between diffuse intergalactic gas in low densityenvironments and the intra-galactic medium within galaxy groups.

astro-ph;0309517	generating equilibrium dark matter halos: inadequacies of the local  maxwellian approximation	we describe an algorithm for constructing n-body realizations of equilibriumspherical systems. a general form for the mass density rho(r) is used, makingit possible to represent most of the popular density profiles found in theliterature, including the cuspy density profiles found in high-resolutioncosmological simulations. we demonstrate explicitly that our models are inequilibrium. in contrast, many existing n-body realizations of isolated systemshave been constructed under the assumption that the local velocity distributionis maxwellian. we show that a maxwellian halo with an initial r^{-1} centraldensity cusp immediately develops a constant-density core. moreover, after justone crossing time the orbital anisotropy has changed over the entire system,and the initially isotropic model becomes radially anisotropic. these effectshave important implications for many studies, including the survival ofsubstructure in cold dark matter (cdm) models. comparing the evolution andmass-loss rate of isotropic maxwellian and self-consistent navarro, frenk, &amp;white (nfw) satellites orbiting inside a static host cdm potential, we findthat the former are unrealistically susceptible to tidal disruption. thus,recent studies of the mass-loss rate and disruption timescales of substructurein cdm models may be compromized by using the maxwellian approximation. we alsodemonstrate that a radially anisotropic, self-consistent nfw satellite losesmass at a rate several times higher than that of its isotropic counterpart onthe same external tidal field and orbit.

astro-ph;0402160	velocity and spatial biases in cdm subhalo distributions	we present a statistical study of substructure within a sample of lcdmclusters and galaxies simulated with up to 25 million particles. with thousandsof subhalos per object we can accurately measure their spatial clustering andvelocity distribution functions and compare these with observational data. thesubstructure properties of galactic halos closely resembles those of galaxyclusters with a small scatter in the mass and circular velocity functions. thevelocity distribution function is non-maxwellian and flat topped with anegative kurtosis of about -0.7. within the virial radius the velocity bias$b=\sigma_{\rm sub}/\sigma_{\rm dm}\sim 1.12 \pm 0.04$, increasing to b &gt; 1.3within the halo centers. slow subhalos are much less common, due to physicaldisruption by gravitational tides early in the merging history. this leads to aspatially anti-biased subhalo distribution that is well fitted by a coredisothermal. observations of cluster galaxies do not show such biases which weinterpret as a limitation of pure dark matter simulations - we estimate that weare missing half of the halo population which has been destroyed by physicalovermerging. high resolution hydrodynamical simulations are required to studythese issues further. if cdm is correct then the cluster galaxies must survivethe tidal field, perhaps due to baryonic inflow during elliptical galaxyformation. spirals can never exist near the cluster centers and the ellipticalgalaxies there will have little remaining dark matter. this implies that themorphology-density relation is set {\it before} the cluster forms, rather thana subsequent transformation of disks to s0's by virtue of the clusterenvironment.

astro-ph;0405189	the effect of gas cooling on the shapes of dark matter halos	we analyze the effect of dissipation on the shapes of dark matter (dm) halosusing high-resolution cosmological gasdynamics simulations of clusters andgalaxies in the lcdm cosmology. we find that halos formed in simulations withgas cooling are significantly more spherical than corresponding halos formed inadiabatic simulations. gas cooling results in an average increase of theprinciple axis ratios of halos by ~ 0.2-0.4 in the inner regions. thesystematic difference decreases slowly with radius but persists almost to thevirial radius. we argue that the differences in simulations with and withoutcooling arise both during periods of quiescent evolution, when gas cools andcondenses toward the center, and during major mergers. we perform a series ofhigh-resolution n-body simulations to study the shapes of remnants in majormergers of dm halos and halos with embedded stellar disks. in the dm halo-onlymergers, the shape of the remnants depends only on the orbital angular momentumof the encounter and not on the internal structure of the halos. however,significant shape changes in the dm distribution may result if stellar disksare included. in this case the shape of the dm halos is correlated with themorphology of the stellar remnants.

astro-ph;0407407	fate of supermassive black holes and evolution of the m(bh)-sigma  relation in merging galaxies: the effect of gaseous dissipation	we analyze the effect of dissipation on the orbital evolution of supermassiveblack holes (smbhs) using high-resolution self-consistent gasdynamicalsimulations of binary equal- and unequal-mass mergers of disk galaxies. thegalaxy models are consistent with the lcdm paradigm of structure formation andthe simulations include the effects of radiative cooling and star formation. wefind that equal-mass mergers always lead to the formation of a close smbh pairat the center of the remnant with separations limited solely by the adoptedforce resolution of ~ 100 pc. instead, the final smbh separation inunequal-mass mergers depends sensitively on how the central structure of themerging galaxies is modified by dissipation. in the absence of dissipation, thesatellite galaxy can be entirely disrupted before the merger is completedleaving its smbh wandering at a distance too far from the center of the remnantfor the formation of a close pair. in contrast, we show that gas coolingfacilitates the pairing process by increasing the resilience of the companiongalaxy to tidal disruption. moreover, we demonstrate that merging disk galaxiesconstructed to obey the m(bh)-sigma relation, move relative to it depending onwhether they undergo a dissipational or collisionless merger, regardless of themass ratio of the merging systems. collisionless simulations reveal thatremnants tend to move away from the mean relation highlighting the role ofgas-poor mergers as a possible source of scatter.  in dissipational mergers, the interplay between strong gas inflows associatedwith the formation of massive nuclear disks and the consumption of gas by starformation provides the necessary fuel to the smbhs and allows the mergerremnants to satisfy the relation.

astro-ph;0412312	the gravitational and hydrodynamical interaction between the lmc and the  galaxy	we use high resolution n-body/sph simulations to study the hydrodynamical andgravitational interaction between the large magellanic cloud and the milky way.we model the dark and hot extended halo components as well as thestellar/gaseous disks of the two galaxies. both galaxies are embedded inextended cuspy lcdm dark matter halos. we follow the previous four gyrs of thelmc's orbit such that it ends up with the correct location and orientation onthe sky. tidal forces elongate the lmc's disk, forcing a bar and creating astrong warp and diffuse stellar halo, although very few stars become unbound.the stellar halo may account for some of the microlensing events. ram-pressurefrom a low density ionised halo is then sufficient to remove 1.4e8 msolar ofgas from the lmc's disk forming a great circle trailing stream around thegalaxy. the column density of stripped gas falls by two orders of magnitude 100degrees from lmc. the lmc does not induce any response in the milky way disk.on the contrary, the tides raised by the milky way determine the truncation ofthe satellite at about 11 kpc. after several gyrs of interaction the gas diskof the lmc is smaller than the stellar disk due to ram pressure and its sizecompares well with the observational data.

astro-ph;0501273	tidal streams in a mond potential: constraints from sagittarius	we compare orbits in a thin axisymmetric disc potential in mond to those in athin disc plus near-spherical dark matter halo predicted by a $\lambda$cdmcosmology. remarkably, the amount of orbital precession in mond is nearlyidentical to that which occurs in a mildly oblate cdm galactic halo (potentialflattening q=0.9), consistent with recent constraints from the sagittariusstream. since very flattened mass distributions in mond produce rounderpotentials than in standard newtonian mechanics, we show that it will be verydifficult to use the tidal debris from streams to distinguish between a mondgalaxy and a standard cdm galaxy with a mildly oblate halo.  if a galaxy can be found with either a prolate halo, or one which is moreoblate than $q \sim 0.9$ this would rule out mond as a viable theory. improveddata from the leading arm of the sagittarius dwarf - which samples the galacticpotential at large radii - could rule out mond if the orbital pole precessioncan be determined to an accuracy of the order of $\pm 1^o$.

astro-ph;0502213	on the survival and disruption of earth mass cdm micro-haloes	neutralino dark matter leads to the formation of numerous earth mass darkmatter haloes at redshifts z\approx 60 (diemand et al. 2005). these abundantcdm micro-haloes have cuspy density profiles that can easily withstand thegalactic tidal field at the solar radius. zhao, taylor, silk &amp; hooper(astro-ph/0502049) concluded that ``...the majority of dark mattersubstructures with masses \sim 10^{-6}m_o will be tidally disrupted due tointeractions with stars in the galactic halo''. however these authors assumed ahalo density of stars that is at least an order of magnitude higher thanobserved. we show that the appropriate application of the impulse approximationis to the regime of multiple encounters, not single disruptive events asadopted by zhao et al., which leads to a survival time of several hubble times.therefore we do not expect the tidal heating by galactic stars to affect theabundance of micro-haloes. disk crossing will cause some mass loss but thecentral cores are likely to survive and could be detected as gamma-ray sourceswith proper motions of several arc minutes per year.

astro-ph;0504277	simultaneous ram pressure and tidal stripping; how dwarf spheroidals  lost their gas	we perform high-resolution n-body+sph simulations of gas-rich dwarf galaxysatellites orbiting within a milky way-sized halo and study for the first timethe combined effects of tides and ram pressure. the structure of the galaxymodels and the orbital configurations are chosen in accordance to thoseexpected in a lcdm universe.while tidal stirring of disky dwarfs producesobjects whose stellar structure and kinematics resembles that of dwarfspheroidals after a few orbits, ram pressure stripping is needed to entirelyremove their gas component. gravitational tides can aid ram pressure strippingby diminishing the overall potential of the dwarf, but tides also induce barformation which funnels gas inwards making subsequent stripping more difficult.this inflow is particularly effective when the gas can cool radiatively.assuming a low density of the hot galactic corona consistent with observationalconstraints, dwarfs with v_{peak} &lt; 30 km/s can be completely stripped of theirgas content on orbits with pericenters of 50 kpc or less. instead, dwarfs withmore massive dark haloes and v_{peak} &gt; 30 km/s lose most or all of their gascontent only if a heating source keeps the gas extended, partiallycounteracting the bar-driven inflow. we show that the ionizing radiation fromthe cosmic uv background at z &gt; 2 can provide the required heating. in theseobjects most of the gas is removed or becomes ionized at the first pericenterpassage,explaining the early truncation of the star formation observed in dracoand ursa minor. the stripped gas breaks up into individual clouds pressureconfined by the outer gaseous medium that have masses, sizes and densitiescomparable to the hi clouds recently discovered around m31.(abridged)

astro-ph;0504530	the kinematic signature of face-on peanut-shaped bulges	we present a kinematic diagnostic for peanut-shaped bulges in nearly face-ongalaxies. the face-on view provides a novel perspective on peanuts which wouldallow study of their relation to bars and disks in greater detail than hithertopossible. the diagnostic is based on the fact that peanut shapes are associatedwith a flat density distribution in the vertical direction. we show that thekinematic signature corresponding to such a distribution is a minimum in thefourth-order gauss-hermite moment $s_4$. we demonstrate our method on $n$-bodysimulations of varying peanut strength, showing that strong peanuts can berecognized to inclinations $i \simeq 30\degrees$, regardless of the strength ofthe bar. we also consider compound systems in which a bulge is present in theinitial conditions as may happen if bulges form at high redshift throughmergers. we show that in this case, because the vertical structure of the bulgeis not derived from that of the disk, that the signature of a peanut in $s_4$is weakened. thus the same kinematic signature of peanuts can be used toexplore bulge formation mechanisms. the observational requirements foridentifying peanuts with this method are challenging, but feasible.

astro-ph;0506125	radial distribution and strong lensing statistics of satellite galaxies  and substructure using high resolution lcdm hydrodynamical simulations	we analyse the number density and radial distribution of substructures andsatellite galaxies using cosmological simulations that follow the gas dynamicsof a baryonic component, including shock heating, radiative cooling and starformation within the hierarchical concordance lcdm model. we find that thedissipation of the baryons greatly enhances the survival of subhaloes,expecially in the galaxy core, resulting in a radial distribution of satellitegalaxies that closely follows the overall mass distribution in the inner partof the halo. hydrodynamical simulations are necessary to resolve the adiabaticcontraction and dense cores of galaxies, resulting in a total number ofsatellites a factor of two larger than found in pure dark matter simulation, ingood agreement with the observed spatial distribution of satellite galaxieswithin galaxies and clusters. convergence tests show that the coreddistribution found by previous authors in pure n-body simulations was due tophysical overmerging of dark matter only structures.  we proceed to use a ray-shooting technique in order to study the impact ofthese additional substructures on the number of violations of the cusp causticmagnification relation. we develop a new approach to try to disentangle theeffect of substructures from the intrinsic discreteness of n-body simulations.even with the increased number of substructures in the centres of galaxies, weare not able to reproduce the observed high numbers of discrepancies observedin the flux ratios of multiply lensed quasars.

astro-ph;0506615	the distribution and kinematics of early high-sigma peaks in present-day  haloes: implications for rare objects and old stellar populations	we show that the hierarchical assembly of cold dark matter (cdm) haloespreserves the memory of the initial conditions. using n-body cosmologicalsimulations, we demonstrate that the present-day spatial distribution andkinematics of objects that formed within early (z &gt; 10) protogalactic systems(old stars, satellite galaxies, globular clusters, massive black holes, etc.)depends mostly on the rarity of the peak of the primordial density field whichthey originally belonged to. only for objects forming at lower redshifts theexact formation site within the progenitor halo (e.g. whether near the centeror in an extended disk) becomes important. in present-day haloes, material fromthe rarer early peaks is more centrally concentrated and falls off more steeplywith radius compared to the overall mass distribution, it has a lower velocitydispersion, moves on more radial orbits, and has a more elongated shape.population ii stars that formed within protogalactic haloes collapsing from&gt;2.5 sigma fluctuations would follow today a r^{-3.5} density profile with ahalf-light radius of 17 kpc and a velocity anisotropy that increases fromisotropic in the inner regions to nearly radial at the halo edge. this agreeswell with the radial velocity dispersion profile of galaxy halo stars frombattaglia et al.

astro-ph;0509310	the secular evolution of disk structural parameters	we present a comprehensive series of $n$-body as well as $n$-body + sphsimulations to study the secular evolution of the structure of disk galaxies.our simulations are organized in a hierarchy of increasing complexity, rangingfrom rigid-halo collisionless simulations to fully live simulations with gasand star formation. comparisons between the different types of simulationsallow us to isolate the role of various physical mechanisms. we focus on theevolution of systems expected in a lcdm universe.  our goal is to examine which structural properties of disk galaxies mayresult from secular evolution rather than from direct hierarchical assembly. inthe vertical direction, we find that various mechanisms can lead to heating.the strongest heating occurs during the vertical buckling instability of a bar.among the consequences of this instability is the formation of peanut-shapedbulges which produce clear kinematic signatures when observed face-on. we findthat bars are robust structures that are not destroyed by buckling. they can bedestroyed instead by a central mass concentration but we find that this massneeds to be a large fraction of the total mass of the disk. we then study theevolution of stellar surface density profiles showing how angular momentumredistribution leads to increasing central densities and disk scale lengths andto profile breaks at large radii. the breaks in these simulations are inexcellent agreement with observed breaks, even when the evolution is purelycollisionless. disk scale-lengths increase even when the total disk angularmomentum is conserved; thus mapping halo angular momenta to scale-lengths isnon-trivial.

astro-ph;0509417	empirical models for dark matter halos. i. nonparametric construction of  density profiles and comparison with parametric models	we use techniques from nonparametric function estimation theory to extractthe density profiles, and their derivatives, from a set of n-body dark matterhalos. we consider halos generated from lcdm simulations of gravitationalclustering, as well as isolated, spherical collapses. the logarithmic densityslopes gamma = d(log rho)/d(log r) of the lcdm halos are found to vary aspower-laws in radius, reaching values of gamma ~ -1 at the innermost resolvedradii (~0.01 r_virial). this behavior is significantly different from that ofbroken power-law models like the nfw profile, but similar to that of modelslike de vaucouleurs'. accordingly, we compare the n-body density profiles withvarious parametric models to find which provide the best fit. we consider annfw-like model with arbitrary inner slope; dehnen &amp; mclaughlin's anisotropicmodel; einasto's model (identical in functional form to sersic's model but fitto the space density); and the density model of prugniel &amp; simien that wasdesigned to match the deprojected form of sersic's r^{1/n} law. overall, thebest-fitting model to the lcdm halos is einasto's, although the prugniel-simienand dehnen-mclaughlin models also perform well. with regard to the sphericalcollapse halos, both the prugniel-simien and einasto models describe thedensity profiles well, with an rms scatter some four times smaller than thatobtained with either the nfw-like model or the 3-parameter dehnen-mclaughlinmodel. finally, we confirm recent claims of a systematic variation in profileshape with halo mass.

astro-ph;0510370	globular clusters, satellite galaxies and stellar haloes from early dark  matter peaks	the milky way contains several distinct old stellar components that provide afossil record of its formation. we can understand their spatial distributionand kinematics in a hierarchical formation scenario by associating theproto-galactic fragments envisaged by searle and zinn (1978) with the rarepeaks able to cool gas in the cold dark matter density field collapsing atredshift z&gt;10. we use hierarchical structure formation simulations to explorethe kinematics and spatial distribution of these early star-forming structuresin galaxy haloes today. most of the proto-galaxies rapidly merge, their stellarcontents and dark matter becoming smoothly distributed and forming the innergalactic halo. the metal-poor globular clusters and old halo stars becometracers of this early evolutionary phase, centrally biased and naturallyreproducing the observed steep fall off with radius. the most outlying peaksfall in late and survive to the present day as satellite galaxies. the observedradial velocity dispersion profile and the local radial velocity anisotropy ofmilky way halo stars are successfully reproduced in this model. if this epochof structure formation coincides with a suppression of further cooling intolower sigma peaks then we can reproduce the rarity, kinematics and spatialdistribution of satellite galaxies as suggested by bullock et al. (2000).reionisation at z=12+/-2 provides a natural solution to the missing satellitesproblem. measuring the distribution of globular clusters and halo light onscales from galaxies to clusters could be used to constrain global versus localreionisation models. if reionisation occurs contemporary, our model predicts aconstant frequency of blue globulars relative to the host halo mass, except fordwarf galaxies where the average relative frequencies become smaller.

astro-ph;0601115	angular momentum transport and disk morphology in sph simulations of  galaxy formation	we perform controlled n-body/sph simulations of disk galaxy formation bycooling a rotating gaseous mass distribution inside equilibrium cuspy sphericaland triaxial dark matter halos. we systematically study the angular momentumtransport and the disk morphology as we increase the number of dark matter andgas particles from 10^4 to 10^6, and decrease the gravitational softening from2 kpc to 50 parsecs. the angular momentum transport, disk morphology and radialprofiles depend sensitively on force and mass resolution. at low resolution,similar to that used in most current cosmological simulations, the cold gascomponent has lost half of its initial angular momentum via differentmechanisms. the angular momentum is transferred primarily to the hot halocomponent, by resolution-dependent hydrodynamical and gravitational torques,the latter arising from asymmetries in the mass distribution. in addition,disk-particles can lose angular momentum while they are still in the hot phaseby artificial viscosity. in the central disk, particles can transfer away over99% of their initial angular momentum due to spiral structure and/or thepresence of a central bar. the strength of this transport also depends on forceand mass resolution - large softening will suppress the bar instability, lowmass resolution enhances the spiral structure. this complex interplay betweenresolution and angular momentum transfer highlights the complexity ofsimulations of galaxy formation even in isolated haloes. with 10^6 gas and darkmatter particles, disk particles lose only 10-20% of their original angularmomentum, yet we are unable to produce pure exponential profiles.

astro-ph;0606458	properties of galaxy groups in the sdss: ii.- agn feedback and star  formation truncation	successfully reproducing the galaxy luminosity function and the bimodality inthe galaxy distribution requires a mechanism that can truncate star formationin massive haloes. current models of galaxy formation consider two suchtruncation mechanisms: strangulation, which acts on satellite galaxies, and agnfeedback, which predominantly affects central galaxies. the efficiencies ofthese processes set the blue fraction of galaxies as function of galaxyluminosity and halo mass. in this paper we use a galaxy group catalogueextracted from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) to determine thesefractions. to demonstrate the potential power of this data as a benchmark forgalaxy formation models, we compare the results to the semi-analytical modelfor galaxy formation of croton et al. (2006). although this model accuratelyfits the global statistics of the galaxy population, as well as the shape ofthe conditional luminosity function, there are significant discrepancies whenthe blue fraction of galaxies as a function of mass and luminosity is comparedbetween the observations and the model. in particular, the model predicts (i)too many faint satellite galaxies in massive haloes, (ii) a blue fraction ofsatellites that is much too low, and (iii) a blue fraction of centrals that istoo high and with an inverted luminosity dependence. in the same order, weargue that these discrepancies owe to (i) the neglect of tidal stripping in thesemi-analytical model, (ii) the oversimplified treatment of strangulation, and(iii) improper modeling of dust extinction and/or agn feedback. the datapresented here will prove useful to test and calibrate future models of galaxyformation and in particular to discriminate between various models for agnfeedback and other star formation truncation mechanisms.

astro-ph;0606589	an optimum time-stepping scheme for n-body simulations	we present a new time-stepping criterion for n-body simulations that is basedon the true dynamical time of a particle. this allows us to follow the orbitsof particles correctly in all environments since it has better adaptivity thanprevious time-stepping criteria used in n-body simulations. furthermore, itrequires far fewer force evaluations in low density regions of the simulationand has no dependence on artificial parameters such as, for example, thesoftening length. this can be orders of magnitude faster than conventionalad-hoc methods that employ combinations of acceleration and softening and isideally suited for hard problems, such as obtaining the correct dynamics in thevery central regions of dark matter haloes. we also derive an eccentricitycorrection for a general leapfrog integration scheme that can followgravitational scattering events for orbits with eccentricity e -&gt; 1 with highprecision. these new approaches allow us to study a range of problems incollisionless and collisional dynamics from few body problems to cosmologicalstructure formation. we present tests of the time-stepping scheme in n-bodysimulations of 2-body orbits with eccentricity e -&gt; 1 (elliptic andhyperbolic), equilibrium haloes and a hierarchical cosmological structureformation run.

astro-ph;0608157	concentration, spin and shape of dark matter haloes: scatter and the  dependence on mass and environment	we use a series of cosmological n-body simulations for a flat lcdm cosmologyto investigate the properties of dark matter haloes in the mass range3.0e9-3.0e13 msun. these properties include the concentration parameter (c),the spin parameter (lambda) and the mean axis ratio (q). for theconcentration-mass relation we find c~m^(-0.11) in agreement with the modelproposed by bullock et al. even if we find a lower normalization (15%). theresults for lambda and q are in good agreement with previous studies, while cand lambda are anti-correlated. in an attempt to remove unrelaxed haloes, weuse the offset parameter (xoff), defined as the distance between the most boundparticle and the center of mass. removing haloes with large xoff increases thec by ~10%, lowers the lambda by ~15%, and removes the most prolate haloes. inaddition, it largely removes the anti-correlation between c and lambda thoughnot entirely. we also investigate the effects of the large-scale environment.we find that more concentrated haloes live in denser environments. note,however, that the trend is weak compared to the scatter. for the spinparameters we find no environment dependence, while there is a weak indicationthat the most spherical haloes reside in denser region. finally, using a simplemodel for disk galaxy formation we show that haloes that host low surfacebrightness galaxies are expected to be hosted by a biased sub-set of haloes.not only do these haloes have spin parameters that are larger than average,they also have c that are 15% percent lower than the average at a given halomass. we discuss the implications of all these findings for the claimeddisagreement between halo concentrations inferred from lsb rotation curves, andthose expected for a lcdm cosmology.

astro-ph;9402009	the nature of dark matter	collisionless particles, such as cold dark matter, interact only by gravityand do not have any associated length scale, therefore the dark halos ofgalaxies should have negligible core radii. this expectation has been supportedby numerical experiments of collisionless particles within scale free and colddark matter cosmologies. most dwarf spiral galaxies are almost completely darkmatter dominated, allowing a unique insight into their mass - density profileswhich can be approximated by isothermal spheres with core radii of order 3 - 7kpc. we can therefore make a direct comparison between these galaxies, andhalos which form within the numerical simulations. this yields a severediscrepancy in that the simulations predict the density to fall as rho(r)\propto r^{-1} on the scales where the data show that rho(r) = const: e.g. themodels overestimate the mass within the central few kpc of the halos by afactor of four. the formation of the luminous component of galaxies exacerbatesthis disparity between theory and observations, since the contraction of thebaryons can significantly increase the central dark matter density.

astro-ph;9403042	the clustering properties of iras galaxies	we investigate the clustering of galaxies in the qdot redshift survey of irasgalaxies. we find that the redshift space two-point correlation function iswell approximated by a power-law of slope -1.11+\-0.09, with clustering length3.87+\-0.32 mpc/h out to pair separations of 25 mpc\h. on scales larger than 40mpc/h, the correlation function is consistent with zero. the r.m.s. fluctuationin the count of qdot galaxies above the poisson level in spheres of radius 8mpc/h is \sigma_8^{iras}=0.58+\-0.14, showing that fluctuations in thedistribution of iras galaxies on these scales are smaller than those of opticalgalaxies by a factor of about 0.65, with an uncertainty of 25%. we find nodetectable difference between the correlation functions measured in redshiftspace and in real space, leading to a $2\sigma$ limit of b_{iras}/\omega^{0.6}&gt;1.05, where b_{iras} is the bias factor for iras galaxies and \omega is thecosmological density parameter. the qdot autocorrelation function calculated inconcentric shells increases significantly with shell radius. this difference ismore likely due to sampling fluctuations than to an increase of the clusteringstrength with galaxy luminosity, but the two effects are difficult todisentangle; our data allow at most an increase of \sim 20% in clusteringstrength for each decade in luminosity. for separations greater than \sim 3mpc/h, the cross-correlation function of abell clusters (with richness r\ge 1)and qdot galaxies is well approximated by a power-law of slope -1.81+\-0.10,with clustering length 10.10+\-0.45 mpc/h, and no significant signal beyond\gsim 50 mpc\h. this cross-correlation depends only weakly on cluster richness.

astro-ph;9407023	dynamical and observable constraints on rambos: robust associations of  massive baryonic objects	if the halo dark matter consists of faint baryonic stars, then these objectsprobably formed at an early epoch within large associations with similardynamical properties to globular or open clusters. we use the luminosityfunction of globular clusters as a function of galactocentric distance toprovide a very strong constraint on the properties of rambos. we show that atthe solar radius, dynamical constraints confine such clusters to a bounded andnarrow parameter space with effective radii between 1 pc and 15 pc,corresponding to masses between $ \sim 10 -10^4 m_\odot$ and $\sim10^4-10^6m_\odot$, respectively. compact and massive clusters are excluded bythese constraints, and therefore cannot provide a heating source capable ofexplaining the observed correlation between age and velocity dispersion fordisk stars. less than 1\% of the halo could be within rambos of mass$10^7m_\odot$;an order magnitude lower than required in the model proposed bywasserman \&amp; salpeter. neither the iras or iso infrared satellites have thecapability to detect clusters of brown dwarfs within the dynamically allowedparameter space. clusters of white dwarfs that formed a hubble time ago have asurface brightness several magnitudes below the sky level; even clusters of lowmass stars at the edge of the main sequence would remain invisible to thedeepest k band surveys to date. we conclude that gravitational microlensing isthe only method capable of constraining the abundance of dark matter in theform of clusters of stars. recovering the dynamical properties of rambos willbe very difficult due to their large covering factor and low internal velocitydispersion.

astro-ph;9701211	morphological transformation from galaxy harassment	galaxy morphologies in clusters have undergone a remarkable transition overthe past several billion years. distant clusters at $z \sim 0.4$ are filledwith small spiral galaxies, many of which are disturbed and show evidence ofmultiple bursts of star-formation. this population is absent from nearbyclusters where spheroidals comprise the faint end of the luminosity function.our numerical simulations follow the evolution of disk galaxies in a richcluster owing to encounters with brighter galaxies and the cluster's tidalfield---galaxy harassment. after a bursting transient phase, they undergo acomplete morphological transformation from "disks" to"spheroidals". we examinethe remnants and find support for our theory in detailed comparisons of thephotometry and kinematics of the spheroidal galaxies in clusters. our modelnaturally accounts for the intermediate age stellar population seen in thesespheroidals as well as the trend in dwarf to giant ratio with cluster richness.the final shapes are typically prolate and are flattened primarily by velocityanisotropy. their mass to light ratios are in the range 3---8 in good agreementwith observations.

astro-ph;9701212	the formation of quasars in low luminosity hosts via galaxy harassment	we have simulated disk galaxies undergoing continual bombardment by othergalaxies in a rich cluster. "galaxy harassment" leads to dramatic evolution ofsmaller disk galaxies and provides an extremely effective mechanism to fuel acentral quasar. within a few billion years after a small disk galaxy enters thecluster environment, up to 90% of its gas can be driven into the inner 500 pc.up to half of the mass can be transferred in a burst lasting just 100-200 myr.this transport of gas to the center of galaxy is far more efficient than anymechanism proposed before. galaxy harassment was first proposed to explain thedisturbed blue galaxies in clusters seen in clusters at ($z \gsim 0.3$), the"butcher-oemler effect". quasars at the same reshifts lie in more clusteredenvironments than those at lower redshift. recent hst observations find thatroughly half of all observed quasar host galaxiess are fainter than \l*, withmany of these less luminous hosts occuring at redshifts $z \gsim 0.3$. weexamine 5 quasars that are claimed to have low luminosity hosts and find that 3are in rich clusters of galaxies, the fourth may be in a cluster but theevidence for this is marginal. the environment of the fifth has not beenstudied.

astro-ph;9709051	resolving the structure of cold dark matter halos	we examine the effects of mass resolution and force softening on the densityprofiles of cold dark matter halos that form within cosmological n-bodysimulations. as we increase the mass and force resolution, we resolveprogenitor halos that collapse at higher redshifts and have very highdensities. at our highest resolution we have nearly 3 million particles withinthe virial radius, several orders of magnitude more than previously used and wecan resolve more than one thousand surviving dark matter halos within thissingle virialised system. the halo profiles become steeper in the centralregions and we may not have achieved convergence to a unique slope within theinner 10% of the virialised region. results from two very high resolution halosimulations yield steep inner density profiles, $\rho(r)\sim r^{-1.4}$. theabundance and properties of arcs formed within this potential will be differentfrom calculations based on lower resolution simulations. the kinematics ofdisks within such a steep potential may prove problematic for the cdm modelwhen compared with the observed properties of halos on galactic scales.

astro-ph;9801192	dark matter halos within clusters	we examine the properties of dark matter halos within a rich galaxy clusterusing a high resolution simulation that captures the cosmological context of acold dark matter universe. the mass and force resolution permit the resolutionof 150 halos with circular velocities larger than 80 kms within the cluster'svirial radius of 2 mpc. this enables an unprecedented study of the statisticalproperties of a large sample of dark matter halos evolving in a denseenvironment. the cumulative fraction of mass attached to these halos variesfrom 0% at 200 kpc, to 13% at the virial radius. even at this resolution theovermerging problem persists; halos that pass within 200 kpc of the clustercenter are tidally disrupted. additional substructure is lost at earlier epochswithin the massive progenitor halos. the median ratio of apocentric topericentric radii is 6:1; the orbital distribution is close to isotropic,circular orbits are rare, radial orbits are common. the orbits of halos areunbiased with respect to both position within the cluster and with the orbitsof the smooth dark matter background and no velocity bias is detected. thetidal radii of surviving halos are generally well-fit using the simple analyticprediction applied to their orbital pericenters. halos within clusters havehigher concentrations than those in the field. within the cluster, halo densityprofiles can be modified by tidal forces and individual encounters with otherhalos that cause significant mass loss - ``galaxy harassment''. mergers betweenhalos do not occur inside the clusters virial radius.

astro-ph;9811127	on the survival and destruction of spiral galaxies in clusters	we follow the evolution of disk galaxies within a cluster that formshierarchically in a cold dark matter n-body simulation. at a redshift z=0.5 weselect several dark matter halos that have quiet merger histories and are aboutto enter the newly forming cluster environment. the halos are replaced withequilibrium high resolution model spirals that are constructed to representexamples of low surface brightness (lsb) and high surface brightness (hsb)galaxies. varying the disk and halo structural parameters reveals that theresponse of a spiral galaxy to tidal encounters depends primarily on thepotential depth of the mass distribution and the disk scale length. lsbgalaxies, characterised by slowly rising rotation curves and large scalelengths, evolve dramatically under the influence of rapid encounters withsubstructure and strong tidal shocks from the global cluster potential ---galaxy harassment. we find that up to 90% of their stars are tidally strippedand congregate in large diffuse tails that trace the orbital path of the galaxyand form the diffuse intra-cluster light. the bound stellar remnants closelyresemble the dwarf spheroidals (de's) that populate nearby clusters. hsbgalaxies are stable to the chaos of cluster formation and tidal encounters.these disks lie well within the tidally limited dark matter halos and theirpotentials are more concentrated. although very few stars are stripped, thescale height of the disks increases substantially and no spiral featuresremain, therefore we speculate that these galaxies would be identified as s0galaxies in present day clusters.

astro-ph;9811450	galaxy destruction and diffuse light in clusters	deep images of the centaurus and coma clusters reveal two spectacular arcs ofdiffuse light that stretch for over 100 kpc, yet are just a few kpc wide. at asurface brightness of m_b \sim 27-28th arcsec^-2, the centaurus arc is the moststriking example known of structure in the diffuse light component of a richgalaxy cluster. we use numerical simulations to show that the centaurus featurecan be reproduced by the tidal debris of a spiral galaxy that has been tidallydisrupted by the gravitational potential of ngc 4709. the surface brightnessand narrow dimensions of the diffuse light suggest that the disk wasco-rotating with its orbital path past pericentre. features this prominent inclusters will be relatively rare, although at fainter surface brightness levelsthe diffuse light will reveal a wealth of structure. deeper imaging surveys maybe able to trace this feature for several times its presently observed extentand somewhere along the tidal debris, a fraction of the original stellarcomponent of the disk will remain bound, but transformed into a faintspheroidal galaxy. it should be possible to confirm the galactic origin of thecentaurus arc by observing planetary nebulae along its length with redshiftsclose to that of ngc 4709.

astro-ph;9903064	the fate of lsb galaxies in clusters and the origin of the diffuse  intra-cluster light	we follow the evolution of disk galaxies within a cluster that formshierarchically in a standard cold dark matter n-body simulation. at a redshiftz=0.5 we select several dark matter halos that have quiet merger histories andare about to enter the newly forming cluster environment. the halos arereplaced with equilibrium high resolution model spirals that are constructed torepresent luminous examples of low surface brightness (lsb) and high surfacebrightness (hsb) galaxies. whilst the models have the same total luminosity,\sim l_*, they have very different internal mass profiles, core radii and diskscale lengths, however they all lie at the same place on the tully-fisherrelation. due to their ``soft'' central potentials, lsb galaxies evolvedramatically under the influence of rapid encounters with dark matter halos,substructure and strong tidal shocks from the global cluster potential - galaxyharassment. as much as 90% of the lsb disk stars are tidally stripped andcongregate in large diffuse tails that trace the orbital path of the galaxy andform the diffuse intra-cluster light. the bound stellar remnants closelyresemble the dwarf spheroidals (de's) that populate nearby clusters, with largescale lengths and low central surface brightness.

astro-ph;9903164	cold collapse and the core catastrophe	we show that a universe dominated by cold dark matter fails to reproduce therotation curves of dark matter dominated galaxies, one of the key problems thatit was designed to resolve. we perform numerical simulations of the formationof dark matter halos, each containing \gsim 10^6 particles and resolved to0.003 times the virial radius, allowing an accurate comparison with rotationcurve data. a good fit to both galactic and cluster sized halos can be achievedusing the density profile rho(r) \propto [(r/r_s)^1.5(1+(r/r_s)^1.5)]^-1, wherer_s is a scale radius. this profile has a steeper asymptotic slope, rho(r)\propto r^-1.5, and a sharper turnover than found by lower resolution studies.the central structure of relaxed halos that form within a hierarchical universehas a remarkably small scatter (unrelaxed halos would not host disks). wecompare the results with a sample of dark matter dominated, low surfacebrightness (lsb) galaxies with circular velocities in the range 100-300 km/s.the rotation curves of disks within cold dark matter halos rise too steeply tomatch these data which require a constant mass density in the central regions.the same conclusion is reached if we compare the scale free shape of observedrotation curves with the simulation data. it is important to confirm theseresults using stellar rather than hi rotation curves for lsb galaxies. we testthe effects of introducing a cut-off in the power spectrum that may occur in auniverse dominated by warm dark matter. in this case halos form by a monolithiccollapse but the final density profile hardly changes, demonstrating that themerger history does not play a role in determining the halo structure.

astro-ph;9903436	ram pressure stripping of spiral galaxies in clusters	we use 3-dimensional sph/n-body simulations to study ram pressure strippingof gas from spiral galaxies orbiting in clusters. we find that the analyticexpectation of gunn &amp; gott (1972) relating the gravitational restoring forceprovided by the disk to the ram pressure force, provides a good approximationto the radius that gas will be stripped from a galaxy. however, at small radiiit is also important to consider the potential provided by the bulge component.a spiral galaxy passing through the core of a rich cluster such as coma, willhave its gaseous disk truncated to $\sim 4$ kpc, thus losing $\sim 80%$ of itsdiffuse gas mass. the timescale for this to occur is a fraction of a crossingtime $\sim 10^7$ years. galaxies orbiting within poorer clusters, or inclinedto the direction of motion through the intra-cluster medium will losesignificantly less gas. we conclude that ram-pressure alone is insufficient toaccount for the rapid and widespread truncation of star-formation observed incluster galaxies, or the morphological transformation of sab's to s0's that isnecessary to explain the butcher-oemler effect.

astro-ph;9910166	density profiles and substructure of dark matter halos: converging  results at ultra-high numerical resolution	can n-body simulations reliably determine the structural properties of darkmatter halos? focussing on a virgo-sized galaxy cluster, we increase theresolution of current ``high resolution simulations'' by almost an order ofmagnitude to examine the convergence of the important physical quantities. wehave 4 million particles within the cluster and force resolution 0.5 kpc/h(0.05% of the virial radius). the central density profile has a logarithmicslope of -1.5, as found in lower resolution studies of the same halo,indicating that the profile has converged to the ``physical'' limit down toscales of a few kpc. also the abundance of substructure is consistent with thatderived from lower resolution runs; on the scales explored, the mass andcircular velocity functions are close to power laws of exponents ~ -1.9 and -4.overmerging appears to be globally unimportant for suhalos with circularvelocities &gt; 100 km/s. we can trace most of the cluster progenitors from z=3 tothe present; the central object (the dark matter analog of a cd galaxy)isassembled between z=3 and 1 from the merging of a dozen halos with v_circ \sim300 km/s. the mean circular velocity of the subhalos decreases by ~ 20% over 5billion years, due to tidal mass loss. the velocity dispersions of halos anddark matter globally agree within 10%, but the halos are spatially anti-biased,and, in the very central region of the cluster, they show positive velocitybias; however, this effect appears to depend on numerical resolution.

0810.1734	central mass and luminosity of milky way satellites in the lcdm model	it has been pointed out that the galactic satellites all have a common massaround 1e7 msun within 300 pc (m03), while they span almost four order ofmagnitudes in luminosity (mateo et al. 1993, strigari et al. 2008). it isargued that this may reflect a specific scale for galaxy formation or a scalefor dark matter clustering. here we use numerical simulations coupled with asemi-analytic model for galaxy formation, to predict the central mass andluminosity of galactic satellites in the lcdm model. we show that this commonmass scale can be explained within the cold dark matter scenario when thephysics of galaxy formation is taken into account. the narrow range of m03comes from the narrow distribution of circular velocities at time of accretion(peaking around 20 km/s) for satellites able to form stars and the not tightcorrelation between halo concentration and circular velocity. the wide range ofsatellite luminosities is due to a combination of the mass at time of accretionand the broad distribution of accretion redshifts for a given mass. this causesthe satellites baryonic content to be suppressed by photo-ionization to verydifferent extents. our results favor the argument that the common mass m03reflects a specific scale (circular velocity ~ 20 km/s) for star formation.

0810.1741	large scale galactic turbulence: can self-gravity drive the observed hi  velocity dispersions?	observations of turbulent velocity dispersions in the hi component ofgalactic disks show a characteristic floor in galaxies with low star formationrates and within individual galaxies the dispersion profiles decline withradius. we carry out several high resolution adaptive mesh simulations ofgaseous disks embedded within dark matter haloes to explore the roles ofcooling, star-formation, feedback, shearing motions and baryon fraction indriving turbulent motions. in all simulations the disk slowly cools untilgravitational and thermal instabilities give rise to a multi-phase medium inwhich a large population of dense self-gravitating cold clouds are embeddedwithin a warm gaseous phase that forms through shock heating. the diffuse gasis highly turbulent and is an outcome of large scale driving of globalnon-axisymmetric modes as well as cloud-cloud tidal interactions and merging.at low star-formation rates these processes alone can explain the observed hivelocity dispersion profiles and the characteristic value of ~10 km/s observedwithin a wide range of disk galaxies. supernovae feedback creates a significanthot gaseous phase and is an important driver of turbulence in galaxies with astar-formation rate per unit area &gt;10^-3 m_sun/yr/kpc^2.

0812.2033	the graininess of dark matter haloes	we use the recently completed one billion particle via lactea ii lambdacdmsimulation to investigate local properties like density, mean velocity,velocity dispersion, anisotropy, orientation and shape of the velocitydispersion ellipsoid, as well as structure in velocity space of dark matterhaloes. we show that at the same radial distance from the halo centre, theseproperties can deviate by orders of magnitude from the canonical, sphericallyaveraged values, a variation that can only be partly explained by triaxialityand the presence of subhaloes. the mass density appears smooth in the centralrelaxed regions but spans four orders of magnitude in the outskirts, bothbecause of the presence of subhaloes as well as of underdense regions and holesin the matter distribution. in the inner regions the local velocity dispersionellipsoid is aligned with the shape ellipsoid of the halo. this is not true inthe outer parts where the orientation becomes more isotropic. the clumpystructure in local velocity space of the outer halo can not be well describedby a smooth multivariate normal distribution. via lactea ii also shows thepresence of cold streams made visible by their high 6d phase space density.generally, the structure of dark matter haloes shows a high degree ofgraininess in phase space that cannot be described by a smooth distributionfunction.
