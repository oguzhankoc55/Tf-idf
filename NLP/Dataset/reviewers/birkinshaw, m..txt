0901.1346	high-energy particle acceleration at the radio-lobe shock of centaurus a	we present new results on the shock around the southwest radio lobe ofcentaurus a using data from the chandra very large programme observations. thex-ray spectrum of the emission around the outer southwestern edge of the lobeis well described by a single power-law model with galactic absorption --thermal models are strongly disfavoured, except in the region closest to thenucleus. we conclude that a significant fraction of the x-ray emission aroundthe southwest part of the lobe is synchrotron, not thermal. we infer that inthe region where the shock is strongest and the ambient gas density lowest, theinflation of the lobe is accelerating particles to x-ray synchrotron emittingenergies, similar to supernova remnants such as sn1006. this interpretationresolves a problem of our earlier, purely thermal, interpretation for thisemission, namely that the density compression across the shock was required tobe much larger than the theoretically expected factor of 4. we estimate thatthe lobe is expanding to the southwest with a velocity of ~2600 km/s, roughlymach 8 relative to the ambient medium. we discuss the spatial variation ofspectral index across the shock region, concluding that our observationsconstrain gamma_max for the accelerated particles to be 10^8 at the strongestpart of the shock, consistent with expectations from diffusive shockacceleration theory. finally, we consider the implications of these results forthe production of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (uhecrs) and tev emission fromcentaurus a, concluding that the shock front region is unlikely to be asignificant source of uhecrs, but that tev emission from this region isexpected at levels comparable to current limits at tev energies, for plausibleassumed magnetic field strengths.

0901.3552	a multi-wavelength study of the high surface brightness hotspot in  pks1421-490	long baseline array imaging of the z=0.663 broad line radio galaxypks1421-490 reveals a 400 pc diameter high surface brightness hotspot at aprojected distance of approximately 40kpc from the active galactic nucleus. theisotropic x-ray luminosity of the hotspot, l_{2-10 kev} = 3 10^{44} ergs/s, iscomparable to the isotropic x-ray luminosity of the entire x-ray jet ofpks0637-752, and the peak radio surface brightness is hundreds of times greaterthan that of the brightest hotspot in cygnus a. we model the radio to x-rayspectral energy distribution using a one-zone synchrotron self compton modelwith a near equipartition magnetic field strength of 3 mg. there is a strongbrightness asymmetry between the approaching and receding hotspots and the hotspot spectrum remains flat (alpha ~ 0.5) well beyond the predicted coolingbreak for a 3 mg magnetic field, indicating that the hotspot emission may bedoppler beamed. a high plasma velocity beyond the terminal jet shock could bethe result of a dynamically important magnetic field in the jet. there is achange in the slope of the hotspot radio spectrum at ghz frequencies fromalpha~0.5 to alpha&lt;0.2, which we model by incorporating a cut-off in theelectron energy distribution at gamma_{min} ~ 650, with higher values impliedif the hotspot emission is doppler beamed. we show that a sharp decrease in theelectron number density below a lorentz factor of 650 would arise from thedissipation of bulk kinetic energy in an electron/proton jet with a lorentzfactor gamma_{jet} ~ 5.

0902.3945	survey of planetary nebulae at 30 ghz with ocra-p	we report the results of a survey of 442 planetary nebulae at 30 ghz. thepurpose of the survey is to develop a list of planetary nebulae as calibrationsources which could be used for high frequency calibration in future. for 41pne with sufficient data, we test the emission mechanisms in order to evaluatewhether or not spinning dust plays an important role in their spectra at 30ghz.  the 30-ghz data were obtained with a twin-beam differencing radiometer,ocra-p, which is in operation on the torun 32-m telescope. sources were scannedboth in right ascension and declination. we estimated flux densities at 30 ghzusing a free-free emission model and compared it with our data.  the primary result is a catalogue containing the flux densities of 93planetary nebulae at 30 ghz. sources with sufficient data were compared with aspectral model of free-free emission. the model shows that free-free emissioncan generally explain the observed flux densities at 30 ghz thus no otheremission mechanism is needed to account for the high frequency spectra.

0903.2663	the jet-heated x-ray filament in the centaurus a northern middle radio  lobe	we present results from a 40 ks {\em xmm-newton} observation of the x-rayfilament coincident with the southeast edge of the centaurus a northern middleradio lobe (nml). we find that the x-ray filament consists of five spatiallyresolved x-ray knots embedded in a continuous diffuse bridge. the spectrum ofeach knot is well fitted by a thermal model with temperatures ranging from0.3-0.7 kev and subsolar elemental abundances. in four of the five knots,non-thermal models are a poor fit to the spectra, conclusively ruling outsynchrotron or ic/cmb mechanisms for their emission. the internal pressures ofthe knots exceed that of the ambient ism or the equipartition pressure of thenml by more than an order of magnitude, demonstrating that they must be shortlived ($\sim3\times10^6$ yrs). based on energetic arguments, it is implausiblethat these knots have been ionized by the beamed flux from the active galacticnucleus of cen a or that they have been shock-heated by supersonic inflation ofthe nml. in our view, the most viable scenario for the origin of the x-rayknots is that they are the result of cold gas shock heated by a directinteraction with the jet. the lifetimes of the x-ray knots in the nml areroughly the same as the age of the strong shock around the sw inner lobe,suggesting they were created in the same agn outburst. the most plausible modelof the nml is that it is a bubble from a previous outburst that is beingre-energized by the current outburst. we also report the discovery of a largescale (at least 35 kpc radius) gas halo around cen a.

0904.1112	unmasking the active galactic nucleus in pks j2310-437	pks j2310-437 is an agn with bright x-ray emission relative to its weak radioemission and optical continuum. it is believed that its jet lies far enoughfrom the line of sight that it is not highly relativistically beamed. it thusprovides an extreme test of agn models. we present new observations aimed atrefining the measurement of the source's properties. in optical photometry withthe ntt we measure a central excess with relatively steep spectrum lying abovethe bright elliptical galaxy emission, and we associate the excess wholly or inpart with the agn. a new full-track radio observation with the atca finds thatthe core 8.64ghz emission has varied by about 20 per cent over 38 months, andimproves the mapping of the weak jet. with chandra we measure awell-constrained power-law spectral index for the x-ray core, uncontaminated byextended emission from the cluster environment, with a negligible level ofintrinsic absorption. weak x-ray emission from the resolved radio jet is alsomeasured. our analysis suggests that the optical continuum in this radio galaxyhas varied by at least a factor of four over a timescale of about two years,something that should be testable with further observations. we conclude thatthe most likely explanation for the bright central x-ray emission issynchrotron radiation from high-energy electrons.

0706.4013	a chandra study of the lobe/ism interactions around the inner radio  lobes of centaurus a: constraints on the temperature structure and transport  processes	we present results from deeper {\em chandra} observations of the southwestradio lobe of centaurus a, first described by kraft et al. (2003). we find thatthe sharp x-ray surface brightness discontinuity extends around $\sim$75% ofthe periphery of the radio lobe, and detect significant temperature jumps inthe brightest regions of this discontinuity nearest to the nucleus. thisdemonstrates that this discontinuity is indeed a strong shock which is theresult of an overpressure which has built up in the entire lobe over time.additionally, we demonstrate that if the mean free path for ions to transferenergy and momentum to the electrons behind the shock is as large as thespitzer value, the electron and proton temperatures will not have equilibratedalong the sw boundary of the radio lobe where the shock is strongest. thus theproton temperature of the shocked gas could be considerably larger than theobserved electron temperature, and the total energy of the outburstcorrespondingly larger as well. we investigate this using a simpleone-dimensional shock model for a two-fluid (proton/electron) plasma. we findthat for the thermodynamic parameters of the cen a shock the electrontemperature rises rapidly from $\sim$0.29 kev (the temperature of the ambientism) to $\sim$3.5 kev at which point heating from the protons is balanced byadiabatic losses. the proton and electron temperatures do not equilibrate in atimescale less than the age of the lobe. we note that the measured electrontemperature of similar features in other nearby powerful radio galaxies in poorenvironments may considerably underestimate the strength and velocity of theshock.

0906.5364	luminosity functions of lmxbs in centaurus a: globular clusters versus  the field	we study the x-ray luminosity function (xlf) of low mass x-ray binaries(lmxb) in the nearby early-type galaxy centaurus a, concentrating primarily ontwo aspects of binary populations: the xlf behavior at the low luminosity limitand comparison between globular cluster and field sources. the 800 ksecexposure of the deep chandra vlp program allows us to reach a limitingluminosity of 8e35 erg/s, about 2-3 times deeper than previous investigations.we confirm the presence of the low luminosity break in the overall lmxb xlf atlog(l_x)=37.2-37.6 below which the luminosity distribution follows a constantdn/d(ln l). separating globular cluster and field sources, we find astatistically significant difference between the two luminosity distributionswith a relative underabundance of faint sources in the globular clusterpopulation. this demonstrates that the samples are drawn from distinct parentpopulations and may disprove the hypothesis that the entire lmxb population inearly type galaxies is created dynamically in globular clusters. as a plausibleexplanation for this difference in the xlfs, we suggest that there is anenhanced fraction of helium accreting systems in globular clusters, which arecreated in collisions between red giants and neutron stars. due to the 4 timeshigher ionization temperature of he, such systems are subject to accretion diskinstabilities at approximately 20 times higher mass accretion rate, andtherefore are not observed as persistent sources at low luminosities.

0909.1189	30 ghz observations of sources in the vsa fields	small angular scale (high l) studies of cosmic microwave backgroundanisotropies require accurate knowledge of the statistical properties ofextragalactic sources at cm-mm wavelengths. we have used a 30 ghz dual-beamreceiver (ocra-p) on the torun 32-m telescope to measure the flux densities of121 sources in vsa fields selected at 15 ghz with the ryle telescope. we havedetected 57 sources above a limiting flux density of 5mjy, of which 31 sourceshave a flux density greater than 10mjy, which is our effective completenesslimit. from these measurements we derive a surface density of sources above10mjy at 30 ghz of 2.0+/-0.4 per square degree. this is consistent with thesurface density obtained by mason et al. (2009) who observed a large sample ofsources selected at a much lower frequency (1.4 ghz). we have also investigatedthe dependence of the spectral index distribution on flux density by comparingour results with those for sources above 1 jy selected from the wmap 22 ghzcatalogue. we conclude that the proportion of steep spectrum sources increaseswith decreasing flux density, qualitatively consistent with the predictions ofdezotti et al. (2005). we find no evidence for an unexpected population ofsources whose spectra rise towards high frequencies, which would affect ourability to interpret current high resolution cmb observations at 30 ghz andabove.

0911.2115	long term monitoring of the dynamics and particle acceleration of knots  in the jet of centaurus a	we present new and archival multi-frequency radio and x-ray data forcentaurus a obtained over almost 20 years at the vla and with chandra, withwhich we measure the x-ray and radio spectral indices of jet knots, fluxdensity variations in the jet knots, polarization variations, and propermotions. we compare the observed properties with current knot formation modelsand particle acceleration mechanisms. we rule out impulsive particleacceleration as a formation mechanism for all of the knots as we detect thesame population of knots in all of the observations and we find no evidence ofextreme variability in the x-ray knots. we find the most likely mechanism forall the stationary knots is a collision resulting in a local shock followed bya steady state of prolonged, stable particle acceleration and x-ray synchrotronemission. in this scenario, the x-ray-only knots have radio counterparts thatare too faint to be detected, while the radio-only knots are due to weak shockswhere no particles are accelerated to x-ray emitting energies. although thebase knots are prime candidates for reconfinement shocks, the presence of amoving knot in this vicinity and the fact that there are two base knots arehard to explain in this model. we detect apparent motion in three knots;however, their velocities and locations provide no conclusive evidence for oragainst a faster moving `spine' within the jet. the radio-only knots, bothstationary and moving, may be due to compression of the fluid.

1006.1649	the jet and counterjet of 3c 270 (ngc 4261) viewed in the x-ray with  chandra	the radio source 3c 270, hosted by ngc 4261, is the brightest known exampleof counterjet x-ray emission from a low-power radio galaxy. we report on thex-ray emission of the jet and counterjet from 130 ks of chandra data. we arguethat the x-ray emission is synchrotron radiation and that the internalproperties of the jet and counterjet are remarkably similar. we find a smoothconnection in x-ray hardness and x-ray to radio ratio between the jet and oneof the x-ray components within the core spectrum. we observe wedge-likedepressions in diffuse x-ray surface brightness surrounding the jets, andinterpret them as regions where an aged population of electrons providespressure to balance the interstellar medium of ngc 4261. about 20% of the massof the interstellar medium has been displaced by the radio source. treating 3c270 as a twin-jet system, we find an interesting agreement between the ratio ofjet-to-counterjet length in x-rays and that expected if x-rays are observedover the distance that an outflow from the core would have traveled in ~6x10^4yr. x-ray synchrotron loss times are shorter than this, and we suggest thatmost particle acceleration arises as a result of turbulence and dissipation ina stratified flow. we speculate that an episode of activity in the centralengine beginning ~6x10^4 yr ago has led to an increased velocity shear. thishas enhanced the ability of the jet plasma to accelerate electrons tox-ray-synchrotron-emitting energies, forming the x-ray jet and counterjet thatwe see today.

1205.4726	the jet-cloud interacting radio galaxy pks b2152-699. i. structures  revealed in new deep radio and x-ray observations	pks b2152-699 has radio power characteristic of sources that dominate radiofeedback. we present new deep atca, chandra and optical observations, and testthe feedback model. we report the first high-resolution observations of theradio jet. the inner jet extends ~8.5 kpc towards an optical emission-line highionization cloud (hic) before taking a zig-zag path to an offset position. jetx-ray synchrotron radiation is seen. the hic is associated with 0.3 kev x-raygas of anomalously low metallicity. on larger scales the radio galaxy displaysall three x-ray features that together confirm supersonic expansion of thelobes into the external medium: gas cavities, inverse-compton emission showingexcess internal lobe pressure, and high-contrast arms of temperature above the~1 kev ambient medium. the well-formed s lobe on the counterjet side isexpanding with a mach number 2.2-3. we estimate a cavity power ~3x10^43 ergs/s,which falls well below previously reported correlations with radio power. thetotal inferred time-averaged jet power, ~4x10^44 ergs/s, is dominated by thekinetic and thermal energy of shocked gas, and if used instead would bring thesource into better agreement with the correlations. the s hotspot is the morecomplex, with a spiral polarization structure. its bright peak emitssynchrotron x-rays. the fainter n hotspot is particularly interesting, withx-rays offset in the direction of the incoming jet by ~1 arcsec relative to theradio peak. here modest (delta ~ 6) relativistic beaming and a steep radiospectrum cause the jet to be x-ray bright through inverse-compton scatteringbefore it decelerates. with such beaming, a modest proton content or smalldeparture from minimum energy in the jet will align estimates of theinstantaneous and time-averaged jet power. the hotspots suggest acceleration ofelectrons to a maximum energy ~10^13 ev in the jet termination shocks.

1208.0069	a multi-wavelength study of the jet, lobes and core of the quasar pks  2101-490	we present a detailed study of the x-ray, optical and radio emission from thejet, lobes and core of the quasar pks 2101-490 as revealed by new chandra, hstand atca images. we extract the radio to x-ray spectral energy distributionsfrom seven regions of the 13 arcsecond jet, and model the jet x-ray emission interms of doppler beamed inverse compton scattering of the cosmic microwavebackground (ic/cmb) for a jet in a state of equipartition between particle andmagnetic field energy densities. this model implies that the jet remains highlyrelativistic hundreds of kpc from the nucleus, with a bulk lorentz factor gamma~ 6 and magnetic field of order 30 microgauss. we detect an apparent radiativecooling break in the synchrotron spectrum of one of the jet knots, and are ableto interpret this in terms of a standard one-zone continuous injection model,based on jet parameters derived from the ic/cmb model. however, we noteapparent substructure in the bright optical knot in one of the hst bands. weconfront the ic/cmb model with independent estimates of the jet power, and findthat the ic/cmb model jet power is consistent with the independent estimates,provided that the minimum electron lorentz factor gamma_min &gt; 50, and the knotsare significantly longer than the jet width, as implied by de-projection of theobserved knot lengths.

1209.4637	periodic structure in the mpc-scale jet of pks 0637-752	we present 18 ghz australia telescope compact array imaging of the mpc-scalequasar jet pks 0637-752 with angular resolution ~0.58 arcseconds. we drawattention to a spectacular train of quasi-periodic knots along the inner 11arcseconds of the jet, with average separation ~1.1 arcsec (7.6 kpc projected).we consider two classes of model to explain the periodic knots: those thatinvolve a static pattern through which the jet plasma travels (e.g. stationaryshocks); and those that involve modulation of the jet engine. interpreting theknots as re-confinement shocks implies the jet kinetic power q ~ 10^{46} erg/s,but the constant knot separation along the jet is not expected in a realisticexternal density profile. for models involving modulation of the jet engine, wefind that the required modulation period is 2 x 10^3 yr &lt; \tau &lt; 3 x 10^5 yr.the lower end of this range is applicable if the jet remains highlyrelativistic on kpc-scales, as implied by the ic/cmb model of jet x-rayemission. we suggest that the quasi-periodic jet structure in pks 0637-752 maybe analogous to the quasi-periodic jet modulation seen in the microquasar grs1915+105, believed to result from limit cycle behaviour in an unstableaccretion disk. if variations in the accretion rate are driven by a binaryblack hole, the predicted orbital radius is 0.7 &lt; a &lt; 30 pc, which correspondsto a maximum angular separation of ~0.1 - 5 mas.

1309.0836	gravitational lens models based on submillimeter array imaging of  herschel-selected strongly lensed sub-millimeter galaxies at z&gt;1.5	strong gravitational lenses are now being routinely discovered in wide-fieldsurveys at (sub)millimeter wavelengths. we present submillimeter array (sma)high-spatial resolution imaging and gemini-south and multiple mirror telescopeoptical spectroscopy of strong lens candidates discovered in the two widestextragalactic surveys conducted by the herschel space observatory: theherschel-astrophysical terahertz large area survey (h-atlas) and the herschelmulti-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes). from a sample of 30 herschelsources with s_500&gt;100 mjy, 21 are strongly lensed (multiply imaged), 4 aremoderately lensed (singly imaged), and the remainder require additional data todetermine their lensing status. we apply a visibility-plane lens modelingtechnique to the sma data to recover information about the masses of the lensesas well as the intrinsic (i.e., unlensed) sizes (r_half) and far-infraredluminosities (l_fir) of the lensed submillimeter galaxies (smgs). the sample oflenses comprises primarily isolated massive galaxies, but includes some groupsand clusters as well. several of the lenses are located at z_lens&gt;0.7, aredshift regime that is inaccessible to lens searches based on sloan digitalsky survey spectroscopy. the lensed smgs are amplified by factors that aresignificantly below statistical model predictions given the 500um fluxdensities of our sample. we speculate that this may reflect a deficiency in ourunderstanding of the intrinsic sizes and luminosities of the brightest smgs.the lensed smgs span nearly one decade in l_fir (median l_fir=7.9x10^12 l_sun)and two decades in fir luminosity surface density (median sigma_fir=6.0x10^11l_sun kpc^-2). the strong lenses in this sample and others identified via(sub-)mm surveys will provide a wealth of information regarding theastrophysics of galaxy formation and evolution over a wide range in redshift.

1312.5311	sliding not sloshing in abell 3744: the influence of radio galaxies ngc  7018 and 7016 on cluster gas	we present new x-ray (chandra) and radio (jvla) observations of the nearbycluster abell 3744. it hosts two prominent radio galaxies with powers in therange critical for radio-mode feedback. the radio emission from these galaxiesterminates in buoyant tendrils reaching the cluster's outer edge, and theradio-emitting plasma clearly influences the cluster's x-ray-emittingatmosphere. the cluster's average gas temperature, of kt=3.5 kev, is high forits bolometric luminosity of 3.2 \times 10^{43} ergs s^{-1}, but the 100kpc-scale cavity carved out by radio-emitting plasma shows evidence of lessthan 2 per cent of the excess enthalpy. we suggest instead that a high-velocityencounter with a galaxy group is responsible for dispersing and increasing theentropy of the gas in this non-cool-core cluster. we see no evidence forshocks, or established isobaric gas motions (sloshing), but there is muchsub-structure associated with a dynamically active central region thatencompasses the brightest radio emission. gas heating is evident in directionsperpendicular to the inferred line of encounter between the infalling group andcluster. the radio-emitting tendrils run along boundaries between gas ofdifferent temperature, apparently lubricating the gas flows and inhibiting heattransfer. the first stages of the encounter may have helped trigger the radiogalaxies into their current phase of activity, where we see x-rays from thenuclei, jets, and hotspots.

1312.5618	probing the accelerating universe with radio weak lensing in the jvla  sky survey	we outline the prospects for performing pioneering radio weak gravitationallensing analyses using observations from a potential forthcoming jvla skysurvey program. a large-scale survey with the jvla can offer interesting andunique opportunities for performing weak lensing studies in the radio band, afield which has until now been the preserve of optical telescopes. inparticular, the jvla has the capacity for large, deep radio surveys withrelatively high angular resolution, which are the key characteristics requiredfor a successful weak lensing study. we highlight the potential advantages andunique aspects of performing weak lensing in the radio band. in particular, theinclusion of continuum polarisation information can greatly reduce noise inweak lensing reconstructions and can also remove the effects of intrinsicgalaxy alignments, the key astrophysical systematic effect that limits weaklensing at all wavelengths. we identify a vlass "deep fields" program (totalarea ~10-20 square degs), to be conducted at l-band and with high-resolution(a-array configuration), as the optimal survey strategy from the point of viewof weak lensing science. such a survey will build on the unique strengths ofthe jvla and will remain unsurpassed in terms of its combination of resolutionand sensitivity until the advent of the square kilometre array. we identify thebest fields on the jvla-accessible sky from the point of view of overlappingwith existing deep optical and near infra-red data which will provide crucialredshift information and facilitate a host of additional compellingmulti-wavelength science.

0802.4297	an xmm-newton study of the environments, particle content and impact of  low-power radio galaxies	we present a detailed study of the environments of a sample of nine low-powerradio galaxies, based on new and archival xmm-newton observations. we reportnew detections of group-scale environments around three radio galaxies, 3c 296,ngc 1044 and 3c 76.1. as with previous studies, we find that fr-i radiogalaxies inhabit group environments ranging over nearly two orders of magnitudein bolometric x-ray luminosity, but find no evidence for a tight relationshipbetween large-scale x-ray environment and radio-source properties such as size,radio luminosity, and axial ratio. we confirm earlier work showing thatequipartition internal pressures are typically lower than the externalpressures acting on the radio lobes, so that additional non-radiating particlesmust be present or the lobes must be magnetically dominated. we present thefirst direct observational evidence that entrainment may provide this missingpressure, in the form of a relationship between radio-source structure andapparent pressure imbalance. finally, our study provides further support forthe presence of an apparent temperature excess in radio-loud groups compared tothe group population as a whole. for five of eight temperature excesses, theenergy required to inflate the radio lobes is comparable to the energy requiredto produce this excess by heating of the group gas; however, in three cases thecurrent radio source appears too weak to produce the temperature excess. itremains unclear whether the temperature excess can be directly associated withthe current phase of agn activity, or whether it is instead either a signatureof previous agn activity or simply an indicator of the particular set of groupproperties most conducive to the growth of an fr-i radio galaxy.

0803.3595	evidence for non-hydrostatic gas motions in the hot ism of centaurus a	we present preliminary results from a deep (600 ks) {\em chandra} observationof the hot interstellar medium of the nearby early-type galaxy centaurus a (cena). we find a surface brightness discontinuity in the gas $\sim$3.5 kpc fromthe nucleus spanning a 120$^\circ$ arc. the temperature of the gas is0.60$\pm$0.05 and 0.68$\pm$0.10 kev, interior and exterior to thediscontinuity, respectively. the elemental abundance is poorly constrained bythe spectral fits, but if the abundance is constant across the discontinuity,there is a factor of 2.3$\pm$0.4 pressure jump across the discontinuity. thiswould imply that the gas is moving at 470$\pm$100 km s$^{-1}$, or mach1.0$\pm$0.2 (1.2$\pm$0.2) relative to the sound speed of the gas external(internal) to the discontinuity. alternatively, pressure balance could bemaintained if there is a large (factor of $\sim$7) discontinuity in theelemental abundance. we suggest that the observed discontinuity is the resultof non-hydrostatic motion of the gas core (i.e. sloshing) due to the recentmerger. in this situation, both gas motions and abundance gradients areimportant in the visibility of the discontinuity. cen a is in the late stagesof merging with a small late-type galaxy, and a large discontinuity in densityand abundance across a short distance demonstrates that the gas of the twogalaxies remains poorly mixed even several hundred million years after themerger. the pressure discontinuity may have had a profound influence on thetemporal evolution of the kpc-scale jet. the jet could have decollimatedcrossing the discontinuity and thereby forming the northeast radio lobe.

astro-ph;0201223	constraints in cosmological parameter space from the sunyaev-zel'dovich  effect and thermal bremsstrahlung	we discuss how the space of possible cosmological parameters is constrainedby the angular diameter distance function, d_a(z), as measured using thesz/x-ray method which combines sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect and x-raybrightness data for clusters of galaxies. new x-ray satellites, andground-based interferometers dedicated to sz observations, should soon lead tod_a(z) measurements limited by systematic rather than random error. we analyzethe systematic and random error budgets to make a realistic estimate of theaccuracy achievable in the determination of (omega_m,lambda,h), the densityparameters of matter and cosmological constant, and the dimensionless hubbleconstant, using d_a(z) derived from the sz/x-ray method, and the position ofthe first ``doppler'' peak in the cosmic microwave background fluctuations. webriefly study the effect of systematic errors. we find that omega_m, lambda,and w are affected, but h is not by systematic errors which grow with redshift.with as few as 70 clusters, each providing a measurement of d_a(z) with a 7%random and 5% systematic error, omega_m can be constrained to +/-0.2, lambda to+/-0.2, and h to +/-0.11 (all at 3 sigma). we also estimate constraints for thealternative three-parameter set (omega_m,w,h), where w is the equation of stateparameter. the measurement of d_a(z) provides constraints complementary tothose from the number density of clusters in redshift space. a sample of 70clusters (d_a measured with the same accuracy as before) combined with clusterevolution results (or a known matter density), can constrain w within +/-0.45(at 3 sigma). studies of x-ray and sz properties of clusters of galaxiespromise an independent and powerful test for cosmological parameters.

astro-ph;0203374	a chandra observation of the x-ray environment and jet of 3c31	we have used a deep chandra observation of the central regions of thetwin-jet fri radio galaxy 3c31 to resolve the thermal x-ray emission in thecentral few kiloparsecs of the host galaxy, ngc 383, where the jets are thoughtto be decelerating rapidly. this allows us to make high-precision measurementsof the density, temperature and pressure distributions in this region, and toshow that the x-ray emitting gas in the centre of the galaxy has a cooling timeof only 5 times 10^7 years. in a companion paper these measurements are used toplace constraints on models of the jet dynamics.  a previously unknown one-sided x-ray jet in 3c31, extending up to 8 arcsecfrom the nucleus, is detected and resolved. its structure and steep x-rayspectrum are similar to those of x-ray jets known in other fri sources, and weattribute the radiation to synchrotron emission from a high-energy populationof electrons. in situ particle acceleration is required in the region of thejet where bulk deceleration is taking place.  we also present x-ray spectra and luminosities of the galaxies in the arp 331chain of which ngc 383 is a member. the spectrum and spatial properties of thenearby bright x-ray source 1e 0104+3153 are used to argue that the soft x-rayemission is mostly due to a foreground group of galaxies rather than to thebackground broad absorption-line quasar.

astro-ph;0204509	the x-ray jet and halo of pks 0521-365	chandra acis observations of pks 0521-365 find that the x-ray emission ofthis bl lac object consists of emission from an unresolved core, a diffusehalo, and a 2 arcsec jet feature coincident with the inner radio/optical jet. acomparison with a new atca 8.6-ghz map also finds x-ray emission from thebright hotspot south-east of the nucleus. the jet spectrum, from radio tox-ray, is probably synchrotron emission from an electron population with abroken power-law energy distribution, and resembles the spectra seen from thejets of low-power (fr i) radio galaxies. the hotspot x-ray flux is consistentwith the expectations of synchrotron self-compton emission from a plasma closeto equipartition, as seen in studies of high-power (fr ii) radio galaxies.while the angular structure of the halo is similar to that found by an analysisof the rosat hri image, its brightness is seen to be lower with chandra, andthe halo is best interpreted as thermal emission from an atmosphere of similarluminosity to the halos around fr i radio galaxies. the x-ray properties of pks0521-365 are consistent with it being a foreshortened, beamed, radio galaxy.

astro-ph;0208204	magnetic field strengths in the hotspots and lobes of three powerful  frii radio sources	we have made deep chandra observations of three powerful frii radio sources:two quasars (3c263 and 3c351) and one radio galaxy (3c330). x-ray emission fromhotspots and lobes, as well as from the active nucleus, is detected in eachsource.  we model the hotspots' synchrotron spectra using vla, bima and hst data. in3c263 and 3c330, the hotspots' x-ray emission is at a level consistent withbeing synchrotron self-compton (ssc) emission, with a hotspot magnetic fieldclose to the equipartition value. in the two hotspots of 3c351, however, an sscorigin for the x-rays would require the magnetic field strength to be an orderof magnitude below the equipartition value in our models: in addition, thereare offsets between the radio, optical and x-ray emission from the secondaryhotspot which are hard to explain in a simple ssc model. we discuss theemission mechanisms that may be responsible for these observations.  on our preferred model, the x-ray emission from the radio lobes of the threesources is due to inverse-compton scattering of the microwave backgroundradiation. if this is the case, the magnetic field strengths in the lobes aretypically about a factor 2 below the equipartition values, assuming uniformlobe electron and magnetic field distributions.  we detect extended x-ray emission, which we attribute to a cluster/groupenvironment, around 3c263 and 3c330. this detection allows us to show that thelobes are close to pressure balance with their surroundings, as long as nonon-radiating particles contribute to the internal pressure of the lobes.

astro-ph;0208509	the origin of radio haloes and non-thermal emission in clusters of  galaxies	we study the origin of the non-thermal emission from the intracluster medium,including the excess hard x-ray emission and cluster-wide radio haloes, throughfitting two representative models to the coma cluster. if the synchrotronemitting relativistic electrons are accelerated in situ from the vast pool ofthermal electrons, then a quasi-stationary solution of the kinetic equationwith particle acceleration through turbulence at high energies (&gt;200 kev)naturally produces a population of supra-thermal electrons responsible for theexcess hard x-ray emission through bremsstrahlung. inverse compton scatteringis negligible at hard x-ray energies in this case. the radio halo flux densityconstrains the magnetic field strength to a value close to that ofequipartition ~1 ug. alternatively, if the relativistic electrons are injectedfrom numerous localised `external' sources then the hard x-rays are bestexplained by inverse compton scattering from gev electrons, and little of thehard x-radiation has a bremsstrahlung origin. in this case, the magnetic fieldstrength is constrained to ~0.1-0.2 ug. both models assume that the non-thermalemissions are generated by a single electron spectrum, so that only two freeparameters, well constrained by the observed hard x-ray and radio halo spectra,are needed in either case. measurements of the cluster magnetic field willdistinguish between the models.

astro-ph;0209099	unifying b2 radio galaxies with bl lac objects	in an earlier paper we presented nuclear x-ray flux densities, measured withrosat, for the b2 bright sample of nearby low-luminosity radio galaxies. inthis paper we construct a nuclear x-ray luminosity function for the b2 radiogalaxies, and discuss the consequences of our results for models in which suchradio galaxies are the parent population of bl lac objects. based on ourobservations of the b2 sample, we use monte carlo techniques to simulatesamples of beamed radio galaxies, and use the selection criteria of existingsamples of bl lac objects to compare our simulated results to what is observed.we find that previous analytical results are not applicable since the bl lacsamples are selected on beamed flux density. a simple model in which bl lacsare the moderately beamed (gamma ~ 3) counterparts of radio galaxies, with somerandom dispersion (~ 0.4 decades) in the intrinsic radio-x-ray relationship,can reproduce many of the features of the radio-selected and x-ray-selected bllac samples, including their radio and x-ray luminosity functions and thedistributions of their radio-to-x-ray spectral indices. in contrast, models inwhich the x-ray and radio emission have systematically different beamingparameters cannot reproduce important features of the radio-galaxy and bl lacpopulations. the redshift distribution and number counts of the x-ray-selectedemss sample are well reproduced by our best models, supporting a picture inwhich these objects are beamed fri radio galaxies with intrinsic luminositiessimilar to those of the b2 sample. however, we cannot match the redshiftdistribution of the radio-selected 1-jy sample, and it is likely that apopulation of frii radio galaxies is responsible for the high-redshift objectsin this sample.

astro-ph;0309150	xmm-newton observations of the hot-gas atmospheres of 3c 66b and 3c 449	we present new xmm-newton observations of the hot-gas environments of twolow-power twin-jet radio galaxies, 3c 66b and 3c 449, showing direct evidencefor the interactions between x-ray-emitting gas and radio plasma that arethought to determine the large-scale radio structure of these sources. thetemperatures that we measure for the two environments are significantly higherthan those predicted by standard luminosity-temperature relations for clustersand groups. we show that luminosity-temperature relations for radio-quiet andradio-loud x-ray groups differ, in the sense that radio-source heating mayoperate in most groups containing radio galaxies. if the radio lobes areexpanding subsonically, we find minimum ages of 3e8 years for 3c 66b, and 5e8years for 3c 449, older than the values obtained from spectral ageing, whichwould give the radio source sufficient time to heat the groups to the observedtemperatures for plausible values of the jet power. the external pressures inthe atmospheres of both radio galaxies are an order of magnitude higher thanequipartition estimates of their radio-lobe pressures, confirming that theradio lobes are either out of equipartition or require a pressure contributionfrom non-radiating particles. constraints from the level of x-ray emission wemeasure from the radio lobes allow us to conclude that a departure fromequipartition must be in the direction of magnetic domination, and that themost plausible candidates for a particle contribution to lobe pressure arerelativistic protons, an additional population of low-energy electrons, orentrained and heated thermal material.

astro-ph;0409566	a chandra survey of quasar jets: first results	we present results from chandra x-ray imaging and spectroscopy of aflux-limited sample of flat spectrum radio-emitting quasars with jet-likeextended structure. twelve of twenty quasar jets are detected in 5 ks acis-sexposures. the quasars without x-ray jets are not significantly different fromthose in the sample with detected jets except that the extended radio emissionis generally fainter. new radio maps are combined with the x-ray images inorder to elucidate the relation between radio and x-ray emission in spatiallyresolved structures. we find a variety of morphologies, including long straightjets and bends up to 90 degrees. all x-ray jets are one-sided although theradio images used for source selection often show lobes opposite the x-rayjets. the fr ii x-ray jets can all be interpreted as inverse compton scatteringof cosmic microwave background photons by electrons in large-scale relativisticjets although deeper observations are required to test this interpretation indetail. applying this interpretation to the jets as a population, we find thatthe jets would be aligned to within 30 degrees of the line of sight generally,assuming that the bulk lorentz factor of the jets is 10.

astro-ph;0411413	evidence for radio-source heating of groups	we report evidence that the gas properties of x-ray groups containing radiogalaxies differ from those of radio-quiet groups. for a well-studied sample ofrosat-observed groups, we found that more than half of the elliptical-dominatedgroups can be considered ``radio-loud'', and that radio-loud groups are likelyto be hotter at a given x-ray luminosity than radio-quiet groups. we testedthree different models for the origin of the effect and conclude thatradio-source heating is the most likely explanation. we found several examplesof groups where there is strong evidence from chandra or xmm-newton images forinteractions between the radio source and the group gas. a variety ofradio-source heating processes are important, including shock-heating by youngsources and gentler heating by larger sources. the heating effects can belonger-lasting than the radio emission. we show that the sample of x-ray groupsused in our study is not significantly biased in the fraction of radio-loudgroups that it contains. this allows us to conclude that the energy perparticle that low-power radio galaxies can inject over the group lifetime iscomparable to the requirements of structure formation models.

astro-ph;0411804	continuing a chandra survey of quasar radio jets	we are conducting an x-ray survey of flat spectrum radio quasars (fsrqs) withextended radio structures. we summarize our results from the first stage of oursurvey, then we present findings from its continuation.  we have discovered jet x-ray emission from 12 of our first 20 chandratargets, establishing that strong 0.5-7.0 kev emission is a common feature offsrq jets. the x-ray morphology is varied, but in general closely matches theradio structure until the first sharp radio bend. in the sources with opticaldata as well as x-ray detections we rule out simple synchrotron models forx-ray emission, suggesting these systems may instead be dominated by inversecompton (ic) scattering. fitting models of ic scattering of cosmic microwavebackground photons suggests that these jets are aligned within a few degrees ofour line of sight, with bulk lorentz factors of a few to ten and magneticfields a bit stronger than $10^{-5}$ g.  in the weeks prior to this meeting, we have discovered two new x-ray jets at$z &gt; 1$. one (pks b1055+201) has a dramatic, $20''$-long jet. the other (pksb1421-490) appears unremarkable at radio frequencies, but at higher frequenciesthe jet is uniquely powerful: its optically-dominated, with jet/core fluxratios of 3.7 at 1 kev and 380 at 480 nm.

astro-ph;0503203	an x-ray study of magnetic field strengths and particle content in frii  radio sources	we present a chandra and xmm-newton study of x-ray emission from the lobes of33 classical double radio galaxies and quasars. we report new detections oflobe-related x-ray emission in 11 sources. together with previous detections wefind that x-ray emission is detected from at least one radio lobe in ~75percent of the sample. for all of the lobe detections, we find that themeasured x-ray flux can be attributed to inverse-compton scattering of thecosmic microwave background radiation, with magnetic field strengths in thelobes between (0.3 - 1.3) b_eq, where the value b_eq corresponds toequipartition between the electrons and magnetic field assuming a fillingfactor of unity. there is a strong peak in the magnetic field strengthdistribution at b ~ 0.7 b_eq. we find that &gt; 70 percent of the radio lobes areeither at equipartition or electron dominated by a small factor. thedistribution of measured magnetic field strengths differs for narrow-line andbroad-line objects, in the sense that broad-line radio galaxies and quasarsappear to be further from equipartition; however, this is likely to be due to acombination of projection effects and worse systematic uncertainty in the x-rayanalysis for those objects. our results suggest that the lobes of classicaldouble radio sources do not contain an energetically dominant protonpopulation, because this would require the magnetic field energy density to besimilar to the electron energy density rather than the overall energy densityin relativistic particles.

astro-ph;0601632	observations of magnetic fields and relativistic beaming in four quasar  jets	we discuss the physical properties of four quasar jets imaged with thechandra x-ray observatory in the course of a survey for x-ray emission fromradio jets. these objects have sufficient counts to study their spatiallyresolved properties, even in the 5 ks survey observations. we have acquiredaustralia telescope compact array data with resolution matching chandra. wehave searched for optical emission with magellan, with sub-arcsecondresolution. the radio to x-ray spectral energy distribution for most of theindividual regions indicates against synchrotron radiation from asingle-component electron spectrum. we therefore explore the consequences ofassuming that the x-ray emission is the result of inverse compton scattering onthe cosmic microwave background. if particles and magnetic fields are nearminimum energy density in the jet rest frames, then the emitting regions mustbe relativistically beamed, even at distances of order 500 kpc from the quasar.we estimate the magnetic field strengths, relativistic doppler factors, andkinetic energy flux as a function of distance from the quasar core for two orthree distinct regions along each jet. we develop, for the first time,estimates in the uncertainties in these parameters, recognizing that they aredominated by our assumptions in applying the standard synchrotron minimumenergy conditions. the kinetic power is comparable with, or exceeds, the quasarradiative luminosity, implying that the jets are a significant factor in theenergetics of the accretion process powering the central black hole. themeasured radiative efficiencies of the jets are of order 10^(-4).

astro-ph;0610120	in-situ acceleration of subrelativistic electrons in the coma halo and  the halo's influence on the sunyaev-zeldovich effect	the stochastic acceleration of subrelativistic electrons from a backgroundplasma is studied in order to find a possible explanation of the hard x-ray(hxr) emission detected from the coma cluster. we calculate the necessaryenergy supply as a function of the plasma temperature and of the electronenergy. we show that, for the same value of the hxr flux, the energy supplychanges gradually from its high value (when emitting particle are non-thermal)to lower values (when the electrons are thermal). the kinetic equations we useinclude terms describing particle thermalization as well as momentum diffusiondue to the fermi ii acceleration. we show that the temporal evolution of theparticle distribution function has, at its final stationary stage, a ratherspecific form: it cannot be described by simple exponential or power-lawexpressions. a broad transfer region is formed by coulomb collisions atenergies between the maxwellian and power-law parts of the distributionfunction. in this region the radiative lifetime of a single electron differsgreatly from the lifetime of the distribution function as a whole. for a plasmatemperature of 8 kev, the particles emitting bremsstrahlung at 20-80 kev lie inthis quasi-thermal regime. we show that the energy supply required byquasi-thermal electrons to produce the observed hxr flux from coma is one ortwo orders of magnitude smaller than the value derived from the assumption of anonthermal origin of the emitting particles. this result may solve the problemof rapid cluster overheating by nonthermal electrons. we finally predict thechange in coma's sz effect caused by the distortions of the maxwellian electronspectrum, and we show that evidence for acceleration of subrelativisticelectrons can be derived from detailed spectral measurements.

astro-ph;0611069	the structure of the jet in 3c 15 from multi-band polarimetry	we investigate the structure of the kpc-scale jet in the nearby (z = 0.073)radio galaxy 3c 15, using new optical hubble space telescope (hst) acs/f606wpolarimetry together with archival multi-band hst imaging, chandra x-ray dataand 8.4 ghz vla radio polarimetry. the new data confirm that synchrotronradiation dominates in the optical. with matched beams, the jet is generallynarrower in the optical than in the radio, suggesting a stratified flow. weexamine a simple two-component model comprising a highly relativistic spine andlower-velocity sheath. this configuration is broadly consistent withpolarization angle differences seen in the optical and radio data. the base ofthe jet is relatively brighter in the ultraviolet and x-ray than at lowerenergies, and the radio and optical polarization angles vary significantly asthe jet brightens downstream. further out, the x-ray intensity rises again andthe apparent magnetic field becomes simpler, indicating a strong shock.modelling the synchrotron spectrum of this brightest x-ray knot provides anestimate of its minimum internal pressure, and a comparison with the thermalpressure from x-ray emitting gas shows that the knot is overpressured andlikely to be a temporary, expanding feature.

astro-ph;0701458	a radio through x-ray study of the hot spots, active nucleus, and  environment of the nearby fr ii radio galaxy 3c 33	we present results from {\em chandra}/acis-s, {\em spitzer}, {\emxmm-newton}, {\em hst}, and vla observations of the radio hot spots, extendedenvironment, and nucleus of the nearby ($z$=0.0597) fr ii radio galaxy 3c 33.this is a relatively low-power fr ii radio galaxy, and so we expect, {\it apriori}, to detect a significant x-ray synchrotron component to the emissionfrom the hot spots. we detect x-ray emission coincident with the two knots ofpolarized optical emission from the southern hot spot (shs), as well as alongthe northwest arm of this hot spot. we also detect x-ray emission from twocompact regions of the northern hot spot (nhs), as well as diffuse emissionbehind the radio peak. the x-ray flux density of the region at the tip of thesouthern hot spot, the most compact radio feature of the southern lobe, isconsistent with the synchrotron self-compton (ssc) process. the x-ray fluxdensities of the other three regions of the shs and the two compact regions ofthe nhs are an order of magnitude or more above the predictions from either thessc and inverse-compton scattering of the cmb (ic/cmb) mechanisms, thusstrongly disfavoring these scenarios unless they are far from equipartition($b$ $\sim$4-14 times smaller than the equipartition values). the x-ray fluxfrom the diffuse region behind the nhs is consistent with the ic/cmb predictionassuming a small departure from equipartition. we conclude that the x-rayemission is synchrotron emission from multiple populations of ultrarelativisticelectrons unless these regions are far from equipartition. there must thereforebe unresolved substructure within each knot, similar to that which is found inchandra observations of nearby fr i jets such as centaurus a and 3c 66b.

astro-ph;0702411	the effect of a chandra-measured merger-related gas component on the  lobes of a dead radio galaxy	we use chandra data to infer that an x-ray bright component of gas is in theprocess of separating the radio lobes of 3c 442a. this is the first radiogalaxy with convincing evidence that central gas, overpressured with respect tothe lobe plasma and not simply a static atmosphere, is having a major dynamicaleffect on the radio structure. we speculate that the expansion of the gas alsore-excites electrons in the lobes of 3c 442a through compression and adiabaticheating. two features of 3c 442a contribute to its dynamical state. firstly,the radio source is no longer being powered by a detected active jet, so thatthe dynamical state of the radio plasma is at the mercy of the ambient medium.secondly the two early-type galaxies, ngc 7236 and ngc 7237, one of which wasthe original host of 3c 442a, are undergoing a merger and have alreadyexperienced a close encounter, suggesting that the x-ray bright gas is mostlythe heated combined galaxy atmospheres. the lobes have been swept apart forabout 10^8 yrs by the pressure-driven expansion of the x-ray bright inner gas.

astro-ph;0703080	the interaction between radio lobes and hot gas in the nearby radio  galaxies 3c285 and 3c442a	we present chandra observations of two nearby radio galaxies in groupenvironments, 3c285 and 3c442a. the host galaxies of both sources are involvedin mergers with nearby massive galaxies, and the hot gas in the systems isextended along lines joining the interacting galaxies. both sources show strongevidence for interactions between the radio lobes and the asymmetrical hot gas.we argue that the structure in the hot gas is independent of the existence ofthe radio lobes in these systems, and argue that hot gas shaped by an ongoingmassive galaxy merger may play an important role in the dynamics of radio lobesin other objects. for 3c442a, our observations show that gas is being drivenout of both members of the host interacting galaxy pair, and the impliedconstraints on galaxy velocities are consistent with mildly supersonic motionswith respect to the group-scale hot gas. the previously known filamentary radiostructure in the center of 3c442a may be a result of the interaction betweenhot gas expelled from these galaxies and pre-existing radio-emitting plasma. in3c285, where there is no ongoing galaxy merger, the powerful radio source isprobably having a significant effect on the energetics of the host group.

astro-ph;9602027	a possible mechanism for wiggling protostellar jets from 3d simulations  in a stratified ambient medium	most collimated supersonic protostellar jets show a collimated wiggling, andknotty structure (e.g., the haro 6-5b jet) and frequently reveal a long gapbetween this structure and the terminal bow shock. in a few cases, there is noevidence of such a terminal feature. we present three-dimensional smoothedparticle hydrodynamical simulations which suggest that this morphology may bedue to the interaction of the propagating cooling jet with a non-homogeneousambient medium. in regions where the ambient gas has an increasing density (andpressure) gradient, we find that it tends to compress the cold, low-pressurecocoon of shocked material that surrounds the beam, destroy the bow shock-likestructure at the head, and enhance beam focusing, wiggling, and internaltraveling shocks. in ambient regions of decreasing density (and pressure), theflow widens and relaxes, becoming very faint. this could explain ``invisible''segments in systems like the haro 6-5b jet. the bow shock in these cases couldbe a relic of an earlier outflow episode, as previously suggested, or the placewhere the jet reappears after striking a denser portion of the ambient medium.

astro-ph;9903444	inverse compton scattering in mildly relativistic plasma	we investigated the effect of inverse compton scattering in mildlyrelativistic static and moving plasmas with low optical depth using monte carlosimulations, and calculated the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect in the cosmicbackground radiation. our semi-analytic method is based on a separation ofphoton diffusion in frequency and real space. we use monte carlo simulation toderive the intensity and frequency of the scattered photons for a monochromaticincoming radiation. the outgoing spectrum is determined by integrating over thespectrum of the incoming radiation using the intensity to determine the correctweight. this method makes it possible to study the emerging radiation as afunction of frequency and direction. as a first application we have studied theeffects of finite optical depth and gas infall on the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect(not possible with the extended kompaneets equation) and discuss the parameterrange in which the boltzmann equation and its expansions can be used. for hightemperature clusters ($k_b t_e \gtrsim 15$ kev) relativistic corrections basedon a fifth order expansion of the extended kompaneets equation seriouslyunderestimate the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect at high frequencies. thecontribution from plasma infall is less important for reasonable velocities. wegive a convenient analytical expression for the dependence of the cross-overfrequency on temperature, optical depth, and gas infall speed. optical deptheffects are often more important than relativistic corrections, and should betaken into account for high-precision work, but are smaller than the typicalkinematic effect from cluster radial velocities.

astro-ph;9910141	x-ray-emitting atmospheres of b2 radio galaxies	we report rosat pspc spatial and spectral analysis of the eight b2 radiogalaxies ngc 315, ngc 326, 4c 35.03, b2 0326+39, ngc 2484, b2 1040+31, b21855+37, and 3c 449, expected to be representative of the class of low-powerradio galaxies. multiple x-ray components are present in each, and the gascomponents have a wide range of linear sizes and follow an extrapolation of thecluster x-ray luminosity/temperature correlation, implying that there is norelationship between the presence of a radio galaxy and the gas fraction of theenvironment. no large-scale cooling flows are found. there is no correlation ofradio-galaxy size with the scale or density of the x-ray atmosphere. thissuggests that it is processes on scales less than those of the overall gaseousenvironments which are the major influence on radio-source dynamics. theintergalactic medium is usually sufficient to confine the outer parts of theradio structures, in some cases even to within 5 kpc of the core. in the caseof ngc 315, an extrapolation suggests that the pressure of the atmosphere maymatch the minimum pressure in the radio source over a factor of about 40 inlinear size (a factor of about 1600 in pressure).
