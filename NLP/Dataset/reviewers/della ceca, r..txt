0905.1041	a suzaku observation of the ulirg iras19254-7245: disclosing the agn  component	we discuss here a long suzaku observation of iras 19254-7245 (also known asthe superantennae), one of the brightest and well studied ultra luminousinfrared galaxies in the local universe. this long observation provided thefirst detection of iras 19254-7245 above 10 kev, and measured a 15-30 kev fluxof ~5x10^(-12) erg cm^-2 s^-1. the detection above 10 kev has allowed us tounveil, for the first time, the intrinsic luminosity of the agn hosted in iras19254-7245, which is strongly absorbed (nh ~ 3x10^(24) cm^-2) and has anintrinsic luminosity in the qso regime (l(2-10 kev) ~ 3 x 10^(44) erg s^-1).the 2-10 kev spectrum of iras 19254-7245 is remarkably hard (gamma~1.2), andpresents a strong iron line (ew ~0.7 kev), clearly suggesting that below 10 kevwe are seeing only reprocessed radiation. since the energy of the fe k emissionis found to be at ~6.7 kev, consistent with he-like fe, and its ew is too highto be explained in a starburst dominated scenario, we suggest that the 2--10kev emission of iras 19254-7245 is dominated by reflection/scattering fromhighly ionized matter. indeed, within this latter scenario we found that thephoton index of the illuminating source is gamma=1.87 (+0.11,-0.28), inexcellent agreement with the mean value found for radio quiet unobscured agn.

0912.0001	chasing the heaviest black holes of jetted active galactic nuclei	we investigate the physical properties of the 10 blazars at redshift greaterthan 2 detected in the 3-years all sky survey performed by the burst alerttelescope (bat) onboard the swift satellite. we find that the jets of theseblazars are among the most powerful known. furthermore, the mass of theircentral black hole, inferred from the optical-uv bump, exceeds a few billionsof solar masses, with accretion luminosities being a large fraction of theeddington one. we compare their properties with those of the brightest blazarsof the 3-months survey performed by the large area telescope (lat) onboard thefermi satellite. we find that the bat blazars have more powerful jets, moreluminous accretion disks and larger black hole masses than lat blazars. thesefindings can be simply understood on the basis of the blazar sequence, thatsuggests that the most powerful blazars have a spectral energy distributionwith a high energy peak at mev (or even sub-mev) energies. this implies thatthe most extreme blazars can be found more efficiently in hard x-rays, ratherthan in the high energy gamma-ray band. we then discuss the implications of ourfindings for future missions, such as the new hard x-ray mission (nhxm) andespecially the energetic x-ray imaging survey telescope (exist) mission which,during its planned 2 years all sky survey, is expected to detect thousands ofblazars, with a few of them at z greater than 6.

1010.2085	suzaku and swift-bat observations of a newly discovered compton-thick  agn	obscured agn are fundamental to understand the history of super massive blackhole growth and their influence on galaxy formation. however, the compton-thickagn (nh&gt;1e24 cm^-2) population is basically unconstrained, with less than fewdozen confirmed compton-thick agn found and studied so far. a way to selectheavily obscured agn is to compare the x-ray emission below 10 kev (which isstrongly depressed) with the emission from other bands less affected by theabsorption, i.e. the ir band. to this end, we have cross-correlated the 2xmmcatalogue with the iras point source catalogue and, by using the x-ray toinfrared flux ratio and x-ray colors, we selected a well defined sample ofcompton-thick agn candidates at z&lt;0.1. the aim of this work is to confirm thenature and to study one of these local compton-thick agn candidates, the nearby(z=0.029) seyfert 2 galaxy iras 04507+0358, by constraining the amount ofintrinsic absorption (nh) and thus the intrinsic luminosity. to this end weobtained deep (100 ks) suzaku observations (ao4 call) and performed a joint fitwith swift-bat data. we analyzed xmm-newton, suzaku and swift-bat data and wepresent here the results of this broad-band (0.4-100 kev) spectral analysis. wefound that the broad-band x-ray emission of iras 04507+0358 requires a largeamount of absorption (larger than 1e24 cm^-2) to be well reproduced, thusconfirming the compton-thick nature of this source. in particular, the mostprobable scenario is that of a mildly (nh (1.3-1.5)x1e24 cm^-2, l(2-10 kev)(5-7)x1e43 erg s^-1) compton-thick agn.

1012.1727	cross-correlation of the 2xmmi catalogue with data release 7 of the  sloan digital sky survey	the survey science centre of the xmm-newton satellite released the firstincremental version of the 2xmm catalogue in august 2008 . with more than220,000 x-ray sources, the 2xmmi was at that time the largest catalogue ofx-ray sources ever published and thus constitutes an unprecedented resource forstudying the high-energy properties of various classes of x-ray emitters suchas agn and stars. the advent of the 7th release of the sloan digital sky surveyoffers the opportunity to cross-match two major surveys and extend the spectralenergy distribution of many 2xmmi sources towards the optical bands. we herepresent a cross-matching algorithm based on the classical likelihood ratioestimator. the method developed has the advantage of providing trueprobabilities of identifications without resorting to monte-carlo simulations.over 30,000 2xmmi sources have sdss counterparts with individual probabilitiesof identification higher than 90%. using spectroscopic identifications from thesdss dr7 catalogue supplemented by extraction from other catalogues, we buildan identified sample from which the way the various classes of x-ray emittersgather in the multi dimensional parameter space can be analysed. we investigatetwo scientific use cases. in the first example we show how thesemulti-wavelength data can be used to search for new qso2s. although no specificrange of observed properties allows us to identify compton thick qso2s, we showthat the prospects are much better for compton thin agn2 and discuss severalpossible multi-parameter selection strategies. in a second example, we confirmthe hardening of the mean x-ray spectrum with increasing x-ray luminosity on asample of over 500 x-ray active stars and reveal that on average x-ray active mstars display bluer $g-r$ colour indexes than less active ones (abridged).

1104.2173	the x-ray spectral properties of the agn population in the xmm-newton  bright serendipitous survey	we present here a detailed x-ray spectral analysis of the agn belonging tothe xmm-newton bright survey (xbs) that comprises more than 300 agn up toredshift ~ 2.4. we performed an x-ray analysis following two differentapproaches: by analyzing individually each agn x-ray spectrum and byconstructing average spectra for different agn types. from the individualanalysis, we find that there seems to be an anti correlation between thespectral index and the sources' hard x-ray luminosity, such that the averagephoton index for the higher luminosity sources (&gt; 10e44 erg/s) is significantlyflatter than the average for the lower luminosity sources. we also find thatthe intrinsic column density distribution agrees with agn unified schemes,although a number of exceptions are found (3% of the whole sample), which aremuch more common among optically classified type 2 agn. we also find that theso-called "soft-excess", apart from the intrinsic absorption, constitutes theprincipal deviation from a power-law shape in agn x-ray spectra and it clearlydisplays different characteristics, and likely a different origin, forunabsorbed and absorbed agn. regarding the shape of the average spectra, wefind that it is best reproduced by a combination of an unabsorbed (absorbed)power law, a narrow fe kalpha emission line and a small (large) amount ofreflection for unabsorbed (absorbed) sources. we do not significantly detectany relativistic contribution to the line emission and we compute an upperlimit for its equivalent width (ew) of 230 ev at the 3 sigma confidence level.finally, by dividing the type 1 agn sample into high- and low-luminositysources, we marginally detect a decrease in the narrow fe kalpha line ew and inthe amount of reflection as the luminosity increases, the "so-called"iwasawa-taniguchi effect.

0710.0402	the xmm-newton serendipitous survey v. optical identification of the  xmm-newton medium sensitivity survey (xms)	we present the xmm-newton medium sensitivity survey (xms), including a totalof 318 x-ray sources found among the serendipitous content of 25 xmm-newtontarget fields. the xms comprises four largely overlapping source samplesselected at soft (0.5-2 kev), intermediate (0.5-4.5 kev), hard (2-10 kev) andultra-hard (4.5-7.5 kev) bands, the first three of them being flux-limited. wereport on the optical identification of the xms samples, complete to 85-95%. atthe intermediate flux levels sampled by the xms we find that the x-ray sky islargely dominated by active galactic nuclei. the fraction of stars in softx-ray selected samples is below 10%, and only a few per cent for hard selectedsamples. we find that the fraction of optically obscured objects in the agnpopulation stays constant at around 15-20% for soft and intermediate bandselected x-ray sources, over 2 decades of flux. the fraction of obscuredobjects amongst the agn population is larger (~35-45%) in the hard orultra-hard selected samples, and constant across a similarly wide flux range.the distribution in x-ray-to-optical flux ratio is a strong function of theselection band, with a larger fraction of sources with high values in hardselected samples. sources with x-ray-to-optical flux ratios in excess of 10 aredominated by obscured agn, but with a significant contribution from unobscuredagn.

0704.2971	the xmm-ssc survey of hard-spectrum xmm-newton sources 1: optically  bright sources	we present optical and x-ray data for a sample of serendipitous xmm-newtonsources that are selected to have 0.5-2 kev vs 2-4.5 kev x-ray hardness ratioswhich are harder than the x-ray background. the sources have 2-4.5 kev x-rayflux &gt;= 10^-14 cgs, and in this paper we examine a subsample of 42 opticallybright (r &lt; 21) sources; this subsample is 100 per cent spectroscopicallyidentified. all but one of the optical counterparts are extragalactic, and weargue that the single exception, a galactic m star, is probably a coincidentalassociation. the x-ray spectra are consistent with heavily absorbed power laws(21.8 &lt; log nh &lt; 23.4), and all of them appear to be absorbed agn. the majorityof the sources show only narrow emission lines in their optical spectra,implying that they are type-2 agn. only a small fraction of the sources (7/42)show broad optical emission lines, and all of these have nh &lt; 10^23 cm^-2. thisimplies that ratios of x-ray absorption to optical/uv extinction equivalent to&gt; 100 times the galactic gas-to-dust ratio are rare in agn absorbers (at most afew percent of the population), and may be restricted to broad absorption-lineqsos. seven objects appear to have an additional soft x-ray component inaddition to the heavily absorbed power law. we consider the implications of ourresults in the light of the agn unified scheme. we find that the softcomponents in narrow-line objects are consistent with the unified schemeprovided that &gt; 4 per cent of broad-line agn have ionised absorbers thatattenuate their soft x-ray flux by &gt;50 per cent. in at least one of the x-rayabsorbed, broad-line agn in our sample the x-ray spectrum requires an ionisedabsorber, consistent with this picture.

1111.4409	the optical-uv spectral energy distribution of the unabsorbed agn  population in the xmm-newton bright serendipitous survey	active galactic nuclei (agn) emit radiation over a wide range of wavelengths,with a peak of emission in the far-uv region of the electromagnetic spectrum, aspectral region that is historically difficult to observe. using optical, galexuv and xmm-newton data we derive the spectral energy distribution (sed) fromthe optical/uv to x-ray regime of a sizeable sample of agn. the principalmotivation is to investigate the relationship between the optical/uv emissionand the x-ray emission and provide bolometric corrections to the hard x-ray(2-10 kev) energy range, kbol, the latter being a fundamental parameter incurrent physical cosmology. we construct and study the x-ray to optical sed ofa sample of 195 x-ray selected type 1 agn belonging to the xmm-newton brightserendipitous survey (xbs). the optical-uv luminosity was computed using datafrom the sloan digital sky survey (sdss), from our own dedicated opticalspectroscopy and the satellite galaxy evolution explorer (galex), while thex-ray luminosity was computed using xmm-newton data. because it covers a widerange of redshift (0.03 &lt; z &lt; 2.2), x-ray luminosities (41.8 &lt; logl[2-10]kev &lt;45.5 erg/s) and because it is composed of "bright objects", this sample isideal for this kind of investigation. we find a correlation between kbol andthe hard x-ray photon index {\gamma}(2-10kev) and a tight correlation betweenthe optical-to-x-ray spectral index {\alpha}ox and kbol, so we conclude thatboth {\gamma}(2-10kev) and {\alpha}ox can be used as a proxy for kbol.

1304.1152	the role of relativistic jets in the heaviest and most active  supermassive black holes at high redshift	in powerful radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (agn), black holes heavierthan one billion solar masses form at a redshift ~1.5-2. supermassive blackholes in jetted radio-loud agn seems to form earlier, at a redshift close to 4.the ratio of active radio-loud to radio-quiet agn hosting heavy black holes istherefore a rather a strong function of redshift. we report on some recentevidence supporting this conclusion, gathered from the burst alert telescope(bat, onboard swift) and by the large area telescope (lat, onboard fermi). wesuggest that the more frequent occurrence of relativistic jets in the mostmassive black holes at high redshifts, compared to later times, could be due tothe average black hole spin being greater in the distant past, or else to thejet helping a fast accretion rate (or some combination of the two scenarios).we emphasize that the large total accretion efficiency of rapidly spinningblack holes inhibits a fast growth, unless a large fraction of the availablegravitational energy of the accreted mass is not converted into radiation, butused to form and maintain a powerful jet.

1305.0564	studying the relationship between x-ray emission and accretion in agns  using the xmm-newton bright serendipitous survey	we study the link between the x-ray emission in radio-quiet agns and theaccretion rate on the central supermassive black hole using a statisticallywell-defined and representative sample of 71 type 1 agns extracted from thexmm-newton bright serendipitous survey. we search and quantify the statisticalcorrelations between some fundamental parameters that characterize the x-rayemission, i.e. the x-ray spectral slope, and the x-ray "loudness", and theaccretion rate, both absolute and normalized to the eddington luminosity(eddington ratio). we parametrize the x-ray loudness using three differentquantities: the bolometric correction, the two-point spectral index and thedisk/corona luminosity ratio. we find that the x-ray spectral index depends onthe normalized accretion rate while the "x-ray loudness" depends on both thenormalized and the absolute accretion rate. the dependence on the eddingtonratio, in particular, is probably induced by the x-ray spectral slope-eddingtonratio correlation. the two proxies usually adopted in the literature toquantify the x-ray loudness of an agn, i.e. the bolometric correction and thetwo-point spectral index, behave differently, with the bolometric correctionbeing more sensitive to the eddington ratio and the two-point spectral indexhaving a stronger dependence with the absolute accretion. the explanation ofthis result is likely related to the different sensitivity of the twoparameters to the x-ray spectral index.

1401.7223	x-ray observation of ulas j1120+0641, the most distant quasar at z=7.08	we aim at probing the emission mechanism of the accreting super massive blackholes in the high redshift universe. we study the x-ray spectrum ofulas1120+0641, the highest redshift quasar detected so far at z=7.085, whichhas been deeply observed (340 ks) by xmm-newton. despite the long integrationtime the spectral analysis is limited by the poor statistics, with only 150source counts being detected. we measured the spectrum in the 2-80 kevrest-frame (0.3-10 kev observed) energy band. assuming a simple power law modelwe find a photon index of 2.0+/-0.3 and a luminosity of 6.7+/-0.3 10^44 erg/sin the 2-10 kev band, while the intrinsic absorbing column can be only looselyconstrained (nh&lt; 1e23 cm^-2). combining our data with published data wecalculate that the x-ray-to-optical spectral index alpha_ox is1.8+/-0.1, inagreement with the alpha_ox-uv luminosity correlation valid for lower redshiftquasars. we expanded to high energies the coverage of the spectral energydistribution of ulas1120+0641. this is the second time that a z &gt;6 quasar hasbeen investigated through a deep x-ray observation. in agreement with previousstudies of z~6 agn samples, we do not find any hint of evolution in thebroadband energy distribution. indeed from our dataset ulas 1120+0641 isindistinguishable from the population of optically bright quasar at lowerredshift.

1408.7037	the xmm-newton bright survey sample of absorbed quasars: x-ray and  accretion properties	although absorbed quasars are extremely important for our understanding ofthe energetics of the universe, the main physical parameters of their centralengines are still poorly known. in this work we present and study a completesample of 14 quasars (qsos) that are absorbed in the x-rays (column densitynh&gt;4x10^21 cm-2 and x-ray luminosity l(2-10 kev)&gt;10^44 ergs/s; xqso2) belongingto the xmm-newton bright serendipitous survey (xbs). from the analysis of theirultraviolet-to-mid-infrared spectral energy distribution we can separate thenuclear emission from the host galaxy contribution, obtaining a measurement ofthe fundamental nuclear parameters, like the mass of the central supermassiveblack hole and the value of eddington ratio, lambda_edd. comparing theproperties of xqso2s with those previously obtained for the x-ray unabsorbedqsos in the xbs, we do not find any evidence that the two samples are drawnfrom different populations. in particular, the two samples span the same rangein eddington ratios, up to lambda_edd=0.5; this implies that our xqso2spopulate the "forbidden region" in the so-called "effective eddington limitparadigm". a combination of low grain abundance, presence of stars inwards ofthe absorber, and/or anisotropy of the disk emission, can explain this result.

1501.01444	exploring the active galactic nuclei population with extreme x-ray to  optical flux ratios (fx/fo &gt;50)	the cosmic history of the growth of supermassive black holes in galacticcenters parallels that of star-formation in the universe. however, an importantfraction of this growth occurs inconspicuously in obscured objects, whereultraviolet/optical/near-infrared emission is heavily obscured by dust. sincethe x-ray flux is less attenuated, a high x-ray-to-optical flux ratio (fx/fo)is expected to be an efficient tool to find out these obscured accretingsources. we explore here via optical spectroscopy, x-ray spectroscopy andinfrared photometry the most extreme cases of this population (those with fx/fo&gt;50, exo50 sources hereafter), using a well defined sample of seven x-raysources extracted from the 2xmm catalogue. five exo50 sources (about 70 percentof the sample) in the bright flux regime explored by our survey (f(2-10 kev) &gt;1.5e-13 cgs) are associated with obscured agn (nh &gt; 1.0e22 cm-2), spanning aredshift range between 0.75 and 1 and characterised by 2-10 kev intrinsicluminosities in the qso regime (e.g. well in excess to 1.0e44 cgs). we did notfind compelling evidence of compton thick agn. overall the exo50 type 2 qsos donot seem to be different from standard x-ray selected type 2 qsos in terms ofnuclear absorption; a very high agn/host galaxy ratio seems to play a majorrole in explaining their extreme properties. interestingly three out of fiveexo50 type 2 qso objects can be classified as extreme dust obscured galaxies(edogs), suggesting that a very high agn/host ratios (along with the largeamount of dust absorption) could be the natural explanation also for a part ofthe edog population. the remaining two exo50 sources are classified as bl lacobjects, having rather extreme properties, and which are good candidates fortev emission.

1501.04335	revisiting the relationship between 6 {\mu}m and 2-10 kev continuum  luminosities of agn	we have determined the relation between the agn luminosities at rest-frame 6{\mu}m associated to the dusty torus emission and at 2-10 kev energies using acomplete, x-ray flux limited sample of 232 agn drawn from the bright ultra-hardxmm-newton survey. the objects have intrinsic x-ray luminosities between 10^42and 10^46 erg/s and redshifts from 0.05 to 2.8. the rest-frame 6 {\mu}mluminosities were computed using data from the wide-field infrared surveyexplorer and are based on a spectral energy distribution decomposition into agnand galaxy emission. the best-fit relationship for the full sample isconsistent with being linear, l_6 {\mu}m $\propto$ l_2-10 kev^0.99$\pm$0.032,with intrinsic scatter, ~0.35 dex in log l_6 {\mu}m. the l_6 {\mu}m/l_2-10 kevluminosity ratio is largely independent on the line-of-sight x-ray absorption.assuming a constant x-ray bolometric correction, the fraction of agn bolometricluminosity reprocessed in the mid-ir decreases weakly, if at all, with the agnluminosity, a finding at odds with simple receding torus models. type 2 agnhave redder mid-ir continua at rest-frame wavelengths &lt;12 {\mu}m and areoverall ~1.3-2 times fainter at 6 {\mu}m than type 1 agn at a given x-rayluminosity. regardless of whether type 1 and type 2 agn have the same ordifferent nuclear dusty toroidal structures, our results imply that the agnemission at rest-frame 6 {\mu}m is not isotropic due to self-absorption in thedusty torus, as predicted by agn torus models. thus, agn surveys at rest-frame6 {\mu}m are subject to modest dust obscuration biases.

1504.07068	wise colours and star-formation in the host galaxies of radio-loud  narrow-line seyfert 1	we investigate the mid-infrared properties of the largest (42 objects) sampleof radio-loud narrow-line seyfert 1 (rl nls1) collected to date, using datafrom the wide-field infrared survey explorer (wise). we analyse the mid-ircolours of these objects and compare them to what is expected from differentcombinations of agn and galaxy templates. we find that, in general, thehost-galaxy emission gives an importan contribution to the observed mid-ir fluxin particular at the longest wavelengths (w3, at 12micron, and w4, at22micron). in about half of the sources (22 objects) we observe a very redmid-ir colour (w4-w3&gt;2.5) that can be explained only using a starburst galaxytemplate (m82). using the 22micron luminosities, corrected for the agncontribution, we have then estimated the star-formation rate for 20 of these"red" rl nls1, finding values ranging from 10 to 500 msun/y. for the rl nls1showing bluer colours, instead, we cannot exclude the presence of astar-forming host galaxy although, on average, we expect a lower star-formationrate. studying the radio (1.4ghz) to mid-ir (22micron) flux ratios of the rlnls1 in the sample we found that in ~10 objects the star-forming activity couldrepresent the most important component also at radio frequencies, in addition(or in alternative) to the relativistic jet. we conclude that both the mid-irand the radio emission of rl nls1 are a mixture of different components,including the relativistic jet, the dusty torus and an intense star-formingactivity.

0805.1919	the cosmological properties of agn in the xmm-newton hard bright survey	(abridged) we investigate here the xlf of absorbed (nh between 4e21 and e24cm-2) and unabsorbed (nh &lt; 4e21 cm-2) agn, the fraction of absorbed agn as afunction of lx (and z), the intrinsic nh distribution of the agn population,and the xlf of compton thick (nh &gt; e24 cm-2) agn. to carry out thisinvestigation we have used the xmm-newton hard bright serendipitous sample(hbss) a complete sample of bright x-ray sources (fx &gt; 7e-14 cgs) at highgalactic latitude (|b| &gt; 20 deg) selected in the 4.5-7.5 kev energy band. thehbss sample is now almost completely identified (97% spectroscopic id) and itcan be safely used for a statistical investigation. the hbss contains 62 agnout of which 40 are unabsorbed (or marginally absorbed; nh &lt; 4e21 cm-2) and 22are absorbed (nh between 4e21 and e24 cm-2). absorbed and unabsorbed agn arecharacterized by two different xlf with the absorbed agn population beingdescribed by a steeper xlf, if compared with the unabsorbed ones, at allluminosities. the intrinsic fraction f of absorbed agn with l(2-10 kev) &gt; 3e42cgs is 0.57+/-0.11; we find that f decreases with the intrinsic luminosity, andprobably, increases with the redshift. our data are consistent with a flat lognh distribution for nh between e20 and e24 cm-2. finally, by comparing theresults obtained here with those obtained using an optically selected sample ofagn we derive, in an indirect way, the xlf of compton thick agn. the densityratio between compton thick agn (nh &gt; e24 cm-2) and compton thin agn (nh &lt; e24cm-2) decreases from 1.08+/-0.44 at lx e43 cgs to 0.23+/-0.15 at lx e45 cgs.

1506.09002	agn feedback in action: a new powerful wind in 1sxpsj050819.8+172149?	galaxy merging is widely accepted to be a key driving factor in galaxyformation and evolution, while the feedback from agn is thought to regulate thebh-bulge coevolution and the star formation process. in this context, wefocused on 1sxpsj050819.8+172149, a local (z=0.0175) seyfert 1.9 galaxy(l_bol~4x10^43 ergs/s). the source belongs to an ir-luminous interacting pairof galaxies, characterized by a luminosity for the whole system (due to thecombination of star formation and accretion) of log(l_ir/l_sun)=11.2. wepresent the first detailed description of the 0.3-10kev spectrum of1sxpsj050819.8+172149, monitored by swift with 9 pointings performed in lessthan 1 month. the x-ray emission of 1sxpsj050819.8+172149 is analysed bycombining all the swift pointings, for a total of ~72ks xrt net exposure. theaveraged swift-bat spectrum from the 70-month survey is also analysed. theslope of the continuum is ~1.8, with an intrinsic column density nh~2.4x10^22cm-2, and a deabsorbed luminosity l(2-10kev)~4x10^42 ergs/s. our observationsprovide a tentative (2.1sigma) detection of a blue-shifted fexxvi absorptionline (rest-frame e~7.8 kev), suggesting the discovery for a new candidatepowerful wind in this source. the physical properties of the outflow cannot befirmly assessed, due to the low statistics of the spectrum and to the observedenergy of the line, too close to the higher boundary of the swift-xrt bandpass.however, our analysis suggests that, if the detection is confirmed, the linecould be associated with a high-velocity (vout~0.1c) outflow most likelylaunched within 80r_s. to our knowledge this is the first detection of apreviously unknown ultrafast wind with swift. the high nh suggested by theobserved equivalent width of the line (ew~ -230ev, although with largeuncertainties), would imply a kinetic output strong enough to be comparable tothe agn bolometric luminosity.

1509.00738	the structure of the x-ray absorber in mrk 915 revealed by swift	in this paper we present the results obtained with a monitoring programme (23days long) performed with swift-xrt on the local seyfert galaxy mrk 915. thelight-curve analysis shows a significant count rate variation (about a factorof 2-3) on a time-scale of a few days, while the x-ray colours show a change inthe spectral curvature below 2 kev and the presence of two main spectralstates. from the spectral analysis we find that the observed variations can beexplained by the change of the intrinsic nuclear power (about a factor of 1.5)coupled with a change of the properties of an ionized absorber. the quality ofthe data prevents us from firmly establishing if the spectral variation is dueto a change in the ionization state and/or in the covering factor of theabsorbing medium. the latter scenario would imply a clumpy structure of theionized medium. by combining the information provided by the light curve andthe spectral analyses, we can derive some constraints on the location of theabsorber under the hypotheses of either homogeneous or clumpy medium. in bothcases, we find that the absorber should be located inside the outer edge of anextended torus and, in particular, under the clumpy hypothesis, it should belocated near, or just outside, to the broad emission line region.

0705.2985	elusive agn in the xmm-newton bright serendipitous survey	aims: we investigate here the nature of all the sources (35 in total) in thexbs survey (which is 86% optically identified) showing an optical spectrumdominated by the light from the host galaxy with no evidence (or littleevidence) for the presence of an agn. methods: we use the x-ray spectralanalysis to assess the presence of an agn in these sources and to characterizeits properties. results: we detect agn activity in 33 out of 35 sources. theremaining 2 sources are the ones with the lowest x-ray luminosity in the sample(l[2-10kev]&lt;10^41 erg s^-1) and their x-ray emission could be produced withinthe host galaxy. we find that the ``recognition problem'' for agn is verycritical in the low-luminosity regime (at least 60% of the agn withl[2-10kev]&lt;10^43 erg s^-1 are elusive) becoming negligible for high x-rayluminosities (~1.5% of elusive agn with l[2-10kev]&gt;10^44 erg s^-1). thisproblem affects mostly absorbed agn (~40% of type~2 agn in the survey areelusive) but also a significant fraction of unabsorbed agn (8%). conclusions:we find that the simplest explanations of why these 33 (or most of them) agnsare elusive are two: at low x-ray luminosities (&lt;10^43 erg s^-1) the mostimportant reason is the intrinsically low agn/galaxy contrast (opticaldilution) while at high luminosities (&gt;10^44 erg s^-1) it is due to the opticalabsorption (in the compton-thin regime, i.e. nh&lt;10^24 cm^-2). alternativehypotheses, like the presence of compton-thick sources, bl lac objects or``non-standard'' agn (e.g. with alpha_ox&lt;1 or with weak/absorbed narrow lineregion) are not supported by the data although we cannot exclude the presencein the sample of a few sources of these types.

astro-ph;0001030	a hard medium survey with asca. iii.: a type 2 agn revealed from x-ray  spectroscopy	in this paper we report the discovery of an hard x-ray selected type 2seyfert galaxy and we present and discuss its x-ray and optical spectrumtogether with the radio to x-ray energy distribution. the x-ray source -axj2254+1146 - is part of the asca hard serendipitous survey (hss). what makesthis discovery particularly noteworthy is the fact that the type 2classification of this seyfert galaxy has resulted directly from the x-ray dataand has been confirmed by optical spectroscopy only subsequently. the x-rayspectrum of axj2254+1146 is best described by a model consisting of anunresolved gaussian line at $6.43\pm 0.1$ kev plus the so called"leaky-absorber" continua having an intrinsic power law photon index of$\gamma$ = $2.51^{2.76}_{2.17}$ (1 $\sigma$ confidence interval). the best fitvalues of the absorbing column density ($n_h$ = $1.85^{2.24}_{1.47} \times10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$), of the line equivalent width ($0.6^{0.84}_{0.36}$ kev) andof the scattering fraction ($0.7^{1.4}_{0.1} %$), lead us to classify it as atype 2 agn from an x-ray point of view. inspection of the poss ii image revealsthe presence, within the asca x-ray error circle, of the nearby sbc spiralgalaxy ugc 12237 ($m_{b_o}=14.26$) that, even on positional groundconsiderations alone, is the most likely optical counterpart of axj2254+1146.subsequent optical spectroscopy of ugc 12237 has confirmed its seyfert 2optical nature.

astro-ph;0005567	bepposax broad-band observations of low-redshift quasars: spectral  curvature and iron k_alpha lines	we present results from bepposax observations of 10 low redshift quasars. thequasars are part of the laor et al. (1997) sample of 23 optically selected pgquasars with redshift &lt;0.4 and low galactic absorption along the line of sight.significant spectral curvature is detected for the 6 quasars with the highestsignal to noise ratio in their low energy spectra. the average curvature can beparameterized as a flattening of the underlying power law by delta_alpha ~ 0.5above ~1 kev. we find that quasars with a steeper soft x-ray (0.1-2 kev)spectrum tend to be steeper also at higher (2-10 kev) energies. thedistribution of the best fit 2-10 kev slopes is similar to that found for otherradio-quiet agn and characterized by a large dispersion around the mean:alpha_e ~ 1.0+/-0.3. iron k_alpha lines are detected in 4 quasars. in thenarrow-line quasar pg 1115+407, the rest frame line energy (6.69+/-0.11 kev)and equivalent width (580+/-280 ev) are consistent with those found in a fewlow redshift narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies (nlsy1). this, together with thesimilarity of the 0.1-10 kev x-ray continuum, suggests that this quasar is thehigher redshift and luminosity analog of a nlsy1. in the broad line quasar pg0947+396, the rest-frame line energy suggests fluorescence from cold iron. theline equivalent width (&gt; 400 ev) is however about 2-3 times higher than thatusually found in seyfert 1 galaxies. the high energy power-law slopes and theiron line emission properties seem to be unrelated to the x-ray luminosity.

astro-ph;0207166	xmm-newton observation of the lockman hole ii. spectral analysis	we present the results of the x-ray spectral analysis of the first deep x-raysurvey with the xmm-newton observatory during performance verification. werestrict the analysis to the sample of 98 sources with more than 70 net counts(flux limit in the [0.5-7] kev band of 1.6 10^{-15} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}) ofwhich 61 have redshift identification. we find no correlation between thespectral index gamma and the intrinsic absorption column density n_h and, forboth the type-1 and type-2 agn populations, we obtain &lt;gamma&gt;~2. theprogressive hardening of the mean x-ray source spectrum with decreasing flux isessentially due to an increase in intrinsic absorption. the marked separationbetween the two agn populations in several diagnostics diagrams, involvingx-ray colour, x-ray flux, optical/near ir colour and optical brightness, isalso a consequence of different absorption column densities and enables theclassification of optically faint obscured agn. about 27% of the subsample withr-k' colour are eros (r-k&gt;5) and most of these 18 x-ray selected eros containanobscured agn as revealed by their high x-ray-to-optical/near ir flux ratios.there are six sources in our sample with l_x[0.5-10]&gt;10^44 erg s^{-1} andlog(n_h)&gt;10^22 cm^{-2}: which are likely type-2 qsos and we thus derive adensity of ~69 objects of this class per square degree.

astro-ph;0304529	an xmm-newton hard x-ray survey of ulirgs	xmm-newton observations of 10 ulirgs are reported. the aim is to investigatein hard x-rays a complete ulirg sample selected from the bright iras 60$\mu$mcatalogue. all sources are detected in x-rays, 5 of which for the first time.these observations confirm that ulirgs are intrinsically faint x-rays sources,their observed x-ray luminosities being typically l(2-10 kev)&lt;1e42-43 erg/s,whereas their bolometric luminosities are l&gt;1e45 erg/s. in all sources we findevidence for thermal emission from hot plasma with kt~0.7kev, dominating thex-ray spectra below 1kev, and likely associated with a nuclear or circumnuclearstarburst. this thermal emission appears uncorrelated with the fir luminosity,suggesting that,in addition to the ongoing rate of star formation, otherparameters may also affect it. the soft x-ray emission appears to be extendedon a scale of ~30kpc for mkn231 and iras19254-7245, possible evidence ofgalactic superwinds. in these 2 sources, in iras20551-4250 and iras23128-5919we find evidence for the presence of hidden agns, while a minor agncontribution may be suspected also in iras20100-4156. in particular, we havedetected a strong fe line at 6.4kev in the spectrum of iras19254-7245 and aweaker one in mkn231, suggestive of deeply buried agns. for the other sources,the x-ray luminosities and spectral shapes are consistent with hot thermalplasma and x-ray binary emissions of mainly starburst origin. we find that the2-10kev luminosities in these sources, most likely due to high-mass x-raybinaries, are correlated with l_fir: both luminosities are good indicators ofthe current global sfr in the galaxy. the composite nature of ulirgs is thenconfirmed, with hints for a predominance of the starburst over the agnphenomenon in these objects.

astro-ph;0312344	the xmm-newton hbs28 sample: studying the obscuration in hard x-ray  selected agns	this paper presents the analysis of a statistically complete sample of 28serendipitous x-ray sources selected in 82 pointed xmm-newton fields down to acount-rate of 0.002 counts s^-1(4.5-7.5 kev energy band). this is the firstsample selected in this energy range to have complete spectroscopicidentifications and redshift determinations for all the objects. apart from onegalactic source (an interacting binary), all the objects are agns. theiroptical and x-ray properties (derived from the spectral analysis of thexmm-epic data) are compared together. the good correlation between the opticalspectral type and the x-ray absorption properties supports the agn unifiedmodel. only one object that does not fit the relation between optical and x-rayabsorption is found, namely a seyfert 1.9 with no evidence of obscuration inthe x-ray band (nh&lt;1.3x10^20 cm^-2). in total, 7 sources out of 27 are heavilyobscured in the x-ray (nh&gt;10^22 cm^-2), corresponding to a surface density of0.7 deg^-2 at the flux limit the sample (4-7x10^-14 erg s^-1 cm^-2 in the4.5-7.5 kev energy band). among these obscured objects, two sources show alarge (intrinsic) luminosity (l_[2-10kev]&gt;10^44 erg s^-1) and are thusclassified as type 2 qso. finally, we have compared the fraction of x-rayabsorbed agns (26%) with that predicted by the current xrb synthesis models atthe flux limit of the survey. we find that the models significantly (~90%confidence level) over predict the fraction of absorbed agns thus confirmingalso in this hard energy band (4.5-7.5 kev) similar results recently obtainedin the 2-10 kev band.

astro-ph;0402568	2-10 kev luminosity of high-mass binaries as a gauge of ongoing  star-formation rate	based on recent work on spectral decomposition of the emission ofstar-forming galaxies, we assess whether the integrated 2-10 kev emission fromhigh-mass x-ray binaries (hmxbs), l_{2-10}^{hmxb}, can be used as a reliableestimator of ongoing star formation rate (sfr). using a sample of 46 local (z &lt;0.1) star forming galaxies, and spectral modeling of asca, bepposax, andxmm-newton data, we demonstrate the existence of a linear sfr-l_{2-10}^{hmxb}relation which holds over ~5 decades in x-ray luminosity and sfr. the total2-10 kev luminosity is not a precise sfr indicator because at low sfr (i.e., innormal and moderately-starbursting galaxies) it is substantially affected bythe emission of low-mass x-ray binaries, which do not trace the current sfr dueto their long evolution lifetimes, while at very high sfr (i.e., for veryluminous fir-selected galaxies) it is frequently affected by the presence ofstrongly obscured agns. the availability of purely sb-powered galaxies - whose2-10 kev emission is mainly due to hmxbs - allows us to properly calibrate thesfr-l_{2-10}^{hmxb} relation. the sfr-l_{2-10}^{hmxb} relation holds also fordistant (z ~ 1) galaxies in the hubble deep field north sample, for which welack spectral information, but whose sfr can be estimated from deep radio data.if confirmed by more detailed observations, it may be possible to use thededuced relation to identify distant galaxies that are x-ray overluminous fortheir (independently estimated) sfr, and are therefore likely to hide stronglyabsorbed agns.

astro-ph;0406368	the composite starburst/agn nature of the superwind galaxy ngc 4666	we report the discovery of a compton-thick agn and of intense star-formationactivity in the nucleus and disk, respectively, of the nearly edge-on superwindgalaxy ngc 4666. spatially unresolved emission is detected by bepposax only atenergies &lt;10 kev, whereas spatially resolved emission from the whole disk isdetected by xmm-newton. a prominent (ew ~ 1-2 kev) emission line at ~6.4 kev isdetected by both instruments. from the xmm-newton data alone the line isspectrally localized at e ~ 6.42 +/- 0.03 kev, and seems to be spatiallyconcentrated in the nuclear region of ngc 4666. this, together with thepresence of a flat (gamma ~ 1.3) continuum in the nuclear region, suggests theexistence of a strongly absorbed (i.e., compton-thick) agn, whose intrinsic2-10 kev luminosity is estimated to be l_{2-10} &gt; 2 x 10^{41} erg/s. atenergies &lt;1 kev the integrated (bepposax) spectrum is dominated by a ~0.25 kevthermal gas component distributed throughout the disk (resolved by xmm-newton).at energies ~2-10 kev, the integrated spectrum is dominated by a steep (g &gt; 2)power-law (pl) component. the latter emission is likely due to unresolvedsources with luminosity l ~ 10^{38} - 10^{39} erg/s that are most likelyaccreting binaries (with bh masses &lt;8 m_sun). such binaries, which are known todominate the x-ray point-source luminosity in nearby star-forming galaxies,have gamma ~ 2 pl spectra in the relevant energy range. a gamma ~ 1.8 plcontribution from compton scattering of (the radio-emitting) relativisticelectrons by the ambient fir photons may add a truly diffuse component to the2-10 kev emission.

astro-ph;0410432	xmm-newton spectroscopy of an x-ray selected sample of rl agns	this paper presents the x-ray spectroscopy of an x-ray selected sample of 25radio-loud (rl) agns extracted from the xbss sample. the main goal is to studythe origin of the x-ray spectral differences usually observed betweenradio-loud and radio-quiet (rq) agns. to this end, a comparison sample of 53 rqagns has been also extracted from the same xbss sample and studied togetherwith the sample of rl agns. we have focused the analysis on the distribution ofthe x-ray spectral indices of the power-law component that models the largemajority of the spectra in both samples. we find that the mean x-ray energyspectral index is very similar in the 2 samples and close to alpha_x~1.however, the intrinsic distribution of the spectral indices is significantlybroader in the sample of rl agns. in order to investigate the origin of thisdifference, we have divided the rl agns into blazars and ``non-blazars'', onthe basis of the available optical and radio information. we find strongevidence that the broad distribution observed in the rl agn sample is mainlydue to the presence of the blazars. furthermore, within the blazar class wehave found a link between the x-ray spectral index and the value of theradio-to-x-ray spectral index suggesting that the observed x-ray emission isdirectly connected to the emission of the relativistic jet. this trend is notobserved among the ``non-blazars'' rl agns. this favours the hypothesis that,in these latter sources, the x-ray emission is not significantly influenced bythe jet emission and it has probably an origin similar to the rq agns. overall,the results presented here indicate that the observed distribution of the x-rayspectral indices in a given sample of rl agns is strongly dependent on theamount of relativistic beaming present in the selected sources.

astro-ph;0410434	looking for obscured qsos in the x-ray emitting ero population	we present xmm-newton data centered on one of the munics near infraredcluster survey fields (s2f1) and we discuss the x-ray properties of the 6 x-rayemitting eros found. for one of them we have already obtained the redshiftusing near-infrared spectroscopic data, while for the remaining 5 eros theanalysis is based on photometric redshifts. we find evidence for the presenceof an x-ray obscured qso in at least 5 out of the 6 x-ray emitting eros. forthese 5 objects we derive intrinsic (2-10 kev) luminosities in excess of 10^44erg/s and intrinsic column densities higher than 10^22 cm^-2. these values havebeen obtained through a basic x-ray spectral analysis for the three brightestsources and through the analysis of the hardness ratios for the remaining two.all of these 5 x-ray emitting eros appear extended in the optical/near-infraredbands indicating that the host galaxy emission dominates at these wavelengths.this suggests that the hosted agns are likely to be absorbed also in theoptical/near-infrared bands: i.e. they are likely x-ray obscured possible type2 qsos. for the remaining ero the presence of an agn is suggested both by itshigh 0.5-2 kev luminosity (l(0.5-2 kev)~10^43 erg/s) and by itsx-ray-to-optical flux ratio. in this case the quality of the present dataprevents us from placing firm constraints on the agn type hosted. finally, thenear-ir spectrum obtained for one of the 6 eros classifies the host galaxy asan elliptical at z~1.7 with a stellar mass well in excess of 10^11 m_\odot.this result corroborates the possible link between the qso activity and theformation of massive spheroids.

astro-ph;0610241	the kormendy relation of massive elliptical galaxies at z~1.5. evidence  for size evolution ?	we present the morphological analysis based on hst-nic2 (0.075 arcsec/pixel)images in the f160w filter of a sample of 9 massive field (&gt; 10^{11} m_\odot)galaxies spectroscopically classified as early-types at 1.2&lt;z&lt;1.7. our analysisshows that all of them are bulge dominated systems. in particular, 6 of themare well fitted by a de vaucouleurs profile (n=4) suggesting that they can beconsidered pure elliptical galaxies. the remaining 3 galaxies are better fittedby a sersic profile with index 1.9&lt;n&lt;2.3 suggesting that a disk-like componentcould contribute up to 30% to the total light of these galaxies. we derived theeffective radius r_e and the mean surface brightness &lt;mu_e&gt; within r_e of ourgalaxies and we compared them with those of early-types at lower redshifts. wefind that the surface brightness &lt;mu_e&gt; of our galaxies should get fainter by2.5 mag from z~1.5 to z~0 to match the surface brightness of the localellipticals with comparable r_e, i.e. the local kormendy relation. luminosityevolution without morphological changes can only explain half of this effect,as the maximum dimming expected for an elliptical galaxy is ~1.6 mag in thisredshift range. thus, other parameters, possibly structural, may undergoevolution and play an important role in reconciling models and observations.hypothesizing an evolution of the effective radius of galaxies we find that r_eshould increase by a factor 1.5 from z~1.5 to z~0.

astro-ph;0610354	the stellar content of the xmm-newton bright serendipitous survey	context: the comparison of observed counts in a given sky direction withpredictions by galactic models yields constraints to the spatial distributionand the stellar birthrate of young stellar populations. in this work we presentthe results of the analysis of the stellar content of the xmm-newton brightserendipitous survey (xbss). this unbiased survey includes a total of 58stellar sources selected in the 0.5 -- 4.5 kev energy band, having a limitingsensitivity of $10^{-2}$ cnt s$^{-1}$ and covering an area of 28.10 sq. deg.aims: our main goal is to understand the recent star formation history of thegalaxy in the vicinity of the sun. methods: we compare the observations withthe predictions obtained with xcount, a model of the stellar x-ray content ofthe galaxy. the model predicts the number and properties of the stars to beobserved in terms of magnitude, colour, population and$f_\mathrm{x}/f_\mathrm{v}$ ratio distributions of the coronal sources detectedwith a given instrument and sensitivity in a specific sky direction. results:as in other shallow surveys, we observe an excess of stars not predicted by ourgalaxy model. comparing the colours of the identified infrared counterpartswith the model predictions, we observe that this excess is produced by yellow(g+k) stars. the study of the x-ray spectrum of each source reveals a mainpopulation of stars with coronal temperature stratification typical ofintermediate-age stars. as no assumptions have been made for the selection ofthe sample, our results must be representative of the entire solarneighbourhood. some stars show excess circumstellar absorption indicative ofyouth.

0809.1939	high precision x-ray logn-logs distributions: implications for the  obscured agn population	we have constrained the extragalactic source count distributions over a broadrange of x-ray fluxes and in various energy bands to test whether thepredictions from x-ray background synthesis models agree with the observationalconstraints provided by our measurements. we have used 1129 xmm-newtonobservations at |b|&gt;20 deg covering a sky area of 132.3 deg^2 to compile thelargest complete samples of x-ray objects to date in the 0.5-1 kev, 1-2 kev,2-4.5 kev, 4.5-10 kev, 0.5-2 kev and 2-10 kev energy bands. our survey includesin excess of 30,000 sources down to ~10^-15 erg/cm^2/s below 2 kev and down to~10^{-14} erg/cm^2/s above 2 kev. a break in the source count distributions wasdetected in all energy bands except the 4.5-10 kev band. an analytical modelcomprising 2 power-law components cannot adequately describe the curvature seenin the source count distributions. the shape of the logn(&gt;s)-logs is stronglydependent on the energy band with a general steepening apparent as we move tohigher energies. this is due to non-agn populations, comprised mainly of starsand clusters of galaxies, contribute up to 30% of the source population atenergies &lt;2 kev and at fluxes &gt;10^{-13} erg/cm^2/s, and these populations ofobjects have significantly flatter source count distributions than agn. we finda substantial increase in the relative fraction of hard x-ray sources at higherenergies, from &gt;55% below 2 kev to &gt;77% above 2 kev. however the majority ofsources detected above 4.5 kev still have significant flux below 2 kev.comparison with predictions from the synthesis models suggest that the modelsmight be overpredicting the number of faint absorbed agn, which would call forfine adjustment of some model parameters such as the obscured to unobscured agnratio and/or the distribution of column densities at intermediate obscuration.

astro-ph;0703451	the xmm-newton serendipitous survey iv. the axis x-ray source counts and  angular clustering	axis (an xmm-newton international survey) is a survey of 36 high galacticlatitude xmm-newton observations covering 4.8 deg2 and containing 1433serendipitous x-ray sources detected with 5-sigma significance. we have studiedthe x-ray source counts in four energy bands soft (0.5-2 kev), hard (2-10 kev),xid (0.5-4.5 kev) and ultra-hard (4.5-7.5 kev). we have combined this surveywith shallower and deeper surveys. our source counts results are compatiblewith most previous samples in the soft, xid, ultra-hard and hard bands. thefractions of the xrb resolved in the surveys used in this work are 87%, 85%,60% and 25% in the soft, hard, xid and ultra-hard bands, respectively.extrapolation of our source counts to zero flux are not enough to saturate thexrb intensity. only galaxies and/or absorbed agn may be able contribute theremaining unresolved xrb intensity. our results are compatible, within theerrors, with recent revisions of the xrb intensity in the soft and hard bands.the maximum fractional contribution to the xrb comes from fluxes within about adecade of the break in the source counts (~1e-14 cgs), reaching ~50% of thetotal in the soft and hard bands. using only axis sources, we have studied theangular correlation in those bands using a novel robust technique. angularclustering (widely distributed over the sky and not confined to a few deepfields) is detected at 99-99.9% significance in the soft and xid bands, with nodetection in the hard and ultra-hard band (probably due to the smaller numberof sources). we cannot confirm the detection of significantly strongerclustering in the hard-spectrum hard sources. medium depth surveys such as axisare essential to determine the evolution of the x-ray emission in the universebelow 10 kev.

astro-ph;9503064	a first determination of the surface density of galaxy clusters at very  low x--ray fluxes	we present the first results of a serendipitous search for clusters ofgalaxies in deep rosat-pspc pointed observations at high galactic latitude. thesurvey is being carried out using a wavelet based detection algorithm which isnot biased against extended, low surface brightness sources. a newflux--diameter limited sample of 10 cluster candidates has been created from$\rm\sim 3 \, deg^2$ surveyed area. preliminary ccd observations have revealedthat a large fraction of these candidates correspond to a visible enhancementin the galaxy surface density, and several others have been identified fromother surveys. we believe these sources to be either low--moderate redshiftgroups or intermediate to high redshift clusters. we show x-ray and opticalimages of some of the clusters identified to date. we present, for the firsttime, the derived number density of the galaxy clusters to a flux limit of $\rm1\cdot 10^{-14} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}$ (0.5--2.0 kev). this extends the $\logn$--$\log s$ of previous cluster surveys by more than one decade in flux.results are compared to theoretical predictions for cluster number counts.

astro-ph;9710308	the rosat deep cluster survey: the x-ray luminosity function out to  z=0.8	we present the x-ray luminosity function (xlf) of the rosat deep clustersurvey (rdcs) sample over the redshift range 0.05-0.8. our results are derivedfrom a complete flux-limited subsample of 70 galaxy clusters, representing thebrightest half of the total sample, which have been spectroscopicallyidentified down to the flux limit of 4*10^{-14} erg/cm^2/s (0.5-2.0 kev) andhave been selected via a serendipitous search in rosat-pspc pointedobservations. the redshift baseline is large enough that evolutionary effectscan be studied within the sample. the local xlf (z &lt; 0.25) is found to be inexcellent agreement with previous determinations using the rosat all-sky surveydata. the xlf at higher redshifts, when combined with the deepest number countsconstructed to date (f&gt;2*10^{-14} arg/cm^2/s), reveal no significant evolutionat least out to z=0.8, over a luminosity range 2*10^{42}-3*10^{44} erg/s in the[0.5-2 kev] band. these findings extend the study of cluster evolution to thehighest redshifts and the faintest fluxes probed so far in x-ray surveys. theycomplement and do not necessarily conflict with those of the einstein extendedmedium sensitivity survey, leaving the possibility of negative evolution of thebrightest end of the xlf at high redshifts.

astro-ph;9810254	the rex survey: a search for radio emitting x-ray sources	we present the scientific goals, the strategy and the first results of therex project, an effort aimed at creating a sizable and statistically completesample of radio emitting x-ray sources (rex) using the available data from avla survey and the rosat pspc archive. through a positional cross-correlationof the two data sets we have derived a sample of about 1600 rex. among the 393rex identified so far a high fraction is represented by agns, typically radioloud qsos and bl lacs. the remaining sources are galaxies, typically radiogalaxies isolated or in cluster. thanks to the low flux limits in the radio andin the x-ray band and the large area of sky covered by the survey, we intend toderive a new complete and unbiased sample of bl lacs which will contain both``rbl'' and ``xbl'' type objects. in this way, the apparent dichotomy resultingfrom the current samples of bl lacs will be directly analyzed in a uniquesample. moreover, the high number of bl lacs expected in the rex sample (about200) will allow an accurate estimate of their statistical properties. to date,we have discovered 15 new bl lacs and 11 bl lac candidates with opticalproperties intermediate between those of a typical elliptical galaxy and thoseof a typical bl lac object. these objects could harbour weak sources ofnon-thermal continuum in their nuclei and, if confirmed, they could representthe faint tail of the bl lac population. the existence of such ``weak'' bl lacsis matter of discussion in recent literature and could lead to a re-assessmentof the defining criteria of a bl lac and, consequently, to a revision of theircosmological and statistical properties.

astro-ph;9810417	asca observations of the starburst-driven superwind galaxy ngc 2146:  broad band (0.6 - 9 kev) spectral properties	we report asca gis and sis observations of the nearby (d = 11.6 mpc), nearlyedge-on, starburst galaxy ngc 2146. these x-ray spectral data complement rosatpspc and hri imaging discussed by armus et al., 1995. the broad band (0.6-9kev) x-ray spectrum of ngc 2146 is best described by a two component model: thesoft x-ray emission with a raymond-smith thermal plasma model having atemperature of kt $\sim 0.8$ kev; the hard x-ray emission with a thermal plasmamodel having kt $\sim 8$ kev or a power-law model having a photon index of$\sim 1.7$. we do not find compelling evidence of substantial excess absorptionabove the galactic value. the soft (hard) thermal component provides about 30%(70%) of the total luminosity in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev energy band, while in the2-10 kev energy range only the hard component plays a major role. the spectralresults allow us to set tighter constraints on the starburst-driven superwindmodel, which we show can satisfactorily account for the luminosity, mass, andenergy content represented by the soft x-ray spectral component. we estimatethat the mass outflow rate ($\sim$ 9 m$_{\odot}$ per year) is about an order ofmagnitude greater than the predicted rate at which supernovae and stellar windsreturn mass into the interstellar medium and, therefore, argue that the flow isstrongly "mass-loaded" with material in and around the starburst. the estimatedoutflow velocity of the hot gas is close to the escape velocity from thegalaxy, so the fate of the gas is not clear. we suggest that the hard x-rayspectral component is due to the combined emission of x-ray binaries and/oryoung supernovae remnants associated with the starburst.

astro-ph;9811074	a 3 dimensional diagnostic diagram for seyfert 2s: probing x-ray  absorption and compton thickness	we present and discuss a "3-dimensional" diagnostic diagram for seyfert2galaxies obtained by means of x-ray and [oiii] data on a large sample ofobjects (reported in the appendix). the diagram shows the kalpha iron lineequivalent width as a function of both the column density derived from thephotoelectric cutoff and the 2-10 kev flux normalized to the [oiii] opticalline flux (the latter corrected for extinction and assumed to be a trueindicator of the source intrinsic luminosity). we find that the hard x-rayproperties of type 2 objects depend on a single parameter, the absorbing columndensity along the line of sight,in accordance with the unified model. thediagram can be used to identify compton thick sources and to isolate and studypeculiar objects. from this analysis we have obtained a column densitydistribution of seyfert 2 galaxies which is thought to be a good approximationof the real distribution. a large population of heavily absorbed objects isdiscovered, including many compton thick candidates. our results indicate thatthe mean log nh/cm^(-2)in type 2 seyferts is 23.5 and that as much as 23-30% ofsources have nh &gt; 10^24 cm^(-2).

astro-ph;9910489	bepposax observations of two high redshift clusters of galaxies:  rxj0152.7-1357 and ms2053.7-0449	we present x-ray observations of two high redshift clusters of galaxiescarried out with the bepposax satellite. one cluster, rxj0152.7-1357 at z =0.83, was selected from the rosat deep cluster survey sample, as one of themost x-ray luminous systems known at z&gt;0.5. the optical and rosat-pspc datashow a complex morphology with at least two cores. our sax observations yield agas temperature kt = 6.46^{+1.74}_{-1.19} kev and a metallicity a =0.53^{+0.29}_{-0.24}, with a prominent iron k(alpha) line. the second cluster,ms2053.7-0449 at z = 0.58, was selected from the emss sample. given the poorstatistics no constraints on the metallicity can be derived from the presentdata. large uncertainties are associated to the gas temperature (kt =6.7^{+6.8}_{-2.3} kev), which has been obtained after fixing the abundance to0.3 solar. combining these results with those obtained for similarly highredshift (z &gt;= 0.5) clusters of galaxies with broad band x-ray spectra, wediscuss the high redshift l(bol) - t relationship. the data can easily beaccommodated with a non-evolving (or mildly evolving) l(bol) - t relation, aresult which, when combined with the little observed evolution in the bulk ofthe x-ray cluster population, gives support to low omega cosmological models.

0811.1450	the xmm-newton serendipitous survey. vi. the x-ray luminosity function	we present the x-ray luminosity function of agn in three energy bands (soft:0.5-2 kev, hard: 2-10 kev and ultrahard: 4.5-7.5 kev). we have used the xmssurvey along with other highly complete flux-limited deeper and shallowersurveys for a total of 1009, 435 and 119 sources in the soft, hard andultrahard bands, respectively. we have modeled the intrinsic absorption of thehard and ultrahard sources (nh function) and computed the intrinsic x-rayluminosity function in all bands using a maximum likelihood fit technique to ananalytical model. we find that the x-ray luminosity function (xlf) is bestdescribed by a luminosity-dependent density evolution (ldde) model. our resultsshow a good overall agreement with previous results in the hard band, althoughwith slightly weaker evolution. our model in the soft band present slightdiscrepancies with other works in this band, the shape of our present day xlfbeing significantly flatter. we find faster evolution in the agn detected inthe ultrahard band than those in the hard band. the fraction of absorbed agn inthe hard and ultrahard bands is dependent on the x-ray luminosity. we findevidence of evolution of this fraction with redshift in the hard band but notin the ultrahard band, possibly due to the low statistics. our best-fit xlfshows that the high-luminosity agn are fully formed earlier than the lessluminous agn. the latter sources account for the vast majority of the accretionrate and mass density of the universe, according to an anti-hierarchical blackhole growth scenario.
