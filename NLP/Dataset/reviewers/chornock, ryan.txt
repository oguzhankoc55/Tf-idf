0902.2794	sn 2008ha: an extremely low luminosity and extremely low energy  supernova	we present ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared photometry as well asoptical spectra of the peculiar supernova (sn) 2008ha. sn 2008ha had a very lowpeak luminosity, reaching only m_v = -14.2 mag, and low line velocities of only~2000 km/s near maximum brightness, indicating a very small kinetic energy perunit mass of ejecta. spectroscopically, sn 2008ha is a member of the sn2002cx-like class of sne, a peculiar subclass of sne ia; however, sn 2008ha isthe most extreme member, being significantly fainter and having lower linevelocities than the typical member, which is already ~2 mag fainter and hasline velocities ~5000 km/s smaller (near maximum brightness) than a normal snia. sn 2008ha had a remarkably short rise time of only ~10 days, significantlyshorter than either sn 2002cx-like objects (~15 days) or normal sne ia (~19.5days). the bolometric light curve of sn 2008ha indicates that sn 2008ha peakedat l_peak = (9.5 +/- 1.4) x 10^40 ergs/s, making sn 2008ha perhaps the leastluminous sn ever observed. from its peak luminosity and rise time, we inferthat sn 2008ha generated (3.0 +/- 0.9) x 10^-3 m_sun of 56ni, had a kineticenergy of ~2 x 10^48 ergs, and ejected 0.15 m_sun of material. we classifythree new (and one potential) members of the sn 2002cx-like class, expandingthe sample to 14 (and one potential) members. the host-galaxy morphologydistribution of the class is consistent with that of sne ia, ib, ic, and ii.several models for generating low-luminosity sne can explain the observationsof sn 2008ha; however, if a single model is to describe all sn 2002cx-likeobjects, either electron capture in ne-mg white dwarfs causing a core collapse,or deflagration of c-o white dwarfs with sn 2008ha being a partial deflagrationand not unbinding the progenitor star, are preferred. abridged.

0905.0695	a redetermination of the hubble constant with the hubble space telescope  from a differential distance ladder	we report observations of 240 cepheid variables obtained with the nearinfrared camera (nicmos) through the f160w filter on the hubble space telescope(hst). the cepheids are distributed across six recent hosts of type iasupernovae (sne ia) and the "maser galaxy" ngc 4258, allowing us to directlycalibrate the peak luminosities of the sne ia from the precise, geometricdistance measurements provided by the masers. new features of our measurementinclude the use of the same instrument for all cepheid measurements across thedistance ladder and homogeneity of the cepheid periods and metallicities thusnecessitating only a differential measurement of cepheid fluxes and reducingthe largest systematic uncertainties in the determination of the fiducial sn ialuminosity. the nicmos measurements reduce differential extinction in the hostgalaxies by a factor of 5 over past optical data. combined with an expanded of240 sne ia at z&lt;0.1 which define their magnitude-redshift relation, we findh_0=74.2 +/-3.6, a 4.8% uncertainty including both statistical and systematicerrors. we show that the factor of 2.2 improvement in the precision of h_0 is asignificant aid to the determination of the equation-of-state of dark energy, w= p/(rho c^2). combined with the wmap 5-year measurement of omega_m h^2, wefind w= -1.12 +/- 0.12 independent of high-redshift sne ia or baryon acousticoscillations (bao). this result is also consistent with analyses based on thecombination of high-z sne ia and bao. the constraints on w(z) now with high-zsne ia and bao are consistent with a cosmological constant and improved by afactor of 3 from the refinement in h_0 alone. we show future improvements inh_0 are likely and will further contribute to multi-technique studies of darkenergy.

0905.0697	cepheid calibrations of modern type ia supernovae:implications for the  hubble constant	this is the first of two papers reporting measurements from a program todetermine the hubble constant to 5% precision from a refurbished distanceladder. we present new observations of 110 cepheid variables in the hostgalaxies of two recent type ia supernovae (sne ia), ngc 1309 and ngc 3021,using the advanced camera for surveys on the hubble space telescope (hst). wealso present new observations of the hosts previously observed with hst whosesne ia provide the most precise luminosity calibrations: sn 1994ae in ngc 3370,sn 1998aq in ngc 3982, sn 1990n in ngc 4639, and sn 1981b in ngc 4536, as wellas the maser host, ngc 4258. increasing the interval between observationsenabled the discovery of new, longer-period cepheids, including 57 with p&gt;60days, which extend these period-luminosity (pl) relations. we present 93measurements of the metallicity parameter, 12 + log[o/h], measured from hiiregions in the vicinity of the cepheids and show these are consistent withsolar metallicity. we find the slope of the seven dereddened pl relations to beconsistent with that of the large magellanic cloud cepheids and with parallaxmeasurements of galactic cepheids, and we address the implications for thehubble constant. we also present multi-band light curves of sn 2002fk (in ngc1309) and sn 1995al (in ngc 3021) which may be used to calibrate theirluminosities. in the second paper we present observations of the cepheids inthe h-band obtained with the near infrared camera and multi-object spectrometeron hst, further mitigating systematic errors along the distance ladderresulting from dust and chemical variations. the quality and homogeneity ofthese sn and cepheid data provide the basis for a more precise determination ofthe hubble constant.

0906.2200	spectral evolution of the extraordinary type iin supernova 2006gy	we present a detailed analysis of the extremely luminous type iin supernovasn2006gy using spectra obtained between days 36 and 237 after explosion. wederive the temporal evolution of the effective temperature, radius, expansionspeeds, and bolometric luminosity, as well as the progenitor wind density andtotal swept-up mass overtaken by the shock. sn2006gy can be interpreted in thecontext of shock interaction with a dense csm, but with quite extreme valuesfor the csm mass of 20 msun and an explosion kinetic energy of at least 5e51erg. a key difference between sn2006gy and other sneiin is that, owing to itslarge csm mass, the interaction region remained opaque much longer. at earlytimes, h-alpha widths suggest that the photosphere is ahead of the shock, andphotons diffuse out through the opaque csm. the pivotal transition to opticallythin emission begins around day 110, when we start to see a decrease in theblackbody radius and strengthening tracers of the post-shock shell. from theevolution of pre-shock velocities, we deduce that the csm was ejected by theprogenitor in a 1e49 erg precursor event 8yr before explosion. the large csmmass rules out models involving stars with initial masses around 10msun. withthe full mass budget, even massive m_zams=30-40 msun progenitor stars areinadequate. at roughly solar metallicity, substantial mass loss probablyoccurred during the star's life, so sn 2006gy's progenitor is more consistentwith lbv eruptions or pulsational pair-instability ejections in stars withinitial masses above 100 msun. this requires significant revision to currentparadigms of massive-star evolution.

0912.2465	large late-time asphericities in three type iip supernovae	type ii-plateau supernovae (sne iip) are the results of the explosions of redsupergiants and are the most common subclass of core-collapse supernovae. pastobservations have shown that the outer layers of the ejecta of sne iip arelargely spherical, but the degree of asphericity increases toward the core. wepresent evidence for high degrees of asphericity in the inner cores of threerecent sne iip (sne 2006my, 2006ov, and 2007aa), as revealed by late-timeoptical spectropolarimetry. the three objects were all selected to have verylow interstellar polarization (isp), which minimizes the uncertainties in ispremoval and allows us to use the continuum polarization as a tracer ofasphericity. the three objects have intrinsic continuum polarizations in therange of 0.83-1.56% in observations taken after the end of the photometricplateau, with the polarization dropping to almost zero at the wavelengths ofstrong emission lines. our observations of sn 2007aa at earlier times, taken onthe photometric plateau, show contrastingly smaller continuum polarizations(~0.1%). the late-time h-alpha and [o i] line profiles of sn 2006ov providefurther evidence for asphericities in the inner ejecta. such high corepolarizations in very ordinary core-collapse supernovae provide furtherevidence that essentially all core-collapse supernova explosions are highlyaspherical, even if the outer parts of the ejecta show only small deviationsfrom spherical symmetry.

1004.2262	spectroscopic discovery of the broad-lined type ic supernova 2010bh  associated with the low-redshift grb 100316d	we present the spectroscopic discovery of a broad-lined type ic supernova (sn2010bh) associated with the nearby long-duration gamma-ray burst (grb) 100316d.at z = 0.0593, this is the third-nearest grb-sn. nightly optical spectraobtained with the magellan telescopes during the first week after explosionreveal the gradual emergence of very broad spectral features superposed on ablue continuum. the supernova features are typical of broad-lined sne ic andare generally consistent with previous supernovae associated with low-redshiftgrbs. however, the inferred velocities of sn 2010bh at 21 days after explosionare a factor of ~2 times larger than those of the prototypical sn 1998bw atsimilar epochs, with v ~ 26,000 km/s, indicating a larger explosion energy or adifferent ejecta structure. a near-infrared spectrum taken 13.8 days afterexplosion shows no strong evidence for he i at 1.083 microns, implying that theprogenitor was largely stripped of its helium envelope. the host galaxy is oflow luminosity (m_r ~ -18.5 mag) and low metallicity (z &lt; 0.4 z_solar), similarto the hosts of other low-redshift grb-sne.

1006.3899	observed fractions of core-collapse supernova types and initial masses  of their single and binary progenitor stars	we analyse observed fractions of core-collapse sn types from the lickobservatory sn search, and we discuss corresponding implications for massivestar evolution. for a standard imf, observed fractions of sn types cannot bereconciled with expectations of single-star evolution. the mass range of wrstars that shed their h envelopes via their own mass loss accounts for lessthan half the observed fraction of sneibc. progenitors of sneibc must extend toa much lower range of initial masses than classical wr stars, and we argue thatmost snibc and sniib progenitors must arise from binary roche-lobe overflow.sneic still trace higher mass and metallicity, because line-driven winds in thewr stage remove the he layer and propel the transition from snib to ic. lessmassive progenitors of sneib and iib may not be classical wr stars; they may beunderluminous with weak winds, possibly hidden by overluminous mass-gainercompanions that appear as b[e] supergiants or related objects having asphericalcircumstellar material. the remaining sn types (ii-p, ii-l, and iin) areredistributed across the full range of initial mass. we consider directcollapse to black holes without visible sne, but find this problematic. majorareas of remaining uncertainty are (1) the influence of binary separation,rotation, and metallicity, (2) mass differences in progenitors of sneiincompared to sneii-l and ii-p, and (3) sneic arising from single stars witheruptive mass loss, its dependence on metallicity, and how it relates todiversity within the snic subclass.

1012.4009	the optical afterglow and z=0.92 early-type host galaxy of the short grb  100117a	we present the discovery of the optical afterglow and early-type host galaxyof the short-duration grb 100117a. the faint afterglow is detected 8.3 hr afterthe burst with r_ab = 25.46 +/- 0.20 mag. follow-up optical and near-irobservations uncover a coincident compact red galaxy, identified as anearly-type galaxy at a photometric redshift of z~0.6-0.9 (2-sigma) with a massof 3x10^10 m_sun, an age of ~1 gyr, and a luminosity of l_b~0.5l_star.spectroscopic observations of the host reveal a notable break corresponding tothe balmer 4000-angstrom break at z~0.9, and stellar population spectralevolution template fits indicate z~0.915, which we adopt as the redshift of thehost, with stellar population ages of ~1-3 gyr. from a possible weak detectionof [oii]-3727 emission at z=0.915 we infer an upper bound on the star formationrate of ~0.1 m_sun per yr, leading to a specific star formation rate of &lt;0.004per gyr. thus, grb 100117a is only the second short burst to date with a secureearly-type host (the other being grb 050724 at z=0.257) and it has one of thehighest short grb redshifts. the offset between the host center and the burstposition, 470 +/- 310 pc, is the smallest to date. combined with the oldstellar population age, this indicates that the burst likely originated from aprogenitor with no significant kick velocity. however, from the brightness ofthe optical afterglow we infer a relatively low density of n~3x10^-4 cm^-3 whenepsilon_e and epsilon_b = 0.1. the combination of an optically faint afterglowand host suggest that previous such events may have been missed, therebypotentially biasing the known short grb host population against z&gt;1 early-typehosts.

1101.1298	peculiar type ii supernovae from blue supergiants	the vast majority of type ii supernovae (sne) are produced by red supergiants(rsgs), but sn 1987a revealed that blue supergiants (bsgs) can produce membersof this class as well, albeit with some peculiar properties. this best studiedevent revolutionized our understanding of sne, and linking it to the bulk oftype ii events is essential. we present here optical photometry andspectroscopy gathered for sn 2000cb, which is clearly not a standard type ii snand yet is not a sn 1987a analog. the light curve of sn 2000cb is reminiscentof that of sn 1987a in shape, with a slow rise to a late optical peak, but onsubstantially different time scales. spectroscopically, sn 2000cb resembles anormal sn ii but with ejecta velocities that far exceed those measured for sn1987a or normal sne ii, above 18000 km/s for h-alpha at early times. the redcolours, high velocities, late photometric peak, and our modeling of thisobject all point toward a scenario involving the high-energy explosion of asmall-radius star, most likely a bsg, producing 0.1 solar masses of ni-56.adding a similar object to the sample, sn 2005ci, we derive a rate of about 2%of the core-collapse rate for this loosely defined class of bsg explosions.

0709.3258	the dual-axis circumstellar environment of the type iin supernova 1997eg	we present multi-epoch spectral and spectropolarimetric observations of thetype iin supernova (sn) 1997eg that indicate the presence of a flatteneddisk-like concentration of circumstellar material surrounding nonsphericalejecta, with which the disk is misaligned. the polarization across the broad halpha, h beta, and he i 5876 lines of sn 1997eg forms closed loops when viewedin the stokes q-u plane. such loops occur when the geometrical symmetry of oneor both of the stokes parameters across spectral lines is broken, in this casemost likely by occultation of the ejecta by the equatorial circumstellar matterconcentration. the polarization of the narrow balmer lines possesses anintrinsic axis that differs by 12 degrees from that of the elongated ejecta andprobably indicates the orientation of the disk-like circumstellar material. theexistence of two different axes of symmetry in sn 1997eg suggests that neitherrotation of the progenitor nor the influence of a companion star can be thesole mechanism creating a preferred axis within the supernova system. our modelsupports the emerging hypothesis that the progenitors of some type iinsupernovae are luminous blue variable stars, whose pre-supernova mass eruptionsform the circumstellar shells that physically characterize the sn iin subclass.these conclusions, which are independent of interstellar polarization effects,would have been unobservable with only a single epoch of spectropolarimetry.

1202.3140	the low-velocity, rapidly fading type ia supernova 2002es	sn 2002es is a peculiar subluminous type ia supernova (sn ia) with acombination of observed characteristics never before seen in a sn ia. atmaximum light, sn 2002es shares spectroscopic properties with the underluminoussn 1991bg subclass of sne ia, but with substantially lower expansion velocities(~6000 km/s) more typical of the sn 2002cx subclass. photometrically, sn 2002esdiffers from both sn 1991bg-like and sn 2002cx-like supernovae. although atmaximum light it is subluminous (m_b=-17.78 mag), sn 2002es has a relativelybroad light curve (dm15(b)=1.28 +/- 0.04 mag), making it a significant outlierin the light-curve width vs. luminosity relationship. we estimate a 56ni massof 0.17 +/- 0.05 m_sun synthesized in the explosion, relatively low for a snia. one month after maximum light, we find an unexpected plummet in thebolometric luminosity. the late-time decay of the light curves is inconsistentwith our estimated 56ni mass, indicating that either the light curve was notcompletely powered by 56ni decay or the ejecta became optically thin togamma-rays within a month after maximum light. the host galaxy is classified asan s0 galaxy with little to no star formation, indicating the progenitor of sn2002es is likely from an old stellar population. we also present a lessextensive dataset for sn 1999bh, an object which shares similar observedproperties. both objects were found as part of the lick observatory supernovasearch, allowing us to estimate that these objects should account for ~2.5% ofsne ia within a fixed volume. we find that current theoretical models areunable to explain the observed of characteristics of sn 2002es.

1206.2643	a spectroscopic study of type ibc supernova host galaxies from  untargeted surveys	we present the largest spectroscopic study of the host environments of typeibc supernovae (sn ibc) discovered exclusively by untargeted sn searches. paststudies of sn ibc host environments have been biased towards high-mass,high-metallicity galaxies by focusing on sne discovered in galaxy-targeted snsearches. our new observations more than double the total number ofspectroscopic stellar population age and metallicity measurements published foruntargeted sn ibc host environments, and extend to a median redshift abouttwice as large as previous statistical studies (z = 0.04). for the 12 sne iband 21 sne ic in our metallicity sample, we find median metallicities oflog(o/h)+12 = 8.48 and 8.61, respectively, but determine that the discrepancyin the full distribution of metallicities is not statistically significant.this median difference would correspond to only a small difference in the massloss via metal-line driven winds (&lt;30%), suggesting this does not play thedominant role in distinguishing sn ib and ic progenitors. however, the medianmetallicity of the 7 broad-lined sn ic (sn ic-bl) in our sample issignificantly lower, log(o/h)+12 = 8.34. the age of the young stellarpopulation of sn ic-bl host environments also seems to be lower than for sn iband ic, but our age sample is small. a synthesis of sn ibc host environmentspectroscopy to date does not reveal a significant difference in sn ib and icmetallicities, but reinforces the significance of the lower metallicities forsn ic-bl. this combined sample demonstrates that galaxy-targeted sn searchesintroduce a significant bias for studies seeking to infer the metallicitydistribution of sn progenitors, and we identify and discuss other systematiceffects that play smaller roles. we discuss the path forward for makingprogress on sn ibc progenitor studies in the lsst era.

1207.4200	host galaxy properties of the subluminous grb 120422a/sn 2012bz	grb 120422a is a nearby (z = 0.283) long-duration grb (lgrb) detected byswift with e(gamma,iso) ~ 4.5\times1049 erg. it is also associated with thespectroscopically-confirmed broad-lined type ic sn 2012bz. these propertiesestablish grb 120422a/sn 2012bz as the sixth and newest member of the class ofsubluminous grb/sne. observations also show that grb 120422a/sn 2012bz occurredat an unusually large offset (~8 kpc) from the host galaxy nucleus, setting itapart from other nearby lgrbs and leading to speculation that the hostenvironment may have undergone prior interaction activity. here we presentspectroscopic observations using the 6.5m magellan telescope at las campanas.we extract spectra at three specific locations within the grb/sn host galaxy,including the host nucleus, the explosion site, and the "bridge" of diffuseemission connecting these two regions. we measure a metallicity of log(o/h) +12 = 8.3 +/- 0.1 and a star formation rate per unit area of 0.08 mo/yr/kpc^2 atthe host nucleus. at the grb/sn explosion site we measure a comparablemetallicity of log(o/h) + 12 = 8.2 +/- 0.1, but find a much lower starformation rate per unit area of 0.01 m/yr/kpc^2. we also compare the hostgalaxy of this event to the hosts other lgrbs, including samples of subluminouslgrbs and cosmological lgrbs, and find no systematic metallicity differencebetween the environments of these different subtypes.

1301.3912	the host-galaxy response to the afterglow of grb 100901a	for gamma-ray burst 100901a, we have obtained gemini-north and very largetelescope optical afterglow spectra at four epochs: one hour, one day, threedays and one week after the burst, thanks to the afterglow remaining unusuallybright at late times. apart from a wealth of metal resonance lines, we alsodetect lines arising from fine-structure levels of the ground state of fe ii,and from metastable levels of fe ii and ni ii at the host redshift (z =1.4084). these lines are found to vary significantly in time. the combinationof the data and modelling results shows that we detect the fall of the ni ii 4f9/2 metastable level population, which to date has not been observed. assumingthat the population of the excited states is due to the uv-radiation of theafterglow, we estimate an absorber distance of a few hundred pc. this appearsto be a typical value when compared to similar studies. we detect twointervening absorbers (z = 1.3147, 1.3179). despite the wide temporal range ofthe data, we do not see significant variation in the absorption lines of thesetwo intervening systems.

1302.0009	ps1-10afx at z=1.388: pan-starrs1 discovery of a new type of  superluminous supernova	we present the pan-starrs1 discovery of ps1-10afx, a uniquehydrogen-deficient superluminous supernova (slsn) at z=1.388. the light curvepeaked at z_p1=21.7 mag, making ps1-10afx comparable to the most luminous knownsne, with m_u = -22.3 mag. our extensive optical and nir observations indicatethat the bolometric light curve of ps1-10afx rose on the unusually fasttimescale of ~12 d to the extraordinary peak luminosity of 4.1e44 erg/s (m_bol= -22.8 mag) and subsequently faded rapidly. equally important, the sed isunusually red for a slsn, with a color temperature of 6800 k near maximumlight, in contrast to previous h-poor slsne, which are bright in the uv. thespectra more closely resemble those of a normal sn ic than any known slsn, witha photospheric velocity of 11,000 km/s and evidence for line blanketing in therest-frame uv. despite the fast rise, these parameters imply a very largeemitting radius (&gt;5e15 cm). we demonstrate that no existing theoretical modelcan satisfactorily explain this combination of properties: (i) a nickel-poweredlight curve cannot match the combination of high peak luminosity with the fasttimescale; (ii) models powered by the spindown energy of a rapidly-rotatingmagnetar predict significantly hotter and faster ejecta; and (iii) modelsinvoking shock breakout through a dense circumstellar medium cannot explain theobserved spectra or color evolution. the host galaxy is well detected inpre-explosion imaging with a luminosity near l*, a star formation rate of 15m_sun/yr, and is fairly massive (2e10 m_sun), with a stellar population age of1e8 yr, also in contrast to the dwarf hosts of known h-poor slsne. ps1-10afx isdistinct from known examples of slsne in its spectra, colors, light-curveshape, and host galaxy properties, suggesting that it resulted from a differentchannel than other hydrogen-poor slsne.

1302.3221	demographics of the galaxies hosting short-duration gamma-ray bursts	we present observations of the afterglows and host galaxies of threeshort-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs): 100625a, 101219a and 110112a. we findthat grb 100625a occurred in a z=0.452 early-type galaxy with a stellar mass of4.6e9 m_sun and a stellar population age of 0.7 gyr, and grb 101219a originatedin a star-forming galaxy at z=0.718 with a stellar mass of 1.4e9 m_sun, a starformation rate of 16 m_sun yr^-1, and a stellar population age of 50 myr. wealso report the discovery of the optical afterglow of grb 110112a, which lacksa coincident host galaxy to i&gt;26 mag and we cannot conclusively identify anyfield galaxy as a possible host. the bursts have inferred circumburst densitiesof ~1e-4-1 cm^-3, and isotropic-equivalent gamma-ray and kinetic energies of1e50-1e51 erg. these events highlight the diversity of galaxies that host shortgrbs. to quantify this diversity, we use the sample of 36 swift short grbs withrobust associations to an environment (~1/2 of 68 short bursts detected byswift to may 2012) and classify them as follows: late-type (50%), early-type(15%), inconclusive (20%), and host-less (lacking a coincident host galaxy tolimits of &gt;26 mag; 15%). to find likely ranges for the true late- andearly-type fractions, we assign each of the host-less bursts to the late- orearly-type category using probabilistic arguments, and consider the scenariothat all hosts in the inconclusive category are early-type galaxies to set anupper bound on the early-type fraction. the most likely ranges for the late-and early-type fractions are ~60-80% and ~20-40%, respectively. we find noclear trend between gamma-ray duration and host type, and no change to thefractions when excluding events recently claimed as possible contaminants fromthe long grb/collapsar population. our reported demographics are consistentwith a short grb rate driven by both stellar mass and star formation.

1304.0763	type ia supernovae strongly interacting with their circumstellar medium	owing to their utility for measurements of cosmic acceleration, type iasupernovae (sne) are perhaps the best-studied class of sne, yet the progenitorsystems of these explosions largely remain a mystery. a rare subclass of sne iashow evidence of strong interaction with their circumstellar medium (csm), andin particular, a hydrogen-rich csm; we refer to them as sne ia-csm. in thefirst systematic search for such systems, we have identified 16 sne ia-csm, andhere we present new spectra of 13 of them. six sne ia-csm have beenwell-studied previously, three were previously known but are analyzed in-depthfor the first time here, and seven are new discoveries from the palomartransient factory. the spectra of all sne ia-csm are dominated by h{\alpha}emission (with widths of ~2000 km/s) and exhibit large h{\alpha}/h{\beta}intensity ratios (perhaps due to collisional excitation of hydrogen via the snejecta overtaking slower-moving csm shells); moreover, they have an almostcomplete lack of he i emission. they also show possible evidence of dustformation through a decrease in the red wing of h{\alpha} 75-100 d past maximumbrightness, and nearly all sne ia-csm exhibit strong na i d absorption from thehost galaxy. the absolute magnitudes (uncorrected for host-galaxy extinction)of sne ia-csm are found to be -21.3 &lt;= m_r &lt;= -19 mag, and they also seem toshow ultraviolet emission at early times and strong infrared emission at latetimes (but no detected radio or x-ray emission). finally, the host galaxies ofsne ia-csm are all late-type spirals similar to the milky way, or dwarfirregulars like the large magellanic cloud, which implies that these objectscome from a relatively young stellar population. this work represents the mostdetailed analysis of the sn ia-csm class to date.

1306.3949	grb 130606a as a probe of the intergalactic medium and the interstellar  medium in a star-forming galaxy in the first gyr after the big bang	we present high signal-to-noise ratio gemini and mmt spectroscopy of theoptical afterglow of the gamma-ray burst (grb) 130606a at redshift z=5.913,discovered by swift. this is the first high-redshift grb afterglow to havespectra of comparable quality to those of z~6 quasars. the data exhibit asmooth continuum at near-infrared wavelengths that is sharply cut off bluewardof 8410 angs due to absorption from ly-alpha at redshift z~5.91, with some fluxtransmitted through the ly-alpha forest between 7000-7800 angs. we use columndensities inferred from metal absorption lines to constrain the metallicity ofthe host galaxy between a lower limit of [si/h]&gt;-1.7 and an upper limit of[s/h]&lt;-0.5 set by the non-detection of s ii absorption. we demonstrateconsistency between the dramatic evolution in the transmission fraction ofly-alpha seen in this spectrum over the redshift range z=4.9 to 5.85 with thatpreviously measured from observations of high-redshift quasars. there is anextended redshift interval of delta-z=0.12 in the ly-alpha forest at z=5.77with no detected transmission, leading to a 3-sigma upper limit on the meanly-alpha transmission fraction of &lt;0.2% (or tau_eff(ly-alpha) &gt; 6.4). this iscomparable to the lowest-redshift gunn-peterson troughs found in quasarspectra. we set a 2-sigma upper limit of 0.11 on the neutral fraction of theigm at the redshift of the grb from the lack of a ly-alpha red damping wing,assuming a model with a constant neutral density. some ly-beta and ly-gammatransmission is detected in this redshift window, indicating that it is notcompletely opaque, and hence that the igm is nonetheless mostly ionized atthese redshifts. grb 130606a thus for the first time realizes the promise ofgrbs as probes of the first galaxies and cosmic reionization.

1309.4457	hubble space telescope and ground-based observations of the type iax  supernovae sn 2005hk and sn 2008a	we present hubble space telescope (hst) and ground-based optical andnear-infrared observations of sn 2005hk and sn 2008a, typical members of thetype iax class of supernovae (sne). here we focus on late-time observations,where these objects deviate most dramatically from all other sn types. insteadof the dominant nebular emission lines that are observed in other sne at latephases, spectra of sne 2005hk and 2008a show lines of fe ii, ca ii, and fe imore than a year past maximum light, along with narrow [fe ii] and [ca ii]emission. we use spectral features to constrain the temperature and density ofthe ejecta, and find high densities at late times, with n_e &gt;~ 10^9 cm^-3. suchhigh densities should yield enhanced cooling of the ejecta, making theseobjects good candidates to observe the expected "infrared catastrophe," ageneric feature of sn ia models. however, our hst photometry of sn 2008a doesnot match the predictions of an infrared catastrophe. moreover, our hstobservations rule out a "complete deflagration" that fully disrupts the whitedwarf for these peculiar sne, showing no evidence for unburned material at latetimes. deflagration explosion models that leave behind a bound remnant canmatch some of the observed properties of sne iax, but no published model isconsistent with all of our observations of sne 2005hk and 2008a.

1309.7479	short grb 130603b: discovery of a jet break in the optical and radio  afterglows, and a mysterious late-time x-ray excess	we present radio, optical/nir, and x-ray observations of the afterglow of theshort-duration 130603b, and uncover a break in the radio and optical bands at0.5 d after the burst, best explained as a jet break with an inferred jetopening angle of 4-8 deg. grb 130603b is only the third short grb with a radioafterglow detection to date, and the first time that a jet break is evident inthe radio band. we model the temporal evolution of the spectral energydistribution to determine the burst explosion properties and find anisotropic-equivalent kinetic energy of (0.6-1.7) x 10^51 erg and a circumburstdensity of 5 x 10^-3-30 cm^-3. from the inferred opening angle of grb 130603b,we calculate beaming-corrected energies of egamma (0.5-2) x 10^49 erg and ek(0.1-1.6) x 10^49 erg. along with previous measurements and lower limits wefind a median short grb opening angle of 10 deg. using the all-sky observedrate of 10 gpc^-3 yr^-1, this implies a true short grb rate of 20 yr^-1 within200 mpc, the advanced ligo/virgo sensitivity range for neutron star binarymergers. finally, we uncover evidence for significant excess emission in thex-ray afterglow of grb 130603b at &gt;1 d and conclude that the additional energycomponent could be due to fall-back accretion or spin-down energy from amagnetar formed following the merger.

0801.4936	chemical abundances of the secondary star in the black hole x-ray binary  xte j1118+480	following the recent abundance measurements of mg, al, ca, fe, and ni in theblack hole x-ray binary xte j1118+480 using medium-resolution keck ii/esispectra of the secondary star (gonz\'alez hern\'andez et al. 2006), we performa detailed abundance analysis including the abundances of si and ti. theseelement abundances, higher than solar, indicate that the black hole in thissystem formed in a supernova event, whose nucleosynthetic products couldpollute the atmosphere of the secondary star, providing clues on the possibleformation region of the system, either galactic halo, thick disk, or thin disk.we explore a grid of explosion models with different he core masses,metallicities, and geometries. metal-poor models associated with a formationscenario in the galactic halo provide unacceptable fits to the observedabundances, allowing us to reject a halo origin for this x-ray binary. thethick-disk scenario produces better fits, although they require substantialfallback and very efficient mixing processes between the inner layers of theexplosion and the ejecta, making quite unlikely an origin in the thick disk.the best agreement between the model predictions and the observed abundances isobtained for metal-rich progenitor models. in particular, non-sphericallysymmetric models are able to explain, without strong assumptions of extensivefallback and mixing, the observed abundances. moreover, asymmetric massejection in a supernova explosion could account for the required impulsenecessary to launch the system from its formation region in the galactic thindisk to its current halo orbit.

1312.6617	high density circumstellar interaction in the luminous type iin sn  2010jl: the first 1100 days	hst and ground based observations of the type iin sn 2010jl are analyzed,including photometry, spectroscopy in the ultraviolet, optical and nir bands,26-1128 days after first detection. at maximum the bolometric luminosity was$\sim 3\times10^{43}$ erg/s and even at 850 days exceeds $10^{42}$ erg/s. a nirexcess, dominating after 400 days, probably originates in dust in thecircumstellar medium (csm). the total radiated energy is $&gt; 6.5\times10^{50}$ergs, excluding the dust component. the spectral lines can be separated intoone broad component due to electron scattering, and one narrow with expansionvelocity $\sim 100$ km/s from the csm. the broad component is initiallysymmetric around zero velocity but becomes blueshifted after $\sim 50$ days,while remaining symmetric about a shifted centroid velocity. dust absorption inthe ejecta is unlikely to explain the line shifts, and we attribute the shiftinstead to acceleration by the sn radiation. from the optical lines and thex-ray and dust properties, there is strong evidence for large scale asymmetriesin the csm. the ultraviolet lines indicate cno processing in the progenitor,while the optical shows a number of narrow coronal lines excited by the x-rays.the bolometric light curve is consistent with a radiative shock in an $r^{-2}$csm with a mass loss rate of $\sim 0.1$ m_sun/yr. the total mass lost is $&gt; 3$m_sun. these properties are consistent with the sn expanding into a csmcharacteristic of an lbv progenitor with a bipolar geometry. the apparentabsence of nuclear processing is attributed to a csm still opaque to electronscattering.

1406.2828	optical observations of the type ic supernova 2007gr in ngc 1058 and  implications for the properties of its progenitor	we present extensive optical observations of the normal type ic supernova(sn) 2007gr, spanning from about one week before maximum light to more than oneyear thereafter. the optical light and color curves of sn 2007gr are verysimilar to those of the broad-lined type ic sn 2002ap, but the spectra showremarkable differences. the optical spectra of sn 2007gr are characterized byunusually narrow lines, prominent carbon lines, and slow evolution of the linevelocity after maximum light. the earliest spectrum (taken at t=-8 days) showsa possible signature of helium (he~i 5876 at a velocity of ~19,000 km s{-1}).moreover, the larger intensity ratio of the [o i] 6300 and 6364 lines inferredfrom the early nebular spectra implies a lower opacity of the ejecta shortlyafter the explosion. these results indicate that sn 2007gr perhaps underwent aless energetic explosion of a smaller-mass wolf-rayet star (~ 8--9 msun) in abinary system, as favored by an analysis of the progenitor environment throughpre-explosion and post-explosion hubble space telescope images. in the nebularspectra, asymmetric double-peaked profiles can be seen in the [o~i] 6300 andmg~i] 4571 lines. we suggest that the two peaks are contributed by theblueshifted and rest-frame components. the similarity in velocity structure andthe different evolution of the strength of the two components favor anaspherical explosion with the ejecta distributed in a torus or disk-likegeometry, but inside the ejecta the o and mg have different distributions.

0804.0042	sn 2006tf: precursor eruptions and the optically thick regime of  extremely luminous type iin supernovae	sn2006tf is the third most luminous sn discovered so far, after sn2005ap andsn2006gy. sn2006tf is valuable because it provides a link between two regimes:(1) luminous type iin supernovae powered by emission directly from interactionwith circumstellar material (csm), and (2) the most extremely luminous snewhere the csm interaction is so optically thick that energy must diffuse outfrom an opaque shocked shell. as sn2006tf evolves, it slowly transitions fromthe second to the first regime as the clumpy shell becomes more porous. thislink suggests that the range in properties of the most luminous sne is largelydetermined by the density and speed of h-rich material ejected shortly beforethey explode. the total energy radiated by sn2006tf was at least 7e50 ergs. ifthe bulk of this luminosity came from the thermalization of shock kineticenergy, then the star needs to have ejected ~18 msun in the 4-8 yr before corecollapse, and another 2-6 msun in the decades before that. a type ia explosionis therefore excluded. from the h-alpha emission-line profile, we derive ablast-wave speed of 2,000 km/s that does not decelerate, and from the narrow pcygni absorption from pre-shock gas we deduce that the progenitor's wind speedwas ~190 km/s. this is reminiscent of the wind speeds of lbvs, but not of rsgsor wr stars. we propose that like sn2006gy, sn2006tf marked the death of a verymassive star that retained its h envelope until the end of its life, andsuffered extreme lbv-like mass loss in the decades before it exploded.

astro-ph;0001270	helium emission in the type ic sn 1999cq	we present the first unambiguous detection of helium emission lines inspectra of type ic supernovae (sne ic). the presence of he i lines, with fullwidth at half maximum ~ 2000 km/s, and the distinct absence of any otherintermediate-width emission (e.g., halpha), implies that the ejecta of sn ic1999cq are interacting with dense circumstellar material composed of almostpure helium. this strengthens the argument that the progenitors of sne ic arecore-collapse events in stars that have lost both their hydrogen and heliumenvelopes, either through a dense wind or mass-transfer to a companion. in thisway, sn 1999cq is similar to supernovae such as sn 1987k and sn 1993j thathelped firmly establish a physical connection between type ib and type iisupernovae. the light curve of sn 1999cq is very fast, with an extremely rapidrise followed by a quick decline. sn 1999cq is also found to exhibit a highlevel of emission at blue wavelengths (&lt; 5500 a), likely resulting from eitheran unusually large amount of iron and iron-group element emission oruncharacteristically low reddening compared with other sne ic.

astro-ph;0206368	photospheric-phase spectropolarimetry and nebular-phase spectroscopy of  the peculiar type ic supernova 2002ap	the early-time optical spectrum of the type ic supernova (sn) 2002ap wascharacterized by unusually broad features, leading some authors to designate ita "hypernova." we present optical spectropolarimetry of this object 16 and 37days after the estimated date of explosion. after correcting for interstellarpolarization, we find evidence for a high level of intrinsic continuumpolarization at both epochs: p &gt;~ 1.3% on day 16 and p &gt;~ 1.0% on day 37.prominent line polarization is also seen, especially in the trough of the ca iinear-infrared triplet during the second epoch. when interpreted in terms of theoblate, electron-scattering model atmospheres of hoeflich (1991), our resultsimply an asymmetry of at least 20% (day 16) and 17% (day 37). the data suggesta fair degree of axisymmetry, although the polarization angle of the dominantpolarization axes are different by about 55 deg. between the two epochs,implying a complex morphology for the thinning ejecta. in particular, thereexists some spectropolarimetric evidence for a different distribution of carelative to iron-group elements. we also present flux spectra of sn 2002aptaken 131 and 140 days after the explosion. the spectra are characterized by avery weak continuum and broad emission lines, indicating that sn 2002ap hasentered the nebular phase. the spectral features are substantially similar tothose of ``normal'' sne ic in the nebular phase, and the emission lines are notsignificantly broader. however, some of the broad lines are very sharplypeaked, and may possess a narrow component (probably unresolved by our spectra,fwhm &lt;~ 400 km/s that is redshifted by ~ 580$ km/s with respect to the systemicvelocity of the host galaxy.

astro-ph;0207601	a study of the type ii-plateau supernova 1999gi, and the distance to its  host galaxy, ngc 3184	we present optical spectra and photometry sampling the first six months afterdiscovery of supernova (sn) 1999gi in ngc 3184. sn 1999gi is shown to be a typeii-plateau event with a photometric plateau lasting until about 100 days afterdiscovery. the reddening values resulting from five independent techniques areall consistent with an upper bound of e(b-v) &lt; 0.45 mag established bycomparing the early-time color of sn 1999gi with that of an infinitely hotblackbody, and yield a probable reddening of e(b-v) = 0.21 +/- 0.09 mag. usingthe expanding photosphere method (epm), we derive a distance to sn 1999gi of11.1^{+2.0}_{-1.8} mpc and an explosion date of 1999 december5.8^{+3.0}_{-3.1}, or 4.1^{+3.0}_{-3.1} days prior to discovery. this distanceis consistent with a recent tully-fisher distance derived to ngc 3184 (d ~11.59 mpc), but is somewhat closer than the cepheid distances derived to twogalaxies that have generally been assumed to be members of a small groupcontaining ngc 3184 (ngc 3319, d = 13.30 +/- 0.55 mpc, and ngc 3198, d = 13.80+/- 0.51 mpc).  we reconsider the upper mass limit (9^{+3}_{-2} m_{sun}) recently placed onthe progenitor star of sn 1999gi by smartt et al. (2001, 2002) in light ofthese results. following the same procedures, but using the new data presentedhere, we arrive at a less restrictive upper mass limit of 15^{+5}_{-3} m_{sun}for the progenitor. the increased upper limit results mainly from the largerdistance derived through the epm than was assumed by the smartt et al.analyses, which relied on less precise (and less recent) distance measurementsto ngc 3184.

astro-ph;0208101	evidence for extremely high dust polarization efficiency in ngc 3184	recent studies have found the type ii-plateau supernova (sn) 1999gi to behighly polarized (p_max = 5.8%, where p_max is the highest degree ofpolarization measured in the optical bandpass; leonard &amp; filippenko 2001) andminimally reddened (e[b-v] = 0.21 +/- 0.09 mag; leonard et al. 2002). frommultiple lines of evidence, including the convincing fit of a ``serkowski''interstellar polarization (isp) curve to the continuum polarization shape, weconclude that the bulk of the observed polarization is likely due to dust alongthe line of sight (l-o-s), and is not intrinsic to sn 1999gi. we present newspectropolarimetric observations of four distant galactic stars close to thel-o-s to sn 1999gi (two are within 0.02 degrees), and find that all are null towithin 0.2%, effectively eliminating galactic dust as the cause of the highpolarization. the high isp coupled with the low reddening implies anextraordinarily high polarization efficiency for the dust along this l-o-s inngc 3184: isp / e(b-v) = 31^{+22}_{-9} % mag^{-1}. this is inconsistent withthe empirical galactic limit (isp / e[b-v] &lt; 9% mag^{-1}), and represents thehighest polarization efficiency yet confirmed for a single sight line in eitherthe milky way or an external galaxy.

astro-ph;0303616	grb 021004: a possible shell nebula around a wolf-rayet star gamma-ray  burst progenitor	the rapid localization of grb 021004 by the hete-2 satellite allowed nearlycontinuous monitoring of its early optical afterglow decay, as well ashigh-quality optical spectra that determined a redshift of z3=2.328 for itshost galaxy, an active starburst galaxy with strong lyman-alpha emission andseveral absorption lines. spectral observations show multiple absorbers atz3a=2.323, z3b= 2.317, and z3c= 2.293 blueshifted by 450, 990, and 3,155 km/srespectively relative to the host galaxy lyman-alpha emission. we argue thatthese correspond to a fragmented shell nebula that has been radiativelyaccelerated by the gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglow at a distance greater than0.3 pc from a wolf-rayet star progenitor. the chemical abundance ratiosindicate that the nebula is overabundant in carbon and silicon. the high levelof carbon and silicon is consistent with a swept-up shell nebula graduallyenriched by a wcl progenitor wind over the lifetime of the nebula prior to thegrb onset. the detection of statistically significant fluctuations and colorchanges about the jet-like optical decay further supports this interpretationsince fluctuations must be present at some level due to inhomogeneities in aclumpy stellar wind medium or if the progenitor has undergone massive ejectionprior to the grb onset. this evidence suggests that the mass-loss process in awolf-rayet star might lead naturally to an iron-core collapse with sufficientangular momentum that could serve as a suitable grb progenitor.

0811.3929	sn 2008s: a cool super-eddington wind in a supernova impostor	we present visual-wavelength photometry and spectroscopy of supernovasn2008s. based on the low peak luminosity for a sn of m_r = -13.9 mag,photometric and spectral evolution unlike that of low-luminosity sne, alate-time decline rate slower than 56co decay, and slow outflow speeds of600-1000 km/s, we conclude that sn2008s is not a true core-collapse sn and isprobably not an electron-capture sn. instead, we show that sn2008s more closelyresembles a "sn impostor" event like sn1997bs, analogous to the giant eruptionsof lbvs. its total radiated energy was 1e47.8 ergs, and it may have ejected0.05-0.2 msun in the event. we discover an uncanny similarity between thespectrum of sn 2008s and that of the galactic hypergiant irc+10420, which isdominated by narrow h-alpha, [ca ii], and ca ii emission lines formed in anopaque wind. we propose a scenario where the vastly super-eddington wind ofsn2008s partly fails because of reduced opacity due to recombination, assuggested for irc+10420. the range of initial masses susceptible to eruptivelbv-like mass loss was known to extend down to 20-25 msun, but estimates forthe progenitor of sn2008s (and the similar ngc300 transient) may extend thisrange to around 15 msun. as such, sn2008s may have implications for theprogenitor of sn1987a.
