0905.1041	a suzaku observation of the ulirg iras19254-7245: disclosing the agn  component	we discuss here a long suzaku observation of iras 19254-7245 (also known asthe superantennae), one of the brightest and well studied ultra luminousinfrared galaxies in the local universe. this long observation provided thefirst detection of iras 19254-7245 above 10 kev, and measured a 15-30 kev fluxof ~5x10^(-12) erg cm^-2 s^-1. the detection above 10 kev has allowed us tounveil, for the first time, the intrinsic luminosity of the agn hosted in iras19254-7245, which is strongly absorbed (nh ~ 3x10^(24) cm^-2) and has anintrinsic luminosity in the qso regime (l(2-10 kev) ~ 3 x 10^(44) erg s^-1).the 2-10 kev spectrum of iras 19254-7245 is remarkably hard (gamma~1.2), andpresents a strong iron line (ew ~0.7 kev), clearly suggesting that below 10 kevwe are seeing only reprocessed radiation. since the energy of the fe k emissionis found to be at ~6.7 kev, consistent with he-like fe, and its ew is too highto be explained in a starburst dominated scenario, we suggest that the 2--10kev emission of iras 19254-7245 is dominated by reflection/scattering fromhighly ionized matter. indeed, within this latter scenario we found that thephoton index of the illuminating source is gamma=1.87 (+0.11,-0.28), inexcellent agreement with the mean value found for radio quiet unobscured agn.

0906.0312	a compton-thick wind in the high luminosity quasar, pds 456	pds 456 is a nearby (z=0.184), luminous (l_bol ~10^47 erg/s) type i quasar. adeep 190 ks suzaku observation in february 2007 revealed the complex, broadband x-ray spectrum of pds 456. the suzaku spectrum exhibits highlystatistically significant absorption features near 9 kev in the quasarrest--frame. we show that the most plausible origin of the absorption is fromblue-shifted resonance (1s-2p) transitions of hydrogen-like iron (at 6.97 kevin the rest frame). this indicates that a highly ionized outflow may be presentmoving at near relativistic velocities (~0.25c). a possible hard x-ray excessis detected above 15 kev with hxd (at 99.8% confidence), which may arise fromhigh column density gas (nh&gt;10^24cm^-2) partially covering the x-ray emission,or through strong compton reflection. here we propose that the iron k-shellabsorption in pds 456 is associated with a thick, possibly clumpy outflow,covering about 20% of $4\pi$ steradian solid angle. the outflow is likelylaunched from the inner accretion disk, within 15-100 gravitational radii ofthe black hole. the kinetic power of the outflow may be similar to thebolometric luminosity of pds 456. such a powerful wind could have a significanteffect on the co-evolution of the host galaxy and its supermassive black hole,through feedback.

0906.0799	structure of the accretion flow in broad-line radio galaxies: the case  of 3c390.3	we present xmm and suzaku observations of the broad-line radio galaxy (blrg)3c390.3. the fe ka line has a width fwhm ~ 8,800 km/s, consistent within afactor two with the width of the double-peaked h_alpha line, suggesting anorigin from the broad line region. the data show for the first time a weak,broad bump extending from 5 to 7 kev. when fitted with a gaussian, its centroidenergy is 6.6 kev in the source's rest-frame with fwhm of 43,000 km/s and ew of50 ev; its most likely interpretation is emission from he-like fe (fe xxv),suggesting the presence of an ionized medium in the inner regions of 3c390.3.the broad-band 0.5-100 kev continuum is well described by a single power lawwith photon index gamma=1.6 and cutoff energy 157 kev, plus cold reflectionwith strength r=0.5. in addition, ionized reflection is required to account forthe 6.6 kev bump in the broad-band continuum, yielding an ionization parameterxi ~ 2700 ergs cm s^-1; the inner radius of the ionized reflector isconstrained to be larger than 20 r_g, although this result depends on theassumed emissivity profile of the disk. if true, we argue that the lack ofbroad fe k emission from within 20 r_g indicates that the innermost regions ofthe disk in 3c390.3 are obscured and/or poorly illuminated. while the sed of3c390.3 is generally dominated by accretion-related continuum, during accretionlow states the jet can significantly contribute in the optical to x-ray bandsvia synchrotron self-compton emission.

0907.3114	the absorption-dominated model for the x-ray spectra of type i active  galaxies: mcg-6-30-15	mcg-6-30-15 is the archetypal example of a type i active galaxy showing broad"red-wing" emission in its x-ray spectrum at energies below the 6.4 kev fek-alpha emission line and a continuum excess above 20 kev. miller et al. (2008)showed that these spectral features could be caused by clumpy absorbingmaterial, but reynolds et al. (2009) have argued that the observed fe k-alphaline luminosity is inconsistent with this explanation unless the globalcovering factor of the absorber(s) is very low. however, the reynolds et al.calculation effectively considers the only source of opacity to be the fe kbound-free transition and neglects the opacity at the line energy: correctionto realistic opacity decreases the predicted line flux by a large factor. wealso discuss the interpretation of the covering factor and the possible effectof occultation by the accretion disk. finally, we consider a model formcg-6-30-15 dominated by clumpy absorption, which is consistent with globalcovering factor 0.45, although models that include the effects of comptonscattering are required to reach a full understanding. variations in coveringfraction may dominate the observed x-ray spectral variability.

0908.0716	short-term variability and psd analysis of the radio-loud agn 3c 390.3	we investigate the short-term variability properties and the power spectraldensity (psd) of the broad-line radio galaxy (blrg) 3c 390.3 using observationsmade by xmm, rxte, and suzaku on several occasions between october 2004 anddecember 2006. the main aim of this work is to derive model-independentconstraints on the origin of the x-ray emission and on the nature of thecentral engine in 3c 390.3. on timescales of the order of few hours, probed byuninterrupted xmm light curves, the flux of 3c 390.3 is consistent with beingconstant in all energy bands. on longer timescales, probed by the 2-day rxteand suzaku observations, the flux variability becomes significant. the latterobservation confirms that the spectral variability behavior of 3c 390.3 isconsistent with the spectral evolution observed in radio-quiet seyfertgalaxies: the spectrum softens as the source brightens. the correlatedvariability between soft and hard x-rays, observed during the suzaku exposureand between the 2 xmm pointings, taken 1 week apart, argues against scenarioscharacterized by the presence of two distinct variable components in the 0.5-10kev x-ray band. a detailed psd analysis carried out over five decades infrequency suggests the presence of a break at t_br~43 days at a 92% confidencelevel. this is the second tentative detection of a psd break in a radio-loud,non-jet dominated agn, after the blrg 3c120, and appears to be in generalagreement with the relation between t_br, m_bh, and l_bol, followed by seyfertgalaxies. our results indicate that the x-ray variability properties of 3c390.3 are broadly consistent with those of radio-quiet agn, suggesting that thex-ray emission mechanism in 3c 390.3 is similar to that of nearby seyfertgalaxies without any significant contribution from a jet component.

0910.1110	a suzaku observation of ngc 4593: illuminating the truncated disk	we report results from a 2007 suzaku observation of the seyfert 1 agn ngc4593. the narrow fe k alpha emission line has a fwhm width ~4000 km/s,indicating emission from &gt;~ 5000 rg. there is no evidence for arelativistically broadened fe k line, consistent with the presence of aradiatively efficient outer disk which is truncated or transitions to aninterior radiatively inefficient flow. the suzaku observation caught the sourcein a low-flux state; compared to a 2002 xmm observation, the hard x-ray fluxdecreased by 3.6, while the fe k alpha line intensity and width each roughlyhalved. two model-dependent explanations for the changes in fe line profile areexplored. in one, the fe line width has decreased from ~10000 to ~4000 km/sfrom 2002 to 2007, suggesting that the thin disk truncation/transition radiushas increased from 1000-2000 to &gt;~5000 rg. however, there are indications fromother compact accreting systems that such truncation radii tend to beassociated only with accretion rates relative to eddington much lower than thatof ngc 4593. in the second (preferred) model, the line profile in the xmmobservation consists of a time-invariant narrow component plus a broadcomponent originating from the inner part of the truncated disk (~300 rg) whichhas responded to the drop in continuum flux. the compton reflection componentstrength r is ~1.1, consistent with the measured fe k alpha line total eqw withan fe abundance 1.7 times solar. the modest soft excess has fallen by a factorof ~20 from 2002 to 2007, ruling out emission from a region 5 lt-yr in size.

0910.5365	a correlation between the spectral and timing properties of agn	we present the results from a combined study of the average x-ray spectraland timing properties of 14 nearby agn. for 11 of the sources in the sample, weused all the available data from the rxte archive, which were taken until theend of 2006. there are 7795 rxte observations in total for these agn, obtainedover a period of ~7-11 years. we extracted their 3-20 kev spectra and fittedthem with a simple power-law model, modified by the presence of a gaussian line(at 6.4 kev) and cold absorption, when necessary. we used these best-fit slopesto estimate the mean spectral slope for each object, while we used results fromthe literature to estimate the average spectral slope of the three objectswithout archival, monitorin rxte data. our results show that the agn averagespectral slopes are not correlated either with the black hole mass or thecharacteristic frequencies that were detected in the power spectra.they arepositively correlated, though, with the characteristic frequency whennormalised to the sources black hole mass. this is similar to thespectral-timing correlation that has been observed in cyg x-1, but not thesame.the agn spectral-timing correlation can be explained if we assume that theaccretion rate determines both the average spectral slope and thecharacteristic time scales in agn. the spectrum should steepen and thecharacteristic frequency should increase, proportionally, with increasingaccretion rate. we also provide a quantitative expression between spectralslope and accretion rate. thermal comptonisation models are broadly consistentwith our result, but only if the ratio of the soft photons' luminosity to thepower injected to the hot corona is proportionally related to the accretionrate.

0912.0456	spectral variability and reverberation time delays in the suzaku x-ray  spectrum of ngc 4051	long-exposure suzaku x-ray observations of the active galaxy ngc 4051 from2005 and 2008 are analysed, in an attempt to reach a self-consistentunderstanding of the spectral variability on long timescales and at high timeresolution. principal components analysis and a maximum likelihood method ofpower spectrum analysis are used. in common with other type i agn, the spectralvariability is dominated by a varying-normalisation power-law componenttogether with a quasi-steady, hard-spectrum offset component that contains fe katomic features. ngc 4051 displays a strong excess over a power-law at energiesabove 20 kev, some fraction of which also appears to vary with the power-lawcontinuum. the fast-timescale power spectrum has a shape consistent withprevious determinations, but significant differences are found between the lowand high flux states of the source, demonstrating that the power spectrum isnon-stationary. frequency-dependent time lags between the hard and soft bandsof up to 970+/-225s are measured. the existence of the observed lags excludesthe possibility that the hard spectral component originates as reflection fromthe inner accretion disk. we instead show that the frequency- andenergy-dependent time lags may be explained as reverberation, caused byreflection from a thick shell of material with maximum lags of about 10,000s.if the reflecting material surrounds the agn, it extends to a distance about1.5x10^14 cm, 600 gravitational radii, from the illuminating source and theglobal covering factor is c(g) &gt;~ 0.4, confirming suggestions that type i agnhave high covering factors of absorbing and reflecting material. given thespectral and timing similarities with other type i agn, we infer that thisstructure is common in the type i population.

0707.2950	relativistic iron k emission and absorption in the seyfert 1.9 galaxy  mcg-5-23-16	we present the results of the simultaneous deep xmm and chandra observationsof the bright seyfert 1.9 galaxy mcg-5-23-16, which is thought to have one ofthe best known examples of a relativistically broadened iron k-alpha line. thetime averaged spectral analysis shows that the iron k-shell complex is bestmodeled with an unresolved narrow emission component (fwhm &lt; 5000 km/s, ew ~ 60ev) plus a broad component. this latter component has fwhm ~ 44000 km/s and ew~ 50 ev. its profile is well described by an emission line originating from anaccretion disk viewed with an inclination angle ~ 40^\circ and with theemission arising from within a few tens of gravitational radii of the centralblack hole. the time-resolved spectral analysis of the xmm epic-pn spectrumshows that both the narrow and broad components of the fe k emission lineappear to be constant in time within the errors. we detected a narrow sporadicabsorption line at 7.7 kev which appears to be variable on a time-scale of 20ksec. if associated with fe xxvi ly-alpha this absorption is indicative of apossibly variable, high ionization, high velocity outflow. the variability ofthis absorption feature appears to rule out a local (z=0) origin. the analysisof the xmm rgs spectrum reveals that the soft x-ray emission of mcg-5-23-16 islikely dominated by several emission lines superimposed on an unabsorbedscattered power-law continuum. the lack of strong fe l shell emission togetherwith the detection of a strong forbidden line in the o vii triplet isconsistent with a scenario where the soft x-ray emission lines are produced ina plasma photoionized by the nuclear emission.

1001.1339	suzaku monitoring of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc5548: warm absorber  location and its implication for cosmic feedback	(abridged) we present a two month suzaku x-ray monitoring of the seyfert 1galaxy ngc 5548. the campaign consists of 7 observations. we analyze theresponse in the opacity of the gas that forms the ionized absorber to ionizingflux variations. despite variations by a factor of 4 in the impingingcontinuum, the soft x-ray spectra of the source show little spectralvariations, suggesting no response from the ionized absorber. a detailed timemodeling confirms the lack of opacity variations for an absorbing componentwith high ionization. instead, the models tentatively suggest that theionization parameter of a low ionization absorbing component might be changingwith the ionizing flux, as expected for gas in photoionization equilibrium.using the lack of variations, we set an upper limit of n_e &lt;2.0e7 cm-3 for theelectron density of the gas forming the high ionization, high velocitycomponent. this implies a large distance from the continuum source (r &gt; 0.033pc). if the variations in the low ionization component are real, they imply n_e&gt;9.8e4 cm-3 and r &lt; 3 pc. we discuss our results in terms of two differentscenarios: a large scale outflow originating in the inner parts of theaccretion disk, or a thermally driven wind originating much farther out. giventhe large distance of the wind, the implied mass outflow rate is also large (mw&gt; 0.08 maccr). the associated total kinetic energy deployed by the wind in thehost galaxy (&gt;1.2e56 erg) can be enough to disrupt the interstellar medium,possibly regulating large scale star formation. the total mass and energyejected by the wind is still lower than the one required for cosmic feedback,even when extrapolated to quasar luminosities. such feedback would require thatwe are observing the wind before it is fully accelerated.

1002.0544	multi-dimensional modelling of x-ray spectra for agn accretion-disk  outflows ii	highly-ionized fast accretion-disk winds have been suggested as anexplanation for a variety of observed absorption and emission features in thex-ray spectra of active galactic nuclei. simple estimates have suggested thatthese flows may be massive enough to carry away a significant fraction of theaccretion energy and could be involved in creating the link betweensupermassive black holes and their host galaxies. however, testing thesehypotheses, and quantifying the outflow signatures, requires high-qualitytheoretical spectra for comparison with observations. here we describeextensions of our monte carlo radiative transfer code that allow us to generaterealistic theoretical spectra for a much wider variety of disk wind models thanpossible in our previous work. in particular, we have expanded the range ofatomic physics simulated by the code so that l- and m-shell ions can now beincluded. we have also substantially improved our treatment of both ionizationand radiative heating such that we are now able to compute spectra for outflowscontaining far more diverse plasma conditions. we present example calculationsthat illustrate the variety of spectral features predicted by parametrizedoutflow models and demonstrate their applicability to the interpretation ofdata by comparison with observations of the bright quasar pg1211+143. we findthat the major features in the observed 2 - 10 kev spectrum of this object canbe well-reproduced by our spectra, confirming that it likely hosts a massiveoutflow.

0708.1305	an xmm-newton survey of broad iron lines in seyfert galaxies	we present an analysis of the x-ray spectra of a sample of 37 observations of26 seyfert galaxies observed by xmm-newton in order to characterize their ironk emission. all objects show evidence for iron line emission in the 6-7 kevband. a narrow core at 6.4 kev is seen almost universally in the spectra, andwe model this using a neutral compton reflection component, assumed to beassociated with distant, optically thick material such as the molecular torus.once this, and absorption by a zone of ionized gas in the line-of-sight isaccounted for, less than half of the sample observations show an acceptablefit. approximately 2/3 of the sample shows evidence for further, broadenedemission in the iron k-band. when modeled with a gaussian, the inferred energyis close to that expected for neutral iron, with a slight redshift, with anaverage velocity width of ~0.1c. the mean parameters are consistent withprevious asca results and support the idea that the broad components can beassociated with the accretion disk. before proceeding to that conclusion, wetest an alternative model comprising a blend of 3-4 narrow, unshifted emissionlines (including the 6.4 kev core), together with 1-2 zones of highly ionizedgas in the line-of-sight. around 1/3 of the objects are not adequately fit bythis model, and in general better fits are obtained with a relativistic diskline model, which has fewer free parameters. nonetheless we find thatabsorption by ionized gas affects the spectrum above 2.5 kev in approximatelyhalf the sample. there is evidence for multiple ionized zones in at least 3objects, but in all those cases a blurred reflector is required in addition tothe complex absorption.

1006.3536	discovery of ultra-fast outflows in a sample of broad line radio  galaxies observed with suzaku	we present the results of a uniform and systematic search for blue-shifted fek absorption lines in the x-ray spectra of five bright broad-line radiogalaxies (blrgs) observed with suzaku. we detect, for the first time at x-raysin radio-loud agn, several absorption lines at energies greater than 7 kev inthree out of five sources, namely 3c 111, 3c 120 and 3c 390.3. the lines aredetected with high significance according to both the f-test and extensivemonte carlo simulations. their likely interpretation as blue-shifted fe xxv andfe xxvi k-shell resonance lines implies an origin from highly ionized gasoutflowing with mildly relativistic velocities, in the range 0.04-0.15c. a fitwith specific photo-ionization models gives ionization parameters in the rangelog_xi~4-5.6 and column densities of n_h~10^22-10^23 cm^-2. thesecharacteristics are very similar to those of the ultra-fast outflows (ufos)previously observed in radio-quiet agn. their estimated location within~0.01-0.3pc from the central super-massive black hole suggests a likely originrelated with accretion disk winds/outflows. depending on the absorber coveringfraction, the mass outflow rate of these ufos can be comparable to theaccretion rate and their kinetic power can correspond to a significant fractionof the bolometric luminosity and is comparable to their typical jet power.therefore, these ufos can play a significant role in the expected feedback fromthe agn on the surrounding environment and can give us further clues on therelation between the accretion disk and the formation of winds/jets in bothradio-quiet and radio-loud agn.

1010.2409	chandra high resolution spectroscopy of the circumnuclear matter in the  broad line radio galaxy 3c445	we present evidence for x-ray line emitting and absorbing gas in the nucleusof the broad-line radio galaxy (blrg), 3c 445. a 200ks chandra letg observationof 3c 445 reveals the presence of several highly ionized emission lines in thesoft x-ray spectrum, primarily from the he and h-like ions of o, ne, mg and si.radiative recombination emission is detected from o vii and o viii, indicatingthat the emitting gas is photoionized. the he-like emission appears to beresolved into forbidden and intercombination line components, which implies ahigh density of &gt;10^{10} cm^{-3}, while the oxygen lines are velocity broadenedwith a mean width of ~2600 km s^{-1} (fwhm). the density and widths of theionized lines indicate an origin of the gas on sub-parsec scales in the broadline region (blr).the x-ray continuum of 3c 445 is heavily obscured either by apartial coverer or by a photoionized absorber of column density n_{h}=2x10^{23}cm^{-2} and ionization parameter log(xi)=1.4 erg cm s^{-1}. however the view ofthe x-ray line emission is unobscured, which requires the absorber to belocated at radii well within any parsec scale molecular torus. instead, wesuggest that the x-ray absorber in 3c 445 may be associated with an outflowing,but clumpy, accretion disk wind with an observed outflow velocity of ~10000km/s.

1102.1894	contemporaneous chandra hetg and suzaku x-ray observations of ngc 4051	we present the results of a deep 300 ks chandra hetg observation of thehighly variable narrow-line seyfert type 1 galaxy ngc 4051. the hetg spectrumreveals 28 significant soft x-ray ionised lines in either emission orabsorption; primarily originating from h-like and he-like k-shell transitionsof o, ne, mg and si (including higher order lines and strong forbidden emissionlines from o vii and ne ix) plus high ionisation l-shell transitions from fexvii to fe xxii and lower ionisation inner-shell lines (e.g. o vi). modellingthe data with xstar requires four distinct ionisation zones for the gas, alloutflowing with velocities &lt; 1000 km/s. a selection of the strongestemission/absorption lines appear to be resolved with fwhm of ~600 km/s. we alsopresent the results from a quasi-simultaneous 350 ks suzaku observation of ngc4051 where the xis spectrum reveals strong evidence for blueshifted absorptionlines at ~6.8 and ~7.1 kev, consistent with previous findings. modelling withxstar suggests that this is the signature of a highly ionised, high velocityoutflow (log \xi ~ 4.1; v ~ -0.02c) which potentially may have a significanteffect on the host galaxy environment via feedback. finally, we alsosimultaneously model the broad-band 2008 xis+hxd suzaku data with archivalsuzaku data from 2005 when the source was observed to have entered an extendedperiod of low flux in an attempt to analyse the cause of the long-term spectralvariability. we find that we can account for this by allowing for largevariations in the normalisation of the intrinsic power-law component which maybe interpreted as being due to significant changes in the covering fraction ofa compton-thick partial-coverer obscuring the central continuum emission.

1102.5234	evidence for a circum-nuclear and ionised absorber in the x-ray obscured  broadline radio galaxy 3c 445	here we present the results of a suzaku observation of the broad line radiogalaxy 3c 445. we confirm the results obtained with the previous x-rayobservations which unveiled the presence of several soft x-ray emission linesand an overall x-ray emission which strongly resembles a typical seyfert 2despite of the optical classification as an unobscured agn. the broad bandspectrum allowed us to measure for the first time the amount of reflection(r~0.9) which together with the relatively strong neutral fe kalpha emissionline (ew ~ 100 ev) strongly supports a scenario where a compton-thick mirror ispresent. the primary x-ray continuum is strongly obscured by an absorber with acolumn density of nh =2-3 x10^{23} cm^{-2}. two possible scenarios are proposedfor the absorber: a neutral partial covering or a mildly ionised absorber withan ionisation parameter log\xi ~ 1.0 erg cm s^{-1}. a comparison with the pastand more recent x-ray observations of 3c 445 performed with xmm-newton andchandra is presented, which provided tentative evidence that the ionised andoutflowing absorber varied. we argue that the absorber is probably associatedwith an equatorial disk-wind located within the parsec scale molecular torus.

1103.0661	a broad-band x-ray view of the warm absorber in radio-quiet quasar  mr2251-178	we present the analysis of a new broad-band x-ray spectrum (0.6-180.0 kev) ofthe radio-quiet quasar mr 2251-178 which uses data obtained with both suzakuand the swift/bat. in accordance with previous observations, we find that thegeneral continuum can be well described by a power-law with {\gamma}=1.6 and anapparent soft-excess below 1 kev. warm absorption is clearly present andabsorption lines due to the fe uta, fe l (fe xxiii-xxiv), s xv and s xvi aredetected below 3 kev. at higher energies, fe k absorption from fe xxv-xxvi isdetected and a relatively weak (ew=25[+12,-8] ev) narrow fe k{\alpha} emissionline is observed at e=6.44\pm0.04 kev. the fe k{\alpha} emission is wellmodelled by the presence of a mildly ionised ({\xi}\leq30) reflection componentwith a low reflection fraction (r&lt;0.2). at least 5 ionised absorptioncomponents with 10^{20} \leq n_h \leq 10^{23} cm^{-2} and 0 \leq log({\xi})/ergcm s^{-1} \leq 4 are required to achieve an adequate spectral fit.alternatively, we show that the continuum can also be fit if a {\gamma}~2.0power-law is absorbed by a column of n_h~10^{23} cm^{-2} which covers ~30% ofthe source flux. independent of which continuum model is adopted, the fe l andfe xxv he{\alpha} lines are described by a single absorber outflowing withv_out~0.14 c. such an outflow/disk wind is likely to be substantially clumped(b~10^{-3}) in order to not vastly exceed the likely accretion rate of thesource.

1104.1812	the suzaku view of 3c 382	we present a long suzaku observation of 3c 382. a swift bat spectrum from the58-month survey is also analyzed, together with an archival xmm-newton epicexposure. our main result is the finding with suzaku of a broad fek line with arelativistic profile consistent with emission from an accretion disk at tens ofgravitational radii from the central black hole. the xis data indicate emissionfrom highly ionized iron and allow us to set tight, albeit model-dependent,constraints on the inner and outer radii of the disk reflecting region,r_in~10r_g and r_out~20r_g, respectively, and on the disk inclination, i~30deg.two ionized reflection components are possibly observed, with similarcontributions of ~10% to the total continuum. a highly ionized one, withlog_xi~3, which successfully models the relativistic line and a mildly ionizedone, with log_xi~1.5, which models the narrow fe k line and high energy hump.when both these components are included, there is no further requirement for anadditional black body soft excess below 2kev. the suzaku data confirm thepresence of a warm absorber previously known from grating studies. afteraccounting for all the spectral features, the intrinsic photon index of thex-ray continuum is ~1.8 with a cutoff energy at ~200kev, consistent withcomptonization models and excluding jet-related emission up to these energies.comparison of the x-ray properties of 3c 382 and other blrgs to seyfertsconfirms the idea that the distinction between radio-loud and radio-quiet agnat x-rays is blurred.

1106.2135	assessing black hole spin in deep suzaku observations of seyfert 1 agn	we present a broad-band analysis of deep suzaku observations of nearbyseyfert 1 agn: fairall 9, mcg--6-30-15, ngc 3516, ngc 3783 and ngc 4051. theuse of deep observations (exposures &gt;200 ks) with high s/n allows the complexspectra of these objects to be examined in full, taking into account featuressuch as the soft excess, reflection continuum and complex absorptioncomponents. after a self-consistent modelling of the broad-band data (0.6-100.0kev, also making use of bat data from swift), the subtle curvature which may beintroduced as a consequence of warm absorbers has a measured affect upon thespectrum at energies &gt;3 kev and the fe k region. forming a model (includingabsorption) of these agn allows the true extent to which broadened disklineemission is present to be examined and as a result the measurement of accretiondisc and black hole parameters which are consistent over the full 0.6-100.0 kevenergy range.  fitting relativistic line emission models appear to rule out the presence ofmaximally spinning black holes in all objects at the 90% confidence level, inparticular mcg--6-30-15 at &gt;99.5% confidence. relativistic fe k line emissionis only marginally required in ngc 3516 and not required in ngc 4051, over thefull energy bandpass. nonetheless, statistically significant broadened 6.4 kevfe k alpha emission is detected in fairall 9, mcg--6-30-15 and ngc 3783yielding black hole spin estimates of a=0.67(+0.10,-0.11), a=0.4(+0.20,-0.12)and a&lt;-0.04 respectively, when fitted with disc emission models.

0710.0382	the suzaku observation of ngc 3516: complex absorption and the broad and  narrow fe k lines	we present results from a 150 ksec suzaku observation of the seyfert 1.5 ngc3516 in october 2005. the source was in a relatively highly absorbed state. ourbest-fit model is consistent with the presence of a low-ionization absorberwhich has a column density near 5 * 10^{22} cm^{-2} and covers most of thex-ray continuum source (covering fraction 96-100%). a high-ionization absorbingcomponent, which yields a narrow absorption feature consistent with fe k xxvi,is confirmed. a relativistically broadened fe k alpha line is required in allfits, even after the complex absorption is taken into account; an additionalpartial-covering component is an inadequate substitute for the continuumcurvature associated with the broad fe line. a narrow fe k alpha emission linehas a velocity width consistent with the broad line region. the low-ionizationabsorber may be responsible for producing the narrow fe k alpha line, though acontribution from additional material out of the line of sight is possible. weinclude in our model soft band emission lines from he- and h-like ions of n, o,ne and mg, consistent with photo-ionization, though a small contribution fromcollisionally-ionized emission is possible.

1108.2609	the high energy view of the broad line radio galaxy 3c 111	we present the analysis of suzaku and xmm-newton observations of thebroad-line radio galaxy (blrg) 3c 111. its high energy emission showsvariability, a harder continuum with respect to the radio quiet agn population,and weak reflection features. suzaku found the source in a minimum flux level;a comparison with the xmm-newton data implies an increase of a factor of 2.5 inthe 0.5-10 kev flux, in the 6 months separating the two observations. the ironk complex is detected in both datasets, with rather low equivalent width(s).the intensity of the iron k complex does not respond to the change in continuumflux. an ultra-fast, high-ionization outflowing gas is clearly detected in thexis data; the absorber is most likely unstable. indeed, during the xmm-newtonobservation, which was 6 months after, the absorber was not detected. no clearroll-over in the hard x-ray emission is detected, probably due to the emergenceof the jet as a dominant component in the hard x-ray band, as suggested by thedetection above ~ 100 kev with the gso on-board suzaku, although the presentdata do not allow us to firmly constrain the relative contribution of thedifferent components. the fluxes observed by the gamma-ray satellites cgro andfermi would be compatible with the putative jet component if peaking atenergies e ~ 100 mev. in the x-ray band, the jet contribution to the continuumstarts to be significant only above 10 kev. if the detection of the jetcomponent in 3c 111 is confirmed, then its relative importance in the x-rayenergy band could explain the different observed properties in the high-energyemission of blrgs, which are otherwise similar in their other multiwavelengthproperties. comparison between x-ray and gamma-ray data taken at differentepochs suggests that the strong variability observed for 3c 111 is probablydriven by a change in the primary continuum.

1109.2882	evidence for ultra-fast outflows in radio-quiet agns: ii - detailed  photo-ionization modeling of fe k-shell absorption lines	x-ray absorption line spectroscopy has recently shown evidence for previouslyunknown ultra-fast outflows (ufos) in radio-quiet agns. in the previous paperof this series we defined ufos as those absorbers with an outflow velocityhigher than 10,000km/s and assessed the statistical significance of theassociated blueshifted fek absorption lines in a large sample of 42 localradio-quiet agns observed with xmm-newton. in the present paper we report adetailed curve of growth analysis and directly model the fek absorbers with thexstar photo-ionization code. we confirm that the frequency of sources in theradio-quiet sample showing ufos is &gt;35%. the outflow velocity distributionspans from \sim10,000km/s (\sim0.03c) up to \sim100,000km/s (\sim0.3c), with apeak and mean value of \sim42,000km/s (\sim0.14c). the ionization parameter isvery high and in the range log\xi 3-6erg s^{-1} cm, with a mean value of log\xi4.2 erg s^{-1} cm. the associated column densities are also large, in the rangen_h\sim10^{22}-10^{24} cm^{-2}, with a mean value of n_h\sim10^{23} cm^{-2}. wediscuss and estimate how selection effects, such as those related to thelimited instrumental sensitivity at energies above 7kev, may hamper thedetection of even higher velocities and higher ionization absorbers. we arguethat, overall, these results point to the presence of extremely ionized andpossibly almost compton thick outflowing material in the innermost regions ofagns. this also suggests that ufos may potentially play a significant role inthe expected cosmological feedback from agns and their study can provideimportant clues on the connection between accretion disks, winds and jets.

1111.0908	new insights on the accretion disk-winds connection in radio-loud agns  from suzaku	from the spectral analysis of long suzaku observations of five radio-loudagns we have been able to discover the presence of ultra-fast outflows withvelocities ~0.1c in three of them, namely 3c 111, 3c 120 and 3c 390.3. they areconsistent with being accretion disk winds/outflows. we also performed afollow-up on 3c 111 to monitor its outflow on ~7days time-scales and detectedan anti-correlated variability of a possible relativistic emission line withrespect to blue-shifted fe k features, following a flux increase. this providesthe first direct evidence for an accretion disk-wind connection in an agn. themass outflow rate of these outflows can be comparable to the accretion rate andtheir mechanical power can correspond to a significant fraction of thebolometric luminosity and is comparable to their typical jet power. therefore,they can possibly play a significant role in the expected feedback from agnsand can give us further clues on the relation between the accretion disk andthe formation of winds/jets.

0704.3053	the remarkable x-ray spectrum of the broad-line radio galaxy 3c 445	we present the results of the analysis of an archival 15 ks xmm-newtonobservation of the nearby (z=0.057) radio-loud source 3c445, opticallyclassified as a broad-line radio galaxy. while the rgs data are of insufficientquality to allow a meaningful analysis, the epic data show a remarkable x-rayspectrum. the 2-10 kev continuum is described by a heavily absorbed (nh~ 1e22 -1e23 cm-2) power law with photon index gamma ~1.4, and strong (r~2) coldreflection. a narrow, unresolved fe kalpha emission line is detected,confirming previous findings, with ew 120ev. a soft excess is present below 2kev over the extrapolation of the hard x-ray power law, which we model with apower law with the same photon index as the hard power law, absorbed by acolumn density nh=6e20 cm-2 in excess to galactic. a host of emission lines arepresent below 2 kev, confirming previous indications from asca, due to h- andhe-like o, mg, and si. we attribute the origin of the lines to a photoionizedgas, with properties very similar to radio-quiet obscured agn. two differentionized media, or a single stratified medium, are required to fit the softx-ray data satisfactorily. the similarity of the x-ray spectrum of 3c445 toseyferts underscores that the central engines of radio-loud and radio-quiet agnsimilarly host both cold and warm gas.

1201.1897	evidence for ultra-fast outflows in radio-quiet agns: iii - location and  energetics	using the results of a previous x-ray photo-ionization modelling ofblue-shifted fe k absorption lines on a sample of 42 local radio-quiet agnsobserved with xmm-newton, in this letter we estimate the location andenergetics of the associated ultra-fast outflows (ufos). due to significantuncertainties, we are essentially able to place only lower/upper limits. onaverage, their location is in the interval ~0.0003-0.03pc (~10^2-10^4 r_s) fromthe central black hole, consistent with what is expected for accretion diskwinds/outflows. the mass outflow rates are constrained between ~0.01-1m_{\odot} yr^{-1}, corresponding to &gt;5-10% of the accretion rates. the averagelower-upper limits on the mechanical power are log\dot{e}_k~42.6-44.6 ergs^{-1}. however, the minimum possible value of the ratio between the mechanicalpower and bolometric luminosity is constrained to be comparable or higher thanthe minimum required by simulations of feedback induced by winds/outflows.therefore, this work demonstrates that ufos are indeed capable to provide asignificant contribution to the agn cosmological feedback, in agreement withtheoretical expectations and the recent observation of interactions between agnoutflows and the interstellar medium in several seyferts galaxies.

1204.2535	modeling the fe k line profiles in type i agn with a compton-thick disk  wind	we have modeled a small sample of seyfert galaxies that were previouslyidentified as having simple x-ray spectra with little intrinsic absorption. thesources in this sample all contain moderately broad components of fe k-shellemission and are ideal candidates for testing the applicability of acompton-thick accretion-disk wind model to agn emission components. viewingangles through the wind allow the observer to see the absorption signature ofthe gas, whereas face-on viewing angles allow the observer to see the scatteredlight from the wind. we find that the fe k emission line profiles are welldescribed with a model of a compton-thick accretion-disk wind of solarabundances, arising tens to hundred of gravitational radii from the centralblack hole. further, the fits require a neutral component of fe k alphaemission that is too narrow to arise from the inner part of the wind, andlikely comes from a more distant reprocessing region. our study demonstratesthat a compton-thick wind can have a profound effect on the observed x-rayspectrum of an agn, even when the system is not viewed through the flow.

0704.3743	the suzaku observation of the nucleus of the radio-loud active galaxy  centaurus a: constraints on abundances of the accreting material	a suzaku observation of the nucleus of the radio-loud agn centaurus a in 2005has yielded a broadband spectrum spanning 0.3 to 250 kev. the net exposuretimes after screening were: 70 ks per x-ray imaging spectrometer (xis) camera,60.8 ks for the hard x-ray detector (hxd) pin, and 17.1 ks for the hxd-gso. thehard x-rays are fit by two power-laws of the same slope, absorbed by columns of1.5 and 7 * 10^{23} cm^{-2} respectively. the spectrum is consistent withprevious suggestions that the power-law components are x-ray emission from thesub-pc vlbi jet and from bondi accretion at the core, but it is also consistentwith a partial covering interpretation. the soft band is dominated by thermalemission from the diffuse plasma and is fit well by a two-temperature vapecmodel, plus a third power-law component to account for scattered nuclearemission, jet emission, and emission from x-ray binaries and other pointsources. narrow fluorescent emission lines from fe, si, s, ar, ca and ni aredetected. the fe k alpha line width yields a 200 light-day lower limit on thedistance from the black hole to the line-emitting gas. fe, ca, and s k-shellabsorption edges are detected. elemental abundances are constrained viaabsorption edge depths and strengths of the fluorescent and diffuse plasmaemission lines. the high metallicity ([fe/h]=+0.1) of the circumnuclearmaterial suggests that it could not have originated in the relativelymetal-poor outer halo unless enrichment by local star formation has occurred.relative abundances are consistent with enrichment from type ii and iasupernovae.

1210.0469	direct measurement of the x-ray time-delay transfer function in active  galactic nuclei	the origin of the observed time lags, in nearby active galactic nuclei (agn),between hard and soft x-ray photons is investigated using new xmm-newton datafor the narrow-line seyfert i galaxy ark 564 and existing data for 1h0707-495and ngc 4051. these agn have highly variable x-ray light curves that containfrequent, high peaks of emission. the averaged light curve of the peaks isdirectly measured from the time series, and it is shown that (i) peaks occur atthe same time, within the measurement uncertainties, at all x-ray energies, and(ii) there exists a substantial tail of excess emission at hard x-ray energies,which is delayed with respect to the time of the main peak, and is particularlyprominent in ark 564. observation (i) rules out that the observed lags arecaused by comptonization time delays and disfavors a simple model ofpropagating fluctuations on the accretion disk. observation (ii) is consistentwith time lags caused by compton-scattering reverberation from material a fewthousand light-seconds from the primary x-ray source. the power spectraldensity and the frequency-dependent phase lags of the peak light curves areconsistent with those of the full time series. there is evidence fornon-stationarity in the ark 564 time series in both the fourier and peaksanalyses. a sharp `negative' lag (variations at hard photon energies lead softphoton energies) observed in ark 564 appears to be generated by the shape ofthe hard-band transfer function and does not arise from soft-band reflection ofx-rays. these results reinforce the evidence for the existence of x-rayreverberation in type i agn, which requires that these agn are significantlyaffected by scattering from circumnuclear material a few tens or hundreds ofgravitational radii in extent.

1210.5949	decoupling absorption and continuum variability in the seyfert 2 ngc  4507	we present the results of the suzaku observation of the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc4507. this source is one of the x-ray brightest compton-thin seyfert 2s and acandidate for a variable absorber. suzaku caught ngc 4507 in a highly absorbedstate characterised by a high column density (nh \sim8 x10^23 cm^-2), a strongreflected component (r\sim 1.9) and a high equivalent width fe k alpha emissionline (ew\sim 500 ev). the fe k alpha emission line is unresolved at theresolution of the suzaku ccds (sigma &lt; 30 ev or fwhm &lt; 3000 km s^-1) and mostlikely originates in a distant absorber. the fe k beta emission line is alsoclearly detected and its intensity is marginally higher than the theoreticalvalue for low ionisation fe. a comparison with previous observations performedwith xmm-newton and bepposax reveals that the x-ray spectral curvature changeson a timescale of a few months. we analysed all these historical observations,with standard models as well as with a most recent model for a toroidalreprocessor and found that the main driver of the observed 2-10 kev spectralvariability is a change of the line-of-sight obscuration, varying from\sim4x10^23 cm^-2 to \sim9 x 10^23 cm^-2. the primary continuum is alsovariable, although its photon index does not appear to vary, while the fe kalpha line and reflection component are consistent with being constant acrossthe observations. this suggests the presence of a rather constant reprocessorand that the observed line of sight nh variability is either due to a certaindegree of clumpiness of the putative torus or due to the presence of a secondclumpy absorber.

1212.4851	unification of x-ray winds in seyfert galaxies: from ultra-fast outflows  to warm absorbers	the existence of ionized x-ray absorbing layers of gas along the line ofsight to the nuclei of seyfert galaxies is a well established observationalfact. this material is systematically outflowing and shows a large range inparameters. however, its actual nature and dynamics are still not clear. inorder to gain insights into these important issues we performed a literaturesearch for papers reporting the parameters of the soft x-ray warm absorbers(was) in 35 type 1 seyferts and compared their properties to those of theultra-fast outflows (ufos) detected in the same sample. the fraction of sourceswith was is &gt;60%, consistent with previous studies. the fraction of sourceswith ufos is &gt;34%, &gt;67% of which also show was. the large dynamic rangeobtained when considering all the absorbers together allows us, for the firsttime, to investigate general relations among them. in particular, we findsignificant correlations indicating that the closer the absorber is to thecentral black hole, the higher the ionization, column, outflow velocity andconsequently the mechanical power. the absorbers continuously populate thewhole parameter space, with the was and the ufos lying always at the two endsof the distribution. this strongly suggest that these absorbers, oftenconsidered of different types, could actually represent parts of a singlelarge-scale stratified outflow observed at different locations from the blackhole. the observed parameters and correlations are consistent with bothradiation pressure through compton scattering and mhd processes contributing tothe outflow acceleration, the latter playing a major role. most of theabsorbers, especially the ufos, have a sufficiently high mechanical power tosignificantly contribute to agn feedback.

1307.0403	an outburst scenario for the x-ray spectral variability in 3c 111	we present a combined suzaku and swift bat broad-band e=0.6-200kev spectralanalysis of three 3c 111 observations obtained in 2010. the data are welldescribed with an absorbed power-law continuum and a weak (r~0.2) coldreflection component from distant material. we constrain the continuum cutoffat e_c~150-200kev, which is in accordance with x-ray comptonization coronamodels and supports claims that the jet emission is only dominant at muchhigher energies. fe xxvi ly\alpha emission and absorption lines are alsopresent in the first and second observations, respectively. the modelling andinterpretation of the emission line is complex and we explore threepossibilities. if originating from ionized disc reflection, this should beemitted at r_in&gt; 50r_g or, in the lamp-post configuration, the illuminatingsource should be at a height of h&gt; 30r_g over the black hole. alternatively,the line could be modeled with a hot collisionally ionized plasma withtemperature kt = 22.0^{+6.1}_{-3.2} kev or a photo-ionized plasma withlog\xi=4.52^{+0.10}_{-0.16} erg s^{-1} cm and column density n_h &gt; 3x10^23cm^{-2}. however, the first and second scenarios are less favored onstatistical and physical grounds, respectively. the blue-shifted absorptionline in the second observation can be modelled as an ultra-fast outflow (ufo)with ionization parameter log\xi=4.47^{+0.76}_{-0.04} erg s^{-1} cm, columndensity n_h=(5.3^{+1.8}_{-1.3})x 10^{22} cm^{-2} and outflow velocity v_out =0.104+/-0.006 c. interestingly, the parameters of the photo-ionized emissionmodel remarkably match those of the absorbing ufo. we suggest an outburstscenario in which an accretion disc wind, initially lying out of the line ofsight and observed in emission, then crosses our view to the source and it isobserved in absorption as a mildly-relativistic ufo.

1308.4550	a high resolution view of the warm absorber in the quasar mr2251-178	high resolution x-ray spectroscopy of the warm absorber in the nearby quasar,mr2251-178 (z = 0.06398) is presented. the observations were carried out in2011 using the chandra high energy transmission grating and the xmm-newtonreflection grating spectrometer, with net exposure times of approximately 400ks each. a multitude of absorption lines from c to fe are detected, revealingat least 3 warm absorbing components ranging in ionization parameter fromlog(\xi/erg cm s^-1) = 1-3 and with outflow velocities &lt; 500 km/s. the lowestionization absorber appears to vary between the chandra and xmm-newtonobservations, which implies a radial distance of between 9-17 pc from the blackhole. several broad soft x-ray emission lines are strongly detected, mostnotably from he-like oxygen, with fwhm velocity widths of up to 10000 km/s,consistent with an origin from broad line region (blr) clouds. in addition tothe warm absorber, gas partially covering the line of sight to the quasarappears to be present, of typical column density n_h = 10^23 cm^-2. we suggestthat the partial covering absorber may arise from the same blr cloudsresponsible for the broad soft x-ray emission lines. finally the presence of ahighly ionised outflow in the iron k band from both 2002 and 2011 chandra hetgobservations appears to be confirmed, which has an outflow velocity of -15600\pm 2400 km/s. however a partial covering origin for the iron k absorptioncannot be excluded, resulting from low ionization material with little or nooutflow velocity.

1311.0734	variability of the high velocity outflow in the quasar pds 456	we present a comparison of two suzaku x-ray observations of the nearby(z=0.184), luminous ($l_{bol} \sim 10^{47}$ erg s$^{-1}$) type i quasar,pds456. a new 125ks suzaku observation in 2011 caught the quasar during aperiod of low x-ray flux and with a hard x-ray spectrum, in contrast to aprevious 190ks suzaku observation in 2007 when the quasar appeared brighter andhad a steep ($\gamma&gt;2$) x-ray spectrum. the 2011 x-ray spectrum contains apronounced trough near 9\,kev in the quasar rest frame, which can be modeledwith blue-shifted iron k-shell absorption, most likely from the he and h-liketransitions of iron. the absorption trough is observed at a similar rest-frameenergy as in the earlier 2007 observation, which appears to confirm theexistence of a persistent high velocity wind in pds 456, at an outflow velocityof $0.25-0.30$c. the spectral variability between 2007 and 2011 can beaccounted for by variations in a partial covering absorber, increasing incovering fraction from the brighter 2007 observation to the hard and faint 2011observation. overall the low flux 2011 observation can be explained if pds 456is observed at relatively low inclination angles through a compton thick wind,originating from the accretion disk, which significantly attenuates the x-rayflux from the quasar.

1402.3700	revealing the location and structure of the accretion disk-wind in  pds456	we present evidence for the rapid variability of the high velocity ironk-shell absorption in the nearby ($z=0.184$) quasar pds456. from a recent longsuzaku observation in 2013 ($\sim1$ms effective duration) we find that the theequivalent width of iron k absorption increases by a factor of $\sim5$ duringthe observation, increasing from $&lt;105$ev within the first 100ks of theobservation, towards a maximum depth of $\sim500$ev near the end. the impliedoutflow velocity of $\sim0.25$c is consistent with that claimed from earlier(2007, 2011) suzaku observations. the absorption varies on time-scales as shortas $\sim1$ week. we show that this variability can be equally well attributedto either (i) an increase in column density, plausibly associated with a clumpytime-variable outflow, or (ii) the decreasing ionization of a smoothhomogeneous outflow which is in photo-ionization equilibrium with the localphoton field. the variability allows a direct measure of absorber location,which is constrained to within $r=200-3500$$\rm{r_{g}}$ of the black hole. evenin the most conservative case the kinetic power of the outflow is $\gtrsim6\%$of the eddington luminosity, with a mass outflow rate in excess of $\sim40\%$of the eddington accretion rate. the wind momentum rate is directly equivalentto the eddington momentum rate which suggests that the flow may have beenaccelerated by continuum-scattering during an episode of eddington-limitedaccretion.

1402.4483	the puzzling x-ray continuum of the quasar mr 2251-178	we report on a comprehensive x-ray spectral analysis of the nearbyradio-quiet quasar mr 2251-178, based on the long-look (~ 400 ks) xmm-newtonobservation carried out in november 2011. as the properties of the multiphasewarm absorber (thoroughly discussed in a recent, complementary work) hint at asteep photoionizing continuum, here we investigate into the nature of theintrinsic x-ray emission of mr 2251-178 by testing several physical models. theapparent 2-10 kev flatness as well as the subtle broadband curvature can beascribed to partial covering of the x-ray source by a cold, clumpy absorptionsystem with column densities ranging from a fraction to several x10^23 cm^-2.as opposed to more complex configurations, only one cloud is required along theline of sight in the presence of a soft x-ray excess, possibly arising ascomptonized disc emission in the accretion disc atmosphere. on statisticalgrounds, even reflection with standard efficiency off the surface of the innerdisc cannot be ruled out, although this tentatively overpredicts the observed ~14-150 kev emission. it is thus possible that each of the examined physicalprocesses is relevant to a certain degree, and hence only a combination ofhigh-quality, simultaneous broadband spectral coverage and multi-epochmonitoring of x-ray spectral variability could help disentangling the differentcontributions. yet, regardless of the model adopted, we infer for mr 2251-178 abolometric luminosity of ~ 5-7 x 10^45 erg/s, implying that the central blackhole is accreting at ~ 15-25 per cent of the eddington limit.

0803.0080	tracing a disk wind in ngc 3516	x-ray spectra of agn often contain signatures indicative of absorption inmultiple layers of gas whose ionization-state and covering fraction may varywith time. it has been unclear to date how much of the observed x-ray spectraland timing behavior in agn can be attributed to variations in absorption,versus variations in the strengths of emission or reflection components.diagnostics of the inner regions of agn cannot be reliably performed until theorigin of observed effects is understood. we investigate the role of the x-rayabsorbers in the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 3516. time-averaged and flux-selectedspectroscopy is used to examine the behavior of ngc 3516 observed in chandrahetg and xmm data from oct 2006. new h-like and he-like emission and absorptionfeatures discovered in the fe k regime reveal a previously unknown zone ofcircumnuclear gas in ngc 3516 with log xi ~ 4.3 and column density 1e23 cm^-2.a lower-ionization layer with log xi ~2 and of similar column density isconfirmed from previous observations, this layer has a covering fraction around50%, and changes in covering provide a simple explanation of a deep dip in thelight curve that we interpret as an eclipse of the continuum due to passage ofa cloud across the sight line within half a day. these inner zones of absorbinggas are detected to have outflow velocities in the range 1000-2000 km/s, this,and constraints on radial location are consistent with an origin as part of adisk wind in ngc 3516.

1406.7252	ultra-fast outflows in radio-loud active galactic nuclei	recent x-ray observations show absorbing winds with velocities up tomildly-relativistic values of the order of ~0.1c in a limited sample of 6broad-line radio galaxies. they are observed as blue-shifted fe xxv-xxvik-shell absorption lines, similarly to the ultra-fast outflows (ufos) reportedin seyferts and quasars. in this work we extend the search for such fe kabsorption lines to a larger sample of 26 radio-loud agns observed withxmm-newton and suzaku. the sample is drawn from the swift bat 58-month catalogand blazars are excluded. x-ray bright fr ii radio galaxies constitute themajority of the sources. combining the results of this analysis with those inthe literature we find that ufos are detected in &gt;27% of the sources. however,correcting for the number of spectra with insufficient signal-to-noise, we canestimate that the incidence of ufos is this sample of radio-loud agns is likelyin the range f=(50+/-20)%. a photo-ionization modeling of the absorption lineswith xstar allows to estimate the distribution of their main parameters. theobserved outflow velocities are broadly distributed between v_out&lt;1,000 km s^-1and v_out~0.4c, with mean and median values of v_out~0.133c and v_out~0.117c,respectively. the material is highly ionized, with an average ionizationparameter of log\xi~4.5 erg s^-1 cm, and the column densities are larger thann_h &gt; 10^22 cm^-2. overall, these characteristics are consistent with thepresence of complex accretion disk winds in a significant fraction ofradio-loud agns and demonstrate that the presence of relativistic jets does notpreclude the existence of winds, in accordance with several theoretical models.

0803.2680	an absorption origin for the x-ray spectral variability of mcg-6-30-15	the seyfert i galaxy mcg-6-30-15 shows one of the best examples of a broad"red wing" of emission in its x-ray spectrum at energies 2 &lt; e &lt; 6.4 kev,commonly interpreted as being caused by relativistically-blurred reflectionclose to the event horizon of the black hole. we aim to test an alternativemodel in which absorption creates the observed spectral shape, explains thepuzzling lack of variability of the red wing and reduces the high reflectionalbedo, substantially greater than unity, that is otherwise inferred atenergies e &gt; 20 kev. we compiled all the available long-exposure, high-qualitydata for mcg-6-30-15: 522 ks of chandra hetgs, 282 ks of xmm-newton pn/rgs and253 ks of suzaku xis/pin data. this is the first analysis of this full dataset.we investigated the spectral variability on timescales &gt;20 ks using principalcomponents analysis and fitted spectral models to "flux state" and mean spectraover the energy range 0.5-45 kev (depending on detector). the absorber modelwas based on the zones previously identified in the high-resolution gratingdata. joint fits were carried out to any data that were simultaneous. multipleabsorbing zones covering a wide range of ionisation are required by the gratingdata, including a highly ionised outflowing zone. a variable partial-coveringzone plus absorbed low-ionisation reflection, distant from the source, providesa complete description of the variable x-ray spectrum. a single model fits allthe data. we conclude that these zones are responsible for the red wing, itsapparent lack of variability, the absorption structure around the fe k-alphaline, the soft-band "excess" and the high flux seen in the hard x-ray band. arelativistically-blurred fe line is not required in this model. we suggest thepartial covering zone is a clumpy wind from the accretion disk.

1501.07664	wind from the black-hole accretion disk driving a molecular outflow in  an active galaxy	powerful winds driven by active galactic nuclei (agn) are often invoked toplay a fundamental role in the evolution of both supermassive black holes(smbhs) and their host galaxies, quenching star formation and explaining thetight smbh-galaxy relations. recent observations of large-scale molecularoutflows in ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) have provided theevidence to support these studies, as they directly trace the gas out of whichstars form. theoretical models suggest an origin of these outflows asenergy-conserving flows driven by fast agn accretion disk winds. previousclaims of a connection between large-scale molecular outflows and agn activityin ulirgs were incomplete because they were lacking the detection of theputative inner wind. conversely, studies of powerful agn accretion disk windsto date have focused only on x-ray observations of local seyferts and a fewhigher redshift quasars. here we show the clear detection of a powerful agnaccretion disk wind with a mildly relativistic velocity of 0.25c in the x-rayspectrum of iras f11119+3257, a nearby (z = 0.189) optically classified type 1ulirg hosting a powerful molecular outflow. the agn is responsible for ~80% ofthe emission, with a quasar-like luminosity of l_agn = 1.5x10^46 erg/s. theenergetics of these winds are consistent with the energy-conserving mechanism,which is the basis of the quasar mode feedback in agn lacking powerful radiojets.

1506.00614	the suzaku view of highly-ionised outflows in agn: ii -- location,  energetics and scalings with bolometric luminosity	ongoing studies with xmm-newton have shown that powerful accretion discwinds, as revealed through highly-ionised fe\,k-shell absorption at e&gt;=6.7 kev,are present in a significant fraction of active galactic nuclei (agn) in thelocal universe (tombesi et al. 2010). in gofford et al. (2013) we analysed asample of 51 suzaku-observed agn and independently detected fe k absorption in~40% of the sample, and we measured the properties of the absorbing gas. inthis work we build upon these results to consider the properties of theassociated wind. on average, the fast winds (v_out&gt;0.01c) are located&lt;r&gt;~10^{15-18} cm (typically ~10^{2-4} r_s) from their black hole, their massoutflow rates are of the order &lt;m_out&gt;~0.01-1 msun/yr or ~(0.01-1) m_edd andkinetic power is constrained to &lt;l_k&gt; ~10^{43-45} erg/s, equivalent to~(0.1-10%) l_edd. we find a fundamental correlation between the sourcebolometric luminosity and the wind velocity, with v_out \propto l_bol^{\alpha}and \alpha=0.4^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ (90% confidence), which indicates that moreluminous agn tend to harbour faster fe k winds. the mass outflow rate m_out,kinetic power l_k and momentum flux p_out of the winds are also consequentlycorrelated with l_bol, such that more massive and more energetic winds arepresent in more luminous agn. we investigate these properties in the frameworkof a continuum-driven wind, showing that the observed relationships are broadlyconsistent with a wind being accelerated by continuum-scattering. we find that,globally, a significant fraction (~85%) of the sample can plausibly exceed thel_k/l_bol~0.5% threshold thought necessary for feedback, while 45% may alsoexceed the less conservative ~5% of l_bol threshold as well. this suggests thatthe winds may be energetically significant for agn--host-galaxy feedbackprocesses.

1508.01198	the chandra/hetg view of ngc 1365 in a compton-thick state	we present the analysis of a chandra high-energy transmission grating (hetg)observation of the local seyfert galaxy ngc 1365. the source, well known forits dramatic x-ray spectral variability, was caught in a reflection-dominated,compton-thick state. the high spatial resolution afforded by chandra allowed usto isolate the soft x-ray emission from the active nucleus, neglecting most ofthe contribution from the kpc-scale starburst ring. the hetg spectra thusrevealed a wealth of he- and h-like lines from photoionized gas, whereas inlarger aperture observations these are almost exclusively produced throughcollisional ionization in the circumnuclear environment. once the residualthermal component is accounted for, the emission-line properties of thephotoionized region close to the hard x-ray continuum source indicate that ngc1365 has some similarities to the local population of obscured active galaxies.in spite of the limited overall data quality, several soft x-ray lines seem tohave fairly broad profiles (~800-1300 km/s full-width at half maximum), and arange of outflow velocities (up to ~1600 km/s, but possibly reaching a fewthousands km/s) appears to be involved. at higher energies, the k$\alpha$fluorescence line from neutral iron is resolved with &gt; 99 per cent confidence,and its width of ~3000 km/s points to an origin from the same broad-line regionclouds responsible for eclipsing the x-ray source and likely shielding thenarrow-line region.

1511.07107	the global implications of the hard excess ii: analysis of the local  population of radio quiet agn	active galactic nuclei (agn) show evidence for reprocessing gas, outflowingfrom the accreting black hole. the combined effects of absorption andscattering from the circumnuclear material likely explains the `hard excess' ofx-ray emission above 20 kev, compared with extrapolation of spectra from lowerx-ray energies. in a recent {\it suzaku} study, we established the ubiquitoushard excess in hard x-ray-selected, radio-quiet type\,1 agns to be consistentwith reprocessing of the x-ray continuum an ensemble of clouds, located tens tohundreds of gravitational radii from the nuclear black hole. here we add hardx-ray-selected, type\,2 agn to extend our original study and show that thegross x-ray spectral properties of the entire local population of radio quietagn may be described by a simple unified scheme. we find a broad, continuousdistribution of spectral hardness ratio and fe\,k$\alpha$ equivalent widthacross all agn types, which can be reproduced by varying the observer'ssightline through a single, simple model cloud ensemble, provided the radiativetransfer through the model cloud distribution includes not only photoelectricabsorption but also 3d compton scattering. variation in other parameters of thecloud distribution, such as column density or ionisation, should be expectedbetween agn, but such variation is not required to explain the gross x-rayspectral properties.

astro-ph;0010490	xmm-newton observation of an unusual iron line in the quasar markarian  205	xmm-newton observations of the low luminosity, radio-quiet quasar markarian205 have revealed a unique iron k emission line profile. in marked contrast tothe broad and redshifted iron k line commonly seen in asca observations ofseyfert 1 galaxies, we find that a substantial amount of the line flux in mrk205 occurs above the neutral line energy of 6.4 kev. furthermore, we find thatthe iron line emission has two distinct components, a narrow, unresolvedneutral line at 6.4 kev and a broadened line centred at 6.7 kev. we suggestthat the most likely origin of the 6.7 kev line is from x-ray reflection offthe surface of a highly ionised accretion disk, whilst the 6.4 kev componentmay arise from neutral matter distant from the black hole, quite possibly inthe putative molecular torus. overall this observation underlines the potentialof xmm-newton for using the iron k line as a diagnostic of matter in theinnermost regions of agn.

astro-ph;0206480	soft x-ray emission lines in the afterglow spectrum of grb 011211:- a  detailed xmm-newton analysis	we report on an xmm-newton observation of the x-ray afterglow of the gammaray burst grb 011211, originally detected by beppo-sax on 11th december 2001.the early afterglow spectrum obtained by xmm-newton, observed 11 hours afterthe initial burst, appeared to reveal decaying h-like k emission lines of mg,si, s, ar and ca, arising in enriched material with an outflow velocity oforder 0.1c (reeves et al. 2002). this was attributed to matter ejected from amassive stellar progenitor occurring shortly before the burst itself. here, wepresent a detailed re-analysis of the xmm-newton epic observations of grb011211. in particular, we show that the detection of the soft x-ray lineemission appears robust, regardless of detector background, calibration,spectral binning, or the spectral model that is assumed. we demonstrate thatthermal emission, from an optically thin plasma, is the most plausible modelthat can account for the soft x-ray emission, which appears to be the case forat least two burst afterglow spectra observed by xmm-newton. the x-ray spectrumof grb 011211 evolves with time over the first 12 ksec of the xmm-newtonobservation, the observations suggest that thermal emission dominates the earlyafterglow spectrum, whilst a power-law component dominates the latter stages.finally we estimate the mass of the ejected material in grb 011211 to be of theorder 4-20 solar masses.

astro-ph;0210140	serendipitous agn in the xmm-newton fields of markarian 205 and qso  0130-403	the x-ray spectra of serendipitously observed agn in the xmm-newton fields ofmrk 205 and qso 0130-403 are analysed. the sample consists of 23 objects, noneof which is detected at radio frequencies, with a median x-ray luminosity of ~4 x 10^44 erg s^-1 and redshifts ranging from ~0.1 to just over 3. the meanphoton index was found to be 1.89 +/- 0.04. in contrast to past asca and rosatobservations of high-redshift radio-loud quasars, we find little evidence forexcess intrinsic absorption in these radio-quiet objects, with only threesources requiring a column density in excess of the galactic value. comparingthe measured spectral indices over the redshift range, we also find there is nox-ray spectral evolution of qsos with time, up to redshift 3. within the samplethere is no evidence for evolution of the optical to x-ray spectral index,alpha-ox, with redshift, the mean value being -1.66 +/- 0.04. however, uponcomparing the values from the bright quasar survey at low redshift (z &lt; 0.5)and high redshift qsos detected by chandra (z &gt; 4), a slight steepening ofalpha-ox is noted for the more distant objects. in most of the sources there isno significant requirement for a soft excess, although a weak thermal component(&lt; 10% of lx) cannot be excluded. there is an indication of spectral flattening(by delta gamma=0.2) at higher energies (&gt; 3 kev, qso rest frame) for thesample as a whole. this is consistent with the presence of a compton reflectioncomponent in these radio-quiet agn, with the scattering medium (such as anaccretion disc or molecular torus) occupying a solid angle of 2 pi steradiansto the x-ray source.

astro-ph;0210288	a simultaneous xmm-newton and bepposax observation of the archetypal  broad line seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 5548	we report the spectral analysis of a long xmm-newton observation of thewell-studied, moderate luminosity broad line seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 5548. thesource was at an historically average brightness and we find the hard (3-10kev) spectrum can be well fitted by a power law of photon index gamma ~ 1.75,together with reflection. the only feature in the hard x-ray spectrum is anarrow emission line near 6.4 kev, with an equivalent width of ~ 60 ev. theenergy and strength of this line is consistent with fluorescence from `neutral'iron distant from the central continuum source. we find no evidence for a broadfe k line, with an upper limit well below previous reports, suggesting theinner accretion disc is now absent or highly ionised. the addition ofsimultaneous bepposax data allows the analysis to be extended to 200 kev,yielding important constraints on the total reflection. extrapolation of thehard x-ray power law down to 0.3 kev shows a clear `soft excess' below ~ 0.7kev. after due allowance for the effects of a complex warm absorber, measuredwith the xmm-newton rgs, we find the soft excess is better described as asmooth upward curvature in the continuum flux below ~ 2 kev. the soft excesscan be modelled either by comptonised thermal emission or by enhancedreflection from the surface of a highly ionised disc.

astro-ph;0302151	fe k emission and absorption features in xmm-newton spectra of mkn 766 -  evidence for reprocessing in flare ejecta	we report on the analysis of a long xmm-newton epic observation in 2001 mayof the narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy mkn 766. the 3-11 kev spectrum exhibits amoderately steep power law continuum, with a broad emission line at ~6.7 kev,probably blended with a narrow line at ~6.4 kev, and a broad absorption troughabove ~8.7 kev. we identify both broad spectral features with reprocessing inhe-like fe. an earlier xmm-newton observation of mkn 766 in 2000 may, when thesource was a factor ~2 fainter, shows a similar broad emission line, but with aslightly flatter power law and absorption at a lower energy. in neitherobservation do we find a requirement for the previously reported broad 'redwing' to the line and hence of reflection from the innermost accretion disc.more detailed examination of the longer xmm-newton observation reveals evidencefor rapid spectral variability in the fe k band, apparently linked with theoccurrence of x-ray 'flares'. a reduction in the emission line strength andincreased high energy absorption during the x-ray flaring suggests that thesetransient effects are due to highly ionised ejecta associated with the flares.simple scaling from the flare avalanche model proposed for the luminous qso pds456 (reeves etal. 2002) confirms the feasibility of coherent flaring being thecause of the strong peaks seen in the x-ray light curve of \mkn.

astro-ph;0404385	xmm-newton epic observations of 21 low-redshift pg quasars	we present an x-ray spectral analysis of 21 low redshift quasars observedwith xmm-newton epic. all the sources are palomar green quasars with redshiftsbetween 0.05 and 0.4 and have low galactic absorption along the line-of-sight.a large majority of quasars in the sample (19/21) exhibit a significant softexcess below ~1-1.5kev, whilst two objects (pg1114+445 and izw1) show a deficitof soft x-ray flux due to the presence of a strong warm absorber. at least halfof the objects appear to harbor a warm absorber, as found previously in seyfert1 galaxies. we find significant detections of fekalpha emission lines in atleast twelve objects, whilst there is evidence for some broadening of the lineprofile, compared to the epic-pn resolution, in five of these quasars.  the determination of the nature of this broadening (e.g., keplerian motion, ablend of lines, relativistic effects) is not possible with the present data andrequires either higher s/n or higher resolution spectra. in seven objects theline is located between 6.7-7kev, corresponding to highly ionized iron, whereasin the other five objects the line energy is consistent with 6.4 kev, i.e.corresponding to near neutral iron. the ionized lines tend to be found in thequasars with the steepest x-ray spectra. we also find a correlation between thecontinuum power law index and the optical hbeta width, in both the soft andhard x-ray bands, whereby the steepest x-ray spectra are found in objects withnarrow hbeta widths, which confirms previous rosat and asca results. the softand hard band x-ray photon indices are also strongly correlated, i.e. thesteepest soft x-ray spectra correspond the steepest hard x-ray spectra.

astro-ph;0407472	xmm-newton observation of the seyfert 1.8 eso 113-g010: discovery of a  highly redshifted iron line at 5.4 kev	we present a spectral analysis of the seyfert 1.8 eso 113-g010 observed withxmm-newton for 4 ks. the spectrum shows a soft excess below 0.7 kev and moreinterestingly a narrow emission gaussian line at 5.4 kev (in its rest-frame),most probably originating from a redshifted iron kalpha line. no significantline at or above 6.4 kev is found contrary to other objects showing redshiftedlines, ruling out a strong blue-wing to the line profile. the line is detectedat 99% confidence, from performing monte carlo simulations which fully accountfor the range of energies where a narrow iron line is likely to occur. theenergy of the line could indicate emission from relativistic (0.17 - 0.23 c)ejected matter moving away from the observer, as proposed for mrk 766 by turneret al. (2004). alternatively, the emission from a narrow annulus at the surfaceof the accretion disk is unlikely due to the very small inclination angle (i.e.less than 10 deg) required to explain the narrow, redshifted line in thisintermediate seyfert galaxy. however emission from a small, localized hot-spoton the disk, occurring within a fraction of a complete disk orbit, could alsoexplain the redshifted line. this scenario would be directly testable in alonger observation, as one would see significant variations in the energy andintensity of the line within an orbital timescale.

(2002). we also find that excess fluxaround the base of the fe k line core can be modeled with either a comptonscattering ``shoulder'' or an emission line from a relativistic accretion disk,having an inclination angle of 11 degrees or less. this disk line model is asgood as a compton-shoulder model for the base of the fe k line core. in thelatter model, the column density is 7.5 [+2.7,-0.6] x 10^{23} cm^{-2}, whichcorresponds to a thomson optical depth of ~0.60. an intrinsic width of 1500[+460,-340] km/s fwhm is still required in this model. moreover, morecomplicated scenarios involving both a compton-shoulder and a disk line cannotbe ruled out. we confirm an absorption feature due to he-like fe (fwhm = 6405[+5020,-2670] km/s), found in previous studies.

astro-ph;0511077	new insights into ultraluminous x-ray sources from deep xmm-newton  observations	the controversy over whether ultraluminous x-ray sources (ulxs) contain a newintermediate-mass class of black holes (imbhs) remains unresolved. we presentnew analyses of the deepest xmm-newton observations of ulxs that address theirunderlying nature. we examine both empirical and physical modelling of thex-ray spectra of a sample of thirteen of the highest quality ulx datasets, andfind that there are anomalies in modelling ulxs as accreting imbhs withproperties simply scaled-up from galactic black holes. most notably, spectralcurvature above 2 kev in several sources implies the presence of anoptically-thick, cool corona. we also present a new analysis of a 100 ksobservation of holmberg ii x-1, in which a rigorous analysis of the temporaldata limits the mass of its black hole to no more than 100 solar masses. weargue that a combination of these results points towards many (though notnecessarily all) ulxs containing black holes that are at most a few 10s ofsolar mass in size.

astro-ph;0511576	discovery of an afterglow extension of the prompt phase of two gamma ray  bursts observed by swift	bat and xrt observations of two recent well-covered grbs observed by swift,grb 050315 and grb 050319, show clearly a prompt component joining the onset ofthe afterglow emission. by fitting a power law form to the gamma-ray spectrum,we extrapolate the time dependent fluxes measured by the bat, in the energyband 15-350 kev, into the spectral regime observed by the xrt 0.2-10 kev, andexamine the functional form of the rate of decay of the two light curves. wefind that the bat and xrt light curves merge to form a unified curve. there isa period of steep decay up to ~300 s, followed by a flatter decay. the durationof the steep decay, ~100 s in the source frame after correcting forcosmological time dilation, agrees roughly with a theoretical estimate for thedeceleration time of the relativistic ejecta as it interacts with circumstellarmaterial. for grb 050315, the steep decay can be characterized by anexponential form, where one e-folding decay time t_e(bat) ~ 24+/-2 s, andt_e(xrt) ~ 35+/-2 s. for grb 050319, a power law decay -(d ln f/d ln t) = n,where n is about 3, provides a reasonable fit. the early time x-ray fluxes areconsistent with representing the lower energy tail of the prompt emission, andprovide our first quantitative measure of the decay of the prompt gamma-rayemission over a large dynamic range in flux. the initial steep decay isexpected due to the delayed high latitude photons from a curved shell ofrelativistic plasma illuminated only for a short interval. the overallconclusion is that the prompt phase of grbs remains observable for hundreds ofseconds longer than previously thought.

astro-ph;0512392	swift and xmm observations of the dark grb 050326	we present swift and xmm observations of grb 050326, detected by swift-bat.the fluence was 7.7x10^-6 erg cm^-2 (20-150 kev), and its spectrum was hard,with a power law photon index 1.25. the afterglow light curve did not show anybreak nor flares between ~1 hr and ~6 d after the burst, and decayed with aslope 1.70. the afterglow spectrum is well fitted by a power-law model,suffering absorption both in the milky way and in the host galaxy. therest-frame hydrogen column density is significant, n_h_z &gt; 4x10^21 cm^-2, andthe redshift of the absorber is z &gt; 1.5. there was good agreement between theswift-xrt and xmm results. by comparing the prompt and afterglow fluxes, wefound that an early break occurred before the xrt observation. the propertiesof the grb 050326 afterglow are well described by a spherical fireballexpanding in a uniform external medium, so a further steepening is expected atlater times. the lack of such a break constrains the jet angle to be &gt;7 deg.using the redshift constraints provided by the x-ray analysis, we alsoestimated that the beaming-corrected gamma-ray energy was &gt;3x10^51 erg, at thehigh end of grb energies. despite the brightness in x rays, only deep limitscould be placed by swift-uvot at optical/uv wavelengths. thus, this grb was"truly dark", with the optical-to-x-ray spectrum violating the synchrotronlimit. the optical and x-ray observations are consistent either with anabsorbed event or with a high-redshift one. to obey the ghirlanda relation, amoderate/large redshift z&gt;4.5 is required.

astro-ph;0609437	swift and suzaku observations of the x-ray afterglow from the grb 060105	results are presented of early x-ray afterglow observations of grb 060105 byswift and suzaku. the bright, long gamma-ray burst grb 060105 triggered theswift burst alert telescope (bat) at 06:49:28 on 5 january 2006. the suzakuteam commenced a pre-planned target of opportunity observation at 19 ks (5.3hr) after the swift trigger. following the prompt emission and successive verysteep decay, a shallow decay was observed from t_0+187 s to t_0+1287 s. afteran observation gap during t_0 +(1.5-3) ks, an extremely early steep decay wasobserved in t_0+(4-30) ks. the lightcurve flattened again at t_0+30 ks, andanother steep decay followed from t_0+50 ks to the end of observations. bothsteep decays exhibited decay indices of 2.3 - 2.4. this very early break, if itis a jet break, is the earliest case among x-ray afterglow observations,suggesting a very narrow jet whose opening angle is well below 1 degree. theunique suzaku/xis data allow us to set very tight upper limits on line emissionor absorption in this grb. for the reported pseudo-redshift of z=4.0+/-1.3 theupper limit on the iron line equivalent width is 50 ev.

astro-ph;0610112	is the x-ray spectrum of the narrow emission line qso pg1211+143 defined  by its energetic outflow?	an xmm-newton observation of the bright qso pg1211+143 in 2001 revealed ablue-shifted absorption line spectrum indicative of a high velocity radialoutflow of highly ionised gas. unless highly collimated, the outflow mass ratewas shown to be comparable to the accretion rate, with mechanical energy asignificant fraction of the bolometric luminosity. analysis of the fullxmm-newton data set now allows the wider effects of that energetic outflow tobe explored. we find that absorption and re-emission of the primary continuumflux in the ionised outflow, together with a second, less strongly absorbed,continuum component can explain the strong `soft excess' in pg1211+143 withoutthe extreme velocity `smearing' in conflict with observed absorption linewidths. previously unpublished data from a second xmm-newton observation ofpg1211+143 is shown to be consistent with the new spectral model, finding thatthe additional continuum component dominates the spectral variability. wespeculate that this variable continuum component is powered by the highvelocity outflow.

astro-ph;0610436	suzaku observations of iron lines and reflection in agn	initial results on the iron k-shell line and reflection component in severalagn observed as part of the suzaku guaranteed time program are reviewed. thispaper discusses a small sample of compton-thin seyferts observed to date withsuzaku; namely mcg -5-23-16, mcg -6-30-15, ngc 4051, ngc 3516, ngc 2110, 3c 120and ngc 2992. the broad iron k$\alpha$ emission line appears to be present inall but one of these seyfert galaxies, while the narrow core of the line fromdistant matter is ubiquitous in all the observations. the iron line in mcg-6-30-15 shows the most extreme relativistic blurring of all the objects, thered-wing of the line requires the inner accretion disk to extend inwards towithin 2.2rg of the black hole, in agreement with the xmm-newton observations.strong excess emission in the hard x-ray detector (hxd) above 10 kev isobserved in many of these seyfert galaxies, consistent with the presence of areflection component from reprocessing in compton-thick matter (e.g. theaccretion disk). only one seyfert galaxy (ngc 2110) shows neither a broad ironline nor a reflection component. the spectral variability of mcg -6-30-15, mcg-5-23-16 and ngc 4051 is also discussed. in all 3 cases, the spectra appearharder when the source is fainter, while there is little variability of theiron line or reflection component with source flux. this agrees with a simpletwo component spectral model, whereby the variable emission is the primarypower-law, while the iron line and reflection component remain relativelyconstant.

astro-ph;0610585	an xmm-newton survey of broad iron lines in agn	we report on the iron k-alpha line properties of a sample of seyfert galaxiesobserved with the xmm-newton epic pn instrument. using a systematic and uniformanalysis, we find that complexity at iron-k is extremely common in the xmmspectra. once appropriate soft x-ray absorption, narrow 6.4 kev emission andassociated compton reflection are accounted for, ~75 of the sample show animprovement when a further gaussian component is introduced. the typicalproperties of the broad emission are both qualitatively and quantitativelyconsistent with previous results from asca. the complexity is in general verywell described by relativistic accretion disk models. in most cases thecharacteristic emission radius is constrained to be within ~50 r_g, wherestrong gravitational effects become important. we find in about 1/3 of thesample the accretion disk interpretation is strongly favoured over competingmodels. in a few objects no broad line is apparent. we find evidence foremission within 6 r_g in only two cases, both of which exhibit highly complexabsorption. evidence for black hole spin based on the x-ray spectra thereforeremains tentative.

astro-ph;0611072	the energy-dependent x-ray timing characteristics of the narrow line  seyfert 1 mkn 766	we present the energy-dependent power spectral density (psd) andcross-spectral properties of mkn 766, obtained from combining data obtainedduring an xmm-newton observation spanning six revolutions in 2005 with dataobtained from an xmm-newton long-look in 2001. the psd shapes and rms-fluxrelations are found to be consistent between the 2001 and 2005 observations,suggesting the 2005 observation is simply a low-flux extension of the 2001observation and permitting us to combine the two data sets. the resulting psdhas the highest temporal frequency resolution for any agn psd measured to date.applying a broken power-law model yields break frequencies which increase intemporal frequency with photon energy. obtaining a good fit when assumingenergy-independent break frequencies requires the presence of a lorentzian at4.6+/-0.4 * 10^-4 hz whose strength increases with photon energy, a behaviorseen in black hole x-ray binaries. the cross-spectral properties are measured;temporal frequency-dependent soft-to-hard time lags are detected in this objectfor the first time. cross-spectral results are consistent with those for otheraccreting black hole systems. the results are discussed in the context ofseveral variability models, including those based on inwardly-propagatingviscosity variations in the accretion disk.

astro-ph;0611673	the variable x-ray spectrum of markarian 766 - i. principal components  analysis	aims: we analyse a long xmm-newton spectrum of the narrow-line seyfert 1galaxy mrk 766, using the marked spectral variability on timescales &gt;20ks toseparate components in the x-ray spectrum. methods: principal componentsanalysis is used to identify distinct emission components in the x-rayspectrum, possible alternative physical models for those components are thencompared statistically. results: the source spectral variability iswell-explained by additive variations, with smaller extra contributions mostlikely arising from variable absorption. the principal varying component,eigenvector one, is found to have a steep (photon index 2.4) power-law shape,affected by a low column of ionised absorption that leads to the appearance ofa soft excess. eigenvector one varies by a factor 10 in amplitude ontime-scales of days and appears to have broad ionised fe k-alpha emissionassociated with it: the width of the ionised line is consistent with an originat about 100 gravitational radii. there is also a strong component ofnear-constant emission that dominates in the low state, whose spectrum isextremely hard above 1 kev, with a soft excess at lower energies, and with astrong edge at fe k but remarkably little fe k-alpha emission. although thiscomponent may be explained as relativistically-blurred reflection from theinner accretion disc, we suggest that its spectrum and lack of variability mayalternatively be explained as either (i) ionised reflection from an extendedregion, possibly a disc wind, or (ii) a signature of absorption by a disc windwith a variable covering fraction. absorption features in the low state mayindicate the presence of an outflow.

astro-ph;0612485	an xmm-newton view of the x-ray flat radio-quiet quasar pg 1416-129	(abridged) the radio-quiet quasar pg1416-129 (z=0.129) exhibits atypicaloptical and x-ray properties. between 1990 and 2000, in response to its opticalcontinuum decrease, the ``classical'' broad component of hbeta almostcompletely disappeared, with a factor of 10 decrease in the line flux. in thex-ray band, this object was observed by ginga in 1988 to have the hardestquasar photon index, with gamma=1.1+/-0.1. we present an xmm/epic observationof pg1416-129 performed in july 2004. we analyze the time-averaged pn spectrumof this quasar, as well as perform time-resolved spectroscopy. we find thatduring the present xmm observation, pg1416-129 still has a rather hard photonindex, both in the soft and hard energy ranges, compared to radio-quiet quasarsbut compatible with the photon index value found for radio-loud quasars. thisobject also shows long-term luminosity variability over 16 years by a factor ofthree with a variation of photon index from ~1.2 to ~1.8. in the soft energyband (0.2-2kev), we found a very weak soft x-ray excess compared to other rqquasars. the whole time averaged spectrum is fit very well either by x-rayionized reflection from the accretion disk surface, by a warm absorber-emitterplus power-law, or by a smeared absorption/emission from a relativisticoutflow. while no constant narrow fek line at 6.4kev is observed, we find thepossible presence of two non-simultaneous transient iron lines: a redshiftednarrow iron line at about 5.5kev (96.4% confidence level according tomulti-trial monte-carlo simulations) at the beginning of this observation andthe appearance of a line at 6.3-6.4kev (99.1% c.l.) at the end of theobservation. these variable lines could be generated by discrete hot-spots onthe accretion disk surface.

astro-ph;9911475	pds 456: an extreme accretion rate quasar?	we present quasi-simultaneous asca and rxte observations of the most luminousknown agn in the local (z&lt;0.3) universe, the recently discovered quasar pds456. multiwavelength observations have been conducted which show that pds 456has a bolometric luminosity of 10^47 erg/s peaking in the uv part of thespectrum. in the x-ray band the 2-10 kev (rest-frame) luminosity is 10^45erg/s. the broad-band x-ray spectrum obtained with asca and rxte containsconsiderable complexity. the most striking feature observed is a very deep,ionised iron k edge, observed at 8.7 kev in the quasar rest-frame. we find thatthese features are consistent with reprocessing from highly ionised matter,probably the inner accretion disk. pds 456 appeared to show a strong (factor of2.1) outburst in just 17ksec, although non-intrinsic sources cannot becompletely ruled out. if confirmed, this would be an unusual event for such ahigh-luminosity source, with the light-crossing-time corresponding to 2schwarzschild radii. the implication would be that flaring occurs within thevery central regions, or else that pds 456 is a `super-eddington' orrelativistically beamed system. overall we conclude on the basis of the extremeblue/uv luminosity, the rapid x-ray variability and from the imprint of highlyionised material on the x-ray spectrum, that pds 456 is a quasar with anunusually high accretion rate.

0810.1249	a comprehensive x-ray spectral analysis of the seyfert 1.5 ngc 3227	we present results of a 100 ks xmm observation of the seyfert 1.5 ngc 3227.our best-fit broadband model to the pn spectrum consists of a moderately flat(photon index 1.57) hard x-ray power-law absorbed by cold gas with n_h = 3 *10^21 cm^-2, plus a strong soft excess, modeled as a steep power law with aphoton index of 3.35, absorbed by cold gas with n_h = 9 * 10^20 cm^-2. the softexcess normalization increases by ~20% in ~20 ks, independently of the hardx-ray component, and the uv continuum, tracked via the om, also shows a strongincreasing trend over the observation, consistent with reprocessing of softx-ray emission. warm absorber signatures are evident in both the epic and rgs;we model two layers, with log(xi) = 1.2 and 2.9 erg cm s^-1, and with similarcolumn densities (~1-2 * 10^21 cm^-2). the outflow velocities relative tosystemic of the high- and low-ionization absorbers are estimated to be-(2060(+240,-170)) km/s and -(420(+430,-190)) km/s, respectively. the fe kalpha line width fwhm is 7000 +/- 1500 km/s; its inferred radius is consistentwith the blr and with the inner radius of the dust reverberation-mapped bysuganuma et al. an emission feature near 6.0 kev is modeled equally well as anarrow redshifted fe k line, possibly associated with a disk "hot-spot," or asthe red wing to a relativistically broadened fe line profile. swift-bat andarchival rxte data suggest at most weak compton reflection (r &lt;~ 0.5), and ahigh-energy cutoff near 100 kev. from rxte monitoring, we find tentativeevidence for a significant fraction of the fe line flux to track continuumvariations on time scales &lt; 700 days.

0811.0692	x-ray spectral variability of the seyfert galaxy ngc 4051 observed with  suzaku	we report results from a suzaku observation of the narrow-line seyfert 1 ngc4051. during our observation, large amplitude rapid variability is seen and theaveraged 2--10 kev flux is 8.1x10^-12 erg s^-1 cm^-2, which is several timeslower than the historical average. the x-ray spectrum hardens when the sourceflux becomes lower, confirming the trend of spectral variability known for manyseyfert 1 galaxies. the broad-band averaged spectrum and spectra in high andlow flux intervals are analyzed. the spectra are first fitted with a modelconsisting of a power-law component, a reflection continuum originating in coldmatter, a blackbody component, two zones of ionized absorber, and severalgaussian emission lines. the amount of reflection is rather large (r ~ 7, wherer=1 corresponds to reflection by an infinite slab), while the equivalent widthof the fe-k line at 6.4 kev is modest (140 ev) for the averaged spectrum. wethen model the overall spectra by introducing partial covering for thepower-law component and reflection continuum independently. the column densityfor the former is 1x10^23 cm^-2, while it is fixed at 1x10^24 cm-2 for thelatter. by comparing the spectra in different flux states, we identify thecauses of spectral variability.
