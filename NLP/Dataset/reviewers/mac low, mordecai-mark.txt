0902.0386	type-ia supernova-driven galactic bulge wind	stellar feedback in galactic bulges plays an essential role in shaping theevolution of galaxies. to quantify this role and facilitate comparisons withx-ray observations, we conduct 3d hydrodynamical simulations with the adaptivemesh refinement code, flash, to investigate the physical properties of hot gasinside a galactic bulge, similar to that of our galaxy or m31. we assume thatthe dynamical and thermal properties of the hot gas are dominated by mechanicalenergy input from sne, primarily type ia, and mass injection from evolved starsas well as iron enrichment from sne. we study the bulge-wide outflow as well asthe sn heating on scales down to ~4 pc. an embedding scheme that is devised toplant individual snr seeds, allows to examine, for the first time, the effectof sporadic sne on the density, temperature, and iron ejecta distribution ofthe hot gas as well as the resultant x-ray morphology and spectrum. we findthat the sne produce a bulge wind with highly filamentary density structuresand patchy ejecta. compared with a 1d spherical wind model, the non-uniformityof simulated gas density, temperature, and metallicity substantially alters thespectral shape and increases the diffuse x-ray luminosity. the differentialemission measure as a function of temperature of the simulated gas exhibits alog-normal distribution, with a peak value much lower than that of thecorresponding 1d model. the bulk of the x-ray emission comes from therelatively low temperature and low abundance gas shells associated with snblastwaves. sn ejecta are not well mixed with the ambient medium, at least inthe bulge region. these results, at least partly, account for the apparent lackof evidence for iron enrichment in the soft x-ray-emitting gas in galacticbulges and intermediate-mass elliptical galaxies.[...]

0903.0374	young stellar clusters and star formation throughout the galaxy	most stars are born in rich young stellar clusters (yscs) embedded in giantmolecular clouds. the most massive stars live out their short lives there,profoundly influencing their natal environments by ionizing hii regions,inflating wind-blown bubbles, and soon exploding as supernovae. thousands oflower-mass pre-main sequence stars accompany the massive stars, and theexpanding hii regions paradoxically trigger new star formation as they destroytheir natal clouds. while this schematic picture is established, ourunderstanding of the complex astrophysical processes involved in clustered starformation have only just begun to be elucidated. the technologies arechallenging, requiring both high spatial resolution and wide fields atwavelengths that penetrate obscuring molecular material and removecontaminating galactic field stars. we outline several important projects forthe coming decade: the imfs and structures of yscs; triggered star formationaround ysc; the fate of ob winds; the stellar populations of infrared darkclouds; the most massive star clusters in the galaxy; tracing star formationthroughout the galactic disk; the galactic center region and yscs in themagellanic clouds. programmatic recommendations include: developing a 30m-classadaptive optics infrared telescope; support for high-resolution and wide fieldx-ray telescopes; large-aperture sub-millimeter and far-infrared telescopes;multi-object infrared spectrographs; and both numerical and analytical theory.

0907.1897	planetesimal and protoplanet dynamics in a turbulent protoplanetary  disk: ideal unstratified disks	the dynamics of planetesimals and planetary cores may be strongly influencedby density perturbations driven by magneto-rotational turbulence in their natalprotoplanetary gas disks. using the local shearing box approximation, weperform numerical simulations of planetesimals moving as massless particles ina turbulent, magnetized, unstratified gas disk. our fiducial disk model showsturbulent accretion characterized by a shakura-sunyaev viscosity parameter of$\alpha \sim 10^{-2}$, with root-mean-square density perturbations of$\sim$10%. we measure the statistical evolution of particle orbital propertiesin our simulations including mean radius, eccentricity, and velocitydispersion. we confirm random walk growth in time of all three properties, thefirst time that this has been done with direct orbital integration in a localmodel. we find that the growth rate increases with the box size used at leastup to boxes of eight scale heights in horizontal size. however, even ourlargest boxes show velocity dispersions sufficiently low that collisionaldestruction of planetesimals should be unimportant in the inner disk throughoutits lifetime. our direct integrations agree with earlier torque measurementsshowing that type i migration dominates over diffusive migration by stochastictorques for most objects in the planetary core and terrestrial planet massrange. diffusive migration remains important for objects in the mass range ofkilometer-sized planetesimals. discrepancies in the derived magnitude ofturbulence between local and global simulations of magneto-rotationallyunstable disks remains an open issue, with important consequences for planetformation scenarios.

0909.0259	particle clumping and planetesimal formation depend strongly on  metallicity	we present three-dimensional numerical simulations of particle clumping andplanetesimal formation in protoplanetary disks with varying amounts of solidmaterial. as centimeter-size pebbles settle to the mid-plane, turbulencedevelops through vertical shearing and streaming instabilities. we find thatwhen the pebble-to-gas column density ratio is 0.01, corresponding roughly tosolar metallicity, clumping is weak, so the pebble density rarely exceeds thegas density. doubling the column density ratio leads to a dramatic increase inclumping, with characteristic particle densities more than ten times the gasdensity and maximum densities reaching several thousand times the gas density.this is consistent with unstratified simulations of the streaming instabilitythat show strong clumping in particle dominated flows. the clumps readilycontract gravitationally into interacting planetesimals of order 100 km inradius. our results suggest that the correlation between host star metallicityand exoplanets may reflect the early stages of planet formation. we furtherspeculate that initially low metallicity disks can be particle enriched duringthe gas dispersal phase, leading to a late burst of planetesimal formation.

1001.2470	h ii regions: witnesses to massive star formation	we describe the first three-dimensional simulation of the gravitationalcollapse of a massive, rotating molecular cloud that includes heating by bothnon-ionizing and ionizing radiation. we find that as the first protostars gainsufficient mass to ionize the accretion flow, their h ii regions are initiallygravitationally trapped, but soon begin to rapidly fluctuate between trappedand extended states, in agreement with observations. over time, the sameultracompact h ii region can expand anisotropically, contract again, and takeon any of the observed morphological classes. in their extended phases,expanding h ii regions drive bipolar neutral outflows characteristic ofhigh-mass star formation. the total lifetime of h ii regions is given by theglobal accretion timescale, rather than their short internal sound-crossingtime. the pressure of the hot, ionized gas does not terminate accretion.instead the final stellar mass is set by fragmentation-induced starvation.local gravitational instabilities in the accretion flow lead to the build-up ofa small cluster of stars, all with relatively high masses due to heating fromaccretion radiation. these companions subsequently compete with the initialhigh-mass star for the same common gas reservoir and limit its mass growth. ourfindings show that the most significant differences between the formation oflow-mass and high-mass stars are all explained as the result of rapid accretionwithin a dense, gravitationally unstable, ionized flow.

1003.4998	understanding spatial and spectral morphologies of ultracompact h ii  regions	the spatial morphology, spectral characteristics, and time variability ofultracompact h ii regions provide strong constraints on the process of massivestar formation. we have performed simulations of the gravitational collapse ofrotating molecular cloud cores, including treatments of the propagation ofionizing and non-ionizing radiation. we here present synthetic radio continuumobservations of h ii regions from our collapse simulations, to investigate howwell they agree with observation, and what we can learn about how massive starformation proceeds. we find that intermittent shielding by dense filaments inthe gravitationally unstable accretion flow around the massive star leads tohighly variable h ii regions that do not grow monotonically, but ratherflicker, growing and shrinking repeatedly. this behavior appears able toresolve the well-known lifetime problem. we find that multiple ionizing sourcesgenerally form, resulting in groups of ultracompact h ii regions, consistentwith observations. we confirm that our model reproduces the qualitative h iiregion morphologies found in surveys, with generally consistent relativefrequencies. we also find that simulated spectral energy distributions (seds)from our model are consistent with the range of observed h ii region seds,including both regions showing a normal transition from optically thick tooptically thin emission, and those with intermediate spectral slopes. in ourmodels, anomalous slopes are solely produced by inhomogeneities in the h iiregion, with no contribution from dust emission at millimeter or submillimeterwavelengths. we conclude that many observed characteristics of ultracompact hii regions appear consistent with massive star formation in fast,gravitationally unstable, accretion flows.

1005.1085	the origin of the hot gas in the galactic halo: confronting models with  xmm-newton observations	we compare the predictions of three physical models for the origin of the hothalo gas with the observed halo x-ray emission, derived from 26 high-latitudexmm-newton observations of the soft x-ray background between $l=120\degr$ and$l=240\degr$. these observations were chosen from a much larger set ofobservations as they are expected to be the least contaminated by solar windcharge exchange emission. we characterize the halo emission in the xmm-newtonband with a single-temperature plasma model. we find that the observed halotemperature is fairly constant across the sky (~1.8e6-2.3e6 k), whereas thehalo emission measure varies by an order of magnitude (~0.0005-0.006 cm^-6 pc).when we compare our observations with the model predictions, we find that mostof the hot gas observed with xmm-newton does not reside in isolated extraplanarsupernova remnants -- this model predicts emission an order of magnitude toofaint. a model of a supernova-driven interstellar medium, including the flow ofhot gas from the disk into the halo in a galactic fountain, gives goodagreement with the observed 0.4-2.0 kev surface brightness. this modeloverpredicts the halo x-ray temperature by a factor of ~2, but there are aseveral possible explanations for this discrepancy. we therefore conclude thata major (possibly dominant) contributor to the halo x-ray emission observedwith xmm-newton is a fountain of hot gas driven into the halo by disksupernovae. however, we cannot rule out the possibility that the extended hothalo of accreted material predicted by disk galaxy formation models alsocontributes to the emission.

1005.3271	limiting accretion onto massive stars by fragmentation-induced  starvation	massive stars influence their surroundings through radiation, winds, andsupernova explosions far out of proportion to their small numbers. however, thephysical processes that initiate and govern the birth of massive stars remainpoorly understood. two widely discussed models are monolithic collapse ofmolecular cloud cores and competitive accretion. to learn more about massivestar formation, we perform simulations of the collapse of rotating, massive,cloud cores including radiative heating by both non-ionizing and ionizingradiation using the flash adaptive mesh refinement code. these simulations showfragmentation from gravitational instability in the enormously dense accretionflows required to build up massive stars. secondary stars form rapidly in theseflows and accrete mass that would have otherwise been consumed by the massivestar in the center, in a process that we term fragmentation-induced starvation.this explains why massive stars are usually found as members of high-orderstellar systems that themselves belong to large clusters containing stars ofall masses. the radiative heating does not prevent fragmentation, but does leadto a higher jeans mass, resulting in fewer and more massive stars than wouldform without the heating. this mechanism reproduces the observed relationbetween the total stellar mass in the cluster and the mass of the largest star.it predicts strong clumping and filamentary structure in the center ofcollapsing cores, as has recently been observed. we speculate that a similarmechanism will act during primordial star formation.

1007.3530	modeling high-mass star formation and ultracompact hii regions	massive stars influence the surrounding universe far out of proportion totheir numbers through ionizing radiation, supernova explosions, and heavyelement production. their formation requires the collapse of massiveinterstellar gas clouds with very high accretion rates. we discuss results fromthe first three-dimensional simulations of the gravitational collapse of amassive, rotating molecular cloud core that include heating by bothnon-ionizing and ionizing radiation. local gravitational instabilities in theaccretion flow lead to the build-up of a small cluster of stars. theselower-mass companions subsequently compete with the high-mass star for the samecommon gas reservoir and limit its overall mass growth. this process is calledfragmentation-induced starvation, and explains why massive stars are usuallyfound as members of high-order stellar systems. these simulations also showthat the hii regions forming around massive stars are initially trapped by theinfalling gas, but soon begin to fluctuate rapidly. over time, the sameultracompact hii region can expand anisotropically, contract again, and take onany of the observed morphological classes. the total lifetime of hii regions isgiven by the global accretion timescale, rather than their short internalsound-crossing time. this solves the so-called lifetime problem of ultracompacthii region. we conclude that the the most significant differences between theformation of low-mass and high-mass stars are all explained as the result ofrapid accretion within a dense, gravitationally unstable flow.

1007.5348	photoionization of high altitude gas in a supernova-driven turbulent  interstellar medium	we investigate models for the photoionization of the widespread diffuseionized gas in galaxies. in particular we address the long standing question ofthe penetration of lyman continuum photons from sources close to the galacticmidplane to large heights in the galactic halo. we find that recenthydrodynamical simulations of a supernova-driven interstellar medium have lowdensity paths and voids that allow for ionizing photons from midplane ob starsto reach and ionize gas many kiloparsecs above the midplane. we find ionizingfluxes throughout our simulation grids are larger than predicted by onedimensional slab models, thus allowing for photoionization by o stars of lowaltitude neutral clouds in the galaxy that are also detected in halpha. inprevious studies of such clouds the photoionization scenario had been rejectedand the halpha had been attributed to enhanced cosmic ray ionization orscattered light from midplane h ii regions. we do find that the emissionmeasure distributions in our simulations are wider than those derived fromhalpha observations in the milky way. in addition, the horizontally averagedheight dependence of the gas density in the hydrodynamical models is lower thaninferred in the galaxy. these discrepancies are likely due to the absence ofmagnetic fields in the hydrodynamic simulations and we discuss howmagnetohydrodynamic effects may reconcile models and observations.nevertheless, we anticipate that the inclusion of magnetic fields in thedynamical simulations will not alter our primary finding that midplane ob starsare capable of producing high altitude diffuse ionized gas in a realisticthree-dimensional interstellar medium.

0708.3243	large-scale gravitational instability and star formation in the large  magellanic cloud	large-scale star formation in disk galaxies is hypothesized to be driven byglobal gravitational instability. the observed gas surface density is commonlyused to compute the strength of gravitational instability, but according tothis criterion star formation often appears to occur in gravitationally stableregions. one possible reason is that the stellar contribution to theinstability has been neglected. we have examined the gravitational instabilityof the large magellanic cloud (lmc) considering the gas alone, and consideringthe combination of collisional gas and collisionless stars. we compare thegravitationally unstable regions with the on-going star formation revealed byspitzer observations of young stellar objects. although only 62% of the massiveyoung stellar object candidates are in regions where the gas alone is unstable,some 85% lie in regions unstable due to the combination of gas and stars. thecombined stability analysis better describes where star formation occurs. inagreement with other observations and numerical models, a small fraction of thestar formation occurs in regions with gravitational stability parameter q &gt; 1.we further measure the dependence of the star formation timescale on thestrength of gravitational instability, and quantitatively compare it to theexponential dependence expected from numerical simulations.

0708.3890	rapid planetesimal formation in turbulent circumstellar discs	the initial stages of planet formation in circumstellar gas discs proceed viadust grains that collide and build up larger and larger bodies (safronov 1969).how this process continues from metre-sized boulders to kilometre-scaleplanetesimals is a major unsolved problem (dominik et al. 2007): boulders sticktogether poorly (benz 2000), and spiral into the protostar in a few hundredorbits due to a head wind from the slower rotating gas (weidenschilling 1977).gravitational collapse of the solid component has been suggested to overcomethis barrier (safronov 1969, goldreich &amp; ward 1973, youdin &amp; shu 2002). evenlow levels of turbulence, however, inhibit sedimentation of solids to asufficiently dense midplane layer (weidenschilling &amp; cuzzi 1993, dominik et al.2007), but turbulence must be present to explain observed gas accretion inprotostellar discs (hartmann 1998). here we report the discovery of efficientgravitational collapse of boulders in locally overdense regions in themidplane. the boulders concentrate initially in transient high pressures in theturbulent gas (johansen, klahr, &amp; henning 2006), and these concentrations areaugmented a further order of magnitude by a streaming instability (youdin &amp;goodman 2005, johansen, henning, &amp; klahr 2006, johansen &amp; youdin 2007) drivenby the relative flow of gas and solids. we find that gravitationally boundclusters form with masses comparable to dwarf planets and containing adistribution of boulder sizes. gravitational collapse happens much faster thanradial drift, offering a possible path to planetesimal formation in accretingcircumstellar discs.

0708.3893	supplementary information for ``rapid planetesimal formation in  turbulent circumstellar discs''	this document contains refereed supplementary information for the paper``rapid planetesimal formation in turbulent circumstellar discs''. it contains15 sections (\s1.1 -- \s1.15) that address a number of subjects related to themain paper. we describe in detail the poisson solver used to find theself-potential of the solid particles, including a linear and a non-linear testproblem (\s1.3). dissipative collisions remove energy from the motion of theparticles by collisional cooling (\s1.4), an effect that allows gravitationalcollapse to occur in somewhat less massive discs (\s1.7). a resolution study ofthe gravitational collapse of the boulders is presented in \s1.6. we find thatgravitational collapse can occur in progressively less massive discs as thegrid resolution is increased, likely due to the decreased smoothing of theparticle-mesh self-gravity solver with increasing resolution. in \s1.10 we showthat it is in good agreement with the goldreich &amp; ward (1973) stabilityanalysis to form several-hundred-km-sized bodies, when the analysis is appliedto 5 au and to regions of increased boulder column density. \s11 is devoted tothe measurement of random speeds and collision speeds between boulders. we findgood agreement between our measurements and analytical theory for the randomspeeds, but the measured collision speeds are 3 times lower than expected fromanalytical theory. higher resolution studies, and an improved analytical theoryof collision speeds that takes into account epicyclic motion, will be needed todetermine whether collision speeds have converged. in \s1.12 we present modelswith no magnetic fields. the boulder layer still exhibits strong clumping, dueto the streaming instability, if the global solids-to-gas ratio is increased bya factor 3. gravitational collapse occurs as readily as in magnetised discs.

1010.4374	on the alpha formalism for the common envelope interaction	the {\alpha}-formalism is a common way to parametrize the common envelopeinteraction between a giant star and a more compact companion. the {\alpha}parameter describes the fraction of orbital energy released by the companionthat is available to eject the giant star's envelope. by using new, detailedstellar evolutionary calculations we derive a user-friendly prescription forthe {\lambda} parameter and an improved approximation for the envelope bindingenergy, thus revising the {\alpha} equation. we then determine {\alpha} bothfrom simulations and observations in a self consistent manner. by using our ownstellar structure models as well as population considerations to reconstructthe primary's parameters at the time of the common envelope interaction, wegain a deeper understanding of the uncertainties. we find that systems withvery low values of q (the ratio of the companion's mass to the mass of theprimary at the time of the common envelope interaction) have higher values of{\alpha}. a fit to the data suggests that lower mass companions are left atcomparable or larger orbital separations to more massive companions. weconjecture that lower mass companions take longer than a stellar dynamical timeto spiral in to the giant's core, and that this is key to allowing the giant touse its own thermal energy to help unbind its envelope. as a result, althoughsystems with light companions might not have enough orbital energy to unbindthe common envelope, they might stimulate a stellar reaction that results inthe common envelope ejection.

1010.5905	the interplay of magnetic fields, fragmentation and ionization feedback  in high-mass star formation	massive stars disproportionately influence their surroundings. how they formhas only started to become clear recently through radiation gas dynamicalsimulations. however, until now, no simulation has simultaneously included bothmagnetic fields and ionizing radiation. here we present the results from thefirst radiation-magnetohydrodynamical (rmhd) simulation including ionizationfeedback, comparing an rmhd model of a 1000 m_sol rotating cloud to earlierradiation gas dynamical models with the same initial density and velocitydistributions. we find that despite starting with a strongly supercritical massto flux ratio, the magnetic field has three effects. first, the field offerslocally support against gravitational collapse in the accretion flow,substantially reducing the amount of secondary fragmentation in comparison tothe gas dynamical case. second, the field drains angular momentum from thecollapsing gas, further increasing the amount of material available foraccretion by the central, massive, protostar, and thus increasing its finalmass by about 50% from the purely gas dynamical case. third, the field is woundup by the rotation of the flow, driving a tower flow. however, this flow neverachieves the strength seen in low-mass star formation simulations for tworeasons: gravitational fragmentation disrupts the circular flow in the centralregions where the protostars form, and the expanding h ii regions tend tofurther disrupt the field geometry. therefore, outflows driven by ionizationheating look likely to be more dynamically important in regions of massive starformation.

1011.3054	the abundance of molecular hydrogen and its correlation with midplane  pressure in galaxies: non-equilibrium, turbulent, chemical models	observations of spiral galaxies show a strong linear correlation between theratio of molecular to atomic hydrogen surface density r_mol and midplanepressure. to explain this, we simulate three-dimensional, magnetizedturbulence, including simplified treatments of non-equilibrium chemistry andthe propagation of dissociating radiation, to follow the formation of h_2 fromcold atomic gas. the formation time scale for h_2 is sufficiently long thatequilibrium is not reached within the 20-30 myr lifetimes of molecular clouds.the equilibrium balance between radiative dissociation and h_2 formation ondust grains fails to predict the time-dependent molecular fractions we find. asimple, time-dependent model of h_2 formation can reproduce the gross behavior,although turbulent density perturbations increase molecular fractions by afactor of few above it. in contradiction to equilibrium models, radiativedissociation of molecules plays little role in our model for diffuse radiationfields with strengths less than ten times that of the solar neighborhood,because of the effective self-shielding of h_2. the observed correlation ofr_mol with pressure corresponds to a correlation with local gas density if theeffective temperature in the cold neutral medium of galactic disks is roughlyconstant. we indeed find such a correlation of r_mol with density. if weexamine the value of r_mol in our local models after a free-fall time at theiraverage density, as expected for models of molecular cloud formation bylarge-scale gravitational instability, our models reproduce the observedcorrelation over more than an order of magnitude range in density.

1102.5093	magnetorotational turbulence transports angular momentum in stratified  disks with low magnetic prandtl number but magnetic reynolds number above a  critical value	the magnetorotational instability (mri) may dominate outward transport ofangular momentum in accretion disks, allowing material to fall onto the centralobject. previous work has established that the mri can drive a mean-fielddynamo, possibly leading to a self-sustaining accretion system. recently,however, simulations of the scaling of the angular momentum transport parameter$\alphass$ with the magnetic prandtl number $\prandtl$ have cast doubt on theability of the mri to transport astrophysically relevant amounts of angularmomentum in real disk systems. here, we use simulations including explicitphysical viscosity and resistivity to show that when vertical stratification isincluded, mean field dynamo action operates, driving the system to aconfiguration in which the magnetic field is not fully helical. this relaxesthe constraints on the generated field provided by magnetic helicityconservation, allowing the generation of a mean field on timescales independentof the resistivity. our models demonstrate the existence of a critical magneticreynolds number $\rmagc$, below which transport becomes strongly$\prandtl$-dependent and chaotic, but above which the transport is steady and$\prandtl$-independent. prior simulations showing $\prandtl$-dependence had$\rmag &lt; \rmagc$. we conjecture that this steady regime is possible because themean field dynamo is not helicity-limited and thus does not depend on thedetails of the helicity ejection process. scaling to realistic astrophysicalparameters suggests that disks around both protostars and stellar mass blackholes have $\rmag &gt;&gt; \rmagc$. thus, we suggest that the strong $\prandtl$dependence seen in recent simulations does not occur in real systems.

0709.3530	star formation at very low metallicity. iv. fragmentation does not  depend on metallicity for cold initial conditions	primordial star formation appears to result in stars at least an order ofmagnitude more massive than modern star formation. it has been proposed thatthe transition from primordial to modern initial mass functions occurs due tothe onset of effective metal line cooling at a metallicity z/z_sun = 10^{-3.5}.however, these simulations neglected molecular hydrogen cooling. we performsimulations using the same initial conditions, but including molecular cooling,using a complex network that follows molecular hydrogen formation and alsodirectly follows carbon monoxide and water. we find that molecular hydrogencooling allows roughly equivalent fragmentation to proceed even at zerometallicity for these initial conditions. the apparent transition justrepresents the point where metal line cooling becomes more important thanmolecular cooling. in all cases, the fragments are massive enough to beconsistent with models of primordial stellar masses, suggesting that thetransition to the modern initial mass function may be determined by otherphysics such as dust formation. we conclude that such additional coolingmechanisms, combined with the exact initial conditions produced by cosmologicalcollapse are likely more important than metal line cooling in determining theinitial mass function, and thus that there is unlikely to be a sharp transitionin the initial mass function at z/z_sun = 10^{-3.5}.

1105.1348	time variability in simulated ultracompact and hypercompact hii regions	ultracompact and hypercompact hii regions appear when a star with a masslarger than about 15 solar masses starts to ionize its own environment. recentobservations of time variability in these objects are one of the pieces ofevidence that suggest that at least some of them harbor stars that are stillaccreting from an infalling neutral accretion flow that becomes ionized in itsinnermost part. we present an analysis of the properties of the hii regionsformed in the 3d radiation-hydrodynamic simulations presented by peters et al.as a function of time. flickering of the hii regions is a natural outcome ofthis model. the radio-continuum fluxes of the simulated hii regions, as well astheir flux and size variations are in agreement with the availableobservations. from the simulations, we estimate that a small but non-negligiblefraction (~ 10 %) of observed hii regions should have detectable fluxvariations (larger than 10 %) on timescales of ~ 10 years, with positivevariations being more likely to happen than negative variations. a novel resultof these simulations is that negative flux changes do happen, in contrast tothe simple expectation of ever growing hii regions. we also explore thetemporal correlations between properties that are directly observed (flux andsize) and other quantities like density and ionization rates.

1202.1868	orbital migration of interacting low-mass planets in evolutionary  radiative turbulent models	the torques exerted by a locally isothermal disk on an embedded planet leadto rapid inward migration. recent work has shown that modeling thethermodynamics without the assumption of local isothermality reveals regionswhere the net torque on an embedded planet is positive, leading to outwardmigration of the planet. when a region with negative torque lies directlyexterior to this, planets in the inner region migrate outwards and planets inthe outer region migrate inwards, converging where the torque is zero. weincorporate the torques from an evolving non-isothermal disk into an n-bodysimulation to examine the behavior of planets or planetary embryos interactingin the convergence zone. we find that mutual interactions do not eject objectsfrom the convergence zone. small numbers of objects in a laminar disk settleinto near resonant orbits that remain stable over the 10 myr periods that weexamine. however, either or both increasing the number of planets or includinga correlated, stochastic force to represent turbulence drives orbit crossingsand mergers in the convergence zone. these processes can build gas giant coreswith masses of order ten earth masses from sub-earth mass embryos in 2-3 myr.

1204.5711	rossby wave instability at dead zone boundaries in 3d resistive  magnetohydrodynamical global models of protoplanetary disks	it has been suggested that the transition between magnetorotationally activeand dead zones in protoplanetary disks should be prone to the excitation ofvortices via rossby wave instability (rwi). however, the only numericalevidence for this has come from alpha disk models, where the magnetic fieldevolution is not followed, and the effect of turbulence is parametrized bylaplacian viscosity. we aim to establish the phenomenology of the flow in thetransition in 3d resistive-magnetohydrodynamical models. we model thetransition by a sharp jump in resistivity, as expected in the inner dead zoneboundary, using the pencil code to simulate the flow. we find that vortices arereadily excited in the dead side of the transition. we measure the massaccretion rate finding similar levels of reynolds stress at the dead and activezones, at the $\alpha\approx 10^{-2}$ level. the vortex sits in a pressuremaximum and does not migrate, surviving until the end of the simulation. apressure maximum in the active zone also triggers the rwi. the magnetizedvortex that results should be disrupted by parasitical magneto-ellipticinstabilities, yet it subsists in high resolution. this suggests that eitherthe parasitic modes are still numerically damped, or that the rwi suppliesvorticity faster than they can destroy it. we conclude that the resistivetransition between the active and dead zones in the inner regions ofprotoplanetary disks, if sharp enough, can indeed excite vortices via rwi. ourresults lend credence to previous works that relied on the alpha-diskapproximation, and caution against the use of overly reduced azimuthal coverageon modeling this transition.

1206.7096	short circuits in thermally ionized plasmas: a mechanism for  intermittent heating of protoplanetary disks	many astrophysical systems of interest, including protoplanetary accretiondisks, are made of turbu- lent magnetized gas with near solar metallicity.thermal ionization of alkali metals in such gas exceeds non-thermal ionizationwhen temperatures climb above roughly 1000 k. as a result, the conductiv- ity,proportional to the ionization fraction, gains a strong, positive dependence ontemperature. in this paper, we demonstrate that this relation between thetemperature and the conductivity triggers an exponential instability that actssimilarly to an electrical short, where the increased conductivity concentratesthe current and locally increases the ohmic heating. this contrasts with theresistiv- ity increase expected in an ideal magnetic reconnection region. theinstability acts to focus narrow current sheets into even narrower sheets withfar higher currents and temparatures. we lay out the basic principles of thisbehavior in this paper using protoplanetary disks as our example host system,motivated by observations of chondritic meteorites and their ancestors, dustgrains in protoplanetary disks, that reveal the existence of strong, frequentheating events that this instability could explain.

1210.0879	on the survival of brown dwarfs and planets engulfed by their giant host  star	the recent discovery of two earth-mass planets in close orbits around anevolved star has raised questions as to whether substellar companions cansurvive encounters with their host stars. we consider whether these companionscould have been stripped of significant amounts of mass during the phase whenthey orbited through the dense inner envelopes of the giant. we apply thecriterion derived by murray et al. for disruption of gravitationally boundobjects by ram pressure, to determine whether mass loss may have played a rolein the histories of these and other recently discovered low-mass companions toevolved stars. we find that the brown dwarf and jovian mass objects circling wd0137-349, sdss j08205+0008, and hip 13044 are most unlikely to have lostsignificant mass during the common envelope phase. however, the earth-massplanets found around kic 05807616 could well be the remnant of one or twojovian mass planets that lost extensive mass during the common envelope phase.

1210.7723	from gas to stars over cosmic time	the formation of stars from gas drives the evolution of galaxies. yet, itremains one of the hardest processes to understand when trying to connectobservations of stellar and galaxy populations to models of large scalestructure formation. the star formation rate at redshifts z &gt; 2 drops offrather more quickly than was thought even five years ago. theoretical modelshave tended to overpredict the star formation rate at these high redshiftssubstantially, primarily due to overcooling. overcooling in galaxies typicallyoccurs because of unphysical radiative cooling. as a result, insufficientturbulence is driven by stellar feedback. i show that such turbulence has thenet effect of strongly inhibiting star formation, despite its ability tolocally promote star formation by compression. radiation pressure appears lesslikely to be a dominant driver of the turbulence than has been argued, butsupernova and magnetorotational instabilities remain viable. gravity alonecannot be the main driver, as otherwise well-resolved models without feedbackwould accurately predict star formation rates. star formation rate surfacedensity correlates well with observed molecular gas surface density, as well aswith other tracers of high density material. correlation does not, however,imply causation. it appears that both molecule formation and star formationoccur as a consequence of gravitational collapse, with molecules not essentialin cooling. the basic concept that gravitational instability drives starformation remains a true guide through the thickets of complexity surroundingthis topic. i finally briefly note that understanding ionization heating andradiation pressure from the most massive stars will likely require much higherresolution models (sub-parsec scale) than resolving supernova feedback.(lightly abridged)

1211.1071	the effect of feedback and reionization on star formation in low-mass  dwarf galaxy haloes	we simulate the evolution of a 10^9 msun dark matter halo in a cosmologicalsetting with an adaptive-mesh refinement code as an analogue to local lowluminosity dwarf irregular and dwarf spheroidal galaxies. the primary goal ofour study is to investigate the roles of reionization and supernova feedback indetermining the star formation histories of low mass dwarf galaxies. we includea wide range of physical effects, including metal cooling, molecular hydrogenformation and cooling, photoionization and photodissociation from ametagalactic background, a simple prescription for self-shielding, starformation, and a simple model for supernova driven energetic feedback. we carryout simulations excluding each major effect in turn. we find that reionizationis primarily responsible for expelling most of the gas in our simulations, butthat supernova feedback is required to disperse the dense, cold gas in the coreof the halo. moreover, we show that the timing of reionization can produce anorder of magnitude difference in the final stellar mass of the system. for ourfull physics run with reionization at z=9, we find a stellar mass of about 10^5msun at z=0, and a mass-to-light ratio within the half-light radius ofapproximately 130 msun/lsun, consistent with observed low-luminosity dwarfs.however, the resulting median stellar metallicity is 0.06 zsun, considerablylarger than observed systems. in addition, we find star formation is truncatedbetween redshifts 4 and 7, at odds with the observed late time star formationin isolated dwarf systems but in agreement with milky way ultrafaint dwarfspheroidals. we investigate the efficacy of energetic feedback in our simplethermal-energy driven feedback scheme, and suggest that it may still sufferfrom excessive radiative losses, despite reaching stellar particle masses ofabout 100 msun, and a comoving spatial resolution of 11 pc.

1301.1698	mineral processing by short circuits in protoplanetary disks	meteoritic chondrules were formed in the early solar system by brief heatingof silicate dust to melting temperatures. some highly refractory grains (type bcalcium-aluminum-rich inclusions, cais) also show signs of transient heating. asimilar process may occur in other protoplanetary disks, as evidenced byobservations of spectra characteristic of crystalline silicates. one possibleenvironment for this process is the turbulent magnetohydrodynamic flow thoughtto drive accretion in these disks. such flows generally form thin currentsheets, which are sites of magnetic reconnection, and dissipate the magneticfields amplified by a disk dynamo. we suggest that it is possible to heatprecursor grains for chondrules and other high-temperature minerals in currentsheets that have been concentrated by our recently described short-circuitinstability. we extend our work on this process by including the effects ofradiative cooling, taking into account the temperature dependence of theopacity; and by examining current sheet geometry in three-dimensional, globalmodels of magnetorotational instability. we find that temperatures above 1600 kcan be reached for favorable parameters that match the ideal global models.this mechanism could provide an efficient means of tapping the gravitationalpotential energy of the protoplanetary disk to heat grains strongly enough toform high-temperature minerals. the volume-filling nature of turbulent magneticreconnection is compatible with constraints from chondrule-matrixcomplementarity, chondrule-chondrule complementarity, the occurrence of igneousrims, and compound chondrules. the same short-circuit mechanism may performother high-temperature mineral processing in protoplanetary disks such as theproduction of crystalline silicates and cais.

1404.5463	collective outflow from a small multiple stellar system	the formation of high-mass stars is usually accompanied by powerfulprotostellar outflows. such high-mass outflows are not simply scaled-upversions of their lower-mass counterparts, since observations suggest that thecollimation degree degrades with stellar mass. theoretically, the origins ofmassive outflows remain open to question because radiative feedback andfragmentation of the accretion flow around the most massive stars, with m &gt; 15m_sun, may impede the driving of magnetic disk winds. we here present athree-dimensional simulation of the early stages of core fragmentation andmassive star formation that includes a subgrid-scale model for protostellaroutflows. we find that stars that form in a common accretion flow tend to havealigned outflow axes, so that the individual jets of multiple stars can combineto form a collective outflow. we compare our simulation to observations withsynthetic h_2 and co observations and find that the morphology and kinematicsof such a collective outflow resembles some observed massive outflows, such ascepheus a and dr 21. we finally compare physical quantities derived fromsimulated observations of our models to the actual values in the models toexamine the reliability of standard methods for deriving physical quantities,demonstrating that those methods indeed recover the actual values to within afactor of 2-3.

1405.3991	radial stresses and energy transport in accretion disks	early in the study of viscous accretion disks it was realized that energytransfers from distant sources must be important, not least because the flow atthe disk midplane in the bulk of the disk is likely outwards, out of thegravitational potential well. if the source of the viscosity is powered byaccretion, such as in the case of the magneto-rotational instability, suchdistant energy sources must lie in the innermost regions of the disk, whereaccretion occurs even at the midplane. we argue here that modulations in thisenergy supply can alter the accretion rate on dynamical, rather than far longerviscous, time scales. this means that both the steady state value of andfluctuations in the inner disk's accretion rate, depending on the details ofthe inner boundary condition and occurring on the inner disk's rapid evolutiontime, can affect the outer disk. this is particularly interesting becauseobservations have shown that disk accretion is not steady (e.g.~ex lupi typeobjects). we also note that the power supplied to shearing boxes is set by theboxes themselves rather than the physical energy fluxes in a global disk. thatis, their saturated magnetic field is not subject to the full set of energyconstraints present in an actual disk. our analysis suggests that large scaleradial transport of energy has a critical impact on the evolution andvariability of accretion disks.

1406.5195	temperature fluctuations driven by magnetorotational instability in  protoplanetary disks	the magnetorotational instability (mri) drives magnetized turbulence insufficiently ionized regions of protoplanetary disks, leading to massaccretion. the dissipation of the potential energy associated with thisaccretion determines the thermal structure of accreting regions. untilrecently, the heating from the turbulence has only been treated in anazimuthally averaged sense, neglecting local fluctuations. however, magnetizedturbulence dissipates its energy intermittently in current sheet structures. westudy this intermittent energy dissipation using high resolution numericalmodels including a treatment of radiative thermal diffusion in an opticallythick regime. our models predict that these turbulent current sheets driveorder unity temperature variations even where the mri is damped strongly byohmic resistivity. this implies that the current sheet structures where energydissipation occurs must be well resolved to correctly capture the flowstructure in numerical models. higher resolutions are required to resolveenergy dissipation than to resolve the magnetic field strength or accretionstresses. the temperature variations are large enough to have majorconsequences for mineral formation in disks, including melting chondrules,remelting calcium-aluminum rich inclusions, and annealing silicates; and maydrive hysteresis: current sheets in mri active regions could be significantlymore conductive than the remainder of the disk.

0803.2892	the origin and kinematics of cold gas in galactic winds: insight from  numerical simulations	we study the origin of na i absorbing gas in ultraluminous infrared galaxiesmotivated by the recent observations by martin of extremely superthermallinewidths in this cool gas. we model the effects of repeated supernovaexplosions driving supershells in the central regions of molecular disks withm_d=10^10 m_\sun, using cylindrically symmetric gas dynamical simulations runwith zeus-3d. the shocked swept-up shells quickly cool and fragment byrayleigh-taylor instability as they accelerate out of the dense, stratifieddisks. the numerical resolution of the cooling and compression at the shockfronts determines the peak shell density, and so the speed of rayleigh-taylorfragmentation. we identify cooled shells and shell fragments as na i absorbinggas and study its kinematics. we find that simulations with a numericalresolution of \le 0.2 pc produce multiple rayleigh-taylor fragmented shells ina given line of sight. we suggest that the observed wide na i absorption lines,&lt;v&gt; = 320 \pm 120 km s^-1 are produced by these multiple fragmented shellstraveling at different velocities. we also suggest that some shell fragmentscan be accelerated above the observed average terminal velocity of 750 km s^-1by the same energy-driven wind with an instantaneous starburst of \sim 10^9m_\sun. the bulk of mass is traveling with the observed average shell velocity330 \pm 100 km s^-1. our results show that an energy-driven bubble causingrayleigh-taylor instabilities can explain the kinematics of cool gas seen inthe na i observations without invoking additional physics relying primarily onmomentum conservation, such as entrainment of gas by kelvin-helmholtzinstabilities, ram pressure driving of cold clouds by a hot wind, or radiationpressure acting on dust.

1501.00493	the origin of the hot gas in the galactic halo: testing galactic  fountain models' x-ray emission	we test the x-ray emission predictions of galactic fountain models againstxmm-newton measurements of the emission from the milky way's hot halo. thesemeasurements are from 110 sight lines, spanning the full range of galacticlongitudes. we find that a magnetohydrodynamical simulation of asupernova-driven interstellar medium, which features a flow of hot gas from thedisk to the halo, reproduces the temperature but significantly underpredictsthe 0.5-2.0 kev surface brightness of the halo (by two orders of magnitude, ifwe compare the median predicted and observed values). this is true for versionsof the model with and without an interstellar magnetic field. we considerdifferent reasons for the discrepancy between the model predictions and theobservations. we find taking into account overionization in cooled halo plasma,which could in principle boost the predicted x-ray emission, is unlikely inpractice to bring the predictions in line with the observations. we also findthat including thermal conduction, which would tend to increase the surfacebrightnesses of interfaces between hot and cold gas, would not overcome thesurface brightness shortfall. however, charge exchange emission from suchinterfaces, not included in the current model, may be significant. thefaintness of the model may also be due to the lack of cosmic ray driving,meaning that the model may underestimate the amount of material transportedfrom the disk to halo. in addition, an extended hot halo of accreted materialmay be important, by supplying hot electrons that could boost the emission ofthe material driven out from the disk. additional model predictions are neededto test the relative importance of these processes in explaining the observedhalo emission.

1503.07347	growth of asteroids, planetary embryos and kuiper belt objects by  chondrule accretion	chondrules are millimeter-sized spherules that dominate primitive meteorites(chondrites) originating from the asteroid belt. the incorporation ofchondrules into asteroidal bodies must be an important step in planetformation, but the mechanism is not understood. we show that the main growth ofasteroids can result from gas-drag-assisted accretion of chondrules. thelargest planetesimals of a population with a characteristic radius of 100 kmundergo run-away accretion of chondrules within ~3 myr, forming planetaryembryos up to mars sizes along with smaller asteroids whose size distributionmatches that of main belt asteroids. the aerodynamical accretion leads tosize-sorting of chondrules consistent with chondrites. accretion of mm-sizedchondrules and ice particles drives the growth of planetesimals beyond the iceline as well, but the growth time increases above the disk life time outside of25 au. the contribution of direct planetesimal accretion to the growth of bothasteroids and kuiper belt objects is minor. in contrast, planetesimal accretionand chondrule accretion play more equal roles for the formation of moon-sizedembryos in the terrestrial planet formation region. these embryos are isolatedfrom each other and accrete planetesimals only at a low rate. however, thecontinued accretion of chondrules destabilizes the oligarchic configuration andleads to the formation of mars-sized embryos and terrestrial planets by acombination of direct chondrule accretion and giant impacts.

1504.00066	on shocks driven by high-mass planets in radiatively inefficient disks.  i. two-dimensional global disk simulations	recent observations of gaps and non-axisymmetric features in the dustdistributions of transition disks have been interpreted as evidence of embeddedmassive protoplanets. however, comparing the predictions of planet-diskinteraction models to the observed features has shown far from perfectagreement. this may be due to the strong approximations used for thepredictions. for example, spiral arm fitting typically uses results that arebased on low-mass planets in an isothermal gas. in this work, we describetwo-dimensional, global, hydrodynamical simulations of disks with embeddedprotoplanets, with and without the assumption of local isothermality, for arange of planet-to-star mass ratios 1-10 m_jup for a 1 m_sun star. we use thepencil code in polar coordinates for our models. we find that the inner andouter spiral wakes of massive protoplanets (m&gt;5 m_jup) produce significantshock heating that can trigger buoyant instabilities. these drive sustainedturbulence throughout the disk when they occur. the strength of this effectdepends strongly on the mass of the planet and the thermal relaxationtimescale; for a 10 m_jup planet embedded in a thin, purely adiabatic disk, thespirals, gaps, and vortices typically associated with planet-disk interactionsare disrupted. we find that the effect is only weakly dependent on the initialradial temperature profile. the spirals that form in disks heated by theeffects we have described may fit the spiral structures observed in transitiondisks better than the spirals predicted by linear isothermal theory.

1510.08429	hydrodynamic simulations of the interaction between an agb star and a  main sequence companion in eccentric orbits	the rotten egg nebula has at its core a binary composed of a mira star and ana-type companion at a separation &gt;10 au. it has been hypothesized to haveformed by strong binary interactions between the mira and a companion in aneccentric orbit during periastron passage ~800 years ago. we have performedhydrodynamic simulations of an asymptotic giant branch star interacting withcompanions with a range of masses in orbits with a range of initialeccentricities and periastron separations. for reasonable values of theeccentricity, we find that roche lobe overflow can take place only if theperiods are &lt;&lt;100 years. moreover, mass transfer causes the system to enter acommon envelope phase within several orbits. since the central star of therotten egg nebula is an agb star, we conclude that such a common envelope phasemust have lead to a merger, so the observed companion must have been a tertiarycompanion of a binary that merged at the time of nebula ejection. based on themass and timescale of the simulated disc formed around the companion before thecommon envelope phase, we analytically estimate the properties of jets thatcould be launched. allowing for super-eddington accretion rates, we find thatjets similar to those observed are plausible, provided that the putative lostcompanion was relatively massive.

1511.02988	on shocks driven by high-mass planets in radiatively inefficient disks.  ii. three-dimensional global disk simulations	recent high-resolution, near-infrared images of protoplanetary disks haveshown that these disks often present spiral features. spiral arms are among thestructures predicted decades ago by numerical simulations of disk-planetinteraction and thus it is tempting to suspect that planetary perturbers areresponsible for the observed signatures. however, such interpretation is notfree of problems. the spirals are found to have large pitch angles, and in atleast one case (hd 100546) the spiral feature appears effectively unpolarized,which implies thermal emission of the order of 1000k (465$\pm$40k at closerinspection). we have recently shown in two-dimensional models that shockdissipation in the supersonic wake of high-mass planets can lead to significantheating if the disk is sufficiently adiabatic. in this paper we extend thisanalysis to three dimensions in thermodynamically evolving disks. we use thepencil code in spherical coordinates for our models, with a prescription forthermal cooling based on the optical depth of the local vertical gas column. weuse a 5$m_j$ planet, and show that shocks in the region around the planet wherethe lindblad resonances occur heat the gas to substantially higher temperaturesthan the ambient disk gas at that radius. the gas is accelerated verticallyaway from the midplane by the shocks to form shock bores, and the gas fallingback toward the midplane breaks up into a turbulent surf near the lindbladresonances. this turbulence, although localized, has high $\alpha$ values,reaching 0.05 in the inner lindblad resonance, and 0.1 in the outer one. wealso find evidence that the disk regions heated up by the planetary shockseventually becomes superadiabatic, generating convection far from the planet'sorbit.

astro-ph;0002291	the shock waves in decaying supersonic turbulence	we here analyse numerical simulations of supersonic, hypersonic andmagnetohydrodynamic turbulence that is free to decay. our goals are tounderstand the dynamics of the decay and the characteristic properties of theshock waves produced. this will be useful for interpretation of observations ofboth motions in molecular clouds and sources of non-thermal radiation.  we find that decaying hypersonic turbulence possesses an exponential tail offast shocks and an exponential decay in time, i.e. the number of shocks isproportional to t exp (-ktv) for shock velocity jump v and mean initialwavenumber k. in contrast to the velocity gradients, the velocity probabilitydistribution function remains gaussian with a more complex decay law.  the energy is dissipated not by fast shocks but by a large number of low machnumber shocks. the power loss peaks near a low-speed turn-over in anexponential distribution. an analytical extension of the mapping closuretechnique is able to predict the basic decay features. our analytic descriptionof the distribution of shock strengths should prove useful for direct modelingof observable emission. we note that an exponential distribution of shocks suchas we find will, in general, generate very low excitation shock signatures.

astro-ph;0008125	the distribution of shock waves in driven supersonic turbulence	supersonic turbulence generates distributions of shock waves. here, weanalyse the shock waves in three-dimensional numerical simulations of uniformlydriven supersonic turbulence, with and without magnetohydrodynamics andself-gravity. we can identify the nature of the turbulence by measuring thedistribution of the shock strengths.  we find that uniformly driven turbulence possesses a power law distributionof fast shocks with the number of shocks inversely proportional to the squareroot of the shock jump speed. a tail of high speed shocks steeper than gaussianresults from the random superposition of driving waves which decay rapidly. theenergy is dissipated by a small range of fast shocks. these results contrastwith the exponential distribution and slow shock dissipation associated withdecaying turbulence.  a strong magnetic field enhances the shock number transverse to the fielddirection at the expense of parallel shocks. a simulation with self-gravitydemonstrates the development of a number of highly dissipative accretionshocks. finally, we examine the dynamics to demonstrate how the power-lawbehaviour arises.

astro-ph;0106509	the distribution of pressures in a supernova-driven interstellar medium	observations have suggested substantial departures from pressure equilibriumin the interstellar medium (ism) in the plane of the galaxy, even on scalesunder 50 pc. nevertheless, multi-phase models of the ism assume at leastlocally isobaric gas. the pressure then determines the density reached by gascooling to stable thermal equilibrium. we use two different sets of numericalmodels of the ism to examine the consequences of supernova driving forinterstellar pressures. the first set of models is hydrodynamical, and usesadaptive mesh refinement to allow computation of a 1 x 1 x 20 kpc section of astratified galactic disk. the second set of models is magnetohydrodynamical,using an independent code framework, and examines a 200 pc cubed periodicdomain threaded by magnetic fields. both of these models show broad pressuredistributions with roughly log-normal functional forms produced by both shocksand rarefaction waves, rather than the power-law distributions predicted byprevious work, with rather sharp thermal pressure gradients. the width of thedistribution of the logs of pressure in gas with log t &lt; 3.9 is proportional tothe rms mach number in that gas, while the distribution in hotter gas isbroader, but not so broad as would be predicted by the mach numbers in thatgas. individual parcels of gas reach widely varying points on the thermalequilibrium curve: no unique set of phases is found, but rather adynamically-determined continuum of densities and temperatures. furthermore, asubstantial fraction of the gas remains entirely out of thermal equilibrium.our results appear consistent with observations of interstellar pressures, andsuggest that the pressures observed in molecular clouds may be due to rampressure rather than gravitational confinement.

astro-ph;0109447	column density probability distribution functions in turbulent molecular  clouds: a comparison between theory and observations	the one-point statistics of column density distributions of turbulentmolecular cloud models are investigated and compared with observations. inagreement with the observations, the number n of pixels with surface density sis distributed exponentially n(s)=exp(-s/s0) in models of driven compressiblesupersonic turbulence. however, in contrast to the observations, theexponential slope defined by s0 is not universal but instead depends stronglyon the adopted rms mach number and on the smoothing of the data cube. wedemonstrate that this problem can be solved if one restricts the analysis ofthe surface density distribution to subregions with sizes equal to thecorrelation length of the flow which turns out to be given by the drivingscale. in this case, the column density distributions are universal with aslope that is in excellent agreement with the observations and independent ofthe mach number or smoothing. the observed molecular clouds therefore arecoherent structures with sizes of order their correlation lengths. turbulenceinside these clouds must be driven on the largest scales, if at all. numericalmodels of turbulent molecular clouds have to be restricted to cubes with sizessimilar to the correlation lengthscale in order to be compared withobservations. our results imply that turbulence is generated on scales that aremuch larger that the jeans length. in this case, gravitational collapse cannotbe suppressed and star formation should start in molecular clouds within adynamical timescale after their formation.

astro-ph;0208278	the influence of supershells and galactic outflows on the escape of  ionizing radiation from dwarf starburst galaxies	we study the escape of lyman continuum radiation from the disks of dwarfstarburst galaxies, with and without supershells, by solving the radiationtransfer problem of stellar radiation through them. we model disks withmd=10^8-10msun, with exponential surface density profiles as a function ofredshift, and model the of repeated supernova explosions driving supershellsout of the disks, using the hydrodynamic simulation code, zeus-3d. the amountof star formation is assumed proportional to mass above some density threshold.we vary the threshold to explore the range of star formation efficiencies,f*=0.006, 0.06, and 0.6. we find that the interstellar gas swept up in densesupershells can effectively trap the ionizing photons, before the supershellsblow out of the disks. the blow-outs then create galactic outflows, chimneyswhich allow the photons to escape directly to the intergalactic medium. ourresults are consistent with escape fractions of less than 0.1 measured in localdwarf starburst galaxies, because they are likely observed while the starburstsare young, before blow-out. we suggest that high-redshift dwarf starburstgalaxies may make a substantial contribution to the uv background radiationwith total escape fractions &gt;0.2, as expected if star formation efficiencies&gt;0.06.

astro-ph;0208441	mixing time scales in a supernova-driven interstellar medium	we study the mixing of chemical species in the interstellar medium (ism).recent observations suggest that the distribution of species such as deuteriumin the ism may be far from homogeneous. this raises the question of how long ittakes for inhomogeneities to be erased in the ism, and how this depends on thelength scale of the inhomogeneities. we added a tracer field to thethree-dimensional, supernova-driven ism model of avillez (2000) to study mixingand dispersal in kiloparsec-scale simulations of the ism with differentsupernova (sn) rates and different inhomogeneity length scales. we find severalsurprising results. classical mixing length theory fails to predict the veryweak dependence of mixing time on length scale that we find on scales of25--500 pc. derived diffusion coefficients increase exponentially with time,rather than remaining constant. the variance of composition declinesexponentially, with a time constant of tens of myr, so that large differencesfade faster than small ones. the time constant depends on the inverse squareroot of the supernova rate. one major reason for these results is that evenwith numerical diffusion exceeding physical values, gas does not mix quicklybetween hot and cold regions.

astro-ph;0302606	effects of the equation of state on the formation of star clusters	we study the effect of varying the equation of state on the formation ofstellar clusters in turbulent molecular clouds, using three-dimensional,smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations. our results show that the equationof state helps determine how strongly self-gravitating gas fragments. thedegree of fragmentation decreases with increasing \new{polytropic exponent}$\gamma$ in the range $0.2 &lt; \gamma &lt; 1.4$, although the total amount of\new{mass accreted onto collapsed fragments} appears to remain roughly constantthrough that range. low values of $\gamma$ are expected to lead to theformation of dense clusters of low-mass stars, while $\gamma&gt;1$ probablyresults in the formation of isolated and massive stars. fragmentation andcollapse ceases entirely for $\gamma &gt; 1.4$ as expected from analyticarguments. the mass spectrum of overdense gas clumps is roughly log-normal for{\em non}-self-gravitating turbulent gas, but changes to a power-law under theaction of gravity. the spectrum of collapsed cores, on the other hand, remainslog-normal for $\gamma\le 1$, but flattens markedly for $\gamma &gt;1$. thedensity pdfs approach log-normal, with widths that decrease with increasing$\gamma$. primordial gas may have effective $\gamma &gt; 1$, in which case theseresults could help explain why models of the formation of the first stars tendto produce isolated, massive objects.

(hamming) inthe spirit of this adage, and of don cox's approach to scientific speaking, wediscuss the questions that the latest generation of numerical models of theinterstellar medium raise, at least for us. the energy source for theinterstellar turbulence is still under discussion. we review the argument forsupernovae dominating in star forming regions. magnetorotational instabilityhas been suggested as a way of coupling disk shear to the turbulent flow.models make evident that the unstable wavelengths are very long compared tothermally unstable wavelengths, with implications for star formation in theouter galaxy and low surface brightness disks. the perennial question of thefactors determining the hot gas filling factor in a sn-driven medium remainsopen, in particular because of the unexpectedly strong turbulent mixing at theboundaries of hot cavities seen in the models. the formation of molecularclouds in the turbulent flow is also poorly understood. dense regions suitablefor cloud formation clearly form even in the absence of self-gravity, althoughtheir ultimate evolution remains to be computed.

astro-ph;0403469	gravoturbulent star cluster formation	stars form by gravoturbulent fragmentation of interstellar gas clouds. thesupersonic turbulence ubiquitously observed in galactic molecular gas generatesstrong density fluctuations with gravity taking over in the densest and mostmassive regions. collapse sets in to build up stars and star clusters.  turbulence plays a dual role. on global scales it provides support, while atthe same time it can promote local collapse. stellar birth is thus intimatelylinked to the dynamical behavior of parental gas cloud, which determines whenand where protostellar cores form, and how they contract and grow in mass viaaccretion from the surrounding cloud material to build up stars. slow,inefficient, isolated star formation is a hallmark of turbulent support,whereas fast, efficient, clustered star formation occurs in its absence.  the fact that galactic molecular clouds are highly filamentary can beexplained by a combination of compressional flows and shear. the dynamicalevolution of nascent star clusters is very complex. this strongly influencesthe stellar mass spectrum. the equation of state (eos) plays a pivotal role inthe fragmentation process. under typical cloud conditions, massive stars formas part of dense clusters. however, for gas with effective polytropic indexgreater than unity star formation becomes biased towards isolated massivestars, which may be of relevance for understanding pop iii stars.

astro-ph;0407249	initial ionization of compressible turbulence	we study the effects of the initial conditions of turbulent molecular cloudson the ionization structure in newly formed h_{ii} regions, usingthree-dimensional, photon-conserving radiative transfer in a pre-computeddensity field from three-dimensional compressible turbulence. our results showthat the initial density structure of the gas cloud can play an important rolein the resulting structure of the h_{ii} region. the propagation of theionization fronts, the shape of the resulting h_{ii} region, and the total massionized depend on the properties of the turbulent density field. cuts throughthe ionized regions generally show ``butterfly'' shapes rather than sphericalones, while emission measure maps are more spherical if the turbulence isdriven on scales small compared to the size of the h_{ii} region. theionization structure can be described by an effective clumping factor $\zeta=&lt;n &gt; \cdot &lt; n^2&gt;/&lt; n&gt;^2$, where $n$ is number density of the gas. the largerthe value of $\zeta$, the less mass is ionized, and the more irregular theh_{ii} region shapes. because we do not follow dynamics, our results apply onlyto the early stage of ionization when the speed of the ionization frontsremains much larger than the sound speed of the ionized gas, or alfv\'en speedin magnetized clouds if it is larger, so that the dynamical effects can benegligible.

astro-ph;0410351	the stellar mass spectrum from non-isothermal gravoturbulent  fragmentation	identifying the processes that determine the initial mass function of stars(imf) is a fundamental problem in star formation theory. one of the majoruncertainties is the exact chemical state of the star forming gas and itsinfluence on the dynamical evolution. most simulations of star forming clustersuse an isothermal equation of state (eos). however, theoretical predictions andobservations suggest that the effective polytropic exponent gamma in the eosvaries with density.  we address these issues and study the effect of a piecewise polytropic eos onthe formation of stellar clusters in turbulent, self-gravitating molecularclouds using three-dimensional, smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations. toapproximate the results of published predictions of the thermal behavior ofcollapsing clouds, we increase the polytropic exponent gamma from 0.7 to 1.1 atsome chosen density n_c, which we vary. the change of thermodynamic state atn_c selects a characteristic mass scale for fragmentation m_ch, which we relateto the peak of the observed imf. our investigation generally supports the ideathat the distribution of stellar masses depends mainly on the thermodynamicstate of the star-forming gas. the thermodynamic state of interstellar gas is aresult of the balance between heating and cooling processes, which in turn aredetermined by fundamental atomic and molecular physics and by chemicalabundances. given the abundances, the derivation of a characteristic stellarmass can thus be based on universal quantities and constants.

astro-ph;0410734	the distribution of pressures in a supernova-driven interstellar medium.  i. magnetized medium	observations have suggested substantial departures from pressure equilibriumin the interstellar medium (ism) in the plane of the galaxy, even on scalesunder 50 pc. nevertheless, multi-phase models of the ism assume at leastlocally isobaric gas. the pressure then determines the density reached by gascooling to stable thermal equilibrium. we use numerical models of themagnetized ism to examine the consequences of supernova driving forinterstellar pressures. in this paper we examine a (200 pc)^3 periodic domainthreaded by magnetic fields. individual parcels of gas at different pressuresreach widely varying points on the thermal equilibrium curve: no unique set ofphases is found, but rather a dynamically-determined continuum of densities andtemperatures. a substantial fraction of the gas remains entirely out of thermalequilibrium. our results appear consistent with observations of interstellarpressures. they also suggest that the high pressures observed in molecularclouds may be due to ram pressures in addition to gravitational forces. much ofthe gas in our model lies far from equipartition between thermal and magneticpressures, with ratios ranging from 0.1 to $10^4$ and ratios of uniform tofluctuating magnetic field of 0.5--1. our models show broad pressureprobability distribution functions with log-normal functional forms produced byboth shocks and rarefaction waves, rather than power-law distributions producedby isolated supernova remnants. the width of the distribution can be describedquantitatively by a formula derived from the work of padoan, nordlund, &amp; jones(1997).

astro-ph;0601005	turbulent structure of a stratified supernova-driven interstellar medium	to study how supernova feedback structures the turbulent interstellar medium,we construct 3d models of vertically stratified gas stirred by discretesupernova explosions, including vertical gravitational field and parametrizedheating and cooling. the models reproduce many observed characteristics of thegalaxy such as global circulation of gas (i.e., galactic fountain) and theexistence of cold dense clouds in the galactic disk. global quantities of themodel such as warm and hot gas filling factors in the midplane, mass fractionof thermally unstable gas, and the averaged vertical density profile arecompared directly with existing observations, and shown to be broadlyconsistent. we find that energy injection occurs over a broad range of scales.there is no single effective driving scale, unlike the usual assumption foridealized models of incompressible turbulence. however, &gt;90% of the totalkinetic energy is contained in wavelengths shortward of 200 pc. the shape ofthe kinetic energy spectrum differs substantially from that of the velocitypower spectrum, which implies that the velocity structure varies with the gasdensity. velocity structure functions demonstrate that the phenomenologicaltheory proposed by boldyrev is applicable to the medium. we show that it can bemisleading to predict physical properties such as the stellar initial massfunction based on numerical simulations that do not include self-gravity of thegas. even if all the gas in turbulently jeans unstable regions in oursimulation is assumed to collapse and form stars in local freefall times, theresulting total collapse rate is significantly lower than the value consistentwith the input supernova rate. supernova-driven turbulence inhibits starformation globally rather than triggering it.

astro-ph;0605501	dynamical expansion of h ii regions from ultracompact to compact sizes  in turbulent, self-gravitating molecular clouds	the nature of ultracompact h ii regions (uchrs) remains poorly determined. inparticular, they are about an order of magnitude more common than would beexpected if they formed around young massive stars and lasted for one dynamicaltime, around 10^4 yr. we here perform three-dimensional numerical simulationsof the expansion of an h ii region into self-gravitating, radiatively cooledgas, both with and without supersonic turbulent flows. in the laminar case, wefind that h ii region expansion in a collapsing core produces nearly sphericalshells, even if the ionizing source is off-center in the core. this agrees withanalytic models of blast waves in power-law media. in the turbulent case, wefind that the h ii region does not disrupt the central collapsing region, butrather sweeps up a shell of gas in which further collapse occurs. although thisdoes not constitute triggering, as the swept-up gas would eventually havecollapsed anyway, it does expose the collapsing regions to ionizing radiation.we suggest that these regions of secondary collapse, which will not allthemselves form massive stars, may form the bulk of observed uchrs. as thelarger shell will take over 10^5 years to complete its evolution, this couldsolve the timescale problem. our suggestion is supported by the ubiquitousobservation of more diffuse emission surrounding uchrs.

astro-ph;0607444	correlations between central massive objects and their host galaxies:  from bulgeless spirals to ellipticals	recent observations by ferrarese et al. (2006) and wehner et al. (2006)reveal that a majority of galaxies contain a central massive object (cmo),either a supermassive black hole (smbh) or a compact stellar nucleus,regardless of the galaxy mass or morphological type, and that there is a tightrelation between the masses of cmos and those of the host galaxies. severalrecent studies show that feedback from black holes can successfully explain the$\msigma$ correlation in massive elliptical galaxies that contain smbhs.however, puzzles remain in spirals or dwarf spheroids that do not appear tohave black holes but instead harbor a compact central stellar cluster. here weuse three-dimensional, smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of isolatedgalaxies to study the formation and evolution of cmos in bulgeless diskgalaxies, and simulations of merging galaxies to study the transition of thecmo--host mass relation from late-type bulgeless spirals to early-typeellipticals. our results suggest that the observed correlations may beestablished primarily by the depletion of gas in the central region byaccretion and star-formation, and may hold for all galaxy types. a systematicsearch for cmos in the nuclei of bulgeless disk galaxies would offer a test ofthis conclusion.

astro-ph;0702549	turbulent torques on protoplanets in a dead zone	migration of protoplanets in their gaseous host disks may be largelyresponsible for the observed orbital distribution of extrasolar planets. recentsimulations have shown that the magnetorotational turbulence thought to driveaccretion in protoplanetary disks can affect migration by turning it into anorbital random walk. however, these simulations neglected the disk's ionizationstructure. low ionization fraction near the midplane of the disk can decouplethe magnetic field from the gas, forming a dead zone with reduced or noturbulence. here, to understand the effect of dead zones on protoplanetarymigration, we perform numerical simulations of a small region of a stratifieddisk with magnetorotational turbulence confined to thin active layers above andbelow the midplane. turbulence in the active layers exerts decreased, but stillmeasurable, gravitational torques on a protoplanet located at the diskmidplane. we find a decrease of two orders of magnitude in the diffusioncoefficient for dead zones with dead-to-active surface density ratiosapproaching realistic values in protoplanetary disks. this torque arisesprimarily from density fluctuations within a distance of one scale height ofthe protoplanet. turbulent torques have correlation times of only $\sim 0.3$orbital periods and apparently time-stationary distributions. these propertiesare encouraging signs that stochastic methods can be used to determine theorbital evolution of populations of protoplanets under turbulent migration. ourresults indicate that dead zones may be dynamically distinct regions forprotoplanetary migration.

astro-ph;9611058	the omc-1 molecular hydrogen outflow as a fragmented stellar wind bubble	we present new images of the omc-1 molecular hydrogen outflow, made usinglong-slit spectroscopy in order to accurately subtract the underlying continuumemission. these images reveal an extremely clumpy, quasi-spherical inner shellthat breaks up at larger radii into bow-shocks and trailing wakes in thenorth-west, as originally described by allen &amp; burton (1993); a faintercounter-finger to the south-east is newly discovered in the present data. whilethe outflow appears to be broadly bipolar, this is probably due to aninteraction between an initially spherical wind from the source and alarge-scale density enhancement surrounding it, rather than direct collimationimposed close to the source. the clumpy appearance of the inner shell confirmsthe prediction of the recent model of stone, xu, &amp; mundy (1995), in which aspherical and time-varying wind fragments a swept-up shell, producinghigh-velocity shrapnel, which in turn drives bow-shocks into the surroundinggas, resulting in the observed "fingers". as an alternative to the singlevarying source proposed by stone et al., we speculate that several youngsources in the bn-kl cluster may have been responsible for first sweeping upthe shell and then fragmenting it.

astro-ph;9703171	the formation of c-shocks: structure and signatures	shock waves in molecular clouds should evolve into continuous or c-typestructures due to the magnetic field and ion-neutral friction. we heredetermine whether and how this is achieved through plane-parallel numericalsimulations using an extended version of zeus. we first describe and test theadapted code against analytical results, laying the necessary foundations forsubsequent works on supersonic ambipolar diffusion, including c-type jets andshock instability.  the evolution away from jump shocks toward the numerous steady c-shocksub-types is then investigated. the evolution passes through four stages, whichpossess distinctive observational properties. the time scales and length scalescover broad ranges. specific results are included for shock types includingswitch, absorber, neutralised, oblique, transverse and intermediate. onlyintermediate type ii shocks and `slow shocks', including switch-off shocks,remain as j-type under the low ion levels assumed. other shocks transform via asteadily growing neutral precursor to a diminishing jump. for neutralisedshocks, this takes the form of an extended long-lived ramp.  molecular hydrogen emission signatures are presented. after the jump speedhas dropped to under 25 km/s, a non-dissociative jump section can dominate thespectra for a long period. this produces a high-excitation spectrum. once thejump has further weakened, to &lt; 8 km/s, the fully developed ion front isresponsible for brisk progress towards a constant c-type excitation. the timescale for emission-line variations is ~(6 /n_i) yr, where n_i is the pre-shockion number density.

astro-ph;9809177	the energy dissipation rate of supersonic, magnetohydrodynamic  turbulence in molecular clouds	molecular clouds have broad linewidths suggesting turbulent supersonicmotions in the clouds. these motions are usually invoked to explain whymolecular clouds take much longer than a free-fall time to form stars. it hasclassically been thought that supersonic hydrodynamical turbulence woulddissipate its energy quickly, but that the introduction of strong magneticfields could maintain these motions. in a previous paper it has been shown,however, that isothermal, compressible, mhd and hydrodynamical turbulence decayat virtually the same rate, requiring that constant driving occur to maintainthe observed turbulence. in this paper direct numerical computations ofuniformly driven turbulence with the zeus astrophysical mhd code are used toderive the absolute value of energy dissipation as a function of the drivingwavelength and amplitude. the ratio of the formal decay time of turbulencee_{kin}/\dot{e}_{kin} to the free-fall time of the gas can then be derived as afunction of the ratio of driving wavelength to jeans wavelength and rms machnumber, and shown to be most likely far less than unity, again showing thatturbulence in molecular clouds must be constantly and strongly driven.(abridged)

astro-ph;9905025	giant outbursts of luminous blue variables and the formation of the  homunculus nebula around eta carinae	the observed giant outbursts of luminous blue variables (lbvs) may occur whenthese massive stars approach their eddington limits. when this happens, theymust reach a point where the centrifugal force and the radiative accelerationcancel out gravity at the equator. we call this the omega-limit. when stars areclose to the omega-limit, strong non-spherical mass loss should occur. thissuggests a scenario where a slow and very dense wind, strongly confined to theequatorial plane, is followed by a fast and almost spherical wind. we computetwo-dimensional hydrodynamic models of the evolution of the nebula formed fromsuch interacting winds, using parameters consistent with the outburst of etacarinae in the last century. this outburst gave birth to the homunculus, thehourglass-shaped inner part of a highly structured circumstellar nebula.assuming the star was very close to the omega-limit during outburst, our modelsproduce gas distributions that strongly resemble the homunculus on large andsmall scale. this supports the general conjecture that giant outbursts in lbvsoccur when they approach the eddington limit. our models constrains the averagemass loss rate since the outburst to values smaller than the present-day massloss rate and suggest that eta car is approaching another outburst. our modelsimply that the occurrence of giant lbv outbursts depends on the initial stellarrotation rate, and that the initial angular momentum is as important to theevolution of very massive stars as their initial mass or metallicity.

astro-ph;9911068	gravitational collapse in turbulent molecular clouds. i. gasdynamical  turbulence	observed molecular clouds often appear to have very low star formationefficiencies and lifetimes an order of magnitude longer than their free-falltimes. their support is attributed to the random supersonic motions observed inthem. we study the support of molecular clouds against gravitational collapseby supersonic, gas dynamical turbulence using direct numerical simulation.computations with two different algorithms are compared: a particle-based,lagrangian method (sph), and a grid-based, eulerian, second-order method(zeus). the effects of both algorithm and resolution can be studied with thismethod. we find that, under typical molecular cloud conditions, global collapsecan indeed be prevented, but density enhancements caused by strong shocksnevertheless become gravitationally unstable and collapse into dense cores and,presumably, stars. the occurance and efficiency of local collapse decreases asthe driving wave length decreases and the driving strength increases. itappears that local collapse can only be prevented entirely with unrealisticallyshort wave length driving, but observed core formation rates can be reproducedwith more realistic driving. at high collapse rates, cores are formed on shorttime scales in coherent structures with high efficiency, while at low collapserates they are scattered randomly throughout the region and exhibitconsiderable age spread. we suggest that this naturally explains the observeddistinction between isolated and clustered star formation.

(the classical example of this is ngc 6888.) what isthe actual state of bubble and superbubble interiors?

0811.3747	dependence of interstellar turbulent pressure on supernova rate	feedback from massive stars is one of the least understood aspects of galaxyformation. we perform a suite of vertically stratified local interstellarmedium (ism) simulations in which supernova rates and vertical gas columndensities are systematically varied based on the schmidt-kennicutt law. oursimulations have a sufficiently high spatial resolution (1.95 pc) to follow thehydrodynamic interactions among multiple supernovae that structure the ism. ata given supernova rate, we find that the mean mass-weighted sound speed andvelocity dispersion decrease as the inverse square root of gas density,indicating that both thermal and turbulent pressures are nearly constant in themidplane, so the effective equation of state is isobaric. in contrast, acrossour four models having supernova rates that range from one to 512 times thegalactic supernova rate, the mass-weighted velocity dispersion remains in therange 4-6 km/s. hence, gas averaged over ~100 pc regions follows an effectiveequation of state that is close to isothermal. simulated h i emission lineshave widths of 10-18 km/s, comparable to observed values. in our highestsupernova rate model, superbubble blow-outs occur, and the turbulent pressureon large scales is &gt;~4 times higher than the thermal pressure. we find a tightcorrelation between the thermal and turbulent pressures averaged over ~100 pcregions in the midplane of each model, as well as across the four ism models.we construct a subgrid model for turbulent pressure based on analytic argumentsand explicitly calibrate it against our stratified ism simulations. the subgridmodel provides a simple yet physically motivated way to include supernovafeedback in cosmological simulations.
